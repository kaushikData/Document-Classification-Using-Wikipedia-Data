The year '''551 BC''' was a year of the [[Roman calendar|pre-Julian Roman calendar]]. In the [[Roman Empire]], it was known as '''year 203 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''. The denomination 551 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

'''Andrew Johnson''' (December 29, 1808{{spaced ndash}} July 31, 1875) was the 17th [[President of the United States]], serving from 1865 to 1869. Johnson assumed the presidency as he was [[Vice President of the United States]] at the time of the [[assassination of Abraham Lincoln]]. A [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democrat]] who ran with Lincoln on the [[National Union Party (United States)|National Union]] ticket, Johnson came to office as the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] concluded. The new president favored quick restoration of the [[Secession in the United States|seceded states]] to the Union. His plans did not give protection to the [[Freedmen#United States|former slaves]], and he came into conflict with the [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican]]-dominated Congress, culminating in [[Impeachment of Andrew Johnson|his impeachment]] by the House of Representatives. He was acquitted in the Senate by one vote.

Johnson was born in poverty in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]] and never attended school. Apprenticed as a tailor, he worked in several frontier towns before settling in [[Greeneville, Tennessee]]. He served as [[alderman]] and mayor there before being elected to the [[Tennessee House of Representatives]] in 1835. After brief service in the [[Tennessee Senate]], Johnson was elected to the federal House of Representatives in 1843, where he served five two-year terms. He became [[Governor of Tennessee]] for four years, and was elected by the legislature to the U.S. Senate in 1857. In his congressional service, he sought passage of the [[Homestead Bill]], which was enacted soon after he left his Senate seat in 1862. As [[Southern United States|Southern]] slave states, including Tennessee, seceded to form the [[Confederate States of America]], Johnson remained firmly with the Union. He was the only sitting senator from a Confederate state who did not resign his seat upon learning of his state's secession. In 1862, Lincoln appointed him as military governor of Tennessee after most of it had been retaken. In 1864, Johnson, as a [[War Democrat]] and [[Southern Unionist]], was a logical choice as [[running mate]] for Lincoln, who wished to send a message of national unity in his re-election campaign; their ticket easily won. When Johnson was sworn in as vice president in March 1865, he gave a rambling speech, after which he secluded himself to avoid public ridicule. Six weeks later, the assassination of Lincoln made him president.

Johnson implemented his own form of [[Presidential Reconstruction]]&amp;nbsp;– a series of proclamations directing the seceded states to hold conventions and elections to re-form their civil governments. When Southern states returned many of their old leaders, and passed [[Black Codes (United States)|Black Codes]] to deprive the freedmen of many civil liberties, Congressional Republicans refused to seat legislators from those states and advanced legislation to overrule the Southern actions. Johnson vetoed their bills, and Congressional Republicans overrode him, setting a pattern for the remainder of his presidency.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson saw 15 of his vetoes overridden by Congress, [[List of United States presidential vetoes|more than any other President, before or since]].&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson opposed the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], which gave citizenship to former slaves. In 1866, Johnson went on an unprecedented national tour promoting his executive policies, seeking to destroy his Republican opponents.{{sfn|Castel|2002|p=231}} As the conflict between the branches of government grew, Congress passed the [[Tenure of Office Act (1867)|Tenure of Office Act]], restricting Johnson's ability to fire Cabinet officials. When he persisted in trying to dismiss Secretary of War [[Edwin Stanton]], he was impeached by the House of Representatives, and narrowly avoided conviction in the Senate and removal from office. After failing to win the 1868 Democratic presidential nomination, Johnson left office in 1869.

Returning to Tennessee after his presidency, Johnson sought political vindication, and gained it in his eyes when he was elected to the Senate again in 1875, making Johnson the only former president to serve in the Senate. He died months into his term. While some{{sfn|Castel|2002|p=237}} admire Johnson's strict [[constitutionalism]], his strong opposition to federally guaranteed rights for [[African Americans]] is widely criticized. He is regarded by many historians as [[Historical rankings of Presidents of the United States|one of the worst presidents in American history]].

== Early life and career ==

=== Childhood ===
[[File:Andrew Johnsons First Home 2006.jpg|thumb|Johnson's childhood home, located at the [[Mordecai House|Mordecai Historic Park]] in Raleigh, North Carolina]]

Andrew Johnson was born in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], on December 29, 1808, to [[Jacob Johnson (father of Andrew Johnson)|Jacob Johnson]] (1778–1812) and Mary ("Polly") McDonough (1783–1856), a laundress. He was of [[English Americans|English]], [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Scots-Irish]], and [[Irish Americans|Irish]] ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert A. Nowlan|title=The American Presidents From Polk to Hayes: What They Did, What They Said &amp; What Was Said About Them|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0K-nCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA387|year=2016|publisher=Outskirts Press|page=387|isbn=9781478765721|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161223073025/https://books.google.com/books?id=0K-nCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA387|archivedate=December 23, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had a brother William, four years his senior, and an older sister Elizabeth, who died in childhood. Johnson's birth in a two-room shack was a political asset in the mid-19th century, and he would frequently remind voters of his humble origins.{{sfnm|Gordon-Reed|1pp=17–18|Castel|2002|2p=225}} Jacob Johnson was a poor man, as had been his father, William Johnson, but he became town constable of Raleigh before marrying and starting a family. Both Jacob and Mary were illiterate, and had worked as tavern servants, while Johnson never attended school.{{sfn|Castel|2002|p=225}} Johnson grew up in poverty.{{sfn|Castel|2002|p=225}} Jacob died of an apparent heart attack while ringing the town bell, shortly after rescuing three drowning men, when his son Andrew was three.{{sfn|Trefousse|p=20}} Polly Johnson worked as a washerwoman and became the sole support of her family. Her occupation was then looked down on, as it often took her into other homes unaccompanied. There were even rumors that Andrew, who did not resemble his brother or sister, had been fathered by another man. Polly Johnson eventually remarried, to Turner Doughtry, who was as poor as she was.{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|pp=18–22}}

Johnson's mother apprenticed her son William to a tailor, James Selby. Andrew also became an apprentice in Selby's shop at age ten and was legally bound to serve until his 21st birthday. Johnson lived with his mother for part of his service, and one of Selby's employees taught him rudimentary literacy skills.{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|pp=22–23}} His education was augmented by citizens who would come to Selby's shop to read to the tailors as they worked. Even before he became an apprentice, Johnson came to listen. The readings caused a lifelong love of learning, and one of his biographers, [[Annette Gordon-Reed]], suggests that Johnson, later a gifted public speaker, learned the art as he threaded needles and cut cloth.{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|p=26}}

Johnson was not happy at James Selby's, and after about five years, both he and his brother ran away. Selby responded by placing a reward for their return: "Ten Dollars Reward. Ran away from the subscriber, two apprentice boys, legally bound, named William and Andrew Johnson&amp;nbsp;... [payment] to any person who will deliver said apprentices to me in Raleigh, or I will give the above reward for Andrew Johnson alone."{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|p=27}} The brothers went to [[Carthage, North Carolina]], where Andrew Johnson worked as a tailor for several months. Fearing he would be arrested and returned to Raleigh, Johnson moved to [[Laurens, South Carolina]]. He found work quickly, met his first love, Mary Wood, and made her a quilt as a gift. However, she rejected his marriage proposal.  He returned to Raleigh, hoping to buy out his apprenticeship, but could not come to terms with Selby. Unable to stay in Raleigh, where he risked being apprehended for abandoning Selby, he decided to move west.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=23–26}}{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|pp=27–29}}

=== Move to Tennessee ===
Johnson left North Carolina for Tennessee, traveling mostly on foot. After a brief period in [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]], he moved to [[Mooresville, Alabama]].{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=23–26}}{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|pp=29–30}} He then worked as a tailor in [[Columbia, Tennessee]], but was called back to Raleigh by his mother and stepfather, who saw limited opportunities there and who wished to emigrate west. Johnson and his party traveled through the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] to [[Greeneville, Tennessee]]. Andrew Johnson fell in love with the town at first sight, and when he became prosperous purchased the land where he had first camped and planted a tree in commemoration.{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|pp=28–29}}

In Greeneville, Johnson established a successful tailoring business in the front of his home. In 1827, at the age of 18, he married 16-year-old [[Eliza McCardle Johnson|Eliza McCardle]], the daughter of a local shoemaker. The pair were married by Justice of the Peace Mordecai Lincoln, first cousin of [[Thomas Lincoln]], whose son would become president. The Johnsons were married for almost 50 years and had five children: [[Martha Johnson Patterson|Martha]] (1828), Charles (1830), Mary (1832), Robert (1834), and Andrew Jr. (1852). Though she suffered from [[Tuberculosis]], Eliza supported her husband's endeavors. She taught him mathematics skills and tutored him to improve his writing.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=27–29}}{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|pp=31–32}} Shy and retiring by nature, Eliza Johnson usually remained in Greeneville during Johnson's political rise. She was not often seen during her husband's presidency; their daughter Martha usually served as official hostess.{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|p=32}}

Johnson's tailoring business prospered during the early years of the marriage, enabling him to hire help and giving him the funds to invest profitably in real estate.{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|pp=32–33}} He later boasted of his talents as a tailor, "my work never ripped or gave way."{{sfn|Castel|p=3}} He was a voracious reader. Books about famous orators aroused his interest in political dialogue, and he had private debates on the issues of the day with customers who held opposing views. He also took part in debates at [[Greeneville College]].{{sfn|Trefousse|p=31}}

== Political rise ==

=== Tennessee politician ===
Johnson helped organize a mechanics' (working men's) ticket in the 1829 Greeneville municipal election. He was elected town alderman, along with his friends Blackston McDannel and Mordecai Lincoln.{{sfn|Trefousse|p=35}}{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|pp=33–36}} Following the 1831 [[Nat Turner's slave rebellion|Nat Turner slave rebellion]], a state convention was called to pass a new constitution, including provisions to [[disfranchisement|disenfranchise]] free people of color. The convention also wanted to reform real estate tax rates, and provide ways of funding improvements to Tennessee's infrastructure. The constitution was submitted for a public vote, and Johnson spoke widely for its adoption; the successful campaign provided him with statewide exposure. On January 4, 1834, his fellow aldermen elected him mayor of Greeneville.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=33, 36}}{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|pp=36–37}}

[[File:Mrs-E-Johnson.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Eliza McCardle Johnson]]
In 1835, Johnson made a bid for election to the "floater" seat which [[Greene County, Tennessee|Greene County]] shared with neighboring [[Washington County, Tennessee|Washington County]] in the [[Tennessee House of Representatives]]. According to his biographer, [[Hans L. Trefousse]], Johnson "demolished" the opposition in debate and won the election with almost a two to one margin.{{sfn|Trefousse|p=36}}{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|p=37}} Soon after taking his seat, Johnson purchased his first slave, Dolly, aged 14. Dolly had three children over the years. Johnson had the reputation of treating his slaves kindly, and the fact that Dolly was dark-skinned, and her offspring much lighter, led to speculation both during and after his lifetime that he was the father.{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|pp=38–39}} During his Greeneville days, Johnson joined the [[Tennessee Army National Guard|Tennessee Militia]] as a member of the 90th Regiment. He attained the rank of [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]], though while an enrolled member, Johnson was fined for an unknown offense.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=14, 25}} Afterwards, he was often addressed or referred to by his rank.

In his first term in the legislature, which met in the state capital of Nashville, Johnson did not consistently vote with either the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] or the newly formed [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]], though he revered President [[Andrew Jackson]], a Democrat and fellow Tennessean. The major parties were still determining their core values and policy proposals, with the party system in a state of flux. The Whig Party had organized in opposition to Jackson, fearing the concentration of power in the Executive Branch of the government; Johnson differed from the Whigs as he opposed more than minimal government spending and spoke against aid for the railroads, while his constituents hoped for improvements in transportation. After [[Brookins Campbell]] and the Whigs defeated Johnson for re-election in 1837, Johnson would not lose another race for thirty years. In 1839, he sought to regain his seat, initially as a Whig, but when another candidate sought the Whig nomination, he ran as a Democrat and was elected. From that time he supported the Democratic party and built a powerful political machine in Greene County.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=38–42}}{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|pp=39–40}} Johnson became a strong advocate of the Democratic Party, noted for his oratory, and in an era when public speaking both informed the public and entertained it, people flocked to hear him.{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|p=42}}

In 1840, Johnson was selected as a presidential elector for Tennessee, giving him more statewide publicity. Although Democratic President [[Martin Van Buren]] was defeated by former Ohio senator [[William Henry Harrison]], Johnson was instrumental in keeping Tennessee and Greene County in the Democratic column.{{sfn|Trefousse|p=43}} He was elected to the [[Tennessee Senate]] in 1841, where he served a two-year term.&lt;ref name="CongBio"&gt;{{CongBio|J000116|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had achieved financial success in his tailoring business, but sold it to concentrate on politics. He had also acquired additional real estate, including a larger home and a farm (where his mother and stepfather took residence), and among his assets numbered eight or nine slaves.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=45–46}}

=== United States Representative (1843–1853) ===
Having served in both houses of the state legislature, Johnson saw election to Congress as the next step in his political career. He engaged in a number of political maneuvers to gain Democratic support, including the displacement of the Whig postmaster in Greeneville, and defeated [[Jonesborough, Tennessee|Jonesborough]] lawyer John A. Aiken by 5,495 votes to 4,892.{{sfn|Schroeder-Lein|Zuczuk|2001|p=55}}{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=51–53}} In Washington, he joined a new Democratic majority in the House of Representatives. Johnson advocated for the interests of the poor, maintained an anti-[[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] stance, argued for only limited spending by the government and opposed protective tariffs.{{sfn|Trefousse|p=53}} With Eliza remaining in Greeneville, Congressman Johnson shunned social functions in favor of study in the [[Library of Congress]].{{sfn|Trefousse|p=56}} Although a fellow Tennessee Democrat, [[James K. Polk]], [[United States presidential election, 1844|was elected president]] in 1844, and Johnson had campaigned for him, the two men had difficult relations, and President Polk refused some of his patronage suggestions.{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|p=44}}

Johnson believed, as did many Southern Democrats, that the Constitution protected private property, including slaves, and thus prohibited the federal and state governments from abolishing slavery.{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|pp=43–44}} He won a second term in 1845 against [[William Gannaway Brownlow|Wiliam G. Brownlow]], presenting himself as the defender of the poor against the aristocracy. In his second term, Johnson supported the Polk administration's decision to fight the [[Mexican–American War|Mexican War]], seen by some Northerners as an attempt to gain territory to expand slavery westward, and opposed the [[Wilmot Proviso]], a proposal to ban slavery in any territory gained from Mexico. He introduced for the first time his Homestead Bill, to grant {{convert|160|acre}} to people willing to settle the land and gain title to it.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=61–63}}{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|pp=45–46}} This issue was especially important to Johnson because of his own humble beginnings.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=61–63}}{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|pp=47–49}}

In the [[United States presidential election, 1848|presidential election of 1848]], the Democrats split over the slavery issue, and abolitionists formed the [[Free Soil Party]], with former president Van Buren as their nominee. Johnson supported the Democratic candidate, former Michigan senator [[Lewis Cass]]. With the party split, Whig nominee General [[Zachary Taylor]] was easily victorious, and carried Tennessee.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=69–71}} Johnson's relations with Polk remained poor; the President recorded of his final New Year's reception in 1849 that

{{quote|Among the visitors I observed in the crowd today was Hon. Andrew Johnson of the Ho. Repts.

Johnson, due to national interest in new railroad construction and in response to the need for better transportation in his own district, also supported government assistance for the [[East Tennessee, Virginia and Georgia Railway|East Tennessee and Virginia Railroad]].{{sfn|Trefousse|p=73}}

[[File:Andrew-johnson-house-tn1.jpg|thumb|right|The Andrew Johnson House, built in 1851, Greeneville, Tennessee]]
In his campaign for a fourth term, Johnson concentrated on three issues: slavery, homesteads and judicial elections. He defeated his opponent, [[Nathaniel G. Taylor]], in August 1849, with a greater margin of victory than in previous campaigns. When the House convened in December, the party division caused by the Free Soil Party precluded the formation of the majority needed to elect a Speaker. Johnson proposed adoption of a rule allowing election of a Speaker by a plurality; some weeks later others took up a similar proposal, and Democrat [[Howell Cobb]] was elected.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=74–75}}

Once the Speaker election had concluded and Congress was ready to conduct legislative business, the issue of slavery took center stage. Northerners sought to admit California, a free state, to the Union. Kentucky's [[Henry Clay]] introduced in the Senate a series of resolutions, the [[Compromise of 1850]], to admit California and pass legislation sought by each side. Johnson voted for all the provisions except for the abolition of slavery in the nation's capital.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=75–76}} He pressed resolutions for constitutional amendments to provide for popular election of senators (then elected by state legislatures) and of the president (chosen by the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]]), and limiting the tenure of federal judges to 12 years. These were all defeated.{{sfn|Trefousse|p=78}}

A group of Democrats nominated [[Landon Carter Haynes]] to oppose Johnson as he sought a fifth term; the Whigs were so pleased with the internecine battle among the Democrats in the general election that they did not nominate a candidate of their own. The campaign included fierce debates: Johnson's main issue was the passage of the Homestead Bill; Haynes contended it would facilitate abolition. Johnson won the election by more than 1600 votes.{{sfn|Trefousse|p=78}} Though he was not enamored of the party's presidential nominee in 1852, former New Hampshire senator [[Franklin Pierce]], Johnson campaigned for him. Pierce was elected, but he failed to carry Tennessee.{{sfn|Trefousse|p=81}} In 1852, Johnson managed to get the House to pass his Homestead Bill, but it failed in the Senate.{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|p=49}} The Whigs had gained control of the Tennessee legislature, and, under the leadership of [[Gustavus Adolphus Henry, Sr.|Gustavus Henry]], redrew the boundaries of Johnson's First District to make it a safe seat for their party. The ''Nashville Union'' termed this "Henry-mandering";{{efn|Wordplay on [[gerrymandering]].}}{{sfn|Trefousse|p=82}} lamented Johnson, "I have no political future."{{sfn|Castel|p=5}}

=== Governor of Tennessee (1853–1857) ===
[[File:Andrew Johnson by William Brown Cooper.png|thumb|Attribution: [[William Brown Cooper]], Sitter: Andrew Johnson, Date: 1856]]

If Johnson considered retiring from politics upon deciding not to seek re-election, he soon changed his mind.{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|p=51}} His political friends began to maneuver to get him the nomination for governor. The Democratic convention unanimously named him, though some party members were not happy at his selection. The Whigs had won the past two gubernatorial elections, and still controlled the legislature.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=84–85}} That party nominated Henry, making the "Henry-mandering" of the First District an immediate issue.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=84–85}} The two men debated in county seats the length of Tennessee before the meetings were called off two weeks before the August 1853 election due to illness in Henry's family.{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|p=51}}{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=87–88}} Johnson won the election by 63,413 votes to 61,163; some votes for him were cast in return for his promise to support Whig [[Nathaniel Green Taylor|Nathaniel Taylor]] for his old seat in Congress.{{sfn|Trefousse|p=88}}{{sfn|Schroeder-Lein|Zuczuk|2001|p=119}}

Tennessee's governor had little power: Johnson could propose legislation but not veto it, and most appointments were made by the Whig-controlled legislature. Nevertheless, the office was a "[[bully pulpit]]" that allowed him to publicize himself and his political views.{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|pp=52–53}} He succeeded in getting the appointments he wanted in return for his endorsement of [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John Bell]], a Whig, for one of the state's U.S. Senate seats. In his first biennial speech, Johnson urged simplification of the state judicial system, abolition of the Bank of Tennessee, and establishment of an agency to provide uniformity in weights and measures; the last was passed. Johnson was critical of the Tennessee common school system and suggested funding be increased via taxes, either statewide or county by county—a mixture of the two was passed.{{sfn|Trefousse|p=92}} Reforms carried out during Johnson's time as governor included the foundation of the State's public library (making books available to all) and its first public school system, and the initiation of regular state fairs to benefit craftsmen and farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Smalley |first=Ruth |date=2003 |title=An Interview with Andrew Johnson |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P_s3-82-JusC&amp;pg=PA35 |location=Johnson City, TN |publisher=Overmountain Press |page=35 |isbn=978-1-57072-257-8 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180223114014/https://books.google.com/books?id=P_s3-82-JusC&amp;pg=PA35 |archivedate=February 23, 2018 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Whig Party was on its final decline nationally, it remained strong in Tennessee, and the outlook for Democrats there in 1855 was poor. Feeling that re-election as governor was necessary to give him a chance at the higher offices he sought, Johnson agreed to make the run. [[Meredith P. Gentry]] received the Whig nomination. A series of more than a dozen vitriolic debates ensued. The issues in the campaign were slavery, the prohibition of alcohol, and the [[nativism (politics)|nativist]] positions of the [[Know Nothing Party]]. Johnson favored the first, but opposed the others. Gentry was more equivocal on the alcohol question, and had gained the support of the Know Nothings, a group Johnson portrayed as a secret society.{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|pp=55–56}} Johnson was unexpectedly victorious, albeit with a narrower margin than in 1853.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=95–97}}

When the presidential election of 1856 approached, Johnson hoped to be nominated; some Tennessee county conventions designated him a "[[favorite son]]". His position that the best interests of the Union were served by slavery in some areas made him a practical compromise candidate for president. He was never a major contender; the nomination fell to former Pennsylvania senator [[James Buchanan]]. Though he was not impressed by either, Johnson campaigned for Buchanan and his running mate, [[John C. Breckinridge]], who were elected.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=103–104}}

Johnson decided not to seek a third term as governor, with an eye towards election to the U.S. Senate. In 1857, while returning from Washington, his train derailed, causing serious damage to his right arm. This injury would trouble him in the years to come.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=104–105}}

=== United States Senator ===

==== Homestead Bill advocate ====
[[File:Andrew Johnson by Vannerson, 1859.jpg|thumb|Senator Johnson, 1859]]

The victors in the 1857 state legislative campaign would, once they convened in October, elect a United States Senator. Former Whig governor [[William B. Campbell]] wrote to his uncle, "The great anxiety of the Whigs is to elect a majority in the legislature so as to defeat Andrew Johnson for senator. Should the Democrats have the majority, he will certainly be their choice, and there is no man living to whom the Americans{{efn|The Know Nothings, who were then formally known as the American Party.}} and Whigs have as much antipathy as Johnson."{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=105–106}} The governor spoke widely in the campaign, and his party won the gubernatorial race and control of the legislature.{{sfn|Trefousse|p=106}} Johnson's final address as governor gave him the chance to influence his electors, and he made proposals popular among Democrats. Two days later the legislature elected him to the Senate. The opposition was appalled, with the Richmond ''Whig'' newspaper referring to him as "the vilest radical and most unscrupulous demagogue in the Union."{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=105–107}}

Johnson gained high office due to his proven record as a man popular among the small farmers and self-employed tradesmen who made up much of Tennessee's electorate. He called them the "plebeians"; he was less popular among the planters and lawyers who led the state Democratic Party, but none could match him as a vote-getter. After his death, one Tennessee voter wrote of him, "Johnson was always the same to everyone&amp;nbsp;... the honors heaped upon him did not make him forget to be kind to the humblest citizen."{{sfn|Castel|p=4}} Always seen in impeccably tailored clothing, he cut an impressive figure,{{sfn|Trefousse|p=111}} and had the stamina to endure lengthy campaigns with daily travel over bad roads leading to another speech or debate. Mostly denied the party's machinery, he relied on a network of friends, advisers, and contacts.{{sfn|Castel|p=5}} One friend, Hugh Douglas, stated in a letter to him, "you have been in the way of our would be great men for a long time. At heart many of us never wanted you to be Governor only none of the rest of us Could&lt;!-- Capitalization as in original --&gt; have been elected at the time and we only wanted to use you. Then we did not want you to go to the Senate but ''the people would send you''."{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|pp=54–55}}

The new senator took his seat when Congress convened in December 1857 (the term of his predecessor, [[James C. Jones]], had expired in March). He came to Washington as usual without his wife and family; Eliza would visit Washington only once during Johnson's first time as senator, in 1860. Johnson immediately set about introducing the [[Homestead Bill]] in the Senate, but as most senators who supported it were Northern (many associated with the newly founded [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]), the matter became caught up in suspicions over the slavery issue. Southern senators felt that those who took advantage of the provisions of the Homestead Bill were more likely to be Northern non-slaveholders. The issue of slavery had been complicated by the Supreme Court's ruling earlier in the year in ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' that slavery could not be prohibited in the territories. Johnson, a slaveholding senator from a Southern state, made a major speech in the Senate the following May in an attempt to convince his colleagues that the Homestead Bill and slavery were not incompatible. Nevertheless, Southern opposition was key to defeating the legislation, 30–22.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=110–112}}{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|pp=58–59}} In 1859, it failed on a procedural vote when Vice President Breckinridge broke a tie against the bill, and in 1860, a watered-down version passed both houses, only to be vetoed by Buchanan at the urging of Southerners.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=116, 121}} Johnson continued his opposition to spending, chairing a committee to control it.

He argued against funding to build infrastructure in Washington, D.C., stating that it was unfair to expect state citizens to pay for the city's streets, even if it was the seat of government. He opposed spending money for troops to put down [[Utah War|the revolt]] by the Mormons in [[Utah Territory]], arguing for temporary volunteers as the United States should not have a standing army.{{sfn|Trefousse|p=114}}

==== Secession crisis ====
[[File:AndrewJohnson1860.png|thumb|Johnson in 1860]]

In October 1859, abolitionist [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] and sympathizers [[John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry|raided the federal arsenal]] at [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia|Harpers Ferry]], Virginia (today West Virginia). Tensions in Washington between pro- and anti-slavery forces increased greatly. Johnson gave a major speech in the Senate in December, decrying Northerners who would endanger the Union by seeking to outlaw slavery. The Tennessee senator stated that "all men are created equal" from the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] did not apply to African Americans, since the [[Constitution of Illinois]] contained that phrase—and that document barred voting by African Americans.{{sfn|Trefousse|p=119}}{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|p=59}} Johnson, by this time, was a wealthy man who owned a few household slaves,{{sfn|Castel|2002|p=226}} 14 slaves, according to the 1860 Federal Census.&lt;ref&gt;1860 U.S. Federal Census, Slave Schedule for Nashville's 7th ward, Davidson County, Tennessee&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson hoped that he would be a compromise candidate for the presidential nomination as the Democratic Party tore itself apart over the slavery question. Busy with the Homestead Bill during the [[1860 Democratic National Convention]] in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], he sent two of his sons and his chief political adviser to represent his interests in the backroom deal-making. The convention deadlocked, with no candidate able to gain the required two-thirds vote, but the sides were too far apart to consider Johnson as a compromise. The party split, with Northerners backing Illinois Senator [[Stephen Douglas]] while Southerners, including Johnson, supported Vice President Breckinridge for president. With former Tennessee senator [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John Bell]] running a fourth-party candidacy and further dividing the vote, the Republican Party elected its first president, former Illinois representative [[Abraham Lincoln]]. [[United States presidential election, 1860|The election of Lincoln]], known to be against the spread of slavery, was unacceptable to many in the South. Although secession from the Union had not been an issue in the campaign, talk of it began in the Southern states.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=123–127}}{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|pp=60–63}}

Johnson took to the Senate floor after the election, giving a speech well received in the North, "I will not give up this government&amp;nbsp;... No;&lt;!-- punct as in original --&gt; I intend to stand by it&amp;nbsp;... and I invite every man who is a patriot to&amp;nbsp;... rally around the altar of our common country&amp;nbsp;... and swear by our God, and all that is sacred and holy, that the Constitution shall be saved, and the Union preserved."{{sfn|Trefousse|p=131}}{{sfn|Johnson|pp=172–173}} As Southern senators announced they would resign if their states seceded, he reminded Mississippi Senator [[Jefferson Davis]] that if Southerners would only hold to their seats, the Democrats would control the Senate, and could defend the South's interests against any infringement by Lincoln.{{sfn|Trefousse|p=134}} Gordon-Reed points out that while Johnson's belief in an indissoluble Union was sincere, he had alienated Southern leaders, including Davis, who would soon be [[President of the Confederate States of America|the president]] of the [[Confederate States of America]], formed by the seceding states. If the Tennessean had backed the Confederacy, he would have had small influence in its government.{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|p=64}}

Johnson returned home when his state took up the issue of secession. His successor as governor, [[Isham G. Harris]], and the legislature organized a referendum on whether to have a constitutional convention to authorize secession; when that failed, they put the question of leaving the Union to a popular vote. Despite threats on Johnson's life, and actual assaults, he campaigned against both questions, sometimes speaking with a gun on the lectern before him. Although Johnson's [[East Tennessee|eastern region of Tennessee]] was largely against secession, the second referendum passed, and in June 1861, Tennessee joined the Confederacy. Believing he would be killed if he stayed, Johnson fled through the [[Cumberland Gap]], where his party was in fact shot at. He left his wife and family in Greeneville.{{sfn|Castel|p=8}}{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=138–143}}

As the only member from a seceded state to remain in the Senate and the most prominent [[Southern Unionist]], Johnson had Lincoln's ear in the early months of the war.{{sfn|Trefousse|p=143}} With most of Tennessee in Confederate hands, Johnson spent congressional recesses in Kentucky and Ohio, trying in vain to convince any Union commander who would listen to conduct an operation into East Tennessee.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=140–148}}

=== Military Governor of Tennessee ===
{{anchor|General}}&lt;!-- This section is linked to from [[Abraham Lincoln]] --&gt;
Johnson's first tenure in the Senate came to a conclusion in March 1862 when Lincoln appointed him military governor of Tennessee. Much of the central and western portions of that seceded state had been recovered. Although some argued that civil government should simply resume once the Confederates were defeated in an area, Lincoln chose to use his power as commander in chief to appoint military governors over Union-controlled Southern regions.{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|pp=69–70}} The Senate quickly confirmed Johnson's nomination along with the rank of [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]].{{sfn|Trefousse|p=153}} In response, the Confederates confiscated his land and his slaves, and turned his home into a military hospital.{{sfn|Trefousse|p=151}} Later in 1862, after his departure from the Senate and in the absence of most Southern legislators, the [[Homestead Bill]] was finally enacted. Along with legislation for [[land-grant college]]s and for the [[transcontinental railroad]], the Homestead Bill has been credited with opening the American West to settlement.{{sfn|Foner|pp=21, 661}}

As military governor, Johnson sought to eliminate rebel influence in the state. He demanded loyalty oaths from public officials, and shut down all newspapers owned by Confederate sympathizers. Much of eastern Tennessee remained in Confederate hands, and the ebb and flow of war during 1862 sometimes brought Confederate control again close to Nashville. However, the Confederates allowed his wife and family to pass through the lines to join him.{{sfn|Castel|p=9}}{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|pp=71–72}} Johnson undertook the defense of Nashville as well as he could, though the city was continually harassed by cavalry raids led by General [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]]. Relief from Union regulars did not come until [[William S. Rosecrans]] defeated the Confederates at [[Battle of Murfreesboro|Murfreesboro]] in early 1863. Much of eastern Tennessee was captured later that year.{{sfn|Trefousse|p=162}}

When Lincoln issued the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] in January 1863, declaring freedom for all slaves in Confederate-held areas, he exempted Tennessee at Johnson's request. The proclamation increased the debate over what should become of the slaves after the war, as not all Unionists supported abolition. Johnson finally decided that slavery had to end. He wrote, "If the institution of slavery&amp;nbsp;... seeks to overthrow it [the Government], then the Government has a clear right to destroy it."{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|p=72}} He reluctantly supported efforts to enlist former slaves into the Union Army, feeling that African Americans should perform menial tasks to release white Americans to do the fighting.{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|p=73}} Nevertheless, he succeeded in recruiting 20,000 black soldiers to serve the Union.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=168–170}}

== Vice President (1865) ==
{{main|United States presidential election, 1864}}
[[File:Republican presidential ticket 1864b.jpg|thumb|Poster for the Lincoln and Johnson ticket by [[Currier and Ives]]]]

In 1860, Lincoln's running mate had been Maine Senator [[Hannibal Hamlin]]. Vice President Hamlin had served competently, was in good health, and was willing to run again. Nevertheless, Johnson emerged as running mate for Lincoln's re-election bid in 1864.{{sfn|Trefousse|p=177}}

Lincoln considered several [[War Democrat]]s for the ticket in 1864, and sent an agent to sound out General [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Butler]] as a possible running mate. In May 1864, the President dispatched General [[Daniel Sickles]] to Nashville on a fact-finding mission. Although Sickles denied he was there either to investigate or interview the military governor, Johnson biographer Hans L. Trefousse believes Sickles's trip was connected to Johnson's subsequent nomination for vice president.{{sfn|Trefousse|p=177}} According to historian Albert Castel in his account of Johnson's presidency, Lincoln was impressed by Johnson's administration of Tennessee.{{sfn|Castel|p=9}} Gordon-Reed points out that while the Lincoln-Hamlin ticket might have been considered geographically balanced in 1860, "having Johnson, the ''southern'' War Democrat, on the ticket sent the right message about the folly of secession and the continuing capacity for union within the country."{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|p=76}} Another factor was the desire of Secretary of State [[William H. Seward|William Seward]] to frustrate the vice-presidential candidacy of his fellow New Yorker, former senator [[Daniel S. Dickinson]], a War Democrat, as Seward would probably have had to yield his place if another New Yorker became vice president. Johnson, once he was told by reporters the likely purpose of Sickles' visit, was active on his own behalf, giving speeches and having his political friends work behind the scenes to boost his candidacy.{{sfn|Trefousse|p=178}}

To sound a theme of unity, Lincoln in 1864 ran under the banner of the [[National Union Party (United States)|National Union Party]], rather than the Republicans.{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|p=76}} At [[1864 National Union National Convention|the party's convention]] in Baltimore in June, Lincoln was easily nominated, although there had been some talk of replacing him with a Cabinet officer or one of the more successful generals. After the convention backed Lincoln, former Secretary of War [[Simon Cameron]] offered a resolution to nominate Hamlin, but it was defeated. Johnson was nominated for vice president by C.M. Allen of Indiana with an Iowa delegate as seconder. On the first ballot, Johnson led with 200 votes to 150 for Hamlin and 108 for Dickinson. On the second ballot, Kentucky switched to vote for Johnson, beginning a stampede. Johnson was named on the second ballot with 491 votes to Hamlin's 17 and eight for Dickinson; the nomination was made unanimous. Lincoln expressed pleasure at the result, "Andy Johnson, I think, is a good man."{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=178–180}} When word reached Nashville, a crowd assembled and the military governor obliged with a speech contending his selection as a Southerner meant that the rebel states had not actually left the Union.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=178–180}}

[[File:Lincoln and Johnsond.jpg|thumb|left|1865 cartoon showing Lincoln and Johnson using their talents as rail-splitter and tailor to repair the Union]]

Although it was unusual at the time for a national candidate to actively campaign, Johnson gave a number of speeches in Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, and Indiana. He also sought to boost his chances in Tennessee while re-establishing civil government by making the loyalty oath even more restrictive, in that voters would now have to swear they opposed making a settlement with the Confederacy. The Democratic candidate for president, [[George McClellan]], hoped to avoid additional bloodshed by negotiation, and so the stricter loyalty oath effectively disenfranchised his supporters. Lincoln declined to override Johnson, and their ticket took the state by 25,000 votes. Congress refused to count Tennessee's electoral votes, but Lincoln and Johnson did not need them, having won in most states that had voted, and easily secured the election.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=181–185}}

Now Vice President-elect, Johnson was anxious to complete the work of re-establishing civilian government in Tennessee, although the timetable for the election of a new governor did not allow it to take place until after Inauguration Day, March 4. He hoped to remain in Nashville to complete his task, but was told by Lincoln's advisers that he could not stay, but would be sworn in with Lincoln. In these months, Union troops finished the retaking of eastern Tennessee, including Greeneville. Just before his departure, the voters of Tennessee ratified a new constitution, abolishing slavery, on February 22, 1865. One of Johnson's final acts as military governor was to certify the results.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=183–187}}

Johnson traveled to Washington to be sworn in, although according to Gordon-Reed, "in light of what happened on March 4, 1865, it might have been better if Johnson had stayed in Nashville."{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|p=82}} He may have been ill; Castel cited typhoid fever,{{sfn|Castel|p=9}} though Gordon-Reed notes that there is no independent evidence for that diagnosis.{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|p=82}} On the evening of March 3, Johnson attended a party in his honor; he drank heavily. Hung over the following morning at the Capitol, he asked Vice President Hamlin for some whiskey. Hamlin produced a bottle, and Johnson took two stiff drinks, stating "I need all the strength for the occasion I can have." In the Senate Chamber, Johnson delivered a rambling address as Lincoln, the Congress, and dignitaries looked on. Almost incoherent at times, he finally meandered to a halt, whereupon Hamlin hastily swore him in as vice president.{{sfn|Castel|pp=9–10}} Lincoln, who had watched sadly during the debacle, then went to his own swearing-in outside the Capitol, and delivered his acclaimed [[Abraham Lincoln's second inaugural address|Second Inaugural Address]].{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|p=85}}

In the weeks after the inauguration, Johnson only presided over the Senate briefly, and hid from public ridicule at the Maryland home of a friend, [[Francis Preston Blair]]. When he did return to Washington, it was with the intent of leaving for Tennessee to re-establish his family in Greeneville. Instead, he remained after word came that General [[Ulysses S. Grant]] had captured the Confederate capital of [[Richmond, Virginia]], presaging the end of the war.{{sfn|Castel|p=10}} Lincoln stated, in response to criticism of Johnson's behavior, that "I have known Andy Johnson for many years; he made a bad slip the other day, but you need not be scared; Andy ain't a drunkard."{{sfn|Trefousse|p=191}}

On the afternoon of April 14, 1865, Lincoln and Johnson met for the first time since the inauguration. Trefousse states that Johnson wanted to "induce Lincoln not to be too lenient with traitors"; Gordon-Reed agrees.{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|p=87}}{{sfn|Trefousse|p=192}}

That night, President Lincoln was shot and mortally wounded by [[John Wilkes Booth]], a Confederate sympathizer. The shooting of the President was part of a conspiracy to assassinate Lincoln, Johnson, and Seward the same night. Seward barely survived his wounds, while Johnson escaped attack as his would-be assassin, [[George Atzerodt]], got drunk instead of killing the vice president. [[Leonard J. Farwell]], a fellow boarder at the Kirkwood House, awoke Johnson with news of Lincoln's shooting at [[Ford's Theatre]]. Johnson rushed to the President's deathbed, where he remained a short time, on his return promising, "They shall suffer for this. They shall suffer for this."{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=193–194}} Lincoln died at 7:22&amp;nbsp;am the next morning; Johnson's swearing in occurred between 10 and 11&amp;nbsp;am with Chief Justice [[Salmon P. Chase]] presiding in the presence of most of the Cabinet. Johnson's demeanor was described by the newspapers as "solemn and dignified".{{sfn|Trefousse|p=194}} Some Cabinet members had last seen Johnson, apparently drunk, at the inauguration.{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|p=90}} At noon, Johnson conducted his first Cabinet meeting in the Treasury Secretary's office, and asked all members to remain in their positions.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=194–195}}

The events of the assassination resulted in speculation, then and subsequently, concerning Johnson and what the conspirators might have intended for him. In the vain hope of having his life spared after his capture, Atzerodt spoke much about the conspiracy, but did not say anything to indicate that the plotted assassination of Johnson was merely a ruse. Conspiracy theorists point to the fact that on the day of the assassination, Booth came to the Kirkwood House and left one of his cards. This object was received by Johnson's private secretary, William A. Browning, with an inscription, "Don't wish to disturb you.  Are you at home? J. Wilkes Booth."{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|pp=90–92}}

Johnson presided with dignity over Lincoln's funeral ceremonies in Washington, before his predecessor's body was sent home to [[Springfield, Illinois]], for interment.{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|p=93}} Shortly after Lincoln's death, Union General [[William Tecumseh Sherman|William T. Sherman]] reported he had, without consulting Washington, reached an armistice agreement with Confederate General [[Joseph E. Johnston]] for the surrender of Confederate forces in North Carolina in exchange for the existing state government remaining in power, with private property rights to be respected. This did not even acknowledge the freedom of those in slavery. This was not acceptable to Johnson or the Cabinet who sent word for Sherman to secure the surrender without making political deals, which he did. Further, Johnson placed a $100,000 bounty (equivalent to ${{Format price|{{Inflation|US|100000|1865}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}) on Confederate President Davis, then a fugitive, which gave him the reputation of a man who would be tough on the South. More controversially, he permitted the execution of [[Mary Surratt]] for her part in Lincoln's assassination. Surratt was executed with three others, including Atzerodt, on July 7, 1865.{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|pp=93–95}}

=== Reconstruction ===
{{Main|Reconstruction Era}}

==== Background ====
Upon taking office, Johnson faced the question of what to do with the Confederacy. President Lincoln had authorized loyalist governments in Virginia, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Tennessee as the Union came to control large parts of those states and advocated a [[ten percent plan]] that would allow elections after ten percent of the voters in any state took an oath of future loyalty to the Union. Congress considered this too lenient; [[Wade–Davis Bill|its own plan]], requiring a majority of voters to take the loyalty oath, passed both houses in 1864, but Lincoln [[pocket veto]]ed it.{{sfn|Fitzgerald|p=26}}

Johnson had three goals in Reconstruction. He sought a speedy restoration of the states, on the grounds that they had never truly left the Union, and thus should again be recognized once loyal citizens formed a government. To Johnson, African-American suffrage was a delay and a distraction; it had always been a state responsibility to decide who should vote. Second, political power in the Southern states should pass from the planter class to his beloved "plebeians". Johnson feared that the freedmen, many of whom were still economically bound to their former masters, might vote at their direction. Johnson's third priority was election in his own right in 1868,  a feat no one who had succeeded a deceased president had managed to accomplish, attempting to secure a Democratic anti-Congressional Reconstruction coalition in the South.{{sfn|Castel|pp=28–29}}

The Republicans had formed a number of factions. The [[Radical Republican]]s sought voting and other civil rights for African Americans. They believed that the freedmen could be induced to vote Republican in gratitude for emancipation, and that black votes could keep the Republicans in power and Southern Democrats, including former rebels, out of influence. They believed that top Confederates should be punished. The Moderate Republicans sought to keep the Democrats out of power at a national level, and prevent former rebels from resuming power. They were not as enthusiastic about the idea of African-American suffrage as their Radical colleagues, either because of their own local political concerns, or because they believed that the freedman would be likely to cast his vote badly. Northern Democrats favored the unconditional restoration of the Southern states. They did not support African-American suffrage, which might threaten Democratic control in the South.{{sfn|Castel|pp=18–21}}

==== Presidential Reconstruction ====
Johnson was initially left to devise a Reconstruction policy without legislative intervention, as Congress was not due to meet again until December 1865.{{sfn|Fitzgerald|p=28}} Radical Republicans told the President that the Southern states were economically in a state of chaos and urged him to use his leverage to insist on rights for freedmen as a condition of restoration to the Union. But Johnson, with the support of other officials including Seward, insisted that the franchise was a state, not a federal matter. The Cabinet was divided on the issue.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=215–216, 234–235}}

Johnson's first Reconstruction actions were two proclamations, with the unanimous backing of his Cabinet, on May 29. One recognized the Virginia government led by provisional Governor [[Francis Pierpont]]. The second provided amnesty for all ex-rebels except those holding property valued at $20,000 or more; it also appointed a temporary governor for North Carolina and authorized elections. Neither of these proclamations included provisions regarding [[black suffrage]] or freedmen's rights. The President ordered constitutional conventions in other former rebel states.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=216–217}}

As Southern states began the process of forming governments, Johnson's policies received considerable public support in the North, which he took as unconditional backing for quick reinstatement of the South. While he received such support from the white South, he underestimated the determination of Northerners to ensure that the war had not been fought for nothing. It was important, in Northern public opinion, that the South acknowledge its defeat, that slavery be ended, and that the lot of African Americans be improved. Voting rights were less important—after all, only a handful of Northern states (mostly in New England) gave African-American men the right to vote on the same basis as whites, and in late 1865, Connecticut, Wisconsin, and Minnesota voted down African-American suffrage proposals by large margins. Northern public opinion tolerated Johnson's inaction on black suffrage as an experiment, to be allowed if it quickened Southern acceptance of defeat. Instead, white Southerners felt emboldened. A number of Southern states passed [[Black Codes (United States)|Black Codes]], binding African-American laborers to farms on annual contracts they could not quit, and allowing law enforcement at whim to arrest them for vagrancy and rent out their labor. Most Southerners elected to Congress were former Confederates, with the most prominent being Georgia Senator-designate and former Confederate vice president [[Alexander Stephens]]. Congress assembled in early December 1865; Johnson's conciliatory [[State of the Union|annual message]] to them was well received. Nevertheless, Congress refused to seat the Southern legislators and established a committee to recommend appropriate Reconstruction legislation.{{sfn|Castel|pp=50–59}}

Northerners were outraged at the idea of unrepentant Confederate leaders, such as Stephens, rejoining the federal government at a time when emotional wounds from the war remained raw. They saw the Black Codes placing African Americans in a position barely above slavery. Republicans also feared that restoration of the Southern states would return the Democrats to power.{{sfn|Fitzgerald|p=35}}{{sfn|Castel|pp=58–59}} In addition, according to [[David O. Stewart]] in his book on Johnson's impeachment, "the violence and poverty that oppressed the South would galvanize the opposition to Johnson".{{sfn|Stewart|p=26}}

==== Break with the Republicans: 1866 ====
Congress was reluctant to confront the President, and initially only sought to fine-tune Johnson's policies towards the South.{{sfn|Fitzgerald|p=36}} According to Trefousse, "If there was a time when Johnson could have come to an agreement with the moderates of the Republican Party, it was the period following the return of Congress".{{sfn|Trefousse|p=240}} The President was unhappy about the provocative actions of the Southern states, and about the continued control by the antebellum elite there, but made no statement publicly, believing that Southerners had a right to act as they did, even if it was unwise to do so. By late January 1866, he was convinced that winning a showdown with the Radical Republicans was necessary to his political plans – both for the success of Reconstruction and for re-election in 1868. He would have preferred that the conflict arise over the legislative efforts to enfranchise African Americans in the District of Columbia, a proposal that had been defeated overwhelmingly in an all-white referendum. A bill to accomplish this passed the House of Representatives, but to Johnson's disappointment, stalled in the Senate before he could veto it.{{sfn|Castel|pp=62–68}}

[[File:Nast on Andrew Johnson.jpg|thumb|[[Thomas Nast]] cartoon of Johnson disposing of the [[Freedmen's Bureau]] as African Americans go flying]]

Illinois Senator [[Lyman Trumbull]], leader of the Moderate Republicans and Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, was anxious to reach an understanding with the President. He ushered through Congress a bill extending the [[Freedmen's Bureau]] beyond its scheduled abolition in 1867, and the first Civil Rights Bill, to grant citizenship to the freedmen. Trumbull met several times with Johnson, and was convinced the President would sign the measures (Johnson rarely contradicted visitors, often fooling those who met with him into thinking he was in accord). In fact, the President opposed both bills as infringements on state sovereignty. Additionally, both of Trumbull's bills were unpopular among white Southerners, whom Johnson hoped to include in his new party. Johnson vetoed the Freedman's Bureau bill on February 18, 1866, to the delight of white Southerners and the puzzled anger of Republican legislators. He considered himself vindicated when a move to override his veto failed in the Senate the following day.{{sfn|Castel|pp=62–68}} Johnson believed that the Radicals would now be isolated and defeated, and that the Moderate Republicans would form behind him; he did not understand that Moderates too wanted to see African Americans treated fairly.{{sfn|Foner|pp=248–249}}

On February 22, 1866, [[Washington's Birthday]], Johnson gave an impromptu speech to supporters who had marched to the [[White House]] and called for an address in honor of [[George Washington|the first president]]. In his hour-long speech, he instead referred to himself over 200 times. More damagingly, he also spoke of "men&amp;nbsp;... still opposed to the Union" to whom he could not extend the hand of friendship he gave to the South.{{sfn|Stewart|pp=51–52}}{{sfn|Foner|p=249}} When called upon by the crowd to say who they were, Johnson named Pennsylvania Congressman [[Thaddeus Stevens]], Massachusetts Senator [[Charles Sumner]], and abolitionist [[Wendell Phillips]], and accused them of plotting his assassination. Republicans viewed the address as a declaration of war, while one Democratic ally estimated Johnson's speech cost the party 200,000 votes in the 1866 congressional midterm elections.{{sfn|Stewart|pp=51–53}}

Although strongly urged by Moderates to sign the [[Civil Rights Act of 1866|Civil Rights Bill]], Johnson broke decisively with them by vetoing it on March 27. In his veto message, he objected to the measure because it conferred citizenship on the freedmen at a time when 11 out of 36 states were unrepresented in the Congress, and that it discriminated in favor of African Americans and against whites.{{sfn|Foner|pp=250–251}}{{sfn|Castel|p=70}} Within three weeks, Congress had overridden his veto, the first time that had been done on a major bill in American history.{{sfn|Castel|p=71}} The veto of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1866]], often seen as a key mistake of Johnson's presidency, convinced Moderates there was no hope of working with him. Historian [[Eric Foner]] in his volume on Reconstruction views it as "the most disastrous miscalculation of his political career". According to Stewart, the veto was "for many his defining blunder, setting a tone of perpetual confrontation with Congress that prevailed for the rest of his presidency".{{sfn|Stewart|p=53}}

Congress also proposed the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] to the states. Written by Trumbull and others, it was sent for ratification by state legislatures in a process in which the president plays no part, though Johnson opposed it. The amendment was designed to put the key provisions of the Civil Rights Act into the Constitution, but also went further. The amendment extended citizenship to every person born in the United States (except Indians on reservations), penalized states that did not give the vote to freedmen, and most importantly, created new federal civil rights that could be protected by federal courts. It also guaranteed that the federal debt would be paid and forbade repayment of Confederate war debts. Further, it disqualified many former Confederates from office, although the disability could be removed—by Congress, not the president.{{sfn|Trefousse|p=252}} Both houses passed the Freedmen's Bureau Act a second time, and again the President vetoed it; this time, the veto was overridden. By the summer of 1866, when Congress finally adjourned, Johnson's method of restoring states to the Union by executive fiat, without safeguards for the freedmen, was in deep trouble. His home state of Tennessee ratified the Fourteenth Amendment despite the President's opposition.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=253–254}} When Tennessee did so, Congress immediately seated its proposed delegation, embarrassing Johnson.{{sfn|Castel|pp=75–76}}

Efforts to compromise failed,{{sfn|Stewart|pp=57–58}} and a political war ensued between the united Republicans on one side, and on the other, Johnson and his allies in the Democratic Party, North and South. He called a convention of the National Union Party. Republicans had returned to using their previous identifier; Johnson intended to use the discarded name to unite his supporters and gain election to a full term, in 1868.{{sfn|Stewart|pp=60–62}} The battleground was the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1866|election of 1866]]; Southern states were not allowed to vote. Johnson campaigned vigorously, undertaking a public speaking tour, known as the "[[Swing Around the Circle]]". The trip, including speeches in Chicago, St. Louis, Indianapolis and Columbus, proved politically disastrous, with the President making controversial comparisons between himself and Christ, and engaging in arguments with hecklers. These exchanges were attacked as beneath the dignity of the presidency. The Republicans won by a landslide, increasing their two-thirds majority in Congress, and made plans to control Reconstruction.{{sfn|Trefousse|p=271}} Johnson blamed the Democrats for giving only lukewarm support to the National Union movement.{{sfn|Castel|pp=88–89}}

==== Radical Reconstruction ====
Even with the Republican victory in November 1866, Johnson considered himself in a strong position. The [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] had been ratified by none of the Southern or [[Border states (American Civil War)|border states]] except Tennessee, and had been rejected in Kentucky, Delaware, and Maryland. As the amendment required ratification by three-quarters of the states to become part of the Constitution, he believed the deadlock would be broken in his favor, leading to his election in 1868. Once it reconvened in December 1866, an energized Congress began passing legislation, often over a presidential veto; this included the District of Columbia voting bill. Congress admitted Nebraska to the Union over a veto, and the Republicans gained two senators and a state that promptly ratified the amendment. Johnson's veto of a bill for statehood for [[Colorado Territory]] was sustained; enough senators agreed that a district with a population of 30,000 was not yet worthy of statehood to win the day.{{sfn|Castel|pp=107–109}}

In January 1867, Congressman Stevens introduced legislation to dissolve the Southern state governments and reconstitute them into five military districts, under [[martial law]]. The states would begin again by holding constitutional conventions. African Americans could vote for or become delegates; former Confederates could not. In the legislative process, Congress added to the bill that restoration to the Union would follow the state's ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment, and completion of the process of adding it to the Constitution. Johnson and the Southerners attempted a compromise, whereby the South would agree to a modified version of the amendment without the disqualification of former Confederates, and for limited black suffrage. The Republicans insisted on the full language of the amendment, and the deal fell through. Although Johnson could have pocket vetoed the [[Reconstruction Acts|First Reconstruction Act]] as it was presented to him less than ten days before the end of the Thirty-Ninth Congress, he chose to veto it directly on March 2, 1867; Congress overruled him the same day. Also on March 2, Congress passed the [[Tenure of Office Act (1867)|Tenure of Office Act]] over the President's veto, in response to statements during the Swing Around the Circle that he planned to fire Cabinet secretaries who did not agree with him. This bill, requiring Senate approval for the firing of Cabinet members during the tenure of the president who appointed them and for one month afterwards, was immediately controversial, with some senators doubting that it was constitutional or that its terms applied to Johnson, whose key Cabinet officers were Lincoln holdovers.{{sfn|Castel|pp=107–109}}

=== Impeachment ===
{{Main|Impeachment of Andrew Johnson}}
[[File:The situation.jpg|thumb|"The Situation", a ''Harper's Weekly'' editorial cartoon, shows Secretary of War Stanton aiming a cannon labeled "Congress" to defeat Johnson. The rammer is "Tenure of Office Bill" and cannonballs on the floor are "Justice".]]

Secretary of War [[Edwin Stanton]] was an able and hard-working man, but difficult to deal with.{{sfn|Stewart|pp=62–64}} Johnson both admired and was exasperated by his War Secretary, who, in combination with [[General of the Army (United States)|General of the Army]] Grant, worked to undermine the president's Southern policy from within his own administration. Johnson considered firing Stanton, but respected him for his wartime service as secretary. Stanton, for his part, feared allowing Johnson to appoint his successor and refused to resign, despite his public disagreements with his president.{{sfn|Stewart|pp=64–66}}

The new Congress met for a few weeks in March 1867, then adjourned, leaving the House Committee on the Judiciary behind, charged with reporting back to the full House whether there were grounds for Johnson to be impeached. This committee duly met, examined the President's bank accounts, and summoned members of the Cabinet to testify. When a federal court released former Confederate president Davis on bail on May 13 (he had been captured shortly after the war), the committee investigated whether the President had impeded the prosecution. It learned that Johnson was eager to have Davis tried. A bipartisan majority of the committee voted down impeachment charges; the committee adjourned on June 3.{{sfn|Castel|pp=126–127}}

Later in June, Johnson and Stanton battled over the question of whether the military officers placed in command of the South could override the civil authorities. The President had Attorney General [[Henry Stanbery]] issue an opinion backing his position that they could not. Johnson sought to pin down Stanton either as for, and thus endorsing Johnson's position, or against, showing himself to be opposed to his president and the rest of the Cabinet. Stanton evaded the point in meetings and written communications. When Congress reconvened in July, it passed a Reconstruction Act against Johnson's position, waited for his veto, overruled it, and went home. In addition to clarifying the powers of the generals, the legislation also deprived the President of control over the Army in the South. With Congress in recess until November, Johnson decided to fire Stanton and relieve one of the military commanders, General [[Philip Sheridan]], who had dismissed the governor of Texas and installed a replacement with little popular support. Johnson was initially deterred by a strong objection from Grant, but on August 5, the President demanded Stanton's resignation; the secretary refused to quit with Congress out of session.{{sfn|Castel|pp=128–135}} Johnson then suspended him pending the next meeting of Congress as permitted under the Tenure of Office Act; Grant agreed to serve as temporary replacement while continuing to lead the Army.{{sfn|Castel|pp=135–137}}

Grant, under protest, followed Johnson's order transferring Sheridan and another of the district commanders, [[Daniel Sickles]], who had angered Johnson by firmly following Congress's plan. The President also issued a proclamation pardoning most Confederates, exempting those who held office under the Confederacy, or who had served in federal office before the war and had breached their oaths. Although Republicans expressed anger with his actions, the 1867 elections generally went Democratic. No seats in Congress were directly elected in the polling, but the Democrats took control of the [[Ohio General Assembly]], allowing them to defeat for re-election one of Johnson's strongest opponents, Senator [[Benjamin Wade]]. Voters in Ohio, Connecticut, and Minnesota turned down propositions to grant African Americans the vote.{{sfn|Stewart|pp=95–97}}

The adverse results momentarily put a stop to Republican calls to impeach Johnson, who was elated by the elections.{{sfn|Castel|p=146}} Nevertheless, once Congress met in November, the Judiciary Committee reversed itself and passed a resolution of impeachment against Johnson. After much debate about whether anything the President had done was a high crime or misdemeanor, the standard under the Constitution, the resolution was defeated by the House of Representatives on December 7, 1867, by a vote of 57 in favor to 108 opposed.{{sfn|Stewart|pp=109–111}}

Johnson notified Congress of Stanton's suspension and Grant's interim appointment. In January 1868, the Senate disapproved of his action, and reinstated Stanton, contending the President had violated the Tenure of Office Act. Grant stepped aside over Johnson's objection, causing a complete break between them. Johnson then dismissed Stanton and appointed [[Lorenzo Thomas]] to replace him. Stanton refused to leave his office, and on February 24, 1868, the House impeached the President for intentionally violating the Tenure of Office Act, by a vote of 128 to 47. The House subsequently adopted eleven articles of impeachment, for the most part alleging that he had violated the Tenure of Office Act, and had questioned the legitimacy of Congress.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=313–316}}

[[File:Andew Johnson impeachment trial.jpg|thumb|left|Illustration of Johnson's impeachment trial in the [[United States Senate]], by [[Theodore R. Davis]], published in ''Harper's Weekly'']]

On March 5, 1868, the impeachment trial began in the Senate and lasted almost three months; Congressmen [[George S. Boutwell]], Benjamin Butler and Thaddeus Stevens acted as managers for the House, or prosecutors, and [[William M. Evarts]], [[Benjamin R. Curtis]] and former Attorney General Stanbery were Johnson's counsel; Chief Justice Chase served as presiding judge.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=316, 336}}

The defense relied on the provision of the Tenure of Office Act that made it applicable only to appointees of the current administration. Since Lincoln had appointed Stanton, the defense maintained Johnson had not violated the act, and also argued that the President had the right to test the constitutionality of an act of Congress.{{sfn|Trefousse|p=319}} Johnson's counsel insisted that he make no appearance at the trial, nor publicly comment about the proceedings, and except for a pair of interviews in April, he complied.{{sfn|Castel|p=81}}

Johnson maneuvered to gain an acquittal; for example, he pledged to Iowa Senator [[James W. Grimes]] that he would not interfere with Congress's Reconstruction efforts. Grimes reported to a group of Moderates, many of whom voted for acquittal, that he believed the President would keep his word. Johnson also promised to install the respected [[John Schofield]] as War Secretary. {{sfn|Gordon-Reed|pp=138–139}} Kansas Senator [[Edmund G. Ross]] received assurances that the new, Radical-influenced constitutions ratified in South Carolina and Arkansas would be transmitted to the Congress without delay, an action which would give him and other senators political cover to vote for acquittal.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=323–324}}

One reason senators were reluctant to remove the President was that his successor would have been Ohio Senator Wade, the [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|president ''pro tempore'']] of the Senate. Wade, a [[lame duck (politics)|lame duck]] who left office in early 1869, was a Radical who supported such measures as women's suffrage, placing him beyond the pale politically in much of the nation.{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|p=139}}{{sfn|Stewart|p=307}} Additionally, a President Wade was seen as an obstacle to Grant's ambitions.{{sfn|Trefousse|p=330}}

With the dealmaking, Johnson was confident of the result in advance of the verdict, and in the days leading up to the ballot, newspapers reported that Stevens and his Radicals had given up. On May 16, the Senate voted on the 11th article of impeachment, accusing Johnson of firing Stanton in violation of the Tenure of Office of Act once the Senate had overturned his suspension. Thirty-five senators voted "guilty" and 19 "not guilty", thus falling short by a single vote of the two-thirds majority required for conviction under the Constitution. Seven Republicans—Senators Grimes, Ross, Trumbull, [[William Pitt Fessenden]], [[Joseph S. Fowler]], [[John B. Henderson]], and [[Peter G. Van Winkle]]—voted to acquit the President. With Stevens bitterly disappointed at the result, the Senate then adjourned for the [[1868 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]]; Grant was nominated for president. The Senate returned on May 26 and voted on the second and third articles, with identical 35–19 results. Faced with those results, Johnson's opponents gave up and dismissed proceedings.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=323–328}}{{sfn|Stewart|pp=340–341}} Stanton "relinquished" his office on May 26, and the Senate subsequently confirmed Schofield.{{sfn|Castel|p=195}} When Johnson renominated Stanbery to return to his position as Attorney General after his service as a defense manager, the Senate refused to confirm him.{{sfn|Trefousse|p=336}}

Allegations were made at the time and again later that bribery dictated the outcome of the trial. Even when it was in progress, Representative Butler began an investigation, held contentious hearings, and issued a report, unendorsed by any other congressman. Butler focused on a New York–based "Astor House Group", supposedly led by [[political boss]] and editor [[Thurlow Weed]]. This organization was said to have raised large sums of money from whiskey interests through Cincinnati lawyer Charles Woolley to bribe senators to acquit Johnson. Butler went so far as to imprison Woolley in the Capitol building &lt;!-- a committee room and then an artist's studio --&gt; when he refused to answer questions, but failed to prove bribery.{{sfn|Stewart|pp=240–247, 284–292}}

=== Foreign policy ===
Soon after taking office as president, Johnson reached an accord with Secretary of State [[William H. Seward]] that there would be no change in foreign policy. In practice, this meant that Seward would continue to run things as he had under Lincoln. Seward and Lincoln had been rivals for the nomination in 1860; the victor hoped that Seward would succeed him as president in 1869. At the time of Johnson's accession, [[French intervention in Mexico|the French had intervened in Mexico]], sending troops there. While many politicians had indulged in saber rattling over the Mexican matter, Seward preferred quiet diplomacy, warning the French through diplomatic channels that their presence in Mexico was not acceptable. Although the President preferred a more aggressive approach, Seward persuaded him to follow his lead. In April 1866, the French government informed Seward that its troops would be brought home in stages, to conclude by November 1867.{{sfn|Castel|pp=40–41}}

Seward was an expansionist, and sought opportunities to gain territory for the United States. By 1867, the Russian government saw its [[Russian America|North American colony]] (today Alaska) as a financial liability, and feared losing control as American settlement reached there. It instructed its minister in Washington, Baron [[Eduard de Stoeckl]], to negotiate a sale. De Stoeckl did so deftly, getting Seward to raise his offer from $5 million (coincidentally, the minimum that Russia had instructed de Stoeckl to accept) to $7 million, and then getting $200,000 added by raising various objections.{{sfn|Castel|p=120}} This sum of $7.2 million is equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|7200000|1867}}}} in present-day terms.{{inflation-fn|US}} On March 30, 1867, de Stoeckl and Seward signed the treaty, working quickly as the Senate was about to adjourn. Johnson and Seward took the signed document to the President's Room in the Capitol, only to be told there was no time to deal with the matter before adjournment. The President summoned the Senate into session to meet on April 1; that body approved the treaty, 37–2.{{sfn|Castel|pp=120–122}} Emboldened by his success in Alaska, Seward sought acquisitions elsewhere. His only success was staking an American claim to uninhabited [[Wake Island]] in the Pacific, which would be officially claimed by the U.S. [[William McKinley#Peace and territorial gain|in 1898]]. He came close with the [[Danish West Indies]] as Denmark agreed to sell and the local population approved the transfer in a plebiscite, but the Senate never voted on the treaty and it expired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David M. Pletcher|title=The Diplomacy of Trade and Investment: American Economic Expansion in the Hemisphere, 1865–1900|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lPIB100VVuoC&amp;pg=PA160|year=1998|publisher=University of Missouri Press|page=160|isbn=9780826211279|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915151030/https://books.google.com/books?id=lPIB100VVuoC&amp;pg=PA160|archivedate=September 15, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another treaty that fared badly was the Johnson-Clarendon convention, negotiated in settlement of the [[Alabama Claims|''Alabama'' Claims]], for damages to American shipping from British-built Confederate raiders. Negotiated by the [[United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom|United States Minister to Britain]], former Maryland senator [[Reverdy Johnson]], in late 1868, it was ignored by the Senate during the remainder of the President's term. The treaty was rejected after he left office, and the Grant administration later negotiated considerably better terms from Britain.{{sfn|Castel|pp=204–205}}{{sfn|Trefousse|p=349}}

==== Judicial appointments ====
{{Main|List of federal judges appointed by Andrew Johnson}}
Johnson appointed nine Article III federal judges during his presidency, all to [[United States district court]]s; he did not appoint a justice to serve on the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]. In April 1866, he nominated [[Henry Stanbery]] to fill the vacancy left with the death of [[John Catron]], but Congress eliminated the seat to prevent the appointment, and to ensure that he did not get to make any appointments eliminated the next vacancy as well, providing that the court would shrink by one justice when one next departed from office.{{sfn|Stewart|p=54}} Johnson appointed his Greeneville crony, [[Samuel Milligan]], to the [[United States Court of Claims]], where he served from 1868 until his death in 1874.{{sfn|Trefousse|p=363}}{{sfn|Federal Judiciary Center}}

=== Reforms initiated ===
In June 1866, Johnson signed the Southern Homestead Act into law, believing that the legislation would assist poor whites. Around 28,000 land claims were successfully patented, although few former slaves benefitted from the law, fraud was rampant, and much of the best land was off-limits; reserved for grants to veterans or railroads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QA3hdQzOVC4C&amp;pg=PA595|title=Encyclopedia of the Reconstruction Era: M–Z and primary documents|publisher=|accessdate=April 6, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180223114014/https://books.google.com/books?id=QA3hdQzOVC4C&amp;pg=PA595|archivedate=February 23, 2018|df=mdy-all|isbn=9780313330759|last1=Zuczek|first1=Richard|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1868, Johnson signed an eight-hour law passed by Congress that established an eight-hour workday for laborers and mechanics employed by the Federal Government.&lt;ref name="google.co.uk"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dqIBqiNoB9wC&amp;pg=PA65|title=Civil War America, 1850 To 1875|publisher=|accessdate=April 6, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160515231534/https://books.google.com/books?id=dqIBqiNoB9wC&amp;pg=PA65|archivedate=May 15, 2016|df=mdy-all|isbn=9781438107974|last1=Selcer|first1=Richard F.|date=2014-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Johnson told members of a Workingmen's party delegation in Baltimore that he could not directly commit himself to an eight-hour day, he nevertheless told the same delegation that he greatly favoured the "shortest number of hours consistent with the interests of all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P_s3-82-JusC&amp;pg=PA80&amp;dq=andrew+johnson+eight-hour+day|title=An Interview with Andrew Johnson|publisher=|accessdate=April 6, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180223114014/https://books.google.com/books?id=P_s3-82-JusC&amp;pg=PA80&amp;dq=andrew+johnson+eight-hour+day|archivedate=February 23, 2018|df=mdy-all|isbn=9781570722578|last1=Smalley|first1=Ruth|date=April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Richard F. Selcer, however, the good intentions behind the law were "immediately frustrated" as wages were cut by 20%.&lt;ref name="google.co.uk"/&gt;

=== Completion of term ===
Johnson sought nomination by the [[1868 Democratic National Convention]] in New York in July 1868. He remained very popular among Southern whites, and boosted that popularity by issuing, just before the convention, a pardon ending the possibility of criminal proceedings against any Confederate not already indicted, meaning that only Davis and a few others still might face trial. On the first ballot, Johnson was second to former Ohio representative [[George H. Pendleton]], who had been his Democratic opponent for vice president in 1864. Johnson's support was mostly from the South, and fell away as the ballots passed. On the 22nd ballot, former New York governor [[Horatio Seymour]] was nominated, and the President received only four votes, all from Tennessee.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=337–339}}

[[File:Andrew Johnson, Farewell to all my greatness cph.3a03724.jpg|thumb|left|"Farewell to all my greatness": ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' cartoon mocking Johnson on leaving office]]

The conflict with Congress continued. Johnson sent Congress proposals for amendments to limit the president to a single six-year term and make the president and the Senate directly elected, and for term limits for judges. Congress took no action on them. When the President was slow to officially report ratifications of the Fourteenth Amendment by the new Southern legislatures, Congress passed a bill, again over his veto, requiring him to do so within ten days of receipt. He still delayed as much as he could, but was required, in July 1868, to report the ratifications making the amendment part of the Constitution.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=340–343}}

Seymour's operatives sought Johnson's support, but he long remained silent on the presidential campaign. It was not until October, with the vote already having taken place in some states, that he mentioned Seymour at all, and he never endorsed him. Nevertheless, Johnson regretted Grant's victory, in part because of their animus from the Stanton affair. In his annual message to Congress in December, Johnson urged the repeal of the Tenure of Office Act and told legislators that had they admitted their Southern colleagues in 1865, all would have been well. He celebrated his 60th birthday in late December with a party for several hundred children, though not including those of [[President-elect of the United States|President-elect]] Grant, who did not allow his to go.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=345–347}}

On Christmas Day 1868, Johnson issued a final amnesty, this one covering everyone, including Davis. He also issued, in his final months in office, pardons for crimes, including one for Dr. [[Samuel Mudd]], controversially convicted of involvement in the Lincoln assassination (he had set Booth's broken leg) and imprisoned in [[Fort Jefferson, Florida#Active use: 1860s–1930s|Fort Jefferson]] on Florida's [[Dry Tortugas]].{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=345–347}}

On March 3, the President hosted a large public reception at the White House on his final full day in office. Grant had made it known that he was unwilling to ride in the same carriage as Johnson, as was customary, and Johnson refused to go to the inauguration at all. Despite an effort by Seward to prompt a change of mind, he spent the morning of March 4 finishing last-minute business, and then shortly after noon rode from the White House to the home of a friend.{{sfn|Castel|pp=211–212}}{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=350–351}}

== Post-presidency and return to Senate ==
[[File:Andrew Johnson, 1875.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Senator Andrew Johnson in 1875 (age 66)]]

After leaving the presidency, Johnson remained for some weeks in Washington, then returned to Greeneville for the first time in eight years. He was honored with large public celebrations along the way, especially in Tennessee, where cities hostile to him during the war hung out welcome banners. He had arranged to purchase a large farm near Greeneville to live on after his presidency.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=348, 353–354}}

Some expected Johnson to run for Governor of Tennessee or for the Senate again, while others that he would become a railroad executive.{{sfn|Trefousse|p=349}} Johnson found Greeneville boring, and his private life was embittered by the suicide of his son Robert in 1869.{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|p=142}} Seeking vindication for himself, and revenge against his political enemies, he launched a Senate bid soon after returning home. Tennessee had gone Republican, but court rulings restoring the vote to some whites and the violence of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] kept down the African-American vote, leading to a Democratic victory in the legislative elections in August 1869. Johnson was seen as a likely victor in the Senate election, although hated by Radical Republicans, and also by some Democrats because of his wartime activities. Although he was at one point within a single vote of victory in the legislature's balloting, the Republicans eventually elected [[Henry Cooper (U.S. Senator)|Henry Cooper]] over Johnson, 54–51.{{sfn|Castel|pp=214–215}} In 1872, there was a special election for an [[Tennessee's at-large congressional district#1873 – 1875: One at-large seat, among nine other districts|at-large congressional seat for Tennessee]]; Johnson initially sought the Democratic nomination, but when he saw that it would go to former Confederate general [[Benjamin F. Cheatham]], decided to run as an independent. The former president was defeated, finishing third, but the split in the Democratic Party defeated Cheatham in favor of an old Johnson Unionist ally, [[Horace Maynard]].{{sfn|Castel|p=215}}

In 1873, Johnson contracted [[cholera]] during an epidemic but recovered; that year he lost about $73,000, when the First National Bank of Washington went under, though he was eventually repaid much of the sum.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=364–366}} He began looking towards the next Senate election, to take place in the legislature in early 1875. Johnson began to woo the farmers' [[The National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry|Grange movement]]; with his [[Jeffersonian democracy|Jeffersonian leanings]], he easily gained their support. He spoke throughout the state in his final campaign tour. Few African Americans outside the large towns were now able to vote as Reconstruction faded in Tennessee, setting a pattern that would be repeated in the other Southern states; the white domination would last almost a century. In the Tennessee legislative elections in August, the Democrats elected 92 legislators to the Republicans' eight, and Johnson went to Nashville for the legislative session. When the balloting for the Senate seat began on January 20, 1875, he led with 30 votes, but did not have the required majority as three former Confederate generals, one former colonel, and a former Democratic congressman split the vote with him. Johnson's opponents tried to agree on a single candidate who might gain majority support and defeat him, but failed, and he was elected on January 26 on the 54th ballot, with a margin of a single vote. Nashville erupted in rejoicing;{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=334, 370–371}}{{sfn|Castel|p=216}} remarked Johnson, "Thank God for the vindication."{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|p=142}}

Johnson's comeback garnered national attention, with the ''St. Louis Republican'' calling it, "the most magnificent personal triumph which the history of American politics can show".{{sfn|Castel|p=216}} At his swearing-in in the Senate on March 5, 1875, he was greeted with flowers and sworn in with his predecessor as vice president, Hamlin, by that office's current incumbent, [[Henry Wilson]], who as senator had voted for his ousting. Many Republicans ignored Senator Johnson, though some, such as Ohio's [[John Sherman]] (who had voted for conviction), shook his hand. Johnson remains the only former president to serve in the Senate. He spoke only once in the short session, on March 22 lambasting President Grant for his use of federal troops in support of Louisiana's Reconstruction government. The former president asked, "How far off is military despotism?" and concluded his speech, "may God bless this people and God save the Constitution."{{sfn|Castel|pp=216–217}}

=== Death ===

Johnson returned home after the special session concluded. In late July, convinced some of his opponents were defaming him in the Ohio gubernatorial race, he decided to travel there to give speeches. He began the trip on July 28, and broke the journey at his daughter Mary's farm near [[Elizabethton, Tennessee|Elizabethton]], where his daughter Martha was also staying. That evening he suffered a stroke, but refused medical treatment until the next day, when he did not improve and two doctors were sent for from Elizabethton. He seemed to respond to their ministrations, but suffered another stroke on the evening of July 30, and died early the following morning at the age of 66. President Grant had the "painful duty" of announcing the death of the only surviving past president. Northern newspapers, in their obituaries, tended to focus on Johnson's loyalty during the war, while Southern ones paid tribute to his actions as president. Johnson's funeral was held on August 3 in Greeneville.{{sfn|Trefousse|pp=375–377}}{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|p=143}} He was buried with his body wrapped in an American flag and a copy of the U.S. Constitution placed under his head, according to his wishes. The burial ground was dedicated as the [[Andrew Johnson National Cemetery]] in 1906, and with his home and tailor's shop, is part of the [[Andrew Johnson National Historic Site]].{{sfn|Trefousse|p=377}}

== Historical reputation and legacy ==
According to Castel, "historians [of Johnson's presidency] have tended to concentrate to the exclusion of practically everything else upon his role in that titanic event [Reconstruction]".{{sfn|Castel|p=vii}} Through the remainder of the 19th century, there were few historical evaluations of Johnson and his presidency. Memoirs from Northerners who had dealt with him, such as former vice president Henry Wilson and Maine Senator [[James G. Blaine]], depicted him as an obstinate boor who tried to favor the South in Reconstruction, but who was frustrated by Congress.{{sfn|Castel|p=218}} According to historian [[Howard K. Beale]] in his journal article about the historiography of Reconstruction, "Men of the postwar decades were more concerned with justifying their own position than they were with painstaking search for truth. Thus [Alabama congressman and historian] [[Hilary Herbert]] and his corroborators presented a Southern indictment of Northern policies, and Henry Wilson's history was a brief for the North."{{sfn|Beale|p=807}}

The turn of the 20th century saw the first significant historical evaluations of Johnson. Leading the wave was Pulitzer Prize-winning historian [[James Ford Rhodes]], who wrote of the former president:{{sfn|Castel|p=218}}

{{quote|Johnson acted in accordance with his nature. He had intellectual force but it worked in a groove. Obstinate rather than firm it undoubtedly seemed to him that following counsel and making concessions were a display of weakness. At all events from his December message to the veto of the Civil Rights Bill he yielded not a jot to Congress. The moderate senators and representatives (who constituted a majority of the Union party) asked him for only a slight compromise; their action was really an entreaty that he would unite with them to preserve Congress and the country from the policy of the radicals&amp;nbsp;... His quarrel with Congress prevented the readmission into the Union on generous terms of the members of the late Confederacy&amp;nbsp;... His pride of opinion, his desire to beat, blinded him to the real welfare of the South and of the whole country.{{sfn|Rhodes|p=589}}}}

Rhodes ascribed Johnson's faults to his personal weaknesses, and blamed him for the problems of the postbellum South.{{sfn|Beale|p=807}} Other early 20th-century historians, such as [[John Burgess (political scientist)|John Burgess]], [[Woodrow Wilson]] (who later became president himself) and [[William Dunning]], all Southerners, concurred with Rhodes, believing Johnson flawed and politically inept, but concluding that he had tried to carry out Lincoln's plans for the South in good faith.{{sfn|Castel|pp=218–219}} Author and journalist Jay Tolson suggests that Wilson "depict[ed Reconstruction] as a vindictive program that hurt even repentant southerners while benefiting northern opportunists, the so-called Carpetbaggers, and cynical white southerners, or Scalawags, who exploited alliances with blacks for political gain".{{sfn|Tolson}}

[[File:Andrew-johnson-grave-01.jpg|thumb|left|The grave of Andrew Johnson, Greeneville, Tennessee]]
Even as Rhodes and his school wrote, [[Dunning School|another group of historians]] was setting out on the full rehabilitation of Johnson, using for the first time primary sources such as his papers, provided by his daughter Martha before her death in 1901, and the diaries of Johnson's Navy Secretary, [[Gideon Welles]], first published in 1911. The resulting volumes, such as David Miller DeWitt's ''The Impeachment and Trial of President Andrew Johnson'' (1903), presented him far more favorably than they did those who had sought to oust him. In James Schouler's 1913 ''History of the Reconstruction Period'', the author accused Rhodes of being "quite unfair to Johnson", though agreeing that the former president had created many of his own problems through inept political moves. These works had an effect; although historians continued to view Johnson as having deep flaws which sabotaged his presidency, they saw his Reconstruction policies as fundamentally correct.{{sfn|Castel|p=220}}

Castel writes:

{{quote|at the end of the 1920s, an historiographical revolution took place. In the span of three years five widely read books appeared, all highly pro-Johnson....They differed in general approach and specific interpretations, but they all glorified Johnson and condemned his enemies. According to these writers, Johnson was a humane, enlightened, and liberal statesman who waged a courageous battle for the Constitution and democracy against scheming and unscrupulous Radicals, who were motivated by a vindictive hatred of the South, partisanship, and a desire to establish the supremacy of Northern "big business." In short, rather than a boor, Johnson was a martyr; instead of a villain, a hero.{{sfn|Castel|pp=220–21}}}}

Beale wondered in 1940, "is it not time that we studied the history of Reconstruction without first assuming, at least subconsciously, that carpetbaggers and Southern white Republicans were wicked, that Negroes were illiterate incompetents, and that the whole white South owes a debt of gratitude to the restorers of 'white supremacy'?"{{sfn|Beale|p=808}} Despite these doubts, the favorable view of Johnson survived for a time. In 1942, [[Van Heflin]] portrayed the former president as a fighter for democracy in the Hollywood film ''[[Tennessee Johnson]]''. In 1948, a poll of his colleagues by historian [[Arthur M. Schlesinger]] deemed Johnson among the average presidents; in 1956, one by Clinton L. Rossiter named him as one of the near-great Chief Executives.{{sfn|Castel|p=221}} Foner notes that at the time of these surveys, "the Reconstruction era that followed the Civil War was regarded as a time of corruption and misgovernment caused by granting black men the right to vote".{{sfn|Foner column}}

Earlier historians, including Beale, believed that money drove events, and had seen Reconstruction as an economic struggle. They also accepted, for the most part, that reconciliation between North and South should have been the top priority of Reconstruction. In the 1950s, historians began to focus on the African-American experience as central to Reconstruction. They rejected completely any claim of black inferiority, which had marked many earlier historical works, and saw the developing [[civil rights movement]] as a second Reconstruction; [[Neoabolitionism|some writers stated]] they hoped their work on the postbellum era would advance the cause of civil rights. These authors sympathized with the Radical Republicans for their desire to help the African American, and saw Johnson as callous towards the freedman. In a number of works from 1956 onwards by such historians as [[Fawn Brodie]], the former president was depicted as a successful saboteur of efforts to better the freedman's lot. These volumes included major biographies of Stevens and Stanton.{{sfn|Castel|pp=223–225}} Reconstruction was increasingly seen as a noble effort to integrate the freed slaves into society.{{sfn|Tolson}}{{sfn|Foner column}}

In the early 21st century, Johnson is among those commonly mentioned as the worst presidents in U.S. history.{{sfn|Tolson}} According to historian Glenn W. Lafantasie, who believes [[James Buchanan|Buchanan]] the worst president, "Johnson is a particular favorite for the bottom of the pile because of his impeachment&amp;nbsp;... his complete mishandling of Reconstruction policy&amp;nbsp;... his bristling personality, and his enormous sense of self-importance."{{sfn|Lafantasie}} Tolson suggests that "Johnson is now scorned for having resisted Radical Republican policies aimed at securing the rights and well-being of the newly emancipated African-Americans".{{sfn|Tolson}} Gordon-Reed notes that Johnson, along with his contemporaries Pierce and Buchanan, are generally listed among the five worst presidents, but states, "there have never been more difficult times in the life of this nation. The problems these men had to confront were enormous. It would have taken a succession of Lincolns to do them justice."{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|p=56}}

Trefousse considers Johnson's legacy to be "the maintenance of white supremacy. His boost to Southern conservatives by undermining Reconstruction was his legacy to the nation, one that would trouble the country for generations to come."{{sfn|Trefousse|p=352}} Gordon-Reed states of Johnson:

{{quote|We know the results of Johnson's failures—that his preternatural stubbornness, his mean and crude racism, his primitive and instrumental understanding of the Constitution stunted his capacity for enlightened and forward-thinking leadership when those qualities were so desperately needed. At the same time, Johnson's story has a miraculous quality to it: the poor boy who systematically rose to the heights, fell from grace, and then fought his way back to a position of honor in the country. For good or ill, 'only in America,' as they say, could Johnson's story unfold in the way that it did.{{sfn|Gordon-Reed|p=144}}&lt;!-- Note that the sentence does continue, it is clipped for effect --&gt;}}

'''Antonis Samaras''' ({{lang-el|Αντώνης Σαμαράς}}, {{IPA-el|anˈdonis samaˈras|pron}}; born 23 May 1951) is a [[Greece|Greek]] [[politician]] who was [[Prime Minister of Greece]] from 2012 to 2015 and leader of [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] from 2009 to 2015. Samaras previously served as [[Minister of Finance]] in 1989, as [[Minister of Foreign Affairs]] from 1989 to 1992, and as [[Ministry of Culture and Tourism (Greece)|Minister of Culture and Sport]] in 2009.

Samaras was previously best known for a 1993 controversy in which he effectively caused the New Democracy government, of which he was a member, to fall from power. In spite of this he rejoined the party in 2004 and was elected to its leadership in a closely fought intra-party election in late 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ND heads for tense election showdown |publisher=[[Kathimerini]] |url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_politics_100006_28/11/2009_112865 |date=30 November 2009 |accessdate=30 November 2009 |archivedate=2 December 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091202080529/http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_politics_100006_28/11/2009_112865 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the seventh leader of the party since it was founded in 1974.

==Early life and education==
Born in [[Athens]], Samaras is the son of Dr. Konstantinos Samaras, who was a Professor of [[Cardiology]], and Lena, ''née'' Zannas, a maternal granddaughter of author [[Penelope Delta]]. His brother, Alexander, is an architect. His paternal uncle, George Samaras, was a long-standing member of Parliament for Messenia in the 1950s and 1960s.

Samaras grew up among the Athens well-connected families, playing tennis. At the age of 17, he won the Greek Teen Tennis Championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Profile: Greek conservative leader Antonis Samaras|author=Patrick Jackson|publisher=[[BBC News]]|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18410765|date=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended school in the [[Athens College]] (founded by his maternal great-grandfather, [[Stefanos Delta]], and [[Emmanouil Benakis]], Delta's father-in-law), and graduated from [[Amherst College]] in 1974 with a degree in [[economics]], and then from [[Harvard University]] in 1976 with an [[MBA]].

Samaras and former Prime Minister [[George Papandreou (junior)|George Papandreou]] were dormitory roommates during their student years at [[Amherst College]], but became bitter political rivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_columns_1_04/12/2009_113043|title=As good as it gets|date=4 December 2009|publisher=ekathimerini|accessdate=8 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Samaras is married and has a daughter and a son.

==Early career==
[[File:Flickr - europeanpeoplesparty - EPP Summit June 2010 (18).jpg|thumb|left|Antonis Samaras at EPP Summit, June 2010]]

Samaras has been elected as a Member of the Hellenic Parliament, initially for Messenia, from 1977 onward. In 1989 he became the Finance Minister, later advancing to become the [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Greece)|Minister for Foreign Affairs]] in the New Democracy government of PM [[Konstantinos Mitsotakis]] (1990–93), from which post he caused the "[[Macedonia naming dispute|Macedonian Question]]" to ignite. It remains an awkward diplomatic situation, involving both a national name and a heritage dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://salade-macedoine.pblogs.gr/2008/03/ti-htan-oi-dragobites-ti-einai-oi-slabomakedones.html|title=Macedonian Issue|publisher=Mike Kamateros|date=7 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being removed from his post in 1992 over this issue, Samaras founded his own party, "[[Political Spring]]" ({{lang-el|Πολιτική Άνοιξη|translit=Politiki Anoixi}}), located politically to the right of New Democracy.  The defection of one Member of Parliament from New Democracy to Samaras' party caused the government's fall from power in 1993.

Political Spring gained 4.9 per cent of the vote in the [[Greek legislative election, 1993|1993 general election]], earning ten seats in the [[Greek Parliament]].  They gained 8.7 per cent in the elections in the [[European Parliament election, 1994 (Greece)|1994 European Parliament elections]], earning two seats. Its decline started in the [[Greek legislative election, 1996|1996 general election]], when it gained 2.94 per cent, just below the 3 per cent threshold necessary to enter parliament.  They participated in the [[European Parliament election, 1999 (Greece)|1999 European Parliament elections]], but only got 2.3%, which was not enough to elect MEPs.

Political Spring did not participate in the [[Greek legislative election, 2000|2000 general election]], and Samaras publicly supported the New Democracy party.  Before the [[Greek legislative election, 2004|2004 general election]], Samaras dissolved his party, rejoined New Democracy and he was elected a [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]] in the [[European Parliament election, 2004 (Greece)|2004 European elections]].

In the [[2007 Greek legislative election]] he was elected to the Greek Parliament for [[Messenia]], and consequently resigned from the [[European Parliament]]. In January 2009 he was appointed [[Minister for Culture (Greece)|Minister for Culture]] following a government reshuffle.  In this capacity he inaugurated the new [[Acropolis Museum]] in July 2009.  He was reelected in Messenia in 2009.

==New Democracy==
After New Democracy resoundingly lost the [[Greek legislative election, 2009|2009 legislative election]], [[Kostas Karamanlis]] resigned as head of the party, prompting a leadership race, and Samaras ran for the post. Early polls showed he was running neck and neck with the perceived initial favorite [[Dora Bakoyanni]], the former Foreign Minister and former Athens mayor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.angus-reid.com/polls/37442/bakoyannis_holds_slim_lead_in_greeceaas_nd_race/ |title=Bakoyannis Holds Slim Lead in Greece’s ND Race |publisher=Angus Reid |date=1 November 2009 |accessdate=6 November 2009 |archivedate=17 June 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617100737/http://www.angus-reid.com/polls/37442/bakoyannis_holds_slim_lead_in_greeceaas_nd_race/ |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, another leadership candidate, former Minister [[Dimitris Avramopoulos]] announced he was resigning his candidacy and would support Samaras instead. In a break with previous practice, an extraordinary party congress resolved that the new leader would be elected by party members in a countrywide ballot.  Samaras' candidacy soared in opinion polls and finished the race as a favorite.

In the early morning hours of 30 November 2009, Samaras was elected the new leader of the New Democracy party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ametroepeia.pblogs.gr/files/f/474040-AntonVonSchamarAss.JPG|title=Antonis Samaras is the new ND leader|publisher=Mike Kamateros}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following early results showing Samaras in a comfortable lead, Bakoyanni, his main rival, conceded defeat and called Samaras to congratulate him. He accepted his election with a speech at the party headquarters, and pledged to carry out a broad ideological and organizational reform, aspiring to regain majority status.
He was later instrumental in the expulsion of Ms. Bakoyanni (May, 2010) for defying the party line and voting for an austerity measure required for European Union-[[International Monetary Fund]] backed lending.

==Coalition Government==
Prime Minister [[George Papandreou]] announced his government's plans on 31 October to hold a referendum on the acceptance of the terms of a eurozone bailout deal. The referendum was to be held in December 2011 or January 2012. Following vehement opposition from both within and outside the country, Papandreou however scrapped the plan a few days later on 3 November.

On 5 November, his government only narrowly won a confidence vote in parliament and Samaras called for immediate elections. The next day Papandreou met with opposition leaders trying to reach an agreement on the formation of an interim national unity government. However, Samaras only gave in, after Papandreou agreed to step aside, allowing the EU bailout to proceed and paving the way for elections on 19 February 2012.

After several days of intense negotiations, the two major parties along with the Popular Orthodox Rally agreed to form a grand coalition headed by former Vice President of the European Central Bank Lucas Papademos. On 10 November, George Papandreou formally resigned as Prime Minister of Greece. The new coalition cabinet and Prime Minister Lucas Papademos were formally sworn in on 11 November 2011.

Following the [[Greek legislative election, May 2012|May 2012 legislative election]] where the [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] party became the largest party in the Hellenic Parliament, Samaras was asked by [[President of Greece|Greek President]] [[Karolos Papoulias]] to try to form a government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rthk.hk/rthk/news/englishnews/20120507/news_20120507_56_838693.htm|title=Samaras tries to form Greek coalition|publisher=Rthk.hk|accessdate=14 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810231637/http://rthk.hk/rthk/news/englishnews/20120507/news_20120507_56_838693.htm|archivedate=10 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after a day of hard negotiations with the other parties in Parliament, Samaras officially announced he was giving up the mandate to form a government. The task passed to [[Alexis Tsipras]], leader of the [[Coalition of the Radical Left|SYRIZA]] (the second largest party) who was also unable to form a government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Petrakis |first=Maria|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-07/samaras-says-fails-to-form-greek-government-hands-back-mandate.html|title=Greek Government Mandate to Pass to Syriza as Samaras Fails|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=14 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement|PASOK]] also failed to negotiate a successful agreement to form a government, emergency talks with the President ended with a new election being called while the outgoing chairman of the [[Council of State (Greece)|Council of State]] [[Panagiotis Pikrammenos]] was appointed as Prime Minister in a [[Caretaker Cabinet of Panagiotis Pikrammenos|caretaker government]] composed of independent technocrats.

Voters once again took to the polls in the widely watched [[Greek legislative election, June 2012|June 2012 election]]. New Democracy came out on top in a stronger position with 129 seats, compared to 108 in the May election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ametroepeia.pblogs.gr/2012/06/titanic-stupidity.html|title=Antonis Sama[ska]ras}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 June 2012, Samaras successfully formed a coalition with [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement|PASOK]] (now led by former Finance Minister [[Evangelos Venizelos]]) and [[Democratic Left (Greece)|DIMAR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-18524252|title=Antonis Samaras|accessdate=20 June 2012|work=BBC News|date=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new government had a majority of 28 (which was later reduced to 18),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/11/08/uk-greece-defection-idUKBRE8A70E020121108|agency=Reuters|title=Greek deputy quits ruling coalition party|date=8 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Coalition of the Radical Left|SYRIZA]], [[Independent Greeks|Independent Greeks (ANEL)]], [[Golden Dawn (Greece)|Golden Dawn (XA)]] and the [[Communist Party of Greece|Communist Party (KKE)]] comprising the opposition. PASOK and DIMAR chose to take a limited role in [[Coalition Cabinet of Antonis Samaras|Samaras' Cabinet]], being represented by party officials and independent technocrats instead of MPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-18531604|title=PM Antonis Samaras announces cabinet|date=2012-06-21|accessdate=2012-06-22|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DIMAR left the coalition on 21 June 2013 in protest at the closure of the nation's public broadcaster [[Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation|ERT]], leaving Samaras with a slim majority of 153 ND and PASOK MPs combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Greece coalition partner pulls out ministers in wake of ERT debacle [update]|url=http://ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_21/06/2013_505319|accessdate=24 June 2013|newspaper=[[Kathimerini]]|date=24 June 2013|location=Piraeus}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two remaining parties proceeded to negotiate a cabinet reshuffle that resulted in a significantly expanded role for PASOK in the new [[coalition government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=el:Η σύνθεση της νέας κυβέρνησης|url=http://ekprosopos.gov.gr/?p=4429|publisher=ΓΕΝΙΚΗ ΓΡΑΜΜΑΤΕΙΑ ΕΝΗΜΕΡΩΣΗΣ &amp; ΕΠΙΚΟΙΝΩΝΙΑΣ - ΓΕΝΙΚΗ ΓΡΑΜΜΑΤΕΙΑ ΜΕΣΩΝ ΕΝΗΜΕΡΩΣΗΣ|accessdate=24 June 2013|location=Athens|language=Greek|date=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= New government is ushered in|url=http://ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_24/06/2013_505617|accessdate=24 June 2013|newspaper=Kathimerini|date=24 June 2013|location=Piraeus}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further reshuffle followed the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (Greece)|2014 European Parliament election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|script-title=el:Σαρωτικός ανασχηματισμός: Η σύνθεση της νέας κυβέρνησης - τα βιογραφικά|url=http://www.kathimerini.gr/770923/article/epikairothta/politikh/sarwtikos-o-anasxhmatismos---h-syn8esh-ths-neas-kyvernhshs-samara|accessdate=9 June 2014|work=Kathimerini|date=9 June 2014|language=Greek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Samaras implemented a series of reforms and [[austerity]] measures with the aim of reducing government budget deficits and making the Greek economy competitive. In 2013 he passed reform bills approving the layoff of 15,000 public employees, among them high school teachers, school guards and municipal policemen.

On 9 December 2014, Samaras announced the candidacy of New Democracy politician [[Stavros Dimas]] for the position of [[President of Greece]]. Stavros Dimas failed to secure the required majority of MPs of the [[Hellenic Parliament]] in the first three rounds of voting.

The '''Baltic Way''' or '''Baltic Chain''' (also '''Chain of Freedom''';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Central and East European Politics: From Communism to Democracy |first=Sharon L. |last=Wolchik |author2=Jane Leftwich Curry |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ciKIBazTof8C&amp;pg=PA238#v=onepage&amp;f=false |page=238 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |year=2007 |isbn=0-7425-4068-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-et|Balti kett}}; {{lang-lv|Baltijas ceļš}}; {{lang-lt|Baltijos kelias}}; {{lang-ru|Балтийский путь}}) was a peaceful political demonstration that occurred on 23 August 1989. Approximately two million people joined their hands to form a [[human chain]] spanning {{convert|675.5|km}} across the three [[Baltic states]] – [[Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic|Estonia]], [[Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic|Latvia]], and [[Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic|Lithuania]], which were considered at the time to be [[republics of the Soviet Union|constituent republics]] of the [[Soviet Union]].

The demonstration originated in "Black Ribbon Day" protests held in the western cities in the 1980s. It marked the 50th anniversary of the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] between the Soviet Union and [[Nazi Germany]]. The pact and its secret protocols divided [[Eastern Europe]] into [[spheres of influence]] and led to the [[occupation of the Baltic states]] in 1940. The event was organised by Baltic pro-independence movements: [[Popular Front of Estonia|Rahvarinne]] of Estonia, the [[Popular Front of Latvia|Tautas fronte]] of Latvia, and [[Sąjūdis]] of Lithuania. The protest was designed to draw global attention by demonstrating a popular desire for independence for each of the entities. It also illustrated solidarity among the three nations. It has been described as an effective publicity campaign, and an emotionally captivating and visually stunning scene.&lt;ref name=drei&gt;{{cite book | title=Latvia in Transition |first=Juris |last=Dreifelds |url=https://books.google.com/?id=0d9svpuxozkC&amp;pg=PA34#v=onepage&amp;f=false | publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1996 |pages=34–35 | isbn=0-521-55537-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anušauskas (2005), p. 619&lt;/ref&gt; The event presented an opportunity for the Baltic activists to publicise the Soviet rule and position the question of Baltic independence not only as a political matter, but also as a moral issue. The Soviet authorities responded to the event with intense rhetoric,&lt;ref name=drei/&gt; but failed to take any constructive actions that could bridge the widening gap between the Baltic republics and the rest of the Soviet Union. Within seven months of the protest, Lithuania became the first of the Soviet republics to declare independence.

After the [[Fall of Communism]], 23 August has become an official [[remembrance day]] both in the Baltic countries, in the [[European Union]] and in other countries, known as the Black Ribbon Day or as the [[European Day of Remembrance for Victims of Stalinism and Nazism]].

==Background==

===Baltic stance===

The Soviet Union denied the existence of the secret protocols to the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], even though they were widely published by western scholars after surfacing during the [[Nuremberg Trials]].&lt;ref name=upi&gt;{{cite news|title=Baltic Deal / Soviets Publish Secret Hitler Pact | author=[[United Press International]] |date=12 August 1989 | publisher=The San Francisco Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Soviet propaganda]] also maintained that there was no occupation and that all three Baltic states voluntarily joined the Union – the [[People's Parliament]]s expressed people's will when they petitioned the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]] to be admitted into the Union.&lt;ref name=conr/&gt; The Baltic states claimed that they were forcefully and illegally incorporated into the Soviet Union. Popular opinion was that the secret protocols proved that the occupation was illegal.&lt;ref&gt;Senn (1995), p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; Such an interpretation of the Pact had major implications in the Baltic public policy. If Baltic diplomats could link the Pact and the occupation, they could claim that the Soviet rule in the republics had no legal basis and therefore all Soviet laws were [[null and void]] since 1940.&lt;ref name=dej/&gt; Such a position would automatically terminate the debate over reforming Baltic sovereignty or establishing autonomy within the Soviet Union – the states never ''[[de jure]]'' belonged to the union in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;Laurinavičius (2008), p. 336&lt;/ref&gt; This would open the possibility of restoring legal continuity of the independent states that existed in the interwar period. Claiming all Soviet laws had no legal power in the Baltics would also cancel the need to follow the [[Constitution of the Soviet Union]] and other formal secession procedures.&lt;ref&gt;Senn (1995), p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

In anticipation of the 50th anniversary of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, tensions were rising between the Baltics and Moscow. Lithuanian [[Romualdas Ozolas]] initiated a collection of 2 million signatures demanding withdrawal of the [[Red Army]] from Lithuania.&lt;ref&gt;Laurinavičius (2008), pp. 317, 326&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Communist Party of Lithuania]] was deliberating the possibility of splitting off from the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Lithuania's Communist Party Considers Split from Moscow | first=Peter |last=Conradi | date= 16 August 1989 | publisher=[[Reuters News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 August 1989, Estonians attempted to amend election laws to limit voting rights of new immigrants (mostly Russian workers).&lt;ref name=hyst/&gt; This provoked mass strikes and protests of Russian workers. Moscow gained an opportunity to present the events as an "inter-ethnic conflict"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Moscow Voices Growing Concern Over Ethnic Conflict |first=James |last=Blitz | date=16 August 1989 |publisher=[[Financial Times]] |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; – it could then position itself as "peacemaker" restoring order in a troubled republic.&lt;ref&gt;Senn (1995), p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; The rising tensions in anticipation of the protest spurred hopes that Moscow would react by announcing constructive reforms to address the demands of the Baltic people.&lt;ref&gt;Laurinavičius (2008), p. 330&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time fears grew of violent clampdown. [[Erich Honecker]] from [[East Germany]] and [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]] from [[Romania]] offered the Soviet Union military assistance in case it decided to use force and break up the demonstration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Alexandra |last=Ashbourne |title=Lithuania: The Rebirth of a Nation, 1991–1994 |publisher=Lexington Books |year=1999 |page=24 |isbn= 0-7391-0027-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soviet response===
On 15 August, official daily ''[[Pravda]]'', in response to worker strikes in Estonia, published sharp criticism of "hysteria" driven by "extremist elements" pursuing selfish "narrow nationalist positions" against the greater benefit of the entire Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=hyst&gt;{{cite news |title=Moscow Condemns 'Hysteria' in Baltics |first=Matthew |last=Fisher |publisher= [[The Globe and Mail]] |date=16 August 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 August, the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] published a project of new policy regarding the union republics in ''Pravda''. However, this project offered few new ideas: it preserved Moscow's leadership not only in foreign policy and defense, but also in economy, science, and culture.&lt;ref name=i334/&gt; The project made few cautious concessions: it proposed the republics the right to challenge national laws in a court (at the time all three Baltic states had amended their constitutions giving their [[Supreme Soviet]]s the right to veto national laws)&lt;ref name=hc&gt;{{cite news| title=Soviet party leaders accept Baltic demand |agency=Associated Press | date=17 August 1989 | publisher=[[Houston Chronicle]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the right to promote their national languages to the level of the official state language (at the same time the project emphasised the leading role of the Russian language)&lt;!-- Deleted image removed:  [[File:Baltic Way 2.jpg|thumb|240px]] --&gt;.&lt;ref name=i334&gt;Laurinavičius (2008), p. 334&lt;/ref&gt; The project also included law banning "nationalist and chauvinist organisations," which could be used to persecute pro-independence groups in the Baltics,&lt;ref name=hc/&gt; and a proposal to replace the [[Treaty on the Creation of the USSR]] of 1922 with a new unifying agreement, which would be part of the Soviet constitution.&lt;ref name=i334/&gt;

On 18 August, ''Pravda'' published an extensive interview with [[Alexander Nikolaevich Yakovlev]],&lt;ref name=var&gt;{{cite book| first=Vytas Stanley |last=Vardys |author2=Judith B. Sedaitis |title=Lithuania: The Rebel Nation |publisher=Westview Press |year=1997 |series=Westview Series on the Post-Soviet Republics |isbn=0-8133-1839-4 |pages=150–151}}&lt;/ref&gt; chairman of a 26-member commission set up by the [[Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union|Congress of People's Deputies]] to investigate the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] and its secret protocols.&lt;ref name=upi/&gt; During the interview, Yakovlev admitted that the secret protocols were genuine. He condemned the protocols, but maintained that they had no impact on the incorporation of the Baltic states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title= Kremlin Acknowledges Secret Pact on Baltics; Soviets Deny Republics Annexed Illegally |first=David |last=Remnick |date=19 August 1989 | publisher=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Moscow reversed its long-standing position that the secret protocols did not exist or were forgeries, but did not concede that events of 1940 constituted an occupation. It was clearly not enough to satisfy the Baltics and on 22 August, a commission of the [[Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR]] announced that the occupation in 1940 was a direct result of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact and therefore illegal.&lt;ref&gt;Senn (1995), p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time that an official Soviet body challenged the legitimacy of the Soviet rule.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;&lt;ref name=sanf/&gt;

==Protest==

===Preparation===
[[File:1989 08 23Šiauliai1Baltijos kelias.jpg|thumb|Demonstration in [[Šiauliai]]. The coffins are decorated with national flags of the three Baltic states and are placed under Soviet and [[Nazi flag]]s.]]

In the light of ''[[glasnost]]'' and ''[[perestroika]]'', street demonstrations had been increasingly growing in popularity and support. On 23 August, 1986, Black Ribbon Day demonstrations were held in 21 western cities including [[New York City|New York]], [[Ottawa]], [[London]], [[Stockholm]], [[Seattle]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Perth, Australia|Perth]], and [[Washington, DC]] to bring worldwide attention to human rights violations by the Soviet Union. In 1987, Black Ribbon Day protests were held in 36 cities including Vilnius, Lithuania. Protests against the Molotov Ribbentrop Pact were also held in Tallinn and Riga in 1987. In 1988, for the first time, such protests were sanctioned by the Soviet authorities and did not end in arrests.&lt;ref name=dej&gt;{{cite news| first=Mary |last=Dejevsky |title=Baltic Groups Plan Mass Protest; Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia's Struggle for Independence |publisher=The Times |date=23 August 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; The activists planned an especially large protest for the 50th anniversary of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact in 1989. It is unclear when and by whom the idea of a human chain was advanced. It appears that the idea was proposed during a trilateral meeting in [[Pärnu]] on 15 July.&lt;ref&gt;Anušauskas (2005), p. 617&lt;/ref&gt; An official agreement between the Baltic activists was signed in [[Cēsis]] on 12 August.&lt;ref&gt;Laurinavičius (2008), p. 326. [http://www.balticway.net/uploads/LV_written_docs/Cesis-Baltijas_cels_II%20(2).pdf Full text]&lt;/ref&gt; Local Communist Party authorities approved the protest.&lt;ref name=dobbs&gt;{{cite news | title=Baltic States Link in Protest 'So Our Children Can Be Free'; 'Chain' Participants Decry Soviet Takeover |first=Michael |last=Dobbs |authorlink=Michael Dobbs (US author) |publisher=The Washington Post |date=24 August 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time several different petitions, denouncing Soviet occupation, were gathering hundreds of thousands of signatures.&lt;ref name=imse27/&gt;

The organisers mapped out the chain, designating specific locations to specific cities, towns, and villages to make sure that the chain would be uninterrupted. Free bus rides were provided for those who did not have other transportation.&lt;ref name=a100&gt;Alanen (2004), [https://books.google.com/books?id=7S5zAw_sKFUC&amp;pg=PA100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a#v=onepage&amp;f=false p. 100]&lt;/ref&gt; Preparations spread across the country, energising the previously uninvolved rural population.&lt;ref name=a78/&gt; Some employers did not allow workers to take the day off from work (23 August fell on a Wednesday), while others sponsored the bus rides.&lt;ref name=a100/&gt; On the day of the event, special radio broadcasts helped to coordinate the effort.&lt;ref name=dobbs/&gt; Estonia declared a public holiday.&lt;ref name=lod2m/&gt;

The Baltic pro-independence movements issued a joint declaration to the world and European community in the name of the protest. The declaration condemned the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, calling it a criminal act, and urged declaration that the pact was "null and void from the moment of signing."&lt;ref name=fax&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.balticway.net/uploads/LV_written_docs/BalticWayfax%20(3).pdf |title=The Baltic Way |date=17 August 1989 |publisher=Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian National Commissions for UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; The declaration said that the question of the Baltics was a "problem of inalienable [[human rights]]" and accused the European community of "double standards" and turning a blind eye to the "last colonies of Hitler–Stalin era."&lt;ref name=fax/&gt; On the day of the protest, ''[[Pravda]]'' published an editorial titled "Only the Facts." It was a collection of quotes from pro-independence activists intended to show the unacceptable anti-Soviet nature of their work.&lt;ref name=s67/&gt;

===Human chain===
[[File:Balti kett Käru.jpg|thumb|Monument to the Baltic Way in Estonia]]
The chain connected the three Baltic capitals – [[Vilnius]], [[Riga]], and [[Tallinn]].

On 26 August 1989, a pronouncement from the Central Committee of the Communist Party was read during the opening 19 minutes of ''[[Vremya]]'', the main evening news program on Soviet television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Moscow Condemns nationalist 'Virus' in 3 Baltic Lands |first=Esther B. |last=Fein |date=27 August 1989 | publisher=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/27/world/moscow-condemns-nationalist-virus-in-3-baltic-lands.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a sternly worded warning about growing "nationalist, extremist groups" which advanced "anti-socialist and anti-Soviet" agendas.&lt;ref name=rem&gt;{{cite news| title=Kremlin Condemns Baltic Nationalists; Soviets Warn Separatism Risks 'Disaster' |first=David |last=Remnick |date=27 August 1989 |publisher=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement claimed that these groups discriminated against ethnic minorities and terrorised those still loyal to Soviet ideals.&lt;ref name=rem/&gt; Local authorities were openly criticised for their failure to stop these activists.&lt;ref name=s67/&gt; The Baltic Way was referred to as "nationalist hysteria."

The human chain helped to publicise the Baltic cause around the world and symbolised solidarity among the Baltic peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Estonia: Return to Independence |first=Rein |last=Taagepera |url=https://books.google.com/?id=kQETYU_m6O0C&amp;pg=PA156#v=onepage&amp;f=false |page=157 | publisher=Westview Press |year=1993 |isbn=0-8133-1703-7 |series=Westview Series on the Post-Soviet Republics}}&lt;/ref&gt; The positive image of the non-violent [[Singing Revolution]] spread among the western media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Latvians: A Short History |first=Andrejs |last=Plakans |page=174 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ad3-xvwdjE4C&amp;pg=PA174#v=onepage&amp;f=false |publisher=Hoover Press |year=1995 |isbn=0-8179-9302-9 |series=Studies of Nationalities}}&lt;/ref&gt; The activists, including [[Vytautas Landsbergis]], used the increased exposure to position the debate over Baltic independence as a moral, and not just political question: reclaiming independence would be restoration of historical justice and liquidation of Stalinism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Baltics Call Soviet Annexation a 'Crime,' Equate Hitler, Stalin |first=Andrew |last=Katell |date=22 August 1989 |agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Senn (1995), p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; It was an emotional event, strengthening the determination to seek independence. The protest highlighted that the pro-independence movements, established just a year before, became more assertive and radical: they shifted from demanding greater freedom from Moscow to full independence.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

In December 1989, the [[Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union|Congress of People's Deputies]] accepted and [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] signed the report by [[Alexander Nikolaevich Yakovlev|Yakovlev's]] commission condemning the secret protocols of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact.&lt;ref&gt;Senn (1995), p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1990, the first free democratic elections to the [[Supreme Soviet]]s took place in all three Baltic states and pro-independence candidates won majorities. On 11 March 1990, within seven months of the Baltic Way, Lithuania became the first Soviet state to declare independence. The independence of all three Baltic states was recognised by most western countries by the end of 1991.

This protest was one of the earliest and longest unbroken [[human chain]]s in history. Similar human chains were later organised in many East European countries and regions of the [[USSR]] and, more recently, in [[Taiwan]] ([[228 Hand-in-Hand Rally]]) and [[Catalonia]] ([[Catalan Way]]). Documents recording the Baltic Way were added to [[UNESCO]]'s [[Memory of the World Register]] in 2009 in recognition of their value in documenting history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Thirty-Five Documentary Properties Added to UNESCO's Memory of the World Register |url=http://www.artdaily.org/index.asp?int_sec=2&amp;int_new=32399 |publisher=ArtDaily.org  |accessdate=31 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mow&gt;{{cite web|title= The Baltic Way – Human Chain Linking Three States in Their Drive for Freedom |url= http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=26920&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html | date=2009-07-31 |publisher=UNESCO Memory of the World Programme |accessdate=2009-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1899">The '''Bare-fronted Hoodwink''' (''Dissimulatrix spuria'') was a hoax and satirical [[wastebasket taxon|wastebasket]] [[species]] of [[bird]] created by [[ornithologist]] [[Matthew Fontaine Maury Meiklejohn|M.F.M. Meiklejohn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|work=Bird Notes|volume=24|issue=3|pages=89-92|year=1950|author=Meiklejohn, M.F.A.|title=Notes on the hoodwink (''Dissumulatrix spuria'')}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hoodwink has the ability to be "almost seen" or "almost captured".  Bird watchers can easily identify this bird by its "blurred appearance and extremely rapid flight away from the observer."  Meiklejohn claimed that the single species could easily account for every bird not completely sighted.

Birdwatchers added this species to their list of birds to watch for, and amateurs seemed to sight the Hoodwink more often.

On April 1, 1975, the bird was put on display at the [[Royal Scottish Museum]] at [[Edinburgh]].  The exhibit also included photos of blurry birds flying away.  The bird was created using the head of a [[carrion crow]], the body of a [[plover]], and the feet of an unknown [[waterfowl]].  The bare front was compromised with [[wax]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hoaxes.org/photos/hoodwink.html The Bare-fronted Hoodwink (''Dissimulatrix spuria'')]. hoaxes.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Meiklejohn's paper was published in the scientific journal ''[[Bird Notes]]'' in 1950.  The paper was rather long and humorous, and he even claimed the genus to be descendant of an ancient species ''Paleodissimulatrix''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://sora.unm.edu/node/19993 |journal=The Auk |volume=68 |issue=3 |pages=386–405 |year=1951 |title=Recent Literature |doi=10.2307/4081014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert O. Goodman''' (born 30 November 1956) is a former [[A-6 Intruder]] Bombardier Navigator and class of 1978 graduate of the [[United States Naval Academy]]. He was shot down over [[Lebanon]] on 4 December 1983. Captured upon ejection from his stricken plane, he was held captive for 30 days. His release on 3 January 1984, was facilitated by Reverend [[Jesse Jackson]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Background==
In October 1983, {{USS|John F. Kennedy|CV-67}} was diverted to [[Beirut]], Lebanon from her planned Indian Ocean deployment, after the [[Beirut barracks bombing]] killed 241 US Military personnel of the [[Multinational Force in Lebanon]]. The ship spent the rest of that year and early 1984 patrolling the region. On 4 December, in response to two US [[F-14]] aircraft having been fired upon the previous day, ten A-6 Intruders of [[Second VA-85 (U.S. Navy)|VA-85 ''Black Falcons'']]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Capture==
While on a bombing mission, the two-man crew from [[Second VA-85 (U.S. Navy)|Attack Squadron VA-85]] was hit by an [[infrared homing]] missile ([[SA-7]] or [[SA-9]]) into the engine nozzle upon dropping its bomb-load, while still in a dive through 1,800 feet (554 m) [[Altitude above ground level|AGL]]. The fuselage and a wing were immediately engulfed in flames, and then the right side engine erupted.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The pilot, [[United States Navy]] Lieutenant [[Mark Lange]], a Naval Aviator, tried to control the aircraft in order to safely eject the crew. After a rapid, low-level descent, the Intruder was seen to pull up and likely stalled, resulting in a crash on a 1,000 AGL {{clarify|date=November 2013}} hill, above a village surrounded by [[Syria]]n [[anti-aircraft artillery]] positions. Lange ejected both himself and Goodman in the final moment, but his parachute failed to properly deploy by the time he hit the ground. Lange's left leg was severely injured and he died shortly after capture by Syrian troops and Lebanese civilians. Goodman, rendered unconscious, broke three ribs, injured a shoulder and a knee during the landing, but was otherwise stable. He was captured and awakened by the Syrians and taken to [[Damascus]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Captivity==
Goodman was held for more than a month, during which the U.S. government made numerous attempts to free him. He had a few visitors, including Ambassador [[Robert Paganelli]] who brought him [[Christmas dinner]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Freedom==
In December 1983, [[Jesse Jackson]] traveled to Syria with a delegation that included; Reverend [[Wyatt Tee Walker|Wyatt T. Walker]], [[Louis Farrakhan]], Jack Mendelson, Dr. Thelma C.D. Adair, Reverend [[M. William Howard Jr.]], Florence Tate (Press Secretary), Julia Jones (Photographer), Thomas Porter, [[Jesse Jackson Jr.]], [[Jonathan Jackson (activist)|Jonathan Jackson]], and others. The mission's peaceful purpose was accomplished, as they secured the release of Goodman.&lt;ref&gt;Walters, Ronald (2007).

==White House Reception==
On 4 January 1984, [[U.S. President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] welcomed Lt. Goodman at the [[White House]], hours after he and Rev. Jackson arrived back in the U.S.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Reagan said Lt. Goodman "exemplified qualities of leadership and loyalty" and said Jackson's "mission of mercy" had "earned our gratitude and our admiration." In turn, Jackson praised Reagan for sending a letter to Syrian President Assad calling for cooperation in bringing peace to Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley, Alessandra.

==Aftermath==
Following captivity, release, and return to the [[United States]], Lt. Goodman remained in active service.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

As a lieutenant commander, Bobby Goodman was featured in an episode of "Wings over the Gulf" (In Harm's Way, 1992) in which he discussed his experiences in the Gulf War of 1991 with Iraq where he flew the A-6 Intruder.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Goodman retired with the rank of commander in 1995.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

[[Image:PabloCasals22.jpg|thumb|Pablo Casals, 1922]]
The '''Casals Festival''' is a classical music event celebrated every year in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]], in honor of classical musician [[Pablo Casals]].

==Background==
The festival was founded in 1956 by Pablo Casals. It was promoted by [[Teodoro Moscoso]] and [[David Ogilvy (businessman)|David Ogilvy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sobre Nosotros|url=http://www.festcasalspr.gobierno.pr/abouteng.html|publisher=Festival Casals of Puerto Rico|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120411212319/http://www.festcasalspr.gobierno.pr/abouteng.html|archivedate={{date|11-04-2012|mdy}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the objectives of changing the image of Puerto Rico and promoting tourism to the island during off-peak tourism time. After implementing Operation Bootstrap, Teodoro Moscoso employed advertiser David Ogilvy to propagate the image of a people engaged in a cultural renaissance.&lt;ref name="nyt1995"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/05/arts/television-review-north-america-to-see-casals-festival-concert.html|title=North America to See Casals Festival Concert|first=John J.|last=O'Connor|date={{date|05-01-1995|mdy}}|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Teodoro Moscoso's decisive actions at critical junctures (such as his success in pushing tax exemptions and tourism in the late 1940s) and his personal persuasiveness, as with Pablo Casals, who at the age of 80 was persuaded to establish the Casals Festival at San Juan.&lt;ref name="nyt1995"/&gt;

==Pablo Casals==
Pablo Casals (1876–1973), was born in Spain to a Puerto Rican mother [[Pilar Defilló Amiguet|Pilar Defilló]]. He was a cello player and a supporter of the Spanish Republican Government and as such came to odds with Generalisimo [[Francisco Franco]] when the Spanish Republican Government was overthrown. Casals went to live in the French village of [[Prades, Pyrénées-Orientales|Prades]]. There he established the [[Prades Festival]]. Casals visited Puerto Rico in 1955 and in 1956

In 1956, Casals moved permanently to the island. He was scheduled to inaugurate the festival which bears his name. The inauguration of the festival was held in the [[University of Puerto Rico|University of Puerto Rico Theater]]. Casals, who was supposed to perform '''Suite Number 3''' in C major, for solo cello by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], fell ill and suffered a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] during the rehearsals. Even though Casals was hospitalized, the event went on as scheduled with the performance of [[pianist]] [[Rudolf Serkin]].

When the festival first started, the majority of the musicians contracted by the festival orchestra for the event came from the United States. Some of the exceptions to this practice were [[Jesús María Sanromá]], Henry Hutchinson Sr., Fernando Valenti and [[Narciso Figueroa]] and his brothers. By 1970, the majority of the members of the festival's orchestra were Puerto Ricans.

==Participants==

Amongst the musical directors who have participated in the festival besides Casals are [[Mstislav Rostropovich]], [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[Zubin Mehta]], [[Eugene Ormandy]], Sir [[John Barbirolli]], [[Yehudi Menuhin]] and recently [[Krzysztof Penderecki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/02/arts/restoring-old-videotapes-of-casals-festival.html|title=Restoring Old Videotapes of Casals Festival|first=Allan|last=Kozinn|date={{date|02-01-1991|mdy}}|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The artistic direccion of the festival has been under the following "maestros" at one time or another: [[Jorge Mester]], [[Odón Alonso]], Mstislav Rostropovich, Krzysztof Penderecki, [[Elías López Sobá]], Justino Diaz and presently under Maximiano Valdés.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.galenusrevista.com/festival-casals-de-puerto-rico.html|publisher=Galenus - Revista para los Medicos de Puerto Rico|title=Festival Casals de Puerto Rico|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Casals Festival today==
{{sources|section|date=May 2014}}
Pablo Casals died on October 22, 1973.  His widow [[Marta Casals Istomin|Marta Casals]] who was the president of the musical committee and Co‑Chairman of the Board and Music Director until 1979, undertook to continue the annual event.  The festival has now taken on a new dimension with the appointment of pianist and scholar [[Elías López-Sobá]] and bass/baritone [[Justino Díaz]] as artistic and musical directors. These two Puerto Rican artists have continued to follow the legacy of Pablo and Marta Casals, attracting many musicians for a series of concerts. The festival which is now held at the [[Luis A. Ferre]] [[Luis A. Ferré Performing Arts Center|Performing Arts Center]] in San Juan, celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2006 with a performance of the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]] under the musical direction of Maestro [[Christoph Eschenbach]].

The Prades Festival established by Casals in France in 1950 was renamed the Pablo Casals Festival in 1982.

'''Confusion''' (from [[Latin]] ''confusĭo, -ōnis'', from ''confundere'': "to pour together;" "to mingle together;" "to confuse") is the state of being bewildered or unclear in one’s mind about something.

==Medical term==
{{Infobox symptom 
|Name=Mental Confusion Classifications 
|Field=[[Psychiatry]]
|ICD10={{ICD10|R|41|0|r|40}}

}}
The term "acute mental confusion"&lt;ref name="oxforddictionaries.com"&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/confusion ''Confusion Definition'']; [[Oxford Dictionary]] online.&lt;/ref&gt; is often used interchangeably with [[delirium]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.symptomfind.com/symptoms/confusion/ ''Delirium'']; Symptom Finder online ; accessed .&lt;/ref&gt; in the ''[[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]]'' and the ''[[Medical Subject Headings]]'' publications to describe the [[pathology]]. These refer to the loss of [[Orientation (mental)|orientation]], or the ability to place oneself correctly in the world by time, location and personal identity. Mental confusion is sometimes accompanied by disordered [[consciousness]] (the loss of linear thinking) and [[memory]] loss (the ability to correctly recall previous events or learn new material).&lt;ref name=thefreedictionary&gt;[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/mental+confusion thefreedictionary.com] Citing: Dorland's Medical Dictionary for Health Consumers; 2007; Saunders.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Confusion may result from drug side effects or from a relatively sudden brain dysfunction.  Acute confusion is often called [[delirium]] (or "acute confusional state"),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patient.info/doctor/Acute-Confusional-State.htm ''Acute Confusional State'']; Dr. Gurvinder Rull; patient.info; Document ID/Version/Reference: 1714/22/bgp2104; updated: 13 Jan 2009; accessed: ''when?''.&lt;/ref&gt; although delirium often includes a much broader array of disorders than simple confusion.  These disorders include the inability to focus attention; various impairments in awareness; and temporal or spatial dis-orientation.  Mental confusion can result from chronic organic brain pathologies, such as [[dementia]], as well.

===Differential diagnosis===
{{further|Differential diagnosis}}

The most common causes of drug induced acute confusion are [[dopaminergic]] drugs (used for the treatment of [[Parkinson's disease]]), [[diuretics]], [[tricyclic antidepressants|tricyclic]] or [[tetracyclic antidepressants]] and [[benzodiazepines]].  The elderly, and especially those with pre-existing dementia, are most at risk for drug induced acute confusional states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Hufschmidt |first1=A. |last2=Shabarin |first2=V. |last3=Zimmer |first3=T. |title=Drug-induced confusional states: the usual suspects? |journal=[[Acta Neurologica Scandinavica]] |volume=120 |issue=6 |pages=436–8 |date=Dec 2009 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0404.2009.01174.x |pmid=19804475}}&lt;/ref&gt;  New research is finding a link between [[Vitamin D]] deficiency and [[cognitive impairment]] (which includes 'foggy brain').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thirdage.com/brain-fitness/vitamin-d-linked-to-cognitive-impairment''Vitamin D Linked to Cognitive Impairment'']; [[Third Age]] online; accessed: .&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=WP:MEDRS|date=June 2018}}{{Dead link|date=June 2018}}

{{History of Christianity in the British Isles|image=Glastonburyabbey.jpg|caption=The ruins of [[Glastonbury Abbey]], dissolved in 1539 following the execution of the abbot}}
{{Anglicanism}}

The '''Dissolution of the Monasteries''', sometimes referred to as the '''Suppression of the Monasteries''', was the set of administrative and legal processes between 1536 and 1541 by which [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] disbanded  [[monastery|monasteries]], [[priory|priories]], [[convent]]s and [[friary|friaries]] in [[Kingdom of England|England and Wales]] and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]], appropriated their income, disposed of their assets, and provided for their former personnel and functions. Although the policy was originally envisaged as increasing the regular income of the Crown, much former monastic property was sold off to fund Henry's military campaigns in the 1540s.  He was given the authority to do this in England and Wales by the [[Act of Supremacy#First Act of Supremacy 1534|Act of Supremacy]], passed by [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] in 1534, which made him ''Supreme Head'' of the Church in England, thus separating England from [[Pope|Papal authority]], and by the [[The Suppression of Religious Houses Act 1535|First Suppression Act]] (1536) and the [[The Suppression of Religious Houses Act 1539|Second Suppression Act]] (1539).

Professor [[George W. Bernard]] argues:
{{quote|The dissolution of the monasteries in the late 1530s was one of the most revolutionary events in English history. There were nearly 900 religious houses in England, around 260 for monks, 300 for regular canons, 142 nunneries and 183 friaries; some 12,000 people in total, 4,000 monks, 3,000 canons, 3,000 friars and 2,000 nuns. If the adult male population was 500,000, that meant that one adult man in fifty was in religious orders.&lt;ref&gt;G. W. Bernard, "The Dissolution of the Monasteries," ''History'' (2011) 96#324 p 390&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Context==
[[File:Hans Holbein, the Younger, Around 1497-1543 - Portrait of Henry VIII of England - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|Henry VIII c.1537 by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]]. [[Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum]], Madrid.]]
At the time of their suppression, a small number of English and Welsh religious houses could trace their origins to [[Anglo-Saxon]] or [[Wales|Celtic]] foundations before the [[Norman Conquest]], but the overwhelming majority of the 625 monastic communities dissolved by Henry VIII had developed in the wave of monastic enthusiasm that had swept western Christendom in the 11th and 12th centuries. Few English houses had been founded later than the end of the 13th century; the most recent foundation of those suppressed was the [[Bridgettine]] nunnery of [[Syon Abbey]] founded in 1415. (Syon was also the only suppressed community to maintain an unbroken continuity in exile; its nuns returned to England in 1861.)

Typically, 11th- and 12th-century founders had endowed monastic houses with both 'temporal' income in the form of revenues from landed estates, and 'spiritual' income in the form of [[tithes]] [[Appropriation (law)|appropriated]] from parish churches under the founder's patronage. In consequence of this, religious houses in the 16th century controlled appointment to about two-fifths of all parish [[benefice]]s in England,&lt;ref&gt;Dickens, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; disposed of about half of all ecclesiastical income,&lt;ref&gt;Dickens, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; and owned around a quarter of the nation's landed wealth. An English medieval proverb said that if the Abbot of [[Glastonbury Abbey|Glastonbury]] married the Abbess of [[Shaftesbury Abbey|Shaftesbury]], the heir would have more land than the King of England.&lt;ref&gt;''Studies in the Early History of Shaftesbury Abbey'', Dorset County Council, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

The 200 houses of [[friars]] in England and Wales constituted a second distinct wave of foundations, almost all occurring in the 13th century. [[Friaries]], for the most part, were concentrated in urban areas. Unlike monasteries, friaries had eschewed income-bearing endowments; the friars, as [[mendicants]], expected to be supported financially by offerings and donations from the faithful, while ideally being self-sufficient in producing their own basic foods from extensive urban kitchen gardens.

The Dissolution of the Monasteries in England and Ireland took place in the political context of other attacks on the ecclesiastical institutions of Western Roman Catholicism, which had been under way for some time. Many of these were related to the [[Protestant Reformation]] in [[Continental Europe]]. By the end of the 16th century, monasticism had almost entirely disappeared from those European states whose rulers had adopted [[Lutheran]] or [[Calvinism|Reformed]] confessions of faith (Ireland being the only major exception). They continued, albeit in greatly reduced numbers and radically changed forms, in those states that remained Catholic.

But, the religious and political changes in England under Henry VIII and [[Edward VI]] were of a different nature from those taking place in Germany, [[Bohemia]], France, [[Scottish Reformation|Scotland]] and [[Geneva]]. Across much of continental Europe, the seizure of monastic property was associated with mass discontent among the common people and the lower level of clergy and civil society against powerful and wealthy ecclesiastical institutions. Such popular hostility against the church was rare in England before 1558; the Reformation in England and Ireland was directed from the king and highest levels of society. These changes were initially met with widespread popular suspicion; on some occasions and in particular localities, there was active resistance to the royal program.
[[File:Hans Holbein d. J. - Erasmus - Louvre.jpg|thumb|[[Desiderius Erasmus]] by [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Holbein]]; Renaissance humanist and influential critic of religious orders. [[Louvre]], Paris.]]

===Complaints===
Dissatisfaction with the general state of regular religious life, and with the gross extent of monastic wealth, was near to universal amongst late medieval secular and ecclesiastical rulers in the Latin West. [[George W. Bernard|Bernard]] says there was
{{quote|text=widespread concern in the later 15th and early 16th centuries about the condition of the monasteries.  A leading figure here is the scholar and theologian [[Desiderius Erasmus]] who satirized monasteries as lax, as comfortably worldly, as wasteful of scarce resources, and as superstitious; he also thought it would be better if monks were brought more directly under the authority of bishops. At that time, quite a few bishops across Europe had come to believe that resources expensively deployed on an unceasing round of services by men and women in theory set apart from the world [would] be better spent on endowing grammar schools and university colleges to train men who would then serve the laity as parish priests, and on reforming the antiquated structures of over-large diocese such as that of [[Diocese of Lincoln|Lincoln]].  Pastoral care was seen as much more important and vital than the monastic focus on contemplation, prayer and performance of the daily office.&lt;ref&gt;G. W. Bernard, "The Dissolution of the Monasteries," ''History'' (2011) 96#324 p 390&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Erasmus had made a threefold criticism of the monks and nuns of his day, saying that:{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

* in withdrawing from the world into their own communal life, they elevated man-made monastic vows of [[poverty, chastity and obedience]] above the God-given vows of sacramental baptism; and elevated man-made monastic rules for religious life above the God-given teachings of the Gospels;
* notwithstanding exceptional communities of genuine austere life and exemplary charity, the overwhelming majority of abbeys and priories were havens for idle drones; concerned only for their own existence, reserving for themselves an excessive share of the commonwealth's religious assets, and contributing little or nothing to the spiritual needs of ordinary people; and
* the monasteries, almost without exception, were deeply involved in promoting and profiting from the veneration of [[relics]], in the form of [[pilgrimages]] and purported [[miracle|miraculous]] tokens. The [[Relics#Christianity|cult of relics]] was by no means specific to monasteries, but Erasmus was scandalised by the extent to which well-educated and highly regarded monks and nuns would participate in the perpetration of what he considered to be frauds against gullible and credulous lay believers.

Summarising the state of monastic life across Western Europe, [[David Knowles (scholar)|David Knowles]] said,{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

{{quote|text=The verdict of unprejudiced historians at the present day would probably be—abstracting from all ideological considerations for or against monasticism—that there were far too many religious houses in existence in view of the widespread decline of the fervent monastic vocation, and that in every country the monks possessed too much of wealth and of the sources of production both for their own well-being and for the material good of the economy. }}

===Reforms===
Pilgrimages to monastic [[shrine]]s continued to be widely popular, until forcibly suppressed in England in 1538 by order of Henry VIII. But the dissolution resulted in few modifications to the practice of religion in England's parish churches; in general the English religious reforms of the 1530s corresponded in few respects to the precepts of Protestant Reformers, and encountered much popular hostility when they did. In 1536, [[Convocation]] adopted and Parliament enacted the [[Ten Articles]] of which the first half used terminology and ideas drawn from [[Martin Luther|Luther]] and [[Melancthon]]; but any momentum towards Protestantism stalled when Henry VIII expressed his desire for continued orthodoxy with the [[Six Articles (1539)|Six Articles]] of 1539, which remained in effect until after his death.

[[Cardinal Wolsey]] had obtained a [[Papal Bull]] authorising some limited reforms in the English Church as early as 1518, but reformers (both conservative and radical) had become increasingly frustrated at their lack of progress. Henry wanted to change this, and in November 1529 Parliament passed Acts reforming apparent abuses in the English Church. They set a cap on fees, both for the probate of wills and mortuary expenses for burial in hallowed ground; tightened regulations covering rights of [[sanctuary]] for criminals; and reduced to two the number of church [[benefice]]s that could in future be held by one man. These Acts sought to demonstrate that establishing royal jurisdiction over the Church would ensure progress in "religious reformation" where papal authority had been insufficient.

The monasteries were next in line. J.J. Scarisbrick remarked in his biography of Henry VIII:
{{quote|text=Suffice it to say that English monasticism was a huge and urgent problem; that radical action, though of precisely what kind was another matter, was both necessary and inevitable, and that a purge of the religious orders was probably regarded as the most obvious task of the new regime—as the first function of a Supreme Head empowered by statute "to visit, extirp and redress".&lt;ref&gt;Scarisbrick, p. 337.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cromwell,Thomas(1EEssex)01.jpg|thumb|[[Thomas Cromwell]] by [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Hans Holbein]]: Chief Minister for Henry VIII and [[Vicegerent]] in Spirituals; created the administrative machinery for the Dissolution]]

The stories of monastic impropriety, vice, and excess that were to be collected by [[Thomas Cromwell]]'s visitors to the monasteries may have been biased and exaggerated. But the religious houses of England and Wales—with the notable exceptions of those of the [[Carthusian]]s, the Observant [[Franciscan]]s, and the [[Bridgettine]] nuns and monks—had long ceased to play a leading role in the spiritual life of the country. Other than in these three orders, observance of strict monastic rules was partial at best.&lt;ref&gt;Dickens, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; The exceptional spiritual discipline of the Carthusian, Observant Franciscan and Bridgettine orders had, over the previous century, resulted in their being singled out for royal favour, in particular with houses benefitting from endowments confiscated by the Crown from the suppressed alien priories.

Otherwise in this later period, donations and legacies had tended to go instead towards parish churches, university colleges, grammar schools and collegiate churches, which suggests greater public approbation of such purposes. Levels of monastic debt were increasing, and average numbers of [[professed religious]] were falling,&lt;ref&gt;Dickens, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; although the monasteries continued to attract recruits right up to the end. Only a few monks and nuns lived in conspicuous luxury, but most were very comfortably fed and housed by the standards of the time, and few any longer set standards of ascetic piety or religious observance.&lt;ref&gt;Dickens, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; Only a minority of houses could now support the twelve or thirteen professed religious usually regarded as the minimum necessary to maintain the full [[canonical hours|canonical hours of the Divine Office]]. Even in houses with adequate numbers, the regular obligations of communal eating and shared living had not been fully enforced for centuries, as communities tended to sub-divide into a number of distinct ''familiae''. In most larger houses, the full observance of the Canonical Hours had become the task of a sub-group of 'Cloister Monks', such that the majority of the professed members of the house were freed to conduct their business and live much of their lives in the secular world. Extensive monastic complexes dominated English towns of any size, but most were less than half full.

From 1534 onwards, Cromwell and King Henry were constantly seeking ways to redirect ecclesiastical income to the benefit of the Crown—efforts they justified by contending that much ecclesiastical revenue had been improperly diverted from royal resources in the first place. Renaissance princes throughout Europe were facing severe financial difficulties due to sharply rising expenditures, especially to pay for armies, fighting ships and fortifications. Most tended, sooner or later, to resort to plundering monastic wealth, and to increasing taxation on the clergy. Protestant princes would justify this by claiming divine authority; Catholic princes would obtain the agreement and connivance of the papacy. Monastic wealth, regarded everywhere as excessive and idle, offered a standing temptation for cash-strapped secular and ecclesiastical authorities.

In consequence, almost all official action in respect of the Dissolution in England and Wales was directed at the monasteries and monastic property. The closing of the monasteries aroused popular opposition, but recalcitrant monasteries and abbots became the targets of royal hostility. The surrender of the friaries, from an official perspective, arose almost as an afterthought, as an exercise in administrative tidiness once it had been determined that all religious houses would have to go. In terms of popular esteem, however, the balance tilted the other way. Almost all monasteries supported themselves from their endowments; in late medieval terms 'they lived off their own'. Unless they were notably bad landlords or scandalously neglected those parish churches in their charge, they tended to enjoy widespread local support; particularly as they commonly appointed local notables to fee-bearing offices. The friars, not being self-supporting, were by contrast much more likely to have been the objects of local hostility, especially since their practice of soliciting income through legacies appears often to have been perceived as diminishing anticipated family inheritances.

==English precedents of the Church==
{{main|Alien priory}}
By the time Henry VIII turned his mind to the business of monastery reform, royal action to suppress religious houses had a history of more than 200 years. The first case was that of the so-called [[Alien priory|'Alien Priories']]. As a result of the [[Norman Conquest]], some French religious orders held substantial property through their daughter monasteries in England.

Some of these were merely granges, agricultural estates with a single foreign monk in residence to supervise things; others were rich foundations in their own right. (e.g. [[Lewes Priory]] was a daughter of [[Cluny Abbey|Cluny]] of Paris and answered to the abbot of that great French house).

Owing to the fairly constant state of war between England and France in the Late [[Middle Ages]], successive English governments had objected to money going overseas to France from these Alien Priories, as the hostile French king might get hold of it. They also objected to foreign prelates having jurisdiction over English monasteries.

[[File:StogurseyPriory.JPG|240px|thumb|left|[[Stogursey Priory]] in Somerset; Alien Priory dissolved in 1414 and granted to [[Eton College]]]]Furthermore, after 1378, French monasteries (and hence alien priories dependent on them) maintained allegiance to the continuing [[Avignon Papacy]]. Their suppression was supported by the rival [[Western Schism|Roman Popes]], conditional on all confiscated monastic property eventually being redirected into other religious uses. The king's officers first sequestrated the assets of the Alien Priories in 1295–1303 under [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], and the same thing happened repeatedly for long periods over the course of the 14th century, most particularly in the reign of [[Edward III of England|Edward III]].

Those Alien Priories that had functioning communities were forced to pay large sums to the king, while those that were mere estates were confiscated and run by royal officers, the proceeds going to the king's pocket. Such estates were a valuable source of income for the Crown in its French wars. Most of the larger Alien Priories were allowed to become naturalised (for instance [[Castle Acre Priory]]), on payment of heavy fines and bribes, but for around ninety smaller houses and granges, their fates were sealed when [[Henry V of England|Henry V]] dissolved them by act of Parliament in 1414.

The properties were taken over by the Crown; some were kept, some were subsequently given or sold to Henry's supporters, others were assigned to his new monasteries of [[Syon Abbey]] and the Carthusians at [[Sheen Priory]]; others were used for educational purposes. All these suppressions enjoyed Papal approval. But successive 15th-century popes continued to press for assurances that, now that the Avignon Papacy had been defeated, the confiscated monastic income would revert to religious and educational uses.

The medieval understanding of religious houses as institutions associated monasteries and nunneries with their property; that is to say, their endowments of land and spiritual income, and not with their current personnel of monks and nuns. If the property with which a house had been endowed by its founder were to be confiscated or surrendered, then the house ceased to exist, whether its members continued in the religious life or not. Consequently, the founder, and their heirs, had a continuing (and legally enforceable) interest in certain aspects of the house's functioning; their nomination was required at the election of an abbot or prior, they could claim hospitality within the house when needed, and they could be buried within the house when they died. In addition, though this scarcely ever happened, the endowments of the house would revert to the founder's heirs if the community failed or dissolved. The status of 'founder' was considered in [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]] to be [[real property]]; and could consequently be bought and sold, in which case the purchaser would be termed the [[patron]]. Furthermore, like any other real property, in [[intestacy]] and some other circumstances the status of 'founder' would revert to the Crown; a procedure that many houses actively sought, as it might be advantageous in their legal dealings in the King's courts.

The founders of the Alien Priories had been foreign monasteries refusing allegiance to the English Crown. These property rights were therefore automatically forfeited to the Crown when their English dependencies were dissolved by Act of Parliament. But the example created by these events prompted questions as to what action might be taken should houses of English foundation cease for any reason to exist. Much would depend on who, at the time the house ended, held the status of founder or patron; and, as with other such disputes in real property, the standard procedure was to empanel a jury to decide between disputing claimants. In practice, the Crown claimed the status of 'founder' in all such cases that occurred. Consequently, when a monastic community failed (e.g. through the death of most of its members, or through insolvency), the bishop would seek to obtain Papal approval for alternative use of the house's endowments in [[canon law]]. This, with royal agreement claiming 'foundership', would be presented to an 'empanelled jury' for consent to disposal of the property of the house in civil law.

The royal transfer of alien monastic estates to educational foundations inspired bishops, and as the 15th century waned, they advocated more such actions, which became common. The subjects of these dissolutions were usually small, poor, and indebted [[Benedictine]] or [[Augustinian]] communities (especially those of women) with few powerful friends; the great abbeys and orders exempt from diocesan supervision such as the [[Cistercians]] were unaffected.

[[File:Jesus College Chapel, Cambridge - geograph.org.uk - 168873.jpg|288px|thumb|St Radegund's Priory, Cambridge; dissolved in 1496 and converted into [[Jesus College, Cambridge]]]]
The consequent new foundations were most often [[Oxford|Oxford University]] and [[Cambridge|Cambridge University]] colleges: instances of this include [[John Alcock (bishop)|John Alcock]], [[Bishop of Ely]] dissolving the Benedictine nunnery of [[Saint Radegund]] to found [[Jesus College, Cambridge]] (1496), and [[William Waynflete]], [[Bishop of Winchester]] acquiring [[Selborne Priory]] in Hampshire in 1484 for [[Magdalen College, Oxford]].

In the following century, [[Lady Margaret Beaufort]] obtained the property of [[Creake Abbey]] (whose religious had all died of [[Black Death]] in 1506) to fund her works at Oxford and Cambridge. She was advised in this action by the staunch traditionalist [[John Fisher]], [[Bishop of Rochester]].

In 1522, Fisher himself dissolved the women's monasteries of Bromhall and Higham to aid [[St John's College, Cambridge]]. That same year Cardinal Wolsey dissolved [[St Frideswide's Priory]] (now [[Oxford Cathedral]]) to form the basis of his [[Christ Church, Oxford]]; in 1524, he secured a [[papal bull]] to dissolve some 20 other monasteries to provide an endowment for his new college. In all these suppressions, the remaining friars, monks and nuns were absorbed into other houses of their respective orders. Juries found the property of the house to have reverted to the Crown as founder.

The conventional wisdom of the time was that the proper daily observance of the [[Liturgy of the Hours|Divine Office]] of prayer required a minimum of twelve professed religious, but by the 1530s only a minority of religious houses in England could provide this. Most observers were agreed that a systematic reform of the English church must necessarily involve the drastic concentration of monks and nuns into fewer, larger, houses; potentially making much monastic income available for more productive religious, educational and social purposes.

But this apparent consensus often faced strong resistance in practice. Members of religious houses proposed for dissolution might resist relocation; the houses invited to receive them might refuse to co-operate; and local notables might resist the disruption in their networks of influence. Moreover, reforming bishops found they faced intractable opposition when urging the heads of religious houses to enforce rigorous observation of their monastic rules; especially in respect of requiring monks and nuns to remain within their cloisters. Monks and nuns in almost all late medieval English religious communities, although theoretically living in religious poverty, were nevertheless paid an annual cash wage (''peculium'') and were in receipt of other regular cash rewards and [[pittance]]s; which accorded considerable effective freedom from [[Cloister|claustral]] rules for those disinclined to be restricted by them. Religious superiors met their bishops' pressure with the response that the austere and cloistered ideal was no longer acceptable to more than a tiny minority of regular clergy, and that any attempt on their part to enforce their order's stricter rules could be overturned in counter-actions in the secular courts, were aggrieved monks and nuns to obtain a writ of [[praemunire]].

The King actively supported Wolsey, Fisher and [[Richard Foxe]] in their programmes of monastic reform; but even so, progress was painfully slow, especially where religious orders had been exempted from episcopal oversight by Papal authority. Moreover, it was by no means certain that juries would always find in favour of the Crown in disposing of the property of dissolved houses; any action that impinged on monasteries with substantial assets might be expected to be contested by a range of influential claimants. In 1532, the priory of [[Christchurch Aldgate]], facing financial and legal difficulties, petitioned the King as founder for assistance, only to find themselves dissolved willy-nilly. Rather than risk empanelling a jury, and with Papal participation at this juncture no longer being welcome, the [[Lord Chancellor]], [[Thomas Audley, 1st Baron Audley of Walden|Thomas Audley]] recommended that dissolution should be legalised retrospectively through a special act of Parliament.

==Continental precedents==
While these transactions were going on in England, elsewhere in Europe events were taking place which presaged a storm. In 1521, [[Martin Luther]] had published ''De votis monasticis'' (''On the monastic vows''),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book
| publisher = Melchior Lotter d.J. / World Digital Library
| last = Lutherus
| first = Martinus
| title = On Monastic Vows – De votis monasticis
| accessdate = 1 March 2014
| year = 1521
| url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/9920
}}&lt;/ref&gt; a treatise which declared that the monastic life had no scriptural basis, was pointless and also actively immoral in that it was not compatible with the true spirit of Christianity. Luther also declared that monastic vows were meaningless and that no one should feel bound by them. Luther, a one-time [[Augustinian friar]], found some comfort when these views had a dramatic effect: a special meeting of the German province of his order held the same year accepted them and voted that henceforth every member of the [[regular clergy]] should be free to renounce their vows, resign their offices and marry. At Luther's home monastery in [[Wittenberg]] all the friars, save one, did so.

News of these events did not take long to spread among Protestant-minded rulers across Europe, and some, particularly in Scandinavia, moved very quickly.  In the ''[[Riksdag]]'' of [[Västerås]] in 1527, initiating the [[Reformation in Sweden]], King [[Gustav I of Sweden|Gustavus Vasa]] secured an edict of the Diet allowing him to confiscate any monastic lands he deemed necessary to increase royal revenues, and to allow the return of donated properties to the descendants of those who had donated them, should they wish to retract them.  By the following [[Reduction of Gustav I of Sweden]], Gustav gained large estates, as well as loyal supporters among the nobility who chose to use the permission to retract donations done by their families to the convents.
The Swedish monasteries and convents were simultaneously deprived of their livelihoods.  They were banned from accepting new novices, as well as forbidden to prevent their existing members the leave if they wished to do so.  However, the former monks and nuns were allowed to reside in the convent buildings for life on state allowance, and many of them consequently survived the Reformation for decades.  The last of them was [[Vreta Abbey]], where the last nuns died in 1582, and [[Vadstena Abbey]], from which the last nuns emigrated in 1595, about half a century after the introduction of reformation.

In Denmark, King [[Frederick I of Denmark|Frederick I]] made a similar act in 1528, confiscating 15 of the houses of the wealthiest monasteries and convents. Further laws under his successor over the course of the 1530s banned the friars, and forced monks and nuns to transfer title to their houses to the Crown, which passed them out to supportive nobles, who soon acquired former monastic lands. Danish monastic life was to vanish in a way identical to that of Sweden.

In Switzerland, too, monasteries were under threat. In 1523, the government of the city-state of [[Zurich]] pressured nuns to leave their monasteries and marry, and followed up the next year by dissolving all monasteries in its territory, under the pretext of using their revenues to fund education and help the poor. The city of [[Basel]] followed suit in 1529, and [[Geneva]] adopted the same policy in 1530. An attempt was also made in 1530 to dissolve the famous [[Abbey of St. Gall]], which was a state of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in its own right, but this failed, and St. Gall has survived.

In France and Scotland, by contrast, royal action to seize monastic income proceeded along entirely different lines. In both countries, the practice of nominating abbacies ''in [[commendam]]'' had become widespread. Since the 12th century, it had become universal in Western Europe for the household expenses of abbots and conventual priors to be separated from those of the rest of the monastery, typically appropriating more than half the house's income. With papal approval, these funds might be diverted on a vacancy to support a non-monastic ecclesiastic, commonly a bishop or member of the Papal [[Curia]]; and although such arrangements were nominally temporary, commendatory abbacies often continued long-term. Then, by the [[Concordat of Bologna]] in 1516, [[Pope Leo X]] granted to [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] effective authority to nominate almost all abbots and conventual priors in France. Ultimately around 80 per cent of French abbacies came to be held ''[[in commendam]]'', the commendators often being lay courtiers or royal servants; and by this means around half the income of French monasteries was diverted into the hands of the Crown, or of royal supporters; all entirely with the Popes' blessing. Where the French kings led, the Scots kings followed. In Scotland, where the proportion of parish [[tithe|tiends]] appropriated by higher ecclesiastical institutions exceeded 85 per cent, in 1532 the young [[James V]] obtained from the Pope approval to appoint his illegitimate infant sons (of which he eventually acquired nine), as commendators to abbacies in Scotland. Other Scots aristocratic families were able to strike similar deals, and consequently over £40,000 (Scots) per annum was diverted from monasteries into the royal coffers.

It is inconceivable that these moves went unnoticed by the English government and particularly by Thomas Cromwell, who had been employed by Wolsey in his monastic suppressions, and who was shortly to become Henry VIII's chief minister. However, Henry himself appears to have been much more influenced by the opinions on monasticism of the humanists [[Desiderius Erasmus]] and [[Thomas More]], especially as found in Erasmus's work [[In Praise of Folly]] (1511) and More's [[Utopia (book)|Utopia]] (1516). Erasmus and More promoted ecclesiastical reform while remaining faithful Catholics, and had ridiculed such monastic practices as repetitive formal religion, superstitious pilgrimages for the veneration of relics and the accumulation of monastic wealth. Henry appears from the first to have shared these views, never having endowed a religious house and only once having undertaken a religious pilgrimage (to [[Walsingham]] in 1511). From 1518, Thomas More was increasingly influential as a royal servant and counsellor, in the course of which his correspondence included a series of strong condemnations of the idleness and vice in much monastic life, alongside his equally vituperative attacks on Luther. Henry himself corresponded continually with Erasmus, prompting him to be more explicit in his public rejection of the key tenets of Lutheranism and offering him church preferment should he wish to return to England.

==Process==

===Declaration as Head of the Church===

On famously failing to receive from the Pope a declaration of nullity regarding his marriage, Henry had himself declared [[Supreme Head]] of the Church in England in February 1531, and instigated a programme of legislation to establish this Royal Supremacy in law and enforce its acceptance throughout his realm. In April 1533, an [[Act in Restraint of Appeals]] eliminated the right of clergy to appeal to "foreign tribunals" (Rome) over the King's head in any spiritual or financial matter. All ecclesiastical charges and levies that had previously been payable to Rome, would now go to the King. By the [[Submission of the Clergy]], the English clergy and religious orders subscribed to the proposition that the King was, and had always been, the Supreme Head of the Church in England. Consequently, in Henry's view, any act of monastic resistance to royal authority would not only be treasonable, but also a breach of the monastic [[vow of obedience]]. Under heavy threats, almost all religious houses joined the rest of the Church in acceding to the Royal Supremacy; and in swearing to uphold the validity of the King's divorce and remarriage. Opposition was concentrated in the houses of [[Carthusian]] monks, [[Observant Franciscan]] friars and [[Bridgettine]] monks and nuns, which were, to the Government's embarrassment, exactly those orders where the religious life was acknowledged as being fully observed. Great efforts were made to cajole, bribe, trick and threaten these houses into formal compliance, with those religious who continued in their resistance being liable to imprisonment until they submitted or if they persisted, to execution for treason. All the houses of the Observant Friars were handed over to the mainstream Franciscan order; the friars from the [[Greenwich]] house being imprisoned, where many died from ill-treatment. The Carthusians eventually submitted, other than the monks of the London house, which was suppressed; some of the monks were executed for high treason in 1535, and others starved to death in prison. Also opposing the Supremacy and consequently imprisoned were leading Bridgettine monks from [[Syon Abbey]], although the Syon nuns, being strictly enclosed, escaped sanction at this stage, the personal compliance of the abbess being taken as sufficient for the government's purposes.

G.W.O. Woodward concluded that: {{quote|text=All but a very few took it without demur. They were, after all, Englishmen, and shared the common prejudice of their contemporaries against the pretensions of foreign Italian prelates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Woodward|first=G.W.O.|title=The Dissolution of the Monasteries|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Visitation of the monasteries===

In 1534, Cromwell undertook, on behalf of the King, an inventory of the endowments, liabilities and income of the entire ecclesiastical estate of England and Wales, including the monasteries (see [[Valor Ecclesiasticus]]), for the purpose of assessing the Church's taxable value, through local commissioners who reported in May 1535. At the same time, Henry had [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] authorise Cromwell to [[Canonical visitation|"visit"]] all the [[monasteries]], including those like the Cistercians previously exempted from episcopal oversight by papal dispensation, to purify them in their religious life, and to instruct them in their duty to obey the King and reject [[Pope|Papal]] authority. Cromwell delegated his visitation authority to hand-picked commissioners; chiefly [[Richard Layton]], [[Thomas Legh (died 1545)|Thomas Legh]], [[John ap Rice]] and [[John Tregonwell]]; for the purposes of ascertaining the quality of religious life being maintained in religious houses; of assessing the prevalence of 'superstitious' religious observances such as the veneration of [[relics]]; and for inquiring into evidence of moral laxity (especially sexual). The chosen commissioners were mostly secular clergy, and appear to have been Erasmian in their views, doubtful of the value of monastic life and universally dismissive of relics and miraculous tokens. An objective assessment of the quality of monastic observance in England in the 1530s would almost certainly have been largely negative, but Cromwell did not leave such matters to chance. By comparison with the valuation commissions, the timetable for these monastic visitations was very tight, with some houses missed altogether, and inquiries appear to have concentrated on gross faults and laxity; consequently where the reports of misbehaviour returned by the visitors can be checked against other sources, they commonly appear to have been both rushed and greatly exaggerated, often recalling events and scandals from years before. The visitors interviewed individually each member of the house and selected servants; prompting each one, both to make individual confessions of wrongdoing, and also to inform on one another. From their correspondence with Cromwell it can be seen that the visitors knew that findings of impropriety were both expected and desired; however it is also clear that, where no faults were revealed, none were reported. The visitors put the worst construction they could on whatever they were told, but they do not appear to have fabricated allegations of wrongdoing outright.

===Reports and further visitations===
[[File:Altarpiece fragments late 1300 early 1400 destroyed during the English Dissolution mid 16th century.jpg|thumb|Altarpiece fragments (late 1300 – early 1400) destroyed during the English Dissolution, mid-16th century.]]
In the autumn of 1535, the visiting commissioners were sending back to Cromwell written reports of all the lurid doings they claimed to have discovered; enclosing with them bundles of purported miraculous wimples, girdles and mantles that monks and nuns had been lending out for cash to the sick, or to mothers in labour. The commissioners appear consistently to have instructed houses to reintroduce the strict practice of common dining and cloistered living, urging that those unable to comply should be encouraged to leave; and considerable numbers appear to have taken up the opportunity offered to be released from their monastic vows, so as to make a life elsewhere. The visitors reported the number of professed religious persons continuing in each house. In the case of seven houses, impropriety or irreligion had been so great, or the numbers remaining so few, that the commissioners had felt compelled to suppress it on the spot; in others, the abbot, prior or noble patron was reported to be petitioning the King for a house to be dissolved. Such authority had formerly rested with the Pope, but now the King would need to establish a legal basis for dissolution in statutory law. Moreover, it was by no means clear that the property of a surrendered house would automatically be at the disposal of the Crown; a good case could be made for this property to revert to the heirs and descendants of the founder or other patron. Accordingly, Parliament enacted the [[Suppression of Religious Houses Act 1535]] ("Dissolution of the Lesser Monasteries Act") in early 1535, relying in large part on the reports of "impropriety" Cromwell had received, establishing the power of the King to dissolve religious houses that were failing to maintain a religious life, consequently providing for the King to compulsorily dissolve monasteries with annual incomes declared in the Valor Ecclesiasticus of less than £200 (of which there were potentially 419) but also giving the King the discretion to exempt any of these houses from dissolution at his pleasure. All property of the dissolved house would revert to the Crown. Accordingly, many monasteries falling below the threshold forwarded a case for continuation, offering to pay substantial fines in recompense. Many such cases were accepted, so that only around 330 were referred to suppression commissions, and only 243 houses were actually dissolved at this time. The choice of a £200 threshold as the criterion for general dissolution under the legislation has been queried, as this does not appear to correspond to any clear distinction in the quality of religious life reported in the visitation reports, and the preamble to the legislation refers to numbers rather than income. Adopting a financial criterion was most likely determined pragmatically; the Valor Ecclesiasticus returns being both more reliable and more complete than those of Cromwell's visitors.

[[File:DorchesterAbbey Interior Nave&amp;EastWindow.JPG|thumb|left|[[Dorchester Abbey]] in Oxfordshire; a smaller house with a net income below £200-year, dissolved in 1536 and purchased for a parish church]]
The smaller houses identified for suppression were then visited during 1536 by a further set of local commissions, one for each county, charged with creating an inventory of assets and valuables, and empowered to obtain prompt co-operation from monastic superiors by the allocation to them of pensions and cash gratuities. It was envisaged that some houses might offer immediate surrender, but in practice few did; consequently a two-stage procedure was applied, the commissions reporting back to Cromwell for a decision as to whether to proceed with dissolution. In a number of instances these commissioners supported the continuation of a house where they found no serious current cause for concern; arguments that Cromwell, as vicegerent, appears often to have accepted. Around 80 houses were exempted, mostly offering a substantial fine. Where dissolution was determined on, a second visit would effect the arrangements for closure of the house, disposal of its assets and endowments and provisions for the future of the members of the house; otherwise the second visit would collect the agreed fine. In general, the suppression commissioners were less inclined to report serious faults in monastic observance within the smaller houses than the visiting commissioners had been, although this may have been coloured by an awareness that monks and nuns with a bad reputation would be more difficult to place elsewhere. The 1536 Act established that, whatever the claims of founders or patrons, the property of the dissolved smaller houses reverted to the Crown; and Cromwell established a new government agency, the [[Court of Augmentations]], to manage it. However, although the property rights of lay founders and patrons were legally extinguished; the incomes of lay holders of monastic offices, pensions and annuities were generally preserved; as were the rights of tenants of monastic lands. Ordinary monks and nuns were given the choice of secularisation (with a cash gratuity but no pension), or of transfer to a continuing larger house of the same order. The majority of those then remaining chose to continue in the religious life; in some areas, the premises of a suppressed religious house was recycled into a new foundation to accommodate them, and in general, rehousing those seeking a transfer proved much more difficult and time-consuming than appears to have been anticipated. Two houses, [[Norton Priory]] in Cheshire, and [[Hexham Abbey]] in Northumberland, attempted to resist the commissioners by force; actions which Henry interpreted as treason, resulting in his writing personally to demand the summary brutal punishment of those responsible. The prior and canons of Norton were imprisoned for several months, and were fortunate to escape with their lives; the monks of Hexham, who made the further mistake of becoming involved in the [[Pilgrimage of Grace]], were executed.{{-}}

===Initial round of suppressions===
[[File:BridlingtonPriory.JPG|thumb|right|[[Bridlington Priory]] in Yorkshire; dissolved in 1537 due to the [[attainder]] of the prior for treason following the [[Pilgrimage of Grace]]]] The first round of suppressions initially aroused considerable popular discontent, especially in Lincolnshire and Yorkshire, where they contributed to the [[Pilgrimage of Grace]] of 1536, an event which led to Henry increasingly associating monasticism with betrayal, as some of the spared religious houses in the north of England (more or less willingly) sided with the rebels; while former monks resumed religious life in several of the suppressed houses. Clauses within the [[Treasons Act 1534]] provided that the property of those convicted of treason would automatically revert to the Crown; clauses that Cromwell had presciently drafted with the intention of effecting the dissolution of religious houses whose heads were so convicted, arguing that the superior of the house (abbot, abbess, prior or prioress) was the legal "owner" of all its monastic property. The wording of the First Suppression Act had been clear that reform, not outright abolition of monastic life, was being presented to the public as the objective of the legislative policy; and there is a continuing academic debate as to whether a universal dissolution was nevertheless being covertly prepared for at this point. The predominant academic opinion is that the extensive care taken to provide for monks and nuns from the suppressed houses to transfer to continuing houses, demonstrates that monastic reform was still, at least in the mind of the King, the guiding principle; but that further large-scale action against richer monasteries was always envisaged. By definition, the selection of poorer houses for dissolution in the First Act minimised the potential release of funds to other purposes; and once pensions had been committed to former superiors, cash rewards paid to those wishing to leave, and appropriate funding allocated for refounded houses receiving transferred monks and nuns, it is unlikely that there was much if any profit at this stage other than from the fines levied on exempted houses. Nevertheless, there was during most of 1537 (possibly conditioned by concern not to re-ignite rebellious impulses), a distinct standstill in official action towards any further round of dissolutions.  [[Episcopal visitation]]s were renewed, monasteries adapted their internal discipline in accordance with Cromwell's injunctions, and many houses undertook overdue programmes of repair and reconstruction.

The remaining monasteries required funds, especially those facing a new need to pay fines for exemption.  During 1537 and 1538, there was a large increase in monastic lands and endowments being leased out; and in lay notables being offered fee-paying offices and annuities in return for cash and favours. By establishing additional long-term liabilities, these actions diminished the eventual net return to the Crown from each house's endowments; but they were not officially discouraged; indeed Cromwell obtained and solicited many such fees in his own personal favour. Crucially, having created the precedent that tenants and lay recipients of monastic incomes might expect to have their interests recognised by the Court of Augmentations following dissolution, the government's apparent acquiescence to the granting of additional such rights and fees helped establish a predisposition towards dissolution amongst local notables and landed interests. At the same time however, and especially once the loss of income from shrines and pilgrimages was taken into account, the long-term financial sustainability of many of the remaining houses was increasingly in question.

[[File:Furness Abbey - geograph.org.uk - 42919.jpg|240px|thumb|left|[[Furness Abbey]] in Cumbria; dissolved in 1537 and the first of the larger houses to be dissolved by voluntary surrender]]
Although Henry continued for a while to maintain that his sole objective was monastic reform, it became increasingly clear, from around the late summer of 1537, that official policy was now envisaging the total extinction of monasticism in England and Wales; but that this extinction was now expected to be achieved through individual applications from superiors for voluntary surrender rather than through a systematic statutory dissolution. [[Hugh Latimer]], appointed bishop of [[Worcester]] in 1535, and a reformer with pronounced [[Lutheran]] sympathies, had successfully encouraged the wealthier monasteries in his diocese to provide active support in preaching, prayer and charity to their local communities. Latimer wrote to Cromwell in 1538 to plead for the continuation of [[Great Malvern Priory]], and of "two or three in every shire of such remedy", but by then only total surrender was acceptable. One major Abbey whose monks had been implicated in the Pilgrimage of Grace was that of [[Furness]] in Lancashire; the abbot, fearful of a treason charge, petitioned to be allowed to make a voluntary surrender of his house, which Cromwell happily approved. From then on, all dissolutions that were not a consequence of convictions for treason, were legally "voluntary"—a principle that was taken a stage further with the voluntary surrender of [[Lewes]] priory in November 1537; when, as at Furness, the monks and were not accorded the option of transfer to another house, but with the additional motivating consideration that this time (and on all future occasions) ordinary monks were offered life pensions if they co-operated. This created a pairing of positive and negative incentives in favour of further dissolution: Abbots and priors came under pressure from their communities to petition for voluntary surrender, if they could obtain favourable terms for pensions; while also knowing that if they refused to surrender, they might suffer the penalty for treason; and their religious house would be dissolved anyway. Where the King had been able to establish himself as founder, he exploited his position to place compliant monks and nuns as the head of the house; while non-royal patrons and founders also tended to press superiors for an early surrender; hoping thereby to get preferential treatment in the disposal of monastic rights and properties. From the beginning of 1538, Cromwell targeted the houses that he knew to be wavering in their resolve to continue; cajoling and bullying their superiors to apply for surrender. Nevertheless, the public stance of the government was that the better-run houses could still expect to survive, and Cromwell dispatched a circular letter in March 1538 condemning false rumours of a general policy of dissolution; while also warning superiors against asset-stripping or concealment of valuables, which could be construed as treasonable action.

===Second round of dissolutions===
As 1538 proceeded, applications for surrender flooded in. Cromwell appointed a local commissioner in each case to ensure rapid compliance with the King's wishes, to supervise the orderly sale of monastic goods and buildings, to dispose of monastic endowments, and to ensure that the former monks and nuns were provided with pensions, cash gratuities and clothing. The second time round, the process proved to be much quicker and easier. Existing tenants would have their tenancies continued, and lay office holders would continue to receive their incomes and fees (even though they now had no duties or obligations). Monks or nuns who were aged, handicapped or infirm were marked out for more generous pensions, and care was taken throughout that there should be nobody cast out of their place unprovided for (who might otherwise have increased the burden of charity for local parishes). In a few instances, even monastic servants were provided with a year's wages on discharge.

The endowments of the monasteries, landed property and appropriated parish [[tithes]] and [[glebe]], were transferred to the [[Court of Augmentations]], who would thereon pay out life pensions and fees at the agreed rate; subject to the court's fee of 4d in the pound, plus in most years the clerical 'Tenth', a 10 per cent tax deduction on clergy incomes. Pensions averaged around £5 per annum before tax for monks, with those for superiors typically assessed at 10 per cent of the net annual income of the house; and were not reduced if the pensioner obtained other employment. If, however, the pensioner accepted a royal appointment or benefice of greater annual value than their pension, the pension would be extinguished. In 1538, £5 compared with the annual wages of a skilled worker; and although the real value of such a fixed income would suffer through inflation, it remained a significant sum; all the more welcome as prompt payment could mostly be relied upon. Pensions granted to nuns were notably less generous, averaging around £3 per annum. During Henry's reign, former nuns, like monks, continued to be forbidden to marry, therefore it is more possible that genuine hardship resulted, especially as former nuns had little access to opportunities for gainful employment. Where nuns came from well-born families, as many did, they seem commonly to have returned to live with their relatives. Otherwise, there were a number of instances where former nuns of a house clubbed together in a shared household. Moreover, there were no retrospective pensions for those monks or nuns who had already sought secularisation following the 1535 visitation, nor for those members of the smaller houses dissolved in 1536 and 1537 who had not then remained in the religious life, nor for those houses dissolved before 1538 due to the conviction for treason of their superior, and no friars were pensioned.

===Later dissolutions===
None of this process of legislation and visitation had applied to the houses of the [[friars]]. At the beginning of the 14th century there had been around 5,000 friars in England, occupying extensive complexes in all towns of any size.  There were still around 200 friaries in England at the dissolution. But, except for the Observant Franciscans, by the 16th century the friars' income from donations had collapsed, their numbers had shrunk to less than 1,000 and their conventual buildings were often ruinous or leased out commercially, as too were their enclosed vegetable gardens. No longer self-sufficient in food and with their cloistered spaces invaded by secular tenants, almost all friars, in contravention of their rules, were now living in rented lodgings outside their friaries gathering collectively for divine service in the friary church.  Many friars now supported themselves through paid employment and held personal property.

By early 1538, suppression of the friaries was widely being anticipated, in some houses all friars save the prior had already left; and realisable assets (standing timber, chalices, vestments) were being sold off.  Cromwell deputed [[Richard Yngworth]], suffragan [[Bishop of Dover]] and former Provincial of the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]], to obtain the friars' surrender; which he achieved rapidly by drafting new injunctions that enforced each order's rules and required friars to resume a strict conventual life within their walls. In effect, failure to accede to the king's wish for voluntary surrender would result, for most, in enforced homelessness and starvation. Once surrender had been accepted, and formally witnessed, Yngworth reported briefly to Cromwell on his actions; noting for each friary, who was the current tenant of the gardens, what was the general state of the friary buildings, and whether the friary church had valuable lead on roofs and gutters. Mostly he had found poverty, derelict buildings and leased-out gardens as the only income-bearing asset. Yngworth had no authority to dispose of lands and property and could not negotiate pensions; so the friars appear simply to have been released from their vows and dismissed with a gratuity of around 40 shillings each, which Yngworth took from whatever cash resources were in hand. He listed by name the friars remaining in each house at surrender so that Cromwell could provide them with capacities, legal permission to pursue a career as a secular priest. Furthermore, Yngworth had no discretion to maintain use of the friary churches, even though many had continued to attract congregations for preaching and worship; and these mostly were disposed of rapidly by the Court of Augmentations. Of all the friary churches in England and Wales, only [[St. Andrew's Hall, Norwich]], [[Atherstone Priory]] in Warwickshire, the [[Chichester Guildhall]], and [[Greyfriars Church, Reading|Greyfriars Church]] in [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] remain standing (although the London church of the [[Austin Friars, London|Austin Friars]] continued in use by the [[Dutch Church, Austin Friars|Dutch Church]] until destroyed in the [[London Blitz]]). Almost all other friaries have disappeared with few visible traces.&lt;ref&gt;Salter, M. ''Medieval English Friaries''. 2010. Malvern: Folly Publications. {{ISBN|978-1-871731-87-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:visitation monasteries.JPG|thumb|The suppression of [[St John's Abbey, Colchester]], with the execution of the abbot shown in the background]]
In April 1539, Parliament passed a new law retrospectively legalising acts of voluntary surrender and assuring tenants of their continued rights, but by then the vast majority of monasteries in England, and Wales had already been dissolved. Some still resisted, and that autumn the [[abbot]]s of [[St John's Abbey, Colchester|Colchester]], [[Glastonbury Abbey|Glastonbury]], and [[Reading Abbey|Reading]] were [[hanged, drawn and quartered]] for [[treason]], their houses being dissolved and their monks, on these occasions, receiving a basic pension of £4-year. [[St. Benet's Abbey]] in Norfolk was the only abbey in England which escaped formal dissolution. As the last abbot had been appointed to the see of [[Norwich]], the abbey endowments were transferred alongside him directly into those of the bishops. The last two abbeys to be dissolved were [[Shap Abbey]], in January 1540, and [[Waltham Abbey Church|Waltham Abbey]], on 23 March 1540, and several priories also survived into 1540, including [[Bolton Priory]] in Yorkshire (dissolved 29 January 1540) and [[Thetford Priory]] in Norfolk (dissolved 16 February 1540). It was not until April 1540, that the cathedral priories of [[Canterbury Cathedral|Canterbury]] and [[Rochester Cathedral|Rochester]] were transformed into secular cathedral chapters.

===Effects on public life===
{{main|List of English abbeys, priories and friaries serving as parish churches}}
The surrender of monastic endowments was recognised automatically as terminating all regular religious observance by its members; except in the case of a few communities, such as Syon, who went into exile. There are several recorded instances where groups of former members of a house set up residence together, but no cases where an entire community did so; and there is no indication that any such groups continued to pray the Divine Office. The dissolution Acts were concerned solely with the disposal of endowed property, at no point do they explicitly forbid the continuance of a regular life. However, given Henry's attitude to those religious who resumed their houses during the Pilgrimage of Grace, it would have been most unwise of any former community of monks or nuns within his dominions to have maintained covert monastic observance.

[[File:Selby Abbey Nave.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Selby Abbey]] in Yorkshire, Benedictine abbey, purchased by the town as a parish church]]
The local commissioners were instructed to ensure that, where portions of abbey churches were also used by local parishes or congregations, this use should continue. Accordingly, parts of [[List of English abbeys, priories and friaries serving as parish churches|114 former monastic churches]] survived (and mostly still remain) in use for parochial worship, in addition to the fourteen former monastic churches that survived in their entirety as cathedrals. In around a dozen instances, wealthy benefactors or parishes purchased a complete former monastic church from the commissioners, and presented it to their local community as a new parish church building. Many other parishes bought and installed former monastic woodwork, choir stalls and stained glass windows. As it was commonly the case, by the late medieval period, that the abbot's lodging had been expanded to form a substantial independent residence, these properties were frequently converted into country houses by lay purchasers. In other cases, such as [[Lacock Abbey]] and [[Forde Abbey]], the conventual buildings themselves were converted to form the core of a Tudor great mansion. Otherwise the most marketable fabric in monastic buildings was likely to be the lead on roofs, gutters and plumbing, and buildings were burned down as the easiest way to extract this. Building stone and slate roofs were sold off to the highest bidder. Many monastic outbuildings were turned into granaries, barns and stables. Cromwell had already instigated a campaign against "superstitions": pilgrimages and veneration of saints, in the course of which, ancient and precious valuables were grabbed and melted down; the tombs of saints and kings ransacked for whatever profit could be got from them, and their [[relics]] destroyed or dispersed. Even the crypt of King [[Alfred the Great]] was not spared the looting frenzy. Great abbeys and priories like [[Glastonbury Abbey|Glastonbury]], [[Walsingham Priory|Walsingham]], [[Bury St. Edmunds Abbey|Bury St. Edmunds]], and [[Shaftesbury Abbey|Shaftesbury]] which had flourished as pilgrimage sites for many centuries, were soon reduced to ruins. However, the tradition that there was widespread mob action resulting in destruction and [[iconoclasm]], that [[altar]]s and [[window]]s were smashed, partly confuses the looting spree of the 1530s with the vandalism wrought by the [[Puritans]] in the next century against the Anglican privileges. Woodward concludes:
{{quote|text=There was no general policy of destruction, except in [[Lincolnshire]] where the local government agent was so determined that the monasteries should never be restored that he razed as many as he could to the ground.  More often, the buildings have simply suffered from unroofing and neglect, or by quarrying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Woodward|first=G.W.O.|title=The Dissolution of the Monasteries|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Once the new and re-founded cathedrals and other endowments had been provided for, the Crown became richer to the extent of around £150,000 ({{Inflation|UK|150000|1538|r=-2|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}),{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} per year, although around £50,000 ({{Inflation|UK|50000|1538|r=-2|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}){{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} of this was initially committed to fund monastic pensions. Cromwell had intended that the bulk of this wealth should serve as regular income of government. However, after Cromwell's fall in 1540, Henry needed money quickly to fund his military ambitions in France and Scotland; and so monastic property was sold off, representing by 1547 an annual value of £90,000 ({{Inflation|UK|90000|1547|r=-3|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}).{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} Lands and endowments were not offered for sale, let alone auctioned; instead the government responded to applications for purchase, of which had indeed been a continual flood ever since the process of dissolution got under way. Many applicants had been founders or patrons of the relevant houses, and could expect to be successful subject to paying the standard market rate of twenty years' income. Purchasers were predominantly leading nobles, local magnates and gentry; with no discernible tendency in terms of conservative or reformed religion, other than a determination to maintain and extend their family's position and local status. The landed property of the former monasteries included large numbers of manorial estates, each carrying the right and duty to hold a court for tenants and others. Acquiring such feudal rights was regarded as essential to establish a family in the status and dignity of the late medieval gentry; but for a long period freehold manorial estates had been very rare in the market; and families of all kinds seized on the opportunity now offered to entrench their position in the social scale. Nothing would subsequently induce them to surrender their new acquisitions. The Court of Augmentations retained lands and spiritual income sufficient to meet its continuing obligations to pay annual pensions; but as pensioners died off, or as pensions were extinguished when their holders accepted a royal appointment of higher value, then surplus property became available each year for further disposal. The last surviving monks continued to draw their pensions into the reign of [[James I of England|James I]] (1603–1625), more than 60 years after the dissolution's end.

The Dissolution of the Monasteries impinged relatively little on English parish church activity. Parishes that had formerly paid their tithes to support a religious house, now paid them to a lay [[Appropriation (law)|impropriator]], but rectors, vicars and other incumbents remained in place, their incomes unaffected and their duties unchanged. Congregations that had shared monastic churches for worship continued to do so; the former monastic parts now walled off and derelict. Most parish churches had been endowed with [[chantry|chantries]], each maintaining a [[stipend]]ed priest to say [[mass (liturgy)|mass]] for the souls of their donors, and these continued for the moment unaffected. In addition there remained after the dissolution of the monasteries, over a hundred [[collegiate church]]es in England, whose endowments maintained regular choral worship through a corporate body of [[canon (priest)|canons]], [[prebend]]s or priests. All these survived the reign of Henry VIII largely intact, only to be dissolved under the [[Chantry#Abolition of Chantries Acts, 1545 and 1547|Chantries Act]] of 1547, by Henry's son [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]], their property being absorbed into the Court of Augmentations, and their members being added to the pensions list. Since many former monks had found employment as chantry priests, the consequence for these clerics was a double experience of dissolution, perhaps mitigated by being in receipt thereafter of a double pension.{{-}}

The dissolutions in Ireland followed a very different course from those in England and Wales. There were around 400 religious houses in Ireland in 1530—many more, relative to population and material wealth than in England and Wales. In marked distinction to the situation in England, in Ireland the houses of friars had flourished in the 15th century, attracting popular support and [[financial endowment]]s, undertaking many ambitious building schemes, and maintaining a regular conventual and spiritual life. They constituted around half of the total number of religious houses. Irish monasteries, by contrast, had experienced a catastrophic decline in numbers of professed religious, such that by the 16th century only a minority maintained the daily observance of the Divine Office. Henry's direct authority, as [[Lord of Ireland]] and from 1541 as [[King of Ireland]], only extended to the area of [[the Pale]] immediately around [[Dublin]]. Outside this area, he could only proceed by tactical agreement with clan chiefs and local lords.

Nevertheless, Henry was determined to carry through a policy of dissolution in Ireland—and in 1537 introduced legislation into the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] to legalise the closure of monasteries. The process faced considerable opposition, and only sixteen houses were suppressed. Henry remained resolute however, and from 1541 as part of the [[Tudor conquest of Ireland]] he continued to press for the area of successful dissolution to be extended. For the most part, this involved making deals with local lords, under which monastic property was granted away in exchange for allegiance to the [[Kingdom of Ireland|new Irish Crown]]; and consequently Henry acquired little if any of the wealth of the Irish houses. By the time of Henry's death (1547) around half of the Irish houses had been suppressed; but many continued to resist dissolution until well into the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], and some houses in the West of Ireland remained active until the early 17th century. In 1649, [[Oliver Cromwell]] led a Parliamentary army seeking to subjugate Ireland, and systematically sought out and destroyed former monastic houses. Subsequently, however, sympathetic landowners housed monks or friars close to several ruined religious houses, allowing them a continued covert existence during the 17th and 18th centuries, subject to the dangers of discovery and legal ejection or imprisonment.{{-}}

==Consequences==

===Social and economic===
[[File:Fountains Abbey.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Ruins of [[Fountains Abbey]], Yorkshire]]
The abbeys of England, Wales and Ireland had been among the greatest landowners and the largest institutions in the kingdoms, although by the early 16th century, religious donors increasingly tended to favour parish churches, collegiate churches, university colleges and grammar schools, and these were now the predominant centres for learning and the arts. Nevertheless, and particularly in areas far from London, the abbeys, convents and priories were centres of hospitality and learning, and everywhere they remained a main source of charity for the old and infirm. The removal of over eight hundred such institutions, virtually overnight, rent great gaps in the social fabric.

In addition, about a quarter of net monastic wealth on average consisted of "spiritual" income arising where the religious house held the [[advowson]] of a [[benefice]] with the legal obligation to maintain the cure of souls in the parish, originally by nominating the [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] and taking an annual rental payment. Over the medieval period, monasteries and priories continually sought papal exemptions, so as to appropriate the glebe and tithe income of rectoral benefices in their possession to their own use. However, from the 13th century onwards, English diocesan bishops successfully established the principle that only the glebe and 'greater tithes' of grain, hay and wood could be appropriated by monastic patrons in this manner; the 'lesser tithes' had to remain within the parochial benefice; the incumbent of which thenceforward carried the title of 'vicar'.&lt;ref&gt;Knowles, David ''The Religious Orders in England, Vol II'' Cambridge University Press, 1955, p.290&lt;/ref&gt; By 1535, of 8,838 rectories, 3,307 had thus been appropriated with vicarages;&lt;ref&gt;Knowles, David ''The Religious Orders in England, Vol II'' Cambridge University Press, 1955, p.291&lt;/ref&gt; but at this late date, a small sub-set of vicarages in monastic ownership were not being served by [[benefice]]d clergy at all. In almost all such instances, these were parish churches in the ownership of houses of [[Canons Regular|Augustinian]] or [[Premonstratensian]] canons, orders whose rules required them to provide parochial worship within their conventual churches; for the most part as chapels of ease of a more distant parish church. From the mid-fourteenth century onwards the canons had been able to exploit their hybrid status to justify petitions for papal privileges of appropriation, allowing them to fill vicarages in their possession either from among their own number, or from secular stipendiary priests removable at will; arrangements which corresponded to those for their chapels of ease.&lt;ref&gt;Knowles, David ''The Religious Orders in England, Vol II'' Cambridge University Press, 1955, p.292&lt;/ref&gt;

On the dissolution these spiritual income streams were sold off on the same basis as landed endowments, creating a new class of lay [[impropriation|impropriators]], who thereby became entitled to the patronage of the living together with the income from tithes and [[glebe]] lands; albeit that they also as lay [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rectors]] became liable to maintain the fabric of the parish chancel. The existing incumbent rectors and vicars serving parish churches formerly the property of the monasteries continued in post, their incomes unaffected. However, in those of the canons' parish churches and chapels of ease which had become unbeneficed, the lay rector as patron, was additionally obliged to establish a stipend for a [[perpetual curate]].

It is unlikely that the monastic system could have been broken simply by royal action had there not been the overwhelming bait of enhanced status for [[gentry]] large and small, and the convictions of the small but determined Protestant faction. [[Anti-clericalism]] was a familiar feature of late medieval Europe, producing its own strain of satiric literature that was aimed at a literate middle class.&lt;ref&gt;For background on [[Chaucer]]'s Pardoner and other Chaucerian anticlerical satire, see John Peter, ''Complaint and Satire in Early English Literature''. (Oxford: Clarendon Press), 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arts and culture===
Along with the destruction of the monasteries, some of them many hundreds of years old, the related destruction of the monastic [[library|libraries]] was perhaps the greatest cultural loss caused by the English Reformation. [[Worcester Cathedral|Worcester Priory (now Worcester Cathedral)]] had 600 books at the time of the dissolution. Only six of them are known to have survived intact to the present day. At the abbey of the Augustinian Friars at York, a library of 646 volumes was destroyed, leaving only three known survivors. Some books were destroyed for their precious bindings, others were sold off by the cartload. The antiquarian [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]] was commissioned by the King to rescue items of particular interest (especially manuscript sources of Old English history), and other collections were made by private individuals; notably [[Matthew Parker]]. Nevertheless, much was lost, especially manuscript books of English church music, none of which had then been printed.

===Health and education===
The Act of 1539 also provided for the suppression of religious hospitals; which had constituted in England a distinct class of institution, endowed for the purpose of caring for older people. A very few of these, such as [[Saint Bartholomew's Hospital]] in London (which still exists, though under a different name between 1546 and 1948), were exempted by special royal dispensation, but most closed, their residents being discharged with small pensions.

Monasteries had also supplied free food and alms for the poor and destitute, and it has been argued that the removal of this and other charitable resources, amounting to about 5 per cent of net monastic income, was one of the factors in the creation of the army of "[[sturdy beggar]]s" that plagued late Tudor England, causing the social instability that led to the Edwardian and Elizabethan [[English Poor Laws|Poor Laws]]. This argument has been disputed, for example, by G.W.O. Woodward, who summarises:
{{quote|text=No great host of beggars was suddenly thrown on the roads for monastic charity had had only marginal significance and, even had the abbeys been allowed to remain, could scarcely have coped with the problems of unemployment and poverty created by the population and inflationary pressures of the middle and latter parts of the sixteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Woodward|first=G.W.O.|title=The Dissolution of the Monasteries|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Monasteries had necessarily undertaken schooling for their [[novice]] members, which in the later medieval period had tended to extend to cover [[choir|choristers]] and sometimes other younger scholars; and all this educational resource was lost with their dissolution. By contrast, where monasteries had provided [[grammar school]]s for older scholars, these were commonly refounded with enhanced endowments; some by royal command in connection with the newly re-established cathedral churches, others by private initiative. Monastic orders had maintained, for the education of their members, six colleges at the universities of Oxford or Cambridge; of which five survived as refoundations. Hospitals too were frequently to be re-endowed by private benefactors; and many new almshouses and charities were to be founded by the Elizabethan gentry and professional classes ([[London Charterhouse]]/[[Charterhouse School]] being an example which still survives). Nevertheless, it has been estimated that only in 1580 did overall levels of charitable giving in England return to those before the dissolution. On the eve of the overthrow, the various monasteries owned approximately 2,000,000 acres (just under 8&amp;nbsp;100&amp;nbsp;km²), over 16 percent of England, with tens of thousands of tenant farmers working those lands; some of whom had family ties to a particular monastery going back many generations.

===Religion===
It has been argued{{by whom|date=February 2014}} that the suppression of the English monasteries and nunneries contributed as well to the spreading decline of that contemplative spirituality which once thrived in Europe, with the occasional exception found only in groups such as the [[Religious Society of Friends|Society of Friends]] ("Quakers"). This may be set against the continuation in the retained and newly established cathedrals of the daily singing of the [[Liturgy of the Hours|Divine Office]] by choristers and vicars choral, now undertaken as public worship, which had not been the case before the dissolution. The deans and prebends of the six new cathedrals were overwhelmingly former heads of religious houses. The secularised former monks and friars commonly looked for re-employment as parish clergy; and consequently numbers of new ordinations dropped drastically in the ten years after the dissolution, and ceased almost entirely in the reign of Edward VI. It was only in 1549, after Edward came to the throne, that former monks and nuns were permitted to marry; but within a year of the permission being granted around a quarter had done so, only to find themselves forcibly separated (and denied their pensions) in the reign of Mary. On the succession of Elizabeth, these former monks and friars (happily reunited both with their wives and their pensions) formed a major part of the backbone of the new Anglican church, and may properly claim much credit for maintaining the religious life of the country until a new generation of ordinands became available in the 1560s and 1570s.

In the medieval church, there had been no [[seminaries]] or other institutions dedicated to training men as parish clergy. Aspiring candidates for [[ordination]], having acquired a [[grammar school]] education and appropriate experience, would have been presented to the bishop's commissary for examination; typically sponsored in this by an ecclesiastical corporation, which provided them with a 'title', a notional patrimony assuring the bishop of their financial security. By the 16th century the sponsors were overwhelmingly religious houses, although monasteries provided no formal parochial training, and the financial 'title' was a legal fiction. With the rapid expansion of grammar school provision in the late medieval period, the numbers of men being presented each year for ordination greatly exceeded the number of [[benefices]] falling vacant through the death of their incumbent priest, and consequently most newly ordained parish clergy could commonly expect to succeed to a benefice, if at all, only after many years as a mass priest of low social standing.

In the knowledge that alternative arrangements for sponsorship and title would now need to be made, the dissolution legislation provided that the lay and ecclesiastical successors of the monks in former monastic endowments could in the future provide valid title for ordinands. However, these new arrangements appear to have taken a considerable period to gain general acceptance; while the circumstances of the church in the late 1530s may not have encouraged candidates to come forward. Consequently, and for 20 years afterwards until the succession of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], the number of ordinands in every diocese in England and Wales fell drastically below the numbers required to replace the mortality of existing incumbents. At the same time, the restrictions on 'pluralism' introduced through legislation in 1529 prevented the accumulation of multiple benefices by individual clergy, and accordingly by 1559 some 10 per cent of benefices were vacant and the former reserve army of mass priests had largely been absorbed into the ranks of beneficed clergy. Monastic successors tended thereafter to prefer to sponsor university graduates as candidates for the priesthood; and, although the government signally failed to respond to the consequent need for expanded educational provision, individual benefactors stepped into the breach, with the refoundation as university colleges of five out of the six former monastic colleges of Oxford and Cambridge; while [[Jesus College, Oxford]] and [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]] were newly founded with the express purpose of educating a Protestant parish clergy. Consequently, one unintended long-term consequence of the dissolution was the transformation of the parish clergy in England and Wales into an educated professional class of secure beneficed incumbents of distinctly higher social standing; one that furthermore, through intermarriage of one another's children, became substantially self-perpetuating.

[[File:1stLordRich.jpg|thumb|left|240px|upright|[[Richard Rich]], first chancellor of the [[Court of Augmentations]], established to manage the endowments of former monasteries and pay pensions]]
Although it had been promised that the King's enhanced wealth would enable the founding or enhanced endowment of religious, charitable and educational institutions, in practice only about 15 per cent of the total monastic wealth was reused for these purposes. This comprised: the refoundation of eight out of ten former monastic cathedrals ([[Coventry cathedral|Coventry]] and [[Bath Abbey|Bath]] being the exceptions), together with six wholly new bishoprics ([[Bristol]], [[Chester]], [[Gloucester]], [[Oxford]], [[Peterborough]], [[Westminster Abbey|Westminster]]) with their associated cathedrals, chapters, choirs and grammar schools; the refoundation as secular colleges of monastic houses in [[Brecon]], [[Thornton Abbey|Thornton]] and [[Burton on Trent]], the endowment of five [[Regius Professor]]ships in each of the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, the endowment of the colleges of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], and [[Christ Church, Oxford]] and the maritime charity of [[Trinity House]]. [[Thomas Cranmer]] objected to the provision of the new cathedrals with complete chapters of [[prebend]]aries at high salaries, but in the face of pressure to ensure that well-paid posts would continue, his protests had no effect. On the other hand, Cranmer was able to ensure that the new grammar schools attached both to 'New Foundation' and 'Old Foundation' cathedrals should be well funded, and accessible to boys from all walks of life. About a third of total monastic income was required to maintain pension payments to former monks and nuns, and hence remained with the Court of Augmentations. This left just over half to be available to be sold at market rates (very little property was given away by Henry to favoured servants, and any that was tended to revert to the Crown once their recipients fell out of favour, and were indicted for treason). By comparison with the forcible closure of monasteries elsewhere in Protestant Europe, the English and Welsh dissolutions resulted in a relatively modest volume of new educational endowments; but the treatment of former monks and nuns was more generous, and there was no counterpart elsewhere to the efficient mechanisms established in England to maintain pension payments over successive decades.

===Politics===
The dissolution and destruction of the monasteries and shrines was very unpopular in many areas. In the north of England, centring on [[Yorkshire]] and [[Lincolnshire]], the suppression of the monasteries led to a popular rising, the [[Pilgrimage of Grace]], that threatened the Crown for some weeks. In 1536 there were major, popular uprisings in [[Lincolnshire]] and [[Yorkshire]] and a further rising in [[Norfolk]] the following year. Rumours were spread that the King was going to strip the parish churches too, and even tax cattle and sheep. The rebels called for an end to the dissolution of the monasteries, for the removal of Cromwell, and for Henry's daughter, and eldest child, the Catholic [[Mary I of England|Mary]] to be named as successor in place of his younger son, [[Edward VI of England|Edward]]. Henry defused the movement with solemn promises, all of which went unkept, and then summarily executed the leaders.

However, when [[Mary I of England|Mary]] succeeded to the throne in 1553, her hopes for a revival of English religious life proved a failure. [[Westminster Abbey]], which had been retained as a cathedral, reverted to being a monastery; while the communities of the Bridgettine nuns and of the Observant Franciscans, which had gone into exile in the reign of Henry VIII, were able to return to their former houses at Syon and Greenwich respectively. A small group of fifteen surviving Carthusians was re-established in their old house at Sheen, as also were eight Dominican canonesses in Dartford. A house of Dominican friars was established at Smithfield, but this was only possible through importing professed religious from Holland and Spain, and Mary's hopes of further refoundations foundered, as she found it very difficult to persuade former monks and nuns to resume the religious life; consequently schemes for restoring the abbeys at Glastonbury and St Albans failed for lack of volunteers. All the refounded houses were in properties that had remained in Crown possession; but, in spite of much prompting, none of Mary's lay supporters would co-operate in returning their holdings of monastic lands to religious use; while the lay lords in Parliament proved unremittingly hostile, as a revival of the "mitred" abbeys would have returned the House of Lords to having an ecclesiastical majority. Moreover, there remained a widespread suspicion that the return of religious communities to their former premises might call into question the legal title of lay purchasers of monastic land, and accordingly all Mary's foundations were technically new communities in law. In 1554 [[Reginald Pole|Cardinal Pole]], the [[Papal Legate]], negotiated a [[papal dispensation]] allowing the new owners to retain the former monastic lands, and in return Parliament enacted the [[heresy]] laws in January 1555.&lt;ref&gt;Bucholz, RO and Key, N.: "Early modern England 1485–1714: a narrative history" Wiley-Blackwell, 2009, pp. 110–111. {{ISBN|978-1-4051-6275-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Mary died and was succeeded by her sister [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]], five of the six revived communities left again to exile in continental Europe. An Act of Elizabeth's first parliament dissolved the refounded houses; but although Elizabeth offered to allow the monks in Westminster to remain in place with restored pensions if they took the Oath of Supremacy and conformed to the new [[Book of Common Prayer]], all refused and dispersed unpensioned. In less than 20 years, the monastic impulse had effectively been extinguished in England; and was only revived, even amongst Catholics, in the very different form of the new and reformed [[counter-reformation]] orders, such as the [[Jesuits]].

[[File:Daily Mail - Enemies of the People.png|thumb|Front cover of the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', 4 November 2016]]
"'''Enemies of the People'''" was the [[headline]] to an article by the political editor [[James Slack]], published in the British newspaper ''[[Daily Mail]]'' on 4 November 2016.&lt;ref name="Phipps"/&gt;&lt;!-- Slack's name and title are shown in the image of the front page --&gt;  The headline and associated article were about the three judges who had ruled that the [[UK Government]] would require the consent of [[British parliament|Parliament]] to give notice of [[Brexit]].  The headline was widely criticised as being inappropriately condemnatory and attracted numerous complaints, given that the British judiciary is independent of the Government.  The court had ruled on the question of whether the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom]] permitted the government to use the [[royal prerogative]] to invoke [[Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union|Article 50]] (or whether it would need to be authorised by an explicit act of Parliament to do so).

==Background==
The headline, written by [[James Slack]] and approved by editor [[Paul Dacre]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|work=[[The Oldie]]|date=March 2017|p=34|title=Moralist, monarchist and Brexiteer-in-chief|first=Stephen|last=Fay}}&lt;/ref&gt; was in response to the ruling of the [[High Court of Justice|High Court of England and Wales]] in  [[R (Miller) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union|the ''Miller'' case]] that the government would need to gain the consent of [[British parliament|Parliament]] before it could trigger Article 50 and exit the [[European Union]] (EU).  The government had intended to use the royal prerogative to invoke Article 50,  after a [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|referendum in June 2016]] had resulted in a slight majority vote to leave.&lt;ref name="Phipps"&gt;{{cite news|last=Phipps|first=Claire|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/04/enemies-of-the-people-british-newspapers-react-judges-brexit-ruling|title=British newspapers react to judges' Brexit ruling: 'Enemies of the people'|newspaper=The Guardian|date=4 November 2016|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Daily Mail'' claimed the court's decision purposefully blocked the [[Brexit]] process and ran the story and headline about the three high court judges  – the [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]], [[John Thomas (judge)|Lord Thomas]], [[Master of the Rolls]] Sir [[Terence Etherton]], and [[Philip Sales|Lord Justice Sales]].&lt;ref name=independent&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/daily-mail-nazi-propaganda-front-page-ipso-complaints-brexit-eu-enemies-of-the-people-a7409836.html|title=Daily Mail's 'Enemies of the People' front page receives more than 1,000 complaints to IPSO|newspaper=The Independent|date=10 November 2016|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/27/opinion/sunday/is-donald-trump-mr-brexit.html|title=Is Donald Trump ‘Mr. Brexit’?|newspaper=The New York Times|date=27 January 2017|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mail Online|The Mail's website]] also initially described Etherton as an "openly-gay ex-Olympic fencer",&lt;ref name="Duffy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2016/11/03/the-daily-mail-is-very-upset-because-an-openly-gay-judge-ruled-on-brexit/|title=The Daily Mail is very upset because an 'openly gay judge' ruled on Brexit|last=Duffy|first=Nick|work=[[PinkNews]]|date=3 November 2016|accessdate=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this was changed after criticism on social media.&lt;ref name="Nelson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/mailonline-online-attacks-brexit-judge-for-being-openly-gay_uk_581b344ee4b0ab6e4c1ba5ff|title=MailOnline Attacks Brexit Judge For Being 'Openly Gay'|last=Nelson|first=Sara C|work=[[Huffington Post]]|date=3 November 2016|accessdate=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blair"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/jk-rowling-brexit-legal-challenge-twitter-response-daily-mail-headline-openly-gay-fencer-judge-a7396941.html|title=J.K.

==Aftermath==
The [[Independent Press Standards Organisation]] received over 1,000 complaints about the piece, claiming it violated numerous Codes of Conduct including inaccuracy, harassment and discrimination.&lt;ref name=independent/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|work=Discourse, Context &amp; Media|date=April 2018|title=“Enemies of the people”: Populist performances in the Daily Mail reporting of the Article 50 case|first=Ruth|last=Breeze|doi=10.1016/j.dcm.2018.03.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''[[Business Insider]]'' report strongly criticised the ''Daily Mail'' story as being "distorted" and could be construed as an attempt to harm the reputation and safety of the judges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/brexit-high-court-article-50-judges-mail-express-front-page-2016-11|title=People are furious at the ''Daily Mail'' front page branding the Article 50 judges ‘Enemies of the People'|work=Business Insider|date=4 November 2016|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2016, the [[Anglican Bishop of Leeds|Bishop of Leeds]], [[Nick Baines (bishop)|Nick Baines]] said the public should be "very alarmed" over the ''Daily Mail'' piece.&lt;ref name=independent/&gt;  [[David Neuberger, Baron Neuberger of Abbotsbury|Lord Neuberger]] spoke out about the press criticism of judges in an interview broadcast by the BBC in February 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-38986228|title=Attacks on judges undermine law – Supreme Court president|work=BBC News|date=16 February 2017|accessdate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the criticism of the High Court ruling by newspapers, including the ''Daily Mail'', the [[Secretary of State for Justice]], [[Liz Truss]] issued a three line statement defending the independence and impartiality of the judiciary more than a day after being asked by the [[General Council of the Bar|Bar Council]] to comment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/bar-council-liz-truss-brexit-ruling-decision-serious-unjustified-attacks-judiciary-judges-high-court-a7399356.html|title=Liz Truss breaks her silence but fails to condemn backlash over Brexit ruling|work=The Independent|accessdate=11 February 2017|last=Worley|first=Will}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/nov/05/barristers-urge-liz-truss-to-condemn-attacks-on-brexit-ruling-judges|title=Liz Truss defends judiciary after Brexit ruling criticism|work=The Guardian|date=5 November 2016|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The chairwoman of the Bar Council, [[Chantal-Aimee Doerries]] QC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37883576|title=Brexit ruling: Lord Chancellor backs judiciary amid row|work=BBC News|date=5 November 2016|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; said that Truss should have clearly defended the judiciary and condemned the attacks made by the ''Daily Mail'' and similar stories in the newspapers ''[[Daily Express]]'' and ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]''.  Truss' brief response was seen as inadequate. Former Conservative minister [[Anna Soubry]] said that Truss "has a duty to condemn the vilification, including a homophobic attack, of our judiciary".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/05/lawyers-war-liz-truss-over-abuse-judges-brexit-barristers|title=Brexit: lawyers confront Liz Truss over ‘dangerous’ abuse of judges|newspaper=The Guardian|date=5 November 2016|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Thomas later condemned Truss' comments, saying she was "completely and utterly wrong" to say the media could not be criticised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/mar/22/lord-chief-justice-castigates-liz-truss-for-failing-to-defend-judges|title=Lord chief justice attacks Liz Truss for failing to back article 50 judges|first=Owen|last=Bowcott|newspaper=The Guardian|date=22 March 2017|accessdate=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government appealed against the High Court decision. In January 2017, the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]] dismissed the appeal, which Lord Neuberger summarised as "the government cannot trigger Article 50 without an Act of Parliament".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-38720320|title=Brexit: Supreme Court says Parliament must give Article 50 go-ahead|work=BBC News|date=24 January 2017|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bar Council launched a scheme to teach secondary school children about the importance and impartiality of the British judiciary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/2017/01/24/barristers-launch-pr-drive-schools-explain-judges-not-enemies/|title=Barristers launch PR drive in schools to explain why judges are not the 'enemies of the people'|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=24 January 2017|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of January 2017, it appeared that Slack was to be appointed as prime minister [[Theresa May]]'s official spokesman,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McTague|first=Tom|url=http://www.politico.eu/article/theresa-may-gets-her-alastair-campbell/|title=Theresa May gets her Alastair Campbell|work=Politico|date=31 January 2017|accessdate=31 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Asthana|first=Anushka|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/jan/31/journalist-james-slack-daily-mail-theresa-may-spokesman-no-10|title=Journalist James Slack tipped to become Theresa May's spokesman|work=The Guardian|date=31 January 2017|accessdate=31 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was confirmed on 10 February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/prime-ministers-official-spokesperson-appointed-james-slack|title=James Slack will be the new Prime Minister's Official Spokesperson|publisher=H,M.

On 19 April 2017, following the Prime Minister's decision to call a [[United Kingdom General Election, 2017|snap election]], the ''Daily Mail'' ran a similar Brexit-related headline, "Crush the Saboteurs". This did not attack the judiciary but focused on the "unelected" [[House of Lords]] and called people who voted for Britain to remain in the EU "remoaners".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/19/crush-the-saboteurs-how-hard-brexit-rhetoric-turned-leninist|title=Crush the saboteurs!

The '''Eurovision Song Contest 2004''' was the 49th edition of the annual [[Eurovision Song Contest]]. It took place in [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]], following [[Sertab Erener]]'s win at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2003|2003 contest]] in [[Riga]], [[Latvia]] with the song "[[Everyway That I Can]]" – marking the country's first victory in the contest. The national broadcaster [[Turkish Radio and Television Corporation]] (TRT), staged the event at the [[Abdi İpekçi Arena]] on 12 and 15 May 2004.

[[Ukrainian people|Ukrainian]] singer [[Ruslana]] won the contest with "[[Wild Dances]]". It is notable that this was only Ukraine's second participation in the contest. This was also the third year in a row in which the contest was won by a woman, performing a song composed at least partially by herself (being the previous two [[Marie N]] and [[Sertab Erener]], who co-wrote their winning songs for the 2002 and 2003 contests).

To accommodate the increasing number of countries who wished to participate, a semi-final was introduced. The countries which did not qualify for the final are normally calculate like participating countries, as well semi-finals are a part of the competition. For the second consecutive year, no returning acts were present – only the sixth time (including 1956) in the history of the contest that this happened and it was the first time this had happened in two consecutive years.

== Hosts ==

=== Location ===
{{details|topic=the host city|Istanbul}}
[[File:Abdi İpekçi Spor Salonu - panoramio.jpg|thumb|left|Abdi İpekçi Arena, Istanbul – host venue of the 2004 contest.]]
The contest was held in [[Istanbul]] following [[Turkey]]'s victory in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2003|2003 contest]] in [[Riga]], [[Latvia]] with [[Sertab Erener]]'s "[[Everyway That I Can]]". Originally the [[Mydonose Showland]] was chosen by TRT to host the event, but was changed to the [[Abdi İpekçi Arena]] as the contest approached due to its bigger capacity.&lt;ref name="Decade" /&gt; [[Korhan Abay]] and [[Meltem Cumbul]] were presenters of the show.

In the semi-final and the final, Meltem Cumbul warmed up the audience with a sing-a-long of Eurovision classic "[[Volare (song)|Nel blu dipinto di blu (Volare)]]", originally by [[Domenico Modugno]]. Sertab Erener returned to the stage in the final to perform "Everyway That I Can", the 2003 winning song, and one of her new songs called "[[Leave (Sertab Erener song)|Leave]]". Sertab also interviewed contestants in the green room. The Turkish dance ensemble [[Fire of Anatolia]] performed as the interval act.&lt;ref name="Decade"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=7813&amp;_t=The+end+of+a+decade%3A+Istanbul+2004 |title=The end of a decade: Istanbul 2004 |last=Bakker |first=Sietse |date=25 December 2009 |publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]] |accessdate=25 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; An official CD was released and, for the first time, the entire contest was released on DVD which included the Semi-final and the Grand Final.

== Firsts ==
The contest's new official generic logo was used for the first time this year, with the heart-shaped flag in the centre due to be changed for future contests. The slogan for Istanbul's contest was "Under The Same Sky", which communicated the importance of a united Europe and [[Accession of Turkey to the European Union|Turkish integration]].

This year was also notable as it was the first year that [[Turkey]] voted for [[Cyprus]] and the second year in a row that Cyprus voted for Turkey. Nevertheless, in a move that angered some Cypriots, when the country presented its votes no map of the island was shown (all other presenters were preceded with their country being highlighted on a map). This was due to Turkey's recognition of the [[Northern Cyprus|northern half of the island]] as an independent republic (not recognised by any other state). It is likely Turkey pulled out of showing the map because it would have only highlighted the southern portion of the island, and thus angered the international community.&lt;ref name="Decade" /&gt;

This was also the first year that the scores were only re-read by the hosts in one language. Before 2004 every point was repeated in [[French language|French]] and [[English language|English]], but due to 36 countries voting, and more in years to come, in 2004 to save time the hosts only re-read each score in one language. This was in the opposite of the original country representative spoke in.

Also, this year was the first time in which a non-winning entry scored over 200 points. Prior to this contest, only [[Rock 'n' Roll Kids]] and [[Love Shine a Light]], the winners in 1994 and 1997 had passed this mark. In this contest, all songs in the top 3 got over 200 points.

== Participating countries ==
This year's Eurovision contest was the first to be a two-day event, with one qualifying round held on a Wednesday and the grand final held on the following Saturday. Under this new format, [[Bye (sports)|byes]] into the final were given to the 'Big 4'; [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Spain]] and the [[United Kingdom]] (as the largest financial contributors to the [[European Broadcasting Union]]) and the ten highest placed finishers in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2003|2003 contest]]. [[Andorra]], [[Albania]], [[Belarus]] and [[Serbia and Montenegro]] participated in the Contest for the first time, with [[Monaco]] returning after a 25-year absence. [[Luxembourg]] were due to return after an absence of 11 years, but later pulled out after money issues arose between [[RTL Télé Lëtzebuerg|RTL]] and the [[European Broadcasting Union|EBU]]. All participating countries had the right to vote in both the qualifying round and the grand final. This was the first year in which all 36 participating countries voted based on a public phone vote. However [[France]], [[Poland]] and [[Russia]] did not broadcast the semi-final (as they were not participating in it) and therefore did not give votes for it like the other thirty-three countries. In Belgium, the French-language [[RTBF]] did not broadcast the semi-final, but the Dutch-language [[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie|VRT]] did.

== Problems ==
Just before the [[Slovenia]]n entry was about to be performed, the Turkish broadcaster accidentally took a commercial break which meant the Slovenian song was not heard by Turkish viewers and consequently, Turkey gave no votes for the song.&lt;ref name="Decade" /&gt; There were technical problems when in a short hiatus halfway through the songs, (used for the advertising break), the hosts tried to contact various parties in Europe. They tried contacting [[Germany]], [[Spain]] and [[Turkey]], but in the end were only able to get a response from [[Germany]]. During the [[Romania]]n postcard introduction, the information for the Romanian entry appeared on the screen, but was quickly taken away. A final minor hiccup occurred when, on her way to present the winner the trophy, [[Sertab Erener]] got her shoe stuck in a speaker grill by the side of the stage and had to be freed by stagehands. However this did not delay proceedings, and other than the above the show ran smoothly.

An hour after the semi-final had been aired, the European Broadcasting Union discovered that there had been problems with the vote counting in [[Monaco]] and [[Croatia]]. Digame, an affiliate of [[Deutsche Telekom]], who had been responsible for processing all the votes (from 2004), reported that they had encountered problems with their calculation software, and there was a problem with [[Short message service|text message]] voting in Croatia. When the votes were counted, results showed that Croatia had awarded themselves 4 points, which is against Eurovision rules. Later, an official EBU statement read that there had been technical problems at the side of the Croatian mobile service provider, who neglected to delete the illegal votes from the results. Consequently, some votes were not counted in the results announced at the end of the broadcast of the semi-final. When the results were corrected to include these additional votes, they were found not to have affected which countries had qualified for the Final.&lt;ref name="Decade" /&gt;

== Format ==

=== Voting structure ===
Every country in the competition, including those who did not qualify for the final, were allowed to vote for other countries. After all performances were completed, each country opened their phone lines to allow their viewers to vote for their favourite song. Voting for the country in which you are situated is not allowed, however. Each country awarded points based on the number of votes cast for each song: the song which received the most viewer votes was awarded 12 points, the second 10 points, the third 8 points and then 7, 6, 5, etc. down to 1.

In the event of a tie, the number of countries to vote for the tying songs would be counted, and the song having the most countries awarding points to it, would be the winner. In the event of a further tie, then the previously used method of counting back on the number of 12 points, 10 points etc., would be used to find an eventual winner.

== Results ==

=== Semi-final ===
The semi-final was held on 12 May 2004 at 21:00 ([[Central European Time|CET]]). 22 countries performed and all participants voted except [[France]], [[Poland]] and [[Russia]]. This was the first ever semi-final in Eurovision history.

A new ABBA video was shown in the semi-final, briefly outlining how [[ABBA]] started and what the response was of the first record company they approached. It featured small puppets of the band performing snippets of their songs (the voices being the ones of the band) and featured [[Rik Mayall]] as the record company manager.&lt;ref name="Decade" /&gt; This was cut from the Eurovision Song Contest DVD and released separately. References to the video that were made running up to the showing of it were also cut.

=== Final ===
The finalists were:
* the four automatic qualifiers [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Spain]] and the [[United Kingdom]];
* the top 10 countries from the 2003 contest (other than the automatic qualifiers);
* the top 10 countries from the 2004 semi-final.

The final was held on 15 May 2004 at 21:00 ([[Central European Time|CET]]) and was won by [[Ukraine]].

''Countries in bold automatically qualified for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2005]] Final.''

*orchestral works by [[Alfred Bruneau|Bruneau]], [[Félicien-César David|David]], [[Henri Duparc (composer)|Duparc]], [[Alexander Goedicke|Goedicke]], [[Ernest Guiraud|Guiraud]], [[Józef Hofmann|Hofmann]], [[Giuseppe Martucci|Martucci]], [[Joachim Raff|Raff]], [[Anton Rubinstein]], [[Ernest Schelling|Schelling]], [[Christian Sinding|Sinding]], and [[Louis Spohr|Spohr]]; 
*concertos by [[Léon Boëllmann|Boëllmann]], [[Hans Bronsart von Schellendorff|Bronsart]], [[Alexander Dreyschock|Dreyschock]], [[Heinrich Wilhelm Ernst|Ernst]], [[Benjamin Godard|Godard]], [[Georg Goltermann|Goltermann]], [[Adolf von Henselt|Henselt]], [[Henri Herz|Herz]], [[Johann Nepomuk Hummel|Hummel]], [[Joseph Joachim|Joachim]], [[Moritz Moszkowski|Moszkowski]], [[Selim Palmgren|Palmgren]], [[Josef Rheinberger|Rheinberger]], [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]] and [[Anton Rubinstein]]; 
*choral works by [[Niels Gade|Gade]], [[Gabriel Pierné|Pierne]], [[Joachim Raff|Raff]], [[Max Reger|Reger]], [[Giovanni Sgambati|Sgambati]] and [[Carl Maria von Weber|Weber]], 
*fully staged ballets by [[Johann Friedrich Franz Burgmüller|Burgmüller]], [[Riccardo Drigo|Drigo]], [[Alexander Glazunov|Glazunov]], [[Johann Wilhelm Hertel|Hertel]], [[Jacques Offenbach|Offenbach]] and [[Ambroise Thomas|Thomas]], 
*solo and chamber works by [[Charles-Valentin Alkan|Alkan]], [[Felix Blumenfeld|Blumenfeld]], [[Hans Bronsart von Schellendorff|Bronsart]], [[Ernő Dohnányi|Dohnanyi]], [[Leopold Godowsky|Godowsky]], [[Eduard Nápravník|Nápravník]], [[Xaver Scharwenka]], and [[Sigismond Thalberg|Thalberg]].

Certain specific performers became associated with the Festival, including violinist [[Aaron Rosand]], pianists [[Jorge Bolet]], [[Malcolm Frager]], [[Gunnar Johansen]] and [[Raymond Lewenthal]], cellists [[James Kreger]] and [[Jascha Silberstein]], and conductors [[Victor Borge]], [[Igor Buketoff]], [[Jorge Mester]] and [[Izler Solomon]] – many of whom went on to record several of these works for commercial record labels.  Schonberg wrote many articles crediting Cooper with almost single-handedly jumpstarting the [[Romantic Revival]] in music.  The Festival continued after Cooper left.

It is open to amateur/professional bands of all music genres and ages; there are only two main prerequisites to joining: no cover songs and no pre-recorded tracks. All bands must play original compositions and play it live. Every year Local Qualifying Heats and National Finals take place in participating countries around the world. The winners of these go forward to the World Finals. The grand winner of the World Finals will be awarded a USD $100,000.00 worth of cash and band development packages in London, as well as a golden statuette engraved with the words "Best New Band in the World".

Starting in 2004 with 16 countries participating, 25 countries took part in 2006 and participation continues to grow in 2007 to 2010 with a frequent average of over 30 countries involved.&lt;ref name="GBOB.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gbob.com/|title=Official Website, GBOB.com|work=GBOB|accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''HMS ''D3''''' was one of eight [[British D-class submarine|D-class submarine]] built for the [[Royal Navy]] during the first decade of the 20th century.

==Description==
The D-class submarines were designed as improved and enlarged versions of the preceding [[British C-class submarine|C class]], with [[diesel engine]]s replacing the dangerous [[petrol engine]]s used earlier. ''D3'' and subsequent boats were slightly larger than the earlier boats. They had a length of {{convert|164|ft|7|in|m|1}} [[length overall|overall]], a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|20|ft|5|in|m|1}} and a mean [[draft (ship)|draught]] of {{convert|11|ft|5|in|m|1}}. They [[displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{convert|495|LT|t}} on the surface and {{convert|620|LT|t}} submerged.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt; The D-class submarines had a crew of 25 officers and [[other ranks (UK)|other ranks]] and were the first to adopt [[saddle tank (submarine)|saddle tanks]].&lt;ref name=gg9&gt;Gardiner &amp; Gray, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

For surface running, the boats were powered by two {{convert|600|bhp|lk=in|0|adj=on}} diesels, each driving one [[propeller shaft]]. When submerged each propeller was driven by a {{convert|275|hp|0|adj=on}} [[electric motor]]. They could reach {{convert|14|kn|lk=in}} on the surface and {{convert|9|kn}} underwater. On the surface, the D class had a range of {{convert|2500|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|10|kn}}.&lt;ref name=gg9/&gt;

The boats were armed with three [[British 18 inch torpedo|18-inch (45&amp;nbsp;cm)]] [[torpedo tube]]s, two in the bow and one in the stern. They carried one reload for each tube, a total of six torpedoes.&lt;ref name=gg9/&gt;

==Construction and career==
''D3'' was [[laid down]] on 15 March 1910 by [[Vickers]] at their [[Barrow-in-Furness|Barrow]] [[shipyard]] and commissioned on 30 August 1911. During her career, ''D3'' returned from the second [[Heligoland Bight]] patrol along with [[HMS D2|''D2'']], [[HMS E5|''E5'']] and [[HMS E7|''E7'']].

==Sinking==
[[File:William McKinstry Heriot-Maitland-Dougall Plaque, CFB Halifax.jpg|thumb|left|William McKinstry Heriot-Maitland-Dougall Plaque, [[CFB Halifax]]]]
''D3'' was mistakenly bombed and sunk by a French airship [[AT-0]] off [[Fecamp]] in the [[English Channel]] and lost with all hands on 12 March 1918. AT-0 was patrolling when at 14:20 a vessel was spotted to her north east. The airship drew close for recognition purposes and according to her commander, Lieutenant (RCN) [[William McKinstry Heriot-Maitland-Dougall]] the submarine fired rockets at her. Four 52-kg bombs were dropped by the airship. The submarine disappeared but several minutes later men were seen in the water. Attempts were made by the airship to rescue the men but it proved too difficult. The airship withdrew to seek help but all the men had drowned by the time it arrived. It is clear that ''D3'' was the victim of a serious identification error on the part of the French airship, with identification rockets being mistaken for aggressive gunfire.

The '''Hospicio Cabañas''' in [[Guadalajara, Jalisco|Guadalajara]], [[Jalisco]], [[Mexico]], a [[World Heritage Site]], is one of the oldest and largest hospital complexes in the [[Americas]].

The complex was founded in 1791 by the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Guadalajara|Bishop of Guadalajara]] in order to combine the functions of a [[workhouse]], [[hospital]], [[orphanage]], and [[almshouse]]. It owes its name to [[Juan Ruiz de Cabañas]] who was appointed to the [[Episcopal see|see]] of Guadalajara in 1796 and engaged [[Manuel Tolsá]], a renowned architect from [[Mexico City]], to design the structure.

Tolsá's design was based on classic examples such as [[Les Invalides]] in [[Paris]] and [[El Escorial]] near [[Madrid]]. The buildings form a rectangle measuring {{convert|164|by|145|m}}. These are single-storey structures which are {{convert|7.5|m}} in height. The chapel is twice as high and has a dome rising to {{convert|32.5|m}}. The complex is erected on one level, "so as to facilitate the movement of the sick, the aged, and children."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Following the death of Cabañas in 1823, construction continued until 1829. Although it served for a time as barracks in the mid-19th century, the hospital lasted well into the 20th century and continued to function until 1980, when the Cabañas Cultural Institute, with affiliated schools for arts and crafts, moved in. The highlight of the interior decoration is a series of monumental frescoes by [[José Clemente Orozco]], including one of his most famed creations, the allegory of ''The Man of Fire'' (1936–39).

Hospicio Cabaña was made a [[World Heritage Site|Unesco World Heritage site]] in 1997.&lt;ref name="Rojas"&gt;{{cite news

The '''International Crimes Tribunal (Bangladesh)''' ('''ICT of Bangladesh''') is a domestic war crimes tribunal in Bangladesh set up in 2009 to investigate and prosecute suspects for the [[1971 Bangladesh genocide|genocide]] committed in 1971 by the [[Pakistan Army]] and their local collaborators, [[Razakars (Pakistan)|Razakars]], [[Al-Badr (East Pakistan)|Al-Badr]] and [[Al-Shams (East Pakistan)|Al-Shams]] during the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]].&lt;ref name="Wierda" /&gt; During the [[Bangladeshi general election, 2008|2008 general election]], the [[Awami League]] (AL) pledged to try war criminals.&lt;ref name="Kibria" /&gt; The government set up the tribunal after the Awami League won the general election in December 2008 with a more than two-thirds majority in parliament.

The [[War Crimes Fact Finding Committee]], tasked to investigate and find evidence, completed its report in 2008, identifying 1,600 suspects.&lt;ref name="Rahman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Montero" /&gt; Prior to the formation of the ICT, the [[United Nations Development Programme]] offered assistance in 2009 on the tribunal's formation.&lt;ref name="D'Costa2p144" /&gt; In 2009, the parliament amended the 1973 act that authorised such a tribunal to update it.&lt;ref name=dwonparty&gt;{{cite news |last=Shams |first=Shamil |date=18 February 2013 |title=Will ban on Islamic party heal wounds? |url=http://www.dw.de/will-ban-on-islamic-party-heal-wounds/a-16607674 |work=Deutsche Welle |accessdate=28 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first indictments were issued in 2010. However, the main perpetrators of the war crimes, the Pakistan soldiers, remained out of the reach of the courts.&lt;ref name=economist1&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Politics and the past in Bangladesh: Dialling down |url=https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21629455-series-trials-war-crimes-still-matter-politically-less-dialling-down |magazine=The Economist |date=30 October 2014 |accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2012, nine leaders of [[Jamaat-e-Islami]], the largest Islamist party in the nation, and two of the [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party]], had been indicted as suspects in [[war crime]]s. Three leaders of Jamaat were the first tried; each were convicted of several charges of war crimes. The first person convicted was [[Abul Kalam Azad (Bachchu)|Abul Kalam Azad]], tried ''[[trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' as he had left the country; he was sentenced to death in January 2013.

The ICT initially received some offers of international assistance. In 2009, the UN offered its expertise, expressing an interest in helping Bangladesh avoid the problems other countries faced in similar trials.&lt;ref name="Haq"/&gt;&lt;ref name=dawn&gt;{{cite news |title=UN to help Bangladesh war crimes trial planning |url=http://www.dawn.com/news/904714/un-to-help-bangladesh-war-crimes-trial-planning |newspaper=DAWN |date=24 April 2009 |access-date=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Union|EU]] has passed three resolutions supporting the trials and [[Jean Lambert]] has said "she expected that the trial would conform to the highest standard possible."&lt;ref name="Ullah" /&gt;

However, since the beginning of the trials several human rights organisations and international legal figures have raised objections to the court proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Chowdhury |first=Shamim |date=29 October 2014 |title=The politics at play in Bangladesh war trials |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2014/10/politics-at-play-bangladesh-war-trials-2014102953244138968.html |newspaper=Al Jazeera |access-date=4 July 2015 |quote=Human Rights Watch and the International Bar Association are just two of a number of bodies that have formally criticised the ICT for being incompatible with international standards on matters of transparency and fairness, and for not following due process.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human Rights Watch, which initially supported the establishment of the tribunal, have criticised it for issues of fairness and transparency, as well as reported harassment of lawyers and witnesses representing the accused.&lt;ref name="Adams" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Adams2" /&gt; Bianca Karim and Tirza Theunissen have written that the international community have voiced concerns that the trial will not be transparent or impartial.&lt;ref name="Karim" /&gt;

Jamaat-e-Islami supporters and their student wing, [[Islami Chhatra Shibir|Bangladesh Islami Chhatra Shibir]], called a general strike nationwide on 4 December 2012, which erupted in violence. The group demanded the tribunal be scrapped permanently and their leaders be released immediately.&lt;ref name="Attack_star-1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="attack_newage-1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="attack_sun-1" /&gt;

Annual public opinion polls regularly rank the war-crimes trials ranked among the top three "positive steps that the government has taken", though the issue is not considered among the top ten most pressing issues facing the country.&lt;ref name=ECONOMIST-17-9-2013&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Bangladesh's warcrimes trials: Final sentence |magazine =The Economist |url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/banyan/2013/09/bangladesh-s-war-crimes-trials |date=17 September 2013 |accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polling in 2013 by [[AC Nielsen]] found that more than two-thirds of Bangladeshis characterise the ICT as "unfair" or "very unfair", though 86% support its implementation.&lt;ref name=ECONOMIST-17-9-2013/&gt;

In February 2013, [[Abdul Quader Molla]], Assistant Secretary General of Jamaat, was the first person sentenced to death by the ICT who was not convicted in absentia.&lt;ref name=ECONOMIST-17-9-2013/&gt; Initially, Molla was sentenced to life imprisonment, but demonstrations, including the [[2013 Shahbag protests]] in Dhaka, lead to a new punishment.&lt;ref name=ECONOMIST-17-9-2013/&gt;

==Background==
The events of the nine-month conflict of the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] are widely viewed as [[genocide]]; the Pakistan Army and collaborators targeted mass people, intellectuals and members of the political opposition for attacks.&lt;ref name="D'Costa2p144" /&gt;&lt;ref name="D'Costa2p76" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Simms" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Trim" /&gt; Historians have estimated that, during the conflict, between two hundred thousand&lt;ref name="Saikia Sexual Violence" /&gt; and four hundred thousand&lt;ref name="Riedel p10" /&gt; women and children&lt;ref name="Ghadbian" /&gt; were [[Rape during the Bangladesh Liberation War|raped]] leading to an estimated 25,000 [[war babies]] being born.&lt;ref name="D'Costa3" /&gt; Estimates of persons killed during the conflict range to three million.&lt;ref name="Totten" /&gt; An estimated ten million refugees entered India, a situation which contributed to its government's decision to intervene militarily in the civil war. Thirty million people were displaced.&lt;ref name="Totten" /&gt;

In 2009 [[Shafique Ahmed]], the Minister of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs, announced that the trials would be organised under the International Crimes (Tribunal) Act 1973.&lt;ref name="Alffram" /&gt; This act authorises prosecution only of persons living within Bangladesh who were members of the armed forces, including paramilitary groups. The act was amended in 2009 to update it, and the International Crimes Tribunal Rules of Procedure and Evidence were put in place by 2010. Some critics maintain that further amendments are needed to bring the act up to the standards of international law.&lt;ref name="Karim" /&gt;

==Formation of the tribunal==
Seeing the broad support for war crimes trials, the [[Awami League]]-led fourteen-party alliance included this in their election platform.&lt;ref name="ictformed"/&gt; The Four-Party Alliance, including the [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party|BNP]] and [[Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami|Jamaat-e-Islami]], had several alleged war criminals among their top-ranking politicians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://icsforum.org/mediarchive/2008/12/31/no-against-war-criminals-won/ "No against war criminals won"], ''The Daily Prothom Alo,'' 31 December 2008, collected from [http://icsforum.org/mediarchive/ ICSF Media Archive]&lt;/ref&gt;

The former freedom fighters and sector commanders of the liberation war pleaded with citizens against voting for the alleged war criminals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://icsforum.org/mediarchive/2008/12/27/plead-not-to-cast-vote-for-traitors-and-war-criminals/ "Plead not to cast vote for traitors and war criminals"], ''The Daily Prothom Alo,'' 27 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The fourteen-party alliance won the election on 29 December 2008, with an overwhelming majority, a "historic landslide".&lt;ref name="bdhist"/&gt; This was thought to be due to their commitment to prosecute war crimes.&lt;ref name="bdhist"&gt;{{cite news

On 29 January 2009, [[Mahmud-us-Samad Chowdhury]], a member of the parliament (MP) from the Awami League (AL), proposed taking action to establish a tribunal to prosecute war crimes during a session of the [[Jatiyo Sangshad]]. A resolution was passed unanimously calling on the government to proceed as promised in the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=JS passes proposal to try war criminals |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=73557 |newspaper=The Daily Star |date=30 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973 the newly independent government of Bangladesh passed a law, the International Crimes (Tribunals) Act (ICT Act 1973), to authorise the investigation and prosecution of the persons responsible for genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and other crimes under [[international law]] committed in 1971. The act was a complete in itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://icsforum.org/blog/icsf/text-of-speech-before-the-eu-parliaments-delegation-by-ict-prosecutor/ Advocate Zead-Al-Malum’s Speech before South Asian Committee of EU Parliament] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130128174852/http://icsforum.org/blog/icsf/text-of-speech-before-the-eu-parliaments-delegation-by-ict-prosecutor |date=28 January 2013 }}, Meeting on Bangladesh:" Exchange of Views on War Crimes Trials and on Accountability Issues," 31 January 2012. Quote: The law provided "the substantive law, definition of crimes, procedures to follow, provisions of evidence, constitution of the Tribunal, obligation of the Judges to be independent and to ensure fair trial standards, including the rights of the accused, rules to monitor investigations and interrogations, supervising arrest and viability of continued detention, rules to protect the witnesses and victims, rules regarding appeal after conviction, and the rule making authority of the judges, etc."&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 March 2009 the government voted to try the war criminals according to the ICT Act of 1973&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=War criminal trial under int'l crime act |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=81408 |newspaper=The Daily Star |date=26 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lawcom"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; but planned amendments to bring the law up to date and in keeping with international standards for similar trials. As a part of the amendment procedure, the government sent the act to the Law Commission, where it was scrutinised by specialist lawyers, judges and professors of the universities.&lt;ref name="lawcom"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The amendments provided that a political party that had worked against the liberation of Bangladesh could be tried on the same charges as individuals. They also authorised the government to file appeals with the Appellate Division if the tribunal ruled for acquittal for a suspect.&lt;ref name="amend"/&gt; The [[International Bar Association]] has stated that the "1973 Legislation, together with the 2009 amending text, provides a system which is broadly compatible with current international standards."&lt;ref name="Amir-Ul Islam" /&gt;

On 25 March 2010, the government announced the formation of the following: a three-member judges' tribunal, a seven-member investigation agency, and a twelve-member prosecution team to hold the trials according to the ICT Act of 1973. This landmark announcement was made on the 39th anniversary of the [[Operation Searchlight]] massacre by the [[Pakistan Army]] on 25 March 1971.&lt;ref name="ictformed"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Manik |first1=Julfikar Ali |last2=Tusher |first2=Hasan Jahid |date=26 March 2010 |title=Stage set for war trial |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=131639 |newspaper=The Daily Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BdST" /&gt;

The three judges appointed were [[Mohammed Nizamul Huq]] as chairman, with A.T.M. Fazle Kabir and A.K.M. Zahir Ahmed.&lt;ref name="Chair" /&gt;

Persons appointed to the investigative agency to assist state prosecutors were Abdul Matin, Abdur Rahim, Kutubur Rahman, ASM Shamsul Arefin, Mir Shahidul Islam, Nurul Islam and M. Abdur Razzak Khan.&lt;ref name="UNBconnect" /&gt;

[[Golam Arif Tipu]] was named as Chief Prosecutor.

Two leaders of the opposition [[Bangladesh National Party]] were also indicted: former government ministers [[Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury]] and [[Abdul Alim]].&lt;ref name=ibn_live/&gt;

==Accused and verdicts==

===Abul Kalam Azad (Bachchu)===
[[Abul Kalam Azad (Bachchu)|Abul Kalam Azad]], a nationally known Islamic cleric and former member of Jamaat, was charged with genocide, rape, abduction, confinement and torture. He was tried ''[[trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' after having fled the country; the police believe he is in Pakistan.&lt;ref name="Quadir" /&gt; In January 2013 Azad was the first suspect to be convicted in the trials; he was found guilty of seven of eight charges and sentenced to death by hanging.&lt;ref name="Ahmed2" /&gt; Azad's defence lawyer, a prominent Supreme Court lawyer appointed by the state, did not have any witnesses in the case; he said Azad's family failed to co-operate in helping locate witnesses and refused to testify.&lt;ref name="AzadNoWitnesses" /&gt;

United Nations human rights experts expressed concern that the trial did not meet all the criteria of a [[fair trial]] and [[due process]].&lt;ref name="UNAzad" /&gt; Speaking for the British government, [[Sayeeda Warsi, Baroness Warsi|Sayeeda Warsi]] said of the verdict, "The British government supports the efforts of Bangladesh to bring to justice those responsible for committing atrocities during the 1971 War, although we remain strongly opposed to the application of the death penalty in all circumstances." The French Ambassador to Bangladesh, [[Michel Trinquier]], and the German Ambassador [[Albrecht Conze]] each said that individual nations must find their own ways to deal with past events.&lt;ref name="Star Online Report" /&gt; The US state department has said, "The [[United States]] supports bringing to justice those who commit such crimes. However, we believe that any such trials must be free, fair, and transparent, and in accordance with domestic standards and international standards Bangladesh has agreed to uphold through its ratification of international agreements, including the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]]."&lt;ref name="Nuland" /&gt;

===Abdul Quader Mollah===
On 5 February 2013, the ICT sentenced [[Abdul Quader Mollah]], assistant secretary of Jamaat, to life imprisonment.&lt;ref name=guardian-1&gt;{{cite news |title=Bangladesh jails Islamic party leader for life |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/05/bangladesh-jails-islamic-leader |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |agency=Associated Press |date=5 February 2013 |accessdate=6 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mollah was convicted on five of six counts of [[crimes against humanity]] and war crimes.&lt;ref name=yn-1&gt;{{cite news|title=Bangladesh Islamist sentenced to life in prison for war crimes |url=https://news.yahoo.com/bangladesh-islamist-sentenced-life-prison-war-crimes-123137810.html |work=Yahoo News |date=5 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208041918/http://news.yahoo.com/bangladesh-islamist-sentenced-life-prison-war-crimes-123137810.html |archive-date=8 February 2013 |accessdate=6 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was accused of shooting 344 people and the rape of an 11-year-old girl.&lt;ref name=Hensher&gt;{{cite news |last=Hensher |first=Philip |date=19 February 2013 |title=The war Bangladesh can never forget |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/the-war-bangladesh-can-never-forget-8501636.html |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |accessdate=28 October 2013 |quote=But critics of the so-called "Butcher of Mirpur" – who was convicted of {{sic}} beheading a poet, raping an 11-year-old girl and shooting 344 people – have been left fuming over the sentence, and are calling for him to face the death sentence, like fellow accused Abul Kalam Azad.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In protest of the trials which it said were politically motivated, Jamaat members called a general strike in Dhaka that erupted in violence.

Following the verdict, large-scale, non-violent [[2013 Shahbag protests|protests]] started on 5 February 2013 in Dhaka, with demonstrators calling for the death penalty for Mollah and any others convicted of war crimes.&lt;ref name="alam" /&gt; Tens of thousands of people filled the Shahbag intersection, with more coming in the days following.&lt;ref name="Mustafa" /&gt; The protest spread to other parts of the country, with sit-ins and demonstrations taking place in [[Chittagong]], [[Sylhet]], [[Barisal]], [[Mymensingh]], [[Khulna]], [[Rajbari District|Rajbari]], [[Rajshahi]], [[Rangpur District|Rangpur]], [[Sunamganj]], [[Noakhali]] and [[Narsingdi]].&lt;ref name="Shahbagh sit-in-1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sit in-3" /&gt; Following these mass protests, in September 2012 the Supreme Court overturned his life sentence and imposed the death penalty.&lt;ref name=aljazeera.mollah/&gt;

===Delwar Hossain Sayeedi===
On 28 February 2013, [[Delwar Hossain Sayeedi]], the deputy of Jamaat, was found guilty of genocide, rape and [[religious persecution]]. He was sentenced to death by hanging.&lt;ref name="Agencies" /&gt; His defence lawyer had earlier complained that a witness who was supposed to testify for him was abducted from the gates of the courthouse on 5 November 2012, reportedly by police, and has not been heard from since. The government did not seem to take the issue seriously after the prosecution denied there was a problem.&lt;ref name="Adams3"/&gt; By afternoon on the day of the protest, violence had erupted across [[Bangladesh]] between Islamic activists and police forces. By the end of 3 March 2013, almost 80 people were dead, including many police officers.

==Controversies==

===2012 Skype controversy===
{{Main|2012 ICT Skype controversy}}
In December 2012, ''[[The Economist]]'' published contents of leaked communications between the chief justice of the tribunal, [[Mohammed Nizamul Huq]], and [[Ahmed Ziauddin]], a Bangladeshi attorney in [[Brussels]] who specialises in international law and is director of the Bangladesh Centre for Genocide Studies. Huq issued an order for ''The Economist'' bureau chief and Asia specialist to appear before the tribunal to explain how they got the materials.&lt;ref name="The Economist"&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Discrepancy in Dhaka |url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/banyan/2012/12/bangladesh |work=The Economist |date=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Economist'' said in response, "We did not solicit the material, nor pay for it, nor commit ourselves to publish it".&lt;ref name="Ethirajan" /&gt; After the leaked communication was published in a local daily, Huq resigned from the tribunal.&lt;ref name="Wright"/&gt; He had been revealed to have had "prohibited contact" with the "prosecution, government officials, and an external adviser."&lt;ref name="Adams3"/&gt;

According to ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' (WSJ), the e-mails and [[Skype]] calls showed that Ziauddin was playing an important part in the proceedings, although he had no legal standing. The WSJ also said that the communications suggested that the Bangladeshi government was trying to secure a quick verdict, as Huq referred to pressure from a government official.&lt;ref name="Wright"/&gt;

[[Human Rights Watch]] and defence lawyers acting for the suspects, [[Ghulam Azam]] and Delawar Hossain Sayeedi, requested retrials for the two because of the controversy during their trials.&lt;ref name="Wright" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW Retrial" /&gt; Mahbubey Alam, the Attorney General, suggested that the hacking was an attempt to disrupt the trial.&lt;ref name="Attorney general" /&gt; [[Sheikh Hasina]], the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, said the trials would continue regardless of this incident and Huq's resignation.&lt;ref name="BdST PM" /&gt; Fazle Kabir was appointed as chair of the ICT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Justice Kabir made ICT-1 chief |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/latest_news.php?nid=43147 |newspaper=Daily Star |date=13 December 2012 |accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brad Adams of Human Rights Watch expressed concern that, because of changes among all the judges in the course of the trial, none of the three judges in Sayeedi's case would have heard the entirety of the testimony before reaching a verdict.&lt;ref name="HRW Retrial" /&gt;

===Allegations by the government===
[[Shafique Ahmed]], the Minister of Law and Justice, referring to Ziauddin, said that Huq "sought help on procedural matters from an expert. That's not illegal or uncommon."&lt;ref name="Al-Mahmood" /&gt; [[Amnesty International]] criticised the arrest of [[Mahmudur Rahman]], who had published the hacked files in the daily ''[[Amar Desh]].'' The government obtained a court order that accused Rahman of [[sedition]]; but Amnesty said that his newspaper stopped publishing the story once the government ban came into effect on 13 December.&lt;ref name="Online Report" /&gt;

Shafique Ahmed alleged that Jamaat-e-Islami has paid US$25&amp;nbsp;million to lobbyists in the USA and the UK to influence public opinion against the trials.&lt;ref name="lobbyists" /&gt; Mizanur Rahman, chair of the [[National Human Rights Commission]], complained about the lobbying efforts, saying there was misinformation being spread among western nations about the war crimes tribunal.&lt;ref name="Mizanur Rahman" /&gt;

===Shibir protests===
[[Shibir]], the student wing of Jamaat, led huge protests against the trials beginning with a general strike on 4 December 2012; they were attacked by police whenever they want to come down the streets to protest.&lt;ref name="Attack_star-1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="attack_newage-1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="attack_sun-1" /&gt;  In one incident in shatkhira police shot open fire, which resulted in three Shibir workers being injured.&lt;ref name="Jamaat-Shibir men run amok" /&gt; In this reaction, Numerous vehicles, including one of the US embassy in Dhaka, were torched and vandalised.&lt;ref name=us_embassy-1&gt;{{cite news |title=Sorry only for US embassy vehicle |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=259962 |newspaper=The Daily Star |date=5 December 2012 |accessdate=26 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=New_Nation-1&gt;{{cite news |title=Violences mark hartal |url=http://thenewnationbd.com/newsdetails.aspx?newsid=59383 |newspaper=The New Nation |date=26 January 2013 |accessdate=26 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jessor_attack&gt;{{cite news |title=Jamaat attacks cops in Jessore |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/latest_news.php?nid=43709 |newspaper=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]] |date=4 January 2013 |accessdate=26 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one incident, police fired [[tear gas]] and [[rubber bullet]]s at the activists. One Jamaat-e-Islami activist was killed and scores were injured when police used live ammunition against the protesters during clashes in December 2012.&lt;ref name="rt" /&gt; The activists were demanding the release of [[Miah Golam Parwar]], [[Delawar Hossain Sayedee]] and other party members being tried.&lt;ref name="Jamaat-Shibir men run amok" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jamaat attack" /&gt;

===Concerns for human rights===
[[Brad Adams]], director of the Asia branch of [[Human Rights Watch]], said in November 2012: "The trials against (...) the alleged war criminals are deeply problematic, riddled with questions about the independence and impartiality of the judges and fairness of the process.&lt;ref name="HRWReport2012"/&gt; In its November 2012 report, Human Rights Watch found that "glaring violations of fair trial standards" became apparent during 2012 but noted that changes were made in June 2012 which improved the process.&lt;ref name="HRWReport2012"/&gt; Adams said, "If the Bangladeshi government wants these trials to be taken seriously it must ensure that the rights of the accused are fully respected. That means making sure that lawyers and witnesses don't face threats or coercion.&lt;ref name="Adams2" /&gt; [[Toby Cadman]], an international law expert who is an advisor to the Jamaat leaders has been highly critical of the ICT, saying of the international community  "Expressing concern will not be enough. The international community should take quick action to stop the injustice being committed against Jamaat leaders,"&lt;ref name="Ghafour" /&gt;

In January 2013, Brad Adams of Human Rights Watch (HRW) noted concern about [[Shukho Ranjan Bali]], who had first appeared as a witness for the prosecution in the [[Delwar Hossain Sayeedi]] case. The defence said he was due to give additional evidence in their favour on 5 November 2012. That day Bali was stopped before entering the courthouse by several police officers; witnesses said he was taken away in a white police van. HRW criticised the Bangladeshi government for not working to find him and for its lack of adequate response to allegations criticising the tribunal. The attorney general rejected the abduction claim as a fabrication by the defence to bring the tribunal into disrepute.&lt;ref name="Adams3" /&gt; In May 2013, Bali was found in an Indian prison, and he alleged state abduction and that officials told him that both he and Sayeedi would be killed.&lt;ref name="nabali"/&gt;

In March 2013, ''The Economist'' criticised the tribunal, mentioning government interference, restrictions on public discussion, not enough time allocated for the defence, the kidnapping of a defence witness and the judge resigning due to [[2012 ICT Skype controversy|controversy over his neutrality]].&lt;ref name=Economist2&gt;{{cite magazine | title=Justice in Bangladesh: Another kind of crime | url=https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21573990-bangladeshs-war-crimes-tribunal-sullying-its-judicial-and-political-systems-another-kind | magazine=[[The Economist]] | date=23 March 2013 | accessdate=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
[[Human Rights Watch]] initially supported the establishment of the tribunal and recommended amendments to the 1973 law. The government already had planned to update the law, and proceeded in consultation with experts, as noted above.&lt;ref name="Adams"/&gt;

When the tribunal was being planned, [[Stephen Rapp]], the United States Ambassador-at-Large for War Crimes Issues, said that the "US government will help Bangladesh hold an open and transparent war crimes trial with the rights of defense for the accused."&lt;ref name="Haq" /&gt; Kristine A. Huskey, writing for the NGO Crimes of War, said Rapp gave a ten-page letter to the prosecution which included recommendations and various concerns.&lt;ref name="Huskey" /&gt;

A [[WikiLeaks]] [[United States diplomatic cables leak|leaked cable]] in November 2010 from the US State Department said, "There is little doubt that hard-line elements within the ruling party Awami League believe that the time is right to crush Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami and other Islamic parties."&lt;ref name="Allchin" /&gt;

Bangladeshi opposition political parties have demanded the release of those held, claiming the arrests are politically motivated.&lt;ref name="Haq" /&gt; [[Shafique Ahmed]], the Minister of Law and Justice, disagrees, saying, "No one is being arrested or tried on religious or political grounds."&lt;ref name="bdnews24" /&gt;

[[Steven Kay]], a British [[Queen's Counsel]] and criminal attorney, has been part of the defence team for Delwar Hossain Sayeedi.&lt;ref name=Report&gt;{{cite news |title=ICT recommends action against Sayedee's UK lawyers |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/latest_news.php?nid=33648 |newspaper=The Daily Star |date=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had earlier criticised the authorising legislation and 2009 amendments, saying: "The current system of war crimes trial and its law in Bangladesh does not include international concerns, required to ensure a fair, impartial and transparent trial."&lt;ref name="Correspondent"/&gt; The ICT accused him of violating the British bar's code of conduct.&lt;ref name="Ahmed" /&gt;

The Turkish president [[Abdullah Gül]] sent a letter to the tribunal asking that clemency be shown to those accused of war crimes.&lt;ref name="Zaman" /&gt; The [[European Parliament]] has passed three resolutions supporting the trials, though in at least one, it expressed its "strong opposition against the use of the death penalty in all cases and under any circumstances and its call on the Bangladesh authorities to commute all death sentences and introduce a moratorium on executions as a first step towards abolition of capital punishment."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=MOTION&amp;reference=B7-2013-0144&amp;language=EN&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean Lambert]] welcomed the trials and said she expected them to adhere to international standards.&lt;ref name="Ullah" /&gt; Mizanur Rahman, chair of the National Human Rights Commission, has said the trials do adhere to international law as the "national standards are in compliance with international standards".&lt;ref name="NHRC" /&gt; Sam Zarifi of the [[International Commission of Jurists]] expressed concern that the flawed nature of trials conducted at the ICT could deepen the divisions in Bangladeshi society which resulted from the war of 1971, rather than heal them.&lt;ref name="ZarifiICJ"/&gt;

The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention has said that the arbitrary detention of the suspects and refusal by the government to grant bail to them violates Article 9 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and Article 9 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]]. Shafique Ahmed has responded, "It is not right to think that the accused are being detained without any reason. There are no violations of human rights in the ongoing trial of crimes against humanity, and questions of human rights violation are being raised simply to create confusion."&lt;ref name="UNWGAD" /&gt;

Some human rights advocates are concerned that the mass rapes and killings of women may not be fully addressed in the prosecutions.&lt;ref name="RoyNYT" /&gt; [[Irene Khan]], a Bangladeshi [[human rights activist]], has described the government's response to abuses against women in the liberation war as the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A conservative Muslim society has preferred to throw a veil of negligence and denial on the issue, allowed those who committed or colluded with gender violence to thrive, and left the women victims to struggle in anonymity and shame and without much state or community support.&lt;ref name="RoyNYT" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Bangladeshi government has dismissed criticisms of the legal provisions and fairness of the tribunal. [[Shafique Ahmed]], the Minister of Law and Justice, said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is no scope for questioning the fairness and standard of the ongoing trial for war crimes during the Liberation War in 1971.&lt;ref name="BestLaw" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Isadora''''' is a ballet created for the [[Royal Ballet]] by [[Kenneth MacMillan]] to music by [[Richard Rodney Bennett]], based on the life and dance of [[Isadora Duncan]].

In following the life of Isadora Duncan, the title role is taken jointly by a ballerina and by an actress, whose spoken text is drawn from sections of the memoirs of Duncan. Following the initial run at Covent Garden and performances New York, the ballet was not seen until revised in consultation with MacMillan's widow, and revived by the company in 2009. The scenario in the ballet concentrates on the dramatic events in Duncan's personal life and her relationships with four of her partners.&lt;ref name=KM/&gt; 

The first performance of ''Isadora'' was at the [[Royal Opera House]], [[Covent Garden]] on 30 April 1981 with [[Merle Park]] in the title role. Designs were by [[Barry Kay]].&lt;ref name=KM&gt;{{cite web|title=Isadora|url=http://www.kennethmacmillan.com/ballets/all-works/1977-1992/isadora.html|website=Kennethmacmillan.com|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ballet was featured in the 50th anniversary BBC programme 'Right Royal Company', in May 1981&lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/6156825b3b1b498da8840b63b6745035 Right Royal Company, [[BBC1]] programme description], accessed 4 March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; and was filmed by [[Granada Television]] with the original cast and broadcast in 1982, subsequently being issued on DVD in 2011 by Odeon Entertainment, as the accompaniment to the 1968 feature film ''[[Isadora (film)|Isadora]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/isadora/oclc/761343161 The WorldCat entry for Isadora filmed], accessed 4 March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976 [[Frederick Ashton]] had created a short solo dance sequence entitled ''Five Brahms Waltzes in the Manner of Isadora Duncan'' for [[Lynn Seymour]] of the Royal Ballet, in which "Ashton fused Duncan's style with an imprint of his own"; [[Marie Rambert]] claimed after seeing it that it was exactly as she remembered Duncan dancing.&lt;ref name="Kav"&gt;Kavanagh J.

'''JK Racing Asia Series''', formerly known as both '''Formula BMW Asia''' and '''Formula BMW Pacific''', was a [[Open wheel car|single-seater]] racing series based in [[Asia]]. [[Formula BMW]] Asia was created in 2003 as a replacement for '''Asian Formula 2000''' and was under the management of Motorsport Asia Limited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afos.com/ma/history.php Motorsport Asia - Company History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203130440/http://www.afos.com/ma/history.php |date=3 February 2007 }} ''AFOS.com''. Retrieved on January 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It was renamed Formula BMW Pacific for the 2008 season. In 2011 the series lost BMW support but received [[JK Tyre]] sponsorship and was rebranded as JK Racing Asia Series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-02-11/racing/28547361_1_raghupati-singhania-series-features-drivers|title=JK Tyre announces JK Racing Asia series|date=11 February 2011|work=[[Times of India]]|publisher=Bennett, Coleman &amp; Co.

==Event schedule==
Each event in the championship was normally run to a three-day schedule. It comprises two races (in case of [[Formula One]] Grand Prix) or four races in standalone weekends, plus free practice and one 30-minute qualifying session.

==Circuits==

It appeared on the support bill at the [[Malaysian Grand Prix|Malaysian]], [[Chinese Grand Prix|Chinese]], [[Bahrain Grand Prix|Bahrain]], [[Macau Grand Prix|Macau]] and [[Singapore Grand Prix|Singapore]] Grand Prix. In 2011 the series visited [[Guangdong International Circuit|Guangdong]] in China and the [[Jaypee Group Circuit|Indian]] Grand Prix circuit.

==Race Weekend==

A typical event in the championship is run over a course of three days comprising two races (as a supporting race for a Formula 1 weekend) or four races.

A free practice session or a multiple practice session may take place at the start of a race weekend.

A 20 to 30 minute qualifying session will be held prior to a race with only one driver qualifying a car. The grid positions for the first Race will be drawn in the order of the fastest time achieved by each Driver in the Qualifying Session.  The grid positions for the second Race at each Meeting will be drawn in the order of the second fastest time achieved by each Driver in the Qualifying Session.  Should two or more Drivers be credited with identical times, priority will be given to the one who set it first. At Meetings with more than two Races, the grid positions for the third Race will be determined by the classified results of the first Race and the grid positions for the fourth Race will be determined by the classified results of the second Race. The minimum criteria to qualifying for a race would be the fastest time set in qualifying + 10%.

A race lasts for approximately 25 minutes from the start of the race signal to the end of the race signal preceded by a Formation Lap. The distance is converted into a specific number of laps. If the leading driver has not achieved the defined race distance after 25 minutes have elapsed, the leader will be shown the chequered flag the next time they pass the Finish Line.

Classification is determined according to the FIA International Sporting Code. The winner is the driver who has covered the race distance in the shortest time at the completion of the race and after the consideration of any penalties. Only drivers that have covered at least 75% of the race distance will be classified. If the race is stopped before the total distance is run, full points will be awarded to the winners if more than 75% of the distance was covered. If only 50% - 75% of the race distance is covered, only 50% of the points will be awarded. No points are awarded if less than 50% of the distance is covered before the race is stopped.

==Points==
After each race the following points will be awarded to eligible drivers listed as classified finishers in the final official classification as follows:

'''Jury tampering''' is the [[crime]] of unduly attempting to influence the composition and/or decisions of a [[jury]] during the course of a [[trial (law)|trial]].  In the United States, people have also been charged with jury tampering for handing out pamphlets and flyers indicating that jurors have certain rights and obligations, including an obligation to vote their conscience notwithstanding the instructions they are given by the judge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fox17online.com/2017/06/01/jury-finds-man-guilty-of-jury-tampering-by-passing-out-juror-rights-pamphlets/|title=Jury finds man guilty of jury tampering after passing out juror rights pamphlets|date=1 June 2017|accessdate=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The means by which this crime could be perpetrated can include attempting to discredit potential jurors to ensure they will not be selected for duty. Once selected, jurors could be bribed or intimidated to act in a certain manner on duty. It could also involve making unauthorized contact with them for the purpose of introducing prohibited outside information and then arguing for a [[mistrial (law)|mistrial]].

==Republic of Ireland==
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], the [[Special Criminal Court]] is a three-judge, juryless court which tries cases based on a majority vote. Use of the Special Criminal Court is restricted to cases where "ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice", and is allowed for by the [[Constitution of Ireland]].
While the power was initially created to prevent court cases being subverted by juries sympathetic to the defendant, the Special Criminal Court was established in 1972 to handle terrorism-related cases resulting from [[the Troubles]], when the risk of jury intimidation was high. It has since been used to try cases of high-profile gang leaders and other high-risk non-terrorism cases where normal juries risk intimidation or revenge.

==United Kingdom==
In [[Great Britain]], the [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]] allows for non-jury trials when there is danger of jury tampering, or where jury tampering has taken place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/l_to_o/non_jury_trials/|title=Non Jury Trials: Legal Guidance|last=CPS|date=10 January 2008|work=The Crown Prosecution Service|accessdate=2009-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 June 2009, the [[Court of Appeal]] in [[England and Wales]] made a landmark ruling that resulted in the [[Lord Chief Justice]], [[Lord Judge]], allowing the first-ever [[criminal trial]] to be held without a [[jury]] by invoking Section 44 of the [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]]. The case in question involved four men accused of an [[armed robbery]] at [[Heathrow Airport]] in February 2004. After three juries either failed to reach verdicts or were discharged, the fourth trial of the case took place before a single judge, and ended on 31 March 2010 with guilty verdicts for all four accused.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/8582354.stm BBC News: Gang of four convicted of £1.75m armed Heathrow raid, 31 March 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; The UK had previously established non-jury courts in Northern Ireland, known as [[Diplock Courts]].

Levels of jury tampering were reported in 2002 to be a "major problem" by the deputy commissioner of the London Metropolitan Police&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/cases-of-jury-tampering-soar-137633.html|title=Cases of jury tampering soar|date=29 December 2002|work=Independent|accessdate=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2003 to be "worryingly high" in [[Merseyside]] by the then Chief Constable [[Norman Bettison]] and the then Home Secretary [[David Blunkett]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/merseyside/3282049.stm|title=Blunkett tackles jury tampering|date=18 November 2003|work=BBC News|accessdate=2009-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cases==

==Early life==
In 1965 at the age of 17, he served in the South's [[Republic of Vietnam Air Force]]. He was assigned to [[South Vietnam]]'s "Black Eagle" Fighter Squadron.[https://web.archive.org/web/20041204120836/http://citypaper.net/articles/031199/coverstory.shtml]

==In exile==

In 1984 Ly was granted asylum to the United States and he received a [[:Image:Reaganletter.jpg#file|letter]] from then President [[Ronald Reagan]] for his struggle to attain freedom from captivity in Vietnam.[https://web.archive.org/web/20041204120836/http://citypaper.net/articles/031199/coverstory.shtml]

He earned a master's degree in Political Science at the [[University of New Orleans]] and has written a novel in Vietnamese.

He became good friends with former Republic of Vietnam Air Force Colonel An Vo. He also played a large role in the Vietnamese community in New Orleans.

==First return to Vietnam==

In the 1990s he decided to take up [[anti-communist]] activities, and in 1992, he hijacked a [[Vietnam Airlines]] airliner. Ly Tong's copilot claimed that he was forced to fly over [[Ho Chi Minh City]] so that Ly Tong could drop thousands of leaflets calling for insurrection against the communist government of Vietnam.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6520615.stm]

He parachuted and jumped from the plane, but he landed in a swamp and was apprehended by Vietnamese soldiers and sentenced to 20 years. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6520615.stm]

In 1998 the Vietnamese government released him as part of an amnesty program along with other democracy activists. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/5322432.stm]

Colonel An Vo from New Orleans is said to have gone back to help him become free.

==First trip to Cuba==

On January 1, 2000, he flew over [[Havana]], [[Cuba]], and dropped leaflets encouraging the Cuban people to rise up and revolt against the government of [[Fidel Castro]]. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/588234.stm]

On his return to Kendall-Tamiami Executive Airport in Florida, he was detained and questioned by [[U.S. Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement|U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] but was released without charges. The [[Federal Aviation Administration]] suspended his pilots' license. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/588234.stm][http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/588573.stm]

On his return to Florida, he was hailed a hero by some Cuban-Americans and there was a return parade for his flight over Cuba.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv05wBQruGg]

==Second return to Vietnam==

On November 17, 2000, he and a copilot flew to [[Thailand]], from where he flew to drop 50,000 pamphlets calling for armed demonstrations against the communist government of Vietnam over [[Ho Chi Minh City]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/05/18/national/national_30004309.php Brief taste of freedom for Ly Tong], ''The Nation'', May 18, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 he was released by the Thai government and returned to the United States [https://web.archive.org/web/20120915225531/http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&amp;item_no=141789&amp;version=1&amp;template_id=45&amp;parent_id=25]

==Hunger strike 2008==

In February through March 2008, he conducted a [[hunger strike]] at [[San Jose City Hall]], protesting efforts by city councilwoman [[Madison Nguyen]] to name a district of the city "New Saigon Business District" instead of "Little Saigon".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_8311926|last=May|first=Patrick|date=2008-02-20|accessdate=2008-02-28|title='Little Saigon' hunger striker: 'I'll continue until I die'|periodical=San Jose Mercury News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.ktvu.com/news/15587408/detail.html|periodical=KTVU News|title=Councilmen Help End 'Little Saigon' Hunger Strike|date=2008-03-13|accessdate=2010-10-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080623185455/http://www.ktvu.com/news/15587408/detail.html|archivedate=2008-06-23|df=}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==In South Korea==
On August 26, 2008, Ly Tong rented a plane &amp; pilot for travel. But a short time after taking off, Tong told the pilot to fly the airplane over North Korea so that he could spread anti-communist leaflets to the North Koreans. The pilot told him that due to the lack of fuel they had to return to Seoul to refill, whilst sending an emergency hijacking signal to the airport authorities.  Upon landing, Tong was arrested and briefly detained by the airport authorities.[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-10699376]

==Attack on Dam Vinh Hung==

He was arrested again in July 2010 for a [[pepper spray]] assault on Vietnamese singer [[Dam Vinh Hung]] at a concert in [[Santa Clara, California]].[https://web.archive.org/web/20101024230641/http://english.vovnews.vn/Home/US-police-arrest-Ly-Tong-for-attacking-Vietnamese-singer/20107/117672.vov][http://www.saigon-gpdaily.com.vn/Law/2010/7/84183/][https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-10699376]

This singer was supposedly a singer supporting North Vietnam and its communist values. This concert took place in California where many Vietnamese object to the communist values they escaped from. Security was tight, as people figured there would be an assault against the singer. Ly Tong dressed up as a cross-dresser to escape security and pepper spray the singer in the face as he was being handed a flower on stage.

He was convicted of two misdemeanors—simple assault and resisting arrest—and two felonies, including using tear gas and second-degree burglary with the intent to commit a felony. On June 22, 2012, he was sentenced to 6 months in jail and 3 years probation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_20919194/san-jose-despite-pleas-leniency-judge-sentences-activist&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1980, in a flat in [[Welling]], South East London, David Pacy,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.investegate.co.uk/article.aspx?id=20080325125433W2407&lt;/ref&gt; Managing Director and Brian Rottger, Technical Director founded Metrovideo. Its principal activity was tape sales to advertising agencies such as [[J. Walter Thompson|JWT]] (formerly J. Walter Thompson Co.), [[Saatchi &amp; Saatchi]] and [[Young &amp; Rubicam|Y&amp;R]] (formerly Young &amp; Rubicam).

The company soon relocated to Landsdown Road in Stockwell and then, in April 1984, to the Old Bacon Factory in Great Suffolk Street,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thetimenow.com/united_kingdom/london/audio_visual_services-92/metrovideo_ltd-1492781&lt;/ref&gt; London SE1.

In early 1986, the business was sold to WPP plc, a British, multinational advertising and public relations company founded by [[Sir Martin Sorrell|Martin Sorrell]]. Metrovideo was the third company to be acquired by the Group.

Metrovideo later acquired a number of regional video businesses for itself including Horizon Video and Still Frame Video in the South of England and Teletape Anglia in [[Cambridge]]. This expanded the sales, installation, service, AV hire and technical event production&lt;ref&gt;http://www.incentivetravel.co.uk/news/venuesevents/22615-variety-hosts-an-evening-of-magic-at-vinopolis&lt;/ref&gt;| areas of the company. A broadcast division of the company was located in offices in London’s [[Soho]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/metro-to-expand-broadcast-arm/164686.article&lt;/ref&gt;   All of these businesses traded under the Metro Group banner.

In 1990, Metro launched a full-service production business called G Force which later changed its name to Clever Media.  Clever Media was then merged into another WPP operating company.

In 1997, the company extended its operation into [[Scotland]] by establishing an office and equipment warehouse in [[Edinburgh]].

In 2007 the Company was renamed as Metro Broadcast Ltd.   In 2012 Metro Broadcast relocated its head office and main business premises to its current location in Oval, South London.  In 2014 it acquired additional workshop space to house its set and staging department.  Today, the London business is led by Managing Director Mary Metcalfe&lt;ref&gt;http://www.citmagazine.com/article/1294808/metro-broadcast-appoints-new-creative-lead&lt;/ref&gt; and the Scottish business is led by Managing Director Oscar Askin.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eventindustrynews.co.uk/brand-marketing/metro-ecosse-appointed-national-theatre-scotland-help-deliver-24-hour-live-streamed-event-theme-independence&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3512">{{For|the Iranian new year festival|Nowruz}}
[[File:Coptic Orthodox Cross.jpg|right|150px|The Coptic Orthodox Cross]]
'''Nayrouz''' or '''Neyrouz''' (Arabic {{lang|ar|ناروز}} Nārūz &lt; Persian {{lang|fa|نوروز}} Nawruz) is a feast when [[martyr]]s and [[confessor]]s are commemorated within the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Orthodox Church]]. Celebrated on September 11, the day is both the start of the Coptic new year and its first month, [[Thout]].

The Feast of Nayrouz marks the first day of the Coptic year. Multiple theories have been proposed for the origin of the word. One popular theory, repeated on many Websites, is that the word is Egyptian in origin: Ignorant of the Egyptian language for the most part, the Arabs confused the Egyptian new year's celebrations, which the Egyptians called the feast of ''Ni-Iarōou'' (Bohairic {{lang|cop|ⲛⲓ-ⲓⲁⲣⲱⲟⲩ}} lit. the feast of the rivers), with the Persian feast of [[Nowruz]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://freecopts.net/english/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=302|title=Freecopts.net|website=freecopts.net|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; from which the word ''Nayrouz'' etymologically comes. The misnomer remains today, and the celebrations of the Egyptian new year on the first day of the month of Thout are known as the Nayrouz. Others dispute this view, and hold that the word is fully Persian. They note that the word ''Nayrouz'' does not occur anywhere in the [[Synaxarium]], that there is no evidence of the use of the supposed Coptic etymon in historical sources, and that a Persian etymology sufficiently explains the current name. The recorded Bohairic name for the new year was {{lang|cop|ⲡⲓⲭⲗⲟⲙ ⲛ̀ⲧⲉϯⲣⲟⲙⲡⲓ}} pi-klhom inte-tirompi, "the crown of the year."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Coptic Syndrome of Trying to Find Coptic Origins to Arab Words: Nayrouz as an Example |url=https://copticliterature.wordpress.com/2015/09/14/the-coptic-syndrome-of-trying-to-find-coptic-origin-to-arab-words-nayrouz-as-an-example/ |website=On Coptic Nationalism فى القومية القبطية |accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Resources |url=https://copticsounds.wordpress.com/resources/ |website=copticsounds |accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its celebration falls on the 1st day of the month of [[Thout]], the first month of the Egyptian year, which for AD 1901 to 2098 usually coincides with 11 September, except before a Gregorian leap year when it begins September 12.

==The Coptic year==
The chronology of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church]] begins when [[Diocletian]] became [[Roman emperor]] in 284 AD. His reign was marked by torture of Christians to force them to deny their faith, as well as by mass executions, especially in Egypt. It is believed this time was one of the worst times that the Coptic church faced, known to believers as "[[Era of Martyrs|the martyrdom era]]". Hence, the Coptic year is identified by the abbreviation A.M. (for ''[[Anno Martyrum]]'' or "Year of the Martyrs"). It should not be confused with the A.M. abbreviation used for the unrelated Jewish year, which is ''[[Anno Mundi]]'' ("year of the world").

'''Onychectomy''', popularly known as '''declawing''', is an operation to remove an animal's [[claws]] surgically by means of the [[amputation]] of all or part of the [[distal phalanges]], or end bones, of the animal's toes.  Because the claw develops from germinal tissue within the third phalanx, amputation of the bone is necessary to fully remove the claw. The terms "onychectomy" (origin: Greek ὄνυξ ''onycho'', nail + ἐκτομή ''ektome'', excision) and "declawing" imply mere claw removal, but a more appropriate description would be phalangectomy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/phalangectomy |title=Phalangectomy &amp;#124; definition of phalangectomy by Medical dictionary |website=Medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; excision of toe bone.

Although common in North America,&lt;ref name=Patronek&gt;{{cite journal |author=Patronek GJ |title=Assessment of claims of short- and long-term complications associated with onychectomy in cats |journal=J. Am. Vet. Med. Assoc. |volume=219 |issue=7 |pages=932–7 |date=Oct 2001 |pmid=11601788 |doi=10.2460/javma.2001.219.932  |issn=0003-1488 }}&lt;/ref&gt; declawing is considered an act of [[animal cruelty]] in many countries (see "Declawing practices" below).

==Medically indicated onychectomy==
The amputation of the distal phalanx is indicated in case of chronic inflammatory processes, tumours,  persistent and severe infections and gangrene that are limited to the distal phalanx. The procedure is usually limited to the affected claw, leaving the healthy claws (if any) intact.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

==Elective onychectomy==
In North America, declawing is commonly performed on cats to prevent damage to household possessions by scratching and to prevent scratching of people.&lt;ref name=Patronek/&gt; The surgery involves amputating the distal phalanges of all toes on the front paws, and sometimes the rear paws as well. Although no precise figures are available, peer-reviewed veterinary journal articles estimate that approximately 25% of domestic cats in North America have been declawed.&lt;ref name=Patronek/&gt; Some privately owned apartment buildings in the U.S. ban cats unless they have been declawed. This is not the case in publicly subsidized housing, however, because in 2007 the U.S. Congress enacted legislation that forbids public housing authorities from having such rules.&lt;ref name=HUDBan&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hsus.typepad.com/wayne/2007/07/declawing.html |title=Congress Takes Swipe at Pet Declawing - Wayne Pacelle: A Humane Nation &amp;#124; HSUS President &amp; CEO |website=Hsus.typepad.com |date=2007-07-12 |accessdate=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laws have been passed in California (2012) and Rhode Island (2013) that ban landlords from requiring the declawing cats as a condition of occupancy.

Some North American veterinarians hold the position that people with compromised immune systems, due to conditions such as [[AIDS]], should have their cats declawed to prevent [[Cat-scratch fever|health risks to themselves]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.askthecatdoctor.com/declawingcats.html |title=Declawing Cats: The Truth |publisher=Ask The Cat Doctor |date= |accessdate=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Centers for Disease Control affirms declawing as an option, but acknowledges the controversy and offers the alternative of avoiding situations where scratching might occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/bartonella/veterinarians/ |title=For Veterinarians &amp;#124; Bartonella &amp;#124; CDC |website=Cdc.gov |date=2015-12-14 |accessdate=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5108a1.htm |title=Guidelines for Preventing Opportunistic Infections Among HIV-Infected Persons - 2002 |website=Cdc.gov |date= |accessdate=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) suggests avoiding rough play. As a precautionary measure, ''Familydoctor.org'' advises people should avoid provoking cats into scratching them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://familydoctor.org/familydoctor/en/diseases-conditions/cat-scratch-disease/prevention.html |title=Cat-Scratch Disease &amp;#124; Prevention |website=Familydoctor.org |date=2014-02-20 |accessdate=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==
[[File:Онихэктомия.jpg|thumb|Onychectomy being performed]]
Despite the prevalence of elective onychectomy in North America, no standard practices exist regarding the surgical techniques or surgical tools used, the administration of post-operative analgesics or other follow-up care, or the optimal age or other attributes of cats undergoing the procedure.&lt;ref name=Patronek/&gt; There are three surgical methods: scalpel blade, guillotine trimmers, and laser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Shelley Knudsen |url=http://www.allfelinehospital.com/site/view/191340_declaws.pml |title=Declaws |website=Allfelinehospital.com |date= |accessdate=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recovery, health and behavioral effects==
Onychectomy is an orthopedic surgery involving 1 (or more) separate phalangeal amputations, which requires general anesthesia and multi-modal pain management before, during, and after surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animalsheltering.org/resources/sample/cat-samples/chronic-declaw-pain-article.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=August 1, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030202111/http://www.animalsheltering.org/resources/sample/cat-samples/chronic-declaw-pain-article.pdf |archivedate=October 30, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a survey of 276 cat owners, 34% reported post-surgical discomfort in their cats while 78% reported primarily tenderness.&lt;ref&gt;Landsberg GM. Cat owners' attitudes toward declawing. Anthrozoos 1991;4:192-197.&lt;/ref&gt; Recovery time took from three days to two weeks. Increased biting strength or frequency was reported in 4% of cats, but overall, 96% of owners were satisfied with the surgery. Some other studies found lameness after onychectomy lasting &gt;3 days,&lt;ref&gt;Landsberg GM. Feline scratching and destruction and the effects of declawing.

Vet Surg 1994; 23: 274-280.&lt;/ref&gt;

At one veterinary teaching hospital, between 50 and 80% of cats had one or more medical complications post-surgery; 19.8% developed complications after release.&lt;ref&gt;Tobias KS. Feline onychectomy at a teaching institution: a retrospective study of 163 cases. Vet Surg 1994; 23:274-280.&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies have reported medical post-op complication rates as 24% (Jankowski 1998), 53% (Martinez 1993), 1.4% (Pollari 1996),&lt;ref&gt;Pollari FL, Bonnett BN, Bamsey SC, et al. Postoperative complications of elective surgeries in dogs and cats determined by examining electronic and paper medical records. J Am Vet Med Assoc 1996; 208: 1882-1886.&lt;/ref&gt; 82.5% for blade and 51.5% for shear technique (Tobias 1994), and 80% (Yeon 2001). Reported medical complications include: pain, hemorrhage, laceration of paw pads, swelling, reluctance to bear weight on affected limb, neuropraxia (transient motor paralysis), radial nerve damage, lameness, infection, abscess, tissue necrosis, wound dehiscence, incomplete healing, protrusion of 2nd (middle) phalanx, claw regrowth, scurs (growth of deformed claw segments), retention of flexor process of third phalanx, chronic draining tracts, self-mutilation, dermatitis, lethargy, palmigrade stance (walking on wrists), chronic intermittent lameness, chronic pain syndrome, flexor tendon contracture, and cystitis (stress-associated bladder inflammation). Claw regrowth has been seen by veterinarians anywhere from weeks up to 15 years after onychectomy.(Veterinary Information Network).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vin.com |title=Veterinary Information Network (VIN) - For Veterinarians, By Veterinarians |publisher=VIN |date=2014-10-06 |accessdate=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In post-operation follow ups Yeon, et al. (2001) found six of thirty-nine cats (15%~) were house soiling and seven (18%) had increased biting frequency or intensity. The authors concluded based on this and previous studies that "behavioral problems following onychectomy were not pronounced".  Follow-ups in this study were conducted an average of eleven and a half months after surgery.&lt;ref&gt;Yeon SC, Flanders JA, Scarlett JM, et al. Attitudes of owners regarding tendonectomy and onychectomy in cats. J Am Vet Med Assoc 2001;218:43-47.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Behavior problems are a primary cause of cats being relinquished to shelters.  Proponents of declawing argue that declawing reduces undesired behaviors (scratching) and thus reduces the likelihood of relinquishment.  Opponents of declawing argue the surgery itself creates more behavioral problems leading to relinquishment of cats. A study by Patronek et al. (1996) found in a univariate analysis that declawed cats were only 63% as likely to be relinquished as non-declawed cats.  A multivariate analysis conducted in the same study shows odds of being relinquished to a shelter were 89% higher for declawed cats.  The authors concluded that the conflicting results of the two analysis made it difficult to interpret the effects of declawing.  In a shelter setting, more declawed cats were reported by their owners to have problems with inappropriate elimination (house soiling).  However, this study ultimately found no association between the declaw status of cats and their aggression towards humans or frequency of inappropriate elimination (house soiling).&lt;ref&gt;Patronek, GJ, Glickman LT, Beck AM, et al. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8755976 "Risk factors for relinquishment of cats to an animal shelter"]. ''J Am Vet Med Assoc.'' 1996;209:582–588.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patronek GJ. "Assessment of claims of short- and long-term complications associated with onychectomy in cats". ''J Am Vet Med Assoc.'' 2001 Oct 1;219(7):932-937.&lt;/ref&gt;

In another study, 16% of declawed cats developed behavior problems (12% biting), and more declawed (55%) than clawed (45%) cats were referred to a vet teaching hospital for behavior problems. This was the second-longest follow-up period (2 years) ever examined.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett M, Houpt KA, Erb HN. Effects of declawing on feline behavior. Comp Anim Pract 1988;2:7-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Patronek, Glickman and Beck (1996) found no association between the declaw status of cats and the frequency of inappropriate elimination (house soiling).&lt;ref&gt;Patronek, GJ, Glickman LT, Beck AM, et al. Risk factors for relinquishment of cats to an animal shelter. J Am Vet Med Assoc 1996;209:582–588.&lt;/ref&gt;

In another study of 275 cats, 11 cats (4%) developed or had worse behavior problems post-declawing; 5 clients (less than 1%) reported that their cats had developed litterbox and biting problems.&lt;ref&gt;Landsberg GM. Cat owners’ attitudes toward declawing. Anthrozoos 1991;4:192-197.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chronic pain syndrome of onychectomy has been described by a pain management specialist as leading to unwanted behaviors, including increased aggression.&lt;ref&gt;Gaynor J. Chronic pain syndrome feline onychectomy. NAVC Clinicians’ Brief. 2005 April.&lt;/ref&gt;

A prospective study comparing declawing with tendonectomy noted many medical as well as behavior complications.&lt;ref&gt;Jankowski AJ, Brown DC, Duval J, et al. Comparison of effects of elective tenectomy or onychectomy in cats. J Am Vet Med Assoc. 1998;213:370-373.&lt;/ref&gt;

An internet survey found that declawed cats were more likely to jump on tables and counters and house-soiled more than non-declawed cats (25% vs. 15%).&lt;ref&gt;Morgan M, Houpt KA. Feline behavior problems: the influence of declawing. Anthrozoos. 1989;3:50-53.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Declawing practices==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Cat]] --&gt;
Laws and policies governing onychectomy vary around the world. For example, many [[Europe]]an countries prohibit or significantly restrict the practice, as do [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Japan]], and [[Turkey]].  It is banned in at least 22 countries. The list below gives an overview of the situation in different parts of the world.

===Australia===
In [[Australia]], declawing has never been common, and for all practical purpose, does not exist. Nationwide legislation was recently enacted that prohibits the declawing of cats except for medical need of the cat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ava.com.au/public-6 |title=Laws and regulations &amp;#124; Australian Veterinary Association |website=Ava.com.au |date= |accessdate=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian Veterinary Association's policy states: "Surgical alteration to the natural state of an animal is acceptable only if it is necessary for the health and welfare of the animal concerned. Performance of any surgical procedure for other than legitimate medical reasons is unacceptable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ava.com.au/policy/31-surgical-alteration-natural-state-animals |title=Surgical alteration to the natural state of animals &amp;#124; Australian Veterinary Association |website=Ava.com.au |date= |accessdate=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===
In [[Brazil]], declawing is not allowed by the Federal Council of Veterinary Medicine. '''''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcav.unesp.br/hv/resolucao_877.pdf |title=UNESP: Câmpus de Jaboticabal - Faculdade de Ciências Agrárias e Veterinárias |website=Fcav.unesp.br |date= |accessdate=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
Declawing has been banned by the Veterinary Associations of three Canadian provinces; Nova Scotia &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/nova-scotia-becomes-1st-province-to-ban-cat-declawing-1.4577216|title='1 declaw is 1 too many': Nova Scotia cat declawing ban takes effect today {{!}} CBC News|work=CBC|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, British Columbia &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/proceedure-will-only-be-allowed-for-medical-reasons-1.4653693|title=B.C.

Newfoundland and Labrador has also passed a resolution against declawing surgery, which will be effective as of January 1, 2019.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/declaw-cats-ban-1.4895247|title=No more declawing of cats, N.L.

===Israel===
In [[Israel]], the Knesset Education Committee voted unanimously to send a bill banning the declawing of cats not for medical reasons. The bill has passed second and third readings on November 28, 2011, effectively making declawing a criminal offense with penalty of 1 year in prison or a fine of 75,000 Shekels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/Flash.aspx/224508 |title=C'tee: OKs Bill to Ban Declawing of Cats - Latest News Briefs - Arutz Sheva |website=Israelnationalnews.com |date=2011-11-14 |accessdate=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
In many European countries the practice is forbidden either under the terms of the [[European Convention for the Protection of Pet Animals]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=European Convention for the Protection of Pet Animals, Chapter II - Principles for the keeping of pet animals, Article 10(1) | url=http://www.animallaw.info/treaties/itceceets125.htm|accessdate =August 22, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or under local animal abuse laws, unless it is for "veterinary medical reasons or for the benefit of any particular animal."
Some European countries go further, such as [[Finland]], [[Sweden]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jordbruksverket.se/amnesomraden/djur/hundarochkatter/skotselochtillsyn/kuperingtatueringavlivningochandraingrepp.4.207049b811dd8a513dc80001997.html |title=Kupering, tatuering, avlivning och andra ingrepp - Jordbruksverket |website=Jordbruksverket.se |date=2016-04-21 |accessdate=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Estonia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.riigiteataja.ee/akt/13118797?leiaKehtiv|title=Loomakaitseseadus – Riigi Teataja|last=|first=|date=|website=Riigiteataja.ee|language=et|accessdate=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Netherlands]], [[Germany]] and [[Switzerland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Tierschutzverordung (Swiss  Animal Protection Ordinance), 2008, §24(a) | url=https://www.admin.ch/opc/de/classified-compilation/20080796/index.html | accessdate=August 31, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where declawing cats for non-medical reasons is always illegal under their laws against [[cruelty to animals]].

====Austria====
In [[Austria]], the Federal Act on the Protection of Animals, in Section 7, states, surgical procedures "carried out for other than therapeutic or diagnostic purposes...are prohibited, in particular...declawing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokumente/Erv/ERV_2004_1_118/ERV_2004_1_118.pdf |format=PDF |title=Federal Act on the Protection of Animals (Animal Protection Act – TSchG) |website=Ris.bka.gv.at |accessdate=2016-05-22}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Kingdom====
In the [[United Kingdom]], declawing was outlawed by the [[Animal Welfare Act 2006]], which explicitly prohibited "interference with the sensitive tissues or bone structure of the animal, otherwise than for the purposes of its medical treatment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2006/ukpga_20060045_en.pdf |title=Animal Welfare Act 2006 |website=Opsi.gov.uk |date=2015-10-19 |accessdate=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even before the 2006 Act, however, declawing was extremely uncommon, to the extent that most people had never seen a declawed cat. The procedure was considered cruel by almost all British [[veterinarian|vet]]s, who refused to perform it except on medical grounds.  The ''Guide to Professional Conduct'' of the [[Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons]] stated that declawing was "only acceptable where, in the opinion of the veterinary surgeon, injury to the animal is likely to occur during normal activity. It is not acceptable if carried out for the convenience of the owner ... the removal of claws, particularly those which are [[weight bearing]], to preclude damage to furnishings is not acceptable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdb.org/vets/mutilations.htm |title=RCVS Report on Animal Mutilations |website=Cdb.org |date= |accessdate=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Declawing was outlawed in [[West Hollywood]], California, in 2003, the first such ban in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/apr/08/local/me-declaw8 | work=Los Angeles Times | title=Declawing of Cats Is Banned in West Hollywood | date=April 8, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ordinance was authored by West Hollywood Councilmember [[John Duran]] and sponsored by [[The Paw Project]], a non-profit organization started by Dr. Jennifer Conrad based in Santa Monica, CA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://veterinarynews.dvm360.com/dvm/Feline+Center/San-Francisco-considers-ban-on-cat-declaw-surgerie/ArticleStandard/Article/detail/611833 |title=San Francisco considers ban on cat declaw surgeries |website=Veterinarynews.dvm360.com |date= |accessdate=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The California Veterinary Medical Association challenged the law in court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CVMA Wins Lawsuit to Overturn the West Hollywood Ban on Animal Declawing|url=http://www.cvma.net/doc.asp?ID=2801|publisher=California Veterinary Medical Association|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060208181758/http://www.cvma.net/doc.asp?ID=2801|archivedate=2006-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CVMA maintained that West Hollywood had overstepped its municipal authority by enacting an ordinance that infringed on licensed professionals’ state-granted rights. It did not directly address declawing as an animal welfare issue.  The CVMA initially prevailed in Superior Court, but in June 2007, the [[California Court of Appeal]] overturned the lower court ruling, thus reinstating the law banning declawing in West Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/06/23/DECLAW.TMP |work=The San Francisco Chronicle |title=CALIFORNIA / Court says city can ban declawing |first=Bob |last=Egelko |date=June 22, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222055238/http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2007%2F06%2F23%2FDECLAW.TMP |archivedate=December 22, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, California became the first state in the USA to enact a statewide ban on the declawing of wild and exotic cats. The bill was introduced by California Assemblymember Paul Koretz and sponsored by the Paw Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Koretz |url=ftp://leginfo.public.ca.gov/pub/03-04/bill/asm/ab_1851-1900/ab_1857_cfa_20040615_135639_sen_comm.html |title=AB 1857 Assembly Bill - Bill Analysis |website=Leginfo.public.ca.gov |date= |accessdate=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2006, the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] enacted a ban on declawing of all wild and exotic animals held by USDA-licensed owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Information Sheet on Declawing and Tooth Removal|url=http://www.aphis.usda.gov/ac/publications/declaw_tooth.pdf|publisher=USDA|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927143015/http://www.aphis.usda.gov/ac/publications/declaw_tooth.pdf|archivedate=2006-09-27|date=August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2007, the city of [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]], Virginia outlawed declawing by persons other than veterinarians (Municipal Code Sec. 6.1-78.1).&lt;ref name="municode1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library1.municode.com/default-test/home.htm?infobase%3D10121%26doc_action%3Dwhatsnew |title=Archived copy |accessdate=December 13, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091221225512/http://library1.municode.com/default-test/home.htm?infobase=10121&amp;doc_action=whatsnew |archivedate=December 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="municode1"/&gt;

In 2009, the California state legislature approved a measure, sponsored by the California Veterinary Medical Association (CVMA), intended to stop other cities from passing bans similar to West Hollywood's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Aanestad |url=http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/09-10/bill/sen/sb_0751-0800/sb_762_cfa_20090506_100418_sen_floor.html |title=SB 762 Senate Bill - Bill Analysis |website=Leginfo.ca.gov |date= |accessdate=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill included all professions licensed by the state Department of Consumer Affairs, and it was signed into law by the Governor in July, 2009. However, the law's effective date, January 1, 2010, provided enough time for seven more California cities to pass local bans against the declawing of domestic cats:  [[Los Angeles]], [[San Francisco]], [[Burbank, California|Burbank]], [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]], [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]], and [[Culver City, California|Culver City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pawproject.org/legislation/ |title=Animal Welfare Legislation |publisher=The Paw Project |date= |accessdate=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, a California bill, authored by Senator [[Fran Pavley]] and sponsored by the Paw Project, was signed into law that prohibits landlords from requiring declawing and devocalization of animals as a condition of tenancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Pavley |url=http://leginfo.ca.gov/pub/11-12/bill/sen/sb_1201-1250/sb_1229_bill_20120926_chaptered.html |title=SB 1229 Senate Bill - CHAPTERED |website=Leginfo.ca.gov |date= |accessdate=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the state of Rhode Island enacted a law, similar to the California law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webserver.rilin.state.ri.us/News/pr1.asp?prid=8906 |title=State of Rhode Island General Assembly |website=Webserver.rilin.state.ri.us |date= |accessdate=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; prohibiting landlords from requiring declawing as a condition of occupancy.

[[Denver]], [[Colorado]] approved the first ban on declawing in a U.S. city outside California in November, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.denverpost.com/2017/11/13/cat-declawing-ban-denver-city-council/ |title=Denver approves first cat-declawing ban in a U.S. city outside California |last=Murray |first=Jon |date=2017-11-13 |website=The Denver Post |publisher=Digital First Media |access-date=2017-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ethical viewpoints on declawing in the US====
Declawing is widely practiced but ethically controversial within the American veterinary community.&lt;ref name=Patronek/&gt; Some American and Canadian veterinarians endorse the procedure, while some have criticized and refused to perform it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.declaw.com/list.asp |title=Veterinarians who do not declaw |website=Declaw.com |date= |accessdate=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two animal protection organizations in the US, the [[Humane Society of the United States]] and the [[American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]], discourage the procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pawproject.com/html/faqs.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=June 24, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614165354/http://www.pawproject.com/HTML/faqs.asp |archivedate=June 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Humane Society of the United States has supported legislation banning or restricting declawing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pawproject.com/html/acknow.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=June 24, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808101151/http://www.pawproject.com/html/acknow.asp |archivedate=August 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Multiple surveys and polls taken from 2011 reveal that the majority of United States cat owners are against declawing, believing the practice to be cruel. These surveys also suggest that the U.S. public believes that the majority of veterinarians who perform declawings only do so because it is a lucrative practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Name * |url=http://www.metaphoricalplatypus.com/articles/animals/cats/cat-facts/polls-show-large-majority-against-declawing-cats-majority-also-favours-anti-declaw-laws/ |title=Polls Show Large Majority Against Declawing Cats; Majority Also Favours Anti-Declaw Laws |publisher=Metaphorical Platypus |date=2011-04-06 |accessdate=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposition to attempts to ban or restrict declawing has come from veterinary trade organizations, such as the California Veterinary Medical Association. On the other hand, the [[American Veterinary Medical Association]] states that declawing "should be considered only after attempts have been made to prevent the cat from using its claws destructively or when its clawing presents a [[zoonosis|zoonotic]] risk for its owner(s)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.avma.org/KB/Policies/Pages/Declawing-of-Domestic-Cats.aspx |title=Declawing of Domestic Cats |website=Avma.org |date= |accessdate=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surveys suggest that 95% of declaw surgeries are done to protect furniture.&lt;ref&gt;Declaw Update, ''Pulse,'' Southern California Veterinary Medical Association, November 2009, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternatives to declawing==

===Surgical===
[[Tendonectomy]] involves cutting the deep digital flexor tendon of each claw, resulting in the cat being unable to move its distal phalanges. Without the ability to expose its claws, the cat is unable to wear down or groom its claws. For this reason, the cat subsequently requires regular nail clippings to prevent its claws from growing into its paw pads. A 1998 study published in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association comparing cats undergoing onychectomy to cats undergoing tendonectomy found that, although the cats undergoing tendonectomy appeared to suffer less pain immediately post-operatively, there was no significant difference in postoperative lameness, bleeding, or infection between the two groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Jankowski AJ, Brown DC, Duval J, etal |title=Comparison of effects of elective tenectomy or onychectomy in cats |journal=J. Am. Vet. Med. Assoc. |volume=213 |issue=3 |pages=370–3 |date=Aug 1998 |pmid=9702225 |doi=  |issn=0003-1488 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2005 study found no evidence that tendonectomy is less painful than onychectomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cloutier | first1 = S. | last2 = Newberry | first2 = R.

===Non-surgical===
[[File:Myllissa-Oscar the tabby cat with red paws nail covers-01.jpg|thumb|Cat with red nail caps]]
According to board-certified veterinary behaviorist Dr. Gary Landsberg, "For most cats, appropriate client advice and a little effort is all that is needed to prevent scratching problems.”&lt;ref&gt;Veterinary Information Network, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; However, many veterinary practitioners are unwilling or unable to offer solutions to behavioral problems such as scratching, other than declawing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Patronek|first1=GJ|last2=Dodman|first2=NH|title=Attitudes, procedures, and delivery of behavior services by veterinarians in small animal practice|journal=Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association|date=1 December 1999|volume=215|issue=11|pages=1606-11|pmid=14567423}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A non-surgical alternative to declawing is the application of vinyl nail caps that are affixed to the claws with nontoxic glue, requiring periodic replacement when the cat sheds its claw sheaths (usually every four to six weeks, depending on the cat's scratching habits).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://walnutcreek.patch.com/articles/arf-column-the-itch-to-scratch |title=ARF Column: The Itch To Scratch &amp;#124; Patch |website=Walnutcreek.patch.com |date=2011-12-11 |accessdate=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other alternatives include regular nail trimming; directing scratching behavior to inexpensive cardboard scratchers or [[scratching post]]s, or emery scratching pads that dull the claws; rotary sanding devices; covering furniture or using double-sided sticky tape or sheets such as Sticky Paws; remote aversive devices such as Scat Mats; or acceptance of cats' scratching behavior.

The '''PAIN Exhibit''' "is an educational, visual arts exhibit from artists with chronic pain with their art expressing some facet of the pain experience. The mission of the PAIN Exhibit is to educate health care providers and the public about chronic pain through art," and to give a voice to those who have [[chronic pain]].&lt;ref name="PE_Mission"&gt;http://www.painexhibit.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[undertreatment of pain]] is a [[public health]] issue&lt;ref name="undertreatment"&gt;http://www.painpolicy.wisc.edu/Achieving_Balance/EG2008.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; with an estimated 75 million [[Americans]] suffering from chronic nonmalignant pain.&lt;ref name="75mAmericans"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0885-3924(01)00320-7 |vauthors=Adams NJ, Plane MB, Fleming MF, Mundt MP, Saunders LA, Stauffacher EA |title=Opioids and the treatment of chronic pain in a primary care sample |journal=J Pain Symptom Manage |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=791–6 |date=September 2001 |pmid=11532592 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0885-3924(01)00320-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PAIN Exhibit was started in 2001 by Mark Collen, and the PainExhibit.com website was created by James Gregory. The site was launched {{#dateformat:March 8, 2004}} and is available in both English and Spanish languages. PainExhibit.com currently contains 92 art images which are divided amongst nine themes.[http://painexhibit.com/galleryindex.html]

Since its inception in 2001, Mark Collen has worked to further the mission of the PAIN Exhibit by writing articles for pain publications,&lt;ref name="CollenArticle1"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/15360280802251231 |author=Collen M |title=The case for Pain Insomnia Depression Syndrome (PIDS): a symptom cluster in chronic nonmalignant pain |journal=J Pain Palliat Care Pharmacother |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=221–5 |year=2008 |pmid=19042853 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CollenArticle2"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Collen M |title=Placebos in Pain Management |journal=Practical Pain Management |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=28–9 |date=Nov–Dec 2007 |url=http://www.ppmjournal.com/abstract.asp?articleid=P0711F03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CollenArticle3"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Collen M |title=In my opinion... opioid tolerance |journal=J Pain Palliat Care Pharmacother |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=35–7 |year=2007 |pmid=17430828 |doi=10.1080/j354v21n01_08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CollenArticle4"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Collen M |title=Art and Pain |journal=The Pain Practitioner |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=75 |date=Summer 2006 |format=PDF |url=http://www.aapainmanage.org/literature/PainPrac/ppsummer06download.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CollenArticle5"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Collen M |title=Opioid contracts and random drug testing for people with chronic pain - think twice |journal=J Law Med Ethics |volume=37 |issue=4 |pages=841–5 |year=2009 |pmid=20122120 |doi=10.1111/j.1748-720X.2009.00455.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&amp;sid=nlm:pubmed&amp;issn=1073-1105&amp;date=2009&amp;volume=37&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=841}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CollenArticle6"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Collen M |title=Analysis of controlled substance agreements from private practice physicians |journal=J Pain Palliat Care Pharmacother |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=357–64 |date=December 2009 |pmid=19947834 |doi=10.3109/15360280903324127 |url=http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/15360280903324127}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CollenArticle7"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Collen M |title=FDA’s Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies Program – Proceed with Extreme Caution |journal=Practical Pain Management |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=50–1 |year=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as producing the patient brochure, “So You’ve Got Chronic Pain…What’s Next?” which was edited by Steven Feinberg, MD.[http://pain-topics.org/patient_resources/index2.php#general1]

'''Pantsing''', also known as '''depantsing''', ''' flagging''', or '''debagging''', is the pulling down of a person's trousers or underwear, usually against their wishes, and typically as a [[practical joke]] or a form of [[bullying]], but in other instances as a [[sexual fetish]]. The most common method is to sneak up behind the intended victim, grab the trousers at the waist, and apply a quick downward tug before the victim is aware of the assailant's presence.

Pantsing is a common type of prank or bullying in school gym classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oAFlDy4-3pkC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=depantsing&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0#v=onepage&amp;q=depantsing&amp;f=false |last=Roberts |first=Walter B. |title=Bullying from Both Sides: Strategic Interventions for Working With Bullies &amp; Victims |publisher=Corwin Press |date=2005 |pages=84–85 |isbn=1-4129-2580-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=JUyqzGlx0gAC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;dq=depantsing&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0#v=onepage&amp;q=depantsing&amp;f=false |last=Voors |first=William |title=The Parent's Book About Bullying: Changing the Course of Your Child's Life |publisher=Hazelden |date=2000 |page=6 |ISBN=978-1-56838-517-4 |access-date=25 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its most extreme form includes running the trousers up the school flagpole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=uoXKtfx4weoC&amp;pg=PA120&amp;dq=depantsing&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0#v=onepage&amp;q=depantsing&amp;f=false |last1=Cunningham |first1=Patricia |last2=Lab |first2=Susan |title=Dress and Popular Culture |publisher=Popular Press |date=1991 |page=120 |ISBN=978-0-87972-507-5 |access-date=25 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some U.S. colleges before [[World War II]] were the scenes of large-scale "depantsing" scraps between freshman and sophomore males, often involving more than 2,000 participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://digitalnewspapers.libraries.psu.edu/Default/Skins/BasicArch/Client.asp?Skin=BasicArch&amp;&amp;Appname=2%2525252525252526amp%252525252525253Benter%252525252525253Dtrue%2525252525252526amp%252525252525253BBaseHref%252525252525253DDCG%252525252525252F1950%252525252525252F09%252525252525252F13%2525252525252526amp%252525252525253BEntityId%252525252525253DAr00100 |title=Customs Were Rugged Then |work=[[The Daily Collegian (Penn State)|The Daily Collegian]] |date=13 September 1950 |volume=51 |issue=2 |page=1 |access-date=25 August 2009 |via=DigitalNewspaper.Libraries.PSU.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also an initiation rite in fraternities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=4htx62wIXIgC&amp;pg=PT177&amp;dq=depantsing&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0#v=onepage&amp;q=depantsing&amp;f=false] |last1=Hodapp |first1=Christopher |last2=Von Kannon |first2=Alice |title=Conspiracy Theories &amp; Secret Societies for Dummies |publisher=Wiley |date=2008 |page=159 |ISBN=978-0-470-18408-0 |access-date=25 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and seminaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=MUYn5ydZ_HwC&amp;pg=PA164&amp;dq=depantsing&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0#v=onepage&amp;q=depantsing&amp;f=false |last=Jordan |first=Mark D. |title=The Silence of Sodom: Homosexuality in Modern Catholicism |publisher=University of Chicago Press |date=2002 |page=164 |ISBN=978-0-226-41043-2 |access-date=25 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was cited in 1971 by [[Gail Sheehy]] as a form of [[assault]] against grade school girls, which did not commonly get reported, although it might include improper touching and [[indecent exposure]] by the perpetrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=B-MCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA28&amp;dq=depantsing&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0#v=onepage&amp;q=pantsing&amp;f=false |last=Sheehy |first=Gail |title=Nice girls don't get into trouble |work=[[New York Magazine]] |date=15 February 1971 |page=28 |access-date=25 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States legal system has prosecuted it as a form of [[sexual harassment]] of children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=-ym-Zjn9-zQC&amp;pg=PA137&amp;dq=depantsing&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0#v=onepage&amp;q=depantsing&amp;f=false |last=Martinson |first=Floyd Mansfield |title=The Sexual Life of Children |publisher=Bergin &amp; Garvey |date=1994 |page=136 |ISBN=978-0-89789-376-3 |access-date=25 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alternative names ==
In Britain, especially historically at [[Oxford]] and [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] Universities in [[England]], the term is known as ''debagging'' (derived from [[Oxford bags]], a loose-fitting baggy form of trousers).

A corresponding term in [[Australia]] (aside from ''pantsing'') is ''dakking'', ''dacking'', or ''daxing'', which originated from [[Simpsons of Piccadilly|DAKS Simpson]], a clothing brand that became a [[Generic brand|generic term]] for pants and underwear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oup.com.au/dictionaries/wotm/dak |publisher=Oxford University Press |title=Word of the Month: The Making of Australian English – Dak |work=OUP.com |date=2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101229091521/http://www.oup.com.au/dictionaries/wotm/dak |archive-date=29 December 2010 |dead-url=yes |access-date=22 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McClure |first=Geoff |url= http://www.theage.com.au/news/sport/campo-point-of-view-gets-a-makeover/2006/02/15/1139890806854.html |title=Campo 'point' of view gets a makeover |work=[[The Age]] |date=16 February 2006 |access-date=25 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''double-dacking'' is used when both the pants and underwear are pulled down. In [[Scotland]] the process is often known as ''breeking'' or ''breekexxing'' from the word ''breeks'' meaning 'trousers'. In [[New Zealand]] the act is known as giving someone a ''down-trou'' or ''drou'' (though this can have [[Glossary of cue sports terms#down-trou|a more specific meaning]], relating to loser-shaming in [[Pool (cue sports)|pool]] playing and other competitive games); in Ireland, it is ''jocking'', ''zoonking'' or ''ka-blinking''; in the north of England ''kegging'' (or ''quegging'').{{citation needed|date=November 2017|reason=All these need citations; some of these do not seem plausible, e.g. "breekexxing" isn't normal English orthography.}}

An alternative term is ''sharking'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Paul |last=Higgins |title=Fourth charge put to Lisburn teen accused of sexual assault by 'sharking' |work=[[Belfast Telegraph]] |date=2 October 2015 |url= https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/fourth-charge-put-to-lisburn-teen-accused-of-sexual-assault-by-sharking-31576647.html |access-date=23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which usually implies a [[sexual assault]] on a stranger rather than a prank or bullying between peers, and is sometimes applied more broadly to the pulling down of blouses and other top clothing.

==Bullying==
Pantsing can be used as a form of [[bullying]] and is technically the crime of [[assault|simple assault]]. The practice has been viewed as a form of ritual emasculation. In 2007, British [[Secretary of State for Education and Skills]] [[Alan Johnson]], in a speech to the [[National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers]], criticized such bullying and criticized [[YouTube]] for hosting a movie (since removed) of a teacher being pantsed, saying that such bullying "is causing some [teachers] to consider leaving the profession because of the [[defamation]] and [[humiliation]] they are forced to suffer" and that "Without the online approval which appeals to the innate insecurities of the bully, such sinister activities would have much less attraction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://watfordobserver.co.uk./news/localnews/display.var.1324861.0.youtube_condemned_by_minister.php|title=Youtube condemned by minister|date=12 April 2007|work=The Watford Observer|publisher=Newsquest Media Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://people.broadcastnewsroom.com/articles/viewarticle.jsp?id=126198|title=British education minister warns malicious online videos hurting teachers|date=10 April 2007|work=Broadcast Newsroom|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/education/article2445862.ece |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120731155612/http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/education/article2445862.ece |dead-url=yes |archive-date=31 July 2012 |title=Teachers are devastated by pupils' net effects |date=13 April 2007 |work=Belfast Telegraph |publisher=Independent News &amp; Media }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Juanita Ross Epp is highly critical of teachers who regard pupils pantsing one another as normal behavior, saying that pantsing makes pupils feel intimidated and uncomfortable and that "normal is not the same as right".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Systematic Violence: How Schools Hurt Children|editor=Juanita Ross Epp and Ailsa M. Watkinson|author=Juanita Ross Epp|chapter=Schools, Complicity, and Sources of Violence|page=17|year=1996|publisher=Routledge|ISBN=0-7507-0582-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Focus populations==
Pantsing occurs most often in school. Girls may collude with dominant boys in targeting weaker boys, and may also single out certain boys that do not share attributes with the dominant male group without the help or instigation of boys.&lt;ref name=Duncan&gt;{{cite book|title=Sexual Bullying: Gender Conflict and Pupil Culture in Secondary Schools|author=Neil Duncan|pages=21&amp;ndash;32|year=1999|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-19113-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Renaissance Pleasure Faire of Southern California''' (RPFS) is the first modern [[Renaissance fair]]e to occur in America. It opened in the spring of 1963 and has been an annual event since then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Richard J. |last= Sneed |title= The Faire: Photographs and History of the Renaissance Pleasure Faire from 1963 onwards |publisher= [[The Good Book Press]] |location= Santa Cruz, CA |year= 1987 |oclc= 26491008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Presently owned by Renaissance Entertainment Productions (REP), it is a commercial [[Historical reenactment|reenactment]] of a 1580s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.renfaire.com/RPFI/index.html | title = REC California Faire Specifics |website= renfaire.com | accessdate = 2008-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; market faire at [[Deptford|Port Deptford]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.renfair.com/socal/thefaire/entertainment.asp | title = Entertainment 2013 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130517233551/http://www.renfair.com/socal/thefaire/entertainment.asp |archivedate= 2013-05-17 |website= renfair.com | accessdate = 2013-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; a waterfront town in [[Elizabethan England]]. The Faire is generally open from the first weekend of April through the weekend before Memorial Day.

==History==

Created by Ron Patterson and Phyllis Patterson, the radio station [[KPFK]], &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmAs_DjQNP0 | title = Fairest Of the Faire}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the nonprofit organization Living History Center (LHC),&lt;ref name= "History"/&gt; the first Renaissance Pleasure Faire of [[Southern California]] (RPFS) was first staged at [[Agoura Hills]] in the spring of 1963.  The first Renaissance Pleasure Faire of [[Northern California]] (RPFN) occurred in the fall of 1967. 
 
In 1989, RPFS was moved to the Glen Helen Regional Park in [[Devore, California]]; then to its present location, the [[Santa Fe Dam Recreation Area]] in [[Irwindale, California]].  In 1999, RPFN was moved to the Nut Tree in [[Vacaville, California]] and later was relocated again to [[Casa de Fruta]] in the Hollister/Gilroy area south of [[San Jose, California|San Jose]]. 

In 1993 RPFS was purchased by Renaissance Entertainment Corp (REC), a for-profit corporation; and later by its current owners, Renaissance Entertainment Productions (REP) (also a for-profit corporation), under whom the Faire has become more family-oriented.&lt;ref name= "History"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.renfaire.com/RPFI/history.html | title = RPFI California Faire History | accessdate = 2008-05-10 |website= renfaire.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://media.www.elpaisanonewspaper.com/media/storage/paper1088/news/2007/05/16/Lifestyles/Renaissance.Pleasure.Faire.Is.For.Young.And.Old-2904409.shtml | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081202135646/http://media.www.elpaisanonewspaper.com/media/storage/paper1088/news/2007/05/16/Lifestyles/Renaissance.Pleasure.Faire.Is.For.Young.And.Old-2904409.shtml | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2008-12-02 | title = Renaissance Pleasure Faire is for young and old | newspaper = El Paisano | location = Whittier, CA | publisher = [[Rio Hondo College]] | first = E. | last = Talavera | date = 2007-05-16 | accessdate = 2008-05-10 | department = Lifestyles | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attire==
The costumes worn by RPFS's actors are styled after those of the period of [[Elizabeth I]] (1558-1603) and must pass a rigorous approval process ensuring their authenticity. There are five general classes of attire: [[Yeoman]], Merchant, Gentry, [[Nobility]] and Military. Other cultures represented include Scots, Italians, Germans, Spaniards, and various Arabian cultures. There are also performance groups such as [[peddler|mongers]], [[Puritan]]s, [[adventurer]]s and [[inventor]]s, which are organized into [[guild]]s.  Visitors, commonly known as patrons, are encouraged to wear Renaissance-inspired costumes, but are not required to adhere to the Elizabethan period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/ci_8741170 | title = Come play at the Faire | first = Michelle J. | last = Mills | date = 2008-03-29 | accessdate = 2008-05-10 | newspaper = [[Pasadena Star-News]] |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080624175010/http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/ci_8741170 |archivedate= 2008-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Rocket Festival 06 Lizard flags.jpg|thumb|Lizard and Flags Rocket 2006]]
The Rocket Festival was a three-day festival of [[music]], [[circus]], [[performance art]] and [[sculpture]] set in [[Andalucia]] in southern [[Spain]] that was held in May 2005, 2006 and 2008.

The festival evolved from the [[free festival]] movement in the UK and inspired by events such as [[Glastonbury Festival]]  and [[Shambala festival|Shambala Festival]].

The organisers have a long history in the UK festival and free party scene from [[Stonehenge]] to [[Glastonbury Festival|Glastonbury]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/bristol/content/articles/2008/05/16/spain_festival_feature.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; The Rocket was conceived as a melting-pot of this alternative festival culture with the Spanish [[festival|fiesta]] spirit set in a rural location near Alhama de Granada, Andalucia.

==Rocket festivals==
* 29/04/2005 - 31/04/2005 in a rugged valley in the [[Sierra de Camorolos]] near [[Antequera]], 50&amp;nbsp;km north of [[Málaga]] featuring [[Amparanoia]] and The [[Freestylers]]

The '''''Sampson'' incident''' occurred in July 1793 when the [[United States|American]] merchant ship ''Sampson'' was seized by [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] [[privateer]]s in the [[West Indies]]. Following a week of capture, the American prisoners revolted against the British and retook control of their ship.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Maclay, pg. 301-303&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incident==
The ''Sampson'' was a [[ship]] rigged vessel under the command of [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] [[Joshua Barney]], a famous [[United States Navy]] officer who served in the [[American Revolutionary War]] and the [[War of 1812]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.history.navy.mil/bios/barney_jos.htm&lt;/ref&gt; On July 12 of 1793, the ''Sampson'' was trading in the [[Caribbean Sea]] when three British privateers surrounded her. The British put a boarding party on the American ship and they took several prisoners, leaving only the ship's carpenter, boatswain, and the cook on board. Captain Barney was taken to one of the privateers while the British searched the ship, stealing valuable property in the process. A few iron chests were found on the ''Sampson'' and it contained about [[US$|$]]18,000. The British thought the chests were suspicious so they told Captain Barney that they would release him if he gave up the money. Barney refused to tolerate the robbery so he was sent back to the ''Sampson'' as a prisoner under guard by eleven armed sailors. They were then to follow the British into the port of [[New Providence]]. Later that day, Barney was capable of communicating with the remaining three men on the ''Sampson'' who told him that they had hidden weapons and would retake the ship upon orders. Barney was not ready yet though but after a week of listening to the insulting British privateersmen, the Americans decided to act. Captain Barney had concealed a [[blunderbuss]] and a broadside sword in his clothing and the three others managed to hide a [[musket]] and a [[bayonet]] each in the berths. So at noon on July 20 the Americans executed their plan. That day was rainy and squally which meant the prize crew was busy navigating while the three British officers were dining on the quarter deck near the main mast.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Barney picked up his sword, cocked the blunderbuss, and with the boatswain and the carpenter he approached the officers. One of them immediately stood up and tried to wrestle the weapon out of Barney's had but the gun went off and struck the Englishman in his right arm. A second officer then went for Barney but he quickly forced him back with his sword and wounded the man in the head. The rest of the prize crew then went below for their weapons but before they reemerged on deck the boatswain and the carpenter had disarmed them. The Americans were now in control of the ship and the Britons vowed to do whatever Barney ordered. One by one the men were allowed on deck and their arms were surrendered and thrown over the side. ''Sampson''{{'}}s crew then set sail for [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]] where they arrived several days later. The situation on the ship was very tense, Barney refused to sleep except during the day, in an armchair, with his sword and [[pistol]]s close by. Barney was arrested for [[piracy]] in the West Indies by the British on January 2, 1794 by the [[frigate]] [[HMS Penelope|HMS ''Penelope'']]. After spending some time as a prisoner Barney was released and later the British attempted to assassinate him in [[Port Royal]], [[Jamaica]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9780">'''Scams in intellectual property''' or '''invention scams''' are a type of [[scam]] in which either [[inventor]]s are lured to pay money for development of their idea but the development does not occur, or [[investors]] pay money for a non existing product or for an invention never to be developed.

[[Intellectual property]] (IP) is a very complex area and covers a vast range of diverse subjects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patent.gov.uk/protect/protect-advice.htm UK Patent Office advice]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, there are opportunities for unscrupulous individuals and organizations to take advantage of those wishing to secure protection for their IP.

==Registration services==
'''Registration services''' are organizations or individuals that contact IP applicants or owners and request payment for an apparently official registration of their IP.

Many applicants for and owners of [[patent]]s, [[trademark]]s and [[industrial design rights]] receive letters from such registration services and different IP offices and organizations around the world regularly issue warnings in connection with the offered services.

The registration services target applicants directly because patent, trademark and design applications are published a set time after filing or upon grant along with freely available information about a name and address for the applicant. Registration services use this information to send requests for payment to applicants shortly after publication.  The documents are confusing as they appear to be from official governmental agencies and to be legitimate invoices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/new-years-solicitations-creative-marketing-or-deceptive-advertising|title=New Years Solicitations - Creative Marketing or Deceptive Advertising? |first=Kurt|last=Anderson |work= Giordano, Halleran &amp; Ciesla, P.C.|year=2012 |accessdate=June 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A scam increasing in frequency, as of October 2011, is an email originating from a domain name registrar or IT consulting company based in China that purports to notify a trademark holder that another entity is seeking to register the client’s trademark or business name as a domain name in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, or Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Be Aware of Trademark and Patent Scams |url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/be-aware-trademark-and-patent-scams |publisher=Sterne, Kessler, Goldstein &amp; Fox P.L.L.C. |work=The National Law Review |date=2011-10-15 |accessdate=2012-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The email gives the brand owner a short period in time in which to secure the domain name for their own.  These notifications are essentially solicitations.  Generally, in the event there really is a third-party who is seeking to register your brand name for nefarious purposes, there are channels available for addressing such uses if and when they materialize.

==Domain slamming==
{{main|Domain slamming}}

'''Domain slamming''' is a form of [[scam]] in which an [[internet service provider]] (ISP) or [[domain name registrar]] attempts to trick customers of different companies into switching from their existing ISP/registrar to the scamming ISP/registrar, under the pretense that the customer is simply renewing their subscription to their old ISP/registrar.

==Invention promotion firm scams==
{{Main|Invention promotion firm#US legal protections for inventors}}
An '''inventor promotion scam''' or '''invention promotion scam''' is a scam where inventors are lured to pay money for development of their invention, or promotion of it, without the development or promotion actually occurring.

Some [[invention promotion firm]]s have been found to engage in improper and deceptive practices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftc.gov/opa/1997/07/mouse.shtm FTC/STATE "PROJECT MOUSETRAP" SNARES INVENTION PROMOTION INDUSTRY, US Federal Trade Commission, Press Release July 1997] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111023235640/http://www.ftc.gov/opa/1997/07/mouse.shtm |date=2011-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Signs of an unscrupulous invention promotion firm include:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/alerts/invnalrt.shtm Consumer Alert:  Spotting Sweet-Sounding Promises of Fraudulent Invention Promotion Firms]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/products/pro21.shtm FTC Facts for Consumers:  Invention Promotion Firms]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Exaggerated claims about the market potential of the invention
*Refusal to offer advice in writing, or having all correspondence confined to promotional material and scheduling phone calls.
*Request for money immediately and upfront
*Money back guarantees - Reputable professionals charge a fee for service and are compensated for their work and, therefore, do not offer money back guarantees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipwatchdog.com/inventing/avoiding-invention-scams/ Invention Submission Companies]&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying Group I|UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying match]] involving the national [[association football]] teams of [[Serbia national football team|Serbia]] and [[Albania national football team|Albania]] took place on 14 October 2014 at [[Partizan Stadium]], in [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]]. The match was abandoned after several on and off the field incidents. Serbian fans had chanted "Ubij, ubij, [[Šiptar]]a" (Kill the Albanians),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.shqiperia.com/Nga-ndeshja-Serbi-Shqiperi-fitoi-UEFA.27109/|title=Nga ndeshja Serbi-Shqipëri fitoi UEFA|trans-title=UEFA won from the Serbia-Albania match|publisher=Shqiperia.com Shekulli|date=4 November 2014|access-date=6 June 2017|language=Albanian|quote=Në vend që të përqëndroheshin tek thirrjet raciste të 30 mijë njerëzve që bërtisnin "vrisni shqiptarët", i thanë publikut se një flamur hodhi në erë gjithë takimin.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and threw [[flare]]s and other objects on the pitch. At that point a [[quadcopter|drone quadcopter]] carrying an Albanian nationalist banner with an image of [[Greater Albania]] appeared on the pitch.&lt;ref name="serbia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espnfc.us/european-championship-qualifying/story/2088456/qualifier-in-serbia-abandoned-because-of-drone-carrying-albanian-flag |title=Qualifier in Serbia abandoned because of drone carrying Albanian flag |publisher=ESPNFC.com |date=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian Albania drone"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/oct/14/serbia-albania-euro-2016-flag-halted |title=Serbia v Albania abandoned after players and fans brawl on pitch |first1=Nick |last1=Ames |first2=Saša |last2=Ibrulj |newspaper=[[The Guardian (UK)|The Guardian]] |date=14 October 2014 |accessdate=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During an interruption of play, Albanian players rushed towards a Serbian player, [[Stefan Mitrović (footballer)|Stefan Mitrović]], who had brought down the banner from the drone attempting to remove it. Conflict arose when [[Bekim Balaj]] ran over and took the banner. This triggered a pitch invasion by Serbian fans and security stewards, who proceeded to attack some of the Albanian players, four of whom sustained minor injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/euro-2016/11163468/Albania-players-struck-by-objects-from-crowd-and-physically-attacked-by-stewards-in-Serbia.html|title=Four Albania players were said to be injured after Euro 2016 qualifier was abandoned following mass brawl}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to attacks by Serbian fans, the Albanian side claimed that their players were also attacked by stewards and riot police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/international-soccer/kill-the-albanians-albanian-fa-claim-players-were-assaulted-and-abused-during-violent-clashes-30669357.html|title=Albania claim their players were assaulted by fans, stewards and police in Belgrade at the now-infamous Euro 2016 qualifier against Serbia which was abandoned after the violent scenes}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was denied and a counter-claim of provocation was made by Serbian officials.&lt;ref name="Sports Yahoo"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Matic|first1=Jovan|title=Serbia condemns Albanian flag drone stunt|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/serbia-albania-match-abandoned-over-drone-chaos-092749135--sow.html|accessdate=26 October 2014|publisher=Sports Yahoo|date=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 October 2014, [[UEFA]] awarded Serbia a [[walkover]] against Albania, with Serbia deemed to have won the match 3–0, on the grounds that Albania had been at fault for refusing to resume the match.  Serbia was, however, given a three-point deduction, and ordered to play its next two homes games [[Behind closed doors (football)|behind closed doors]]. In addition both teams were fined €100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/news/newsid=2172207.html | title=Disciplinary decision on Serbia-Albania match | publisher=UEFA.com | date=24 October 2014 | accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was appealed by both Serbia and Albania,&lt;ref name="Business Insider2"&gt;{{cite news|last1=AFP|title=Albania to appeal UEFA punishment over Serbia|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/afp-albania-to-appeal-uefa-punishment-over-serbia-fracas-2014-10|accessdate=26 October 2014|publisher=Business Insider|date=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goal.com2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/755/europe/2014/10/24/5448671/serbia-to-appeal-uefa-decision|title=Serbia to appeal UEFA decision|publisher=Goal.com|date=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/small&gt; but the decision was upheld by UEFA.&lt;ref name="UEFAupheld"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/news/newsid=2190630.html|title=Decisions upheld for Serbia-Albania match|publisher=UEFA.com|date=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both associations then filed further appeals to the Court of Arbitration for Sport,&lt;ref name="CASappeal"&gt;{{cite web|title=The football associations of Albania and Serbia file appeals at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS)|url=http://www.tas-cas.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Media_Release_3874_3875__2_.pdf|website=tas-cas.org|publisher=[[Court of Arbitration for Sport]]|accessdate=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 10 July 2015 the Court of Arbitration for Sport rejected the appeal filed by the Serbian FA, but upheld in part the appeal filed by the Albanian FA.  The CAS ruled that the match abandonment was caused by "security lapses of the organizers and acts of violence exerted on the Albanian players by the Serbian fans and at least one security steward", and therefore reversed the result, awarding a 3–0 victory to Albania. The points deduction to Serbia, fines, and order to play Serbia home games without a crowd were left intact.&lt;ref name="CAS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tas-cas.org/en/general-information/news-detail/article/football-the-cas-rejects-the-appeal-filed-by-the-serbian-fa-upholds-in-part-the-appeal-filed-by-the-albanian-fa-the-match-serbia-albania-is-deemed-to-have-been-forfeited-by-serbia-0-3.html |title=FOOTBALL: The CAS rejects the appeal filed by the Serbian FA, upholds in part the appeal filed by the Albanian FA: the match Serbia-Albania is deemed to have been forfeited by Serbia (0-3) |publisher=Tribunal Arbitral du Sport / Court of Arbitration for Sport |date=10 July 2015 |accessdate=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Serbia and Albania were drawn together on 23 February 2014, in [[UEFA Euro 2016]] [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying|qualifying]] [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying Group I|Group I]]. Although [[Armenia national football team|Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijan national football team|Azerbaijan]] were separated in the qualifier to avoid incidents (due to the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]]), Serbia and Albania were not, with UEFA claiming that it was because neither nation had directly fought a war with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UEFA chief on why Serbia and Albania wound up in same group|url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/society.php?yyyy=2014&amp;mm=10&amp;dd=21&amp;nav_id=91968}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two countries have strong political disagreements regarding [[Kosovo]], which culminated during the [[Kosovo War]].&lt;ref name=reuters-14&gt;{{cite news|title=Serbia-Albania match abandoned following drone stunt, brawl|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/10/14/uk-soccer-euro-serbia-brawl-idUKKCN0I32H220141014}}&lt;/ref&gt; UEFA further defended their decision to keep Albania and Serbia in the same group, claiming that because neither association had requested to be kept separate from each other, nor were there any requests filed after the draw, UEFA did not feel the need to separate the teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UEFA defends decision not to keep Serbia and Albania apart after brawl|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/oct/15/uefa-defends-decision-serbia-albania-mass-brawl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Events===
[[File:Stadion_Partizana.jpg|thumb|The game took place at Belgrade's [[Partizan Stadium]]]]
The game between [[Serbia national football team|Serbia]] and [[Albania national football team|Albania]] took place at [[Partizan Stadium]] in Belgrade, Serbia, on 14 October 2014, as part of [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying Group I]]. The [[Football Association of Serbia]], [[Albanian Football Association]], and UEFA had all mutually agreed to ban Albanian fans from attending the game for precautionary reasons, unless they did not carry any kind of Albanian paraphernalia.&lt;ref name=Balkaninsight&gt;{{cite news|last1=Likmeta|first1=Besar|title=Albania Fans Barred from Belgrade Football Match|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/albania-to-play-serbia-in-belgrade-amid-fan-ban|accessdate=23 October 2014|date=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Albanian Football Association, on the day of the game, the Albanian team bus was hit with stones thrown by Serbian fans, and a chunk of concrete was thrown at them while on the field, as well as "coins, lighters and other objects" which were hurled at players during pre-game warm-ups.&lt;ref name="Business Insider1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mema|first1=Briseida|title=Albania says stones, concrete, coins hurled at players|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/afp-albania-says-stones-concrete-coins-hurled-at-players-2014-10|accessdate=23 October 2014|publisher=Business Insider|date=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the game started, Serbian supporters chanted "kill the Albanians",&lt;ref name=Ibrulj1&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ibrulj|first1=Sasa|title=Serbia vs Albania: The inside story of Balkan football's latest defeat to political violence|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/serbia-vs-albania-inside-story-4441062|accessdate=23 October 2014|date=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and during the playing of the national anthems, the [[Himni i Flamurit|Albanian national anthem]] was nearly drowned out by home fans whistling and shouting.&lt;ref name=Mailonline1&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ames|first1=Nick|title=Serbia-Albania brawl impossible to believe|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2793384/the-scale-albania-s-brawl-serbia-impossible-believe.html|accessdate=23 October 2014|date=15 October 2014|ref=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2793384/the-scale-albania-s-brawl-serbia-impossible-believe.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the game's opening moments, Serbian fans burned a [[NATO]] flag.&lt;ref name="Washington Post1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Payne|first1=Marissa|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/early-lead/wp/2014/10/14/drone-toting-albanian-national-flag-causes-riots-that-end-albania-vs-serbia-euro-2016-qualifying-match-early/|title=Drone toting pro-Albanian flag causes riots that end Albania vs. Serbia Euro 2016 qualifier early|accessdate=24 October 2014|work=Washington Post|date=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 15 minutes into the game, the first flare was thrown on the pitch.  Approximately ten minutes later, a [[Greek flag]] was raised by the Serbian fans. Ten minutes before half time, flares were thrown towards [[Ansi Agolli]] as he was about to take a corner kick, and a [[petard]] exploded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ilpiccolo.gelocal.it/trieste/cronaca/2014/10/15/news/drone-in-campo-serbia-albania-sospesa-per-in-rissa-1.10122273 | title=Drone in campo: Serbia-Albania sospesa per rissa | publisher=Il Piccolo | date=15 October 2014 | accessdate=1 November 2014 | language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several objects were thrown at him, and at the assistant referee. The match was briefly suspended, and [[Danko Lazović]] and [[Aleksandar Kolarov]] attempted to ease tension as players briefly retreated from stands. After 40 seconds, the match continued, while the stadium announcer asked fans not to throw objects onto pitch. At around the 40-minute mark, a bottle was thrown at [[Bekim Balaj]], and some Serbian fans tried to invade the pitch, leading to brawls between them and security.&lt;ref name=Gargini1&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gargini|first1=Marco|title=CALCIO&amp;nbsp;– Serbia-Albania, colpa dell'Uefa|url=http://www.toscananews.net/home/calcio-serbia-albania-colpa-dell-uefa/|accessdate=24 October 2014|publisher=Toscana News|date=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Martin_Atkinson.jpg|thumb|left|English referee [[Martin Atkinson]] suspended the match before abandoning it]]
In the 42nd minute of the match, English referee [[Martin Atkinson]] suspended the game again due to Serbian fans launching flares onto the pitch.&lt;ref name=ESPN1&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ames|first1=Nick|title=Reflecting on the chaos of Serbia vs. Albania in Belgrade|url=http://www.espnfc.com/blog/espn-fc-united-blog/68/post/2089836/euro-2016-making-sense-of-the-chaos-between-serbia-albania-in-belgrade|accessdate=22 October 2014|issue=ESPN|publisher=ESPN|date=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the game was suspended, a small remote-controlled [[quadcopter]] drone with a flag suspended from it hovered over the stadium. The flag showed the faces of modern Albania's founding fathers, [[Ismail Qemali]] and [[Isa Boletini]], the word [[Indigenous peoples|Autochthonous]], the [[Albanian Declaration of Independence]] date of 28 November 1912, and a map of [[Greater Albania]].&lt;ref name=Fox1&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fox Staff|title=Drone flyover starts soccer brawl|url=http://q13fox.com/2014/10/15/drone-flyover-starts-soccer-brawl/|accessdate=22 October 2014|publisher=Fox|date=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serbian defender [[Stefan Mitrović (footballer)|Stefan Mitrović]] jumped and pulled the flag down, causing Albanian defenders [[Andi Lila]] and [[Taulant Xhaka]] to run at him in attempt to retrieve it, leading to a brief scuffle between players. [[Bekim Balaj]] finally took the flag from Mitrović, and tried to take it off the field, until a Serbian fan ran onto the pitch and struck him across the back of the head with a plastic stool. Albanian captain [[Lorik Cana]] quickly took the fan to the ground and began punching him, before the situation escalated into a brawl involving players from both teams, Serbian fans, substitutes, pitch stewards, and staff.&lt;ref name=NYT1&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mackey|first1=Robert|title=Soccer Match in Serbia Erupts in Riot Set Off by Drone|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/15/world/europe/soccer-match-in-serbia-erupts-in-riot-set-off-by-drone.html?_r=0|accessdate=23 October 2014|work=The New York Times|date=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serbian hooligans came onto the pitch and began attacking Albanian players with chairs and other objects, prompting the referee to lead the teams off the field. Albanian players were attacked and hit by thrown objects as they ran into the player tunnel, whereas Serbian players received a [[standing ovation]] while they calmly left the pitch. After a 30-minute delay, the game was finally abandoned at 0–0, with Albanian players being physically as well as psychologically affected.&lt;ref name=NYT1/&gt;

Before the Albanian team left the stadium, Serbian police searched the bags of an entire 45 person delegation of supporters from Albania in an attempt to find the remote for the drone, to no avail.&lt;ref name=Dailymail2&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jones|first1=Simon|title=Albania players had their bags searched by Serbian police for remote control of drone... and players 'feared for their lives'|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2793908/albania-players-feared-lives-serbia-supporters-rioted-drone-used-fly-flag-pitch.html|accessdate=23 October 2014|publisher=Dailymail|date=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Economist1"/&gt; Responsibility for the drone was immediately claimed by the Shvercerat, a fan group of the Macedonian club [[FK Shkupi]], a club operated by [[Albanians in Macedonia|Albanians]], although no evidence has surfaced to support their claim.&lt;ref name="The Economist1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=T.

The following match between the two teams, played in [[Elbasan]] on 7 October 2015, the Serbian fans were not allowed to travel to Albania for security reasons; on that same day the Albanian police arrested a man suspected to be the pilot of the drone of the Belgrade match.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/oct/07/albania-serbia-alleged-drone-pilot-arrested]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Serbian side claimed that this was a staged political provocation from the Albanian side, and accused an Albanian VIP attending the match, [[Olsi Rama]], brother of prime minister [[Edi Rama]], of piloting the drone, and searched him for the remote. The accusation was vehemently rejected by Rama himself.&lt;ref name="The Associated Press12"&gt;{{cite news|last1=The Associated Press|title=Serbia accuses Albania of provocation after drone brawl during Euro Championship qualifier|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/soccer/serbia-accuses-albania-provocation-euro-drone-brawl-article-1.1974887|accessdate=26 October 2014|agency=Associated Press|date=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Serbian prime minister's office also stated that Rama was arrested and sent home to Albania, a claim denied by the Albanian government's spokesman. Olsi Rama denied any involvement and said that he had been moved from the VIP box for security reasons and informed the authorities that he held American citizenship before being given a police escort to waiting buses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/oct/15/drone-brother-albania-prime-minister-serbia-football|title=This page has been removed - News - The Guardian|work=the Guardian|accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, [[Igli Tare]], former Albanian captain and current [[SS Lazio]] sports director, declared that he was with Olsi Rama, and Rama was merely carrying a camera.&lt;ref name=BalkanWeb&gt;{{cite news|last1=BalkanWeb|title=Igli Tare: Isha me Olsi Ramën në stadium, flamuri në fushë nuk ishte ideja e tij|url=http://www.balkanweb.com/kryesore/1/igli-tare-isha-me-olsi-ramen-ne-stadium-flamuri-ne-fushe-nuk-ishte-ideja-e-tij-216782.html|accessdate=26 October 2014|publisher=BalkanWeb|date=15 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017172751/http://www.balkanweb.com/kryesore/1/igli-tare-isha-me-olsi-ramen-ne-stadium-flamuri-ne-fushe-nuk-ishte-ideja-e-tij-216782.html|archivedate=17 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, [[UEFA]] President [[Michel Platini]] said he was "deeply saddened" by what had happened, adding: "Football is supposed to bring people together and our game should not be mixed with politics of any kind. The scenes in Belgrade last night were inexcusable." [[FIFA]] President [[Sepp Blatter]] said: "Football should never be used for political messages. I strongly condemn what happened in Belgrade last night."&lt;ref name=AFP3&gt;{{cite news|last1=AFP|title=Platini calls Serbia-Albania clash 'inexcusable'|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/platini-calls-serbia-albania-football-clash-inexcusable-115926460--sow.html|accessdate=26 October 2014|agency=AFP|date=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Serbian Foreign Minister, [[Ivica Dačić]], has said that the flag incident was a "political provocation", and "The main question for me is how will the [[European Union]] and UEFA react, because if someone from Serbia had unveiled a flag of [[Greater Serbia]] in Tirana or Pristina it would already be on the agenda of the U.N. Security Council".&lt;ref name=reuters-14/&gt; On 16 October, Serbian Interior Minister [[Nebojša Stefanović]] said that the police were examining the drone to determine its commander and where it was purchased. Serbian authorities later claimed that Albania was "not mature enough" to join the [[European Union]] because "statements by leaders of the Albanian government demonstrate that they knew such a provocation was being prepared".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/10/16/uk-serbia-albania-soccer-idUKKCN0I516K20141016|title=After football row, Serbia says Albania not mature enough for Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt; This prompted the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Albania)|Albanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] to summon the Serbian envoy and cast further doubt on a visit by Albania's Prime Minister [[Edi Rama]] to Belgrade on 22 October, the first of its kind in almost 70 years. Eventually the visit itself was postponed to 10 November 2014, but Rama is not expected to see the President of Serbia, [[Tomislav Nikolić]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shqiptarja.com/politike/2732/vizita-n--beograd-rama-s--39-takon-presidentin-serb-tomislav-nikoli--247429.html|title=Shqiptarja.com - Vizita në Beograd, Rama s'takon presidentin serb Tomislav Nikoliç|work=Shqiptarja.com|accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Serbian Prime Minister [[Aleksandar Vučić]] said that he had warned EU representatives five times ahead of the game of a possible provocation by the Albanian officials at the game, noting that some of the officials wore scarves of the [[Kosovo Liberation Army]], saying "it was clear that they had come with an unambiguous intention to provoke the hosts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=PM: Gravest political provocation, possibly because of Putin|url=http://www.tanjug.rs/news/149229/pm--gravest-political-provocation--possibly-because-of-putin.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141025081541/http://www.tanjug.rs/news/149229/pm--gravest-political-provocation--possibly-because-of-putin.htm|archivedate=2014-10-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edi Rama]], prime minister of Albania, in response declared that "A normal Serbia might be possible only if the Real Serbia will understand that Greater Albania is their nightmare, not our project". In an interview he also added that "the sooner Serbia formally recognizes that Kosovo will never again be its part, the better for Serbia and the region", thus inviting Serbia to recognize Kosovo.&lt;ref name="B92-01"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tanjug|title=Albanian PM wants Serbia "to recognize Kosovo"|url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/comments.php?nav_id=91994|accessdate=26 October 2014|publisher=B92|date=23 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141026043348/http://www.b92.net/eng/news/comments.php?nav_id=91994|archivedate=26 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incidents as a result of the game==
Incidents followed the game outside of Belgrade, not only in Serbia, but also in other countries:

===In Serbia===
In Serbia, after the match, several bakeries and snack bars owned by ethnic Albanians were set on fire in [[Sombor]] and [[Stara Pazova]], and a bomb was used in one case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw.de/nationalism-gaining-strength-in-serbia-albania/a-18009003 Nationalism gaining Strength in Serbia and Albania].DW&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Albanians in Montenegro]] celebrated in [[Ulcinj]], [[Plav, Montenegro|Plav]] and [[Tuzi]]. Incidents of brawls among Montenegrin Albanians near [[Podgorica]] were recorded and four students had checked in the hospital as a result of bruises because of fights among them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://botasot.info/shqiperia/334641/ndeshja-serbi-shqiperi-perleshje-mes-studenteve-ne-mal-te-zi/|title=Ndeshja Serbi-Shqipëri, përleshje mes studentëve në Mal të Zi|work=Bota Sot|accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within Albania, as soon as the match and the subsequent events in the stadium were over, a group of 100 Albanian nationalists carrying flags and nationalist banners attacked local ethnic Greeks, attacked houses, smashed car windows in the Greek-inhabited village of [[Derviçan]], south of [[Gjirokastër]]. At the same time the same group launched profanities against [[Greeks in Albania|local ethnic Greeks]] and slogans against Serbia and Greece. Their activity was stopped after police intervention.&lt;ref name=balkaneu&gt;[http://www.balkaneu.com/greek-ambassador-denounced-incident-place-minority-area-albania/ Greek ambassador denounced an incident taken place in a minority area in Albania] Independent Balkan News Agency.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Incidents in Serbia and abroad after stadium provocation|url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/crimes.php?yyyy=2014&amp;mm=10&amp;dd=16&amp;nav_id=91921|publisher=b92|accessdate=21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident triggered diplomatic intervention from Greece with the Greek foreign ministry sending a [[démarche]] to the foreign ministry of Albania and demanded the trial of those responsible for the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.protothema.gr/greek-demarche-to-albania-over-terrorism-of-greek-village|title=Greek Demarche to Albania over Terrorism of Greek Village|publisher=Proto Thema}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Albanian foreign minister stated that "quick and efficient reaction of the state police, identified the responsible people".&lt;ref name=balkaneu/&gt;

==Ruling==

===UEFA ruling===
The day after the match, UEFA opened disciplinary proceedings against the football associations of both [[Football Association of Serbia|Serbia]] and [[Albanian Football Association|Albania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/news/newsid=2166339.html|title=Proceedings opened against Serbia and Albania|publisher=UEFA.com|date=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serbia were charged for the setting off/throwing of fireworks and missiles (Article 16 (2b &amp; c) UEFA Disciplinary Regulations), crowd disturbance (Art. 16(2h) DR), field invasion by supporters (Art. 16(2a) DR), insufficient organisation (Art. 16(1) DR) and use of a laser pointer (Art. 16(2d) DR). Albania were charged for refusing to play (Art. 27(1) UEFA Competition Regulations) and the display of an illicit banner (Art. 16(2e) DR).

After the meeting by the UEFA Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body on 23 October 2014, UEFA announced the ruling on the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/news/newsid=2172207.html|title=Disciplinary decision on Serbia-Albania match|publisher=UEFA.com|date=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The match was declared as forfeited and Albania were deemed to have lost the match 3–0. Serbia were deducted three points, and ordered to play their next two home matches behind closed doors. Both associations were also fined €100,000. The decision was appealed by both Serbia and Albania,&lt;ref name="Business Insider2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goal.com2"/&gt;&lt;/small&gt; but the decision was upheld by UEFA.&lt;ref name="UEFAupheld"/&gt;

====Reactions to UEFA ruling====
* Albanian striker Bekim Balaj, who was hit in the head with a stool by a Serbian fan on the pitch, posted a sarcastic comment on his Facebook page to [[Michel Platini]] and UEFA, saying "Sorry Platini for the stool that I almost broke with my head, bravo UEFA".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportekspres.com/balaj-ironizon-platinine-me-fal-per-stolin-qe-desh-e-theva-me-koke-bravo-uefa/|title=Balaj ironizon Platininë: Më fal për stolin që desh e theva me kokë, bravo UEFA!|author=S E|work=SportEkspres.com|accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Albanian President of the Football Federation, [[Armando Duka]], declared: "I am disillusioned because we were claiming a legal verdict from UEFA. I do not understand what precedent this may set when a squad physically beats the opposing players on the pitch. I do not know if there is a greater scandal than this." He declared that Albania would appeal the decision. Cimi Shakohoxha, part of the Albanian Federation, called the decision a travesty. He said "It's a cop out. We are totally committed to banishing racism from football, and this judgment appears to fly in the face of that aim. This is not about the point&amp;nbsp;— it's about fighting racism."&lt;ref name=Payne2&gt;{{cite news|last1=Payne2|first1=Marisa|title=UEFA awards Serbia a win over Albania in abandoned Euro 2016 qualifier, but deducts points for bad behavior|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/early-lead/wp/2014/10/24/uefa-awards-serbia-a-win-over-albania-in-abandoned-euro-2016-qualifier-but-deducts-points-for-bad-behavior/|accessdate=26 October 2014|work=Washington Post|date=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Albanian coach, [[Gianni de Biasi]] declared to the media that the decision was scandalous, whereas Albania's captain [[Lorik Cana]] said that the decision was completely unfair, as the referee never told Albania to go back to the pitch, rather only asked them if they were fit to go back.&lt;ref name=Panorama4&gt;{{cite news|last1=Halilaj|first1=Jetmir|title=Cana: Gjyqtari nuk na urdhëroi për të riluajtur.

* The Albanian prime Minister, Edi Rama, declared that the decision did not render any justice, however he promised that Albania would welcome Serbia in a renewed [[Shkodër]] based [[Loro Boriçi Stadium]], whose capacity would increase to 20,000 spectators and would be ready by 2015.&lt;ref name=Panorama1&gt;{{cite news|last1=Panorama|title=Edi Rama: UEFA nuk dha drejtësi, Serbinë e presim në "Loro Boricin" 20 mijë vendesh|url=http://www.panorama-sport.com/ballina/edi-rama-serbine-e-presim-ne-loro-boricin-20-mije-vendesh/|accessdate=24 October 2014|date=24 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024142436/http://www.panorama-sport.com/ballina/edi-rama-serbine-e-presim-ne-loro-boricin-20-mije-vendesh/|archivedate=24 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Albanian-American Organization, [[Albanian Roots]], called for mass reaction. From petitions, protests, boycotts, letters to government officials, involvement of Human &amp; Civil rights organization, to writing letters to UEFA, FIFA, and Michel Platini.
* More than a dozen protests were held all over the world by Albanians and non-Albanians in reaction to the ruling, claiming that UEFA's 'fair play" policy was not upheld and that political influence was a cause of the decision. In Finland, more than 100 Albanians awaited [[Michel Platini]] in a protest where they associated him as with the 'political mafia'.
* Albanian soccer players from around the world condemned the decision and stated their disappointment with the lack of justice from the disciplinary board.

===CAS ruling===
As neither the Albanian nor the Serbian football associations were satisfied with the UEFA ruling, they both filed further appeals to the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]].&lt;ref name="CASappeal"/&gt; On 10 July 2015 the Court of Arbitration for Sport rejected the appeal filed by the Serbian FA, and upheld in part the appeal filed by the Albanian FA, meaning the match was deemed to have been forfeited by Serbia with 0–3 and Serbia were, in addition, deducted three points.&lt;ref name="CAS"/&gt;

==Effect on Euro 2016 qualification==

The victory and accompanying three points awarded by the CAS to Albania proved decisive as they qualified for the final tournament in second place with 14 points. Albania's qualification came at the expense of [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]], which finished in third with 12 points and failed to qualify after losing a playoff to [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]]. Serbia finished qualification in fourth place with four points. Even if they had been able to keep the victory as initially awarded, Serbia would have failed to qualify.

[[File:FERA, Camps for Unemployed Women, Maine - NARA - 196588.tif|thumb|[[Federal Emergency Relief Administration]] camp for unemployed women in Maine (1934)]]
The '''She-She-She Camps''' were camps for unemployed women that were organized by [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] (ER) in the United States as a counterpart to the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] (CCC) programs designed for unemployed men. ER found that the men-only focus of the CCC  program left out young women who were willing to work in conservation and forestry and to sign up for the six-month programs living away from family and close support. She lobbied for a sister organization to the CCC that would be for young women. Eleanor Roosevelt proposed that this would consist of camps for jobless women and residential worker schools. The She-She-She camps were funded by presidential order in 1933. [[United States Secretary of Labor|Labor Secretary]] and Cabinet Member [[Frances Perkins]] championed one such camp after ER held a [[White House]] Conference for Unemployed Women on April 30, 1934, and subsequently ER's concept of a nationwide jobless women's camp was achieved. While the public largely supported the [[New Deal]] programs and the CCC was a huge success, the women's version barely topped 5,000 women annually by 1936 and overall served 8,500 as a result of ER's support.

== Forestry and conservation ==
[[File:CCC-poster-1935.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Civilian Conservation Corps]] poster (1935)]]
President [[Franklin Roosevelt]] valued the CCC because it was fueled both by his passion for [[rural]] life and the [[philosophy]] of [[William James]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/facts/|title=Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum|work=Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="biography"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/william-james-9352726|title=William James Biography |publisher=biography.com |accessdate=2015-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; James deemed this sort of program the "moral equivalency of war". Although administered by US Army officers, the camps were designed not to be militaristic since the Administration did not want any resemblance to the [[Hitler Youth]] of [[Germany in World War II|Germany]]. These tree armies kept the young male population occupied and engaged with [[conservation (ethic)|conservation]], fighting wildland fires, building dams and creating man-made lakes. Much of the state's parkland was improved even before the National Parks, but Eleanor Roosevelt asked, "What about the women?"

== Camp TERA ==
[[File:Eleanor Roosevelt at SheSheShe Camp for Unemployed Women in Bear Mountain, New York - NARA - 195980.jpg|thumb|left|Eleanor Roosevelt (center) speaks to unemployed women at Camp TERA (Temporary Emergency Relief Assistance) at [[Bear Mountain State Park]] (August 7, 1933)]]
Criteria for participation in the women's camps were different from the CCC. Eleanor Roosevelt fought resistance from the administration, many of whom objected to sending America's unemployed women on what could be described as a government-sponsored vacation in the middle of a depression. ER was troubled by the plight of so many women, many of whom did not show up in the [[Soup kitchen|bread-lines]] but were relegated to living in subway tunnels and "tramping", foraging for subsistence outside urban areas. The number of women seeking jobs grew to two&amp;nbsp;million by 1933. The feminist writer [[Meridel Le Sueur]] wrote that once out of work, women "will go for weeks verging on starvation, crawling in some hole, going through the streets ashamed, sitting in libraries, parks, going for days without speaking to a living soul like some exiled beast".

It took several months but, with promotion and lots of elbow grease, the first camp got off the ground at Bear Mountain's Camp TERA (Temporary Emergency Relief Assistance), later called Camp Jane Addams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://secularhumanist.blogspot.com/2014/09/going-extra-mile-to-visit-jane-addams.html|title=Secular Perspectives|author=Gary Berg-Cross|work=secularhumanist.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marian Tinker]] was selected as its first director. She had gone to High School in [[Manchester, Massachusetts]], before completing her studies at Arnold College in [[New Haven, Connecticut]] and the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]]. As a [[social worker]], she was experienced at working with young women in various organizations like the [[YWCA]] and [[Girl Scouts]], as well as several schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Local Woman Directs Camp|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/13182996/local_woman_directs_camp_the/|accessdate=20 August 2017|publisher=''The Harrisburg Telegraph''|date=June 26, 1933|location=Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|page=11|via = [[Newspapers.com]]}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Camp TERA began on June 10, 1933 with 17 young women from New York. Currently [[Bear Mountain State Park]] in New York, the site had 12 camps for CCC enrollees in 1934. FDR visited camp sp-20&lt;ref name="neilmaher"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://neilmaher.com/documents/PublicNature-BearMt.essay.pdf|date=31 May 2013|title= Public Nature – Scenery, History, and Park Design|editor=Ethan Carr, Shaun Eyring and Richard Guy Wilson |accessdate=2015-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; that year to review the corps. He spent time at the recreation center, mess hall, barracks and camp library, praising the more than 200 enrollees for their hard work. Before leaving, he visited the signature project, a dam across the outlet of the Pine Meadow Valley that created the first of many swimming lakes for tourists, a direct expression of FDR's regard for conservation and forestry.

When ER first visited Camp TERA, she found only 30 girls at the 200-acre camp. Smith had planned for 20 girls to arrive twice a week until the capacity of 200 was met. However, massive red tape and confusion prevailed. ER appreciated the camp, but decided the requirements were too strict. She could not believe there were not enough women willing to accept the job and warned that the numbers had to increase or the idea might be abandoned. This put the State relief administration representative, Walter W. Petit, on the hot seat to explain why 700 women had applied yet only 30 had been selected. Defending the "thorough" investigation needed some doing and while the program extended eligibility to age 40, blaming the "rigorousness of the qualifications for eligibility" did not absolve him of his part in delaying the project. Despite the delays, mail supporting Camp TERA poured in to the White House with offers of more properties for the camps and pleas from individuals to attend. Government officials promised support for more camps if Camp TERA succeeded. There were also questions and media attention about the nature of the camps. Some of the women thought the camp was for them to work at reforestation doing manual labor so the prevailing thought was it would be hard work with little to show for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/yankeeharp/depression_era_living|title=Depression era living - Wind In The Roses|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the dollar per day given the male enrollees holding back $22–25 of the monthly $30 for family back home, the offer of work was enticing to those who did not want to pass up the chance of job and with glowing reports coming back from participants the proponents of She-She-She renewed efforts in the fall of 1933 to expand the program. Going against this was that in the 1930s many Americans objected to the use of public resources to support individuals, especially women. Most had a more traditional view, particularly that the role of the woman was in the home. Others considered the idea of putting women out in the woods to learn dubious skills&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.floridamemory.com/items/show/142517?cid=20&amp;pc=General%20(unprinted)%20Collection|title=Florida Memory  - FERA adult education typing class at Stanton High School - Jacksonville, Florida|author=State Library and Archives of Florida|work=Florida Memory}}&lt;/ref&gt; just plain wrong.

=== Critics ===
[[Pauli Murray]], who would later become a lawyer, writer, black civil rights activist and episcopal priest, arrived at Camp TERA on the advice of her doctor at the end of 1933. Living on the edge of poverty and diagnosed with [[pleurisy]], her time there was cut short after she clashed with the camp's director, Miss Mills. An ambulance driver during [[World War I]] and an authoritarian, Mills attempted to run the camp on semi-military lines. Murray had a copy of ''[[Das Kapital]]'' in her bags and when director Mills found it, she ejected her from the camp. Murray would later become a close friend of ER. That leftist songs were sung at camp sing-alongs became a focus of detractors. It was not surprising that there were leftists in the camps since this was not far removed from the "[[Hoovervilles]]", and the troubadour-style of fellow travellers like singer [[Woody Guthrie]] fueled these sing-alongs. It also was not surprising that in 1936 controversies over communist influences enveloped the camp. In July 1936, the [[American Legion]] of Rockland County accused Camp TERA officials of using Federal funding for communist purposes. The new Director, Bernice Miller, countered the charges, saying that  "the campers were permitted the completest freedom to say and discuss what they wanted, and sing any songs they wanted to". She also was quick to add that most supported the government. As to complaints of the ''[[Internationale]]'' and radical satires being sung, and that controversial material was being read, some, Miller admitted were "of communist and socialist persuasion". Also adding to embarrassment, women from Camp TERA "escaped" and visited a men's CCC camp nearby. A teacher at Camp TERA, Harry Gersh, commented, "It was a most unnatural environment for these women. No one had thought that sexual isolation would be a problem".

After returning home to [[New York City]] from Camp TERA, some of the women joined the radical Workers' Alliance. Spokeswoman for the organization Sarah Rosenberg, a vocal critic of the benefit of the She-She-She camps said, "More than one girl says there is nothing left except suicide or tramping on the roads".

Over 90 camps were created across the U.S. by 1936, and over 8,500 women cycled through before they were closed. Each reflected the different cultures indigenous to their locations and depended heavily upon what was available in terms of local resources and talent. There are audio histories of communities cleaning old facilities and donating beds, clothes, food and other staples for the women. Many [[North Dakota]] Indian women left the reservation for the very first time to attend camp programs. [[Oberlin College]] welcomed stenographers and clerical workers at its Summer School for Office Workers. [[Barnard College]] in New York City hosted classes for unemployed unionized women. Black sharecropper women in the south studied at an agricultural college in [[Arkansas]]. The [[YWCA]] in [[Philadelphia]] provided a space for 40 women to study and live. Unemployed professional women in [[New Jersey]] attended a specially created program. In [[Michigan]], rented houses provided unemployed women instruction in housekeeping skills. In the [[Ozarks]], women attended literacy classes.

No remittance was sent back home unlike the CCC men's allowance. The camps were located where a facility had heat, lighting and sanitary conveniences—typically summer hotels, abandoned CCC camps and vacated schools. They were administered by female camp directors, project supervisors, staff teachers and counselors. The average camp had around 100 women, with a supervisory staff of 10–20 including cooks and a nurse. Each enrollee was assigned fixed hours of work on camp assignments, including working in forest nurseries at some camps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thecorpsnetwork.org/shesheshe-camps-womens-alternative-civilian-conservation-corps|title="SheSheShe" Camps: A Women's Alternative to the Civilian Conservation Corps|work=thecorpsnetwork.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others were making and repairing toys and playground equipment, while some worked at creating visual training aids for public schools. Those with visual disabilities (there were camps for the blind) would make finished bedding or use natural materials to create woven products. Sewing equipment enabled the women to make their own clothing (one popular class was to make dresses from empty cloth feed bags) and no uniforms were required. WPA programs also supplied clothing, and canneries were used as teaching aids and product generation. Layettes and hospital sundries were made for public institutions and other WPA nursing projects. Maintenance of the barracks, housekeeping and kitchen duties  along with instruction in economics and cooking were integral to the residential program which lasted three to four months and was not subject to re-enrollment. The Native American women were paid an additional allotment to find rental housing and travelled with the men who went off the reservation to work. No camps were established exclusively for Native American men, so many travelled as a family group. Blacks were still segregated at this time but in their camps were given the same educational opportunities.

The educational program included English, adult education, domestic science, hygiene, public health, and economics. Games, athletic contests, hikes, music, and drama groups were included in the recreational plans and handicrafts activities were encouraged. Some camps at schools had typing and secretarial classes. The cost per enrollee was estimated at $39 each, plus $5 which went to personal expenses. They worked to cover food costs (taken from the $5), lodging and medical care. The camps were operated on a year-round basis and eligibility for NYA ([[National Youth Administration]]) employment was a requirement. (The NYA took over from the TERA in 1936 in administering [[Federal Emergency Relief Administration|FERA]] ([[Federal Emergency Relief Administration]])).

When the housing and shelter crisis eased in 1937, the NYA decided that the women's program was too costly and shut it down. Most of the women approved had it tough living in the midst of a Depression and found the duties a relief from the meager sustenance in the cities, many embracing the outdoors with a vigor to match that of the young men working in the CCC camps.

The She-She-She camps for women closed October 1, 1937.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times Article, Sept 16, 1937&lt;/ref&gt; The NYA ([[National Youth Administration]], ) then in charge of the program, criticized the objectives and necessity of the camps and decided it was too expensive. As the crisis of hunger and shelter eased, the camp program for women could not be justified and it ended. ER was never happy with either the women's or men's camps. She objected to the military aspect of the CCC from the onset but the success of the CCC and other [[New Deal]] programs left her with other anti-poverty programs and women-centered initiatives to pursue. Her vision was a two-year program for young men and women to be devoted to domestic projects such as conservation, health care, education and settlement houses. At the end of 1933, after Camp TERA was established, she had stated, "There is nothing more exciting than building a new social order."

'''Summer in the City''' (sometimes styled as '''SitC''') is an annual three-day event held in [[London]], dedicated to [[YouTube]] content creators and users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Summer in the City: the UK's biggest YouTube gathering|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/video/2014/aug/18/summer-in-the-city-youtube-video|website=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=When YouTube Stars Go Offline and Meet Fans in Person|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/lifestyle/when-youtube-stars-go-offline-and-meet-fans-in-person-1.2237162|website=CTV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=When YouTube stars go offline and meet up live|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/when-youtube-stars-go-offline-and-meet-up-live-64955|website=The Daily Star}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event began in 2009 as a small gathering in London's parks, and has since grown into a convention-scale event that now takes place annually at [[ExCeL London]]. In 2014, SitC took place in [[Alexandra Palace]] and attracted over 8,000 attendees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rightster Agrees Live Streaming Deal Summer in The City|url=http://www.thedrum.com/news/2014/08/04/rightster-agrees-live-streaming-deal-summer-city-youtube-event|quote=SitC, now in its sixth year, attracts over 8,000 attendees from across the world in a celebration of ‘all things YouTube’.|website=The Drum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, SitC was acquired by [[MCM Expo]] Group as part of their "MCM Central" brand. The first event hosted under the MCM ownership took place 12-14 August 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MCM Is New Owner Of YouTube Festival Summer In The City|url=http://www.mcmbuzz.com/blog/2016/02/24/mcm-are-new-owners-of-youtube-festival-summer-in-the-city/|website=MCMBuzz|accessdate=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===2009 - 2011 (London Parks)===
The first Summer in the City was held in London, as a traditional YouTube gathering. It was organised by vlogger Tom Burns and YouTube musician Dave Bullas, with the support of their friends Liam Dryden And Jazza John. The three-day event was held in the last weekend of August and took place across several of London's [[Royal Parks of London|Royal Parks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/events/10153000373173509/|title=Summer in the City - Facebook|accessdate=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest attendance at any point was reportedly 200 people, a mix of YouTube creators and viewers. 

In its first three years, the event followed the pattern of meeting in parks by day, and moving to a London venue such as [[The Luminaire]] for live music performances in the evening. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/events/10152873019903129/|title=Summer in the City 2010 - Facebook|accessdate=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2012 (The Brewery)===
Following the rapid growth of the event, the decision was made to hold the fourth Summer in the City at a dedicated venue for its duration; SitC 2012 took place at the Brewery in London from 17-19 August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/events/906993039357656/|title=Summer in the City 2012 - Facebook|accessdate=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first year the event would introduce official programming, including workshops and Q&amp;As from creators, as well as an official livestream on the event's YouTube channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Summer in the City 2012 LIVE |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1CXpKzfOKQ |publisher=Summer in the City |accessdate=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of prospective attendees at SitC 2012 exceeded the 1,000-person capacity of the venue, inspiring the need to move away from being a free event and introduce ticketing in following years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=From all of us - Thank You. - Summer in the City |url=http://summerinthecitygathering.tumblr.com/post/29892016424/from-all-of-us-thank-you |publisher=Summer in the City |accessdate=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2013 - 2014 (Alexandra Palace)===
SitC's first official ticketed event and the fifth event overall was held in London's Alexandra Palace, with an increased capacity of 7,000 attendees. Backlash over the announcement that the event would now charge admission before confirming the venue, dates or line-up of featured creators resulted in the cut of early ticket prices to £10 plus VAT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Explaining the Ticketing System - SitC 2013 |url=http://summerinthecitygathering.tumblr.com/post/39395247823/explaining-the-ticketing-system-sitc-2013 |publisher=Summer in the City |accessdate=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event was sold out by early July 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Summer in the City on Twitter |url=https://twitter.com/SummerInTheCity/status/353895907743375362 |publisher=Summer in the City |accessdate=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was held over two days on 17-18 August.

Accompanying 2013's event was a spin-off tour called the '''Summer Warm-Up''', which involved creators from the SitC 2013 line-up touring through some of the UK's major cities, to perform one-off gigs in the build-up to the main event in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Summer Warm Up - Lineup Announcement |url=http://summerinthecitygathering.tumblr.com/post/52561918298/summer-warm-up-lineup-announcement |publisher=Summer in the City |accessdate=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2013 SitC was also the introduction of formal meet &amp; greets, where fans would wait in line to meet popular YouTubers from the lineup. The high demand of creators along with the "first come, first served" model of the meet &amp; greets resulted in the decision to add additional ticketing to the meet &amp; greets in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Saturday Wrap-Up! |url=http://summerinthecitygathering.tumblr.com/post/58538494756/saturday-wrap-up |publisher=Summer in the City |accessdate=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Tickets for SitC 2014 were available as early as October 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Announcing Summer in the City 2014! |url= http://summerinthecitygathering.tumblr.com/post/61768081951/announcing-summer-in-the-city-2014-hello-so-we |publisher=Summer in the City |accessdate=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had sold out by January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Summer in the City on Twitter |url=https://twitter.com/SummerInTheCity/status/423774269516947456 |publisher=Summer in the City |accessdate=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sixth event also saw the return of Friday programming, as the event introduced Friday as '''Creator Day'''; a more limited event of panels and networking specifically targeted towards creators rather than fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=More on the SitC Creator Day! |url=http://summerinthecitygathering.tumblr.com/post/91741818262/more-on-the-sitc-creator-day |publisher=Summer in the City |accessdate=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continuing issues with the demand for SitC's meet &amp; greets in 2014 inspired the development of an online ballot system, that has since been implemented in following events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Re: Meet &amp; Greets |url=http://summerinthecitygathering.tumblr.com/post/94339164247/re-meet-greets |publisher=Summer in the City |accessdate=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2015 - Present (ExCeL London)===
Summer in the City moved to ExCeL for its seventh year which increased its overall capacity to 10,000 attendees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UK’s Biggest YouTube Convention Expands, Moves To ExCeL London|url=http://videoter.com/summer-in-the-city-2015-excel-london/|website=Videoter|accessdate=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the preliminary announcement of the venue and ticket sales in January 2015, a large number of influential creators from talent network Gleam including [[Zoella]], [[Alfie Deyes]] and [[Joe Sugg]] simultaneously announced they would not be attending 2015's event, favouring plans for their own event titled '''Amity Fest'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=YOUTUBERS INCLUDING ZOELLA, TANYA BURR AND ALFIE DEYES REVEAL THEY WON'T BE ATTENDING SUMMER IN THE CITY|url=http://www.sugarscape.com/film-tv/news/a1073791/youtubers-including-zoella-tanya-burr-and-alfie-deyes-reveal-they-wont-be-attending-summer-in-the-city/|website=SugarScape|accessdate=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event maintained a robust lineup of creators, hosting the presentation of several [[YouTube Play Button]] awards to creators who had recently hit milestones of 100,000 or 1 million subscribers on their channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Summer in the City is a hit with fans, even without Zoella|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/33949633/summer-in-the-city-is-a-hit-with-fans-even-without-zoella|website=BBC Newsbeat|accessdate=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016, it was announced that Summer in the City had joined MCM Expo Group, who would be providing resources and support for the original organisational team in the event's eighth year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Summer In The City Has Just Been Acquired By MCM Expo|url=http://www.wetheunicorns.com/news/summer-in-the-city-mcm-expo/|website=We The Unicorns|accessdate=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; SitC 2016 was also the debut of the '''Summer in the City Awards''', an event dedicated to presenting community-nominated awards such as "Best Vlogger" and "YouTuber Book Of The Year" to winning creators on the mainstage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SUMMER IN THE CITY AWARDS 2016 ROUND-UP |url=http://teneightymagazine.com/2016/08/14/summer-in-the-city-awards-2016-round-up/ |publisher=TenEighty |accessdate=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2017 saw the second ceremony of the Summer in the City awards, which featured 2 new awards.

"'''Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out'''" is the second song on [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s breakthrough album ''[[Born to Run]]'', released in 1975.

==Content==
The song tells the story of the formation of the [[E Street Band]]. However, when asked, most Springsteen fans cannot answer the question, "What is a Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out?" The meaning of the phrase is still a mystery. Even Springsteen himself says, laughing, in the ''Born to Run'' documentary ''Wings for Wheels: The Making of Born to Run'': "I still have no idea what it means. But it's important."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-bruce-springsteen-songs-of-all-time-20140116/tenth-avenue-freeze-out-19691231|title=100 Greatest Bruce Springsteen Songs|website=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song's protagonist, "Bad Scooter", is a [[pseudonym]] for Springsteen himself (as indicated by the initials they share). In the third verse, "Big Man joined the band" refers to the now deceased [[Clarence Clemons]], the band's long-time [[saxophone|saxophonist]].

As stated by Springsteen in the ''Wings for Wheels'' documentary, the idea for the composition of the horn intro was [[Steven Van Zandt]]'s. Despite all of this, the single was a chart dud, getting no higher than #83 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. However, it has always had a strong following on [[album-oriented rock]] radio and amongst Springsteen's fan base.

==Live performance history==
[[Image:Belmar10thAvenueFreezeOutStand.jpg|thumb|left|246px|In [[Belmar, New Jersey]] – the town from which the E Street Band took its name – an ice cream stand is named after the song.]]
"Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out" has become a staple of Springsteen's [[E Street Band]] concert tours, with regular appearances from the 1975 and on the [[Born to Run tours]] through the 1984 legs of the [[Born in the U.S.A. Tour]], with one of the latter documented on the later ''[[Live/1975–85]]'', and the 1988 [[Tunnel of Love Express]].  It then returned with a featured regular spot on the 1999–2000 [[Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band Reunion Tour|Reunion Tour]], often used as an introduction of the band. An extended 20-minute version was captured on the subsequent ''[[Bruce Springsteen &amp; The E Street Band: Live in New York City]]'' release, and was frequently played during most of the legs of the 2007–2008 [[Magic Tour (Bruce Springsteen)|Magic Tour]] and during the 2009 [[Working on a Dream Tour]]. It opened the four-song set at Springsteen and the band's high-profile half-time appearance at [[Super Bowl XLIII]], which included Springsteen pointing out that the verse about "the Big Man" joining the band was the important part of the song.

A slower version of this song was played during the [[Born to Run tours]], on December 31, 1975 in Philadelphia.

After Clemons' death, Springsteen used the song as a memorial/tribute to both him and the late Danny Federici on the [[Wrecking Ball Tour]], the first E Street Band tour without Clemons. During the song's third verse of "Big Man joined the band", Springsteen paused the song where Clemons' sax solo would traditionally be performed while a video of Clemons and Federici played on the stage screens. On the High Hopes and River 2016 tours, Springsteen removed the pause from performances of the song, but kept the video tribute.{{Citation needed|date= January 2013}}

Springsteen joined his longtime friend [[Billy Joel]] on stage at [[Madison Square Garden]] on July 18, 2018 to perform the song (along with "[[Born to Run (song)|Born to Run]]") for Joel’s 100th appearance at MSG.

'''''The Captain from Köpenick''''' ({{lang-de|Der Hauptmann von Köpenick|links=no}}) is a [[1931 in film|1931]] German [[comedy film]] directed by [[Richard Oswald]] and produced by [[Gabriel Pascal]]. It is one of several films based on the 1931 play by the same name written by [[Carl Zuckmayer]].&lt;ref&gt;Rentschler p.166&lt;/ref&gt; The story centers on the [[Wilhelm Voigt|Hauptmann von Köpenick]] affair in 1906.

It was shot at the [[Johannisthal Studios]] in [[Berlin]] and [[location filming|on location]] in [[Köpenick]]. The film's sets were designed by the [[art director]] [[Franz Schroedter]].

==Plot==
''Der Hauptmann von Köpenick'' is based on a true story that took place in Germany in 1906. A poor cobbler named [[Wilhelm Voigt]] purchased the second-hand uniform of a Prussian infantry captain. Wearing this, he travelled to the borough of [[Köpenick]] and ordered a troop of guardsmen to place themselves under his command. He then declared the town hall to be under military law, ordering the arrest of the mayor and treasurer and confiscating all the funds in the [[exchequer]]. In this film version it's a considerable sum of 4,000 [[reichsmark]]s. Voigt's orders were obeyed without question and he temporarily got away with the caper, although he was eventually caught.

The '''''Théâtre du Capitole de Toulouse''''' is an [[opera house]] located within the main administration buildings, the [[Capitole de Toulouse|Capitole]], of the city of [[Toulouse]] in south-west [[France]]. It houses an opera company, [[ballet]] company and symphony orchestra, [[Orchestre national du Capitole de Toulouse]]. 

The first performance space, a ''salle du jeu de spectacle'', was created in the building in 1736 by [[Guillaume Cammas]].  Following a period of neglect, the current space was created during the rebuild of 1818.  The theatre suffered fire damage in 1917, but was restored in 1923.  The front of house areas were modernised in 1996.  The current capacity is 1156 seats.

[[Michel Plasson]] was responsible for the artistic direction of the company from 1973. He was followed by [[Jacques Doucet (painter)|Jacques Doucet]] in 1981, by [[Nicolas Joel]] in 1991, and by [[Frédéric Chambert]] in 2009, after Joel's move to the [[Opéra national de Paris]].  Chambert's first season was marked by the use of alternate spaces while the theatre was renovated, and the theatre was re-opened for the beginning of the 2010-11 season.

The opera company is a member of the [[Réunion des Opéras de France]].

{{Campaignbox Early Muslim Expansions}}
{{Campaignbox Islamic invasion of Gaul}}

The '''Umayyad invasion of Gaul''' followed the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania]] spearheaded by the Muslim commander [[Tariq ibn Ziyad]] in 711. During the 8th century, Umayyad armies conquered the region of [[Septimania]], the last remnant of the [[Visigothic Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=o4vrUbMK5eEC&amp;pg=PA1 ''Tricolor and crescent: France and the Islamic world'' by William E. Watson p.1]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Umayyad advance was stopped at the [[Battle of Toulouse (721)|Battle of Toulouse]] in 721, but they sporadically raided Southern Gaul as far as [[Avignon]], [[Lyon]], and [[Autun]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=o4vrUbMK5eEC&amp;pg=PA1 ''Tricolor and crescent: France and the Islamic world'' by William E. Watson p.1]&lt;/ref&gt; After the 732 [[Battle of Tours-Poitiers]], the Franks checked Aquitanian sovereignty, and reasserted their authority over Burgundy, but only later in 759 did they manage to take the Mediterranean region of Septimania, due to Andalusi neglect and local Gothic disaffection.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=o4vrUbMK5eEC&amp;pg=PA1 ''Tricolor and crescent: France and the Islamic world'' by William E. Watson p.1]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ummayad conquest of Septimania==
By 716, under the pressure of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] from the south, the [[Kingdom of the Visigoths]] had been rapidly reduced to the province of [[Septimania]], a region which corresponds approximately to the modern [[Languedoc-Roussillon]]. By 717, the Umayyads under [[al-Hurr ibn Abd al-Rahman al-Thaqafi]] started to cross the eastern Pyrenees into Aquitanian territory and Septimania as a continuation to their Iberian conquest, but the commander failed to advance further.

After being replaced by [[Al-Samh ibn Malik al-Khawlani|al-Samh]], Umayyad forces seized Barcelona and the [[Septimania]]n city of [[Narbonne]] (''Arbouna'' for the Arabs) in 719 despite local resistance. A sizable number of the town defenders and inhabitants were killed in the aftermath by the victorious Umayyad forces. From 720 on, Narbonne became the capital city of Muslim Septimania, and used as a base for [[Ghazi (warrior)|razzia]]s. A mosque was established in Narbonne, inside the church of Sainte-Rustique.

However, the Umayyad tide was temporarily halted in the large-scale [[Battle of Toulouse (721)]], when Emir [[Al-Samh ibn Malik al-Khawlani|al-Samh]] (the "Zama" of Christian chronicles) was killed by [[Odo of Aquitaine]]. In general terms the Gothic Septimania surrendered to the Muslims in favourable conditions for them, allowing the Umayyads to rule the region with the conditioned support of the local population and the Gothic nobles.

In 725, his successor, [[Anbasa ibn Suhaym Al-Kalbi]], besieged the city of [[Carcassonne]], which had to agree to give half of its territory, pay tribute, and make an offensive and defensive alliance with Muslim forces. [[Nimes]] and all the other main Septimanian cities fell too under the sway of the Umayyads. In the 720s the savage fighting, the massacres and destruction particularly affecting the Ebro valley and Septimania unleashed a flow of refugees who mainly found shelter in southern Aquitaine across the Pyrenees, and [[Provence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Collins, Roger| year = 1989 | title = The Arab Conquest of Spain 710-797 | publisher = Blackwell |location = Oxford, UK / Cambridge, USA|isbn= 0-631-19405-3|page=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometime during this period, the Berber commander [[Uthman ibn Naissa|Uthman ibn Naissa ("Munuza")]] became governor of the [[Cerdanya]] (also including a large swathe of present-day Catalonia). By that time, resentment against Arab rulers was growing within the Berber troops.

==Raid into Aquitaine and Poitou==
[[File:Al-Andalus732.jpg|thumb|Umayyad Hispania in 732, Septimania is to the northeast, around [[Carcassonne]]]]

===Uthman ibn Naissa's revolt===
By 725, all of [[Septimania]] was under Umayyad rule. [[Uthman ibn Naissa]], the Pyrenean Berber lord ruler of the eastern Pyrenees, detached from Cordova, establishing a principality based on a Berber power base (731). The Berber leader allied with the Aquitanian duke Odo, who was eager to stabilize his borders, and is reported to have married Odo's daughter Lampegia. Uthman ibn Naissa went on to kill Nambaudus, the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Urgell|bishop of Urgell]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Collins, Roger| year = 1989 | title = The Arab Conquest of Spain 710-797 | publisher = Blackwell |location = Oxford, UK / Cambridge, USA|isbn= 0-631-19405-3|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; an official acting on the orders of the Church of Toledo.

The new Umayyad governor in Cordova, [[Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi]], mustered an expedition to punish the Berber commander's insubordination, surrounding and putting him to death in Cerdanya, according to the ''[[Chronicle of 754|Mozarabic Chronicler]]'', a just retribution for killing the Gothic bishop.

===Umayyad expedition over Aquitaine===
Emboldened by his success, he attacked Uthman ibn Naissa's Aquitanian ally Duke Odo, who had just encountered Charles Martel's devastating offensive on [[Bourges]] and northern Aquitaine (731). Still managing to recruit the necessary number of soldiers, the independent Odo confronted al-Ghafiqi's forces that had broken north by the western Pyrenees, but could not hold back the Arab commander's thrust against Bordeaux. The Aquitanian leader was beaten at the [[Battle of the River Garonne]] in 732. The Umayyad force then moved north to invade [[Poitou]] in order to plunder the [[Basilica of Saint-Martin-de-Tours]].

===Battle of Poitiers (732)===
Odo still found the opportunity to save his grip on Aquitaine by warning the rising Frankish commander Charles of the impending danger against the Frankish sacred city of Tours. [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] forces were defeated in the [[Battle of Tours|Battle of Poitiers]] in 732, considered by many the turning point of Muslim expansion in [[Gaul]]. With the death of Odo in 735 and after putting down the Aquitanian detachment attempt led by duke [[Hunald I of Aquitaine|Hunald]], [[Charles Martel]] went on to deal with Burgundy (734, 736) and the Mediterranean south of Gaul (736, 737).

==Expansion to Provence and Charles Martel==
[[File:Muslim troops leaving Narbonne to Pepin le Bref in 759.jpg|thumb|left|Departure of Umayyad troops from [[Narbonne]] to [[Pépin le Bref]], in 759, after 40 years of occupation.]]

Still, in 734, Umayyad forces (called "[[Saracens]]" by the Europeans at the time) under [[Abd al-Malik ibn Katan al-Fihri|Abd el-Malik el Fihri]], [[Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi|Abd al-Rahman]]'s successor, received without a fight the submission of the cities of [[Avignon]], [[Arles]], and probably [[Marseille]], ruled by count [[Maurontus]]. The patrician of Provence had called Andalusi forces in to protect his strongholds from the Carolingian thrust, maybe estimating his own garrisons too weak to fend off Charles Martel's well-organised, strong army made up of ''vassi'' enriched with Church lands.

Charles faced the opposition of various regional actors.  To begin with the Gothic and Gallo-Roman nobility of the region, who feared his aggressive and overbearing policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Collins, Roger|title=The Arab Conquest of Spain 710-797 | publisher = Blackwell |location = Oxford, UK / Cambridge, USA|isbn= 0-631-19405-3 |year = 1989 |page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles decided to ally with the [[Lombards|Lombard]] King [[Liutprand, King of the Lombards|Liutprand]] in order to repel the Umayyads and the regional nobility of Gothic and Gallo-Roman stock. He also underwent the hostility of the dukes of Aquitaine, who jeopardized Charles' and his successor Pepin's rearguard (737, 752) during their military operations in Septimania and Provence. The dukes of Aquitaine in turn largely relied on the strength of the [[Duchy of Gascony|Basque]] troops, acting on a strategic alliance with the Aquitanians since mid-7th century.

In 737, Charles captured and reduced Avignon to rubble, besides destroying the Umayyad fleet. The brother of Charles, [[Childebrand]] failed however in the siege of Narbonne. Charles attacked several other cities which had collaborated with the Umayyads, and destroyed their fortifications: [[Beziers]], [[Agde]], [[Maguelone]], [[Montpellier]], [[Nimes]]. Before his return to the northern Francia, Charles had managed to crush all opposition in Provence and Lower Rhone. Count Maurontus of Marseille fled to the Alps.

==Loss of Septimania==
Muslims reasserted their authority over Septimania for another 15 years. However, in 752, the newly proclaimed King Pepin, who was the son of the victor of Tours, Charles Martel, led a new campaign into Septimania, when regional Gothic allegiances were shifting in favour of the Frankish king. That year, Pepin conquered Nimes and went on to subdue most of Septimania up to the gates of Narbonne. In his quest to subdue the Muslim Gothic Septimania, Charles found the opposition of another actor, the [[Duke of Aquitaine]]. The [[Waifer of Aquitaine|Duke Waiffer]], aware of the expansionist ambitions of Charles' heir [[Pépin le Bref]], is recorded attacking him on the rearguard with an army of Basques on his siege of Narbonne (752).

It was ultimately the Frankish king who managed to [[Siege of Narbonne (752-759)|take Narbonne in 759]], after vowing to respect the Gothic law and earning the allegiance of the Gothic nobility and population, thus marking the end of the Muslim presence in southern Gaul. Furthermore, Pépin directed all his war effort against the Duchy of Aquitaine immediately after subduing Roussillon.

Pépin's son, [[Charlemagne]], fulfilled the Frankish goal of extending the defensive boundaries of the empire beyond Septimania and the [[Pyrenees]], creating a strong barrier state between the Umayyad Emirate and Francia. This [[buffer zone]] known as the "[[Spanish March]]" would become a focus for the [[Reconquista]].

==Legacy==
[[Arabic]] words were borrowed, such as ''tordjman'' (translator) which became ''drogoman'' in Provençal, and is still in use in the expression "par le truchement de"; ''charaha'' (to discuss), which became "charabia". Some place names were also derived from Arabic or in memory of past Muslim inhabitance, such as [[Ramatuelle]] and [[Saint-Pierre de l'Almanarre Abbey|Saint-Pierre de l'Almanarre]] (from ''al-manar'' i.e. 'the lighthouse').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Xavier de Planhol|author2=Paul Claval|title=An Historical Geography of France|date=1994|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521322089|page=84|edition=illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''VE Day 70: A Party To Remember''' was a 1940s themed concert and party held on Saturday 9 May 2015 on [[Horse Guards Parade]] in [[London]].  It was hosted by [[The Royal British Legion]], as part of the three-day celebration to commemorate the 70th anniversary of [[Victory in Europe Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-32670639 |title=VE Day: London concert held to mark anniversary - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=6 May 2015 |accessdate=10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3722">[[File:Viktor zhdanov viruela smallpox-231x300.jpg|right|thumb|Viktor Zhdanov]]'''Viktor Mikhailovich Zhdanov''' ({{lang-uk|Виктор Михайлович Ждaнов}}) (13 February 1914 – 1987) was a Soviet [[virologist]]. He was instrumental in the effort to [[Eradication of infectious diseases|eradicate]] [[smallpox]] globally.

Zhdanov was born in the village of [[Shtepino]] (in present-day [[Donetsk Oblast]], [[Ukraine]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Viktor+Zhdanov Viktor Zhandov] The Free Dictionary by Farlex, with the caveat that "Warning! The following article is from The Great Soviet Encyclopedia (1979). It might be outdated or ideologically biased."&lt;/ref&gt; After Zhdanov graduated from [[Kharkiv National Medical University|Kharkiv Medical Institute]] in 1936, he spent the next decade working as an army doctor, where he became interested in [[epidemiology]]; this work would directly lead to his doctoral thesis on [[Hepatitis A]].&lt;ref name="springerlink.com"&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/index/M8205V513225303R.pdf In memory of Victor Zhdanov] Archives of Virology 1991, Volume 121, Issue 1-4, pp 237-240&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946, Zhdanov was invited to become Chief of the Epidemiology Department of the I. I. Mechnikoff Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology in [[Kharkiv]], becoming its director two years later. His work in virus classification saw him admitted to the [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses]] as a life member.&lt;ref name="springerlink.com"/&gt;

In 1958, Zhdanov, as Deputy Minister of Health for the [[Soviet Union]], called on the [[World Health Assembly]] to undertake a global initiative to [[eradicate smallpox]]. The proposal (Resolution WHA11.54) was accepted in 1959.&lt;ref name= Fenner2&gt;{{cite book |author=Fenner, Frank |title=Smallpox and Its Eradication (History of International Public Health, No. 6) |publisher=World Health Organization |location=Geneva |year=1988 |chapter=Development of the Global Smallpox Eradication Programme |chapterurl=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/smallpox/9241561106_chp9.pdf |pages=366–418 |isbn=92-4-156110-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Zhdanov left the Ministry of Health in 1961, and focused on scientific research for the rest of his career. This work included studying [[influenza]], [[hepatitis]], and in the 1980s, [[HIV]].

In addition to his accomplishments in the field of public health, Zhdanov chaired the [[Soviet Union]]'s Interagency Science and Technology Council on Molecular Biology and Genetics, which among its many functions directed the [[Soviet biological weapons program]].&lt;ref&gt;Orent, Wendy (2004). ''Plague: The Mysterious Past and Future of the World's Most Dangerous Disease''. Free Press. pp. 9-11&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Zhdanov's relative obscurity, some have argued that Zhdanov has done "more good for humanity" than any other human in history.&lt;ref&gt;Macaskill, William.

[[File:William H. Cornwell, in uniform.jpg|thumb|Col. William H. Cornwell in the military uniform of the Hawaiian royal court]]
'''William Henry Cornwell''' (May 30, 1843 – November 18, 1903) was an American businessman, as well as a military colonel and politician of the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]]. He served two separate terms as [[Ministry of Finance (Hawaii)|Minister of Finance]] and was a member of Queen [[Liliuokalani]]'s last cabinet before the [[Overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii]].

==Early life==
He was born in [[Brooklyn, New York]], and relocated to [[Kingdom of Hawaii|Hawaii]] at an early age with his family where they became involved in sheep ranching in [[Waimea, Hawaii County, Hawaii|Waimea]].  He formed a partnership with James Louzada for a sugar cane plantation on [[Maui]], which was later sold to [[Claus Spreckels]].  Cornwell became a horse breeder, president of the Hawaiian Jockey Club, and a participant in the sport of horse racing.&lt;ref name="Death"&gt;{{cite news|title=Death of Col Cornwell|newspaper=The Hawaiian Star|location=Honolulu|date=November 18, 1903|volume=XI|issue=3639|page=1|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82015415/1903-11-18/ed-1/seq-1/}}; {{cite news|title=Topics of the Day|newspaper=The Independent|location=Honolulu|date=November 18, 1903|volume=XVII|issue=2664|page=2|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85047097/1903-11-18/ed-1/seq-2/}}; {{cite news|title=Sad News of Death Of Col.

==Political career==
Cornwell held the rank of [[Major]] and later [[Colonel]], as a staff member under both King [[Kalākaua]] and Queen [[Liliuokalani]].&lt;ref name="Death"/&gt; During the 1890 legislative assembly, Cornwell served as a member of the House of Nobles, the upper house of the [[legislature of the Kingdom of Hawaii|legislature]], for the island of Maui.{{sfn|Hawaii|Lydecker|1918|page=178}} He continued his term in the House during the legislative session of 1892–93, which became known as the "Longest Legislature" for its unprecedented duration of 171 days. On November 1, 1892, he was appointed by Queen Liliuokalani as Minister of Finance and to form the short lived Cornwell Cabinet which consisted of [[Joseph Nāwahī]], [[Charles T. Gulick]] and [[Charles F. Creighton]]. This cabinet existed for less than a day when it was ousted by the legislature with a vote of 26 to 13.{{sfn|Kuykendall|1967|page=557}} He was re-elected to his vacant legislative seat on December 5.{{sfn|Hawaii|Lydecker|1918|page=182}}

On January 13, 1893, Queen Liliuokalani re-appointed him as Minister of Finance to the Parker Cabinet with [[Samuel Parker (Hawaii)|Samuel Parker]], [[John F. Colburn]] and [[Arthur P. Peterson]] after the previous [[George N. Wilcox|Wilcox]] cabinet was voted out by the legislature the day before.&lt;ref name="CornwellRecords"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives1.dags.hawaii.gov/gsdl/collect/governme/import/import/Government%20Office%20Holders%20-%20Name%20IMJ/C/Cornwell,%20William%20H.jpg |title=Cornwell, William H. office record |work=state archives digital collections |publisher=state of Hawaii |accessdate=June 17, 2014 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="1893Cabinets"&gt;{{cite news|title=A New Cabinet – Some New Ministers for the Public to Swallow|newspaper=The Pacific Commercial Advertiser|location=Honolulu|date=January 14, 1893|volume=XVII|issue=3277|page=4|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85047084/1893-01-14/ed-1/seq-4/|accessdate=November 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had chosen these men specifically to support her plan of promulgating a new constitution while the legislature was not in session.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kuykendall|1967|pages=581–583}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Publisher and philanthropist [[Thurston Twigg-Smith]], the grandson of annexation leader [[Lorrin A. Thurston]], made the case that Cornwell was part of a royal inner [[cabal]] of the queen's own cabinet ministers who worked to oust the monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Twigg-Smith|1998|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; She attempted to promulgate a [[Proposed 1893 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii|new constitution]], but Cornwell and the rest of the cabinet were either opposed to or reluctant to sign the new constitution. Their opposition was one of the causes which ultimately led to her [[Overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii|overthrow]] by the [[Committee of Safety (Hawaii)|Committee of Safety]] headed by Thurston.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Twigg-Smith|1998|pages=64–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the overthrow, Cornwell and the rest of the Parker Cabinet were removed from office.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hawaii|Lydecker|1918|page=188}}; {{cite news|last1=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|title=A Provisional Government|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82016412/1893-01-18/ed-1/seq-4/|accessdate=November 6, 2016|work=The Daily Bulletin.|date=January 18, 1893|location= Honolulu, Hawaiian Islands|via=Chronicling America: Historic American Newspapers. Lib. of Congress.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the overthrow of the monarchy and the annexation of Hawaii to the United States, Cornwell became a member of the [[Democratic Party of Hawaii|Democratic Party]] and served as a delegate to [[1900 Democratic National Convention]] for the [[Territory of Hawaii]]. He died at his home at [[Waikapu]], Maui, on November 18, 1903, of heart disease.&lt;ref name="Death"/&gt; His remains were taken to Honolulu for his funeral and he was buried at the [[Oahu Cemetery]] in Honolulu.&lt;ref name="Grave"&gt;{{cite sign|title=Grave Marker of William H.
