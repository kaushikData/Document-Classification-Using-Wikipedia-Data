The '''Akyem''' are an [[Akan people]]. The term Akyem (Akim or Aki) is used to describe a group of three states: [[Akyem Abuakwa]], [[Akyem Kotoku]] and [[Akyem Bosome]]. These nations are located primarily in the [[Eastern Region (Ghana)|eastern region]]. The term is also used to describe the general area where the Akyem ethnic group clusters. The Akyem ethnic group make up between 3-9 percent of Ghana's population depending on how one defines the group and are very prominent in all aspects of Ghanaian life. The Akyem are a matrilineal people. The history of this ethnic group is that of brave warriors who managed to create a thriving often influential and relatively independent state within modern-day Ghana .&lt;ref name="GroupedRef1"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Y3U9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=akim++Gold+coast&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=FnxZTZv2CYT58AbIn9ixBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=akim%20%20Gold%20coast&amp;f=false ''Akan Laws and Customs''.]&lt;/ref&gt; When one talks of Ghanaian history, there is often mention of [[The Big Six (Ghana)|The Big Six)]]. These were six individuals who played a big role in the independence of Ghana. Of the big six, people of Akyem descent made up the majority.

==History and genesis of the Akyem states==
Akyemmansa is the three traditional areas of Akyem in the eastern region of Ghana. Historically, it has been attested via oral history that the Akyem people were one of the first Akan people to migrate south from the [[Sahel]] to the area that became [[Bono state]]. This area is the origin of modern Akan people. 
A group of [[Akan people]] who left [[Bonoman]] later formed the Adansi Kingdom in the mid-14th century.
The Adansis were known for their ability to build illustrious structures in their kingdom; hence the name ''adansi'' (builders).

In the first half of the 17th century, the area of what is now Ghana was dominated by three states the  [[Denkyera]], the Adansi, and the [[Akwamu]]. 
Within the Adansi state there were three military posts in the Western Portion Akyem Abuakwa, Akyem Kotoku, and Akyem Bosome.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=DRc4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=Adansi&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=E7F5TdnsEZPzrAHBxMjCBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Adansi&amp;f=false Kwamina B. Dickson, ''A Historical Geography of Ghana''], Cambridge Universitypress, 1969, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eastern Adansi as an entity lost much of its identity due to conflicts with neighboring states namely the [[Denkyira]] and much of it was absorbed in the [[Denkyira]] empire. The remnants of it, the Akyem states on the West were too strong to bring under Denkyira control. This gave rise to the identity and notoriety of the Akyem states in the later 17th century.
Thus, during the second half of the 17th century the area which became Ghana was dominated by three states the [[Denkyera]], Akyem and [[Akwamu]].&lt;ref name="GroupedRef2"&gt;[http://archive.lib.msu.edu/DMC/African%20Journals/pdfs/Institue%20of%20African%20Studies%20Research%20Review/1973v9n1/asrv009001004.pdf J. K. Fynn, "Asante and Akyrm Relations 1700 — 1831''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The rising [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]] Kingdom flourished under the leadership of Nana Osei Tutu, and during their ascendancy assimilated the once powerful Denkyira into the growing empire in the early 18th century. The Akyem nations, in an attempt to maintain autonomy and not crumble like the former superpower Denkyira, fled across the [[Pra River (Ghana)|River Pra]] to reinforce its military posts.

[[Osei Kofi Tutu I|Nana Osei Tutu]] chose to pursue the Akyem across the River Pra to teach them a lesson and, to attempt to further build the Ashanti Empire and expand its influence over another of its former subordinates. The Ashanti states which now included the former Denkyira empire used a methodology which involved overwhelming the opposing nation with sheer numbers and, demanding that they surrender.  While crossing the river with his massive army, he was ambushed by the Akyems and fell dead into the river, while his massive army was defeated. This was on a Thursday; this brought forth the great oath of the Ashantis, "Meka Yawada" (I swear by Thursday). The Akyems who carried out this ambush were known as "abuakwanfo" or "abuakwafo" (guerrilla fighters).
  
After the battle the Akyem moved southeastwards. As a result of this movement, some of the Akyems, especially the Kotokus, settled in the present-day Ashanti-Akyem area.

The majority of the Akyems, however, continued to flee south-eastwards and settled in several areas along the way until they came into contact with the [[Akwamu]], another one of the original three 17th-century powerful Akan states, which had influences from modern-day Ghana all the way to Benin.

==18th-century Akyem-Akwamu war==

The Akyems, especially the elite forces known as the Abuakwas but also the Kotokus, fought the Akwamus and emerged victorious. In defeating the Akwamu, the Akyem got control of the land the Akwamu had been occupying that belonged to the [[Ga people|Ga]] nation, and the Ga people were allowed more autonomy in their historic lands. Accra came under Akyem rule as they were Akwamu areas. Frimpong Manso of Kotoku and Ba kwante of Abuakwa shared authority over Accra and the Adangbe area. Owusu Akyem, son of a sister of the Okyenhene, became the administrator of the Adangbe area. 
Historian J. K. Fynn writes the following:&lt;ref name="GroupedRef2" /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Akyem conquest of Akwamu in 1730 was one of the most decisive victories in Gold Coast history. The event was described by contemporaries as the greatest revolution that had taken place in that part of the world. Since the Akwamu themselves destroyed the old Ga Kingdom in the late seventeenth&lt;!-- corrected from "seventeen" per [[Wikipedia:Quotations]] "trivial spelling or typographical errors that obviously do not affect the intended meaning; these may be silently corrected" --&gt; century.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After the war the Akyem Abuakwas made their temporary capitals in several former Akwamu areas, including [[Praso]], until they finally settled at [[Pameng]]. However, it was during the reign of Nana Ofori Panin that the capital of [[Akyem Abuakwa]] was finally moved to "Kyebirie" (named after a black hat used by a hunter using the area as his hunting grounds). It is now known as Kyebi.

The victory opened up trade between the Akyem - a nation described as having some of the largest gold deposits - and Europeans on the coast.

==Genesis of Akuapem state of Akyem==

The Akyem Abuakwa created the Akuapem state out of the greater half of western portion of the former Akwamu state and it included the Aburi, Berekuso, Abiriw, Apirede and Larte areas. Ofori Dua, brother of Ofori Panin, became Omanhene of the Akuapem state.

During the reign of the great warrior king (Adontehene) of the Akyems, [[Nana Owusu Akyem Tenten]], who was also known as the "Kwae-Bibirimhene" (King of the Dense Forest), the [[Guan people|Guan]] ethnic group and the Dawu ethnic group appealed to him for help to drive the Akwamus out of their area for them to enjoy peace.

The Akyems were [[mercenaries]] during that time period and were known for helping neighbouring states fight off the middle men of the [[slave trade]] and adjoining states in other battles that were in the interest of the Akyem states' ultimate objective of remaining strong and independent. Nana Owusu Akyem Tenten (King of the Dense Forest) agreed to send his nephew a respected soldier, Odehyee Safori, with an army. They were victorious over the Akwamu again these battles and created the states of Akropong and Amanokrom.
Safori pursued the Akwamus across the River Volta, where they settled up until the present day, with their capital at Akwamufie.

By 1740 the power within the coast was as follows: the Akyem firmly controlling a majority of the Eastern portion of the coastal area; with the Fante, Asante and Ahanta controlling the rest.

==Post 1740==

After 1740 the Akyem control of the coast was tentative and disagreements among the Akyem states weakened them. Also starting around this time, key areas on the coast were constantly being battled for with the Ashanti until 1816 when the Ashanti firmly established itself on the Eastern half of what became the Gold Coast in the former Akwamu State which the Akyem had won almost a century earlier. This was mainly due to a battle of attrition were the Akyem were out numbered. In the end, the Ashanti inherited some of the lands which had been won from the Akwamu including access to the coastal lands which essentially established the Asante empire as the most power state in the region which controlled all trade from the interior to the Coast. The Akim retreated back to their historic lands in what is now the Eastern Region of Ghana. To conclude, the Akyem are most famous because of the Akan states that existed before the rise of the empire of Ashanti the Akyem states remained the most independent and remained the most relevant.

J. K. Fynn writes:&lt;ref name="GroupedRef2" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Asante bid for supremacy, however was violently opposed by older Akans states whose kings refused to accept the pretensions and claims of what they considered an upstart dynasty. Of these Akan states, Akyem resistance to Asante political domination was not only persistent but also it was nearly the most successful.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Akyem during this tentative period between 1750 and 1816 still continued to show their ability to influence matters and act as Mercenaries helping those being oppressed by stronger states. This was demonstrated by helping the Ada, who were being oppressed by the Anlo, and defeating them in the battle of Nonombe around 1752,&lt;ref&gt;Allan Carpenter, Janis Fortman Children's Press, 1977, 95 pp.
Introduces the geography, history, government, economy, culture and people of this small country in western Africa.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Ernest Frank Ward, ''A History of the Gold Coast'', G. Allen &amp; Unwin, 1948; 387 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ashanti-Akyem relationship post-1816 continued to grow into one of mutual respect that still exists in recent times. A common saying among the Akans is, “Okyenhene nko ara na Osantehene ne no di nsawoso”, meaning literally: “The King of Ashanti treats none but the King of Akyem on familiar terms.” This is due to the fact that the Akyem were strong and relatively independent during the peak of the Ashanti empire when compared to neighbours.&lt;ref name="GroupedRef1" /&gt;

==Post-1816==
Post-1816 the Akyem enjoyed relative peace in their current location today and all of what became Ghana was under British rule by the early 20th century.

=== Nana Dokua era ===

The [[Nana Dokua]] era was known as an era of peace and prosperity due to her way of solving problems.
History has it that during the reign of the famous Nana Dokua (Abirie) as both okyehene (king) and ohemaa (queenmother), a quarrel arose between her and the Kotokuhene at that time. As a result, she ordered part of the Amantomiensa (soldiers of the Paramount stool), the Asiakwahene (King of Asiakwa area of Akyem) and the Begorohene (King of Begoro area of Akyem), to remove the Kotokus from Gyadam. This war, known as the "Gyadam War", forced the Kotoku to leave Gyadam. The Kwabenghene allowed them a safe passage and not a shot was fired when they passed through Kwabeng. The Kotokuhene was given land by the then chief of Wankyi, Barimah Awire (the Oseawuohene (Chief of Oseawuo area of Akyem Abuakwa) to settle at what is now known as Oda, the capital of Akyem Kotoku state.

During the reign of Nana Dokua, a section of the Juabens of [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]] revolted against the [[Golden Stool]] of Ashanti. The rebels, led by their chief, [[Nana Kwaku Boateng]], were forced to leave Juaben in Ashanti for the south. They found settlement at Kyebi, Kwabeng, Tafo, [[Asamankese]] and other parts of Akyem Abuakwa. Later, when the trouble in Juaben subsided, some of them returned to Ashanti but came back again. On the third occasion a negotiating settlement on their behalf was met and with the consent of both the Kukurantumihene (the [[Akan Chieftaincy|Adontehee]] of Akyem Abuakwa), Nana Kwaku Abrante and [[Okyehene]] Nana Dokua,  the Juabens got land. They settled on it under the leadership and rule of their chief, Nana Kwaku Boateng, calling the area New Juaben, with [[Koforidua]] as its capital. An annual fee was agreed to be paid to the Akyem this practice continued until Dr. Kwame Nkrumah abolished it after independence.

==Akyem people of today==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Akan12.jpg|left|thumb|The Okyehene meeting the former prime minister of the UK]] --&gt;
Pre and post colonially, the Akyem have been very involved in the intellectual and [[pan-Africanism|pan-African]] ideology that made Ghana unique among its peers. Several of the political and educated elite were of Akyem descent. This influence continues today in modern Ghana. The Akyem have been assimilated under the common Ghanaian identity where ethnicity does not play a role as it does in other countries.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

==Ohum Festival==
The traditional area of the Akyem is sometimes known as Kwaebibirim or the "Birim Forest" because of its abundance in rich natural resources. This area is in the tropical rain forest with fertile river valleys, deep loamy soil, and fresh fauna. The land is watered by the famous river Birim. The river Birim is the source of Ghana's diamond. The spiritual, physical and philosophical sustenance of the Akyem people are derived from river Birim. The Akyem do not worship the river ''per se'', they revere it as their source of inspiration, giving them life and strength.

During the [[Ohum Festival]], Akyems thank the creator for blessing their land with such a magnificent river (Birim). The products from the Akyems land and river are symbols which are used to remember ancestors who struggled and persevered to keep the society intact. During the festival the descendants pledge to continue the tradition, to keep Okyeman strong and free with peace and prosperity. They then pledge allegiance to their King (Okyehene) and their sub-chiefs and elders for their leadership and guidance. This ceremony of thanksgiving to the creator is the great festival of the Akyem people known as {{Clarify|date=November 2011}}. The Ohum festival is celebrated in Akyem Abuakwa in two parts: the Ohumkan and the Ohumkyire. The Ohum festival is celebrated with the chief and people of Akyem Tafo visiting the Gyempremo shrine to perform rituals and make sacrifices to the deity. Legend has it that any person who trips and falls on the return journey from the Gyempremo shrine will not live to see the new year. On the Ohum Tuesday, it is forbidden to make any noise including the pounding of fufu, the main staple diet of the Akan people till dusk.

'''Benteng Chinese''' ([[Bahasa Indonesia]]: '''Cina Benteng''' or '''Tionghoa Benteng''') are a [[Chinese-Indonesian]] community of '[[Peranakan]]' or mixed descent, native to the historic [[Tangerang]] area in the modern-day Indonesian provinces of [[Jakarta]], [[Banten]] and [[West Java]].&lt;ref name="Lohanda (1996)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lohanda|first1=Mona|title=The Kapitan Cina of Batavia, 1837-1942: A History of Chinese Establishment in Colonial Society|date=1996|publisher=Djambatan|location=Jakarta|isbn=9789794282571|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xKlwAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=cina+benteng&amp;dq=cina+benteng&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi5_6HS77LWAhUJTrwKHZlbA3Q4FBDoAQhKMAU|accessdate=20 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107161059/http://15meh.blogspot.com/2009/03/sejarah-cina-benteng-di-indonesia.html|title=Sejarah Cina Benteng di Indonesia !|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Knorr (2014)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Knorr|first1=Jacqueline|title=Creole Identity in Postcolonial Indonesia|date=2014|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=9781782382690|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1ZfiAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA137&amp;dq=cina+benteng&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjLzrWE77LWAhVLybwKHdVAC9AQ6AEIOjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=cina%20benteng&amp;f=false|accessdate=20 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The name 'Benteng' is derived from the Malay word for 'fortress', used formerly to refer to the historic Tangerang area. It refers to a colonial fortress on the banks of the [[Cisadane River]], built by the [[Dutch East India Company]] in the seventeenth century as part of their defence system against the neighbouring [[Sultanate of Banten]].&lt;ref name="Lohanda (1996)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Knorr (2014)" /&gt;

==History==

===Origin===
According to a [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] manuscript ''Tina Layang Parahyang'' (''Notes from [[Parahyangan]]''), the Chinese community of Batavia and Tangerang has existed since at least 1407 CE.&lt;ref name="Ensiklopedi Jakarta (2005)"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ensiklopedi Jakarta: culture &amp; heritage|date=2005|publisher=Pemerintah Provinsi Daerah Khusus Ibukota Jakarta, Dinas Kebudayaan dan Permuseuman|location=Jakarta|isbn=9789798682506|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CVpwAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Tina+Layang+Parahyang&amp;dq=Tina+Layang+Parahyang&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjy4KTy9LLWAhUJKJQKHbrYDuEQ6AEINzAD|accessdate=20 September 2017|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kompas (2010)"&gt;{{cite news|title="Heritage Trail" ke Pecinan Tangerang - Kompas.com|url=http://nasional.kompas.com/amp/read/2010/02/24/08035995/~Plesir|accessdate=20 September 2017|work=nasional.kompas.com|agency=Kompas|publisher=Kompas|date=February 24, 2010|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boen Tek Bio"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boen Tek Bio|title=Boen Tek Bio - Sejarah|url=http://www.boentekbio.org/index.php/profil/sejarah-boen-tek-bio|website=www.boentekbio.org|publisher=Boen Tek Bio|accessdate=20 September 2017|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; This manuscript recounts the arrival of among the earliest Chinese migrants to the area, led by a certain Tjen Tjie Lung, also dubbed 'Halung'.&lt;ref name="Ensiklopedi Jakarta (2005)" /&gt; They landed at the mouth of the Cisadane river, now called ''Teluk Naga'' (''Dragon's Bay'').&lt;ref name="Ensiklopedi Jakarta (2005)" /&gt;

Subsequent waves of Chinese immigration from the seventeenth century onwards took place under the auspices of the Dutch East India Company.&lt;ref name="Blussé (1986)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blussé|first1=Leonard|title=STRANGE COMPANY E-BOOK.|date=1986|publisher=Foris Publications|location=Riverton, USA|isbn=9783111544304|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_yYYnQAACAAJ&amp;dq=inauthor:%22Leonard+BLUSSE%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj4tfC5krPWAhVIjLwKHSqSAhIQ6AEILDAB|accessdate=20 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lohanda (1996)" /&gt; [[Boen Tek Bio]], the oldest Chinese temple in Tangerang, was built by the community in 1684.&lt;ref name="Boen Tek Bio" /&gt; Some Benteng Chinese trace their origin to those fleeing Batavia during the [[1740 Batavia massacre|Chinese Massacre of 1740]].&lt;ref name="Tempo (2010)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Aria|first1=Pingit|title=Asal Muasal "Cina Benteng" Dalam Teater Batavia 1740|url=https://metro.tempo.co/read/news/2010/12/12/057298390/Asal-Muasal-Cina-Benteng-Dalam-Teater-Batavia-1740|accessdate=20 September 2017|work=Tempo Metro|publisher=Tempo|date=December 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contribution to Dutch colonialism===
Many ethnic-Chinese allies and officials of the Dutch colonial authorities held office (see: ''[[Kapitan Cina]]''), and owned landed estates (''particuliere landerijen'') in the historic Tangerang area.&lt;ref name="Lohanda (1996)" /&gt; The historian [[Mona Lohanda]], herself a Benteng Chinese, goes so far as to say that "Tangerang was practically a Chinese private domain" (p. 258).&lt;ref name="Lohanda (1996)" /&gt; These landlords and bureaucrats also sponsored a large-scale migration of Chinese indentured laborers, who played a crucial role in the agricultural and economic development of the region.

===Revolution===

In the [[Indonesian Revolution]] from 1945 to 1949, tension rose between indigenous Indonesians and Benteng Chinese, who were perceived to be in favour of the Dutch colonial ''status quo''.&lt;ref name="Political Thinking of the Indonesian Chinese, 1900-1995"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies|title=Political Thinking of the Indonesian Chinese, 1900-1995: A Sourcebook|date=1997|publisher=NUS Press|location=Singapore|isbn=9789971692018|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SgWX7vf5vpsC&amp;dq=%22PAO+AN+TUI%22=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=20 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mozingo (2007)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mozingo|first1=David|title=Chinese Policy Toward Indonesia, 1949-1967|date=2007|publisher=Equinox Publishing|location=Singapore|isbn=9789793780542|url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=oboWNz-7biUC&amp;dq=%22PAO+AN+TUI%22%3Den&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=20 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 June 1946, riots targeting Benteng Chinese homes broke out in Tangerang, where revolutionary militiamen sympathetic to the Indonesian republican cause looted Chinese possessions, including [[Ancestor veneration in China|Chinese prayer tables]].&lt;ref name="Mozingo (2007)" /&gt;  These riots were apparently triggered by placement of an Indonesian flag with a Dutch flag by a [[Royal Netherlands East Indies Army|Dutch colonial army]] soldier of [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]] descent.

Indonesian journalist [[Rosihan Anwar]] wrote in the ''Merdeka'' daily on 13 June 1946 that relationship between native and Chinese Indonesians had reached an all-time low. Conditions worsened after [[Pao An Tui]], a pro-Dutch Benteng Chinese youth group, mobilized armed groups to evacuate Benteng Chinese residents to Batavia. Anti-Chinese rioting was successfully suppressed by the alliance of [[Pao An Tui]] and Dutch colonial troops.

At the time, nearly the entire Benteng Chinese population was displaced, and upon returning, they found that their properties were no longer intact: their land holdings had been confiscated or their homes had been looted.

Upon [[Indonesian independence]], Tangerang was the last part of Java to be handed over to the [[Republic of Indonesia]] by the Dutch.

==Traditional dress==
The traditional dress of the Benteng Chinese is a mixture of the Chinese traditional dress mostly of [[Hokkien]] heritage and the [[Betawi people|Betawi]] traditional dress. The males wear a black shirt and long pants with a traditional hat in [[Conical Asian hat|conical shape]]. The female dress called ''''hwa kun'''' is a blouse with headdress and veil. An alternative costume is the ''''kebaya encim'''' of [[Peranakan]] heritage.

==Benteng Chinese today==
Benteng Chinese culture today is a mixture of Betawi and Chinese cultures. One example is ''cokek,'' a dance featuring a male and female couple set to [[gambang kromong]] music. Religiously, the Benteng Chinese adhere to [[Confucianism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Taoism]], [[Catholicism]], [[Protestantism]], ancestor worship, and few adhere to [[Islam]].

Even if most Benteng Chinese do not speak [[Chinese language]], they maintain Chinese traditions including the use of [[Qing]] wedding costumes.

==Prominent Benteng Chinese==
Notable people with Benteng Chinese heritage or ties include:
* [[Tan Eng Goan]], the [[List of Kapitan Cina|first ''Majoor der Chinezen'' of Batavia]] (1802 - 1872): bureaucrat and landlord.
* [[Oey Giok Koen|Oey Giok Koen, Kapitein der Chinezen]] (died in 1912): bureaucrat, landlord and social activist.

==History==
The Bo people are native to southeastern [[Sichuan]]. In 1573 in [[Gong County, Sichuan]], they were massacred by [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] imperial troops, and have disappeared from Gong County since then (Tapp 2003:69-70).&lt;ref&gt;Tapp, Nicholas. 2003. ''The Hmong of China: Context, Agency, and the Imaginary'', 69-70. Leiden: Brill.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some descendants of the Bo were found in 2005 in [[Xingwen County]], [[Sichuan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinacourt.org/html/article/200504/05/157013.shtml|title=Bo Descendants Found in Xingwen| publisher=Chinacourt.org|date=2005-04-05|accessdate=2008-12-13|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scnjw.gov.cn/shangwu/jxtf/msfq/2008091808470754.html 悬棺之谜] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707041521/http://www.scnjw.gov.cn/shangwu/jxtf/msfq/2008091808470754.html |date=July 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xuanguan.gov.cn/lyzy_view.asp?id=1 珙县僰人悬棺]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sass.cn/bscnews.asp?NewsID=2911&amp;Csmallclassid=19&amp;zsmallclassID=25&amp;SpecialID=0 僰人后裔有新说] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707050755/http://www.sass.cn/bscnews.asp?NewsID=2911&amp;Csmallclassid=19&amp;zsmallclassID=25&amp;SpecialID=0 |date=July 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
[[Hanging coffins]] carved from a single log and bronze drums are widely found in the areas once inhabited by Bo people.&lt;ref name=culture/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110707043200/http://law.yuxi.gov.cn/flnew/xxxs.asp?id=2005010411272611127 僰为越论]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scnjw.gov.cn/shangwu/jxtf/zyhj/2008090209000488.html 兴文县境内民族] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090927090915/http://www.scnjw.gov.cn/shangwu/jxtf/zyhj/2008090209000488.html |date=September 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary peoples==
According to Edmondson (2003:165), the [[Lachi people]] of Vietnam and China may be descended from the Bo, based on the archaic [[exonym]] Labo (喇僰) in Chinese records.&lt;ref name="Edmondson2003"&gt;Edmondson, Jerold A. and Shaoni Li. 2003. "[http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf8/edmondson2003review.pdf Review of ''Lajiyu Yanjiu'' by Li Yunbing]." In Linguistics of the Tibeto-Burman Area, 26 , no. 1: 163-181.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lachi language]] belongs to the [[Kra languages|Kra]] subgroup of the [[Tai-Kadai languages|Kra-Dai]] language family. Today, the Lachi refer to themselves as ''qu31 te341'', with ''qu31'' meaning 'people' (from [[Proto-Kra language|Proto-Kra]] *khra&lt;sup&gt;C1&lt;/sup&gt; 'people').&lt;ref name="Edmondson2003"/&gt;

The [[Ku language|Ku]] of Qiubei County currently speak a [[Loloish languages|Loloish]] language, and still practice hanging coffin traditions. According to their own records, the Ku people's ancestors had migrated from [[Yibin]], [[Sichuan]] province a few centuries ago in order to escape wars.

==Languages==
Languages spoken by the Bo people(s) may have included:
*[[Kra languages]]
**[[Lachi language]]
*[[Loloish languages]]
**[[Ku language]]
**[[Luoji language]]
*[[Greater Bai languages]]
**[[Caijia language]]
**[[Longjia language]]

Words of Bo origin that still exist in the local dialect (''tuhua'' 土话) of [[Gong County, Sichuan]] include ''máng máng'' 牤牤 or alternatively ''niōng niōng'' ('pig 猪'), and ''gà gà'' 尬尬 ('meat 肉') (Huang &amp; Li 2006:25).

'''Brazilians in Germany''' consists mainly of immigrants and expatriates from [[Brazil]] as well as their locally born descendants. Many of them consist of [[German Brazilian]] returnees. According to Brazil's foreign relations department, there are about 95,160 Brazilians living in Germany.&lt;ref name="brasileirosnomundo.itamaraty"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.brasileirosnomundo.itamaraty.gov.br/a-comunidade/estimativas-populacionais-das-comunidades/APENDICE%20Diplomacia%20Consular%20-%20Brasileiros%20no%20Mundo.pdf| title=Apêndice: Número e distribuição dos brasileiros no mundo| publisher=[[Ministry of External Relations (Brazil)|Ministry of External Relations]]|language=pt| accessdate=2014-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Migration history==
A wave of Brazilian immigrants coming to Germany began in the early 1990s with the potent combination of a crashing Brazilian economy, rampant corruption and cheaper air fares. 

Many German Brazilians migrated to Germany to search for their own roots.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://expedition-heimat.dw.de/index.php?lang=en&amp;exp=bra2 BRAZILIANS IN GERMANY - HOMESICKNESS, CAREER AND CACHAÇA]", ''DW-WORLD - Deutsche Welle''.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Martius-Staden Institute'' in Panamy is the first stop for Brazilians researching their German ancestors. The institute’s archive has an extensive index of family names of German origin. In addition, many of Brazil's LGBT community chose to migrate to Germany due to the country's liberal attitude toward gays and many Brazilian artists consider working in Germany more prestigious than in Brazil.

==Culture==
Elements of Brazilian culture can be seen in many of Germany's major cities. Small shops have begun to carry Brazilian specialties like manioc flour and guaraná soda. The [[caipirinha]], Brazil's national drink, is now Germany's national cocktail and Germany has become the top importer of [[cachaca]]. [[Samba]] and [[capoeira]] are also flourishing in Germany. Portuguese-language church services can also be found in most major cities. 

There are numerous organizations, and societies have formed in Germany. These include the Forum Brasil in Berlin, the German-Brazilian Cultural Society in Coburg and the Casa do Brasil in Munich.

'''Child pornography in the Philippines''' and the growing [[commercial sexual exploitation of children]] in the [[Philippines]] have resulted in moves to combat this. In 2016, [[UNICEF]] declared that the Philippines is one of the top sources of child pornography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Villafania|first1=Alexander|title=UNICEF: PH still among top sources of child pornography|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/nation/06/08/16/unicef-ph-still-among-top-sources-of-child-pornography|accessdate=12 June 2017|work=ABS-CBN News|date=8 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==UNICEF Manila study==
According to a book by Arnie Trinidad entitled ''[[Child Pornography]] in the Philippines'' published by UNICEF Manila, a prominent case happened in [[Pagsanjan]], [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]], a rural community South of Manila. The case, according to Trinidad, involved the victimization of 590 children and adolescents aged 7 to 17 years old, by 22 American and European pedophiles who were involved in the production of pornography, drug abuse, and the [[Child sexual abuse|sexual abuse of children]].&lt;ref name=Trinidad53&gt;{{cite book|title=Child Pornography in the Philippines |last=Trinidad |first=Arnie C. |publisher=Psychosocial Trauma and Human Rights Program UP Center for Integrative and Development Studies and UNICEF Manila| year=2005 |pages=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study, published in 2005, documents other cases perpetrated by both foreign and local pedophiles and includes in depth analysis of the ongoing problem, in the context of the social, economic and legal environment.&lt;ref name=Trinidad53/&gt;

The UNICEF Manila study states that social factors increase the propensity of children to be victimized in pornography. Among these are the commercial sexual exploitation of children, [[sex tourism]], poverty, peer influence, availability of technology, cultural factors, among others.&lt;ref name=Trinidad51&gt;{{cite book|title=Child Pornography in the Philippines |last=Trinidad |first=Arnie C. |publisher=Psychosocial Trauma and Human Rights Program UP Center for Integrative and Development Studies and UNICEF Manila| year=2005 |pages=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Convention on the Rights of the Child==
In 2003, the Philippines ratified their signing of the United Nations Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography; the protocol requires its signatories to recognize child pornography as a crime against children and to treat any act that contributes to production or distribution of child pornography as a criminal offense, within two years of ratification.&lt;ref name=Trinidad100&gt;{{cite book|title=Child Pornography in the Philippines |last=Trinidad |first=Arnie C. |publisher=Psychosocial Trauma and Human Rights Program UP Center for Integrative and Development Studies and UNICEF Manila |year=2005 |pages=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although fully compliant comprehensive legislation has not yet been enacted, Philippine law criminalizes the use of children in any aspect of the production or distribution of pornography, defining a "child" as younger than 18 years; and with maximum penalties required if the child involved is younger than 12 years old.&lt;ref name=InterpolPhilippines&gt;{{cite web|title=Legislation of Interpol member states on sexual offences against children - Philippines|url=http://www.interpol.int/Public/Children/SexualAbuse/NationalLaws/csaPhilippines.pdf |format=PDF|publisher=Interpol}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anti-Child Pornography Alliance==
On September 15, 2007, the Children and Youth Secretariat of the Anti-Child Pornography Alliance (ACPA-Pilipinas) in the [[Philippines]] launched Batingaw Network "to protect and save children from all forms of abuses and exploitations." It is the largest anti-child pornography movement in the Philippines to date. It declared September 28 as the ''National Day of Awareness and Unity against Child Pornography.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Philippines: Catholic church pushes for anti-child porn bill passage -  Adnkronos Religion|url=http://www1.adnkronos.com/AKI/English/Religion/?id=3.0.3101536322|website=www1.adnkronos.com|accessdate=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8788">'''Deep Springs International''' (DSI) is a US [[nonprofit corporation]], headquartered in [[Léogâne]], [[Haiti]], which supports the establishment and expansion of Gadyen Dlo social enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.guidestar.org/organizations/20-5036775/deep-springs-international.aspx |title=Nonprofit Report for Deep Springs International, Inc |publisher=.guidestar.org |date=2010-03-01 |accessdate=2012-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gadyen Dlo has been produced and distributed in Haiti since 2002, originally supported by Emory University and the US Centers for Disease Control.

'''Gadyen Dlo''' ([[Haitian Creole]] for "Water Guardian") is a Haitian produced 0.7% [[sodium hypochlorite]] liquid solution used to [[water chlorination|chlorinate]] drinking water at "point of use." Gadyen Dlo is produced at four sites throughout Haiti (West, Northwest, North, and South Departments). Gadyen Dlo is distributed to households in refillable bottles, preferably along with safe water storage containers (5 gallon plastic buckets with taps, lids, and instructions with pictures and Creole).

Several studies by [[MIT]] and Emory University have consistently shown that 65 – 85% of households had positive chlorine residual at the time of an unannounced visit. An evaluation in 2007 revealed 76% of tests conducted by technicians showed positive chlorine residual, and there was no significant decrease in correct use after more than three years of families’ entrance into the program. An independent evaluation in 2010 among 706 children under 5 documented a reduction in diarrhoeal disease incidence of 51%.

== Household distribution ==
As of November 2010, the Gadyen Dlo household distribution program reaches almost 40,000 households and an estimated 20,408 children under 5 with continuous provision of Gadyen Dlo. These households are located primarily in rural areas throughout eight of the ten departments of Haiti. There are four chlorine production sites, fifteen distinct project sites, and a total of 230 distributors throughout all of these sites. Gadyen Dlo works with a variety of models in which distributors are compensated through structures ranging from full-time employees to part-time employees who conduct other community health services to vendors who simply resell products for a margin. These programs are supported by [[INGO]]s, churches, individuals, and corporate donors.

== Wholesale distribution ==
In 2010 alone, the Wholesale Program has delivered 13,669 L (3,611 gallons) of Gadyen Dlo to treat 48,505,526 L (12,813,805 gallons) of water. These deliveries have been made to and distributed by partners including DINEPA ([[Water supply and sanitation in Haiti|Haiti's Ministry of Water and Sanitation]]), UNICEF, United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti ([[MINUSTAH]]), and [[Samaritan's Purse]]. Additionally, 4,541 household safe water storage containers have been delivered to these partners, which will serve 20,889 Haitians. These distributions are typically accompanied by a training session for the partner organization's staff and distributors on hygiene promotion, distribution methods, and effective use of Gadyen Dlo.

== Dispensers ==
In partnership with [[Innovations for Poverty Action]] and [[Harvard University]], DSI is implementing a chlorine dispensers pilot project in the Grand-Goâve commune in Haiti that dispenses Gadyen Dlo "at source."

== Press ==
In addition to being the 2008 [[Templeton Freedom Awards]] recipient for Social Entrepreneurship, DSI and Gadyen Dlo have been recently recognized in the following media outlets:

This article is about the [[demographics|demographic]] features of the [[population]] of [[Italy]], including [[population density]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.

At the beginning of year 2017, [[Italy]] had an estimated population of 60.4 million. Its population density, at {{convert|201|PD/km2}}, is higher than that of most Western [[Europe]]an countries. However the distribution of the population is widely uneven. The most densely populated areas are the [[Po Valley]] (that accounts for almost half of the national population) and the metropolitan areas of [[Rome]] and [[Naples]], while vast regions such as the [[Alps]] and [[Apennines]] highlands, the plateaus of [[Basilicata]] and the island of [[Sardinia]] are very sparsely populated.

The population of Italy almost doubled during the twentieth century, but the pattern of growth was extremely uneven due to large-scale internal migration from the rural South to the industrial cities of the North, a phenomenon which happened as a consequence of the [[Italian economic miracle]] of the 1950-60's. In addition, after centuries of net emigration, from the 1980's Italy has experienced large-scale immigration for the first time in modern history. According to the Italian government, there were an estimated 5,000,073 foreign nationals resident in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.istat.it/it/archivio/149003].&lt;/ref&gt;

High fertility and birth rates persisted until the 1970's, after which they started to dramatically decline, leading to rapid population aging. At the end of the first decade of the 21st century, one in five Italians was over 65 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-SF-08-072/EN/KS-SF-08-072-EN.PDF |title=Ageing characterises the demographic perspectives of the European societies - Issue number 72/2008 |author=[[EUROSTAT]] |accessdate=28 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090102184227/http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-SF-08-072/EN/KS-SF-08-072-EN.PDF |archivedate=2 January 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as a result of the massive immigration of the last two decades, Italy has, in recent years, experienced a significant growth in birth rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://demo.istat.it/altridati/indicatori/2008/Tab_1.pdf|title=Crude birth rates, mortality rates and marriage rates 2005-2008|author=[[Istituto Nazionale di Statistica|ISTAT]]|accessdate=10 May 2009|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total fertility rate has also climbed from an all-time low of 1.18 children per woman in 1995 to 1.41 in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://demo.istat.it/altridati/indicatori/2008/Tab_4.pdf |title=Average number of children born per woman 2005-2008|author=[[Istituto Nazionale di Statistica|ISTAT]]|accessdate=3 May 2009|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1984 [[Lateran Treaty]] agreement, Italy has no official [[religion]]. However, it recognizes the role the [[Catholic Church]] plays in Italian society. 87.8% of the population identify as Catholic, 5.8% as non-believers or atheists, 2.6% as Muslims, and 3.8% adhere to other religions.

==Urbanization==

345%cacaq of Italian population is classified as [[Urban population|urban]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2212.html|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; a relatively low figure among developed countries. During the last two decades, Italy underwent a [[devolution]] process, that eventually led to the creation of administrative [[Metropolitan Area (Italy)|metropolitan areas]], in order to give major cities and their metropolitan areas a [[Provinces of Italy|provincial]] status (somehow similar to [[PRC]]'s [[direct-controlled municipality]]).
 
According to [[OECD]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://213.253.134.43/oecd/pdfs/browseit/0406041E.PDF |format=PDF |title=Competitive Cities in the Global Economy |author=[[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] |accessdate=30 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001192936/http://213.253.134.43/oecd/pdfs/browseit/0406041E.PDF |archivedate=1 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the largest conurbations are:
* [[Milan]] – 7.4&amp;nbsp;million
* [[Rome]] – 3.7&amp;nbsp;million
* [[Naples]] – 3.1&amp;nbsp;million
* [[Turin]] – 2.2&amp;nbsp;million

Italy used to be a country of mass emigration from the late 19th century until the 1970's. Between 1898 and 1914, the peak years of [[Italian diaspora]], approximately 750,000 Italians emigrated each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.thinkquest.org/26786/en/articles/view.php3?arKey=4&amp;paKey=7&amp;loKey=0&amp;evKey=&amp;toKey=&amp;torKey=&amp;tolKey= |title=Causes of the Italian mass emigration |publisher=ThinkQuest Library |date=15 August 1999 |accessdate=30 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010015938/http://library.thinkquest.org/26786/en/articles/view.php3?arKey=4&amp;paKey=7&amp;loKey=0&amp;evKey=&amp;toKey=&amp;torKey=&amp;tolKey= |archivedate=10 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Italian communities once thrived in the former African colonies of Eritrea (nearly 100,000 at the beginning of World War II),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilcornodafrica.it/rds-01emigrazione.pdf |title=Essay on Italian emigration to Eritrea (in Italian)|format=PDF |date= |accessdate=30 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Somalia and Libya (150,000 Italians settled in Libya, constituting about 18% of the total population).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/339574/Libya/46562/Italian-colonization Libya – Italian colonization].

As a result of the profound economic and social changes induced by postwar industrialization, including low birth rates, an aging population and thus a shrinking workforce, during the 1980's Italy became to attract rising flows of foreign immigrants. The present-day figure of about 5 million foreign residents, that make up some 9% of the total population, include 97,000 children born in Italy to foreign nationals (19% of total births in Italy) in 2014, but exclude foreign nationals who have subsequently acquired Italian nationality; this applied to 106,000 people in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.istat.it/it/archivio/149003 |title=La popolazione straniera residente in Italia nel 2014 |language=it |date=12 February 2015 |publisher=[[National Institute of Statistics (Italy)]] |accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.istat.it/salastampa/comunicati/non_calendario/20091008_00/testointegrale20091008.pdf |title=La popolazione straniera residente in Italia al 1° gennaio 2009|publisher= [[National Institute of Statistics (Italy)|Istat]]| pages        = 1–3|language = Italian|trans-title=The Foreign Population Resident in Italy on 1 January 2009|format=PDF |date= 8 October 2009|accessdate=27 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official figures also exclude illegal immigrants, the so-called ''clandestini'', whose numbers are very difficult to determine. In May 2008 ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' quoted an estimate of 670,000 for this group.&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Rosenthal, "[http://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2008/05/16/italy_cracks_down_on_illegal_immigration/ Italy cracks down on illegal immigration]". [[The Boston Globe]]. 16 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, and more recently, the [[2004 enlargement of the European Union|2004]] and [[2004 enlargement of the European Union|2007]] enlargements of the European Union, the main waves of migration came from the former socialist countries of [[Eastern Europe]] (especially [[Romania]], [[Albania]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Poland]]). The second most important area of immigration to Italy has always been the neighbouring [[North Africa]] (in particular, [[Morocco]], [[Egypt]] and [[Tunisia]]), with soaring arrivals as a consequence of the [[Arab Spring]]. Furthermore, in recent years, growing migration fluxes from the [[Far East]] (notably, [[People's Republic of China|China]]&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6550725.stm Milan police in Chinatown clash]". BBC News. 13 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Philippines]]) and [[Latin America]] ([[Ecuador]], [[Peru]]) have been recorded. Currently, circa one million [[Romanians]] (around one tenth of them being [[Romani people|Roma]]&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=42404 EUROPE:  Home to Roma, And No Place for Them] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305064429/http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=42404 |date=5 March 2012 }}". [[Inter Press Service|IPS]] ipsnews.net.&lt;/ref&gt;) are officially registered as living in Italy, representing thus the most important individual country of origin, followed by Albanians and Moroccans with about 500,000 people each. The number of unregistered Romanians is difficult to estimate, but the Balkan Investigative Reporting Network suggested that in 2007 that there might have been half a million or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.birn.eu.com/en/111/15/5745/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029110649/http://www.birn.eu.com/en/111/15/5745/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=29 October 2008 |title=Balkan Investigative Reporting Network |publisher=Birn.eu.com |date=08 11 2007 |accessdate=4 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|According to Mitrica, an October 2005 Romanian report estimates that 1,061,400 Romanians are living in Italy, constituting 37% of 2.8&amp;nbsp;million immigrants in that country&lt;ref&gt;Mitrica, Mihai [https://web.archive.org/web/20071023072029/http://evz.ro/article.php?artid=201813 Un milion de romani s-au mutat in Italia] ("One million Romanians have moved to Italy"). ''Evenimentul Zilei'', 31 October 2005. Visited 11 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; but it is unclear how the estimate was made, and therefore whether it should be taken seriously.|group=note}} Overall, at the end of the 2000s the foreign born population of Italy was from: Europe (54%), Africa (22%), Asia (16%), the Americas (8%) and Oceania (0.06%). The distribution of immigrants is largely uneven in Italy: 84.9% of immigrants live in the northern and central parts of the country (the most economically developed areas), while only 15.1% live in the southern half of the peninsula.

There is significant cultural, [[Languages of Italy|linguistic]], [[Genetic history of Italy|genetic]], [[History of Italy#Unification (1814 to 1861)|historical political]] diversity within the "Italian" ethnicity, enough to constitute several distinct ethnicities by some standards; when Italy unified in 1861, only 3% of the population spoke Standard Italian, with the rest speaking various other languages, and today an estimated 50% of Italians speak a language other than standard Italian as their L1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/ita|title=Italian|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friulians]], [[Sicilians]], and [[Sardinian people|Sardinians]] are examples of distinct peoples in Italy.

[[File:Linguistic_map_of_Italy_-_Legend.svg|right|thumb|300px|Languages and regional varieties in Italy.]]

Italy's official language is Italian. [[Ethnologue]] has estimated that there are about 55 million speakers of the language in Italy and a further 6.7&amp;nbsp;million outside of the country, primarily in the neighboring countries and in the [[Italian diaspora]] worldwide.&lt;ref name="ethnologue.com" &gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=ita Ethnologue report for language code:ita (Italy)] - Gordon, Raymond G., Jr. (ed.), 2005. Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Fifteenth edition. Dallas, Tex.: SIL International. Online version&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian, adopted by the state after the [[unification of Italy]], is based on the [[Florentine dialect|Florentine]] variety of [[Tuscan language|Tuscan]] and is somewhat intermediate between the [[Italo-Dalmatian languages]] and the [[Gallo-Romance languages]]. Its development was also influenced by the Germanic languages of the [[Migration period|post-Roman invaders]].

Italy has numerous dialects spoken all over the country, including the actual [[Regional Italian|varieties of Italian]] specific to each cultural region. However, the establishment of a national education system has led to decrease in variation in the languages spoken across the country. Standardisation was further expanded in the 1950s and 1960s thanks to economic growth and the rise of [[mass media]] and [[television]] (the state broadcaster [[RAI]] helped set a standard Italian).

Twelve minority and regional languages are legally recognized and protected,&lt;ref&gt;[L.cost. 26 febbraio 1948, n. 4, Statuto speciale per la Valle d'Aosta; L.cost. 26 febbraio 1948, n. 5, Statuto speciale per il Trentino-Alto Adige; L.cost. 31 gennaio 1963, n. 1, Statuto speciale della Regione Friuli Venezia Giulia]&lt;/ref&gt; and they have co-official status alongside Italian in various parts of the country. French is co-official in the [[Valle d’Aosta]]—although in fact [[Franco-Provencal]] is more commonly spoken there. German has the same status in the province of [[South Tyrol]] as, in some parts of that province and in parts of the neighbouring [[Trentino]], does [[Ladin language|Ladin]]. [[Slovene language|Slovene]] and [[Friulian language|Friulian]] are officially recognised in the provinces of [[Province of Trieste|Trieste]], [[Province of Gorizia|Gorizia]] and [[Province of Udine|Udine]] in [[Friuli Venezia Giulia|Venezia Giulia]]. The [[Sardinian language]] is recognized as co-official in [[Sardinia]].

In these regions official documents are either bilingual (trilingual in Ladin communities), or available upon request in the co-official language. Traffic signs are also multilingual, except in the Valle d’Aosta where — with the exception of [[Aosta]] itself which has retained its Latin form in Italian as in English—French toponyms are generally used, attempts to [[Fascist Italianization|Italianise]] them during the Fascist period having been abandoned. Education is possible in minority languages where such schools are operating.

[[UNESCO]] and other authories recognize many other endangered languages, which are not protected by Italian government: [[Piedmontese language|Piedmontese]], [[Venetian language|Venetian]], [[Ligurian (Romance language)|Ligurian]], [[Lombard language|Lombard]], [[Emiliano-Romagnolo language|Emilian-Romagnolo]], [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan]] and [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]].

[[Roman Catholicism]] is by far the largest religion in the country, although the Catholic Church is no longer officially the [[state religion]]. In 2006, 87.8% of Italy's population self-identified as Roman Catholic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.corriere.it/Primo_Piano/Cronache/2006/01_Gennaio/17/cattolici.shtml|title=Italy: 88% of Italy's population declare themselves Catholic|publisher=Corriere della Sera|date=18 January 2006|accessdate = 10 May 2009|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt; although only about one-third of these described themselves as active members (36.8%).

Most Italians believe in God, or a form of a spiritual life force. According to the most recent [[Eurobarometer|Eurobarometer Poll]] 2005:&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_225_report_en.pdf ReportDGResearchSocialValuesEN2.PDF] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060524000000/http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_225_report_en.pdf |date=24 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 74% of Italian citizens responded that 'they believe there is a God', 16% answered that 'they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force' and 6% answered that 'they do not believe there is any sort of spirit, God, or life force'. 
There are no data collected through census.

===Christianity===
[[File:Santa Maria del Fiore.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The [[Santa Maria del Fiore]] cathedral in [[Florence]], which has the biggest brick dome in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tripleman.com/index.php?showimage=737 |title=The Duomo of Florence &amp;#124; Tripleman |publisher=www.tripleman.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brunelleschisdome.com/ |title=brunelleschi's dome - Brunelleschi's Dome |publisher=Brunelleschisdome.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is considered a masterpiece of Italian architecture.]]

The Italian Catholic Church is part of the global Roman Catholic Church, under the leadership of the [[Pope]], [[curia]] in Rome, and the [[Conference of Italian Bishops]]. In addition to Italy, two other sovereign nations are included in Italian-based dioceses, [[San Marino]] and [[Vatican City]]. There are 225 dioceses in the Italian Catholic Church, see further in this article and in the article [[List of the Roman Catholic dioceses in Italy]]. Even though by law Vatican City is not part of Italy, it is in Rome, and along with [[Latin]], Italian is the most spoken and second language of the [[Roman Curia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/country_profiles/1066140.stm|work=BBC News|title=Country profile: Vatican|date=26 October 2009|accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Italy has a rich Catholic culture, especially as numerous Catholic [[saint]]s, [[martyr]]s and popes were Italian themselves. Roman Catholic art in Italy especially flourished during the [[Middle Ages]], [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] periods, with numerous Italian artists, such as [[Michelangelo]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Raphael]], [[Caravaggio]], [[Fra Angelico]], [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]], [[Sandro Botticelli]], [[Tintoretto]], [[Titian]], [[Raphael]] and [[Giotto]]. Roman Catholic architecture in Italy is equally as rich and impressive, with churches, basilicas and cathedrals such as [[St Peter's Basilica]], [[Florence Cathedral]] and [[St Mark's Basilica]]. Roman Catholicism is the largest religion and denomination in Italy, with around 87.8% of Italians considering themselves Catholic. Italy is also home to the greatest number of [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]]s in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiu.edu/~mirandas/countrynow.htm#Top|title=The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church - Living cardinals arranged by country|first=Salvador|last=Miranda|website=www.fiu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the country with the greatest number of Roman Catholic churches per capita.&lt;ref name="kwintessential.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kwintessential.co.uk/resources/global-etiquette/italy-country-profile.html |title=Italy - Italian Language, Culture, Customs and Business Etiquette |publisher=Kwintessential.co.uk |accessdate=2010-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though the main Christian denomination in Italy is Roman Catholicism, there are some minorities of [[Protestant]], [[Waldensian]], [[Eastern Orthodox]] and other Christian churches.

In the 20th century, [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Pentecostalism]], non-denominational [[Evangelicalism]], and [[Mormonism]] were the fastest-growing Protestant churches. Immigration from [[Western Africa|Western]], [[Central Africa|Central]], and [[Eastern Africa]] at the beginning of the 21st century has increased the size of [[Baptist]], [[Anglicanism|Anglican]], Pentecostal and Evangelical communities in Italy, while immigration from [[Eastern Europe]] has produced large Eastern Orthodox communities.

In 2006, Protestants made up 2.1% of Italy's population, and members of Eastern Orthodox churches comprised 1.2% or more than 700,000 Eastern Orthodox Christians including 180,000 [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ortodossia.it/The%20Holy%20Orthodox%20Archdiocese%20of%20Italy%20ed%20Malta.htm The Holy Orthodox Archdiocese of Italy and Malta] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305214703/http://www.ortodossia.it/The%20Holy%20Orthodox%20Archdiocese%20of%20Italy%20ed%20Malta.htm |date=5 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 550,000 Pentecostals and Evangelists (0.8%), of whom 400,000 are members of the [[Assemblies of God]], about 250,000 are [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] (0.4%),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=2015 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses|publisher=Watch Tower Society|page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; 30,000 [[Waldensians]],&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.chiesavaldese.org/pages/storia/dove_viviamo.php Waldensian Evangelical Church] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060211233818/http://www.chiesavaldese.org/pages/storia/dove_viviamo.php |date=11 February 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 25,000 [[Seventh-day Adventists]], 22,000 Mormons, 15,000 Baptists (plus some 5,000 Free Baptists), 7,000 [[Lutherans]], 4,000 [[Methodists]] (affiliated with the Waldensian Church).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oikoumene.org/en/member-churches/regions/europe/italy/evangelical-methodist-church-in-italy.html World Council of Churches] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130325172232/http://www.oikoumene.org/en/member-churches/regions/europe/italy/evangelical-methodist-church-in-italy.html |date=25 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other religions===
The longest-established religious faith in Italy is [[Judaism]], Jews having been present in [[Ancient Rome]] before the birth of Christ. Italy has seen many influential Italian-Jews, such as [[Luigi Luzzatti]], who took office in 1910, [[Ernesto Nathan]] served as mayor of Rome from 1907 to 1913 and [[Shabbethai Donnolo]] (died 982). During the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], Italy took in many Jewish refugees from [[Nazism|Nazi]] Germany. However, with the creation of the Nazi-backed puppet [[Italian Social Republic]], about 15% of 48,000 Italian Jews were killed. This, together with the emigration that preceded and followed the Second World War, has left only a small community of around 45,000 Jews in Italy today.

Due to immigration from around the world, there has been an increase in non-Christian religions. As of 2009, there were 1.0 million [[Muslims]] in Italy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adnkronos.com/AKI/English/Religion/?id=3.0.3202304679|title=Italy: Country's muslims raise funds to help quake victims -  Adnkronos Religion|website=www.adnkronos.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; forming 1.6 percent of population; independent estimates put the Islamic population in Italy anywhere from 0.8 million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4385768.stm|work=BBC News|title=Muslims in Europe: Country guide|date=23 December 2005|accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 1.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/24/world/europe/24iht-rome.html?_r=1|work=The New York Times|date=25 July 2005|accessdate=31 March 2010|first=Elisabeth|last=Rosenthal|title=Pressure is growingon Muslims in Italy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only 50,000 Italian Muslims hold [[Italian citizenship]].

There are more than 200,000 followers of faith originating in the Indian subcontinent, including some 70,000 [[Sikhs]] with 22 [[gurdwaras]] across the country,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nriinternet.com/EUROPE/ITALY/2004/111604Gurdwara.htm|title=NRI Sikhs in Italy|website=www.nriinternet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 70,000 [[Hindus]], and 50,000 [[Buddhists]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buddhismo.it/ente.htm Unione Buddhista Italiana - UBI: L'Ente] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070404034319/http://www.buddhismo.it/ente.htm |date=4 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are an estimated some 4,900 Bahá'ís in Italy in 2005.&lt;ref name="WCE-05"&gt;{{cite web| title = Most Baha'i Nations (2005)|work = QuickLists &gt; Compare Nations &gt; Religions &gt;|publisher = The Association of Religion Data Archives|year = 2005| url =http://www.thearda.com/QuickLists/QuickList_40c.asp|accessdate = 2010-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethnic groups===
Italian: 92%, other [[European ethnic groups|European]] (mostly [[Romanian people|Romanian]], [[Albanian people|Albanian]], [[Ukrainian people|Ukrainian]] and others) 5%, North African (mostly [[Moroccan people|Moroccan]]) 1.5%, others 2.5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.demo.istat.it/str2007/index_e.html|title=Statistiche demografiche ISTAT|website=www.demo.istat.it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically the ethnicity of the Italian people was mainly made of romanized autochthonous [[Italic peoples|Italics]] and [[Celts|Gauls]], with additions of Germanic populations (like [[Longobards]]) and -in very small amounts- of other bordering people (like Slovenes, Austrians, Albanians, etc..){{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}.

[[File:Albero y.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Genealogical tree of Y chromosome haplogroups with main Italian ones highlighted in green]]
Approximately half of Italian males belong to the Y-DNA haplogroup R1b which is standard amongst most west European populations. According to data found through different sources, samples, and studies by Eupedia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eupedia.com/europe/european_y-dna_haplogroups.shtml|title=European Y-DNA haplogroups frequencies by country|first=|last=Maciamo|website=Eupedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the percentages of [[Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup|Y-dna haplogroups]] observed  were :

*[[Haplogroup R1 (Y-DNA)|R1]] (51.5% : 49% R1b and 2.5% R1a)
*[[Haplogroup J (Y-DNA)|J]] (20% : 18% J2 and 2% J1)
*[[Haplogroup E1b1b (Y-DNA)|E1b1b]] (11%)
*[[Haplogroup G (Y-DNA)|G]] (7%)
*[[Haplogroup I (Y-DNA)|I]] (6.5% : 2.5% I1, 3% I2 + I2a and 1% I2b)

This article is about the [[demographics|demographic]] features of the [[population]] of [[Oman]], including [[population density]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.

About 50% of the population in Oman lives in [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]] and the [[Al Batinah Region|Batinah]] coastal plain northwest of the capital; about 200,000 live in the [[Dhofar Governorate|Dhofar (southern) region]]; and about 30,000 live in the remote [[Musandam Peninsula]] on the [[Strait of Hormuz]]. Some 2 million (45% of entire population) expatriates live in Oman, most of whom are workers from [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Morocco]], [[Jordan]], and the [[Philippines]].

Since 1970, the government has given high priority to education in order to develop a domestic work force, which the government considers a vital factor in the country's economic and social progress. In 1986, Oman's first university, [[Sultan Qaboos University]], opened. Other post secondary institutions include a law school, technical college, banking institute, teachers' training college, and health sciences institute. Some 200 scholarships are awarded each year for study abroad.

Nine private colleges exist, providing two-year post secondary diplomas. Since 1999, the government has embarked on reforms in higher education designed to meet the needs of a growing population. Under the reformed system, four public regional universities were created, and incentives are provided by the government to promote the upgrading of the existing nine private colleges and the creation of other degree-granting private colleges.

==Ethnic groups==
According to the CIA, Oman's population primarily consists of [[Arabs|Arab]], [[Baloch people|Baluchi]], [[Desi|South Asian]] (Indian, Pakistani, Sri Lankan, Bangladeshi), and [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] ethnic groups.&lt;ref name="pop"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/mu.html |title=Oman|publisher=CIA – The World Factbook|accessdate=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Omani society is largely [[tribal]].&lt;ref name=fa&gt;{{cite web|title=Creating Modern Oman: An Interview with Sultan Qabus|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/53039/judith-miller/creating-modern-oman-an-interview-with-sultan-qabus}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=inequal&gt;{{cite web|title=Social and Gender Inequality in Oman: The Power of Religious and Political Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eb6Pgy1Q0vQC&amp;pg=PA40&amp;lpg=PA40&amp;dq|page=40|quote=Omani society largely remains attached to the pre-1970 tribal structure.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oman has three known types of identities. Two of these identities are 'tribalism and Ibadism', the third identity is linked to 'maritime trade'. The first two identities are widespread in the interior of Oman, these identities are closely tried to tradition, as a result of lengthy periods of isolation. The third identity, which pertains to Muscat and the coastal areas of Oman, is an identity that has become embodied in business and [[trade]]. The third identity is generally seen to be more open and tolerant towards others. Thus, tension between socio-cultural groups in Omani society exists. More important is the existence of [[social inequality]] between these three groups.&lt;ref name=inequal/&gt;

==Migration==
Because of the combination of a relatively small Omani population and a fast-growing oil-driven economy, Oman has attracted many migrants. At the 2014 census the total expatriate population was 1,789,000 or 43.7% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://85.154.248.117/MONE2010/ Preliminary Results of the Oman Census 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706031533/http://85.154.248.117/MONE2010/ |date=2011-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most migrants are males from India (465,660 for both sexes), Bangladesh (107,125) or Pakistan (84,658). Female migrant workers are mainly from Indonesia (25,300), the Philippines (15,651) or Sri Lanka (10,178). Migrants from Arab countries account for 68,986 migrants (Egypt 29,877, Jordan 7,403, Sudan 6,867, UAE 6,426, Iraq 4,159, Saudi Arabia 725, Bahrain 388, Qatar 168, other 12,683) and other Asian countries for 12,939 migrants. There were 8,541 migrants from Europe, 1,540 from the United States and 15,565 from other countries.

'''Donald Niven Wheeler''' (October 23, 1913 - November 8, 2002) was a lifelong [[social activist]], [[teacher]] and member of the [[Communist Party]], as well as an accused [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] spy. Allegations of [[espionage]] made against him were never proved despite repeated investigations.

==Education==
He was a graduate of [[Reed College]]. He was a brilliant scholar who upon graduation received a [[Rhodes Scholarship]] to [[Oxford University]], and there, spurred by what he learned through his studies in economics, he joined the university branch of the Communist Party. He did post-graduate work at the [[University of Paris]] but dropped out to join the [[International Brigades]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]]. There he met Mary Lukes Vause, a fellow graduate of Reed College, a new mother and the widow of his best friend, Clare Vause. They were married in 1938.&lt;ref name=pww/&gt; He later returned to Oxford (1968) and completed his doctoral studies.

[[Duncan Lee]], a college classmate, described him as a really "[[Political progressivism|progressive person]]".

==Government==
Wheeler was associated with various so-called "[[Comintern]]" organizations before being employed by the government, first in the [[United States Department of Agriculture]], later the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Department of Treasury]].  From 1941 to 1946, Wheeler was employed by the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS) in [[Washington, D.C.]]  Wheeler was allegedly a member of the white collar unit of the Communist Party of the [[District of Columbia]].  [[Franz Leopold Neumann|Franz Neumann]], who worked with him in the OSS, allegedly gave a good report to [[Soviet Union|Moscow]], describing him as "a calm and progressive man".

==Perlo group==
In November 1943, [[Earl Browder]], Chairman of the [[CPUSA]], turned control of the [[Perlo group]] of Soviet spies over to [[Jacob Golos]] two months before Golos's death,and the group was subsequently taken over by his girlfriend, [[Elizabeth Bentley]].

Perlo later wrote to his Soviet supervisors: "He has access to excellent material and once given an explanation of what was wanted, worked hard and bravely to get it... He has not been reckless but has gotten materials regularly under security conditions more difficult than those faced by most others in the group." &lt;ref&gt;Victor Perlo, report on Donald Niven Wheeler (January, 1945)&lt;/ref&gt;"Beginning in 1944, virtually the entire range of OSS analytic and planning documents on Nazi Germany and its postwar prospects flowed continuously from General Donovan's Washington headquarters through Donald Wheeler to Pavel Fitin's offices in Moscow." &lt;ref&gt;Allen Weinstein, The Hunted Wood: Soviet Espionage in America (1999) page 253&lt;/ref&gt;

As a member of the OSS Research and Analysis Division, Wheeler received secret and confidential 'ditto' copies of monthly and semi-monthly reports of political developments throughout the world. He had received government security clearance to do so. Wheeler is alleged to have passed these reports as well as handwritten and typewritten material of cable reports from the [[State Department]] and the OSS to [[OGPU|Soviet intelligence]].  Wheeler is alleged to have provided information on the organization and policies of British intelligence services and furnished memoranda prepared by the Foreign Nationalities Branch of OSS on material relating to the particular racial groups and activities within the United States. None of these allegations, launched at the height of the McCarthyite witch-hunts of the early 1950s, were ever proved, and no charges were ever brought against Wheeler, who contended that the charges of espionage were a response to his outspoken criticism of the failings of the American economic and political system.

Beginning in 1944, the entire range of OSS planning documents on the postwar occupation of [[Germany]] are alleged to have been supplied to KGB head [[Pavel Fitin]] through Wheeler.  Some observers considered Wheeler the most active operative within the Perlo group, and his complicity was alleged to have been corroborated by information exhumed from the [[NKVD]] archives in the 1990s.  Wheeler allegedly appears in [[Venona]]   as a Soviet source under the cover name "Izra". 

Donald Niven Wheeler continued to pass documents to the Soviet Union after the war. In November, 1945 he sent information on various issues. This included a report on the Italian domestic political situation on the eve of elections in that country; a copy of the confidential report written by the military governor in the U.S. occupation zone of the USSR; OSS reports about current political events in the USSR; OSS weekly reports on political events in Europe and a State Department intelligence report on the Middle East. &lt;ref&gt;http://spartacus-educational.com/Donald_Niven_Wheeler.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, Wheeler became a [[dairy farmer]] in [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington state]] because he was unable to find teaching work. Wheeler was [[subpoena]]ed as a hostile witness before federal [[grand juries]] in Washington, D.C., and [[San Francisco]], leaving his pregnant wife and four children to milk the cows. He was also summoned three times before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]]. His sister, Margaret Jean Schuddakopf, said that his courage and steadfastness was her beacon as she fought her own battle for the right to teach.

He had a long and distinguished teaching career, despite constant harassment and "[[blacklist]]ing". He taught at [[Yale University]], at [[Franconia College]] in [[Franconia, New Hampshire]], and at [[Brandon University]] in [[Manitoba]], Canada.

==Death==
He died on November 8, 2002 in [[Seattle]], Washington.&lt;ref name=pww&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=

The [[Philippines]] is inhabited by more than 175 [[ethnolinguistic group|ethnolinguistic]] nations, the majority of whose languages are Austronesian in origin, then Han Chinese, then European (mostly Spanish). Many of these nations converted to [[Christianity]], particularly the lowland-coastal nations, and adopted many foreign elements of culture. Ethnolinguistic nations include the [[Ivatan people|Ivatan]],  [[Pangasinan people|Pangasinan]], [[Kapampangan people|Kapampangan]], [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]], [[Bicolano people|Bicolano]], [[Visayans]] ([[Masbateño people|Masbateño]], [[Hiligaynon people|Hiligaynon]], [[Cebuano people|Cebuano]], [[Waray people|Waray]], [[Butuanon people|Butuanon]], [[Romblomanon people|Romblomanon]], [[Kamayo]], [[Cuyunon people|Cuyonon]], and [[Surigaonon people|Surigaonon]]), [[Zamboangueño]], [[Subanon people|Subanon]], and more.

In western [[Mindanao]] and the [[Sulu Archipelago]], there are ethnolinguistic nations who practice [[Islam]]. The Spanish called them [[Moro people|Moros]] after the [[Moors]], despite no resemblance or cultural ties to them apart from their religion. In the [[Agusan Marsh Wildlife Sanctuary|Agusan Marsh]] and the highlands of Mindanao, there are native ethnic groups collectively known as the [[Lumad]]. Most maintain their animistic beliefs and traditions, though some of them have converted to Christianity as well.

The [[Negrito]] migrated from Africa and were among the earliest human beings to settle the Philippines. The first known were the people of the [[Callao Man]] remains. The Negrito population was estimated in 2004 at around 31,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Adelaar|editor1-first=K Alexander|editor2-last=Himmelmann|editor2-first=Nikolaus|title=The Austronesian Languages of Asia and Madagascar|isbn=978-0-7007-1286-1|page=56|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BAShwSYLbUYC&amp;pg=PA56&amp;dq=philippines+Negrito+population&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5V7uU569JaW6ygObsoCgCQ&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=philippines%20Negrito%20population&amp;f=false|accessdate=15 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their tribal groups include the [[Ati people|Ati]], and the [[Aeta]]. Their ways of life remain mostly free from Western and Islamic influences. Scholars study them to try to understand pre-Hispanic culture.

Most Filipinos are related to [[Malay people]], a major family within the [[Malay language]] family. Other ethnolinguistic nations form a minority in the Philippine population. These include those of [[Japanese people|Japanese]], [[Chinese people|Chinese]] particularly the Hokkien and Cantonese, [[Indian people|Indians]] particularly the Punjabi, Tamil and Kerala, [[Ethnic groups in Spain|Spanish]], and other ethnolinguistic nations from other countries. Mixed-race or mixed-ethnicity individuals are known as [[mestizo]].

{{Further|Models of migration to the Philippines}}
A 2008 genetic study showed no evidence of a large-scale Taiwanese migration into the Philippines. The [[Leeds University]] study, published in [[Molecular Biology and Evolution]], showed that [[mitochondrial DNA]] lineages have been evolving within Island Southeast Asia (ISEA) since modern humans arrived approximately 50,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=leeds&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.physorg.com/news130761648.html |title=Climate Change and Postglacial Human Dispersals in Southeast Asia |author=Dr. Martin Richards |publisher=Oxford Journals |accessdate=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no genetic evidence for large-scale population replacement, displacement, or absorption to suggest replacement of preexisting hunting and gathering populations by farming-voyaging immigrants from Taiwan.&lt;ref name="Mark Donohue and Tim Denham"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/650991 |title=Farming and Language in Island Southeast Asia |author=Mark Donohue and Tim Denham |publisher=Chicago Journals |accessdate=2010 |doi=10.1086/650991 |volume=51 |journal=Current Anthropology |pages=223–256}}&lt;/ref&gt; Population dispersals occurred at the same time as sea levels rose, which resulted in migrations from the Philippines to as far north as Taiwan within the last 10,000 years.&lt;ref name=leeds /&gt;

Examination of mitochondrial DNA lineages showed that the neolithic culture (malay) had been evolving within Island Southeast Asia (ISEA) for a longer period than previously believed. Per co-author Dr Oppenheimer, from the Oxford University School of Anthropology, population migrations were most likely to have been driven by climate change—the effects of the drowning of a huge ancient peninsula called [[Sundaland]], that extended the Asian landmass as far as Borneo and Java.&lt;ref name=leeds /&gt;

This happened during the period 15,000 to 7,000 years ago following the [[Last Glacial Maximum|last Ice Age]]. Rising sea levels in three massive pulses caused flooding and the submergence of the Sunda Peninsula, creating the Java and South China Seas and the thousands of islands that make up Indonesia and the Philippines today.&lt;ref name=leeds /&gt;

According to a 2008 study by Mark Donohue of the Australian National University and Tim Denham of Monash University, there is no linguistic evidence for an orderly north-to-south dispersal of the malay languages from Taiwan through the Philippines and into Island Southeast Asia (ISEA).&lt;ref name="Mark Donohue and Tim Denham"/&gt;

The Philippine Statistics Department does not account for the racial background or ancestry of an individual. The official population of all types of mestizos (Asian, American, etc.) that reside inside and outside of the Philippines remains unknown.

==History==
[[File:Callao Cave.jpg|thumb|right|Inside the firth chamber of Callao Cave, where the remains of the Callao Man were discovered.]]
Prehistoric [[Tabon Man]], found in [[Palawan]] in 1962 was, until 2007, the oldest human remains discovered by [[anthropologists]] in the Philippines. [[Archaeological]] evidence indicates similarities with two early human fossils found in Indonesia and China, called the [[Java Man]] and [[Peking Man]]. In 2007, a single [[metatarsal]] from an earlier fossil was discovered in [[Callao Cave]], [[Peñablanca, Cagayan]]. That earlier fossil was named as [[Callao Man]].

The Negritos arrived about 30,000 years ago and occupied several scattered areas throughout the islands.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Recent archaeological evidence described by [[Peter Bellwood]] claimed that the ancestors of Filipinos, Malaysians, and Indonesians first crossed the [[Taiwan Strait]] during the Prehistoric period. These early mariners are thought to be the [[Malay people]]. They used boats to cross the oceans, and settled into many regions of Southeast Asia, the Polynesian Islands, and Madagascar.

By the 14th century, the Malayo-Polynesian ethnolinguistic nations had dominated and displaced the Negrito population in most areas. Traders from southern China, [[Japan]], [[India]], [[Arabia]], Malaysia, and Indonesia, also contributed to the ethnic, and cultural development of the islands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philippinealmanac.com/2010/07/528/the-cultural-influences-of-india-china-arabia-and-japan.html The Cultural Influences of India, China, Arabia, and Japan |Philippine Almanac&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701082957/http://www.philippinealmanac.com/2010/07/528/the-cultural-influences-of-india-china-arabia-and-japan.html |date=July 1, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 16th and 17th centuries, thousands of Japanese people traders also migrated to the Philippines and assimilated into the local population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-I6owJcCOdwC&amp;pg=PA126&amp;dq=Racial%20intimacy%20in%20Japan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KQVvUv6bK_Td4APn14DoCw&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Racial%20intimacy%20in%20Japan&amp;f=false|title=Interracial Intimacy in Japan: Western Men and Japanese Women, 1543-1900|first=Gary P.|last=Leupp|date=26 December 2016|publisher=A&amp;C Black|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; pp.&amp;nbsp;52–3

By the 16th century, [[Spain|Spanish]] colonization brought new groups of people to the Philippines mainly [[Spaniards]], [[Mexicans]] and [[Peruvians]]. Many settled in the Philippines, and intermarried with the indigenous population. This gave rise to the [[Filipino mestizo]] or individuals of mixed Malay and Hispanic descent.

Far more numerous were [[Chinese people|Chinese]] immigrant workers, known as ''[[sangley]]'', as many Chinese historically had been traders. They intermarried with Filipinos, and their children and descendants were called ''mestizo de sangley''. By the 19th century, the more successful among them had risen to become wealthy major landowners. They could afford to have their children educated in elite institutions in the Philippines and Europe.

By the opening of the Suez Canal in the 1800s, the Spanish opened the Philippines for foreign trade. Europeans such as the British, Germans, and French settled in the islands to do business. By the end of the Spanish colonial period, the native ethnic groups of the Philippines began calling themselves Filipinos, a term that had begun as self-identification for persons of Spanish descent born in the Philippines.

Following its victory in the [[Spanish–American War]], the [[United States]] created a colonial authority in the Philippines in 1898. Military troops and businessmen made their way to the country, bringing in new ethnic groups, culture and language. In the late 19th century.

The Philippines has over 180 indigenous ethnic groups, over half of which represent unique linguistic groups.

|Molbog||[[File:Young Ibans, or Sea Dayaks.jpg|220px]]||The Molbog (referred to in the literature as Molebugan or Molebuganon) are concentrated in Balabak island and are also found in other islands of the coast of Palawan as far north as Panakan. The word Malubog means "murky or turbid water". The Molbog are probably a migrant people from nearby North Borneo. Judging from their dialect and some socio-cultural practices, they seem to be related to the [[Tidung people|Orang Tidung]] or Tirum (Camucone in Spanish), an Islamized ethnolinguistic nation native to the lower east coast of [[Sabah]] and upper [[East Kalimantan]].||

However, some Sama words (of the Jama Mapun variant) and Tausug words are found in the Molbog dialect after a long period of exposure with those ethnics. This plus a few characteristics of their socio-cultural life style distinguish them from the Orang Tidung. Molbog livelihood includes subsistence farming, fishing and occasional barter trading with the [[Moro people|Moros]] and neighbouring ethnolinguistic nations in Sabah. In the past, both the Molbog and the Palawanon Muslims were ruled by Sulu datus, thus forming the outer political periphery of the Sulu Sultanate. Intermarriage between Tausug and the Molbog hastened the Islamization of the Molbog. The offsprings of these intermarriages are known as kolibugan or "half-breed".

|Negrito ethnolinguistic nations||[[File:Negrito warriors, Philippines (1899).jpg|220px]]||The [[Negrito]] are several ethnic groups of the [[Australoid race]] who inhabit isolated parts of [[Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref name=snow1989&gt;Snow, Philip.

|Palawan ethnolinguistic nations||||The [[Peoples of Palawan|tribes of Palawan]] are a diverse group of tribes primarily located in the island of [[Palawan]] and its outlying islands. These ethnolinguistic nations are widely distributed to the long strip of mainland island literally traversing Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao.
Palawan is home to many indigenous peoples whose origins date back thousands of centuries. Pre-historic discoveries reveal how abundant cultural life in Palawan survived before foreign occupiers and colonizers reached the Philippine archipelago.
Today, Palawan is making its best to preserve and conserve the richness of its cultural groups. The provincial government strives to support the groups of indigenous peoples of Palawan.

|[[Pala'wan]]||||The Pala'wan are a tribal people found in Southern Palawan particularly [[Quezon, Palawan]].||
|-
|[[Tagbanwa]]||[[File:Tagbanua weaver.jpg|220px]]||The Tagbanwas are found in the western and eastern coastal areas of central Palawan. Their name means "people of the world". They are concentrated in the municipalities of Aborlan, [[Quezon, Palawan|Quezon]] and the city of [[Puerto Princesa]]. Two other ethnic groups called "Tagbanwa" (i.e. the Central Tagbanwa and the Calamian Tagbanwa) are from a different family of languages and should not be confused the Tagnbanwas discussed here. These are found Coron Island, Northern Palawan, Busuanga Island and the Baras coast. The Central Tagbanwa language is dying out as the younger generations are learning Cuyonon and Tagalog.|
|
The Tagbanwas speak the Tagbanwa language and has several sub-dialects. They are able to comprehend Tagalog, and, depending on their proximity to neighboring ethnolinguistic nations, Batak, Cuyonen and Calamian languages. They usually dress like the non-tribal lowlanders. However, elder men prefer to wear [[G-string]] while tilling or fishing. Houses are built from available forest materials. Bamboo and wood are used for the house's frame anahaw leaves are used to create walls and the roof and bamboo slats are used as flooring. Their basic social unit is the nuclear family which is composed of a married couple and their children usually one girl and one boy.
|-
|[[Peoples of Palawan#Taaw't-Bato|Taaw't Bato]]||||The Taaw't Bato's name means "people of the rock". They are not actually a separate language or ethnolinguistic nation, but rather a small community of traditional S.W. Palawanos who happen to reside in the crater of an extinct volcano during certain seasons of the year, in houses built on raised floors inside caves though others have set their homes on the open slopes. They are found in the Singnapan Basin, a valley bounded by [[Mount Mantalingajan]] on the east and the coast on the west. North of them is the municipality of [[Quezon, Palawan]] and to the South are the still unexplored regions of Palawan. ||

As of 1987, their population was about 198. Note that the common-seen spelling "Tau't Bato" or "Tau't Batu" is a misspelling based on the [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] word for "human" (''tao''). The [[Palawano language|Palawano]] word is ''taaw''.
The men of the tribe wear G-strings while the women cover their lower bodies with bark or cloth that is made into a skirt. The upper half is left exposed although some now wear blouses that are bought from the market.

The people practice agriculture with cassava as the major source of carbohydrates. They also plant sweet potatoes, sugarcane, malunggay ([[Moringa oleifera]]), garlic, pepper, string beans, squash, tomatoes and pineapples. Others practice fishing, hunting and industrial arts.
Their social organizations are based on family (kin ties), band (type of substinence activity) and settlement (geographic location).

Accessed 7 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; gave quantitative interpretation backed by statistical evidences showing the changing attitude of organisations in different countries and especially the UK toward flexible working. For example, 50% of companies in the UK started to consider flexible working as a common practice and 73% of the managers in the survey showed an ultimate support to it. On the other hand, employees showed great preference to flexible working to the point that 40% of workers in the UK choose it over salary.&lt;ref&gt;The online recruitment resource, 2015.

Additionally, as seen recently, most business organisations have started to introduce flexible working patterns for their employee as a way to increase their productivity level, increasing profitability. Flexible working is also seen as a family-friendly policy, which leads to a good work life balance for employees. Some examples of organisations with flexible working arrangement include Agilent technologies, NetApp, Qualcomm Inc.&lt;ref&gt;Stanger, M., 2014.

== Empirical evidence ==
Flexible working was academically introduced in 1970&lt;ref&gt;Google Ngram Viewer&lt;/ref&gt; and since then this topic continues to be the interest of many research papers.
For four decades, academic papers have contributed to the increased knowledge and interest in flexible working. A descriptive background of the evolution of the concept of flexibility as well as highlighting the main factors contributed to its growth were the main focus of academic studies.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, A.D., Marler, J.H. &amp; Gueutal, H.G., 2008. Individual differences: Factors affecting employee utilization of flexible work arrangements. Journal of Vocational Behavior, 73 (1), pp.107–117&lt;/ref&gt; Also, they deliver evidence of the significant amount and the ongoing increase in the use of flexible working in many countries.&lt;ref&gt;Brewster, C., Mayne, L. &amp; Tregaskis, O., 1997. Flexible working in Europe. Journal of World Business, 32 (2), pp.133–151&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chung, H.

Studies examining who gets access to flexitime have shown that it is the high skilled/educated workers, in higher occupational jobs, and supervisory roles that are most likely to have access&lt;ref&gt;Chung, H.

(2009) Flexible Daily Work Schedules in US Jobs: Formal Introductions Needed? Industrial Relations: A Journal of Economy and Society 48(1): 27-54. &lt;/ref&gt;. Unlike what many assume, women do not have better access to flexitime arrangements, and female-dominated workplaces have worse access to flexitime compared to workplaces where there are more men or equal number of men and women.&lt;ref&gt; Chung, H. (2018) '[http://journals.sagepub.com/eprint/XuK3U8Uk95pG2Bh3brMH/full Women's Work Penalty' in access to flexible working arrangements across Europe]. European Journal of Industrial Relations. &lt;/ref&gt;
Many studies examine the outcomes of flexible working. For example, a study by Origo and Pagani&lt;ref&gt;Origo, F. &amp; Pagani, L., 2008. Workplace flexibility and job satisfaction: some evidence from Europe. International Journal of Manpower, 29(6), pp.539–566&lt;/ref&gt; based on a sample of European countries, gave a deep analysis of the concept of flexible working by testing the level of heterogeneity in the effect of flexibility on job satisfaction and found some positive link with some aspects of the job while negative or no relation was found against other aspects. There is increasing evidence for the "business case" of flexible working. A meta analysis of studies have shown that flexible working can provide a wide range of benefits for companies, including increase in performance, productivity, and reduction in absenteeism etc.&lt;ref&gt;de Menezes, LM and Kelliher, C. (2011) Flexible Working and Performance: A Systematic Review of the Evidence for a Business Case. International Journal of Management Reviews 13(4): 452-474.&lt;/ref&gt;

Flexible working can both prevent and create opportunities. There is generally a positive relationship between flexible working and perceptions of job quality in term of work-life balance and helping to improve and control autonomy particularly for remote workers, but some factors such as opportunities for advancement will be negatively affected due to the variations on different dimensions of job quality.&lt;ref&gt;Kelliher, C. &amp; Anderson, D., 2008. For better or for worse? An analysis of how flexible working practices influence employees' perceptions of job quality. The International Journal of Human Resource Management, 19 (3), pp.419–431&lt;/ref&gt; Flexible working has also been linked to increased recruitment and retention of workers. Chung and van der Horst&lt;ref&gt;Chung, H. &amp; van der Horst, M., 2018. Women’s employment patterns after childbirth and the perceived access to and use of flexitime and teleworking. Human Relations. Special Issue on Flexible Careers.  71(1): 47-72. http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0018726717713828&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that the use of flexitime significantly reduces the likelihood of mothers decreasing their working hours after childbirth, and reduces the likelihood of first time mothers leaving their work altogether. Flexible employment is one of the vital factor in the European Union policy discourse. It is a mean to reduce unemployment, increase economic and social cohesion, maintain economic competitiveness and enhance equal opportunities between women and men.&lt;ref&gt;Perrons, D., 1999. Flexible Working Patterns and Equal Opportunities in the European Union Conflict or Compatibility? European Journal of International Law Journal of women study. 6 (4), pp.391-418&lt;/ref&gt;
However, flexible working is not without problems. Studies have also shown that flexible working can lead to increase in overtime hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lott|first1=Yvonne|last2=Chung|first2=Heejung|title=Gender Discrepancies in the Outcomes of Schedule Control on Overtime Hours and Income in Germany|journal=European Sociological Review|date=December 2016|volume=32|issue=6|pages=752–765|doi=10.1093/esr/jcw032}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The European Commission ==
In 2017, the [[European Commission]] proposed [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1494929657775&amp;uri=CELEX:52017PC0253 the Directive on Work-Life Balance] which includes the extension of the right to request flexible working arrangements (reduced working hours, flexible working hours and flexibility in place of work) to all working parents of children up to 12 and carers with dependent relatives. It also includes non legislative measures ensuring protection against discrimination and dismissal for parents (including pregnant women and workers coming back from a leave) and carers, and encouraging a gender-balanced use of family-related leaves and flexible working arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1311&amp;langId=en | title=Work-life balance - Employment, Social Affairs &amp; Inclusion - European Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== United Kingdom ==
Haller founded a company in the UK in 1971 and registered the trademark "Flextime", the mark remains the property of that company's successor hfx Ltd.
In spring 2003, 17.7% of men and 26.7% of women were employed with flexitime arrangements in the [[United Kingdom]], ([[Office for National Statistics]] 2003).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/lms/labour-market-trends--discontinued-/volume-111--no--10/key-indicators-of-women-s-position-in-britain.pdf |title=Key indicators of women's position in Britain |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, flexitime working is commonplace in both the [[private sector|private]] and [[public sector|public]] sectors. The practice is often found in [[Administration (business)|administrative]] and back office functions of commercial organisations and [[Local government in the United Kingdom|local councils]].

In 2003, the UK Government introduced legislation&lt;ref name="legal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dti.gov.uk/employment/employment-legislation/employment-guidance/page35662.html |title=UK Department of Trade and Industry employment guidance |publisher=Dti.gov.uk |date=2009-11-06 |accessdate=2012-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; that gave parents of children under 6, or the parents of disabled children under 18, the right in law to request a [[Labour market flexibility|flexible working arrangement]] from their employer. A survey in 2005 by the National Office of Statistics&lt;ref name="A survey in 2005 by the National Office of Statistics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/lms/labour-market-trends--discontinued-/volume-113--no--7/families-and-work.pdf |title=ONS Survey 2005 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that 71% of female workers and 60% of male workers were aware of the rights created under the 2003 legislation. Between 2003 and 2005 more than 14% of all workers had requested a change to flexible working. Since April 2007 the right to request flexible working also applies to carers of adults.

On 13 November 2012 Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg announced plans to extend the right to request flexible working to all employees,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bis.gov.uk/news/topstories/2012/Nov/flexible-parental-leave |title=Reform of flexible parental leave &amp;#124; News |publisher=BIS |date= |accessdate=2012-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; this legislation takes effect in April 2014. Lawyers have suggested that this will lead to "major headaches" for employers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lewissilkin.com/Journal/2012/November/Changing-the-clapped-out-rules-on-flexible-working.aspx|title=Changing the clapped out rules on flexible working|date=2012-11-13|publisher=Lewis Silkin|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102145207/http://www.lewissilkin.com/Journal/2012/November/Changing-the-clapped-out-rules-on-flexible-working.aspx|archivedate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Now being enforced by the law on 30 June 2014, industrial reports concentrate on workers right to request for flexible working and how it is guided by Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS). They explained how this code is designed to help employers, employees and their representatives dealing with disciplinary and grievance situations in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;ACAS, 2009. Disciplinary and grievance procedures, ACAS website. [Online]. Available at: http://www.acas.org.uk/media/pdf/k/b/Acas_Code_of_Practice_1_on_disciplinary_and_grievance_procedures-accssible-version-Jul-2012.pdf. Accessed 7 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shift workers are generally excluded from flextime schemes as are senior managers.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} Other groups of workers for whom flextime arrangements are rare include those who serve the public during specific opening times.

The advantages of Flextime for the individual include a better work-life balance, fewer commutes, less fatigue, more days off, lower sickness rates. The benefits for the company include; better motivated workers, more efficient and effective operation, less fatigued workers, so fewer errors; they get people working [[overtime]] hours without paying overtime rates, fewer facilities required, and lower sickness rates.

For employers, flextime can aid the recruitment and retention of staff. It has been a particularly popular option in 2009 for employers trying to reduce staff costs without having to make redundancies during the recession. It can also help provide staff cover outside normal working hours and reduce the need for overtime. Additionally flextime can also improve the provision of [[equal opportunities]] to staff unable to work standard hours.

Flextime can give employees greater freedom to organize their working lives to suit personal needs. In addition, travelling can be cheaper and easier if it is out of peak time.

== United States ==
In [[Florida]], flextime workers, like [[Wages|salaried workers]], are exempted from [[insurance]] regulations, and are given broad leeway in setting their own work schedule. Unlike exempted salaried workers, employers are still required to pay overtime to a flextime worker if they work more than 40 hours per week.

In recent years, the term "flextime" has acquired a more controversial definition when used to describe proposals to overhaul the nation's overtime regulations. Under one such proposal by the [[George W. Bush|Bush administration]] made public on August 5, 2004, employers would not be required to pay non-exempt employees overtime for working more than 40 hours in a week so long as the employee works no more than 80 hours over a two-week period. For example, a worker could be required to work 70 hours one week and receive no overtime compensation as long as they work 10 hours or less the following week. Such arrangements are opposed by [[trade union]]s such as the [[AFL-CIO]].

In certain industries and disciplines, such as [[information technology]], flextime permits workers to vary their schedule. For example, they may opt to work four 10-hour days per week, taking Monday or Friday off. Another flextime schedule is to work nine-hour days Monday through Thursday, an eight-hour day on Friday, taking every other Friday off. Some agencies of the United States government allow employees to work such a schedule, and designate it as an alternative work schedule (AWS).&lt;ref&gt;FEDweek, ''The 2014 Federal Employees Handbook'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Workers may arrange to coordinate their days off so that their responsibilities are adequately covered.

Other workers may opt simply to come in early, such as 5 or 6 a.m., and leave in the mid-afternoon, or come in late and therefore leave late. One benefit of such a schedule is that commuting times occur outside of the congested [[rush hour]] traffic within a given geographic region. Flextime arrangements also help parents: one parent works 10 a.m – 6 p.m. and is in charge of the children before school / daycare, while the other parent works 7 a.m. – 3 p.m. and is in charge of the children after school / daycare. This allows parents time to commute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Leah |url=http://www.momsrising.org/work |title=O: Open, Flexible Work |publisher=Momsrising |date= |accessdate=2012-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flextime is also beneficial to workers pursuing an education.

It is an ongoing part of the [[work-life balance]] discussions in many companies.

== Australia ==
Flexi-time in Australia is usually referred to accumulated overtime hours that an employee can build up and exchange for the equivalent amount of time off. (Example: Jane works 7 a.m. – 3 p.m. Monday to Friday. Over the past month, Jane has worked 8 hours overtime meaning she is eligible for a paid day off.)

If employees accumulate too many flex hours, they are required to perform a "flex burndown", as they are burning down the flex. Similarly, taking a flex day off is known as "flexing".

It is implemented formally in the federal [[Australian Public Service]] and is available for staff in most state and territory government departments. With current changes to industrial relations laws (2006), from State to Federal level there are no new published guidelines (online) for flexi-time.

== Recording working ==
There are many different methods used for recording working time ranging from [[Comparison of time tracking software|sophisticated software]] (computer programs) to handwritten [[Timesheet|time sheets]]. Most of these methods are associated with the payment of wages in return for hours worked. As a result, they often do not address a fundamental difference of most [[Labour market flexibility|flexible work]]ing systems – namely the intention of flexible working to allow an employee to "trade hours" with their employer in return for a fixed wage ({{Citation

== Millennials ==
"[[Millennial]]" is the name most commonly used to describe those born between 1980 and 2000. As the right to request for flexible working is extended to all by law, many benefits are expected to rise. With "Millennials" becoming the interest of many organisations, flexible working seems to attract them.&lt;ref&gt;BBC, 2014. Flexible working rights extended to all. [Online]. Available at: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-28078690. Accessed 3 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; As ethnic diversity and high level of education are their main characteristics, it is seen that Millennials are more likely to change their jobs more than the previous generation for economic reasons. Additionally, due to the delay in the retirement of baby boomers' generation, gaps in workforce were created, waiting for the Millennial generation to fill them.&lt;ref&gt;Red Tree Leadership &amp; Development, 2012, The Millennial Takeover.

Flexible working is a pattern of working arrangements that enable employees to decide the time, duration, and location of their work.&lt;ref&gt;Fell, S.S., 2013. Top 10 Benefits of Flexible Work Policies for Companies. Available at: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sara-sutton-fell/top-10-benefits-of-flexib_b_4158603.html&lt;/ref&gt; Flexible working patterns have gained the interest of both academics and industrial practitioners for some time,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baltes|first=Boris B.|last2=Briggs|first2=Thomas E.|last3=Huff|first3=Joseph W.|last4=Wright|first4=Julie A.|last5=Neuman|first5=George A.|title=Flexible and compressed workweek schedules: A meta-analysis of their effects on work-related criteria.|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|language=en|volume=84|issue=4|pages=496–513|doi=10.1037/0021-9010.84.4.496|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; with implementation into law in certain countries as far back as 1930, but also in recent years. Existing literature highlights the fundamental importance of flexible working to both academics and organizations as a means of establishing a good work–life balance for employees; work-life balance for employees is theorized to increase employee efficiency, which in turns leads to increase in productivity of the organisation.&lt;ref&gt;Silla, I., 2005. Job Insecurity and Health-Related Outcomes among Different Types of Temporary Workers. Economic and Industrial Democracy, 26(1), pp.89–117&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guest, D., 2004. Flexible employment contracts, the psychological contract and employee outcomes: an analysis and review of the evidence. International Journal of Management Reviews, 5-6(1), pp.1–19&lt;/ref&gt; This would also be suggested from research on the decreasing returns of working hours.[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13504851.2011.558473]

Academic literature has identified benefits of flexible working patterns to employees including [[life satisfaction]], better wellbeing, and overall a good work-life balance,&lt;ref&gt;Stanger, M., 2014. Companies That Offer Flexible Schedules Get More Out Of Their Employees. Available at: http://www.businessinsider.com/most-flexible-employers-according-to-payscale-2013-1&lt;/ref&gt; but some researchers argue that although there are such benefits, there are some negative effect such as work intensity, job insecurity associated with flexible working arrangement. Research works such as Evans et al., (2000) also highlight that flexible working pattern may not be applicable to all occupational fields, the authors also heighted the medical profession as one of such fields.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, J., Goldacra, M. &amp; Lambert, T., 2000. Views of UK medical graduates about ¯ exible and part-time working in medicine : a qualitative study. , pp.355–362&lt;/ref&gt; A further critique is that some patterns of work deemed "flexible" such as a compressed work week may be put forward by the employer, rather than suiting the individual employee, and thus may not capture the same benefits as employee-chosen flexible working.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=E|first=Hyatt|last2=E|first2=Coslor|date=2018|title=Compressed Lives: How "Flexible" are Employer-Imposed Compressed Work Schedules|journal=Personnel Review|volume=47|issue=2|pages=278–293|url=https://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/handle/11343/191878|language=en|doi=10.1108/PR-08-2016-0189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Industrial sources also have been able to highlight one of the positive effects of flexible working patterns as being able to attract highly qualified professionals, but Brookins&lt;ref&gt;Brookins, M., 2015. Negatives of Flexible Work Schedules. Available at: http://smallbusiness.chron.com/negatives-flexible-work-schedules-1236.html&lt;/ref&gt; established some negative effects flexible working patterns had to employers as it adds expenses and responsibility on the organisation, negative availability perspectives of employees on the customers, and employee availability.{{better source|date=December 2015}}

Both academics and industrial sources were established that in some professions flexible working arrangement may not be available or its availability will have a negative perspective on employees by others with a non-flexible arrangement, example of such profession is the medical profession. The researcher done by Evans et al., (2000) on flexible working patterns in the medical profession emphasized how some medical doctors may attributes negative perception with colleagues with flexible working pattern. In 1930, Employees in the United Kingdom were given the right to request for flexible working arrangement, but there was no instructions or guideline on the way for this would work. Flexible working concept is also a relatively new form of working arrangement and this has limited its application in other parts of the world such as some region in Africa.

Flexible working patterns is a working arrangement that enable employees to determine the duration, time and location of their work. It has been seen both by academics and industrial sources to have benefit sure as increase of work-life balance for employee, which in turns leads to increase in productivity for the employer or organisation. Organisations hoping to adopt this form of working pattern for its employee should conduct research on how flexible working pattern can be successfully conducted, thus avoiding some of the expenses and pitfalls existing research has linked to flexible working practices.

== Flexible working time accounts ==
Flexible working time accounts is also known as deposited working-time accounts or work bank account system. It is derived from the German Federal Labor Government's reform program, which was passed by the German Federal Government on August 21, 2002. Then Federal Chancellor, [[Gerhard Schröder]], announced that the program will invite the former director of human resources management of Volkswagen company, Peter Hartz, chaired the Labour Market Reform Committee. This program's goal is to make the rigidity of the labor system more flexible and to change the old social welfare policy, in order to lighten heavy financial burden.&lt;ref name="cw.com.tw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cw.com.tw/article/article.action?id=5027075#sthash.hpea61Yo.dpuf|title=德國 十年變革，重回第一｜國際｜2011-10-04｜天下雜誌第482期|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Definitions===
The concept of flexible working time accounts is to establish labor-self accounts, and labors can save their working hours, just like saving money, into their own accounts. The working hours in their accounts are their assets, so that employers and workers both sides can increase or decrease the work required by each other without affecting the salaries and welfare. While achieving the purpose of flexible labor, and the account-system may be short-term, long or permanent (life-time) of the convention.&lt;ref name="cw.com.tw"/&gt;

===Characteristics===
Flexible working time accounts system has the following four characteristics
&lt;ref&gt;file:///C:/Users/%E4%B9%99%E7%94%AF/Downloads/994307002%20(1).pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

# Flexible working time accounts shall be calculated for at least the period of one year.
# The calculation of long-term account system is usually based on time and money, occasionally there may be passed on from other labors' accounts, the situation is only applicable to short-term working time.
# When using long-term working time accounts, there are two features can be used to classify:
## Optional long-term accounts &lt;br/&gt; Most using of optional long-term accounts occur in the period that labors are still holding a post in their own company, labors can withdraw from accounts after negotiating between employers and labors, usually due to labors'personally needs.
## Aged-related long-term accounts &lt;br/&gt; Aged-related long-term accounts can be used when labors'career get mature, preparing of early retirement. semi-retirement, or preparation of retirement.
# Unlike the short-term account system, there is the lowest limit standard of withdrawing hours, however, the setting of standard is according to different demand of labors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3467">'''François-Philippe Charpentier''' (b. [[Blois]], 1734; d. there 22 July 1817) was a French [[engraver]] and inventor. 

His father was a bookbinder, a poor man who reportedly made many sacrifices so that his son might attend the [[Jesuit]] college at Blois; but after young Charpentier had studied there a few years he was compelled to leave and work to support himself. He chose to pursue the art of engraving, and entered the [[wikt:atelier|atelier]] of a copperplate engraver in Paris. He made a number of inventions related to this field, the first being a purely mechanical process for engraving in [[aquatint]] (''gravure au lavis'') and in colour. After making many prints using the technique, he sold the secret. An engraver and patron of art, the Comte de Caylus, was one of the first to use the new machine.

[[Louis XVI]] gave him the appointment of "Royal Mechanician" (Mécanicien du Roi), and provided a studio for him in the gardens of the [[Louvre]], where he used a burning-mirror for melting metals without fire. He invented a fire-engine which was very widely adopted and, in 1771, a machine for drilling metals. Another invention for [[mechanical engraving]] was one which enabled lace-manufacturers to engrave in a few hours elaborate patterns and designs which formerly had required at least six months work of the [[Burin (engraving)|burin]]. Charpentier's device for lighthouse-illumination so pleased Louis XVI that he offered the inventor a pension and a place as the head of the Department of Beacons, asking him to fix the price for his discovery. Charpentier reportedly refused the pension and suggested that the office be given to a younger man, saying that he would "prefer freedom in order to devote himself to the development of his ideas". He received a thousand crowns for his discovery.

During the period of the [[French Directory]] he made an instrument for boring six gun-barrels at once, and a machine to saw six boards simultaneously. For these the government paid him 24,000 francs and named him director of the Atelier de prefectionnement, established at the Hôtel Montmorency. Charpentier received many offers from Russia and England for his labour-saving devices, but refused them all. He died as he had lived, in poverty. His chief extant works of his, all prints, are: ''Education of the Virgin'', after [[François Boucher]]; ''Death of Archimedes'', after [[Ciro Ferri]]; ''Shepherdess'', after Nicolaes Berchem; ''Descent from the Cross'', in colour, after Vanloo.

Charpentier was the father of the sculptor [[Julie Charpentier]].&lt;ref name="RoyalistsRomantics"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Royalists to Romantics: Women Artists from the Louvre, Versailles, and Other French National Collections.|last=National Museum of Women in the Arts, Washington D.C.|first=|publisher=Scala Publishers Limited|year=2012|isbn=9781857597431|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gayo''' people are an [[ethnic group]] living in the [[Highland (landform)|highland]]s of [[Aceh]] Province, [[Sumatra]], [[Indonesia]]. The Gayo tribe has a population of 336,856 and they live predominantly in the mountains. Most Gayo live in three [[Regency (Indonesia)|regencies in Aceh]] namely [[Bener Meriah Regency|Bener Meriah]], [[Central Aceh Regency|Central Aceh]], and [[Gayo Lues Regency|Gayo Lues]]. Some of them live in several [[Districts of Indonesia|district]]s in other regencies, such as [[Serbejadi|Serbejadi District]], [[Simpang Jernih|Simpang Jernih District]], and [[Peunaron|Peunaron District]] in [[East Aceh Regency]] and [[Beutong|Beutong District]] in [[Nagan Raya|Nagan Raya Regency]]. Other than that, the Gayo population also covers [[Southeast Aceh Regency]] and [[Aceh Tamiang Regency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Muhammad Junus Melalatoa|title=Memahami Aceh Sebuah Perspektif Budaya dalam Aceh|year=2006|publisher=Aceh Kembali ke Masa Depan anthology, IKJ Press|page=14|isbn=979-3778-27-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their homeland lies in the [[Barisan Mountains]] which has elevations of over 12,000 feet and extends more than one thousand miles. The [[Gayo language|Gayonese language]] has four dialects: Lut, Serbejadi-Lukup, Lut and Luwes. Their language does not have a writing system, but folk tales, stories and poetry are passed down in oral tradition. The traditional house of the Gayo is called ''[[Umah (Gajo house)|Umah]]''.

==History==
In the 11th century, the Linge Kingdom was established by the Gayo people during the reign of Sultan Makhdum Johan Berdaulat Mahmud Syah from the Perlak Sultanate, as it was told by two rulers who were ruling during the [[Dutch East Indies]] era; namely Raja Uyem and his son Raja Ranta, who is Raja Cik Bebesen, and also Zainuddin from the rulers of Kejurun Bukit. Raja Linge I is said to have four children. The eldest was his daughter, Empu Beru or Datu Beru, and the remaining are Sebayak Lingga (Ali Syah), Meurah Johan (Johan Syah) and Meurah Lingga (Malamsyah). Sebayak Lingga wandered off to Karo land and founded a country there and he was known as Raja Lingga Sibayak. Meurah Johan ventured on to [[Aceh Besar Regency|Aceh Besar]] and established his kingdom by the name of Lam Krak or Lam Oeii or also known as Lamuri or [[Lamuri Sultanate]]. This would mean that the [[Lamuri Sultanate]] was founded by Meurah Johan, while Meurah Lingga who was living in Linge, Gayo and the rest became kings of Linge for generations. Meurah Silu migrated to [[Pasai]] and became an officer to the [[Samudera Pasai Sultanate|Pasai Sultanate]] there. Meurah Mege himself was buried in Wih Ni Rayang at the slopes of Keramil Paluh in Linge, [[Central Aceh]], which until today it can still be found and are considered sacred by the locals. The cause of migrating was unknown. However, according to history, Raja Linge favoured his youngest son, Meurah Mege, causing the rest of his children to prefer to wander away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Muhammad Junus Djamil|title=Gadjah Putih|year=1959|publisher=Lembaga Kebudayaan Atjeh|oclc=762157637}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linga dynasty===
* Adi Genali Raja Linge I in Gayo.
** Raja Sebayak Lingga became King of Karo in Karo land.
** Raja Merah Johan, founded the [[Lamuri Sultanate]].
** Merah Silu, son of Merah Sinabung, founded [[Samudera Pasai Sultanate]].
* Raja Linge II also known as Marah Lingga in Gayo.
* Raja Lingga III to XII in Gayo.
* Raja Lingga XIII became Amir al-Harb of [[Aceh Sultanate]]. In 1533, the new [[Johor Empire]] was founded in pre-independence [[Malaysia]] led by Sultan Alauddin Mansyur Syah. Raja Lingga XIII was appointed to be in the cabinet of the new government. His descendants established the [[Lingga Sultanate]] in [[Lingga Island]] of the [[Riau Islands]], and his sovereignty extended to [[Riau Province]] ([[Indonesia]]), [[Temasek]] ([[Singapore]]) and parts of [[Malay Peninsula|Malaya]] ([[Malaysia]]).

No documentation were recorded on the rulers of Sebayak Lingga Karo. During the era of [[Dutch East Indies]], the monarchy was appointed again but for two eras only.
* Raja Sendi Sibayak Lingga, as chosen by the [[Dutch East Indies]].
* Raja Kalilong Sibayak Lingga

===Dutch colonization===
After initial Dutch resistance, which many Gayonese and [[Dutch people|Dutch]] were killed, the Dutch occupied the area during 1904–1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=M.H. Gayo|title=Perang Gayo-Alas Melawan Kolonial Belanda|year=1983|publisher=Balai Pustaka|oclc=568161081}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, the Gayonese developed a thriving [[cash crop]] economy in vegetables and coffee. Since the Dutch colonization, the Gayonese have gained access to higher levels of education, and participated to some degree in the Islamization and modernization of their homeland.&lt;ref name="joshuaproject"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://joshuaproject.net/people_groups/11837/ID |title=Gayo in Indonesia |publisher=[[Joshua Project]] |accessdate=2016-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surnames==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Gezicht in de versterkte kampong Lahat met vermoorde inwoners na de inname door de marechaussee tijdens de tocht naar de Gajo- en Alaslanden onder leiding van overste Van Daalen TMnr 60011256.jpg|thumb|300px|Villagers of Lahat killed by the ''[[Gendarmerie|Korps Marechaussee te Voet]]'' during the so-called Gayo-Alas expedition of 1904 led by colonel G. C. E. van Daalen.]]

Although it is not the practice of majority of Gayo society to have their surnames included, however there are a small group of them that still have their surnames attached to their given name especially those that are from Bebesen region. The purpose of the surname is only for them be identify and to be able to trace the individual's family lineage, thus it is not regarded as of great importance for the Gayo people. Gayo surnames are such as:-
* Ariga
* Cibero
* Linge
* Melala
* Munte
* Tebe
* Alga
* Uken
* Bukit
** Bukit eweh
** Bukit lah
* Jongok
* Gunung
* Kala

===Religion===
The Gayonese practise a local form of [[Islam]]. It is worth mentioning that the first Sultan of Aceh Darussalam was a Gayonese: Sultan Johan Alam Syah bin Adi Genali. In ancient times, the Gayonese believed in good and bad spirits and in holy men, both dead and alive. They would regularly give ritual offerings and sacrifices to the spirits, to holy men, and to their ancestors.&lt;ref name="joshuaproject" /&gt;

Cultural, religious and political, and various other differences among Iranians reflect their diverse social and interpersonal interactions. Some studies suggest that, despite the existence of subgroup within Iranian immigrants (e.g. various ethno-religious groups), their nationality as Iranians has been an important point of reference and identifiable source of their identification as a group across time and setting.}}&lt;/ref&gt; that, in the [[Western world]], [[Name of Iran|Iran]] was known as "Persia". On the [[Nowruz]] of 1935, [[Reza Shah Pahlavi]] asked foreign delegates to use the term '''Iran''', the [[endonym]] of the country used since the [[Sasanian Empire]], in formal correspondence. Since then the use of the word "Iran" has become more common in the Western countries. This also changed the usage of the terms for Iranian nationality, and the common adjective for citizens of Iran changed from "Persian" to "Iranian". In 1959, the government of [[Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi]], Reza Shah Pahlavi's son, announced that both "Persia" and "Iran" could officially be used interchangeably.&lt;ref name="yarshater1"&gt;Yarshater, Ehsan [http://www.iran-heritage.org/interestgroups/language-article5.htm Persia or Iran, Persian or Farsi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101024033230/http://www.iran-heritage.org/interestgroups/language-article5.htm |date=2010-10-24 }}, ''Iranian Studies'', vol.

There is a tendency among Iranian-Canadians to categorize themselves as "Persian" rather than "Iranian", mainly to dissociate themselves from the [[Islamic Republic of Iran|Islamic regime of Iran]] which is in charge since [[1979 Revolution]] and the negativity associated with it, and also to distinguish themselves as being of [[Persian people|Persian ethnicity]], which comprise about 65% of Iran's population.&lt;ref name="Daha" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BozorgMehr"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bozorgmehr|first=Mehdi|editor1=Mary C.

'''Jeff Donaldson''' (1932 – 2004) was a [[Visual arts|visual artist]] whose work helped define the [[Black Arts Movement]] of the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/feb/24/jeff-donaldson-art-kravets-wehby-gallery|title=The vital protest art of Jeff Donaldson: 'He stood up for what he believed in'|last=Sayej|first=Nadja|date=2017-02-24|website=The Guardian|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donaldson, co-founder of [[AfriCOBRA]] and contributor to the momentous [[Wall of Respect]], was a pioneer in [[African Americans|African-American]] personal and academic achievement. His art work is known for creating alternative black [[iconography]] connected to [[Africa]] and rooted in struggle, in order to replace the history of demeaning [[Stereotype|stereotypes]] found in mainstream white culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hyperallergic.com/367724/jeff-donaldson-kravets-wehby-gallery-2017/|title=Jeff Donaldson’s Celebration of an Alternative History|last=Yau|first=John|date=2017-03-26|work=Hyperallergic Magazine|access-date=2018-01-17|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the midst of the racial and cultural turmoil of the 1960s, a group of African-American artists endeavored to relate its artwork to the black masses. Aiming to use art for social impact, artists such as Donaldson strived to create an "art for the people"—an art form that was recognizable by and directed toward the common black folk, rather than a group of well-educated elite.&lt;ref name="Van Deburg 1997"&gt;Van Deburg, William L., ed. ''Modern Black Nationalism: From Marcus Garvey to Louis Farrakhan''. New York and London: New York University Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Within his works and collaborative efforts, Donaldson essentially became the father of a new, uniting aesthetic—transAfricanism.

Within [[AfriCOBRA]], it was Donaldson’s idea to synthesize an all-encompassing transnational aesthetic—to, in effect, collaborate internationally to unify the then-fragmented concept of black art. The result of such unification would usher in a deeper understanding on the behalf of the African diasporic masses concerning its identity as a people. Having been displaced from their native lands and transplanted into foreign locations, members of the African diaspora grasped onto the only thing that remained of their lost identity—the fact that they descended from Africa, and that they were removed thence. Thus, ironically, the very factor which disowned the African diasporic peoples of their past identities became the fabric of their new self-concepts. The uniting efforts of Donaldson and AfriCOBRA not only furthered this sense of transnational identity among the diaspora, but gave it visibility, making it "official", in a way. As Donaldson described, "One rarely sees a black human-interest story [in the newspaper]” and of television, “not a single one of the new programs celebrates the beauty and dignity of black life style."&lt;ref name="Van Deburg 1997" /&gt; Thus, he endeavored to put the true nature of blacks into the forefront—to give it an up-front face and therefore a recognized existence.

== History ==
Jeffrey Richardson Donaldson was born on December 15, 1932 in [[Pine Bluff]], [[Arkansas]] to Clementine Frances Richardson Donaldson and Sidney Frank Donaldson Sr.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=7484|title=Jeffrey Richardson (Jeff) Donaldson (1932–2004)|last=|first=|date=|website=Encyclopedia of Arkansas|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended Merrill High School in [[Pine Bluff, Arkansas|Pine Bluff]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He received a B.A. in Studio Art from the [[University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff]] in 1954, the college’s first studio art major.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  He worked for a year at [[Lanier High School (Jackson, Mississippi)|Lanier High School]], establishing an arts program for black students then was drafted into the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] for service.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Donaldson went on to complete his M.F.A. at the [[IIT Institute of Design|Institute of Design of the Illinois Institute of Technology of Chicago]] in 1963. In 1974, Donaldson earned the degree of Ph.D. from [[Northwestern University]], becoming the first African American to do so in the nation.&lt;ref name="Gaither"&gt;Gaither, E. B. "Jeff Donaldson: The mind behind the cultural revolution (Organization of Black American Culture)". ''International Review of African American Art'', 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the chairman of [[Howard University]] beginning in 1970, Donaldson used his influence to revolutionize the curricula of the [[Africa|African]] and African-American art history majors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He broadened the narrowly defined concept of art to include its other, less mainstream facets, causing its most dedicated pupils to view it with a new respect and significance. Art came to be interpreted by these students as something that could take multiple and unique forms, as well as something that carried with it a social meaning.&lt;ref name="Gaither"/&gt; Thanks to his influence, the art program at Howard University become world-renowned.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Michael D. "Dedication to Jeff Donaldson, 15 December 1932 to 29 February 2004". ''The International Review of African American Art'', vol. 19, no. 3, 2004: 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

== AfriCobra and the TransAfrican aesthetic ==
Donaldson’s arguably most significant impact on African diasporic art history was born with the formation of the groundbreaking group of which he was cofounder—AfriCOBRA. Originally called Coalition of Black Revolutionary Artists (COBRA), the group later renamed itself [[AfriCOBRA|African Commune of Bad Relevant Artists]] (AfriCOBRA), a designation that held significance for several reasons. The name incorporated "Afri", which could refer both to the up-and-coming African-American hairstyle, the “afro”, as well as the collective heritage of all of the group members as African Americans. Thus, the inclusion of "Afri" intentionally distinguished the group from just any other collection of artists—indeed, even branded them with a unique and reputable purpose. The daughter group of OBAC endeavored to create a "celebratory art", as Donaldson phrased it.&lt;ref name=Donaldson&gt;Donaldson, Jeff R., "AfriCobra and TransAtlantic Connections". ''Seven Stories about Modern Art in Africa'', 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; However, beyond creating an art that would champion the African American as the victor, this commune invented an art intended for the masses, and whether intentionally or not, pushed this community art beyond the edges of "sea to shining sea", in effect establishing one of the first ever international art forms.

Donaldson coined a term to describe the unifying phenomenon that he helped to produce, calling it "a 'transAfrican' style or movement".&lt;ref name=Donaldson /&gt; He described this incredible development as it was occurring worldwide, noting that "unrelated groups of artists [around the world]… have issued manifestoes…[defining] the transAfrican style/movement."&lt;ref name=Donaldson /&gt; AfriCOBRA, under Donaldson’s influence, was pivotal in the definition and support of the transAfrican movement by means of the various international and national conferences it both organized and participated in. Donaldson also coined the term "superreal". Superreal was used to describe the black/"transAfrican" aesthetic as practiced by AfriCOBRA: art that fills up, adds to, and exceeds reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= The Freedom Principle: Experiments in Art and Music, 1965 to Now|last= Beckwith and Roelstraete|first =Naomi and Dieter|publisher= The University of Chicago Press|year= 2015|isbn = 9780226319308|location= Chicago and London|page = 103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1970, the [[Chicago]]-based AfriCOBRA joined "'over 100 artists, art historians and educators, art consultants and critics…from across the country'" in order to consolidate their collective visions into one coherent directional plan for the future of African-American art.&lt;ref name=Donaldson /&gt; The conference, called CONFABA (Conference on the Functional Aspects of Black Art) was initiated by Donaldson and took place at [[Northwestern University]] in [[Evanston, Illinois]]. One result of this conference was the mutual influence and inspiration of one [[African diaspora|African diasporic]] artist on another, as artists fed off of each other’s creative styles and ideas. Donaldson mentioned the "spiritually uplift[ing]" influence of African-American artist [[Skunder Boghossian|Boghossia]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;n on the entire group of AfriCOBRA.&lt;ref name=Donaldson /&gt;

A few years later, Donaldson headed the [[North America|North American]] committee of [[FESTAC 77|Second World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture]] (FESTAC), the “largest [[Pan-Africanism|pan-African]] cultural event ever held” as its chairman.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Michael D. "Dedication to Jeff Donaldson, 15 December 1932 to 29 February 2004". ''The International Review of African American Art'', vol. 19 no. 3, 2004: 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The international festival took place in 1977 in [[Lagos|Lagos, Nigeria]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Other international and national conferences ensued, resulting in what Donaldson referred to as "an informal international coterie of creative people of [[Black people|African descent]]."&lt;ref name=Donaldson /&gt; The significance of this new artistic cadre, knit together through the fibers of similar interests, talents and most importantly, visions of influence and change was that it provided African-American artists with a collective mission: to celebrate those of African descent as intelligent, talented, beautiful, hardworking, and as conquerors.

== TransAfrican style in art ==
According to Donaldson, the transAfrican style is characterized by "high energy colour, rhythmic linear effects, flat patterning, form-filled composition and picture plane compartmentalization."&lt;ref name=Donaldson /&gt; These characteristics are conveyed in his collective work, as with the groups OBAC and AfriCOBRA. Distinguished AfriCOBRA member, [[Barbara Jones-Hogu]], wrote how the works called for "bright vivid singing Cool-ade colors of orange, strawberry, cherry, lemon, lime and grape...using syncopated, rhythmic repetition that constantly changes in color, texture, shapes, form, pattern, and feature."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Inaugurating AfriCOBRA History, Philosophy and Aesthetics|last = Jones-Hogu|first = Barbara|date = Spring 2012|journal = Nka: Journal of Contemporary African Art|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking the famous Wall of Respect for example, it possesses a character of vibrancy, achieved with the use of bright, flashy colors and bold patterns. Cool green and dark blue contrast with the warm oranges, crimsons and yellows to create an eye-catching, visually stimulating work. The contrasts made within the bold color palette, especially on the bottom half of the work, come together in such a way that reflects Donaldson’s concept of "picture plane compartmentalization", while the rhythmic aspect of the style is reflected in the jazz instruments. This motion is also shown in the fluid strokes of yellow behind the political heads in the upper left corner. True to its cause, the mural depicts African Americans as champions, displaying the heads and figures of the diaspora’s most successful and highly regarded members.

The transAfrican style was manifest in Donaldson’s individual work as well, as is demonstrated in the 1971 piece entitled ''Victory in the Valley of Eshu''. The work depicts an elderly black couple holding what appears to be an eye-shaped [[Pinwheel (toy)|pinwheel]]. The pinwheel is actually an "African American symbol of freedom, the six-legged star".&lt;ref name=Okediji&gt;Okediji, Moyosore Benjamin. "Semioptics of Anamnesia: Yoruba Images in the Works of Jeff Donaldson, Howardena Pindell, and  Muneer Bahauddeen". Diss. University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1995. Ann Arbor: UMI, 1995. AAT 9527112.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to displaying national diasporic symbols, ''Victory in the Valley of Eshu'' incorporates many elements of traditional African culture, paying homage to the common heritage of diaspora members. The work is filled with [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] and traditional African references, including the Yoruba Sango dance wand in the right hand of the man, references to deified ancestors (a Yoruba belief), the name "Esu", who is the Yoruba god of fate, and others.&lt;ref name=Okediji /&gt; The newly prominent element of “shine”, an aesthetic effect mimicking or displaying physical shine in order to reflect the bright, star-like quality of ordinary African Americans, is visible in this piece. This effect achieves the "celebration" aspect of black art: an art that, as stated by Donaldson, "define[s], glorif[ies], and direct[s] black people—an art for the people’s sake."&lt;ref name="Van Deburg 1997"/&gt; The notion of "shine" that is conveyed through the collection of small dots of color in the figures’ hair and surrounding their bodies. Additionally, the afros of the couple seem to mimic halos. These elements, in combination with the couple’s bright white clothing, complete the celebration of the ordinary in this African diasporic work. The little splotches and dots of color seem to emanate from the bodies and to dance their way around the edges of the portrait, conveying that notion of a rhythmic motion which was integral in transAfrican work.

Donaldson explicitly stated the need for an "emotional intensity" in TransAfrican work, which would be achieved through a musical/rhythmic feel or representation.&lt;ref name=Donaldson /&gt; This notion is only hinted at in ''Victory in the Valley of Eshu''. However, it is clearly evident in Donaldson’s later work, [http://africa.si.edu/exhibits/dialogue/donaldI.htm JamPact JelliTite (for Jamila)]. This piece, created in 1988, carries with it the notion of "shine", only now in the form of dancing squares, diamonds and zig-zags of color. The popular abstract style of the late 20th century is apparent in his work, and there is a clear shift from the humanistic and realistic forms to geometric shapes and lines. The geometric shapes, however, along with the bustling activity, bright colors, and concentric circles, combine to endow the work with a traditional, almost tribal African feel. The energetic movement of the piece is compounded by the musical and rhythmic themes that dominate the work. Partially hidden elements of jazz music, displayed in the bass player, the singer, and the pianist can be traced within the painting.

Notably, there has been a shift within Donaldson’s works in both style and means of communicating transAfrican themes, especially those of rhythm. This shift has been away from traditional references to traditional African art (Yoruba images), concrete images of blacks in power, and the glorification of the black body and black lifestyle. Instead, transAfrican images have more recently been conveyed in geometric shapes and rhythmic motion that reflect traditional African rhythms and motions. This shift in transAfrican style within Donaldson’s work was paralleled by a shift in the collective work of members of the African diaspora. The change has generally been one in which one unified group aesthetic is no longer prevalent. In other words, while transAfrican art still maintains its general themes in an overarching community, fewer stylistically singular group efforts are being pursued, as was the case with the Wall of Respect. Donaldson noted this change, and reflected that the broadening geographic diversity within the African diasporic art movement has "greatly increased contacts with other Africentric artists in the various cities, thereby intensifying individual expression within the context of unity."&lt;ref name=Donaldson /&gt; As time progressed from the idealistic era of CONFABA, transAfrican art became more and more difficult to define. Perhaps the notion of "transAfrican" art—or an art that would encompass all of African history, as well as the history of the African diaspora—was too ambitious a goal, one that is nearly impossible to fulfill while maintaining the integrity of each facet of African art. The lofty goal of this all-encompassing, unified art form seems to be fading. It was noted recently that "geographical dispersal [of artists of the African diaspora] has reduced gatherings of the entire membership [of the international conferences of diasporic artists] to twice a year."&lt;ref name=Donaldson /&gt; Perhaps the diaspora is simply too large and diverse for such a unification to persist, or perhaps the transAfrican art form has already been established, and its former creators, having established their community, are now seeking forms of individual expression.

Even if the transAfrican aesthetic is fading, its impact on the international African diaspora was monumental, and the creation of this aesthetic gave members of the diaspora everywhere a visibility that they had previously lacked in their unspoken and invisible unity. This in turn provided them with greater authority as a recognized unity of people. By means of his transAfrican style and community-oriented artwork, Jeff Donaldson showed members of the African diaspora that they were indeed an independent, able people who were not to be perpetually confined to the role of the conquered. Donaldson’s work instigated the first with a communal effort to represent a global African art culture/aesthetic, and the legacy and impact of his efforts are indelible.

Before signing on with the ''Daily Record'', Hague was the public relations director and public address announcer for the [[Jersey Indians]], a Class AA located in his hometown of Jersey City, in the summer of 1978, where he watched future Hall of Famer [[Rickey Henderson]] play on a daily basis.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==''Hudson Dispatch''==
In September 1986, Hague joined the staff of the ''[[Hudson Dispatch]]'' in [[Union City, New Jersey]]. where he remained until that paper's demise in April 1991. During his stint at the ''Hudson Dispatch'', eventually becoming one of the paper's most known sports columnists, Hague won several [[New Jersey Press Association]] and [[North Jersey Press Club]] awards. Hague also became known for his coverage of the [[Meadowlands Grand Prix]], the Indy car race held in the parking lot of the [[Meadowlands Sports Complex]], and was recognized nationally for his coverage.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In 1991, Hague became the first-ever sports columnist for the ''Hudson Reporter'' newspaper chain, where he has also garnered several awards. He remains with the newspaper chain today.

==''Star-Ledger''==
Hague spent 12 years working for Dorf Feature Services, providing stories for ''[[The Star-Ledger]]'' of Newark. During his days there, Hague covered the [[New York Knicks]] and [[New Jersey Nets]], compiled the information for the Ledger's High School Football Team of the Century (1999) and covered a variety of sports.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Current career==
In 2005, Hague's first book, ''Braddock: The Rise of the Cinderella Man'', was published by Chamberlain Brothers, a subsidiary of Penguin Books. The book, written about former heavyweight boxing champion [[James J. Braddock]], was published in England and in Italy and appeared on the best seller list in Italy in August that year.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In 2007, Hague returned to his roots as he returned to the ''Daily Record'', covering high school football, cross country, indoor track, hockey and golf.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Since 2004, Hague has been the public address announcer for both Rutgers-Newark and [[New Jersey Institute of Technology]] sporting events. Hague also writes a weekly Athlete of the Week feature for the Rutgers-Newark athletic website.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

'''Korkmaz Yiğit'''  (born 1943, [[Erzincan]]) is a [[Turkey|Turkish]] [[businessman]]. He made his fortune in construction, and expanded into finance and media, but fell rapidly from grace in 1998 when apparent connections with mob figure [[Alaattin Çakıcı]] were revealed. 

==Career==
After making his fortune in construction, Yiğit sought to move into finance in the mid-1990s. He bid in the privatization tender for [[Etibank]], and after this was unsuccessful bought [[Bankekspres]] from [[Doğuş Holding]] for $100m in March 1997.&lt;ref name=bankexspres/&gt;

In 1998 he acquired private television stations [[Kanal E]] and [[Tele 4]], and then [[Kanal 6]] (the latter for $110m). In August 1998 he bought the ''[[Ateş (newspaper)|Ateş]]'' and ''[[Yeni Yüzyıl]]'' newspapers  ($75m),&lt;ref name="hdn1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hdn2"/&gt; and in early October he acquired control of ''[[Milliyet]]'' ($300m).&lt;ref name="hdn3"/&gt;

In August 1998, he had won the privatization tender for the majority of [[Türk Ticaret Bankası]], with a $600m bid,&lt;ref name="hdn4"/&gt; but after apparent connections with mob figure [[Alaattin Çakıcı]] were revealed in October, known as the "[[Türkbank scandal]]", the deal was put on hold on 14 October pending a parliamentary inquiry.&lt;ref name=crisis/&gt; The [[Doğan Media Group]] bought back ''Milliyet'' on 22 October.&lt;ref name=crisis/&gt; [[Bankekspres]] was seized by the government for a symbolic TL1bn.&lt;ref name=bankexspres/&gt; Yiğit was jailed pending trial, accused of conspiracy in the Turkbank privatization and of defrauding Bankekspres.&lt;ref name="hdn5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hdn6"/&gt;

In 2007 the government's [[TMSF]] took some of Yiğit's companies in part-payment of debts owed.&lt;ref name="tz1"/&gt;

[[File:Kanera.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A typical Kanera Tribesman in 1928]]

The '''Kunara Khel''' or '''Kanera Khel''' are a [[Baloch people|Baloch]] tribe, sub tribe of Azam Khel clan, which is a major clan of Lashari tribe. Azam Khel and Kundo Khel had been migrated to Mianwali District after the [[Baloch civil wars|Baloch civil war]] in Balochistan. They are a branch from the main Baluchi tribe. The Kunara tribe living in [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], [[Dera Ismail Khan]], speak [[Saraiki dialect|Siraiki]] as their first laungage.

The grandfather of Kanera tribe had got married from Jat tribe and his family refused to accept this marriage. So Kanera went to Jat tribe and take shelter there and used to live with them. The Kanera tribes were Jatt by profession (Jatt are the one who keep camels and goats), so these are the two reasons that some people considered Kanera from Jat tribe.

The Kanera Khel (clan) has sub-clans such as the Buqa, Dilay, Jamaal, Kalu, Belay, Sidiqu, Saleh, Golay, Rehman and Hazoor. Kanera tribe was using trade of camels for the source of income in the early days. They were purchasing camels from Baluchistan and were selling in KPK &amp; Punjab.

'''Limousin''' ({{lang-oc|Lemosin}}) is a dialect of the [[Occitan language]], spoken in the three [[Departments of France|departments]] of [[Limousin (region)|Limousin]], parts of [[Charente]] and the [[Dordogne]] in the southwest of [[France]].

The first Occitan documents are in an early form of this dialect, particularly the ''[[Boecis]]'', written around the year 1000.

Limousin is used primarily by people over age 50 in rural communities. All speakers speak [[French language|French]] as a first or second language. Due to the [[Language policy in France|French single language policy]], it is not recognised by the government and might be disappearing. A [[Language revival|revivalist]] movement around the [[Felibrige]] and the [[Institut d'Estudis Occitans]] is active in Limousin (as well as in other parts of [[Occitania]]).

==Differences from Languedocien==
Most speakers and academics consider Limousin to be a dialect of Occitan. For more detailed information on this question, see the section on [[Occitan#Dialects|Occitan dialects]] and [[Occitan#Codification|codification]].

The following reproduces the first article of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]: "All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40393">In the [[medieval Serbia]]n states, the privileged class consisted of nobility and clergy, distinguished from commoners, part of the [[feudalism|feudal society]]. The '''[[Serbian nobility]]''' (''srpska vlastela'', ''srpsko vlastelinstvo'' or ''srpsko plemstvo'') were roughly grouped into [[magnate]]s (''[[velikaš]]i'' or ''velmože''), the upper stratum, and the lesser nobility (''vlasteličići''). Serbia followed the government model established by the [[Byzantine Empire]].

The [[nobility]] possessed hereditary allodial estates, which were worked by dependent ''[[sebri]]'', the equivalent of Byzantine ''[[paroikoi]]''; peasants owing labour services, formally bound by decree. The nobility was obliged to serve the monarch in war.

==Hierarchy==

The nobility (''vlastela, vlastelinstvo'' or ''plemstvo'') of Serbia in the Middle Ages is roughly divided into [[magnate]]s (''[[velikaši]]'' or ''velmože''), nobility and petty noblemen (''vlasteličići''). Sometimes, the division is made between ''vlastela'' (including "great" and "small" ones) and ''vlasteličići'', the [[petty nobility]]. The lower-half social class, [[commoner]]s, were the ''[[sebri]]'' (себри).

*The ''[[velikaši]]'' (великаши) were the highest nobility class of Serbia.
*The ''vlasteličići'' (властеличићи) were the lower nobility class of Serbia.&lt;ref name=Leksikon-vlastelicici&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ćirković|first1=Sima|authorlink1=Sima Ćirković|last2=Mihaljčić|first2=Rade|authorlink2=Rade Mihaljčić|script-title=sr:Лексикон српског средњег века|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AypYAAAAMAAJ|year=1999|publisher=Knowledge|pp=91–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a relatively numerous class of the small, warrior nobility, originating from the ''vojnici'' (warriors) from sources from the end of the 12th and the beginning of the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Šarkić|first=Srđan|title=Srednjovekovno srpsko pravo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BxQlAQAAIAAJ|year=1996|publisher=Matica srpska|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; They held villages, with full rights,&lt;ref name=Leksikon-vlastelicici/&gt; and in [[socioeconomic]] and legal terms stood below the ''vlastela''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Janković|first=Dragoslav|title=Istorija države i prava feudalne Srbije, XII-XV vek|publisher=Naućna knjiga|year=1961|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had military obligations, such as the ''vlasteličić'' joining the army individually or with a group of his men (soldiers), dependent on his wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nikola Stijepović|title=Srpska feudalna vojska|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wEw9AAAAMAAJ|year=1954|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{see also|History of Serbia|Medieval Serbia}}
{{Expand section|date=September 2011}}

===Early and High Middle Ages===
The Serbs at that time were organized into ''[[župe]]'' (sing. ''župa''), a confederation of village communities (roughly the equivalent of a county), headed by a local ''[[župan]]'' (a magistrate or governor); the governorship was hereditary, and the ''župan'' reported to the Serbian prince, whom they were obliged to aid in war.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|pp=225, 304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[John Van Antwerp Fine, Jr.|Fine Jr.]]: Bosnia, [[Zahumlje]] and Rascia were never incorporated into an integrated state with [[Duklja]] (1043–1101); each principality had its own nobility and institutions, simply requiring a member of the royal family to rule as Prince or Duke.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=223}} After [[Constantine Bodin]] died, the principalities seceded from Duklja, and Vukan became the most powerful Serb ruler, as ''Grand Prince''.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=223}} Subordinate to the ruler were local counts who seem to have been more or less autonomous in the internal affairs of their counties, but who swore loyalty and were obliged to support in war.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=225}} It seems that the counts were hereditary holders of their counties, holding their land before Duklja annexed Rascia.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=225}}

===Kingdom of Serbia===
[[File:Mourning nobility at the burial of Anna Dandolo.jpg|thumb|Mourning nobility at the burial of Queen [[Anna Dandolo]].]]
The hierarchy of the Serbian court titles was the following: ''[[stavilac]]'', ''[[čelnik]]'', ''[[kaznac]]'', ''[[tepčija]]'' and ''[[vojvoda]]'', the supreme title.{{sfn|Blagojević|2001|p=211}}

In the [[Dečani chrysobulls]], King [[Stefan Dečanski]] (r. 1321–1331) mentioned that the court dignitaries present at the Dečani assembly were the ''kaznac'', ''tepčija'', ''vojvoda'', ''sluga'' and ''stavilac''.{{sfn|Šarkić|1996|p=66}}

===Serbian Empire===
{{main|Serbian Empire|Stephen Uroš IV Dušan of Serbia}}
On April 16, 1346 ([[Easter]]), [[Stephen Uroš IV Dušan of Serbia]] convoked a huge assembly at [[Skopje]], attended by the Serbian Archbishop [[Joanikije II]], the [[Archbishop of Ochrid]] [[Nikolaj I of Ochrid|Nikolaj I]], the [[Bulgarian Patriarchate|Bulgarian Patriarch]] Simeon and various religious leaders of [[Mount Athos]].&lt;ref&gt;Temperley Harold William Vazeille (2009), ''History of Serbia'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=8dapE-FyIewC&amp;pg=PA72 p. 72]. {{ISBN|1-113-20142-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assembly and clerics agreed on, and then ceremonially performed the raising of [[Serbian Orthodox Church|the autocephalous Serbian Archbishopric to the status of Serbian Patriarchate]].&lt;ref name=LB309&gt;''The Late Medieval Balkans'', p. 309&lt;/ref&gt; The Archbishop from now on is titled [[Serbian Patriarch]], although some documents called him ''Patriarch of Serbs and Greeks'', with the seat at the [[Patriarchal Monastery of Peć]].&lt;ref name=LB309/&gt; The first [[List of heads of the Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Patriarch]] Joanikije II now solemnly crowned Dušan as "[[Basileus|Emperor]] and [[autocrator|autocrat]] of [[Serbs]] and [[Romaioi|Romans]]" ([[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|Bασιλεὺς καὶ αὐτoκράτωρ Σερβίας καὶ Pωμανίας}}).&lt;ref name=LB309/&gt;
Dušan had his son crowned ''King of Serbs and Greeks'', giving him nominal rule over the ''[[Serbian lands]]'', and although Dušan was governing the whole state, he had special responsibility for the "Roman", i.e. ''Greek lands''.&lt;ref name=LB309/&gt;

A further increase in the Byzantinization of the Serbian court followed, particularly in court ceremonial and titles.&lt;ref name=LB309/&gt; As Emperor, Dušan could grant titles only possible as an Emperor.&lt;ref name=LB310&gt;''The Late Medieval Balkans'', p. 310&lt;/ref&gt; In the years that followed, Dušan's half-brother [[Symeon Uroš]] and brother-in-law [[Jovan Asen]] became ''[[despotes]]''. [[Jovan Oliver]] already had the despot title, granted to him by Andronikos III. His brother-in-law [[Dejan Dragaš]] and [[Branko Mladenović|Branko]] is granted the title of ''[[sebastocrator]]''. The military commanders (''voivodes'') [[Preljub]] and [[Vojihna]] receive the title of ''caesar''.&lt;ref name=LB310/&gt;  The raising of the Serbian Patriarch resulted in the same spirit, bishoprics became metropolitans, as for example the [[Metropolitanate of Skopje]].&lt;ref name=LB310/&gt;

=== Fall of the Serbian Empire ===
{{main|Fall of the Serbian Empire}}
Emperor Uroš V died childless in December 2/4 1371, after much of the Serbian nobility had been destroyed in Maritsa earlier that year. This marked an end to the once powerful Empire.  Vukašin's son Marko, who had earlier been crowned ''Young King'' was to inherit his father's royal title, and thus became one in the line of successors to the Serbian throne. Meanwhile, the nobles pursued their own interests, sometimes quarreling with each other.  Serbia, without an Emperor "became a conglomerate of aristocratic territories",&lt;ref name=RossAllen-505&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JHCAz1b8eCgC Ross-Allen 1978], p. 505&lt;/ref&gt; and the Empire was thus divided between the provincial lords: [[Prince Marko|Marko]], the [[Dejanović brothers]], [[Đurađ I Balšić]], [[Vuk Branković]], [[Nikola Altomanović]], [[Lazar Hrebeljanović]] and other lesser ones.&lt;ref name=Corovic-3-XIII&gt;Ćorović 2001, ch. 3, XIII.

== New Zealand ==

New Zealand's countrywide meshblock framework was first set up in 1976,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

It comprised 41,376 meshblocks at the 2006 Census,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Geographic hierarchy|url=http://www.stats.govt.nz/surveys_and_methods/methods/classifications-and-standards/geographic-hierarchy.aspx|publisher=Statistics New Zealand|accessdate=12 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014014548/http://www.stats.govt.nz/surveys_and_methods/methods/classifications-and-standards/geographic-hierarchy.aspx|archive-date=2013-10-14|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; increasing to 46,637 meshblocks in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Meshblocks 2013 Annual Pattern|url=http://www3.stats.govt.nz/digitalboundaries%5Cannual%5CDigital%20Boundary%202013%20Metadata.zip|work=ANZLIC 2013 Digital Boundaries Metadata|publisher=Statistics New Zealand|accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meshblocks are defined by [[Statistics New Zealand]] as being "the smallest geographic unit for which statistical data is collected and processed by Statistics New Zealand". It is a defined area, varying in size from part of a city block to large areas of rural land. Each of these borders another to form a network covering the whole country including inlets and coasts, and extending out to the 200 mile [[Exclusive economic zone|economic zone]]. Meshblocks are added together to "build up" larger geographic areas such as area units and urban areas. They are also used to draw up and define [[New Zealand electorates]] and [[territorial authorities of New Zealand|local authority boundaries]].&lt;ref name="statsnz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://datainfoplus.stats.govt.nz/Item/nz.govt.stats/011d668f-1fe2-4820-8957-837aae2bf575|title=Meshblock (Concept)|date=2 February 2016|publisher=[[Statistics New Zealand]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Australia ==

In [[Australia]] mesh blocks were developed by the [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] from 2006, and released in February 2008, although they will not be fully implemented until 2011. There are now 314,369 mesh blocks in Australia. They are intended to be the basic unit which all other [[Local government in Australia|administrative]], political (both [[State Electoral District|state]] and [[Divisions of the Australian House of Representatives|federal]]), [[Suburbs and localities (Australia)|suburban]], [[Postcodes in Australia|postal]], [[Cadastral divisions of Australia|cadastral]], and [[Census in Australia#Australian Standard Geographical Classification|statistical]] divisions in Australia will be composed of. This is so that statistics can be easily made available for the many types of uses needed, such as non-standard areas like water catchments etc. Mesh blocks are about four or five times smaller than the currently used Census Collection Districts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.councils.wa.gov.au/directory/news_room/lg_news/lgnews17.06/download councils.wa Issue 35 3 September 2004]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of those in residential areas cover an area of around 30-60 dwellings, which is meant to be the smallest size data can be gathered so that people would not be able to be identified.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15212">The '''Muettersproch-Gsellschaft''' (short '''MSG''', engl. ''society for the mother tongue'') is a [[voluntary association|society]] established in 1967 whose goal it is to preserve and foster the [[Alemannic German|Alemannic dialects]]. It currently has over 3,500 members from all Alemannic speaking areas, i.e. [[Elsass]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Vorarlberg]], but especially from [[Baden|South Baden]]. There are also members from all over [[Europe]] and the [[Americas]]. Most Alemannic authors, poets and singer-songwriters in South Baden are members of the society.

== Organization ==
=== Membership ===
The society was founded in 1966 in [[Freiburg im Breisgau]]. It has over 2,700 members, the vast majority of whom are [[German language|German]]-[[Alemannic German|Alemannic]] bilinguals from the region covered by the former state of [[South Baden]]. They engage in exchanging their cultural heritage with the other Alemannic-speaking regions in [[Alsace]], [[Switzerland]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Vorarlberg]] and [[Colonia Tovar]]. With time, some Alemanni (German: ''Alemannen'') dispersed across Europe and overseas and many of these are also members of the Muettersproch-Gsellschaft. The membership further comprises many Alemannic authors and songwriters.

Society's membership grew and is now declining:&lt;ref&gt;Muettersproch-Gsellschaft: ''Wer mir sin. Was mir welle. Warum mir s welle. Wie mir s mache.''

=== Regional groups ===
Since November 2010, the society's head office is located in [[Freiburg im Breisgau]], which is complemented by 16 regional groups across southern [[Baden]] and one group of Alemanni in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alemannisch.de/eip/pages/geschaeftsstelle.php Headquarter of the Muettersproch-Gsellschaft in Freiburg im Breisgau]&lt;/ref&gt; Regional groups organise a number of different events, such as public readings, lectures, street stalls and festivals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alemannisch.de/de/regionalgruppen/ Regional groups of the Muettersproch-Gsellschaft]&lt;/ref&gt; Membership in regional groups is automatic for all members who live within its catchment area; members outside any of these catchment areas can either ask to affiliate with a group they feel connected to or remain without such an affiliation. Regional groups make contact with the Alemannic language groups in [[Alsace]], [[Switzerland]],  [[Liechtenstein]] und [[Vorarlberg]] by excursions as well as invitations of Alemannic poets and troubardours.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Pflaum: ''Muettersproch-Gsellschaft im Kontakt mit dem Elsass und der Schweiz.'' In: Alemannisch dunkt üs guet, Heft 2/2014, p. 24-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Members meeting ===
Members meeting is held every year in another city. The official agenda concentrates on account, report of activities and acceptance of the accounts. If necessary, an election of a new board is held, then follow proposals and prospects. Cultural activities are additional to the official part.&lt;ref&gt;Quelle: Iiladig zue de Mitgliederversammlung 2014 vu de Muettersproch-Gsellschaft. Am Samschdig, 5. April 2014, nommidags um Zwei in de Mensa vu de HTWG.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Core activities ==

The Muettersproch-Gsellschaft today are involved with several activities which serve to increase awareness of the organisation while simultaneously rewarding people who support the dialect. Their operations actively work to promote the dialect and to educate people who might otherwise view Alemannic in a pejorative light. They also seek to demonstrate that the dialect has purpose and value for those who can claim it as part of their heritage. Klaus Poppen, president of the MSG from 1972 through to 2002, has had significant influence over the way the society is and operates today. Among their core activities are the following:

* The society has published several [[anthology|anthologies]] of poetry.
* They produce the popular sticker "Bi uns cha me au alemannisch schwätze" (engl. ''Here you can speak Alemannic too'').
* In 1982 they collected 37,000 signatures in a campaign for increased use of the dialect in radio and television broadcasts.
* The Muettersproch-Gsellschaft regularly organises competitions, such as the lyrics and prose competition "Mir sueche die Beschte" (engl. ''We are looking for the best'') in 2004, which they had organised in coordination with the newspaper [[Badische Zeitung]] and the public broadcaster [[Südwestrundfunk]].
* They organise seminars on poetry composition, public speaking and other topics in which their members can gain new knowledge and skills in their dialect.
* They publish the magazine [[:de:Alemannisch dunkt üs guet|Alemannisch dunkt üs guet]] bi-annually, which is sent out to all members and also partially available from their website.
* The Muettersproch-Gsellschaft awards the prize [[:de:Alemannen-Antenne|Alemannen-Antenne]] in irregular intervals, which recognises individuals from radio and television who have shown commitment to the Alemannic dialect.

=== Alemannic authors and songwriters ===
About 100 authors of alemannic tongue are part of the Muettersproch-Gsellschaft. Songwriters in the Alemannic language are members as well.&lt;ref&gt;Muettersproch-Gsellschaft: ''Wer mir sin. Was mir welle. Warum mir s welle. Wie mir s mache.'' Gutenbergdruckerei Benedikt Oberkirch, Freiburg 2009, pp. 12–13&lt;/ref&gt; The societies Muettersproch-Gsellschaft and Landesverein Badische Heimat published an Alemannic dictionary (Alemannisches Wörterbuch) and a songbook (Alemannisches Liederbuch).&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Post und Friedel Scheer-Nahor: ''Alemannisches Wörterbuch für Baden.'' G. Braun Buchverlag, Karlsruhe, 2. Auflage 2010. {{ISBN|978-3-7650-8534-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Uli Führe und Stefan Pflaum: ''Woni sing un stand. Ein grenzüberschreitendes Liederbuch.'' G. Braun Buchverlag, Karlsruhe, Auflage 2012. {{ISBN|978-3-7650-8620-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Semiannual Journal ===
Twice a year, the society's journal ''Alemannisch dunkt üs guet'' (''We feel good speaking in Alemannic'') with a circulation of 3,000 copies is issued in the Alemannic language to provide information to members and give them platform for their own work. More than 100 volumes have been issued since 1967. Popular themes are: ''Us de Gruppe'' (Groups report) and ''Des un sell'' (Mishmash). Further topics are: new members, tourist highlights, and Alemannic books and CDs. Congratulations and obituary notices are also included.&lt;ref&gt;Muettersproch-Gsellschaft: ''Wer mir sin. Was mir welle. Warum mir s welle. Wie mir s mache.'' Gutenbergdruckerei Benedikt Oberkirch, Freiburg 2009, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Internet and new media ===
The society's web site gives further details on the nearest regional chapter, the old issues of journal ''Alemannisch dunkt üs guet'' and what is happening in the Alemannic cultural scene. There are also a variety of alemannic poems from more than 100 authors. On the subpage "Writers and Musicians" (Dichte und musiziere) are curriculum vitae, publications, honour degrees and examples of works from Alemannic music groups and authors.&lt;ref&gt;(als) [http://www.alemannisch.de/ Offizielle Internetseite der Muettersproch-Gsellschaft]&lt;/ref&gt; Alemannic writers and artists have the opportunity to get to know their new books, CDs and others on the website.

On YouTube an archive with portraits of Alemannic writers is being installed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPbw1dyWffVJd551M-iB-KA YouTube-Dichter-Archiv der Muettersproch-Gsellschaft]&lt;/ref&gt; A Facebook site reports Alemannic news.&lt;ref&gt;Franz-Josef Winterhalter: ''Die Zukunft der Muettersproch-Gsellschaft - Wo goht's nah mit iis?.'' In Alemannisch dunkt üs guet, 1/2017, p. 36-38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/Alemannisch/ Official site of the Muettersproch-Gsellschaft at facebook]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Questions and answers ===
Questions concerning Alemannic language and their idioms come from cultural and scientific institutions and members of the society.  The will be clarified and discussed by the board.&lt;ref&gt;Franz-Josef Winterhalter: ''Die Zukunft der Muettersproch-Gsellschaft - Wo goht's nah mit iis?.'' In Alemannisch dunkt üs guet, 1/2017, p. 36-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Muettersproch-Gsellschaft as publisher ===
For a faster understanding and acceptance of the alemannic language a dicitionary (Alemannisches Wörterbuch), a songbook (Alemannische Liederbuch) and the pocket song book (Alemannisches Taschenliederbuch) were published.&lt;ref&gt;Franz-Josef Winterhalter: ''Die Zukunft der Muettersproch-Gsellschaft - Wo goht's nah mit iis?.'' In Alemannisch dunkt üs guet, 1/2017, p. 36-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Library ===
The library contains 900 books in Alemannic language, mainly from the [[Baden]] region. Further books by authors from [[Switzerland]], [[Alsace]] and [[Vorarlberg]] are likewise collected. More than half of the books in the collection had been sent to Muettersproch-Gsellschaft for review in the journal.&lt;ref&gt;Muettersproch-Gsellschaft: ''Wer mir sin. Was mir welle. Warum mir s welle. Wie mir s mache.'' Gutenbergdruckerei Benedikt Oberkirch, Freiburg 2009, S. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dialect at school (Mundart in der Schule) ===
The society's goal is to get school children in [[Baden-Württemberg]] accustomed to the regional dialects Fränkisch, Schwäbisch and Alemannic. School classes and project groups can invite one of about 60 authors and songwriters to present their wisdom of idioms and dialects in lessons of two hours. An inventory of each artists capabilities is contained in the pamphlet ''Mundart in der Schule''. In this way different forms and rhythms of dialect can be put in perspective as varieties of the German language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mundart-in-der-schule.de Website of the association Mundart in der Schule]&lt;/ref&gt; Organisation of these contacts is done by Muettersproch-Gsellschaft e. V., coorganiser is the society „schwäbische mund.art“ e. V. in Herrenberg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mund-art.de Website of schwäbische mund.art e.V.]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medal in honour of Johann-Peter-Hebel ===
Since 1991, the regional chapter "Hegau" (the largest   Muettersproch-Gsellschaft chapter with 600 members) awards someone with the "Johann-Peter-Hebel-Medaille" medal to express appreciation for engagement in the Alemannic language.&lt;ref&gt;(als) [http://www.alemannisch.de/de/regionalgruppen/show.php?id=8 Regional group Hegau of the Muettersproch-Gsellschaft]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Future activities ==
In addition to the sessions of the regional groups special working groups will develop proposals concentrating on alemannic poets, theatre and new media. Events in the alemannic language region will be organized for a selection of different cities.&lt;ref&gt;Franz-Josef Winterhalter: ''Die Zukunft der Muettersproch-Gsellschaft - Wo goht's nah mit iis?.'' In Alemannisch dunkt üs guet, 1/2017, S. 36-38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Uschi Isele: ''D Muettersproch mueß reagiere.'' In Alemannisch dunkt üs guet, 1/2017, p. 38-39.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Problems faced by the Muettersproch-Gsellschaft ==

=== Use of Alemannic as a Political Instrument ===
In connection with the so-called "[[Austropop|Dialect Wave]]" of the 70s and its connection to the [[Anti-nuclear movement in Germany|anti-nuclear movement]] in [[Wyhl]], it came to a split in the position of the MSG's membership. The society's board argued vehemently against political instrumentalisation of the dialect, while activists in the movement sought to actively strengthen both their association with the local people and their assertion of local rights through prominent use of the regional dialect.&lt;ref&gt;Noth, H. (2000) ''S Kriägsbeil''. In: Badische Zeitung, 23. September 2000. Available: [http://www.noth.net/g12kriagsbeil.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Generational Change ===
There is ongoing concern among the membership and board of the society regarding the future of both the society and the Alemannic dialects. While it is an express goal of the society to preserve the dialects, Alemannic suffers from an acutely ageing speaker population as the language is frequently not passed on to the younger generation or its maintenance neglected by young speakers, leading to generational language loss. This is also the principal reason the [[UNESCO]] [[Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger]] currently categorises Alemannic as ''vulnerable'' despite speaker estimates ranging in the millions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unesco.org/culture/languages-atlas/en/atlasmap/language-id-1011.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The society is thus faced with the problem of encouraging parents to pass on the language as well as keeping young people engaged and interested in the language. The society has so far attempted to effect this through a variety of measures ranging from competitions for the youth to the use of [[rock music]]. They are also regularly organising in-school sessions, in which active members from the society (mainly authors and poets) design a short curriculum on Alemannic language and culture which they then teach over two lessons. The society has thus far perceived this program as greatly successful.&lt;ref&gt;(de) [http://www.mundart-in-der-schule.de Internetseite des Arbeitskreises Mundart in der Schule]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(de) [http://www.mund-art.de Internetseite schwäbische mund.art e.V.]&lt;/ref&gt;
The MSG also makes itself available as a platform to the younger generation through which they can present their own projects relating to Alemannic language and culture.

The '''Muslim Kayastha''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|مسلمان کائستھ}}}}) are community of [[Muslim]]s, descendents of members of the [[Kayastha]] [[caste]] of [[North India|northern India]], mainly in modern [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Punjab]] and [[Bihar]] who embraced [[Islam]] during the rule of [[Islamic empires in India|Muslim dynasties]].&lt;ref&gt;People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII Part 2 by K S Singh page 1046&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Sdz9AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=Endogamy+and+Status+Mobility+among+Siddiqui+Shaikh+in+Social+Stratification&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjezfWoi4HRAhUh5YMKHU0KD7UQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Endogamy%20and%20Status%20Mobility%20among%20Siddiqui%20Shaikh%20in%20Social%20Stratification&amp;f=false Muslim Backward Classes: A Sociological Perspective]&lt;/ref&gt; The Muslim Kayastha are part of the [[Muslims of Uttar Pradesh]] as well as the Muslims of the [[Punjab region]]. The Muslim Kayastha are considered to be [[Shaikhs in South Asia|Shaikh]] and follow [[Sunni]] [[Hanafi]] [[fiqh]]. The Muslim Kayasths have intermarried with the other Muslim communities over the centuries and have lost their community consciousness and consider themselves to be part of the [[Urdu language|Urdu speaking]] Muslims of [[Pakistan]] and [[North India|northern India]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Muslim_Kayasths.html?id=K8mRMAEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y Muslim Kayasths]&lt;/ref&gt; They live in the state of [[Uttar Pradesh]] in [[India]], the provinces of [[Sindh]] and [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]] in [[Pakistan]] and many have now settled in [[United Kingdom]], [[United States]] and [[Canada]].

==History and origin==
The [[Kayastha]]  (also known as Kulshreshtha, Kulshrestha, Kayasth or Kayeth) community has historically been involved in the occupations of land [[Records management|record keeping]] and [[accounting]]. Some Hindu Kayasth found favour with [[Muslim]] rulers for whom the acted as [[Qanungoh Shaikh|Qanungo]] employees of the court and judicial systems. This close association, led to the conversion of many members of the [[Kayastha]] community to [[Islam]]. They speak [[Urdu language|Urdu]], although they are also fluent in [[Hindi language|Hindi]] in India,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;People of India Uttar Pradesh page 1047&lt;/ref&gt; while they also speak [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]] and [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] in [[Pakistan]]. The Kayasth use [[Siddiqui]], [[Manihar]]zada and [[Farooqi]] as their surnames, and consider themselves belonging to the [[Shaikhs in South Asia|Shaikh]] community.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Endogamy and Status Mobility among Siddiqui Shaikh in Social Stratication edited by Dipankar Gupta&lt;/ref&gt; The Muslim dynasties also recruited individuals from the different Hindus castes by [[Meritocracy|merit]] and trained them as civil servants these persons then became part of the Kayasth caste.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4KcbAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA116&amp;lpg=RA1-PA116&amp;dq=kayastha+formation+different+castes&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mQKzmrRQSv&amp;sig=pERawFZCn0iWFDd8sb304MS62AA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjHybXb7YDRAhVL54MKHSoVC7sQ6AEIbjAR#v=onepage&amp;q=kayastha%20formation%20different%20castes&amp;f=false Calcutta Review, Volumes 100-101]&lt;/ref&gt; A number of [[Shaikhs in South Asia|Shaikh]] groups found in [[Uttar Pradesh]] are converts from the [[Kayasth|Kayastha or Kayasth]] [[Hindu]] caste that embraced [[Islam]] during the rule of [[Islamic empires in India|Muslim dynasties]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Muslim Kayasthas of India by Jahanara KK Publications {{ISBN|978-81-675-6606-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] scriptures known as the [[Purana]]s, the [[Kayastha]]s were descendants of [[Chitragupta]], a Hindu god assigned with the task of keeping complete records of actions of human beings on the earth. Upon their death, Chitragupta has the task of deciding heaven or the hell for the humans, depending on their actions on the earth. Chitragupta Maharaj (Chitragupta the King) is the patron deity and forefather of Kayasthas, a Hindu caste and are [[scribe]]s, [[Official]]s, [[Administrator of the Government|administrators]], writers, magistrates, judges. lawyers, chief executive officers and village accountants in ancient [[South Asia]]. Kayasthas celebrate: [[Qalam]] and [[Inkpot|Dawaat]] (pen and ink-pot) worship, a ritual in which pens, papers and books were worshipped. This clearly shows that they were clerks and official record keepers of the kings. [[Kayastha]]s were valued in the second millennia by most kingdoms and princely states as desired citizens or immigrants within South Asia. The [[Islamic empires in India|Muslim kingdoms]] treated the Kayasthas more as a community rather than a Hindu caste because they developed expertise in [[Persian language|Persian]] (the state language in Islamic India), learned [[Turkic languages|Turkish]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]], economics, administration and taxation. This gave them an edge over the [[Brahmins]] (the priestly [[Hindu]] [[caste]]), who traditionally had reserved the study of [[Sanskrit]]  [[shastra]]s to themselves. They successfully adapted themselves as scribes and functionaries under Islamic rule and later on under the [[British Raj|British]]. Some historians hold the view that during the reign of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]], a number of [[Forward caste|upper caste]] Hindus who were educated and endowed with sharp intellect attained administrative positions through rapid adaptation to the Persian language and culture of the new rulers of South Asia. These influential [[Forward caste|upper caste]] Hindus got together and formed a new caste known as [[Kayastha]]. Their secular viewpoint to life, adaptability and lifestyle was an asset which allowed them to succeed. This close association with Muslim rulers led to the conversion of most members of the Kayastha community to [[Islam]]. The Muslim Kayasthas outnumbered the Hindu Kayastha even today. The Muslim Kayasthas have intermarried with the other Muslim communities over the centuries and have lost their community consciousness and consider themselves to be part of the [[Urdu language|Urdu speaking]] Muslims of [[North India|northern India]]. The Muslim Kayastha community also adapted to changes, such as the advent of the [[British Raj]].  They learned [[English language|English]], the more affluent ones sent their children to the [[United Kingdom]], they became civil servants, tax officers, junior administrators, teachers, legal helpers and barristers, and rose to the highest positions accessible to natives in [[British Raj|British India]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

The Muslim Kayasth have traditionally been a literate and landless community living as [[Patwari]]s and [[Qanungoh Shaikh|Qanungoh]]s (land record keepers). The only exception being the large [[taluqdar]] families, who were substantial landowners. They have high rates of literacy, and many have played important roles in the cultural life of the North Indian Muslim community.

==Present circumstances==
The Muslim Kayastha are considered to be [[Shaikhs in South Asia|Shaikh]] and follow [[Sunni]] [[Hanafi]] [[fiqh]]. The Muslim Kayasthas have intermarried with the other Muslim communities over the centuries and have lost their community consciousness and have [[Cultural assimilation|assimilated]] into [[Urdu language|Urdu speaking]] Muslims of [[Pakistan]] and [[North India|northern India]]. They live mainly in the state of [[Uttar Pradesh]] in [[India]], the provinces of [[Sindh]] and [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]] in [[Pakistan]] and many have now settled in [[United Kingdom]], [[United States]] and [[Canada]].

==Religion==
The Muslim Kayasths are [[Sunni]] [[Muslim]]s of the [[Hanafi]] [[fiqh]] (school of jurisprudence).

==Distribution==

===India===
The Muslim Kayasth are mainy settled in the [[North India|northern Indian]] states of [[Haryana]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], [[Uttarakhand]], [[Uttar Pradesh]] and [[Bihar]] and also in other states: [[Jharkhand]], [[West Bengal]], [[Telangana]], [[Madhya Pradesh]] and [[Maharashtra]]. In Uttar Pradesh, the Muslim Kayasth live in the urban and semi-urban centers of the state.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;District gazetteers of the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh . Volume XLVII Pratabgarh District edited by H.R Nevill&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; There is also large community also in [[Delhi]], capital of India.

===Pakistan===
After the [[Pakistan Movement|independence]] in 1947, many Muslim Kayasthas migrated and settled in the provinces of [[Sindh]] and [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]] in [[Pakistan]]. In [[Sindh]] province, they are mainly settled in the urban centers especially in [[Karachi]], [[Hyderabad, Sindh|Hyderabad]] and [[Sukkur]]. In [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]] province, they have settled in [[Lahore]], [[Rawalpindi]], [[Multan]] and [[Faisalabad]]. There is also large community also in [[Islamabad]], capital of Pakistan.

===Overseas===
Many Muslim Kayasth have emigrated to the Western countries in [[Europe]], [[North America]] and [[Australasia]], and now have settled in [[United Kingdom]], [[United States]], [[Canada]] and [[Australia]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24461">'''Nudge''' is a concept in [[behavioral science]], [[political theory]] and [[behavioral economics]] which proposes [[positive reinforcement]] and indirect suggestions as ways to [[Social influence|influence]] the behavior and [[decision making]] of groups or individuals. Nudging contrasts with other ways to achieve compliance, such as [[education]], [[legislation]] or [[enforcement]]. The concept has influenced British and American politicians. Several nudge units exist around the world at the national level (UK, Germany, Japan and others) as well as at the international level (e.g. [[OECD]], [[World Bank]], [[United Nations|UN]]).

==Definition of a nudge==
[[File:Nudge_Toilet_1.jpg|thumb|Example of a nudge: a housefly painted onto the ceramic of a [[urinal]] in a men's public toilet]]
The first formulation of the term and associated principles was developed in [[cybernetics]] by James Wilk before 1995 and described by Brunel University academic D. J. Stewart as "the art of the nudge" (sometimes referred to as micronudges&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=Wilk, J. | year=1999 | chapter=Mind, nature and the emerging science of change: An introduction to metamorphology. | editor1=G. Cornelis|editor2=S. Smets|editor3=J. Van Bendegem | title=EINSTEIN MEETS MAGRITTE: An Interdisciplinary Reflection on Science, Nature, Art, Human Action and Society: Metadebates on science | volume=6 | pages=71–87 | publisher=Springer Netherlands | doi=10.1007/978-94-017-2245-2_6| isbn=978-90-481-5242-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). It also drew on methodological influences from clinical [[psychotherapy]] tracing back to [[Gregory Bateson]], including contributions from [[Milton Erickson]], [[Paul Watzlawick|Watzlawick]], [[John Weakland|Weakland]] and Fisch, and [[Bill O'Hanlon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author1=O'Hanlon, B.|author2=Wilk, J. | year=1987 | title=Shifting contexts : The generation of effective psychotherapy. | publisher=New York, N.Y.: Guilford Press.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this variant, the nudge is a microtargetted design geared towards a specific group of people, irrespective of the scale of intended intervention.

In 2008, [[Richard Thaler]] and [[Cass Sunstein]]'s book ''[[Nudge (book)|Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness]]'' brought nudge theory to prominence. It also gained a following among US and UK politicians, in the private sector and in [[public health]].&lt;ref&gt;See: [http://www.shponline.co.uk/features-content/full/cpd-article-nudge-nudge-think-think Dr. Jennifer Lunt and Malcolm Staves]&lt;/ref&gt; The authors refer to influencing behaviour without coercion as [[libertarian paternalism]] and the influencers as choice architects.&lt;ref name=speak /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://lucidez.pe/economia/richard-thaler-y-el-auge-de-la-economia-conductual-por-marco-carrasco/|title=Richard Thaler y el auge de la Economía Conductual|last=Carrasco-Villanueva|first=Marco|date=2017-10-18|language=es|work=Lucidez|access-date=2018-10-31|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thaler and Sunstein defined their concept as:

{{quote|''A nudge, as we will use the term, is any aspect of the [[choice architecture]] that alters people's behavior in a predictable way without forbidding any options or significantly changing their economic incentives. To count as a mere nudge, the intervention must be easy and cheap to avoid. Nudges are not mandates. Putting fruit at eye level counts as a nudge. Banning junk food does not.''}}

In this form, drawing on [[behavioral economics]], the nudge is more generally applied to influence behaviour.

One of the most frequently cited examples of a nudge is the etching of the image of a housefly into the men's room [[Urinal|urinals]] at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport, which is intended to "improve the aim".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Nudge|last = R. Thaler and C. Sunstein.|publisher = Penguin Books|year = 2008|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
A nudge makes it more likely that an individual will make a particular choice, or behave in a particular way, by altering the environment so that automatic cognitive processes are triggered to favour the desired outcome.&lt;ref name="Saghai"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Saghai|first1=Yashar|title=Salvaging the concept of nudge|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|date=2013|volume=39|issue=8|pages=487–93|doi=10.1136/medethics-2012-100727|pmid=23427215}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parkinson|first1=J.A.|last2=Eccles|first2=K.E.|last3=Goodman|first3=A.|title=Positive impact by design: the Wales centre for behaviour change|journal=The Journal of Positive Psychology|date=2014|volume=9|issue=6|page=517–522}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An individual’s behaviour is not always in alignment with their intentions (termed a [[value-action gap]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parkinson|first1=J.A.|last2=Eccles|first2=K.E.|last3=Goodman|first3=A.|title=Positive impact by design: the Wales centre for behaviour change|journal=The Journal of Positive Psychology|date=2014|volume=9|issue=6|page=517–522}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is common knowledge that humans are not fully rational beings; that is, people will often do something that is not in their own self interest, even when they are aware that their actions are not in their best interest.&lt;ref name="Kosters"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kosters|first1=M|last2=Van der Heijden|first2=J|title=From mechanism to virtue: evaluating nudge theory|journal=Evaluation|date=2015|volume=21|issue=3|page=276–291}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, when hungry, dieters often under-estimate their ability to lose weight, and their intentions to eat healthy can be temporarily weakened until they are satiated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nordgren|first1=L.|last2=Van der Pligt|first2=J.|last3=van Harreveld|first3=F.|title=The instability of health cognitions: visceral states influence self-efficacy and related health beliefs|journal=Health Psychology|date=2008|volume=27|issue=6|page=722–727}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thaler and Sunstein&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Nudge|last = R. Thaler and C. Sunstein.|publisher = Penguin Books|year = 2008|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; describe two distinct systems for processing information as to why people sometimes act against their own self-interest: System 1 is fast, automatic, and highly susceptible to environmental influences; System 2 processing is slow, reflective, and takes into account explicit goals and intentions.&lt;ref name="Saghai"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Saghai|first1=Yashar|title=Salvaging the concept of nudge|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|date=2013|volume=39|issue=8|pages=487–93|doi=10.1136/medethics-2012-100727|pmid=23427215}}&lt;/ref&gt; When situations are overly complex or overwhelming for an individual’s cognitive capacity, or when an individual is faced with time-constraints or other pressures, System 1 processing takes over decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parkinson|first1=J.A.|last2=Eccles|first2=K.E.|last3=Goodman|first3=A.|title=Positive impact by design: the Wales centre for behaviour change|journal=The Journal of Positive Psychology|date=2014|volume=9|issue=6|page=517–522}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campbell-Arvai|first1=V|last2=Arvai|first2=J.|last3=Kalof|first3=L.|title=Motivating sustainable food choices: the role of nudges, value orientation, and information provision|journal=Environment and Behavior|date=2014|volume=46|issue=4|page=453–475}}&lt;/ref&gt; System 1 processing relies on various judgmental heuristics to make decisions, resulting in faster decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campbell-Arvai|first1=V|last2=Arvai|first2=J.|last3=Kalof|first3=L.|title=Motivating sustainable food choices: the role of nudges, value orientation, and information provision|journal=Environment and Behavior|date=2014|volume=46|issue=4|page=453–475}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, this can also lead to sub-optimal decisions. In fact, Thaler and Sunstein&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Nudge|last = R. Thaler and C. Sunstein.|publisher = Penguin Books|year = 2008|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; trace maladaptive behaviour to situations in which System 1 processing over-rides an individual’s explicit values and goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parkinson|first1=J.A.|last2=Eccles|first2=K.E.|last3=Goodman|first3=A.|title=Positive impact by design: the Wales centre for behaviour change|journal=The Journal of Positive Psychology|date=2014|volume=9|issue=6|page=517–522}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is well documented that habitual behaviour is resistant to change without a disruption to the environmental cues that trigger that behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campbell-Arvai|first1=V|last2=Arvai|first2=J.|last3=Kalof|first3=L.|title=Motivating sustainable food choices: the role of nudges, value orientation, and information provision|journal=Environment and Behavior|date=2014|volume=46|issue=4|page=453–475}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nudging techniques aim to use judgmental heuristics to our advantage. In other words, a nudge alters the environment so that when heuristic, or System 1, decision-making is used, the resulting choice will be the most positive or desired outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campbell-Arvai|first1=V|last2=Arvai|first2=J.|last3=Kalof|first3=L.|title=Motivating sustainable food choices: the role of nudges, value orientation, and information provision|journal=Environment and Behavior|date=2014|volume=46|issue=4|page=453–475}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of such a nudge is switching the placement of junk food in a store, so that fruit and other healthy options are located next to the cash register, while junk food is relocated to another part of the store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kroese|first1=F.|last2=Marchiori|first2=D.|last3=de Ridder|first3=D.|title=Nudging healthy food choices: a field experiment at the train station|journal=Journal of Public Health|date=2016|volume=38|issue=2|page=e133–e137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of nudges==
Nudges are small changes in environment that are easy and inexpensive to implement.&lt;ref name="Saghai"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Saghai|first1=Yashar|title=Salvaging the concept of nudge|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|date=2013|volume=39|issue=8|pages=487–93|doi=10.1136/medethics-2012-100727|pmid=23427215}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several different techniques exist for nudging, including defaults, social proof heuristics, and increasing the salience of the desired option.

A default option is the option an individual automatically receives if he or she does nothing. People are more likely to choose a particular option if it is the default option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campbell-Arvai|first1=V|last2=Arvai|first2=J.|last3=Kalof|first3=L.|title=Motivating sustainable food choices: the role of nudges, value orientation, and information provision|journal=Environment and Behavior|date=2014|volume=46|issue=4|page=453–475}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Pichert &amp; Katsikopoulos&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pichert|first1=D.|last2=Katsikopoulos|first2=K.V.|title=Green defaults: information presentation and pro-environmental behavior|journal=Journal of Environmental Psychology|date=2008|volume=28|page=63–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that a greater number of consumers chose the [[renewable energy]] option for electricity when it was offered as the default option.

A social proof heuristic refers to the tendency for individuals to look at the behavior of other people to help guide their own behavior. Studies have found some success in using social proof heuristics to nudge individuals to make healthier food choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cheung|first1=T.|last2=Kroese|first2=F.|last3=Fennis|first3=B.|last4=de Ridder|first4=D.|title=The hunger games: using hunger to promote healthy choices in self-control conflicts|journal=Appetite|date=2017|volume=116|page=401–409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When an individual’s attention is drawn towards a particular option, that option will become more salient to the individual, and he or she will be more likely to choose to that option.  As an example, in [[snack]] shops at train stations in the Netherlands, consumers purchased more fruit and [[healthy diet|healthy snack]] options when they were relocated next to the cash register.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kroese|first1=F.|last2=Marchiori|first2=D.|last3=de Ridder|first3=D.|title=Nudging healthy food choices: a field experiment at the train station|journal=Journal of Public Health|date=2016|volume=38|issue=2|page=e133–e137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application of theory==
In 2008, the United States appointed Sunstein, who helped develop the theory, as administrator of the [[Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs]].&lt;ref name=speak&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2008/aug/22/davidcameron.conservatives|title=Speak 'Nudge': The 10 key phrases from David Cameron's favorite book|author=Andrew Sparrow|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=2008-08-22|accessdate=2009-09-09 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/career_and_jobs/article4330267.ece|title=Why Barack Obama and David Cameron are keen to 'nudge' you|publisher=''[[The Times]]''|author=Carol Lewis |date=2009-07-22|accessdate=2009-09-09 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/the-magazine/features/839676/nudge-nudge-meet-the-cameroons-new-guru.thtml|title=Nudge, nudge: meet the Cameroons' new guru|publisher=''[[The Spectator]]''|author=James Forsyth|date=2009-07-16|accessdate=2009-09-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124222449/http://www.spectator.co.uk/the-magazine/features/839676/nudge-nudge-meet-the-cameroons-new-guru.thtml|archivedate=2009-01-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Notable applications of nudge theory include the formation of the British [[Behavioural Insights Team]] in 2010. It is often called the "Nudge Unit", at the British [[Cabinet Office]], headed by [[David Halpern (psychologist)|David Halpern]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/behavioral-insights-team/about#responsibilities|title=About us - Behavioural Insights Team - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Both Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] and President [[Barack Obama]] sought to employ nudge theory to advance [[domestic policy]] goals during their terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/first-obama-now-cameron-embraces-nudge-theory-2050127.html|title=First Obama, now Cameron embraces 'nudge theory'|date=12 August 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia, the government of New South Wales established a Behavioural Insights community of practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bi.dpc.nsw.gov.au/|title=Behavioural Insights Unit - What's new in the Behavioural Insights Unit|first=corporateName=Department of Premier and Cabinet; address=1 Farrer Place, Sydney, NSW, 2000; contact=+61 2 9228|last=5555|website=bi.dpc.nsw.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nudge theory has also been applied to [[business management]] and [[corporate culture]], such as in relation to [[Environment, health and safety|health, safety and environment]] (HSE) and human resources. Regarding its application to HSE, one of the primary goals of nudge is to achieve a "zero accident culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rydermarsh.co.uk/pdfs/SHP.0112.pdf|format=PDF|title=Cast No Shadow|website=Rydermarsh.co.uk|accessdate=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Leading [[Silicon Valley]] companies are forerunners in applying nudge theory in corporate setting. These companies are using nudges in various forms to increase productivity and happiness of employees. Recently, further companies are gaining interest in using what is called "nudge management" to improve the productivity of their white-collar workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ebert|first=Philip|last2=Freibichler|first2=Wolfgang|year=2017|title=Nudge management: applying behavioural science to increase knowledge worker productivity|journal=Journal of Organization Design|volume=6:4|pages=|doi=10.1186/s41469-017-0014-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Behavioral insights and nudges are currently used in many countries around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Carrasco-Villanueva |first=Marco |editor=上海社会科学院 [Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences]|title=2016上海青年汉学家研修计划论文集|language=zh|publisher=中国社会科学出版社 [China Social Sciences Press]|date=2016 |pages=368–392 |chapter=中国的环境公共政策：一个行为经济学的选择 [Environmental Public Policies in China: An Opportunity for Behavioral Economics]|isbn=978-1-234-56789-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critique==
Nudging has also been criticised. Tammy Boyce, from public health foundation [[The King's Fund]], has said: "We need to move away from short-term, politically motivated initiatives such as the 'nudging people' idea, which are not based on any good evidence and don't help people make long-term behaviour changes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-wellbeing/health-news/unhealthy-lifestyles-here-to-stay-in-spite-of-costly-campaigns-1055693.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Unhealthy lifestyles here to stay, in spite of costly campaigns | first=Nina | last=Lakhani | date=December 7, 2008 | accessdate=April 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cass Sunstein has responded to critiques at length in his ''The Ethics of Influence''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=TlvWDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR8&amp;dq=ethics+of+influence+sunstein#v=onepage&amp;q=ethics%20of%20influence%20sunstein&amp;f=false|title=The Ethics of Influence: Government in the Age of Behavioral Science|last=Sunstein|first=Cass R.|date=2016-08-24|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107140707|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; making the case in favor of nudging against charges that nudges diminish [[autonomy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schubert|first=Christian|date=2015-10-12|title=On the Ethics of Public Nudging: Autonomy and Agency|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2672970|location=Rochester, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;, threaten [[dignity]], violate liberties, or reduce [[welfare]]. He further defended nudge theory in his ''Why Nudge?: The Politics of Libertarian Paternalism''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=Rx3qAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Why Nudge?: The Politics of Libertarian Paternalism|last=Sunstein|first=Cass R.|date=2014|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300212693|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; by arguing that [[choice architecture]] is inevitable and that some form of paternalism cannot be avoided. Ethicists have debated nudge theory rigorously&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barton|first=Adrien|last2=Grüne-Yanoff|first2=Till|date=2015-09-01|title=From Libertarian Paternalism to Nudging—and Beyond|journal=Review of Philosophy and Psychology|language=en|volume=6|issue=3|pages=341–359|doi=10.1007/s13164-015-0268-x|issn=1878-5158}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These charges have been made by various participants in the debate from Bovens&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Preference Change|last=Bovens|first=Luc|date=2009|publisher=Springer, Dordrecht|isbn=9789048125920|series=Theory and Decision Library|pages=207–219|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-90-481-2593-7_10|chapter = The Ethics of Nudge}}&lt;/ref&gt;  to Goodwin&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goodwin|first=Tom|date=2012-06-01|title=Why We Should Reject 'Nudge'|journal=Politics|language=en|volume=32|issue=2|pages=85–92|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9256.2012.01430.x|issn=0263-3957}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Wilkinson for example charges nudges for being manipulative, while others such as Yeung question their scientific credibility&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yeung|first=Karen|date=2012-01-01|title=Nudge as Fudge|journal=The Modern Law Review|language=en|volume=75|issue=1|pages=122–148|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2230.2012.00893.x|issn=1468-2230}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Public opinion on the ethicality of nudges has also been shown to be susceptible to “partisan nudge bias”.&lt;ref name="NT"&gt;[https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/todd_rogers/files/tannenbaum_fox_rogers.2017.pdf Tannenbaum, D., Fox, C. R., &amp; Rogers, T. (2017). On the misplaced politics of behavioural policy interventions. Nature Human Behaviour , 1 (10 July 2017), 1-7.]&lt;/ref&gt; Research from David Tannenbaum, Craig R. Fox, and Todd Rogers (2017) found that adults and policymakers in the United States found behavioral policies to be more ethical when they aligned with their own political leanings.&lt;ref name="NT"/&gt; Conversely, people found these same mechanisms to be more unethical when they differed from their politics.&lt;ref name="NT"/&gt; The researchers also found that nudges are not inherently partisan: when evaluating behavioral policies absent of political cues, people across the political spectrum were alike in their assessments.&lt;ref name="NT"/&gt;

Some, such as Hausman &amp; Welch&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hausman|first=Daniel M.|last2=Welch|first2=Brynn|date=2010-03-01|title=Debate: To Nudge or Not to Nudge*|journal=Journal of Political Philosophy|language=en|volume=18|issue=1|pages=123–136|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9760.2009.00351.x|issn=1467-9760}}&lt;/ref&gt; have inquired whether nudging should be permissible on grounds of (distributive{{clarify|date=February 2018}}) justice; Lepenies &amp; Malecka &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lepenies|first=Robert|last2=Małecka|first2=Magdalena|date=2015-09-01|title=The Institutional Consequences of Nudging – Nudges, Politics, and the Law|journal=Review of Philosophy and Psychology|language=en|volume=6|issue=3|pages=427–437|doi=10.1007/s13164-015-0243-6|issn=1878-5158}}&lt;/ref&gt; have questioned whether nudges are compatible with the rule of law. Similarly, legal scholars have discussed the role of nudges and the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alemanno|first=A.|last2=Spina|first2=A.|date=2014-04-01|title=Nudging legally: On the checks and balances of behavioral regulation|url=https://academic.oup.com/icon/article/12/2/429/710410/Nudging-legally-On-the-checks-and-balances-of|journal=International Journal of Constitutional Law|language=en|volume=12|issue=2|pages=429–456|doi=10.1093/icon/mou033|issn=1474-2640}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kemmerer|first=Alexandra|last2=Möllers|first2=Christoph|last3=Steinbeis|first3=Maximilian|last4=Wagner|first4=Gerhard|date=2016-07-15|title=Choice Architecture in Democracies: Exploring the Legitimacy of Nudging - Preface|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2810229|location=Rochester, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Behavioral economists such as Bob Sugden have pointed out that the underlying normative benchmark of nudging is still [[homo economicus]], despite the proponents' claim to the contrary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sugden|first=Robert|date=2017-06-01|title=Do people really want to be nudged towards healthy lifestyles?|journal=International Review of Economics|language=en|volume=64|issue=2|pages=113–123|doi=10.1007/s12232-016-0264-1|issn=1865-1704}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It has been remarked that nudging is also a [[euphemism]] for [[psychological manipulation]] as practiced in [[social engineering (political science)|social engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/programs/olin_center/papers/pdf/Sunstein_809.pdf|format=PDF|title=NUDGING AND CHOICE ARCHITECTURE: ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS|author=Cass R.

There exists an anticipation and, simultaneously, implicit criticism of the nudge theory in works of Hungarian social psychologists who emphasize the active participation in the nudge of its target (Ferenc Merei)&lt;ref&gt;MÉREI Ferenc (1987): A perem-helyzet egyik változata: a szociálpszichológiai kontúr (A variant of the edge-position: the contour socialpsychological); Pszichológia (1987), 1, pp. 1-5.&lt;/ref&gt;, Laszlo Garai&lt;ref&gt;Garai L.

==History==
On May 28, 1984, Soros signed a contract between the Soros Foundation (New York) and the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]], the founding document of the Soros Foundation Budapest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Nóvé Béla | last = Tény | title = Soros | publisher = KKA | place = [[Hungary|HU]] | url = http://www.kka.hu/_Kozossegi_Adattar/Azadatt.nsf/02001425b1246fe38525664000665c75/560c780eb85cfd4ac12571aa0042dd56/$FILE/T%C3%A9ny_soros.pdf}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by several foundations in the region to help countries move away from communism.&lt;ref name="Hoduski-Abbott, Bernadine E. 2003. p75"&gt;Hoduski-Abbott, Bernadine E., ''Lobbying for Libraries and the Public's Access to Government Information'', Lanham: Scarecrow, 2003. p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991 the foundation merged with the Fondation pour une Entraide Intellectuelle Européenne, an affiliate of the [[Congress for Cultural Freedom]], created in 1966 to imbue 'non-conformist' Eastern European scientists with anti-totalitarian and capitalist ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=GUILHOT|first=NICOLAS|date=January 1, 2006|title=A NETWORK OF INFLUENTIAL FRIENDSHIPS: THE FONDATION POUR UNE ENTRAIDE INTELLECTUELLE EUROPÉENNE AND EAST-WEST CULTURAL DIALOGUE, 1957-1991|jstor=41821373|journal=Minerva|volume=44|issue=4|pages=379–409|subscription=Yes}}{{Subscription or libraries|sentence|via=[[ScienceDirect]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Open Society Institute was created in the [[United States]] in 1993 to support the Soros foundations in [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]] and the former [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name=callahan/&gt;

In August 2010, it started using the name Open Society Foundations (OSF) to better reflect its role as a benefactor for civil society groups in countries around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schrier|first1=H. Edward|title=THE BATTLE OF THE THREE WILLS: as it relates to good &amp; evil|date=2013|publisher=Author House|isbn=9781481758765|page=338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soros believes there can be no absolute answers to political questions because the same principle of [[reflexivity (social theory)|reflexivity]] applies as in financial markets.&lt;ref&gt;''Soros on Soros'' John Wiley, {{ISBN|978-0-471-11977-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, [[Christopher Stone (criminal justice expert)|Christopher Stone]] joined the OSF as the second president. He replaced [[Aryeh Neier]], who served as president from 1993 to 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/07/business/christopher-stone-to-lead-soros-open-society-foundations.html |title=Criminal Justice Expert Named to Lead Soros Foundations |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 11, 2011 |accessdate=July 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stone announced in September 2017 that he was stepping down as president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/2017/9/14/what-just-happened-at-the-open-society-foundations-and-what-comes-next |title=What Just Happened at the Open Society Foundations?

In 2016, the OSF was reportedly the target of a [[cyber security attack|cyber security breach]]. Documents and information reportedly belonging to the OSF were published by a website. The cyber security breach has been described as sharing similarities with Russian-linked [[cyberattack]]s that targeted other institutions, such as the [[2016 Democratic National Committee email leak|Democratic National Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-11/russian-hackers-of-dnc-said-to-scoop-up-secrets-from-nato-soros |title=Russian Hackers of DNC Said to Nab Secrets From NATO, Soros |last1=Riley |first1=Michael |publisher=Bloomberg |date=August 11, 2016 |accessdate=August 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and influence==
In 2007, Nicolas Guilhot (a senior research associate of [[French National Centre for Scientific Research|CNRS]]) wrote in ''[[Critical Sociology (journal)|Critical Sociology]]'' that the Open Society Foundations serve to perpetuate institutions that reinforce the existing social order, as the [[Ford Foundation]] and [[Rockefeller Foundation]] have done before them. Guilhot argues that control over the [[social sciences]] by moneyed interests has depoliticized this field and reinforced a capitalist view of [[modernization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guilhot|first1=Nicolas|title=Reforming the World: George Soros, Global Capitalism and the Philanthropic Management of the Social Sciences|journal=Critical Sociology|date=May 2007|volume=33|issue=3|pages=447–477|doi=10.1163/156916307X188988|url=http://crs.sagepub.com/content/33/3/447|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150407004506/http://crs.sagepub.com/content/33/3/447|dead-url=yes|archive-date=April 7, 2015|accessdate=May 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
An OSF effort in 2008 in the [[African Great Lakes]] region aimed at spreading human rights awareness among [[prostitution in Uganda|prostitutes in Uganda]] and other nations in the area was not received well by the Ugandan authorities, who considered it an effort to legalize and legitimize prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Uganda prostitute workshop banned|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7313310.stm|accessdate=November 20, 2015|publisher=BBC|date=March 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Open Society Foundation has been criticized in pro-Israel editorials, [[Tablet Magazine]], [[Arutz Sheva]] and [[Jewish Press]], for including funding for the activist groups [[Adalah – The Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel|Adalah]] and [[Haneen Zoabi#Political career|I'lam]], which they say are [[anti-Israel]] and support the [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions]]. Among the documents released by [[DCleaks]], an OSF report reads "For a variety of reasons, we wanted to construct a diversified portfolio of grants dealing with [[Israel]] and [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], funding both Israeli Jewish and PCI (Palestinian Citizens of Israel) groups as well as building a portfolio of Palestinian grants and in all cases to maintain a low profile and relative distance—particularly on the advocacy front."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/210826/soros-hack-reveals-evidence-of-systemic-anti-israel-bias Soros Hack Reveals Evidence of Systemic Anti-Israel Bias]; Liel Leibovitz; August 14, 2016; [[Tablet Magazine]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishpress.com/news/breaking-news/dc-leaks-publishes-george-soros-files-showing-millions-contributed-to-anti-israel-causes/2016/08/14/ DC Leaks Publishes George Soros’ Files Showing Millions Contributed to Anti-Israel Causes] Jewish Press; David Israel; Published: August 14, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/216382 George Soros hacked, documents posted online] Rachel Kaplan, 14/08/16&lt;/ref&gt;

[[NGO Monitor]], an Israeli NGO, produced a report which says, "Soros has been a frequent critic of [[Israeli government]] policy, and does not consider himself a Zionist, but there is no evidence that he or his family holds any special hostility or opposition to the existence of the state of Israel. This report will show that their support, and that of the Open Society Foundation, has nevertheless gone to organizations with such agendas." The report says its objective is to inform OSF, claiming: "The evidence demonstrates that Open Society funding contributes significantly to anti-Israel campaigns in three important respects:

# Active in the [[Durban strategy]];
# Funding aimed at weakening United States support for Israel by shifting public opinion regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and Iran;
# Funding for Israeli political opposition groups on the fringes of Israeli society, which use the rhetoric of human rights to advocate for marginal political goals."

The report concludes, "Yet, to what degree Soros, his family, and the Open Society Foundation are aware of the cumulative impact on Israel and of the political warfare conducted by many of their beneficiaries is an open question."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ngo-monitor.org/books/bad_investment_the_philanthropy_of_george_soros_and_the_arab_israeli_conflict/ ''Bad Investment: The Philanthropy of George Soros and the Arab-Israeli Conflict: How Soros-funded Groups Increase Tensions in a Troubled Region''], Alexander H. Joffe, Professor Gerald M. Steinberg, May 1, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, [[Russia]] banned the activities of the Open Society Foundations on its territory, declaring "It was found that the activity of the Open Society Foundations and the Open Society Institute Assistance Foundation represents a threat to the foundations of the constitutional system of the [[Russian Federation]] and the security of the state".&lt;ref&gt;Reuters.

November 30, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Open Society Foundations and other NGOs that promote open government and help refugees have been targeted for crackdowns by authoritarian governments who have been emboldened by encouraging signals from the [[Trump Administration]]. Several politicians in eastern Europe, including [[Liviu Dragnea]] in [[Romania]] and typically right-wing figures [[Szilard Nemeth (politician)|Szilard Nemeth]]  in [[Hungary]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]'s [[Nikola Gruevski]], who called for a "de-Sorosization" of society, and [[Poland]]'s [[Jaroslaw Kaczynski]], who has said that Soros-funded groups want "societies without identity", regard many of the NGO groups to be irritants at best, and threats at worst.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|title=After Trump Win, Anti-Soros Forces Are Emboldened in Eastern Europe|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/01/world/europe/after-trump-win-anti-soros-forces-are-emboldened-in-eastern-europe.html?_r=0|accessdate=March 3, 2017|work=The New York Times|date=March 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of those Soros-funded advocacy groups in the region say the renewed attacks are harassment and intimidation, which became more open after the election of [[Donald Trump]] in the United States. Stefania Kapronczay of the Hungarian Civil Liberties Union, which receives half of its funding from Soros-backed foundations, claims that Hungarian officials are "testing the waters" in an effort to see "what they can get away with."&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

In May 2018, Open Society Foundations announced they will move its office from Budapest to [[Berlin]], amid Hungarian government interference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/05/george-soros-foundation-close-office-repressive-hungary-180515160314017.html | title=George Soros foundation to close office in 'repressive' Hungary &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; al Jazeera}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44082976 | title=Soros foundation to leave Hungary| work=BBC News| date=May 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/05/15/soros-foundation-close-office-budapest-hungarian-governments/ | title=Soros foundation to close office in Budapest over Hungarian government's 'repressive' policies| newspaper=The Telegraph| date=May 15, 2018| last1=Agency| first1=Reuters News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2018, Open Society Foundations announced they are ceasing operations in [[Turkey]] and closing their [[İstanbul]] and [[Ankara]] offices due to "false accusations and speculations beyond measure", amid pressure from Turkish government and governmental interference through detainment of Turkish intellectuals and liberal academics claimed to be associated with the foundation and related NGOs, associations and programmes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Açık Toplum Vakfı Türkiye'deki faaliyetlerini sonlandırıyor |url=https://www.dw.com/tr/a%C3%A7%C4%B1k-toplum-vakf%C4%B1-t%C3%BCrkiyedeki-faaliyetlerini-sonland%C4%B1r%C4%B1yor/a-46457377 |accessdate=27 November 2018 |publisher=Deutsche Welle Türkçe |date=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/11/soros-foundation-close-turkey-bashed-erdogan-181127061557606.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/nov/26/george-soross-open-society-foundation-to-pull-out-of-turkey&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Panthays''' form a group of [[Islam in China|Chinese Muslims]] in [[Burma]]. Some people refer to Panthays as the oldest group of Chinese [[Islam in Burma|Muslims in Burma]]. However, because of intermixing and cultural diffusion the Panthays are not as distinct a group as they once were.

==Etymology==
''Panthay'' ({{MYname|MY=ပန်းသေးလူမျိုး|MLCTS=pan: se: lu myui:}}; {{lang-zh|潘泰}}) is a term used to refer to the predominantly Muslim [[Hui people]] of [[China]] who migrated to Burma. They are among the largest groups of [[Burmese Chinese]], and predominantly reside in the northern regions of Burma (formerly known as Upper Burma), particularly in the [[Tangyan, Burma|Tangyan]]-[[Maymyo]]-[[Mandalay]]-[[Taunggyi]] area and [[Shan States]].

The name ''Panthay'' is a [[Burmese language|Burmese]] word, which is said to be identical with the [[Shan language|Shan]] word ''Pang hse''.&lt;ref&gt;(Scott, 1900, 607)&lt;/ref&gt; It was the name by which the Burmese called the Chinese Muslims who came with caravans to Burma from the Chinese province of [[Yunnan]]. The name was not used or known in Yunnan itself.&lt;ref&gt;(Yule &amp; Burnell, 1968, 669)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Although the term ''Panthay'' has been used to refer to Muslims in China, notably by a Karachi researcher{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}, such use is modern and derived from Burma.&lt;/ref&gt; The predominant Muslim ethnic group living in Yunnan are the Hui (回族) and refer to themselves as Hui or Huihui, but never Panthay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-RQIAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA251&amp;dq=hui+circumcision&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=WxsxTcrONpLegQeLs43XCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAzgU#v=onepage&amp;q=hui%20circumcision&amp;f=false|title=The River of golden sand, condensed by E.C. Baber, ed. by H. Yule|author=William John Gill|year=1883|location=|page=251|isbn=0-582-80671-2|pages=|accessdate=2011-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/features/EthnicGroups/136917.htm|title=The Hui Ethnic Group|website=China.org.cn|accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several theories have been suggested as to its derivation, but none of them is strong enough to refute the others. The Burmese word [[Pathi]] is a corruption of [[Persian language|Persian]]. The Burmese of Old Burma called their own indigenous Muslims ''Pathi''. It was applied to all Muslims other than the Chinese Muslims. The name Panthay is still applied exclusively to the Chinese Muslims. However Chinese Muslims in Yunnan did not call themselves Panthay. They called themselves ''Huizu'' (回族), meaning Muslim in Chinese. Non-Muslim Chinese and Westerners refer to them as ''Huihui'' (回回).

Insofar as can be ascertained, the application of the term "Panthay" to Yunnanese Muslims (and, subsequently, to Burmese Muslims of Yunnanese origin) dates from about this time; certainly it was widely employed by British travelers and diplomats in the region from about 1875, and seems to have arisen as a corruption of the Burmese word ''pa-the'' meaning simply "Muslim". A considerable body of literature exists surrounding the etymology of this term, but the definitive notice (which remains, as yet, unpublished). Indicated that it was introduced by Sladen at the time of his 1868 expedition to Teng-yueh, and that it represents an anglicised and shortened version of the Burmese tarup pase, or "Chinese Muslim".

In fact, the term "Panthay" was never employed by the Yunnanese Muslims (whether of China or of Burma) who prefer simply to call themselves Hui-min or Hui-hui; nor did it, apparently, enjoy widespread usage amongst the Burmese, Shan, [[Karen people|Karen]] or other Burmese peoples. Be that as it may, however – and according to some the designation is virtually unused within Burma today - the term "Panthay" achieved widespread usage during the period of British rule, and remains the name by which Burma's Chinese Muslim community has generally been distinguished in English language sources to the present day.

The origin of Panthay as documented in a book named "Panthay History" written by Ming Kuan-Shih (明光熙) while he was alive in Maymyo as: the families of some loyal lieutenants led by Mah Lin-Gi (馬靈驥) of the reputable late Hui General '''Du Wenxiu''' (杜文秀; [[pinyin]]: Dù Wénxiù) (1823–1872), who led those perilous fights against the Qing Empire jointly with its Christian ally Taipin-Tienkuo failed, and to escape from massacre by the Qing Empire, they had no choice but had to flee to Burma for refuge.

Settled down in [[Wa States|Wa region]] at Northern Shan State, Ma Lin-Gi divorced with his wife of surname Yuan and married a widow of surname Ting. They later had two sons, the elder named Mah Mei-Ting (馬美廷) born in 1878 and the second son named Mah Shen-Ting (馬陞廷) born in 1879 respectively. The elder son later became the leader of the Panthay community there.

==Culture==
[[File:Panthay mosque, Mandalay, Myanmar.JPG|thumb|right|220px|Panthay mosque, Mandalay]]Eager to establish close and friendly relations with all the neighboring states, the Sultan Suleiman of Yunnan wasted no time in seizing the opportunity of having a Chinese Muslim mosque installed at the Burmese King's capital. He at once sent out Colonel Mah Too-tu, one of his senior military officers, as his special envoy and agent to Mandalay with the important mission of constructing the mosque. The mosque took about two years to finish and was opened in 1868, the second mosque to be built in the royal capital. Today, 134 years later, the Panthay Mosque is still standing as the second oldest mosque in Mandalay. [http://www.panthay.net/gallery/main.php?g2_itemId=19174]

==History==

===Early history===
Chinese-speaking, and of predominantly [[Han Chinese]] ethnic origin, this little-known group of [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslims]] of the [[Hanafi]] madhhab forms a predominantly endogamous, closely inter-related minority group in four countries – [[China]], [[Burma]], [[Thailand]] and [[Laos]] – and today represents both Islamic and Chinese cultures in northern Southeast Asia.

Commercial and cultural contacts between the [[Yunnan–Guizhou Plateau]] and the [[Irrawaddy Delta]] and lower [[Salween River]] probably predate significant migration by [[Han Chinese]] or [[Bamar people|Bamar]] populations into either area; certainly it is likely that by the time of the [[Han dynasty|Later Han dynasty]]  (25-220 CE), itinerant traders and Buddhist pilgrims traversed this marginal region of the Sino-Indian cultural frontier on a regular if infrequent basis. By early Tang times, Chinese control over western Yunnan was established for the first time with the submission of the population of the [[Erhai Lake]] region near [[Dali City]] in 672 and the extension of the Imperial Mandate to the region of the present-day Yunnan-Burma frontier some twenty-two later, in 694. This Han Chinese dominance was to be short-lived, however; within forty-five years – about 738 – the [[Yi people|Yi]] state of [[Nanzhao]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aung-Thwin|first1=Michael A.|title=The mists of Rāmañña: the Legend that was Lower Burma|date=2005|publisher=University of Hawai'i Press|location=Honolulu|isbn=0-8248-2886-0|pages=7|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; had emerged as the dominant power of the Yunnan-Burma frontier region, a position which both it and its successor, the [[Dali Kingdom]], were to hold until the Mongol conquest of the region five centuries later.

Despite the political independence of Nanzhao, Chinese cultural influence continued to penetrate and influence the Yunnan-Burma frontier region throughout the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] and [[Song dynasty|Song]] dynasties. Moreover, it is possible that during the mid-Tang period – in about 801 –  surrendered Muslim soldiers, described in the ''Chinese Annals'' as the ''Hēiyī Dàshí'' ({{zh|c=黑依大食|p=Hēiyī Dàshí}}, "Black-clad ''[[Tayy|Tay'ī]]'', a term referring to the black flags of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Biran|first1=Michal|title=Qarakhanid Studies|journal=Cahiers d’Asie centrale|date=2001|volume=9|url=http://asiecentrale.revues.org/619|pages=77–89|accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) were first settle in Yunnan.

Whilst this early settlement remains in some doubt, however, it is at least certain that Muslims of [[Central Asia]]n origin played a major role in the Yuan conquest and subsequent rule of [[Southwest China]], as a result of which a distinct Muslim community was established in Yunnan by the late 13th century. Foremost amongst these soldier-administrators was [[Sayyid Ajjal Shams al-Din Omar]], a court official and general of Turkic origin who participated in the Mongol invasion of [[Sichuan]] and [[Yunnan]] in c. 1252, and who became Yuan Governor of the latter province in 1274–79. Hisson Nasir-al-Din was in charge of the road systems of Yunnan and personally commanded the first Mongol invasion of Bagan in 1277–78. And his younger brother Hushin (Husayn) was Transport Commissioner in 1284 and later Senior Governor of Yunnan.&lt;ref&gt;(Ba Shin, 1961, 2)&lt;/ref&gt; Shams al-Din – who is widely believed by the Muslims of Yunnan to have introduced Islam to the region – is represented as a wise and benevolent ruler, who successfully "pacified and comforted" the people of Yunnan, and who is credited with building [[Temple of Confucius|temples of Confucius]] as well as [[mosque]]s and schools. On his death he was succeeded by his eldest son, [[Nasr al-Din (Yunnan)|Nasir al-Din]] (the "Nescradin" of [[Marco Polo]]), who governed Yunnan from 1279-84.

During Shams al-Din’s governorship of Yunnan, Nasir al-Din was first appointed Commissioner of Roads for the province and then, in 1277–8, appointed to command the first Mongol invasion of Burma. Leading to the overthrow of the Pagan Dynasty. Subsequently, during Nasir al-Din’s governorship, his younger brother Husayn (the third son of Sayyid al-Ajal Shams al-Din) was appointed Transport Commissioner for the province. As a result of the pre-eminence of Shams al-Din and his family during this period, a significant number of Muslim soldiers of Central Asian origin were transferred to the Dali region of western Yunnan – an area still largely unpopulated by Han Chinese settlers – and the descendants of these garrison troops, who participated in a number of Mongol invasions of Burmese territory during the Yuan period, form the nucleus of the present-day Chinese Muslim population both in Yunnan and Burma.

Over the next five hundred years this nascent Yunnanese Muslim community established itself in a position of economic and demographic strength in southern and western Yunnan – though there are few indications of significant settlement in Burmese territory before [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] times and acquired a distinctive ethnic identity through intermarriage with the local population, a process paralleled in areas of Muslim settlement elsewhere in China. Thus, following the demise of the Abbasids in 1258 and the related rise of the Mongols in China, the term ''Dashi'' (as applied loosely both to foreign Muslims and to those settled within China) disappeared from the ''Chinese Annals'' and was gradually replaced by a new term, [[Hui people|''Hui'']] or ''Huihui'', giving rise in turn to the modern Chinese term ''Huizu'', the recognised contemporary designation for China's Chinese-speaking Muslim minority.

===Muslim Settlement of Yunnan===
Within Yunnan, the Hui Muslim population seems to have flourished and expanded throughout the Yuan and Ming periods (c. 1280–1644). Certainly when Marco Polo visited Yunnan in the early Yuan, he noted the presence of "Saracens" amongst the population, whilst the Persian historian [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani]] (died 1318) recorded in the ''[[Jami' al-tawarikh]]'' that "the great city of Yachi" in Yunnan was exclusively inhabited by Muslims. Rashid al-Din may have been referring to the region around Dali in western Yunnan, which was to emerge as the earliest centre of Hui settlement in the province, though other areas of significant Muslim settlement were subsequently established in north-western Yunnan around Chao-t'ung by the Emperor Jen-tsung in about 1313 as well as – much later on, during the Qing Dynasty – in and around [[Qianshui]] in southeastern Yunnan.

The history of the Panthays in Burma was inseparably linked to that of Yunnan, their place of origin, whose population was predominantly Muslim. The Chinese Muslims of Yunnan were noted for their mercantile prowess. Within Yunnan, the Muslim population excelled as merchants and soldiers, the two qualities, which made them ideally suited to the rigors of overland trade in the rugged, mountainous regions, and to deserve the rewards therefrom. They might have been helped in this by their religion of' Islam from its inception had flourished as a Religion of Trade. The religious requirement to perform Hajj pilgrimage had also helped them to establish an overland road between Yunnan and Arabia as early as the first half of the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;(Forbes, 1987, 292)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the first decades of the 19th century, population pressures on the Hui Muslim and other minority peoples of Yunnan increased substantially as a result of Han Chinese migration to the province. Resentment against this development, coupled with mounting hostility towards Qing rule, led in 1855 to the [[Panthay Rebellion]] among Muslim miners in the Qianshui region. Within two years, however, the center of rebellion had spread to the west of the province under the leadership of [[Du Wenxiu]]. For the next fifteen years, until the Qing reconquest, Dali remained the capital of the "Country of the peaceful South", where Du erected a Forbidden City, wore Ming [[hanfu]] in repudiation of Qing authority, and is reported by some sources to have adopted the Muslim name and title "Sultan Sulayman".

===Panthay rebellion in Yunnan===
{{Main|Panthay Rebellion}}
[[File:Panthay men.jpg|thumb|Panthay men in British Burma.]]
Several uprisings involving Hui and Han such as the [[Dungan Revolt (1862–77)]] and the Panthay Rebellion broke out in several regions of China. The unfavorable discrimination with which the Hui were treated by the Han and by the imperial administration was at the root of their rebellions. The Panthay Rebellion began out of a conflict between Han and Hui tin miners in 1853, which degenerated into rebellion. In the following year, a massacre of Hui was organized by local Qing officials in Yunnan responsible for suppressing the revolt. One of the leaders of the insurrection was the scholar [[Yusuf Ma Dexin]]. Anxious to increase his own influence, Yusuf Ma Dexin finally agreed to submit to the Qing in 1861.&lt;ref name=chineseciv&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gernet|first1=Jacques|title=A history of Chinese civilization|date=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0-521-49712-4|edition=2. ed., repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded by [[Du Wenxiu]] ({{zh|t=杜文秀|p=Dù Wénxiù}}, 1823–72), a Hui born in [[Yongcheng]]. Du Wenxiu's father was a Han who converted to Islam.

Starting from 1855 the Hui of Yunnan had risen against the oppression to which they were subjected by the mandarins. They rose against the tyranny and extortion universally practiced by this official class, from which they were excluded. The mandarins had secretly hounded mobs on to the rich Panthays, provoked anti-Hui riots and instigated destruction of their mosques.&lt;ref name="Anderson, 1876, 233"&gt;(Anderson, 1876, 233)&lt;/ref&gt; The revolt was not religious in nature, since the Muslims were joined by non-Muslim [[Shan people|Shan]] and [[Kachin people]] and other hill tribes in the revolt.&lt;ref name="fytche_300"&gt;{{harvnb|Fytche|1878|p=300}}&lt;/ref&gt; A British officer testified that the Muslims did not rebel for religious reasons and that the Chinese were tolerant of different religions and were unlikely to have caused the revolt by interfering with the practicing of Islam.&lt;ref name="fytche_301"&gt;{{harvnb|Fytche|1878|p=301}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, loyalist Muslim forces helped Qing crush the rebel Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5LSvkQvvmAMC&amp;pg=PA283&amp;dq=arab+mercenaries+china&amp;q=arab+mercenaries+china&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=yunnan%20rebellion%20loyalist&amp;f=false|title=The religious traditions of Asia: religion, history, and culture|author=Joseph Mitsuo Kitagawa|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|location=|page=283|isbn=0-7007-1762-5|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rebellion started as a local uprising. It was sparked off by the Panthay laborers of the silver mines of Lin'an village in Yunnan who rose up against the Qing. The Chinese Governor of Yunnan sent an urgent appeal to the central government in Beijing. The Imperial Government was handicapped by problems that cropped up in profusion in various parts of the sprawling empire.

They repulsed the desultory attacks of the imperial troops. They wrested one important city after another from the hands of' the Imperial mandarins. The Chinese towns and villages which resisters were pillaged, and the male population massacred. All the places, which yielded, were spared.&lt;ref name="Anderson, 1876, 233"/&gt; The ancient holy city of Dali fell to the Panthays in 1857. With the capture of Dali, Muslim supremacy became an established fact in Yunnan.

Du Wenxiu was originally not aiming his rebellion at Han, but was anti-Qing and wanted to destroy the Manchu government. During the revolt Hui from provinces which were not in rebellion, like Sichuan and Zhejiang, served as negotiators between rebel Hui and the Qing government. One of Du Wenxiu's banners said "Deprive the Manchu Qing of their Mandate to Rule" (革命滿清), and he called on Han to assist Hui to overthrow the Manchu regime and drive them out of China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BwuSpFiOFfYC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=du+wenxiu+han&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=pu2zTL6eNIL48AbPoqjGCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=du%20wenxiu%20han&amp;f=false|title=China's Muslim Hui community: migration, settlement and sects|author=Michael Dillon|year=1999|publisher=Curzon Press|location=Richmond|page=59|isbn=0-7007-1026-4|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Da2M_viEclEC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;dq=du+wenxiu+anti+han&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Re2zTLCeL8P98Aac8onJCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=du%20wenxiu%20anti%20han&amp;f=false|title=The Chinese sultanate: Islam, ethnicity, and the Panthay Rebellion in southwest China, 1856-1873|author=David G.

The [[Gedimu]] Hanafi Sunni Muslims under Ma Rulong readily defected to Qing, while the [[Jahriyya]] [[Sufi]] Muslims did not surrender. Some of the Jahriyya rebels in the Panthay Rebellion like Ma Shenglin were related to the Dungan revolt Jahriyya leader [[Ma Hualong]] and maintained contact with them.

The "Islamic Kingdom of Yunnan" was proclaimed after the fall of Tali-fu ([[Dali City]]). Du Wenxiu, leader of the Panthays, assumed the regnal title of Sultan Suleiman and made Tali-fu his capital. In this way, the Sultanate, fashioned after those of' the Middle East, appeared in Yunnan. Panthay governorships were also created in a few important cities, such as Momein (Tengyueh), which were a few stages from the Burmese border town of Bhamo. The Panthays reached the highwater mark of their power and glory in 1860.

The eight years from 1860 to 1868 were the heyday of the Sultanate. The Panthays had either taken or destroyed forty towns and one hundred villages.&lt;ref&gt;(Anderson, 1876, 343)&lt;/ref&gt; During this period the Sultan Suleiman, on his way to Mecca as a pilgrim, visited Rangoon, presumably via the Kengtung route, and from there to Calcutta where he had a chance to see the power of the British colonists. &lt;ref&gt;(Anderson, 1876, 242)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Panthay power declined after 1868. The Chinese Imperial Government had succeeded in reinvigorating itself. By 1871, it was directing a campaign for the annihilation of the obdurate Panthays of Yunnan. By degrees the Imperial Government had tightened the cordon around the Panthays. The Panthay Kingdom proved unstable as soon as the Imperial Government made a regular and determined attack on it. Town after town fell under well-organized attacks made by the imperial troops. Tali-fu itself was besieged by the imperial Chinese. Sultan Suleiman found himself caged in by the walls of his capital. He now desperately looked for outside help. He turned to the British colonists for military assistance.&lt;ref name="Thaung, 1961, 481"&gt;(Thaung, 1961, 481)&lt;/ref&gt; He imagined that only British military intervention could have saved the Panthays.

The Sultan had reasons for his turning to the British colonists for military aid. He had seen the British might in India on his pilgrimage to Mecca some years earlier, and was impressed by it. Britain was the only western power with whom the Sultanate was on friendly terms and had contacts with. The British authorities in India and British Burma had sent a mission led by Major Sladen to Momien from May to July 1868. The Sladen mission had stayed seven weeks at Momien. The main purpose of the mission was to revive the Ambassador Route between Bhamo and Yunnan and resuscitate border trade, which had almost ceased since 1855 mainly because of the Panthay rebellion.

Taking advantage of the friendly relations resulting from Sladen's visit, Sultan Suleiman now, in his fight for the survival of the Panthay Kingdom, turned to the British for the vitally, needed military assistance. In 1872 he sent his adopted son Prince Hassan, to England, with a personal letter to Queen Victoria, via Burma, requesting British military assistance. The Hassan Mission was accorded courtesy and hospitality in both British Burma and England. However, the British colonists refused to intervene militarily in Yunnan against Peking.&lt;ref name="Thaung, 1961, 481"/&gt; The mission was a failure. While Hassan and his party were abroad, Tali-fu was captured by the Imperial troops in January 1873.

The Imperial Government had waged an all-out war against the Panthays with the help of French artillery experts.&lt;ref name="Thaung, 1961, 481"/&gt; Their modern equipment, trained personnel and numerical superiority were no match for the ill-equipped Panthays with no allies. Thus, in less than two decades of its rise, the power of the Panthays in Yunnan fell. But the Chinese suffered the loss of more than 20,000 lives in various fights.&lt;ref&gt;(Anderson, 1876, 243)&lt;/ref&gt; Seeing no escape and no mercy from his relentless foe, Sultan Suleiman tried to take his own life before the fall of' Tali-fu. But, before the poison he drank took effect fully, he was beheaded by his enemies. The Sultan's head was preserved in honey and then dispatched to the Imperial Court in Peking as a trophy and a testimony to the decisive nature of the victory of the Imperial Chinese over the Pantliays of Yunnan.&lt;ref&gt;(Thaung, 1961, 482)&lt;/ref&gt;

The scattered remnants of the Panthay troops continue their resistance after the fall of Tali-fu. But when Momien was next besieged and stormed by the imperial troops in May 1873, their resistance broke completely. Governor Ta-sa-kon was captured and executed by the order of the Imperial Government.

Many adherents to the Panthay cause were persecuted by the imperial mandarins.  Many Panthays thus fled with their families across the Burmese border and took refuge in the Wa State where, about 1875, they set up the exclusively Panthay town of [[Panlong Subtownship|Panglong]].&lt;ref&gt;(Scott, 1901, 740)&lt;/ref&gt;

For a period of perhaps ten to fifteen years following the collapse of the Yunnan Muslim Rebellion, the province's Hui minority was widely discriminated against by the victorious Qing, especially in the western frontier districts contiguous with Burma. During these years the refugee Hui settled across the frontier within Burma gradually established themselves in their traditional callings – as merchants, caravaneers, miners, restaurateurs and (for those who chose or were forced to live beyond the law) as smugglers and mercenaries.

At least 15 years after the collapse of the Yunnan Muslim Rebellion, the original Panthay settlements had grown to include numbers of Shan and other hill peoples.

===Panthays during Konbaung period===
Beginning from the late Konbaung period, the Panthays started to settle in the royal capital of Mandalay, particularly during the reign of King Mindon. Although their number was small, a few of them seemed to have found their way inside the court as jade-assessors. They lived side by side with non-Muslim Chinese at Chinatowns (''tayoke tan''), which had been designated by King Mindon as the residential area for the Chinese. The non-Muslim Chinese had started settling in Mandalay considerably earlier than the Panthays so that by the time the latter arrived, there already was a Chinese community at Mandalay, with their own bank, companies and warehouses and some kind of organized social and economic life.

It happened that there were also Chinese jade-assessors in the employ of the king. Rivalry between the Chinese and Panthay jade-assessors in courting the royal favor naturally led to a quarrel between the two groups, resulting in a number of deaths.&lt;ref&gt;(Interview with U Aung Myint)&lt;/ref&gt; King Mindon had not given much serious thought to the religious and social differences between the Panthays and the Chinese. He had treated the two more or less alike. But after the Chinadown quarrel, the king began to see the wisdom of separating the two groups.

===King Mindon and Panthays===
 [[File:Panthay mosque.JPG|thumb|Panthay Mosque ({{lang|zh|清真寺}}; Qīngzhēn Sì) in Mandalay]]
It was also during this time that King Mindon granted the Panthays of the royal capital land on which to settle as a separate community, with a view to preventing further quarrels between them and the Chinese. The Panthays were given the rare favor of choosing their own place of residence within the confines of the royal capital, and they chose the site on which the present-day Panthay Compound (Chinese Muslim Quarter) is located. It was bounded on the north by 35th Street, in the south by 36th Street, in the east by 79th Street and in the west by 80th Street. This site was chosen because it was the camping ground for the mule caravans from Yunnan, which regularly came to the capital via the Theinni route.

The broadminded King Mindon also permitted a mosque to be built on the granted site so that the Panthays would have their own place of worship. Having no funds for an undertaking of such magnitude, the Panthays of Mandalay put up the matter to the Sultan of Yunnan. Sultan Sulaiman had already started a business enterprise (''hao'') in Mandalay.

His company was housed in a one-story brick building located at the present-day Taryedan on the west side of the 80th Street, between 36th and 37th Streets.&lt;ref&gt;(Interview with Haji U Ba Thi alias Haji Adam (born 11 October 1908) a Panthay elder who had served for many years as chairman of the Trust of 'the Panthay Mosque, on 15 October 1997.)&lt;/ref&gt; The ''hao'' had been carrying on business in precious stones, jades, cotton, silk and other commodities of both Chinese and Burmese origins.

===Diaspora===
{{see also|Wa States#History}}
The demise of the Sultanate had shattered the hopes of all the Panthays for their own Islamic kingdom in Yunnan. The blood-bath that occurred in its wake had made the decision for many Panthays: to flee the country for those who could make it, and not to return to Yunnan for those who were already outside. Colonel Mah Too-tu found himself in the same situation. When the Sultanate fell, Mah Too-tu was stranded at Mandalay. For a man of his rank and stature, going back to Tali-fu meant sure execution by the Manchu authorities. Mah Too-tu had no other alternative but to settle down in Mandalay. In November 1868 he had bought a plot of land with a house on it for 80 pieces of one-kyat coins from Khunit Ywa-sa Princess.&lt;ref&gt;(Family Parabaik)&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 June 1873, Mah Too-tu married Shwe Gwe, a lady from Sagyin-wa village near Amarapura, who happened to be the daughter of a princess of Manipur brought to Mandalay as a captive by the Burmese king.&lt;ref&gt;(Than Tun, 1968, 19)&lt;/ref&gt; Mah Too-tu spent the last years of his life at the Panthay Compound with his Burmese wife.

After the mass exodus from Yunnan, the number of Panthays residing in Mandalay gradually increased. The new arrivals, usually families, came by way of Bhamo or via the Wa State. When the land for the Panthays was granted by King Mindon, there were a few houses on it, in addition to several old graves.&lt;ref&gt;(Interview with Haji U Ba Thi)&lt;/ref&gt; This shows that the place had been an abandoned graveyard. In the years immediately following the completion of the mosque, the number of houses in the Panthay Compound was less than twenty. There were also between ten and twenty Panthay households living in other parts of Mandalay. But a trickle of new arrivals added to their number.

The establishment of the Panthay Mosque in 1868 marked the emergence of the Chinese Muslims as a distinct community at Mandalay. Although the number of this first generation of Panthays remained small, the Mosque, which is still standing, constitutes a historic landmark. It signifies the beginning of the first Panthay Jama'at (Congregation) in Mandalay Ratanabon Naypyidaw.

===Early 20th century===
{{see also|Panlong Subtownship}}
Over the next thirty or so years the Panthays of Panglong continues to prosper, though by the early 1920s a feud had begun to develop between them and the Was of neighbouring Pankawn. In 1926 this erupted into the local "Wa Panthay War", in which the latter were victorious and as a result of which Panglong threw off its vassalage to Pangkawn and reinforced its dominance over the trade routes of the region31. In addition to legitimate trading, by this time the Panthays, of Panglong were securely established as 'the aristocrats of the opium business' in the region now commonly designated the [[Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia)|Golden Triangle]], leaving the Petty and risky business of peddlings this highly profitable commodity locally to Shan and Han Chinese dealers, and instead running large, well-armed caravans in long-distance convoys far into Siam, Laos, Tonking and Yunnan. When Harvey visited Panglong in 1931 he found that Panthay numbers had risen to 5,000 ('including local recruits'), that they were financed by [[Chinese Singaporean|Singaporean Chinese]], had 130 mauser rifles with 1,500 mules, and exported opium by the hundredweight into French, Siamese and British territory, each muleload escorted by two riflemen.

Meanwhile, despite the relative importance of Panglong and the profits to be made from the long-distance caravan, other Panthays moved further into Burma, initially as miners anxious to exploit the ruby mines of Mogok; the Badwin silver mines of Namtu in the Northern Shan State, the jade mines of Mogaung in Kachin State. Numbers of Panthay restaurateurs and innkeepers, merchants and traders settled in the urban centres of upland Burma – chiefly at Lashio, Kengtung, Bhamo and Taunggyi – to service the needs of these miners, passing caravaneers and the local inhabitants, whilst other settlements largely devoted to trade with the indigenous Shan and Karen populations sprang up along the [[Salween River]]. Finally, other Panthay elements moved to the major urban centres of the Burmese lowlands, most notably to Mandalay and Rangoon, where they flourished as merchants and representatives of their up – country fellows, as well as middle-men between Panglong and the other "Overland Chinese" settlements of Upper Burma and the "Overseas Chinese" community of the lowland port-cities. Bassein and [[Mawlamyaing|Moulmein]] must also have attracted some Panthay settlement, the latter port being a terminus of the overland caravan trade from Yunnan in its own right, via the northern Thai trade route through [[Kengtung]], [[Chiang Mai]] and [[Mae Sariang]].

During the greater part of the period of [[British Raj|British rule in Burma]] these Panthay settlers flourished, specialising in all levels of commerce from the international [[Gemstone|gem]] markets to shop – and inn-keeping, mule-breeding and peddling or hawking – indeed Yunnanese peddlars (who may or may not have been Muslim) even penetrated into the unadministered and inaccessible hill tracts of "The Triangle" between Mali Hka and Nmai Hka, to the north of Myitkyina. Chiefly, however, beyond the urban centres of the Burmese lowlands, the Panthays continued their involvement in the caravan trade with Yunnan, transporting silk, tea, metal goods and foodstuffs (eggs, fruit, nut and even the renowned Yunnanese hams (doubtless for consumption by their Han fellow countrymen) from China to Burma, and carrying back European manufactured goods, broadcloths, specialised foodstuffs (edible birds nests, sea slugs) and above all raw cotton, to Yunnan.

In 1931 Harvey estimated the population of Panglong (which was predominantly Panthay) at 5,000 persons. Yet official estimates put the Panthay population of Burma at 2,202 for 1911 (1,427 males and 775 females), whilst by the 1921 Census of India this had declined to 1,517 (1,076 males and 441 females), and by 1931 to 1,106 (685 males and 421 females).

===World War II and independence===
A Census for 1941 was never taken, being interrupted by [[World War II]] and the Japanese invasion; indeed, it was as a result of the Japanese invasion the main Panthay settlement at Panglong was destroyed, and many Panthay fled to Yunnan, or crossed the largely unpoliced jungle frontiers into Thailand and Laos to escape Japanese persecution. The traditional dominance of Panthay in the trade of the Burma-Yunnan frontier region was also set back by the construction of the [[Burma Road]] between [[Lashio]] and [[Kunming]] in 1937–38, and by the exodus of thousands of Yunnanese refugees and [[Kuomintang]] troops following the seizure of power by the [[Chinese Communists]] in 1949. As a result of these developments, which brought a flood of predominantly Han, and not Hui, "Overland Chinese" to the Burmese Shan States, many Panthay seem to have chosen to migrate to northern Thailand, where their communities continue to flourish.

[[Panlong Subtownship|Panglong]], a Chinese Muslim town in [[British rule in Burma|British Burma]], was entirely destroyed by the Japanese invaders in the [[Japanese invasion of Burma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Forbes  |first=Andrew |last2=Henley |first2=David  |date=December 2015 |title=’Saharat Tai Doem’ Thailand in Shan State, 1941–45 |url=http://www.cpamedia.com/article.php?pg=archive&amp;acid=120518152031&amp;aiid=120529165129 |work=CPA Media |location= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Forbes  |first=Andrew  |date=2002 |title=A Forgotten Invasion: Thailand in Shan State, 1941-45  |url=https://forum.axishistory.com//viewtopic.php?f=65&amp;t=60485&amp;start=30 |work=This article was originally published in the Bangkok Post. |location= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Hui Ma Guanggui became the leader of the Hui Panglong self defense guard created by Su who was sent by the [[Kuomintang]] government of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] to fight against the Japanese invasion of Panglong in 1942. The Japanese destroyed Panglong, burning it and driving out the over 200 Hui households out as refugees. Yunnan and Kokang received Hui refugees from Panglong driven out by the Japanese.

No comprehensive census of the remaining Panthay population within Burma has been taken since 1931, and restrictions on travel for foreigners, combined with the inherent weakness of central government control over those outlying areas of the Shan and Kachin Hills where many Panthays live, makes any attempt to calculate Burma's present (1986) Panthay population almost impossible (though an exaggerated estimate of 100,000 Panthays resident within Burma appeared in the Burmese daily ''Hanthawaddi'' in 1960. Certainly readily identifiable Panthay communities continue to exist in several areas which are open to foreign travel (Rangoon, Mandalay, Taunggyi), as well as, by report, in Kengtung, Bhamo, Mogok, Lashio and at Tanyan, near Lashio. Wherever they have settled in sufficient numbers, the Panthays have established their own mosques and madrasas (for example the Panthay Balee at Mandalay Short Lane, Rangoon, at Mandalay and in [[Myitkyina]]). Some of these mosques are in "pseudo-Moghul" style, clearly having been influenced by Indian Muslim tastes and styles, whilst others (notably at Mandalay) have Chinese architectural features. As with the Hui in China, the Burmese Panthay are exclusively [[Hanafi]]; few are conversant with more than the most elementary phrases of [[Arabic language|Arabic]], and quite often when a Panthay imam is not available to care for the spiritual welfare of a community, a South Asian and Zerbadi Muslim is engaged instead. [[Zerbadi Muslims]] are descendent community of intermarriages between foreign [[Muslim]] ([[South Asia]]n and [[Middle East]]ern) males and Burmese females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=wNYUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA168&amp;lpg=PA168&amp;dq=Zerbadi+Muslim&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ugDZmr0-ns&amp;sig=pp0b_WEI2Jub4A9TL6cQ8H08fpg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jrZ5T7KFM4fo0QH1o5TZDQ&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Zerbadi+Muslim&amp;f=false|title=Islam in South-East Asia|first=Michael Barry|last=Hooker|date=1 January 1983|publisher=Brill Archive|accessdate=17 August 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present Panthays in Burma==
Panthays are spread over many parts of Burma with their mosques in Yangon, Taungyi, Lashio, Tangyang, Kyaington, Pyin-Oo-Lwin, Myitkyina and Mogok.&lt;ref&gt;Message from Maung Ko Ghaffari, Chief Editor, Light of Islam Magazine, Burma in Feb. 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Panthay caravaners==
In the pre-colonial times the Panthays emerged as excellent long-distance caravaneers of southern China and northern Southeast Asia. They had virtually dominated whole caravan trade of Yunnan. By the time the first agents and adventurous pioneers the French and British imperialism arrived at the fringes of Yunnan, they found the caravan network of the region dominated by the Chinese Muslim muleteers.

The Chinese Muslim domination of the Yunnan caravan network seems to have continued well into the 20th century. By the mid 19th century the caravans of' Yunnanese traders ranged over an area extending from the eastern frontiers of Tibet, through Assam, Burma, [[Thailand]], [[Laos]] and [[Tongkin]] (presently part of Vietnam), to the southern Chinese provinces of [[Sichuan]], [[Guizhou]] and [[Guangxi]].

The merchandise brought from Yunnan by the Panthay caravaneers included silk cloth, tea, metal utensils, iron in the rough, felts, finished articles of' clothing, walnuts, opium, wax, preserved fruits and foods, and dried meat of' several kinds. The Burmese goods taken back to Yunnan were raw cotton, raw and wrought silk, amber, jades and other precious stones, velvets, betel-nuts, tobacco, gold-leaf', preserves, paps, dye woods, stick lac, ivory, and specialized foodstuffs such as slugs, edible birds’ nests, among other things.&lt;ref&gt;(Anderson, 1876, 4)&lt;/ref&gt; Raw cotton, which was reserved as a royal monopoly, was in great demand in China. An extensive trade in this commodity had existed between the Burmese kingdom and Yunnan. It was transported up the Ayeyarwaddy River to Bhamo where it was sold to the Chinese merchants, and conveyed partly by land and partly by water into Yunnan, and from there to other provinces of China. Most caravans consisted of between fifty and one hundred mules, employing ten to fifteen drivers.&lt;ref&gt;(Forbes 1987, 293)&lt;/ref&gt;

A reason for the cessation of trade by the Bhamo routes was due to King Mindon's earlier policy of confining the British to lower Burma. Mindon had feared that trade along the Bhamo route would lead to the extension of British influence to upper Burma and beyond. He did not want a fleet of British steamers to the north of the capital. He also seemed to be desirous of making Mandalay the center of trade instead of Bhamo which was difficult to control.&lt;ref&gt;(Sladen Report, 1876,5)&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, this short-sighted policy and attitude of King Mindon gradually wore out as he began to see the practical economic and political advantages of the resuscitation of Bhamo trade to his country and people. Thus, he extended all the help he could to the Sladen mission. With the Burmese monarch favorably disposed towards it, the British mission was cordially received by the Panthay Governor of Momien, Ta-sa-kon. Due to lack of' security of the roads, Sladen was not allowed to proceed to Tali-fu to discuss matters directly with the Sultan. However, the Sultan sent letters to Momien in which he expressed the desire of the Panthay government to enter into friendly relations with the British government, and to foster mutual trade. Before returning, Sladen and the Momien Governor Ta-sa-kon, as the Sultan's personal representative, signed an agreement in which the British and the Panthays pledged to foster Yunnan-Burma trade to the best of their ability. Though far from being a satisfactory treaty to both parties, the agreement had established some kind of [[de facto]] friendship between them.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12691">'''Privacy-Enhancing Technologies''' (PET) are the methods of [[Data Protection|protecting data]] in accordance with the law. PET allow [[User (computing)|online users]] to protect the [[data privacy|privacy]] of their [[personally identifiable information]] (PII) provided to and handled by services or applications. PET uses techniques to minimize possession of personal data without losing the functionality of an information system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|van Blarkom|Borking|Olk|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals of PETs==
The objective of PETs is to protect personal data and ensure the users of technology that their information is confidential and management of data protection is a priority to the organizations who withhold responsibility for any [[Personally identifiable information|PII]] - allowing users to take one or more of the following actions related to their personal data sent to and used by, online service providers, merchants or other users.

The goal of privacy-enhancing technologies include increasing control over personal data sent to, and used by, online service providers and merchants (or other online users)([[Informational self-determination|self-determination]]). PETs aim to minimize personal data collected and used by service providers and merchants, use [[Pseudonym|pseudonyms]] or anonymous data credentials to provide anonymity, and strive to achieve informed consent about giving personal data to online service providers and merchants.&lt;ref&gt;The EU PRIME research project's [https://www.prime-project.eu/about/vision/ Vision on privacy enhanced identity management] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011000720/https://www.prime-project.eu/about/vision |date=2007-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Privacy Negotiations, consumers and service providers establish, maintain, and refine privacy policies as individualized agreements through the ongoing choice among service alternatives, therefore providing the possibility to negotiate the terms and conditions of giving personal data to online service providers and merchants (data handling/privacy policy negotiation). Within private negotiations, the transaction partners may additionally bundle the personal information collection and processing schemes with monetary or non-monetary rewards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://privacy-negotiations.de Key Facts on Privacy Negotiations]&lt;/ref&gt;

PETs provide the possibility to remotely audit the enforcement of these terms and conditions at the online service providers and merchants (assurance), allow users to log, archive and look up past transfers of their personal data, including what data has been transferred, when, to whom and under what conditions, and facilitate the use of their legal rights of data inspection, correction and deletion.

==Existing PETs==
Examples of existing privacy enhancing technologies are:
* '''[[Anonymizer|Communication anonymizers]]''' hiding the real online identity (email address, IP address, etc.) and replacing it with a non-traceable identity (disposable / one-time email address, random IP address of hosts participating in an anonymising network, pseudonym, etc.). They can be applied to email, Web browsing, [[Peer-to-peer|P2P]] networking, [[Voice over IP|VoIP]], Chat, instant messaging, etc.
* '''Shared bogus online accounts'''. One person creates an account for MSN, providing bogus data for Name, address, phone number, preferences, life situation etc. They then publish their user-IDs and passwords on the Internet. Everybody can now use this account comfortably. Thereby the user is sure that there is no personal data about him or her in the account profile. (Moreover, he is freed from the hassle of having to register at the site himself.)
*  '''Obfuscation''' refers to the many practices of adding distracting or misleading data to a log or profile, which may be especially useful for frustrating precision analytics after data has already been lost or disclosed. Its effectiveness against humans is questioned, but it has greater promise against shallow algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/obfuscation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://cs.nyu.edu/trackmenot/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://arxiv.org/abs/1211.0320&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8328401/&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Access to personal data''': The service provider's infrastructure allows users to inspect, correct or delete all their data stored at the service provider.
*'''[[Enhanced privacy ID]] (EPID)''' is a [[Digital Signature Algorithm|digital signature algorithm]] supporting anonymity. Unlike traditional digital signature algorithms (e.g., [[Public key infrastructure|PKI]]), in which each entity has a unique public verification key and a unique private signature key, EPID provides a common group public verification key associated with many of unique private signature keys.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/PEC2011/presentations2011/brickell.pdf|title=Enhanced Privacy Id|last=|first=|date=December 2011|website=|publisher=|access-date=5 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; EPID was created so that a device could prove to an external party what kind of device it is (and optionally what software is running on the device) without needing to also reveal exact identity, i.e., to prove you are an authentic member of a group without revealing ''which'' member. It has been in use since 2008.

==Future PETs==
Examples of privacy enhancing technologies that are being researched or developed include&lt;ref&gt;The EU PRIME research project's [https://www.prime-project.eu/prime_products/whitepaper/PRIME-Whitepaper-V2.pdf White Paper] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817132944/https://www.prime-project.eu/prime_products/whitepaper/PRIME-Whitepaper-V2.pdf |date=2007-08-17 }} (Version 2)&lt;/ref&gt; limited disclosure technology, anonymous credentials such as online car rental, negotiation and enforcement of data handling conditions, and data transaction log. '''Limited disclosure technology''' provides a way of protecting individuals' privacy by allowing them to share only enough personal information with service providers to complete an interaction or transaction. This technology is also designed to limit tracking and correlation of users’ interactions with these third parties. Limited disclosure uses [[Cryptography|cryptographic]] techniques and allows users to retrieve data that is vetted by a provider, to transmit that data to a relying party, and have these relying parties trust the authenticity and integrity of the data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/limited-disclosure-technology Gartner IT Glossary]&lt;/ref&gt; '''Anonymous credentials''' are asserted properties or rights of the [[credential]] holder that don't reveal the true identity of the holder; the only information revealed is what the holder of the credential is willing to disclose. The assertion can be issued by the user himself/herself, by the provider of the online service or by a third party (another service provider, a government agency, etc.). For example:

'''Online car rental'''. The car rental agency doesn't need to know the true identity of the customer. It only needs to make sure that the customer is over 23 (as an example), that the customer has a drivers license, [[health insurance]] (i.e. for accidents, etc.), and that the customer is paying. Thus there is no real need to know the customers name nor their address or any other [[personal information]]. Anonymous credentials allow both parties to be comfortable: they allow the customer to only reveal so much data which the car rental agency needs for providing its service (data minimization), and they allow the car rental agency to verify their requirements and get their money. When ordering a car online, the user, instead of providing the classical name, address and [[credit card number]], provides the following credentials, all issued to [[pseudonym]]s (i.e. not to the real name of the customer):
* An assertion of minimal age, issued by the state, proving that the holder is older than 23 (note: the actual age is not provided)
* A [[driving licence]], i.e. an assertion, issued by the motor vehicle control agency, that the holder is entitled to drive cars
* A [[proof of insurance]], issued by the health insurance
* Digital cash
'''Negotiation and enforcement of data handling conditions'''. Before ordering a product or service online, the user and the online service provider or merchant negotiate the type of personal data that is to be transferred to the service provider. This includes the conditions that shall apply to the handling of the personal data, such as whether or not it may be sent to third parties (profile selling) and under what conditions (e.g. only while informing the user), or at what time in the future it shall be deleted (if at all). After the transfer of personal data took place, the agreed upon data handling conditions are technically enforced by the infrastructure of the service provider, which is capable of managing and processing and data handling obligations. Moreover, this enforcement can be remotely audited by the user, for example by verifying chains of certification based on [[Trusted computing]] modules or by verifying privacy seals/labels that were issued by third party auditing organisations (e.g. data protection agencies). Thus instead of the user having to rely on the mere promises of service providers not to abuse [[personal data]], users will be more confident about the service provider adhering to the negotiated data handling conditions &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://spdp.di.unimi.it/papers/samarati-ifip06.pdf|title=Enhancing User Privacy Through Data Handling Policies|last=|first=|date=2006|website=|publisher=|access-date=5 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, the '''data transaction log''' allows users the ability to log the personal data they send to service provider(s), the time in which they do it, and under what conditions. These logs are stored and allow users to determine what data they have sent to whom, or they can establish the type of data that is in possession by a specific service provider. This leads to more [[transparency (behavior)|transparency]], which is a pre-requisite of being in control.

==History==
Qarmaqs were used by the Inuit up to the 1950s. They were used as early as the [[Thule people]], predominantly during the cold season. In winter, they also lived in igloo, especially while traveling, but when possible, the qarmaq was the preference.

==Architecture==
Finding the appropriate site for the qarmaq  included understanding the geological layout of an area in relationship to elements of weather.  Its construction involved men, women and children.&lt;ref name="WilsonStewart2008" /&gt;
;Snow qarmaq
Men collected and pieced together boulders and framework. Lacking timber, the framework was usually made of bone, preferably whale bone. Women and children gathered tundra moss for crevices, and prepared skins for roofing and siding.&lt;ref name="WilsonStewart2008"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Pamela|last2=Stewart|first2=Michelle|title=Global indigenous media: cultures, poetics, and politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-8pzHPos4U0C&amp;pg=PA83|accessdate=28 August 2011|date=January 2008|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=978-0-8223-4308-0|pages=83–}}&lt;/ref&gt; After winter snow arrived, the men used long knives to cut up blocks of snow, placing them in an outwardly direction for further protection. When the outer casing was attacked by the weather or gnawed on by wolves or foxes, women patched it up again and again, often with numb fingers in the freezing cold and biting wind.&lt;ref name="Walk1998"&gt;{{cite book|last=Walk|first=Ansgar |title=Kenojuak : Lebensgeschichte einer bedeutenden Inuit-Künstlerin|publisher=Bielefeld Pendragon-Verl.|date=1998|isbn=3-929096-61-7 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Sod qarmaq
Summer tents, which were easy to transport, gave way to the sod qarmaq in fall.&lt;ref name="Ehrlich2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ehrlich|first=Gretel|authorlink=Gretel Ehrlich|title=In the Empire of Ice: Encounters in a Changing Landscape|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4z4UEKMmizQC&amp;pg=PA158|accessdate=28 August 2011|date=20 April 2010|publisher=National Geographic Books|isbn=978-1-4262-0574-3|pages=158–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interior==
Inside, qarmaqs offered warmth only by the flame of the [[Kudlik|qulliq]]. The sleeping area was slightly elevated and used caribou skin for padding.

== History of the Racial Wage Gap ==

The documented history of the Racial Wage Gap in the United States goes back before the Civil Rights Act, where many modern causes of racial wage inequity, such as educational disparities and discrimination, stem from were even more prevalent. Public state records from the 1930s indicate white owned schools in the south spent approximately $61 dollars per student, or $1,074.14 in 2018 dollars when adjusted for inflation, compared to just $9 per student, or $158.48 in 2018 dollars. Simultaneously, the same schools saw a discrepancy in school time, with white schools in sessions for 156 days on average, compared to 123 days on average for black schools.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Carruthers |first1=Celeste K. |last2=Wanamaker |first2=Marianne H. |title=Separate and Unequal in the Labor Market: Human Capital and the Jim Crow Wa...: EBSCOhost |journal=Journal of Labor Economics |date=Jul 2017 |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=655–696 |url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=0&amp;sid=2c848bd4-070a-4154-83d2-202f3bbeac38%40pdc-v-sessmgr05&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=bth&amp;AN=123370528 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, aside from statistics of wage discrepancy between black individuals and their white counterparts, much is still unknown of wage inequity due to a lack of literature with solid empirical data to link data with an accurate model of wage discrimination.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Subject to debate during the 1970s and 80s in the scholarly community was the link between geographical location and wage inequality. Following urban-dominated studies and shifting research based on evolved conceptual and study driven thinking, sociologists determined that the racial composition of a local population means for a key element in racial wage inequality. Among other factors, studies performed by Leslie Mcall&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McCall |first1=Leslie |title=Sources of Racial Wage Inequality in Metropolitan Labor Markets: Racial, Ethnic, and Gender Differences |journal=American Sociological Review |date=August 2001 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=520 |doi=10.2307/3088921}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicate immigration population density as one of the leading factors in racial wage inequality. While black immigrant earnings do not deviate from the already substandard average earnings, numbers on Hispanic and Asian immigrant earnings suggest more extensive negative effects, especially in areas of high immigration density. Hispanic and Asian women, in particular, are shown to be most affected; Hispanic and Asian women are shown to fill less skilled, domestic service jobs where the concentration of their black and white counterparts are lower. Such barriers such as language show that such large dominance of immigrant population in such sectors only breed competition between lower-earning groups, further lowering average wages for such families.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Since 1980, studies have found that, conversely, such low earning labor may actually boost the economy as a whole, keeping many corporations and higher level jobs afloat with cheap skilled work, boosting the salaries of native born hispanics and whites alike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Parks |first1=Virginia |title=The Uneven Geography of Racial and Ethnic Wage Inequality: Specifying Local Labor Market Effects |journal=Annals of the Association of American Geographers |date=May 2012 |volume=102 |issue=3 |pages=700–725 |doi=10.1080/00045608.2011.600198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, there have been links in the discrepancies between not only earnings from labor, but in the benefits received voluntarily from employers as well. Benefits include health care, pensions, holiday and vacation days, among other government mandated and voluntary benefits. Studies done by Tali Kristal and Yinon Cohen show the link between such wage inequality and benefits received, with empirical evidence showing a steady degradation of benefits received for those of different ethnic groups. As of 2015, 32% of workers received benefits - including both mandatory and voluntary - from their employers, up from 28% in 1980. As of 2015, 44% of white employees received pension benefits, compared 36% for blacks and 28% for Hispanic employees. Health care showed similar trends, as the 2015 health coverage rates for white, black, and hispanic employees sit at 60%, 55%, and 46%, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kristal |first1=Tali |last2=Cohen |first2=Yinon |last3=Navot |first3=Edo |title=Benefit Inequality among American Workers by Gender, Race, and Ethnicity, 1982-2015 |journal=Sociological Science |date=2018 |volume=5 |pages=461–488 |doi=10.15195/v5.a20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
*Studies of the wage gap for various minority races in the United States have revealed a number of factors that contribute to the differences in wages observed between white Americans and Americans of other races. The factors contributing to the wage gaps for various races and the degree to which they affect each race varies,&lt;ref name=Gwartney&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; but many factors are common to most or all races.

===Educational disparities===

  | doi=10.1093/ei/40.1.31}}&lt;/ref&gt; contributes in a similar manner to the racial wage gap. Varying education levels among races lead to different wages for various racial groups. Education affects wages because it allows access to occupations of higher status that offer greater earnings.&lt;ref name=Campbell/&gt; [[Mary C. Waters]] and Karl Eschbach studied the decrease in the black-white wage gap from the 1940s through the 1970s and found the primary reason for the decrease in the wage gap to be the narrowing of the [[Achievement gap in the United States|education gap]] between blacks and whites.&lt;ref name=Waters/&gt;

When the education of different groups becomes more equal, wage gaps decrease, though they do not disappear.  A 2017 study found that the boost to earnings from legal education was lower for minorities than for whites, although all groups typically benefited from additional education.&lt;ref name="Race"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McIntyre|first1=Frank|last2=Simkovic|first2=Michael|title=Are law degrees as valuable to minorities?|journal=International Review of Law &amp; Economics|doi=10.1016/j.irle.2017.09.004 |url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3037749|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Occupational distribution disparities===
[[File:US occpuational distribution.png|thumb|350px|alt=Distribution of US occupations by race.|The occupation distribution of employed persons in the United States, 1997.&lt;ref name=Council/&gt;]]

The way in which races are distributed throughout occupations affects the racial wage gap. White and Asian Americans, who have the highest median incomes,&lt;ref name=CensusAbstract&gt;{{cite web
  | last = U.S. Census Bureau
  | title = Statistical Abstract of the United States: 2012
  | url= https://www.census.gov/prod/2011pubs/12statab/income.pdf
  | accessdate = 30 Dec 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; are concentrated more in professional, executive, and managerial occupations than blacks, Hispanics, or American Indians.&lt;ref name=Council/&gt;&lt;ref name=Campbell/&gt; Black and Hispanic workers are not only more likely to work in blue-collar or service jobs, but they tend to be concentrated in the lower-wage/skilled jobs, such as operators, fabricators, and laborers, rather than higher-paying precision production and craft jobs within those categories.&lt;ref name=Council/&gt;&lt;ref name=Campbell/&gt;  Even at similar levels of education, minorities might work in less prestigious roles.  For example, among law school graduates, minorities are about 10 percent less likely than whites to practice law.&lt;ref name="Race"/&gt;

Occupational distribution varies for women of various races as well. White and Asian women are more likely to work in managerial and professional occupations, while black, Hispanic, and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian Women]] are more likely to work in service occupations.&lt;ref name=Council/&gt; Thus, because certain races are more likely to have lower-paying jobs, gaps in median incomes between races arise.

A study conducted by Kenneth Couch and Mary Daly found that the occupational distribution between blacks and white improved between 1970 and the 1990s.&lt;ref name=Couch/&gt; In 1968, a black male was only 20 percent as likely to be employed as a manager as a white male and only 40 percent as likely to work in a professional occupation. In 1998, the percentages increased to 50% and 70 percent, respectively.&lt;ref name=Couch/&gt; Despite this improvement, however, occupational distribution differences still exist between blacks and whites. In 1998, a black male was still more likely than a white male to work in lower-skills jobs and less likely than a white male to work in high-paying jobs.&lt;ref name=Couch/&gt;

===Globalization===
The [[globalization]] of the United States' economy in the 1970s and 1980s caused a shift in the U.S. income distribution.&lt;ref name=Massey&gt;{{Citation

  | publisher = Yale University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the United States joined the global market economy, three outcomes occurred. Those who possessed financial and [[human capital]], such as education, succeeded in the new economy because the money and skills they had to offer were in short supply. Those who possessed only labor did not fare well because cheap, physical labor was in oversupply in the global market.&lt;ref name=Massey/&gt;

In the new globalized economy that formed, much of the United States' manufacturing was exported, which affected most adversely the group of Americans in the lowest section of the education distribution, a section in which minority groups are overrepresented.&lt;ref name=Waters/&gt; The increase in overall wage inequality created by the new economy's lower demand for physical labor disproportionately affected minorities as well.&lt;ref name=Couch/&gt; The economic restructuring also served to create structural barriers to improvement for those with the least education and skills.&lt;ref name=Waters/&gt; Thus, the United States' shift to a globalized economy lead to greater income disparity between education groups, which, because of the uneven distribution of minorities in jobs and an overall increase in wage inequality, led to the wage gap between whites and minorities to increase.

===Geographic distribution===
The distance between jobs and the location of minorities' homes affects the ability of minorities to find profitable work. Saskia Sassen found that the redistribution of manufacturing jobs out of central cities in the 1980s negatively affected the wage gap between blacks and whites because most blacks live in cities.&lt;ref name=Waters/&gt;

===Foreign birth===
A person of a minority race that is not born in the United States fares worse than those who are native born in terms of wages.&lt;ref name=Gwartney/&gt; The worst affected are men and women from Japan and China and Filipino women. However, a study by Gwartney and Long (1978) found that there is a positive effect on economic outcomes for [[Immigrant generations|second generation immigrants]], or the children of immigrants who are foreign born, which they believe means that there are specific traits of immigrant parents that are beneficial to the economic success of their children.&lt;ref name=Gwartney/&gt;

===Client channeling===
When wage gaps in occupations for blacks and whites are compared, it is observed that occupations that depend on social networking for success tend to have the largest racial disparities, while occupations in which success does not depend on the type of clients served tend to have the least racial disparities.&lt;ref name=Grodsky&gt;{{cite journal

  | doi=10.2307/3088922}}&lt;/ref&gt; This difference has been attributed to employee channeling, or the assignment by white employers of minority employees to serve minority clients.&lt;ref name=Grodsky/&gt; The implications of employee channeling for a black real estate agent, for example, would be that they disproportionately served black clients and neighborhoods, resulting in lower sales commissions. In this way, employee channeling, identified as a social form of discrimination, contributes to the wage gap.&lt;ref name=Grodsky/&gt;

===Discrimination===
{{See also|Discrimination in the United States}}

When human capital, skills, and other factors contributing to the racial wage gap are taken into account, many researchers find that there is still a portion of the racial wage gap that is unexplained. Many attribute this to another factor: [[Race and ethnicity in the United States|race]]. Differences in wages due solely to race is  racial [[Discrimination in the United States|discrimination]]. Through the use of statistical controls, sociologists and economists "ask whether a given person with the same background characteristics, such as level of education, region of residence, gender, marital characteristics, has the same earnings as a statistically equivalent person from a different racial/ethnic group".&lt;ref name=Waters/&gt; Differences that emerge are taken as evidence of racial discrimination. Research has found wage and employment discrimination against blacks, Native Americans, Hispanics, and Asians; however, discrimination has been found to be a much larger contributing factor for black wages than wages of other races.&lt;ref name=Waters/&gt;

A study conducted by Grodsky &amp; [[Devah Pager|Pager]] (2001) found that individual attributes, such as human capital and region, account for just more than half of the black-white wage gap, and an additional 20 percent is due to different occupational distributions between blacks and whites.&lt;ref name=Grodsky/&gt; The remaining portion of the wage gap not accounted for by individual and occupational distribution factors is thought to be due, at least in part, to discrimination.&lt;ref name=Grodsky/&gt;

Discrimination based on race has been found in other research as well. Seventy-four percent of employers in one study were found to be racially biased against blacks, and blacks have been found to make lower wages than whites working in the same industry.&lt;ref name=Coleman/&gt; [[White Hispanic and Latino Americans|White Latinos]] earn higher wages than nonwhite Latinos, regardless of whether they are native or immigrant, suggesting possible discrimination based on skin color.&lt;ref name=Coleman/&gt; Additionally, many employers openly admit to discriminating against blacks and workers in the inner city, as one study by Kirschenman and Neckerman (1991) found.&lt;ref name=Coleman/&gt; Hiring audits have also found discrimination in the labor market. Blacks and whites who have the same credentials receive jobs at a rate of 3:1.&lt;ref name=Coleman/&gt;

==Specific races==
Wage gaps have been identified for many races within the United States; however, research has found that the size and causes of the wage gap differs by race.&lt;ref name=Gwartney/&gt; For instance, the median black male worker earns 74 percent as much as the median white male worker, while the median Hispanic male worker earns only 63 percent as much.&lt;ref name=Council/&gt; To understand more fully and accurately the subject of the racial wage gap in the United States, it is useful to look at different races individually to understand the causes and outcomes that are unique to them.

===Black===
The history of Black Americans in the United States is one characterized by social control and domination. The [[Wealth inequality in the United States#Racial disparities|disparity in wealth between Black and White America]] has a history as long as the relationship between the two groups. Across the country, white Americans benefitted from not being required to pay [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved Africans for two centuries]], and after slavery was abolished racist groups like the Ku Klux Klan led mobs to engage in boycotts at the least and outright violence against Black businesses ([[Tulsa race riot|1921 Tulsa Race Riot]]), churches ([[16th Street Baptist Church bombing]]), schools, and other pillars of Black society at worst. Though these individuals have since died, their wealth has been passed down until the present in the form of inheritance and historical business investment.

The [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], which forbade employers from discriminating on the basis of race,&lt;ref name=Coleman/&gt; was one of the earliest and greatest influences on the black-white wage gap. The act, along with the [[post–World War II economic expansion|economic prosperity of the 1960s]], contributed to rising black wages, increased education for blacks, and increased returns to education.&lt;ref name=Waters/&gt; Indeed, in 1940, weekly wages of the average black male were only 48.4 percent that of the average white male. In 1990, that had risen to 75 percent, a 60 percent improvement over five decades.&lt;ref name=Chandra&gt;{{cite journal

From the ending of legal [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] through the mid-1970s, the black-white wage gap continued to narrow. However, from the mid-1970s until almost 1990, progress in wage equality greatly slowed.&lt;ref name=Waters/&gt; From 1968-1979, the black-white wage gap decreased by an average of 1.2 percent each year. During the 80s, however, it increased .24 percent each year. During the 1990s, the black-white wage gap decreased .59 percent each year.&lt;ref name=Couch/&gt; This proportional decrease was also accompanied by a decrease in the absolute difference of black and white wages.&lt;ref name=CensusAbstract/&gt;

Analyses have uncovered some of the underlying influences in the improvements of the black-white wage gap. During the decades of progress (the 1970s and 1990s), 30 percent of the wage gap convergence can be attributed to changes in black education and experience.&lt;ref name=Couch/&gt; More equalization in employment distribution also influenced the convergence during those decades. Factors identified as contributing to decreases in wage gap convergence include "shifts in industry demand, greater occupational crowding, relative deterioration of unobservable skills in blacks, and rising overall male wage inequality".&lt;ref name=Couch/&gt;

The decline of the black-white wage gap in the 1990s was greatest for those who have less than 10 years of potential experience, for whom it decreased 1.40 percent per year.&lt;ref name=Couch/&gt; Kenneth Couch and Mary C. Daly report in their 2002 study on black-white wage inequality that these decreases are the result of greater occupational diversity and reductions in unobserved or residual differences.&lt;ref name=Couch/&gt; In the first decade of the twenty-first century, the wage gap has fluctuated in terms of the ratio between black and white wages: 67.7 percent in 2000, 64.0 percent in 2005, 67.5 percent in 2008, and 64.5 percent in 2009.&lt;ref name=CensusAbstract/&gt; The absolute difference in black and white wages, however, has decreased over this period.&lt;ref name=CensusAbstract/&gt;

Black Americans now number 36 million, 12.9% of the total population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2009, the median black male income was $23,738, compared to the median white non-Hispanic male income of $36,785.&lt;ref name=CensusAbstract/&gt;

While progress in wage inequality for blacks has been made since the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Acts, inequality and discrimination still exist. A study conducted by Major G. Coleman (2003) reports that as black and white men have more similar competitive performance ratings, racial wage differences increase rather than decrease. He also found that black wages are less than white wages in the same industry.&lt;ref name=Coleman/&gt; When no factors other than race are considered, Coleman predicts the black hourly wage to be $7.49 and the white hourly wage to be $8.92, 19 percent higher than the black hourly wage. When Coleman controlled for human capital, such as education and skills, the difference decreased to 11 percent. Coleman attributed this 11 percent difference to racial discrimination.&lt;ref name=Coleman/&gt;

Grodsky and [[Devah Pager|Pager]] also calculated wage differences, and found blacks to make $3.65 less  per hour than whites in the private sector and $2.85 less in the public sector.&lt;ref name=Grodsky/&gt; Using statistical regressions, they found that human capital, region, and marital status account for 55 percent of the wage gap difference. An additional 20 percent of the wage gap was attributed to differences in occupational distributions between blacks and whites. Thus, 25 percent of the wage gap was unaccounted for by their model.&lt;ref name=Grodsky/&gt;

Black women experience more wage equality in comparison to white women than black men do to white men. By the mid-1970s, wages for black and white women were almost equal; however, since then, black women's wages have decreased about 10 percent relative to white women's wages.&lt;ref name=Council/&gt; This difference that emerged has been attributed to the increase of white women in the labor force following the mid-1970s.&lt;ref name=Waters/&gt;

It has been suggested that when more white women began working, the advantages of black women from unmeasured differences in labor force attachment disappeared, revealing a racial wage gap. While an overall wage gap appeared between black and white women, by 1980, the earnings of black women with college degrees surpassed those of white women with college degrees.&lt;ref name=Waters/&gt; An understanding of the earnings of black women has recently become recognized as an important area of research due to role that black women traditionally have in terms of family income: black married couples typically have relied more on women's earnings than other races and the percentage of single-parent, female-maintained families is highest among the black population.&lt;ref name=Council/&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the largest Hispanic group, consisting of 29.2 million people, were individuals of [[Mexican American|Mexican]] origin, followed by 4.1 million people of [[Puerto Ricans in the United States|Puerto Rican]] origin and 1.6 million people of [[Cuban American|Cuban]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = 30 Dec 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While their relative wages have fallen since 1979, this has been attributed to a demand for more educated workers and a gap in educational attainment, supported by the fact that college-educated Hispanic men's relative wages have changed little over time.&lt;ref name=Council/&gt;

Unlike research findings for the black minority, it has been a converging finding that largest contributing factor to the wage gap of Hispanics is observable skill characteristics, especially education.&lt;ref name=Council/&gt;&lt;ref name=Waters/&gt;&lt;ref name=Borjas/&gt; Thus, increased education has been seen to contribute to a decreased wage gap. College-educated Hispanic men have wages that are approximately 80 percent of those earned by college-educated white males and are 10 percent higher than wages earned by college-educated black males.&lt;ref name=Council/&gt; College-educated Hispanic women earn approximately 90 percent of what college-educated white women earn, which is slightly more than the earnings of college-educated black women.&lt;ref name=Council/&gt;

Despite the improvement in wages made by educational attainment, less educated Hispanic men still have less return to education than non-Hispanic men that are statistically comparable. A study conducted using 1980 census data on income that controlled for age, education, English language ability, nativity, and State/Metro residence, found a wage gap of 10 percent still existed for Hispanics compared to non-Hispanics. Additionally, discrimination against Hispanic men and women was found in an audit study of employers in San Diego and Chicago.&lt;ref name=Waters/&gt;

Because skills and educational attainment is the major contributing factor to the wage gap for Hispanics, differences in the education levels of the various Hispanic subgroups has been used to explain differences in their wages. The typical trend in wages for Hispanic subgroups is that Cubans do the best while Puerto Ricans do the worst, being severely disadvantaged even in comparison to blacks and American Indians. [[George Borjas|George J. Borjas]] attributes these group differences to two factors: 1. The nature of the [[Immigration to the United States|migration]] decision (whether individuals migrated to the United States for political or economic reasons) and 2. The incentives for immigrants to adapt to the U.S. labor market.&lt;ref name=Borjas/&gt;

When Hispanic persons immigrate to the United States, neither their physical nor human capital specific to their country of origin is easily transferred to the United States' labor market; human capital investments must be made in the United States in order to assimilate into the labor market.&lt;ref name=Borjas/&gt; Borjas argues that the Hispanic groups that immigrate to the United States for economic reasons, rather than political reasons, have more incentive to acquire human capital in the United States and therefore do so faster than other groups. This faster acquisition of human capital results in better economic progress and higher wages.&lt;ref name=Borjas/&gt;

Thus, the relative success of Cubans can be attributed to the fact that they invest in United States education and labor market skills faster and to a greater degree than other Hispanic groups. Borjas recognizes that one of the main reasons for Hispanic migration to the United States is political reasons, and he argues that political refugees have less incentive to assimilate and acquire human capital than those who migrate for economic reasons. This lower incentive leads to the education gaps seen between Hispanics and whites and therefore greatly contributes to the observed wage gap.&lt;ref name=Borjas/&gt; Based on an analysis of Hispanic wages over the past six decades, Borjas concludes that, due to differing incentives to assimilate and other factors, Puerto Rican immigrants will wait twenty-five years before the assimilation process is reflected in their wages and Mexican immigrants will wait fifteen years.&lt;ref name=Borjas/&gt;

Hispanic women, like black women, have experienced greater success in wage equality relative to males of their race. As of 1995, Hispanic women of all education levels, except for those without high school diplomas or associate degrees, had parity in earnings with white women.&lt;ref name=Waters/&gt; While this information is positive, a broader examination of Hispanic women's wages reveals that inequality still exists. In the 1990s, Hispanic women's full-time earnings fell in real terms. This difference is attributed mainly to differences in educational attainment.&lt;ref name=Council/&gt; As of 2017, the average Hispanic woman in the United States made 87.4% of what their male counterparts earned, 75.8% of what white women white made, and only 62.1% of what white, American males earned annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fontenot|first=Kayla|date=September 12, 2018|title=Income and Poverty in the United States: 2017|url=https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2018/demo/p60-263.html|journal=Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplements (CPS ASEC)|volume=|pages=|via=U.S Census Bureau}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asian===
As of 2010, 14,011,000 [[Asian American|Asians]] of all ethnicities were living in America.&lt;ref name=Asian&gt;{{cite web | last = U.S. Census Bureau | title = .

In 2009, the median income for Asian males was $37,330, compared to the median income for non-Hispanic white males of $36,785.&lt;ref name=CensusAbstract/&gt; 
In 2015, Asian American men were the highest earning racial group at $24/hour.  Asian American men earned 117% as much as white American men ($21/hour) and have been out earning their white Americans counterparts since about 2000. Similarly, in 2015 Asian American women earned 106% as much as white American women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Patten|first1=Eileen|title=Racial, gender wage gaps persist in U.S. despite some progress|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/01/racial-gender-wage-gaps-persist-in-u-s-despite-some-progress/|website=Pew Research Center|publisher=Pew Research Center|accessdate=2 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, not all Asian groups in the United States have such high wages; certain Asian groups have fared better than others in the United States labor market. East Asians from Hong Kong,Taiwan, China, Japan, and Korea have higher median wages and household income than Southeast Asian refugees from Laos and Vietnam, though all these groups still have median income above non-Hispanic whites. Cambodians and Hmong, on the other hand, do not, though their median income is still quite close to the national average and above that of blacks and Hispanics. [[Indian Americans]] currently have the highest median household income of any ethnic group in the United States, while Bhutanese Americans have the lowest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_10_SF4_B19013&amp;prodType=table |title=Median houseland income in the past 12 months (in 2010 inflation-adjusted dollars) |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |year=2010 |work=2006-2010 American Community Survey |publisher=United States Census Bureau |accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Part of the explanation for Asians' higher wages is their greater-than-average educational attainment: in the 1990s, 23.3 percent of the total U.S. male population had at least a college degree, while 48.7 percent of Asian Indian men, 41.6 percent of Filipino men, and 35 percent of Chinese men had at least a college degree.&lt;ref name=Waters/&gt; The higher educational attainment of Asians masks the fact that a wage gap exists between Asians and whites of the same occupations. Whites earn more than Asians in almost all occupational categories when other factors are controlled.&lt;ref name=Waters/&gt; Asians still make 8% less than whites in comparable jobs except for Asians who have been in the United States for one and a half generations, whom have reached full parity in income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0003122410388501|title=Have Asian American Men Achieved Labor Market Parity with White Men?|first1=ChangHwan|last1=Kim|first2=Arthur|last2=Sakamoto|date=1 December 2010|publisher=|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=75|issue=6|pages=934–957|via=SAGE Journals|doi=10.1177/0003122410388501}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Native Americans===

The [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] minority has been less studied than other minority groups in the United States. In 1990, the median family income for American Indians was $21,750, approximately 62 percent of the $35,225 median family income for all families.&lt;ref name=CensusAbstract/&gt; By 2010, the median household income for Native Americans was $38,806, compared to $51,914 for the total population, making them the second poorest race on average after African-Americans ($35,341).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_10_SF4_B19013&amp;prodType=table |title=Median Household Income in the Past 12 Months (in 2010 inflation-adjusted dollors) |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2010 |work=2006-2010 American Community Survey |publisher=United States Census Bureau |accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Native Americans are the poorest ethnic group when measured by per capita income.  &lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ethnic_groups_in_the_United_States_by_per_capita_income#&gt; The wage gap has been attributed by some to "human capital differences." There is debate as to whether discrimination affects the wage gap.&lt;ref name=Waters/&gt;  However, most sociologists understand existing wealth and income differences among minorities as the outcome of historical discrimination dating to colonization, forced migration, and slavery.

==Private vs. public sector employment==

The racial wage gap for blacks and whites has been observed to be lower in the [[Public sector|public]] sector than the [[Private sector|private]] sector.&lt;ref name="Race"/&gt; In a 2001 analysis, a $3.65 difference per hour was found between blacks and whites in the private sector, a 34 percent difference.&lt;ref name=Grodsky/&gt; In contrast, a smaller difference of $2.85 per hour was found in the public sector, a 21 percent difference.&lt;ref name=Grodsky/&gt; For the 23 percent of blacks that work in the public sector, evidence suggests that wages are based primary on individual qualifications, but for the 77 percent of blacks employed in the private sector, this assertion has not been found to be as valid.&lt;ref name=Grodsky/&gt;

Additionally, a larger percentage of the wage gap was found to be accounted for by the human capital characteristics of educational attainment and potential years of experience in the public than private sector.&lt;ref name=Grodsky/&gt; Also, an effect encountered in the private sector in which black males have higher absolute wages as they increase in status but lower wages relative to whites of the same status, has not been found in the public sector.&lt;ref name=Grodsky/&gt;

==Policy discussion==
Though solutions to eliminate the racial wage gap have been proposed, there is no one prescription that will eliminate it for all races, or even one race. Research has identified different wage gaps and sources of wage gaps for different minorities, suggesting that public policies will affect different minorities in different ways and that effective strategies must take into account the unique circumstances of each race group.&lt;ref name=Gwartney/&gt; Sociologist [[Douglas Massey]] offers two solutions to alleviate wage inequality: greater investments in education and elimination of racial segregation. He notes that, in a globalized economy, those with only physical labor to offer suffer.&lt;ref name=Massey/&gt;

He argues that investments in education, especially higher education, will result in higher rates of economic growth and lower [[Income inequality in the United States|income inequality]]. By eliminating racial segregation, Massey argues that many divides between races that exist would be broken down, including income segregation. To accomplish the abolition of racial segregation, Massey argues, simple enforcement of legislation already in place, such as the [[Fair Housing Act]], the [[Home Mortgage Disclosure Act]], and the [[Community Reinvestment Act]], is required.&lt;ref name=Massey/&gt; For more group-specific policies, focus on education and language inequalities could be helpful in equalizing employment opportunities, but other more specific policies are dependent on further research on wage gaps for various groups.&lt;ref name=Gwartney/&gt; 
	
To tackle wage inequality specifically in companies, random job audits at the national, state, and local levels have been suggested. Audits have been used to study and find wage inequality in the past and could be used as way to actively monitor the presence of the racial wage gap in companies.&lt;ref name=Coleman/&gt;

==Limitations and criticisms of the racial wage gap==
Evaluating and understanding the causes and consequences of the racial wage gap for various races is an important part of understanding [[racial inequality in the United States]]; however, the wage gap does not encompass all aspects of inequality and therefore is useful when understood in conjunction with other types of inequalities. For example, sociologists Mary C. Waters and Karl Eschbach note that other types of inequalities are important for a holistic understanding of inequality in the United States, "including health and demographic measures, such as infant mortality rates, life expectancy, morbidity, and disability.&lt;ref name=Waters/&gt;

Ethnic and racial groups also differ in rates of [[Homeownership in the United States|homeownership]], [[residential segregation]], overall wealth, exposure to crime and toxic pollutants, and in access to power in the upper reaches of our society".&lt;ref name=Waters/&gt; Thus, the racial wage gap is just one aspect of inequality in the United States.

A criticism of the racial wage gap has been noted by a few scholars: the racial wage gap fails to account for the number of people of a specific race that are [[Unemployment in the United States|unemployed]].&lt;ref name=Waters/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chandra/&gt; Examining median incomes does not reflect the growing racial disparity in joblessness.&lt;ref name=Waters/&gt; The Butler-[[James Heckman|Heckman]] hypothesis states that the least-skilled members of society are also the ones who are most likely to be not working,&lt;ref name=Chandra/&gt; suggesting that the wage gap does not account for the overall difference in wages between races. An analysis of the black-white wage gap which accounted for unemployment found that when unemployment was included in the calculation of the weekly wages convergence from 1950 to 2000, the convergence percentage went from 13 percent to only 3 percent.&lt;ref name=Chandra/&gt;

== Rape by Indian forces (post-1988) ==
{{Human rights abuses in Jammu and Kashmir}}
=== Background ===
In the aftermath of the rigged [[Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly election, 1987|1987 elections]] in the state of Jammu and Kashmir, where Islamic parties were prevented from winning several seats in the State Assembly,&lt;ref&gt;Amin, Tahir; Schofield, Victoria. [http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t236/e0433?_hi=3&amp;_pos=48 Kashmir]. The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Islamic World. Oxford University Press. &lt;nowiki&gt;''The current phase of resistance against Indian rule began in 1987 when an alliance of several Islamic parties, the Muslim United Front (MUF), was expected to win several important seats in the state assembly elections but failed to win more than four seats, allegedly because of massive rigging. These elections proved the catalyst for a new phase of armed struggle against Indian rule. ''&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; a popular [[Insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir|anti-Indian separatist movement and militancy]] gained momentum in the [[Kashmir Valley]], a territory disputed between India and Pakistan since 1947. To counter the insurgency, India militarised the Valley, deploying a huge number of troops in the region. Opponents of Indian military occupation in the valley maintain that 600,000 troops are stationed throughout the state, according to which the region possesses the highest ratio of troops to civilians in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rkTetMfI6QkC Schofield, Kashmir in Conflict 2003], p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; Since January 1990, Indian forces committed a number of human rights violations against civilians, including mass rape.&lt;ref name="DwivediRajan20162" /&gt;

=== Rape as a weapon of war ===
According to a 1993 [[Human Rights Watch]] (HRW) report, the security forces use rape as a method of retaliation against Kashmiri civilians during reprisal attacks after militant ambushes.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Littlewood, Roland. "Military Rape." ''[[Anthropology Today]]'', vol. 13, no. 2, 1997, pp. 7–16.&lt;/ref&gt; Most rape cases, according to the same report, have occurred during cordon-and-search operations.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/INDIA935.PDF "Rape in Kashmir: A Crime of War"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904012347/http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/INDIA935.PDF |date=4 September 2012 }} (PDF).

According to Seema Kazi, the motive of rape in Kashmir is no different to the rapes which were committed in Rwanda and the Balkans.&lt;ref&gt;Kazi, Seema. [http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t343/e0165?_hi=3&amp;_pos=8 ''Kashmir, Gender and Militarization in''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211082042/http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t343/e0165?_hi=3&amp;_pos=8 |date=11 February 2017 }}. Oxford University Press.  &lt;q&gt;In this respect the motive and intent of rape in Kashmir was no different from the Balkans and Rwanda, where rape functioned as a cultural weapon of war against women and against the community at large (Kesic, 2000)...Rape and sexual abuse is an integral part of the Indian counteroffensive in Kashmir&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Kazi opines that rape in Kashmir is a cultural weapon of war and the rape of [[Kashmiris|Kashmiri]] women by Indian security forces, in the context of a predominantly Hindu state repressing a Muslim minority population, functions as a tool of subordinating Kashmiri men and the Kashmiri community at large.&lt;ref&gt;Kazi, Seema.

=== Aftermath ===
Assaulted women continue to suffer severe physical and emotional consequences. Women and their male relatives suffer 'collective shaming' as their ''izzat'' (honour) is deemed to be lost. The men are seen to have failed to protect the honour of their mothers, wives and daughters. In conservative societies sexual assaults and the accompanying forced impregnations affect a man's reputation. According to Molen and Bal, "the authorities have deliberately inflicted collective dishonor—and in fact defeat—through appropriating Kashmiri men's control of women's ''izzat.&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;''&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;Van Der Molen, Thomas, and Ellen Bal.

According to Hafsa Kanjwal in SAGAR research journal of University of Texas Austin, that since Kashmiri society misplaces the blame of rape on the victim, women suffer from more psychological burdens and the victims internalize the concepts of shame and impurity attached to them. This feeling often leads to not just depression but also a breakdown in marriages, breakup of families and sometimes even suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Kanjwal, Hafsa.

Her efforts to seek compensation eventually led to the breakdown of her abusive marriage and she subsequently developed chronic depression and internalized the shame projected onto her by her community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Molen and Bal state that there is a tendency in Kashmir to refuse marrying anyone from a village where rape has occurred.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; In the villages of Kunan Poshpora, some women were rejected by their husbands after being raped by Indian soldiers. At the behest of militants, some husbands did take back their wives but habitually abused them. One such woman told interviewers that she had begged her husband to 'forgive her' but her husband still considered her as defiled by another man. There were also cases of mother-son relationships breaking down. The rapes have also cast a stigma on other women from the rape victims' families, even if they themselves were not raped. Boys are also reported to have taunted the rape victims. Women who were pregnant at the time of their rape either miscarried or delivered deformed children.&lt;ref name="Butalia2014"&gt;{{cite book

=== Reactions ===
Human Rights Watch stated in its 1993 report that, when confronted with the evidence of rape, Indian authorities have denied the charges. The report says they have either attempted to question the integrity of the witnesses or discredit the testimony of physicians, without ordering a full inquiry.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Commissioner in charge of magistrates for Kashmir, [[Wajahat Habibullah]], chose to resign after India denied the charges in 1991.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

In 1993, Lt. General D. S. R. Sahni, General Officer Commanding in Chief of the Northern Command, when asked about the charges of rape by the security forces in Kashmir, has alleged that the militants "trump up" charges of rape against the forces. He said, "A soldier conducting an operation at the dead of night is unlikely to think of rape when he is not even certain if he will return alive."&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

According to Kazi, the Indian media has &lt;nowiki&gt;''displayed unseemly haste in exonerating security forces''&lt;/nowiki&gt; from rape allegations.&lt;ref&gt;Kazi, Seema.

According to the report of Human Rights Watch, the common use of rape by Indian security forces in the conflict drew little international condemnation, despite reports in the international press and by Indian human rights groups.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/INDIA935.PDF "Rape in Kashmir: A Crime of War"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904012347/http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/INDIA935.PDF |date=4 September 2012 }} (PDF).

Feminist commentators are critical of the way Kashmiri men have addressed the issue of rape. According to Kazi, Kashmiri men feel helpless and bewildered at the rape of their women. But Kazi also complains that while [[Yasin Malik]] of the [[Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front|Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front]] acknowledged the assaults by the Indian Army on Kashmiri women, he failed to address the torture and stigma which Kashmiri society then imposes on the rape victims.&lt;ref name="Geetha2016"&gt;{{cite book

According to journalist Syed Junaid Hashmi, both separatists and mainstream political parties in Kashmir have ignored the rape victims. Hashmi says that the state governments order inquiries which turn out inconclusive while those guilty are rewarded for fighting militancy. Separatists address the plight of the victims by saying, 'they have lost their honour for a greater cause'. Separatist leader Shahidul Islam commented, "I know by merely giving statements, honour lost by our daughters, sisters and mothers cannot be restored. They expected a lot more from the separatist leadership than what it has been doing, unfortunately we failed in pursuing the cause of our women vigorously."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web

=== Prosecution ===
In 1994, due to the international pressure, some court-martials of soldiers accused of rape were made public by the Indian government. In one such case, two soldiers were sentenced to twelve year imprisonment, on 29 July 1994, for raping a village girl in Kashmir. However, many documented cases of rape were refused to be prosecuted by the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Human Rights Watch also highlighted the fact in its 1993 report that despite the evidence of widespread sexual violence perpetrated by the Indian army and paramilitary forces, few of the incidents were ever investigated by the authorities and no prosecution of alleged rapists ever occurred.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; According to the 1996 HRW report, in many cases these incidents "are never investigated by judicial and medical authorities".&lt;ref name="HRW" /&gt;

[[Khurram Parvez]] remarks that women fear reprisals from the Army to file the cases of rape. He says, "this is because there are cases in which when rape was reported, members of their families were attacked or prosecuted." He also states that it would be technically very difficult to prove rape, since the incidents happen in the areas which are completely under the Army's control.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news

Dwivedi and Rajan point out that India has been able to commit crimes against humanity, such as mass rape, with impunity in Kashmir because of its alliance with permanent members in the [[United Nations Security Council]], such as the [[United States|US]], and also because it is not part of the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC). India refuses to join the ICC by contending that its own judicial system is competent enough to address war crimes. However, law expert Usha Ramanathan labels this argument misleading.&lt;ref name="DwivediRajan20162"&gt;{{cite book

Some incidents of rape by militants appear to have been motivated by the fact that the victims or their families are accused of being informers or of being opposed to the militants or supporters of rival militant groups.&lt;ref name=":82" /&gt;

In 1989, attacks on Pandits escalated and Muslim insurgents selectively raped, tortured and killed Kashmiri Pandits, burnt their temples, idols and holy books. The Pandits fled en masse from the state after which their houses were burnt by militants and their artwork and sculptures were destroyed.&lt;ref name="Knuth2006"&gt;{{cite book

According to Human Rights Watch, despite threats by Islamist groups to women since 1990, reports of rape by militants were rare in the early years of the conflict. Since 1991, reports of rape by Islamic militants have increased. In some cases, women have been raped and then killed after being abducted by rival militant groups and held as hostages for their male relatives. In other cases, members of armed militant groups have abducted women after threatening to shoot the rest of the family unless she is handed over to a militant leader. Local people sometimes refer to these abductions and rapes as "forced marriages".&lt;ref name=":82"&gt;{{Cite journal

According to the Human Rights Watch, the rape victims of militants suffer ostracism and there is a "code of silence and fear" that prevents people from reporting such abuse. It says that the investigation of cases of rape by militants is difficult because many Kashmiris are reluctant to discuss it for the fear of violent reprisals.&lt;ref name="HumanRightsCrisis"&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/INDIA937.PDF The Human Rights Crisis in Kashmir] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180803161402/https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/INDIA937.PDF |date=3 August 2018 }}.

'''Reyesano''', or '''Chirigua''' (Chiriba), is a nearly extinct [[Tacanan languages|Tacanan]] language that was spoken by only a few speakers, including children, in 1961 in [[Bolivia]].

There still are adult speakers in the largely indigenous community of El Cozar in Reyes. However, it is doubtful that this language will survive much into the 21st century. Such is the margination of the indigenous people in the Beni that very little Reyesano words have entered the popular criollo Spanish, very unlike the situation in Quechua and Aymara influenced areas. There are many indigenous terms in  "camba" (Spanish of the Beni) but they mostly of Guaraní origin carried to the Beni by the original settlers from Santa Cruz.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

Evidently the name ''Reyesano'' comes from the name of the town of Reyes, of the Province of Ballivián in the Department of the Beni in the plains adjacent to the Bolivian Amazon. The language is also known as Sapiboca (Sapibocona), Maropa, Chumana, and perhaps Warisa (Guariza); these may have corresponded to different dialects.

'''Strip clubs''' are venues where [[strippers]] provide [[adult entertainment]], predominantly in the form of [[striptease]] or other [[Erotic dancing|erotic]] or exotic dances. Strip clubs typically adopt a [[nightclub]] or [[Bar (establishment)|bar]] style, and can also adopt a [[theatre]] or [[cabaret]]-style. American-style strip clubs began to appear outside [[North America]] after [[World War II]], arriving in [[Asia]] in the late 1980s and Europe in the 1978,&lt;ref name="Shteir 2004"/&gt; where they competed against the local English and French styles of striptease and erotic performances.

As of 2005, the size of the global strip club [[industry]] was [[estimated]] to be US$75 billion.&lt;ref name="Jeffreys 2009"/&gt; In 2002, the size of the U.S. strip club industry was estimated to be US$3.1 billion, generating 19% of the total gross revenue in [[legal]] [[adult entertainment]].&lt;ref name="Lewis Purdue 2002"/&gt; [[SEC filing]]s and state liquor control records available at that time indicated that there were at least 2,500 strip clubs in the United States,&lt;ref name="Lewis Purdue 2002"/&gt; and since that time, the number of clubs in the U.S. has grown. Profitability of strip clubs, as with other service-oriented businesses, is largely driven by location and customer spending habits. The better [[wikt:appointment#Noun|appointed]] a club is, in terms of its quality of facilities, equipment, furniture, and other elements, the more likely customers are to encounter cover charges and fees for premium features such as VIP rooms.&lt;ref name="Frank 2002"/&gt; The popularity of a given club is an indicator of its quality, as is the [[word-of-mouth]] among customers who have visited a cross section of clubs in different regions.

The strip club as an outlet for [[wikt:salacious|salacious]] entertainment is a recurrent theme in [[popular culture]].&lt;ref name="Boles and Garbin 1974"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Boles | first1 = J. | last2 = Garbin | first2 = A. P. | year = 1974 | title = The Strip Club and the Customer-Stripper Patterns of Interaction | journal = Sociology and Social Research | volume = 58 | pages = 136–144}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some media, these clubs are portrayed primarily as gathering places of [[vice]] and ill [[reputation|repute]]. Clubs themselves and various aspects of the business are highlighted in these references. "Top Strip Club" lists in some media have demonstrated that U.S.-style striptease is a global phenomenon and that it has also become a culturally accepted form of entertainment, despite its scrutiny in legal circles and popular media. Popular Internet sites for strip club enthusiasts also have lists calculated from the inputs of site visitors. The legal status of strip clubs has evolved over the course of time, with national and local laws becoming progressively more liberal on the issue around the world, although some countries (such as Iceland) have implemented strict limits and bans.&lt;ref name="IcelandBan 2010"/&gt; Strip clubs are frequent targets of litigation around the world, and the sex industry, which includes strip clubs, is a hot button issue in popular culture and politics. Some clubs have been linked to [[organized crime]].&lt;ref name="TriBizJo 2007"/&gt;

[[File:1720 Der spanische teutsche und niederlaendische Krieg p238.png|thumb|right|upright|1720 depiction of a striptease event from ''La Guerre D'Espagne''.&lt;ref&gt;Image from ''Der spanische, teutsche, und niederländische Krieg oder: des Marquis von ... curieuser Lebens-Lauff'', vol. 2 (Franckfurt/ Leipzig, 1720), p.238&lt;/ref&gt; |alt=refer to caption]]

The term "striptease" was first recorded in 1938, though "stripping", in the sense of women removing clothing to sexually excite men, seems to go back at least 400 years.  For example, in [[Thomas Otway]]'s comedy ''The Soldier's Fortune'' (1681) a character says: "Be sure they be lewd, drunken, ''stripping'' whores".&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hendrickson (1997) ''QPB Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins''. New York, Facts on File, Inc: 227&lt;/ref&gt;  Its combination with music seems to be as old.  A conclusive description and visualization can be found in the 1720 German translation of the French ''La Guerre D'Espagne'' (Cologne: Pierre Marteau, 1707), where a [[galant]] party of high aristocrats and opera singers has resorted to a small château where they entertain themselves with hunting, play and music in a three-day turn:

{{Quotation|The third day, dedicated to ball and dance, was used for the finest entertainment to divert the men; their eyes were given the opportunity to see all the pleasures nature could offer; and if the pleasant aspects of a well shaped young lady are able to arouse the mind, one can say that our princes enjoyed all the delicacies of love. The dancers, to please their lovers the more, dropped their clothes and danced, totally naked, the nicest [[Entree (ballet)|entrées]] and [[ballet]]s; one of the princes directed the delightful music, and only the lovers were allowed to watch the performances.&lt;ref&gt;The German text reads "Am dritten Tag, so zum Ball und Tantz bestimmt war, spielte man eine der artigsten Kurtzweil, die Herren zu divertieren; Sie hatten ein solches Spectacul, welches ihren Augen alle Schönheit der Natur vorstellte: und wann die Annehmlichkeiten eines wohlgewachsenen Mädgens fähig sind, die Gemüther zu rühren, so kan man sagen, daß unsere Printzen alle Niedlichkeiten der Liebe genossen. Die Tänzerinnen, um ihren Amant desto besser zu gefallen, zohen ihre Kleider ab, und tantzten gantz nackend die schönsten Entrèen und Ballets; einer von den Printzen dirigirte dann diese entzückende Music, und stunde die Schaubühne niemand als diesen Verliebten offen.", ''Der spanische, teutsche, und niederländische Krieg oder: des Marquis von ... curieuser Lebens-Lauff'', Bd. 2 (Franckfurt/ Leipzig, 1720), S.238, recapitulated in Olaf Simons, ''Marteaus Europa oder der Roman, bevor er Literatur wurde'' (Amsterdam: Rodopi, 2001), p.617-635.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Other possible influences on modern stripping were the dances of the [[Ghawazee]] "discovered" and seized upon by French colonists in 19th century North Africa and [[Egypt]].  The erotic [[dance of the bee]], performed by a woman known as [[Kuchuk Hanem]], was witnessed and described by the French novelist [[Gustave Flaubert]].  In this dance the performer disrobes as she searches for an imaginary bee trapped within her garments.  It is likely that the women performing these dances did not do so in an indigenous context, but rather, responded to the commercial climate for this type of entertainment.&lt;ref name="Parramore 2008"&gt;{{cite book | title = Reading the Sphinx: Ancient Egypt in Nineteenth-Century Literary Culture | url = https://books.google.com/?id=21oWAQAAIAAJ | year = 2008 | publisher = Macmillan | isbn = 978-0-230-60328-8 | page = 132 | last1 = Parramore | first1 = Lynn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Middle Eastern]] [[belly dance]], also known as oriental dancing, was popularized in the United States after its introduction on the [[Midway (fair)|Midway]] at the [[World's Columbian Exposition|1893 World's Fair]] in [[Chicago]] by a dancer known as [[Little Egypt (dancer)|Little Egypt]].&lt;ref name="Carlton 1994"&gt;{{cite book | title = Looking for Little Egypt | url = https://books.google.com/?id=FkgUAQAAIAAJ | year = 1994 | publisher = IDD Books | isbn = 978-0-9623998-1-7 | page = 14 | last1 = Carlton | first1 = Donna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European tradition ===
In France during the late 19th century, Parisian shows such as the [[Moulin Rouge]] and [[Folies Bergère]] were featuring attractive, scantily clad, dancing women and [[tableaux vivants]].&lt;ref name="Cavendish SexAndSociety 2009"&gt;{{cite book | title = Sex and Society, Volume 1 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=aVDZchwkIMEC | year = 2009 | publisher = Marshall Cavendish Corporation | isbn = 978-0-7614-7906-2 | pages = 208–209 | last1 = Cavendish | first1 = Marshall}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this environment, an act featuring a woman slowly removing her clothes in a vain search for a [[flea]] crawling on her body was seen in 1895 and possibly filmed in 1897 by the first female director, [[Alice Guy]].&lt;ref name="Shteir 2004"&gt;{{cite book | last = Shteir | first = Rachel | title = Striptease: The Untold History of the Girlie Show | year = 2004 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-19-512750-8 | pages = 31, 39, 263–266, 350}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wallenchinsky Almanac 1978"&gt;{{cite book | title = The People's Almanac No. 2, Issue 2 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=mEdNAAAAYAAJ | year = 1978 | publisher = Marshall Cavendish Corporation | isbn = 978-0-688-03372-9 | last1 = Wallechinsky | last2 = Wallace | first1 = David | first2 = Irving}}&lt;/ref&gt; This routine, ''Le coucher d'Yvette'', inspired "French acts" in theaters and brothels in other parts of the world, seen in the U.S. city of New York as early as 1878.&lt;ref name="Shteir 2004"/&gt; The first public act of striptease in modern times is credited to Parisian theater in 1894.&lt;ref name="Patinkin 2008"&gt;{{cite book | title = No Legs, No Jokes, No Chance": a history of the American musical theater | url = https://books.google.com/?id=pGfDMaE4C5EC | year = 2008 | publisher = Northwestern University Press | isbn = 978-0-8101-1994-9 | page = 61 | last1 = Patinkin | first1 = Sheldon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, Dutch dancer [[Mata Hari]], later shot as a spy by the French authorities during World War I, was an overnight success from the debut of her act at the [[Musée Guimet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/terrorists_spies/spies/hari/5.html |work=Crime Library |title=Mata Hari is Born |first=Denise |last=Noe |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210044610/http://www.crimelibrary.com/terrorists_spies/spies/hari/5.html |archivedate=2015-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most celebrated segment of her act was her progressive shedding of clothing until she wore just a jeweled [[Brassiere|bra]] and some ornaments over her arms and head.&lt;ref name="MediaMatrix 2006"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.worldofbiography.com/9241-Mata%20Hari/life.htm | title = Mata Hari Life{{snd}}World of Biography | author =  | year = 2006 | website =  | publisher = Media Matrix | accessdate = 2010-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another landmark performance was the appearance at the Moulin Rouge in 1907 of an actress called Germaine Aymos who entered dressed only in three very small shells.&lt;ref name="Stratton 2000"&gt;{{cite book | title = The Desirable Body: cultural fetishism and the erotics of consumption | url = https://books.google.com/?id=X9EsiufsCpkC | year = 2000 | publisher = University of Illinois Press | isbn = 978-0-252-06951-2 | page = 100 | last1 = Stratton | first1 = John}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s, the famous [[Josephine Baker]] danced semi-nude in the ''danse sauvage'' at the Folies and other such performances were provided at the Tabarin.&lt;ref name="LondonTheatre 1988"&gt;{{cite book | title = London theatre record | url = https://books.google.com/?id=aVDZchwkIMEC | volume = 7 | year = 1988 | publisher = University of Michigan | isbn = 978-0-7614-7906-2 | page = 404 | issue = 1–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; These shows were notable for their sophisticated choreography and for often dressing the girls in glitzy sequins and feathers.  By the 1960s "fully nude" shows were provided at such places as [[Crazy Horse (cabaret)|Le Crazy Horse Saloon]].&lt;ref name="Richard Wortley 1976"&gt;Richard Wortley (1976) ''A Pictorial History of Striptease'': 11, 29–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Windmill-Theatre.jpg|thumb|left|Exterior of the [[Windmill Theatre]] in [[Westminster]], [[London, England]]. |alt=refer to caption]]

In Britain in the 1930s, [[Laura Henderson]] began presenting nude shows at the [[Windmill Theatre]] in London.  At that time, British law prohibited naked girls from moving.  To avoid the prohibition, the models appeared in stationary tableaux vivants.&lt;ref&gt;Vivien Goldsmith, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/3648187/Windmill-always-nude-but-never-rude.html "Windmill: always nude but never rude"], ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', 24 November 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The Windmill girls also toured other London and provincial theatres, sometimes using ingenious devices such as rotating ropes to move their bodies round, though strictly speaking, staying within the letter of the law by not moving of their own volition.&lt;ref name="Weaver Monster 2001"&gt;{{cite book | author = Tom Weaver | title = I Was a Monster Movie Maker: Conversations With 22 Sf and Horror Filmmakers | url = https://books.google.com/?id=Hx1gobckUGEC | accessdate = 2010-08-13 | year = 2001 | publisher = McFarland &amp; Company | isbn = 978-0-7864-1000-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of ways that the shows stayed within the law was the [[fan dance]], in which a naked dancer's body was concealed by her fans and those of her attendants, until the end of her act in when she posed naked for a brief interval whilst standing still.&lt;ref name="Weaver Monster 2001"/&gt;

In 1942, [[Phyllis Dixey]] formed her own company of girls and rented the [[Whitehall Theatre]] in London to put on a review called The Whitehall Follies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Roy Hudd |author2=Philip Hindin  | title = Roy Hudd's cavalcade of variety acts: a who was who of light entertainment, 1945–60 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=iydaAAAAMAAJ | accessdate = 2010-08-13 | year = 1997 | publisher = Robson Book Ltd | isbn = 978-1-86105-115-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Alfred Shaughnessy | title = Both ends of the candle | url = https://books.google.com/?id=rcXpAAAAMAAJ | accessdate = 2010-08-13 | year = 1979 | isbn = 978-0-86072-018-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1950s touring striptease acts were used to attract audiences to the dying music halls.  Paul Raymond started his touring shows in 1951 and later leased the Doric Ballroom in Soho; opening his private members club, the [[Raymond Revuebar]] in 1958.  This was the first of the private striptease members' clubs in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/paul-raymond-the-king-of-the-soho-sex-trade-dies-aged-82-790864.html | location = London | work = The Independent | title = Paul Raymond, the king of the Soho sex trade, dies aged 82 | first = Amol | last = Rajan | date = 2008-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes in the law in the 1960s, brought about a boom of strip clubs in [[Soho]] with 'fully nude' dancing and audience participation.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Murray (2005) ''Naked Jungle{{snd}}Soho Stripped Bare''. Silverback Press&lt;/ref&gt; Pubs were also used as venues, most particularly in the [[East End]], with a concentration of such venues in the district of [[Shoreditch]].  This pub striptease seems mainly to have evolved from topless go-go dancing.&lt;ref name="It Started With Theresa"&gt;{{cite book | title = In the Beginning There was Theresa | url = https://books.google.com/?id=jivMPoquDfAC | year = 2006 | publisher = Lulu.com | isbn = 978-1-4116-5178-4 | page = 5 | last1 = Martland | first1 = Bill}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though often a target of local authority harassment, some of these pubs survive to the present day.  An interesting custom in these pubs is that the strippers walk 'round and collect money from customers in a beer jug before each individual performance.  This custom appears to have originated in the late 1970s when topless go-go dancers first started collecting money from the audience as the fee for going "fully nude".&lt;ref name="It Started With Theresa"/&gt; Private dances of a more raunchy nature are sometimes available in a separate area of the pub.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Baby Oil and Ice: Striptease in East London|author1=Lara Clifton|author2=Sarah Ainslie|author3=Julie Cook|date=2002|publisher=The Do-Not Press|isbn=978-1899344857}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== American tradition ===
[[File:Condor Club.jpg|thumb|Historical marker at the original [[Condor Club]] in [[San Francisco|San Francisco, California]]. Today, the club is owned by [[Déjà Vu (company)|Deja Vu]]. |alt=refer to caption]]

In America, striptease started in [[traveling carnival]]s and [[American burlesque|burlesque]] theatres, and featured famous strippers such as [[Gypsy Rose Lee]] and [[Sally Rand]].  The [[vaudeville]] [[trapeze artist]] [[Charmion]] performed a "disrobing" act onstage as early as 1896, which was captured in the 1901 [[Thomas Edison|Edison]] film, ''Trapeze Disrobing Act''.  Another milestone for modern American striptease was the possibly legendary show at [[Minsky's Burlesque]] in April 1925: [[The Night They Raided Minsky's]].  The Minsky brothers brought burlesque to New York's [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Street]].  However, the burlesque theatres there were prohibited from having striptease performances in a legal ruling of 1937, leading to the later decline of these "[[grindhouse]]s" (named after the bump 'n grind entertainment on offer) into venues for exploitation cinema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newvictory.org/About/About_Building.aspx|website=The New Victory Cinema|title=Theater History|accessdate=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of "strippers" as we know it today with the pole dance has been popularized 8n the united states in 1972. British columbia followed the lead around 1978.

Widespread bans on striptease had a direct influence on the creation of the strip [[clip joint]] and the exotic dancer as known today.&lt;ref name="Shteir 2004"/&gt; Bans still exist; enforced now mostly at the local [[municipal]] level. American-style striptease began to appear outside North America in the post-World War II era and is now practiced widely around the world.&lt;ref name="Shteir 2004"/&gt;

The 1960s saw a revival of striptease in the form of topless [[go-go dancing]].  Topless dancing was banned in certain parts of the country, similar to the bans on striptease, but it eventually merged with the older tradition of burlesque dancing.&lt;ref name="Shteir 2004"/&gt; [[Carol Doda]] of the [[Condor Club|Condor Night Club]] in the [[North Beach, San Francisco, California|North Beach]] section of San Francisco is credited with being the first [[Toplessness|topless]] go-go dancer.&lt;ref name="CondorClub"&gt;''Nudity, Noise Pay Off in Bay Area Night Clubs'', [[Los Angeles Times]], February 14, 1965, Page G5.&lt;/ref&gt; The club opened in 1964 and Doda's première topless dance occurred on the evening of June 19 of that year.&lt;ref name=hole&gt;''California Solons May Bring End To Go-Go-Girl Shows in State'', Panama City News, September 15, 1969, Page 12A.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hole/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-22039191_ITM | title = Naked Profits | accessdate = 2007-07-30 | work = [[The New Yorker]] | date = 2004-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The large lit sign in front of the club featured a picture of her with red lights on her [[breasts]].

San Francisco is also the location of the notorious [[Mitchell Brothers O'Farrell Theatre]].  Originally an [[X-rated]] movie theater, this striptease club pioneered [[lap dancing]] in 1970, and was a major force in popularizing it in strip clubs on a nationwide and eventually worldwide basis.&lt;ref name="sfweekly"&gt;[http://www.sfweekly.com/2004-09-08/news/lap-victory/ Lap Victory.

=== Asian tradition ===
The Japanese term for strip club, nūdo gekijo, literally means "nude theater".&lt;ref name="Poitras 1999"/&gt; An older term was "sutorippu gekijo".  American-style striptease became popular in Japan during the U.S. occupation after the end of World War II (1945–1952).  Some girls chose to strip in theaters as an alternative to prostitution.&lt;ref name="Bacarr 2004"&gt;{{cite book | title = The Japanese art of sex: how to tease, seduce, &amp; pleasure the samurai in your bedroom | url = https://books.google.com/?id=R_JMDkNR8xgC | year = 2004 | publisher = Stone Bridge Press, Inc. | isbn = 978-1-880656-84-6 | page = 177 | last1 = Bacarr | first1 = Jina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When entrepreneur Shigeo Ozaki saw [[Gypsy Rose Lee]] perform, he started his own striptease revue in Tokyo's [[Shinjuku, Tokyo|Shinjuku]] neighborhood. [[Teitoza]] was the first club to open in Shinjuku, on 15 January 1947.  The first act was titled "The Birth of Venus".&lt;ref name="Poitras 1999"/&gt; Each performance lasted for fifteen seconds and was modest by modern standards, incorporating veils, panties and a bra which covered much of what would be shown today.  The woman on stage stood in a stationary pose, similar to shows in Britain. The show ran until August 1948.  Theaters in Asakusa had fully nude displays,&lt;ref name="Poitras 1999"/&gt; also featuring no motion or stripping. As this style of theater spread,&lt;ref name="Poitras 1999"/&gt; the removal of clothing on stage was integrated into the process.

Over time, as regulations were relaxed, a variety of acts developed with shows presenting a variety of movements such as taking a bath in an outdoor washtub.  One of the most famous variants had audience members given magnifying glasses for close up views.&lt;ref name="Poitras 1999"&gt;{{cite book | title = The anime companion: what's Japanese in Japanese animation? | url = https://books.google.com/?id=bu8ivrffg9cC | year = 1999 | publisher = Stone Bridge Press, Inc. | isbn = 978-1-880656-32-7 | pages = {{formatnum:535120}} | last1 = Poitras | first1 = Gilles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1950s, Japanese "strip shows" became more sexually explicit and less dance-oriented, until they were eventually simply [[live sex shows]].&lt;ref name="Shteir 2004"/&gt; The strip shows in Tokyo during this time remained low key, but Osaka and [[Kyoto]] were pushing the art of striptease in Japan into new territory.&lt;ref name="Louis Butterflies 1992"&gt;{{cite book | author = Lisa Louis | title = Butterflies of the night: mama-sans, geisha, strippers, and the Japanese men they serve | url = https://books.google.com/?id=VoS1AAAAIAAJ | accessdate = 2010-08-13 | date = 2008-07-25 | publisher = Tengu Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956, Osaka became the first city in Japan to have pubic hair on display during a strip show.&lt;ref name="Louis Butterflies 1992"/&gt; Dotonbori is a well known red light district in [[Osaka, Japan]] that has featured entertainment theaters and prostitution for hundreds of years.&lt;ref name="Adachi Bunraku 1978"&gt;{{cite book | author = Barbara C.

Peeping clubs, which feature peeping rooms (nozokibeya), are businesses where a customer views a girl through a hole from his own private cubicle.  The customer then pays to watch a girl strip, pose, and [[masturbate]]. [[Kabukichō, Tokyo|Kabukichō]], a [[red light district]] in Tokyo, had 13 nozoki-beya in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name="Poitras 2005"&gt;{{cite book | title = The Anime Companion 2: More What's Japanese in Japanese Animation? | url = https://books.google.com/?id=btG7QgAACAAJ | year = 2005 | publisher = Stone Bridge Press, Inc. | isbn = 978-1-880656-96-9 | page = 35 | last1 = Poitras | first1 = Gilles}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sex industry became so pervasive in Asia that by the 1990s, Kabukichō was described as a ''[[wikt:warren|warren]] of peep shows, strip clubs, and massage parlors'' and [[Bangkok, Thailand]] had attained a reputation as the sex capital of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Ashok K.

American-style strip clubs are often structured as [[nightclub]]s or [[Bar (establishment)|bars]]. High-end establishments are commonly referred to as "gentlemen's clubs",&lt;ref name="NYT StripOlympics 1996"/&gt; complete with [[Luxury good|luxury]] features and services.  More down-market competitors can be known by various names, such as titty bars, rippers, peelers, skin bars, girly bars, nudie bars, bikini bars or go-go bars.

Regardless of size, name, or location in the world, strip clubs can be full nude, topless or bikini.&lt;ref name="Frank 2002"&gt;{{cite book | last = Frank | first = Katherine | title = G-Strings and Sympathy: Strip Club Regulars and Male Desire | year = 2002 | publisher = Duke University Press | location = Durham and London | isbn = 978-0-8223-2972-5 | pages = 57–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="StPete Bikini 2010"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/crime/article1100220.ece | title = Police raid downtown St. Petersburg bikini bar | accessdate = 2010-06-08 | work = St. Petersburg Times | date = 2010-06-05 | last1 = Stanley | first1 = Kameel |archive-date= 9 June 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100609043122/http://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/crime/article1100220.ece }}&lt;/ref&gt; Where offered:

* [[Toplessness|Topless]] – The female performer's upper body is exposed but the genital area remains covered during a performance.
* [[Bikini]] – The female performer's breasts and genital area remain covered, such as go-go dancing.

For any of the three types of clubs there are exceptions based on the individual dancer and management.  The use of [[pasties]] can alter the legal interpretation as to whether a performance is topless or not and whether a [[sexually oriented business|business is sexually oriented]].&lt;ref name="Kens5 Pastie 2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kens5.com/home/Does-a-pastie-stuck-to-the-center-of-a-womans-breast-mean-shes-not-topless-93043489.html |title=City's debate: Is topless woman nude if she's wearing pasties? |accessdate=2010-06-20 |work=KENS 5-TV, Inc. |date=2010-05-06 |last1=Stanzilis |first1=Amanda |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100508230909/http://www.kens5.com/home/Does-a-pastie-stuck-to-the-center-of-a-womans-breast-mean-shes-not-topless-93043489.html |archivedate=2010-05-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A club might also hire or broadcast forms of entertainment other than striptease (such as [[pay-per-view]] events), for which it earns revenue via premium fees.  Some clubs have also moved into providing chat and broadcast services via the internet, including live video feeds.&lt;ref name="Carnes Compulsive 2007"&gt;{{cite book | last = Carnes | first = Patrick J. |author2=David L.

This fee will typically include a set fee for the room, for a fixed amount of time.&lt;ref name="StPeteTimes 2007"/&gt; Lap dances may also be offered during lingerie modeling sessions.  During a lap dance, the dancer rubs against the customer's crotch while he or she remains clothed, in an attempt to arouse or bring the recipient to climax.&lt;ref name="Bremer 2005"/&gt; Touching of strippers is not permitted in many localities, however, some dancers and clubs allow touching of dancers during private dances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Marc Cooper | title = The Last Honest Place in America: In Search of Paradise and Perdition in the New Las Vegas | url = https://books.google.com/?id=sT066iLvkO8C | accessdate = 2010-08-13 | year = 2004 | publisher = Nation Books | isbn = 978-1-56025-490-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = James Elias | title = Prostitution: on whores, hustlers, and johns | url = https://books.google.com/?id=vSMgAQAAIAAJ | accessdate = 2010-08-13 | date = 2009-11-06 | publisher = Prometheus Books | isbn = 978-1-57392-229-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some parts of the U.S., there are laws forbidding the exposure of female nipples, and thus dancers must cover their nipples with [[pasties]] to comply with those laws.&lt;ref name="VicTimes 2008"/&gt; Such clubs are known as ''pastie clubs''.

==== Striptease ====
{{Main|Striptease}}

A '''striptease''' is an [[erotic dance|erotic]] or exotic [[dance]] in which the performer gradually undresses, either partly or completely, in a [[seduction|seductive]] and sensual manner.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Wortley (1976) ''A Pictorial History of Striptease'': 11.&lt;/ref&gt; while doing so, the performer will make sure that the client feel warm, listened to and forget his problems. The main job of a stripper is to entertain and keep the clients on dreaming while being a semi "psychologist".The person who performs a striptease is commonly known as a "[[stripper]]" or exotic dancer. Most strippers are female, with less than a third of strippers being [[male stripper]]s.&lt;ref name="Bernard 2003"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bernard | first1 = Constance | last2 = DeGabrielle | first2 = C. | last3 = Cartier | first3 = L. | last4 = Monk-Turner | first4 = E. | last5 = Phill | first5 = C. | last6 = Sherwood | first6 = J. | last7 = Tyree | first7 = T. | year = 2003 | title = Exotic Dancers: Gender Differences in Societal Reaction, Subcultural Ties, and Conventional Support | journal = Journal of Criminal Justice and Popular Culture | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–11 | url = http://www.albany.edu/scj/jcjpc/vol10is1/bernard.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Striptease and public nudity have been subject to legal and cultural prohibitions and other aesthetic considerations and taboos. Restrictions on venues may be through venue licensing requirements and constraints and a wide variety of national and local laws. These laws vary considerably around the world, and even between different parts of the same country.

Striptease involves a slow, sensuous undressing. The stripper may prolong the undressing by making sure that the sensual build up has been properly done using techniques such as the wearing of actual [[clothes]] or putting clothes or hands in front of just undressed body parts such as the [[breast]]s or [[genitalia]] in a sensual and playful manner. The emphasis is on the act of undressing along with sexually suggestive movement, rather than the state of being undressed. In the past, the performance often finished as soon as the undressing was finished, though today's strippers usually continue dancing in the nude.&lt;ref name="Richard Wortley 1976" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lara Clifton (2002) ''Baby Oil and Ice: Striptease in East London''.&lt;/ref&gt; The costume the stripper wears before disrobing is part of the act. In some cases, audience interaction can form part of the act, with audience urging the stripper to remove more clothing, or the stripper approaching the audience to interact with them.

Unlike in burlesque theater, the modern popular form of strip theater can minimize the interaction of customer and dancer, reducing the importance of ''tease'' in the performance in favor of speed to undress.&lt;ref name="Roach Stripping 2007"/&gt; Most clubs have a dancer rotation where each dancer in turn will perform for one or more songs in a fixed sequence which repeats during a shift.&lt;ref name="WCP Archibalds 2009"/&gt; Less formal clubs will have dancers take turns when a stage becomes empty or have a free flow of entertainers where the stage has any number of entertainers who wander off and on at will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne%2BNews/Malaysia/Story/A1Story20090528-144373.html | title = Dancers who strip to lure more customers | publisher = News.asiaone.com | date = 2009-05-28 | accessdate = 2010-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Featured entertainers are not usually part of the rotation and they generally have set times when they will perform that are advertised throughout the shift.&lt;ref name="Roach Stripping 2007"/&gt; If a [[DJ]] is present, he or she will emcee the rotation and typically announce the current dancer(s) on stage and possibly whom to expect in future sets.

==== Private Dances ====
{{Main|Lap dancing|Peep shows}}

In [[peep shows]], done with a customer seated in a private booth separated from a dancer by glass or plastic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = David A. Scott | title = Behind the G-String: An Exploration of the Stripper's Image, Her Person and Her Meaning | url = https://books.google.com/?id=UAU3nPCTFXMC | accessdate = 2010-08-13 | date = October 2003 | publisher = McFarland | isbn = 978-0-7864-1849-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; there may be no music playing during a performance, in which the woman removes her clothes and displays her body to the customer.  In clubs which offer lingerie modeling shows, which are peep shows where a dancer privately dances and strips for a customer, typically without a barrier, performances can also be done with or without a formal stage or music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Jonathan Ames | title = What's Not to Love?: The Adventures of a Mildly Perverted Young Writer | url = https://books.google.com/?id=y5sFvQHA66cC | accessdate = 2010-08-13 | date = 2001-08-07 | publisher = Vintage | isbn = 978-0-375-72649-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Private dances in the main club zones most often take the form of [[table dance]]s, [[lap dance|lap and couch dances]], and [[bed dances]] among others.  An ''air dance'' is a particular form of private dance where little-to-no contact between the dancer and customer occurs.  This class of dance spans the different categories above and some dancers may perform air dances when more contact-heavy forms of dance were expected and paid for.  Club management may set standard prices for the various dance services, but individual strippers, where permitted, will negotiate their own prices, which may be higher or lower than the advertised rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Jodi O'Brien | title = The Production of Reality: Essays and Readings on Social Interaction | url = https://books.google.com/?id=29gyLFV6VkQC | accessdate = 2010-08-13 | date = 2005-07-20 | publisher = SAGE Publications, Incorporated | isbn = 978-1-4129-1519-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Table dances are distinguished from other forms of dances in that they can be performed where the customer is seated, on the main floor.&lt;ref name="AskMen HowTo 2002"/&gt;  ''Table dance'' may also refer to a form of minimal-touch private dance where the performer is physically located on a small table in front of the customer(s).  Table dances should not be confused with table stages, where the stripper is at or above eye level on a platform surrounded by chairs and usually enough table surface for customers to place drinks and tip money.

[[File:Lapdance Exhibition Eros Pyramide 2009.jpg|left|thumb|[[Exotic dancer]]s performing a [[lap dance]] at a lap dancing exposition. |alt=refer to caption]]
Where offered, lap dances are performed in all manner of locations and seating,&lt;ref name="StPeteTimes 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KFBB 2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kfbb.com/news/local/95553964.html |title=Former Great Falls Mayor Sentenced to One Year in Jail Over Involvement in Prostitution Ring |accessdate=2010-06-06 |work=KFBB-TV |date=2010-06-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605042357/http://www.kfbb.com/news/local/95553964.html |archivedate=2010-06-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ranging from plain stools and kitchen-grade chairs to plush leather armchairs.  They can also be performed with the customer standing in these designated areas.  A service provided by many clubs is for a customer to be placed on stage with one or more dancers for a public lap dance.  Occasions for this type of performance are [[bachelor parties]] and birthdays, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = David Boyer | title = Bachelor Party Confidential: A Real-Life Peek Behind the Closed-Door Tradition | url = https://books.google.com/?id=wXAKk9wAHc4C | accessdate = 2010-08-13 | date = 2007-04-24 | publisher = Gallery | isbn = 978-1-4169-2808-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bed dance areas require more space because they are designed for the customer to be prone with the entertainer(s) positioned on top of them.  Bed dances are the least common of the three, and in many clubs are a more expensive option than a lap dance because of the novelty and increased level of contact between customer and service provider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tampagov.net/appl_Cable_Communications_closed_captioning/frmAgenda.asp?pkey=171&amp;txtValidPage=1&amp;txtPrevPage=index.asp&amp;txtNextPage=frmAgenda.asp |title=Tampa City Council – meeting transcription detail |publisher=Tampagov.net |date=1998-06-05 |accessdate=2010-08-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128122723/http://www.tampagov.net/appl_Cable_Communications_closed_captioning/frmAgenda.asp?pkey=171&amp;txtValidPage=1&amp;txtPrevPage=index.asp&amp;txtNextPage=frmAgenda.asp |archivedate=2011-11-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Customer service ===
{{Main|Customer service}}

Strip clubs are profit-oriented businesses like [[restaurant]]s and other [[retail]] establishments. Performers and staff are the primary customer service representatives in the club environment. Dancers are their primary vehicle to entice customers to spend time and money in the establishment.&lt;ref name="Wosick-Correa 2008"/&gt;

==== Interaction ====
[[File:Models in Break Area at Miami Eroticaxxx 2009.jpg|thumb|left|Performers [[Theater (structure)#On and off stage|backstage]] tending to their props away from the audience. |alt=refer to caption]]
Dancers continually interact with the customers in the club.  They walk around and solicit drinks and lap dances, usually scanning the club floor to find the most lucrative customer to greet.  The dancer qualifies a customer by sizing up their [[Human physical appearance|appearance]] and personal characteristics.  Once the dancer identifies a suitable customer, she approaches, and attempts to establish a social relationship.  Interaction can also be initiated by customers.&lt;ref name="Wosick-Correa 2008"/&gt;  Clubs generate revenue by cover charges, selling drinks, and other means.  Dancers make most of their income from giving [[lap dance]]s or VIP dances, where regulations allow.  Otherwise, customer tips, at the stage, are a dancer's primary form of income.&lt;ref name="Wosick-Correa 2008"/&gt; Dancers are entertaining the customers in exchange for money and employing all of the resources at their disposal to do so.  They sell the fantasy of sex, but do not typically follow through with the act.&lt;ref name="Bernard 2003"/&gt;

==== Cultural norms and policies ====
[[File:AdelitaBar.jpg|right|thumb|Exterior of Adelita Bar, in [[Tijuana, Mexico]] |alt=refer to caption]]
Rules governing strip clubs and the overall [[adult entertainment industry]] vary around the world and formats sometimes are combined under a single roof or complex.  In [[Bangkok]], Thailand, the [[Nana Plaza|Nana Entertainment Plaza]] in downtown Bangkok is a large, four-floor compound with over 40 bars.  Most of the bars are go-go bars with dancers in various stages of nudity.  They are not formal brothels, since customers must negotiate without an intermediary, directly with the dancers, for services up to and including sex.&lt;ref name="AskMen TopBroth 2008"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.askmen.com/top_10/dating/top-10-brothels_7.html | title = Top 10: Brothels | accessdate = 2010-06-11 | work = AskMen.com | date = 2008-07-26 | last1 = Bee Gee | first1 = Dylan}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zürich]], Switzerland has legalized prostitution and its strip clubs throughout the city offer sex among their services.

== Facilities ==
[[File:Main Stage Montys in Victoria, BC CAN.jpg|right|thumb|Performer on the main stage of Monty's Showroom Pub at [[Victoria, British Columbia]], Canada. |alt=refer to caption]]

Most strip clubs are located in buildings that are converted bars, [[restaurant]]s, or warehouses, or had industrial uses.  The original layout of the building will affect the physical layout of a club.  The more money that has been invested in a facility, the more it resembles a dedicated club.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/12/christopher-sturman_n_4256792.html|title=Inside of a Strip Club|newspaper=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-22|date=2013-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}  Regardless of the [[floorplan]], as [[interactive theatre|interactive theater]], there are features every strip club will have. They include: [[Strip club#Performers|performers (strippers)]], a [[Strip club#Floor and seating|floor area]] where the customers will congregate, and some form of [[Strip club#Main stage|staging]] for the striptease performance.&lt;ref name="WCP Archibalds 2009"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/citydesk/2009/02/19/strip-club-way-less-depressing-than-the-rest-of-dc/ | title = Strip Club: Way Less Depressing Than The Rest of D.C.! | accessdate = 2010-06-06 | work = Washington City Paper | date = 2009-02-19 | last1 = Hess | first1 = Amanda}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Higher-end gentlemen's clubs have features that cost millions of dollars to install and maintain.&lt;ref name="Sapphire Sale 2006"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2006/Jan-24-Tue-2006/business/5504641.html | title = SAPPHIRE SOLD : Strip club bids bring $80 million | accessdate = 2010-06-05 | work = Las Vegas Review-Journal | date = 2006-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== General admission areas ===
The floor area is open for [[general admission]]. A customer is free to wander around the club, except for employee areas and premium lounges.&lt;ref name="Bremer 2005"&gt;{{cite book | editor = Egan, R.

All clubs are configured differently. A small club can have a single room, with an [[Stage (theatre)#Created and found spaces|improvised stage]] for the striptease show. Many clubs have more than the basic [[amenities]]. Larger clubs have clearer designations of areas. The different areas within a club could be separated by a physical step, [[wikt:built-in|built-in]] railing, platforms and levels, doorways, distinct rooms, and entirely separate floors, and they can also be formed by different carpeting, placement of seating, or physical [[wikt:implement#Noun|implements]] such as a rope or other physical marker.

==== Floor and seating ====
[[File:Strip Club Customers Seated at Tip Rail.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Customers seated by the tip rail at Club Live in [[Scheveningen]], [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]]. |alt=refer to caption]]

Most entertainment takes place in the main floor area, and this is where performers and staff can interact with patrons. Customers get comfortable in this area and from their observations, they decide which club services they will use.  The main stage is visible from the main floor, and the main bar is accessible, if one is present. Patrons can usually select from open seating and some clubs will have staff to assist with seating. If premium seating is provided, club staff will usually manage access to those areas.&lt;ref name="AskMen HowTo 2002"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.askmen.com/money/how_to_60/60_how_to.html | title = How To: Behave In Strip Clubs | accessdate = 2010-06-06 | date = 2002-10-23 | work = AskMen.com | last1 = Richer | first1 = Steve}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the day, time and staffing levels, accessibility of the general admission areas may vary. Larger clubs will rope off or otherwise close sections of the club to customers unless the size of the crowd warrants use of the space. Larger clubs could have multiple floor, bar, seating, and staging areas which are managed in a similar manner.

==== Main stage ====
{{Main|Main_stage#Strip_clubs|l1=Main stage}}
A [[main stage]] is where a featured performer will dance as part of a rotation.&lt;ref name="WCP Archibalds 2009"/&gt; In most clubs the main stage is a dominant feature of the layout and the center of activity.&lt;ref name="Frank 2002"/&gt; A common type of strip club main stage is the [[thrust stage]], also known as a [[Runway (fashion)|runway]] stage,&lt;ref name="Liepe-Levinson StripShow 2002"/&gt; but the other major forms are also used regularly. [[Theatre in the round]] is also a popular form of strip club staging for the main stage.  During each set of one or more songs, the current performer will dance on stage.  A dancer collects tips from customers either while on stage or while mingling with the audience after her performance.  A customary tip (where customers can do so at the stage) is a dollar [[paper currency|bill]] folded lengthwise and placed in the dancer's [[garter (stockings)|garter]] from the ''tip rail''.&lt;ref name="Roach Stripping 2007"&gt;{{cite book | author = Catherine M.

It is referred to in slang as "ringside", "gynecology row", "pervert row", and other names.&lt;ref name="Roach Stripping 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Scott | first = David | title = Behind the G-String | year = 2003 | publisher = McFarland &amp; Company | location = Jefferson | isbn = 978-0-7864-1849-7 | pages = 10, 147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many stages have actual railing built on or around the stage to function as the tip railing, in addition to indicating where customers should position themselves relative to the [[performance]] zone.  Customers take turns tipping the dancer.&lt;ref name="WCP Archibalds 2009"/&gt;  They may also line up to tip popular performers.  If physical railing is not present, the tip rail is the edge of stage or defined performance area.  Other common tip methods are to insert the dollar into the stripper's [[Cleavage (breasts)|cleavage]] from the hand or mouth, to simply place it or toss it on stage, or to crumple bills into a ball shape and throw them in the entertainer's direction.&lt;ref name="Maxi Mounds"&gt;{{cite book | author = Maxi Mounds | title = The Maxi Mounds Guide to the World of Exotic Dancing | url = https://books.google.com/?id=qb-Nsr7JrT4C | accessdate = 2010-08-13 | date = 2004-01-15 | publisher = Perpetual Summer Pub | isbn = 978-0-9734333-1-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Tailhook 91: Events at the 35th Annual Tailhook Symposium | url = https://books.google.com/?id=CzltjN1pX8cC | accessdate = 2010-08-13 | date = 1993-01-31 | publisher = DIANE Publishing | isbn = 978-0-7881-0117-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Jim Norton | title = Happy Endings: The Tales of a Meaty-Breasted Zilch | url = https://books.google.com/?id=-10GnYZ7yXkC | accessdate = 2010-08-13 | date = 2007-07-10 | publisher = Simon and Schuster | isbn = 978-1-4169-5022-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each club and dancer has different tolerance levels for customer interaction, including tipping.  Some clubs have multiple stages on the premises.

==== Optional staging ====
Satellite staging includes one or more areas where a stripper can perform other than a main stage and private dances.&lt;ref name="Liepe-Levinson StripShow 2002"&gt;{{cite book | author = Katherine Liepe-Levinson | title = Strip Show: Performances of Gender and Desire | url = https://books.google.com/?id=dV8_mGp_89gC | accessdate = 2010-08-13 | year = 2002 | publisher = Psychology Press | isbn = 978-0-415-17381-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = T.

Some strip clubs consider ad-hoc performances on satellite stages, paid for by a customer on a per song basis, a form of ''private dance''.  Rules at the satellite stages on the main floor tend to be the same as the [[Strip club#Main stage|main stage]].  In some cases, the layout is significantly different allowing more or less access to the customer.  If a satellite stage is located in a [[Strip club#Premium access zones|premium access zone]], access to the dancer could be considerably greater since the higher level of service can include a less restrictive policy than enforced on the [[Strip club#Floor and seating|main floor]]. [[Lap dance]], [[peep show]], and lingerie modeling clubs might only have satellite stages with [[pay to play]] entertainment options on their premises.

Novelty acts (such as shower shows, [[Fire dancing#Modern developments in fire performance|fire shows]], and [[Mud wrestling#Variations|oil wrestling]]) can be presented on dedicated stages, temporary staging on the floor, or on the main stage itself depending on the club.&lt;ref name="Holsopple 1998"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.object.org.uk/files/Strip_club_study%20Holsopple.pdf |title=Stripclubs According to Strippers: Exposing Workplace Sexual Violence |accessdate=2010-06-21 |work=The Freedom and Justice Center for Prostitution Resources |year=1998 |last1=Holsopple |first1=Kelly |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320163143/http://www.object.org.uk/files/Strip_club_study%20Holsopple.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AP StripFire 2008"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,348049,00.html | title = Louisiana Stripper Burned in Flame-Blowing Dance Routine | accessdate = 2010-06-21 | agency = Associated Press | date = 2008-04-08 | last1 =  | first1 =  | work = Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chillico OilWrestleZoning 2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chillicothegazette.com/article/20100607/NEWS01/6060301/Chillicothe-open-for-adult-business- |title=Chillicothe open for adult business? |accessdate=2010-06-21 |work=Chillicothe Gazette |date=2010-06-07 |last1=Genson |first1=Loren |last2=Ison |first2=Jona |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610233913/http://www.chillicothegazette.com/article/20100607/NEWS01/6060301/Chillicothe-open-for-adult-business- |archivedate=June 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main stage, if used, must be prepared and possibly covered to prevent damage, as accidents and injuries have been reported during these types of striptease performances.&lt;ref name="WorldNow StripFire 2008"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ksla.com/global/story.asp?s=8122160 | title = Shreveport Fire Dept.

Shower shows require special equipment, so they are more likely to have a dedicated stage in the club with house dancers performing in the show. Optional staging can be present on the main floor or in dedicated rooms throughout larger clubs.&lt;ref name="AskMen HowTo 2002"/&gt;

==== Bars and counters ====
{{Main|Bar (counter)}}
[[File:SR Van Nuys Bar.jpg|right|thumb|The main bar of [[Spearmint Rhino]] [[Van Nuys]] in [[Los Angeles, California]], U.S. with built-in stage. Main stage in background.|alt=refer to caption]]

A full bar is the primary service mechanism for clubs that offer [[alcoholic beverage]]s.  In many clubs the main bar is the second most dominant element on the floor after the main stage,&lt;ref name="KFBB 2009"/&gt; and in some cases the main (or satellite) stage is built into the bar.  Clubs can derive large percentages of their income from drink purchases.  For both Rick's Cabaret and VCGH, Inc., service revenues were the single largest revenue source, with sales of alcoholic beverages second.  VCGH earned 18% more and RICK 27.5% more in service revenue than alcohol sales.  The amounts are closer when food ''and'' merchandise sales are considered, with RICK reporting a smaller gap between the two revenue sources relative to VCGH.&lt;ref name="VCGH 2009 10-K"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RICK 2009 10-K"/&gt; Upscale clubs that offer food can have [[wikt:free-standing|free-standing]] or [[wikt:built-in|built-in]] bars for [[buffet]] service.  Otherwise, food orders might be taken at the main bar or by waitstaff.

Consumption of alcohol is often facilitated via direct sales in strip clubs where such sales are legal, appropriately [[zoning|zoned]], and [[Liquor license|licensed]].&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite book | author = Alan Markovitz |author2=Thomas Stevens  | title = Topless Prophet: The True Story of America's Most Successful Gentleman's Club Entrepreneur | url = https://books.google.com/?id=bM6gcaL3uCAC | accessdate = 2010-08-13 | date = 2009-10-01 | publisher = Greenleaf Book Group | isbn = 978-0-9840855-0-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some clubs that are not licensed to serve alcohol will work around the restriction by implementing a [[BYOB|bring your own beverage (BYOB)]] policy and a [[juice bar]].  Juice bars have the appointments of full bars but only serve non-alcoholic beverages such as water, [[fruit juice]], and flavored [[carbonated beverage]]s.  Such a bar could double as a service counter for the storage of BYOB material and offer ice and mixing services to create mixed drinks using the customer-purchased ingredients.  Where [[waitstaff]] are present, they may serve as an extension of the bar service; providing and refreshing drinks while maintaining the cleanliness of the seating areas.

Many clubs have a lobby area where the cover charge, if any, is collected by a doorman or doorwoman and security personnel can do a quick check of prospective customers as they enter the facility.&lt;ref name="KDH 2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kdhnews.com/news/story.aspx?s=41159 |title=Teen girl employed by Killeen strip club |accessdate=2010-06-06 |work=Killeen Daily Herald |date=2010-04-30 |last1=O'Brien |first1=Victor |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123150036/http://kdhnews.com/news/story.aspx?s=41159 |archivedate=2010-11-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Game]]s are also a common feature of strip clubs. [[Arcade game|Arcade]] and [[gambling]] machines are popular features, as are [[pool tables]]. Some clubs also have dedicated areas of the main floor dedicated to performing ''private dance'' services.&lt;ref name="StPeteTimes 2007"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sptimes.com/2007/12/27/Hernando/Patron_dies_in_privat.shtml | title = Patron dies in private room of strip club | accessdate = 2010-06-05 | work = St. Petersburg Times | date = 2007-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Premium access zones ===

Access to certain parts of a strip club can require payment of an additional fee,&lt;ref name="AskMen HowTo 2002"/&gt; or can be by invitation. These areas offer features that are not present in the general admission areas.  This approach might allow a club to offer different types and standards of services in the various areas, or to comply with local laws.  In this setting, [[very important person|VIP]]s such as high rollers or persons of a wider popular celebrity, may receive complimentary services according to their reputation with the club personnel.&lt;ref name="ESPN GoldClub 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2006/Apr-13-Thu-2006/news/6846312.html | title = News – Ex-strip club manager describes bribes | publisher = reviewjournal.com | date = 2006-04-13 | accessdate = 2010-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''VIP seating'' adjacent to the main floor is often more comfortable. For example, arm chairs or couches may be provided, and may include booths with service tables.  The area typically has a clear line of sight to the main stage.  Reserve seating gives a customer a sense of importance and demonstrates prestige.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Katherine Frank | title = G-Strings and Sympathy: Strip Club Regulars and Male Desire | url = https://books.google.com/?id=AJdAErefhWgC | accessdate = 2010-08-13 | date = December 2002 | publisher = Duke University Press Books | isbn = 978-0-8223-2972-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In higher-end clubs, [[VIP]] seating might include balconies and other overlooks, which might also include smaller stages for a private dance if the customer wishes,&lt;ref name="Frank 2002"/&gt; at an additional fee. VIP seating can also act as lap dance booths, where a higher lap dance price would apply than in the general area.&lt;ref name="AskMen HowTo 2002"/&gt;

''VIP rooms'' are partitioned areas in a club that are typically enclosed by fixed walls and can have doors that close completely.  For such rooms that do not offer solid doors, there is usually some type of blind system with [[Bead stringing|stringed beads]], [[curtain]]s, or other screening implements.  Couch rooms, private dance rooms,&lt;ref name="StPeteTimes 2007"/&gt; and lounges are also forms of VIP zones.&lt;ref name="AskMen HowTo 2002"/&gt; VIP rooms have seating that is more plush than the general admission zones and the VIP seating adjacent to the main floor.  Often, purchase of access to the room includes customer time with the dancer(s) of their choice.  Some rooms are outfitted with props and appliances, such as showers, hot tubs, and various types of bedding.&lt;ref name="AskMen HowTo 2002"/&gt;

A ''champagne room'' (also called a ''champagne lounge'', or ''champagne court'') is a specialized VIP Room service offered by gentlemen's clubs where a customer can purchase time (usually in half-hour increments) with an exotic dancer in a private room on the premises. Depending on the quality of the club, these rooms, which are typically away from the hustle and bustle of the main club, are generally well decorated and usually appointed with a private bar.  Clubs sell [[Champagne (wine)|champagne]] by the glass or by the bottle for both the dancer and the customer. Some clubs also offer food and/or [[cigar]] service. News media outlets have reported incidents of champagne room charges into the tens and hundreds of thousands of U.S. dollars for a single visit.&lt;ref name="SmokingGun 2005"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/1021051scores1.html/ | title = Exec Sued Over $241,000 Strip Club Tab | accessdate = 2010-06-05 | work = The Smoking Gun | date = 2005-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Limited access zones ===
Portions of the club used only for the [[Business operations|operation]] and [[Janitor|maintenance]] typically have access restricted to staff and performers.&lt;ref name="Wosick-Correa 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wosick-Correa |first1=Kassia R. |last2=Joseph |first2=L.

This business practice does not differ significantly from what is seen in other customer service businesses such as [[retail store]]s and [[restaurant]]s. More frequently seen are entry booths, where security staff monitor customers entering and leaving the club and collect the [[cover charge]], and the [[DJ]] booth, where the DJ operates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = SPIN Media LLC | title = SPIN | url = https://books.google.com/?id=BhhSYcXeTVoC | accessdate = 2010-08-13 | date = November 2004 | publisher = SPIN Media LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DJ booth contains sound, lighting, and other equipment which is used to "orchestrate the crowd" by adjusting the club environment, and is equivalent to a [[control room]] in a traditional [[theater]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Catherine M.

Dancers use dressing rooms to prepare for performances, rest between performances, and stow any of their belongings not secured by other means.&lt;ref name="Wosick-Correa 2008"/&gt; It is customary for disputes between club [[personnel]] to be handled off the floor and out of sight of patrons.  Dressing rooms are commonly used for performer-only mediation, though this could shift into other areas of discussion if management is involved.  Clubs are experimenting with granting greater access to restricted areas via technology.&lt;ref name="Carnes Compulsive 2007"/&gt; The service includes a live view into part of the backstage dressing room and paid access enables the website user to interact live with dancers at the club.  Security of club [[asset]]s and personnel are a primary driver for limiting access to these zones.

{{Main|Stripper}}
[[File:Exotic Dancer On Stage 002.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Stripper]] performing on stage at Cabaret Kalesa in [[Rio de Janeiro, Brazil]]. |alt=refer to caption]]

Performers are called ''strippers'', ''exotic dancers'', just ''dancers'', or ''entertainers''.  Strippers are the primary draw for any club. Dancers effectively entertaining customers are the key to generating revenue by keeping customers on site and enticing them to be repeat visitors.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; The image of strippers (as known today) evolved through the late [[Striptease#1960s-1970s|1960s and 1970s]] in the U.S. and international cultures that embraced [[Americanized]] striptease; introduced into popular culture by the genre-defining performances of [[Carol Doda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Mick Sinclair | title = San Francisco: a cultural and literary history | url = https://books.google.com/?id=4395AAAAMAAJ | accessdate = 2010-08-13 | year = 2004 | publisher = Interlink Pub Group Inc | isbn = 978-1-56656-489-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1980s, the pole dancing and highly explicit imagery associated with today's performers was widely accepted and frequently portrayed in film, television, and theater.  ''House dancers'' work for a particular club or [[franchising|franchise]].&lt;ref name="WP House 2009"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/12/AR2010031202154.html | title = Exotic dancer uses labor law to sue D.C. club over wages | accessdate = 2010-06-06 | work = Washington Post | date = 2009-03-15 | last1 = Schwartzman | first1 = Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Feature dancers'' tend to have their own [[celebrity]], touring a club circuit and making appearances.&lt;ref name="NYT StripOlympics 1996"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/08/us/dancers-follow-the-olympic-flame-and-the-money-to-atlanta-s-stripclubs.html?pagewanted=1 | title = Dancers Follow the Olympic Flame, and the Money, to Atlanta's StripClubs | accessdate = 2010-07-03 | work = New York Times | date = 1996-07-08 | last1 = Applebome | first1 = Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;{{cite book | author = James Oliver Cury | title = The Playboy Guide to Bachelor Parties: Everything You Need to Know About Planning the Groom's Rite of Passage-From Simple to Sinful | url = https://books.google.com/?id=HB9XE7QlsawC | accessdate = 2010-08-13 | date = 2003-05-27 | publisher = Touchstone | isbn = 978-0-7432-4562-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pornographic film actor|Porn stars]] will often become feature dancers to earn extra income and build their fan base.&lt;ref name="Schlosser 1997"/&gt; High-profile adult film performers [[Jenna Haze]] and [[Teagan Presley]], among others, have participated in feature shows through the U.S., as did now-retired stars such as [[Jenna Jameson]].&lt;ref name=aneda&gt;{{cite web | title = Carmen Hart, Jenna Haze Capture Exotic Dancer Awards | publisher = AVN.com | url = http://business.avn.com/articles/31985.html | author = Dan Miller | date = 2008-08-28 | accessdate = 2008-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.xbiz.com/news/video/100572 | title = NightMoves Winners Announced | accessdate = 2008-11-21 | author = Tod Hunter | date = 2008-10-28 | publisher = xbiz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Ross Dale | title = Embedded: Confessions of a TV Sex Journalist | url = https://books.google.com/?id=LCbBse1srn4C | accessdate = 2010-08-13 | date = 2008-06-01 | publisher = Sourcebooks, Inc. | isbn = 978-1-4022-1217-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Work environments ====
In some localities strippers are required to obtain permits to work in adult entertainment.&lt;ref name="ALC 24K 2009"/&gt; During a bikini performance, both [[breasts]] and [[Genital#Genitals|genital]] areas typically remain covered by revealing attire, while dancers provide services and entertainment. Go-go dancers will retain their tops and bottoms for the duration of their performance. A female stripper whose [[torso|upper body]] is exposed, but whose genital areas remain obscured during a performance, is said to be [[Toplessness|topless]]. Strippers who uncover the genital areas along with other clothing during a performance are said to be dancing fully nude. The fully nude practice is banned in many jurisdictions,&lt;ref name="StPete Bikini 2010"/&gt; but many dancers work around these [[Regulation|constraint]]s by selective uncovering of the [[vulva]], [[anus]], or both, for short periods of time, followed by immediate replacement of the clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = A.

Strippers can sometimes be contracted for performances outside the strip club environment.&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt; Strippers with ready access to the Internet away from work have also adopted [[social media]] and [[social networks|networks]] as a less intrusive way of maintaining direct connections with customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/pcworld/20100716/tc_pcworld/refreshedmyspacedesperatelyseeksusers |title=Refreshed MySpace Desperately Seeks Users |publisher=News.yahoo.com |date=2010-07-17 |accessdate=2010-08-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100720150932/http://news.yahoo.com/s/pcworld/20100716/tc_pcworld/refreshedmyspacedesperatelyseeksusers |archivedate=July 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jenn Shreve |url=https://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2006/04/70675 |title=MySpace Faces a Perp Problem |publisher=Wired.com |date=2006-04-18 |accessdate=2010-08-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100809112612/http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2006/04/70675 |archivedate=2010-08-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others use the internet to generate revenue by performing via [[webcam]], recording premium content, or running their own subscriber-based web site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/?id=54varRsWk9MC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=strippers+webcam#v=onepage&amp;q=strippers%20webcam&amp;f=false | title = The Trade in Human Beings: Oral and ... | accessdate = 2010-08-13 | isbn = 978-0-215-53021-9 | year = 2009| last1 = Committee | first1 = Great Britain: Parliament: House of Commons: Home Affairs }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Jacki Willson | title = The Happy Stripper: Pleasures and Politics of the New Burlesque | url = https://books.google.com/?id=BTiP4-1O0bUC | accessdate = 2010-08-13 | date = 2008-01-08 | publisher = I.

This can include erotic and [[nude photography|nude modeling]], [[pornography]], [[Escort agency|escorting]], and in some cases [[prostitution]].  Outside the U.S., the use of strip clubs to facilitate sex-for-hire is much more common and stripping in those settings is viewed as [[advertising]] for [[sexually oriented business]] that will be performed in either private areas of the club or off-premises.&lt;ref name="Shteir 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EuroSex Zurich 2007"/&gt;

==== Social interaction ====
Research suggests that exotic dancing can pay well, but often at significant cost to the stripper.&lt;ref name="Ronai and Ellis 1989"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ronai | first1 = C. R. | last2 = Ellis | first2 = C. | year = 1989 | title = Turn-ons for money: Interactional strategies of the table dancer | journal = Journal of Contemporary Ethnography | volume = 118 | issue = 3 | pages = 271–298 | doi=10.1177/089124189018003002}}&lt;/ref&gt; One reason for this is the negative stigma associated with exotic dancing.  Not all dancers are affected equally.  Some dancers manage this stigma by dividing "the social world" and only revealing part of their identity.&lt;ref name="Thompson and Harred 1992"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1080/01639625.1992.9967914 | last1 = Thompson | first1 = W.

L. | year = 1989 | title = Topless dancers: Managing stigma in a deviant occupation | journal = Deviant Behavior | volume = 13 | pages = 291–311 | issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; By revealing only a part of themselves, strippers may avoid being characterized by the stigmatizing attributes associated with exotic dancing.&lt;ref name="Bernard 2003"/&gt; Outside the club, dancers are indistinguishable by [[Human physical appearance|appearance]] from the [[Demographic analysis#Population Composition|general population]] and no more likely to be the targets of acts like [[violent crime]] than are other women.&lt;ref name="Kelvin 2007"&gt;{{cite book | last = Kelvin | first = T.

Research indicates that at some point every dancer has felt [[Exploitation of labour|exploited]] by customers, management, or other dancers.  The most common complaint from dancers is being portrayed as an object or instrument, rather than as a person.&lt;ref name="Boles and Garbin 1974"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McGaghy and Skipper 1969"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1525/sp.1969.17.2.03a00100 | last1 = McCaghy | first1 = C.H. | last2 = Skipper | first2 = J.K. | year = 1969 | title = Lesbian behavior as an adaptation to the occupation of stripping | journal = Social Problems | volume = 17 | pages = 262–270 | issue = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; While dancers feel this exploitation and are affected by it, they also admit that they exploit their customers.&lt;ref name="Bell, Sloan, and Stickling 1998"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1177/088610999801300306 | last1 = Bell | first1 = H. | last2 = Sloan | first2 = L. | last3 = Stickling | first3 = C. | year = 1998 | title = Exploiter or Exploited: Topless Dancers Reflect on their Experiences | journal = Affilia: Journal of Women and Social World | volume = 13 | pages = 352–365 | issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Primary staff ===
Additional club staff almost always includes a club manager, as dancer-run clubs are rare.  One or more [[managers]] are responsible for day-to-day operations on behalf of the club owner.&lt;ref name="WSJ ClubMgr 2009"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123447503728679243 | title = A Reporter Faces the Naked Truth | accessdate = 2010-06-06 | work = Wall Street Journal | date = 2009-02-13 | last1 = Helliker | first1 = Kevin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Managerial responsibilities include money handling, inventory, and hiring and firing of employee staff and contractors.

=== Ancillary staff ===
Strip clubs have a variety of configurations and staffing needs.  Some clubs employ a host to [[emcee]] the show, in addition to a DJ.  Hosts are more common in busier clubs or shifts, and during special, such as amateur night and featured acts.

American-style striptease, closely associated with contemporary clubs around the world, began to appear outside North America in the post-World War II era, emerging in Asian performances during the late 1940s and in European theaters by 1950.&lt;ref name="Shteir 2004"/&gt; A contemporary example, the American [[Spearmint Rhino]] chain, has clubs located in the UK, Russia, and Australia, as well as the United States.

Strip clubs which practice [[Generally Accepted Accounting Principles| Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)]] typically report negative [[working capital]], where [[current liabilities]] exceed [[current assets]].  Clubs receive immediate [[cash]] [[payment]] for [[sales]], while [[inventories]], [[accrued expense]]s, and other current liabilities normally carry longer [[Payment schedule|payment terms]].  The practice is believed to increase [[Net profit|net cash]] provided by [[Business operations|operating activities]].&lt;ref name="VCGH 2009 10-K"/&gt; Service revenues include entertainer payments to perform at clubs, customer admission fees, customer payments for tabs and tip charges, dance dollar payments, and suite rental fees.&lt;ref name="VCGH 2009 10-K"/&gt; The economic downturn, which accelerated in 2008, impacted clubs at all levels, and even higher-end gentlemen's clubs in some parts of the U.S. and elsewhere adjusted their [[business practice]]s to compensate for reduced revenues.&lt;ref name="WSJ Slump 2009"/&gt;

=== Business practices ===
Strip clubs can operate at all hours, depending on regulations and revenue.  It is a common business practice to have a reduced door charge or no entry fee at all during daytime.  Clubs that are open for more than just the nighttime hours may incorporate a staggered or [[shift work]] [[Schedule (workplace)|schedule]] for their entertainers and staff.  External factors, such as location and public perception, have some impact on business, but the essential draw of the strip club is the live entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Jill Nagle | title = Whores and Other Feminists | url = https://books.google.com/?id=WBDRYi9B3TwC | accessdate = 2010-08-13 | year = 1997 | publisher = Psychology Press | isbn = 978-0-415-91822-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of negative perceptions of the adult entertainment industry, many clubs engage in public displays of charity to generate goodwill.  VCGH clubs, in order to be good corporate citizens, actively sponsor and participate in local charitable events and contribute to local charities.&lt;ref name="VCGH 2009 10-K"/&gt; Some clubs also register their business entities using benign names, so that they appear to be businesses unrelated to the sex industry on receipts and financial statements, and as a means of discretion.&lt;ref name="Jeffreys 2009"/&gt; Cameras (including camera phones) and other recording devices are often banned from strip clubs to "protect the identity of the women working there and to spare the blushes of men caught on film attending the club".&lt;ref name="BBC CamBan 2003"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/2916353.stm | title = Furtive phone photography spurs ban | accessdate = 2010-07-05 | work = BBC News | date = 2003-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among clubs, there is a variety of different ways to deliver entertainment, and fee structures commonly differ between clubs.  A [[cover charge]] (entry fee also known as a ''door charge'') is customary at many clubs,&lt;ref name="BNC bucks 1996"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.allbusiness.com/north-america/united-states-north-carolina/591865-1.html | title = Bucks naked: here's the bottom line on running a topless club | accessdate = 2010-05-07 | work = Business North Carolina | date = 1996-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; the amount of which can vary by factors such as day of visit, [[time of day]], [[gender]], and other factors.  To make the charge more acceptable to customers, some clubs include bonus items in the admission price, such as [[drink ticket]]s that can be redeemed once inside.  Some clubs also have drink fees tied to interaction with performers.&lt;ref name="AskMen HowTo 2002"/&gt; The bigger the drink, the longer the time permitted with the dancer.  This practice is more common in European strip clubs and African or Asian [[hostess club]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Wanjohi Kibicho | title = Sex Tourism in Africa: Kenya's Booming Industry | url = https://books.google.com/?id=044mTY1ExgEC | accessdate = 2010-08-13 | date = 2009-11-06 | publisher = Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. | isbn = 978-0-7546-7460-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Champagne Room pricing (where time with an exotic dancer in a private room on the premises can be purchased) is a variation on that same theme.

In the U.S., striptease dancers are generally classified as [[independent contractor]]s.  A few smaller strip clubs may pay a weekly [[wage]] but, in most cases, a dancer's income is derived entirely from tips and other fees, which they collect from customers.  In most clubs, dancers must pay a "stage fee" or "house fee" to work a given shift.&lt;ref name="BNC bucks 1996"/&gt; In these cases, strippers receive payment in the form of [[Tip (gratuity)|tips]] and payment for specific services offered by the club (such as [[lap dances]]).  Many clubs also take a percentage of fees charged for each private dance.  It is also customary{{snd}}and often required in the United States{{snd}}for dancers to pay a "tip out", usually at the end of their shift, to the supporting staff, such as [[DJ]]s, house moms, [[make-up artist]]s, [[waiting staff|server]]s, [[bartender]]s, and [[bouncer (doorman)|bouncer]]s.  This can be a set fee or a percentage of money earned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stripper-faq.org/money.htm|title=stripper-faq: making money|author=Kiko Wu|date=2000|work=stripper-faq.org|accessdate=27 November 2015 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170125075706/http://www.stripper-faq.org/money.htm |archive-date=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the customer, the [[fee]] structure of a club is determined by management [[policy]].

In many smaller clubs, multiple staff roles are filled by the same person, such as a bartender and manager.  In extreme cases, one person fills all the support functions within a club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = T A Kevlin | title = Headless Man in Topless Bar: Studies of 725 Cases of Strip Club Related Criminal Homicides | url = https://books.google.com/?id=UOlvBffVlt8C | accessdate = 2010-08-13 | date = April 2007 | publisher = Dog Ear Pub Llc | isbn = 978-1-59858-324-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some clubs hire attractive women onto the staff, as bartenders and shot girls, to complement the strippers.

==== Marketing ====
The ability to attract first-time patrons is critical to a nightclub's success.  As such, promotions, advertising, and special offers are the typical means to market a nightclub.  Marketing strategies for strip clubs include attracting new customers, increasing the frequency of visits by existing customers, and establishing a higher level of name recognition.  Target markets can include the business-convention traveler, local professionals, and business people.&lt;ref name="VCGH 2009 10-K"/&gt; College students are also a secondary target market.&lt;ref name="VCGH 2009 10-K"/&gt; Advertising is essential for strip clubs, but local regulations and public reaction can make it challenging.  For this reason, clubs around the world advertise on the World Wide Web.  Advertising can include discount passes, virtual club tours, and dancer schedules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.strip-magazine.com/mmagazine/new_welcome.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1133443219&amp;archive=&amp;start_from=&amp;ucat=7&amp;category=7 |title=Strip scene gossip for December|publisher=Strip-magazine.com |accessdate=2010-08-13  |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20061118053547/http://www.strip-magazine.com/mmagazine/new_welcome.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1133443219&amp;archive=&amp;start_from=&amp;ucat=7&amp;category=7 |archive-date= 18 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. company VCGH, Inc. uses a variety of highly targeted methods to reach its customers, including local radio, billboard trucks, Internet, newspaper and magazine advertisements, and professional sporting events.  Its advertising and marketing expenses decreased by approximately 3.9% to US$2,805,260 from US$2,921,327 over the year ended December 31, 2008.  Advertising and marketing expenses were approximately 5.1% of their total revenues in 2009 and 2008.  The decrease was attributed to a shift in advertising, including using billboard trucks for mobile advertising versus leasing fixed billboard signs.&lt;ref name="VCGH 2009 10-K"/&gt; By contrast, in public filings with the U.S. [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC), Rick's Cabaret International reported an increase in its advertising budget from US$2,231,005 in 2008 to US$8,091,745 in 2009, growing from 3.9% to 10.8% of total annual revenue.&lt;ref name="RICK 2009 10-K"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/935419/000114036109029530/form10k.htm | title = Rick's Cabaret International, Inc. 2009 10-K | accessdate = 2010-06-16 | work = VCGH | date = 2009-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S. city of [[Seattle, Washington]], the city's [[Major League Baseball]] franchise, the [[Seattle Mariners]], initially sued in [[King County Superior Court]] to try to prevent Dreamgirls cabaret from opening.  The team's attorneys argued that the strip club's existence would adversely affect families that visit the stadium.  The suit was dropped after the Mariners reached a compromise which included limits on [[outdoor advertising]], window displays, and signs.  The compromise specified that the clubs video screens would only show text on kids days at the stadium, and not images of strippers.  In May 2010, there was public controversy because the club showed strippers on its large electronic display on "kids' day".  Dreamgirls claimed that it is the team's responsibility to tell them when such a display is prohibited.&lt;ref name="MyNorthwest 2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mynorthwest.com/?nid=11&amp;sid=313187 |title=Families outraged over strip club advertising on Kids Day |accessdate=2010-06-16 |work=MyNorthwest.com (Bonneville International) |date=2010-04-23 |last1=Shaprio |first1=Brian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100428223541/http://www.mynorthwest.com/?nid=11&amp;sid=313187 |archivedate=2010-04-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elite Cabaret, a [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]] city strip club, filed suit in 2007 against the City of Tempe in federal court.  In the settlement that was reached, the two sides ended the legal wrangle amidst a host of stipulations.  One clause is aimed at preventing the racy image promoted by strip clubs. The club is not allowed to depict the human body on the exterior of its building.  Signs cannot say "nude", "topless", "girls" or similar words.  The sign can only have the bar's name and terms like "cabaret" or "gentlemen's club".&lt;ref name="LawyersAndSettlements.com 2007"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.lawyersandsettlements.com/case/tempe-strip-club-ordinance.html | title = Settlements and Verdicts: Elite Cabaret | accessdate = 2010-06-16 | work = Online Legal Media | date = 2007-08-31 | last1 =  | first1 =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strip club advertising and its associated controversy are not limited to the United States.

{{Main|Legal status of striptease}}
The legal status of strip clubs has evolved over the course of time, with national and local laws becoming progressively more liberal on the issue around the world, although some countries (such as Iceland) have implemented strict limits and bans.&lt;ref name="IcelandBan 2010"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://icelandreview.com/icelandreview/daily_news/?cat_id=16567&amp;ew_0_a_id=359882 | title = Legislation Bans Stripping in Iceland | accessdate = 2010-06-06 | work = Iceland Review | date = 2010-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strip clubs are frequent targets of litigation around the world, and the sex industry, which includes strip clubs, is a hot button issue in popular culture and politics. Some clubs have been linked to [[organized crime]],&lt;ref name="TriBizJo 2007"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://triangle.bizjournals.com/triangle/stories/2007/12/17/story11.html | title = Strip club's ownership shift creates furor over payments | accessdate = 2010-05-07 | work = Triangle Business Journal | date = 2007-12-14 | first = Chris | last = Coletta}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has been known to use legitimate business as fronts for its illegal operations.

=== United States and the Americas ===
With the [[Law of the United States|legal system]] of the U.S. based on [[common law]], motivations for lawsuits can range from legitimate legal grounds to cases filed with the intent of shaping [[case law]] to favor the [[socio-political]] aims of [[Advocacy group|special interest groups]].  Clubs around the country have personnel and clientele that are purported to engage in not only sex acts on the premises,&lt;ref name="KFBB 2009"/&gt; but also drug use and other criminalized activities. Incidents of such activity vary widely. Their prevalence is dependent on regional differences in the attitudes of management, entertainers, customers, and law enforcement.&lt;ref name="BuffNews Whipple 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Barry Barry Michael Dank | author2 = Roberto Refinetti, PH.

Among its provisions is the "six-foot rule", copied by other municipalities in requiring that dancers maintain a six-foot distance from patrons while performing.  ''Fully nude'' clubs may be subject to additional requirements, such as restrictions on alcohol sales and ''no-touch rules'' between customers and dancers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/speech/adultent/topic.aspx?topic=nude_dancing Nude Dancing] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20041222014629/http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/speech/adultent/topic.aspx?topic=nude_dancing |date=2004-12-22 }} (from the [[First Amendment Center]] website)&lt;/ref&gt; To circumvent these rules, two "separate" bars{{snd}}one topless and one fully nude{{snd}}may open adjacent to one another.  In a small number of states and jurisdictions where it is legal for alcohol to be consumed but not sold, some clubs still allow customers to [[byob|bring their own beverages]].

Still other rules forbid "full nudity" in certain districts, which can vary among different areas within the same town. Some parts of the U.S. have laws forbidding the exposure of female [[nipple]]s or even [[areola]]s, thus requiring female dancers to cover these with [[pasties]].  These laws are not, however, known to be applied to the exposure of male nipples. Managers, dancers, and other club workers can be cited or arrested by local or federal authorities for violating nudity, drug, and other violations.&lt;ref name="BuffNews Whipple 2010"/&gt; In February 2010, the U.S. city of [[Detroit, Michigan]] banned fully exposed breasts in its strip clubs, following the example of [[Houston, Texas]], which began enforcing a similar ordinance in 2008.&lt;ref name="VicTimes 2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/victoriatimescolonist/story.html?k=71554&amp;id=38135a7b-209a-41ef-a325-80435be65732 |title=Houston topless clubs lose case, may respond to Supreme Court with pasties |accessdate=2010-05-05 |work=Victoria Times |date=2008-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212210544/http://www.canada.com/victoriatimescolonist/story.html?k=71554&amp;id=38135a7b-209a-41ef-a325-80435be65732 |archivedate=2012-02-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Detroit city council has since softened the rules; eliminating the requirement for pasties but keeping other restrictions.&lt;ref name="ClickOnDet 2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clickondetroit.com/news/22628122/detail.html |title=Detroit Passes New Strip Club Rules |accessdate=2010-05-05 |work=ClickOn Detroit |date=2010-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609032414/http://www.clickondetroit.com/news/22628122/detail.html |archivedate=2011-06-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both municipalities were reputed to have suffered rampant occurrences of illicit activities, including [[prostitution]], all linked to striptease establishments within their cities' limits.&lt;ref name="SmokingGun 2008"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2008/0602081harris1.html | title = Another Houston Strip Club Raided | accessdate = 2010-05-05 | work = The Smoking Gun | date = 2008-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KissDetroit 2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kissdetroit.com/10251/detroitcitycounciltovoteonstripclubrestrictions/ |title=Detroit City Council To Vote on Strip Club Restrictions |accessdate=2010-05-05 |work=The Smoking Gun |date=2009-11-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Detroit has also drawn attention from the federal government for incidents of [[human trafficking]] in its strip clubs.&lt;ref name="VOA Trafficking 2010"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www1.voanews.com/policy/editorials/Working-To-End-Human-Trafficking-93446434.html?refresh=1 | title = Working To End Human Trafficking | accessdate = 2010-06-19 | work = Voice of America News | date = 2008-05-12 | last1 =  | first1 =}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the state of Missouri passed a law similar to that of Houston and Detroit, banning full nudity in strip clubs across the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.newspressnow.com/news/article_7da45fe6-62ac-5110-ad97-c65d11811d8a.html |title= Nixon Bans Full Nudity, Alcohol At Missouri Strip Clubs |date= Jun 26, 2010 |publisher= [[St. Joseph News-Press]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strip clubs have also received attention in the Americas outside the United States. There have been several attempts to amend the [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[Immigration and Refugee Protection Act]] (IRPA), passed in 2001. The 2009 version of the bill (Bill C-45: An Act to amend the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act) contained provisions intended to tighten the issuing of [[tourist visa|visa]]s to exotic dancers, to combat [[human trafficking]].&lt;ref name="Guardian Amend 2009"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Sites/LOP/LegislativeSummaries/Bills_ls.asp?lang=E&amp;ls=c45&amp;source=library_prb&amp;Parl=40&amp;Ses=2 | title = Bill C-45: An Act to amend the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act | accessdate = 2010-06-11 | work = The Guardian | date = 2009-08-25 | last1 = Harrold | first1 = Daphne Keevil}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2009, the city of Rio de Janeiro, while bidding for the 2014 World Cup, shut down one of its most notorious clubs, the Help discothèque. There were plans to bulldoze the club and "replace it with a music-themed museum" with US firm [[Diller Scofidio + Renfro]] as architects, backed by Rio's governor [[Sergio Cabral]] who was also backing the [[2016 Summer Olympics]] bid.&lt;ref name="Guardian RioClose 2009"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/aug/17/rio-help-nightclub-closure | title = Rio nightclub closure leaves prostitutes Helpless | accessdate = 2010-07-05 | work = Guardian.co.uk | date = 2009-08-17 | last1 = Phillips | first1 = Tom | location = London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2009, officials in Rio de Janeiro threatened to sue American comedian [[Robin Williams]] for disparaging comments made on a [[late-night talk show]]. One of his comments on its Olympics bid, "Rio sent 50 strippers and a pound of blow. It wasn't really fair, you know?" was replayed several times on news shows in Brazil and prompted a public response from its mayor. The Olympic Committee for Rio had its lawyers investigate whether there were grounds for a lawsuit, but no charges were filed.&lt;ref name="NBC RioSue 2009"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local-beat/Rio-Looks-to-Sue-Robin-Williams-for-Olympic-Comment-78246597.html#ixzz0sq8PJgKo | title = Rio Looks to Sue Robin Williams for Olympic Comment | accessdate = 2010-07-05 | work = The Guardian | date = 2009-12-01 | last1 = Greiner | first1 = Andrew}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
In 2009, the United Kingdom passed the [[Policing and Crime Act 2009|Policing and Crime Act]] following concerns about an increase in the number of strip clubs in the country. Any strip clubs where live entertainment takes place more than 11 times a year must apply for a [[License|licence]] from their [[local authorities]].&lt;ref name="Echo NewLaws 2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.echo-news.co.uk/news/8212913.Tough_new_rules_on_strip_club_openings/|title=Tough new rules on strip club openings|accessdate=2010-06-11|work=Echo| date=2008-06-11 |last1=Orbach |first1=Max}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such clubs are routinely opposed by those who feel that these 'lower the tone' of particular neighbourhoods.  The legislation caused a reduction in the number of relevant premises, from about 350 in the early 2000s to fewer than 200, across the [[UK]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sevlicensing.wordpress.com |title=SEV licensing|accessdate=18 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the East London Strippers Collective was formed to improve working conditions in strip clubs. Their concerns included poorly-maintained working environments, exploitative business practises including the levying of fees, commission and fines, and a lack of employment protection and job security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=We're a group of strippers working to improve our employment conditions - and we want your support, rather than your sympathy|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/were-a-group-of-strippers-working-to-improve-our-employment-conditions-and-we-want-your-support-a6695241.html|newspaper=The Independent|author1=Stacey Clare|author2=Billy Laser|date=15 October 2015|accessdate=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rest of Europe ===
The [[Ireland|Irish]] government had, at one time, special visa categories for 'entertainers,' which enabled the trafficking of women for strip clubs and prostitution.&lt;ref name="Jeffreys 2009"/&gt;

In 2001, the former immigration chief in [[Cyprus]] was found guilty of accepting bribes to issue work permits to foreign women (in this case from [[Ukraine]]), to work as strippers in clubs, with some forced into prostitution.&lt;ref name="Finckenauer 2008"&gt;{{cite book | title = The prediction and control of organized crime: the experience of post-Soviet Ukraine | url = https://books.google.com/?id=fcUH3dKPYUIC | year = 2008 | publisher = Transaction Publishers | isbn = 978-0-7658-0562-1 | last1 = Finckenauer | last2 = Schrock | first1 = James O. | first2 = Jennifer L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, and the Netherlands, studies have shown that Russian individuals and organized crime groups are importing women from Russia, Ukraine, the Baltic States, and Central Europe into the Russian sex industry to work in stripping, prostitution, peep and show club services, and massage and escort services, among others.&lt;ref name="Ebbe 2008"&gt;{{cite book | title = Global trafficking in women and children | url = https://books.google.com/?id=9jTt5yJ1Qz8C | year = 2008 | publisher = CRC Press | isbn = 978-1-4200-5943-4 | last1 = Ebbe | last2 = Das | first1 = Obi N.

In March 2010, [[Iceland]] outlawed [[strip club ban in Iceland|striptease]].&lt;ref name="IcelandBan 2010"/&gt; [[Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir]], Iceland's prime minister, said: "The Nordic countries are leading the way on women's equality, recognizing women as equal citizens rather than commodities for sale."&lt;ref name="Salon Iceland 2010"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.salon.com/life/broadsheet/2010/03/26/iceland_bans_stripping_strip_clubs | title = Iceland's stripping ban: Does the country's move to shut down strip clubs really make it the most "female-friendly on the planet"? | accessdate = 2010-05-07 | work = Salon.com | date = 2010-03-26 | last1 = Clark-Flory | first1 = Tracy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The politician behind the bill, [[Kolbrún Halldórsdóttir]], said: "It is not acceptable that women or people in general are a product to be sold."&lt;ref name="Salon Iceland 2010"/&gt;

=== Rest of the world ===
Outside the United States, views on strip clubs, and on sexuality in general, can be much more liberal.  American striptease, though present, can be treated much differently. Activities which are not legal in most parts of the United States or its territories may be permitted in other parts of the world.  Also, ties to [[criminal]] elements (as defined by [[international law]]) can be much more pronounced.

In Eastern Europe and Asia, common incidents of strip club crime involve customers being quoted a price upon entering a club, only to find out later that management expects a much higher payment before customers are permitted to leave.  Intimidation and possibly the threat of violence are used to compel customers to comply.&lt;ref name="AsiaOne Pay 2009"/&gt;

The Japanese government, similar to Canada and Ireland, had special visa categories for "entertainers".  These enabled the trafficking of women for strip clubs and prostitution.&lt;ref name="Jeffreys 2009"&gt;{{cite book | title = The industrial vagina: the political economy of the global sex trade | url = https://books.google.com/?id=qb4EMAEACAAJ | year = 2009 | publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis | isbn = 978-0-415-41233-9 | pages = 86–106 | last1 = Jeffreys | first1 = Sheila}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the [[NSW Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research]] in [[Sydney, Australia]] reported 1,600 people were charged with committing a range of 27 criminal offenses in the state's "[[places of worship]]".  Oddly, the figures showed only 282 people were charged with the same offenses in premises classified as [[adult entertainment]] establishments.  A breakdown of the statistical figures showed that 85 people were assaulted in places of worship, compared to 66 at adult entertainment locations.  Incidents of both sexual assault and harassing and threatening behavior were also greater at places of worship.  The report included [[church (building)|churches]], [[synagogues]], [[monasteries]], [[mosques]], [[convents]], [[cathedrals]] and [[chapels]] as places of worship.  Premises listed as adult entertainment sites included strip clubs, [[sex shop]]s, [[brothel]]s, [[massage parlor]]s, [[gay club]]s, [[casino|gaming houses]], and [[gambling]] clubs.  The bureau's interpretation was that people were just as likely to be assaulted or robbed in the sanctity of a church as they were in sex industry venues.&lt;ref name="Freethinker safer 2008"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://freethinker.co.uk/2010/04/12/australians-are-safer-in-strip-joints-gay-clubs-or-brothels-than-in-churches/ | title = Australians are safer in strip joints, gay clubs or brothels than in churches | accessdate = 2010-06-14 | work = The Freethinker | date = 2008-04-12 | last1 = Duke | first1 = Barry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural impact ==
[[File:Ground Zero Mosque Strip Club.jpg|thumb|The New York Dolls strip club played a prominent role in the [[Park51]] controversy.]]
The strip club as an outlet for salacious entertainment is a recurrent theme in [[popular culture]].&lt;ref name="Boles and Garbin 1974"/&gt; In the media, clubs are portrayed primarily as gathering places of [[vice]] and ill [[reputation|repute]].  Both clubs themselves and various features of the business are highlighted in these references.  Comedian [[Chris Rock]] also pokes fun at the champagne room in his spoken word track, "[[No Sex (In the Champagne Room)]]", on his 1999 album, ''[[Bigger &amp; Blacker]]''. [[Wyclef Jean]] later noted Rock's comment in his own reflection on strippers, "[[Perfect Gentleman (Wyclef Jean song)|Perfect Gentleman]]".  In 2016, rapper [[Shawty Lo]]'s funeral procession stopped at his favorite strip club, The Blue Flame Lounge in Atlanta, where patrons and mourners honored his casket with a moment of silence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Shawty Lo Final Resting Place Has Tons of T &amp; A | publisher = TMZ | date = October 1, 2016 | url = http://www.tmz.com/2016/10/01/shawty-lo-funeral-strip-club-memorial/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Maas | first = Jennifer | title = Shawty Lo's Funeral Ends With His Hearse Driving To His Fave Strip Club — Watch | publisher = Hollywoodlife | date = October 1, 2016 | url = http://hollywoodlife.com/2016/10/01/shawty-lo-funeral-strip-club-video-watch/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Film, television, and theater ===
The image of strippers as known today evolved through the late [[Striptease#1960s-1970s|1960s and 1970s]] in the U.S. and in international cultures which embraced American striptease.&lt;ref name="DiNardo Gilded 2007"/&gt; By the 1980s, the pole dancing and highly explicit imagery associated with today's performers was widely accepted and frequently portrayed in film, television, and theater.

==== 1980s–1990s ====
In addition to lesser-known videos such as ''[[A Night at the Revuebar]]'' (1983), the 1980s also featured mainstream films involving strippers and their work as part of the central narrative. These included ''[[Flashdance]]'' (1983), which told the story of blue-collar worker Alexandra (Alex) Owens ([[Jennifer Beals]]), who works as an exotic dancer in a [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] bar at night and at a steel mill as a welder during the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Stanley Green | title = Hollywood Musicals: Year by Year | url = https://books.google.com/?id=XD2xNKSN3E8C | accessdate = 2010-08-13 | date = 2000-01-01 | publisher = Hal Leonard Corp | isbn = 978-0-634-00765-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Blaze (1989 film)|Blaze]]'' (1989) features [[Lolita Davidovitch]] as notorious stripper [[Blaze Starr]]. Starr herself appears in the film in a cameo role. ''[[Exotica (film)|Exotica]]'' (1994), directed by [[Atom Egoyan]], is set in a Canadian lap-dance club, and portrays a man's ([[Bruce Greenwood]]) obsession with a [[student|schoolgirl]] stripper named Christina ([[Mia Kirshner]]). ''[[Showgirls]]'' (1995) was directed by [[Paul Verhoeven]] and starred [[Elizabeth Berkley]] and [[Gina Gershon]]. ''[[Striptease (film)|Striptease]]'' (1996), was an adaptation of the novel starring [[Demi Moore]]. ''[[The Players Club]]'' (1998) starred [[LisaRaye]] as a girl who becomes a stripper to earn enough money to enter college and study journalism.

In ''[[Jekyll &amp; Hyde (musical)|Jekyll and Hyde]]'' (1997), the character of Lucy Harris (originally portrayed by [[Linda Eder]]) works as a [[prostitute]] and stripper in a small London club called The Red Rat, where she meets a multi-dimension man named Doctor Henry Jekyll, who turns into his evil persona Mr. Edward Hyde. Lucy performs the song 'Bring on the Men' during a show at the Red Rat (which was later replaced with 'Good 'n' Evil' in the Broadway production, some claiming 'Bring on the Men' was too 'risqué'.).  In ''[[Neighbours]]'' (1985), the character of [[Daphne Clarke|Daphne]] is originally a stripper at Des's bucks party, and eventually goes on to marry him.  ''[[Married... with Children]]'' (1987–97) often featured [[Al Bundy]], [[Jefferson D'Arcy]], and the NO MA'AM crew spending a night at the Nudie Bar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Brenton J.

==== 2000s–present ====
By the 2000s, visits to strip clubs by characters in action movies were a common occurrence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Melvin Burke Donalson | title = Black Directors in Hollywood | url = https://books.google.com/?id=5YWgxVkJmT4C | accessdate = 2010-08-13 | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-0-292-70179-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Dancing at the Blue Iguana]]'' (2000) is a feature film starring [[Daryl Hannah]]. The female cast of the film researched the film by dancing at strip clubs and created their parts and their storylines to be as realistic as possible. ''[[The Raymond Revuebar the Art of Striptease]]'' (2002) is a documentary, directed by Simon Weitzman. ''[[Los Debutantes]]'' (2003) is a [[Chile]]an film set in a strip-club in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]]. ''[[Portraits of a Naked Lady Dancer]]'' (2004) is a documentary, directed by Deborah Rowe. In '' [[Closer (2004 film)|Closer]]'' (2004), [[Natalie Portman]] plays Alice, a young stripper just arrived in London from America. ''[[Crazy Horse Le Show]]'' (2004) features dance routines from the Crazy Horse, Paris. ''[[I Know Who Killed Me]]'' (2007) stars [[Lindsay Lohan]] as Dakota Moss, an alluring stripper involved in the machinations of a serial killer, and features a long striptease sequence at a strip club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Outlook Publishing | title = Outlook | url = https://books.google.com/?id=UjEEAAAAMBAJ | accessdate = 2010-08-13 | date = 2008-02-18 | publisher = Outlook Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, a DVD called "Crazy Horse Paris" featuring [[Dita Von Teese]] was released. ''[[Barely Phyllis]]'' is a play on [[Phyllis Dixey]] which was first staged at the [[Pomegranate Theatre]], [[Chesterfield]] in 2009. A strip club is prominently featured in the film "[[Megean and Andrew go to a Strip Club]]" (2011) in which the title characters go to a strip club. ''[[Strip Search (TV series)|Stripsearch]]'' (2001–), an ongoing [[Australia]]n [[reality television]] show which centers around the training of male strippers. In ''[[Degrassi: The Next Generation]]'' (2007), in the two-part season 6 finale, titled ''Don't You Want Me'', [[Alex Nunez]] resorts to stripping after her mother and herself do not have enough money to pay the rent on their apartment.

=== Notable locations ===
One of the most famous strip clubs in the U.S. is on [[New Jersey Route 17|Route 17]] in [[Lodi, New Jersey]].  It was featured on the television show ''[[The Sopranos]]''.  The club is actually a go-go bar, serving alcohol with dancers, and it does not offer [[nudity]].  It is called "Satin Dolls" in real life, but is known more universally around the world and in the show as "[[Bada Bing|The Bada Bing]]".&lt;ref name="CBSNews SatinDolls 2007"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/08/20/entertainment/main3184854.shtml | title = "Bada Bing" Auction Sales Go "Bada Boom": HBO Series Memorabilia To Be Auctioned Online | accessdate = 2010-07-06 | work = CBS Interactive Inc. | date = 2007-08-20 | last1 = Castellanos | first1 = Melissa}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gold Club was an [[Atlanta]] adult entertainment club receiving national attention for the indictment of several of its owners, managers, and employees.

=== Top clubs ===
Given the variety of club formats and laws governing the operation of strip clubs around the world, a definitive and objective list of top clubs is not practical.  The popularity of a given club is an indicator of its quality, as is the word of mouth among customers who have visited a cross section of clubs in different regions.  A 2013 article published by the [[AskMen.com]] portal posted a list of the top 10 strip clubs in the world.&lt;ref name="AskMen Top10Clubs 2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.askmen.com/top_10/travel/strip-clubs.html | website=www.uk.askmen.com|title=World's Best Strip Clubs|author=Salvatore Mann|accessdate=22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to their criteria, which included aesthetics, quality of girls, services, and such, the top clubs at the time were:

# Playhouse Gentleman's Club, [[Warsaw]]
# [[Night Flight (night club)|Night Flight]], [[Moscow]]
# Larry Flynt's [[Hustler Club]], [[New York City]]
# 4 Play Gentlemen's Club, [[Los Angeles]]
# [[Spearmint Rhino]], [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]
# [[Crazy Horse (cabaret)|Le Crazy Horse]], [[Paris]]
# Seventh Heaven, [[Tokyo]]
# Temptations, [[Bristol]]
# Wanda's, [[Montreal]]
# K5 Relax, [[Prague]]

U.S. style striptease remains a global phenomenon and culturally accepted form of entertainment, despite its scrutiny in legal circles and popular media.  Over half of clubs still open from the list are located outside the United States.  Popular internet sites for strip club enthusiasts also have Top Club lists calculated from input from their online visitors.  The Ultimate Strip Club List has a Top 100 Strip Clubs list, generated by analyzing the ratings for all of its clubs as entered by individual reviewers.&lt;ref name="TUSCL top100"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.tuscl.net/t.php | title = Top 100 Strip Clubs | accessdate = 2010-05-01 | work = The Ultimate Strip Club List (TUSCL) | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100502071020/http://www.tuscl.net/t.php | archivedate = 2010-05-02 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its list regularly includes strip clubs from outside the U.S. and the site details clubs from countries across six continents.

'''''The Darkened Room: Women, Power and Spiritualism in Late Victorian England''''' is a historical study into the role played by women in the [[Spiritualism|Spiritualist]] religious movement in England during the latter part of the 19th century. It was written by the British historian Alex Owen and first published in 1989 by [[Virago]], before being republished in 2004 by the [[University of Chicago Press]].

A work of [[feminist history]] which arose from Owen's PhD thesis undertaken at the [[University of Sussex]], ''The Darkened Room'' looks at the role of women in the Spiritualist movement of the period, counterbalancing what Owen perceived as a former focus on the role of men.

==Background==

===Owen and her research===
The basis to ''The Darkened Room'' came from Owen's PhD thesis, undertaken at the [[University of Sussex]]. Exploring "the idea of [[femininity]] as a social construct", she initially planned to focus her thesis on the manner in which Victorian medical science played in reinforcing "a feminine norm", but in doing so came upon the case of Louisa Lowe, a woman who appeared in front of the Parliamentary Select Committee in 1887, claiming that she had been wrongly incarcerated in a mental asylum by her husband because she was a Spiritualist. Fascinated by the relationship between this Spiritualist movement and women in Late Victorian England, she decided to refocus her doctorate on this topic instead.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Owe89|Owen 1989]]. pp. i&amp;ndash;ii.&lt;/ref&gt;

|quote     = "One of the underpinning themes of this book remains... that of femininity: the way in which spiritualist women were constructed as 'natural' mediums, the 'innate' femininity which allowed women to accede to positions of power but which then trapped them within a limiting self-definition, the transgressive femininity which emerged during some of the more extraordinary séances, and the hostility aroused by the spectacle of femininity gone awry."
|salign    = right
|source    = Alex Owen in her Introduction, 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Owe89|Owen 1989]]. p. ii.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
Highlighting that the majority of scholarly work on the subject of Spiritualism had focused on male members of the religion, she decided to take a feminist approach to the subject by focusing on the women. Deciding to explore "issues of power and subversion", she adopted the definition of "[[Power (philosophy)|power]]" provided by the famous French philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] (1926&amp;ndash;1984).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Owe89|Owen 1989]]. pp. ii&amp;ndash;iii.&lt;/ref&gt; Owen took as her primary source material the published tracts, personal accounts and newsletters of the Late Victorian Spiritualist movement, noting that W.H. Harrison's ''Spiritualist'' and James Burns' ''Human Nature'' and ''Medium Daybreak'' proved to be "the most useful, enlightening and engaging."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Owe89|Owen 1989]]. p. iv.&lt;/ref&gt; A non-Spiritualist, Owen admitted that she could not explain many of the accounts of spirits which appeared in the accounts of Spiritualist séances.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Owe89|Owen 1989]]. pp. vi&amp;ndash;vii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the completion of her thesis, Owen moved to the United States, taking up a Research Fellowship at the [[University of California, San Diego]] from 1983 until 1986 and then a position as a Research Associate and Visiting Lecturer in the Women's Program in Religion at the [[Harvard Divinity School]] from 1986 until 1987, funded by the [[Rockefeller Foundation]]. It was while working in these positions that she wrote up her thesis as ''The Darkened Room''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Owe89|Owen 1989]]. pp. acknowledgments.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Press reviews===
''The Darkened Room'' was reviewed by Dinah Birch for the ''[[London Review of Books]]''. Birch noted that by the 1980s, Spiritualism had been "bundled out of sight, like a batty old aunt at a family gathering", ignoring the importance that it had held in Victorian society. Describing Owen's work as "solid and compelling", she highlighted a number of its arguments.

'''''The Protest Psychosis: How Schizophrenia Became a Black Disease''''' is a 2010 book by the [[psychiatrist]] [[Jonathan Metzl]] (who also has a Ph.D. in [[American studies]]), and published by [[Beacon Press]],&lt;ref name="Metzl"&gt;{{cite book|last=Metzl|first=Jonathan|title=The Protest Psychosis: How Schizophrenia Became a Black Disease|year=2010|publisher=[[Beacon Press]]|isbn=0-8070-8592-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t1Bg9QEiCAMC&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt; covering the history of the 1960s [[Ionia State Hospital]]&amp;mdash;located in [[Ionia, Michigan]] and converted into the [[Ionia Correctional Facility]] in 1986.  The facility is claimed to have been one of America's largest and most notorious state [[psychiatric hospital]]s in the era before [[deinstitutionalization]].

Metzl focuses on exposing the trend of this hospital to diagnose [[African American]]s with [[schizophrenia]] because of their [[civil rights]] ideas. He suggests that in part the sudden influx of such diagnoses could be traced to a change in wording in the [[DSM-II]], which compared to the previous edition added "hostility" and "aggression" as signs of the disorder. Metzl writes that this change resulted in [[institutional racism|structural racism]].

The '''Trustor affair''' involved the takeover in the summer of 1997 of a Swedish investment company listed on the [[Stockholm Stock Exchange]]. It was initially believed that following the takeover 600 million [[Swedish krona|SEK]] had disappeared from the company's accounts.&lt;ref name=annual&gt;Trustor ABs annual report 1997 {{page needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, when all assets had been accounted for and the company had been liquidated, the shareholders had almost doubled the value of their shares as an indirect result of the [[takeover]]. It is one of the largest [[financial cases]] in [[Swedish people|Swedish]] history.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

== Course of events ==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2012}}
In 1997 several individuals including the British lord [[Jonathan Guinness]], [[Lord Moyne]], planned the take over of the Swedish investment company Trustor AB.&lt;ref name="Lindstedt, G. 2000"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lindstedt |first=Gunnar |title=Svindlande affärer: historien om Trustor |year=2000 |publisher=DN |location=Stockholm |language=Swedish |isbn=91-7588-359-7}}{{page needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Team Moyne had initially identified a couple of companies which matched the criteria making them suitable for takeover, of which Trustor was one. In January 1997 Jisander contacted [[Erik Penser|Erik Penser Fond Commission (EPFC)]]. Mattson and Jisander met with EPFC as representatives for Lord Moyne who was interested in buying a Swedish investment company. Jisander and Mattson presented both proof that they were indeed acting on behalf of Lord Moyne and the criteria for the target company and after a series of discussions Trustor was found to be the best alternative.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book |title=Trustor - händelser och slutsatser: rapport från en av Stockholms fondbörs tillkallad utredning |series=Stockholms fondbörs skriftserie, 99-0819901-3 ; 22 |year=1998 |publisher=Stockholms fondbörs |location=Stockholm |language=Swedish}}{{page needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lindstedt |first=Gunnar |title=Svindlande affärer: historien om Trustor |year=2000 |publisher=DN |location=Stockholm |language=Swedish |isbn=91-7588-359-7 |page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The A-stocks of Trustor were owned by [[Per-Olov Norberg]]. They constituted 17% of the share capital but ranked as 52% of the voting rights. Norberg also happened to be in a need to sell. Norberg wanted to buy these companies at book value.

Lord Moyne was approached by his old friend Peter Mattsson to be part of the Trustor purchase and to be the new Chairman after the takeover. Mattsson and Lord Moyne had already a company together, Mattsson Guinness Securities Ltd, and they had both been connected to the infamous financial “Effex scandal” in Norway in 1993-94.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lindstedt |first=Gunnar |title=Svindlande affärer: historien om Trustor |year=2000 |publisher=DN |location=Stockholm |language=Swedish |isbn=91-7588-359-7 |pages=105-106, 114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the spring of 1997 negotiations took place, resulting in a deal on May 20 where Lord Moyne would buy the company from Norberg for 241 million SEK. The contract contained two important clauses. First, the contract gave Norberg the right to buy Trustor's stocks in the most valuable company Kanthal, at book value. Second, the contract also gave Moyne a few days respite for the payment, which eliminated the need for a short-term loan.&lt;ref name="Lindstedt, G. 2000"/&gt; At about that time Lord Moyne asked Lindsay Smallbone if he would agree to be CEO after the takeover.

On the 10th of June [[Sandvik]] made an offer to buy [[Kanthal (alloy)|Kanthal]] for 827 million SEK, altering the deal with Norberg. A new deal was reached a few days later where Norberg was compensated for not being able to buy Kanthal. Trustor now had the funds needed in order to complete the plan. On the 13th of June an extra shareholders' meeting was held, where Lord Moyne was appointed president and Lindsay Smallbone CEO.&lt;ref name="Lindstedt, G. 2000"/&gt;

Team Moyne now only had a few days to sort out the payment to Norberg, so on the 18th of June Moyne, Smallbone, Jisander and Mattsson met with two bank officers at [[Barclays Bank]] in London. At the meeting accounts were set for Trustor as well as for Lord Moyne and Jisander and in the following days a total of 730 million SEK was transferred from Trustors account in Swedish [[Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken|SEB]] to Trustor's new account in England.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; 600 million SEK of the money in Trustors account was later transferred to Jisanders account in the same bank of which 585 million was then sent directly to Lord Moyne.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; On the 25th of June the 241 million which had been agreed upon was paid to Per-Olof Norberg. 

The 30th of June was the last day for the financial statement and mostly because of the payment to Norberg, Trustor now lacked almost 300 million SEK. Lord Moyne took a loan of 293 million SEK from [[Van Lanschot Bankiers]], based in Luxemburg, and the money was then transferred to Trustors account in the same bank. The following day the money was transferred back to Lord Moyne who then repaid the loan. 

On October 31 an article about Trustor, written by Gunnar Lindstedt, was published in ''[[Svenska Dagbladet]]''. In the article Lindstedt wrote about Lord Moyne, Mattson and Smallbone following a meeting with them in London. The same day a preliminary investigation started to look into the [[Takeover|acquisition]] and the group of people behind it. After a discussion with the company the Stockholm stock exchange stopped the trading in Trustor. [[Law enforcement in Sweden#National Economic Crimes Bureau|The Swedish Economic Crime Authority]] made an investigation into all transactions to see how much and where to the money had gone. They later concluded that 478 millions had disappeared from Trustor.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Smallbone arranged for the Luxembourg loan to be frozen and this together with the realisation of undervalued assets meant the value of company increased.

===Aftermath===
The legal aftermath had started and on December 23 [[Stockholm District Court]] decided that a compulsory [[liquidation]] should be carried through. Because of Smallbone and Moyne this was a long process since they wanted a share of the salvage value. However the stocks Moyne bought where distributed among the shareholders. Trustor's assets were sold and in the end of the year there was 1.5 billion SEK to be distributed among the minority shareholders. When trade in the stock was resumed the stock price rose to 58,50 from 34 SEK before the take over.&lt;ref&gt;Trustor Annual report 1997 and 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of the take over the under valuated assets were sold at market price and their real value recovered by Trustor AB.&lt;ref name="Lindstedt, G. 2000"/&gt;

[[Joachim Posener]] refused to return to Sweden to be questioned and was sought by interpol but was never apprehended. Lord Moyne was declared bankrupt and later prosecuted along with Jisander and Mattson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dn.se/ekonomi/kritik-mot-dom-i-trustorharvan-1.74057 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130418071809/http://www.dn.se/ekonomi/kritik-mot-dom-i-trustorharvan-1.74057 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-04-18 |newspaper=[[Dagens Nyheter]] |title=Kritik mot dom i Trustorhärvan |trans-title=Criticism against the verdict in the Trustor affair |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moyne was acquitted due to lack of evidence and after appeal so were also Jisander and Mattson. However Jisander was later prosecuted and convicted in 2009 for [[embezzlement]] related to Trustor. He is the only one to be convicted of a crime in connection with the Trustor Affair. There are no longer any open police investigations concerning the Trustor Affair as the statutes of limitations are in effect since June 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thelocal.se/22884/20091026/ |newspaper=[[The Local]] |title=Prison sentence for Trustor fraud upheld |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605113859/http://www.thelocal.se/22884/20091026/ |archivedate=June 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.realtid.se/ArticlePages/200910/26/20091026141501_Realtid313/20091026141501_Realtid313.dbp.asp |publisher=Realtid.se |title=Läs domen mot Thomas Jisander |trans-title=Read the verdict against Thomas Jisander |date=26 October 2009 |access-date=23 July 2015 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smallbone was never prosecuted but was sued in a civil lawsuit by Trustor but this was later abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;[High Court CH1988 T No 1492 Order 17 December 2001]&lt;/ref&gt; Separate lawsuits were issued against Jisander, Moyne and Posener.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://wwwc.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/9804/11/trustor4.html |newspaper=[[Aftonbladet]] |title=De är männen bakom skandalen i Trustor |trans-title=They are the men behind the Trustor scandal |date=11 April 1998 |access-date=23 July 2015 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trustor also started a court case in 1999 against Barclay's Bank for their part in the irregularities.&lt;ref&gt;Trustor Annual Report 1999 and Tustor AB v Barclays bank PLC &amp; Anor (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[Ukrainians]]''' ({{lang-uk|Українці}}, {{lang-ro|Ucraineni}}) are the third-largest [[Minorities of Romania|ethnic minority]] in [[Romania]].  According to the 2011 Romanian census they number 51,703 people, making up 0.3% of the total population.&lt;ref name="insse3"/&gt;  Ukrainians claim that the number is actually 250,000-300,000.&lt;ref name = "wilson"&gt;"The Ukrainians: Engaging the 'Eastern Diaspora'".

Wesview Press, pp. 103-132. {{ISBN|0-8133-3738-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ukrainians mainly live in northern Romania, in areas close to the Ukrainian border. Over 60% of all Romanian Ukrainians live in [[Maramureş County]] (31,234), where they make up 6.77% of the population. Sizable populations of Ukrainians are also found in [[Suceava County]] (5698 people), [[Timiş County]] (5953), [[Caraş-Severin County]] (2600), [[Satu Mare County]] (1397), [[Tulcea County]] (1317) and [[Arad County]] (1295). Ukrainians make up a majority in seven [[Communes of Romania|communes]] of Maramureş County ([[Bistra, Maramureș|Bistra]], [[Bocicoiu Mare]], [[Poienile de sub Munte]], [[Remeți]], [[Repedea]], [[Rona de Sus]] and [[Ruscova]]) and three in Suceava County ([[Bălcăuți, Suceava|Bălcăuţi]], [[Izvoarele Sucevei]] and [[Ulma, Suceava|Ulma]]), as well as in [[Știuca|Ştiuca, Timiş]] and [[Copăcele|Copăcele, Caraş-Severin]]. According to the 2002 census, 79% of Ukrainians were [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], organized into the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Vicariate Sighetu Marmației]]; 10% [[Pentecostal Union of Romania|Pentecostal]]; 2.8% [[Romanian Church United with Rome, Greek-Catholic|Greek-Catholic]], organized into the [[Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Vicariate Rădăuţi]]; 2.1% [[Romanian Union Conference of Seventh-day Adventists|Seventh-day Adventist]]; 1.2% [[Lipovan Orthodox Old-Rite Church|Lipovan Orthodox]] and 2.9% stated they belonged to "another religion".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.insse.ro/cms/files/RPL2002INS/vol1/tabele/t51a.pdf Populaţia după etnie şi religie, pe medii], at the 2002 Census official site; accessed January 4, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

A second group of Ukrainians in Romania live in the [[Dobruja]] region of the [[Danube Delta]].  These are descendents of [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]] who fled Russian rule in the 18th century.  In 1830 they numbered 1,095 families.&lt;ref name="uur.ro"&gt;[http://www.uur.ro/frames.htm Union of Ukrainians in Romania website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081230193516/http://www.uur.ro/frames.htm |date=2008-12-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years they were joined by other peasants fleeing serfdom in the Russian Empire.

Other Ukrainians came under the policy of Romanianization following the collapse of Austria-Hungary over the whole of [[Duchy of Bukovina|Bukovina]] and relinquishment of Russian Empire over [[Bessarabia Governorate|Bessarabia]] in 1918; the Romanianization policies brought the closure of the Ukrainian public schools (all such schools were closed until 1928) and the suppression of most of the Ukrainian (Ruthenian) cultural institutions. The very term "Ukrainians" was prohibited from the official usage and some Romanians of disputable Ukrainian ethnicity were rather called the "citizens of Romania who forgot their native language" and were forced to change their last names to Romanian-sounding ones.&lt;ref name=Derh&gt;Oleksandr Derhachov (editor), "Ukrainian Statehood in the Twentieth Century: Historical and Political Analysis", Chapter: "Ukraine in Romanian concepts of the foreign policy", 1996, Kiev {{ISBN|966-543-040-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among those who were Romanianized were descendants of Romanians who were assimilated to Ukrainian society in the past.

As an officially recognised ethnic minority, Ukrainians have [[Romanian ethnic minorities parties|one seat]] reserved in the Romanian [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Chamber of Deputies]]. [[Ştefan Tcaciuc]] held the seat from 1990 until his 2005 death, when he was replaced by [[Ştefan Buciuta]].

'''Walborg''' and '''Karin Jota''' ([[Floruit]] 1350), were two Swedish women who, according to [[legend]], were appointed officials of the court after the great [[Black Plague]]. If the legend is true, they had a unique position for their time.

The legend says that when the judge of the county of [[Värmland]] reassembled the court, after the great black plague had passed Sweden in 1350, they were two members short. Instead of the  stipulated twelve officials, they were only ten left. It was not possible to elect two new men to fill their places, because of the great death numbers of the plague. The judge therefore decided to call upon these two women, Karin Jota from Kallhyttan and Walborg from Nordmarkshyttan, to fill the places of the court to make the number complete. These were not only formal positions; the two women took an active part in the affairs of the court. According to the legend, the judge had great respect for their judgement and wisdom, he often asked for their opinion and advice, and often followed it.

'''Zuwara Berber''' language (also: ''Zuara'', ''Zwara'', ([[Berber languages|Berber]] name: '''Maziɣ''', ⵎⴰⵣⵉⵗ, Twillult, ⵝⵡⵉⵍⵍⵓⵍⵝ) is a [[Berber languages|Berber]] dialect, one of the Berber [[Zenati languages]]. It is spoken in [[Zuwara]] city, located on the coast of western [[Tripolitania]] in northwestern [[Libya]].  

Several works of [[Terence Mitchell]], notably ''Zuaran Berber (Libya): Grammar and texts'',&lt;ref&gt;Terence Frederick Mitchell, ''Zuaran Berber (Libya): Grammar and Texts'', Rüdiger Köppe: Köln 2009''&lt;/ref&gt; provide an overview of its grammar along with a set of texts, based mainly on the speech of his consultant Ramadan Azzabi.  Some articles on it were also published by [[Luigi Serra]].&lt;ref&gt;Serra, L., 'Testi berberi in dialetto di Zuara', Annali dell'Istituto Orientale di Napoli, NS, 14, 1964 : 715-726.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zuwara speakers call their language '''Mázigh'''.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 2009:181&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also used by speakers of the [[Nafusi language|Nafusi]] Berber variety.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 2009:186&lt;/ref&gt; Unusually for a Berber idiom, the masculine form is used to refer to the language.

''[[Ethnologue]]'' treats it as a dialect of Nafusi, though the two belong to different branches of Berber according to Kossmann (1999).&lt;ref&gt;Maarten Kossmann, ''Essai sur la phonologie du proto-berbère'', Rüdiger Köppe:Köln, pp. 28, 32&lt;/ref&gt;
