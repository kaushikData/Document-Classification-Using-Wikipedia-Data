* the largest positive integer that cannot be expressed as a sum of different [[triangular numbers]].
* the smallest odd [[repdigit]] that is not a prime number.
* the sum of the first four positive [[factorial]]s. 
* the sum of the sum of the divisors of the first 6 [[positive integers]].
* equal to the sum of the squares of the digits of its own square in bases 9, 16 and 31.

[[Image:Bijection.svg|thumb|200px|A bijective function, ''f'': ''X'' → ''Y'', where set X is {1, 2, 3, 4} and set Y is {A, B, C, D}. For example, ''f''(1) = D.]]
In [[mathematics]], a '''bijection''', '''bijective function''', or '''one-to-one correspondence''' is a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] between the elements of two [[set (mathematics)|sets]], where each element of one set is paired with exactly one element of the other set, and each element of the other set is paired with exactly one element of the first set. There are no unpaired elements. In mathematical terms, a bijective function ''f'': ''X'' → ''Y'' is a [[Injective function|one-to-one (injective)]] and [[Surjective function|onto (surjective)]] mapping of a set ''X'' to a set ''Y''.

A bijection from the set ''X'' to the set ''Y'' has an [[inverse function]] from ''Y'' to ''X''.  If ''X'' and ''Y'' are [[finite set]]s, then the existence of a bijection means they have the same number of elements. For [[infinite set]]s the picture is more complicated, leading to the concept of [[cardinal number]], a way to distinguish the various sizes of infinite sets.

A bijective function from a set to itself is also called a ''[[permutation]]''.

Bijective functions are essential to many areas of mathematics including the definitions of [[isomorphism]], [[homeomorphism]], [[diffeomorphism]], [[permutation group]], and [[projective map]].

==Definition==
{{details|topic=notation|Function (mathematics)#Notation}}
For a pairing between ''X'' and ''Y'' (where ''Y'' need not be different from ''X'') to be a bijection, four properties must hold:
# each element of ''X'' must be paired with at least one element of ''Y'',
# no element of ''X'' may be paired with more than one element of ''Y'',
# each element of ''Y'' must be paired with at least one element of ''X'', and
# no element of ''Y'' may be paired with more than one element of ''X''.

Satisfying properties (1) and (2) means that a bijection is a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] with [[Domain of a function|domain]] ''X''. It is more common to see properties (1) and (2) written as a single statement: Every element of ''X'' is paired with exactly one element of ''Y''. Functions which satisfy property (3) are said to be "[[onto]] ''Y'' " and are called [[Surjective function|surjections]] (or '''surjective functions'''). Functions which satisfy property (4) are said to be "[[one-to-one function]]s" and are called [[Injective function|injections]] (or '''injective functions''').&lt;ref&gt;There are names associated to properties (1) and (2) as well. A relation which satisfies property (1) is called a ''total relation'' and a relation satisfying (2) is a ''single valued relation''.&lt;/ref&gt; With this terminology, a bijection is a function which is both a surjection and an injection, or using other words, a bijection is a function which is both "one-to-one" and "onto".

Bijections are sometimes denoted by a two-headed rightwards arrow with tail ({{unichar|2916|RIGHTWARDS TWO-HEADED ARROW WITH TAIL|ulink=Unicode}}), as in ''f'' : ''X'' ⤖ ''Y''. This symbol is a combination of the two-headed rightwards arrow ({{unichar|21A0|RIGHTWARDS TWO HEADED ARROW|ulink=Unicode}}) sometimes used to denote surjections and the rightwards arrow with a barbed tail ({{unichar|21A3|RIGHTWARDS ARROW WITH TAIL|ulink=Unicode}}) sometimes used to denote injections.

==Examples==

=== Batting line-up of a baseball or cricket team===
Consider the [[Batting order (baseball)|batting line-up]] of a [[baseball]] or [[cricket]] team (or any list of all the players of any sports team where every player holds a specific spot in a line-up). The set ''X'' will be the players on the team (of size nine in the case of baseball) and the set ''Y'' will be the  positions in the batting order (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.) The "pairing" is given by which player is in what position in this order. Property (1) is satisfied since each player is somewhere in the list. Property (2) is satisfied since no player bats in two (or more) positions in the order. Property (3) says that for each position in the order, there is some player batting in that position and property (4) states that two or more players are never batting in the same position in the list.

=== Seats and students of a classroom===
In a classroom there are a certain number of seats. A bunch of students enter the room and the instructor asks them all to be seated. After a quick look around the room, the instructor declares that there is a bijection between the set of students and the set of seats, where each student is paired with the seat they are sitting in. What the instructor observed in order to reach this conclusion was that:
# Every student was in a seat (there was no one standing),
# No student was in more than one seat,
# Every seat had someone sitting there (there were no empty seats), and
# No seat had more than one student in it. 
The instructor was able to conclude that there were just as many seats as there were students, without having to count either set.

==More mathematical examples and some non-examples==
* For any set ''X'', the [[identity function]] '''1'''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;: ''X'' → ''X'', '''1'''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') = ''x'', is bijective.
* The function ''f'': '''R''' → '''R''', ''f''(''x'') = 2''x'' + 1 is bijective, since for each ''y'' there is a unique ''x'' = (''y'' − 1)/2 such that ''f''(''x'') = ''y''. In more generality, any [[linear function]] over the reals,  ''f'': '''R''' → '''R''', ''f''(''x'') = ''ax'' + ''b'' (where ''a'' is non-zero) is a bijection. Each real number ''y'' is obtained from (paired with) the real number ''x'' = (''y'' - ''b'')/''a''.
* The function ''f'': ''R'' → (-π/2, π/2), given by ''f''(''x'') = arctan(''x'') is bijective since each real number ''x'' is paired with exactly one angle ''y'' in the interval (-π/2,&amp;nbsp;π/2) so that tan(''y'') = ''x'' (that is, ''y'' = arctan(''x'')). If the [[codomain]]  (-π/2,&amp;nbsp;π/2) was made larger to include an integer multiple of π/2 then this function would no longer be onto (surjective) since there is no real number which could be paired with the multiple of π/2 by this arctan function. 
* The [[exponential function]], ''g'': '''R''' → '''R''', ''g''(''x'') = e&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;, is not bijective: for instance, there is no ''x'' in '''R''' such that ''g''(''x'') = −1, showing that ''g'' is not onto (surjective).  However, if the codomain is restricted to the positive real numbers &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \R^+ \;\equiv\; \left(0,\, +\infty\right)&lt;/math&gt;, then ''g'' becomes bijective; its inverse (see below) is the [[natural logarithm]] function ln.
* The function ''h'': '''R''' → '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, ''h''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is not bijective: for instance, ''h''(−1) = ''h''(1) = 1, showing that ''h''  is not one-to-one (injective).  However, if the [[domain of a function|domain]] is restricted to &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\R^+_0 \;\equiv\; \left[0,\, +\infty\right)&lt;/math&gt;, then ''h'' becomes bijective; its inverse is the positive square root function.

==Inverses==
A bijection ''f'' with domain ''X'' (indicated by ''f'': ''X → Y'' in [[Function (mathematics)#Notation|functional notation]]) also defines a [[converse relation]] starting in ''Y'' and going to ''X'' (by turning the arrows around). The process of "turning the arrows around" for an arbitrary function does not, ''in general'', yield a function, but properties (3) and (4) of a bijection say that this inverse relation is a function with domain ''Y''. Moreover, properties (1) and (2) then say that this inverse ''function'' is a surjection and an injection, that is, the [[inverse function]] exists and is also a bijection. Functions that have inverse functions are said to be [[Invertible function|invertible]]. A function is invertible if and only if it is a bijection.

Stated in concise mathematical notation, a function ''f'': ''X → Y'' is bijective if and only if it satisfies the condition
:for every ''y'' in ''Y'' there is a unique ''x'' in ''X'' with ''y'' = ''f''(''x'').

Continuing with the baseball batting line-up example, the function that is being defined takes as input the name of one of the players and outputs the position of that player in the batting order. Since this function is a bijection, it has an inverse function which takes as input a position in the batting order and outputs the player who will be batting in that position.

==Composition==
The [[composition (mathematics)|composition]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle g \,\circ\, f&lt;/math&gt; of two bijections ''f'': ''X → Y'' and ''g'': ''Y → Z'' is a bijection. The inverse of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle g \,\circ\, f&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle (g \,\circ\, f)^{-1} \;=\; (f^{-1}) \,\circ\, (g^{-1})&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Image:Bijective composition.svg|thumb|300px|A bijection composed of an injection (left) and a surjection (right).]]
Conversely, if the composition &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle g \,\circ\, f&lt;/math&gt; of two functions is bijective, we can only say that ''f'' is [[Injective function|injective]] and ''g'' is [[surjective function|surjective]].

==Bijections and cardinality==
If ''X'' and ''Y'' are [[finite set]]s, then there exists a bijection between the two sets ''X'' and ''Y'' [[iff|if and only if]] ''X'' and ''Y'' have the same number of elements. Indeed, in [[axiomatic set theory]], this is taken as the definition of "same number of elements" ([[equinumerosity]]), and generalising this definition to [[infinite set]]s leads to the concept of [[cardinal number]], a way to distinguish the various sizes of infinite sets.

== Properties ==
* A function ''f'': '''R''' → '''R''' is bijective if and only if its [[graph of a function|graph]] meets every horizontal and vertical line exactly once.
* If ''X'' is a set, then the bijective functions from ''X'' to itself, together with the operation of functional composition (∘), form a [[group (algebra)|group]], the [[symmetric group]] of ''X'', which is denoted variously by S(''X''), ''S&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;'', or ''X''! (''X'' [[factorial]]).
* Bijections preserve [[cardinalities]] of sets: for a subset ''A'' of the domain with cardinality |''A''| and subset ''B'' of the codomain with cardinality |''B''|, one has the following equalities:
*:|''f''(''A'')| = |''A''| and |''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''B'')| = |''B''|.
*If ''X'' and ''Y'' are [[finite set]]s with the same cardinality, and ''f'': ''X → Y'', then the following are equivalent:
*# ''f'' is a bijection.
*# ''f'' is a [[surjection]].
*# ''f'' is an [[injection (mathematics)|injection]].
*For a finite set ''S'', there is a bijection between the set of possible [[total ordering]]s of the elements and the set of bijections from ''S'' to ''S''.  That is to say, the number of [[permutation]]s of elements of ''S'' is the same as the number of total orderings of that set—namely, ''n''!.

==Bijections and category theory==
Bijections are precisely the [[isomorphism]]s in the [[category theory|category]] '''[[Category of sets|Set]]''' of [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] and set functions.  However, the bijections are not always the isomorphisms for more complex categories.  For example, in the category '''[[Category of groups|Grp]]''' of [[Group (mathematics)|groups]], the morphisms must be [[homomorphism]]s since they must preserve the group structure, so the isomorphisms are ''group isomorphisms'' which are bijective homomorphisms.

==Generalization to partial functions==
The notion of one-to-one correspondence generalizes to [[partial functions]], where they are called '''partial bijections''', although partial bijections are only required to be injective. The reason for this relaxation is that a (proper) partial function is already undefined for a portion of its domain; thus there is no compelling reason to constrain its inverse to be a [[total function]], i.e. defined everywhere on its domain. The set of all partial bijections on a given base set is called the [[symmetric inverse semigroup]].&lt;ref name="Hollings2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Hollings|title=Mathematics across the Iron Curtain: A History of the Algebraic Theory of Semigroups|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O9wJBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA251|date=16 July 2014|publisher=American Mathematical Society|isbn=978-1-4704-1493-1|page=251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way of defining the same notion is to say that a partial bijection from ''A'' to ''B'' is any relation 
''R'' (which turns out to be a partial function) with the property that ''R'' is the [[Graph of a function|graph of]] a bijection ''f'':''A′''→''B′'', where ''A′'' is a [[subset]] of ''A'' and ''B′'' is a subset of ''B''.&lt;ref name="Borceux1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Francis Borceux|title=Handbook of Categorical Algebra: Volume 2, Categories and Structures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5i2v9q0m5XAC&amp;pg=PA289|year=1994|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-44179-7|page=289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the partial bijection is on the same set, it is sometimes called a '''one-to-one partial [[transformation (function)|transformation]]'''.&lt;ref name="Grillet1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pierre A.

'''Computing with Memory''' refers to computing platforms where function response is stored in memory array, either one or two-dimensional, in the form of [[lookup table]]s (LUTs) and functions are evaluated by retrieving the values from the LUTs. These computing platforms can follow either a purely spatial computing model, as in [[field-programmable gate array]] (FPGA), or a temporal computing model, where a function is evaluated across multiple clock cycles. The latter approach aims at reducing the overhead of programmable interconnect in FPGA by folding interconnect resources inside a computing element. It uses dense two-dimensional memory arrays to store large multiple-input multiple-output LUTs. Computing with Memory differs from Computing in Memory or [[processor-in-memory]] (PIM) concepts, widely investigated in the context of integrating a processor and memory on the same chip to reduce memory latency and increase bandwidth. These architectures seek to reduce the distance the data travels between the processor and the memory. The [[Berkeley IRAM project]] is one notable contribution in the area of PIM architectures.

Computing with memory platforms are typically used to provide the benefit of hardware reconfigurability.  Reconfigurable computing platforms offer advantages in terms of reduced design cost, early time-to-market, rapid prototyping and easily customizable hardware systems. FPGAs present a popular reconfigurable computing platform for implementing digital circuits. They follow a purely spatial computing model. Since their inception in 1985, the basic structure of the FPGAs has continued to consist of two-dimensional array of Configurable Logic blocks (CLBs) and a programmable interconnect matrix.&lt;ref name="Ref 1"&gt;K.Compton and S. Hauck, "Computing: A Survey of systems and software", ''ACM Surveys'', Vol. 34, No. 2, June, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; FPGA performance and power dissipation is largely dominated by the elaborate programmable interconnect (PI) architecture.&lt;ref name="Ref 2"&gt;S. M. Trimberger, ''Field Programmable Gate Array Technology'', Norwell, MA: Kluwer, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref 3"&gt;A. Rahman, S. Das, A. P. Chandrakasan, R. Reif, "Wiring Requirement and Three-Dimensional Integration Technology for Field Programmable Gate Arrays", ''IEEE Trans. on Very Large Scale Integration Systems'', Vol. 11, No. 1, February, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; An effective way of reducing the impact of the PI architecture in FPGA is to place small LUTs in close proximity (referred as clusters) and to allow intra-cluster communication using local interconnects. Due to the benefits of a clustered FPGA architecture, major FPGA vendors have incorporated it in their commercial products.&lt;ref name="Ref 4"&gt;[http://www.xilinx.com Xilinx Corporation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref 5"&gt;[http://www.altera.com Altera Corporation]&lt;/ref&gt; Investigations have also been made to reduce the overhead due to PI in fine-grained FPGAs by mapping larger multi-input multi-output LUTs to embedded memory blocks. Although it follows a similar spatial computing model, part of the logic functions are implemented using embedded memory blocks while the remaining part is realized using smaller LUTs.&lt;ref name="Ref 6"&gt;J. Cong and S. Xu, "Technology Mapping for FPGAs with Embedded Memory Blocks", Symposium on Field Programmable Gate Array, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Such a heterogeneous mapping can improve the area and performance by reducing the contribution of programmable interconnects.

Contrary to the purely spatial computing model of FPGA, a reconfigurable computing platform that employs a temporal computing model (or a combination of both temporal and spatial) has also been investigated &lt;ref name="Ref 7"&gt;S. Paul and S. Bhunia, "Reconfigurable Computing Using Content Addressable Memory for Improved Performance and Resource Usage", Design Automation Conference, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref 8"&gt;S. Paul, S. Chatterjee, S. Mukhopadhyay and S. Bhunia, "Nanoscale Reconfigurable Computing Using Non-Volatile 2-D STTRAM Array", International Conference on Nanotechnology, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; in the context of improving performance and energy over conventional FPGA. These platforms, referred as Memory Based Computing (MBC), use dense two-dimensional memory array to store the LUTs. Such frameworks rely on breaking a complex function (''f'') into small sub-functions; representing the sub-functions as multi-input, multi-output LUTs in the memory array; and evaluating the function ''f'' over multiple cycles.  MBC can leverage on the high density, low power and high performance advantages of nanoscale memory.&lt;ref name="Ref 8"/&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[:Image:Memory Logic Block.png]]  shows the high-level block diagram of MBC. --&gt;
Each computing element incorporates a two-dimensional memory array for storing LUTs, a small controller for sequencing evaluation of sub-functions and a set of temporary registers to hold the intermediate outputs from individual partitions. A fast, local routing framework inside each computing block generates the address for LUT access. Multiple such computing elements can be spatially connected using FPGA-like programmable interconnect architecture to enable mapping of large functions. The local time-multiplexed execution inside the computing elements can drastically reduce the requirement of programmable interconnects leading to large improvement in energy-delay product and better scalability of performance across technology generations.  The memory array inside each computing element can be realized by [[content-addressable memory]] (CAM) to drastically reduce the memory requirement for certain applications.&lt;ref name="Ref 7"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3267">In [[linear algebra]], a '''defective matrix''' is a [[square matrix]] that does not have a complete [[basis function|basis]] of [[eigenvector]]s, and is therefore not [[diagonalizable matrix|diagonalizable]].  In particular, an ''n''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;''n'' matrix is defective if and only if it does not have ''n'' [[linearly independent]] eigenvectors.&lt;ref name=golub&gt;{{harvtxt|Golub|Van Loan|1996|p=316}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A complete basis is formed by augmenting the eigenvectors with [[generalized eigenvector]]s, which are necessary for solving defective systems of [[ordinary differential equation]]s and other problems.

A defective matrix always has fewer than ''n'' distinct [[eigenvalue]]s, since distinct eigenvalues always have linearly independent eigenvectors.  In particular, a defective matrix has one or more eigenvalues ''λ'' with [[algebraic multiplicity]] ''m'' &gt; 1 (that is, they are multiple roots of the [[characteristic polynomial]]), but fewer than ''m'' linearly independent eigenvectors associated with ''λ''. If the algebraic multiplicity of ''λ'' exceeds its [[geometric multiplicity]] (that is, the number of linearly independent eigenvectors associated with ''λ''), then ''λ'' is said to be a '''defective eigenvalue'''.&lt;ref name="golub"/&gt;  However, every eigenvalue with algebraic multiplicity ''m'' always has ''m'' linearly independent generalized eigenvectors.

A [[Hermitian matrix]] (or the special case of a real [[symmetric matrix]]) or a [[unitary matrix]] is never defective; more generally, a [[normal matrix]] (which includes Hermitian and unitary as special cases) is never defective.

== Jordan block ==
Any nontrivial [[Jordan matrix|Jordan block]] of size 2&amp;times;2 or larger (that is, not completely diagonal) is defective.  (A diagonal matrix is a special case of the Jordan normal form and is not defective.)  For example, the n &amp;times; n Jordan block,
:&lt;math&gt;J = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\lambda &amp; 1            &amp; \;     &amp; \;  \\
\;        &amp; \lambda    &amp; \ddots &amp; \;  \\
\;        &amp; \;           &amp; \ddots &amp; 1   \\
\;        &amp; \;           &amp; \;     &amp; \lambda       
\end{bmatrix},&lt;/math&gt;
has an [[eigenvalue]], &amp;lambda;, with algebraic multiplicity n, but only one distinct eigenvector,
:&lt;math&gt;v = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ \vdots \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;  

In fact, any defective matrix has a nontrivial [[Jordan normal form]], which is as close as one can come to [[Diagonalizable_matrix|diagonalization]] of such a matrix.

== Example ==

A simple example of a defective matrix is:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} 3&amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 3 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
which has a double [[eigenvalue]] of 3 but only one distinct eigenvector
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
(and constant multiples thereof).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3120">In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] area of [[braid theory]], the '''Dehornoy order''' is a left-invariant [[total order]] on the [[braid group]], found by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Patrick Dehornoy|first=Patrick|last=Dehornoy|year1=1994|year2=1995}}.

Dehornoy's original discovery of the order on the braid group used [[huge cardinal]]s, but there are now several more elementary constructions of it.

==Definition==

Suppose that ''&amp;sigma;''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''&amp;sigma;''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt; are the usual generators of the braid group ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; on ''n'' strings.  
The set ''P'' of  positive elements in the Dehornoy order is defined to be the elements that  can be written as  word in the elements ''&amp;sigma;''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''&amp;sigma;''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt; and their inverses, such that for some ''i'' the word contains σ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; but does not contain 
''&amp;sigma;''{{su|b=''j''|''p'' = &amp;minus;1}}&lt;sup&gt;±1&lt;/sup&gt; for ''j''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''i'' 
nor ''&amp;sigma;''{{su|b=''i''|''p'' = &amp;minus;1}}&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.

The set ''P'' has the properties ''PP''&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;''P'', and the braid group is a disjoint union of ''P'', 1, and ''P''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;. 
These properties imply that if we define ''a''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''b'' to mean ''a''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;''b''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''P'' then we get a left-invariant total order on the braid group.

==Properties==

The Dehornoy order is a well-ordering when restricted to the monoid generated by ''&amp;sigma;''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''&amp;sigma;''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt;.

'''Delegated Path Discovery''' ('''DPD''') is a method for querying a trusted server for information about a [[public key certificate]].

DPD allows [[Client (computing)|clients]] to obtain collated certificate information from a trusted DPD [[Server (computing)|server]]. This information may then be used by the client to validate the subject certificate.

The requirements for DPD are described in RFC 3379.

In mathematics, the '''Dudley triangle''' is a triangular array of integers that was defined by {{harvs|first=Underwood|last=Dudley|authorlink=Underwood Dudley|year=1987|txt}}. It consists of the numbers
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;2&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;\\
&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;2&amp;&amp;2&amp;&amp;&amp;\\
&amp;&amp;&amp;2&amp;&amp;1&amp;&amp;2&amp;&amp;\\
&amp;&amp;2&amp;&amp;0&amp;&amp;0&amp;&amp;2&amp;\\
&amp;2&amp;&amp;6&amp;&amp;5&amp;&amp;6&amp;&amp;2\\
&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;\vdots&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;\\
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt; {{OEIS|A036238}}.

Dudley exhibited several rows of this triangle, and challenged readers to find the next row; the challenge was met by J. G. Mauldon, who proposed two different solutions. In one of Mauldon's solutions, the number at the intersection of the ''m''th and ''n''th diagonals (counting the top of the triangle as having ''m'' = ''n'' = 1) is given by the formula{{sfnp|Pickover|2003}}

: &lt;math&gt; a(n,m) = m^2 + mn + n^2 - 1 \mod n+m+1 &lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19895">In [[measure theory]], an area of [[mathematics]], '''Egorov's theorem''' establishes a condition for the [[uniform convergence]] of a [[pointwise convergence|pointwise convergent]] [[sequence]] of [[measurable function]]s. It is also named '''Severini–Egoroff theorem''' or '''Severini–Egorov theorem''', after [[Carlo Severini]], an [[Italia]]n [[mathematician]], and [[Dmitri Egorov]], a [[Russia]]n [[physicist]] and [[geometer]], who published independent proofs respectively in 1910 and 1911.

Egorov's theorem can be used along with [[support (mathematics)|compactly supported]] [[continuous function]]s to prove [[Lusin's theorem]] for [[integrable function]]s.

==Historical note==
The first proof of the theorem was given by [[Carlo Severini]] in 1910:&lt;ref&gt;Published in {{Harv|Severini|1910}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to {{Harvtxt|Straneo|1952|p=101}}, Severini, while acknowledging his own priority in the publication of the result, was unwilling to disclose it publicly: it was [[Leonida Tonelli]] who, in the note {{Harv|Tonelli|1924}}, credited him the priority for the first time.&lt;/ref&gt; he used the result as a tool in his research on [[Series (mathematics)|series]] of [[orthogonal functions]]. His work remained apparently unnoticed outside [[Italy]], probably due to the fact that it is written in [[Italian language|Italian]], appeared in a scientific journal with limited diffusion and was considered only as a means to obtain other theorems. A year later [[Dmitri Egorov]] published his independently proved results,&lt;ref&gt;In the note {{Harv|Egoroff|1911}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the theorem became widely known under his name: however, it is not uncommon to find references to this theorem as the Severini–Egoroff theorem or Severini–Egorov Theorem. The first mathematicians to prove independently the theorem in the nowadays common abstract [[measure space]] setting were {{Harvs|txt|first=Frigyes|last=Riesz|author-link=Frigyes Riesz|year=1922|year2=1928}}, and in {{Harvs|txt|first=Wacław|last=Sierpiński|author-link=Wacław Sierpiński|year=1928}}:&lt;ref&gt;According to {{Harvtxt|Cafiero|1959|p=315}} and {{Harvtxt|Saks|1937|p=17}}.&lt;/ref&gt; an earlier generalization is due to [[Nikolai Luzin]], who succeeded in slightly relaxing the requirement of finiteness of measure of the [[Domain of a function|domain]] of convergence of the [[Pointwise convergence|pointwise converging functions]] in the ample paper {{Harv|Luzin|1916}}.&lt;ref&gt;According to {{Harvtxt|Saks|1937|p=19}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Further generalizations were given much later by [[Pavel Korovkin]], in the paper {{Harv|Korovkin|1947}}, and by [[Gabriel Mokobodzki]] in the paper {{Harv|Mokobodzki|1970}}.

==The formal statement of the theorem and its proof==
===Statement of the theorem===
Let (''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'') be a sequence of ''M''-valued measurable functions, where ''M'' is a separable metric space, on some [[measure space]] (''X'',Σ,μ), and suppose there is a [[measurable set|measurable subset]] ''A⊆X'', with finite μ-measure, such that (''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) [[limit of a sequence|converges]] μ-[[almost everywhere]] on ''A'' to a limit function ''f''. The following result holds: for every ε&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0, there exists a measurable [[subset]] ''B'' of ''A'' such that μ(''B'')&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;ε, and (''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'') [[uniform convergence|converges to ''f'' uniformly]] on the [[relative complement]] ''A''&amp;nbsp;\&amp;nbsp;''B''.

Here, μ(''B'') denotes the μ-measure of ''B''. In words, the theorem says that pointwise convergence almost everywhere on ''A'' implies the apparently much stronger uniform convergence everywhere except on some subset ''B'' of arbitrarily small measure. This type of convergence is also called ''almost uniform convergence''.

===Discussion of assumptions and a counterexample===
* The hypothesis μ(''A'') &lt; ∞ is necessary. To see this, it is simple to construct a counterexample when μ is the [[Lebesgue measure]]: consider the sequence of real-valued [[indicator function]]s

::&lt;math&gt;f_n(x) = 1_{[n,n+1]}(x),\qquad n\in\mathbb{N},\ x\in\mathbb{R},&lt;/math&gt;

:defined on the [[real line]]. This sequence converges pointwise to the zero function everywhere but does not converge uniformly on ℝ&amp;nbsp;\&amp;nbsp;''B''&amp;thinsp; for any set ''B'' of finite measure: a counterexample in the general [[Dimension|&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional]] [[real vector space]] ℝ''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' can be constructed as shown by {{Harvtxt|Cafiero|1959|p=302}}.
* The separability of the metric space is needed to make sure that for ''M''-valued, measurable functions ''f'' and ''g'', the distance ''d''(''f''(''x''),&amp;nbsp;''g''(''x'')) is again a measurable real-valued function of ''x''.

===Proof===
For natural numbers ''n'' and ''k'', define the set ''E&lt;sub&gt;n,k&lt;/sub&gt;'' by the [[union (set theory)|union]]

:&lt;math&gt; E_{n,k} = \bigcup_{m\ge n} \left\{ x\in A \,\Big|\, |f_m(x) - f(x)| \ge \frac1k \right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

These sets get smaller as ''n'' increases, meaning that ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1,''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is always a subset of ''E&lt;sub&gt;n,k&lt;/sub&gt;'', because the first union involves fewer sets. A point ''x'', for which the sequence (''f&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'')) converges to ''f''(''x''), cannot be in every ''E&lt;sub&gt;n,k&lt;/sub&gt;'' for a fixed ''k'', because ''f&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'') has to stay closer to ''f''(''x'') than 1/''k'' eventually. Hence by the assumption of μ-almost everywhere pointwise convergence on ''A'',

:&lt;math&gt;\mu\biggl(\bigcap_{n\in\mathbb{N}}E_{n,k}\biggr)=0&lt;/math&gt;

for every ''k''. Since ''A'' is of finite measure, we have continuity from above; hence there exists, for each ''k'', some natural number ''n&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' such that

:&lt;math&gt;\mu(E_{n_k,k}) &lt; \frac\varepsilon{2^k}.&lt;/math&gt;

For ''x'' in this set we consider the speed of approach into the 1/''k''-[[neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]] of ''f''(''x'') as too slow. Define

:&lt;math&gt; B = \bigcup_{k\in\mathbb{N}} E_{n_k,k}&lt;/math&gt;

as the set of all those points ''x'' in ''A'', for which the speed of approach into at least one of these 1/''k''-neighbourhoods of ''f''(''x'') is too slow. On the set difference ''A''&amp;nbsp;\&amp;nbsp;''B'' we therefore have uniform convergence.

Appealing to the [[sigma additivity]] of μ and using the [[geometric series]], we get
:&lt;math&gt;\mu(B)
\le\sum_{k\in\mathbb{N}}\mu(E_{n_k,k})
&lt;  \sum_{k\in\mathbb{N}}\frac\varepsilon{2^k}
=\varepsilon.&lt;/math&gt;

==Generalizations==
===Luzin's version===
[[Nikolai Luzin]]'s generalization of the Severini–Egorov theorem is presented here according to {{Harvtxt|Saks|1937|p=19}}.

====Statement====
Under the same hypothesis of the abstract Severini–Egorov theorem suppose that ''A'' is the [[union (set theory)|union]] of a [[sequence]] of [[measurable set]]s of finite μ-measure, and (''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'') is a given sequence of ''M''-valued measurable functions on some [[measure space]] (''X'',Σ,μ), such that (''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) [[limit of a sequence|converges]] μ-[[almost everywhere]] on ''A'' to a limit function ''f'', then ''A'' can be expressed as the union of a sequence of measurable sets ''H'', ''A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'',... such that μ(''H'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 and (''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'') converges to ''f'' uniformly on each set ''A&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''.

====Proof====
It is sufficient to consider the case in which the set ''A'' is itself of finite μ-measure: using this hypothesis and the standard Severini–Egorov theorem, it is possible to define by [[mathematical induction]] a sequence of sets {''A&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}&lt;sub&gt;k=1,2,...&lt;/sub&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt;\mu\left(A\setminus\bigcup_{k=1}^{N} A_k\right)\leq\frac{1}{N}&lt;/math&gt;
and such that (''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'') converges to ''f'' uniformly on each set ''A&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' for each ''k''. Choosing
:&lt;math&gt;H=A\setminus\bigcup_{k=1}^{\infty} A_k&lt;/math&gt;
then obviously μ(''H'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 and the theorem is proved.

===Korovkin's version===
The proof of the Korovkin version follows closely the version on {{Harvtxt|Kharazishvili|2000|pp=183–184}}, which however generalizes it to some extent by considering [[admissible functional]]s instead of [[Measure (mathematics)|non-negative measures]] and [[inequality (mathematics)|inequalities]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\leq&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\geq&lt;/math&gt; respectively in conditions 1 and 2.

====Statement====
Let (''M'',''d'') denote a [[separable space|separable]] [[metric space]] and (''X'',Σ) a [[measurable space]]: consider a [[measurable set]] ''A'' and a [[Set (mathematics)|class]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathfrak{A}&lt;/math&gt; containing ''A'' and its measurable [[subset]]s such that their [[countable]] in [[Union (set theory)|unions]] and [[Intersection (set theory)|intersections]] belong to the same class. Suppose there exists a [[Measure (mathematics)|non-negative measure]] μ such that μ(''A'') exists and
# μ(&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\cap&lt;/math&gt;''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')=&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\lim&lt;/math&gt;μ(''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'') if ''A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\supset&lt;/math&gt;''A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\supset&lt;/math&gt;... with ''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\in\mathfrak{A}&lt;/math&gt; for all ''n''
# μ(&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\cup&lt;/math&gt;''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')=&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\lim&lt;/math&gt;μ(''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'') if ''A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\subset&lt;/math&gt;''A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\subset&lt;/math&gt;... with &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\cup&lt;/math&gt;''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\in\mathfrak{A}&lt;/math&gt;.
If (''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is a sequence of M-valued measurable functions [[limit of a sequence|converging]] μ-[[almost everywhere]] on ''A''&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\in\mathfrak{A}&lt;/math&gt; to a limit function ''f'', then there exists a [[subset]] ''A′'' of ''A'' such that 0&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;μ(''A'')&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;μ(''A′'')&lt;ε and where the convergence is also uniform.

====Proof====
Consider the [[Indexed family|indexed family of sets]] whose [[index set]] is the set of [[natural number]]s ''m''&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\in\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, defined as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;A_{0,m}=\left\{x\in A|d(f_n(x),f(x)) \le 1\ \forall n\geq m\right\}&lt;/math&gt;
Obiviously
:&lt;math&gt;A_{0,1}\subseteq A_{0,2}\subseteq A_{0,3}\subseteq\dots&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;A=\bigcup_{m\in\mathbb{N}}A_{0,m}&lt;/math&gt;
therefore there is a [[natural number]] ''m&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' such that putting ''A&lt;sub&gt;0,m&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;''=''A&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' the following relation holds true:
:&lt;math&gt;0\leq\mu(A)-\mu(A_0)\leq\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;
Using ''A&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' it is possible to define the following indexed family
:&lt;math&gt;A_{1,m}=\left\{x\in A_0\left| d(f_m(x),f(x)) \le \frac12 \ \forall n\geq m\right.\right\}&lt;/math&gt;
satisfying the following two relationships, analogous to the previously found ones, i.e.
:&lt;math&gt;A_{1,1}\subseteq A_{1,2}\subseteq A_{1,3}\subseteq\dots&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;A_0=\bigcup_{m\in\mathbb{N}}A_{1,m}&lt;/math&gt;
This fact enable us to define the set ''A&lt;sub&gt;1,m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;''=''A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', where ''m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a surely existing natural number such that
:&lt;math&gt;0\leq\mu(A)-\mu(A_1)\leq\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;
By iterating the shown construction, another indexed family of set {''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''} is defined such that it has the following properties:
* &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle A_0\supseteq A_1\supseteq A_2\supseteq\dots&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle0\leq\mu(A)-\mu(A_m)\leq\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; for all ''m''&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\in\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;
* for each ''m''&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\in\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; there is a natural ''k&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' such that for all ''n''&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\geq&lt;/math&gt;''k&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' then &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle d(f_n(x),f(x)) \le 2^{-m}&lt;/math&gt; for all ''x''&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\in&lt;/math&gt;''A&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''
and finally putting
:&lt;math&gt;A^\prime=\bigcup_{n\in\mathbb{N}}A_n&lt;/math&gt;
the thesis is easily proved.

'''Evgenii Mikhailovich Landis''' ({{lang-ru|Евге́ний Миха́йлович Ла́ндис}}, ''Yevgeny Mikhaylovich Landis''; October 6, 1921 – December 12, 1997) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[mathematician]] who worked mainly on [[partial differential equation]]s.

==Life==
Landis was born in [[Kharkiv]], [[Ukrainian SSR]], Soviet Union.  He studied and worked at the [[Moscow State University]], where his advisor was [[Alexander Kronrod]], and later [[Ivan Petrovsky]]. In 1946, together with Kronrod, he rediscovered [[Sard's lemma]] unknown in Russia at the time.  

Later he worked on uniqueness theorems for elliptic and parabolic [[partial differential equation|differential equations]], [[Harnack's inequality|Harnack inequalities]], and [[Phragmén–Lindelöf principle|Phragmén–Lindelöf type theorems]].  With [[Georgy Adelson-Velsky]], he invented the [[AVL tree]] datastructure (where "AVL" stands for '''A'''delson-'''V'''elsky '''L'''andis).  

He died in [[Moscow]]. His students include [[Yulij Ilyashenko]].

'''''Fermat's Last Theorem''''' is a [[popular science]] book (1997) by [[Simon Singh]]. It tells the story of the search for a proof of [[Fermat's last theorem]], first conjectured by Pierre de Fermat in 1637, and explores how many mathematicians such as [[Évariste Galois]] had tried and failed to provide a proof for the theorem.&lt;ref name="mr"&gt;Review of ''Fermat's Enigma'' by Andrew Bremner (1998), {{MR|1491363}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/aug/02/fermats-last-theorem-simon-singh-review|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|title=Fermat's Last Theorem by Simon Singh – book review.

The '''Fields Medal''' is a prize awarded to two, three, or four [[mathematician]]s under 40 years of age at the [[International Congress of Mathematicians|International Congress]] of the [[International Mathematical Union]] (IMU), a meeting that takes place every four years.

The Fields Medal is regarded as one of the highest honors a mathematician can receive, and has been described as the mathematician's "[[List of prizes known as the Nobel of a field|Nobel Prize]]" &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ball|first=Philip|title=Iranian is first woman to nab highest prize in maths|url=https://www.nature.com/news/iranian-is-first-woman-to-nab-highest-prize-in-maths-1.15686|journal=Nature|language=en|doi=10.1038/nature.2014.15686}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Honours/FieldsMedal.html|title=Fields Medal|website=www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uchicago.edu/about/accolades/14/|title=Fields Medal|website=The University of Chicago|language=en|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;, although there are several key differences, including frequency of award, number of awards, and age limits. According to the annual Academic Excellence Survey by [[Academic Ranking of World Universities|ARWU]], the Fields Medal is consistently regarded as the top award in the field of mathematics worldwide,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.shanghairanking.com/subject-survey/awards.html|title=Top Award, ShanghaiRanking Academic Excellence Survey 2017 {{!}} Shanghai Ranking - 2017|website=Shanghairanking.com|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in another reputation survey conducted by IREG in 2013-14, the Fields Medal came closely after the [[Abel Prize]] as the second most prestigious international award in mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=IREG Observatory on Academic Ranking and Excellence|title=IREG List of International Academic Awards|publisher=IREG Observatory on Academic Ranking and Excellence|location=Brussels|url=http://ireg-observatory.org/en/pdfy/IREG-list-academic-awards-EN.pdf|accessdate=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zheng|first1=Juntao|last2=Liu|first2=Niancai|title=Mapping of important international academic awards|journal=Scientometrics|date=2015|volume=104|pages=763-791|doi=10.1007/s11192-015-1613-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prize comes with a monetary award which, since 2006, has been {{CA$|link=yes}}15,000.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|title= Maths genius turns down top prize |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/5274040.stm| publisher = BBC|date= 22 August 2006 | accessdate =22 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=185366 "Israeli wins 'Nobel' of Mathematics"], ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the award is in honour of [[Canadians|Canadian]] mathematician [[John Charles Fields]].&lt;ref name="Fields Institute About Us"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/aboutus/jcfields/fields_medal.html |title=About Us: The Fields Medal | publisher = The Fields Institute, [[University of Toronto]] |accessdate=21 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fields was instrumental in establishing the award, designing the medal itself, and funding the monetary component.&lt;ref name="Fields Institute About Us" /&gt;

The medal was first awarded in 1936 to Finnish mathematician [[Lars Ahlfors]] and American mathematician [[Jesse Douglas]], and it has been awarded every four years since 1950. Its purpose is to give recognition and support to younger mathematical researchers who have made major contributions. In 2014, the Iranian mathematician [[Maryam Mirzakhani]] became the first woman Fields Medalist.&lt;ref name="Farsnews"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13930523000321|title=President Rouhani Congratulates Iranian Woman for Winning Math Nobel Prize|date=14 August 2014|accessdate=14 August 2014|publisher=[[Fars News Agency]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mathunion.org/general/prizes/2014|publisher=International Mathematical Union|title=IMU Prizes 2014|accessdate=12 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/16/maryam-mirzakhani-iranian-newspapers-break-hijab-taboo-in-tributes#img-2|title=Maryam Mirzakhani: Iranian newspapers break hijab taboo in tributes|last=correspondent|first=Saeed Kamali Dehghan Iran|date=2017-07-16|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-07-18|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In all, sixty people have been awarded the Fields Medal.

The most recent group of Fields Medalists received their awards on 1 August 2018 at the opening ceremony of the IMU International Congress, held in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icm2018.org/portal/en/program-at-a-glance |title=Scientific Program: Program at a glance |website=ICM 2018 event website.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The medal belonging to one of the four joint winners, Caucher Birkar, was stolen shortly after the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/01/fields-medal-award-stolen-brazil-maths-prize|title=World's most prestigious maths medal is stolen minutes after professor wins it|last=Philips|first=Don|date=2018-08-01|work=The Guardian|access-date=2018-08-01|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ICM presented Birkar with a replacement medal a few days later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icm2018.org/wp/2018/08/04/im-more-famous-now-than-i-would-be-jokes-birkar/ ICM announcement], August 4, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conditions of the award==
The Fields Medal is often described as the "[[List of prizes known as the Nobel of a field|Nobel Prize of Mathematics]]" and for a long time has been regarded as the most prestigious award in the field of mathematics.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Unlike the [[Nobel Prize]], the Fields Medal is only awarded every four years.  The Fields Medal also has an age limit: a recipient must be under age 40 on 1 January of the year in which the medal is awarded. This is similar to restrictions applicable to the [[Clark Medal]] in economics. The under-40 rule is based on Fields' desire that "while it was in recognition of work already done, it was at the same time intended to be an encouragement for further achievement on the part of the recipients and a stimulus to renewed effort on the part of others."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McKinnon Riehm|Hoffman|2011|p=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, an individual can only be awarded one Fields Medal; laureates are ineligible to be awarded future medals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://darboux.mathunion.org/fileadmin/IMU/Prizes/Fields/Statutes%20Fields%20Medal.pdf |title=Rules for the Fields Medal |website=mathunion.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is in contrast with the Nobel Prize which can be, and has been awarded to an individual or an entity more than once, whether in the same category ([[John Bardeen]] and [[Frederick Sanger]]), or in different categories ([[Marie Curie]] and [[Linus Pauling]]).

The monetary award is much lower than the 8,000,000 [[Swedish kronor]] (roughly 1,400,000 Canadian dollars)&lt;ref&gt;On 1 April 2014 at 15:32 UTC, 8,000,000 Swedish kronor was worth $1,360,970 Canadian according to the OANDA currency converter.&lt;/ref&gt; given with each Nobel prize as of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/about/amounts/index.html

|publisher=Nobel Foundation
|accessdate=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other major awards in mathematics, such as the [[Abel Prize]] and the [[Chern Medal]], have larger monetary prizes compared to the Fields Medal.

In 1954, [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] became the youngest winner of the Fields Medal, at 27. He retains this distinction.

In 1966, [[Alexander Grothendieck]] boycotted the ICM, held in Moscow, to protest Soviet military actions taking place in Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jackson|first=Allyn|authorlink=|date=October 2004|title=As If Summoned from the Void: The Life of Alexandre Grothendieck|url=http://www.ams.org/notices/200410/fea-grothendieck-part2.pdf|format=PDF|journal=[[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]]|volume=51|issue=9|page=1198|doi=|accessdate=26 August 2006|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Léon Motchane]], founder and director of the [[Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques]], attended and accepted Grothendieck's Fields Medal on his behalf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ams.org/samplings/this-math-month/thismathmonth-aug|title=This Mathematical Month - August|publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811071525/http://www.ams.org/samplings/this-math-month/thismathmonth-aug|archive-date=2010-08-11|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, [[Sergei Novikov (mathematician)|Sergei Novikov]], because of restrictions placed on him by the Soviet government, was unable to travel to the congress in [[Nice]] to receive his medal.

In 1978, [[Grigory Margulis]], because of restrictions placed on him by the Soviet government, was unable to travel to the congress in [[Helsinki]] to receive his medal. The award was accepted on his behalf by [[Jacques Tits]], who said in his address: "I cannot but express my deep disappointment—no doubt shared by many people here—in the absence of Margulis from this ceremony. In view of the symbolic meaning of this city of Helsinki, I had indeed grounds to hope that I would have a chance at last to meet a mathematician whom I know only through his work and for whom I have the greatest respect and admiration."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Margulis.html Margulis biography], School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of St Andrews, Scotland. Retrieved 27 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, the congress was due to be held in [[Warsaw]]  but had to be rescheduled to the next year, because of [[Martial law in Poland|martial law]] introduced in Poland on 13 December 1981. The awards were announced at the ninth General Assembly of the IMU earlier in the year and awarded at the 1983 Warsaw congress.

In 1990, [[Edward Witten]] became the first  [[physicist]] to win the award.

In 1998, at the ICM, [[Andrew Wiles]] was presented by the chair of the Fields Medal Committee, [[Yuri I. Manin]], with the first-ever IMU silver plaque in recognition of his proof of [[Fermat's Last Theorem]]. [[Don Zagier]] referred to the plaque as a "quantized Fields Medal". Accounts of this award frequently make reference that at the time of the award Wiles was over the age limit for the Fields medal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wwwa.britannica.com/eb/article-9090319 Wiles, Andrew John] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827194548/http://wwwa.britannica.com/eb/article-9090319|date=27 August 2008}}, Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved 27 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Wiles was slightly over the age limit in 1994, he was thought to be a favorite to win the medal; however, a gap (later resolved by [[Richard Taylor (mathematician)|Taylor]] and Wiles) in the proof was found in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20010430062600/http://www.icm2002.org.cn/general/prize/medal/1998.htm Fields Medal Prize Winners (1998)], 2002 International Congress of Mathematicians.

Vol. 45, No. 10, p. 1359.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, [[Grigori Perelman]], who proved the [[Poincaré conjecture]], refused his Fields Medal&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; and did not attend the congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/060828fa_fact2|title=Manifold Destiny: A legendary problem and the battle over who solved it.|last=Nasar|first=Sylvia|date=21 August 2006|work=[[The New Yorker]]|accessdate=24 August 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060831020716/http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/060828fa_fact2|archivedate=31 August 2006|deadurl=bot: unknown|author2=Gruber, David|df=dmy}} (dead link).  dated 14 December 2006; accessed 14 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, [[Maryam Mirzakhani]] became the first woman as well as the first Iranian to win the Fields Medal, and [[Artur Avila]] became the first [[South American]] and [[Manjul Bhargava]] became the first person of [[Indian people|Indian]] origins to do so.

==Medal==
[[File:FieldsMedalBack.jpg|thumb|right|The reverse of the Fields Medal]]
The medal was designed by Canadian sculptor [[R. Tait McKenzie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/aboutus/jcfields/fields_medal.html |title=Fields Institute - The Fields Medal |publisher=Fields.utoronto.ca |date=9 August 1932 |accessdate=21 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* On the obverse is [[Archimedes]] and a quote attributed to him which reads in Latin: "Transire suum pectus mundoque potiri" ("Rise above oneself and grasp the world").  The date is written in Roman numerals and contains an error ("MCNXXXIII" rather than "MCMXXXIII").&lt;ref&gt;EBERHARD KNOBLOCH. Generality and Infinitely Small Quantities in Leibniz's Mathematics: The Case of his Arithmetical Quadrature of Conic Sections and Related Curves. In Infinitesimal Differences: Controversies between Leibniz and his Contemporaries. Edited by Ursula Goldenbaum and Douglas Jesseph. Walter de Gruyter, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In capital Greek letters the word ΑΡXIMHΔΟΥΣ, or "of Archimedes". 
* On the reverse is the inscription (in Latin):

: {{lang|la|CONGREGATI}}
: {{lang|la|EX TOTO ORBE}}
: {{lang|la|MATHEMATICI}}
: {{lang|la|OB SCRIPTA INSIGNIA}}
: {{lang|la|TRIBUERE}}

Translation: "Mathematicians gathered from the entire world have awarded [understood but not written: 'this prize'] for outstanding writings."

In the background, there is the representation of Archimedes' [[Archimedes#Biography|tomb]], with the carving illustrating his theorem [[On the Sphere and Cylinder]],  behind a branch. (This is the mathematical result of which Archimedes was reportedly most proud: Given a sphere and a circumscribed cylinder of the same height and diameter, the ratio between their volumes is equal to ⅔.)

The rim bears the name of the prizewinner.

== Female recipients ==
In terms of the most prestigious awards in [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] fields, only a small proportion have been awarded to women. The Fields Medal has been obtained only one time by a woman, [[Maryam Mirzakhani]], in 2014, out of a total of (currently) 60 medalists.&lt;ref&gt;IMU. 2014. ''The Work of Maryam Mirzakhani''.

His exhaustive work, ''From One to Zero: A Universal History of Numbers'' (1985, 1994) was translated into multiple languages, became an international bestseller, was included in ''[[American Scientist]]'''s list of "100 or so Books that shaped a Century of Science", referring to the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first= Philip |last=Morrison |authorlink=Philip Morrison|first2=Phylis |last2=Morrison |url=http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/100-or-so-books-that-shaped-a-century-of-science|title=100 or so Books that shaped a Century of Science |volume=87 |issue=6 |journal=American Scientist |date=November–December 1999 |publisher=Sigma Xi, The Scientific Research Society |accessdate=2010-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3348">The '''Gilbert–Johnson–Keerthi distance [[algorithm]]''' is a method of determining the minimum distance between two [[convex set]]s. Unlike many other distance algorithms, it does not require that the geometry data be stored in any specific format, but instead relies solely on a [[support function]] to iteratively generate closer [[simplex|simplices]] to the correct answer using the [[Minkowski sum]] (CSO) of two convex shapes.

"Enhanced GJK" algorithms use edge information to speed up the algorithm by following edges when looking for the next simplex.  This improves performance substantially for polytopes with large numbers of vertices.

GJK algorithms are often used incrementally in simulation systems and video games. In this mode, the final simplex from a previous solution is used as the initial guess in the next iteration, or "frame".  If the positions in the new frame are close to those in the old frame, the algorithm will converge in one or two iterations. This yields collision detection systems which operate in near-constant time.

The algorithm's stability, speed, and small storage footprint make it popular for realtime [[collision detection]], especially in [[physics engine]]s for [[video games]].

== Overview ==

GJK relies on two functions:

* &lt;math&gt;Support(shape, \vec{d})&lt;/math&gt;, which returns the point on &lt;math&gt;shape&lt;/math&gt; which has the highest dot product with &lt;math&gt;\vec{d}&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;NearestSimplex(s)&lt;/math&gt;, which takes a simplex &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; and returns the simplex on &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; closest to the origin, and a direction toward the origin normal to the new simplex. If &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; itself contains the origin, &lt;math&gt;NearestSimplex&lt;/math&gt; accepts &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; and the two shapes are determined to intersect.

The simplices handled by &lt;math&gt;NearestSimplex&lt;/math&gt; may each be any simplex sub-space of {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. For example in 3D, they may be a point, a line segment, a triangle, or a tetrahedron; each defined by 1, 2, 3, or 4 points respectively. 

=== Pseudocode ===

&lt;code&gt;
    function GJK_intersection(shape p, shape q, vector initial_axis):
        vector  A = Support(p, initial_axis) - Support(q, -initial_axis)
        simplex s = {A}
        vector  D = -A
        loop:
            A = Support(p, D) - Support(q, -D)
            if dot(A, D) &lt; 0:
               reject
            s = s ∪ A
            s, D, contains_origin = NearestSimplex(s)
            if contains_origin:
               accept
&lt;/code&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2808">The '''grand mean''' is the [[mean]] of the means of several subsamples, as long as the subsamples have the same number of data points.&lt;ref name="Everitt"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Everitt|first1=B. S.|title=The Cambridge Dictionary of Statistics|date=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511244735|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, consider several lots, each containing several items. The items from each lot are [[sampling (statistics)|sampled]] for a [[Measurement|measure]] of some variable and the means of the measurements from each lot are computed. The mean of the measures from each lot constitutes the subsample mean. The mean of these subsample means is then the grand mean.

== Example ==

Suppose there are three groups of numbers: group A has 2, 6, 7, 11, 4; group B has 4, 6, 8, 14,8; group C has 8, 7, 4, 1, 5.

The mean of group A = (2+6+7+11+4)/5 = 6,

The mean of group B = (4+6+8+14+8)/5 = 8,

The mean of group C = (8+7+4+1+5)/5 = 5,

Therefore, the grand mean of all numbers = (6+8+5)/3 = 6.333.

&lt;ref&gt;Everitt, B. S. (2006). The Cambridge Dictionary of Statistics (3 ed.). Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|9780511244735}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application ==
Suppose one wishes to determine which states in America have the tallest men. To do so, one measures the height of a suitably sized sample of men in each state. Next, one calculates the means of height for each state, and then the grand mean (the mean of the state means) as well as the corresponding [[standard deviation]] of the state means. Now, one has the necessary information for a preliminary determination of which states have abnormally tall or short men by comparing the means of each state to the grand mean ± some multiple of the standard deviation.

In [[ANOVA]], there is a similar usage of grand mean to calculate [[Total sum of squares|sum of squares]] (SSQ), a measurement of variation. The total variation is defined as the sum of squared differences between each score and the grand mean (designated as GM), given by the equation

:&lt;math&gt;SSQ_{total} = \sum (X-GM)^2&lt;/math&gt;

== Discussion ==

The term ''grand mean'' is used for two different concepts that should not be confused, namely, the overall mean&lt;ref name="Everitt"/&gt; and the mean of means. The overall mean (in a grouped data set) is equal to the [[Arithmetic mean|sample mean]], namely, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N x_{ig}&lt;/math&gt;. The mean of means is literally the mean of the ''G (g=1,...,G)'' group means &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\bar{x}_g&lt;/math&gt;, namely, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\frac{1}{G}\sum_{g=1}^G \bar{x}_g&lt;/math&gt;. If the sample sizes across the ''G'' groups are equal, then the two statistics coincide.

In [[combinatorics]], an area of [[mathematics]], '''graph enumeration''' describes a class of [[combinatorial enumeration]] problems in which one must count [[undirected graph|undirected]] or [[directed graph]]s of certain types, typically as a function of the number of vertices of the graph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The pioneers in this area of mathematics were [[George Pólya]],&lt;ref&gt;Kombinatorische Anzahlbestimmungen für Gruppen, Graphen und chemische Verbindungen. Acta Math. 68 (1937), 145-254&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthur Cayley]] &lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=CLY838A|name=Cayley, Arthur}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Howard Redfield]].&lt;ref&gt;The theory of group-reduced distributions. American J. Math. 49 (1927), 433-455.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Labeled vs unlabeled problems==
In some graphical enumeration problems, the vertices of the graph are considered to be ''labeled'' in such a way as to be distinguishable from each other, while in other problems any permutation of the vertices is considered to form the same graph, so the vertices are considered identical or ''unlabeled''. In general, labeled problems tend to be easier.&lt;ref&gt;Harary and Palmer, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; As with combinatorial enumeration more generally, the [[Pólya enumeration theorem]] is an important tool for reducing unlabeled problems to labeled ones: each unlabeled class is considered as a symmetry class of labeled objects.

==Exact enumeration formulas==
Some important results in this area include the following.
*The number of labeled ''n''-vertex simple undirected graphs is 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)/2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Harary and Palmer, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The number of labeled ''n''-vertex simple directed graphs is 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Harary and Palmer, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The number ''C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' of [[connected graph|connected]] labeled ''n''-vertex undirected graphs satisfies the [[recurrence relation]]&lt;ref&gt;Harary and Palmer, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;C_n=2^{n\choose 2} - \frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} k{n\choose k} 2^{n-k\choose 2} C_k.&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6665">In [[mathematics]], a '''graph product''' is a [[binary operation]] on [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]s.  Specifically, it is an operation that takes two graphs ''G''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''G''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and produces a graph ''H'' with the following properties:
* The [[vertex (graph theory)|vertex set]] of ''H'' is the [[Cartesian product]] ''V''(''G''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''V''(''G''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), where ''V''(''G''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and ''V''(''G''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) are the vertex sets of ''G''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''G''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively.
* Two vertices (''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''u''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) of ''H'' are connected by an [[edge (graph theory)|edge]] if and only if the vertices ''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''u''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; satisfy a condition that takes into account the edges of ''G''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''G''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The graph products differ in exactly which this condition is.
The terminology and notation for specific graph products in the literature varies quite a lot; even if the following may be considered standard, readers are advised to check what definition a particular author uses for a graph product, especially in older texts.

== Overview table ==
The following table shows the most common graph products, with &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; denoting &amp;ldquo;is connected by an edge to&amp;rdquo;, and &lt;math&gt;\not\sim&lt;/math&gt; denoting non-connection.  The operator symbols listed here are by no means standard, especially in older papers.

In general, a graph product is determined by any condition for (''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''u''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;&amp;sim;&amp;nbsp;(''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) that can be expressed in terms of the statements ''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;sim;&amp;nbsp;''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''u''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;sim;&amp;nbsp;''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''u''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Mnemonic==

Let &lt;math&gt;K_2&lt;/math&gt; be the complete graph on two vertices (i.e. a single edge).  The product graphs &lt;math&gt;K_2 \square K_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;K_2 \times K_2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;K_2 \boxtimes K_2&lt;/math&gt; look exactly like the graph representing the operator.  For example, &lt;math&gt;K_2 \square K_2&lt;/math&gt; is a four cycle (a square) and &lt;math&gt;K_2 \boxtimes K_2&lt;/math&gt; is the complete graph on four vertices.  The &lt;math&gt;G[H]&lt;/math&gt; notation for lexicographic product serves as a reminder that this product is not commutative.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1936">In [[artificial intelligence]] and [[operations research]], '''hierarchical constraint satisfaction (HCS)''' is a method of handling [[constraint satisfaction]] problems where the [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] have large domains by exploiting their internal structure.&lt;ref name="wiley"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mackworth|first=Alan K.|last2=Mulder|first2=Jan A.|last3=Havens|first3=William S.|date=1985-01-01|title=Hierarchical arc consistency: exploiting structured domains in constraint satisfaction problems|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-8640.1985.tb00064.x/abstract|journal=Computational Intelligence|language=en|volume=1|issue=1|pages=118–126|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8640.1985.tb00064.x|issn=1467-8640}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many real-world problems the domain elements cluster together into sets with common properties and relations. This structure can be represented as a hierarchy and is [[Partially ordered set|partially ordered]] on the subset of a relation. The expectation is that the domains are structured so that the elements of a set frequently share consistency properties permitting them to be retained or eliminated as a unit. Thus, if some elements of a set satisfy a [[constraint (mathematics)|constraint]], but not all, the subsets of the set are considered. In this way, if no elements of a set can satisfy the constraint the whole set can be discarded. Thus, structuring the domain helps in considering sets of elements all at a time and hence helps in pruning the search space more quickly.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1993-07-01|title=Hierarchical constraint logic programming|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/074310669390046J|journal=The Journal of Logic Programming|language=en|volume=16|issue=3-4|pages=277–318|doi=10.1016/0743-1066(93)90046-J|issn=0743-1066}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6984">In [[mathematics]], '''Hilbert's fourteenth problem''', that is, number 14 of [[Hilbert's problems]] proposed in 1900, asks whether certain [[Associative_algebra|algebra]]s are [[finitely generated algebra|finitely generated]]. 

The setting is as follows: Assume that ''k'' is a [[field (mathematics)|field]] and let ''K'' be a subfield of the field of [[rational function]]s in ''n'' variables, 

:''k''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ) over ''k''.

Consider now the [[Associative_algebra|''k''-algebra]] ''R'' defined as the intersection 

:&lt;math&gt; R:= K \cap k[x_1, \dots, x_n] \ .&lt;/math&gt;

Hilbert conjectured that all such algebras are finitely generated over ''k''.

After some results were obtained confirming Hilbert's conjecture in special cases and for certain classes of rings (in particular the conjecture was proved unconditionally for ''n'' = 1 and ''n'' = 2 by [[Zariski]] in 1954) then in 1959 [[Masayoshi Nagata]] found a counterexample to Hilbert's conjecture. The counterexample of Nagata is a suitably constructed ring of invariants for the action of a [[linear algebraic group]].

== History ==

The problem originally arose in algebraic [[invariant theory]]. Here the ring ''R'' is given as a (suitably defined) ring of polynomial invariants of a [[linear algebraic group]] over a field ''k'' acting algebraically on a [[polynomial ring]] ''k''[''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;] (or more generally, on a finitely generated algebra defined over a field). In this situation the field ''K'' is the field of ''rational'' functions (quotients of polynomials) in the variables ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; which are invariant under the given action of the algebraic group, the ring ''R'' is the ring of ''polynomials'' which are invariant under the action. A classical example in nineteenth century was the extensive study (in particular by [[Arthur Cayley|Cayley]], [[James Joseph Sylvester|Sylvester]], [[Alfred Clebsch|Clebsch]], [[Paul Gordan]] and also Hilbert) of invariants of [[binary quantic|binary form]]s in two variables with the natural action of the [[special linear group]] ''SL''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''k'') on it. Hilbert himself proved the finite generation of invariant rings in the case of the field of [[complex number]]s for some classical [[semi-simple]] [[Lie group]]s (in particular the [[general linear group]] over the complex numbers) and specific linear actions on polynomial rings, i.e. actions coming  from finite-dimensional representations of the Lie-group. This finiteness result was later extended by [[Hermann Weyl]] to the class of all semi-simple Lie-groups. A major ingredient in Hilbert's proof is the [[Hilbert basis theorem]] applied to the [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] inside the polynomial ring generated by the invariants.

== Zariski's formulation ==

[[Oscar Zariski|Zariski]]'s formulation of Hilbert's fourteenth problem asks whether, for a [[Quasiprojective variety|quasi-affine]] [[algebraic variety]] ''X'' over a field ''k'', possibly assuming ''X'' [[Normal scheme|normal]] or [[Smooth (algebraic variety)|smooth]], the ring of [[regular function]]s on ''X'' is finitely generated over ''k''.

Zariski's formulation was shown&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Winkelmann | first = Jörg | title = Invariant rings and quasiaffine quotients | journal = Math. Z. | volume = 244 | issue = 1 | pages = 163&amp;ndash;174 | year = 2003 | doi = 10.1007/s00209-002-0484-9 | postscript = .| arxiv = math/0007076 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to be equivalent to the original problem, for ''X'' normal.&lt;!-- more importantly he gave a positive answer in the 2-variables case, no? --&gt; (See also: [[Zariski's finiteness theorem]].)

Éfendiev F.F. (Fuad Efendi) provided symmetric algorithm generating basis of invariants of n-ary forms of degree r.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02102130 SpringerLink]'' {{Citation | last = Éfendiev | first = Fuad | title = Explicit construction of elements of the ring S(n, r) of invariants of n-ary forms of degree r | journal = Mathematical Notes | volume = 51 | issue = 2 | pages = 204&amp;ndash;207 | year = 1992 | doi = 10.1007/BF02102130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nagata's counterexample==

{{harvtxt|Nagata|1958}} gave the following counterexample to Hilbert's problem. The field ''k'' is a field containing 48 elements ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ...,''a''&lt;sub&gt;16''i''&lt;/sub&gt;,  for ''i''=1, 2, 3 that are algebraically independent over the prime field. The ring ''R'' is the polynomial ring ''k''[''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;, ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''t''&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;] in 32 variables. The vector space ''V'' is a 13-dimensional vector space over ''k'' consisting of all vectors (''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''b''&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;) in ''k''&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; orthogonal to each of the three vectors (''a''&lt;sub&gt;1''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ...,''a''&lt;sub&gt;16''i''&lt;/sub&gt;) for ''i''=1, 2, 3. The vector space ''V'' is a 13-dimensional commutative unipotent algebraic group under addition, and its elements act on ''R'' by fixing all elements ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; and taking ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; to ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; + ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;''t''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;.  Then the ring of elements of ''R'' invariant under the action of the group ''V'' is not a finitely generated ''k''-algebra.

Several authors have reduced the sizes of the group and the vector space in Nagata's example. For example, {{harvtxt|Totaro|2008}} showed that over any field there is an action of the sum ''G''{{su|p=3|b=a}} of three copies of the additive group on ''k''&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; whose [[ring of invariants]] is not finitely generated.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23273">In [[commutative algebra]], the '''[[David Hilbert|Hilbert]] function''', the '''Hilbert polynomial''', and the '''Hilbert series''' of a [[graded algebra|graded commutative algebra]] finitely generated over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] are three strongly related notions which measure the growth of the dimension of the homogeneous components of the algebra.

These notions have been extended to [[filtered algebra]]s, and graded or filtered [[modules]] over these algebras, as well as to [[coherent sheaves]] over [[projective scheme]]s.

The typical situations where these notions are used are the following:
* The quotient by a homogeneous [[Ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] of a  [[multivariate polynomial]] [[polynomial ring|ring]], graded by the total degree.
* The quotient by an [[Ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] of a  [[multivariate polynomial]] [[polynomial ring|ring]], filtered by the total degree.
* The filtration of a [[local ring]] by the powers of its [[maximal ideal]]. In this case the Hilbert polynomial is called the [[Hilbert–Samuel function|Hilbert–Samuel polynomial]].

The Hilbert series of an algebra or a module is a special case of the [[Hilbert–Poincaré series]] of a [[graded vector space]].

Hilbert polynomial and Hilbert series are important in computational [[algebraic geometry]], as they are the easiest known way for computing the dimension and the degree of an algebraic variety defined by explicit polynomial equations.

== Definitions and main properties==

Let us consider a finitely generated [[graded algebra|graded commutative algebra]] {{math|''S''}} over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] {{math|''K''}}, which is finitely generated by elements of positive degree. This means that 
:&lt;math&gt;S = \bigoplus_{i \ge 0} S_i\ &lt;/math&gt;
and that &lt;math&gt;S_0=K&lt;/math&gt;.

The '''Hilbert function'''
:&lt;math&gt;HF_S\;:\;n\mapsto \dim_K\,S_n&lt;/math&gt;
maps the integer {{math|''n''}} onto the dimension of the {{math|''K''}}-vector space {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. The '''Hilbert series''', which is called [[Hilbert–Poincaré series]] in the more general setting of graded vector spaces, is the [[formal series]]
:&lt;math&gt;HS_S(t)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} HF_S(n)\,t^n.&lt;/math&gt;

If {{math|''S''}} is generated by {{math|''h''}} homogeneous elements of positive degrees &lt;math&gt;d_1, \ldots, d_h&lt;/math&gt;, then the sum of the Hilbert series is a rational fraction

:&lt;math&gt;HS_S(t)=\frac{Q(t)}{\prod_{i=1}^h (1-t^{d_i})}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''Q''}} is a polynomial with integer coefficients.

If {{math|''S''}} is generated by elements of degree 1 then the sum of the Hilbert series may be rewritten as

:&lt;math&gt;HS_S(t)=\frac{P(t)}{(1-t)^\delta}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''P''}} is a polynomial with integer coefficients, and &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Krull dimension]] of {{mvar|S}}.

In this case the series expansion of this rational fraction is

:&lt;math&gt;HS_S(t)=P(t)\,\left(1+\delta\,t+\cdots +\binom{n+\delta-1}{\delta-1}\,t^n+\cdots\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[binomial coefficient]]  &lt;math&gt;\binom{n+\delta-1}{\delta-1}&lt;/math&gt;  is &lt;math&gt;\;\frac{(n+\delta-1)(n+\delta-2)\cdots (n+1)}{(\delta-1)!}\;&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;n&gt;-\delta&lt;/math&gt; and 0 otherwise.

If &lt;math&gt;\textstyle P(t)=\sum_{i=0}^d a_it^i,&lt;/math&gt;
the coefficient of &lt;math&gt;t^n&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;HS_S(t)&lt;/math&gt; is thus
:&lt;math&gt;HF_S(n)= \sum_{i=0}^d a_i \binom{n -i+\delta-1}{\delta-1}\,.&lt;/math&gt;
For &lt;math&gt;n\ge i-\delta+1,&lt;/math&gt; the term of index {{mvar|i}} in this sum is a polynomial in {{mvar|n}} of degree &lt;math&gt;\delta-1&lt;/math&gt; with leading coefficient &lt;math&gt;a_i/(\delta-1)!.&lt;/math&gt;
This shows that there exists a unique polynomial &lt;math&gt;HP_S(n)&lt;/math&gt; with rational coefficients which is equal to &lt;math&gt;HF_S(n)&lt;/math&gt; for {{mvar|n}} large enough. This polynomial is the '''Hilbert polynomial''', and has the form
:&lt;math&gt;HP_S(n)= \frac{P(1)}{(\delta-1)!}\,n^{\delta-1} + {}\text{terms of lower degree in } n. &lt;/math&gt;

The least {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} such that &lt;math&gt;HP_S(n)=HF_S(n)&lt;/math&gt; for {{math|''n'' ≥ ''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is called the '''Hilbert regularity'''. It may be lower than &lt;math&gt;\deg P-\delta+1&lt;/math&gt;.

The Hilbert polynomial is a [[numerical polynomial]], since the dimensions are integers, but the polynomial almost never has integer coefficients {{harv|Schenck|2003|pp=41}}.

All these definitions may be extended to finitely  generated [[graded module]]s over {{math|''S''}}, with the only difference that a factor {{math|''t''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;}} appears in the Hilbert series, where {{math|''m''}} is the minimal degree of the generators of the module, which may be negative.

{{anchor|filtered}}The '''Hilbert function''', the '''Hilbert series''' and the '''Hilbert polynomial''' of a [[filtered algebra]] are those of the associated graded algebra.

The Hilbert polynomial of a [[projective variety]] {{math|''V''}} in {{math|'''P'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} is defined as the Hilbert polynomial of the [[homogeneous coordinate ring]] of {{math|''V''}}.

== Graded algebra and polynomial rings ==

Polynomial rings and their quotients by homogeneous ideals are typical graded algebras. Conversely, if {{math|''S''}} is a graded algebra generated over the field {{math|''K''}} by {{math|''n''}} homogeneous elements {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} of degree 1, then the map which sends {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} onto {{mvar|''g''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} defines an homomorphism of graded rings from &lt;math&gt;R_n=K[X_1,\ldots, X_n]&lt;/math&gt; onto {{math|''S''}}. Its [[Kernel (algebra)|kernel]] is a homogeneous ideal {{math|''I''}} and this defines an isomorphism of graded algebra between &lt;math&gt;R_n/I&lt;/math&gt; and {{math|''S''}}.

Thus, the graded algebras generated by elements of degree 1 are exactly, up to an isomorphism, the quotients of polynomial rings by homogeneous ideals. Therefore, the remainder of this article will be restricted to the quotients of polynomial rings by ideals.

== Properties of Hilbert series ==

=== Additivity ===
Hilbert series and Hilbert polynomial are additive relatively to [[exact sequence]]s. More precisely, if 
:&lt;math&gt;0 \;\rightarrow\; A\;\rightarrow\; B\;\rightarrow\; C \;\rightarrow\; 0&lt;/math&gt;
is an exact sequence of graded or filtered modules, then we have 
:&lt;math&gt;HS_B=HS_A+HS_C&lt;/math&gt; 
and 
:&lt;math&gt;HP_B=HP_A+HP_C.&lt;/math&gt;
This follows immediately from the same property for the dimension of vector spaces.

=== Quotient by a non-zero divisor ===

Let {{math|''A''}} be a graded algebra and {{math|''f''}} a homogeneous element of degree {{math|''d''}} in {{math|''A''}} which is not a [[zero divisor]]. Then we have 
:&lt;math&gt;HS_{A/(f)}(t)=(1-t^d)\,HS_A(t)\,.&lt;/math&gt;
It follows from the additivity on the exact sequence 
:&lt;math&gt;0 \;\rightarrow\; A^{[d]}\; \xrightarrow{f}\; A \;\rightarrow\; A/f\rightarrow\; 0\,,&lt;/math&gt;
where the arrow labeled {{math|''f''}} is the multiplication by {{math|''f''}}, and &lt;math&gt;A^{[d]}&lt;/math&gt; is the graded module which is obtained from {{math|''A''}} by shifting the degrees by {{math|''d''}}, in order that the multiplication by {{math|''f''}} has degree 0. This implies that &lt;math&gt;HS_{A^{[d]}}(t)=t^d\,HS_A(t)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Hilbert series and Hilbert polynomial of a polynomial ring ===

The Hilbert series of the polynomial ring &lt;math&gt;R_n=K[x_1, \ldots, x_n]&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; indeterminates is 
:&lt;math&gt;HS_{R_n}(t) = \frac{1}{(1-t)^{n}}\,.&lt;/math&gt;
It follows that the Hilbert polynomial is 
: &lt;math&gt; HP_{R_n}(k) = {{k+n-1}\choose{n-1}} = \frac{(k+1)\cdots(k+n-1)}{(n-1)!}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The proof that the Hilbert series has this simple form is obtained by applying recursively the previous formula for the quotient by a non zero divisor (here &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt;) and remarking that &lt;math&gt;HS_K(t)=1\,.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Shape of the Hilbert series and dimension ===

A graded algebra {{math|''A''}} generated by homogeneous elements of degree 1 has [[Krull dimension]] zero if the maximal homogeneous ideal, that is the ideal generated by the homogeneous elements of degree 1, is [[nilpotent ideal|nilpotent]]. This implies that the dimension of {{math|''A''}} as a {{math|''K''}}-vector space is finite and the Hilbert series of {{math|''A''}} is a polynomial {{math|''P''(''t'')}} such that {{math|''P''(1)}} is equal to the dimension of {{math|''A''}} as a {{math|''K''}}-vector space.

If the Krull dimension of {{math|''A''}} is positive, there is a homogeneous element {{math|''f''}} of degree one which is not a zero divisor (in fact almost all elements of degree one have this property). The Krull dimension of {{math|''A''/''(f)''}} is the Krull dimension of {{math|''A''}} minus one.

The additivity of Hilbert series shows that &lt;math&gt;HS_{A/(f)}(t)=(1-t)\,HS_A(t)&lt;/math&gt;. Iterating this a number of times equal to the Krull dimension of {{math|''A''}}, we get eventually an algebra of dimension 0 whose Hilbert series is a polynomial {{math|''P''(''t'')}}. This show that the Hilbert series of {{math|''A''}} is
:&lt;math&gt;HS_A(t)=\frac{P(t)}{(1-t)^d}&lt;/math&gt;
where the polynomial {{math|''P''(''t'')}} is such that {{math|''P''(1) ≠ 0}} and {{math|''d''}} is the Krull dimension of {{math|''A''}}.

This formula for the Hilbert series implies that the degree of the Hilbert polynomial is {{math|''d''}}, and that its leading coefficient is &lt;math&gt;\frac{P(1)}{d!}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Degree of a projective variety and Bézout's theorem ==

The Hilbert series allows us to compute the [[degree of an algebraic variety]] as the value at 1 of the numerator of the Hilbert series. This provides also a rather simple proof of [[Bézout's theorem]].

For showing the relationship between the degree of a [[projective algebraic set]] and the Hilbert series, let us consider an projective algebraic set {{mvar|''V''}}, defined as the set of the zeros of a [[homogeneous ideal]] &lt;math&gt;I\subset k[x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_n]&lt;/math&gt;, where {{mvar|''k''}} is a field, and let &lt;math&gt; R=k[x_0, \ldots, x_n]/I&lt;/math&gt; be the ring of the [[regular function]]s on the algebraic set.

In this section, one does not need irreducibility of algebraic sets nor primality of ideals. Also, as Hilbert series are not changed by extending the field of coefficients, the field {{mvar|k}} is supposed, without loss of generality, to be algebraically closed.

The dimension {{mvar|d}} of {{mvar|''V''}} is equal to the [[Krull dimension]] minus one of {{mvar|''R''}}, and the degree of {{mvar|''V''}} is the number of points of intersection, counted with multiplicities, of {{mvar|''V''}} with the intersection of &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; hyperplanes in [[general position]]. This implies the existence, in {{mvar|R}}, of a [[regular sequence]] &lt;math&gt;h_0, \ldots, h_{d}&lt;/math&gt; of {{mvar|''d'' + 1}} homogeneous polynomials of degree one. The definition of a regular sequence implies the existence of exact sequences
:&lt;math&gt;0 \;\rightarrow\; \left(R/\langle h_0,\ldots, h_{k-1}\rangle \right)^{[1]}\; \xrightarrow{h_k}\; R/\langle h_1,\ldots, h_{k-1}\rangle \;\rightarrow\; R/\langle h_1,\ldots, h_{k}\rangle\;\rightarrow\; 0,&lt;/math&gt;
for &lt;math&gt;k=0, \ldots, d.&lt;/math&gt; This implies that 
:&lt;math&gt;HS_{R/\langle h_0,\ldots, h_{d-1}\rangle}(t) = (1-t)^d\,HS_R(t)=\frac{P(t)}{1-t},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; P(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the numerator of the Hilbert series of {{mvar|R}}.

The ring &lt;math&gt;R_1=R/\langle h_0,\ldots, h_{d-1}\rangle&lt;/math&gt; has Krull dimension one, and is the ring of regular functions of a projective algebraic set &lt;math&gt;V_0&lt;/math&gt; of dimension 0 consisting of a finite number of points, which may be multiple points. As &lt;math&gt;h_d&lt;/math&gt; belongs to a regular sequence, none of these points belong to the hyperplane of equation &lt;math&gt;h_d=0.&lt;/math&gt; The complement of this hyperplane is an [[affine space]] that contains &lt;math&gt;V_0.&lt;/math&gt; This makes &lt;math&gt;V_0&lt;/math&gt; an [[affine algebraic set]], which has &lt;math&gt;R_0 = R_1/\langle h_d-1\rangle&lt;/math&gt; as its ring of regular functions. The linear polynomial &lt;math&gt;h_d-1&lt;/math&gt; is not a zero divisor in &lt;math&gt;R_1,&lt;/math&gt; and one has thus an exact sequence
:&lt;math&gt;0 \;\longrightarrow\; R_1\; \xrightarrow{h_d-1}\; R_1 \;\longrightarrow\; R_0\longrightarrow\; 0,&lt;/math&gt;
which implies that 
:&lt;math&gt;HS_{R_0}(t) = (1-t)HS_{R_1}(t) = P(t).&lt;/math&gt;
Here we are using [[#filtered|Hilbert series of filtered algebras]], and the fact that the Hilbert series of a graded algebra is also its Hilbert series as filtered algebra.

Thus &lt;math&gt;R_0&lt;/math&gt; is an [[Artinian ring]], which is a {{mvar|k}}-vector space of dimension {{math|''P''(1)}}, and [[Jordan–Hölder theorem]] may be used for proving that &lt;math&gt;P(1)&lt;/math&gt; is the degree of the algebraic set {{mvar|''V''}}. In fact, the multiplicity of a point is the number of occurrences of the corresponding maximal ideal in a [[composition series]].

For proving Bézout's theorem, one may proceed similarly. If {{mvar|''f''}} is a homogeneous polynomial of degree &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;, which is not a zero divisor in {{mvar|''R''}}, the exact sequence 
:&lt;math&gt;0 \;\rightarrow\; R^{[\delta]}\; \xrightarrow{f}\; R \;\rightarrow\; R/\langle f\rangle\;\rightarrow\; 0,&lt;/math&gt;
shows that
:&lt;math&gt;HS_{R/\langle f \rangle}(t)=(1-t^\delta)HS_R(t).&lt;/math&gt;
Looking on the numerators this proves the following generalization of Bézout's theorem:

''If'' {{mvar|''f''}} ''is a homogeneous polynomial of degree'' &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;, ''which is not a zero divisor in'' {{mvar|''R''}}, ''then the degree of the intersection of'' {{mvar|''V''}} ''with the hypersurface defined by'' {{mvar|''f''}} ''is the product of the degree of'' {{mvar|''V''}} ''by'' &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; ''.

In a more geometrical form, this may restated as ''If a projective hypersurface of degree {{math|d}} does not contain any [[irreducible component]] of an algebraic set of degree {{math|δ}}, then the degree of their intersection is {{math|dδ}}.

The usual Bézout's theorem is easily deduced by starting from a hypersurface, and intersecting it with {{math|''n''-1}} other hypersurfaces, one after the other.

==Complete intersection==
A projective algebraic set is a [[complete intersection]] is its defining ideal is generated by a [[regular sequence]]. In this case, there is a simple explicit formula for the Hilbert series.

Let &lt;math&gt;f_1, \ldots, f_k&lt;/math&gt; be {{math|''k''}} homogeneous polynomials in &lt;math&gt;R=K[x_1, \ldots, x_n]&lt;/math&gt;, of respective degrees &lt;math&gt;\delta_1, \ldots, \delta_k.&lt;/math&gt; Setting &lt;math&gt;R_i=R/\langle f_1, \ldots, f_i\rangle,&lt;/math&gt; one has the following exact sequences 
:&lt;math&gt;0 \;\rightarrow\; R_{i-1}^{[\delta_i]}\; \xrightarrow{f_i}\; R_{i-1} \;\rightarrow\; R_i\; \rightarrow\; 0\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The addivity of Hilbert series implies thus 
:&lt;math&gt;HS_{R_i}(t)=(1-t^{\delta_i})HS_{R_{i-1}}(t)\,.&lt;/math&gt;
A simple recursion gives 
:&lt;math&gt;HS_{R_k}(t)=\frac{(1-t^{\delta_1})\cdots (1-t^{\delta_k})}{(1-t)^n}= \frac{(1+t+\cdots+t^{\delta_1})\cdots (1+t+\cdots+t^{\delta_k})}{(1-t)^{n-k}}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

This shows that the complete intersection defined by a regular sequence of {{math|''k''}} polynomials has a codimension of {{math|''k''}}, and that its degree is the product of the degrees of the polynomials in the sequence.

== Relation with free resolutions ==
Every graded module {{math|''M''}} over a graded [[regular ring]] {{math|''R''}} has a graded [[free resolution]], meaning there exists an exact sequence
:&lt;math&gt; 0 \to L_k \to \cdots \to L_1 \to M \to 0,&lt;/math&gt;
where the &lt;math&gt;L_i&lt;/math&gt; are graded [[free module]]s, and the arrows are [[graded linear map]]s of degree zero.

The additivity of Hilbert series implies that
:&lt;math&gt;HS_M(t) =\sum_{i=1}^k (-1)^{i-1}HS_{L_i}(t).&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;R=k[x_1, \ldots, x_n]&lt;/math&gt; is a polynomial ring, and if one knows the degrees of the basis elements of the &lt;math&gt;L_i,&lt;/math&gt; then the formulas of the preceding sections allow deducing &lt;math&gt;HS_M(t)&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;HS_R(t) = 1/(1-t)^n.&lt;/math&gt; In fact, these formulas imply that, if a graded free module {{math|''L''}} has a basis of {{math|''h''}} homogeneous elements of degrees &lt;math&gt;\delta_1, \ldots, \delta_h,&lt;/math&gt; then its Hilbert series is 
:&lt;math&gt;HS_L(t) = \frac{t^{\delta_1}+\cdots +t^{\delta_h}}{(1-t)^n}.&lt;/math&gt;

These formulas may be viewed as a way for computing Hilbert series. This is rarely the case, as, with the known algorithms, the computation of the Hilbert series and the computation of a free resolution start from the same [[Gröbner basis]], from which the Hilbert series may be directly computed with a [[computational complexity]] which is not higher than that the complexity of the computation of the free resolution.
&lt;!--
Let's comment out this section and then add the hilbert polynomial computations using these free resolutions.

== Examples of Free Resolutions ==

=== Hyper Surface ===
Computing the free resolution of a projective degree &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; hypersurface is simple: if the ideal ideal of definition is given by &lt;math&gt;(f)&lt;/math&gt; then the free resolution of &lt;math&gt;R/I&lt;/math&gt; is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
 0 \to R(-d) \xrightarrow{\cdot f} R \to R/(f) \to 0
&lt;/math&gt;
Note that the first two terms form the koszul complex &lt;math&gt;K_R^\bullet(f)&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Complete Intersection ===
For a smooth projective complete intersection &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; of codimension &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; with ideal defined by &lt;math&gt;(f_1,\ldots,f_k)&lt;/math&gt;, a free resolution of &lt;math&gt;R/I&lt;/math&gt; is given by the Koszul complex
:&lt;math&gt;
K^\bullet(f_1,\ldots,f_k) = K^\bullet(f_1)\otimes \cdots \otimes K^\bullet(f_k)
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Union of Complete Intersections ===
Consider a homogeneous complete intersection ideal &lt;math&gt;(f_1,f_2)&lt;/math&gt; of degrees &lt;math&gt;d_1,d_2&lt;/math&gt; respectively and another homogeneous ideal &lt;math&gt;(g)&lt;/math&gt; of degree &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; has no common factors with either &lt;math&gt;f_1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;f_2&lt;/math&gt;. Then, the quotient ring of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; by the ideal &lt;math&gt;I = (g)(f_1,f_2)&lt;/math&gt; has a free resolution given by
:&lt;math&gt;
0 \to R(-d_1 - d_2 - e) \xrightarrow{
\begin{bmatrix}
f_2 \\
-f_1
\end{bmatrix}
}
R(-d_1 - e) \oplus R(-d_2 - e) \xrightarrow{
\begin{bmatrix}
f_1g &amp; f_2g
\end{bmatrix}
} R \to R/I \to 0
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Twisted Cubic ===
Recall that the twisted cubic &lt;math&gt;X \subset \mathbb{P}^3&lt;/math&gt; is defined by the ideal &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; generated by the three polynomials
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
y^2 - xz \\
yz - xw \\
z^2 - yx
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
There is a free resolution of the homogeneous ring &lt;math&gt;R/I&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;R = \mathbb{C}[x,y,z,w]&lt;/math&gt; given by
:&lt;math&gt;
0 \to R(-3)^{\oplus 2} \xrightarrow{\begin{bmatrix}
-z &amp; w \\
y &amp; -z \\
-x &amp; y
\end{bmatrix}} R(-2)^{\oplus 3} \xrightarrow{\begin{bmatrix}
y^2 - xz &amp;
yz - xw &amp;
z^2 - yx \end{bmatrix}} R \to R/I \to 0
&lt;/math&gt;
--&gt;

== Computation of Hilbert series and Hilbert polynomial ==

The Hilbert polynomial is easily deducible from the Hilbert series (see [[#Definitions and main properties|above]]). This section describes how the Hilbert series may be computed in the case of a quotient of a polynomial ring, filtered or graded by the total degree.

Thus let ''K'' a field, &lt;math&gt;R=K[x_1,\ldots,x_n]&lt;/math&gt; be a polynomial ring and ''I'' be an ideal in ''R''. Let ''H'' be the homogeneous ideal generated by the homogeneous parts of highest degree of the elements of ''I''. If ''I'' is homogeneous, then ''H''=''I''. Finally let ''B'' be a [[Gröbner basis]] of ''I'' for a [[monomial ordering]] refining the [[total degree]] partial ordering and ''G'' the (homogeneous) ideal generated by the leading monomials of the elements of ''B''.

The computation of the Hilbert series is based on the fact that ''the filtered algebra R/I and the graded algebras R/H and R/G have the same Hilbert series''.

Thus the computation of the Hilbert series is reduced, through the computation of a Gröbner basis, to the same problem for an ideal generated by monomials, which is usually  much easier than the computation of the Gröbner basis. The [[Computational complexity theory|computational complexity]] of the whole computation depends mainly on the regularity, which is the degree of the numerator of the Hilbert series. In fact the Gröbner basis may be computed by linear algebra over the polynomials of degree bounded by the regularity.

The computation of Hilbert series and Hilbert polynomials are available in most [[computer algebra system]]s. For example in both [[Maple (software)|Maple]] and [[Magma (software)|Magma]] these functions are named ''HilbertSeries'' and ''HilbertPolynomial''.

== Generalization to coherent sheaves ==
In [[algebraic geometry]], graded rings generated by elements of degree 1 produce [[projective scheme]]s by [[Proj construction]] while finitely generated graded modules correspond to coherent sheaves. If &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[coherent sheaf]] over a projective scheme ''X'', we define the '''Hilbert polynomial''' of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; as a function &lt;math&gt;p_{\mathcal{F}}(m) = \chi(X, \mathcal{F}(m))&lt;/math&gt;, where ''χ'' is the [[Euler characteristic]] of coherent sheaf, and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}(m)&lt;/math&gt; a [[Serre twist]]. Note that the Euler characteristic in this case is a well-defined number by [[Coherent sheaf cohomology#Finite-dimensionality of cohomology|Grothendieck's finiteness theorem]].

This function is indeed a polynomial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Ravi Vakil]]|title=Foundations of Algebraic Geometry|year=2015|url=http://math.stanford.edu/~vakil/216blog/FOAGdec2915public.pdf}}, Theorem 18.6.1&lt;/ref&gt; For large ''m'' it agrees with dim &lt;math&gt;H^0(X, \mathcal{F}(m))&lt;/math&gt; by [[Coherent sheaf cohomology#Vanishing theorems|Serre's vanishing theorem]]. If ''M'' is a finitely generated graded module and &lt;math&gt;\tilde{M}&lt;/math&gt; the associated coherent sheaf two definitions of Hilbert polynomial agree.

=== Graded free resolutions===
Since the category of coherent sheaves on a projective variety &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to the category of graded-modules modulo a finite number of graded-pieces, we can use the results in the previous section to construct Hilbert polynomials of coherent sheaves. For example, a complete intersection &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; of multi-degree &lt;math&gt;(d_1,d_2)&lt;/math&gt; has the resolution
:&lt;math&gt;
0 \to \mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^n}(-d_1-d_2) \xrightarrow{\begin{bmatrix} f_2 \\ -f_1 \end{bmatrix}} \mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^n}(-d_1)\oplus\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^n}(-d_2) \xrightarrow{\begin{bmatrix}f_1 &amp; f_2 \end{bmatrix}} \mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^n} \to \mathcal{O}_X \to 0
&lt;/math&gt;

It thus has the same [[homotopy group]]s and the same [[homology (mathematics)|homology]] groups as the ''n''-sphere, and so every homotopy sphere is necessarily a [[homology sphere]].

The topological [[generalized Poincaré conjecture]] is that any ''n''-dimensional homotopy sphere is [[homeomorphic]] to the ''n''-sphere; it was solved by [[Stephen Smale]] in dimensions five and higher, by [[Michael Freedman]] in dimension 4, and for dimension 3 (the original [[Poincaré conjecture]]) by [[Grigori Perelman]] in 2005.

The resolution of the smooth Poincaré conjecture in dimensions 5 and larger implies that homotopy spheres in those dimensions are precisely [[exotic sphere|exotic spheres]].  It is still an open question (as of 2014) whether or not there are non-trivial smooth homotopy spheres in dimension 4.

==Definition==

Let us consider a [[characteristic polynomial]] ''P'' in the variable ''&amp;lambda;'' of the form:

:&lt;math&gt;
P(\lambda)= a_0 \lambda^n + a_1 \lambda^{n-1} + \cdots + a_{n-1} \lambda + a_n
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;i=0,1,\ldots,n&lt;/math&gt;, are real.

The square [[Hurwitz matrix]] associated to ''P'' is given below:
:&lt;math&gt;
H=
\begin{pmatrix}
a_1 &amp; a_3 &amp; a_5 &amp; \dots &amp; \dots &amp; \dots &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4706">In mathematics, '''Legendre's formula''' gives an expression for the exponent of the largest power of a [[Prime number|prime]] ''p'' that divides the [[factorial]]&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;nowiki&gt;!&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  It is named after [[Adrien-Marie Legendre]].  It is also sometimes known as '''de Polignac's formula''', after  [[Alphonse de Polignac]].

== Statement ==
For any prime number ''p'' and any positive integer ''n'', let &lt;math&gt;\nu_p(n)&lt;/math&gt; be the exponent of the largest power of ''p'' that divides ''n'' (that is, the [[p-adic valuation | ''p''-adic valuation]] of ''n'').  Then
:&lt;math&gt;\nu_p(n!) = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^i} \right\rfloor,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\lfloor x \rfloor&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Floor and ceiling functions|floor function]].  While the formula on the right side is an infinite sum, for any particular values of ''n'' and ''p'' it has only finitely many nonzero terms: for every ''i'' large enough that &lt;math&gt;p^i &gt; n&lt;/math&gt;, one has &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^i} \right\rfloor = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Example ===
For ''n'' = 6, one has &lt;math&gt; 6! = 720 = 2^4 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5^1&lt;/math&gt;.  The exponents &lt;math&gt;\nu_2(6!) = 4, \nu_3(6!) = 2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nu_5(6!) = 1&lt;/math&gt; can be computed by Legendre's formula as follows:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\nu_2(6!) &amp; = \sum_{i=1}^\infty \left\lfloor \frac 6 {2^i} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac 6 2 \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac 6 4 \right\rfloor = 3 + 1, \\[3pt]
\nu_3(6!) &amp; = \sum_{i=1}^\infty \left\lfloor \frac 6 {3^i} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac 6 3 \right\rfloor = 2, \\[3pt]
\nu_5(6!) &amp; = \sum_{i=1}^\infty \left\lfloor \frac 6 {5^i} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac 6 5 \right\rfloor = 1.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Proof ===
Since &lt;math&gt;n!&lt;/math&gt; is the product of the integers 1 through ''n'', we obtain at least one factor of ''p'' in &lt;math&gt;n!&lt;/math&gt; for each multiple of ''p'' in &lt;math&gt;\{1, 2, \dots, n\}&lt;/math&gt;, of which there are &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p} \right\rfloor&lt;/math&gt;.  Each multiple of &lt;math&gt;p^2&lt;/math&gt; contributes an additional factor of ''p'', each multiple of &lt;math&gt;p^3&lt;/math&gt; contributes yet another factor of ''p'', etc.  Adding up the number of these factors gives the infinite sum for &lt;math&gt;\nu_p(n!)&lt;/math&gt;.

== Alternate form ==
One may also reformulate Legendre's formula in terms of the [[positional notation|base-''p'']] expansion of ''n''.  Let &lt;math&gt;s_p(n)&lt;/math&gt; denote the sum of the digits in the base-''p'' expansion of ''n''; then
:&lt;math&gt;\nu_p(n!) = \frac{n - s_p(n)}{p - 1}.&lt;/math&gt;

For example, writing ''n'' = 6 in [[Binary number|binary]] as 6&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; = 110&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, we have that &lt;math&gt;s_2(6) = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2&lt;/math&gt; and so 
:&lt;math&gt;\nu_2(6!) = \frac{6 - 2}{2 - 1} = 4.&lt;/math&gt;
Similarly, writing 6 in [[Ternary numeral system|ternary]] as 6&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; = 20&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, we have that &lt;math&gt;s_3(6) = 2 + 0 = 2&lt;/math&gt; and so 
:&lt;math&gt;\nu_3(6!) = \frac{6 - 2}{3 - 1} = 2.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Proof ===
Write &lt;math&gt;n = n_\ell p^\ell + \cdots + n_1 p + n_0&lt;/math&gt; in base ''p''.  Then &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^i} \right\rfloor = n_\ell p^{\ell-i} + \cdots + n_{i+1} p + n_i&lt;/math&gt;, and therefore
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\nu_p(n!)
&amp;= \sum_{i=1}^{\ell} \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^i} \right\rfloor \\
&amp;= \sum_{i=1}^{\ell} \left(n_\ell p^{\ell-i} + \cdots + n_{i+1} p + n_i\right) \\
&amp;= \sum_{i=1}^{\ell} \sum_{j=i}^{\ell} n_j p^{j-i} \\
&amp;= \sum_{j=1}^{\ell} \sum_{i=1}^{j} n_j p^{j-i} \\
&amp;= \sum_{j=1}^{\ell} n_j \cdot \frac{p^j - 1}{p - 1} \\
&amp;= \sum_{j=0}^{\ell} n_j \cdot \frac{p^j - 1}{p - 1} \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{p - 1} \sum_{j=0}^{\ell} \left(n_j p^j - n_j\right) \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{p - 1} \left(n - s_p(n)\right).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

== Applications ==
Legendre's formula can be used to prove [[Kummer's theorem]].  As one special case, it can be used to prove that if ''n'' is a positive integer then 4 divides &lt;math&gt;\binom{2n}{n}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if ''n'' is not a power of 2.

It follows from Legendre's formula that the [[p-adic exponential function|''p''-adic exponential function]] has radius of convergence &lt;math&gt;p^{-1/(p-1)}&lt;/math&gt;.

|Click "show" for description.|A [[truncated trihexagonal tiling|periodic tiling]] with a fundamental unit (triangle) and a primitive cell (hexagon) highlighted. A tiling of the entire plane can be generated by fitting copies of these triangular patches together. In order to do this, the basic triangle needs to be rotated 180 degrees in order to fit it edge-to-edge to a neighboring triangle. Thus a [[triangular tiling]] of fundamental units will be generated that is [[#MLD|mutually locally derivable]] from the tiling by the colored tiles. The other figure drawn onto the tiling, the white hexagon, represents a primitive cell of the tiling. Copies of the corresponding patch of coloured tiles can be [[Translation (geometry)|translated]] to form an infinite tiling of the plane. It is not necessary to rotate this patch in order to achieve this.}}|alt=]]

In [[geometry]], a [[Tessellation|tiling]] is a partition of the plane (or any other geometric setting) into closed sets (called ''tiles''), without gaps or overlaps (other than the boundaries of the tiles).&lt;ref name="Tilings by Regular Polygons"&gt;{{Citation|doi=10.2307/2689529|author1=Grünbaum, Branko |author2=Shephard, Geoffrey C. |title=Tilings by Regular Polygons|journal=Math. Mag.|volume=50|issue=5|year=1977|pages=227–247|jstor=2689529}}&lt;/ref&gt; A tiling is considered periodic if there exist translations in two independent directions which map the tiling onto itself. Such a tiling is composed of a single [[Fundamental domain|fundamental unit]] or [[primitive cell]] which repeats endlessly and regularly in two independent directions.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Edwards, Steve |url=http://ksuweb.kennesaw.edu/~sedwar77/tile/defs/fundamental.htm |title=Fundamental Regions and Primitive cells |website=Tiling Plane &amp; Fancy |publisher=Kennesaw State University |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5smoLyN1Y?url=http://www.spsu.edu/math/tile/defs/fundamental.htm |archive-date=2010-09-16 |access-date=2017-01-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of such a tiling is shown in the adjacent diagram (see the image description for more information). A tiling that cannot be constructed from a single primitive cell is called nonperiodic. If a given set of tiles allows only nonperiodic tilings, then this set of tiles is called [[aperiodic tiling|aperiodic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Wagon, Steve|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EbVrWLNiub4C&amp;pg=PA268&amp;dq=nonperiodic+tiling#v=onepage&amp;q=nonperiodic%20tiling&amp;f=false|title=Mathematica in Action|pages=268|edition=3rd|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|date=2010|isbn=9780387754772}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tilings obtained from an aperiodic set of tiles are often called [[aperiodic tiling]]s, though strictly speaking it is the tiles themselves that are aperiodic. (The tiling itself is said to be "nonperiodic".)

The first table explains the abbreviations used in the second table. The second table contains all known aperiodic sets of tiles and gives some additional basic information about each set. This list of tiles is still incomplete.

In [[logic]], a set of [[Symbol (logic)|symbols]] is commonly used to express logical representation. The following table lists many common symbols together with their name, pronunciation, and the related field of mathematics. Additionally, the third column contains an informal definition, the fourth column gives a short example, the fifth and sixth give the unicode location and name for use in HTML documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Named character references|url=http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/syntax.html#named-character-references|website=HTML 5.1 Nightly|publisher=W3C|accessdate=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last column provides the LaTeX symbol.

==Advanced and rarely used logical symbols==
&lt;!--sum1 plz make a table 4 this, and also some copy editing i am horrible at writing anything that does not look like P&amp;Q...--&gt;
These symbols are sorted by their Unicode value:

* {{unichar|00B7|MIDDLE DOT}}, an outdated way for denoting AND,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Logic: theoretical and applied|first=Baruch A.|last=Brody|publisher=Prentice-Hall|year=1973|isbn=9780135401460|page=93|quote=We turn now to the second of our connective symbols, the centered dot, which is called the conjunction sign.}}&lt;/ref&gt; still in use in electronics; for example "A · B" is the same as "A &amp; B"
*&lt;span style="text-decoration: overline"&gt;·&lt;/span&gt; : Center dot with a line above it; outdated way for denoting NAND, for example "A&lt;span style="text-decoration: overline"&gt;·&lt;/span&gt;B" is the same as "A NAND B" or "A | B" or "¬ (A &amp; B)". See also Unicode {{unichar|22C5|dot operator}}.
*{{unichar|0305|COMBINING OVERLINE|nlink=overline|cwith=&amp;nbsp;}}, used as abbreviation for standard numerals ([[Typographical Number Theory]]). For example, using HTML style "4&amp;#x0305;" is a shorthand for the standard numeral "SSSS0".
* Overline is also a rarely used format for denoting [[Gödel numbering|Gödel numbers]]: for example, "&lt;span style="text-decoration: overline"&gt;A V B&lt;/span&gt;" says the Gödel number of "(A V B)".
* Overline is also an outdated way for denoting negation, still in use in electronics: for example, "&lt;span style="text-decoration: overline"&gt;A V B&lt;/span&gt;" is the same as "¬(A V B)".
* {{unichar|2191|UPWARDS ARROW}} or {{unichar|007C|VERTICAL LINE}}: [[Sheffer stroke]], the sign for the NAND operator.
* {{unichar|2193|DOWNWARDS ARROW}} [[Peirce arrow|Peirce Arrow]], the sign for the NOR operator.
* {{unichar|2201|Complement|nlink=Complement (set theory)}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2909">In mathematics, a '''local language''' is a [[formal language]] for which membership of a word in the language can be determined by looking at a "window"{{Clarify|date=December 2016}} of length two.&lt;ref name=Sal97&gt;Salomaa (1981) p.97&lt;/ref&gt;  Equivalently, it is a language recognised by a [[local automaton]], a particular kind of [[deterministic finite automaton]].&lt;ref name=Law130&gt;Lawson (2004) p.130&lt;/ref&gt;

Formally, a language ''L'' over an alphabet ''A'' is defined to be ''local'' if there are subsets ''R'' and ''S'' of ''A'' and a subset ''F'' of ''A''×''A'' such that a word ''w'' is in ''L'' if and only if the first letter of ''w'' is in ''R'', the last letter of ''w'' is in ''S'' and no factor of length 2 in ''w'' is in ''F''.&lt;ref name=Law129&gt;Lawson (2004) p.129&lt;/ref&gt;  This corresponds to the [[regular expression]]&lt;ref name=Sal97/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sak228&gt;Sakarovitch (2009) p.228&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; (RA^* \cap A^*S) \setminus A^*FA^* \ . &lt;/math&gt;

More generally, a ''k''-''testable'' language ''L'' is one for which membership of a word ''w'' in ''L'' depends only on the prefix, suffix and the set of factors of ''w'' of length ''k''; a language is ''locally testable'' if it is ''k''-testable for some ''k''.&lt;ref&gt;McNaughton &amp; Papert (1971) p.14&lt;/ref&gt;  A local language is 2-testable.&lt;ref name=Sal97/&gt;

==Properties==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35096">{{Distinguish|longest common substring problem}}
The '''longest common subsequence''' ('''LCS''') '''problem'''  is the problem of finding the longest [[subsequence]] common to all sequences in a set of sequences (often just two sequences). It differs from the [[longest common substring problem]]: unlike substrings, subsequences are not required to occupy consecutive positions within the original sequences. The longest common subsequence problem is a classic [[computer science]] problem, the basis of [[data comparison]] programs such as the [[diff utility|&lt;tt&gt;diff&lt;/tt&gt; utility]], and has applications in [[computational linguistics]] and [[bioinformatics]]. It is also widely used by [[Revision control|revision control systems]] such as [[Git (software)|Git]] for [[Merge (revision control)|reconciling]] multiple changes made to a revision-controlled collection of files. 
&lt;!-- todo: add definition and example --&gt;

== Complexity ==
For the general case of an arbitrary number of input sequences, the problem is [[NP-hard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = David Maier| title = The Complexity of Some Problems on Subsequences and Supersequences| journal = J. ACM| volume = 25| year = 1978| pages = 322&amp;ndash;336| doi = 10.1145/322063.322075| publisher = ACM Press| issue = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the number of sequences is constant, the problem is solvable in polynomial time by [[dynamic programming]] (see ''Solution'' below). Assume you have &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; sequences of lengths &lt;math&gt;n_1, ..., n_N&lt;/math&gt;. A naive search would test each of the &lt;math&gt;2^{n_1}&lt;/math&gt; subsequences of the first sequence to determine whether they are also subsequences of the remaining sequences; each subsequence may be tested in time linear in the lengths of the remaining sequences, so the time for this algorithm would be
:&lt;math&gt;O\left( 2^{n_1} \sum_{i&gt;1} n_i\right).&lt;/math&gt;

For the case of two sequences of ''n'' and ''m'' elements, the running time of the dynamic programming approach is [[Big O notation|O]](''n'' × ''m'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wagner |first1=Robert |last2=Fischer |first2=Michael |date=January 1974 |title=The string-to-string correction problem |url=http://www.inrg.csie.ntu.edu.tw/algorithm2014/homework/Wagner-74.pdf |journal=[[Journal of the ACM]] |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=168-173 |doi=10.1145/321796.321811 |access-date=2018-05-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For an arbitrary number of input sequences, the dynamic programming approach gives a solution in

:&lt;math&gt;O\left(N \prod_{i=1}^{N} n_i\right).&lt;/math&gt;

There exist methods with lower complexity,&lt;ref name="BHR00"&gt;
{{cite journal | author = L. Bergroth and H. Hakonen and T. Raita | title = A Survey of Longest Common Subsequence Algorithms | journal = SPIRE | volume = 00 | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-7695-0746-8 | pages = 39&amp;ndash;48 | doi = 10.1109/SPIRE.2000.878178 | publisher = IEEE Computer Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;
which often depend on the length of the LCS, the size of the alphabet, or both.

Notice that the LCS is not necessarily unique; for example the LCS of "ABC" and "ACB" is both "AB" and "AC". Indeed, the LCS problem is often defined to be finding ''all'' common subsequences of a maximum length. This problem inherently has higher complexity, as the number of such subsequences is exponential in the worst case,&lt;ref name=""&gt;{{cite arXiv | author = Ronald I. Greenberg | title = Bounds on the Number of Longest Common Subsequences  | date = 2003-08-06  | eprint = cs.DM/0301030}}&lt;/ref&gt; even for only two input strings.

== Solution for two sequences ==
The LCS problem has an [[optimal substructure]]:  the problem can be broken down into smaller, simple "subproblems", which can be broken down into yet simpler subproblems, and so on, until, finally, the solution becomes trivial.  The LCS problem also has [[overlapping subproblems]]:  the solution to high-level subproblems often reuse lower level subproblems.  Problems with these two properties—optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems—can be approached by a problem-solving technique called [[dynamic programming]], in which subproblem solutions are memoized rather than computed over and over.  The procedure requires [[memoization]]—saving the solutions to one level of subproblem in a table (analogous to writing them to a ''memo'', hence the name) so that the solutions are available to the next level of subproblems.
This method is illustrated here.

=== Prefixes ===
The subproblems become simpler as the sequences become shorter.  Shorter sequences are conveniently described using the term ''prefix''.  A prefix of a sequence is the sequence with the end cut off.  Let ''S'' be the sequence (AGCA).  Then, the sequence (AG) is one of the prefixes of ''S''.  Prefixes are denoted with the name of the sequence, followed by a subscript to indicate how many characters the prefix contains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 | publisher = Springer
 | location = New York
 | page = 24
 | isbn = 0-387-71336-0
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The prefix (AG) is denoted ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, since it contains the first 2 elements of ''S''.  The possible prefixes of ''S'' are
:''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = (A)
:''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = (AG)
:''S''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = (AGC)
:''S''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = (AGCA).

The solution to the LCS problem for two arbitrary sequences, ''X'' and ''Y'', amounts to constructing some function, ''LCS''(''X'', ''Y''), that gives the longest subsequences common to ''X'' and ''Y''.  That function relies on the following two properties.

=== First property ===
Suppose that two sequences both end in the same element.  To find their LCS, shorten each sequence by removing the last element, find the LCS of the shortened sequences, and to that LCS append the removed element.
:For example, here are two sequences having the same last element:  (BANANA) and (ATANA).
:Remove the same last element. Repeat the procedure until you find no common last element. The removed sequence will be (ANA).
:The sequences now under consideration:  (BAN) and (AT)
:The LCS of these last two sequences is, by inspection, (A).
:Append the removed element, (ANA), giving (AANA), which, by inspection, is the LCS of the original sequences.

In general, for any sequences ''X'' and ''Y'' of length ''n'' and ''m'', if we denote their elements ''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' to ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' to ''y&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' and their prefixes ''X&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' to ''X&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''Y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' to ''Y&lt;sub&gt;m-1&lt;/sub&gt;'', then we can say this:
: If:  ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''=''y&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''
: then: ''LCS''(''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''Y&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'') = ''LCS''( ''X&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''Y&lt;sub&gt;m-1&lt;/sub&gt;'') ^ ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' 
where the caret ^ indicates that the following element, ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', is appended to the sequence.  Note that the LCS for ''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''Y&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' involves determining the LCS of the shorter sequences, ''X&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''Y&lt;sub&gt;m-1&lt;/sub&gt;''.

=== Second property ===
Suppose that the two sequences X and Y do not end in the same symbol.
Then the LCS of X and Y is the longer of the two sequences LCS(X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;,Y&lt;sub&gt;m-1&lt;/sub&gt;) and LCS(X&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt;,Y&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;).

To understand this property, consider the two following sequences :

sequence X: ABCDEFG (n elements)&lt;br /&gt;
sequence Y: BCDGK (m elements)

The LCS of these two sequences either ends with a G (the last element of sequence X) or does not.

'''Case 1: the LCS ends with a G'''&lt;br /&gt;
Then it cannot end with a K. Thus it does not hurt to remove the K from sequence Y: if K were in the LCS, it would be its last character; as a consequence K is not in the LCS. We can then write: LCS(X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;,Y&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;) = LCS(X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, Y&lt;sub&gt;m-1&lt;/sub&gt;).

'''Case 2: the LCS does not end with a G'''&lt;br /&gt;
Then it does not hurt to remove the G from the sequence X (for the same reason as above). And then we can write: LCS(X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;,Y&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;) = LCS(X&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt;, Y&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;).

In any case, the LCS we are looking for is one of LCS(X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, Y&lt;sub&gt;m-1&lt;/sub&gt;) or LCS(X&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt;, Y&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;). Those two last LCS are both common subsequences to X and Y. LCS(X,Y) is the longest. Thus its value is the longest sequence of LCS(X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, Y&lt;sub&gt;m-1&lt;/sub&gt;) and LCS(X&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt;, Y&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;).

=== ''LCS'' function defined ===
Let two sequences be defined as follows:  &lt;math&gt;X=(x_1,x_2 \cdots x_m)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y=(y_1,y_2 \cdots y_n)&lt;/math&gt;.  The prefixes of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;X_{1, 2,...m}&lt;/math&gt;; the prefixes of &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;Y_{1, 2,...n}&lt;/math&gt;.  Let &lt;math&gt;LCS(X_{i},Y_{j})&lt;/math&gt; represent the set of longest common subsequence of prefixes &lt;math&gt;X_{i}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y_{j}&lt;/math&gt;.  This set of sequences is given by the following.

:&lt;math&gt;
LCS\left(X_{i},Y_{j}\right) =
\begin{cases}
  \empty
&amp; \mbox{ if }\ i = 0 \mbox{ or }  j = 0 \\
  \textrm{  } LCS\left(X_{i-1},Y_{j-1}\right) \frown x_{i}
&amp; \mbox{ if } x_i = y_j \\
  \mbox{longest}\left(LCS\left(X_{i},Y_{j-1}\right),LCS\left(X_{i-1},Y_{j}\right)\right)
&amp; \mbox{ if } x_i \ne y_j \\
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

To find the longest subsequences common to &lt;math&gt;X_{i}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y_{j}&lt;/math&gt;, compare the elements &lt;math&gt;x_{i}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_{j}&lt;/math&gt;.  If they are equal, then the sequence &lt;math&gt;LCS(X_{i-1},Y_{j-1})&lt;/math&gt; is extended by that element, &lt;math&gt;x_{i}&lt;/math&gt;.  If they are not equal, then the longer of the two sequences, &lt;math&gt;LCS(X_{i}, Y_{j-1})&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;LCS(X_{i-1}, Y_{j})&lt;/math&gt;, is retained.  (If they are both the same length, but not identical, then both are retained.)  Notice that the subscripts are reduced by 1 in these formulas.  That can result in a subscript of 0.  Since the sequence elements are defined to start at 1, it was necessary to add the requirement that the LCS is empty when a subscript is zero.

=== Worked example ===
The longest subsequence common to ''R'' = (GAC), and ''C'' = (AGCAT) will be found.  Because the ''LCS'' function uses a "zeroth" element, it is convenient to define zero prefixes that are empty for these sequences:  ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; =  Ø; and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; =  Ø.  All the prefixes are placed in a table with ''C'' in the first row (making it a &lt;u&gt;c&lt;/u&gt;olumn header) and ''R'' in the first column (making it a &lt;u&gt;r&lt;/u&gt;ow header).

This table is used to store the LCS sequence for each step of the calculation.  The second column and second row have been filled in with Ø, because when an empty sequence is compared with a non-empty sequence, the longest common subsequence is always an empty sequence.

''LCS''(''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) is determined by comparing the first elements in each sequence.  G and A are not the same, so this LCS gets (using the "second property") the longest of the two sequences, ''LCS''(''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) and  ''LCS''(''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;).  According to the table, both of these are empty, so ''LCS''(''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) is also empty, as shown in the table below.  The arrows indicate that the sequence comes from both the cell above, ''LCS''(''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and the cell on the left, ''LCS''(''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;).

''LCS''(''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is determined by comparing G and G.  They match, so G is appended to the upper left sequence, ''LCS''(''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), which is (Ø), giving (ØG), which is (G).

For ''LCS''(''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), G and C do not match.  The sequence above is empty; the one to the left contains one element, G.  Selecting the longest of these, ''LCS''(''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is (G).  The arrow points to the left, since that is the longest of the two sequences.

''LCS''(''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), likewise, is (G).

''LCS''(''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;), likewise, is (G).

For ''LCS''(''R''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), A is compared with A.  The two elements match, so A is appended to Ø, giving (A).

For ''LCS''(''R''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), A and G do not match, so the longest of ''LCS''(''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), which is (G), and ''LCS''(''R''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), which is (A), is used.  In this case, they each contain one element, so this LCS is given two subsequences:  (A) and (G).

For ''LCS''(''R''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), A does not match C.  ''LCS''(''R''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) contains sequences (A) and (G); LCS(''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is (G), which is already contained in ''LCS''(''R''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).  The result is that ''LCS''(''R''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) also contains the two subsequences, (A) and (G).

For ''LCS''(''R''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), A matches A, which is appended to the upper left cell, giving (GA).

For ''LCS''(''R''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;), A does not match T.  Comparing the two sequences, (GA) and (G), the longest is (GA), so ''LCS''(''R''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) is (GA).

For ''LCS''(''R''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), C and A do not match, so ''LCS''(''R''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) gets the longest of the two sequences, (A).

For ''LCS''(''R''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), C and G do not match.  Both ''LCS''(''R''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and ''LCS''(''R''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) have one element.

For ''LCS''(''R''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), C and A do not match.  Combining ''LCS''(''R''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), which contains (AC) and (GC), and ''LCS''(''R''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), which contains (GA), gives a total of three sequences:  (AC), (GC), and (GA).

Finally, for ''LCS''(''R''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;), C and T do not match.  The result is that ''LCS''(''R''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) also contains the three sequences, (AC), (GC), and (GA).

The final result is that the last cell contains all the longest subsequences common to (AGCAT) and (GAC); these are (AC), (GC), and (GA).  The table also shows the longest common subsequences for every possible pair of prefixes.  For example, for (AGC) and (GA), the longest common subsequence are (A) and (G).

=== Traceback approach ===
Calculating the LCS of a row of the LCS table requires only the solutions to the current row and the previous row.  Still, for long sequences, these sequences can get numerous and long, requiring a lot of storage space.  Storage space can be saved by saving not the actual subsequences, but the length of the subsequence and the direction of the arrows, as in the table below.

The actual subsequences are deduced in a "traceback" procedure that follows the arrows backwards, starting from the last cell in the table.  When the length decreases, the sequences must have had a common element.  Several paths are possible when two arrows are shown in a cell.  Below is the table for such an analysis, with numbers colored in cells where the length is about to decrease.  The bold numbers trace out the sequence, (GA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Thomas H. Cormen]], [[Charles E. Leiserson]], [[Ronald L.

== Relation to other problems ==
For two strings &lt;math&gt;X_{1 \dots m}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y_{1 \dots n}&lt;/math&gt;, the length of the [[shortest common supersequence problem|shortest common supersequence]] is related to the length of the LCS by&lt;ref name="BHR00" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\left|SCS(X,Y)\right| = n + m - \left|LCS(X,Y)\right|.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Levenshtein distance|edit distance]] when only insertion and deletion is allowed (no substitution), or when the cost of the substitution is the double of the cost of an insertion or  deletion, is:

:&lt;math&gt;d'(X,Y) = n + m - 2 \cdot \left|LCS(X,Y)\right|.&lt;/math&gt;

== Code for the dynamic programming solution ==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2013}}

=== Computing the length of the LCS ===
The function below takes as input sequences &lt;code&gt;X[1..m]&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Y[1..n]&lt;/code&gt;, computes the LCS between &lt;code&gt;X[1..i]&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Y[1..j]&lt;/code&gt; for all &lt;code&gt;1 ≤ i ≤ m&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;1 ≤ j ≤ n&lt;/code&gt;, and stores it in &lt;code&gt;C[i,j]&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;C[m,n]&lt;/code&gt; will contain the length of the LCS of &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Y&lt;/code&gt;.

 '''function''' LCSLength(X[1..m], Y[1..n])
     C = array(0..m, 0..n)
     '''for''' i := 0..m
        C[i,0] = 0
     '''for''' j := 0..n
        C[0,j] = 0
     '''for''' i := 1..m
         '''for''' j := 1..n
             '''if''' X[i] = Y[j]
                 C[i,j] := C[i-1,j-1] + 1
             '''else'''
                 C[i,j] := max(C[i,j-1], C[i-1,j])
     '''return''' C[m,n]

Alternatively, [[memoization]] could be used.

=== Reading out a LCS ===
The following function [[backtracking|backtracks]] the choices taken when computing the &lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt; table. If the last characters in the prefixes are equal, they must be in an LCS. If not, check what gave the largest LCS of keeping &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_j&lt;/math&gt;, and make the same choice. Just choose one if they were equally long. Call the function with &lt;code&gt;i=m&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;j=n&lt;/code&gt;.

 '''function''' backtrack(C[0..m,0..n], X[1..m], Y[1..n], i, j)
     '''if''' i = 0 '''or''' j = 0
         '''return''' ""
     '''if ''' X[i] = Y[j]
         '''return''' backtrack(C, X, Y, i-1, j-1) + X[i]
     '''if''' C[i,j-1] &gt; C[i-1,j]
         '''return''' backtrack(C, X, Y, i, j-1)
     '''return''' backtrack(C, X, Y, i-1, j)

=== Reading out all LCSs ===
If choosing &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_j&lt;/math&gt; would give an equally long result, read out both resulting subsequences. This is returned as a set by this function. Notice that this function is not polynomial, as it might branch in almost every step if the strings are similar.

 '''function''' backtrackAll(C[0..m,0..n], X[1..m], Y[1..n], i, j)
     '''if''' i = 0 '''or''' j = 0
         '''return''' {""}
     '''if''' X[i] = Y[j]
         '''return''' {Z + X[i] '''for all''' Z '''in''' backtrackAll(C, X, Y, i-1, j-1)}
     '''R := {}
     '''if''' C[i,j-1] ≥ C[i-1,j]
         R := R ∪ backtrackAll(C, X, Y, i, j-1)
     '''if''' C[i-1,j] ≥ C[i,j-1]
         R := R ∪ backtrackAll(C, X, Y, i-1, j)
     '''return''' R

=== Print the diff ===
This function will backtrack through the C matrix, and print the [[diff]] between the two sequences. Notice that you will get a different answer if you exchange &lt;code&gt;≥&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt;, with &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;≤&lt;/code&gt; below.

 '''function''' printDiff(C[0..m,0..n], X[1..m], Y[1..n], i, j)
     '''if''' i &gt; 0 '''and''' j &gt; 0 '''and''' X[i] = Y[j]
         printDiff(C, X, Y, i-1, j-1)
         print "  " + X[i]
     '''else if''' j &gt; 0 '''and''' (i = 0 '''or''' C[i,j-1] ≥ C[i-1,j])
         printDiff(C, X, Y, i, j-1)
         print "+ " + Y[j]
     '''else if''' i &gt; 0 '''and''' (j = 0 '''or''' C[i,j-1] &lt; C[i-1,j])
         printDiff(C, X, Y, i-1, j)
         print "- " + X[i]
     '''else'''
         print ""

=== Example ===
Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be “&lt;code&gt;XMJYAUZ&lt;/code&gt;” and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; be “&lt;code&gt;MZJAWXU&lt;/code&gt;”. The longest common subsequence between &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is “&lt;code&gt;MJAU&lt;/code&gt;”. The table &lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt; shown below, which is generated by the function &lt;code&gt;LCSLength&lt;/code&gt;, shows the lengths of the longest common subsequences between prefixes of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;. The &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;th row and &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;th column shows the length of the LCS between &lt;math&gt;X_{1..i}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y_{1..j}&lt;/math&gt;.

The &lt;span style="background: yellow"&gt;highlighted&lt;/span&gt; numbers show the path the function &lt;code&gt;backtrack&lt;/code&gt; would follow from the bottom right to the top left corner, when reading out an LCS. If the current symbols in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; are equal, they are part of the LCS, and we go both up and left (shown in '''bold'''). If not, we go up or left, depending on which cell has a higher number. This corresponds to either taking the LCS between &lt;math&gt;X_{1..i-1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y_{1..j}&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;X_{1..i}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y_{1..j-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Code optimization ==
Several optimizations can be made to the algorithm above to speed it up for real-world cases.

=== Reduce the problem set ===
The C matrix in the naive algorithm [[quadratic growth|grows quadratically]] with the lengths of the sequences.  For two 100-item sequences, a 10,000-item matrix would be needed, and 10,000 comparisons would need to be done.  In most real-world cases, especially source code diffs and patches, the beginnings and ends of files rarely change, and almost certainly not both at the same time.  If only a few items have changed in the middle of the sequence, the beginning and end can be eliminated.  This reduces not only the memory requirements for the matrix, but also the number of comparisons that must be done.

 '''function''' LCS(X[1..m], Y[1..n])
     start := 1
     m_end := m
     n_end := n
     ''trim off the matching items at the beginning''
     '''while''' start ≤ m_end '''and''' start ≤ n_end '''and''' X[start] = Y[start]
         start := start + 1
     ''trim off the matching items at the end''
     '''while''' start ≤ m_end '''and''' start ≤ n_end '''and''' X[m_end] = Y[n_end]
         m_end := m_end - 1
         n_end := n_end - 1
     C = array(start-1..m_end, start-1..n_end)
     ''only loop over the items that have changed''
     '''for''' i := start..m_end

In the best-case scenario, a sequence with no changes, this optimization would completely eliminate the need for the C matrix.  In the worst-case scenario, a change to the very first and last items in the sequence, only two additional comparisons are performed.

=== Reduce the comparison time ===
Most of the time taken by the naive algorithm is spent performing comparisons between items in the sequences.  For textual sequences such as source code, you want to view lines as the sequence elements instead of single characters.  This can mean comparisons of relatively long strings for each step in the algorithm.  Two optimizations can be made that can help to reduce the time these comparisons consume.

=== Reduce strings to hashes ===
A [[hash function]] or [[checksum]] can be used to reduce the size of the strings in the sequences.  That is, for source code where the average line is 60 or more characters long, the hash or checksum for that line might be only 8 to 40 characters long.  Additionally, the randomized nature of hashes and checksums would guarantee that comparisons would short-circuit faster, as lines of source code will rarely be changed at the beginning.

There are three primary drawbacks to this optimization.  First, an amount of time needs to be spent beforehand to precompute the hashes for the two sequences.  Second, additional memory needs to be allocated for the new hashed sequences.  However, in comparison to the naive algorithm used here, both of these drawbacks are relatively minimal.

The third drawback is that of [[hash collision|collisions]].  Since the checksum or hash is not guaranteed to be unique, there is a small chance that two different items could be reduced to the same hash.  This is unlikely in source code, but it is possible.  A cryptographic hash would therefore be far better suited for this optimization, as its entropy is going to be significantly greater than that of a simple checksum.  However, the benefits may not be worth the setup and computational requirements of a cryptographic hash for small sequence lengths.

=== Reduce the required space ===
If only the length of the LCS is required, the matrix can be reduced to a &lt;math&gt;2\times \min(n,m)&lt;/math&gt; matrix with ease, or to a &lt;math&gt;\min(m,n)+1&lt;/math&gt; vector (smarter) as the dynamic programming approach only needs the current and previous columns of the matrix. [[Hirschberg's algorithm]] allows the construction of the optimal sequence itself in the same quadratic time and linear space bounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink = Dan Hirschberg|author=Hirschberg, D. S.|title=A linear space algorithm for computing maximal common subsequences|journal=Communications of the ACM|volume=18|issue=6|year=1975|pages=341–343|doi=10.1145/360825.360861}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Further optimized algorithms ===
Several algorithms exist that are worst-case faster than the presented dynamic programming approach.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=mFd_grFyiT4C&amp;pg=PA132&amp;lpg=PA132&amp;dq=hunt+szymanski+algorithm&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sMc-HtvNTQ&amp;sig=FtrZ_b5JdJ25Ighwc1-XOfysaf8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-BU9VPK7OpS7ggT0gYEQ&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; For problems with a bounded alphabet size, the [[Method of Four Russians]] can be used to reduce the running time of the dynamic programming algorithm by a logarithmic factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

When the alphabet size is constant, the expected length of the LCS is proportional to the length of the two strings, and the constants of proportionality (depending on alphabet size) are known as the [[Chvátal–Sankoff constants]]. Their exact values are not known, but upper and lower bounds on their values have been proven,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7188">In mathematics, a '''Markov odometer''' is a certain type of [[topological dynamical system]]. It plays a fundamental role in [[ergodic theory]] and especially in [[Orbit (dynamics)|orbit theory of dynamical systems]], since a theorem of [[Henry Abel Dye|H. Dye]] asserts that every [[ergodic]] [[nonsingular transformation]] is orbit-equivalent to a Markov odometer.&lt;ref&gt;A. H. Dooley and T. Hamachi, Nonsingular dynamical systems, Bratteli diagrams and Markov odometers. Isr. J. Math. 138 (2003), 93–123.&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic example of such system is the "nonsingular odometer", based on the additive [[topological group]] of [[p-adic integers]] endowed with structure of a dynamical system for the transformation &lt;math&gt;x \mapsto x+\underline{1}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\underline{1}:=(1,0,0,\dots)&lt;/math&gt;. The general form, which is called "Markov odometer", can be constructed through [[Bratteli–Vershik diagram]] to define ''Bratteli–Vershik compactum'' space together with a corresponding transformation.

==Construction==

===Nonsingular odometer===

We introduce first the basic example of [[dyadic integers]]. Let &lt;math&gt;\Omega=\{0,1\}^{\mathbb{N}}&lt;/math&gt; be the dyadic integers, andowed with the addition which is defined for each coordinate by
&lt;math&gt;(x+y)_n=x_n+y_n+\varepsilon_n\,\bmod\,2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;!-- I've added a small space before and after \bmod because of a software bug. \bmod should behave as a binary operator with proper spacing, but it does not. If the bug is ever fixed, the small manually added spaces should be removed. --&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_0=0&lt;/math&gt; and

: &lt;math&gt;
\varepsilon_n=\begin{cases}
0 &amp; x_{n-1}+y_{n-1}&lt;2\\
1 &amp; x_{n-1}+y_{n-1}=2
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

inductively. Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt; be the Borel [[sigma-algebra]] generated by the [[Cylinder set]], with the [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] &lt;math&gt;\mu_p(x_n=1)=p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mu_p(x_n=0)=1-p&lt;/math&gt;, for some &lt;math&gt;0&lt;p&lt;1&lt;/math&gt; independently on &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;T:\Omega\to\Omega&lt;/math&gt; be the transformation &lt;math&gt;T(x)=x+\underline{1}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\underline{1}:=(1,0,0,\dots)&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the transformation &lt;math&gt;T\left(1,\dots,1,0,x_{k+1},x_{k+2},\dots\right) = \left(0,\dots,0,1,x_{k+1},x_{k+2},\dots \right)&lt;/math&gt;.

One can show that the &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \frac{d \mu_p \circ T}{d \mu_p} = \left(\frac{1-p} p\right)^\varphi&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\varphi(x)=\min\left\{ n\in\mathbb{N}\mid x_n = 0 \right\}-2&lt;/math&gt;. Hence &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\mu_p&lt;/math&gt;-nonsingular. Moreover, one can show that &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; has the following property: For every &lt;math&gt;x \in \Omega&lt;/math&gt; and natural number &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, the orbit of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; under &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; along the steps &lt;math&gt;0,1,\ldots,2^n-1&lt;/math&gt; is exactly the set &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; (as presentation of dyadic integers). As a result, &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\mu_p&lt;/math&gt;-ergodic. Finally, &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is [[conservative transformation|conservative]] since every invertible ergodic nonsingular transformation in nonatomic space is conservative.

The same construction enables to define such a system for every p-adic integers, and more generally for every product space of the form &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\Omega=\prod_{n\in\mathbb{N}}A_{n}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;A_n=\{ 0,1,\dots,m_n-1\} &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;m_n \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, endowed with the product Borel sigma-algebra and some nonatomic measure &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\mu=\prod_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\mu_{n}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mu_n&lt;/math&gt; is some measure on &lt;math&gt;A_n&lt;/math&gt;. The corresponding map is defined by &lt;math&gt;T(x_1,\dots,x_k,x_{k+1},x_{k+2},\dots)=(0,\dots,0,x_{k+1},x_{k+2},\dots)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the smallest index for which &lt;math&gt;x_k \neq m_k-1&lt;/math&gt;.

===Markov odometer===

Let &lt;math&gt;B=(V,E)&lt;/math&gt; be an ordered [[Bratteli–Vershik diagram]], consists on a set of vertices of the form &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\coprod_{n\in\mathbb{N}}V^{(n)}&lt;/math&gt; (disjoint union) where &lt;math&gt;V^0&lt;/math&gt; is a singelton and on a set of edges &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\coprod_{n\in\mathbb{N}}E^{(n)}&lt;/math&gt; (disjoint union).

The diagram includes source surjection-mappings &lt;math&gt;s_n:E^{(n)} \to V^{(n-1)}&lt;/math&gt; and range surjection-mappings &lt;math&gt;r_n:E^{(n)} \to V^{(n)}&lt;/math&gt;. We assume that &lt;math&gt;e,e' \in E^{(n)}&lt;/math&gt; are comparable if and only if &lt;math&gt;r_n(e) = r_n(e')&lt;/math&gt;.

For such diagram we look at the product space &lt;math&gt;\textstyle E:=\prod_{n\in\mathbb{N}}E^{(n)}&lt;/math&gt; equipped with the [[product topology]]. Define "Bratteli–Vershik compactum" to be the subspace of infinite paths,

: &lt;math&gt;X_{B}:=\left\{ x=(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}} \in E\mid x_n\in E^{(n)}\text{ and } r (x_n) = s(x_{n+1}) \right\} &lt;/math&gt;

Assume there exists only one infinite path &lt;math&gt;x_{\max} = (x_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}&lt;/math&gt; for which each &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; is maximal and similarly one infinite path &lt;math&gt;x_{\text{min}}&lt;/math&gt;. Define the "Bratteli-Vershik map" &lt;math&gt;T_B:X_B \to X_B&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;T( x_{\max}) = x_{\min}&lt;/math&gt; and, for any &lt;math&gt;x = (x_n)_{n\in \mathbb{N}} \neq x_{\max}&lt;/math&gt; define &lt;math&gt;T_B(x_1,\dots,x_k,x_{k+1},\dots)=(y_1,\dots,y_k,x_{k+1},\dots)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the first index for which &lt;math&gt;x_k&lt;/math&gt; is not maximal and accordingly let &lt;math&gt;(y_1,\dots,y_k)&lt;/math&gt; be the unique path for which &lt;math&gt;y_1,\dots,y_{k-1}&lt;/math&gt; are all maximal and &lt;math&gt;y_k&lt;/math&gt; is the successor of &lt;math&gt;x_k&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;T_B&lt;/math&gt; is [[homeomorphism]] of &lt;math&gt;X_B&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;P=\left(P^{(1)},P^{(2)},\dots \right)&lt;/math&gt; be a sequence of [[stochastic matrix|stochastic matrices]] &lt;math&gt;P^{(n)}=\left(p^{(n)}_{(v,e) \in V^{n-1} \times E^(n)}\right)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;p^{(n)}_{v,e} &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;v=s_n(e)&lt;/math&gt;. Define "Markov measure" on the cylinders of &lt;math&gt;X_B&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;\mu_P ([e_1,\dots,e_n]) = p^{(1)}_{s_1(e_1),e_1}\cdots p^{(n)}_{s_n(e_n),e_n}&lt;/math&gt;. Then the system &lt;math&gt;\left(X_B, \mathcal{B}, \mu_P, T_B \right)&lt;/math&gt; is called a "Markov odometer".

One can show that the nonsingular odometer is a Markov odometer where all the &lt;math&gt;V^{(n)}&lt;/math&gt; are singeltons.

 }}. The paper won the 2013 [[Dijkstra Prize]]. In the words of the prize committee: "This paper has had a major impact on distributed message-passing algorithms. It focused a spotlight on the notion of locality in distributed computation and raised interesting questions concerning the locality level of various distributed problems, in terms of their time complexity on different classes of networks. Towards that goal, in this paper, Linial developed a model particularly suitable for studying locality, which ignores message sizes, asynchrony and failures. This clean model allowed researchers to isolate the effects of locality and study the roles of distances and neighborhoods, as graph theoretic notions, and their interrelations with algorithmic and complexity-theoretic problems in distributed computing."&lt;ref name="Dijkstra"&gt;[http://www.podc.org/dijkstra/2013-dijkstra-prize/ 2013 Edsger W.

An '''open system''' is a system that has external interactions. Such interactions can take the form of information, energy, or material transfers into or out of the system boundary, depending on the discipline which defines the concept. An open system is contrasted with the concept of an [[isolated system]] which exchanges neither energy, matter, nor information with its environment. An open system is also known as a constant volume system or a flow system.

The concept of an open system was formalized within a framework that enabled one to interrelate the [[Organismic theory|theory of the organism]], [[thermodynamics]], and [[Theory of Evolution|evolutionary theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Luhmann, Niklas. ''Social Systems''. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1995; pp. 6-7&lt;/ref&gt; This concept was expanded upon with the advent of [[information theory]] and subsequently [[systems theory]]. Today the concept has its applications in the natural and social sciences.

In the [[natural sciences]] an open system is one whose border is permeable to both [[energy]] and [[mass]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maxwellian.demon.co.uk/faq/glossary.html Glossary] Maxwell Demon, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; In thermodynamics a [[closed system]], by contrast, is permeable to energy but not to matter. 

The definition of an open system assumes that there are supplies of energy that cannot be depleted; in practice, this energy is supplied from some source in the surrounding environment, which can be treated as infinite for the purposes of study. One type of open system is the [[radiant energy]] system, which receives its energy from [[solar radiation]] &amp;ndash; an energy source that can be regarded as inexhaustible for all practical purposes. A [[closed system]] contains limited energies.

==Social sciences==
In the [[social sciences]] an open system is a process that exchanges material, energy, people, capital and information with its environment. French/Greek philosopher [[Kostas Axelos]] argued that seeing the [[world-systems theory|"world system"]] as inherently open (though unified) would solve many of the problems in the social sciences, including that of [[Praxis intervention|praxis]] (the relation of knowledge to practice), so that various social scientific disciplines would work together rather than create a monopoly whereby the world appears only sociological, political, historical, or psychological. Axelos argues that theorizing a closed system contributes to ''making'' it closed, and is thus a conservative approach.&lt;ref&gt;Axelos, K. ([2006] 1984). "The World: Being Becoming Totality," from ''Systematique ouverte'' (Trans. Gerald Moore, Les Editions de Minuit: Paris). ''Environment and Planning D: Society and Space,'' Vol. 24, 643-651.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Louis Althusser|Althusserian]] concept of [[overdetermination]] (drawing on Sigmund Freud) posits that there are always multiple causes in every event.&lt;ref&gt;Althusser, L. ([2005] 1969). ''For Marx.'' London: Verso Books, Ch. 3: "Contradiction and Overdetermination," [http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/althusser/1962/overdetermination.htm].&lt;/ref&gt;
[[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] uses this to argue that when systems such as capitalism enter a phase of crisis, it could happen through one of a number of elements, such as gender roles, the relation to nature/the environment, or crises in accumulation.&lt;ref&gt;RSA Animate - David Harvey, The Crises of Capitalism: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26o22Y33h9s].&lt;/ref&gt; Looking at the crisis in accumulation, Harvey argues that phenomena such as [[foreign direct investment]], [[privatization]] of state-owned resources, and [[accumulation by dispossession]] act as necessary outlets when capital has overaccumulated too much in private hands and cannot circulate effectively in the marketplace. He cites the forcible displacement of Mexican and Indian peasants since the 1970s and the Asian and South-East Asian financial crisis of 1997-8, involving "hedge fund raising" of national currencies, as examples of this.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, D. (2005). ''The New Imperialism.'' New York: Oxford University Press USA, Ch. 3: "Accumulation by Dispossession," 137-182.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Structural functionalism|Structural functionalists]] such as [[Talcott Parsons]] and neofunctionalists such as [[Niklas Luhmann]] have incorporated system theory to describe society and its components.

The '''Oswald Veblen Prize in Geometry''' is an award granted by the [[American Mathematical Society]] for notable research in [[geometry]] or [[topology]].  It was founded in 1961 in memory of [[Oswald Veblen]].  The Veblen Prize is now worth US$5000, and is awarded every three years.

The first seven prize winners were awarded for works in topology. [[James Harris Simons]] and [[William Thurston]] were the first ones to receive it for works in geometry (for some distinctions, see [[geometry and topology]]).&lt;ref name="DurenAskey1989"&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Peter L.

'''Pareto efficiency''' or '''Pareto optimality''' is a state of allocation of resources from which it is impossible to reallocate so as to make any one individual or preference criterion better off without making at least one  individual or preference criterion worse off. The concept is named after [[Vilfredo Pareto]] (1848–1923), Italian engineer and economist, who used the concept in his studies of [[economic efficiency]] and [[income distribution]]. The concept has been applied in academic fields such as [[economics]], [[engineering]], and the [[life sciences]].

The '''Pareto frontier''' is the set of all Pareto efficient allocations, conventionally shown [[Chart|graphically]]. It also is variously known as the '''Pareto front''' or '''Pareto set'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cenaero.be/Page.asp?docid=27103&amp;|title=Pareto Front|last=proximedia|first=|date=|website=www.cenaero.be|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Pareto improvement''' is a change to a different allocation that makes at least one individual or preference criterion [[utility|better off]] without making any other individual or preference criterion worse off, given a certain initial allocation of [[good (economics)|good]]s among a set of [[agent (economics)|individuals]]. An allocation is defined as "Pareto efficient" or "Pareto optimal" when no further Pareto improvements can be made, in which case we are assumed to have reached '''Pareto optimality'''.

"Pareto efficiency" is considered as a minimal notion of efficiency that does not necessarily result in a socially desirable distribution of resources: it makes no statement about [[Social equality|equality]], or the overall well-being of a society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=N. |last=Barr ||author-link=Nicholas Barr|chapter=3.2.2 The relevance of efficiency to different theories of society |title=Economics of the Welfare State |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=DOg0BM1XiqQC&amp;pg=PA46 |year=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-929781-8 |pages=46 |edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Amartya Sen |first=A. |last=Sen |title=Markets and freedom: Achievements and limitations of the market mechanism in promoting individual freedoms |journal=Oxford Economic Papers |volume=45 |issue=4 |pages=519–541 |date=October 1993 |jstor=2663703 |url=http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr06/cos444/papers/sen.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is simply a statement of impossibility of improving one variable without harming other variables in the subject of [[multi-objective optimization]] (also termed '''Pareto optimization'''). 

The notion of Pareto efficiency has been applied to the selection of alternatives in engineering and similar fields. Each option is first assessed, under multiple criteria, and then a subset of options is ostensibly identified with the property that no other option can [[Categorical distribution|categorically]] outperform any of its members.

== Overview ==

[[File:Pareto Efficient Frontier 1024x1024.png|thumb|256px|A [[production-possibility frontier]], the red line in the figure above, is an example of a Pareto-efficient frontier, where the frontier and the area left and below it is a continuous room of choices. The red points on the frontier are examples of Pareto-optimal choices of production. Points off the frontier, such as N and K, are not Pareto-efficient, since there exist points on the frontier which Pareto-dominate them.]]

"Pareto optimality" is a formally defined concept used to determine when an [[resource allocation|allocation]] is optimal. An allocation is ''not'' Pareto optimal if there is an alternative allocation where improvements can be made to at least one participant's well-being without reducing any other participant's well-being. If there is a transfer that satisfies this condition, the reallocation is called a "Pareto improvement." When no further Pareto improvements are possible, the allocation is a "Pareto optimum."

The formal presentation of the concept in an economy is as follows: Consider an economy with &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt; agents and &lt;math&gt; j &lt;/math&gt; goods. Then an allocation &lt;math&gt; \{x_1, ..., x_i\} &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; x_n \in \mathbb{R}^j &lt;/math&gt;, is ''Pareto optimal'' if there is no other feasible allocation &lt;math&gt; \{x_1', ..., x_i'\} &lt;/math&gt; such that, for utility function &lt;math&gt; u_i &lt;/math&gt; for each agent &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; u_n(x_n') \geq u_n(x_n) &lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt; n \in \{1, ..., i\} &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; u_n(x_n') &gt; u_n(x_n) &lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="AndreuMas95"&gt;{{citation|author-link=Andreu Mas-Colell|last1=Mas-Colell|first1=A.| first2=Michael D.|last2=Whinston|first3=Jerry R.|last3=Green|year=1995|title=Microeconomic Theory|chapter=Chapter 16: Equilibrium and its Basic Welfare Properties|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn= 0-19-510268-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, in this simple economy, "feasibility" refers to an allocation where the total amount of each good that is allocated sums to no more than the total amount of the good in the economy. In a more complex economy with production, an allocation would consist both of consumption [[Vector space|vector]]s and production vectors, and feasibility would require that the total amount of each consumed good is no greater than the initial endowment plus the amount produced.

In principle, a change from a generally inefficient economic allocation to an efficient one is not necessarily considered to be a Pareto improvement. Even when there are overall gains in the economy, if a single agent is disadvantaged by the reallocation, the allocation is not Pareto optimal. For instance, if a change in economic policy eliminates a monopoly and that market subsequently becomes competitive, the gain to others may be large. However, since the monopolist is disadvantaged, this is not a Pareto improvement. In theory, if the gains to the economy are larger than the loss to the monopolist, the monopolist could be compensated for its loss while still leaving a net gain for others in the economy, allowing for a Pareto improvement. Thus, in practice, to ensure that nobody is disadvantaged by a change aimed at achieving Pareto efficiency, [[compensation principle|compensation]] of one or more parties may be required. It is acknowledged, in the real world, that such compensations may have [[unintended consequences]] leading to incentive distortions over time, as agents supposedly anticipate such compensations and change their actions accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Ricardian equivalence]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the idealized conditions of the [[first welfare theorem]], a system of [[free market]]s, also called a "[[competitive equilibrium]]," leads to a Pareto-efficient outcome. It was first demonstrated mathematically by economists [[Kenneth Arrow]] and [[Gérard Debreu]]. 

However, the result only holds under the restrictive assumptions necessary for the proof: markets exist for all possible goods, so there are no [[externality|externalities]]; all markets are in full equilibrium; markets are perfectly competitive; transaction costs are negligible; and market participants have [[perfect information]]. 

In the absence of perfect information or complete markets, outcomes will generally be Pareto inefficient, per the [[Joseph Stiglitz#Information asymmetry|Greenwald-Stiglitz theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.2307/1891114 |last1=Greenwald |first1=B. |last2=Stiglitz |first2=J.

The [[second welfare theorem]] is essentially the reverse of the first welfare-theorem. It states that under similar, ideal assumptions, any Pareto optimum can be obtained by some [[competitive equilibrium]], or [[free market]] system, although it may also require a [[lump-sum]] transfer of wealth.&lt;ref name="AndreuMas95"&gt;{{citation|author-link=Andreu Mas-Colell|last1=Mas-Colell|first1=A.| first2=Michael D.|last2=Whinston|first3=Jerry R.|last3=Green|year=1995|title=Microeconomic Theory|chapter=Chapter 16: Equilibrium and its Basic Welfare Properties|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn= 0-19-510268-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Weak Pareto efficiency ==

A "weak Pareto optimum" (WPO) is an allocation for which there are no possible alternative allocations whose realization would cause every individual to gain.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Thus, an alternative allocation is considered to be a Pareto improvement ''if and only if'' the alternative allocation is strictly preferred by ''all'' individuals. When contrasted with weak Pareto efficiency, a standard Pareto optimum as described above may be referred to as a "strong Pareto optimum" (SPO).

Weak Pareto-optimality is "weaker" than strong Pareto-optimality in the sense that any SPO also qualifies as a WPO, but a WPO allocation is not necessarily an SPO.

A market doesn't require [[Local nonsatiation|local nonsatiation]] to get to a weak Pareto-optimum.&lt;ref&gt;Markey‐Towler, Brendan and John Foster. "Why economic theory has little to say about the causes and effects of inequality", School of Economics, [[University of Queensland]], Australia, 21 Feb 2013, RePEc:qld:uq2004:476&lt;/ref&gt;

== Constrained Pareto efficiency {{anchor|Constrained Pareto efficiency}}==
The condition of '''constrained Pareto optimality''' is a weaker version of the standard condition of Pareto optimality employed in [[economics]], which ostensibly accounts for the fact that a potential planner (e.g., the government) may not be able to improve upon a decentralized market outcome, even if that outcome is inefficient. This will occur if it is limited by the same informational or institutional constraints as are individual agents.&lt;ref&gt;Magill, M., &amp; Quinzii, M., ''Theory of Incomplete Markets'', MIT Press, 2002, p. 104 [https://books.google.com/books?id=d66GXq2F2M0C&amp;pg=PA104&amp;lpg=PA104&amp;dq=constrained+pareto+optimality&amp;source=web&amp;ots=IQFRM9b00n&amp;sig=LHWki_HOLB77G8xw3RiT0-0DSeY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result].&lt;/ref&gt;

The most commonly proffered example is of a setting where individuals have private information (for example, a labor market where the worker's own productivity is known to the worker but not to a potential employer, or a used-car market where the quality of a car is known to the seller but not to the buyer) which results in [[moral hazard]] or an [[adverse selection]] and a sub-optimal outcome. In such a case, a planner who wishes to improve the situation is deemed unlikely to have access to any information that the participants in the markets do not have. Hence, the planner cannot implement allocation rules which are based on the idiosyncratic characteristics of individuals; for example, "if a person is of type A, they pay price p1, but if of type B, they pay price p2" (see [[Lindahl prices]]). Essentially, only anonymous rules are allowed (of the sort "Everyone pays price p") or rules based on observable behavior; "if any person chooses x at price px, then they get a subsidy of ten dollars, and nothing otherwise". If there exists no allowed rule that can successfully improve upon the market outcome, then that outcome is said to be "constrained Pareto-optimal."

Note that the concept of constrained Pareto optimality assumes benevolence on the part of the planner and hence it is distinct from the concept of [[government failure]], which occurs when the policy making politicians fail to achieve an optimal outcome simply because they are not necessarily acting in the public's best interest.

== Use in engineering and economics==

[[File:Front pareto.svg|thumb|300px|Example of a Pareto frontier. The boxed points represent feasible choices, and smaller values are preferred to larger ones. Point ''C'' is not on the Pareto frontier because it is dominated by both point ''A'' and point ''B''. Points ''A'' and ''B'' are not strictly dominated by any other, and hence do lie on the frontier.]] The notion of Pareto efficiency has been used in engineering. Given a set of choices and a way of valuing them, the '''Pareto frontier''' or '''Pareto set''' or '''Pareto front''' is the set of choices that are Pareto efficient. By restricting attention to the set of choices that are Pareto-efficient, a designer can make [[Trade-off|tradeoffs]] within this set, rather than considering the full range of every parameter.

===Formal representation===

====Pareto frontier====

For a given system, the '''Pareto frontier''' or '''Pareto set''' is the set of parameterizations (allocations) that are all Pareto efficient. Finding Pareto frontiers is particularly useful in engineering. By yielding all of the potentially optimal solutions, a designer can make focused [[Trade-off|tradeoffs]] within this constrained set of parameters, rather than needing to consider the full ranges of parameters.

The Pareto frontier, ''P''(''Y''), may be more formally described as follows. Consider a system with function &lt;math&gt;f: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt;, where ''X'' is a [[compact space|compact set]] of feasible decisions in the [[metric space]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, and ''Y'' is the feasible set of criterion vectors in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;Y = \{ y \in \mathbb{R}^m:\; y = f(x), x \in X\;\}&lt;/math&gt;.

We assume that the preferred directions of criteria values are known. A point &lt;math&gt;y^{\prime\prime} \in \mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt; is preferred to (strictly dominates) another point &lt;math&gt;y^{\prime} \in \mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt;, written as &lt;math&gt;y^{\prime\prime} \succ y^{\prime}&lt;/math&gt;. The Pareto frontier is thus written as:

: &lt;math&gt;P(Y) = \{ y^\prime \in Y: \; \{y^{\prime\prime} \in Y:\; y^{\prime\prime} \succ y^\prime, y^{\prime\prime} \neq y^\prime \; \} = \empty \}. &lt;/math&gt;

==== Relationship to the marginal rate of substitution ====
A significant aspect about the Pareto frontier in economics is that, at a Pareto-efficient allocation, the marginal rate of substitution is the same for all consumers. A formal statement can be derived by considering a system with ''m'' consumers and ''n'' goods, and a utility function of each consumer as &lt;math&gt;z_i=f^i(x^i)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;x^i=(x_1^i, x_2^i, \ldots, x_n^i)&lt;/math&gt; is the vector of goods, both for all ''i''. The feasibility constraint is &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^m x_j^i = b_j&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;j=1,\ldots,n&lt;/math&gt;. To find the Pareto optimal allocation, we maximize the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]]:

: &lt;math&gt;L_i((x_j^k)_{k,j}, (\lambda_k)_k, (\mu_j)_j)=f^i(x^i)+\sum_{k=2}^m \lambda_k(z_k- f^k(x^k))+\sum_{j=1}^n \mu_j \left( b_j-\sum_{k=1}^m x_j^k \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;(\lambda_k)_k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(\mu_j)_j&lt;/math&gt; are the vectors of multipliers. Taking the partial derivative of the Lagrangian with respect to each good &lt;math&gt;x_j^k&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;j=1,\ldots,n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k=1,\ldots, m&lt;/math&gt; and gives the following system of first-order conditions:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial L_i}{\partial x_j^i} = f_{x^i_j}^1-\mu_j=0\text{ for }j=1,\ldots,n,&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial L_i}{\partial x_j^k} = -\lambda_k f_{x^k_j}^i-\mu_j=0 \text{ for }k= 2,\ldots,m \text{ and }j=1,\ldots,n,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;f_{x^i_j}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the partial derivative of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;x_j^i&lt;/math&gt;. Now, fix any &lt;math&gt;k\neq i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j,s\in \{1,\ldots,n\}&lt;/math&gt;. The above first-order condition imply that

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{f_{x_j^i}^i}{f_{x_s^i}^i}=\frac{\mu_j}{\mu_s}=\frac{f_{x_j^k}^k}{f_{x_s^k}^k}.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, in a Pareto-optimal allocation, the marginal rate of substitution must be the same for all consumers.

==== Computation ====
[[Algorithm]]s for computing the Pareto frontier of a finite set of alternatives have been studied in [[computer science]] and power engineering.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/6/3/1439/pdf Tomoiagă, B.; Chindriş, M.; Sumper, A.; Sudria-Andreu, A.; Villafafila-Robles, R.

==== Use in biology ====
Pareto optimisation has also been studied in biological processes. In bacteria, genes were shown to be either inexpensive to make (resource efficient) or easier to read (translation efficient). Natural selection acts to push highly expressed genes towards the Pareto frontier for resource use and translational efficiency. Genes near the Pareto frontier were also shown to evolve more slowly (indicating that they are providing a selective advantage).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1186/s13059-018-1480-7|last1=Seward|first1=Emily A. |last2=Kelly|first2=Steven|title=Selection-driven cost-efficiency optimization of transcripts modulates gene evolutionary rate in bacteria.|journal=Genome Biology|volume=19|pages=102|year=2018|url=https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-018-1480-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==

It would be incorrect to treat Pareto efficiency as equivalent to societal optimization, as the latter is a [[normative]] concept that is a matter of interpretation that typically would account for the consequence of degrees of inequality of distribution. An example would be a school district with low property tax revenue versus one with much higher revenue. Generally, more equal distribution occurs with the help of government redistribution.{{Citation needed|reason=A statement is made here that has strong political implications. Furthermore, the definition of equality is not well defined here|date=May 2018}}

Pareto efficiency does not require a totally equitable distribution of wealth. An economy in which a wealthy few hold the [[Wealth condensation|vast majority of resources]] can be Pareto efficient. This possibility is inherent in the definition of Pareto efficiency; often the [[status quo]] is Pareto efficient regardless of the degree to which wealth is equitably distributed. A simple example is the distribution of a pie among three people. The most equitable distribution would assign one third to each person. However the assignment of, say, a half section to each of two individuals and none to the third is also Pareto optimal despite not being equitable, because none of the recipients could be made better off without decreasing someone else's share; and there are many other such distribution examples. An example of a Pareto inefficient distribution of the pie would be allocation of a quarter of the pie to each of the three, with the remainder discarded. The origin (and utility value) of the pie is conceived as immaterial in these examples. In such cases, whereby a "windfall" is gained that none of the potential distributees actually produced (e.g., land, inherited wealth, a portion of the broadcast spectrum, or some other resource), the criterion of Pareto efficiency does not determine a unique optimal allocation. Wealth consolidation may exclude others from wealth accumulation because of bars to market entry, etc.

The [[liberal paradox]] elaborated by [[Amartya Sen]] shows that when people have preferences about what other people do, the goal of Pareto efficiency can come into conflict with the goal of individual liberty.

[[Image:Cartoon_mountain_pass_symbolizing_path_of_least_resistance.png|thumb|250px|Hikers choose the easy way to cross hills.]]

The '''path of least resistance''' is the physical or metaphorical pathway that provides the least resistance to forward motion by a given object or entity, among a set of alternative paths.  The concept is often used to describe why an object or entity takes a given path. The way in which water flows is often given as an example for the idea.

[[File:Path of least resistance.jpg|thumb|Bicycle traffic barrier used to slow down cyclists circumvented by a detour on the lawn, thereby showing a literal path of least resistance.]]

==Description==
In [[physics]], the "path of least resistance" is a [[heuristic]] from [[folk physics]] that can sometimes, in very simple situations, describe approximately what happens.  It is an approximation of the tendency to the [[least energy state]].&lt;ref name="Weissman2012"&gt;{{Cite book|author=David Weissman|title=Cage, The: Must, Should, and Ought from Is|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iyk7hognVysC&amp;pg=PA68|date=1 February 2012|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-8119-6|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples are "what goes up must come down" ([[gravity]]) and "heat goes from hot to cold" ([[second law of thermodynamics]]).  But these simple descriptions are not derived from laws of physics and in more complicated cases these heuristics will fail to give even approximately correct results.  In electrical circuits, for example, current always follows all available paths, and in some simple cases the "path of least resistance" will take up most of the current, but this will not be generally true in even slightly more complicated circuits.  It may seem for example, that if there are three paths of approximately equal resistance, the majority of the current will flow down one of the three paths. However, due to electrons repelling each other the total path of least resistance is in fact to have approximate equal current flowing through each path. The reason for this is that three paths made of equally conductive wire will have a total resistance that is one third of the single path.

The path of least resistance is also used to describe certain human behaviors, although with much less specificity than in the strict physical sense.  In these cases, resistance is often used as a [[metaphor]] for personal effort or confrontation; a person taking the path of least resistance avoids these.  In library science and technical writing, information is ideally arranged for users according to the [[principle of least effort]], or the "path of least resistance".  Recursive navigation systems are an example of this.

The path of least resistance applies on a local, not global, reference.  For example, water always flows downhill, regardless of whether briefly flowing uphill will help it gain a lower final altitude (with certain exceptions such as [[superfluid]]s and [[syphon]]s).  In physics, this phenomenon allows the formation of [[potential well]]s, where [[potential energy]] is stored because of a barrier restricting flow to a lower energy state.

After he was awarded the scholarship, Rado and his wife left for the [[United Kingdom|UK]] in 1933. He was appointed Professor of Mathematics at the [[University of Reading]] in 1954 and remained there until he retired in 1971.

==Contributions==
Rado made contributions in [[combinatorics]] and [[graph theory]] including 18 papers with [[Paul Erdős]].

In graph theory, the [[Rado graph]], a countably infinite graph containing all countably infinite graphs as induced subgraphs, is named after Rado. He rediscovered it in 1964 after previous works on the same graph by [[Wilhelm Ackermann]], [[Paul Erdős]], and [[Alfréd Rényi]].

In [[combinatorial set theory]], the [[Erdős–Rado theorem]] extends [[Ramsey's theorem]] to infinite sets. It was published by Erdős and Rado in 1956. [[Rado's theorem (Ramsey theory)|Rado's theorem]] is another Ramsey-theoretic result concerning systems of linear equations, proved by Rado in his thesis. The [[Milner–Rado paradox]], also in set theory, states the existence of a partition of an ordinal into subsets of small order-type; it was published by Rado and E. C. Milner in 1965.

The [[Erdős–Ko–Rado theorem]] can be described either in terms of set systems or [[hypergraph]]s. It gives an upper bound on the number of sets in a family of finite sets, all the same size, that all intersect each other. Rado published it with Erdős and [[Chao Ko]] in 1961, but according to Erdős it was originally formulated in 1938.

The Klarner–Rado Sequence is named after Rado and [[David A. Klarner]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.lib.msu.edu/crcmath/math/math/k/k083.htm Klarner-Rado Sequence] Michigan State University, MSU Librarie&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honours==
In 1972, Rado was awarded the [[Berwick Prizes|Senior Berwick Prize]].

A '''Rubinstein bargaining model''' refers to a class of bargaining games that feature alternating offers through an infinite time horizon. The original proof is due to [[Ariel Rubinstein]] in a 1982 paper.&lt;ref name=Rubinstein1982&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a long time, the solution to this type of game was  a mystery; thus, Rubinstein's solution is one of the most influential findings in [[game theory]].

==Requirements==
A standard Rubinstein bargaining model has the following elements:

* Two players
* Complete information
* Unlimited offers—the game keeps going until one player accepts an offer
* Alternating offers—the first player makes an offer in the first period, if the second player rejects, the game moves to the second period in which the second player makes an offer, if the first rejects, the game moves to the third period, and so forth
* Delays are costly

==Solution==

Consider the typical Rubinstein bargaining game in which two players decide how to divide a pie of size 1. An offer by a player takes the form  ''x'' = (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) with ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 1. Assume the players discount at the geometric rate of ''d'', which can be interpreted as cost of delay or "pie spoiling".  That is, 1 step later, the pie is worth d times what it was, for some d with 0&amp;lt;d&amp;lt;1.

Any ''x'' can be a [[Nash equilibrium]] outcome of this game, resulting from the following strategy profile: Player 1 always proposes ''x'' = (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and only accepts offers ''x{{'}}'' where ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;' ≥ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Player 2 always proposes ''x'' = (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and only accepts offers ''x{{'}}'' where ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;' ≥ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

In the above Nash equilibrium, player 2's threat to reject any offer less than ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is not credible. In the subgame where player 1 did offer ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;' where ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;' &gt; ''d'' ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, clearly player 2's best response is to accept.

To derive a sufficient condition for  [[subgame perfect equilibrium]], let ''x'' = (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and ''y'' = (''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) be two divisions of the pie with the following property:

#''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''d'' ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and
#''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''d'' ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.

Consider the strategy profile where player 1 offers ''x'' and accepts no less than ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and player ''2'' offers ''y'' and accepts no less than ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Player 2 is now indifferent between accepting and rejecting, therefore the threat to reject lesser offers is now credible. Same applies to a subgame in which it is player 1's turn to decide whether to accept or reject. In this subgame perfect equilibrium, player 1 gets 1/(1+''d'') while player 2 gets ''d''/(1+''d''). This subgame perfect equilibrium is essentially unique.

===A Generalization===
When the discount factor is different for the two players, &lt;math&gt;d_1&lt;/math&gt; for the first one and &lt;math&gt;d_2&lt;/math&gt; for the second, let us denote the value for the first player as &lt;math&gt;v(d_1, d_2)&lt;/math&gt;.
Then a reasoning similar to the above gives

&lt;math&gt;1-v(d_1, d_2) = d_2 \times v(d_2, d_1)&lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;1-v(d_2, d_1) = d_1 \times v(d_1, d_2)&lt;/math&gt;

yielding &lt;math&gt; v(d_1, d_2) = \frac{1 - d_2}{1 - d_1 d_2}&lt;/math&gt;. This expression reduces to the original one for &lt;math&gt;d_1 = d_2 = d&lt;/math&gt;.

==Desirability==
Rubinstein bargaining has become pervasive in the literature because it has many desirable qualities:

* It has all the aforementioned requirements, which are thought to accurately simulate real-world bargaining.
* There is a unique solution.
* The solution is pretty clean, which wasn't necessarily expected given the game is infinite.
* There is no delay in the transaction.
* As both players become infinitely patient or can make counteroffers increasingly quickly (i.e. as d approaches 1), then both sides get half of the pie.
* The result quantifies the advantage of being the first to propose (and thus potentially avoiding the discount).
* The generalized result quantifies the advantage of being less pressed for time, i.e. of having a discount factor closer to 1 than that of the other party.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12054">In [[linear algebra]], particularly [[projective geometry]], a '''semilinear map''' between [[vector space]]s ''V'' and ''W'' over a field ''K'' is a function that is a [[linear map]] "up to a twist", hence ''semi''-linear, where "twist" means "[[field automorphism]] of ''K''". Explicitly, it is a function {{nowrap|''T'' : ''V'' → ''W''}} that is:
* [[Additive map|additive]] with respect to vector addition: &lt;math&gt;T(v+v') = T(v)+T(v')&lt;/math&gt;
* there exists a field automorphism &amp;theta; of ''K'' such that &lt;math&gt;T(\lambda v) = \lambda^\theta T(v)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\lambda^\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the image of the scalar &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; under the automorphism. If such an automorphism exists and ''T'' is nonzero, it is unique, and ''T'' is called &amp;theta;-semilinear.

Where the domain and codomain are the same space (i.e. {{nowrap|''T'' : ''V'' → ''V''}}), it may be termed a '''semilinear transformation'''.  The invertible semilinear transforms of a given vector space ''V'' (for all choices of field automorphism) form a group, called the '''general semilinear group''' and denoted &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{\Gamma L}(V),&lt;/math&gt; by analogy with and extending the [[general linear group]].

Similar notation (replacing Latin characters with Greek) are used for semilinear analogs of more restricted linear transform; formally, the [[semidirect product]] of a linear group with the Galois group of field automorphism. For example, PΣU is used for the semilinear analogs of the [[projective special unitary group]] PSU.  Note however, that it is only recently noticed that these generalized semilinear groups are not well-defined, as pointed out in &lt;!-- the review of --&gt;{{harv|Bray|Holt|Roney-Dougal|2009}} – isomorphic classical groups ''G'' and ''H'' (subgroups of SL) may have non-isomorphic semilinear extensions. At the level of semidirect products, this corresponds to different actions of the Galois group on a given abstract group, a semidirect product depending on two groups and an action. If the extension is non-unique, there are exactly two semilinear extensions; for example, symplectic groups have a unique semilinear extension, while {{nowrap|SU(''n'', ''q'')}} has two extensions if ''n'' is even and ''q'' is odd, and likewise for PSU.

== Definition ==
A map {{math|''f'' : ''V'' → ''W''}} for vector spaces {{math|''V''}} and {{math|''W''}} over fields {{math|''K''}} and {{math|''L''}} respectively is {{math|''σ''}}-semilinear, or simply '''semilinear''', if there exists a field homomorphism {{math|''σ'' : ''K'' → ''L''}} such that for all {{math|''x''}}, {{math|''y''}} in {{math|''V''}} and {{math|''λ''}} in {{math|''K''}} it holds that
# &lt;math&gt;f(x+y)=f(x)+f(y),&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;f(\lambda x)=\sigma(\lambda) f(x).&lt;/math&gt;

A given [[Embedding#Field theory|embedding]] {{math|''σ''}} of a field {{math|''K''}} in {{math|''L''}} allows us to identify {{math|''K''}} with a subfield of {{math|''L''}}, making a {{math|''σ''}}-semilinear map a ''K''-[[linear map]] under this identification. However, a map that is {{math|''τ''}}-semilinear for a distinct embedding {{math|''τ'' ≠ ''σ''}} will not be ''K''-linear with respect to the original identification {{math|''σ''}}, unless {{math|''f''}} is identically zero.

More generally, a map {{math|''ψ'' : ''M'' → ''N''}} between a right {{math|''R''}}-[[Module (mathematics)|module]] {{math|''M''}} and a left {{math|''S''}}-module {{math|''N''}} is {{math|''σ''}}-'''semilinear''' if there exists a ring [[antihomomorphism]] {{math|''σ'' : ''R'' → ''S''}} such that for all {{math|''x''}}, {{math|''y''}} in {{math|''M''}} and {{math|''λ''}} in {{math|''R''}} it holds that
# &lt;math&gt;\psi(x + y) = \psi(x) + \psi(y) ,&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\psi(x \lambda) = \sigma(\lambda) \psi(x) .&lt;/math&gt;
The term ''semilinear'' applies for any combination of left and right modules with suitable adjustment of the above expressions, with {{math|''σ''}} being a homomorphism as needed.{{refn|{{citation|author=Ian R. Porteous|year=1995|title=Clifford Algebras and the Classical Groups|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]}}}}{{refn|{{citation|author=Bourbaki|year=1989|title=Algebra I|edition=2nd|publisher=Springer-Verlag|page=223}}}}

The pair {{math|(''ψ'', ''σ'')}} is referred to as a '''dimorphism'''.{{refn|{{citation|author=Bourbaki|year=1989|title=Algebra I|edition=2nd|publisher=Springer-Verlag|page=223}}}}

Let {{math|''σ'' : ''R'' → ''S''}} be a ring isomorphism, {{math|''M''}} a right {{math|''R''}}-module and {{math|''N''}} a right {{math|''S''}}-module, and {{math|''ψ'' : ''M'' → ''N''}} a {{math|''σ''}}-semilinear map.  We define the '''transpose''' of {{math|''ψ''}} as the mapping {{math|&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;''ψ'' : ''N''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; → ''M''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;}} that satisfies{{refn|{{citation|author=Bourbaki|year=1989|title=Algebra I|edition=2nd|publisher=Springer-Verlag|page=236}}}}
:&lt;math&gt; \langle y , \psi ( x ) \rangle = \sigma( \langle {}^\text{t} \psi ( y ) , x \rangle) \quad \forall y \in N^{*}, \forall x \in M.&lt;/math&gt;
This is a {{math|''σ''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}-semilinear map.

===Properties===
Let {{math|''σ'' : ''R'' → ''S''}} be a ring isomorphism, {{math|''M''}} a right {{math|''R''}}-module and {{math|''N''}} a right {{math|''S''}}-module, and {{math|''ψ'' : ''M'' → ''N''}} a {{math|''σ''}}-semilinear map.  The mapping
:&lt;math&gt; M \to R : x \mapsto \sigma ^{-1} ( \langle y , \psi (x) \rangle) , \quad y \in N^{*} &lt;/math&gt;
defines an {{math|''R''}}-linear form.{{refn|{{citation|author=Bourbaki|year=1989|title=Algebra I|edition=2nd|publisher=Springer-Verlag|page=236}}}}

== Examples ==

* Let &lt;math&gt;K=\mathbf{C}, V=\mathbf{C}^n,&lt;/math&gt; with standard basis &lt;math&gt;e_1,\ldots, e_n&lt;/math&gt;. Define the map &lt;math&gt;f\colon V \to V&lt;/math&gt; by
*:&lt;math&gt;f\left(\sum_{i=1}^n z_i e_i \right) = \sum_{i=1}^n \bar z_i e_i&lt;/math&gt; 
:''f'' is semilinear (with respect to the complex conjugation field automorphism) but not linear.
* Let &lt;math&gt;K=\operatorname{GF}(q)&lt;/math&gt; – the Galois field of order &lt;math&gt;q=p^i&lt;/math&gt;, ''p'' the characteristic. Let &lt;math&gt;\ell^\theta = \ell^p&lt;/math&gt;. By the [[Freshman's dream]] it is known that this is a field automorphism. To every linear map &lt;math&gt;f\colon V \to W&lt;/math&gt; between vector spaces ''V'' and ''W'' over ''K'' we can establish a &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;-semilinear map
*:&lt;math&gt;\widetilde{f} \left( \sum_{i=1}^n \ell_i e_i\right) := f \left( \sum_{i=1}^n \ell_i^\theta e_i \right) .&lt;/math&gt;
:Indeed every linear map can be converted into a semilinear map in such a way. This is part of a general observation collected into the following result.
* Let &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; be a noncommutative ring, &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; a left &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-module, and &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; an invertible element of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;.  Define the map &lt;math&gt;\varphi\colon M\to M \colon x \mapsto\alpha x&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;\varphi(\lambda u)=\alpha \lambda u = (\alpha \lambda \alpha^{-1}) \alpha u = \sigma(\lambda) \varphi(u)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is an inner automorphism of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus, the [[Homothetic transformation|homothety]] &lt;math&gt;x\mapsto\alpha x&lt;/math&gt; need not be a linear map, but is &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;-semilinear.{{refn|{{citation|author=Bourbaki|year=1989|title=Algebra I|edition=2nd|publisher=Springer-Verlag|page=223}}}}

== General semilinear group ==
Given a vector space ''V'', the set of all invertible semilinear transformations {{nowrap|''V'' → ''V''}} (over all field automorphisms) is the group ΓL(''V'').

Given a vector space ''V'' over ''K'', ΓL(''V'') decomposes as the [[semidirect product]]
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{\Gamma L}(V) = \operatorname{GL}(V) \rtimes \operatorname{Aut}(K) ,&lt;/math&gt; 
where Aut(''K'') is the automorphisms of ''K''. Similarly, semilinear transforms of other linear groups can be ''defined'' as the semidirect product with the automorphism group, or more intrinsically as the group of semilinear maps of a vector space preserving some properties.

We identify Aut(''K'') with a subgroup of ΓL(''V'') by fixing a basis ''B'' for ''V'' and defining the semilinear maps:
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{b\in B} \ell_b b \mapsto \sum_{b \in B} \ell_b^\sigma b&lt;/math&gt;
for any &lt;math&gt;\sigma \in \operatorname{Aut}(K)&lt;/math&gt;. We shall denoted this subgroup by Aut(''K'')&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt;. We also see these complements to GL(''V'') in ΓL(''V'') are acted on regularly by GL(''V'') as they correspond to a change of basis.

=== Proof ===
Every linear map is semilinear, thus &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{GL}(V) \leq \operatorname{\Gamma L}(V)&lt;/math&gt;. Fix a basis ''B'' of ''V''. Now given any semilinear map ''f'' with respect to a field automorphism {{nowrap|''σ'' ∈ Aut(''K'')}}, then define {{nowrap|''g'' : ''V'' → ''V''}} by
:&lt;math&gt;g \left(\sum_{b \in B} \ell_b b\right)
:= \sum_{b \in B}f \left(l_b^{\sigma^{-1}} b\right)
= \sum_{b \in B} \ell_b f (b)
&lt;/math&gt;
As ''f''(''B'') is also a basis of ''V'', it follows that ''g'' is simply a basis exchange of ''V'' and so linear and invertible: {{nowrap|''g'' ∈ GL(''V'')}}.

Set &lt;math&gt;h:=f g^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. For every &lt;math&gt;v=\sum_{b \in B} \ell_b b&lt;/math&gt; in ''V'',
:&lt;math&gt;hv=fg^{-1}v=\sum_{b \in B} \ell_b^\sigma b&lt;/math&gt; 
thus ''h'' is in the Aut(''K'') subgroup relative to the fixed basis ''B.'' This factorization is unique to the fixed basis ''B''. Furthermore, GL(''V'') is normalized by the action of Aut(''K'')&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt;, so {{nowrap|1=ΓL(''V'') = GL(''V'') ⋊ Aut(''K'')}}.

== Applications ==

=== Projective geometry ===
The &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{\Gamma L}(V)&lt;/math&gt; groups extend the typical [[classical group]]s in GL(''V''). The importance in considering such maps follows from the consideration of [[projective geometry]]. The induced action of &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{\Gamma L}(V)&lt;/math&gt; on the associated vector space P(''V'') yields the '''{{visible anchor|projective semilinear group}}''', denoted &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{P\Gamma L}(V)&lt;/math&gt;, extending the [[projective linear group]], PGL(''V'').

The projective geometry of a vector space ''V'', denoted PG(''V''), is the lattice of all subspaces of ''V''. Although the typical semilinear map is not a linear map, it does follow that every semilinear map &lt;math&gt;f\colon V \to W&lt;/math&gt; induces an order-preserving map &lt;math&gt;f\colon \operatorname{PG}(V) \to \operatorname{PG}(W)&lt;/math&gt;. That is, every semilinear map induces a [[projectivity]]. The converse of this observation (except for the projective line) is the [[fundamental theorem of projective geometry]]. Thus semilinear maps are useful because they define the automorphism group of the projective geometry of a vector space.

=== Mathieu group ===
{{main|Mathieu group}}
The group PΓL(3,4) can be used to construct the Mathieu group M&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;, which is one of the [[sporadic simple group]]s; PΓL(3,4) is a maximal subgroup of M&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;, and there are many ways to extend it to the full Mathieu group.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1585">In [[differential geometry]], the '''slice theorem''' states:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Audin|2004|loc=Theorem I.2.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; given a [[manifold]] ''M'' on which a [[Lie group]] ''G'' [[Lie group action|acts]] as [[diffeomorphism]]s, for any ''x'' in ''M'', the map &lt;math&gt;G/G_x \to M, \, [g] \mapsto g \cdot x&lt;/math&gt; extends to an invariant neighborhood of &lt;math&gt;G/G_x&lt;/math&gt; (viewed as a zero section)  in &lt;math&gt;G \times_{G_x} T_x M / T_x(G \cdot x)&lt;/math&gt; so that it defines an [[equivariant]] diffeomorphism from the neighborhood to its image, which contains the orbit of ''x''.

The important application of the theorem is a proof of the fact that the quotient &lt;math&gt;M/G&lt;/math&gt; admits a manifold structure when ''G'' is compact and the action is free.

In [[algebraic geometry]], there is an analog of the slice theorem; it is called [[Luna's slice theorem]].

== Idea of proof when ''G'' is compact ==
Since ''G'' is compact, there exists an invariant metric; i.e., ''G'' acts as [[isometries]]. One then adopts the usual proof of the existence of a tubular neighborhood using this metric.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2519">In [[mathematics]], '''Spanier&amp;ndash;Whitehead duality''' is a [[duality theory]] in [[homotopy theory]], based on a geometrical idea that a [[topological space]] ''X'' may be considered as dual to its complement in the ''n''-[[sphere]], where ''n'' is large enough. Its origins lie in the [[Alexander duality]] theory, in [[homology theory]], concerning complements in [[manifold]]s. The theory is also referred to as '''''S-duality''''', but this can now cause possible confusion with the [[S-duality]] of [[string theory]]. It is named for [[Edwin Spanier]] and [[J. H. C. Whitehead]], who developed it in papers from 1955.

The basic point is that sphere complements determine the homology, but not the [[homotopy type]], in general. What is determined, however, is the [[stable homotopy type]], which was conceived as a first approximation to homotopy type.  Thus Spanier&amp;ndash;Whitehead duality fits into [[stable homotopy theory]].

== Statement ==
Let ''X'' be a compact [[deformation retract|neighborhood retract]] in &lt;math&gt;\Bbb R^n&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;X^+&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^{-n}\Sigma'(\Bbb R^n \setminus X)&lt;/math&gt; are [[dual object]]s in the category of pointed [[Spectrum (topology)|spectra]] with the smash product as a monoidal structure. Here &lt;math&gt;X^+&lt;/math&gt; is the union of ''X'' and a point, &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Sigma'&lt;/math&gt; are reduced and unreduced [[Suspension (topology)|suspension]]s respectively.

Taking homology and cohomology with respect to an [[Eilenberg-MacLane space|Eilenberg—MacLane spectrum]] recovers [[Alexander duality]] formally.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18200">In [[mathematics]], a '''symplectic manifold''' is a [[Differentiable manifold#Definition|smooth manifold]], ''M'', equipped with a [[Closed and exact differential forms|closed]] [[nondegenerate form|nondegenerate]] differential [[Differential form|2-form]], ''ω'', called the [[symplectic form]]. The study of symplectic manifolds is called [[symplectic geometry]] or [[symplectic topology]]. Symplectic manifolds arise naturally in abstract formulations of [[classical mechanics]] and [[analytical mechanics]] as the [[cotangent bundle]]s of manifolds. For example, in the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian formulation]] of classical mechanics, which provides one of the major motivations for the field, the set of all possible configurations of a system is modeled as a manifold, and this manifold's [[cotangent bundle]] describes the [[phase space]] of the system.

Any real-valued [[differentiable function]], ''H'', on a symplectic manifold can serve as an '''[[energy function]]''' or '''Hamiltonian'''. Associated to any Hamiltonian is a [[Hamiltonian vector field]]; the [[integral curve]]s of the Hamiltonian vector field are solutions to [[Hamilton's equations]]. The Hamiltonian vector field defines a flow on the symplectic manifold, called a '''Hamiltonian flow''' or [[symplectomorphism]]. By [[Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian)|Liouville's theorem]], Hamiltonian flows preserve the [[volume form]] on the phase space.

== Motivation ==

Symplectic manifolds arise from [[classical mechanics]], in particular, they are a generalization of the [[phase space]] of a closed system.&lt;ref name="Webster"&gt;Ben Webster: ''What is a symplectic manifold, really?'' http://sbseminar.wordpress.com/2012/01/09/what-is-a-symplectic-manifold-really/&lt;/ref&gt; In the same way the [[Hamilton equations]] allow one to derive the time evolution of a system from a set of [[differential equation]]s, the symplectic form should allow one to obtain a [[vector field]] describing the flow of the system from the differential ''dH'' of a Hamiltonian function ''H''.&lt;ref name="Cohn"&gt;Henry Cohn: ''Why symplectic geometry is the natural setting for classical mechanics'' http://math.mit.edu/~cohn/Thoughts/symplectic.html&lt;/ref&gt; So we require a linear map {{nowrap|''TM'' → ''T''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;''M''}}, or equivalently, an element of {{nowrap|''T''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;''M'' ⊗ ''T''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;''M''}}. Letting ''ω'' denote a [[Section (fiber bundle)|section]] of {{nowrap|''T''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;''M'' ⊗ ''T''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;''M''}}, the requirement that ''ω'' be [[Degenerate form|non-degenerate]] ensures that for every differential ''dH'' there is a unique corresponding vector field ''V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;'' such that {{nowrap|1=''dH'' = ''ω''(''V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;'', · )}}. Since one desires the Hamiltonian to be constant along flow lines, one should have {{nowrap|1=''dH''(''V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;'') = ''ω''(''V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;'') = 0}}, which implies that ''ω'' is [[Alternating form|alternating]] and hence a 2-form. Finally, one makes the requirement that ''ω'' should not change under flow lines, i.e. that the [[Lie derivative]] of ''ω'' along ''V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;'' vanishes. Applying [[Cartan homotopy formula|Cartan's formula]], this amounts to (here &lt;math&gt; \iota_X&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Interior product|interior product]]): 

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_{V_H}(\omega) = 0\;\Leftrightarrow\;\mathrm d (\iota_{V_H} \omega) + \iota_{V_H} \mathrm d\omega= \mathrm d (\mathrm d\,H) + \mathrm d\omega(V_H) = \mathrm d\omega(V_H)=0&lt;/math&gt;

so that, on repeating this argument for different smooth functions &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; such that the corresponding &lt;math&gt;V_H&lt;/math&gt; span the tangent space at each point the argument is applied at, we see that the requirement for the vanishing Lie derivative along flows of &lt;math&gt;V_H&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to arbitrary smooth &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to the requirement that ''ω'' should be [[Closed and exact differential forms|closed]].

== Definition ==

A symplectic form on a manifold ''M'' is a closed non-degenerate differential [[two-form|2-form]] ''ω''.&lt;ref name="Gosson"&gt;Maurice de Gosson: ''Symplectic Geometry and Quantum Mechanics'' (2006) Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel {{isbn|3-7643-7574-4}}. (page 10)
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Arnold"&gt;{{Cite book|first=V. I.|last=Arnold|first2=A. N.|last2=Varchenko|first3=S. M.|last3=Gusein-Zade|authorlink1=Vladimir Arnold|authorlink3=Sabir Gusein-Zade|authorlink2=Alexander Varchenko|title=The Classification of Critical Points, Caustics and Wave Fronts: Singularities of Differentiable Maps, Vol 1|publisher=Birkhäuser|year=1985|isbn=0-8176-3187-9|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Here, non-degenerate means that for all {{nowrap|1=''p'' &amp;isin; ''M''}}, if there exists an {{nowrap|1=''X'' &amp;isin; ''T&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;M''}} such that {{nowrap|1=''&amp;omega;''(''X'',''Y'') = 0}} for all {{nowrap|1=''Y'' &amp;isin; ''T&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;M''}}, then {{nowrap|1=''X'' = 0}}. The [[Skew-symmetric matrix|skew-symmetric]] condition (inherent in the definition of differential 2-form) means that for all {{nowrap|1=''p'' &amp;isin; ''M''}} we have {{nowrap|1=''&amp;omega;''(''X'',''Y'') = &amp;minus;''&amp;omega;''(''Y'',''X'')}} for all  {{nowrap|1=''X'',''Y'' &amp;isin; ''T&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;M''.}} In odd dimensions, [[Skew-symmetric matrix|antisymmetric]] matrices are not invertible. Since ''ω'' is a differential two-form, the skew-symmetric condition implies that ''M'' has even dimension.&lt;ref name="Gosson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Arnold"/&gt; The closed condition means that the [[exterior derivative]] of ''ω ''vanishes, {{nowrap|1=d''ω'' = 0}}. A symplectic manifold consists of a pair (''M'',''ω''), of a manifold ''M'' and a symplectic form ''ω''. Assigning a symplectic form ''ω'' to a manifold ''M'' is referred to as giving ''M'' a '''symplectic structure'''.

== Linear symplectic manifold ==

There is a standard linear model, namely a [[symplectic vector space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. Let '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2''n''&lt;/sup&gt; have the basis {{nowrap|{''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''v''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}.}} Then we define our symplectic form ''ω'' so that for all {{nowrap|1=1 &amp;le; ''i'' &amp;le; ''n''}} we have {{nowrap|1=''&amp;omega;''(''v''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;,''v''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+''i''&lt;/sub&gt;) = 1}}, {{nowrap|1=''&amp;omega;''(''v''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+''i''&lt;/sub&gt;,''v''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;) = &amp;minus;1}}, and ''ω'' is zero for all other pairs of basis vectors. In this case the symplectic form reduces to a simple [[quadratic form]]. If ''I&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' denotes the {{nowrap|1=''n'' &amp;times; ''n''}} [[identity matrix]] then the matrix, ''Ω'', of this quadratic form is given by the ({{nowrap|1=2''n'' &amp;times; 2''n''}}) [[block matrix]]:

: &lt;math&gt; \Omega = \left(\begin{array}{c|c} 0 &amp; I_n  \\ \hline -I_n &amp; 0 \end{array}\right). &lt;/math&gt;

== Lagrangian and other submanifolds ==

There are several natural geometric notions of [[submanifold]] of a symplectic manifold.
* '''symplectic submanifolds''' (potentially of any even dimension) are submanifolds where the symplectic form is required to induce a symplectic form on them.
* '''isotropic submanifolds''' are submanifolds where the symplectic form restricts to zero, i.e. each tangent space is an isotropic subspace of the ambient manifold's tangent space. Similarly, if each tangent subspace to a submanifold is co-isotropic (the dual of an isotropic subspace), the submanifold is called '''co-isotropic'''.
* '''Lagrangian submanifolds''' of a sympletic manifold &lt;math&gt;(M,\omega)&lt;/math&gt; are submanifolds where the restriction of the symplectic form &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;L\subset M&lt;/math&gt; is vanishing, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\omega|_L=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\text{dim }L=\tfrac{1}{2}\dim M&lt;/math&gt;. Langrangian submanifolds are the maximal isotropic submanifolds.

The most important case of the isotropic submanifolds is that of '''Lagrangian submanifolds'''. A Lagrangian submanifold is, by definition, an isotropic submanifold of maximal dimension, namely half the dimension of the ambient symplectic manifold. One major example is that the graph of a [[symplectomorphism]] in the product symplectic manifold {{nowrap|1=(''M'' &amp;times; ''M'', ''ω'' &amp;times; &amp;minus;''ω'')}} is Lagrangian. Their intersections display rigidity properties not possessed by smooth manifolds; the [[Arnold conjecture]] gives the sum of the submanifold's [[Betti number]]s as a lower bound for the number of self intersections of a smooth Lagrangian submanifold, rather than the [[Euler characteristic]] in the smooth case.

=== Examples ===
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{2n}_{\textbf{x},\textbf{y}}&lt;/math&gt; have global coordinates labelled &lt;math&gt;(x_1,\ldots,x_n,y_1,\ldots,y_n)&lt;/math&gt;. Then, we can equip &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}_{\textbf{x},\textbf{y}}^{2n}&lt;/math&gt; with the canonical symplectic form &lt;math&gt;\omega =\mathrm{d}x_1\wedge \mathrm{d}y_1 + \cdots + \mathrm{d}x_n\wedge \mathrm{d}y_n&lt;/math&gt;. There is a standard Lagrangian submanifold given by &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n_{\mathbf{x}} \to \mathbb{R}^{2n}_{\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}}&lt;/math&gt;. The form &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; vanishes on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n_{\mathbf{x}}&lt;/math&gt; because given any pair of tangent vectors &lt;math&gt;X= f_i(\textbf{x})\partial_{x_i},Y=g_i(\textbf{x})\partial_{x_i}&lt;/math&gt;, we have that &lt;math&gt;\omega(X,Y) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. To elucidate, consider the case &lt;math&gt;n=1&lt;/math&gt;. Then, &lt;math&gt;X = f(x)\partial_x, Y=g(x)\partial_x&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\omega = \mathrm{d}x\wedge \mathrm{d}y&lt;/math&gt;. Notice that when we expand this out
:&lt;math&gt;\omega(X,Y) = \omega(f(x)\partial_x,g(x)\partial_x) = \frac{1}{2}f(x)g(x)(\mathrm{d}x(\partial_x)\mathrm{d}y(\partial_x) - \mathrm{d}y(\partial_x)\mathrm{d}x(\partial_x))&lt;/math&gt;
both terms we have a &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}y(\partial_x)&lt;/math&gt; factor, which is 0, by definition.

The cotangent bundle of a manifold is locally modeled on a space similar to the first example. It can be shown that we can glue these affine symplectic forms hence this bundle forms a symplectic manifold. A more non-trivial example of a Lagrangian submanifold is the zero section of the cotangent bundle of a manifold. For example, let &lt;math&gt;X = \{(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 : y^2 - x = 0\}&lt;/math&gt;. Then, we can present &lt;math&gt;T^*X&lt;/math&gt; as
:&lt;math&gt;T^*X = \{(x,y,\mathrm{d}x,\mathrm{d}y) \in \mathbb{R}^4 : y^2 - x = 0, 2y\mathrm{d}y - \mathrm{d}x = 0\}&lt;/math&gt;
where we are treating the symbols &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}x,\mathrm{d}y&lt;/math&gt; as coordinates of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^4 = T^*\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;. We can consider the subset where the coordinates &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}x=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}y=0&lt;/math&gt;, giving us the zero section. This example can be repeated for any manifold defined by the vanishing locus of smooth functions &lt;math&gt;f_1,\ldots,f_k&lt;/math&gt; and their differentials &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}f_1,\ldots,df_k&lt;/math&gt;.

Another useful class of Lagrangian submanifolds can be found using Morse theory. Given a Morse function &lt;math&gt;f:M\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; and for a small enough &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; one can construct a Lagrangian submanifold given by the vanishing locus &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{V}(\varepsilon\cdot \mathrm{d}f) \subset T^*M&lt;/math&gt;. For a generic morse function we have a Lagrangian intersection given by &lt;math&gt;M \cap \mathbb{V}(\varepsilon\cdot \mathrm{d}f) = \text{Crit}(f)&lt;/math&gt;.

{{See also|symplectic category}}

=== Special Lagrangian submanifolds ===
In the case of [[Kahler manifold]]s (or [[Calabi-Yau manifolds]]) we can make a choice &lt;math&gt;\Omega=\Omega_1+\mathrm{i}\Omega_2&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; as a holomorphic n-form, where &lt;math&gt;\Omega_1&lt;/math&gt; is the real part and &lt;math&gt;\Omega_2&lt;/math&gt; imaginary. A Lagrangian submanifold &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is called '''special''' if in addition to the above Lagrangian condition the restriction &lt;math&gt;\Omega_2&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is vanishing. In other words, the real part &lt;math&gt;\Omega_1&lt;/math&gt; restricted on &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; leads the volume form on &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;. The following examples are known as special Lagrangian submanifolds,
:# complex Lagrangian submanifolds of [[hyperKahler manifold]]s,
:# fixed points of a real structure of Calabi-Yau manifolds.
The [[SYZ conjecture]] has been proved for special Lagrangian submanifolds but in general, it is open, and brings a lot of impacts to the study of [[mirror symmetry (string theory)|mirror symmetry]]. see {{harv|Hitchin|1999}}

== Lagrangian fibration ==

A '''Lagrangian fibration''' of a symplectic manifold ''M'' is a [[fibration]] where all of the [[Fiber bundle#Formal definition|fibres]] are Lagrangian submanifolds. Since ''M'' is even-dimensional we can take local coordinates {{nowrap|1=(''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;hellip;,''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;,''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;hellip;,''q''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;),}} and by [[Darboux's theorem]] the symplectic form ''ω'' can be, at least locally, written as {{nowrap|1=''&amp;omega;'' = &amp;sum; d''p''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;and; d''q''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, where d denotes the [[exterior derivative]] and ∧ denotes the [[exterior product]]. Using this set-up we can locally think of ''M'' as being the [[cotangent bundle]] T&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, and the Lagrangian fibration as the trivial fibration {{nowrap|1=''&amp;pi;'' : T&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; ↠ '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.}} This is the canonical picture.

== Lagrangian mapping ==
[[File:TIKZ PICT FBN.png|thumb|]]
Let ''L'' be a Lagrangian submanifold of a symplectic manifold (''K'',ω) given by an [[Immersion (mathematics)|immersion]] {{nowrap|1=''i'' : ''L'' ↪ ''K''}} (''i'' is called a '''Lagrangian immersion'''). Let {{nowrap|1=''&amp;pi;'' : ''K'' ↠ ''B''}} give a Lagrangian fibration of ''K''. The composite {{nowrap|1=(''&amp;pi;'' ∘ ''i'') : ''L'' ↪ ''K'' ↠ ''B''}} is a '''Lagrangian mapping'''. The [[critical value|critical value set]] of ''π'' ∘ ''i'' is called a [[Caustic (mathematics)|caustic]].

Two Lagrangian maps {{nowrap|1=(''&amp;pi;''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∘ ''i''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) : ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ↪ ''K''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ↠ ''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{nowrap|1=(''&amp;pi;''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∘ ''i''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) : ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ↪ ''K''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ↠ ''B''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} are called '''Lagrangian equivalent''' if there exist [[diffeomorphism]]s ''σ'', ''τ'' and ''ν'' such that both sides of the diagram given on the right [[commutative diagram|commute]], and ''τ'' preserves the symplectic form.&lt;ref name="Arnold"/&gt; Symbolically:
: &lt;math&gt; \tau \circ  i_1 = i_2 \circ \sigma, \ \nu \circ \pi_1 = \pi_2 \circ \tau, \ \tau^*\omega_2 = \omega_1 \, , &lt;/math&gt;
where ''τ''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;''ω''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; denotes the [[Pullback (differential geometry)#Pullback of differential forms|pull back]] of ''ω''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by ''τ''.

== Special cases and generalizations ==
* A symplectic manifold endowed with a [[metric tensor|metric]] that is [[Almost complex manifold#Compatible triples|compatible]] with the symplectic form is an [[almost Kähler manifold]] in the sense that the tangent bundle has an [[almost complex structure]], but this need not be [[integrability condition|integrable]].
* Symplectic manifolds are special cases of a [[Poisson manifold]]. The definition of a symplectic manifold requires that the symplectic form be non-degenerate everywhere, but if this condition is violated, the manifold may still be a Poisson manifold.
* A '''multisymplectic manifold''' of degree ''k'' is a manifold equipped with a closed nondegenerate ''k''-form.&lt;ref&gt;F. Cantrijn, L. A. Ibort and M. de León, J. Austral. Math. Soc. Ser. A 66 (1999), no. 3, 303-330.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A '''polysymplectic manifold''' is a Legendre bundle provided with a polysymplectic tangent-valued &lt;math&gt;(n+2)&lt;/math&gt;-form; it is utilized in Hamiltonian field theory.&lt;ref&gt;G. Giachetta, L. Mangiarotti and [[Sardanashvily|G. Sardanashvily]], Covariant Hamiltonian equations for field theory, Journal of Physics '''A32''' (1999) 6629-6642; [http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/hep-th/9904062 arXiv: hep-th/9904062].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10510">'''System archetypes''' are patterns of behavior of a [[system]]. Systems expressed by [[causal loop diagram|circles of causality]] have therefore similar [[structure]]. Identifying a system [[archetype]] and finding the [[lever]]age enables efficient changes in a system. The basic system archetypes and possible solutions of the problems are mentioned in the section ''[[#Examples of system archetypes|Examples of system archetypes]]''.&lt;ref name="ps"&gt;{{Citation| last=Senge | first=Peter M. | year=1990 | title=The Fifth Discipline | publisher=Doubleday/Currency | isbn=0-385-26094-6 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bVZqAAAAMAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt; A fundamental property of nature is that no cause can affect the past. System archetypes do not imply that current causes affect past effects.

== Circles of causality ==

The basic idea of [[system thinking]] is that every action triggers a reaction. In [[system dynamics]] this reaction is called [[feedback]]. There are two types of feedback – [[positive feedback|reinforcing feedback]] and [[negative feedback|balancing feedback]]. Sometimes a feedback (or a reaction) does not occur immediately – the process contains delays. Any system can be drawn as a [[diagram]] set up with circles of [[causality]] – including actions, feedbacks and delays.&lt;ref name="ps" /&gt;

== Reinforcing feedback (+) ==

[[positive feedback|Reinforcing feedback]] (or amplifying feedback) accelerates the given trend of a process. If the trend is ascending, the reinforcing (positive) feedback will accelerate the growth. If the trend is descending, it will accelerate the decline. Falling of an avalanche is an example of the reinforcing feedback process.&lt;ref name="ps" /&gt;

== Balancing feedback (−) ==

[[negative feedback|Balancing feedback]] (or stabilizing feedback) will work if any [[goal-state]] exists. Balancing process intends to reduce a gap between a current state and a desired state. The balancing (negative) feedback adjusts a present state to a desirable target regardless whether the trend is descending or ascending. An example of the balancing feedback process is staying upright on bicycle (when riding).&lt;ref name="ps" /&gt;

== Delays ==

Delays in systems cause people to perceive a response to an action incorrectly. This causes an under- or overestimation of the needed action and results in [[oscillation]], instability or even breakdown.&lt;ref name="ps" /&gt;

== Examples of system archetypes ==

The following System Archetyes describe the most common generic structures. Before effectively addressing a specific situation, the underlying pattern must be identified. The following Flow Diagram should help identifying these archetypes. The links between the different archetypes are an indicator of most common connections. Keep in mind that in every situation, there may be more possible ways to follow, though. Consider that everyone is located somewhere in the flow, and that every possible situation has its own advantages, down-sides, cave-ats, and options. Nevertheless, correctly identifying and understanding your situation is always the first step of solving your problem in a sustainable way.

=== Balancing process with delay ===

This archetype explains the system in which the response to action is delayed. If the agents do not perceive the delayed feedback, they might overshoot or underestimate the requisite action in order to reach their goals. This could be avoided by being patient or by accelerating reactions of the system to realized measures.
Example: [[supply chain]] ([[Beer distribution game|The Beer Game]])&lt;ref name="ps" /&gt;
[[File:Balancing process with delay.PNG|none|framed|'''Causal loop diagram "Balancing process with delay"''']]

=== Limits to growth ===

The unprecedented growth is produced by a reinforcing feedback process until the system reaches its peak. The halt of this growth is caused by limits inside or outside of the system. However, if the limits are not properly recognized; the former methods are continuously applied, but more and more aggressively. This results in the contrary of the desired state – a decrease of the system. The solution lies in the weakening or elimination of the cause of limitation.  
Example: [[dieting]], learning foreign languages&lt;ref name="ps" /&gt; 
[[File:Limits to growth.PNG|none|framed|'''Causal loop diagram "Limits to growth"''']]
[[Attractiveness principle|Attractiveness Principle]] is an archetype derived from Limits to Growth. The main difference is that Attractiveness Principle assumes growth is limited with two or more factors.

=== Shifting the burden ===

The problem is handled by a simple solution with immediate effect, thereby "healing the symptoms". The primary source of the problem is overlooked, because its remedy is demanding and has no immediate outcome. The origin of the problem should be identified and solved in the long-term run during which the [[Substance dependence|addiction]] to the [[symptomatic treatment|symptomatic remedy]] decreases. 
Example: [[drug addiction]], paying debts by borrowing&lt;ref name="ps" /&gt;
[[File:Shifting the burden.PNG|none|framed|'''Causal loop diagram "Shifting the burden"''']]

=== Shifting the burden to the intervenor ===

A special case of the “Shifting the Burden” systems archetype that occurs when an intervenor is brought in to help solve an ongoing problem.  Over time, as the intervenor successfully handles the problem, the people within the system become less capable of solving the problem themselves.  They become even more dependent on the intervenor.  Examples:  ongoing use of outside consultants.

In simple terms, this is an archetype whereby a system grows increasingly dependent on an outside intervenor to help it function. In the short-term this works, but in the long term the system is unable to function on its  own due to the dependence on the intervention and eventually fails to perform.

[[File:Shifting the burden to the Intervenor.png|alt=|none|frame|'''Causal loop diagram "Shifting the burden to the intervenor"'''|387x387px]]

=== Eroding goals ===

A kind of shifting the burden archetype. As current problems need to be handled immediately, the long-term goals continuously decline. It can be avoided by sticking to the vision. 
Example: balancing the [[public debt]], sliding limits of [[environmental pollution]]&lt;ref name="ps" /&gt;
[[File:Eroding goals.PNG|none|framed|'''Causal loop diagram "Eroding goals"''']]

=== [[Escalation archetype|Escalation]] ===

This archetype could be seen as a [[non-cooperative game]] where both players suppose that just one of them can win. They are responding to actions of the other player in order to “defend themselves”. The aggression grows and can result in [[self-destructive behavior]]. The [[Virtuous circle and vicious circle|vicious circle]] can be broken by one agent stopping to react defensively and turn the game into cooperative one. 
Example: [[arms race]]&lt;ref name="ps" /&gt;
[[File:Escalation.PNG|none|framed|'''Causal loop diagram "Escalation"''']]

=== Success to successful ===

Two people or activities need the same limited resources. As one of them becomes more successful, more resources are assigned to him/it. The second one becomes less and less successful due to lacking resources, and “prove the right decision” to support the first one. Problems occur if the [[competition]] is unhealthy and interferes with the goals of the whole system. The two activities or agents might be decoupled or they should receive balanced amount of resources.
Examples: two products of one company, work vs. family&lt;ref name="ps" /&gt;
[[File:Success to the successful.PNG|none|framed|'''Causal loop diagram "Success to the successful"''']]

=== [[Tragedy of the commons]] ===

Agents use common [[scarcity|limited resource]] to profit individually. As the use of the resource is not controlled, the agents would like to continuously raise their [[Economics|benefits]]. The resource is therefore used more and more and the [[revenues]] of the agents are decreasing. The agents are intensifying their [[Exploitation of natural resources|exploitation]] until the resource is completely used up or seriously damaged. To protect common resources some form of [[regulation]] should be introduced.
Example: [[fish stocks]] (The Fishing Game)&lt;ref name="ps" /&gt;
[[File:Tragedy of the commons.PNG|none|framed|'''Causal loop diagram "Tragedy of the commons"''']]

=== Fixes that fail ===

In the [[fixes that fail]] archetype, the problem is solved by some fix (a specific [[solution]]) with immediate positive effect. Nonetheless, the “[[unintended consequence|side effects]]” of this solution turn out in the future. The best remedy seems to apply the same solution. 
Example: [[saving costs]] on [[Maintenance, repair and operations|maintenance]], paying [[interest]] by other [[loans]] (with other interests)&lt;ref name="ps" /&gt;
[[File:Fixes that fail.PNG|none|framed|'''Causal loop diagram "Fixes that fail"''']]

=== [[Growth and underinvestment]] ===

The limit to growth is the current [[production capacity]]. It can be removed by sufficient [[investment]] in new capacities. If the investment is not aggressive enough (or it is too low), the capacities are overloaded, the [[Quality (business)|quality]] of services declines and the [[demand]] decreases. This archetype is especially important in capacity planning. &lt;ref name=SDACP&gt;{{cite journal|last=Spicar|first=Radim|title=System Dynamics Archetypes in Capacity Planning|journal=Procedia Engineering|date=4.3.2014|volume=69|issue=C|pages=1350–1355|doi=10.1016/j.proeng.2014.03.128|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877705814003749|accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Drunkard's Walk: How Randomness Rules Our Lives''''' is a 2008 popular science book by American physicist and author [[Leonard Mlodinow]], which became a ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' bestseller and a ''New York Times'' notable book.&lt;ref name="mlodinow"/&gt; 

==Overview==
''The Drunkard's Walk'' discusses the role of randomness in everyday events, and the [[cognitive bias]]es that lead people to misinterpret random events and [[stochastic]] processes. The title refers to a certain type of [[random walk]], a mathematical process in which one or more variables change value under a series of random steps. Mlodinow discusses the contributions of mathematical heavyweights [[Jacob Bernoulli]], [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]], and [[Blaise Pascal]], and introduces basic statistical concepts such as [[regression toward the mean]] and the [[law of large numbers]], while discussing the role of probability in examples from wine ratings and school grades to political polls.&lt;ref name="mlodinow"&gt;{{cite book | last = Mlodinow | first = Leonard | authorlink = Leonard Mlodinow | title = The Drunkard's Walk: How Randomness Rules Our Lives | publisher = Vintage Books | date = May 2009 | location = Toronto | pages = 252 | isbn = 978-0-307-27517-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
In 2008 the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] (CSICOP) awarded Mlodinow the Robert P. Balles Prize for Critical Thinking for the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Karr|first1=Barry|authorlink=Barry Karr|title=CSI’s Balles Prize Goes to Physicist/Author Leonard Mlodinow|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/csis_balles_prize_goes_to_physicist_author_leonard_mlodinow|website=Skeptical Inquirer|publisher=CSICOP|accessdate=18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12901">In [[mathematics]], '''trigonometric interpolation''' is [[interpolation]] with [[trigonometric polynomial]]s. Interpolation is the process of finding a function which goes through some given [[data points]]. For trigonometric interpolation, this function has to be a trigonometric polynomial, that is, a sum of [[trigonometric function|sines and cosines]] of given periods. This form is especially suited for interpolation of [[periodic function]]s.

An important special case is when the given data points are equally spaced, in which case the solution is given by the [[discrete Fourier transform]].

==Formulation of the interpolation problem==

A trigonometric polynomial of degree ''K'' has the form
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; p(x) = a_0 + \sum_{k=1}^K a_k \cos(kx) + \sum_{k=1}^K b_k \sin(kx). \,  &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}
This expression contains 2''K'' + 1 coefficients, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, … ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''K''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''K''&lt;/sub&gt;, and we wish to compute those coefficients so that the function passes through ''N'' points:
:&lt;math&gt; p(x_n) = y_n, \quad n=0,\ldots ,N-1. \, &lt;/math&gt;
Since the trigonometric polynomial is periodic with period 2π, the ''N'' points can be distributed and ordered in one period as 
:&lt;math&gt; 0 \leq x_0 &lt; x_1 &lt; x_2 &lt; \ldots  &lt; x_{N-1} &lt; 2  \pi. \, &lt;/math&gt;
(Note that we do ''not'' in general require these points to be equally spaced.) The interpolation problem is now to find coefficients such that the trigonometric polynomial ''p'' satisfies the interpolation conditions.

==Formulation in the complex plane==

The problem becomes more natural if we formulate it in the [[complex plane]]. We can rewrite the formula for a trigonometric polynomial as
&lt;math&gt; p(x) = \sum_{k=-K}^K c_k e^{ikx}, \, &lt;/math&gt;
where ''i'' is the [[imaginary unit]]. If we set ''z'' = ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''ix''&lt;/sup&gt;, then this becomes
:&lt;math&gt; q(z) = \sum_{k=-K}^K c_k z^{k}, \, &lt;/math&gt;
with
:&lt;math&gt; q(e^{ix}) \triangleq p(x). \, &lt;/math&gt;
This reduces the problem of trigonometric interpolation to that of polynomial interpolation on the [[unit circle]]. Existence and uniqueness for trigonometric interpolation now follows immediately from the corresponding results for polynomial interpolation.

For more information on formulation of trigonometric interpolating polynomials in the complex plane see [http://www.physics.arizona.edu/~restrepo/475A/Notes/sourcea.pdf , p135  Interpolation using Fourier Polynomials].

==Solution of the problem==

Under the above conditions, there exists a solution to the problem for ''any'' given set of data points {''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;} as long as ''N'', the number of data points, is not larger than the number of coefficients in the polynomial, i.e., ''N''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;2''K''+1  (a solution may or may not exist if ''N''&gt;2''K''+1 depending upon the particular set of data points). Moreover, the  interpolating polynomial is unique if and only if the number of adjustable coefficients is equal to the number of data points, i.e., ''N''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2''K''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1. In the remainder of this article, we will assume this condition to hold true.

===Odd number of points===
If the number of points ''N'' is odd, say ''N=2K+1'', applying the [[Lagrange polynomial|Lagrange formula for polynomial interpolation]] to the polynomial formulation in the complex plane yields that the solution can be written in the form
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; p(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{2K} y_k\,t_k(x),&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|5}}}}
where
:&lt;math&gt; t_k(x) = e^{-iKx+iKx_k} \prod_{m=0,m\ne k}^{2K} \frac{e^{ix}-e^{ix_m}}{e^{ix_k}-e^{ix_m}}.&lt;/math&gt;
The factor  &lt;math&gt;e^{-iKx+iKx_k}&lt;/math&gt; in this formula compensates for the fact that the complex plane formulation contains also negative powers of &lt;math&gt;e^{ix}&lt;/math&gt; and is therefore not a polynomial expression in &lt;math&gt;e^{ix}&lt;/math&gt;. The correctness of this expression can easily be verified by observing that &lt;math&gt;t_k(x_k)=1&lt;/math&gt; and that &lt;math&gt;t_k(x)&lt;/math&gt; is a linear combination of the right powers of &lt;math&gt;e^{ix}&lt;/math&gt;.
Upon using the identity
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;e^{iz_1}-e^{iz_2}=2i\sin\left(\frac{z_1-z_2}{2}\right)e^{i\frac12 z_1+i\frac12 z_2},&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}
the coefficient &lt;math&gt;t_k(x)&lt;/math&gt; can be written in the form
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; t_k(x) = \prod_{m=0,m\ne k}^{2K} \frac{\sin\frac12(x-x_m)}{\sin\frac12(x_k-x_m)}.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|4}}}}

===Even number of points===
If the number of points ''N'' is even, say ''N=2K'', applying the [[Lagrange polynomial|Lagrange formula for polynomial interpolation]] to the polynomial formulation in the complex plane yields that the solution can be written in the form
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; p(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{2K-1} y_k\,t_k(x),&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|6}}}}
where
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; t_k(x) = e^{-iKx+iKx_k} \frac{e^{ix}-e^{i\alpha_k}}{e^{ix_k}-e^{i\alpha_k}} \prod_{m=0,m\ne k}^{2K-1} \frac{e^{ix}-e^{ix_m}}{e^{ix_k}-e^{ix_m}}.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3}}}}
Here, the constants &lt;math&gt;\alpha_k&lt;/math&gt; can be chosen freely. This is caused by the fact that the interpolating function ({{EquationNote|1}}) contains an odd number of unknown constants. A common choice is to require that the highest frequency is of the form a constant times &lt;math&gt;\cos(Kx)&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. the &lt;math&gt;\sin(Kx)&lt;/math&gt; term vanishes, but in general the phase of the highest frequency can be chosen to be &lt;math&gt;\varphi_K&lt;/math&gt;. To get an expression for &lt;math&gt;\alpha_k&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain by using ({{EquationNote|2}}) that ({{EquationNote|3}}) can we written in the form
:&lt;math&gt; t_k(x) = \frac{\cos\left(Kx-\frac12\alpha_k+\frac12\sum\limits_{m=0,m\ne k}^{2K-1} x_m\right)+\sum\limits_{m=-(K-1)}^{K-1}c_k e^{imx}}{2^N\sin(\frac{x_k-\alpha_k}{2})\prod\limits_{m=0,m\ne k}^{2K-1}\sin(\frac{x_k-x_m}{2})}.&lt;/math&gt;
This yields
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha_k=\sum_{m=0,m\ne k}^{2K-1} x_m - 2 \varphi_K&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt; t_k(x) = \frac{\sin\frac12(x-\alpha_k)}{\sin\frac12(x_k-\alpha_k)}\prod_{m=0,m\ne k}^{2K-1} \frac{\sin\frac12(x-x_m)}{\sin\frac12(x_k-x_m)}.&lt;/math&gt;

Note that care must be taken in order to avoid infinities caused by zeros in the denominators.

==Equidistant nodes==
Further simplification of the problem is possible if nodes &lt;math&gt;x_m&lt;/math&gt; are equidistant, i.e.
:&lt;math&gt;x_m=\frac{2\pi m}{N},&lt;/math&gt;
see Zygmund for more details.

===Odd number of points===
Further simplification by using ({{EquationNote|4}}) would be an obvious approach, but is obviously involved. A much simpler approach is to consider the [[Dirichlet kernel]]
:&lt;math&gt;D(x,N)=\frac{1}{N} +\frac{2}{N} \sum_{k=1}^{\frac12 (N-1)}\cos(kx) = \frac{\sin\frac12 Nx}{N\sin\frac12 x},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;N&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; is odd. It can easily be seen that &lt;math&gt;D(x,N)&lt;/math&gt; is a linear combination of the right powers of &lt;math&gt;e^{ix}&lt;/math&gt; and satisfies
:&lt;math&gt;D(x_m,N)=\begin{cases}0\text{ for } m\neq0 \\1\text{ for } m=0\end{cases}.&lt;/math&gt;
Since these two properties uniquely define the coefficients &lt;math&gt;t_k(x)&lt;/math&gt; in ({{EquationNote|5}}), it follows that
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
t_k(x) &amp;= D(x-x_k,N)=\begin{cases}
\frac{\sin\frac12 N(x-x_k)}{N\sin\frac12 (x-x_k)} \text{ for } x\neq x_k\\
\lim\limits_{x\to 0} \frac{\sin\frac12 Nx}{N\sin\frac12 x}=1 \text{ for } x= x_k
\end{cases}\\&amp;= \frac{\mathrm{sinc}\,\frac12 N(x-x_k)}{\mathrm{sinc}\,\frac12 (x-x_k)}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
Here, the [[sinc]]-function prevents any singularities and is defined by
:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{sinc}\,x=\frac{\sin x}{x}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Even number of points===
For &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; even, we define the Dirichlet kernel as
:&lt;math&gt;D(x,N)=\frac{1}{N} +\frac{1}{N}\cos \frac12 Nx + \frac{2}{N} \sum_{k=1}^{\frac12 N-1}\cos(kx) = \frac{\sin\frac12 Nx}{N\tan\frac12 x}.&lt;/math&gt;
Again, it can easily be seen that &lt;math&gt;D(x,N)&lt;/math&gt; is a linear combination of the right powers of &lt;math&gt;e^{ix}&lt;/math&gt;, does not contain the term &lt;math&gt; \sin \frac12 Nx &lt;/math&gt; and satisfies
:&lt;math&gt;D(x_m,N)=\begin{cases}0\text{ for } m\neq0 \\1\text{ for } m=0\end{cases}.&lt;/math&gt;
Using these properties, it follows that the coefficients &lt;math&gt;t_k(x)&lt;/math&gt; in ({{EquationNote|6}}) are given by
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
t_k(x) &amp;= D(x-x_k,N)=\begin{cases}
\frac{\sin\frac12 N(x-x_k)}{N\tan\frac12 (x-x_k)}\text{ for } x\neq x_k\\
\lim\limits_{x\to 0} \frac{\sin\frac12 Nx}{N\tan\frac12 x}=1 \text{ for } x= x_k.
\end{cases}\\&amp;= \frac{\mathrm{sinc}\,\frac12 N(x-x_k)}{N \mathrm{sinc}\,\frac12 (x-x_k)}\cos\frac12 (x-x_k)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
Note that &lt;math&gt;t_k(x)&lt;/math&gt; does not contain the &lt;math&gt; \sin \frac12 Nx &lt;/math&gt; as well. Finally, note that the function &lt;math&gt; \sin \frac12 Nx &lt;/math&gt; vanishes at all the points &lt;math&gt;x_m&lt;/math&gt;. Multiples of this term can, therefore, always be added, but it is commonly left out.

===Implementation===

A MATLAB implementation of the above can be found [http://www.math.udel.edu/~braun/M428/Matlab/interpolation/triginterp.m here] and is given by:
&lt;source lang="matlab"&gt;
function P = triginterp(xi,x,y)
% TRIGINTERP Trigonometric interpolation.
% Input:
%   xi  evaluation points for the interpolant (vector)
%   x   equispaced interpolation nodes (vector, length N)
%   y   interpolation values (vector, length N)
% Output:
%   P   values of the trigonometric interpolant (vector)
N = length(x);
% Adjust the spacing of the given independent variable.
h = 2/N;
scale = (x(2)-x(1)) / h;
x = x/scale;  xi = xi/scale;
% Evaluate interpolant.
P = zeros(size(xi));
for k = 1:N
  P = P + y(k)*trigcardinal(xi-x(k),N);
end

function tau = trigcardinal(x,N)
ws = warning('off','MATLAB:divideByZero');
% Form is different for even and odd N.
if rem(N,2)==1   % odd
  tau = sin(N*pi*x/2) ./ (N*sin(pi*x/2));
else             % even
  tau = sin(N*pi*x/2) ./ (N*tan(pi*x/2));
end
warning(ws)
tau(x==0) = 1;     % fix value at x=0
&lt;/source&gt;

===Relation with the discrete Fourier transform===

The special case in which the points ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are equally spaced is especially important. In this case, we have
:&lt;math&gt; x_n = 2 \pi \frac{n}{N}, \qquad 0 \leq n &lt; N.&lt;/math&gt;

The transformation that maps the data points ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; to the coefficients ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is obtained from the [[discrete Fourier transform]] (DFT) of order&amp;nbsp;N.

:&lt;math&gt; Y_k = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} y_n \ e^{-i 2 \pi \frac{nk}{N}} \, &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; y_n = p(x_n) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} Y_k \ e^{i 2 \pi \frac{nk}{N}} \, &lt;/math&gt;

(Because of the way the problem was formulated above, we have restricted ourselves to odd numbers of points.  This is not strictly necessary; for even numbers of points, one includes another cosine term corresponding to the [[Nyquist frequency]].)

The case of the cosine-only interpolation for equally spaced points, corresponding to a trigonometric interpolation when the points have [[Even and odd functions|even symmetry]], was treated by [[Alexis Clairaut]] in 1754.  In this case the solution is equivalent to a [[discrete cosine transform]].  The sine-only expansion for equally spaced points, corresponding to odd symmetry, was solved by [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]] in 1762, for which the solution is a [[discrete sine transform]].  The full cosine and sine interpolating polynomial, which gives rise to the DFT, was solved by [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] in unpublished work around 1805, at which point he also derived a [[Cooley–Tukey FFT algorithm|fast Fourier transform]] algorithm to evaluate it rapidly. Clairaut, Lagrange, and Gauss were all concerned with studying the problem of inferring the [[orbit]] of [[planet]]s, [[asteroid]]s, etc., from a finite set of observation points; since the orbits are periodic, a trigonometric interpolation was a natural choice.  See also Heideman ''et al.'' (1984).

==Applications in numerical computing==

[[Chebfun]], a fully integrated software system written in MATLAB for computing with functions, uses trigonometric interpolation and Fourier expansions for computing with periodic functions. Many algorithms related to trigonometric interpolation are readily available in [[Chebfun]]; several examples are available [http://www.chebfun.org/docs/guide/guide11.html here].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2807">The '''Tversky index''', named after [[Amos Tversky]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tversky |first=Amos |title=Features of Similarity |journal=Psychological Review |volume=84 |number=4 |year=1977 |pages=327–352 |url=http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/~coulson/203/tversky-features.pdf |doi=10.1037/0033-295x.84.4.327}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an asymmetric [[similarity measure]] on [[set theory|sets]] that compares a variant to a prototype. The Tversky index can be seen as a generalization of [[Dice's coefficient]] and [[Tanimoto coefficient]] (aka [[Jaccard index]]).

For sets ''X'' and ''Y'' the Tversky index is a number between 0 and 1 given by

&lt;math&gt;S(X, Y) = \frac{| X \cap Y |}{| X \cap Y | + \alpha | X - Y | + \beta | Y - X |} &lt;/math&gt;,

Here, &lt;math&gt;X - Y&lt;/math&gt; denotes the  [[Complement (set theory)|relative complement]] of Y in X.

Further, &lt;math&gt;\alpha, \beta \ge 0 &lt;/math&gt; are parameters of the Tversky index.  Setting &lt;math&gt;\alpha = \beta = 1 &lt;/math&gt; produces the Tanimoto coefficient; setting &lt;math&gt;\alpha = \beta = 0.5 &lt;/math&gt; produces Dice's coefficient.

If we consider ''X'' to be the prototype and ''Y'' to be the variant, then &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the weight of the prototype and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the weight of the variant. Tversky measures with &lt;math&gt;\alpha + \beta = 1&lt;/math&gt; are of special interest.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.daylight.com/dayhtml/doc/theory/theory.finger.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the inherent asymmetry, the Tversky index does not meet the criteria for a similarity metric. However, if symmetry is needed a variant of the original formulation has been proposed using '''max''' and '''min''' functions &lt;ref&gt;Jimenez, S., Becerra, C., Gelbukh, A. [http://aclweb.org/anthology/S/S13/S13-1028.pdf SOFTCARDINALITY-CORE: Improving Text Overlap with Distributional Measures for Semantic Textual Similarity]. Second Joint Conference on Lexical and Computational Semantics (*SEM), Volume 1: Proceedings of the Main Conference and the Shared Task: Semantic Textual Similarity, p.194-201, June 7–8, 2013, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;
.

&lt;math&gt;S(X,Y)=\frac{| X \cap Y |}{| X \cap Y |+\beta\left(\alpha a+(1-\alpha)b\right)}&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;math&gt;a=\min\left(|X-Y|,|Y-X|\right) &lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;math&gt;b=\max\left(|X-Y|,|Y-X|\right) &lt;/math&gt;,

This formulation also re-arranges parameters &lt;math&gt;\alpha &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta &lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt; \alpha &lt;/math&gt; controls the balance between &lt;math&gt; |X - Y| &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; |Y - X| &lt;/math&gt; in the denominator. Similarly, &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; controls the effect of the symmetric difference &lt;math&gt; |X\,\triangle\,Y\,| &lt;/math&gt; versus &lt;math&gt; | X \cap Y | &lt;/math&gt; in the denominator.

The '''Waterloo Institute for Nanotechnology''' (WIN) is located at the [[University of Waterloo]] and is co-located with the [[Institute for Quantum Computing]] in the [[Mike &amp; Ophelia Lazaridis Quantum-Nano Centre|Mike and Ophelia Lazaridis Quantum-Nano Centre (QNC)]]. WIN is headed by Dr. Sushanta Mitra.

The Waterloo Institute for Nanotechnology comprises 84 faculty from nine different departments in the faculties of Science, Engineering, and Math.

==Major research facilities==
The Quantum-Nano centre is the site of a community laboratory for nano-metrology and nano-fabrication. Construction began on 9 June 2008 and is expected to be completed 21 September 2012. The 160 million dollar, {{convert|284000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} facility will be the home to a  {{convert|17000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} laboratory.

===Funding===
Capital funding for construction of the QNC was made possible by major gifts and awards from multiple sources including a 101 million dollar donation from Ophelia and [[Mike Lazaridis]] (co-CEO of [[Research in Motion]] and Chancellor of the University of Waterloo). Government funding includes 17.9 million dollars from the [[Canada Foundation for Innovation]] (CFI) which has been matched by the Province of Ontario.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;University of Waterloo Quantum-Nano Fact Sheet&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, an anonymous donor has provided an endowment of 29 million dollars for 3 endowed chairs and 42 Graduate Nanofellowships.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Laboratories===

==Research interests==

=== Nano-engineered materials===
Research in nano-engineered materials includes many departments and Faculties at Waterloo. Researchers in chemistry, [[chemical engineering]], [[mechanical and mechatronics engineering]], and [[electrical and computer engineering]] are collaborating on modeling, design, fabrication, processing, characterization and analysis of nano-scale properties of materials, structures, devices and systems. This development will be further driven by the need to address a critical issue also faced in the integration of nano-scale devices: the interface between nano-structured materials and the macroscopic world.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

====Nano-engineered materials projects====
*Development and characterization of ferromagnetic iron-particles as drug delivery vehicles.  These particles act like tiny magnets, and can be directed to specific areas of the body by an external magnetic field. These magnetic nanoparticles can also be used to purify enzymes, proteins and to remove organic contaminants from waste water systems.
*The design, synthesis, characterization, application and fundamental studies of new crystalline metal oxide nano-materials that may be used for next-generation [[rechargeable batteries]].

===Nano-electronics design and fabrication===
Developing techniques to integrate [[Nanoelectromechanical systems|NEMS]]/[[CMOS]] (nano electro mechanical systems/complementary metal oxide semiconductor) to develop manipulators with atomic precision in all three dimensions with on-chip control. Example applications include: [[scanning probe microscopy]], [[atomic force microscopy]], nano-materials characterization and [[atomic resolution imaging]] with the objective of developing technologies for precision nano-scale assembly and manufacturing.

====Nano-fabrication projects====
*Fundamental and applied research into flexible, transparent electronics; that is, electronics embedded on a mechanically flexible substrate such as plastic, rather than on traditional and brittle ones such as silicon.
*Experimentation in [[electron beam lithography]], to fabricate nanostructures and nanoelectronic devices, and to determine how the arrangement of molecules affects the chemical properties of substances.
*Fundamental studies and development of nanocrystalline thin-film semiconductors, devices and circuits for electronics and spintronics.
*Development and fabrication of micro- and nano-electro mechanical systems (MEMS/NEMS). New devices being researched include NEMS-based [[metamaterials]], miniature signal processing devices, biomedical, diagnostic and image processing devices, tiny wireless components (filters, mixers, antennas), miniature opto-electromechanical devices (optical relays, optical multiplexers, deformable optics), miniature biosensors and environmental sensors, and micro- and nano-fluidics devices.

===Nano-instrumentation===
Techniques to fabricate new instrumentation to characterize critical parameters such as size, composition, stiffness, surface characteristics, dopant concentration, [[magnetic coercivity]], and other properties of particular interest to the nano scale. Due to their small size, nano-systems are extremely challenging to assemble, and yet precise control of their parameters is often critical to their performance. A related goal is to cause a paradigm shift in classical chemical measurements (in which samples are brought to the lab for analysis) by developing wireless, energy-efficient mobile nano-instruments that allow users to bring the lab to the sample. Examples of "the lab" include nano-instruments of all types and two examples of "the sample" include the environment or a patient. The metrology arm of the new labs will be used to study measurements at the nano-scale, to develop new and unique nano-scale measuring instruments, and to calibrate such instruments. It will also address associated challenges involved in fabricating, integrating and packaging instruments at the nano-scale.

====Nano-scale metrology projects====
*Fundamental studies leading to development of theories behind measurements at the nanoscale.
*Fabrication of instrumentation and development of methodology for micro- and nano-analytical chemistry for measurements of pollutants on site.

===Nano–biosystems===
Nano–bio is a field that includes both the use of nanotechnology in biological and agrifood systems and use of biological or biomimetic techniques in nanotechnology. Nanobiotechnology shows a tremendous promise of improving the quality of life. For example, nanovehicles might deliver drugs directly to targeted cells, nanomembranes may be used for development of cheap, effective water purification systems, or nanochips that interface neurons with electronics may become common place. NEMS (nano-electromechanical systems) might use sensors and physical controls to stabilize individuals with heart, kidney or liver disease. As nanotechnology researchers strive to create self-assembling devices, they are beginning to exploit natural self-assemblers: proteins, DNA and viruses. Examples also include development of food quality monitoring sensors and microfluidic biosensor components.Nanoscale imaging of biological systems helps to understand the nanoscale structure–function relationship of materials and in evaluating the food quality–function information. Characterization of nanoscale fragments of biomaterials such as DNA, proteins, chromosomes, plant cells, bacteria, starch granules and anti-allergens are extremely important.

====Nano–bio projects====
*[[Lab-on-a-chip]] applications, such as DNA chips and pharmacy-on-a-chip.
*Creation of nano-vehicles that mimic the way viruses interact with specific cells. This will facilitate the [[Targeted drug delivery|delivery of drugs directly to targeted cells]], and could, for instance, eliminate the toxic side-effects of [[chemotherapy]] by directing the therapeutic agents to cancer cells only.
*Development of nanotech methods for therapeutic applications, for example, for replacing faulty DNA or RNA strands with corrected strands.
*Fundamental and applied research into how certain peptides self-assemble into nano-structures, which will increase understanding of certain neurological diseases, and may subsequently lead to novel treatment methods.
*Development of polymeric nanostructures from self-assembly block copolymers for delivery of drugs, proteins and DNA.
*Application of nanotech research into flexible electronics to create low-dose, portable, "wrap-around" x-ray machines.
*Development of nanotechniques for inactivation of [[microbes]]: an efficient and cheap method of food sterilization.
*Creation of "nanowires" based on a chain-link arrangement of [[ferritin]] structures.
*Interfacing [[nanochips]] to [[biomolecule]]s.
*Using micro-arrays for high-throughput screening and developing printable arrays.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4581">'''Włodzimierz Kuperberg''' (born January 19, 1941) is a professor of [[mathematics]] at [[Auburn University]], with research interests in [[geometry]] and [[topology]].

==Biography==
Although Kuperberg is [[Poles|Polish]]-[[United States|American]], he was born in what is now [[Belarus]], where his parents and older siblings had traveled east to escape [[World War II]]. In 1946, the family returned to Poland, resettling in [[Szczecin]], where Kuperberg grew up. He began his studies at the [[University of Warsaw]] in 1959, and received his Ph.D. from the same institution in 1969, under the supervision of [[Karol Borsuk]]. During his time at Warsaw, he published three high school textbooks in Polish. Kuperberg left Poland due to the anti-semitic aspects of the 1967-[[1968 Polish political crisis]], and worked at [[Stockholm University]] until 1972, when he assumed a visiting position at the [[University of Houston]]. In 1974, Kuperberg took a position at Auburn where he remains.

Kuperberg married mathematician [[Krystyna Kuperberg]] in 1964, and their son [[Greg Kuperberg]] is also a professional mathematician, while their daughter Anna Kuperberg is a photographer.

==Research highlights==
Although much of Kuperberg's early mathematical work is in [[topology]], he is best known today for his work in [[geometry]], and in particular on [[packing problems|packing]] and [[covering problems]]. His first paper in this area (1982) showed that the ratio of [[packing density]] to covering density of any convex body in the plane is at least 3/4. His 1990 paper on [[double lattice]]s with his son Greg provides the best lower bound known at that time for packing densities of arbitrary two-dimensional convex bodies; with Bezdek (1990) he calculated the exact [[list of shapes with known packing constant|packing density of the infinite cylinder]], which prior to Hales' 1998 solution of the [[Kepler conjecture]] was the first nontrivial calculation of the packing density of any three-dimensional convex body.

==Awards and honors==
As a high school student, Kuperberg won first prize in the 10th Polish Mathematical Olympiad, leading him to enroll in mathematics when he began his college studies. While at the University of Warsaw he received both the university's Excellence in Teaching and Research Award and the Polish Mathematical Society Award for Young Mathematicians. He was honored again at Auburn by a five-year Alumni Professor chairship in 1996, and again by an Erdős Professorship in 1999, which he used to visit the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]] in [[Budapest]]. In 2003, his colleagues presented him with a [[festschrift]] edited by András Bezdek, consisting of 34 papers in discrete geometry.
