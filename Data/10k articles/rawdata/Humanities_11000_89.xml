==Etymology==
"Abecedarius" (or "abecedarium") is a [[Medieval Latin]] word meaning "ABC primer", derived by adding the suffix "-arius" (-a, -um) to the names of the first four letters of the alphabet (a+b+c+d).&lt;ref name="Princeton" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hirsch"/&gt; According to the [[OED]], the earliest use of its English cognate, "abecedary", dates back at least to the mid-15 century, preceding the first usage of "abecedarian" which, as an adjective meaning "arranged in alphabetical order", can be first attested in 1665.&lt;ref name="OED2"&gt;{{Cite OED2 | abecedary }}&lt;/ref&gt; The related adjective "alphabetic" (from [[Ancient Greek]]) has been used interchangeably with "abecedarian" since at least the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED2 | alphabetic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ivanov"&gt;{{cite book|author-last=Ivanov|author-first=Andrey|title=Словарь фонетико-метрической терминологии. Латинский, древнегреческий, русский, английский, немецкий, французский языки|trans-title=Dictionary of Phono-Metrical Terminology.

==Origins==
{{See also|Abecedarium|Alphabet song}}
The abecedarius is most probably the oldest type of [[acrostic]].&lt;ref name="Shipley"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Shipley|editor-first=Joseph T.|chapter=acrostic|title=Dictionary of World Literary Terms|ISBN=0044030010|url=https://www.amazon.com/Dictionary-World-Literary-Joseph-Shipley/dp/0044030010|year=1970|edition=3rd|location=London|publisher=George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its origins have been linked to either the sacred nature of letters and the mystical significance of these types of arrangements&lt;ref name="Shipley" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Princeton" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hirsch" /&gt; or its [[didactic|didactic use]] as a [[mnemonic]] and instructive device for children.&lt;ref name="Princeton" /&gt; Indeed, this second type of abecedarii, mostly in the form of [[Alphabet song#Acrostic songs|rhythmic arrangements or songs]], is still popular and widely used tool to teach children the alphabet or other concepts.

==Use in literature==
===Ancient literature===
The oldest abecedarii found are of Semitic origin.&lt;ref name="Princeton" /&gt; In fact, all of the confirmed [[acrostic]]s in the [[Hebrew Bible]] are alphabetic. These occur in four of the five chapters that make up the ''[[Book of Lamentations]]'', in the praise of the good wife in [[Proverbs 31]]:10-31, and in [[Psalm]]s [[Psalm 25|25]], [[Psalm 34|34]], [[Psalm 37|37]], [[Psalm 111|111]], [[Psalm 112|112]], [[Psalm 119|119]], and [[Psalm 145|145]].&lt;ref name=biblicalhebrew&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.biblicalhebrew.com/alphabet.htm
|title= Acrostic Psalms |publisher=Biblicalhebrew.com |accessdate=2017-11-05| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080917055036/http://www.biblicalhebrew.com/alphabet.htm| archivedate= 17 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable&lt;ref name="Princeton" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hirsch" /&gt; among the acrostic psalms is the long [[Psalm 119]], which typically is printed in subsections named after the 22 letters of the [[Hebrew alphabet]], each section consisting of 8 verses, each of which begins with the same letter of the alphabet and the entire psalm consisting of 22 x 8 = 176 verses; and [[Ashrei|Psalm 145]], which is recited three times a day in the [[Jewish services]].

Some acrostic psalms are technically imperfect. E.g., [[Psalm 9]] and [[Psalm 10]] appear to constitute a single acrostic psalm together, but the length assigned to each letter is unequal and five of the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet are not represented and the sequence of two letters is reversed. In [[Psalm 25]], one Hebrew letter is not represented; the following letter ([[resh]]) repeated. In [[Psalm 34]], the current final verse, 23, does fit verse 22 in content, but makes the line too long. In [[Psalm 37|Psalms 37]] and [[Psalm 111|111]], the numbering of verses and the division into lines are interfering with each other; as a result, in Psalm 37, for the letters [[dalet]] and [[kaph]], there is only one verse, and the letter [[ayin]] is not represented. [[Psalm 111]] and [[Psalm 112|112]] have 22 lines, but 10 verses. [[Psalm 145]] does not represent the letter [[nun]], having 21 verses, but one [[Dead Sea Scrolls|Qumran manuscript]] of this psalm does have that missing line, which agrees with the [[Septuagint]].

===Medieval literature===
Written around 393, [[St. Augustine]]'s well-known abecedarian psalm against the [[Donatists]] is the earliest known example of medieval rhythmical verse.&lt;ref name="Princeton" /&gt; 
Another example is Old Polish poem ''Skarga umierającego''&lt;ref&gt;[http://staropolska.pl/sredniowiecze/poezja_swiecka/skarga_umierajacego.html Full text in Polish at Staropolska.pl.]&lt;/ref&gt; (''A Dying Man Complaint''). Such poems are important historical sources for development of [[orthography]]. They can be proofs that some letters were used long ago and later were totally forgotten. Bishop [[Constantine of Preslav]]'s abecedarius from 9th century documents the early Slavic alphabet. Nowadays abecedariuses are written chiefly for children.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/text/abecedarian-poetic-form Abecedrian. Poetic Form.]&lt;/ref&gt;
The most famous example of abecedarius in English literature is [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ABC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.literatureproject.com/canterbury-tales/canterbury-tales_35.htm Full text at Literature Project.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern literature===
One of the most famous and complex&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1=Myers|first1=Jack|last2=Simms|first2=Michael|title=Longman Dictionary and Handbook of Poetry|publisher=Longman|location=New York and London|year=1985|ISBN=0582283434|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=v5AYAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=0582283434&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjJ8Kn-4azXAhVP-6QKHYe9CLIQ6AEILjAA}}&lt;/ref&gt; modern examples of [[alliterative verse]] in the English language is [[Alaric Watts]]'s abecedarius ''The Siege of Belgrade'' which loosely chronicles [[Siege of Belgrade (1789)|the historical event]] in 29 lines, each of the first 26 not only beginning with the consecutive letters of the alphabet, but also composed only of words beginning with the respective letter:&lt;ref name="Bartleby"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bartleby.com/100/690.161.html |title=Alliteration, or the Siege of Belgrade: a Rondeau |last=Watts |first=Alaric |author-link=Alaric Alexander Watts |date= |website=[[bartleby.com]] |publisher= |access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;poem style="margin-left: 5em;"&gt;An Austrian army, awfully arrayed,
Boldly by battery besieged Belgrade.
Cossack commanders cannonading come,
Dealing destruction's devastating doom. 
Every endeavor engineers essay,
For fame, for fortune fighting - furious fray!&lt;/poem&gt;

Even though rarely used, some authors have preferred to use the term "abecedarius" for poems which follow Watts' arrangement, considering the "alphabet-in-acrostic" form just a loose application, as can be witnessed in these [[Self-reference#In art|self-referential]] lines:&lt;ref name="Harper"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frye|first1=Northrop|last2=Baker|first2=Sheridan|last3=Perkins|first3=George|title=The Harper Handbook to Literature|publisher=Harper &amp; Row Publishers|location=New York|chapter=Abecedarius|pages=1|ISBN=0060422173|year=1985|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=K3EZAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=0060422173&amp;dq=0060422173&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwithqvb5qzXAhVIJewKHeTOCUMQ6AEIKzAA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;poem style="margin-left: 5em;"&gt;An abecedarius always alliterates
Blindly blunders, but blooms:
Comes crawling craftily, cantering crazily,
Daring, doubtless, dark dooms.&lt;/poem&gt;

===Contemporary literature===
In the words of the American poet and critic Edward Hirsch, "[t]he abecedarian has been revived in contemporary poetry with experimental force", because, "[p]aradoxically, the arbitrary structure triggers verbal extravagances".&lt;ref name="Hirsch" /&gt; Hirsch names [[Harryette Mullen]]'s ''Sleeping with the Dictionary'' (2002), [[Carolyn Forché]]'s poem "On Earth" (2003), [[Barbara Hamby]]'s ''The Alphabet of Desire'' (2006) and [[Karl Elder]]'s ''Gilgamesh at the Bellagio'' (2007) as few modern examples structured in accordance with different variations of the basic abecedarian sequence, where the adherence to the form produces unusual and interesting aesthetic results.

In the case of [[Carolyn Forché|Forché]]'s "forty-seven page poem", for example, the rigorous alphabetical order "guides not only the stanzas, but also the words themselves":&lt;ref name="poets"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/text/abecedarian-poetic-form|title=Abecedarian: Poetic Form|publisher=Poets.org|date=2004-09-01|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;poem style="margin-left: 5em;"&gt;languid at the edge of the sea
lays itself open to immensity
leaf-cutter ants bearing yellow trumpet flowers
     along the road
left everything left all usual worlds behind
library, lilac, linens, litany.&lt;/poem&gt;
 
[[Mary Jo Bang]]'s verse collection ''The Bride of E'' uses the abecedarian as an organizing principle, as do [[Jessica Greenbaum]]'s “A Poem for S.”, [[Tom Disch]]’s “Abecedary”, and [[Matthea Harvey]]’s sequence “The Future of Terror/The Terror of Future”.&lt;ref name="poetryfoundation"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/learn/glossary-terms/abecedarian|title=Abecedarian|publisher=PoetryFoundation.org|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children's literature===
Some of the best-known and loved abecedarians have been written for children, such as [[Dr. Seuss]]'s ''[[Dr. Seuss's ABC|ABC]]'' or the roughly half-dozen alphabet books of [[Edward Gorey]], the most notorious among them ''[[The Gashlycrumb Tinies]]''.&lt;ref name="poets" /&gt; However, even the most experimental authors of the twentieth century have authored [[children's literature|children's]] or quasi-children abecedarians. Written in an attempt to compose "a birthday book [she] would have liked as a child", ''[[To Do: A Book of Alphabets and Birthdays]]'', [[Gertrude Stein]]'s intended follow-up to her first children's book, ''[[The World Is Round]]'', has been described as "a romp through the alphabet"&lt;ref name="Hirsch" /&gt; and an "unusual alphabet book".&lt;ref name="bp-stein"&gt;{{cite web|last=Popova|first=Maria|author-link=Maria Popova|url=https://www.brainpickings.org/2012/05/21/gertrude-stein-to-do-a-book-of-alphabets-and-birthdays/|title=To Do: Gertrude Stein’s Posthumous Alphabet Book|publisher=brainpickings.org|date=2012-05-21|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, [[Djuna Barnes]]' last book, ''[[Djuna Barnes#Creatures in an Alphabet|Creatures in an Alphabet]]'' is a collection of rhyming [[quatrain]]s about different [[animal]]s, ordered, albeit loosely, in an alphabet sequence.

==Related concepts==
===Iroha mojigusari===
[[Iroha mojigusari]] is a [[Japanese poetry#Japanese poetry forms|Japanese poetic form]], a "specialized version" of the abecedarius, in which the first line begins with the first and ends with the second character of the alphabet, the second one begins with the third and ends with the fourth character of the alphabet, and so on, "until all the letters of the alphabet have been used in order".&lt;ref name="Hirsch" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Princeton" /&gt;

===Alphabet poem===
Invented by [[Paul West (writer)|Paul West]], a British-born American novelist, poet, and essayist, the alphabet poem is a stricter modern variation of the abecedarius. It consists of 13 lines, each consisting of two words, each word starting with a letter which follows the initial letter of the preceding word. West introduced the alphabet poem in his book ''Alphabet Poetry'', a cycle of 26 poems, the first of which starts with AB and ends with YZ, the second one starting with BC and ending with ZA, and the last one starting with ZA and ending in XY.&lt;ref name="Deutsch"&gt;{{cite book|title=Poetry Handbook: A Dictionary of Terms|author-last=Deutsch|author-first=Babette|author-link=Babette Deutsch|edition=4th|publisher=Funk &amp; Wagnalls|location=New York|year=1974|ISBN=0308100883|url=https://books.google.de/books/about/Poetry_handbook.html?id=jeYPmGRejvsC&amp;redir_esc=y|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the constraints, West allows himself few liberties here and there, as can be witnessed in this example:&lt;ref name="Deutsch" /&gt;

''For a history of Afro-Caribbean people in the UK, see [[British African Caribbean community]].''

'''Afro-Caribbean''' (or African-Caribbean) history is the portion of [[History of the Caribbean|Caribbean history]] that specifically discusses the [[Afro-Caribbean]] or [[Black people|Black]] racial (or ethnic) populations of the Caribbean region. Most Afro-Caribbeans are the descendants of captive [[Africans]] held in the [[The Caribbean|Caribbean]] from 1502 to 1886 during the era of the [[Atlantic slave trade]].

Black people from the Caribbean who have migrated (voluntarily, or by force) to the U.S., Canada, Europe, Africa and elsewhere add a significant Diaspora element to Afro-Caribbean history. Because of the complex history of the region, many people who identify as Afro-Caribbean also have [[Europe]]an, Middle Eastern, [[Taino]], [[Chinese People|Chinese]] and/or [[Indian People|East Indian]] genealogies.

It is these peoples, who in the past were referred to and self-identified collectively as Coloured, Black or Negro [[West Indian]]s, who now generally consider themselves to be black, mixed heritage, [[Creole peoples|creole]] or African descendant people in the Caribbean and its Diasporas. Their history has been studied by historians such as [[C.L.R. James]] (author of ''[[The Black Jacobins]]''),  [[Eric Williams]] and [[Peter Fryer]] – and it is their history that is the focus of this article.

==15th and 16th centuries==
The archipelagos and islands of the [[Caribbean]] were the first sites of [[African diaspora]] dispersal in the western Atlantic during the post-Columbian era. Specifically, in 1492, [[Pedro Alonso Niño]], a black Spanish seafarer, piloted one of [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus's]] ships. He returned in 1499, but did not settle. In the early 16th century, more Africans began to enter the population of the Spanish Caribbean colonies, sometimes as freedmen, but increasingly as enslaved servants, workers and labourers. This growing demand for African labour in the Caribbean was in part the result of massive depopulation caused by the massacres, harsh conditions and disease brought by European colonists to the [[Taino]] and other indigenous peoples of the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Columbus and Las Casas: the conquest and Christianization of America, 1492–1566 | author=David M.

By the mid-16th century, [[slave trade|slave trading]] from Africa to the Caribbean was so profitable that [[Francis Drake]] and [[John Hawkins (naval commander)|John Hawkins]] were prepared to engage in piracy as well as break Spanish colonial laws, in order to forcibly transport approximately 1500 enslaved people from [[Sierra Leone]] to [[San Domingo]] (modern-day [[Haiti]] and [[Dominican Republic]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books|3ukDAAAAMAAJ|Some historical account of Guinea: With an inquiry into the rise and progress of the slave trade|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==17th and 18th centuries==
During the 17th and 18th centuries, European colonialism in the Caribbean became increasingly reliant on plantation slavery, so that, by the end of the 18th century, on many islands, enslaved (and free) [[Afro-Caribbeans]] far outnumbered their European rulers.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen D. Behrendt, David Richardson, and David Eltis, [[W. E. B. Du Bois Institute|W. E. B. Du Bois Institute for African and African-American Research]], [[Harvard University]]. Based on "records for 27,233 voyages that set out to obtain slaves for the Americas". {{cite book |last=Stephen Behrendt |title=Africana: The Encyclopedia of the African and African American Experience |year=1999 |publisher=Basic Civitas Books |location=New York |isbn=0-465-00071-1 |chapter=Transatlantic Slave Trade |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the region, Africans developed a variety of response to the plantation system. One was to seek [[manumission]] through conventional legal methods, such as working to buy or otherwise engineer personal freedom from individual slave holders.&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:XrU5WXhDn0AJ:jeromehandler.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Manumission-84.pdf+&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESideS_qVDq0_ytgz_Yhc-Kuv03Phf_Wa-muHRU0tUFfjUnmXknadzed91jNsae897tU8dKufqwQ9AFxssEvc6w-vXclqzLg7-NgzUNtrbdfPg_6XigVvgvzHuMu2cH7cOm0vv8c&amp;sig=AHIEtbSS-RPZK79EtwRmrIJi3l2x6fj_0g Jerome S. Handler and John T. Pohlmann, "Slave Manumissions and Freedmen in Seventeenth-Century Barbados", in ''The William and Mary Quarterly'', Third Series, Vol. 41, No. 3, July 1984, pp. 390-408.].&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals who took this route included [[Olaudah Equiano]] and [[Ottobah Cugoano]]. Often, especially in San Domingo, manumission occurred when slave-holding fathers freed their own children by African mothers. One such case was that of the classical music composer Joseph Bo(u)logne, (known as the [[Chevalier de Saint-George]]). Perhaps the most dangerous method of liberation from enslavement was the Afro-Caribbean devised system of "marronage", in which people escaped from plantations to establish (or join) armed, independent, forest and mountain communities known as [[Maroon (people)|Maroons]], where they were led by individuals such as [[Nanny of the Maroons]].&lt;ref name=heroes&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.jis.gov.jm/special_sections/Heroes/Heroes1.htm |title=Government of Jamaica, national heroes listing |access-date=2012-11-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515130137/http://www.jis.gov.jm/special_sections/Heroes/Heroes1.htm#Nanny |archive-date=2011-05-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Friction between Maroons and plantation owners led to the [[First Maroon War]]&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, Orlando (1970), "Slavery and Slave Revolts: A Sociohistorical Analysis of the First Maroon War, 1665-1740", in Richard Price, ''Maroon Societies: Rebel Slave Communities in the Americas'', Anchor Books, 1973, {{ISBN|0-385-06508-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and contributed to an atmosphere of simmering rebellion and increasingly harsh repression by the authorities. However, for most enslaved Afro-Caribbean people, individual escape or manumission were only partial answers and could not bring general political and social reform. As a result, the harsh conditions, constant inter-imperial warfare and growing revolutionary sentiments in the region eventually resulted in the [[Haitian Revolution]] led by [[Toussaint L'Ouverture]]&lt;ref&gt;C. L. R. James, ''The Black Jacobins: Toussaint L'Ouverture and the San Domingo Revolution'', Vintage Books, 1963, Penguin Books, 2001. {{ISBN|0-14-029981-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]].

==19th century==
In 1804, after 13 years of war, Haiti, with its overwhelmingly [[black people|black]] population and leadership, became the second nation in the Americas to win independence from a European state when the army of former slaves defeated [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon's]] invasion force. During the 19th Century, further waves of rebellion, such as the [[Baptist War]], led by [[Sam Sharpe]] in [[Jamaica]],&lt;ref&gt;Philip Sherlock, 1998. ''Story of the Jamaican People'', Central.
&lt;/ref&gt; created the conditions for the incremental abolition of slavery in the region, with [[Cuba]] the last island to achieve [[history of slavery|emancipation]] in 1886.

Emancipation created greater opportunities for self-advancement and travel, with Afro-Caribbean people such as the nursing pioneer [[Mary Seacole]] making full use of greater personal freedom. As emancipated Afro-Caribbeans abandoned the plantations, British colonialists, particularly in [[Trinidad and Tobago]] sought to replace the diminishing labour force with indentured labourers brought in from colonial India and China.

==20th century==
During the 20th century, Afro-Caribbean people began to assert their cultural, economic and political rights with ever more vigor on the world stage, starting with [[Marcus Garvey]]'s [[UNIA]] movement&lt;ref&gt;Tony Martin, ''Race First: The Ideological and Organizational Struggle of Marcus Garvey and the Universal Negro Improvement Association''. Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; in the U.S. and continuing with [[Aimé Césaire]]'s negritude movement.&lt;ref&gt;Malela, Buata B., ''Aimé Césaire. Le fil et la trame: critique et figuration de la colonialité du pouvoir''. Paris: Anibwe, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1960s, the former slave population began to win their independence from British colonial rule, and were pre-eminent in creating new cultural forms such as [[reggae music]], [[Calypso music|calypso]] and [[rastafari]]anism within the Caribbean itself. However, beyond the region, a new Afro-Caribbean diaspora, including such figures as [[Stokely Carmichael]] and [[DJ Kool Herc]] was influential in the creation of the [[hip-hop]] and [[black power]] movements in the US, as well as cultural developments in Europe, as evidenced by influential theorists such as [[Frantz Fanon]]&lt;ref&gt;Nigel C. Gibson, ''Fanon: The Postcolonial Imagination'' (2003: Oxford, Polity Press)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;Chen, Kuan-Hsing. "The Formation of a Diasporic Intellectual: An interview with Stuart Hall," collected in David Morley and Kuan-Hsing Chen (eds), ''Stuart Hall: Critical Dialogues in Cultural Studies''. New York: Routledge, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, in the [[French Caribbean]] possessions of [[Guadeloupe]] and [[Martinique]], the independence movements did not achieve the same success as in the former British Caribbean, in part because of France's offer of complete political integration into the French state and society. Thus, most French Afro-Caribbean people are born as citizens of France, with voting rights and other privileges of citizenship.

==21st century==
In the early 21st century, the pop singer [[Rihanna]], with her racy costumes and jet-set life style, seems to epitomise a growing sense of cultural self-assertion and cosmopolitanism amongst Afro-Caribbean young people. While, in political history, the election of [[Portia Simpson Miller]] as Prime Minister of Jamaica underlined the growing prominence of Afro-Caribbean women in daily life. But, despite many such obvious individual successes, millions of Afro-Caribbean people across the region continue to face serious historical challenges, including, the eradication of widespread poverty and joblessness in major population centers like Haiti and Jamaica.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20111009/business/business8.html "Poverty, Income Inequality on the Rise in Jamaica - Report", ''The Gleaner'', 9 October 2011 (accessed 30 November 2012).]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, questions remain about how far racial equality for Afro-Caribbean people has progressed since the era of racial slavery, particularly in countries with significant [[white people|white]] populations.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

There has also been a trend of contemporary migration of West Africans to countries such as Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago.

[[File:Bertillon, Alphonse, fiche anthropométrique recto-verso.jpg|thumb|Anthropometric data sheet (both sides) of [[Alphonse Bertillon]], a pioneer in anthropological criminology]]
'''Anthropological criminology''' (sometimes referred to as '''criminal anthropology''', literally a combination of the study of the [[human]] species and the study of [[crime|criminals]]) is a field of [[offender profiling]], based on perceived links between the nature of a [[crime]] and the personality or physical appearance of the offender. Although similar to [[physiognomy]] and [[phrenology]], the term "criminal [[anthropology]]" is generally reserved for the works of the [[Italian school of criminology]] of the late 19th century ([[Cesare Lombroso]], [[Enrico Ferri]], [[Raffaele Garofalo]]). Lombroso thought that criminals were born with inferior physiological differences which were detectable. He popularized the notion of "born criminal" and thought that criminality was an [[atavism]] or [[hereditary]] disposition. His central idea was to locate crime completely within the individual and utterly divorce it from the surrounding social conditions and structures. A founder of the [[Positivist school]] of criminology, Lombroso opposed the social positivism developed by the [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago school]] and [[environmental criminology]].

On the other hand, [[Alphonse Bertillon]] (1853&amp;ndash;1914) created a [[mugshot]] identification system for criminals prior to the invention of [[fingerprinting]]. [[Hans Gross]] (1847&amp;ndash;1915), leading worker in the field of [[criminology]] was also involved in the development of the theory.&lt;ref name="here"&gt;''Anthropological Criminology, North Carolina Wesleyan College, retrieved from [http://faculty.ncwc.edu/toconnor/301/301lect03.htm here] on March 10, 2007 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061009044430/http://faculty.ncwc.edu/toconnor/301/301lect03.htm |date=October 9, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social Darwinism ==
The theory of anthropological criminology was influenced heavily by the ideas of [[Charles Darwin]] (1809–1882). However, the influences came mainly from philosophy derived from Darwin's [[theory of evolution]], specifically that some species were morally superior to others. This idea was in fact spawned by [[Social Darwinism]], but nevertheless formed a critical part of anthropological criminology.&lt;ref name="here"/&gt; The work of Cesare Lombroso was continued by Social Darwinists in the [[United States]] between 1881 and 1911.

==The theory==

In the 19th century, Cesare Lombroso and his followers, performed autopsies on criminals and declared that they had discovered similarities between the [[physiologies]] of the bodies and those of "primitive humans", monkeys and apes. Most of these similarities involved receding foreheads, height, head shape and size, and based on these Lombroso postulated the theory of the ‘born criminal’. Lombroso also declared that the female offender was worse than the male, as they had strong masculine characteristics.

Lombroso outlined 14 physiognomic characteristics which he and his followers believed to be common in all criminals: unusually short or tall height; small head, but large face; fleshy lips, but thin upper lip; protuberances (bumps) on head, in back of head and around ear; wrinkles on forehead and face; large sinus cavities or bumpy face; tattoos on body; receding hairline; bumps on head, particularly above left ear; large incisors; bushy eyebrows, tending to meet across nose; large eye sockets, but deep-set eyes; beaked or flat nose; strong jaw line; small and sloping forehead; small or weak chin; thin neck; sloping shoulders, but large chest; large, protruding ears; long arms; high cheek bones; pointy or snubbed fingers or toes.&lt;ref name="here"/&gt;

Lombroso published several works regarding his work, ''L'Uomo Delinquente'', ''L'Homme Criminel (The Criminal Man)'', ''The Female Offender'' (original titled ''Criminal Woman, the Prostitute, and the Normal Woman'') and ''Criminal Man, According to the Classification of Cesare Lombroso''.

==Rejection==

During Lombroso's life, British scientist [[Charles Buckman Goring]] (1870&amp;ndash;1919) was also working in the same area, and concluded that there were no noticeable physiological differences between law-abiding people and those who committed crimes. Maurice Parmelee, seen as the founder of modern criminology in America, also began to reject the theory of anthropological criminology in 1911, which led to its eventual withdrawal from the field of accepted criminology research.

==Modern times==

Despite general rejection of Lombroso's theories, anthropological criminology still finds a place of sort in modern criminal profiling. Historically (particularly in the 1930s) criminal anthropology had been associated somewhat with [[eugenics]] as the idea of a physiological flaw in the human race was often associated with plans to remove such flaws. This was found particularly in America, with the American Eugenics Movement between 1907 and 1939, and the [[Anti-miscegenation laws]], and also in Germany during the [[Third Reich]] where 250,000 mentally disabled Germans were killed.&lt;ref name="here"/&gt;

Criminal anthropology, and the closely related study of Physiognomy, have also found their way into studies of [[social psychology]] and [[forensic psychology]]. Studies into the nature of [[twins]] also combines aspects of criminal anthropology, as some studies reveal that identical twins share a likelihood of criminal activities more so than non-identical twins. Lombroso's theories are also found in studies of [[Galvanic skin response]] and [[XYY syndrome|XYY chromosome syndrome]].

'''Anton Stefanov Mitov''' (Bulgarian: Антон Стефанов Митов; 1 April 1862, [[Stara Zagora]] - 20 August 1930, [[Sofia]]) was a Bulgarian painter, art critic, art historian, social activist and corresponding member of the [[Bulgarian Academy of Sciences]].

==Biography ==
When he was fifteen, [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] troops burned his hometown and massacred over 14,000 people. His  family fled to [[Svishtov]], where they lived in poverty. He took a job as a clerk in Romania and remained there until Bulgaria was [[Liberation of Bulgaria|liberated]] in 1878, returning home determined to be an artist. In 1881, after working as a telegraph operator for two years, he saved enough money to enroll at the [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Firenze]] where he studied under the direction of [[Giuseppe Ciaranfi]]. Upon his return home, he worked as a journalist and a teacher in Stara Zagoda, [[Plovdiv]], [[Varna]] and Sofia.

In 1896, he was one of the co-founders of the [[National Academy of Arts]]&lt;br /&gt; in Sofia, where he taught art history, drawing and perspective. He served two terms as its Director, from 1912 to 1918, and from 1924 to 1927. In 1898, he was part of a team of artists that decorated the [[Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, Sofia|Alexander Nevsky Cathedral]]. One of the first Bulgarian painters to exhibit internationally, he played a decisive role in dispelling the image of his country as a cultural backwater.

He was also active in the nation's political and cultural life, making contributions to many newspapers such as ''Balkan Dawn'', ''Evening Post'' and ''World'' as well as the magazine ''Art'' (usually under pseudonyms, such as "Tonino" and "Arnold"). He also lectured extensively and did book illustrations (those for ''[[Under the Yoke]]'' by [[Ivan Vazov]] are, perhaps, best known).

Among his works are the first [[seascape]]s painted in Bulgaria, although he specialized in [[Genre art|genre]] art and portraits. A street in Plovdiv is named after him. His brother [[Georgi Mitov|Georgi]] was also a well-known painter.

{{History of Arkansas}}
{{Confederate states in the American Civil War}}

During the [[American Civil War]], [[Arkansas]] was a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] state, though it had initially voted to remain in the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]]. Following the capture of [[Fort Sumter]] in April 1861, [[Abraham Lincoln]] called for troops from every Union state to put down the rebellion, and Arkansas and several other states seceded. For the rest of the war, Arkansas played a major role in controlling the vital [[Mississippi River]] and neighboring states, including [[Tennessee in the American Civil War|Tennessee]] and [[Missouri in the American Civil War|Missouri]].

It raised 48 infantry regiments, 20 artillery batteries, and over 20 cavalry regiments for the Confederacy, mostly serving in the [[Western Theater of the American Civil War|Western Theater]], though the [[3d Arkansas Infantry Regiment (Confederate States)|3d Arkansas Infantry Regiment]] served with distinction in the [[Army of Northern Virginia]]. [[Major General]] [[Patrick Cleburne]] was the state's most notable military leader. The state also raised four infantry regiments, four cavalry regiments and one artillery battery for the Union.  Finally there were six infantry regiments and one artillery battery of United States Colored Troops raised in Arkansas.

Numerous skirmishes as well as several significant battles were fought in Arkansas, including the [[Battle of Pea Ridge]] in March 1862, a decisive one for the [[Trans-Mississippi Theater of the American Civil War|Trans-Mississippi Theater]] which ensured Union control of northern Arkansas. The state capitol at [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]] was captured in 1863. By the end of the war, programs such as the draft, high taxes, and martial law had led to a decline in enthusiasm for the Confederate cause. Arkansas was officially readmitted to the Union in 1868.

==Background==
The state of Arkansas was a member of the Confederacy during the war, and provided troops, supplies, and military and political leaders. Arkansas became the [[List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union|25th state of the United States]] on June 15, 1836, entering as a [[slave state]]. Some of [[Antebellum era|Antebellum]] Arkansas was still a wilderness in most areas, rural and sparsely populated.  Slavery had existed in the area since French/Spanish colonial times, but had been limited in scale until after statehood.  Plantation style agriculture had taken hold in the areas of the state that had easy access to water transportation for moving cash crops, like cotton, to market. Counties bordering the Mississippi, Arkansas, White, Saline, and Ouachita rivers had the highest slave populations.  Slavery existed but on a much smaller scale in the mountainous northwest and north central parts of the state. The 1850s had seen rapid economic growth in the state.

News of John Brown's Raid in Virginia in 1859 had spurred a renewed interest in the state's militia system which had been virtually dormant since the end of the War with Mexico. Like most of the United States, Arkansas had an organized militia system before the Civil War. State law required military service of most male inhabitants of a certain age. By August 1860 the state's militia consisted of 62 regiments divided into eight brigades, which comprised an eastern division and a western division. New regiments were added as the militia organization developed. Additionally, many counties and cities raised uniformed volunteer companies, which drilled more often and were better equipped than the un-uniformed militia. These volunteer companies were instrumental in the seizure of federal installations at Little Rock and Fort Smith, beginning in February 1861 before Arkansas actually seceded.

During the Presidential Election of 1860, [[Abraham Lincoln]] was not even on the ballot in Arkansas.  The state voted for the [[Southern Democratic Party]] candidate [[John C. Breckinridge]], of Kentucky.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1860 Presidential Election Results Arkansas|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=1860&amp;minper=0&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The secession crisis==
{{further|Origins of the American Civil War}}
[[Abraham Lincoln]]'s victory in the [[United States presidential election, 1860|presidential election of 1860]] triggered [[South Carolina]]'s declaration of secession from the Union. By February 1861, six more Southern states made similar declarations. On February 7, the seven states adopted a provisional constitution for the [[Confederate States of America]] and established their temporary capital at [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]], Alabama. A pre-war February [[Peace Conference of 1861]] met in Washington in a failed attempt at resolving the crisis.&lt;ref name="jstor"&gt;Stampp, Kenneth M. Letters from the Washington Peace Conference of 1861, The Journal of Southern History, Vol. 9, No. 3 (Aug., 1943), pp. 394–403, Accessed February 2, 2011, https://www.jstor.org/stable/2191323&lt;/ref&gt;

As the secession movement grew, people in Arkansas became greatly concerned. In January 1861 the General Assembly called an election for the people to vote on whether Arkansas should hold a convention to consider secession. At the same time the voters were to elect delegates to the convention in case the vote should be favorable. On February 18, 1861, Arkansans voted to call a secession convention, but elected mostly [[Union (American Civil War)|unionist]] delegates.&lt;ref name="arkansasties"&gt;Arkansas Civil War Chronicles – 1861, Accessed January 11, 2011, {{cite web |url=http://www.arkansasties.com/Military/CivilWar1861.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707162140/http://www.arkansasties.com/Military/CivilWar1861.htm |archivedate=July 7, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=6304|title=Encyclopedia of Arkansas.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seizure of the Federal Arsenal at Little Rock===
[[File:Arsenal1800s.jpg|thumb|left|Little Rock Arsenal, early 1800s]]
Secessionist forces began calling for the seizure of the [[Tower Building of the Little Rock Arsenal|Federal Arsenal]] in Little Rock. When rumors were circulated that the Federal Government intended to reinforce the troops at the Little Rock Arsenal, the leading citizens of [[Helena, Arkansas|Helena]] sent Governor [[Henry Massey Rector]] a telegram volunteering 500 men to assist in its seizure. Edmund Burgevin, adjutant general of the Arkansas State Militia, carried the message to the Governor. Burgevin complained of the impropriety of a direct offer of volunteers to the governor of a State which had not seceded, and might not secede. Governor Rector's response was:

{{quotation|The governor has no authority to summon you to take possession of a Federal post, whether threatened to be reinforced or not. Should the people assemble in their defense, the governor will interpose his official position in their behalf.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"&gt;The War Almost Started in Little Rock, Seizing the U.S. Arsenal at Little Rock, The Capitol Guard, Company A, 6th Arkansas Volunteer Infantry, Accessed, October 31, 2010, https://web.archive.org/web/20091029033543/http://geocities.com/capitalguards/arsenal.html&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In response to the Governor's message, militia companies began assembling in Little Rock by February 5, 1861, and they made their intention to seize the Arsenal known to its commander, Captain Totten. Eventually more than a thousand militiamen would assemble, representing Phillips, [[Jefferson County, Arkansas|Jefferson]], [[Prairie County, Arkansas|Prairie]], [[White County, Arkansas|White]], [[Saline County, Arkansas|Saline]], [[Hot Spring County, Arkansas|Hot Spring]], [[Montgomery County, Arkansas|Montgomery]], [[Monroe County, Arkansas|Monroe]], and [[St. Francis County, Arkansas|St Francis]] counties.  Although generally opposed to secession, the Little Rock City Council feared that a battle might ensue within the city itself and passed an ordinance requesting the Governor assume control of the assembling volunteer forces and to seize the Arsenal "to prevent the effusion of blood".&lt;ref name="simmonsgames"&gt;The War of the Rebellion, a Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies, Ser. I, Vol. 1, Ch. VIII–Reports, page 642, accessed January 24, 2010, http://www.simmonsgames.com/research/authors/USWarDept/ORA/OR-S1-V01-C008R.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Governor Rector, now armed with the city council's request, took control of the military situation. With militia forces now surrounding the arsenal grounds, Governor Rector dispatched General Thomas D. Merrick, commander of the First Division, Arkansas Militia, with a formal demand for the Arsenal's surrender.&lt;ref name="cornell101"&gt;The War of the Rebellion: a Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies.

Governor Rector agreed and the Militia took control of the Arsenal on February 8, 1861.&lt;ref name="cornell102"&gt;The War of the Rebellion: a Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies.

===The first Convention on Secession===
On March 4, 1861, Lincoln was sworn in as President. In his [[Lincoln's first inaugural address|inaugural address]], he argued that the Constitution was a [[Preamble to the United States Constitution|"more perfect union"]] than the earlier [[Articles of Confederation|Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union]], that it was a binding contract, and called any secession "legally void".&lt;ref name="inaugural"&gt;Abraham Lincoln, First Inaugural Address, Monday, March 4, 1861.&lt;/ref&gt; He stated he had no intent to invade the Southern states, nor did he intend to end [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] where it existed, but that he would use force to maintain possession of federal property. His speech closed with a plea for restoration of the bonds of union.&lt;ref name="inaugural105"&gt;Lincoln, First Inaugural Address, March 4, 1861.&lt;/ref&gt;

The next day, the Arkansas Secession Convention convened in the State House in Little Rock. Judge David Walker, who opposed secession, was elected president. The convention continued in session for two and a half weeks. Feeling ran high and many fiery speeches were made, Governor Rector addressed the convention in an oratory urging the extension of slavery:

{{quote|The area of slavery must be extended correlative with its antagonism, or it will be put speedily in the 'course of ultimate extinction.'... The extension of slavery is the vital point of the whole controversy between the North and the South... Amendments to the federal constitution are urged by some as a panacea for all the ills that beset us. That instrument is amply sufficient as it now stands, for the protection of Southern rights, if it was only enforced. The South wants practical evidence of good faith from the North, not mere paper agreements and compromises. They believe slavery a sin, we do not, and there lies the trouble.|Henry M. Rector|Arkansas Secession Convention|(March 2, 1861).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://civilwartalk.com/threads/fighting-for-slavery.80951/page-5|date=1861|title=Arkansas Secession Convention|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

But it soon became evident that a majority of the delegates to the convention did not think that the situation at that time called for secession. The convention voted down a resolution condemning Lincoln's inaugural address, and defeated a conditional ordinance of secession. The opinion seemed to prevail that Arkansas should secede only if the Federal government made war on the Confederate States. Still hoping for a compromise settlement that would avoid war, the delegates agreed to go home until after the people had voted on the secession question at a special election to be held in August.&lt;ref name="confederate106"&gt;Dougan, Confederate Arkansas, pp. 35–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reaction to the attack on Fort Sumter===
Under orders from Confederate President [[Jefferson Davis]], troops controlled by the Confederate government under [[P. G. T. Beauregard]] bombarded [[Fort Sumter]] in Charleston harbor on April 12, forcing the capitulation of its Federal garrison. In response, President Lincoln called upon the "militia of the several states" to provide [[President Lincoln's 75,000 volunteers|75,000 troops]] to put down the rebellion.&lt;ref name="mcpherson"&gt;[[James M. McPherson]], ''[[Battle Cry of Freedom (book)|Battle Cry of Freedom]]'', p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt;  In spite of the fact that Arkansas had yet to officially secede, Governor Rector sensed that the move toward open war would shift public opinion into the secessionist camp and he quickly organized a militia battalion under the command of [[Solon Borland|Solon F. Borland]].  The militia was dispatched it to seize the Federal Arsenal at [[Fort Smith, Arkansas|Fort Smith]] on April 23, 1861.&lt;ref name="couchgenweb109"&gt;Edward G. Gerdes Civil War Page, Borlands Regiment, accessed October 1, 2010, {{cite web|url=http://www.couchgenweb.com/civilwar/borlands.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716052016/http://www.couchgenweb.com/civilwar/borlands.html |archivedate=July 16, 2011 |df=mdy }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Governor Rector's response to President Lincoln's request for troops was: "The people of this Commonwealth are freemen, not slaves, and will defend to the last extremity their honor, lives, and property, against Northern mendacity and usurpation."&lt;ref&gt;p. 23 ''The American annual cyclopedia and register of important events ..., Volume 15: Embracing political, civil, military, and social affairs: public documents; biography, statistics, commerce, finance, literature, science, agriculture, and mechanical industry'' 1876&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arkansas leaves the Union===
The first Arkansas secession convention had pledged the state to "Resist to the last extremity any attempt on the part of such power (President Lincoln) to coerce any state that had succeeded from the old Union".&lt;ref&gt;The New York Times, 8 June 1861, "The secession of Arkansas" accessed 30 December 2017, Now"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1861/06/08/news/the-secession-of-arkansas.html&lt;/ref&gt; Now, faced with President Lincoln's demand for troops, the convention reconvened in Little Rock and, on May 6, 1861, passed the ordinance of secession&lt;ref name="texashistory.unt.edu"&gt;United States. War Dept. The War of the Rebellion: A Compilation of the Official Records of the Union And Confederate Armies. Series 4, Volume 1., Book, 1900; (http://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth139260/ : accessed January 08, 2016), University of North Texas Libraries, The Portal to Texas History, http://texashistory.unt.edu; crediting UNT Libraries Government Documents Department, Denton, Texas.&lt;/ref&gt; by a vote of 69 to 1. Future Governor [[Isaac Murphy]] was the only "No" vote.&lt;ref&gt;Wooster, Ralph. "The Arkansas Secession Convention." Arkansas Historical Quarterly 13 (Autumn 1954): 172–195&lt;/ref&gt;

The convention adopted several resolutions explaining why the state was declaring secession. They stated that the primary reason for Arkansas' secession was "hostility to the institution of African slavery" from the free states. The free states' support for "equality with negroes" was another reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://civilwartalk.com/threads/did-the-southern-soldier-fight-and-die-to-preserve-slavery.117485/page-16#post-1196725|title=The Journal of the Arkansas Secession Convention|date=1861|location=Arkansas|pages=51–54|accessdate=March 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, one Arkansas man, supporting the view of the secession convention regarding slavery, stated that if the Union were to win the war, his "sister, wife, and mother are to be given up to the embraces of their present dusky male servitors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Thomas|last=Key|location=Arkansas|title=Diary entry|date=April 10, 1864|accessdate=March 8, 2016|url=http://civilwartalk.com/threads/why-did-the-average-soldier-fight-in-the-acw.12486/page-14#post-145995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organizing for war===
The Secession Convention continued to meet and began the process of drafting a new state constitution and ordering the state's military affairs. Many in the convention were angry with the way Governor Rector utilized the militia to move the state closer to war by seizing Federal installations. As a result, the constitution sought to limit the power of the Governor by limiting his term to two years, rather than four, and vesting authority for military matters in a three-person board chaired by the Governor.&lt;ref name="texashistory.unt.edu"/&gt; The Military Board was to oversee the organization of a state army; to arm, feed, and clothe the troops; and to call out the forces for such military expeditions as might be necessary to defend the state.&lt;ref name="Arkansas Army and Air National Guard, a History and Record of Events, 1820–1962"&gt;{{Cite journal |last = Harry |first = Smith |title = Arkansas Army and Air National Guard, a History and Record of Events, 1820–1962 |page = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Secession Convention also adopted an ordinance providing for the organization of an "Army of Arkansas".&lt;ref name="confederate112"&gt;Huff, Col. Leo E., The Military Board in Confederate Arkansas, Arkansas Historical Quarterly, Page 76&lt;/ref&gt;  The Army was to consist of two divisions: the 1st Division in the western portion of the state and the 2nd Division in the eastern portion of the state. Each division was to be commanded by a brigadier general.&lt;ref name="confederate113"&gt;A thorough analysis of the Military Board may be found in Leo E. Huff, "The Military Board in Confederate Arkansas", Arkansas Historical Quarterly, XXVI (Spring 1967), pp. 75–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Convention elected three of its members as commanders of the new army: Major General [[James Yell]] of Jefferson County (overall commander) [[Nicholas Bartlett Pearce]], a graduate of [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] and resident of [[Benton County, Arkansas|Benton County]] (commander of the First Division), and [[Thomas H. Bradley]] of [[Crittenden County, Arkansas|Crittenden County]] (commander of the Second Division).&lt;ref name="www"&gt;Thomas H. Bradley Papers, 1836–1847, Tennessee Department of State, Accessed January 24, 2011, http://www.tn.gov/tsla/history/manuscripts/mguidea.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="confederate114"&gt;Huff, Leo E., "The Military Board in Confederate Arkansas", Arkansas Historical Quarterly, XXVI (Spring 1967), p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

The Secession Convention enacted an ordinance on May 30, 1861, that called upon all the counties in the State to appoint a "home guard of minute men" for local defense, until regular military regiments could be raised and deployed. These Home Guard units were made up of old men and boys who were not eligible for normal military service. Like the militia, the Home Guard units were organized at the county level, with companies being supplied by each township.&lt;ref name="couchgenweb115"&gt;Edward G. Gerdes Civil War Page, Independence County Home Guard—1861, Accessed, November 1, 2010, http://www.couchgenweb.com/civilwar/indhomgd.html  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100814200603/http://www.couchgenweb.com/civilwar/indhomgd.html |date=August 14, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Confederate units==
{{Main|Book:Arkansas Confederate Infantry Units|Book:Arkansas Confederate Cavalry Units|Book:Arkansas Confederate Artillery Units}}
Arkansas formed 48 infantry regiments and over 20 [[cavalry]] regiments and 20 [[artillery|artillery batteries]] for the [[Confederate States Army]]. Most of the troops raised in Arkansas before May 1862 were transferred east of the Mississippi River and would eventually comprise a division in the Confederate [[Army of Tennessee]]. All but one infantry regiment and all of the cavalry and artillery units served most of the war in what was known as the "Western Theater", where there were few battles that were on the scale of those in the "Eastern Theater". Beginning in 1862, the Confederate States west of the Mississippi River were assigned to the Department of the Trans-Mississippi. All of the new unit raised and organized after May 1862 would remain in the Trans-Mississippi for the remainder of the war.  One infantry regiment, the "Third Arkansas", served in the eastern theater for the duration of the war, thus making it the state's most celebrated Confederate military unit. Attached to [[General]] [[Robert E. Lee]]'s Army of Northern Virginia, the "[[3d Arkansas Infantry Regiment (Confederate States)|Third Arkansas]]" would take part in almost every major Eastern battle, including the [[Battle of Seven Pines]], [[Seven Days Battle]], [[Battle of Harper's Ferry]], [[Battle of Antietam]], [[Battle of Fredericksburg]], [[Battle of Gettysburg]], [[Battle of Chickamauga]], [[Battle of the Wilderness]], and the [[Appomattox Campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Joslyn |first=Maurial P. |title="For Ninety Nine Years or the War" The Story of the "Third Arkansas" at Gettysburg |journal=The Gettysburg Magazine |date=January 1996 |issue=14 |url=http://www.morningsidebooks.com/cgi/bookshop/articles.cgi?cat=2&amp;issue=14&amp;article=5&amp;userid=$id |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040422014958/http://www.morningsidebooks.com/cgi/bookshop/articles.cgi?cat=2&amp;issue=14&amp;article=5&amp;userid=%24id |archivedate=April 22, 2004 |accessdate=17 June 2015 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civilwarhome.com/robertsongettysburgor.htm Brigadier-General J.

===1861===
Once Arkansas left the Union in May 1861, the existing volunteer militia companies were among the first mustered into state service and be formed into new volunteer infantry regiments, also referred to as "State Troops". These new regiments comprised the Provisional Army of Arkansas. In July 1861 an agreement was reached to transfer the existing state forces into the Confederate army. The Second Division of the Army of Arkansas was transferred to the Confederate Army under the command of General [[William J. Hardee]], but before the First Division of the Army of Arkansas could be transferred, it participated in the second major battle of the war near Springfield, Missouri, in August 1861. Arkansas "State Troops" provided the bulk of forces for the [[Battle of Wilson's Creek]] Although the battle was a victory for the Confederacy, the Arkansas State Troops moved back to Arkansas and, after a dispute over transfer to Confederate authority, were disbanded. Most remaining Confederate forces in Arkansas were transferred east of the Mississippi River in the fall of 1861 and spent the remainder of the war serving in that theater.

In November 1861, Colonel [[Solon Borland|Solon S. Borland]], commanding Confederate forces at Pittman's Ferry received information regarding an impending invasion of Northeast Arkansas and issued an immediate call for militia forces to reinforce his position. The State Military Board authorized the activation of Eighth Brigade of Militia, and one company from the militia regiments of Prairie, Monroe, Poinsett, Saint Francis, and Craighead counties. The units that responded to this call were formed into three regiments of 30 Day Volunteers. Some of these companies later enrolled in regular Confederate service.&lt;ref&gt;From, Fight and Survive!

The Secession Convention's and Military Board's fears of Arkansas troops being transferred east of the Mississippi quickly became a reality. By the end of September 1861 Brigadier General [[William J. Hardee]] had transferred his new command of Arkansas troops east of the Mississippi to join what would become the [[Confederate Army of Tennessee]].&lt;ref name="Huff, Military Board, pp. 82–84"&gt;Huff, "Military Board", pp. 82–84.&lt;/ref&gt; Arkansas soon found itself virtually defenseless. Governor Rector's newspaper charged: "The Confederate government has abandoned Arkansas to her fate."&lt;ref name="confederate157"&gt;Dougan, Confederate Arkansas, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; By November 1861 Governor Rector reported that 21 regiments had been raised for the war effort, a total of 16,000 men, and an additional 6,000 men were soon to be in the ranks.&lt;ref name="Huff, Military Board, pp. 82–84"/&gt;

===1862===
Many of the Arkansas regiments organized in the summer of 1861 would serve under General [[Albert Sidney Johnston]] at the [[Battle of Shiloh]] in April 1862 and would eventually be assigned to Patrick Cleburne's division of the Army of Tennessee, and the remnants would surrender with that army in [[North Carolina in the American Civil War|North Carolina]] at the close of the war.

In January 1862 Major General [[Earl Van Dorn]] was dispatched to Arkansas to build a new force. He immediately issued a call to Governor Rector for the raising of additional companies. In a proclamation dated January 31, 1862, Governor Rector called for the formation of 100 new companies and four batteries, while noting:

{{quotation|From the best data in possession of the State authorities it is estimated that Arkansas has now 22,000 men in the Confederate Army, which is equal to 37 per cent, of her population fit or subject to military duty—the 8,500 called for making 30,500 out of 60,000, being one-half, or 50 per cent, of her entire military force.&lt;ref&gt;THE WAR OF THE REBELLION: A COMPILATION OF THE OFFICIAL RECORDS OF THE UNION AND CONFEDERATE ARMIES, SERIES I—VOLUME LUX, REPORTS, CORRESPONDENCE, ETC. page 777 – 781, Accessed 3 March 2010, https://books.google.com/books?id=fs8tAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA781&amp;dq=Arkansas+State+Military+Board+1861&amp;output=text#c_top&lt;/ref&gt;}}

General Van Dorn led his new [[Army of the West (1862)|Army of the West]] into the [[Battle of Pea Ridge]], March 6–8, 1862. The battle was a major defeat for Southern forces in the Trans-Mississippi Theater and led to the loss of northwest Arkansas. Immediately following the battle of Pea Ridge, Van Dorn was ordered to transfer his forces east of the Mississippi River to reinforce Confederate forces in northern Mississippi, near Corinth. Van Dorn's forces were heavily engaged in operations around Corinth in the summer and fall of 1862. [[Brigadier General]] [[Evander McNair]]'s Arkansas brigade of the Army of the West would eventually find itself assigned to the Army of Tennessee, and its remnants would finally surrender with that army in North Carolina at the close of the war. Other parts of the Army of the West and several Arkansas regiments which had previously served at [[Battle of Fort Donaldson|Fort Donaldson]] and [[Battle of Island No. 10|Island No. 10]] would find themselves trapped in the [[Siege of Vicksburg]] and the [[Siege of Port Hudson]] in the summer of 1863.&lt;ref&gt;Eicher, John H., and Eicher, David J., Civil War High Commands, Stanford Univ. Press, 2001, {{ISBN|0-8047-3641-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Van Dorn was leaving the state, Major General [[Samuel Ryan Curtis|Samuel Curtis]], the victor of the battle of Pea Ridge, began an invasion of Arkansas in early April. He moved his 17,000-man army back into [[Missouri]] to take advantage of better transportation routes and headed east. He established his base of supply at [[Rolla, Missouri]]. Curtis reached [[West Plains, Missouri]] on April 29 and turned southwards into Arkansas. During the first part of May, Curtis and Steele encountered numerous logistical difficulties. Poor weather, difficult terrain, and lack of consistent resupply slowed their progress. But by May 9, Curtis' large, but ill-supplied, force had emerged from the [[Ozark]] foothills onto flat ground at [[Searcy, Arkansas|Searcy]]. It was poised to strike deep into central Arkansas and seize Little Rock itself as soon as supplies were gathered.&lt;ref name="EAHC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Action at Whitney's Lane|url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=2794|publisher=Encyclopedia of Arkansas History &amp; Culture|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major General Van Dorn left the state, but Brigadier General [[John Selden Roane|John S. Roane]] refused to go with him, declaring that Arkansas troops should be left to defend their state. Van Dorn detached Roane and left him in command of the Arkansas military, but with virtually no organized forces for the defense of the state. Roane approached Governor Rector for assistance in raising new forces. Rector told Roane to stop any troops passing through the state and use them for the state's defense. General Roane set to work immediately in cobbling together a defense to meet the approaching Union Army.  Roane stopped elements of the 12th Texas Cavalry that were bound for the eastern theaters and ordered troops who had made it as far as [[Memphis, Tennessee]] to turn around. Some attempts at recruiting local volunteers were made, but with little success. On May 10, Roane sent Texas cavalry as scouts to determine the federal position. The scouts encountered numerous refugees fleeing the Union Army. The refugees reported that the Union forces numbered about 30,000, mostly [[Germany|German]] immigrants. Hindman had approximately 1,200 Texas horsemen to confront this force. He ordered cotton stores near Searcy destroyed, and [[Governor of Arkansas|Governor]] [[Henry Massey Rector]] prepared government offices for evacuation. Meanwhile, small advance parties from the Union Army clashed with the Texas scouts between Searcy and Little Rock. On May 19, several companies of the Texas cavalry and a few local Arkansas companies achieved a small, but psychologically important victory over General Curtis's foraging parties at the [[Battle of Whitney's Lane]].&lt;ref name="EAHC"/&gt;

On May 1, 1862, Governor Rector, realizing that Major General [[Samuel Ryan Curtis|Samuel Curtis]]' army was on the way to capture Little Rock, abandoned the city and moved the state government to [[Hot Springs, Arkansas]]. For the first three weeks of May 1862, there was no military or state government in Little Rock. Roane traveled to Pine Bluff and enlisted the help of [[Arkansas Militia in the Civil War|Arkansas Militia]] Major General James Yell in recruiting a new Army of the Southwest in the [[Department of Arkansas]]. Yell was a "States Defense first" advocate and lent his power to aiding Roane along with [[Confederate States Senate|Senator]] [[Robert Ward Johnson|Robert W. Johnson]], also of Pine Bluff. These three men were the backbone of the newly reconstituted army of the [[Trans-Mississippi Department]]. In the meantime, Governor Rector sent dispatches to [[President of the Confederate States|President]] [[Jefferson Davis]] threatening to secede from the Confederacy unless Davis sent some sort of support. Davis' answer came in the form of the CSS ''Pontchartrain'' and CSS ''Maurepas'', which were dispatched to Little Rock. The state government did not return to Little Rock until the ''Pontchartrain'' arrived. A week later, on May 31, 1862, Major General [[Thomas C. Hindman]] arrived to take command from Roane and ordered all troops in Pine Bluff to Little Rock.&lt;ref&gt;Hindman, Thomas C., Trans-Mississippi Photo Archive, Accessed 2 January 2018, http://ozarkscivilwar.org/photographs/hindman-thomas-c/&lt;/ref&gt;

Hindman was dispatched to take command of what had been designated as the Confederate Department of the Trans-Mississippi.  When Hindman arrived, Union forces were still moving south from Batesville and threatening the state capitol of Little Rock.  Hindman found that his command was "bare of soldiers, penniless, defenseless, and dreadfully exposed" to the Federal Army that was approaching dangerously from the northwest.&lt;ref&gt;Neal (1997), p119.&lt;/ref&gt; He set to work and issued a series of harsh military edicts, instituting conscription, authorizing guerrilla warfare and requisitioning supplies for the defense of the State.&lt;ref&gt;Neal (1997), p127.&lt;/ref&gt;  With the assistance of the [[Texas]] troops diverted by General Roane, Hindman commenced a campaign of misinformation designed to mislead Federal authorities about the strength of the state's defenses.&lt;ref&gt;Neal (1997), p125.&lt;/ref&gt; Hindman sent a combined force of Texas troops and newly formed and hastily cobbled together Arkansas units to confront Curtis at the [[Battle of Cotton Plant]], on July 7, 1862. This series of events, combined with harassing tactics, confused the Federal authorities, causing them to fear that they did not have an adequate supply line to conquer the state and they soon diverted from a course towards the capital and instead moved to Helena to reestablish a solid supply line.&lt;ref&gt;Neal (1997), p131.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neal, Diane (1997).

Through rigorous enforcement of new Confederate conscription laws, Hindman was able to raise a new army in Arkansas in the summer of 1862. Hindman's tactics had questionable legal authority.  The Confederate Conscription Act of April 1862 had expressly forbid the raising of new units through conscription.  The intent of the law had been to provide replacements to the existing Confederate regiments in the field for the losses that they had already experienced through disease, desertion and battlefield loss.  Hindman's problem was that General Van Dorn had taken virtually every organized regiment in the state with him to Mississippi.  Hindman turned a blind eye to this legal challenge and began aggressively recruiting.  To encourage volunteers, Hindman announced that volunteer companies raised before a certain date would be allowed to elect their own officers, as was the custom, while conscript companies would have their officers appointed. Hindman did have a ready supply of experienced officers to help him in his reorganization. In early May 1862, Confederate forces in northern Mississippi underwent an army-wide reorganization due to the passage of the Conscription Act by the Confederate Congress in April 1862.&lt;ref&gt;UPTON, EMORY, Bvt.

Officers who did not choose to stand for re-election were also offered a discharge. The reorganization was accomplished among all the Arkansas regiments in and around Corinth, Mississippi, in May 1862. During its reorganization, a number of senior officers from the Arkansas regiments east of the Mississippi, such as Colonels [[James Fleming Fagan]], [[Robert G. Shaver]], and [[Alexander Travis Hawthorn]] resigned their original commands and returned to Arkansas and assisted Hindman in organizing new units in the summer of 1862.&lt;ref name="Arkansas Confederate Regimental Histories"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asms.k12.ar.us/armem/welch/ar_infy.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212052703/http://asms.k12.ar.us/armem/welch/ar_infy.htm |archivedate=December 12, 2007 |title=Arkansas Confederate Regimental Histories |publisher=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |accessdate=May 24, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hindman sent numerous requests for arms back across the Mississippi River. Many weapons were transferred to the Trans Mississippi District from Vicksburg in what became known as the "Fairplay Affair." A shipment of 18,000 arms were dispatched to Pine Bluff from Vicksburg, Miss. by way of Monroe, La., but 5,000 of those 18,000 were captured on the steamer ''Fair Play'' by Union forces, and 2,500 arms were redirected to Major-General [[Richard Taylor (general)|Richard Taylor]]'s army in Louisiana. Only 11,000 arms made it to Pine Bluff. These weapons had come from the arsenal of eastern Confederate states that had been returned to the state arsenals as the Confederates had re-equipped themselves with the better captured Union arms. Most of the guns were castoffs and unusable weapons from the various state armories which had been returned to the armories after the Confederate armies east of the Mississippi had been re-equipped from the "Battlefield Quartermaster" of Seven Days Battles, [[Second Manassas]] and Harper Ferry.&lt;ref name="Edward 2004"&gt;Doyle Taylor, [http://history-sites.com/cgi-bin/bbs53x/arcwmb/arch_config.pl?read=7391 "Re: Artillery Transfers"]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Arkansas in the Civil War Message Board, Posted 16 May 2004, Accessed 17 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arkansas secession convention, while drafting the new state constitution in 1861, had shortened the term of office for the governor from four years to two years.  This necessitated an election in the fall of 1862. Colonel [[Harris Flanagin]] of the [[2nd Arkansas Mounted Rifles]] was elected Governor of Arkansas.&lt;ref&gt;Harrell, John M., "Confederate Military History, a library of Confederate States Military History", Volume 10.2, Arkansas, Page 321, Accessed 1 August 2011, http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2001.05.0254%3Achapter%3D11%3Apage%3D321&lt;/ref&gt;  After he was recalled from active duty to take office, his administration dealt primarily with war-related measures and maintaining order and continuing government while undergoing an invasion.&lt;ref&gt;Yearns, W.

Hindman's aggressive tactics caused complaints that he was ruling by martial law, which led the Confederate government to send [[Lieutenant-General]] [[Theophilus H. Holmes]] to assume command of the new Department of the Trans-Mississippi.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Young, "General Thomas C. Hindman and Rep. Henry S. Foote", Army of Tennessee

Hindman led this new force, composed largely of conscripts, in an attempt to clear northwest Arkansas of Union forces. The offensive ended in defeat at the [[Battle of Prairie Grove]] in Northwest Arkansas on December 7, 1862.&lt;ref&gt;Hilderman, Walter C.

===1863===
The new year did not bring good news to Confederates in Arkansas. When the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] went into effect on January 1, 1863, Union forces occupied northwestern Arkansas. Local Union commanders, who had been aggressively enforcing the [[Confiscation Acts]] to grant freedom to slaves of rebel owners, put the Proclamation into effect immediately, freeing many slaves in the area.&lt;ref&gt;Ira Berlin et al., eds, ''Freedom: A Documentary History of Emancipation 1861–1867, Vol. 1: The Destruction of Slavery'' (Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 1985), p. 260&lt;/ref&gt; In 1862, the [[Confederate Army]] had constructed a massive defensive [[Earthworks (military)|earthwork]] at [[Arkansas Post]], on the Mississippi River, known as Fort Hindman. It was located on a bluff 25 feet above the river on the north bank, with a mile view up and downriver.  It was designed to prevent Union forces from going upriver to Little Rock, and to disrupt Union movement on the Mississippi.  On January 9–11 of 1863, Union forces conducted an [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious]] [[Battle of Arkansas Post (1863)|assault on the fortress]] backed by [[ironclad]] gunboats as part of the [[Vicksburg Campaign]]. Union forces outnumbered the defenders (33,000 to 5,500) and won an easy victory and capturing the post, with most of the Confederate garrison surrendering.&lt;ref name=encBattle&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?search=1&amp;entryID=525|title=Battle of Arkansas Post|author=Mark K.

The Battle of Fayetteville occurred on April 18, 1863, when Confederate General William Cabell attacked the federal outpost in Northwest Arkansas. It was a battle between Arkansas Confederates and Arkansas Unionists, a true civil war struggle. The attack was unsuccessful, and the Union forces under Colonial M. LaRue Harrison held the field at the end of the day. However, the attack exposed the weakness of the post, and Union troops were withdrawn in Missouri a week later.&lt;ref&gt;Mahan, Russell L. Fayetteville, Arkansas, in the Civil War. Historical Byways, Bountiful, Utah, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

General Hindman was transferred to a new command back east of the Mississippi in the Army of the Tennessee, leaving Holmes and Major General Sterling Price, of Missouri in command in Arkansas. Arkansas troops spent much of the winter and spring in camp near Little Rock. Under pressure from Richmond to attempt to relieve federal pressure on [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]], General Holmes moved his army across the state and attacked the Union supply depot at Helena. The Confederate attack was repulsed at the [[Battle of Helena]] on July 3, 1863, which is the same day that Vicksburg fell to Union forces.&lt;ref&gt;Bearss, Edwin C. "The Battle of Helena, July 4, 1863", Arkansas Historical Quarterly, Autumn, 1961, Vol. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; In late August, 1863, union forces from Indian Territory moved on Fort Smith and captured the city on September 1, 1863.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=35PHeA9YUxwC&amp;pg=PT251&amp;lpg=PT251&amp;dq=BATTLE+OF+DEVILS+BACKBONE+1,500+TROOPS&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BRjGNUYIC6&amp;sig=oWPENBIqg1m2_gHxGYadxn_MFEQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwBWoVChMIuImfruiOyAIVyTiICh1TpQCA#v=onepage&amp;q=BATTLE%20OF%20DEVILS%20BACKBONE%201%2C500%20TROOPS Kennedy, Frances H.

With the Union base at Helena now secure, [[Major general (United States)|Major-General]] [[Frederick Steele]] decided it was time to seize the state capitol at Little Rock. Price, commanding the District of Arkansas in place of Holmes, opposed Steele's advance with his cavalry forces while strengthening the northern approaches to the city. Clashes occurred at Brownsville, West Point, Harrison's Landing, Reed's Bridge, and Ashley's Mills (or Ferry Landing). Steele ultimately outflanked Price's defensive preparations by crossing the [[Arkansas River]] and attacking from the south side of the river. Confederate forces opposed this attack at the [[Battle of Bayou Fourche]], near the current Bill and Hillary Clinton International Airport on September 10, 1863. Ultimately, Price decided to abandon the city rather than risk being trapped in a siege operation. Confederate forces retreated to southwestern Arkansas and establish winter quarters. Governor Flanagin took the state archives and moved first to Arkadelphia, and then on to Washington in [[Hempstead County, Arkansas|Hempstead County]] where he set up a new capitol.&lt;ref&gt;Burford, Timothy Wayne, and Stephanie Gail McBride. The Division: Defending Little Rock, August 25–September 10, 1863. Jacksonville, AR: WireStorm Publishing, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fall of Little Rock Governor Flanagin ordered out the militia regiments of Clark, Hempstead, Sevier, Pike, Polk, Montgomery, La Fayette, Ouachita, Union, and Columbia counties and directed them to supply mounted companies for new regiments of State Troops. This recruiting method succeeded in supplying several new mounted companies which participated in resisting Union General Steele's Camden Expedition in the spring of 1864.  The fall of Little Rock provided the opportunity to create a new pro union state government.&lt;ref&gt;THE WAR OF THE REBELLION, THE OFFICIAL RECORD OF THE UNION AND CONFEDERATE ARMIES, SERIES I—VOLUME LIU, GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE, 1898, Page 901, Accessed May 11, 2011, https://books.google.com/books?id=XpM3AQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA901&amp;lpg=PA1019&amp;dq=Governor+Flanagin+appointed+Gordon+N.+Peay&amp;output=text#c_top&lt;/ref&gt;

===1864===
The fall of the capitol at [[Little Rock, Arkansas]] to Union troops in 1863 opened the door to the establishment of a new Union government under [[Isaac Murphy]] on April 18, 1864. The Murphy government would struggle to gain recognition from union authorities as the legitimate state government as President Lincoln and radical republicans in congress battled over terms to be imposed on seceded states. With the state capital and Fort Smith in Union control, Union leaders withdrew many Union forces from Arkansas to reinforce armies operating east of the Mississippi river, leaving the Murphy government powerless in areas beyond the reach of Union garrisons along the Arkansas river valley. Intense guerrilla warfare ensued in the virtual no-mans land north of the Arkansas River and into southern Missouri.&lt;ref&gt;Deblack, With Fire and Sword, 107-109&lt;/ref&gt;

The next major military action in Arkansas was the [[Camden Expedition]] (March 23 – May 2, 1864). Steele and his [[United States Army]] troops stationed at Little Rock and [[Fort Smith National Historic Site|Fort Smith]] were ordered to march to [[Shreveport, Louisiana]]. There, Steele was supposed to link up with a separate Federal [[amphibious warfare|amphibious]] expedition which was advancing up the [[Red River Valley]]. The combined Union force was then to strike into [[Texas]]. However, the two pincers never converged, and Steele's columns suffered terrible losses in a series of battles with Confederates led by Sterling Price and General [[Edmund Kirby Smith|E. Kirby Smith]] at the [[Battle of Marks' Mills]], [[Battle of Poison Spring]] and the [[Battle of Jenkins' Ferry]]. Ultimately Union forces managed to escape back to Little Rock where they basically remained for the duration of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Bearss, Edwin C. Steele's Retreat from Camden and the Battle of Jenkins' Ferry. Little Rock: Arkansas Civil War Centennial Commission, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

The victory by Confederates in the [[Red River Campaign]] and its Arkansas segment, the [[Camden Expedition]], opened a brief window of opportunity for Arkansas Confederates. Brigadier General [[Joseph O. Shelby]] was dispatched to northeast Arkansas with his cavalry brigade and began recruiting anew. Throughout the summer of 1864, Confederate strength in northeast Arkansas steadily grew with many men who had either deserted or become separated from their previous commands returning to Confederate service. The last formation of new Confederate units occurred during this time with the formation of the 45th through the 48th Arkansas Mounted Infantry units. Several existing Arkansas units were converted to mounted infantry and dispatched to northeast Arkansas.&lt;ref&gt;Howerton, Bryan, " 40th, 42nd, 46th and 48th Arkansas" Arkansas in the Civil War Message Board, Posted 1 August 2011, 9:10 pm, Accessed 2 August 2011, http://history-sites.com/cgi-bin/bbs53x/arcwmb/webbbs_config.pl?noframes;read=14623&lt;/ref&gt;

With these strengthened units, Shelby was able to seriously threaten vital Union lines of communication along the Arkansas River between Helena and Little Rock, and for a time it appeared that the Confederates would mount a serious attempt to retake the capitol in Little Rock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=1139&amp;type=Time+Period&amp;item=Civil+War+through+Reconstruction+(1861+-+1874)&amp;parent=&amp;grandparent=|title=Action at Ashley's Station|publisher=Encyclopedia of Arkansas|date=2014-11-18|accessdate=2015-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Confederate authorities in Richmond pressured Smith to dispatch some of his infantry to reinforce Confederate armies east of the Mississippi. This caused an uproar with the Arkansas confederate infantry units and, as a compromise, Smith approved a plan by Price to organize a large-scale raid into Missouri that would coincide with the November 1864 presidential election. Many Arkansas troops participated in the last Confederate offensive operation in the Trans-Mississippi Department, when Price led a [[Price's Raid|large cavalry raid]] into Missouri in the fall of 1864. Following Price's defeat at the [[Battle of Westport]] on October 23, most of the Arkansas cavalry units returned to the state and were furloughed for the remainder of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Sinisi, Kyle S.

===1865===
On April 9, 1865, the 3d Arkansas was among the regiments that surrendered with the Army of Northern Virginia at [[Appomattox, Virginia|Appomattox]]. The remnants of Patrick Cleburne's division of Arkansas troops surrendered with the Army of Tennessee at [[Bennett Place]] near [[Durham Station, North Carolina]] on April 26, 1865. The [[Jackson Light Artillery]] was among the last of the Confederate troops east of the Mississippi to surrender. The remnants of the Jackson Light Artillery aided in the defense of Mobile and surrendered with the Department of Alabama, Mississippi, and East Louisiana. The battery spiked its guns and surrendered at [[Meridian, Mississippi]] on May 11, 1865.&lt;ref&gt;Howerton, Bryan R., [http://www.couchgenweb.com/civilwar/jackson.html "Jackson Light Artillery (Thrall's Battery)"], Edward G. Gerdes Civil War Page, Accessed 30 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arkansas infantry regiments assigned to the Department of the Trans-Mississippi were surrendered on May 26, 1865.&lt;ref name="HB"&gt;Howerton, Bryan, [http://history-sites.com/cgi-bin/bbs53x/arcwmb/webbbs_config.pl?noframes;read=24472 "1st, 2nd &amp; 3rd Consolidated Arkansas Infantry Regiments"], Arkansas in the Civil War Message Board, Posted 26 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="confederate"&gt;Field, Ron, ''The Confederate Army, 1861–1865'' (4), Virginia &amp; Arkansas, Osprey Publishing, 2006, {{ISBN|978-1-84603-032-1}}, page 23&lt;/ref&gt; When the Trans-Mississippi Department surrendered, all of the Arkansas infantry regiments were encamped in and around [[Marshall, Texas]], since war-ravaged Arkansas was no longer able to provide adequate sustenance to the army. The regiments were ordered to report to [[Shreveport, Louisiana]] to be paroled. None of them did so. Some soldiers went to Shreveport on their own to be paroled, but the regiments simply disbanded without formally surrendering.&lt;ref&gt;Howerton, Bryan, [http://history-sites.com/cgi-bin/bbs53x/arcwmb/webbbs_config.pl?noframes;read=24907 "Re: 17th/1st/35th/22nd Arkansas Infantry Regiment."], Arkansas in the Civil War Message Board, Posted 26 October 2011, Accessed 26 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the Arkansas cavalry units were surrendered by Brigadier General [[M. Jeff Thompson]], Commander of the Army of the Northern Sub-District of Arkansas. General Thompson agreed to surrender his command at [[Chalk Bluff, Arkansas]] on May 11, 1865 and agreed to have his men assemble at [[Wittsburg, Arkansas|Wittsburg]] and [[Jacksonport, Arkansas]] to lay down their arms and receive their paroles. The cavalry units formally surrendered and were paroled at either Wittsburg on May 25 or at Jacksonport on June 5.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Howerton, Bryan R.

The [[United States government]] organized the [[Fort Smith Council]] at Fort Smith, Arkansas in September 1865. The purpose of the series of meetings was to discuss the future treaties and land allocations following the close of the American Civil War and involved [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian tribes]] east of the [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]].&lt;ref name="EOHC-FtSmithCouncil"&gt;[http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=FO041 Hartzog, Martha.

==Notable Confederate leaders from Arkansas==
Arkansans of note during the American Civil War include Confederate Major-General [[Patrick Cleburne]]. Considered by many to be one of the most brilliant Confederate [[division (military)|division]] commanders of the war, Cleburne is often referred to as "The Stonewall of the West."  Also of note is Major-General [[Thomas C. Hindman]], a former [[United States Representative]], who commanded Confederate forces at the [[Battle of Cane Hill]] and [[Battle of Prairie Grove]].

==Notable Union leaders from Arkansas==
Although Arkansas sided with the Confederacy, not all Arkansans supported the Confederate cause. Beginning with the fall of Little Rock to Union forces in 1863, Arkansans supporting the Union formed four infantry regiments, four cavalry regiments, and an artillery battery to serve in the [[United States Army]]. Additionally, six infantry regiments and one artillery battery of African Descent were attributed to the state. Later these units that were originally designated as the "1st-6th Arkansas Volunteers of African Descent" were re-designated as the 46th, 54th, 56th, 57th, 112th and 113th [[United States Colored Troops]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civilwararchive.com/unionar.htm Arkansas Union Army contributions]

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==The Peace Society==
In the fall of 1861, Confederate and State authorities became increasingly concerned about a shadowy organization in north-central Arkansas known as the Peace Society. The Peace Societies were largely union sympathizers who felt that the large slaveholding planters of southern Arkansas and the deep South had caused the war; they felt that they should be required to bear the burden of the conflict. Governor Rector ordered the 45th Arkansas Militia Regiment (Searcy County) to round up suspected Peace Society members in Searcy and [[Van Buren County, Arkansas|Van Buren]] counties.&lt;ref name="couchgenweb.com"&gt;Edward G. Gerdes Civil War Page, 45th Regiment Arkansas Militia., Accessed November 3, 2010, http://www.couchgenweb.com/civilwar/45milf&amp;s.html Archived September 1, 2009, at the Wayback Machine.&lt;/ref&gt; The militia spent the next few weeks identifying and apprehending suspected Peace Society members throughout the mountains of north-central Arkansas. Finally, in mid-December, the regiment "escorted" their prisoners to Little Rock, where most of them were forced into Confederate service.&lt;ref name="couchgenweb.com"/&gt;

==Restoration to Union==
After meeting the requirements of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], including ratifying amendments to the [[United States Constitution|US Constitution]] to abolish slavery and grant citizenship to former slaves, Arkansas's representatives were readmitted to Congress. The state was fully restored to the United States on June 22, 1868, becoming the second former Confederate state to gain readmission to the Union, but the first since Tennessee was readmitted in July 1866.&lt;ref&gt;Glass, Andrew, 'Arkansas readmitted to the Union, June 22, 1868', Politico, 06/22/2015, accessed 1 January 2018, https://www.politico.com/story/2015/06/arkansas-is-readmitted-to-the-union-june-22-1868-119258&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Beatriz González was born in [[Bucaramanga]], Colombia in 1938. She has described herself as always loving art and drawing a lot, but never thinking that would end up being her profession. In the late 1950s, she enrolled in architecture school, but she dropped out only a few years later.  González ended up enrolling in [[University of Los Andes (Colombia)]], graduating from their fine arts department in 1962.

González grew up in Colombia during the 1940s and 50s which was a very dark time in the history of Colombia. The country was plagued with violence and war that was due to the social and political upheaval that is known as [[La Violencia]]. Growing up during this time largely influenced González's understanding of Colombia society, and eventually even her artistic style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/ey-exhibition-world-goes-pop/artist-biography/beatriz-gonzalez|title=Beatriz González  {{!}} Tate|last=Tate|work=Tate|access-date=2017-11-17|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
González has drawn inspiration for her art from many different sources, specifically naming [[Johannes Vermeer]], [[Diego Velázquez]] and [[Antonio Molinari]] as inspirations when it comes to the use of colors and shapes.

Although González is often thought of and referred to as an artist of the pop art movement, she has never considered herself a pop artist. She often thought that the pop movement was not present in her preferred medium of painting and that it wouldn't be an appropriate label for the work she was doing. When asked if she had at any point considered herself a pop artist she responded with, "I’ve always considered myself more of a painter and within this remit I painted the joy of the underdeveloped. For me the type of art that I was doing could only circulate internationally as a curiosity. Mine was a provincial type of art without horizons, confronting the everyday: art is international."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/ey-exhibition-world-goes-pop/artist-interview/beatriz-gonzalez|title=Artist interview: Beatriz González {{!}} Tate|last=Tate|work=Tate|access-date=2017-12-01|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; She claims that all of the art she has done isn't "Pop", but in fact art that is a homage to her hometown of Bucaramanga and reflects its bold colors.

She has oftentimes been acknowledged for being a woman in a movement and country where a great deal of her peers were men, according to González, this has never been a problem for her and credits [[Marta Traba]] for encouraging the presence of woman in the Colombian art scene and states that she doesn't believe in the complex of the female artist who must be victimized.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1965 González created a painting entitled ''The Suicides of Sisga'', the painting was based on a picture of a young couple that had been published in a local newspaper after they jumped off the dam of the river Sisga in order to preserve the purity of their love. This work was initially refused at the 1965 Salon of Colombian Artists, disregarded and brushed off by the Jury as a "bad Botero". After one of González's friends and mentors, [[Marta Traba]] pressed the Jury to reconsider their decision, the painting was not only accepted, but Gonzáles won a special prize for her work, that eventually helped launch her career.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This painting is now known to reflect the impact of sensationalism of the national press of the creation of popular myths.

After accompanying her husband who is an architect to a hardware store in the 1970s, she began her work on various pieces of store-bought furniture that would generally be found in middle-class households earlier in the century. Typically she would take her images from well known Italian Renaissance and history paintings, or pictures from the present day news media, transferring these images onto cheap nightstands, chairs, coffee tables and beds painted by an amateur painter. She carefully coordinated her images with the furniture's function, such as painting the popes face on nightstands, conjuring up devotional images commonly found over beds or on nightstands in the average Colombian household.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Twentieth-Century Art of Latin America|last=Barnitz|first=Jacqueline|last2=Frank|first2=Patrick|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=282–283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985 González's work took a dramatic stylistic shift from its vibrant colors and shapes, to more dark imagery. This was after the M-19 guerrilla attack on the [[Palace of Justice siege|Palace of Justice]] in an attempt to try to president, they left 94 dead. Feeling that she couldn't laugh after that event, she began to explore themes of death and the drug trade as well as exploring some of Colombia's most tragic events.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Individual artworks ==

=== The Suicides of Sisga I, II and III ===
One of González's most well known and earliest works depicts a young couple standing holding hands with one other and a bouquet of flowers with a slight smile on their faces. This painting was based off a photo that originally appeared in the press of a couple who commissioned a professional photographer to take their portrait before jumping off the dam of the Sisga on the outskirts of Bogotá. The couple were two young farmers who were deeply in love, but in an effort to preserve the purity of their love, the man (who was suspected to be mentally insane) convinced his girlfriend to commit suicide as a way to show their religious devotion in not wanting to sully the woman's purity. The picture was sent to their families, and when the news broke it was widely reprinted in black and white in the local newspapers. González claimed that she was attracted to this picture due to its "bad quality" or more so its plain quality, the simplification of the facial features that were almost deformed by the discrepancy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This painting was the first of a number of paintings done by González in the 1960s in which she explored the intense violence in Colombia. During this time she produced a series of ink drawings on the same theme, that were tabloid photos of crimes of passion and political murders as well as advertisements for everything from bodybuilding to headache cures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/04/arts/art-review-a-wry-defiance-behind-garish-colors-and-tabloid-dramas.html|title=ART REVIEW; A Wry Defiance Behind Garish Colors and Tabloid Dramas|last=Cotter|first=Holland|date=1998-09-04|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-12-04|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== La última mesa (The Last Table) ===
This work was one of González's first furniture pieces out of her series of furniture works. It consisted of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s [[The Last Supper (Leonardo da Vinci)|Last Supper]] work that had been repainted onto metal sheets that were them mounted on a faux-wood dining table. González intentionally chose this particular work by da Vinci because of its popularity in Colombian culture, this image was commonly placed above the main entrance door as a good-luck charm against thieves.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This work along with many of the others out of her furniture works had the intention of being a "representation of representations"  not only through an effort to make universal art, but also to subvert the original function of the furniture itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Inverted Utopias|last=Ramírez|first=Mari Carmen|publisher=Yale University|year=2004|isbn=|location=Houston|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, she intentionally takes all of the shadows and duller colors that made this work more European, and animated it more in hopes of making it more uniquely Latin American.

=== Nací en Florencia (I was born in Florence) ===
The full title of this work is ''Nací en Florencia y tenía 26 años cuando fue pintado mi retrato (esta frase pronunciada en una voz dulce y baja)'', translated to ''I was born in Florence and was 26 years old when my portrait was painted (this phrase pronounced in a low, sweet voice).'' In this work, González placed her own painting of [[Leonardo da Vinci|da Vinci]]'s ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' where the mirror would be on a very large and elaborate antique coat rack. She used the location of the would be mirror to frame her work so when the viewers look at the work they see an image of beauty recreated in a cheap, reproduced style. The long title of the work is in an additional effort to reveal its humorous and a potentially slightly erotic intent.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== ''Canción de cuna (Lullaby)'' ===
This work consisted of an image of a mother holding her child that was based on a picture that was widely printed and distributed by a printing company in Colombia. The painting was painted on a sheet of metal that was then mounted on the inside of a crib that González found in the streets of Bogóta that originally belonged to a hospital. The theme of mother and child was one that commonly occurred in her artwork thus turning González herself into an image of maternity and hints at her observations about woman in the social structure of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.moma.org/collection/works/125437?artist_id=36415&amp;locale=en&amp;sov_referrer=artist|title=Beatriz González.

{{Anthropology of kinship |terms}}
{{main|Kinship}}

'''Classificatory kinship''' systems, as defined by [[Lewis Henry Morgan]], put people into society-wide [[kinship]] classes on the basis of abstract relationship rules. These may have to do with [[genealogy|genealogical]] relations locally (e.g., son to father, daughter to mother, daughter to father) but the classes bear no overall relation to genetic closeness. If a total stranger marries into the society, for example, they may simply be placed in the appropriate class opposite to their spouse.
It uses kinship terms that merge or equate relatives who are genealogically distinct from one another. Here, the same term is used for different kin.

The [[Kinship terminology|Dravidian kinship-term]] system, discovered in 1964, is an example of a classificatory kin-term logic.

'''Cognitive humor processing''' refers to the [[neural circuitry]] and pathways that are involved in detecting [[Theories of humor|incongruities]] of various situations presented in a humorous manner. Over the past decade, many studies have emerged utilizing [[fMRI]] studies to describe the [[neural correlate]]s associated with how a human processes something that is considered "funny". Conceptually, [[humor]] is subdivided into two elements: cognitive and affective. The [[cognitive]] element, known as humor detection, refers to understanding the [[joke]]. Usually, this is characterized by the perceiver attempting to comprehend the disparities between the [[punch line]] and prior experience. The [[affect (psychology)|affective element]], otherwise known as humor appreciation, is involved with enjoying the joke and producing visceral, emotional responses depending on the hilarity of the joke.&lt;ref name="Neural Correlates of humor detection and appreciation"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moran|first=Joseph M |author2=Wig, Adams |author3=Janata, Kelley|title=Neural Correlates of humor detection and appreciation|journal=NeuroImage|date=October 2003|volume=21|issue=3|pages=1055–1060|pmid=15006673|accessdate=25 September 2013|url=http://apps.webofknowledge.com/full_record.do?product=UA&amp;search_mode=GeneralSearch&amp;qid=10&amp;SID=3FltQSd7NTvTqSXsbqL&amp;page=1&amp;doc=1|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2003.10.017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ability to comprehend and appreciate humor is a vital aspect of social functioning and is a significant part of the human condition that is relevant from a very early age. Humor comprehension develops in parallel with growing cognitive and [[language|language skills]] during childhood, while its content is mostly influenced by social and cultural factors. A further approach is described which refers to humor as an attitude related to [[stress (psychological)|strains]]. Humorous responses when confronted with troubles are discussed as a skill often associated with high social competence. The concept of humor has also been shown to have therapeutic effects, improving physiological systems such as the [[immune]] and [[central nervous system]]. It also has been shown to help cope with stress and pain. In sum, humor proves to be a personal resource throughout the life span, and helps support the  coping of everyday tasks.&lt;ref name="Humor and development: a review"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wicki|first=Werner|title=Humor and development: a review|journal=Zeitschrift für Entwicklungspsychologie und Pädagogische Psychologie|year=2000|volume=32|issue=4|pages=173–185|doi=10.1026/0049-8637.32.4.173|accessdate=25 September 2013|url=http://psycontent.metapress.com/content/e6862qp17w861521/?genre=article&amp;id=doi%3a10.1026%2f%2f0049-8637.32.4.173|doi-broken-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The understanding of humor, humor production, and functionality of humor, evolves in the course of a lifetime and is essentially determined by cognitive, verbal and social abilities. Differences in humor appreciation are seen between individuals and can be attributed to the development of the neural systems underlying humor cognition during early childhood, which can continue through [[aging brain|normal aging]].&lt;ref name="Children's appreciation of humor"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zigler|first=Edward|author2=Jacob Levine |author3=Laurence Gould |title=Cognitive processes in the development of children's appreciation of humor|journal=Society for Research in Child Development|date=September 2013|volume=37|pages=507–518|pmid=5970573|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent investigations have emphasized the importance of the [[prefrontal cortex]] for humor processing. Changes to the prefrontal cortex, a consequence of normal aging, can be traced to changes in the ways individuals appreciate humor.

===Early age===
The cognitive component of humor is clearly exemplified during the years of childhood, which is characterized by evolving cognitive structures. As a child advances from one degree of cognition to the next, what is considered humorous and what is not should also manifest a meaningful progression.&lt;ref name="Neural Correlates in Children"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Neely|first=Michelle|author2=Elizabeth Walker |author3=Jessica Black |author4=Allan Reiss |title=Neural Correlates of Humor Detection and Appreciation in Children|journal=The Journal of Neuroscience|date=February 2012|volume=32|series=5|pages=1784–1790|pmid=22302817|doi=10.1523/jneurosci.4172-11.2012 |issue=5 |pmc=3711814}}&lt;!--|accessdate=5 November 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Understanding any particular joke may call upon an array of cognitive processes such as [[condensation (psychology)|condensations]], awareness of incongruities (the cognitive component), and the ability to comprehend unusual verbal representations. The intrinsic gratification involved in the brain activity underlying humor is also encountered in mental activities such as solving puzzles and decoding mysteries.

====Mirth response test====
In September 1966 a study was conducted concerning the effects of cognition on humor comprehension during the [[child development|learning years]] of a child.&lt;ref name="Children's appreciation of humor" /&gt; The experimenters concluded that there was a positive relation between the mirth response and the degree of comprehension. Mirth is defined as any expression that reflects amusement, especially in the form of laughter. This study implied that the human's ability to comprehend text-based and visual information at a higher level resulted in a higher probability of joke or cartoon appreciation. Children from grades 2-5 were the subjects of this study. Results showed a strong positive correlation between grade level and comprehension; however the mirth response nose dives dramatically after fourth grade. This discrepancy can be explained by the principal of cognitive congruency, which states that fewer cognitive demands will elicit a lower mirth response than those that are in keeping with the complexity of the child's cognitive apparatus. Basically, if the cartoon is deemed "dumb", then they will not give a mirth response.

[[File:Frontal lobe animation.gif|thumb|Frontal lobe animation|Frontal lobe -- medial cut]]

===Normal aging===
The [[memory and aging|frontal aging hypothesis]] suggests that the prefrontal cortex is particularly vulnerable to the effects of aging and implies that functions supported by the frontal lobes will be disproportionately impaired. The volume of the frontal cortex and its pronounced age-related alterations in the [[5-HT2]] and [[D2 receptor]] availability are the basis for this hypothesis and point to the impairment of [[executive functions]] including [[working memory]], inhibition, and planning.&lt;ref name="Normal Aging"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Uekermann|first=Jennifer|author2=Shelley Channon |author3=Irene Daum |title=Humor processing, mentalizing, and executive function in normal aging|journal=Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society|year=2006|volume=12|pages=184–191|pmid=16573852|doi=10.1017/s1355617706060280|issue=2}}&lt;!--|accessdate=5 November 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The ways in which executive functions were measured to testify the age-related decreases in [[frontal lobe]] activity with humor comprehension included three assessors: inhibition, set shifting, and working memory. It is seen across several studies that older adults have the capability of selecting the proper punchline of a joke in comparison to  younger adults, but they are shown to select a lot fewer total selections. Older adults made more choices of logical alternatives and even showed a tendency to select more [[slapstick|slapstick humor]].&lt;ref name="Normal Aging" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Humor and aging-review"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Greengross|first=Gil|title=Humor and aging-a Mini-Review|journal=Journal of Gerontology|date=January 2013|volume=56|issue=5|doi=10.1159/000351005|pmid=23689078|pages=448–453}}&lt;!--|accessdate=18 November 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Old age and pathology===
Though there are many studies about the developmental aspects of humor, from infancy through adolescence and adulthood, relatively little research is devoted to the study of humor with elderly (65+) populations.&lt;ref name="Humor and aging-review" /&gt;  The small pool of research out there devoted to the [[geriatrics|geriatric]] effect on humor cognition suggests that elderly people enjoy humor more than younger people, but they have increasing difficulties in understanding jokes. In other words, the humor appreciation component for older people is more active, but the mechanisms devoted to detection are lacking. Also, the amount of laughter exhibited by the elderly is smaller compared to young adults. In addition, the older population seems to not enjoy aggressive types of humor as much as the younger ones, and the elderly are especially sensitive to jokes referring to old age.&lt;ref name="Normal Aging" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Humor and aging-review" /&gt; 
It is interesting to point out the "see-saw" effect aging has in terms of the brain mechanisms underlying humor. Despite the apparent decreases in the cognitive component of humor understanding, the affective element remains steady, if not more refined and enhanced. The greater [[bilateral activation]] older adults have during cognitively demanding tasks may describe the reasons older adults seem to struggle with jokes that are graded at a higher comprehension difficulty.&lt;ref name="Neural Correlates of humor detection and appreciation" /&gt;  Of course, [[cohort effect]]s might play a role in an older adult's capacity to understand jokes. Perhaps several cultural factors that remain in the [[unconscious mind|unconscious]] thinking processes are critical in understanding meaning behind some jokes.

====Parkinson's disease====
The [[neocortex]], [[basal ganglia]], [[diencephalon]], and [[limbic system]] are affected by [[Parkinson's Disease]] and are also brain areas underlying the cognitive processes of humor detection and appreciation.&lt;ref name="Parkinson's"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thaler|first=Avnin|title=Appreciation of humor is decreased among patients with Parkinson's disease|journal=Parkinsonism &amp; Related Disorders|date=June 2011|volume=18|pages=144–148|pmid=22000944|doi=10.1016/j.parkreldis.2011.09.004|issue=2}}&lt;!--|accessdate=18 November 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A few studies have confirmed that patients with Parkinson's have a lower appreciation for humor as indicated by sense of humor questionnaires. This relationship is seen across multiple presentation styles including video, audio, and cartoon. Primarily, the affective part of humor, otherwise known as humor appreciation, is the main victim of PD-related brain changes. This could be linked to consequential neurological changes in the [[amygdala]], [[reward system|mesolimbic dopaminergic reward system]], and basal ganglia. Parkinson's patients demonstrate an inhibited ability to identify emotions of other people from both [[prosody (linguistics)|speech prosody]] and facial expressions.&lt;ref name="Parkinson's" /&gt;  The neural circuitry during the humor appreciation phase also involves the amygdala and are thought to be used during the recollection of emotional memories. The therapeutic capabilities of humor could prove to be fruitful for patients with Parkinson's disease, so it is important to identify the mechanisms underlying both humor detection and appreciation.

==Mechanisms==
Recent fMRI studies have begun to elucidate the cognitive and affective neural correlates associated with humor processing. But these correlates, corresponding to the stages of humor detection and humor appreciation respectively, fail to distinguish between these different logical mechanisms. A medley of studies have started to investigate the differences between these steps in humor processing and the [[biological neural network|neural circuitry]] that underlie these mechanisms.&lt;ref name="Mechanisms-nonverbal cartoons"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Samson|first=Andrea|author2=Stefan Zysset |author3=Oswald Huber |title=Cognitive Humor Processing: Different logical mechanisms in nonverbal cartoons-an fMRI study|journal=Journal of Social Neuroscience|year=2008|volume=3|series=2|pages=125–140|pmid=18633854|doi=10.1080/17470910701745858|issue=2|url=https://archive-ouverte.unige.ch/unige:98092|type=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;!--|accessdate=5 November 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The pun-intended phrase "the right hemisphere has the last laugh" has been adopted by scientists in this field due to its significance during appreciation, but it is widely accepted that humor appreciation and detection rely on neural circuitry from [[temporal lobe|temporal]] and [[prefrontal cortex|prefrontal]] regions from both hemispheres. These brain areas also contribute to humor processing in three distinct [[spatiotemporal stages]]: surface level semantic analysis and two phases of the interpretative integrative processes. The surface level semantic analysis is subserved by bilateral anterior temporal and left inferior prefrontal regions. Interpretive integrative processing comprises detection of ambiguity or conflict between the dominant semantic representations of the punch line and the context, which is reflected in semantic, phonological, metaphorical, and other supralinguistic integrations of the punch line with the preceding sentence.&lt;ref name="Right hemisphere"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marinkovich|first=Ksenija|title=Right hemisphere has the last laugh: neural dynamics of joke appreciation|journal=Springer|date=December 2010|volume=11|pages=113–130|pmid=21264646|doi=10.3758/s13415-010-0017-7|issue=1|pmc=3047694}}&lt;!--|accessdate=18 November 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In regards to the detection process, the [[right medial temporal gyrus]] is active during detection of semantic violations, and the [[right middle frontal gyrus]] is active for context monitoring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chan|first=Yu-chen|title=Towards a neural circuit model of verbal humor processing: An fMRI study of the neural substrates of incongruity detection and resolution|journal=NeuroImage|date=October 2012|volume=66|pages=169–176|pmid=23103517|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.10.019}}&lt;!--|accessdate=18 November 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The three distinct stages of neural activation during the humor process implies that humor detection and appreciation operate as separate entities and engage different brain regions in an ordered fashion. Therefore, the cascade of neural events required to understand and appreciate humor can be functionally separated, and studies have shown this distinction to be consistent across all genres of comedy.&lt;ref name="Neural Correlates of humor detection and appreciation" /&gt; During moments of humor detection, significant activation can be seen in the [[left posterior middle
temporal gyrus]] and [[left inferior frontal gyrus]]. During moments of humor appreciation, increased activation in bilateral regions of [[insular cortex]] and [[amygdala]] can be observed.

[[File:Parahippocampal gyrus animation.gif|thumb|Parahippocampal gyrus animation]]

===Verbal===
The verbal medium through which humor can be conveyed elicits a theory separate from the popular [[Theories of humor|incongruity-resolution theory]]. The comprehension-elaboration theory is not much different from the incongruity-resolution theory, however it accounts for several incongruities found in language that are not considered humorous. Corrected misunderstandings, scientific discoveries, and silent responses to ‘bad jokes’ all present incongruity-resolution characteristics, but do not generate humor.&lt;ref name="verbal jokes"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chan|first=Yu-Chen |author2=Tai-Li Chou |author3=Hsueh-Chih Chen |author4=Keng-Chen Liang|title=Segregating the comprehension and elaboration processing of verbal jokes-an fMRI study|journal=NeuroImage|date=March 2012|pages=899–906|pmid=22472220|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.03.052|volume=61|issue=4}}&lt;!--|accessdate=5 November 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the comprehension–elaboration theory of humor, comprehension refers to the detection and resolution of incongruities. The elaboration follows comprehension, involves the conscious generation of inferences for features not made explicit during comprehension, and elicits the unconscious or conscious feeling of amusement. Studies utilizing [[fMRI]] have shown that, like the incongruity-resolution theory, the comprehension-elaboration theory can be separated into two distinct neurological schedules of activity. During comprehension, greater activation in the [[left dorsal inferior frontal gyrus]], [[left superior frontal gyrus]], and [[left ventral stratum]] can be seen. During elaboration, the [[left ventromedial prefrontal gyrus]], bilateral amygdala, and bilateral [[parahippocampal gyrus]] show greater activity.&lt;ref name="Neural Correlates of humor detection and appreciation" /&gt;&lt;ref name="verbal jokes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Verbal jokes 2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chan|first=Yu-Chen|title=Towards a neural circuit model of verbal humor processing: An fMRI study of the neural substrates of incongruity detection and resolution|journal=NeuroImage|date=March 2012|volume=66|pages=169–176|pmid=23103517|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.10.019}}&lt;!--|accessdate=18 November 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-verbal===
Studies have shown that a wide area around the [[temporoparietal junction]] ([[temporo-occipital junction]], [[posterior superior temporal sulcus]], [[posterior middle temporal gyrus]]), [[temporal pole]] and [[inferior frontal gyrus]] (IFG) is involved in cognitive humor processing of nonverbal cartoons.&lt;ref name=nonverbal&gt;{{cite journal|last=Samson|first=Andrea|title=Cognitive humor processing: Different logical mechanisms in nonverbal cartoons*an fMRI study|journal=Psychology Press|year=2008|volume=3|series=2|pages=125–140|pmid=18633854|doi=10.1080/17470910701745858|issue=2|url=https://archive-ouverte.unige.ch/unige:98092|type=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;!--|accessdate=18 November 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Studies in recent years have revealed discrete characteristic patterns of cerebral [[blood-oxygen-level dependent]] activity induced by non-verbal cartoons with different logical mechanisms. The TPJ is involved in successful incongruity resolution but not in the detection of incongruity. The [[extrastriate cortex]] is activated particularly during processing of visual puns, whereas semantic cartoons evoked activity mainly in the TPJ and [[precuneus]]. The TPJ and precuneus areas are known to be involved in [[mentalization|mentalizing]] and are more strongly activated during processing of [[Theory of Mind]] cartoons compared to [[visual pun]]s and semantic cartoons.&lt;ref name=nonverbal /&gt;

The '''Constitutional Right Party''' ({{lang-fi|Perustuslaillinen Oikeistopuolue}}, {{lang-sv|Konstitutionella högerpartiet}}, from 1973 to 1980  '''Constitutional People's Party''' ({{lang-fi|Perustuslaillinen Kansanpuolue}}, {{lang-sv|Konstitutionella Folkpartiet}}). ) was an [[anticommunist]] [[political party]] in [[Finland]]. The party was founded in 1973 by the parliamentarian [[Varatuomari|Master in Law]] [[Georg C. Ehrnrooth]] as an anticommunist split from the [[Swedish People's Party of Finland|Swedish People's Party]] (SFP).

The party had around 4,000 members.&lt;ref name="ge"/&gt; The party was founded as a response to SFP and the only major right-wing party, [[National Coalition Party (Finland)|National Coalition]], backing the re-election of President [[Urho Kekkonen]] by [[emergency law]], simply for convenience and despite the lack of any national emergency. Ehrnrooth saw this as a sign of [[Finlandization]], and held that the constitution was being circumvented and the people left out of the process.

The party contested the [[Finnish parliamentary election, 1975|1975 parliament election]], obtaining 1.6% of the national vote and winning one seat. In the [[Finnish parliamentary election, 1979|1979 parliament election]] the party won 1.2% of the votes but no seat.&lt;ref name="ge"&gt;Wende, Frank. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=wZ2HAAAAMAAJ Lexikon zur Geschichte der Parteien in Europa]''. Stuttgart: Kröner, 1981.  p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; The most seats the party ever held were two (1973–75 and 1986–87), although in both cases, one seat was gained by a defection.

At the [[Finnish presidential election, 1978]], the party supported Ahti Salonen, a social democrat critical of Kekkonen and SDP's support of Kekkonen. At the [[Finnish presidential election, 1982|1982 election]], however, the party supported [[Mauno Koivisto]], in order to ensure [[Ahti Karjalainen]], whom they regarded as too Soviet-friendly, would not succeed as a '[[dark horse]]'.

Constitutional Right Party was the only Finnish political party which openly rallied Finland for joining the [[European Economic Community]] in 1988.

Constitutional Right Party rallied every 17 July in a big numbers because that date was the day when Finland got its Republican-based governmental basic rule in 1919.

The '''Current Population Survey''' ('''CPS''')&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.census.gov/cps/ Current Population Survey (CPS) Main Page] at census.gov&lt;/ref&gt; is a monthly [[Statistical survey|survey]] of about 60,000 U.S. households conducted by the [[United States Census Bureau]] for the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] (BLS). The BLS uses the data to publish reports early each month called the Employment Situation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stats.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.toc.htm Employment Situation] at bls.gov&lt;/ref&gt; This report provides estimates of the [[unemployment rate in the United States|unemployment rate]] and the numbers of employed and [[unemployment|unemployed]] people in the United States based on the CPS. A readable Employment Situation Summary&lt;ref&gt;[http://stats.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm Employment Situation Summary] at bls.gov&lt;/ref&gt; is provided monthly.  Annual estimates include employment and unemployment in large metropolitan areas. Researchers can use some CPS [[microdata (statistics)|microdata]] to investigate these or other topics.

The survey asks about the employment status of each member of the household 15 years of age or older as of the calendar week containing the 12th day of the month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/respondents/cps/faqs.htm |title=Frequently Asked Questions for CPS Survey Participants |publisher=Bls.gov |date=September 23, 2011 |accessdate=2013-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on responses to questions on work and job search activities, each person 16 years and over in a sample household is classified as employed, unemployed, or not in the labor force.

The CPS began in 1940, and responsibility for conducting the CPS was given to the Census Bureau in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/opub/hom/pdf/homch1.pdf Chapter 1: Labor Force Data Derived from the Current Population Survey], ''BLS Handbook of Methods''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994 the CPS was redesigned. CPS is a survey that is: employment-focused, enumerator-conducted, continuous, and cross-sectional. The BLS increased the sample size by 10,000 as of July 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsjul2001.pdf |title=Expansion of the Current Population Survey Sample Effective July 2001 |publisher=Bls.gov |accessdate=2013-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sample represents the [[civilian noninstitutional population]].

==Methodology==
Approximately 60,000 households are eligible for the CPS. Sample households are selected by a multistage stratified [[statistical sampling]] scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dsc.ucsf.edu/main.php?name=cps |title=UCSF – Disability Statistics Center – Current Population Survey (CPS) |publisher=Dsc.ucsf.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-10-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717102721/http://dsc.ucsf.edu/main.php?name=cps |archivedate=July 17, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A household is interviewed for 4 successive months, then not interviewed for 8 months, then returned to the sample for 4 months after that. An adult member of each household provides information for all members of the household.

As part of the demographic sample survey redesign,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Census Bureau: Survey Sample Redesign|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/OMB/expectmore/summary/10001178.2003.html|website=Expectmore.gov|accessdate=August 5, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021144713/http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/OMB/expectmore/summary/10001178.2003.html|archive-date=October 21, 2014|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the CPS is redesigned once a decade, after the decennial census. The most recent CPS sample redesign began in April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Redesign of the Sample for the Current Population Survey|url=http://www.bls.gov/cps/sample_redesign_2014.pdf|website=bls.gov|accessdate=August 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Employment classification==
[[Image:US Seasonal Unemployment.svg|thumb|right|400px|Unemployment rate as a percentage of the civilian labor force in the United States according to the U.S. [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] showing the variation across the states&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=ftp://ftp.bls.gov/pub/time.series/la/la.txt|title=Bureau of Labor Statistics, Employment status of the civilian noninstitutional population|date=November 2010}}{{dead link|date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
People are classified as employed if they did any work at all as paid employees during the reference week; worked in their own business, profession, or on their own farm; or worked without pay at least 15 hours in a family business or farm.  People are also counted as employed if they were temporarily absent from their jobs because of illness, bad weather, vacation, [[labour (economics)|labor]]-management disputes, or personal reasons.
 
People are classified as unemployed if they meet all of the following criteria: 
* They were not employed during the reference week
* They were available for work at that time
* They made specific efforts to find employment during the 4-week period ending with the reference week. (The exception to this category covers persons laid off from a job and expecting recall)

The unemployment data derived from the household survey in no way depend upon the eligibility for or receipt of unemployment insurance benefits.

Those who are not classified as employed or unemployed are not counted as part of the labor force. These people—those who have no job and are not looking for one—are counted as "not in the labor force". Many who are not in the labor force are going to school or are retired. Family responsibilities keep others out of the labor force. "[[Discouraged worker]]s" are a subset of those who are "not in the labor force".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/cps/faq.htm#Ques3 |title=Current Population Survey Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Bls.gov |date=April 18, 2011 |accessdate=2013-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1994 revisions==
As a result of research that started in 1986, a complete overhaul of how the CPS was administered and what type of questions were asked occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Cathryn S. Dippo, Donna L. Kostanich, and Anne E. Polivka (1994). "EFFECTS OF METHODOLOGICAL CHANGE IN THE CURRENT POPULATION SURVEY". Proceedings of the Survey Research Methods Section IV. Current Population Survey (CPS) Redesign: Parallel Testing Results of Old and New Questionnaire and Collection Methodology. [http://www.amstat.org/sections/SRMS/proceedings/papers/1994_039.pdf], American Statistical Association.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to 1994, the alternate measures of unemployment had different names because the BLS drastically revised the questions in the CPS and renamed the measures: U3 and U4 were eliminated; the official rate U5 remained the same measure but was renamed U3; U6 and U7 were revised and renamed U5 and U6.&lt;ref&gt;John E. Bregger and Steven E. Haugen (1995). "BLS introduces new range of alternative unemployment measures" Monthly Labor Review, October: 19–29. [http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/1995/10/art3full.pdf], U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, retrieved March 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

CPS alternate measures of unemployment before 1994:
* U-1 Persons unemployed 15 weeks or longer, as a percent of the civilian labor force
* U-2 Job losers, as a percent of the civilian labor force
* U-3 Unemployed persons aged 25 and older, as a percent of the civilian labor force aged 25 and older (the unemployment rate for persons 25 and older)
* U-4 Unemployed persons seeking full-time jobs, as a percent of the full-time labor force (the unemployment rate for full-time workers)
* U-5 Total unemployed persons, as a percent of the civilian labor force (official unemployment rate)
* U-6 Total persons seeking full-time jobs, plus one-half of persons seeking part-time jobs, plus one-half of persons employed part-time for economic reasons, as a percent of the civilian labor force less one-half of the part-time labor force
* U-7 Total persons seeking full-time jobs, plus one-half of persons seeking part-time jobs, plus one-half of persons employed part-time for economic reasons, plus discouraged workers, as a percent of the civilian labor force plus discouraged workers less one-half of the part-time labor force

CPS alternate measures of unemployment after 1994:
* U-1 Persons unemployed 15 weeks or longer, as a percent of the civilian labor force
* U-2 Job losers and persons who completed temporary jobs, as a percent of the civilian labor force
* U-3 Total unemployed, as a percent of the civilian labor force (official unemployment rate)
* U-4 Total unemployed plus discouraged workers, as a percent of the civilian labor force plus discouraged workers
* U-5 Total unemployed, plus discouraged workers, plus all other marginally attached workers, as a percent of the civilian labor force plus all marginally attached workers
* U-6 Total unemployed, plus all marginally attached workers, plus total employed part-time for economic reasons, as a percent of the civilian labor force plus all marginally attached workers

Marginally attached workers are persons who currently are neither working nor looking for work but indicate that they want and are available for a job and have looked for work in the recent past. In addition, marginally attached workers have actively sought work in the past 12 months (e.g. they replied to a "wanted" ad) but have not actively sought work in the past 4 weeks.

Discouraged workers, a subset of the marginally attached, have given a job-market related reason for not currently looking for a job (e.g. they believe that no work was available). This group is about 50 percent smaller than the marginally attached group."&lt;ref&gt;John E. Bregger and Steven E. Haugen (1995). "BLS introduces new range of alternative unemployment measures" Monthly Labor Review, October: p. 26. [http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/1995/10/art3full.pdf], U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, retrieved March 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Persons employed part-time for economic reasons are those who want and are available for full-time work but have had to settle for a part-time schedule.

==Data available==
The CPS reports:
* Employment status of the civilian noninstitutional population 16 years and over by age, sex, race, Hispanic origin, marital status, family relationship, and Vietnam-era veteran status.
* Employed persons by occupation, industry, and class of worker, hours of work, full- or part-time status, and reasons for working part-time.
* Employed multiple jobholders by occupation, industry, numbers of jobs held, and full- or part-time status of multiple jobs.
* Unemployed persons by occupation, industry, class of worker of last job, duration of unemployment, reason for unemployment, and methods used to find employment.
* Discouraged workers and other persons not in the labor force.
* Special topics such as the labor force status of particular subgroups of the population (e g., women maintaining families, working women with children, displaced workers, and disabled veterans).
* Work experience, occupational mobility, job tenure, educational attainment, and school enrollment of workers.
* Information on weekly and hourly earnings by detailed demographic group, occupation, education, union affiliation, and full- and part-time employment status.
The survey also reports the labor force participation rate, which is the labor force as a percentage of the population, and the ratio of the employed to the total population of the United States.

Although the primary purpose of the CPS is to record employment information, the survey fulfills a secondary role in providing [[demographics|demographic]] information about the United States population. CPS [[microdata (statistics)|microdata]] for the period since 1962 are freely available through the [[Integrated Public Use Microdata Series]].

==CPS Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC)- the March Supplement==
Since 1948, the CPS has included supplemental questions (at first, in April; later, in March) on income received in the previous calendar year, which are used to estimate the data on income and work experience.  These data are the source of the annual Census Bureau report on income, poverty, and health insurance coverage.

Other regular or occasional survey supplement topics, in various months and years, have included after-tax money income, benefits that are not cash, displaced workers, job tenure, occupational mobility, temporary and contingent work, adult education, volunteering, tobacco use, food availability, fertility, and information about veterans.

'''Escape Cliffs''' is a locality on the northern coast of the [[Northern Territory]] of [[Australia]] and the site of the fourth of a series of four failed attempts to establish permanent settlement in Australia’s [[Top End]].  Escape Cliffs lies on the western coast of the Cape Hotham peninsula, and the eastern shore of Adam Bay, near the mouth and estuary of the [[Adelaide River]].  It lies about 60&amp;nbsp;km north-east of [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] and is protected in the Cape Hotham sector of the [[Djukbinj National Park]].  There is no road access, though it is sometimes visited by yachts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dwnsail.com.au/images/documents/Escape%20Cliff%20Article.pdf |title=Escape Cliff |accessdate=2012-05-14 |work= |first= |last= |publisher=Darwin Sailing Club |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Escape Cliffs Northern Territory, looking north east.jpeg|thumb|Escape Cliffs Northern Territory, looking north east]]
In 1864, the year after [[South Australia]] was granted control over the Northern Territory, the [[Government of South Australia|South Australian government]] decided that settlement of the area was desirable and sent a surveying and settlement expedition under the command of former [[Premiers of the Australian states|state Premier]] Lieutenant Colonel [[B.T. Finniss|Boyle Travers Finniss]].  He had been instructed to establish the settlement at Adam Bay and chose the Escape Cliffs site despite disagreements with other members of his party.  It was intended to cover settlement costs through sales of land, much of which had already been presold to speculators and intending settlers even before the expedition reached the site and began their survey work. &lt;ref name=lc&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.litchfield.nt.gov.au/index.php?page=escape-cliffs |title=Escape Cliffs: Initial Settlement and Exploration |accessdate=2012-05-14 |work= |first= |last= |publisher=Litchfield Council |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a confused start, following an abortive initial move to another site some 65&amp;nbsp;km up the Adelaide River, the establishment work at Escape Cliffs began. Problems included conflicts with the local [[Australian Aborigines|Marananggu people]] and the unsuitability of the land for agriculture, exacerbated by personality clashes and resulting in ongoing disputes and deteriorating morale.  Following complaints and unfavourable reports to the South Australian government, Finniss was recalled in 1865.  Escape Cliffs was eventually abandoned in 1867, two years before the ultimately successful settlement at Port Darwin.&lt;ref name=lc/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17084">The '''ethics involved within pharmaceutical sales''' is built from the [[organizational ethics]], which is a matter of system compliance, accountability and culture (Grace &amp; Cohen, 2005). Organizational ethics are used when developing the marketing and sales strategy to both the public and the healthcare profession of the strategy.&lt;ref name="NYT-20151127"&gt;{{cite news |author=The Editorial Board |title=Turn the Volume Down on Drug Ads |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/27/opinion/turn-the-volume-down-on-drug-ads.html |date=November 27, 2015 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=November 27, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizational ethics are best demonstrated through acts of fairness, compassion, integrity, honor, and responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=|title=Example of organizational ethics|last=Suttle|first=Rick|date=2016|website=smallbusiness.chron.com|publisher=Houston Chronicle|access-date=March 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Industry ==
The pharmaceutical industry is a highly competitive business and its success is dependent on the sales and marketing of each drug.&lt;ref name="NYT-20151127" /&gt; The cost of research and development for each drug is hundreds of millions of dollars. In 2005 the research and development expenditure for the biopharmaceutical industry within Europe and the US was 15,474 million euro.(The Pharma Industry Figures, 2006). Some health economists peg the current cost of drug development at US$1.3 billion, others at US$1.7 billion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 2630351 | pmid=19188620 | doi=10.1503/cmaj.082040 | volume=180 | title=Drug development cost estimates hard to swallow | year=2009 | journal=CMAJ | pages=279–80 | last1 = Collier | first1 = R}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actual [[drug discovery]] and the [[drug development]] can take years. After which, testing and clinical trials are required prior to getting approval by regulatory boards. After launching the drug the company has much at stake as it has already outlaid millions of dollars the success of its sales is an important factor to the success of the company.

== Sales practices ==
A pharmaceutical sales representative is the key part within the sales of all drugs.&lt;ref name="NYT-20151127" /&gt; They are responsible to ensure the healthcare profession is informed of the benefits of the drug along with the safety and the side effects to assist a healthcare profession as the correct information and choices to prescribe medication to the patients. The term used is ethical promotion, which can be described as communication of ethical values to promote their product to the physician. (Wright &amp; Lundstrom, 2004)

== Regulations and guidelines ==

=== European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations ===
The [[European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations]] (EFPIA) stipulates that there is a Corporate Social responsibility for the pharmaceutical industry to recognize and acknowledge the need to act responsibly towards society and the communities in which it operates.

The EFPIA has also code of practice on the promotion of medicine, which entails the regulations over many areas of the promotion of medicine. These include events and hospitality that can be extended by a pharmaceutical company. Gifts and inducements must be inexpensive and provide value to the practice of medicine or pharmacy. All medical sales representatives must have the adequate training and sufficient scientific knowledge to provide relevant and precise information about the products. They must also comply with the requirements of the applicable codes.

===Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America===
{{main article | Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America}}
In 2002 the [[Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America]], issued a set of guidelines for its member companies to follow when it comes to the relationship between drug reps and doctors. The voluntary code significantly changed how drug company representatives interact with doctors. Changes range from restricting gifts to limiting consulting contracts offered to doctors.&lt;ref name="Baltimore"&gt;{{cite news |title=Just what the doctor ordered |author=Anderson, Tania |newspaper=Baltimore Business Journal |date=27 June 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

PhRMA was inspired to come up with the code after years of criticism from groups like [[Families USA]] and [[Public Citizen]]. PhRMA already had a set of guidelines on this topic but its board decided that one of the best ways to thwart the criticism and prevent any appearance of impropriety was to come up with a stricter code.&lt;ref name="Baltimore"/&gt;

"The PhRMA guidelines are one major factor contributing to a paradigm shift that directly impacts the way our industry conducts business,""Because of this shift, pharmaceutical sales forces must learn new and more compelling ways to create and keep customers, or perish because physicians are no longer willing to listen to their usual approach,"  said Susan Torroella, CEO of Columbia MedCom Group.&lt;ref name="Baltimore"/&gt;

PhRMA is opposed to state laws that regulate interaction between [[pharmaceutical sales representative]]s and health care providers. PhRMA officials said state regulations could create a patchwork of conflicting rules across the states that might do more to confuse sales representatives and doctors than prevent improper perks."We do have the comprehensive guidelines combined with the guidelines of the Office of Inspector General. Not only would state laws be a duplication, it could be nightmarish because you would have differing standards for different states," said Jeff Trewhitt, a spokesman for PhRMA.&lt;ref name="Baltimore"/&gt;

===U.S. Department of Health and Human Services===
{{main article | United States Department of Health and Human Services}}
After PhRMA enacted its guidelines, the Office of Inspector General for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued guidelines similar to PhRMA's code, except with more severe penalties. Companies that fail to follow the department's rules could face a federal investigation that could lead to civil penalties.&lt;ref name="Baltimore"/&gt;

==Health care fraud==
{{See also|List of largest pharmaceutical settlements in the United States|List of off-label promotion pharmaceutical settlements}}
[[Pharmaceutical fraud]] involves activities that result in false claims to insurers or programs such as [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] in the United States or equivalent state programs for financial gain to a pharmaceutical company.&lt;ref name="NYT-20151127" /&gt; There are several different schemes&lt;ref name="FBIFraudTypes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/fcs_report2006/financial-crimes-report-to-the-public-fiscal-year-2006#Health|publisher=FBI|year=2006|title=Financial Crimes to the Public Report 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; used to defraud the [[health care system]] which are particular to the pharmaceutical industry. These include: Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) Violations, Off Label Marketing, Best Price Fraud, CME Fraud, Medicaid Price Reporting, and Manufactured Compound Drugs. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) estimates that [[health care fraud]] costs American taxpayers $60 billion a year.&lt;ref name="FBIHealthCareGeneral"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/investigate/white_collar/health-care-fraud|title=FBI-Health Care Fraud|publisher=FBI}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of this amount $2.5 billion was recovered through ''False Claims Act'' cases in FY 2010. Examples of fraud cases include the [[Pfizer]] $2.3 billion settlement and [[Merck &amp; Co.|Merck]] $650 million settlement. Damages from fraud can be recovered by use of the [[False Claims Act]], most commonly under the ''[[qui tam]]'' provisions which rewards an individual for being a "[[whistleblower]]", or [[relator (law)]].&lt;ref name="DOJHealthCareFraudReport"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/usao/tne/health_care.html|title=Department of Justice|publisher=Department of Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antipsychotic drugs are now the top-selling class of pharmaceuticals in America, generating annual revenue of about $14.6 billion. Every major company selling the drugs — [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]], [[Eli Lilly]], [[Pfizer]], [[AstraZeneca]] and [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]] — has either settled recent government cases, under the False Claims Act, for hundreds of millions of dollars or is currently under investigation for possible health care fraud. Following charges of illegal marketing, two of the settlements set records last year for the largest criminal fines ever imposed on corporations. One involved Eli Lilly’s antipsychotic [[Zyprexa]], and the other involved  [[Bextra]]. In the Bextra case, the government also charged Pfizer with illegally marketing another antipsychotic, [[Geodon]]; Pfizer settled that part of the claim for $301 million, without admitting any wrongdoing.&lt;ref name=bied2010&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/03/business/03psych.html?_r=3&amp;hp=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=Side Effects May Include Lawsuits |author=Duff Wilson |date=October 2, 2010  |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 July 2012, [[GlaxoSmithKline]] pleaded guilty to criminal charges and agreed to a $3 billion settlement of the largest health-care fraud case in the U.S. and the largest payment by a drug company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-18673220| title=GlaxoSmithKline | date= 4 July 2012 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The settlement is related to the company's illegal promotion of prescription drugs, its failure to report safety data,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-02/glaxosmithkline-agrees-to-pay-3-billion-in-u-s-drug-settlement.html |title=GlaxoSmithKline Agrees to Pay $3 Billion in U.S. Drug Settlement |date=2 July 2012 | work=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[bribing]] doctors, and promoting medicines for uses for which they were not licensed. The drugs involved were [[Paxil]], [[Wellbutrin]], [[Advair]], [[Lamictal]], and [[Zofran]] for off-label, non-covered uses.

===No Free Lunch ===
{{main article | No Free Lunch (organization) }}
Some physicians have joined an organization No free lunch which asked physicians to make a pledge to not accept any pharmaceutical companies gifts no matter how large or small. The members base that gift giving forms relationships, which influences behaviour and creates a conflict of interest. (No Free Lunch)

[[File:Palenque - Rote Königin 1.jpg|thumb|The mask of the Red Queen.]]
'''Fanny López Jiménez''' (born Tuxtla Gutiérrez, Chiapas, 1970) is a Mexican archaeologist known for her excavations at [[Palenque]], including the discovery of the [[Tomb of the Red Queen]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mexiconewsnetwork.com/art-culture/red-queen-palenque/ The red Queen of Palenque…] ''Mexico News Network'', 2014. Retrieved 31 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

López Jiménez studied archaeology at the [[National School of Anthropology and History]] in Mexico City. She completed her first fieldwork in Lagartero near [[Comitán]] and shortly after, in 1991, performed excavation practices in Palenque, on the north side El Palacio. The remains of the Red Queen were found on 11 April 1994&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/other-shows/videos/assignment-discovery-palenque-red-queen/ Palenque Red Queen.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141231233022/http://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/other-shows/videos/assignment-discovery-palenque-red-queen/ |date=2014-12-31 }} Discovery Channel. Retrieved 31 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; in the Temple XIII internal substructure. After further research it was López Jiménez who proposed that the identity of the formerly unknown woman was Hun K'Anleum, "Señora 1 Telaraña" ("Lady 1 Cobweb") in her article "Quién es la Reina Roja?" (Who is the Red Queen?) in ''[[Arqueología Mexicana]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueomex.com/S2N3nREINA69.html Quién es la Reina Roja?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150101012253/http://www.arqueomex.com/S2N3nREINA69.html |date=2015-01-01 }} ''Arqueología Mexicana''.

[[File:Alishan in his last days 1901.png|thumb|left|Father Ghevont Alishan in his last days]]

Father '''Ghevont Alishan''' ({{Lang-hy|Ղևոնդ Ալիշան}}) (1820-1901; also spelled '''Ghevond Alishan''') was an ordained [[Armenian Catholic Church|Armenian Catholic]] priest, historian and a poet. He was awarded by the [[Legion of Honour]] of the [[French Academy]] (1866), an honorary member of the Asian Society of Italia, Archeological Society of Moscow, Venice Academy and Archeological Society of Saint-Petersburg.

[[John Ruskin]] wrote that he "always looked upon him [Padre Alishan] as a sort of saint; he has been our friend for a great many of years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Works of John Ruskin, Volume 32|date=1907|publisher=G. Allen|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=MYpBAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA305&amp;dq=raskin%27s+friendship+with+the+armenian+monks+at+san+lazzaro+venice&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QR-7VKn9L4mWgwSv7oIY&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=raskin's%20friendship%20with%20the%20armenian%20monks%20at%20san%20lazzaro%20venice&amp;f=false 305]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a member of the [[Mechitarists|Mkhitarist Congregation]] in [[Venice]] beginning in 1838. In 1885 he created the first modern [[Flag of Armenia|Armenian flag]].  His first design was a horizontal tricolor, but with a set of colors different from those used on the Armenian flag of today. The top band would be red to symbolize the first Sunday of Easter (called "Red" Sunday), the green to represent the "Green" Sunday of Easter, and finally an arbitrary color, white, was chosen to complete the combination.  While in France, Alishan also designed a second flag inspired by the national [[Flag of France]]. Its colors were red, green, and blue respectively, representing the band of colors that [[Noah]] saw after landing on [[Mount Ararat]].

'''Helwan''' ({{lang-ar|حلوان}} ''{{transl|arz|Ḥelwān}}'', {{IPA-arz|ħelˈwæːn|IPA}}, {{lang-cop|ϩⲁⲗⲟⲩⲁⲛ|Halouan}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=La géographie de l’Egypte à l'époque copte.|last=Emile|first=Amélineau|publisher=Imprimerie nationale|year=1893|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=584}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a city in [[Egypt]] and part of [[Greater Cairo]], on the bank of the [[Nile]], opposite the ruins of [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]]. Originally a southern suburb of [[Cairo]], it served as the capital of the now defunct [[Helwan Governorate]] from April 2008 to April 2011, after which it was re-incorporated into the [[Cairo Governorate]]. The ''kism'' of Helwan had a population of 643,327 in the 2006 [[census]].&lt;ref name="CAPMAS 2006 Cairo"&gt;[http://www.msrintranet.capmas.gov.eg/pls/indcs/cns_st_001_m?lang=0&amp;lname=FDL&amp;gv=01&amp;d=3 Central Agency for Public Mobilisation and Statistics, Population and Housing Census 2006, Population distribution by sex, gov: Cairo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211234552/http://www.msrintranet.capmas.gov.eg/pls/indcs/cns_st_001_m?lang=0&amp;lname=FDL&amp;gv=01&amp;d=3 |date=2008-12-11 }} Retrieved on 2008-04-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Helwan and Isnian cultures of the late [[epipaleolithic]], and their Ouchata retouch methods for creating microlithic tools may have contributed to the development of the [[Harifian]] cultural assemblage of the [[Sinai]], which may have introduced [[Proto-Semitic language]]s into the Middle East.

Around 3000 to 2600 BC, there was a cemetery near Helwan serving the city of [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]].

The Khedivial Astronomical Observatory was built here 1903-1904, and was used to observe [[Halley's comet]]. Egypt's oldest and largest private psychiatric clinic, the Behman Hospital, was constructed here in 1939.

During the early part of the 20th century, the city was the site of [[RAF Helwan]], a major [[United Kingdom|British]] airfield, which was later used by the [[Egyptian Air Force]].

In 1959 Helwan was chosen to serve as a site of a major industrial city, as part of President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Gamal Abdel Nasser's]] attempts to industrialize Egypt. Throughout the 1960s, it developed into a massive [[steelworks]] zone, with numerous automobile factories being built. The site continues to use electricity from the [[Aswan Dam]] and iron ore from Egypt's western deserts. Helwan was gradually transformed into a mass suburb of Cairo for the working class.&lt;ref&gt;Beattie, Andrew. (2005) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=kDQ_u4_KdIEC&amp;dq=Nasser+Helwan+automobile&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Cairo: A Cultural and Literary History]''. Signal Books. p. 196. {{ISBN|9781902669779}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2008, the [[Helwan Governorate]] was split from the [[Cairo Governorate]]. It encompassed most of the suburbs, new compounds and villages located in the southern part of Cairo. The city of Helwan became the capital of the new governorate. Following the dissolution of the Helwan Governorate in April 2011, the city of Helwan was reincorporated into the Cairo Governorate.

== Ecclesiastical history ==
Alphocranon was important enough in the Late [[Roman province]] of [[Arcadia Aegypti]] to be a [[suffragan]] of its Metropolitan Archbishop of [[Oxyrhynchus]].

Its bishop, Harpocration, participated in the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325. The bishopric is mentioned in two ''[[Notitiae Episcopatuum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Siméon Vailhé, v. ''Alphocranon'', in [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6561037d/f363.image ''Dictionnaire d'Histoire et de Géographie ecclésiastiques''], vol. XII, Paris 1953, col. 677&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klaas A. Worp, [https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/8214/5_039_223.pdf?sequence=1 ''A Checklist of Bishops in Byzantine Egypt (A.D. 325 - c. 750)''], in ''Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik'' 100 (1994) 283-318&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
=== Titular see ===
No longer a residential diocese, Alphocranon is today listed by the [[Catholic Church]] as a [[Latin Catholic]] [[titular bishopric]],&lt;ref&gt;''Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}), p. 829&lt;/ref&gt; nominally restoring the diocese since 1933, but no incumbent is recorded.

== Administrative divisions ==
The now defunct Helwan Governorate encompassed the following cities or districts: [[Maadi]], Helwan, [[15th of May (city)|15th of May]], [[El Shorouk]], [[New Cairo]], [[Madinaty]].

The city of Helwan itself includes districts such as [[Wadi Hof]], Hadayek Helwan, and Maasara.

== Economy ==
[[File:Nasser at Helwan car factory.jpg|thumb|right|President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] inaugurating the Al Nasr automobile factory in Helwan, 1963]]

Local industry includes [[iron]], [[steel]], [[textiles]] and [[cement]]. The area has hot [[sulphur spring]]s, an astronomical observatory, the [[Helwan University]] and a burial chamber (discovered in 1946). It is the terminus of Cairo's light rail [[Cairo Metro Line 1|Metro Line 1]]. Also [[trams]] in Helwan serve the people.

== Climate ==
[[Köppen-Geiger climate classification system]] classifies its climate as [[hot desert climate|hot desert]] (BWh). Owing to its proximity to [[Cairo#Climate|Cairo]], its average monthly temperatures are quite similar, but it has a quite different distribution of [[humidity]] and its diurnal average temperature variation is slightly larger.

The '''history of alternative medicine''' refers to the history of a group of diverse medical practices that were collectively promoted as "[[alternative medicine]]" beginning in the 1970s, to the collection of individual histories of members of that group, or to the history of western medical practices that were labeled "irregular practices" by the western medical establishment.&lt;ref name=CHBHAMA&gt;Countercultural Healing: A brief History of Alternavie Medicine in America, James Whorton, [[PBS]], Nov 4 2003, {{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/altmed/clash/history.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-12-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071229083945/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/altmed/clash/history.html |archivedate=2007-12-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NCHAMA&gt;Nature Cures&amp;nbsp;–  The History of Alternative Medicine in America, James C.

Much of what is now categorized as alternative medicine was developed as independent, complete medical systems, was developed long before biomedicine and use of scientific methods, and was developed in relatively isolated regions of the world where there was little or no medical contact with pre-scientific western medicine, or with each other's systems. Examples are [[Traditional Chinese medicine]] and the [[Ayurvedic medicine]] of [[India]]. Other alternative medicine practices, such as [[homeopathy]], were developed in western Europe and in opposition to western medicine, at a time when western medicine was based on unscientific theories that were dogmatically imposed by western religious authorities. Homeopathy was developed prior to discovery of the basic principles of [[chemistry]], which proved homeopathic remedies contained nothing but water. But homeopathy, with its remedies made of water, was harmless compared to the unscientific and dangerous orthodox western medicine practiced at that time, which included use of [[toxin]]s and [[bloodletting|draining of blood]], often resulting in permanent disfigurement or death.&lt;ref name=CHBHAMA/&gt; Other alternative practices such as [[chiropractic]] and [[osteopathic manipulative medicine]], were developed in the United States at a time that western medicine was beginning to incorporate scientific methods and theories, but the biomedical model was not yet totally dominant. Practices such as chiropractic and osteopathic, each considered to be irregular by the medical establishment, also opposed each other, both rhetorically and politically with licensing legislation. Osteopathic practitioners added the courses and training of biomedicine to their licensing, and licensed Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine holders began diminishing use of the unscientific origins of the field, and without the original practices and theories, is now considered the same as biomedicine.

Until the 1970s, western practitioners that were not part of the medical establishment were referred to "irregular practitioners", and were dismissed by the medical establishment as unscientific or [[quackery]].&lt;ref name=CHBHAMA/&gt; Irregular practice became increasingly marginalized as [[quackery]] and fraud, as western medicine increasingly incorporated scientific methods and discoveries, and had a corresponding increase in success of its treatments. In the 1970s, irregular practices were grouped with traditional practices of nonwestern cultures and with other unproven or disproven practices that were not part of biomedicine, with the group promoted as being "alternative medicine". Following the [[counterculture movement]] of the 1960s, misleading marketing campaigns promoting "alternative medicine" as being an effective "alternative" to biomedicine, and with changing social attitudes about not using chemicals, challenging the establishment and authority of any kind, sensitivity to giving equal measure to values and beliefs of other cultures and their practices through [[cultural relativism]], adding [[postmodernism]] and [[deconstructivism]] to ways of thinking about science and its deficiencies, and with growing frustration and desperation by patients about limitations and side effects of [[science-based medicine]], use of alternative medicine in the west began to rise, then had explosive growth beginning in the 1990s, when senior level political figures began promoting alternative medicine, and began diverting government medical research funds into research of alternative, complementary, and integrative medicine.&lt;ref name=CHBHAMA/&gt;&lt;ref name=NCHAMA/&gt;&lt;ref name=RRCAM/&gt;&lt;ref name=ATRAMM/&gt;&lt;ref name=FrontlineAF&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/altmed/etc/synopsis.html|title=The Alternative Fix - Introduction - FRONTLINE - PBS|author=|date=|website=www.pbs.org|accessdate=27 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180130204840/https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/altmed/etc/synopsis.html|archivedate=30 January 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TAMUUS&gt;Trends in alternative medicine use in the United States, 1990–1997: results of a follow-up national survey.Eisenberg DM1, Davis RB, Ettner SL, Appel S, Wilkey S, Van Rompay M, Kessler RC., JAMA. 1998 Nov 11; 280(18): 1569–75, {{cite web |url=http://www.anatomyfacts.com/Research/trends.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724100936/http://www.anatomyfacts.com/Research/trends.pdf |archivedate=2015-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TT&gt;Edzard Ernst; Singh, Simon (2008), Trick or Treatment: The Undeniable Facts about Alternative Medicine, New York: W.

{{further information|List of branches of alternative medicine}}

The concept of alternative medicine is problematic as it cannot exist autonomously as an object of study in its own right but must always be defined in relation to a non-static and transient medical orthodoxy.{{sfn|Blécourt|Usborne|1999a|p=284|ps=}} It also divides medicine into two realms, a medical mainstream and fringe, which, in privileging [[orthodoxy]], presents difficulties in constructing an historical analysis independent of the often biased and polemical views of regular medical practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ramsey|1999|p=287}}; {{harvnb|Bradley|2002|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The description of non-conventional medicine as alternative reinforces both its marginality and the centrality of official medicine.{{sfn|Bradley|2002|p=19|ps=}} Although more neutral than either pejorative or promotional designations such as “[[quackery]]” or “[[Naturopathy|natural medicine]]”, cognate terms like “unconventional”, “[[heterodoxy|heterodox]]”, “unofficial”, “irregular”, "[[Folk medicine|folk]]", "popular", "marginal", “complementary”, “[[Integrative medicine|integrative]]” or “unorthodox” define their object against the standard of conventional biomedicine,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ramsey|1999|p=287}}; {{harvnb|Jütte|2001|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; entail particular perspectives and judgements, often carry moral overtones, and can be inaccurate.{{sfn|Jütte|1999|p=343|ps=}} Conventional medical practitioners in the West have, since the nineteenth century, used some of these and similar terms as a means of defining the [[Boundary-work|boundary]] of "legitimate" medicine, marking the division between that which is [[Science|scientific]] and that which is not.{{sfn|Jütte|2001|p=12|ps=}} The definition of mainstream medicine, generally understood to refer to a system of [[Medical license|licensed medicine]] which enjoys state and legal protection in a jurisdiction,{{#tag:ref|A more exhaustive definition of conventional medicine in contemporary western societies states that it "enjoys the approval, co-operation, and protection of the country's legal system and other supporting social institutions: government licensing and regulatory boards, third party payment systems, preferred access to federal and private research moneys, high prestige and social status, and their concomitant benefits, including professional associations with considerable lobbying power and professional associations with considerable reputations for authority."&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, Bonnie Blair (1995), ''Healing Traditions: Alternative Medicine and the Healthcare Professions'', Philadelphia, quoted in {{harvnb|Jütte|2001|pp=14&amp;ndash;15}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=n}} is also highly specific to time and place. In countries such as India and China [[traditional medicine|traditional systems of medicine]], in conjunction with Western [[Healthcare science|biomedical science]], may be considered conventional and mainstream.{{sfn|Jütte|1999|p=343|ps=}} The shifting nature of these terms is underlined by recent efforts to demarcate between alternative treatments on the basis of [[efficacy]] and safety and to amalgamate those therapies with scientifically adjudged value into complementary medicine as a pluralistic adjunct to conventional practice.{{#tag:ref|This position has been argued by medical commentators such as Marcia Angell and Jerome Kassirer: "It is time for the scientific community to stop giving alternative medicine a free ride. There cannot be two kinds of medicine &amp;ndash; conventional and alternative. There is only medicine that has been adequately tested and medicine that has not, medicine that works and medicine that may or may not work. Once a treatment has been tested rigorously, it no longer matters whether it was considered alternative at the outset. If it is found to be reasonably safe and effective, it will be accepted. But assertions, speculation, and testimonials do not substitute for evidence. Alternative treatments should be subjected to scientific testing no less rigorous than that required for conventional treatments."{{sfn|Angell|Kassirer|1998|p=839|ps=}}|group=n}}  This would introduce a new line of division based upon medical validity.{{sfn|Ramsey|1999|p=287|ps=}}

Prior to the nineteenth century European medical training and practice was ostensibly self-regulated through a variety of antique corporations, guilds or [[Medical college|colleges]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pickstone|2006|p=261}}; {{harvnb|Porter|1999|p=287}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among regular practitioners, university trained physicians formed a medical elite while provincial [[surgeon]]s and [[Apothecary|apothecaries]], who learnt their art through [[apprenticeship]], made up the lesser ranks.{{sfn|Porter|1999|p=287|ps=}} In [[Early Modern France|Old Regime France]], licenses for medical practitioners were granted by the [[Medical school|medical faculties]] of the major universities, such as the Paris Faculty of Medicine. Access was restricted and successful candidates, amongst other requirements, had to pass examinations and pay regular fees.{{sfn|Porter|1999|p=287|ps=}} In the [[Austrian Empire]] medical licences were granted by the Universities of Prague and Vienna.{{sfn|Porter|1999|p=288|ps=}} Amongst the [[Kleinstaaterei|German states]] the top physicians were academically qualified and typically attached to medical colleges associated with the royal court.{{sfn|Porter|1999|p=288|ps=}} The theories and practices included the science of [[anatomy]] and that the blood circulated by a pumping heart, and contained some empirically gained information on progression of disease and about surgery, but were otherwise unscientific, and were almost entirely ineffective and dangerous.

Outside of these formal medical structures there were myriad other medical practitioners, often termed irregulars, plying a range of services and goods.{{sfn|Pickstone|2006|p=264}} The eighteenth-century medical marketplace, a period often referred to as the "Golden Age of quackery",{{sfn|Porter|1999|p=284}}{{#tag:ref|First recorded in use in English in the early seventeenth century, quack is a contracted form of the word "quacksalver" which is of early modern Dutch origin (''kwakzalver''; first recorded in 1543) and describes a person who heals through the use of home remedies. Further etymological elaborations are speculative.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{harvnb|OED Online|2012a}}; {{harvnb|OED Online|2012b}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roy Porter suggests that it indicated a quicksilver doctor as [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], also known as quicksilver, was then typically used in the treatment of syphilis.{{sfn|Porter|1999|p=284}} The Oxford English Dictionary suggests that "quack" may be derived from the Dutch ''kwak'', which means rubbish or scrap, but the first use of the word with this meaning is not recorded until 1599. It proposes that otherwise the term may come from the early modern Dutch word ''quacken'' (''kwaken'') the meaning of which is to boast, squawk or chatter and may refer pejoratively to the hectoring marketplace promotion of quacks and [[Charlatan|mountebanks]]. ''Zalver'' means a person who uses ointments to heal (from ''zalven'' to rub with ointment). In sixteenth-century Germany the term ''Quacksalber'' was in use; in Sweden in the seventeenth century it was ''kvacksalvare''; and in eighteenth-century Denmark one finds ''kvaksalver''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;|group=n}} was a highly pluralistic one that lacked a well-defined and policed division between "conventional" and "unconventional" medical practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Porter|1988|p=5}}; {{harvnb|Bivins|2007|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In much of continental Europe legal remedies served to control at least the most egregious forms of "irregular" medical practice but the medical market in both Britain and American was less restrained through regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Porter|1999|p=284}}; {{harvnb|Ramsey|1999|p=297}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quackery in the period prior to modern medical [[professionalization|professionalisation]] should not be considered equivalent to alternative medicine as those commonly deemed quacks were not peripheral figures by default nor did they necessarily promote oppositional and alternative medical systems. Indeed, the charge of 'quackery', which might allege medical incompetence, avarice or fraud, was levelled quite indiscriminately across the varied classes of medical practitioners be they regular medics, such as the hierarchical, corporate classes of physicians, surgeons and apothecaries in England, or irregulars such as [[Patent medicine|nostrum]] mongers, [[bonesetter]]s and local wise-women.{{sfn|Porter|1988|pp=2&amp;ndash;3}} Commonly, however, quackery was associated with a growing medical entrepreneurship amongst both regular and irregular practitioners in the provision of goods and services along with associated techniques of advertisement and self-promotion in the medical marketplace.{{sfn|Porter|1988|p=3}} The constituent features of the medical marketplace during the eighteenth century were the development of medical [[consumerism]] and a high degree of patient power and choice in the selection of treatments, the limited efficacy of available medical therapies,{{sfn|Porter|1999|p=266}} and the absence of both medical professionalisation and enforced regulation of the market.{{sfn|Porter|1988|p=3}}

== Medical professionalisation ==

In the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries regular and irregular medical practitioners became more clearly differentiated throughout much of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brunton|2004|p=119}}; {{harvnb|Brown|2007|pp=238&amp;ndash;39}}&lt;/ref&gt; In part, this was achieved through processes of state-sanctioned medical regulation.{{sfn|Pickstone|2006|p=262|ps=}}  The different types of regulatory medical markets created across nineteenth-century Europe and America reflected differing historical patterns of [[state formation]].{{sfn|Pickstone|2006|p=262|ps=}} Where states had traditionally enjoyed strong, centralised power, such as in the German states, government more easily assumed control of the medical regulation.{{sfn|Pickstone|2006|p=262|ps=}} In states that had exercised weaker central power and adopted a [[Free market|free-market]] model, such as in Britain, government gradually assumed greater control over medical regulation as part of increasing state focus on issues of [[public health]].{{sfn|Pickstone|2006|p=262|ps=}} This process was significantly complicated in Britain by the enduring existence of the historical medical colleges.{{sfn|Pickstone|2006|p=262|ps=}} A similar process is observable in America from the 1870s but this was facilitated by the absence of medical corporations.{{sfn|Pickstone|2006|p=262|ps=}} Throughout the nineteenth century, however, most Western states converged in the creation of legally delimited and semi-protected medical markets.{{sfn|Pickstone|2006|p=262|ps=}} It is at this point that an "official" medicine, created in cooperation with the state and employing a scientific rhetoric of [[Legitimation|legitimacy]], emerges as a recognisable entity and that the concept of alternative medicine as a historical category becomes tenable.{{sfn|Ramsey|1999|p=290|ps=}}

France provides perhaps one of the earliest examples of the emergence of a state-sanctioned medical orthodoxy &amp;ndash; and hence also of the conditions for the development of forms of alternative medicine &amp;ndash; the beginnings of which can be traced to the late eighteenth century.{{sfn|Ramsey|1999|p=297}} In addition to the traditional French medical faculties and the complex hierarchies of practitioners over which they presided, the state increasingly supported new institutions, such as the Société Royale de Médecine (''Royal Society of Medicine'') which received its royal charter in 1778, that played a role in policing medical practice and the sale of medical nostrums.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pickstone|2006|p=267}}; {{harvnb|Ramsey|1999|p=297}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system was radically transformed during the early phases of the [[French Revolution]] when both the traditional faculties and the new institutions under royal sponsorship were removed and an entirely unregulated medical market was created.&lt;ref name="Pi267Po352"&gt;{{harvnb|Pickstone|2006|p=267}}; {{harvnb|Porter|1999|p=352}}&lt;/ref&gt; This anarchic situation was reformed under the exigencies of war when in 1793 the state established national control over medical education; under [[Napoleon]] in 1803 state-control was extended over the licensing of medical practitioners.&lt;ref name="Pi267Po352"/&gt; This latter reform introduced a new hierarchical division between practitioners in the creation of a medical élite of [[Doctor of Medicine|graduate physicians and surgeons]], who were at liberty to practice throughout the state, and the lowly ''officiers de santé'' who received less training, could only offer their services to the poor, and were restricted in where they could practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pickstone|2006|pp=267&amp;ndash;68}}; {{harvnb|Porter|1999|p=352}}&lt;/ref&gt; This national system of medical regulation under state-control, exported to regions of [[First French Empire|Napoleonic conquest]] such as Italy, the [[Rhineland]] and the Netherlands,{{sfn|Porter|1999|p=353|ps=}} became paradigmatic in the West and in countries adopting western medical systems.{{sfn|Ramsey|1999|p=298|ps=}} While offering state protection to licensed doctors and establishing a medical [[monopoly]] in principal it did not, however, remove competition from irregular practitioners.{{sfn|Pickstone|2006|p=268|ps=}}

== Nineteenth-century non-conventional medicine ==

From the late eighteenth century and more robustly from the mid-nineteenth century a number of non-conventional medical systems developed in the West which proposed oppositional medical systems, criticised orthodox medical practitioners, emphasised patient-centredness, and offered substitutes for the treatments offered by the medical mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gevitz|1997|p=604}}; {{harvnb|Marland|Adams|2009|p=503}}&lt;/ref&gt; While neither the medical marketplace nor irregular practitioners disappeared during the nineteenth century, the proponents of alternative medical systems largely differed from the entrepreneurial quacks of the previous century in eschewing showy self-promotion and instead adopting a more sober and serious self-presentation.{{sfn|Loudon|1987|pp=116&amp;ndash;17|ps=}} The relationship between medical orthodoxy and heterodoxy was complex, both categories contained considerably variety, were subject to substantial change throughout the period, and the divisions between the two were frequently blurred.{{sfn|Bradley|2002|pp=19&amp;ndash;21|ps=}}

Many alternative notions grew out of the [[Lebensreform]] movement, which emphasized the goodness of nature, the harms to society, people, and to nature caused by industrialization, the importance of the whole person, body and mind, the power of the sun, and the goodness of "the old ways".&lt;ref name=Williams2007&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=John Alexander|title=Turning to nature in Germany : hiking, nudism, and conservation, 1900–1940|date=2007|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, Calif.|isbn=9780804700153|pages=23–30|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RGemAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA23}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|40}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peeters|first1=Everr|last2=Wils|first2=Kaat|editor1-last=Huisman|editor1-first=Frank|editor2-last=Oosterhuis|editor2-first=Harry|title=Health and Citizenship: Political Cultures of Health in Modern Europe|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317319030|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R31ECgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA107|language=en|chapter=4: Ambivalences of Liberal Health Policy: ''Lebensreform'' and Self-Help Medicine in Belgium: 1890–1914|date=2015-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hakl|first1=Hans Thomas|last2=McIntosh|first2=Christopher|title=Eranos: An Alternative Intellectual History of the Twentieth Century|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317548133|page=272|quote=How can we explain the convergence of conservative-volkisch currents with the Lebensreform faction, the ecology movement, early women's liberation and the opening to alternative forms of religion&amp;nbsp;– a convergence that seems so surprising from todays perspective?

The variety of alternative medical systems which developed during this period can be approximately categorised according to the form of treatment advocated. These were: those employing spiritual or psychological therapies, such as [[hypnosis]] ([[mesmerism]]); nutritional therapies based upon special diets, such as medical botanism; drug and biological therapies such as [[homeopathy]] and [[hydrotherapy]]; and, manipulative physical therapies such as [[osteopathy]] and [[chiropractic]] massage.{{sfn|Jütte|2001|p=15|ps=}} Non-conventional medicine might define health in terms of concepts of balance and harmony or espouse [[Vitalism|vitalistic]] doctrines of the body. Illness could be understood as due to the accretion of bodily [[toxin]]s and impurities, to result from magical, [[spiritualism|spiritual]], or supernatural causes, or as arising from energy blockages in the body such that healing actions might constitute energy transfer from practitioner to patient.{{sfn|Jütte|2001|p=15|ps=}}

=== Mesmerism ===

{{main article|Franz Mesmer|Animal magnetism}}
[[File:Franz Anton Mesmer.jpg|thumb|Franz Anton Mesmer (1734&amp;ndash;1815)]]

Mesmerism is the medical system proposed in the late eighteenth century by the Viennese-trained physician, [[Franz Mesmer|Franz Anton Mesmer]] (1734–1815), for whom it is named.{{sfn|Bivins|2007|p=80|ps=}} The basis of this doctrine was Mesmer's claimed discovery of a new aetherial fluid, [[animal magnetism]], which, he contended, permeated the universe and the bodies of all animate beings and whose proper balance was fundamental to health and disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bivins|2007|p=80}}; {{harvnb|Gevitz|1997|p=620}}&lt;/ref&gt; Animal magnetism was but one of series of postulated subtle fluids and substances, such as [[Caloric theory|caloric]], [[Phlogiston theory|phlogiston]], [[magnetism]], and  [[History of electromagnetic theory|electricity]], which then suffused the scientific literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bivins|2007|p=80}}; {{harvnb|Schlun|2007|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also reflected Mesmer's doctoral thesis, ''De Planatarum Influxu'' ("On the Influence of the Planets"), which had investigated the impact of the gravitational effect of [[Orbit|planetary movements]] on fluid-filled bodily tissues.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Porter|1999|p=285}}; {{harvnb|Bivins|2007|p=80}}; {{harvnb|Schlun|2007|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; His focus on magnetism and the therapeutic potential of [[magnet]]s was derived from his reading of [[Paracelsus]], [[Athanasius Kircher]] and [[Johannes Baptista van Helmont]].{{sfn|Schlun|2007|p=30}} The immediate impetus for his medical speculation, however, derived from his treatment of a patient, Franzisca Oesterlin, who suffered from episodic seizures and [[convulsion]]s which induced vomiting, fainting, temporary blindness and paralysis. His cure consisted of placing magnets upon her body which consistently produced convulsive episodes and a subsequent diminution of symptoms.{{sfn|Porter|1999|p=285|ps=}} According to Mesmer, the logic of this cure suggested that health was dependent upon the uninterrupted flow of a putative magnetic fluid and that ill health was consequent to its blockage. His treatment methods claimed to resolve this by either directly transferring his own superabundant and naturally occurring animal magnetism to his patients by touch or through the transmission of these energies from magnetic objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Porter|1999|p=285}}; {{harvnb|Bivins|2007|p=81}}; {{harvnb|Gevitz|1997|p=620}}; {{harvnb|Schlun|2007|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Magnetiseur.JPG|thumb|left|Caricature of a practitioner of animal magnetism treating a patient, c. 1780]]

By 1775 Mesmer's Austrian practice was prospering and he published the text ''Schrieben über die Magnetkur an einen auswärtigen Arzt'' which first outlined his thesis of animal magnetism.{{sfn|Schlun|2007|p=35}} In 1778, however, he became embroiled in a scandal resulting from his treatment of a young, blind patient who was connected to the Viennese court and relocated to Paris where he established a medical salon, "The Society of Harmony", for the treatment of patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schlun|2007|p=35}}; {{harvnb|Bivins|2007|p=81}}; {{sfn|Porter|1999|p=285}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recruiting from a client-base drawn predominantly from society women of the middle- and upper-classes, Mesmer held group ''séances'' at his salubrious salon-clinic which was physically dominated by a large, lidded, wooden tank, known as the ''baquet'', containing iron, glass and other material that Mesmer had magnetized and which was filled with "magnetized water".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Porter|1999|pp=285&amp;ndash;86}}; {{harvnb|Bivins|2007|p=81}}; {{harvnb|Schlun|2007|p=35 n. 22}}&lt;/ref&gt; At these sessions patients were enjoined to take hold of the metal rods emanating from the tub which acted as a reservoir for the animal magnetism derived from Mesmer and his clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Porter|1999|p=286}}; {{harvnb|Bivins|2007|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mesmer, through the apparent force of his will &amp;ndash; not infrequently assisted by an intense gaze or the administration of his wand &amp;ndash; would then direct these energies into the afflicted bodies of his patients seeking to provoke either a "crisis" or a trance-like state; outcomes which he believed essential for healing to occur.{{sfn|Bivins|2007|p=81|ps=}} Patient proclamations of cure ensured that Mesmer enjoyed considerable and fashionable success in late-eighteenth-century Paris where he occasioned something of a sensation and a scandal.{{sfn|Bivins|2007|p=81|ps=}}

Popular caricature of mesmerism emphasised the eroticised nature of the treatment as spectacle: "Here the physician in a coat of lilac or purple, on which the most brilliant flowers have been painted in needlework, speaks most consolingly to his patients: his arms softly enfolding her sustain her in her spasms, and his tender burning eye expresses his desire to comfort her".&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Jacques Paulet, ''Mesmer justifié'' (Paris, 1784), quoted in {{harvnb|Thompson|1999|p=86 n. 24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Responding chiefly to the hint of sexual impropriety and political radicalism imbuing these ''séances'', in 1784 mesmerism was subject to a commission of inquiry by a royal-appointed scientific panel of the prestigious French Académie de Médicine.&lt;!--- Query name of this org. ---&gt;{{sfn|Bivins|2007|p=82|ps=}}{{#tag:ref|Mesmer had in fact sought such an inquiry to legitimate the scientific status of mesmerism. He was disappointed, however, that they chose to investigate the clinic of one of his acolytes, Charles d'Elson, rather than his own.{{sfn|Schlun|2007|pp=36&amp;ndash;37}} Four leading doctors from the faculty of medicine sat on this commission together with five members of the Academy of Sciences, including [[Jean Sylvain Bailly]], [[Antoine Lavoisier]], and [[Benjamin Franklin]]. Another government-appointed commission to investigate mesmerism, composed of members from the Royal Society of Medicine, was also established in 1778.{{sfn|Darnton|1968|p=62|ps=}}|group=n}} Its findings were that animal magnetism had no basis in fact and that Mesmer's cures had been achieved through the power of [[suggestion]].{{sfn|Gevitz|1997|p=620|ps=}} The commission's report, if damaging to the personal status of Mesmer and to the professional ambitions of those faculty physicians who had adopted mesmeric practices,{{#tag:ref|Physicians who persisted in the practice of animal magnetism were struck off the register of the medical faculty.{{sfn|Ramsey|1999|p=297}}|group=n}} did little to hinder the diffusion of the doctrine of animal magnetism.{{sfn|Bivins|2007|p=82|ps=}}

[[File:John Elliotson 1843 Punch Cartoon Mesmerism.jpg|thumb|right|1843 ''Punch'' magazine caricature depicting John Elliotson "playing the brain" of a working-class, mesmerised woman]]

In England mesmerism was championed by [[John Elliotson]], Professor of Practical Medicine at [[University College London]] and the founder and president of the London Phrenological Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bivins|2007|p=83}}; {{harvnb|Schlun|2007|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; A prominent and progressive orthodox physician, he was President of the [[Medical and Chirurgical Society of London|Medico-Chirugical Society of London]] and an early adopter of the [[Stethoscope#history|stethoscope]] in English medical practice.{{sfn|Jacyna|2006|pp=21&amp;ndash;22|ps=}} He had been introduced to mesmerism in the summer of 1837 by the French physician and former student of Mesmer, Dupotet, who is credited as the most significant cross-channel influence on the development of mesmerism in England.{{sfn|Schlun|2007|pp=48&amp;ndash;49|ps=}} Elliotson believed that animal magnetism provided the basis for a consideration of the mind and will in material terms thus allowing for their study as medical objects.{{sfn|Bivins|2007|p=84|ps=}} Initially supported by ''[[The Lancet]]'', a reformist medical journal,{{sfn|Schlun|2007|p=50}} he contrived to demonstrate the scientific properties of animal magnetism as a physiological process on the predominantly female charity patients under his care in the University College Hospital.{{sfn|Bivins|2007|p=84|ps=}} Working-class patients were preferred as experimental subjects to exhibit the physical properties of mesmerism on the nervous system as, being purportedly more animalistic and machine-like than their social superiors, their personal characteristics were deemed less likely to interfere with the experimental process.{{sfn|Winter|1998a|p=62|ps=}}  He sought to reduce his subjects to the status of mechanical automata claiming that he could, through the properties of animal magnetism and the pacifying altered states of consciousness which it induced, "play" their brains as if they were musical instruments.{{sfn|Winter|1998a|pp=62&amp;ndash;63|ps=}}

Two Irish-born charity patients, the adolescent O'Key sisters, emerged as particularly important to Elliotson's increasingly popular and public demonstrations of mesmeric treatment. Initially, his magnetising practices were used to treat the sisters' shared diagnosis of hysteria and epilepsy in controlling or curtailing their convulsive episodes. By the autumn of 1837 Elliotson had ceased to treat the O'Keys merely as suitable objects for cure and instead sought to mobilise them as diagnostic instruments.{{sfn|Schlun|2007|p=51|ps=}} When in states of mesmeric entrancement the O'Key sisters, due to the apparent increased sensitization of their nervous system and sensory apparatus, behaved as if they had the ability to see through solid objects, including the human body, and thus aid in medical diagnosis. As their fame rivalled that of Elliotson, however, the O'Keys behaved less like human diagnostic machines and became increasingly intransigent to medical authority and appropriated to themselves the power to examine, diagnose, prescribe treatment and provide a prognosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schlun|2007|pp=52&amp;ndash;53}}; {{harvnb|Bivins|2007|p=84}}; {{harvnb|Winter|1998a|pp=78, 79}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of this threat to medical mastery in the form of a pair of working-class, teenage girls without medical training aroused general disquiet amongst the medical establishment and cost Elliotson one of his early and influential supporters, the leading proponent of medical reform, [[Thomas Wakley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schlun|2007|p=53}}; {{harvnb|Bivins|2007|pp=84&amp;ndash;85}}; {{harvnb|Jacyna|2006|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wakley, the editor of ''The Lancet'', had initially hoped that Elliotson's scientific experiments with animal magnetism might further the agenda of medical reform in bolstering the authority of the profession through the production of scientific truth and, equally importantly in a period when the power-relations between doctors and patients were being redefined, quiescent patient bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schlun|2007|p=53 n. 79}}; {{harvnb|Bivins|2007|pp=84&amp;ndash;85}}; {{harvnb|Winter|1998a|p=80}}; {{harvnb|Barrow|1991|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perturbed by the O'Key's provocative displays, Wakely convinced Elliotson to submit his mesmeric practice to a trial in August 1838 before a jury of ten gentlemen during which he accused the sisters of fraud and his colleague of gullibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakley|1838|pp=805&amp;ndash;11}}; {{harvnb|Bivins|2007|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a series of complaints issued to the Medical Committee of University College Hospital they elected to discharge the O'Keys along with other mesmeric subjects in the hospital and Elliotson resigned his post in protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stanley|2003|p=289}}; {{harvnb|Jacyna|2006|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This set-back, while excluding Elliotson from the medical establishment, ended neither his mesmeric career nor the career of mesmerism in England. From 1842 he became an advocate of phreno-mesmerism &amp;ndash; an approach that amalgamated the tenets of [[phrenology]] with animal magnetism and that led to a split in the Phrenological Society.&lt;ref name="harvnb|Winter|1998a|p=154"&gt;{{harvnb|Winter|1998a|p=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jacyna|2006|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year he founded, together with the physician and then President of the Phrenological Society, [[William Collins Engledue]],&lt;ref&gt;See [[The Zoist#William Collins Engledue|William Collins Engledue, M.D.]]&lt;/ref&gt; the principal journal on animal magnetism entitled ''[[The Zoist|The Zoist: A Journal of Cerebral Physiology and Mesmerism and their Application to Human Welfare]]'', a quarterly publication which remained in print until its fifty-second issue in January 1856.&lt;ref name="harvnb|Winter|1998a|p=154"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schlun|2007|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mesmeric societies, frequently patronised by those among the scientific and social elite were established in many major population centres in Britain from the 1840s onwards.{{sfn|Winter|1998a|p=156|ps=}} Some sufficiently endowed societies, such as those in London, Bristol and Dublin, Ireland, supported mesmeric infirmaries with permanent mesmeric practitioners in their employ.{{sfn|Winter|1998a|p=156|ps=}} Due to the competing rise of spiritualism and psychic research by the mid-1860s these mesmeric infirmaries had closed.{{sfn|Winter|1998a|p=156|ps=}}

This operation on the jaw of a female patient took place in Boston on 19 October 1846. William Morton acted as the anaesthetist and John Morrow was the surgeon]]

The 1840s in Britain also witnessed a deluge of travelling magnetisers who put on public shows for paying audiences to demonstrate their craft.{{sfn|Winter|1998b|p=32|ps=}} These mesmeric theatres, intended in part as a means of soliciting profitable private clientele, functioned as public fora for debate between skeptics and believers as to whether the performances were genuine or constituted fraud.{{sfn|Winter|1998b|p=32|ps=}} In order to establish that the loss of sensation under mesmeric trance was real, these itinerant mesmerists indulged in often quite violent methods &amp;ndash; including discharging firearms close to the ears of mesmerised subjects, pricking them with needles, putting acid on their skin and knives beneath their fingernails.{{sfn|Winter|1998b|p=32|ps=}}

Such displays of the anaesthetic qualities of mesmerism inspired some medical practitioners to attempt surgery on subjects under the spell of magnetism.{{sfn|Winter|1998b|pp=32&amp;ndash;33|ps=}} In France, the first major operation of this kind had been trialled, apparently successfully, as early as 1828 during a mastectomy procedure.{{sfn|Winter|1998b|p=34}} In Britain the first significant surgical procedure undertaken on a patient while mesmerised occurred in 1842 when James Wombell, a labourer from Nottingham, had his leg amputated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jacyna|2006|p=23}}; {{harvnb|Winter|1998b|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having been mesmerised for several days prior to the operation by a barrister named William Topham, Wombell exhibited no signs of pain during the operation and reported afterwards that the surgery had been painless.{{sfn|Winter|1998b|p=33|ps=}} This account was disputed by many in the medical establishment who held that Wombell had fraudulently concealed the pain of the amputation both during and after the procedure.{{sfn|Winter|1998b|ps=}} Undeterred, in 1843 Elliotson continued to advocate for the use of animal magnetism in surgery publishing ''Numerous Cases of Surgical Operation without Pain in the Mesmeric State''.{{sfn|Crabtree|2008|p=569|ps=}} This marked the beginning of a campaign by London mesmerists to gain a foothold for the practice within British hospitals by convincing both doctors and the general public of the value of surgical mesmerism.{{sfn|Winter|2004|pp=103&amp;ndash;04|ps=}} Mesmeric surgery enjoyed considerable success in the years from 1842 to 1846 and colonial India emerged as a particular stronghold of the practice; word of its success was propagated in Britain through the ''Zoist'' and the publication in 1846 of ''Mesmerism in India and its Practical Application in Surgery and Medicine'' by James Esdaile, a Scottish surgeon with the East India Company and the chief proponent of animal magnetism in the subcontinent.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Winter|1998b|p=35}}; {{harvnb|Crabtree|2008|p=569}}; {{harvnb|Schlun|2007|pp=54&amp;ndash;55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a few surgeons and dentists had undertaken fitful experiments with anaesthetic substances in the preceding years, it was only in 1846 that use of ether in surgery was popularised amongst orthodox medical practitioners.{{sfn|Winter|1998b|p=34}} This was despite the fact that the desensitising effects of widely available chemicals like ether and nitrous oxide were commonly known and had formed part of public and scientific displays over the previous half-century.{{sfn|Winter|1998b|pp=33&amp;ndash;34|ps=}}

A feature of the dissemination of magnetism in the New World was its increasing association with spiritualism.{{sfn|Ramsey|1999|p=303|ps=}} By the 1830s mesmerism was making headway in the United States amongst figures like the intellectual progenitor of the [[New Thought]] movement, [[Phineas Parkhurst Quimby]], whose treatment combined verbal suggestion with touch.{{sfn|Gevitz|1997|p=261|ps=}} Quimby's most celebrated "disciple", [[Mary Baker Eddy]], would go on to found the "medico-religious hybrid", [[Christian Science]], in the latter half of the nineteenth century.{{sfn|Schoepflin|2003|pp=6&amp;ndash;7|ps=}} In the 1840s the American spiritualist [[Andrew Jackson Davis]] sought to combine animal magnetism with spiritual beliefs and postulated that bodily health was dependent upon the unobstructed movement of the "spirit", conceived as a fluid substance, throughout the body. As with Quimby, Davis's healing practice involved the use of touch.{{sfn|Gevitz|1997|p=261|ps=}} &lt;!-- Gevitz argues, referencing Davis's treatment of asthma by rubbing up and down the spinal column, that there may be link here with chiropractic massage; does any other source support this interpretation? --&gt;

Deriving from the tradition of ‘bone-setting’ and a belief in the flow of supernatural energies in the body ([[vitalism]]), both '''[[osteopathy]]''' and '''[[chiropractic]]''' developed in the USA in the late 19th century.  The British School of Osteopathy was established in 1917&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nash | first1 = K. | last2 = Tyreman | first2 = S. | year = 2005 | title = An account of the development of the conceptual basis of osteopathy course at the British School of Osteopathy | url = | journal = International Journal of Osteopathic Medicine | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 29–37 | doi=10.1016/j.ijosm.2005.02.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was the 1960s before the first chiropractic college was established in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;Anglo-European College of Chiropractic (2008).

The passing of the Osteopaths Act (1993) and the Chiropractors Act (1994), however, created for the first time autonomous statutory regulation for two CAM therapies in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stone | first1 = J | year = 2005 | title = Regulation of CAM practitioners: reflecting on the last 10 years | url = | journal = Complementary Therapies in Clinical Practice | volume = 11 | issue = 1| pages = 5–10 | doi=10.1016/j.ctcp.2004.12.001| pmid = 15984217 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== History of chiropractic ====

[[Chiropractic]] began in the United States in 1895. when [[Daniel David Palmer]] performed the first chiropractic adjustment on a partially deaf janitor, who then claimed he could hear better as a result of the manipulation.&lt;ref name="SciArtPhi"&gt;Palmer, D.D. (1910) ''The Science, Art and Philosophy of Chiropractic'' Portland, Oregon: Portland Printing House Company&lt;/ref&gt; Palmer opened a school of chiropractic two years later. Chiropractic's early philosophy was rooted in [[vitalism]], [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]], [[magnetism]], [[spiritualism]] and other unscientific constructs. Palmer claimed to merge [[science]] and [[metaphysics]].&lt;ref name="Leach 2004 15"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leach|first=Robert|title=The Chiropractic Theories: A Textbook of Scientific Research|year=2004|publisher=Lippincott, Williams and Wilkins|isbn=0683307479|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Palmer's first descriptions and underlying philosophy of chiropractic described the body as a "machine" whose parts could be manipulated to produce a drugless cure, that spinal manipulation could improve health, and that the effects of chiropractic spinal manipulation as being mediated primarily by the nervous system.&lt;ref name="lifeline"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chiro.org/Plus/History/Persons/PalmerDD/PalmerDD's-Lifeline-chrono.pdf |title=98_04_13~1.PDF |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-10-14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090927105652/http://www.chiro.org/Plus/History/Persons/PalmerDD/PalmerDD's-Lifeline-chrono.pdf |archivedate=2009-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite their similarities, [[osteopathic]] practitioners sought to differentiate themselves by seeking [[regulation]] of the practices.&lt;ref name=Ernst-eval&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ernst E | title = Chiropractic: a critical evaluation | journal = Journal of Pain and Symptom Management | volume = 35 | issue = 5 | pages = 544–62 | date = May 2008 | pmid = 18280103 | doi = 10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2007.07.004 | issn = 0885-3924 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1907 test of the new law, a [[Wisconsin]] based chiropractor was charged with [[practicing without a license|practicing osteopathic medicine without a license]]. Practicing medicine without a license led to many chiropractors, including D.D. Palmer, being jailed.&lt;ref name=Ernst-eval/&gt;  Chiropractors won their first test case, but prosecutions instigated by state medical boards became increasingly common and successful. Chiropractors responded with political campaigns for separate licensing statutes, from osteopaths, eventually succeeding in all fifty states, from Kansas in 1913 through Louisiana in 1974.

Divisions developed within the chiropractic profession, with "mixers" combining [[spinal adjustment]]s with other treatments, and "straights" relying solely on spinal adjustments. A conference sponsored by the [[National Institutes of Health]] in 1975 spurred the development of chiropractic research.

=== Ayurvedic medicine ===

'''[[Ayurveda]]''' or '''ayurvedic medicine''' has more than 5,000 years of history, now re-emerging as texts become increasingly accessible in modern English translations. These texts attempt to translate the Sanskrit versions that have remained hidden in India since British occupation from 1755–1947.&lt;ref&gt;Charaka Samhita, transl. Kaviratna AC, Sharma P. (transl.)

A Handbook of History of Ayurveda, Chowkhamba Sanskrit Series Office, Varanasi, reprint 2007&lt;/ref&gt; As modern archaeological evidence from Harappa and Mohenja-daro is distributed, Ayurveda has now been accepted as the world's oldest concept of health and disease discovered by man and the oldest continuously practiced system of medicine. Ayurveda is a world view that advocates man’s allegiance and surrender to the forces of Nature that are increasingly revealed in modern physics, chemistry and biology.

Ayurveda can be defined as the system of medicine described in the great medical encyclopedias associated with the names Caraka, Suśruta, and Bheḷa, compiled and re-edited over several centuries from about 200 BCE to about 500 CE and written in Sanskrit.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} These discursive writings were gathered and systematized in about 600 CE by Vāgbhaṭa, to produce the ''Aṣṭāṅgahṛdayasaṃhitā'' ('Heart of Medicine Compendium') that became the most popular and widely used textbook of ayurvedic medicine in history.&lt;ref&gt;Sreekumar T.

Its prehistory goes back to [[Vedic period|Vedic]] culture and its proliferation in written form flourished in [[Buddhist]] times.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;  Although the hymns of the [[Atharvaveda]] and the [[Ṛgveda]] mention some herbal medicines, protective amulets, and healing prayers that recur in the ciphered slokas of later ayurvedic treatises, the earliest historical mention of the main structural and theoretical categories of ayurvedic medicine occurs in the Buddhist Pāli [[Tripiṭaka]], or Canon.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Ayurveda originally derived from the Vedas, as the name suggests, and was first organized and captured in Sanskrit in ciphered form by physicians teaching their students judicious practice of healing. These ciphers are termed slokas and are purposefully designed to include several meanings, to be interpreted appropriately, known as 'tantra yukti' by the knowledgeable practitioner. Ayu means longevity or healthy life, and veda means human-interpreted and observable truths and provable science. The principles of Ayurveda include systematic means for allowing evidence, including truth by observation and experimentation, pratyaksha; attention to teachers with sufficient experience, aptoupadesha; analogy to things seen in Nature, anumana; and logical argument, yukti.

It was founded on several principles, including yama (time) and niyama (self-regulation) and placed emphasis on routines and adherence to cycles, as seen in Nature. For example, it directs that habits should be regulated to coincide with the demands of the body rather than the whimsical mind or evolving and changing nature of human intelligence. Thus, for the follower of ayurvedic medicine, food should only be taken when they are instinctively hungry rather than at an arbitrarily set meal-time. Ayurveda also teaches that when a person is tired, it is not wise to eat food or drink, but to rest, as the body's fire is low and must gather energy in order to alight the enzymes that are required to digest food. The same principles of regulated living, called Dinacharya, direct that work is the justification for rest and in order to get sufficient sleep, one should subject the body to rigorous exercise.&lt;ref&gt;Rao MV. A Textbook of Svasthavrtta, Chaukhambha Orientalia, Varanasi, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  Periodic fasting, or abstaining from all food and drink for short durations of one or two days helps regulate the elimination process and prevents illness. It is only in later years that practitioners of this system saw that people were not paying for their services, and in order to get their clients to pay, they introduced herbal remedies to begin with and later even started using metals and inorganic chemical compositions in the form of pills or potions to deal with symptoms.

=== Chinese culture ===

{{main article|Traditional Chinese medicine}}

'''Traditional Chinese medicine''' has more than 4,000 years of history as a system of medicine that is based on a philosophical concept of balance ( [[Yin Yang|yin and yang]], [[Qi]], [[Blood]], [[Jing (TCM)|Jing]], [[Bodily fluid]]s, the [[Wu Xing|Five Elements]], the [[emotion]]s, and the [[soul|spirit]]) approach to health that is rooted in [[Taoist]] philosophy and [[Chinese culture]]. As such, the concept of it as an alternative form of therapeutic practise is only found in the Western world.

The arrival into Britain of thousands of Chinese in the 1970s introduced '''[[Traditional Chinese Medicine]]''' – a system dating back to the Bronze Age or earlier that used '''[[acupuncture]]''', herbs, diet and exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robinson | first1 = N | year = 2006 | title = Integrated traditional Chinese medicine | url = | journal = Complementary Therapies in Clinical Practice | volume = 12 | issue = 2| pages = 132–40 | doi=10.1016/j.ctcp.2006.01.006| pmid = 16648091 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today there are more than 2,000 registered practitioners in the UK.

== Since the 1970s ==

Until the 1970s, western practitioners that were not part of the medical establishment were referred to "irregular practitioners", and were dismissed by the medical establishment as unscientific or [[quackery]].&lt;ref name=CHBHAMA/&gt; Irregular practice became increasingly marginalized as [[quackery]] and fraud, as western medicine increasingly incorporated scientific methods and discoveries, and had a corresponding increase in success of its treatments. In the 1970s, irregular practices were grouped with traditional practices of nonwestern cultures, and with other unproven or disproven practices that were not part of biomedicine, and the entire group began to be marketed and promoted as "alternative medicine".&lt;ref name=CHBHAMA/&gt;&lt;ref name=ATRAMM/&gt; Following the [[counterculture movement]] of the 1960s, misleading marketing campaigns promoting "alternative medicine" as an effective "alternative" to biomedicine, and with changing social attitudes about not using chemicals, challenging the establishment and authority of any kind, sensitivity to giving equal measure to values and beliefs of other cultures and their practices through [[cultural relativism]], adding [[postmodernism]] and [[deconstructivism]] to ways of thinking about science and its deficiencies, and with growing frustration and desperation by patients about limitations and side effects of [[science-based medicine]], use of alternative medicine in the west began to rise, then had explosive growth beginning in the 1990s, when senior level political figures began promoting alternative medicine, and began diverting government medical research funds into research of alternative, complementary, and integrative medicine.&lt;ref name=CHBHAMA/&gt;&lt;ref name=NCHAMA/&gt;&lt;ref name=RRCAM/&gt;&lt;ref name=ATRAMM/&gt;&lt;ref name="FrontlineAF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TAMUUS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TT"/&gt;

[[File:Tom Harkin and junk food.jpg|thumb|right|Sen. Tom Harkin at a press conference.]]
In 1991, after United States Senator [[Thomas Harkin]] became convinced his allergies were cured by taking [[bee pollen]] pills, he used $2 million of his discretionary funds to create the Office of Alternative Medicine (OAM), to test the efficacy of alternative medicine and alert the public as the results of testing its efficacy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nih.gov/about/almanac/organization/NCCAM.htm#events Important Events in NCCAM History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150104222944/http://www.nih.gov/about/almanac/organization/NCCAM.htm |date=2015-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The OAM mission statement was that it was “dedicated to exploring complementary and alternative healing practices in the context of rigorous science; training complementary and alternative medicine researchers; and disseminating authoritative information to the public and professionals.” [[Joseph M. Jacobs]] was appointed the first director of the OAM in 1992. Jacobs' insistence on rigorous scientific methodology caused friction with Senator Harkin. Harkin criticized the "unbendable rules of randomized clinical trials" and, citing his use of bee pollen to treat his allergies, stated: "It is not necessary for the scientific community to understand the process before the American public can benefit from these therapies."&lt;ref name="natural-causes"&gt;{{cite book | title = Natural causes: death, lies, and politics in America's vitamin and herbal supplement industry | author=Dan Hurley | publisher = [[Broadway Books]] | year = 2006 | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-7679-2042-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing political resistance to the use of scientific methodology was publicly criticized by Dr. Jacobs and another OAM board member complained that “nonsense has trickled down to every aspect of this office”. In 1994, Senator Harkin responded by appearing on television with cancer patients who blamed Dr. Jacobs for blocking their access to untested cancer treatment, leading Jacobs to resign in frustration. The OAM drew increasing criticism from eminent members of the scientific community, from a Nobel laureate criticizing the degrading parts of the NIH to the level a cover for quackery, and the president of the [[American Physical Society]] criticizing spending on testing practices that “violate basic laws of physics and more clearly resemble witchcraft”. In 1998, the President of the [[North Carolina Medical Association]] publicly called for shutting down the OAM. The NIH Director placed the OAM under more strict scientific NIH control.

In 1998, Sen. Harkin responded to the criticism and stricter scientific controls by the NIH, by raising the OAM to the level of an independent center, increasing its budget to $90 million annually, and renaming it to be the [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]] (NCCAM). The United States Congress approved the appropriations without dissent. NCCAM had a mandate to promote a more rigorous and scientific approach to the study of alternative medicine, research training and career development, outreach, and integration. In 2014 the agency was renamed to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH). The NCCIH charter requires that 12 of the 18 council members shall be selected with a preference to selecting leading representatives of complementary and alternative medicine, 9 of the members must be licensed practitioners of alternative medicine, 6 members must be general public leaders in the fields of public policy, law, health policy, economics, and management, and 3 members must represent the interests of individual consumers of complementary and alternative medicine.

By 2009, the NCCIH budget had grown from annual spending of about $2 million at its inception, to $123 million annually. In 2009, after a history of 17 years of government testing produced almost no clearly proven efficacy of alternative therapies, Senator Harkin complained, “One of the purposes of this center was to investigate and validate alternative approaches. Quite frankly, I must say publicly that it has fallen short. It think quite frankly that in this center and in the office previously before it, most of its focus has been on disproving things rather than seeking out and approving.”&lt;ref name=THWS&gt;Tom Harkin’s War on Science, Peter Lipson, Discover Magazine editor's opinion in New York Times, 3-2-2009, {{cite web |url=https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/tom-harkins-war-on-science-or-meet-the-new-boss/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150531042042/https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/tom-harkins-war-on-science-or-meet-the-new-boss/ |archivedate=2015-05-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the scientific and biomedical communities complained that after a history of 17 years of being tested, at a cost of over $2.5 Billion on testing scientifically and biologically implausible practices, almost no alternative therapy showed clear efficacy.&lt;ref name="$2.5 billion"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/31190909/ |title= $2.5 billion spent, no alternative cures found |work= [[NBCNews.com]] |department= Alternative Medicine |agency= [[Associated Press]] |date= 2009-06-10 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090613033017/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/31190909 |archivedate= 2009-06-13 |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other periods ===

The terms ‘alternative’ and ‘complementary’ tend to be used interchangeably to describe a wide diversity of therapies that attempt to use the self-healing powers of the body by amplifying natural recuperative processes to restore health.  In ancient Greece the Hippocratic movement, commonly regarded as the fathers of medicine, actually gave rise to modern naturopathy and indeed much of today’s CAM.&lt;ref&gt;Inglis, B. (1979). Natural medicine. London, Collins&lt;/ref&gt;  They placed great emphasis on a good diet and healthy lifestyle to restore equilibrium; drugs were used more to support healing than to cure disease.

Complementary medicines have evolved through history and become formalised from primitive practices; although many were developed during the 19th century as alternatives to the sometimes harmful practices of the time, such as blood-lettings and purgation.  In the UK, the medical divide between CAM and conventional medicine has been characterised by conflict, intolerance and prejudice on both sides and during the early 20th century CAM was virtually outlawed in Britain: healers were seen as freaks and hypnotherapists were subject to repeated attempts at legal restriction.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Fulder|Fulder, S.]] (1996).  ''The handbook of alternative and complementary medicine''. 3rd edition.  London, Vermilion&lt;/ref&gt;  The alternative health movement is now accepted as part of modern life, having progressed from a grass-roots revival in the 1960s reacting against environmental degradation, unhealthy diets and rampant consumerism.

Until the arrival of the Romans in AD43, medical practices were limited to a basic use of plant materials, prayers and incantations.  Having assimilated the corpus of Hippocrates, the Romans brought with them a vast reparatory of '''herbal treatments''' and introduced the concept of the hospital as a centralised treatment centre.  In Britain, '''[[hydrotherapy]]''' (the use of water either internally or externally to maintain health and prevent disease) can be traced back to Roman spas.&lt;ref&gt;Internet Health Library (2006).  What is hydrotherapy?  Available from: {{cite web |url=http://www.internethealthlibrary.com/Therapies/Hydrotherapy.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-04-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517070716/http://www.internethealthlibrary.com/Therapies/Hydrotherapy.htm |archivedate=2008-05-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was augmented by practices from the Far East and China introduced by traders using the Silk Road.

During the Catholic and Protestant witch-hunts from the 14th to the 17th centuries, the activities of traditional folk-healers were severely curtailed and knowledge was often lost as it existed only as an oral tradition.  The widespread emigration from Europe to North America in the 18th and 19th centuries included both the knowledge of herbalism and some of the plants themselves.  This was combined with Native American medicine and then re-imported to the UK where it re-integrated with the surviving herbal traditions to evolve as today’s '''medical [[herbalism]]''' movement.&lt;ref&gt;Griggs, B. (1991).  Green pharmacy: a history of herbal medicine.  Rochester, Healing Arts Press&lt;/ref&gt;

The natural law of similia similibus curantur, or ‘like is cured by like’, was recognised by Hippocrates but was only developed as a practical healing system in the early 19th century by a German, Dr Samuel Hahnemann.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Jonas W. |author2=Kaptchuk T. |author3=Linde K. | year = 2003 | title = A critical overview of homeopathy | url = | journal = Annals of Internal Medicine | volume = 138 | issue = 5| pages = 393–99 | doi=10.7326/0003-4819-138-5-200303040-00009 | pmid=12614092}}&lt;/ref&gt;  '''[[Homeopathy]]''' was brought to the UK in the 1830s by a Dr Quinn who introduced it to the British aristocracy, whose patronage continues to this day.  Despite arousing controversy in conventional medical circles, homeopathy is available under the National Health Service, and in Scotland approximately 25% of GPs hold qualifications in homeopathy or have undergone some homeopathic training.&lt;ref&gt;Scottish Parliament (2004).

The impact on CAM of mass immigration into the UK is continuing into the 21st century.  Originating in Japan, '''[[cryotherapy]]''' has been developed by Polish researchers into a system that claims to produce lasting relief from a variety of conditions such as rheumatism, psoriasis and muscle pain.&lt;ref&gt;Marek UK Ltd.

The use of CAM is widespread and increasing across the developed world.  The British are presented with a wide choice of treatments from the traditional to the innovative and technological.

== Relativist perspective ==

The term [[alternative medicine]] refers to systems of medical thought and practice which function{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} as alternatives to or subsist outside of conventional, mainstream [[medicine]]. Alternative medicine cannot exist absent an established, authoritative and stable medical orthodoxy to which it can function as an alternative. Such orthodoxy was only established in the [[Western world|West]] during the nineteenth century through processes of regulation, [[Health association|association]], institution building and systematised [[medical education]].{{sfn|Bivins|2007|p=171|ps=}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7614">'''Iconclass''' is a specialized [[library classification]] designed for [[art]] and [[iconography]]. It was originally conceived by [[Henri van de Waal]], and was further developed by a group of scholars after his death.

==Development based on Dewey Decimal system==
The Iconclass system is one of the largest classification system for cultural content and possibly the largest for visual arts content. Initially designed for historical imagery, it is now also used to create subject access to texts and to classify a wide range of images, including modern photography. At the moment it contains over 28,000 unique concepts (classification types) and has an entry vocabulary of 14,000 keywords. Like the [[Dewey Decimal Classification]] system, it has 10 main "divisions" or points of entry, and these are:
*0 Abstract, Non-representational Art
*1 Religion and Magic
*2 Nature
*3 Human being, Man in general
*4 Society, Civilization, Culture
*5 Abstract Ideas and Concepts
*6 History
*7 Bible
*8 Literature
*9 Classical Mythology and Ancient History

Each division has 9 or 10 subdivisions, and so on. It can be consulted with the help of the freely available [http://www.iconclass.org/ Iconclass 2100 browser]. Iconclass was developed in the Netherlands as a standard classification for recording collections, with the idea of assembling huge databases that will allow the retrieval of images featuring particular details, subjects or other common factors.  It was developed in the 1970s and was loosely based on the Dewey Decimal System because it was meant to be used in art library [[card catalog]]s.

==Usage in data records==
The iconclass code represents a concept and objects can be assigned a code indicating that the object depicts that concept. For example, the iconclass code "71H7131" is for the subject of "[[Bathsheba]] (alone) with David's letter". The code is built from "7" for bible, "71" for "[[Old Testament]]", "71H" the "story of [[David]]", "71H7" for "David and Bathsheba", "71H71" for "David observing Bathsheba bathing", and "71H713" for "Bathsheba receiving a letter from David". 
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Peter Paul Rubens - Bathsheba at the Fountain - WGA20270.jpg|71H713
File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn 016.jpg|71H7131
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Depicting the iconclass concept===
To see all images in the [[RKD|RKDimages]] database that depict "Bathsheba receiving a letter from David", the associated iconclass code 71H713 can be used as a special search term.&lt;ref&gt;[https://rkd.nl/en/explore/images#filters%5Biconclass_code%5D=71H713  All available records for iconclass code "71H713"] in RKDimages&lt;/ref&gt; On selecting [[:File:Peter Paul Rubens - Bathsheba at the Fountain - WGA20270.jpg|one of these paintings]] and viewing its record in RKDimages, the code 71H713 can be seen under two sections; under the section for "subject" and under the section for "suggested searches".&lt;ref&gt;[https://rkd.nl/explore/images/28726 Example for record 28726] for [[Pieter Paul Rubens]] version of Bathsheba receiving David's Letter ( 2 Samuel 11: 1-27), Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden, c. 1635&lt;/ref&gt;

===The iconclass concept as a subject===
Everyone with an account can add to the iconclass hierarchy. Some of these hierarchies are quite detailed, such as for stories of the Old Testament that were popular in the arts during the 17th-century. The problems of using iconclass codes for concepts is that they are a bit too precise. In the previous search example for 71H713 in the RKDimages database, the painting record for [[Bathsheba at Her Bath (Rembrandt)|Rembrandt's Bathsheba in the Louvre]] was excluded from the search, because the iconclass code assigned to that painting in the RKDimages database is not 71H713, but 71H7131, and searching for that code will result in other images to be returned.&lt;ref&gt;[https://rkd.nl/en/explore/images#filters%5Biconclass_code%5D=71H7131  All available records for iconclass code "71H7131"] in RKDimages&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage by organizations==
A number of collections of different types have been classified using Iconclass, notably many types of [[old master print]], the collections of the [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin]] and the German [[Marburger Index]]. These can be matched to each other through the iconclass "hierarchy of somethings" to the current classification structure of the holder's collection. Completed iconclass projects are available, often online, but also published on [[DVD]].&lt;ref&gt;Iconclass website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rosspub.com/iconclass.htm Ross Publishing – examples for sale] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080220200839/http://www.kb.nl/manuscripts/browser/index.html |date=2008-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ideally however, iconclass coding is never finished, as it is also possible to keep adding codes to the system to identify more concepts. The system can also be used outside pure art history, though it is most often used in museum websites.

The content of Iconclass is currently maintained by the [[Rijksbureau voor Kunsthistorische Documentatie]] (Netherlands Institute for Art History). The online Iconclass browser is developed by the Henri van de Waal Foundation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25184">The '''imaging of cultural heritage''' is a necessary part of long term preservation of [[cultural heritage]]. While the physical conditions of objects will change over time, imaging serves as a way to document and represent heritage in a moment in time of the life of the item. Different methods of imaging produce results that are applicable in various circumstances. Not every method is appropriate for every object, and not every object needs to be imaged by multiple methods. In addition to preservation and conservation related concerns, imaging can also serve to enhance research and study of cultural heritage.

== Purpose ==
One reason for imaging objects is to make the items available for study and scholarship without incurring unnecessary harm to the object.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.betterlight.com/downloads/whitePaper/wp_museum_lighting.pdf|title=Light Exposure to Sensitive Artworks during Digital Photography|last=|first=|date=|website=|page=6|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to providing images to scholars, images can also be added to online catalogs and databases to increase the size of the audience interacting with the objects and allow them to view the item with no added risk.

Another reason is for documentary purposes, especially as it relates to conservation. According to the American Institute for Conservation, “Documentation is basic to the ethical practice of conservation.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The AIC Guide to Digital Photography and Conservation Documentation|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Imaging prior to conservation allows conservators to record the current state of the object, which can then be compared to later images following conservation. This allows someone in the future to look back and see the ways in which an item was impacted by conservation. Images taken over different periods of time can also reveal changes in condition and can be used to minimize damage going forward. The [[American Institute for Conservation]]'s Guide to Digital Photography and Conservation Documentation is a useful reference guide for the application of digital imaging to the field of conservation. It details guidelines for equipment, techniques, and practices that are in line with best practices for conservation. This covers everything from suggestions for types of cameras and memory cards to discussing processing details and how to apply metadata.

An additional purpose is found in the way imaging enhances scholarship. Different types of imaging can reveal materials and techniques used in creating an object that are not immediately evident with the naked eye.

== Methods ==
There are many methods that are employed in imaging. These may include different types of lighting as well as the use of radiography.  Multiple energy levels and technologies have been used for cultural heritage imaging, including imaging mummy masks with multiple spectral bands of light, different x-ray technologies, optical coherence tomography, and terahertz imaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ucl.ac.uk/dh/projects/deepimaging/technologies|title=Deep Imaging Mummy Cases: Technologies|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Photographing objects under standard conditions is a typical practice to preserve the item in perpetuity, but not every object will need more specialized imaging. Those doing the imaging or requesting the imaging be done will look at each object on a case by case basis to determine the usefulness of specialized imaging. In some cases combinations of different types of imaging will be more effective than one type on its own. This can be seen in projects like the [[J. Paul Getty Museum|Getty]]'s conservation of Guercino’s ''Jacob Blessing the Sons of Joseph''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.getty.edu/iris/conservators-get-to-know-guercinos-jacob-blessing-the-sons-of-joseph/|title=Conservators Get to Know Guercino's Jacob Blessing the Sons of Joseph|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Getty's APPEAR project, details of which can be found on a blog by the Penn Museum's Artifact Lab.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.penn.museum/sites/artifactlab/tag/appear-project/|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Photography ===
[[Photography]] under normal illumination will produce a record of the appearance of an object in standard conditions. Standard conditions typically mean uniform illumination with minimal glare. In conservation, these images will serve as a "before treatment" record. They can also serve as a catalog image for in-house use or an online collection. Following a standard image capture, subsequent images can be taken under various conditions to highlight areas that need treatment or closer monitoring.

==== Raking illumination ====

''Further information:[[Raking light]]''
[[File:Early Bronze Age, Arreton Type Developed Flat Axehead (FindID 139019-194932).jpg|left|thumb|Raking light allows the viewer to see hammering scars that are not evident in standard lighting conditions.]]
Raking illumination highlights texture on the surface of an object. This is achieved by using a single light source at a low angle relative to the object. Images taken under these conditions can reveal deviations in the surface of an object – gouges, scratches, paint loss, bulges, and more. With archaeological objects this may reveal how tools were made or how food was processed (e.g. cut marks on bones). In paintings it can show how the artist used the paint.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/ophelia/conservation-ophelia/raking-light-and-relief|title=Raking light and relief|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Specular illumination ====

Specular illumination documents the surface sheen of an object. With paintings, it is used to highlight areas of abnormality. While raking illumination will produce a record of these abnormalities with greater clarity, specular illumination is less dependent on the orientation of the light. There are two basic set ups for specular illumination – axial and oblique. An axial setup requires the camera and the light source to be on the same axis. The camera is parallel to the surface of the object, and the light source is next to the camera. An oblique setup requires the camera and the light source to be on opposite sides of the subject, but each are at the same angle relative to the object. Specular light can allow conservators to see tool marks on wooden objects, or indentations that seemed invisible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hki.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/about/services/photographicservices/lightingtechniques|title=Lighting Techniques|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Transmitted illumination ====

[[File:US Navy 040924-N-6213R-038 Intelligence Specialist 2nd Class Damon Jenkins of Los Angeles, Calif., reviews aerial reconnaissance imagery on a light table in the Carrier Intelligence Center (CVIC).jpg|thumb|Transmitted illumination is similar to the effects of a light table or lightbox on a two dimensional object. |201x201px]]
Transmitted illumination is used to highlight thickness and losses among other things. Transmitted illumination uses a light source that is behind the object being photographed. (For two dimensional objects this has a very similar function to a light table.) This “back lighting” provides a way to see things like cracks and holes as well as revealing the general structure of an item. With something like papyrus, it can help to reveal the condition of the individual fibers. It can also be useful with textiles or basketry items where a tight weave may make it difficult to see damage or clues about how the item was woven.

=== Infrared Photography ===
[[File:Infrared reflectography-en.svg|left|thumb]]
[[Infrared photography]] has been used in conservation since the 1930s. In art the most well-known application is being able to see underdrawings of paintings or changes in composition. [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]]'s the Blue Room is a famous example of this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://colourlex.com/project/ir-reflectography/|title=Infrared Reflectography|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been used to enhance legibility of manuscripts and inscriptions, as seen with the Dead Sea Scrolls&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.deadseascrolls.org.il/?locale=en_US|title=The Dead Sea Scrolls Digital Library|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the International Dunhuang Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://idp.bl.uk/papers/infrared/index.html|title=Infrared Photography|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carbon black ink tends to show up very well under infrared.

=== Ultraviolet Photography ===
[[Ultraviolet photography]] is frequently used for differentiation and characterization of materials. Ultraviolet radiation can cause materials to emit fluorescence that can be seen and photographed. The intensity and color of the fluorescence is influenced by the amount of material, the types of materials, and the amount of deterioration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The AIC Guide to Digital Photography and Conservation Documentation|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UV radiation can also reveal things not visible to the naked eye. Codex Sinaiticus contains the oldest, complete copy of the New Testament. On the last page of the Gospel of John UV radiation shows that the final sentence was added later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The First Edition of the New Testament|last=Trobisch|first=David|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the implications for this are rooted in biblical scholarship, this shows that there is more to manuscripts than what is found at the surface level. In conservation this shows that with UV radiation even the “invisible” becomes part of the record for the object and must be documented and monitored.

With paintings, UV can reveal where prior restorations have occurred. The varnish on top of a painting is usually more fluorescent than the pigments. If there is paint on top of a varnish, the conservator knows that there has been some restoration in the past. UV can also help to reveal materials used in a painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/ophelia/conservation-ophelia/ultra-violet-light|title=Ultra-violet light|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Multi-Spectral Imaging (MSI) ===
[[File:ArPalimTyp2.jpg|left|thumb|The original text of the [[Archimedes Palimpsest]] can be seen after imaging.|343x343px]]
A [[Multispectral image]] is an image with capture points across the light spectrum. Different wavelengths of light are separated by filters or illuminated with narrow bands of light. These filters can also be combined with different colors of light as well as IR and UV to produce different results and fluorescence. MSI has been used in several major projects regarding ancient manuscripts. Not only is this useful for making these texts legible and available, but these images are useful for conservation. By recording things that are not easily seen, MSI helps conservators to be aware of what they couldn’t see and allows them to monitor these conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The AIC Guide to Digital Photography and Conservation Documentation|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be seen in examples of paintings like the Mummy Portraits. The Penn Museum has shown through MSI that one of their portraits has an outline of the figure etched in the paint. This is something that was not visible under standard conditions, and something they didn't notice on other portraits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.penn.museum/sites/artifactlab/2016/01/15/appear-project-multispectral-imaging-on-the-fayum-mummy-portraits/|title=APPEAR Project – Multispectral Imaging on the Fayum Mummy Portraits|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MSI also helps scholars to be able to read previously illegible texts. The Archimedes Palimpsest (further discussed below) is a famous example of this, but many other [[palimpsest]]s have been rendered legible by this process. Multiple groups, institutions and companies work to image manuscripts using MSI and other methods to digitally preserve them, make them accessible to scholars, and improve legibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.library.duke.edu/bitstreams/2017/04/24/multispectral-imaging-whats-good/|title=Multispectral Imaging, What's It Good For?|website=Duke University Libraries|last=|first=|date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) ===
[[Optical Coherence Tomography]] can help reveal layers and 3D visualizations of text in various media, including papyrus and paper. It has been used with multispectral imaging to provide more information about text and ink on different layers of an object. This has been used in research into papyrus mummy mask cartonnage to 
image  small  areas  of  cartonnage in conjunction with narrowband multispectral imaging to reveal ink layers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ucl.ac.uk/dh/projects/deepimaging/pubs/ISTMummy_OCT_MSI.pdf|title=Integrating Optical Imaging of Mummy Mask Cartonnage|website=|last=|first=|date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI) ===
[[Reflectance Transformation Imaging]] uses special procedures to create a [[Polynomial texture mapping|polynomial texture map]] of an object. These PTMs are created from a set of images using a stationary camera and a single source of light that can be held in different positions.

The following is quoted from Cultural Heritage Imaging's website:

"RTI images are created from information derived from multiple digital photographs of a subject shot from a stationary camera position. In each photograph, light is projected from a different known, or knowable, direction. This process produces a series of images of the same subject with varying highlights and shadows. Lighting information from the images is mathematically synthesized to generate a mathematical model of the surface, enabling a user to re-light the RTI image interactively and examine its surface on a screen.

Each RTI resembles a single, two-dimensional (2D) photographic image. Unlike a typical photograph, reflectance information is derived from the three-dimensional (3D) shape of the image subject and encoded in the image per pixel, so that the synthesized RTI image “knows” how light will reflect off the subject. When the RTI is opened in RTI viewing software, each constituent pixel is able to reflect the software's interactive “virtual” light from any position selected by the user. This changing interplay of light and shadow in the image discloses fine details of the subject's 3D surface form.

RTI was invented by Tom Malzbender and Dan Gelb, research scientists at Hewlett-Packard Labs. A landmark paper describing these first tools and methods, named Polynomial Texture Mapping (PTM), was published in 2001."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://culturalheritageimaging.org/Technologies/RTI/|title=Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI): What is it?|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RTI has several applications for cultural heritage. In many instances PTMs can improve the legibility of inscriptions, such as metal amulets whose inscriptions have been obscured by corrosion. PTMs have also been found to be useful in analyzing ceramics and paintings. Cracks and pitting that wasn't visible under standard conditions became visible using RTI. The Tate and the National Gallery investigated the use of PTMs and determined that they could be viable alternatives to raking light; especially since PTMs were found to be more easily replicated than raking light photographs.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Payne|first=E.M.|title=Imaging Techniques in Conservation|journal=Journal of Conservation and Museum Studies|volume=10|issue=2|pages=17–29|doi=10.5334/jcms.1021201|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With manuscripts RTI can highlight the shape and structure of pages. While these pages are typically viewed as two dimensional items, RTI makes them three dimensional and shows that there is more than just a flat page. This is helpful for legibility (for scholars) and for condition (for conservators). Scholars can see the text more clearly and may even be able to see text that was erased. This is especially true in conditions where the ink "ate" letter-shaped holes into the page surface. Conservators can use the PTMs to determine the degree of damage to the surface, as cracks, buckling, and holes become much more pronounced.

For examples of the types of results RTI can produce see the videos on Cultural Heritage Imaging's Website http://culturalheritageimaging.org/Technologies/RTI/

=== Radiography ===
{{see|Radiography of cultural objects}}
[[Radiography]] is a non-destructive analysis of the internal structure of an object, that uses x-rays to create an image. For paintings this means that conservators can potentially see the inner structure of the painting and learn about the materials and techniques used by the original artist. Radiography can also be used on archaeological objects or sculptures to learn more about the internal structure of the items that would otherwise be invisible without destroying the object.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iaea.org/inis/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/45/086/45086050.pdf|title=Application of Digital Radiography in the Analysis of Cultural Heritage|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of imaging produces a two-dimensional image of the inner workings of the item. X-ray technology has been used to read the damaged [[Herculaneum papyri|Herculaneum Papyri]] as opposed to trying to unroll the scroll to read its contents. As part of a conservation measure on the [[Ghent Altarpiece]] x-rays were created to better understand how the piece was painted and put together. Images from that project can be viewed on the [http://closertovaneyck.kikirpa.be/#intro Closer to Van Eyck website]. On the Penn [https://www.penn.museum/sites/artifactlab/tag/x-radiography/ Museum's Artifact Lab blog] there are multiple entries discussing the applications of radiography on cultural heritage.

[[CT scan|CT Scan]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s create a three-dimensional image from many 2-D radiographic images. This produces cross sections of images and allows for the isolation of layers. Like the 2-D images, this allows for a look at the inner sections of objects without causing damage. CT scans have been used on mummies (more similar to traditional medical uses of CT scans) as well as other objects, like cuneiform tablets. CT scans have also been used on papyrus scrolls to digitally unroll them - allowing for them to be read, but not causing any harm. The [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] in London has used CT scans to take images of some of their specimens and create 3D models. This is a much less invasive technique than the traditional model of molding and casting.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; All of these applications have the goal of being as noninvasive as possible while still trying to gather as much information as possible.

[[Magnetic resonance imaging|Magnetic Resonance Imaging]] is a technique used in radiology that does not use x-rays. It is mainly used in medical imaging to generate images of the organs of the body. It can also be applied to deceased individuals. For example, a female burial from Novosibirsk, Russia was found to have suffered from breast cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.archaeology.org/news/2628-141016-ukok-princess-cancer|title=MRI Shows 'Princess Ukok' Suffered From Breast Cancer|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of imaging allows for a noninvasive analysis of past individuals to help scientists better understand past human ancestors.

== Examples ==
There are hundreds and possibly thousands of examples of projects that use noninvasive imaging techniques. Highlighted here are several that are more commonly known.

=== Archimedes Palimpsest ===
[[File:Archimedes Palimpsest.jpg|left|thumb|Archimedes Palimpsest]]
The [[Archimedes Palimpsest]] is a parchment manuscript that contains writings from two different time periods. In the 13th century monks erased and wrote over a 10th century copy of some works originally written by Archimedes. Through a combination of different imaging techniques (MSI, raking illumination and X-ray fluorescence) and various processing procedures the older layer became legible.

=== Syriac Galen Palimpsest ===
The Syriac Galen Palimpsest is a parchment manuscript with an early translation of the Greek medical philosopher Galen of Pergamon overwritten with psalms for days of the week.  MSI and later x-ray fluorescence were used to reveal the undertext of Galen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/02/science/medicines-hidden-roots-in-an-ancient-manuscript.html|title=Medicine's Hidden Roots in an Ancient Manuscript|website=New York Times|last=|first=|date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Egyptian mummies ===
With the use of imaging technologies, research can be conducted on mummies without having to unwrap them. A 2014 exhibition at the British Museum highlighted these imaging techniques in conjunction with the eight mummies that were imaged. The CT scans produced allow for a digital layer by layer look at the burials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/whats_on/exhibitions/ancient_lives,_new_discoveries.aspx?fromShortUrl|title=Eight mummies|website=British Museum|access-date=2017-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mummy masks have been studied with six different imaging technologies in a global project involving multiple institutions to demonstrate the feasibility of using non-destructive digital imaging technology to make texts visible in images of papyrus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ucl.ac.uk/dh/projects/deepimaging|title=Deep Imaging Mummy Cases|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cuneiform tablets and envelopes ===
CT scanners have been used to look at cuneiform tablets layer by layer in order to reproduce them with a 3D printer. This has been done at Cornell University and at TU Delft (“Scanning for Syria”) where scans were done of silicon molds rather than original tablets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.citg.tudelft.nl/en/research/stories-of-science/geoscience-engineering/scanning-for-syria/|title=Scanning for Syria|website=Delft University of Technology|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a presentation titled, “Using CT to Image and 3D print Cuneiform Tablets without Removing Them from Their Envelopes,” at the ASOR annual meeting in 2016 Dr. Andrew Shortland discussed how his team had figured out a way to isolate the inner tablet from the envelope and read what was on it without breaking the outer, envelope layer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asor.org/am/2016/documents/2016%20ASOR%20Program%20Book.pdf|title=ASOR Program Guide 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5851">'''Kremlinology''' is the study and analysis of the politics and policies of Russia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Kremlinology" definition|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/kremlinology|website=merriam-webster.com|publisher=Merriam-Webster Online|accessdate=16 February 2015|quote=Definition of KREMLINOLOGY: the study of the policies and practices of the former Soviet government}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the term '''Sovietology''' means the study of politics and policies of the [[Soviet Union]] and former communist states more generally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Sovietology" definition|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Sovietology|website=thefreedictionary.com|publisher=The Free Dictionary|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two terms were synonymous until the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]]. In popular culture, the term is sometimes used to mean any attempt to understand a secretive organization or process, such as plans for upcoming products or events, by interpreting indirect clues.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

The term is named after the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]], the seat of today's Russian and then-Soviet government. Kremlinologist refers to academic, media, and commentary experts who specialize in the study of Kremlinology. The term is sometimes sweepingly used to describe Western scholars who researched issues of, or specialized in, Russian/Soviet law, although the correct term is simply [[List of Russian legal historians|''Russian law'' scholar]]. Sovietologists or Kremlinologists should also be distinguished from [[Transitology|transitologists]], scholars who study legal, economic and social transitions from [[communism]] to [[capitalism]].

==Techniques==
During the [[Cold War]], lack of reliable information about the country forced Western analysts to "read between the lines" and to use the tiniest tidbits, such as the removal of portraits, the rearranging of chairs, positions at the reviewing stand for parades in [[Red Square]], the choice of capital or small initial letters in phrases such as "First Secretary", the arrangement of articles on the pages of the party newspaper ''[[Pravda]]'' and other indirect signs to try to understand what was happening in internal Soviet politics.

To study the relations between Communist fraternal states, Kremlinologists compare the statements issued by the respective national [[Communist Party|Communist parties]], looking for omissions and discrepancies in the ordering of objectives. The description of state visits in the Communist press are also scrutinized, as well as the degree of [[hospitality]] lent to dignitaries. Kremlinology also emphasizes [[ritual]], in that it notices and ascribes meaning to the unusual absence of a policy statement on a certain anniversary or holiday.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Sino-Vietnamese Conflict|first=Eugene K.|last=Lawson|publisher=Praeger|year=1984|pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the German language, such attempts acquired the somewhat derisive name "Kreml-Astrologie" (Kremlin Astrology), hinting at the fact that its results were often vague and inconclusive, if not outright wrong.

==After the Cold War==
The term "Kremlinology" is still in use in application to the study of decision-making processes in the [[Politics of Russia|politics of the Russian Federation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ipec-eu.ru/programmnyie-materialyi Poland is in the Eurasian Union: the mythology of Russian-Polish relations. Eurasian Club East - West, October 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121207030814/http://ipec-eu.ru/programmnyie-materialyi |date=2012-12-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In popular culture, the term is sometimes used to mean any attempt to understand a secretive organization or process, such as plans for upcoming products or events, by interpreting indirect clues.

While the Soviet Union no longer exists, other secretive states still do, such as [[North Korea]], for which Kremlinology-like approaches are still used by the Western media.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3490">The '''Lebombo bone''' is a [[bone tool]] made of a baboon [[fibula]] with incised markings discovered in the [[Lebombo Mountains]] located between South Africa and Swaziland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Beaumont |first1=Peter B. |year=1973 |title=Border Cave – A Progress Report |journal=S. Afr. J. Science |volume=69 |issue= |pages=41–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in the section of the notches indicate the use of different cutting edges, which the bone's discoverer, Peter Beaumont, views as evidence for their having been made, like other markings found all over the world, during participation in rituals.

The bone is between 44,200 and 43,000 years old, according to 24 radiocarbon datings.&lt;ref&gt;Francesco d’Errico et al. (2012) Early evidence of San material culture represented by organic artifacts from Border Cave, South Africa. ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'' '''109'''(33): 13214-13219. It is called a notched bone, illustrated in Fig. 1, ''12'' {{cite journal |title=Early evidence of San material culture represented by organic artifacts from Border Cave, South Africa |doi=10.1073/pnas.1204213109 |volume=109 |issue=33 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |pages=13214–13219 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/109/33/13214.long|year=2012 |last1=d'Errico |first1=F. |last2=Backwell |first2=L. |last3=Villa |first3=P. |last4=Degano |first4=I. |last5=Lucejko |first5=J.

B. |pmc=3421171 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is far older than the [[Ishango bone]] with which it is sometimes confused. Other notched bones are 80,000 years old but it is unclear if the notches are merely decorative or if they 
bear a functional meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Ralf Vogelsang et al. (2010) New excavations of Middle Stone Age deposits at Apollo 11 Rockshelter, Namibia: stratigraphy, archaeology, chronology and past environments. ''Journal of African Archaeology'' '''8'''(2): 185–218 {{cite web |last1=Richter |first1=Jürgen |display-authors=etal |title=New Excavations of Middle Stone Age Deposits at Apollo 11 Rockshelter, Namibia: Stratigraphy, Archaeology, Chronology and Past Environments |url=https://www.academia.edu/4106767/New_Excavations_at_Apollo_11_Namibia_Ralf_Vogelsang_et_al._}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[The Universal Book of Mathematics]]'' the Lebombo bone's 29 notches suggest "it may have been used as a lunar phase counter, in which case African women may have been the first mathematicians, because keeping track of menstrual cycles requires a lunar calendar". However, the bone is clearly broken at one end, so the 29 notches may or may not be a minimum number. In the cases of other notched bones since found globally, there has been no consistent notch tally, many being in the 1–10 range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Beaumont |first1=Peter B. |last2=Bednarik |first2=Robert G. |year=2013 |title=Tracing the Emergence of Palaeoart in Sub-Saharan Africa |journal=Rock Art Research |volume=30 |number=1 |pages=33–54 |url=http://www.sahra.org.za/sites/default/files/additionaldocs/2013-01-29%2030-1%20BeaumontBed%20final.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''LibriVox''' is a group of worldwide volunteers who read and record [[public domain]] texts creating free public domain [[audiobook]]s for download from their website and other [[digital library]] hosting sites on the internet. It was founded in 2005 by Hugh McGuire to provide "Acoustical liberation of books in the public domain"&lt;ref name="Authorlibrivox"&gt;"[https://librivox.org/search?primary_key=0&amp;search_category=author&amp;search_page=1&amp;search_form=get_results/ LibriVox Author]", LibriVox website. Retrieved 16 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; and the LibriVox objective is "To make all books in the public domain available, for free, in audio format on the internet".&lt;ref name="aboutlibrivox"&gt;"[http://librivox.org/pages/about-librivox/ Objective LibriVox]", LibriVox website. Retrieved 24 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 August 2016, the project completed project number 10,000.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://librivox.org/2016/08/06/another-librivox-milestone-10000-projects/ Another LibriVox Milestone: 10,000 projects!]", librivox.org, 6 August 2016.

There are multiple affiliated projects that are providing additional content. LibriVox is closely affiliated with [[Project Gutenberg]] from where the project gets some of its texts, and the [[Internet Archive]] that hosts their offerings.

==History==
[[File:Hugh McGuire.jpg|thumb|Hugh McGuire, founder of LibriVox]]
{{Cquote|Can the net harness a bunch of volunteers to help bring books in the public domain to life through [[podcasting]]?|author=Hugh McGuire}}

LibriVox was started in August 2005 by [[Montreal]]-based writer Hugh McGuire, who set up a [[blog]], and posed the question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Hugh|last= McGuire|date=9 August 2005|url=http://librivox.org/2005/08/09/welcome-to-librivox/|title=Welcome to LibriVox|publisher=LibriVox.org|accessdate=20 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first=Hugh|last=McGuire|url=http://hughmcguire.net/2007/02/12/from-textosolvo-clarity-why-it-worked-1/|title=Clarity (blog entry)|date=February 12, 2007|publisher=HughMcGuire.net|accessdate=2009-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first recorded book&lt;ref&gt;"[https://librivox.org/the-secret-agent-by-joseph-conrad/ The Secret Agent]", librivox.org. Retrieved 31 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; was ''[[The Secret Agent]]'' by [[Joseph Conrad]].

The main features of the way LibriVox works have changed little since its inception, although the technology that supports it has been improved by the efforts of its volunteers with web-development skills.

== Etymology of LibriVox ==
''LibriVox'' is an invented word inspired by [[Latin]] words {{lang|la|liber}} (book) in its [[genitive]] form {{lang|la|libri}} and {{lang|la|vox}} (voice), giving the meaning ''BookVoice'' (or ''voice of the book''). The word was also coined because of other connotations: {{lang|la|liber}} also means ''child'' and ''free, independent, unrestricted''. As the LibriVox forum says: "We like to think LibriVox might be interpreted as 'child of the voice', and 'free voice'. Finally, the other link we like is 'library' so you could imagine it to mean Library of Voice."&lt;ref&gt;"[https://forum.librivox.org/viewtopic.php?f=18&amp;t=876 What does LibriVox mean?]", LibriVox forum, retrieved 29 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been no decision or consensus by LibriVox founders or the community of volunteers for a single pronunciation of LibriVox. It is accepted that any audible pronunciation is accurate.&lt;ref name="librivoxpronunciation"&gt;"[http://wiki.librivox.org/index.php/English_Pronunciation_Guides#Pronunciation_of_.22LibriVox.22 Pronunciation of "LibriVox"]", LibriVox wiki. Retrieved 21 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization and funding ==
LibriVox is a volunteer-run, free content, Public Domain project. It has no budget or [[legal person]]ality. The development of projects is managed through an [[Internet forum]], supported by an [[Forum administrator|admin]] team, who also maintain a searchable catalogue database of completed works.

In early 2010, LibriVox ran a fundraising drive to raise $20,000 to cover hosting costs for the website of about $5,000/year and improve front- and backend usability.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://librivox.org/2010/02/24/librivox-needs-your-help/ LibriVox Needs Your Help]", LibriVox blog, 24 February 2010. Retrieved 24 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The target was reached in 13 days, and so the fundraising ended and LibriVox suggested that supporters consider making donations to its affiliates and partners, [[Project Gutenberg]] &lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg:Partners,_Affiliates_and_Resources Gutenberg Affiliates]", Gutenberg.org, Retrieved 19 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Internet Archive]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://archive.org/details/librivoxaudio&amp;tab=about Archive.org partners]", Archive.org, Retrieved 19 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production process==
Volunteers can choose new projects to start, either recording on their own or inviting others to join them, or they can contribute to projects that have been started by others. Once a volunteer has recorded his or her contribution, it is uploaded to the site, and proof-listened by members of the LibriVox community.

Finished audiobooks are available from the LibriVox website, and [[MP3]] and [[Vorbis|Ogg Vorbis]] files are hosted separately by the [[Internet Archive]]. Recordings are also available through other means, such as [[iTunes Store|iTunes]], and, being free of copyright, they are frequently distributed independently of LibriVox on the Internet and otherwise.

==Content==
[[File:LibriVox works per month including May 2011.png|thumb|LibriVox works per month 2005–2011]]
LibriVox only records material that is in the [[public domain]] in the United States, and all LibriVox books are released with a public domain dedication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Public Domain |url=https://librivox.org/pages/public-domain/ |website=LibriVox |accessdate=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of copyright restrictions, LibriVox produces recordings of only a limited number of contemporary books. These have included, for example, the [[9/11 Commission Report]] which is a work of the US Federal Government therefore in the Public Domain. 

The LibriVox catalogue is varied. It contains much popular classic fiction, but also includes less predictable texts, such as [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' and a recording of the first 500 digits of [[pi]]. The collection also features poetry, plays, religious texts (for example, English versions of the [[Koran]] and books from various translations of the [[Bible]]) and non-fiction of various kinds. In January 2009, the catalogue contained approximately 55 percent fiction and drama, 25 percent non-fiction and 20 percent poetry (calculated by numbers of recordings). As of November 7, 2018, the most viewed item (6.5M) was ''[[The Adventures of Tom Sawyer]]'' in a 2006 solo recording by John Greenman.&lt;ref name="librivoxatia"&gt;"[https://archive.org/details/librivoxaudio The LibriVox Free Audiobook Collection]", The [[Internet Archive]]. Retrieved 7 November, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 90 percent of the catalogue is recorded in English, but recordings exist in 31 languages altogether ({{as of|2010|2|lc=y}}). Chinese, French and German are the most popular languages other than English amongst volunteers, but recordings have also been made in languages including [[Urdu]] and [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]].

==Reputation==
LibriVox has garnered significant interest, in particular from those interested in the promotion of volunteer-led content and alternative approaches to [[copyright]] ownership on the Internet.

It has received support from the [[Internet Archive]] and [[Project Gutenberg]]. Intellectual freedom and commons proponent [[Mike Linksvayer]] described it in 2008 as "perhaps the most interesting collaborative culture project this side of [[Wikipedia]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | date=June 2, 2008
 | accessdate=2009-01-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project has also been featured in press around the world and has been recommended by the BBC's [[Click (TV series)|Click]], MSNBC's [[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]], [[Reason (magazine)|Reason]],&lt;ref name="LibriVoxReason"&gt;"[http://reason.com/archives/2007/04/24/the-wealth-of-librivox/ The Wealth of LibriVox]", Reason.com, Retrieved 19 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]],&lt;ref name="LibriVoxWired"&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20080512012632/http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2005/12/69780 The Web Will Read You a Story]", archive.org, Retrieved 19 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; the US [[PC Magazine]] and the UK [[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|Metro]] and [[The Sunday Times|Sunday Times]]&lt;ref name="NYTLibriVox"&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/25/books/25audi.html?_r=2&amp; Public Domain Books, Ready for Your iPod]", nytimes.com, Retrieved 19 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; newspapers.

==Quality==
A frequent concern of listeners is the site's policy of allowing any recording to be published as long as it is understandable and faithful to the source text.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://forum.librivox.org/viewtopic.php?f=24&amp;t=36873 Quality of Delivery?]", Librivox forums. Retrieved 22 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that some recordings are of lower audio fidelity; some feature background noises, non-native accents or other perceived imperfections in comparison to professionally recorded audiobooks.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.reviewsandmore.net/2007/01/07/the-return-of-the-native-audiobook-librivox/ The Return of the Native Audiobook (Librivox)]", Review.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5376">'''The Loštice pottery,''' also called '''the Loštice goblets''', are unique Czech pottery with nodules on the surface. Traditionally they have been massively produced in [[Loštice]], a town in the [[Olomouc Region]] of the [[Czech Republic]] and the surrounding area (former North Moravia) since the end of the 14th or at the beginning of the 15th century and ceased to be manufactured sometime in the early 16th. These goblets have been a highly prized form of trading goods. They are found in many of the castles of Central Europe. The first slim brown-colored goblets with nodules in the surface were found in Loštice in 1874.&lt;ref&gt;Měřínský Z., Přehled typů loštické keramiky, jejich vývoj a datování, [w:] Vlastivědný věstník moravský 21, Brno 1969, p. 89-105&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology of production ==
The pottery from Loštice have been divided into five basic ceramics categories. The first comprises blister-marked surface ceramics (with the nodules), the second is very well baked, so-called stoneware, the third is made up of soft kaolinite clay, mostly white baked, the fourth includes sand, and the fifth contains graphite.&lt;ref&gt;Goš V., Loštice. Město středověkých hrnčířů, Opava 2007, p. 56-93, 117-123&lt;/ref&gt;
Craftsmen added graphite slate to fat clay. The Svinov deposits they used, however, contained a natural admixture of pyrite. The latter, when fired at high temperature, became active by creating intumescent gas bubbles, which burst, exploding, forming on the surface the small bumps or craters.&lt;ref&gt;Mackiewicz M., Post-Medieval artistic pottery from excavations of St. Peter's and St. Paul's church on the Cathedral Island in Wroclaw [w:] Vratislava Antiqua 17, Wrocław 2012, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;
Vessels were turned on rapidly rotating potters' wheels; the potters used oxidation baked in simple furnaces, with combined firing and heating space. Vessels were fired at a temperature almost 1000&amp;nbsp;°C, getting the Loštice effect required more than 1200&amp;nbsp;°C. The surface tint is light or dark brown-colored.

== Morphology of ceramics ==
The largest number of pottery are mugs with a barrel-shaped body, flat base and various edging. The edging is a period indicative. Very common form is the goblet with blister-surface or made from soft kaolinite clay. Other forms are jugs with a cylindrical or S-shaped neck, bowls with a conical body and flat base, often decorated with red markings, vessels with a conical body and a club-shaped rim, lids, miniature vessels, tiles, pipes and flagsones.
The most far-famed are the so-called "Loštice goblets", categorised in three basic classes. Type I. is slim with a circular rim, group A having flat walls, whilst in group B walls have curvature. Type II. has a wreath handle on the body, group A with a cylindrical neck and group B conical neck. Type III. has a slim body and rim.&lt;ref&gt;Goš V., Loštice. Město středověkých hrnčířů, Opava 2007, p. 56-93, 117-123&lt;/ref&gt;
Ceramics from Loštice were decorated with engravings as parallel grooves or notches, raised forms, above all the so-called "lípané maliny” (made up of the soft clay wheel-shaped ornaments decorated with small nodules like balls) and painting, especially red.

== Goblets with Loštice effect ==
Typical slim goblets with nodules on the surface and a plain rim first appeared at the beginning of 15th century. One of the oldest examples is the goblet discovered at Tovačov, which held silver coins the so-called „groše český” of the Czech kings Charles IV and Waclaw IV. Taking into account the goblet's type and the dates of minting these coins, probably the goblet was made at the turn of the 14th and 15th century. Around the mid 15th century, craftsmen began to produce goblets with a wreath handle, designated type II. Some of the Loštice goblets had been edged with silver. The manufacture of these goblets ceased sometime before 1550, when the handiwork of southern Moravian craftsmen of higher quality forced them out of the marketplace. The example of type II.B is portrayed in the painting of Hieronymus Bosch The Garden of Terrestrial Pleasures from the early 16th century.

== Imitations of Loštice goblets ==
Loštice was not the sole site for production of pottery displaying the Loštice effect. Pottery workshops have been discovered in nearby Mohelnice, Žádlovice, Masnice, Líšnice and Svinova.
Goblets of type II. were very popular thanks to their unusual shape and surface. They have been found in towns and castles of Moravia and Central Europe; their range of occurrence covered the area from Poland to Serbia. Success of the Loštice goblets on the market was an inspiration for potters to devise similar vessels, but these imitations often surpassed the originals in quality. In the area along the Danube river, goblets were produced with sand sprinkled on the surface and with a brown glaze. In Moravia craftsmen placed so-called "lípané maliny” on the goblets. From Budapest there are known goblets in Loštice style, which were made up with a majolica glaze and richly adorned.

A '''Madonna''' ({{IPA-it|maˈdɔnna|lang}}) is a representation of [[Mary, Mother of Jesus|Mary]], either alone or with her [[child Jesus]]. These images are central [[icon]]s for both the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] churches.&lt;ref&gt;Doniger, Wendy, ''[https://books.google.com.vn/books?id=ZP_f9icf2roC&amp;pg=PA696&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Merriam-Webster's encyclopedia of world religions]'', 1999, {{ISBN|0-87779-044-2}} page 696.&lt;/ref&gt; The word is {{ety|it|ma donna|my lady}}. 
The '''Madonna and Child''' type is very prevalent in Christian iconography, divided into many traditional subtypes especially in [[Eastern Orthodox iconography]], often known after the location of a notable icon of the type, such as the ''[[Theotokos of Vladimir]]'', ''[[Agiosoritissa]]'', ''[[Blachernitissa]]'', etc., or descriptive of the depicted posture, as in ''[[Hodegetria]]'', ''[[Eleusa icon|Eleusa]]'', etc.

The term ''Madonna'' in the sense of "picture or statue of the Virgin Mary" enters English usage in the 17th century, primarily in reference to works of the [[Italian Renaissance]]. In an Eastern Orthodox context, such images are typically known as ''[[Theotokos]]''. "Madonna" may be generally used of representations of Mary, with or without the infant Jesus, is the focus and central figure of the image, possibly flanked or surrounded by angels or saints. Other types of Marian imagery have a narrative context, depicting scenes from the ''[[Life of the Virgin]]'', e.g. the ''[[Annunciation to Mary]]'', are not typically called "Madonna".

The earliest depictions of Mary date still to [[Early Christianity]] (2nd to 3rd centuries), found in the [[Catacombs of Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com.vn/books?id=qd7EZAFouDgC&amp;pg=PA191&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q=catacomb&amp;f=false Mary in Western Art]'' by Timothy Verdon, Filippo Rossi 2005 {{ISBN|0-9712981-9-X}} page 11&lt;/ref&gt; These are in a narrative context. The classical "Madonna" or "Theotokos" imagery develops from the 5th century, as [[Marian devotion]] rose to great importance after the [[Council of Ephesus]] formally affirmed her status as "[[Mother of God]] or ''Theotokos'' ("God-bearer") in 431.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Raymond, ''[https://books.google.com.vn/books?id=ez0VRbQi1i4C&amp;pg= Mariology: A Guide for Priests, Deacons, Seminarians, and Consecrated Persons]'' 2008 {{ISBN|1-57918-355-7}} page&lt;/ref&gt; 
The ''Theotokos'' iconography as it developed in the 6th to 8th century rose to great importance in the high medieval period (12th to 14th centuries) both in the Eastern Orthodox and in the Latin spheres. According to a tradition recorded in the 8th century, Marian iconography goes back to a portrait drawn from life by [[Luke the Evangelist]], with a number of icons (such as the ''[[Panagia Portaitissa]]'') claimed to either represent this original icon or to be a direct copy of it.
In the Western tradition, depictions of the Madonna were greatly diversified by Renaissance masters such as [[Duccio]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Raphael]], [[Giovanni Bellini]], [[Caravaggio]] and [[Rubens]] (and further by certain modernists,  such as [[Salvador Dalí]] and [[Henry Moore]]) while Eastern Orthodox iconography adheres more closely to the inherited traditional types.

==Terminology==
{{further information|Theotokos#Terminology}}
{{further information|Titles of Mary|Queen of Heaven}}

Liturgy depicting Mary as powerful intercessor (such as the ''[[Akathist]]'') was brought from Greek into Latin tradition in the 8th century. The Greek title of Δεσποινα (''Despoina'') was adopted as Latin ''Domina'' "Lady". The medieval Italian ''Ma Donna'' {{IPA-it|maˈdɔnna|pron}} ("My Lady") reflects ''Mea Domina'', while ''Nostra Domina'' (δεσποινίς ἡμῶν) was adopted in French, as ''Nostre Dame'' "Our Lady".&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Schneider, ''Virgo Ecclesia Facta'', 2004,  [https://books.google.ch/books?id=RfvSAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA74&amp;lpg=PA74 p. 74].

These names signal both the increased importance of the cult of the virgin and the prominence of art in service to Marian devotion during the late medieval period. During the 13th century, especially,{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} with the increasing influence of chivalry and aristocratic culture on poetry, song and the visual arts, the Madonna is represented as the queen of Heaven, often enthroned. Madonna was meant more to remind people of the theological concept which is placing such a high value on purity or virginity. This is also represented by the color of her clothing. The color blue symbolized purity, virginity, and royalty.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}&lt;!--blue in Mary's dress appears to be *much* older than the 13th century. Cite some references please.--&gt;

While the Italian term ''Madonna'' paralleled English ''Our Lady'' in late medieval Marian devotion, it was imported as an [[Art history|art historical]] term into English usage in the 1640s, designating specifically the Marian art of the [[Italian Renaissance]]. In this sense, "a Madonna", or "a Madonna with Child" is used of specific works of art, historically mostly of Italian works. A "Madonna" may alternatively be called "Virgin" or "Our Lady", but "Madonna" is not typically applied to eastern works; e.g. the ''[[Theotokos of Vladimir]]'' may in English be called "Our Lady of Vladimir", while it is less usual, but not unheard of, to refer to it as the "Madonna of Vladimir".&lt;ref&gt;"Madonna of Vladimir" e.g. in

==Modes of representation==
There are several distinct types of representation of the Madonna.
* One type of Madonna shows Mary alone (without the child Jesus), and standing, generally glorified and with a gesture of prayer, benediction or prophesy. This type of image occurs in a number of ancient apsidal [[mosaic]]s.
* Full-length standing images of the Madonna more frequently include the infant Jesus, who turns towards the viewer or raises his hand in benediction. The most famous Byzantine image, the [[Hodegetria]] was originally of this type, though most copies are at half-length. This type of image occurs frequently in sculpture and may be found in fragile ivory carvings, in limestone on the central door posts of many cathedrals, and in polychrome wooden or plaster casts in almost every Catholic Church. There are a number of famous paintings that depict the Madonna in this manner, notably the [[Sistine Madonna]] by [[Raphael]].
* The ''Madonna enthroned'' is a type of image that dates from the [[Byzantine]] period and was used widely in Medieval and Renaissance times. These representations of the ''Madonna and Child'' often take the form of large altarpieces. They also occur as frescoes and apsidal mosaics. In Medieval examples the Madonna is often accompanied by angels who support the throne, or by rows of saints. In Renaissance painting, particularly High Renaissance painting, the saints may be grouped informally in a type of composition known as a [[Sacra conversazione]].
* The ''[[Madonna of humility]]'' refers to portrayals in which the Madonna is sitting on the ground, or sitting upon a low cushion. She may be holding the Child [[Jesus]] in her lap.&lt;ref&gt;''Renaissance art: a topical dictionary'' by Irene Earls 1987 {{ISBN|0-313-24658-0}} page 174&lt;/ref&gt; This style was a product of [[Order of Saint Francis|Franciscan]] piety,&lt;ref&gt;''A history of ideas and images in Italian art'' by James Hall 1983 {{ISBN|0-06-433317-5}} page 223&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Iconography of Christian Art'' by Gertrud Schiller 1971 ASIN: B0023VMZMA page 112&lt;/ref&gt; and perhaps due to [[Simone Martini]]. It spread quickly through Italy and by 1375 examples began to appear in Spain, France and Germany. It was the most popular among the styles of the early [[Trecento]] artistic period.&lt;ref name=Meiss&gt;''Painting in Florence and Siena after the Black Death'' by Millard Meiss 1979 {{ISBN|0-691-00312-2}} pages 132-133&lt;/ref&gt;
* Half-length Madonnas are the form most frequently taken by painted icons of the Eastern Orthodox Church, where the subject matter is highly formulated so that each painting expresses one particular attribute of the "Mother of God". Half-length paintings of the ''Madonna and Child'' are also common in [[Italian Renaissance painting]], particularly in [[Venice]].
* The seated ''Madonna and Child'' is a style of image that became particularly popular during the 15th century in [[Florence]] and was imitated elsewhere. These representations are usually of a small size suitable for a small altar or domestic use. They usually show Mary holding the infant Jesus in an informal and maternal manner. These paintings often include symbolic reference to the [[Passion of Christ]].
* The ''Adoring Madonna'' is a type popular during the Renaissance. These images, usually small and intended for personal devotion, show Mary kneeling in adoration of the Christ Child. Many such images were produced in glazed terracotta as well as paint.
* The [[nursing Madonna]] refers to portrayals of the Madonna breastfeeding the infant Jesus.

==History==
[[File:Anonymous Madonna with big breasts.jpg|thumb|Painting of the Madonna and Child by an anonymous Italian, first half of [[19th century]]]]
The earliest representation of the Madonna and Child may be the wall painting in the [[Catacombs of Rome|Catacomb of Priscilla]], Rome, in which the seated Madonna suckles the Child, who turns his head to gaze at the spectator.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Lasareff, "Studies in the Iconography of the Virgin" ''The Art Bulletin'' '''20'''.1 (March 1938, pp. 26-65) p 27f.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest consistent representations of Mother and Child were developed in the Eastern Empire, where despite an [[Byzantine iconoclasm|iconoclastic]] strain in culture that rejected physical representations as "[[idolatry|idols]]", respect for venerated images was expressed in the repetition of a narrow range of highly conventionalized types, the repeated images familiar as [[icon]]s ([[Greek language|Greek]] "image"). On a visit to Constantinople in 536, [[Pope Agapetus I|Pope Agapetus]] was accused of being opposed to the veneration of the ''theotokos'' and to the portrayal of her image in churches.&lt;ref&gt;m. Mundell, "Monophysite church decoration" ''Iconoclasm'' (Birmingham) 1977, p 72.&lt;/ref&gt; Eastern examples show the Madonna enthroned, even wearing the closed Byzantine pearl-encrusted crown with pendants, with the Christ Child on her lap.&lt;ref&gt;As in the fresco fragments of the lower [[Basilica di San Clemente]], Rome: see John L. Osborne, "Early Medieval Painting in San Clemente, Rome: The Madonna and Child in the Niche" ''Gesta'' '''20'''.2 (1981), pp. 299-310.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the West, hieratic Byzantine models were closely followed in the Early Middle Ages, but with the increased importance of the cult of the Virgin in the 12th and 13th centuries a wide variety of types developed to satisfy a flood of more intensely personal forms of piety. In the usual Gothic and Renaissance formulas the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] sits with the [[Child Jesus|Infant Jesus]] on her lap, or enfolded in her arms. In earlier representations the Virgin is enthroned, and the Child may be fully aware, raising his hand to offer blessing. In a 15th-century Italian variation, a baby [[John the Baptist]] looks on.

Late Gothic sculptures of the Virgin and Child may show a standing virgin with the child in her arms. [[Iconography]] varies between public images and private images supplied on a smaller scale and meant for personal devotion in the chamber: the Virgin [[Breastfeeding|suckling]] the Child (such as the ''[[Madonna Litta]]'') is an image largely confined to private devotional icons.

===Early images===
[[File:Mary &amp; Child Icon Sinai 6th century.jpg|thumb|[[Icon]] of the enthroned ''Virgin and Child'' with saints and angels, and the [[Hand of God (art)|Hand of God]] above, [[6th century]], [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]], perhaps the earliest iconic image of the subject to survive.]]

There was a great expansion of the [[cult (religion)|cult of Mary]] after the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] in 431, when her status as [[Theotokos]] ("God-bearer") was confirmed; this had been a subject of some controversy until then, though mainly for reasons to do with [[Christology|arguments over the nature of Christ]].  In [[mosaic]]s in [[Santa Maria Maggiore]] in Rome, dating from 432-40, just after the council, she is not yet shown with a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]], and she is also not shown in Nativity scenes at this date, though she is included in the [[Adoration of the Magi]].

By the next century the iconic depiction of the Virgin enthroned carrying the infant Christ was established, as in the example from the only group of icons surviving from this period, at [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] in [[Egypt]]. This type of depiction, with subtly changing differences of emphasis, has remained the mainstay of depictions of Mary to the present day. The image at Mount Sinai succeeds in combining two aspects of Mary described in the [[Magnificat]], her [[humility]] and her [[wikt:exaltation|exaltation]] above other humans, and has the [[Hand of God (art)|Hand of God]] above, up to which the archangels look. An early icon of the Virgin as queen is in the church of [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]] in Rome, datable to 705-707 by the kneeling figure of [[Pope John VII]], a notable promoter of the cult of the Virgin, to whom the infant Christ reaches his hand.  This type was long confined to Rome.  The roughly half-dozen varied icons of the Virgin and Child in Rome from the 6th - 8th century form the majority of the representations surviving from this period; "isolated images of the Madonna and Child ... are so common ... to the present day in Catholic and Orthodox tradition, that it is difficult to recover a sense of the novelty of such images in the early Middle Ages, at least in western Europe".&lt;ref&gt;Nees, Lawrence. ''Early medieval art'', 143-145, quote 144, Oxford University Press, 2002, {{ISBN|0-19-284243-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-19-284243-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At this period the [[iconography]] of the Nativity was taking [[Nativity of Jesus in art#Byzantine image|the form, centred on Mary]], that it has retained up to the present day in [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], and on which Western depictions remained based until the [[High Middle Ages]].  Other narrative scenes for Byzantine cycles on the ''[[Life of the Virgin]]'' were being evolved, relying on [[New Testament apocrypha|apocypha]]l sources to fill in her life before the [[Annunciation to Mary]].  By this time the political and economic collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]] meant that the Western, Latin, church was unable to compete in the development of such sophisticated [[iconography]], and relied heavily on Byzantine developments.

The earliest surviving image in a Western [[illuminated manuscript]] of the [[Madonna and Child]] comes from the [[Book of Kells]] of about 800 (there is a similar carved image on the lid of [[St Cuthbert's coffin]] of 698) and, though magnificently decorated in the style of [[Insular art]], the drawing of the figures can only be described as rather crude compared to Byzantine work of the period.  This was in fact an unusual inclusion in a [[Gospel book]], and images of the Virgin were slow to appear in large numbers in manuscript art until the [[book of hours]] was devised in the 13th century.

The ''[[Madonna of humility]]'' by [[:File:Madonna-of-humility- 1433 Domenico di Bartolo.jpg|Domenico di Bartolo]], 1433, is considered one of the most innovative devotional images from the early [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]].&lt;ref Name =Trinchieri&gt;''Art and music in the early modern period'' by Franca Trinchieri Camiz, Katherine A. McIver {{ISBN|0-7546-0689-9}} page 15 [https://books.google.com/books?id=mdIFQTuA4cQC&amp;pg=PA15]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Byzantine influence on the West===
[[File:Italo-Byzantinischer Maler des 13. Jahrhunderts 001.jpg|thumb|upright|13th century ''Madonna with Child'' in the Italo-Byzantine style.]]

Very few early images of the Virgin Mary survive, though the depiction of the Madonna has roots in ancient pictorial and sculptural traditions that informed the earliest Christian communities throughout Europe, Northern Africa and the Middle East.  Important to Italian tradition are [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] [[icons]], especially those created in [[Constantinople]] (Istanbul), the capital of the longest, enduring [[medieval]] civilization whose icons participated in civic life and were celebrated for their miraculous properties.  Byzantium (324-1453) saw itself as the true [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], if [[Greek language|Greek]]-speaking, Christian empire with colonies of Italians living among its citizens, participating in [[Crusades]] at the borders of its land, and ultimately, plundering its churches, palaces and monasteries of many of its treasures.  Later in the [[Middle Ages]], the [[Cretan school]] was the main source of icons for the West, and the artists there could adapt their style to Western [[iconography]] when required.

While theft is one way that Byzantine images made their way West to Italy, the relationship between Byzantine icons and Italian images of the Madonna is far more rich and complicated.  Byzantine art played a long, critical role in Western Europe, especially when Byzantine territories included parts of Eastern Europe, Greece and much of Italy itself.  Byzantine manuscripts, ivories, gold, silver and [[Byzantine silk|luxurious textiles]] were distributed throughout the West.  In Byzantium, Mary's usual title was the [[Theotokos]] or Mother of God, rather than the Virgin Mary and it was believed that [[salvation]] was delivered to the faithful at the moment of God's [[incarnation]]. That [[theological]] concept takes pictorial form in the image of Mary holding her infant son.

However, what is most relevant to the Byzantine heritage of the Madonna is twofold.  First, the earliest surviving independent images of the Virgin Mary are found in Rome, the center of Christianity in the medieval West.  One is a valued possession of [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]], one of the many Roman churches dedicated to the Virgin Mary.  Another, a splintered, repainted ghost of its former self, is venerated at the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], that great architectural wonder of the Ancient [[Roman Empire]], that was rededicated to Mary as an expression of the Church's triumph.  Both evoke Byzantine tradition in terms of their medium, that is, the technique and materials of the paintings, in that they were originally painted in [[tempera]] (egg yolk and ground pigments) on wooden panels.  In this respect, they share the Ancient Roman heritage of Byzantine icons.  Second, they share [[iconography]], or subject matter.  Each image stresses the maternal role that Mary plays, representing her in relationship to her infant son.  It is difficult to gauge the dates of the cluster of these earlier images, however, they seem to be primarily works of the 7th and 8th centuries.

===Later medieval period===
[[File:Gerard David - The rest on the flight into Egypt (National Gallery of Art).jpg|thumb|288px|''[[Rest on the Flight into Egypt (David, National Gallery of Art)| Rest on The Flight into Egypt]]'', c. 1510,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/Collection/art-object-page.50.html National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C.]&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Gerard David]] depicts a close, intimate moment of tenderness where she only has eyes for the Child.]]

It was not until the revival of monumental [[panel painting]] in Italy during the 12th and 13th centuries, that the image of the Madonna gains prominence outside of Rome, especially throughout [[Tuscany]].  While members of the [[mendicant orders]] of the [[Franciscan]] and [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] Orders are some of the first to commission panels representing this subject matter, such works quickly became popular in monasteries, parish churches, and homes.  Some images of the Madonna were paid for by lay organizations called confraternities, who met to sing praises of the Virgin in chapels found within the newly reconstructed, spacious churches that were sometimes dedicated to her.  Paying for such a work might also be seen as a form of devotion.  Its expense registers in the use of thin sheets of real [[gold leaf]] in all parts of the panel that are not covered with paint, a visual analogue not only to the costly sheaths that medieval [[goldsmith]]s used to decorate altars, but also a means of surrounding the image of the Madonna with illumination from oil lamps and candles.  Even more precious is the bright blue mantle colored with [[lapis lazuli]], a stone imported from Afghanistan.

This is the case of one of the most famous, innovative and monumental works that Duccio executed for the Laudesi at Santa Maria Novella in Florence.  Often the scale of the work indicates a great deal about its original function.  Often referred to as the Rucellia Madonna (c. 1285), the panel painting towers over the spectator, offering a visual focus for members of the Laudesi confraternity to gather before it as they sang praises to the image.  Duccio made an even grander image of the Madonna enthroned for the high altar of the cathedral of Siena, his home town.  Known as the ''Maesta'' (1308–11), the image represents the pair as the center of a densely populated court in the central part of a complexly carpentered work that lifts the court upon a predella (pedestal of altarpiece) of narrative scenes and standing figures of prophets and saints.  In turn, a modestly scaled image of the Madonna as a half-length figure holding her son in a memorably intimate depiction, is to be found in the National Gallery of London.  This is clearly made for the private devotion of a Christian wealthy enough to hire one of the most important Italian artists of his day.
[[File:Don Lorenzo Monaco 013.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Lorenzo Monaco]], [[Florence]], c.1410]]

The privileged owner need not go to Church to say his prayers or plead for salvation; all he or she had to do was open the shutters of the tabernacle in an act of private revelation. Duccio and his contemporaries inherited early pictorial conventions that were maintained, in part, to tie their own works to the authority of tradition.

Despite all of the innovations of painters of the Madonna during the 13th and 14th centuries, Mary can usually be recognized by virtue of her attire.  Customarily when she is represented as a youthful mother of her newborn child, she wears a deeply saturated blue mantle over a red garment.  This mantle typically covers her head, where sometimes, one might see a linen, or later, transparent silk veil.  She holds the Christ Child, or Baby Jesus, who shares her halo as well as her regal bearing.  Often her gaze is directed out at the viewer, serving as an intercessor, or [[Conduit (spiritualism)|conduit]] for prayers that flow from the Christian, to her, and only then, to her son. However, late medieval Italian artists also followed the trends of Byzantine icon painting, developing their own methods of depicting the Madonna. Sometimes, the Madonna's complex bond with her tiny child takes the form of a close, intimate moment of tenderness steeped in sorrow where she only has eyes for him.

While the focus of this entry currently stresses the depiction of the Madonna in panel painting, it should be noted that her image also appears in mural decoration, whether mosaics or fresco painting on the exteriors and interior of sacred buildings.  She is found high above the apse, or east end of the church where the liturgy is celebrated in the West.  She is also found in sculpted form, whether small ivories for private devotion, or large sculptural reliefs and free-standing sculpture.  As a participant in sacred drama, her image inspires one of the most important fresco cycles in all of Italian painting: Giotto's narrative cycle in the Arena Chapel, next to the Scrovegni family's palace in Padua.  This program dates to the first decade of the 14th century.

Italian artists of the 15th century onward are indebted to traditions established in the 13th and 14th centuries in their representation of the Madonna.

===Renaissance===
[[File:15th-century unknown painters - Madonna on a Crescent Moon in Hortus Conclusus - WGA23736.jpg|thumb|180px|The ''Madonna on a Crescent Moon in [[Hortus Conclusus]] '' by an [[anonymity|anonymous]] painter. ]]
[[File:Leonardo da Vinci - study of a woman's head.jpg|thumb|right|[[Leonardo da Vinci]], a study of the Head of [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Madonna]], c.  1484 AD.]]

While the 15th and 16th centuries were a time when Italian painters expanded their repertoire to include historical events, independent portraits and mythological subject matter, Christianity retained a strong hold on their careers.  Most works of art from this era are sacred.  While the range of religious subject matter included subjects from the Old Testament and images of saints whose cults date after the codification of the Bible, the Madonna remained a dominant subject in the iconography of the Renaissance.

Some of the most eminent 16th-century Italian painters to turn to this subject were [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Michelangelo]] and [[Raffaello Santi|Raphael]], [[Giorgione]], [[Giovanni Bellini]] and [[Titian]]. They developed on the foundations of 15th century Marian images by [[Fra Angelico]], [[Fra Filippo Lippi]], [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]] and [[Piero della Francesca]] in particular, among countless others.  The subject was equally popular in [[Early Netherlandish painting]] and that of the rest of Northern Europe.

The subject retaining the greatest power on all of these men remained the maternal bond, even though other subjects, especially the [[Annunciation]], and later the [[Immaculate Conception]], led to a greater number of paintings that represented Mary alone, without her son.  As a commemorative image, the ''[[Pietà]]'' became an important subject, newly freed from its former role in narrative cycles, in part, an outgrowth of popular devotional statues in Northern Europe. Traditionally, Mary is depicted expressing compassion, grief and love, usually in highly charged, emotional works of art even though the most famous, early work by Michelangelo stifles signs of mourning. The tenderness an ordinary mother might feel towards her beloved child is captured, evoking the moment when she first held her infant son [[Christ]].  The spectator, after all, is meant to sympathize, to share in the despair of the mother who holds the body of her crucified son.

===Modern images===
[[File:La Vierge au lys.jpg|thumb|180px|''Virgin of the Lilies'', [[Bouguereau]], 1899]]
In some European countries, such as Germany, Italy and Poland sculptures of the Madonna are found on the outside of city houses and buildings, or along the roads in small enclosures.

In Germany, such a statue placed on the outside of a building is called a ''Hausmadonna''. Some date back to the Middle Ages, while some are still being made today. Usually found on the level of the second floor or higher, and often on the corner of a house, such sculptures were found in great numbers in many cities; [[Mainz]], for instance, was supposed to have had more than 200 of them [[Bombing of Mainz in World War II|before World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

In Italy, the ''roadside Madonna'' is a common sight both on the side of buildings and along roads in small enclosures. These are expected to bring spiritual relief to people who pass them.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Singer, 2004 ''The cultural complex'' {{ISBN|1-58391-913-9}} page 68&lt;/ref&gt; Some Madonnas statues are placed around Italian towns and villages as a matter of protection, or as a commemoration of a reported miracle.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Pearson, 2006 ''Italy from a Backpack'' {{ISBN|0-9743552-4-0}} page 219&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s, the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]] placed statues called the ''[[Madonna of the Trail]]'' from coast to coast, marking the path of the [[old National Road]] and the [[Santa Fe Trail]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM6K5T_Madonna_of_the_Trail_Lamar_Colorado ''Madonna of the Trail'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islamic view==
[[File:Virgin Mary and Jesus (old Persian miniature).jpg|thumb|180px|[[Mary in Islam|Mary]] and [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus]] in a [[Persian miniature]]]]
The first important encounter between [[Islam]] and the image of the [[Mary in Islam|Madonna]] is said to have happened during the [[Prophet Muhammad]]'s [[conquest of Mecca]]. At the culmination of his mission, in 629 CE, Muhammad [[Conquest of Mecca|conquered Mecca]] with a Muslim army, with his first action being the "cleansing" or "purifying" of the [[Kaaba]], wherein he removed all [[pre-Islamic Arabian gods|the pre-Islamic pagan images and idols]] from inside the temple.According to reports collected by [[Ibn Ishaq]] and [[al-Azraqi]], Muhammad did, however, protectively put his hand over a painting of Mary and [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus]], and a fresco of [[Abraham in Islam|Abraham]] in order to keep them from being effaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Life of Muhammad.

Moreover one Christian had been allowed and even encouraged to paint an icon of the Virgin Mary and the child Christ on an inside wall of the Ka'bah, where it sharply contrasted with all the other paintings. But [[Quraysh]] were more or less insensitive to this contrast: for them it was simply a question of increasing the multitude of idols by another two; and it was partly their tolerance that made them so impenetrable .... Apart from the icon of the Virgin Mary and the child Jesus, and a painting of an old man, said to be [[Abraham]], the walls inside had been covered with pictures of [[pagan]] [[deities]]. Placing his hand protectively over the icon, the Prophet told [[Uthman]] to see that all the other paintings, except that of Abraham, were effaced."&lt;ref&gt;Martin Lings, ''Muhammad: His Life Based on the Earliest Source'' (Rochester: Inner Traditions, 1987), pp. 17, 300.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable types and individual works==
[[File:Czestochowska.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Black Madonna of Częstochowa]], Poland.]] 
There are a large number of articles on individual works of various sorts in [[:Category:Virgin Mary in art]] and its sub-category.  See also the incomplete [[List of depictions of the Virgin and Child]]. The term "Madonna" is sometimes used to refer to representations of Mary that were not created by Italians. A small selection of examples include:
*''[[Golden Madonna of Essen]]'', the earliest large-scale sculptural example in Western Europe and a precedent for the polychrome wooden processional sculptures of Romanesque France, a type known as Throne of Wisdom.
*''[[Madonna of humility]]'' depicting a Madonna sitting on the ground, or low cushions
*''[[Madonna and Child (Duccio)|Madonna and Child]]'', a painting by Duccio di Buoninsegna, from around the year 1300.
*''[[The Black Madonna of Częstochowa]]'' (''Czarna Madonna'' or ''Matka Boska Częstochowska'' in Polish) icon, which was, according to legend, painted by St. Luke the Evangelist on a cypress table top from the house of the Holy Family.
*''[[The Benois Madonna|Madonna and Child with Flowers]]'', possibly one of two works begun by the artist.
*''[[Madonna Eleusa]]'' (of tenderness) has been depicted both in the Eastern and Western churches.
*''[[Madonna of the Steps]]'', a relief by Michelangelo.
*''[[Madonna della seggiola]]'', by [[Raphael]]
*''[[Madonna with the Long Neck]]'', by [[Parmigianino]].
*''[[The Madonna of Port Lligat]]'', the name of two paintings by Salvador [[Dalí]] created in 1949 and 1950.

The '''Minab River''' is a [[river]] in [[Sistan and Baluchestan Province|Sistan and Baluchestan]], [[Iran]], near [[Minab|Harmosia]].

This river is formed by adjoining of two smaller rivers, the Roudan and Joqeen. These two 
rivers meet near the village of [[Borjegan, Iran|Borjegan]], 25&amp;nbsp;km south east of [[Minab|Minab city]] and  the river empties into the [[Strait of Hormuz]] at [[Sirik, Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;Naval Intelligence Division, Iraq &amp; The Persian Gulf (Routledge, 2014) [https://books.google.com/books?id=o1NsBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA164&amp;lpg=PA164&amp;dq=Minab+River&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=c8xkloJeKa&amp;sig=kLbgjvo2S8hPW4mh4X7SPF7aP5s&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CvdCVI_GA6atmAWV44HoAw&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Minab%20River&amp;f=false  page 164].&lt;/ref&gt; Here there is a flourishing [[Mangrove]] ecosystem.&lt;ref name="Bird2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bird|first=Eric|title=Encyclopedia of the World's Coastal Landforms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mfo5TPb7SDsC&amp;pg=PA1052|date=8 April 2010|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-8638-0|page=1052}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alongi2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Alongi|first=Daniel M.|title=The Energetics of Mangrove Forests|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tHM54IKQSv4C&amp;pg=PA199|date=18 January 2009|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-4271-3|page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''mixed language''' is a language that arises among a bilingual group, typically very abruptly, combining aspects of two or more languages but not clearly deriving primarily from any single language.&lt;ref name="Matras 2008"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Mixed Language Debate: Theoretical and Empirical Advances | year=2008 | editor=Matras, Yaron; Bakker, Peter | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H_8rdQ8yLzIC | page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; It differs from a [[creole language|creole]] or [[pidgin|pidgin language]] in that, whereas creoles/pidgins arise from populations trying to imitate a language where they have no fluency, a mixed language arises in a population that is fluent in both of the source languages. A mixed language, by definition, therefore belongs to more than one [[language family]].

Because all languages show some degree of mixing&lt;ref&gt;Zuckermann (2009) p. 48, citing Hjelmslev (1938) and Schuchardt (1884).&lt;/ref&gt; by virtue of containing [[loanwords]], it is a matter of controversy whether the concept of a mixed language can meaningfully be distinguished from the contact phenomena of certain languages from the type of contact and borrowing seen in all languages.&lt;ref name="arends-1994"&gt;Arends et al. 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://languagecontact.humanities.manchester.ac.uk/YM/downloads/Matras,%20Y.%20(2000)%20Mixed%20languages%20a%20functional-communicative%20approach.pdf | title=Mixed languages: a functional–communicative approach | author=Yaron Matras | journal=Bilingualism: Language and Cognition | year=2000 | volume=3 | issue=2 | pages=79–99 | publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars debate to what extent language mixture can be distinguished from other mechanisms such as [[code-switching]], [[Substratum|substrata]], or [[lexical borrowing]].&lt;ref&gt;According to Google n-gram, the German term {{lang|de|Mischsprache}} is first attested in 1832, and attested in English since 1909.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
Other terms used in [[linguistics]] for the concept of a mixed language include ''hybrid language'', ''contact language'', and ''fusion language''; in older usage, 'jargon' was sometimes used in this sense.&lt;ref&gt;"jargon, n.1." OED Online. Oxford University Press, March 2015. Web. 4 May 2015, sense 5.&lt;/ref&gt; In some linguists' usage, [[Creole language|creoles]] and [[pidgin]]s are types of mixed languages, whereas in others' usage, creoles and pidgins are merely among the kinds of language that might become full-fledged mixed languages.

Thomason (1995) classifies mixed languages into two categories. Category 1 languages exhibit "heavy influence from the dominant group's language in all aspects of structure and grammar as well as lexicon" (Winford 171). Category 2 languages show a "categorial specificity of the structural borrowing" or a uniform borrowing of specific categories (Winford).{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Mixed language and intertwined language are seemingly interchangeable terms for some researchers. Some use the term "intertwining" instead of "mixing" because the former implies "mixture of two systems which are not necessarily the same order" nor does it suggest "replacement of the either the lexicon or of the grammatical system", unlike [[relexification]], massive grammatical replacement, and re-[[grammaticalization]]. The grammar of a mixed language typically comes from a language well known to first-generation speakers, which Arends claims is the language spoken by the mother. This is because of the close relationship between mother and child and the likelihood that the language is spoken by the community at large.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Arends et al. classify an intertwined language as a language that "has lexical morphemes from one language and grammatical morphemes from another". This definition does not include Michif, which combines French lexical items in specific contexts, but still utilizes Cree lexical and grammatical items.&lt;ref name="arends-1994"/&gt;

Yaron Matras distinguishes between three types of models for mixed language: "language maintenance and [[language shift]], unique and predetermined processes ("intertwining"), and conventionalisation of language mixing patterns". The first model involves the use of one language for heavy substitutions of entire grammatical paradigms or morphology of another language. This is because a speech community will not adopt a newer dominant language, and so adapt their language with grammatical material from the dominant language. Bakker (1997) argues that mixed languages result from mixed populations. Languages "intertwine", in that the morphosyntax (provided by female native speakers) mixes with the lexicon of another language (spoken by men, often in a colonialist context). This appears to have been the case with Michif, where European men and Cree, Nakota, and Ojibwe women had offspring who learned a mixture of French and Cree. The third model "assumes a gradual loss of the conversational function of language alternation as a means of expressing contrast". In other words, language no longer becomes a means of differentiation between two speech communities as a result of language mixing.&lt;ref name="journals.cambridge.org"&gt;Matras, Yaron, [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=57778&amp;jid=BIL&amp;volumeId=3&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=57777&amp;bodyId=&amp;membershipNumber=&amp;societyETOCSession= "Mixed Languages: a functional-communicative approach"], "Bilingualism: Language and Cognition / Volume 3 / Issue 2 / August 2000 / p. 79 - 99&lt;/ref&gt;

Lexical reorientation, according to Matras, is defined as "the conscious shifting of the linguistic field that is responsible for encoding meaning or conceptual representations away from the language in which linguistic interaction is normally managed, organised, and processed: speakers adopt in a sense one linguistic system to express lexical meaning (or symbols, in the Buhlerian sense of the term) and another to organize the relations among lexical symbols, as well as within sentences, utterances, and interaction. The result is a split, by source language, between lexicon and grammar."&lt;ref name="journals.cambridge.org"/&gt;

==Differentiation with other language mixtures==

A mixed language differs from [[pidgin]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, [[Creole language|creole]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and [[code-switching]] in very fundamental ways. In most cases, mixed language speakers are fluent, even native, speakers of both languages; however, speakers of Michif (a N-V mixed language) are unique in that many are not fluent in both of the sources languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1075/cll.48|title=Pidgins, Creoles and Mixed Languages|last=Velupillai|first=Viveka|date=2015-03-24|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|isbn=9789027252715|series=Creole Language Library|location=Amsterdam}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pidgins, on the other hand, develop in a situation, usually in the context of trade, where speakers of two (or more) different languages come into contact and need to find some way to communicate with each other. Creoles develop when a pidgin language becomes a first language for young speakers. While creoles tend to have drastically simplified [[morphology (linguistics)|morphologies]], mixed languages often retain the inflectional complexities of one, or both, of parent languages. For instance, Michif retains the complexities of its French nouns and its Cree verbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/942975077|title=Pidgins, Creoles and Mixed Languages|last=Viveka.|first=Velupillai,|date=2015|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|oclc=942975077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also differs from a language that has undergone heavy borrowing, such as Korean, Japanese, and Vietnamese from Chinese (see [[Sino-Xenic]]), English from French, or [[Maltese language|Maltese]] from Sicilian/Italian. In these cases, despite the heavy borrowing, the grammar and basic words of the borrowing language remain relatively unchanged, with the borrowed words confined mainly to more abstract or foreign concepts. In the case of Maltese, for example, if verbs borrowed from Italian were inflected using Italian inflectional rules rather than Arabic-derived ones, then Maltese would be a candidate for being a mixed language.

Finally, a mixed language differs from [[code-switching]], such as [[Spanglish]] or [[Portuñol]], in that, once it has developed, the fusion of the source languages is fixed in the grammar and vocabulary, and speakers do not need to know the source languages in order to speak it. But, linguists believe that mixed languages evolve from persistent code-switching, with younger generations picking up the code-switching, but not necessarily the source languages that generated it.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Most [[Portmanteau word|portmanteau]] language names, such as [[Franglais]] and [[Angloromany language|Anglo-Romani]], are not mixed languages, or even examples of code-switching, but [[Register (sociolinguistics)|registers]] of a language (here [[French language|French]] and [[English language|English]]), characterized by large numbers of [[loanword]]s from a second language (here [[English language|English]] and [[Romani language|Romani]]). [[Middle English]]  (the immediate fore-runner of Modern English) developed from such a situation, incorporating many [[Norman language|Norman]] borrowings into [[Old English]], but it is not considered a mixed language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Middle English Chapter 5. |url=https://www.csun.edu/~sk36711/WWW/engl400/me1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed examples==

===Michif===
{{See also|Michif}}

Michif derives nouns, numerals, definite/indefinite articles, possessive pronouns, some adverbs and adjectives from [[French language|French]], while it derives demonstratives (in/animate), question words, verbs (in/animacy agreement with the subject/object), and some adverbs/verb-like adjectives from [[Cree language|Cree]].&lt;ref name="arends-1994"/&gt; The Cree components of Michif generally remain grammatically intact, while the French lexicon and grammar is restricted to noun phrases where nouns occur with a French possessive element or article (i.e. in/definite, masculine/feminine, singular/plural).&lt;ref name="silva-corvalan-1997"&gt;Silva-Corvalán 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thomason-1997"&gt;Thomason 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Further, many speakers of Michif are able to identify the French and Cree components of a given sentence, likely from the phonological and morphological features of words. Although the phonological systems of both French and Cree are generally independent in Michif, there is convergence in 1) mid-vowel raising, 2) sibilant harmony, 3) vowel length (e.g. French vowel pairs [i]/[ɪ] and [a]/[ɑ] differ in length as in Cree), and 4) instances where the three nasal vowels /æ̃/, /ũ/, and /ĩ/ occur in the Cree components, although this last point of convergence may be due to Ojibwe influence.&lt;ref name="thomason-1997"/&gt; Scholars propose that, in the [[Métis]] multilingual community, Michif emerged as a need to symbolize a new social identity.&lt;ref name="silva-corvalan-1997"/&gt; The first unambiguous mention of Michif dates to the 1930s.&lt;ref name="thomason-1997"/&gt;

The Métis of St. Laurent, a tribe of indigenous people in Canada, were made to feel their language was a sign of inferiority by nuns, priests, and other missionaries who insisted that the Metis switch to Standard Canadian French. Because missionaries stigmatized Michif French as an inferior, "bastardized" form of Canadian French, the Metis began to develop a sense of inferiority and shame which they associated with speaking Michif. Although Michif may have arisen as a way for Metis people to identify themselves, it became taboo to speak Michif inter-ethnically.&lt;ref name=GL &gt;Lavalle, Guy http://iportal.usask.ca/docs/Native_studies_review/v7/issue1/pp81-93.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt to make students unlearn Michif French, some nuns used a "token-system" in which each student was given ten tokens each week, and for every use of Michif French, a student would have to surrender a token. Students with the most tokens were rewarded with a prize. Overall, this system did not work.&lt;ref name=GL /&gt;

===Mednyj Aleut===
{{See also|Mednyj Aleut}}

Mednyj Aleut is identified as a mixed language composed of mostly intact systematic components from two typologically and genetically unrelated languages: [[Aleut language|Aleut]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]. This mixed language's grammar and lexicon are both largely Aleut in origin, while the finite verb morphology, a whole grammatical subsystem, is primarily of Russian origin. Nonetheless, there are some syntactic patterns with Russian influence and some Aleut features in the finite verb complex such as, 1) a topic-number agreement pattern, 2) Aleut pronouns with unaccusatives, 3) the Aleut agglutinative tense + number + person/number pattern in one of two alternative past-tense forms. Scholars hypothesize that due to the elaborate Russian and Aleut components of Mednyj Aleut, the Aleut/Russian creoles in which the mixed language arose must have been fluent bilinguals of Aleut and Russian and, therefore, not a pidgin language—that is, "imperfect learning" is usually a feature in the emergence of a pidgin. Furthermore, some code-switching and deliberate decisions likely served as mechanisms for the development of Mednyj Aleut and it is possible that these were motivated by a need for a language that reflected the community's new group identity.&lt;ref name="thomason-1997"/&gt;

===Ma'a===
{{See also|Mbugu}}
Ma’a has a [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]] basic vocabulary and a primarily [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] grammatical structure. The language also shares some phonological units with languages in the Cushitic phylum (e.g. the voiceless lateral fricative, the voiceless glottal stop, and the voiceless velar fricative that do not occur in Bantu), as well as syntactic structures, derivational processes, and a feature of inflectional morphology. However, few productive non-lexical structures in Ma’a appear derived from Cushitic. [[Sarah Thomason|Sarah G. Thomason]] therefore argues for a classification of Ma’a as a mixed language since it does not have enough Cushitic grammar to be genetically related to the Cushitic language. By contrast, Ma’a has a productive set of inflectional structures derived from Bantu. Ma’a also demonstrates phonological structures derived from Bantu—for instance, the prenasalized voiced stops /mb ⁿd ⁿɟ ŋg/, phonemic tones, the absence of pharyngeal fricatives, labialized dorsal stops, ejective and retroflex stops, and final consonants— as well as noun classification, number category, and verb morphology patterns of Bantu. Syntactic and derivational patterns in Ma’a vary between Cushitic and Bantu origins—some Ma’a constructions used, such as genitive and copula constructions, are both from Cushitic and Bantu. These observations, in view of additional [[language contact]] cases like Asia Minor Greek, Anglo-Romani, and Mednyj Aleut, suggest that Ma'a arose as a product of massive interference from a Bantu language via intense cultural pressure on a Cushitic-speaking community.&lt;ref&gt;Thomason, Sarah Grey. GENETIC RELATIONSHIP AND THE CASE OF MA'A (MBUGU), Studies in African Linguistics. 14.2. University of Pittsburgh, 1983. Web. http://elanguage.net/journals/sal/article/view/1138/1154.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media Lengua===
{{Main article|Media Lengua}}

Media Lengua, also known as ''Chaupi-shimi'', ''Chaupi-lengua'', ''Chaupi-Quichua'', ''Quichuañol'', ''Chapu-shimi'' or ''llanga-shimi'',&lt;ref group=nb&gt;''Llanga-shimi'' is typically a derogatory term used by speakers of Quichua to describe their language. However, it also appears to describe Media Lengua in the Imbabura Communities. It is believed that the term was introduced by [[Mestizo]] school teachers to further discredit the indigenous populations&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pallares"&gt;Pallares, A. (2002). From peasant struggles to Indian resistance: the Ecuadorian Andes in the late twentieth century. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press.&lt;/ref&gt; (roughly translated to "''half language''" or "''in-between language''") is a mixed language that consists of Spanish [[vocabulary]] and [[Ecuador]]ian [[Quichua language|Quichua]] grammar, most conspicuously in its [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]. In terms of vocabulary, almost all [[lexeme]]s (89%&lt;ref name="Stewart"&gt;Stewart, Jesse (2011). [http://mspace.lib.umanitoba.ca/bitstream/1993/4882/1/Stewart_Jesse.pdf ''A Brief Descriptive Grammar of Pijal Media Lengua and an Acoustic Vowel Space Analysis of Pijal Media Lengua and Imbabura Quichua.'']. (thesis)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Muysken1997"&gt;Muysken, Pieter (1997). "Media Lengua", in Thomason, Sarah G. ''Contact languages: a wider perspective'' Amsterdam: John Benjamins (pp. 365-426)&lt;/ref&gt;), including [[Swadesh list|core vocabulary]], are of Spanish origin and appear to conform to Quichua [[phonotactics]]. Media Lengua is one of the few widely acknowledged examples of a "bilingual mixed language" in both the conventional and narrow [[Linguistics|linguistic]] sense because of its split between roots and suffixes.&lt;ref name="Backus"&gt;Backus, Ad. 2003. Can a mixed language be conventionalised alternational codeswitching? in Matras &amp; Bakker (eds) The Mixed Language Debate: theoretical and empirical advances Mouton de Gruyter Berlin: 237-/270.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McConvell and Meakins"&gt;McConvell, Patrick, and Felicity Meakins. 2005. Gurindji Kriol: A Mixed Language Emerges from Code-switching. Quatro Fonologias Quechuas, 25(1), 9-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Such extreme and systematic borrowing is only rarely attested, and Media Lengua is not typically described as a variety of either Quichua or Spanish. Arends et al. list two languages subsumed under the name ''Media Lengua'': Salcedo Media Lengua and Media Lengua of Saraguro.&lt;ref name="arends-1994"/&gt; The northern variety of Media Lengua, found in the province of [[Imbabura Province|Imbabura]], is commonly referred to as Imbabura Media Lengua&lt;ref name="Gómez-Rendón2008"&gt;Gómez-Rendón, J. A. (2008). Mestizaje lingüístico en los Andes: génesis y estructura de una lengua mixta (1era. ed.). Quito, Ecuador: Abya-Yala.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gómez-Rendón"&gt;Gómez-Rendón, J. (2005). La Media Lengua de Imbabura. Encuentros conflictos bilingüismo contacto de lenguas en el mundo andino (pp. 39-58). Madrid: Iberoamericana.&lt;/ref&gt; and more specifically, the dialect varieties within the province are known as Pijal Media Lengua and Anglas Media Lengua.&lt;ref name="Stewart"/&gt;

Scholars indicate that Media Lengua arose largely via relexification mechanisms.&lt;ref name="matras-bakker-2003"&gt;Matras &amp; Bakker 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Pieter Muysken suggests that the social context in which the language emerged as an intralanguage involved a presence of "acculturated Indians" that neither identified with traditional, rural Quechua nor with urban Spanish cultures. This is an instance of a language developing from a need for "ethnic self-identification".&lt;ref name="thomason-1997"/&gt;

===Light Warlpiri===
{{See also|Light Warlpiri}}

Light Warlpiri, seen as a form of Warlpiri by speakers, derives verbs and verbal morphology largely from [[Australia]]n [[Australian Kriol language|Kriol]], while nouns are largely from [[Warlpiri language|Warlpiri]] and English and nominal morphology from Warlpiri. Light Warlpiri likely developed as an intralanguage via [[code-mixing]] between Warlpiri and either Kriol or English. This code-mixing conventionalized into Light Warlpiri, which is now learned by Lajamanu children as a first language, along with Warlpiri, although Light Warlpiri is often produced first and used in daily interactions with younger speakers and adults within the [[Lajamanu]] community. Light Warlpiri is considered a new language for several reasons: 1) Light Warlpiri speakers use an auxiliary verb-system of that older Warlpiri speakers do not while code-mixing, 2) elements are distributed differently in Light Warlpiri than in code-mixing varieties of older Warlpiri speakers, 3) Light Warlpiri is a native language, which indicates stability of the language, and 4) grammatical structures and lexical items from each source language occur consistently in Light Warlpiri.&lt;ref&gt;O'Shannessy 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gurindji Kriol===
{{Main article|Gurindji Kriol language}}

Gurindji Kriol exhibits a structural split between the noun phrase and verb phrase, with Gurindji contributing the noun structure including case-marking, and the verb structure including TAM ([[tense-aspect-mood]]) auxiliaries coming from Kriol. In this respect, Gurindji Kriol is classified as a verb-noun (V-N) mixed language. Other examples of V-N mixed languages include [[Michif]] and [[Light Warlpiri]]. The maintenance of Gurindji within the mixed language can be seen as the perpetuation of Aboriginal identity under massive and continuing cultural incursion.

===Asia Minor Greek and Cypriot Arabic===
{{See also|Cappadocian Greek|Languages of Cyprus}}

Both [[Cappadocian Greek]] and [[Cypriot Arabic|Cypriot Maronite-Arabic]] are cases of extreme borrowing—the former from [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and the latter from [[Greek language|Greek]]. The remaining Greek dialects of Asia Minor display borrowing of vocabulary, function words, derivational morphology, and some borrowed nominal and verbal inflectional morphology from Turkish. Cypriot Arabic largely shows borrowing of vocabulary, and consequently Greek morphosyntax.&lt;ref name="matras-bakker-2003"/&gt; These cases, including Ma'a, differ socially from Michif and Mednyj Aleut because they have evolved out of intense language contact, extensive bilingualism, and a strong pressure for speakers to shift to the dominant language. Nonetheless, neither language has an entire grammar and lexicon that is derived from a single historical source and in each case the linguistic group achieves fluent bilingualism. The social context in which they arose largely distinguishes them from pidgins and creoles and, for some scholars, identifies them closely with mixed languages.&lt;ref name="thomason-kaufman-1988"/&gt;

===Kaqchikel-K'iche' Mayan language===
{{main|Cauque Mayan language}}
The Kaqchikel-K'iche' Mixed Language, also known as the Cauqué Mixed Language or Cauqué Mayan, is spoken in the aldea of Santa María Cauqué, Santiago Sacatepéquez, Department of Sacatepéquez in Guatemala. A 1998 study by the Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL) estimated speaker population at 2,000.&lt;ref name="ethnologue.com"&gt;"Kaqchikel-K'iche' Mixed Language." Lewis, M. Paul, Gary F. Simons, and Charles D. Fennig (eds.). 2016. Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Nineteenth edition. Dallas, Texas: SIL International. Web. https://www.ethnologue.com/language/ckz.&lt;/ref&gt; While the language's grammatical base is from K'iche', its lexicon is supplied by Kaqchikel.

===Other possible mixed languages===
*[[Para-Romani languages]] such as [[Erromintxela language|Erromintxela]], which derives most of its lexicon from [[Kalderash Romani]] but uses [[Basque language|Basque]] grammar and syntax.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

==Controversy==
In 1861, [[Max Müller]] denied "the possibility of a mixed language".&lt;ref&gt;''Lectures on the Science of Language'', 1st series, 6th edition, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; In 1881, William D. Whitney wrote the following, expressing skepticism regarding the chances of a language being proven a mixed language. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Such a thing as the adoption on the part of one tongue, by a direct process, of any part or parts of the formal structure of another tongue has, so fas as is known, not come under the notice of linguistic students during the recorded periods of language-history. So far as these are concerned, it appears to be everywhere the case that when the speakers of two languages, A and B, are brought together into one community, there takes place no amalgamation of their speech, into AB; but for a time the two maintain their own several identity, only as modified each by the admission of material from the other in accordance with the ordinary laws of mixture; we may call them A&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt; and B&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;, and not AB. … [W]e shall doubtless meet now and then with the claim that such and such a case presents peculiar conditions which separate it from the general class, and that some remote and difficult problem in language-history is to be solved by admitting promiscuous mixture. Any one advancing such a claim, however, does it at his peril; the burden of proof is upon him to show what the peculiar coditions might have been, and how they should have acted to produce the exceptional result; he will be challenged to bring forward some hisotircally authenticated case of analogous results; and his solution, if not rejected altogether, will be looked upon with doubt and misgiving until he shall have complied with these reasonable requirements. &lt;ref&gt;''On mixture in language'' (Transactions of the American Philological Association, 1881, reprinted in Whitney on Language. Cambridge, MA, The MIT Press, pp. 179-180)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Wilhelm Schmidt (linguist)|Wilhelm Schmidt]] was an important proponent of the idea of mixed languages in the very late 19th and early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;van Driem, George, 2001, ''Languages of the Himalayas.''Vol I, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; In the judgement of [[Thomas Sebeok]], Schmidt produced "not a scrap of evidence" for his theory.&lt;ref&gt;Seboek, Thomas, 1942, "An examination of the Austroasiatic language family", ''Language'' 18.3, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; [[Margaret Schlauch]] provides a summary of the various objections to Schmidt's theory of ''Sprachmischung'',&lt;ref&gt;Schlauch, Margaret. 1936. "The Social Basis of Linguistics". ''Science and Society: A Marxian quarterly'' 1.1: 8-44, esp. pp. 36-37.&lt;/ref&gt; by prominent linguistics such as [[Alfredo Trombetti]], [[Antoine Meillet]], and A. Kholodovich. 

Despite the old and broad consensus that rejected the idea of a 'mixed language', Thomason and Kaufman in 1988 proposed to revive the idea that some languages had shared genealogy.&lt;ref name="thomason-kaufman-1988"&gt;Thomason &amp; Kaufman 1988&lt;/ref&gt; [[Felicity Meakins|Meakins]],&lt;ref name="meakins-2013"&gt;Meakins 2013&lt;/ref&gt; who finds Thomason and Kaufman's account credible,  suggests that a mixed language results from the fusion of usually two source languages, normally in situations of thorough [[bilingualism]], so that it is not possible to classify the resulting language as belonging to either of the [[language families]] that were its sources. 

Despite these recent efforts to rehabilitate mixed languages as an idea, many linguists remained unconvinced. For example, van Driem rejects one by one each of Thomason and Kaufman's examples as well as those more recently proposed.&lt;ref&gt;van Driem, George, 2001, ''Languages of the Himalayas.''Vol I, p. 163-175.&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently, Versteegh rejects the notion of a mixed language, writing that at "no point is it necessary to posit a category of mixed languages."&lt;ref&gt;Versteegh, Kees (2017). The myth of the mixed languages. Saade, Benjamin and Tosco, Mauro, eds. Advances in Maltese Linguistics, pp. 245–266. Berlin, De Gruyter. DOI (Chapter): https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110565744-011

'''Nabil Kanso''' (born 1946) is an [[United States|American]] [[Painting|painter]]. Kanso began his career in New York. 
His works deal with contemporary, historical and literary themes, and are marked by figurative imagery executed with spontaneous and vigorous handling of the paint and often done on large-scale formats. They reflect movement and tension embodying intense colors and [[symbolist|symbolic]] forms addressing social, political, and war issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nabilkanso.com/texts.html Articles in]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Vietnam War]] and the [[Lebanese Civil War]] have profoundly affected the development and scope of his themes dealing with violence and war. His long-running ''[[The Split of Life|Split of Life]]'' series encompasses an extensive range of enormous paintings depicting scenes of human brutality and suffering.&lt;ref&gt;Nabil Kanso: ''The Split of Life: Paintings 1974-1994'', NEV Editions, Atlanta, GA, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and work==
Nabil Kanso grew up in a house adorned with Italian and Oriental art.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}} In 1961, he went to [[England]], and attended the [[London Polytechnic]] studying [[mathematics]] and [[science]].{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}

In 1966, Kanso moved to [[New York City|New York]], and enrolled at [[New York University]] where he received [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] and [[Master of Arts|MA]] in [[art history]], [[philosophy]] and [[political science]].{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}} 1968, he committed himself to painting, acquired a studio in [[Manhattan]], and embarked on developing his ideas and method of painting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nabilkanso.com/biography.html ''Nabil Kanso: Biography'']&lt;/ref&gt;
Kanso was part of the [[Postmodernism|post-modernist movement]], which enveloped [[Postmodern music#The postmodernist musical attitude|music]], [[Postmodern art|fine art]], [[Postmodern film|film]], and [[Postmodern literature|writing]]. Characteristics of this style is stressing "communication" from artist to audience, and [[Modernism#Rejection and detournement of tradition|throwing out the traditional narrative the "life has meaning".]] That Creed of [[Modernism]] fell apart after skepticism in mankind's inherent goodness came about after the Holocaust.&lt;ref&gt;''What Is Post-Modernist Art?'' Postmodernist Art: Definition, Characteristics, History of Postmodernism Movements, Contemporary Installation/Video Art: 	Turner Prize. Encyclopedia of Art Education. Web. 13 Apr. 2012. [http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/postmodernism.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970–1979===
In 1971, Kanso held his first one-man show at the 76th Street Gallery exhibiting 80 paintings that included portraits and nudes in compositions reflecting in varying degrees [[expressionist]], [[romanticist]] and [[symbolism (arts)|symbolist]] influences.&lt;ref&gt;Art Gallery: ''Eye on New York: Kanso's Show at 76th Street'', January 1972&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Gordon: ''Kanso at 76th Street'', [[Arts Magazine]], New York, February 1972&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1971 and 1973 he held a series of solo shows that included the Wanderer, Danse Macabre, Birds of Prey, [[Place des Martyres (paintings)|Place des Martyres]], and Expressions.&lt;ref&gt;Bowles, Jerry: ''Kanso's Paintings'' [[Artnews]], New York, July 1972&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Gordon: ''Kanso's Expressions'', [[Arts Magazine]], New York, February 1973&lt;/ref&gt; Although the exhibitions drew attention and reviews, the lack of sufficient subsistence forced the closing of his studio whose contents including over 700 works &lt;ref&gt;Kanso, Nabil. ''Navil Kanso, Nabil Kanso Artworks, Kanso's Art, Kanso's Paintings and Works on Paper.'' Nabil Kanso, 1996-2009. Web. 12 Apr. 2012&lt;/ref&gt; were placed in storage, and, eventually, lost or destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;''The Split of Life'', pp.11-12&lt;/ref&gt;
Between 1974 and 1979, Kanso took studios in different locations in [[the Carolinas]], [[Atlanta]], and [[New Orleans]] producing a large number of paintings. Among the works of this period are the series [[Vietnam (Kanso)|Vietnam]] (1974), [[The Vortices of Wrath (Lebanon 1977)|Lebanon]], which he began in 1975, at the outbreak of the [[Lebanese Civil War]], [[Hiroshima Nagasaki One-Minute|One-Minute]] (1978–79) on [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]], the [[Jazz (Kanso series)|Jazz]] suite (1978–79) on [[jazz music]], and [[Faust (paintings)|Faust]] (1976–79) comprising over 100 paintings on [[Goethe]]'s [[Faust|drama]].&lt;ref&gt;Nabil Kanso: ''Faust: Paintings 1976-1979'', NEV Editions, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980–2007===
In 1980, Kanso established a studio in Atlanta and held several exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, Catherine: ''Artist inspired by War-torn Homeland'', [[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]], July 8, 1984, pp. H1–2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fox, Catherine: ''Fantastic Visions'', [[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]], September 19, 1985, p. H2&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, he went to [[Venezuela]] where his works were shown in [[Maracaibo]] (1985), [[Caracas]] (1987), and [[Mérida, Mérida|Mérida]] (1987–88). The exhibitions were an invaluable stimulant in initiating the Journey of Art for Peace through which his works were shown under the auspices of art museums, cultural institutions, and peace centers in extensive solo exhibitions that traveled internationally and particularly in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apocalipsis.us/articulos.html Spanish articles in]&lt;/ref&gt; Kanso displays his works by covering the entire walls of the exhibition space with his paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Kanso calls them "the moving murals", ''The Split of Life'', p.11&lt;/ref&gt; The installation surrounding the viewer aims to convey the intensity between the reality of the subject matter and the actuality of painting, and reflect the artist's engagement with the canvases whose contents represent his visual life and relationship to conflicting Eastern and Western cultures and traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Kurlansky, Gail: ''Nabil Kanso's Split of Life Paintings: Looking for the Poet: Power, Death, and Sexuality'', [[Art Papers]], November/December 1986, pp.23–26 [http://splitoflife.com/1.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the works of this period are the series [[Time Suspended in Space (South Africa)|South Africa]] (1980), [[Apocalyptic Rider]]s (1980), [[Dreamvision (paintings)|DreamVision]] (1980–81), [[Lebanon (painting)|Lebanon]] (1982–83), [[Apocalypse Series (Kanso)|Apocalypse]] (1984), [[The Split of Life|Warring Wings]] (1984–85), [[Othello (paintings)|Othello]] (1985), the [[Cluster Paintings]] (1986–88), [[Leaves from the Theatre of War]] (1980s), [[Dance of Salome (paintings)|The Dance of Salome]] (1988), [[America 500 Years]] (1989–91), [[Kuwait (Kanso series)|Kuwait]] 1990–91, [[Living Memory (paintings)|Living Memory]] (1993–94), Bosnia (1995–96), Portraits (1997–99), Iraq (2004–06).

===Lebanese Civil War and Kanso===
In 1958, Nabil Kanso had to stop going to school in Lebanon due to the civil war. In his biography, he talks about how he spent much of his time at the houses of friends and families doing sketches and painting to pass the day. The Lebanese Civil War gave a lot for young Kanso to paint about.&lt;ref&gt;Erminy, Peran, ''The Apocalyptic Paintings of Nabil Kanso'', [[El Nacional (Caracas)|El Nacional]], p.2, April 26, 1987, Caracas [http://nabilkanso.org/erminy.html]&lt;/ref&gt; His painting [[The Vortices of Wrath (Lebanon 1977)]] is a perfect depiction of the country in a time of war. The dark grays and black make for a gloomy, sad mood. In the center, it appears as though there is a power struggle between rugged figures. There is one power trying to over come the other. The way kanso uses blurry images gives a creepy feel.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}} While in the back ground it appears as though there are skeleton like figures. His brush strokes are very apparent and give the painting its life even though it is all about death. It is clear that Kanso drew from the time of the war by the way he make the paintings so solemn.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}

The Lebanese Civil war was not the only influence in Kanso's work but also the wars in [[Vietnam (Kanso)|Vietnam]] and  the continuing war in the Middle East.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}} We can clearly see this in his paintings [[Kuwait (Kanso series)|Desert Storm]].{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}} Here he shows women suffering by losing a child becoming victims of war. "The victims," an art critic writes, "are the newborn torn out of wombs or clinging to mothers fleeing natural catastrophes or political disasters."&lt;ref&gt;Seaberg, Ronnog: ''Nabil Kanso: Life Work'' , Vår Lősen, pp.371-381, 1997, Stockholm, Sweden [http://kanso.info/ronnog.html]&lt;/ref&gt; It is noted by some critics that motherhood is important with Kanso's women; you see mothers at the moment of birth and in death holding children in their arms. The bars that recur from one work to another are sometimes placed at the opening of the woman's womb. The children suffer with their mothers as fire, storms, or ice intensifies the human situation. People of different religions are united in suffering and passion in these works of art.&lt;ref&gt;Seaber, Ronnog, ''Life Work'',  Vår Lősen, p.380&lt;/ref&gt;  The noted lack of greens in Kanso's art marks his criticism of destruction of the environment. Nothing can grow during war. Flesh and blood appears to be everywhere. Water is for drowning, or for freezing. Icicles look like hairy insect legs or barbed wire. The rarely discerned sky sometimes reveals a glimpse of the forefathers like pale blue ghosts look down at their descendants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kanso.info/ronnog.html Seaberg, Ronnog: ''Life work'', p.380]&lt;/ref&gt;  War has a major influence in his work and has made his work become almost biblical and it's represented in his paintings dealing with war and apocalyptic themes, and the [[Apocalypse Series (Kanso)|Apocalypse]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://kanso.info/erminy.html Erminy, ''The Apocalyptic Paintings of Nabil Kanso'', p.2]&lt;/ref&gt; He uses apocalyptic science in his art work making them almost biblical by painting his work with earthquakes, floods, ice, fire and blood referring this to the [[bible]]'s [[apocalypse]].{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}} Nabil Kanso's apocalyptic themes can be said to be linking with the destruction of the Middle East due to war, to the destruction of the birthplace of Jesus and Christianity.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}

===War and apocalyptic themes===

War and apocalyptic themes are central focus of Kanso's works since the early seventies. They provide the primary basis for his large-scale paintings responding to war and depicting apocalyptic visions&lt;ref&gt;Nabil Kanso: ''The Split of Life'', pp. 11-13, Nev Editions, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; "Over the course of his career," an art critic writes, "Kanso created an extraordinary body of work dealing with war and apocalyptic themes that open up the visions of apocalyptic art."&lt;ref&gt;Erminy, Peran: ''the Apocalyptic Paintings of Nabil Kanso,'' [[El Nacional (Caracas)|El Nacional]], p. 3, April 26, 1987, Caracas [http://apocalypsepainting.com/erminy.html]&lt;/ref&gt; In dealing with horrors of war," another critic writes, "Kanso creates enormous paintings that serve as powerful weapons in fighting war."&lt;ref&gt;Fuenmayor, Carlos: ''Space Cry, Time Cry'', Columna, pp. 8-9, May 21, 1987, Maracaibo [http://apocalypsepainting.com/fuenmayor.html]&lt;/ref&gt; "Kanso declares war on war," reads a headline article on his [[Gulf War]] exhibition in [[Kuwait]].&lt;ref&gt;Huwaidi, Sayed: ''Kanso Declares War on War'', [[Al-Watan (Kuwait)|Al-Watan]], April 23, 1982, Kuwait [http://kuwaitpainting.com/alwatan.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The paintings show the whole gamut of human suffering and pain. The tortured language itself makes his work a universal manifestation of solidarity and protest against the proliferation of war.&lt;ref&gt;Fuenmayor, ''Space Cries'', p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; The canvases reveal a world permeated by a chain of chaos and violence in a hellish environment from which people are desperately trying to escape in order to survive.&lt;ref&gt;Erminy, Peran: the Apocalyptic Paintings, El Nacional, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; They find themselves immersed in an incisive and violent totality in which they are trapped.&lt;ref&gt;Guevera, Luis: ''Between Horrors and Dominating Rupture'', Exhibition Catalog, pp.5-6, Ateneo, 1987, Caracas [http://lebanonwarpainting.com/guevara.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The emotionally steering images draw the interest and involvement of the public in witnessing the violent events in scenes filled with pathos and tensions that reach extreme intensity.&lt;ref&gt;Erminy, ''The Apocalyptic Paintings'', pp. 3-4&lt;/ref&gt; The depicted horror, one critic notes, present a form of interiority as for example in the interior of [[Soviet War in Afghanistan|Afghanistan]], [[Lebanese Civil War|Lebanon]], [[Nicaragua]], [[El Salvador Civil War|El Salvador]], [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]]. A total war, a pure war, one in which destruction is rallied to the absolute in conjunction with the corporeal and everything "else" is relegated to the status of target or cipher, a demarcation of the site of a bullet, bomb, or rocket. Hell is nothing but what it is.&lt;ref&gt;[http://splitoflife.com/sondheim.html Sondheim: ''The Split of Life Paintings'', Nexus, Atlanta, 1985]&lt;/ref&gt; His paintings transmit images of the palpable reality of a world where pain, suffering, brutality, and destruction are everywhere.&lt;ref&gt;Rossi, Ildebrando: ''Expressions: A Protest Against War'', [[Diario Panorama|Panorama]], p.3, April 14, 1985, Maracaibo [http://apocalypsepainting.com/panorama85.html]&lt;/ref&gt; "They provide," a critics notes "a powerful indictment and denunciation of wars in the Middle East and Central America. Hence the mural-scale format enveloping an enormous space in projecting harrowing images as a consequence of  war."&lt;ref&gt;Rossi: ''Expressions'', Panorama, p.3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rossi, I: ''The Art of Nabil Kanso'', Panorama, April 14, 1985, Maracaibo [http://apocalypsepainting.com/panorama.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The reality of what is happening in a war zone and what is expressed in the painting underlines the relationship of the artist's mental and physical involvement with the work.&lt;ref&gt;Peran: ''The Apocalyptic Paintings'', p.4&lt;/ref&gt; He expresses a juncture between his supercharged psyche and our anxiety and fear, provoking the explosion we see and feel in his paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Erminy: ''the Apocalyptic Paintings'', p.4&lt;/ref&gt; "The intensity of the portrayed scenes heightens the atmosphere of fear and oppression", one critic remarks, "and awakens us or at least gives our dream an authentic vision of the final disaster."&lt;ref&gt;Guevara, Luis: ''Between Horrors'', p.12&lt;/ref&gt; They open a window through which we contemplate and ponder on our precarious existence, beginning with the most intransigent and total fact of contemporary fear: total extinction. "They reveal, the never-ending darkness existing in an ephemeral glare right before bursting. The power of weapons is a terrible and absurd reality which mutates the space of human warmth."&lt;ref&gt;Guevara, Luis: ''Between Horrors and Dominating Rupture'', pp.5-6&lt;/ref&gt; "The very idea of the possible destruction of the planet by nuclear war has totally changed our view of the world," observed Octavio Paz.&lt;ref&gt;Jimenez, Maritza: ''Nabil Kanso Apocalypse'', [[El Universal (Caracas)|El Universal]], April 30, 1987, Caracas [http://apocalypsepainting.com/jimenez.html]&lt;/ref&gt; "Meanwhile," a critic notes, "the world debates on perpetual small wars undermining the planet with ongoing disasters. The destruction and devastation of war are shown to us in the images of Nabil Kanso who Venezuelans came to know him as the Painter of the Apocalypse."&lt;ref&gt;Jimenez, Maritza: ''Nabil Kanso Paintings of the Apocalypse Herald a Reality of Universal Dimensions'', [[El Nacional (Caracas)|El Nacional]], p.1, August 25, 1987, Caracas [http://apocalypsepainting.com/jimenez.html]&lt;/ref&gt; He faithfully expresses orphanage, rage and the importance of living.&lt;ref&gt;Guevera: ''Between Horrors and Dominating Rupture'', pp. 5-6&lt;/ref&gt; "His mural paintings," a critic observed, "stand as a tribunal in interpreting and transmitting the voices that burst out of the canvases in a massive force, and plunge into an apocalyptic storm."&lt;ref&gt;Fuenmayor: ''Time Cries'', p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kanso's style===
Nabil Kanso's works have been said to be apocalyptic in many ways, in Kanso's works he paints scenes of destruction, destroyed buildings, and people usually naked with looks of horror on their faces. He uses red, orange, and yellow to resemble fire, dark colors as if he was painting a nightmare or a scene of hell.

In carrying out his work Nabil Kanso appears calm and quiet. But the light of fire in the paintings look like nightmares which he has to work through, often spending several months on one painting.&lt;ref&gt;Bäckström, Lars: ''Nabil Kanso's Lebanon: Guernica of Our Time'' Ord &amp; Bild, pp.42-45, January 1986, Stockholm, Sweden [http://nabilkanso.org/backstrom.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Kanso's outstanding mural-scale paintings are a cross between the specificity of [[Francisco Goya|Goya]]'s 'Horror of War' and the universality of Picasso's [[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]. To stand in the central space surrounded by Nabil Kanso's 12-foot-high paintings is as close as you get to being in the middle of a fire. Using lurid oranges, yellows and reds, Kanso fills every inch of canvas with visions of violence and human suffering that rival medieval descriptions of Hell.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, Catherine: ''Fantastic Visions'', [[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]], September 19, 1985, p. H2&lt;/ref&gt; One painting went the entire length of the room, maybe 30 feet. I felt like a coward. It was almost impossible to look at the power and extravagance of these scenes, so I turned instead and looked at the faces of the other onlookers. In their faces were the reflections of the painted holocaust around us. I turned again to the painting which now entrapped is in a cage of feeling.&lt;ref&gt;Seaberg, Steve. ''An Artist Response'' [[Art Papers]], p.51, November, 1985, Atlanta [http://splitoflife.com/seaberg.html]&lt;/ref&gt; It is noted by some critics that "Kanso's highly expressive personal style evokes experiences and visions that reveal the inner essence of a reality lying beyond its external aspects".&lt;ref&gt;[http://kanso.info/erminy.html Erminy, ''Kanso's apocalyptics paintings, p.3]&lt;/ref&gt; A view of a troubled world is portrayed in compositions whose imageries carry the art towards issues of human concern.&lt;ref&gt;Erminy, ''Apocalyptic Paintings'', p.3&lt;/ref&gt; They record intense, harrowing images of haunting themes voicing universal expressions on human brutality and suffering. In the opinion of some art critics "Kanso strong colors and powerful brushstrokes blend with the subject matter: world chaos."&lt;ref&gt;Figueroa, Hugo: ''The Paintings of Nabil Kanso'', Panorama, p. 8, April 28, 1985, Maracaibo [http://nabilkanso.org/figueroa.html]&lt;/ref&gt; It is further noted that the battle against large formats cannot be won but with a strong determination and an absolute mastery of technique. These are inseparable and preconceived. The dynamic handling of the pictorial layout has a total identification with Kanso's topical matter. His powerful themes could in no way be handled with softer and milder style designed to make them palatable. By way of parallelism, Kanso's work is a harmony of style and subject matter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nabilkanso.org/figueroa.html Figueroa: ''The Paintings of Nabil Kanso'', p.8]&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Split of Life'' paintings===

Main article ''[[The Split of Life]]''

''The Split of life'' paintings comprise approximately 80 mural-size paintings executed between 1974 and 1994, and were the main focus of Kanso's work during the 15-year [[Lebanese Civil War]] that broke out in 1975&lt;ref&gt;Nabil Kanso: ''The Split of Life Paintings'', NEV Editions, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; The works are characterized by the consistency and relatedness of their subjects and themes dealing with violence and war. In emphasizing the issues and bringing attention to the destruction, devastation, and suffering resulting from perpetual wars, Kanso took his paintings to various places in extensive exhibitions that traveled widely, particularly in Venezuela and Latin America.

The exhibition of works related by subject and theme projected a sense of overall-ness, a sense of one painting running into another.&lt;ref&gt;Kurlansky, Gail: ''Nabil Kanso: The Split of Life: Looking for the Poet: Power, Death, and Sexuality'', Art Papers, pp. 23-26, November, 1986   [http://splitoflife.com/1.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  A reviewer of an exhibition in [[Maracaibo]] featuring works from 1976 to 1984, wrote "The synchrony and diachrony of the works cross a still point in which the show is no longer a total of 27 paintings, but only one."&lt;ref&gt;Figueroa: ''The art of Kanso, Panorama, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;  A critic viewed the works linkage at an exhibition in Atlanta as "a net, a polyvalence of economic, cultural, political, and sexual discourse."&lt;ref&gt;Kurlansky, ''The Split of Life'', p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; The net is not just a formal manipulation to tie the divergent contents of the paintings together, but "a very real device that grew out of the complex discourse of the paintings and ultimately from the poetics of the painter."&lt;ref&gt;Kurlansky: ''The Split of Life'', Art Papers, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;  At a 10-year survey in [[Caracas]] a critic wrote "the installation of Kanso monumental paintings projects an immense space charged with a high level of intensity closely connected to the tension and anxiety that we face in the world today. His apocalyptic paintings offers us a voyage to the hells of our time."&lt;ref&gt;Erminy, Peran: ''the Apocalyptic Paintings'', El Nacional, p. 3, April 26, 1987, Caracas [http://apocalypsepainting.com/erminy.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Studios===

[[File:Nabil Kanso in Atlanta Studio 84.jpg|thumb|right]]

Early in 1967, Kanso set up a studio on East 20th Street at [[Gramercy Park]] South, and in 1968, moved to a larger studio on East 76th Street where it remained until 1974 when it was seized and its contents were placed in storage, and, eventually, lost.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, Catherine: ''Artist Inspired by War-Torn Homeland'', Atlanta Journal/Constitution, pp. H1-3, July 8, 1984. [http://nabilkanso.org/fox.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  For a period he worked in New York and in different cities in the [[Southern United States|South]], and in 1980, he settled Atlanta where he acquired a spacious studio.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nabilkanso.com/statement.html Kanso, Nabil: ''Life-Task'', Kanso Studio, August 2001, Atlanta]&lt;/ref&gt;

For more than 20 years, the studio was an attractive place for many visitors. A critic described it as "filled with enormous paintings representing a kind of a nightmare about the war in Lebanon, which has been the subject of Kanso's large paintings since the war started in 1975."&lt;ref&gt;Bäckström, Lars: ''Guernica of Our Time'', Ord &amp; Bild, pp. 42-45, January, 1986 Stockholm, Sweden [http://lebanonpainting.com/backstrom.html]&lt;/ref&gt; It is not just the horrors of the war in Lebanon that he is painting, it is as much the disasters of war in Vietnam, Nicaragua, and El Salvador. Rows of canvases are swarming with figures fleeing, fighting with each other, eating each other."&lt;ref&gt;Bäckström, Lars: ''From Odessa to Atlanta'', Democraten, p. 4, January 24, 1985, Uppsala, Sweden [http://lebanonpainting.com/lars.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Another critic observed "canvasses rolled up in great numbers like mummies," and noted the connection between the linen cloth in Egyptian wraps and Kanso's own life. His father founded a linen cloth business in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Seaberg, Ronnog: ''Nabil Kanso: Life Work'', Vår Lősen, pp. 378-81, 1997, Stockholm, Sweden [http://kanso.info/ronnog.html]&lt;/ref&gt; 
In describing a visit to his studio, an art critic wrote "walking around was like taking a tour of Dante's Inferno. With agitated brushstrokes and lurid oranges, Kanso has produced a roomful of frightening images reminiscent of late Goya's mural, all the more menacing because they are over 7 feet tall".&lt;ref&gt;Fox: ''War-Torn Homeland'', Atlanta Journal, p. H5.&lt;/ref&gt;
A reviewer remarked "Startled is a weak word to describe my reaction. Every wall covered with paintings that reached the ceilings. In some places, the paintings were leaning against each other several deep. Others, lots, rolled up on the floor. It was hard to believe one man had done all of this. It wasn't just that the paintings were large but their content was brilliantly focused, it came from a seeming struggle going on in a landscape that appeared biblical."&lt;ref&gt;[http://splitoflife.com/seaberg.html Seaberg, ''An Artist Response'', Art Papers, p. 51, November 1986]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Political anthropology|Studies}}

'''''Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali''''' is a 1980 book written by [[anthropologist]] [[Clifford Geertz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geertz argues that the pre-colonial Balinese state was not a "[[Hydraulic empire|hydraulic bureaucracy]]" nor an [[oriental despotism]], but rather, an organized spectacle. The noble rulers of the island were less interested in administering the lives of the Balinese than in dramatizing their rank and hence political superiority through large public rituals and ceremonies. These cultural processes did not support the state, he argues, but ''were'' the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=13–17, 21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is perhaps most clear in what was, after all, the master image of political life: kingship. The whole of the negara - court life, the traditions that organized it, the extractions that supported it, the privileges that accompanied it - was essentially directed toward defining what power was; and what power was what kings were. Particular kings came and went, 'poor passing facts' anonymized in titles, immobilized in ritual, and annihilated in bonfires. But what they represented, the model-and-copy conception of order, remained unaltered, at least over the period we know much about. The driving aim of higher politics was to construct a state by constructing a king. The more consummate the king, the more exemplary the centre. The more exemplary the centre, the more actual the realm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Geertz used the Balinese case to develop an abstract model of the [[Theatre state]] applicable to all the South East Asian Indic polities. To succinctly summarize his theory, "Power served pomp, not pomp power." Other anthropologists have contested the ahistorical, static nature of the model. They point out that he has depoliticized a political institution by emphasizing culture while ignoring its material base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=MacRae|first=Graeme|title=Negara Ubud: The Theatre-state in Twenty-first-century Bali|journal=History and Anthropology|year=2005|volume=16|issue=4|pages=393–413|doi=10.1080/02757200500344616}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Clifford Geertz was an American anthropologist who is remembered for his influence on the practice of [[symbolic anthropology]], and who was considered "for three decades...the single most influential cultural anthropologist in the United States."&lt;ref&gt;Geertz, Clifford, Shweder, R. A., &amp; Good, B. (2005). Clifford Geertz by his colleagues. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Geertz used this model to provide "an alternate conception of what politics is about"; to advance an approach to history as a succession of broad cultural schemata; and to contribute to the cultural dimension of the discussion on Southeast Asian polities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=MacRae|first=Graeme|title=Negara Ubud: The Theatre-state in Twenty-first-century Bali|journal=History and Anthropology|year=2005|volume=16|issue=4|pages=398|doi=10.1080/02757200500344616}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The book is a consideration of many elements of Balinese life, such as cremation ceremonies, that many would not consider a part of a state apparatus. In order to understand why cremation ceremonies should be so key to the "Theatre state" Geertz provides a detailed description of Balinese social organization [[Ethnography|in its own cultural terms]]. Particular aspects of Balinese life have been over-emphasized, according to some, to accommodate his model. Those aspects focus, in particular, on the role of irrigation.

===The Ruling Class===
For most of the nineteenth century, there were seven principal kingdoms, of which Klungkung was considered the oldest and most sacred. The others were Tabanan, Badung, Gianyar, Karengasem, Bangli, and Mengwi. They were primarily located on the plain on the south side of the island. Each of the kingdoms  controlled a riverine valley and hence the water supply required for rice irrigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The kingdoms of Bali were said to have been founded by Javanese refugees from the Hinduized kingdom of [[Majapahit]] which had just fallen to Muslim invaders. They, in turn, invaded in 1352 at Gelgel and established an Indic state based upon the caste system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=14–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The caste system====
The caste system only loosely resembled the caste system in India. The three noble castes were referred to as "''triwangsa''," (three peoples), the "insiders" (''wong jero'') as opposed to the commoners (''wong jaba'', outsiders).&lt;ref name="Geertz-p26-27"&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=26–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  MacRae argues that this emphasis on the Indic heritage of Bali is overdrawn, and points out that Geertz himself admits that caste is a misnomer in Bali, and "that the Indic surface  of Balinese political institutions has acted to inhibit a comparative reference eastwards... towards the Pacific."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=MacRae|first=Graeme|title=Negara Ubud: The Theatre-state in Twenty-first-century Bali|journal=History and Anthropology|year=2005|volume=16|issue=4|page=398|doi=10.1080/02757200500344616}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The dadia====
The basic unit of the triwangsa castes was the "noble house" or dadia. The commoners, for the most part, lacked these corporate kin groups.&lt;ref name="Geertz-p26-27" /&gt; The dadia was a kinship group whose leadership passed through the line of the eldest male, from father to son. Younger sons remained identified with the group, lived nearby, but had less status. The children of the core line also had more status than the children of the junior lines. Geertz refers to this as the principle of "sinking status." Each of these junior lines could potentially sever itself and form an independent dadia. This process of schism formed the internal politics within the royal houses, as distinct from political conflict between houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=27–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The status differentials both within and between houses made patron-client relations the basic idiom of politics. These client relationships were especially important between castes, linking the priestly caste (''padanda'') with noble houses in a teacher-disciple tie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=34–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides these patron-client ties within dadia, alliances also formed between dadia in different kingdoms. These alliances were frequently codified in treaties, although the issues they covered seemed "designed more to codify the pretexts upon which alliances could be broken than to establish the bases upon which they could be built."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Village and the State===
[[File:Bali temple diagram.png|thumbnail|right|Diagram of a Balinese temple]]
[[File:PuraDalemSidan.jpg|thumbnail|Pura Dalem Sidan (temple)]]

The Balinese ruling classes seemed fragmented, internally torn by intrigues within dadia, and weakly allied between kingdoms. This poor political integration was aggravated by the political independence of the villages under royal dadia rule. The Balinese state was composed of institutions that cross-cut villages. Villages were not independent, self-contained "village republics" but were cross-cut by membership in three separate locally based political institutions that organized local life: the hamlet (''banjar''), the irrigation society (''subak''), and the temple congregation (''pemaksan''). Villages were also crosscut by tax obligations to different lords.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=45–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The village (''banjar'')====
The Balinese village has been falsely described in the colonial literature as a "village republic", bounded, self-contained and wholly autonomous. According to Geertz, an important part of this book was to disrupt colonial images of the closed corporate village. Geertz emphasizes that the village controlled only certain aspects of the everyday life of Balinese villagers, and that the tax and temple systems cross-cut village membership. That is, the members of a single village might pay taxes through several ''perbekel'' and be part of different temple congregations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The village did have a constitution, which spelled out its members responsibilities for road making, upkeep of public facilities, night watch, and settlement of civil disputes. The village had its own leadership (''klian banjar''). This range of duties led Geertz to conclude "In brief, perhaps the bulk (though as we shall see, far from the whole) of Balinese government, in the strict sense of authoritative regulation of social life, was carried out by the hamlet, leaving the state free to dramatize power rather than to administer it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The temple congregation (''pemaksan'')====
Although focused on religious rites, the pemaksan was a corporate public body that was also an agency of government because of the link between religion and custom, i.e. forms of worship and social behaviour in Bali. Such religious rites were considered "adat" (custom), "the entire framework of social action in which both men and gods are enclosed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; The variety of small variations in adat defined the boundaries between pemaksan. The pemaksan thus stands as the moral community, next to the civil community embodied in the hamlet and the economic community in the irrigation society. The pemaksan will draw on one to ten villages for its members.

The pemaksan will maintain the "Three Great Temples" (''Kahyangan Tiga''): 1) the Origin Temple (''Pura Puseh'') which commemorates the human settlement of the area. 2) The Death Temple (''Pura Dalem'') used to pacify the not yet cremated and hence dangerous dead. And 3) the Great Council Temple (''Pura Balai Agung'') for ensuring the overall fertility of the pemaksan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Irrigation system (''Subak'')====
[[File:1 Tegalalang rice terrace ubud bali.jpg|left|thumb|[[Subak (irrigation)|Subak]] irrigation system]]

According to Geertz, one of the most important of state institutions in Bali is the irrigation society (''subak'') given the theoretical emphasis placed upon irrigation in the materialist models of the "[[Asiatic mode of production]]." These models viewed the control of irrigation by lords as the major means of also controlling the population that depended on those irrigation works for their sustenance. Geertz views the subak as an autonomous organization separate from the state, much like the banjar. The system of dams, dikes and canals were the property of the subak, and hence controlled by the farmers themselves. Geertz thus dismisses any notion of "primitive communism" - and its spectre, "state capitalism."&lt;ref name="Geertz-p69"&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A subak controls the water flowing from a single up-river dam. The water flows through its rice terraces to other subaks farther downstream. Once water flowed into a subak it was divided through a series of weirs so that each farmer would get the amount of water they needed at the right time. The regulation of water is thus a serious issue, and encounters regular bottlenecks where control of the supply for a whole subak can be seized. Controlling the complex flow of water within a subak was accomplished through a highly regimented series of rituals. Water temples placed at points of water division would coordinate the flow of water through carefully timed rituals. Geertz emphasizes that there is no central control of the timing of these rituals, and hence that the state is not an "oriental despotism" controlling the population through the control of water.&lt;ref name="Geertz-p69" /&gt;

[[File:Bali panorama.jpg|thumb|300px|Balinese rice terraces is part of Subak irrigation system.]]

It is Geertz's characterization of the irrigation system as headless that has attracted critique. Stephen Lansing's examination of Balinese irrigation shows that the need for effective water management links thousands of farmers in clear hierarchies, beginning with the most sacred temples dedicated to the Goddess of the volcanic Crater Lake ([[Mount Agung]]) that all Balinese hold sacred, and descending into the plains and low-lying rice fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lansing|first=Stephen|title=Priests and Programmers: technologies of power in the engineered landscape of Bali|year=1991|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing on nineteenth century Balinese records, Brigitta Hauser-Schaublin has shown that regional lords and kings played a large role in managing irrigation, and that this role was lost only in the Dutch colonial period. She argues that Geertz's failure to see the larger state role in water management reflects this change in colonial practice, thereby weakening the "theatre state" model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hauser-Schaublin|first=Brigitta|title=Temple and King: Resource Management, Rituals and Redistribution in Early Bali |journal=Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute|year=2005|volume=11|issue=4|pages=747–71|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9655.2005.00260.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Perbekel system ====
The free, land-owning ''kawulas'' made up 90% of the population. Kawulas were attached to a perbekel, a "political foreman" to whom they owed specific obligations and taxes. The perbekels were attached to punggawas, the lords of dadia. Unlike the village, none of these political roles was based upon territorial residence. In other words, membership in the village was cross-cut by obligations to different perbekels and their lords.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bali was thus not a feudal realm where lords controlled land and people within a fiefdom. Lords and kawulas owned their own land, and lords did not generally seek their kawulas as tenants on their land. Kawulas had only two obligations to their perbekels: ritual service and military support: "He was a stagehand, spear carrier, and [[claqueur]] in an endless political opera."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=65–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Trade====
Although Bali lies along major Indonesian trade roots in the north, its mountainous geography orients it to the south; its only navigable port was at Kuta, on a southern peninsula. The bulk of trade remained in foreign hands, including the Chinese, [[Javanese people|Javanese]], [[Bugis|Buginese]] and Europeans. Foreigners were largely restricted to these insulated ports of trade. Trade within Bali occurred in rotating markets characterized by traditional fixed exchange rates. Goods and services were also circulated through large scale [[Redistribution (cultural anthropology)|redistributive]] ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization of international trade was leased out by the king to a ''subandar'' (harbour master), who served as an intermediary between the traders and the dadia of the royal house, to whom he paid the rent. This rent was paid to each Lord of the royal house whenever they held a ceremony. The more ceremonies held, the greater share a Lord would receive of the spoils of trade. The point of trade then, was to hold larger spectacles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spectacle and political power===
[[File:Ubud Cremation 3.jpg|thumbnail|left|Balinese Cremation tower]]

Geertz argues that state ceremonials in the Negara were "metaphysical theatre"; that is, theatre designed to express a vision of the ultimate nature of reality that at the same time tried to shape current conditions to match that reality. Ritual events all re-created social relations of jero ("inner", to whom one surrendered power in the ritual event thereby making them powerful) and jaba ("outer", a provider of services to those who are jero) between lords and their kawula. Every ritual performance reproduced jero-jaba relations as both symbolic ideal and pragmatic reality, thereby reinforcing social order. Thus, although the state was cross-cut by the conflicting jurisdictions of temples, hamlets, and irrigation societies, they all come together  for mass state rituals in which the ideal social order of the state is made real.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The role of the cremation ceremony====
The cremation ceremony was the largest and most ostentatious of the state rituals, attended by all the political dependants of a lord. At the centre of the ritual was the cremation tower (badé) on which the body of the deceased lord rested in state until the whole was consumed in fire. The cremation tower itself symbolized the cosmic order the ritual sought to make real. At its base were the world of demons (winged serpents), above which stood a platform called the House, representing the world of man. Above that were the tiers of roofs symbolizing the world of the gods, to which the deceased was ascending; a commoner would ascend to the first heaven (1 tier), whereas a king to the eleventh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While having an eleven storey tower was iconic of regal status, accomplishing a cremation ritual was an accomplishment - a struggle - that justified that status. The first part of the ceremony, for example, involved transporting the tower in a procession to the cremation ground, a mob scene involving thousands; some of these carried the bier forward, while others tried to stop it. The struggle could potentially prevent those who lacked the status and resources from making what others felt were false claims; the scene "was a bit like a playful riot - a deliberated, even studied, violence, designed to set off a no less deliberated and even more studied stillness, which the variously imperturbable priests, agnates, widows and tributary dead contrived to gather about the central tower."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=118–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and critique of the book==
[[File:Southeast Asian Historical Mandalas.svg|thumb|right|Notable mandala states in [[History of Southeast Asia|Southeast Asian history]] (circa 5th to 15th century). From north to south; [[Pagan Kingdom|Bagan]], [[Ayutthaya kingdom|Ayutthaya]], [[Champa]], [[Khmer empire|Angkor]], [[Srivijaya]] and [[Majapahit]].]]
Although Geertz considered this the pinnacle of his thinking on politics and history, reactions to the book have been mixed, "combining admiration for its scope and ambition with scepticism about its claims."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=MacRae|first=Graeme|title=Negara Ubud: The Theatre-state in Twenty-first-century Bali|journal=History and Anthropology|year=2005|volume=16|issue=4|pages=394|doi=10.1080/02757200500344616}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One source of the scepticism is that the book is clearly not a history of a specific polity, but a generalized ideal-type model intended to guide representations of the Southeast Asian Indic states found in [[Bali]], [[Java]], [[Malaysia]], [[Thailand]] and [[Burma]] in the fifth to fifteenth centuries. As such, it is one of several models, such as that of O.W. Wolters "[[Mandala (Southeast Asian political model)|mandala]]" model, or [[Stanley Tambiah]]'s model of the "Galactic polity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Day|first=Tony|title=Fluid Iron: State formation in Southeast Asia|year=2002|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|location=Honolulu|pages=8–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geertz made it clear that his emphasis was a general model of the "theatre state" and not a specific Balinese kingdom by referring to the Balinese state with the Indic term Negara, whereas the Balinese refer to their pre-colonial state as a ''kerajaan''. As such, it over-estimates the Indic influence on Bali, and under-estimates its similarities with Polynesian kingdoms in [[Tahiti]], [[Samoa]] and [[Hawaii]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=MacRae|first=Graeme|title=Negara Ubud: The Theatre-state in Twenty-first-century Bali|journal=History and Anthropology|year=2005|volume=16|issue=4|pages=398–403|doi=10.1080/02757200500344616}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critiques of the book have focused on:

1) As a culturalist approach to history, it is remarkably static and ahistorical. [[Fredrik Barth]] argued that it "depoliticized" a political institution as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barth|first=Fredrik|title=Balinese worlds|year=1993|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2) By subordinating power to culture, the book ignores the material base of power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Howe|first=Leo|title=Rice, ideology and the legitimation of hierarchy in Bali|journal=Man|year=1991|volume=26|issue=4|pages=445–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Geertz's book was published, several other historical studies of particular kingdoms have appeared which emphasize the more conventional political economic forms of power underlying the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=MacRae|first=Graeme|title=Negara Ubud: The Theatre-state in Twenty-first-century Bali|journal=History and Anthropology|year=2005|volume=16|issue=4|page=395|doi=10.1080/02757200500344616}}&lt;/ref&gt;

3) Geertz makes the ritual aspect of Balinese culture "more exotic, more extraordinary and more other than the evidence warrants."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Howe|first=Leo|title=Rice, ideology and the legitimation of hierarchy in Bali|journal=Man|year=1991|volume=26|issue=4|page=451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

4) Tambiah notes that Geertz presents the Balinese kings as, at once, the focus of ritual theatre that creates the exemplary centre as a still point, "immobilized into passivity and reflective trances" yet at the same time "Rent by virtually continuous intrigue, dispute, violence and an enormous amount of micro-upheaval."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tambiah|first=Stanley|title=Culture, Thought, and Social Action: An Anthropological Perspective|year=1985|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge MA|pages=320–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his best effort, Geertz does not transcend the break between expressive and instrumental action, or between power as pomp and power as control of people and resources.  He thus leaves himself open to Marxist critiques that view the state as a mystification, an "illusory representation of the unity of the village communities (as Marx put it in his sketch of 'oriental despotism'), and that the ceremonies of state are nothing but the spiritualizing of material interests and the covering up of material conflicts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tambiah|first=Stanley|title=Culture, Thought, and Social Action: An Anthropological Perspective|year=1985|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge MA|page=319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peshawari chappal''' ({{lang-ps|پېښورۍ چپل}}) is a [[traditional]] [[footwear]] of [[Pakistan]], worn especially by [[Pashtun people|Pashtuns]] in the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] region. The shoe takes its name from the city of [[Peshawar]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/The-Peshawari-chappal/Article1-340163.aspx |title=The Peshawari chappal |publisher=Hindustan Times |date=September 24, 2008 |accessdate=October 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it originates from, while "chappal" is the local word for [[flip-flops]]. Peshawari chappal is worn by men casually or formally, usually with the [[Shalwar kameez]] dress. Because of its comfort, it is used in place of [[sandal]] or [[slipper]] in Pakistan.

It is a semi-closed footwear which consists of two wide strips where both strips are joined with the sole by crossing each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jAd-SuLr6s/ |title=The Making of Peshawari Chappal – Innovation Punjab |publisher=Innovation.gop.pk |date= |accessdate=August 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The back side has also a strip with a [[buckle]] to tie according to the foot size and level of comfort. It is traditionally made with pure [[leather]] with its sole often made of [[truck]] [[tyre (wheel)|tyre]]. It is available in many traditional designs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myoffstreet.com/Product/18583 |title=Suede Peshawari Chappal by Color Hive &amp;#124; Peshawar |publisher=myoffstreet |date= |accessdate=October 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and colors with various variations such as works of golden and silver threads, which give the shoe a more elegant look. Peshawari chappals have become increasingly popular&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefrontierpost.com/?p=50590 |title=Peshawar News :: Peshawari chappal becoming fade in high society |publisher=Frontier Post |date=August 30, 2011 |accessdate=October 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in other parts of Pakistan; even wearing them with [[jeans]] has become a fashion trend, especially among urban youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/TodaysPrintDetail.aspx?ID=16976&amp;Cat=7&amp;dt=May 5, 2011 |title=Peshawari Chappal with jeans becomes a youth cult |publisher=Thenews.com.pk |date=November 24, 2010 |accessdate=October 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the increase access of  Peshawari Chappals through ecommerce websites it's now revitalizing with new designs in many cities of Pakistan and Dubai.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://propakistani.pk/2016/09/08/baaz-pk-bringing-peshawari-chappals-mainstream/|title=Peshawari Chappals Ecommerce Trend in Pakistan|last=|first=|date=September 8, 2016|website=ProPakistani|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peshawari Chappals are made from soft leather which is sown onto the rubber tyre sole. The materials are cheap, easily available and very hard wearing. Intricate designs are added to the leather upper before the shoe is put into a mould which stretches it to size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chappals.co.uk/peshawari/|title=Peshawari Chappals &amp; Sandals sales, reviews and information|author=|date=|website=chappals.co.uk|accessdate=April 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, Peshawari Chappal became the center of a global fashion debate when Sir [[Paul Smith (fashion designer)]] made a similar shoe, which sold for £300.&lt;ref&gt;DEAD LINK: {{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2014/03/11/how-paul-smith-sandals-peeved-pakistan/&amp;dt=March 11, 2014 |title=How Paul Smith Sandals Peeved Pakistan |publisher=The Wall Street Journal |date=March 11, 2014 |accessdate=March 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This prompted complaints on social media that this appropriated the culture and craft of its original Pakistan makers. Over a thousand petitioners used [[Change.org]] to ask the designer and U.K. government for remedy. As a result, the shoe's description on the Paul Smith website was changed to read that it was "inspired by Peshawari Chappal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.tribune.com.pk/story/21357/paul-smith-shoes-and-cultural-appropriation/|title=Paul Smith shoes and cultural appropriation|work=tribune.com.pk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/cultural-outrage-erupts-over-high-fashion-designers-take-on-pakistani-shoe/article17411025/|title=Outrage erupts over designer’s take on classic Pakistani shoe|work=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Andrew|last=Buncombe|date=March 10, 2014|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/news/pakistan-vs-paul-smith-sandalwearers-bemused-by-famed-british-designers-attempts-to-sell-traditional-peshawari-chappalstyle-shoes-for-the-distinctly-untraditional-sum-of-300-9182540.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140310174510/http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/news/pakistan-vs-paul-smith-sandalwearers-bemused-by-famed-british-designers-attempts-to-sell-traditional-peshawari-chappalstyle-shoes-for-the-distinctly-untraditional-sum-of-300-9182540.html|title=Pakistan vs Paul Smith: Sandal-wearers bemused by famed British designer's attempts to sell traditional Peshawari chappal-style shoes for the distinctly untraditional sum of £300|archivedate=March 10, 2014|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1092257|title=A chappal of two cities: The £300 Paul Smith surprise|first=Madeeha|last=Syed|work=Dawn|date=March 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6034">The term '''political entrepreneur''' may refer to any of the following:

* someone (usually active in the fields of either [[politics]] or [[business]]) who founds a new political project, group, or [[political party]]
* a businessman who seeks to gain [[Profit (economics)|profit]] through [[subsidies]], [[protectionism]], government contracts, or other such favorable arrangements with government(s) through political influence (also known as a [[rent-seeking|rent-seeker]]).
* a political actor (not necessarily a politician) who seeks to further his or her own political career and popularity by pursuing the creation of policy that pleases the populace.

==Politician==
In the field of business, [[entrepreneurship]] involves people taking a [[risk]] in order to create new business ventures, to gain advantage over a competitor, and to maximize profits.

Traditionally entrepreneurs have been associated with the world of business, however the term is used in the political arena also. For example, [[Choi Taewook]] in 2004 wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''A political entrepreneur refers to a political player who seeks to gain certain political and social benefits in return for providing the common goods that can be shared by an unorganized general public. These common goods that political entrepreneurs attempt to provide to the populace generally include foreign- and domestic-related public policy, while the benefits they hope to gain involve voter support, public recognition, and personal popularity.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===History and cultural context===
The [[political activism]] of American business as a class has surged and ebbed at various historical moments. Variations in both business and countervailing political mobilization should be approached as problems of collective interpretation and action. To explain the historical patterns of class-wide business activism, we need to look at the dynamics of partisan regimes in [[American politics]]. [[political parties|Partisan]] leaders, not businesses or other policy-seekers themselves, have the strongest incentives to absorb the transaction costs associated with either broad-scale business or countervailing [[collective action]]. When partisan entrepreneurs see an opportunity to alter the distribution of power at the national level, they engage in a discursive exercise to remold business or oppositional interests and undertake the mobilization of these interests.
  
An analytical framework for dealing with political entrepreneurship and reform is proposed which is based on some new combinations of Schumpeterian political economy, an extended version of Tullock's model of democracy as franchise-bidding for natural monopoly and some basic elements of New Institutional Economics. It is shown that problems of insufficient award criteria and incomplete contracts which may arise in economic bidding schemes, also – and even more so – characterise political competition. At the same time, these conditions create leeway for Schumpeterian political entrepreneurship. The same is true for various barriers to entry in politics. These barriers affect a trade-off between political stability and political contestability which will be discussed with special emphasis on incentives and opportunities for political entrepreneurship in the sense of risking long-term investments in basic political reforms.

==Businessperson==
However the term is also used in a very different way by those that wish to contrast what they see as a pure "market entrepreneur" with someone that uses the political system to further a commercial venture or their own career. On this definition a political entrepreneur is a business entrepreneur who seeks to gain profit through [[subsidies]], [[protectionism]], government contracts, or other such favorable arrangements with government(s) through political influence (also known as [[corporate welfare]]).

[[Ed Younkins]] (in 2000) wrote: "Political entrepreneurs seek and receive help from the state and, therefore, are not true entrepreneurs." Similarly, [[Thomas DiLorenzo]] says, "a ''political entrepreneur'' succeeds primarily by influencing government to subsidize his business or industry, or to enact legislation or regulation that harms his competitors." He says, in contrast, the "''market entrepreneur'' succeeds financially by selling a newer, better, or less expensive product on the free market without any government subsidies, direct or indirect." He gives the example of a mousetrap manufacturer who seeks to gain market share by making a better mousetrap as being a market entrepreneur, and a manufacturer who lobbies Congress to ban the importation of foreign-made mousetraps as a political entrepreneur. (DiLorenzo, Thomas, Chapter 7 of ''How Capitalism Saved America'') [http://www.mises.org/story/2317]

In practice, the division between the market entrepreneur and the political entrepreneur can be hazy. Many business entrepreneurs share both characteristics in varying degrees. The term appears to have been coined by [[Burton W. Folsom Jr.]] in his book, ''The Myth of the Robber Barons''.

The '''''Portrait of a Young Man with a Book''''' is a c.1530s oil on board painting by [[Agnolo Bronzino]]. It likely depicts a literary friend of the artist holding open a collection of poetry. It entered the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City|New York]] in 1929, where it is still held.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26974">'''Religion and environmentalism''' is an emerging interdisciplinary subfield in the academic disciplines of [[religious studies]], [[religious ethics]], the [[sociology of religion]], and [[theology]] amongst others, with [[environmentalism]] and [[ecology|ecological]] principles as a primary focus.

==General overview==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2012}}

===Crisis of values===
This subfield is founded on the understanding that, in the words of Iranian-American [[Philosophy|philosopher]] [[Hossein Nasr|Seyyed Hossein Nasr]], "the environmental crisis is fundamentally a crisis of [[value (personal and cultural)|values]]," and that [[religion]]s, being a primary source of values in any [[culture]], are thus implicated in the decisions humans make regarding the [[Natural environment|environment]].

===Burden of guilt===
[[History|Historian]] [[Lynn Townsend White, Jr.|Lynn White, Jr.]] first made the argument in a 1966 lecture before the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], subsequently published in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', that [[Western Christianity]], having de-[[sacralized]] and instrumentalized [[nature]] to human ends, bears a substantial "burden of guilt" for the contemporary environmental crisis. White's essay stimulated a flurry of responses, ranging from defenses of [[Christianity]] to qualified admissions to complete agreement with his analysis.

===Eastern religions and indigenous peoples===
Some proposed that [[Eastern religions]], as well as those of [[indigenous peoples]], [[Neopaganism|neo-pagans]], and others, offered more [[Environmentally friendly|eco-friendly]] [[World view|worldviews]] than Christianity.  A third, more obscure camp, argued that while White's theory was  indeed correct, this was actually a benefit to society, and that thinning the populations of weaker plant and animal species via environmental destruction would lead to the [[evolution]] of stronger, more productive creatures.  See [[Kaitiaki]] in [[Māori religion]].

===Religion and ecology===
By the 1990s, many scholars of religion had entered the debate and begun to generate a substantial body of literature discussing and analyzing how nature is valued in the world's various religious systems. A landmark event was a series of ten conferences on Religion and Ecology organized by [[Yale University]] professors Mary Evelyn Tucker and John Grim and held at the [[Harvard University]] Center for the Study of World Religions from 1996 to 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Ecology and Religion|last = Tucker|first = Mary Evelyn|publisher = Island Press|year = 2013|isbn = 978-1-59726-707-6|location = Washington|pages = 6|last2 = Grim|first2 = John}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fore.yale.edu/religions-of-the-world-and-ecology-archive-of-conference-materials/|title=Religions of the World and Ecology: Archive Of Conference Materials|last=|first=|date=|website=Forum on Religion and Ecology at Yale|access-date=November 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 800 international scholars, religious leaders, and environmentalists participated in the conference series. The conferences concluded at the United Nations and at the American Museum of Natural History with more than 1,000 people in attendance. Papers from the conferences were published in a series of ten books (The Religions of the World and Ecology Book Series), one for each of the world's major religious traditions.

From these conferences, Tucker and Grim would form The Yale Forum on Religion and Ecology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fore.yale.edu/|title=The Yale Forum on Religion and Ecology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Forum has been instrumental in the creation of scholarship, in forming environmental policy, and in the greening of religion. In addition to their work with the Forum, Tucker and Grim's work continues in the ''Journey of the Universe'' film, book, and educational DVD series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.journeyoftheuniverse.org/|title=Welcome - Journey Of The Universe|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It continues to be the largest international multireligious project of its kind.

An active Religion and Ecology group has been in existence within the [[American Academy of Religion]] since 1991, and an increasing number of universities in [[North America]] and around the world are now offering courses on religion and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;“Religion and Ecology Group.” American Academy of Religion. https://papers.aarweb.org/content/religion-and-ecology-group Accessed July 28, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent scholarship on the field of religion and ecology can be found in the peer-reviewed academic journal ''Worldviews: Global Religions, Culture, and Ecology'' and in reference works such as the encyclopedia ''The Spirit of Sustainability''.

===Religion and nature===
Other landmarks in the emerging field was the publication of the ''Encyclopedia of Religion and Nature'' in 2005, which was edited by [[Bron Taylor]].  Taylor also led the effort to form the International Society for the Study of Religion, Nature and Culture, which was established in 2006, and began publishing the quarterly ''Journal for the Study of Religion, Nature, and Culture'' in 2007.

==Religions and the environment==
===Buddhism===
The best asset religion offers is the moral framework by which practitioners must abide.&lt;ref name="ecodharma.com"&gt;Eco-Dharma Center. (N.d.) Buddhism and Ecology. Catalan Pyrenees: Nick Day. Retrieved February 18, 2010, from http://www.ecodharma.com/influences-articles/buddhism-ecology.&lt;/ref&gt; Since many environmental problems have stemmed from human activity, it follows that religion might hold some solutions to mitigating destructive patterns. [[Buddhism]] idealizes and emphasizes interconnection,&lt;ref name="Tucker, M.E. 1998"&gt;Tucker, M.E. &amp; Williams, D.R. (Eds.). (1998). Buddhism and Ecology: The Interconnection of Dharma and Deeds. Cambridge: [[Harvard University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; thereby creating a mindset that creates a productive and cooperative relationship between humans and nature. That all actions are based on the premise of interconnection makes the Buddhist mindset effective in cultivating modesty, compassion, and balance among followers, which may ultimately mitigate the harm done to the environment.

One benefit of the Buddhist interconnected mindset is the inevitable humility that ensues. Because humans are entwined with natural systems, damage done upon the [[Earth]] is also harm done to humans.&lt;ref name="Badiner, A.H. 1990"&gt;Badiner, A.H. (1990). Dharma Gaia. United States of America: Parallax Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This realization is quite modifying to a human race that historically pillages the Earth for individual benefit. When rational humans minimize the split between humanity and nature and bridge the gaps,&lt;ref name="ecodharma.com"/&gt; only then will a mutual respect emerge in which all entities coexist rather than fight. Buddhism maintains that the reason for all suffering comes from attachment.&lt;ref&gt;Knierim, T. (Last modified 2009). Four Noble Truths. Big View. Retrieved February 24, 2010, from {{cite web |url=http://www.thebigview.com/buddhism/fourtruths.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091111202249/http://www.thebigview.com/buddhism/fourtruths.html |archivedate=2009-11-11 |df= }} .&lt;/ref&gt; When release from the tight grasp humanity has on individuality and separateness occurs, then oneness and interconnection is realized. So rather than emphasizing winners and losers, humanity will understand its existence within others; this results in a modesty that ends egoic mind.

Another benefit of Buddhist practice to the environment is the compassion that drives all thinking.&lt;ref name="ecodharma.com"/&gt; When humans realize that they are all connected, harm done to another will never benefit the initiator.&lt;ref name="Badiner, A.H. 1990"/&gt; Therefore, peaceful wishes for everyone and everything will ultimately benefit the initiator. Through accepting that the web of life is connected&lt;ref name="Tucker, M.E. 1998"/&gt;—if one entity benefits, all benefit&lt;ref name="Badiner, A.H. 1990"/&gt;—then the prevailing mindset encourages peaceful actions all the time. If everything depends on everything else, then only beneficial events will make life situations better. Acceptance of compassion takes training and practice, which is also encouraged by Buddhist moral conduct in the form of mediation. This habitual striving for harmony and friendship among all beings creates a more perfect relationship between humanity and nature.

Lastly, Buddhist mindset relies on taking the middle road or striving for balance. [[Siddhartha Gautama]], the founder of Buddhism, spent his life searching for the outlet of human suffering, eventually concluding that a balance must be established between self-destruction and self-indulgence.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, J. (Producer) &amp; Bertolucci, B (Director). (1994). [[Little Buddha]]. United States of America: Buena Vista Home Entertainment.&lt;/ref&gt; While modern, industrial humans emphasize economic and social aspects of life and lastly environmental aspects, this view is lopsided.&lt;ref name="Badiner, A.H. 1990"/&gt; When human preferences are leveled with environmental preferences—giving a voice to natural systems as well as human systems—then can balance and harmony be realized.

Therefore, using this idealized and disciplined framework that Buddhism has to offer can create lasting solutions to amending the broken relationship between humanity and nature. What ensues is an ethic, rather than a short-term policy or technological fix.&lt;ref name="Badiner, A.H. 1990"/&gt; When never-ending consumption patterns cease for the betterment of the world as a whole, then all systems will harmoniously interact in a non-abusive way.&lt;ref name="Badiner, A.H. 1990"/&gt; Without needing to adopt a new religion, just recognizing and accepting this mindset can help to heal the environmental injuries of the past.

Buddhists today are involved in spreading environmental awareness. In a meeting with the U.S Ambassador to the Republic of India [[Timothy J. Roemer]], the [[Dalai Lama]] urged the U.S to engage China on climate change in [[Tibet]].&lt;ref&gt;The Guardian Newspaper from http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/220120&lt;/ref&gt; The Dalai Lama has also been part of a series on discussions organised by the [[Mind and Life Institute]]; a non profit organisation that specializes on the relationship between [[science]] and Buddhism. The talks were partly about ecology, ethics and interdependence and issues on global warming were brought up &lt;ref&gt;[http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/21/on-climate-ethics-cow-burps-and-the-dalai-lama/ On Climate, Ethics, Cow Burps and the Dalai Lama] October 21, 2011 NYT&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
{{main|Christian views on environmentalism}}

[[Christianity]] has a historic concern for nature and the natural world. At the same time, ecological concerns operate in tension with [[anthropocentrism|anthropocentric]] values, such as the [[Biblical]] notion of human dominion over the Earth. ([[Book of Genesis|Gen]] 1:28) A broad range of Christian institutions are engaged in the [[environmental movement]] and contemporary environmental concerns.

====Latter Day Saint movement====
[[Mormon]] environmentalists find theological reasons for stewardship and conservationism through biblical and additional scriptural references including a passages from the [[Doctrine and Covenants]]: "And it pleaseth God that he hath given all these things unto man; for unto this end were they made to be used, with judgment, not to excess, neither by extortion" ([[Doctrine and Covenants|D&amp;C]] 59:20).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/59.20?lang=eng|title=Doctrine and Covenants 59:20|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Latter Day Saint movement]] has a complex relationship with environmental concerns, involving not only the religion but politics and economics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patheos.com/Resources/Additional-Resources/Mormon-Belief-and-the-Environment.html "Mormon Belief and the Environment"], by [[George B. Handley]] in [[Patheos]] September 15, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(1998) ''New Genesis: A Mormon Reader on Land and Community'' Editors: [[Terry Tempest Williams]], Gibbs M. Smith, William B. Smart {{ISBN|978-0-87905-843-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of [[environmentally friendly]] policies, [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] has a history of utilizing elements of conservationist policies for their [[Meeting house|meetinghouses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/ConservationPractices/|title=Timeline of Construction Practices|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The church first placed [[solar panels]] on a church meetinghouse in the [[Tuamotus|Tuamotu Islands]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700027829/Mormon-Church-unveils-solar-powered-meetinghouse.html|title=Mormon Church unveils solar powered meetinghouse|first=Scott|last=Taylor|date=28 April 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the church unveiled five [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] certified meetinghouse prototypes that are that will be used as future meetinghouse designs around the world, the first one having been completed in 2010 in [[Farmington, Utah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sltrib.com/news/ci_14968222|title=Utah Local News - Salt Lake City News, Sports, Archive - The Salt Lake Tribune|first=The Salt Lake|last=Tribune|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104095531/http://www.sltrib.com/news/ci_14968222|archivedate=2012-01-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinduism===
In [[Hinduism]], practitioners and scholars find traditional approaches to the natural environment in such concepts as [[dharmic]] ethics or [[prakrti]] (material creation), the development of [[ayurveda]], and readings of [[vedas|vedic literature]]. Hindu [[environmental activism]] also may be inspired by [[Gandhian philosophy]] and practical struggles, such as the [[Bishnoi]] community in Rajasthan &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author =Jain, Pankaj|title=Dharma and Ecology of Hindu Communities: Sustenance and Sustainability|publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]]|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Chipko]] resistance to [[forestry]] policies in [[Uttar Pradesh]], India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Chappl and Tucker|title=Hinduism and Ecology: The intersection of earth, sky and water|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mahatma Gandhi played a major role in Indian environmentalism, and has been called the "father of Indian environmentalism".&lt;ref&gt;Sanford, Whitney. ''Gandhi's Agrarian Legacy: Practicing Food, Justice, and Sustainability in India''. Journal for the Study of Religion, March 2013, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Gandhi's environmental thought parallels his social thoughts in that environmental sustainability and social inequalities should be managed in similar fashions.&lt;ref&gt;Sanford, Whitney. ''Gandhi's Agrarian Legacy: Practicing Food, Justice, and Sustainability in India''. Journal for the Study of Religion, March 2013, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; His non-violent teachings left a lasting impact, even agriculturally. Contemporary agrarian practices use the Bhagavad-Gita to establish practices that are deemed non-violent.&lt;ref&gt;Sanford, Whitney. ''Gandhi's Agrarian Legacy: Practicing Food, Justice, and Sustainability in India''. Journal for the Study of Religion, March 2013, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
{{See also|Islamic Foundation for Ecology and Environmental Science}}
Through the tradition from the [[Quran]] and the prophets, the environment was made sacred. It is believed that God did not create the environment for a random reason, but rather a reflection of truth. One can gain profound knowledge from nature thus, human beings are to preserve it and look after it.  Many chapters in the  Quran, refer to the beauties of nature as well as the headings of many chapters indicating the importance of it, such as: "The Sun", "Dawn", and "Morning Hours". Thus man is God's representative on this planet, if he is not charged with sustaining it, then at least he must not destroy it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=The Holy Quran and the Environment| year=2010| chapter=The Relationship between The Environment and Man| chapterurl=http://www.rissc.jo/index.php/english-publications.html| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129013542/http://rissc.jo/index.php/english-publications.html| archivedate=2010-11-29| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Islam]], the concept of a [[Hima (environmental protection)|hima]] or "inviolate zone" refers to a piece of land that has been set aside to prevent cultivation or any use other than [[Spirituality|spiritual]] purposes.

===Judaism===
{{Main|Judaism and environmentalism}}

In [[Judaism]], the natural world plays a central role in [[Jewish law]], literature, and liturgical and other practices. {{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Within the diverse arena of Jewish thought, beliefs vary widely about the human relation to the environment, though the rabbinic tradition has put Judaism primarily on an [[anthropocentrism|anthropocentric]] trajectory. However, a few contemporary Jewish thinkers and rabbis in the USA and [[Israel]] emphasized that a central belief in Judaism is that the Man (Ha Adam - האדם whose root comes from Haadama (earth) - האדמה, in [[Hebrew language]]), should keep the Earth in the same state as he received it from God, its eternal and actual "owner" (especially for the land of [[Israel]]), thus the people today should avoid polluting it and keep it clean for the future generations. According to this opinion, Judaism is clearly in line with the principles of environmental protection and [[sustainable development]].

In Jewish law (''halakhah''), ecological concerns are reflected in Biblical protection for fruit trees, rules in the [[Mishnah]] against harming the public domain, [[Talmud]]ic debate over noise and smoke [[Nezikin|damages]], and contemporary [[responsa]] on agricultural pollution. In [[Conservative Judaism]], there has been some attempt to adopt [[ecokashrut]] ideas{{Clarify|date=July 2011}} developed in the 1970s by Rabbi [[Zalman Schachter-Shalomi]]. In addition, Jewish activists have recruited principles of ''halakhah'' for environmental purposes, such as the injunction against unnecessary destruction, known as [[bal tashkhit]]. {{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

In contemporary Jewish liturgy, ecological concerns have been promoted by adapting a [[kabbalah|kabbalistic]] [[ritual]] for the holiday of trees, [[Tu Bishvat]]. Biblical and rabbinic texts have been enlisted for prayers about the environment, especially in [[Orthodox Judaism]] and [[Jewish Renewal]] movements.

In the U.S., a diverse coalition of Jewish environmentalists undertakes both educational and policy advocacy on such issues as [[biodiversity]] and [[global warming]].&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite web|title=About COEJL|publisher=Coalition on the Environment and Jewish Life, New York|url=http://www.coejl.org/~coejlor/about/|accessdate=2008-01-08}} and the [http://jewcology.org/map-of-initiatives/ Jewcology map of Jewish environmental initiatives].&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish environmentalists are drawn from all branches of religious life, ranging from Rabbi [[Arthur Waskow]] to the Orthodox group Canfei Nesharim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite pressrelease|url=http://canfeinesharim.org/who_we_are/in_news.php?page=13141|title=Canfei Nesharim Named One of North America’s Most Innovative Jewish Nonprofits|publisher=Canfei Nesharim|date=2007-10-08|accessdate=2008-01-08|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071108231605/http://canfeinesharim.org/who_we_are/in_news.php?page=13141|archivedate=2007-11-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Israel, [[Secular Jewish culture|secular Jews]] have formed numerous governmental and [[non-governmental organizations]] to protect nature and reduce pollution. While many Israeli environmental organizations make limited use of Jewish religious teachings, a few do approach Israel's environmental problems from a Jewish standpoint, including [http://www.earthday.org/partner/heschel-center-environmental-learning-and-leadership the Heschel Center for Environmental Learning and Leadership], named after [[Abraham Joshua Heschel]].

===Taoism===
[[Taoism]] offers many ideas that are in line with environmentalism, such as [[wu wei]], [[moderation]], [[compassion]] and Taoist [[animism]]. Parallels were found between Taoism and [[deep ecology]]. Pioneer of environmentalism [[John Muir]] was called "the Taoist of the West". Rosenfeld wrote 'Taoism is environmentalism'.&lt;ref name="Zai 2015"&gt;Dr Zai, J. [https://books.google.com/books?id=-WzMCQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover1 ''Taoism and Science: Cosmology, Evolution, Morality, Health and more''].

Baird Earth's Insights: A Multicultural Survey of Ecological Ethics from the Mediterranean Basin to the Australian Outback Callicott&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jainism===
In [[Jainism]], the ancient and perhaps timeless philosophical concepts, like ''Parasparopagraho Jivanam'', were more recently compiled into a [http://www.jainology.org/publications/jain-delaration-on-nature Jain Declaration on Nature], which describes the religion's inherent [[Biocentrism (ethics)|biocentrism]] and deep ecology. ({{cite encyclopedia |title=Parasparopagraho Jivanam|encyclopedia=Wikipedia|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasparopagraho_Jivanam}})

[[Ligier Richier]] was a 16th-century religious sculptor working in [[Lorraine (duchy)|Lorraine]], France and known in particular for his depictions of scenes from the "Passion of Christ".   The various episodes of the Passion, between the arrest and the crucifixion of Christ, as recounted in the Gospels (Matthew 27, Luke 22, Mark 15, John 19), were increasingly subject to representation in the Arts towards the end of the Middle Ages, in tandem with the growing popularity of the staging of theatrical mystery plays.

[[File:Sépulcre Ligier Richier 301008 02.jpg|thumb|centre|700px|Ligier Richier's "Mise au Tombeau" in the church of Saint-Étienne, [[Saint-Mihiel]], [[France]]. depicts Christ before he is placed in the tomb.]]

==The works of Ligier Richier==

===Ligier Richier. Background===

Perhaps more than any other French artist of his period, Ligier Richier, the Lorraine sculptor, produced some notable works linked to the "Passion" ; a mixture of calvaries, pietàs and what is known as a "mise au tombeau" (a depiction of the entombment).

Some researchers state that Richier was born in Dragonville near [[Commercy]],  but there is also evidence that he was born in [[Saint-Mihiel]]&lt;ref&gt;Henri Lepage published a paper in 1854 and quoted a letter discovered in the [[Meurthe-et-Moselle]] archives written by Antoine, the Duke of Lorraine and dated 18 August 1530, which indicated Richier's birthplace as Saint-Mihiel.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PD/&gt;  The people of Saint-Mihiel and its immediate neighbourhood are known as "Sammiellois".  It is not clear when Richier was born.

Richier executed calvaries for the parish church in [[Briey]] and for Saint-Étienne's church in [[Bar-le-Duc]], the famous "mise au tombeau" for the Saint-Mihiel church of Saint-Étienne, a pietà for a church in [[Étain, France|Étain]], and a depiction of the [[Virgin Mary]] fainting for Saint-Michel's church in Saint-Mihiel and was responsible for other works in neighbouring villages and towns in Lorraine.  He also executed some funerary statues including the statue on the [[Cadaver Tomb of René of Chalon|tomb of René de Chalon]], the Prince of Orange, killed in 1544 at the [[Battle of Saint-Dizier]], located in the church of Saint-Étienne in Bar-le-Duc, this a macabre exercise in "écorché".&lt;ref&gt;
An "écorché" is a figure drawn, painted, or sculpted showing the muscles of the body without skin&lt;/ref&gt;

He also executed a sculpture for the tomb of Philippa de Gueldres, the widow of Duke René II of Lorraine in [[Pont-à-Mousson]] where she died in 1547.&lt;ref&gt;Information from Marie-France Jacops conservateur en chef du patrimoine à la DRAC de Lorraine (service régional de l'Inventaire)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.gouv.fr/culture/actualites/celebrations2000/richier.htm Background on Richier] French Government Website.  "Culture" (www.culture.gouv.fr). Retrieved 11 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1530 onwards Richier worked under the protection of Duke Antoine of Lorraine, for whom he did important work.  Although he also worked in wood, he preferred the soft [[limestone]] available from quarries around Saint-Mihiel and Sorcy and by developing new polishing techniques he was able to give the limestone a marble-like appearance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meusetourism.com/en/591/pages/d/the-duchies-of-bar-and-lorraine/ligier-richier-sculptor-of-the-renaissance/page/0 Richier's preference for limestone] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313044226/http://www.meusetourism.com/en/591/pages/d/the-duchies-of-bar-and-lorraine/ligier-richier-sculptor-of-the-renaissance/page/0 |date=13 March 2012 }} Meuse Tourism website. retrieved 28 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Little is known of Ligier Richier's personal life, Paul Denis writes {{Quotation|" Nous possédons sur Claus Sluter, Michel Colombe, Jean Fouquet, Jean Goujon et quelques autres, des textes qui permettent de reconstituer tout au moins les grandes lignes de leur carrière et qui nous fournissent des renseignements positifs sur bon nombre de leurs travaux; nous n'avons, sur Ligier Richier, que fort peu de documents de ce genre, tient en quelques pages et l'homme de génie dont nous voulons tenter de reconstituer l'oeuvre paraît appartenir bien plus à la légende qu'à l'histoire. Ce que les archives et les papiers publics nous ont transmis à son sujet".&lt;ref name=PD/&gt;}}  In 1560, with the other family members living in Saint-Mihiel, he petitioned the Duke of Lorraine to allow him to practice in the reformed Protestant religion.  His petition was apparently unsuccessful and in 1564 he joined his daughter Bernadine in Geneva, Switzerland where he was free to follow this religion.  She had married Pierre Godart, another Protestant who left Lorraine because of his religious beliefs. Richier remained in Geneva until his death in 1567.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museeprotestant.org/Pages/Notices.php?scatid=29&amp;noticeid=230&amp;lev=1&amp;Lget=EN Ligier Richier (c.1500-1567) Richier's move to Geneva]  www.museeprotestant.org.  Retrieved 29 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as little is known of Richier's personal life, as a consequence of the scarcity of records available, the attribution of works to him faces the same constraints and often relies on the scholarship of people such as Paul Denis, particularly his thesis  "l’artiste et son œuvre" published in Paris and Nancy in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/ligierrichierlar00deniuoft/ligierrichierlar00deniuoft_djvu.txt Paul Denis' book ]. www.archive.org. Retrieved 28 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; A good example of the scarcity of information available is the extent to which researchers have relied on the writing of the Troyes pilgrim Chatourop, recorded through the writings of dom Calmet, for information on the works at Notre Dame in Bar-le-Duc and Saint Pierre in Saint Mihiel.

One fact that Paul Denis does reject and emphatically so, is that Ligier Richier travelled to Italy and had contact with [[Michelangelo]].  He wrote "Le voyage de Ligier Richier en Italie est une de ces fables sans fondements qu'il faut résolument rejeter".&lt;ref name=PD/&gt;

|-
|This work by Ligier Richier is located in the Église collégiale de Saint-Maur (St Martin) and is generally thought to have been carved in 1523. It is the earliest work that has been attributed to Ligier Richier.

Hattonchâtel is a village in the canton of [[Vigneulles]], 18 kilometres from Saint-Mihiel and is situated at the top of one of the range of hills which run from [[Verdun]] to [[Toul]] and separate the valley of the [[Meuse]] from the Woëvre plain.  The village took its name from a castle built in the 9th century by Hatton, the Bishop of Verdun at the time.

Richier's [[retable]] or [[altarpiece]] is divided into three distinct sections or niches which are separated by four upright pillars. The central section is constructed to form an arch and is higher than the sections to the right and left.  Within each of these three niches, Richier has carved compositions in high relief whilst the pillars, arch and the rest of the retable feature elaborate carvings and embellishments which include the tools of the architect and the sculptor; a ruler and a compass and a hammer and chisel. The three high reliefs depict three episodes from the Passion.&lt;ref name=PD/&gt;

The first of these episodes is a scene showing Christ carrying the Cross on his way to [[Calvary]] or [[Golgotha]].&lt;ref&gt;In Hebrew-"place of a skull"&lt;/ref&gt;  Christ is shown in the centre of the composition dressed in a long flowing robe and weakened by the flogging from one of the "executioners", whose task was to perform the crucifixion, and the suffering of the previous hours with the [[flagellation]] he had endured, he is unable to bear the heavy weight of the cross and has fallen to the ground. His face is etched with anxiety and "une intraduisible expression de souffrance résignée".&lt;ref name=PD/&gt;   In the scene and just behind Christ, Richier depicts the figure of Simon the Cyrenian, who will soon be coerced into helping Jesus to support the Cross.  Three women are shown on the left of the scene, including Veronica who looks adoringly at Christ's image on her veil.&lt;ref&gt;when Veronica encountered Jesus struggling to carry the Cross she paused to wipe the blood and sweat (Latin ''suda'') off his face with her veil and then found his image had become imprinted on the cloth. The event is commemorated by the Sixth Station of the Stations of the Cross&lt;/ref&gt; Two executioners complete the scene, one of whom is raising a stick and is about to beat Jesus with it, urging him to stand up and move forward, whilst the other appears to partially support the Cross but is no doubt telling Jesus to get on his feet.

In the central niche is a depiction of the crucifixion itself and to the left of his composition, Richier includes a scene much favoured at the time by gothic "imagiers"; the Virgin Mary having a fainting fit, overcome by emotion, and needing physical support from St John (the "Pâmoison" or "Spasimo"). Elsewhere in what is a complex composition, Richier includes three men on horseback, [[Mary Magdalene]] and a man holding a pole at the end of which is a sponge. One of the horsemen has just pierced Jesus' side with his lance and Jesus' blood has splashed onto him and another holds a banner on which is written "Vere hic homo filius Dei erat" ("here is a man who is truly the son of God").

In the third scene we see Jesus being attended to by various people after he has been taken down from the Cross. He is shown lying on the ground and supported by the Virgin Mary and St. John. Mary Magdalene and another woman are present, and to the rear Richier includes a bishop who holds a heavy cross in his left hand whilst a priest kneels at his feet (see below for the probable identity of the bishop and priest),

The dimensions of the piece are 2.60 metres in length and 1.60 metres in height. The central niche is 0.88 metres wide by 1.20 metres in height and the other niches measure 0.64 metres by 0.70 metres.

Along the base of the altarpiece is the inscription taken from St Peter.{{Quotation|"XPS (Christus) PASSUS EST PRO NOBIS. OBIS RELINQUENS EXEMPLUM VT SEQUAMINI VESTIGIA EIVS"|}}

At the base of each pillar is the date "L'AN. 1000. 500. 23".&lt;ref name=PD&gt;"Ligier Richier L'Artiste et Son Oeuvre" by Paul Denis. Published in Paris in 1911&lt;/ref&gt;

Interesting to note that during the 1914-1918 war, the German Army transferred the retable to the "Chapelle des Templiers" in [[Metz]].  This was after a bomb had fallen on the church although the retable was not damaged. No doubt the Germans were anxious to avoid the retable being damaged should the church have been hit again.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.gouv.fr/public/mistral/palissy_fr?ACTION=RETROUVER&amp;FIELD_98=AUTR&amp;VALUE_98=Richier%20Ligier%20&amp;NUMBER=30&amp;GRP=0&amp;REQ=%28%28Richier%20Ligier%29%20%3aAUTR%20%29&amp;USRNAME=nobody&amp;USRPWD=4%24%2534P&amp;SPEC=3&amp;SYN=1&amp;IMLY=&amp;MAX1=1&amp;MAX2=200&amp;MAX3=200&amp;DOM=Tous Altar-piece in Vigneulles-lès-Hattonchâtel] French Government Website "Culture".

[[File:Retable Hattonchatel.jpg|thumb|centre|450px|The central part of the Hattonchâtel altarpiece]]

To conclude it is worthwhile giving some of the text of a brochure issued by the Meuse Tourist Board in which they describe the work {{Quotation|"There has been considerable discussion as to whether Ligier Richier himself produced the Hattonchâtel Retable which is one of the most refined Renaissance works in Lorraine, but his influence is beyond doubt.  The date, LAN 1000 500 23, and a verse from the First Epistle to Saint Peter, are carved in fine Roman capitals on the base of the pilasters framing and separating the three panels forming the Retable.  A shield bears the donor’s coat of arms and his initials, G.R. for Gaucher Richeret, Dean of the Chapter of Hattonchâtel.  Richeret is shown in the third panel, kneeling at the feet of Saint-Maur, Bishop of Verdun. The Retable consists of three scenes from Christ’s Passion, Christ bearing the Cross, the Crucifixion, and the Lamentation.  The clearly Italianate architectural frame, recalling the Duke René’s Tomb in Nancy, finished around 1510, has pilasters with candelabra, scrolled capitals, ornamental foliage and bucrania, all of which had become part of Lorraine art by that time. To these should be added the individual techniques used by the sculptor, the architect and the stonemasons. The central part of the retable, with its tympanum in the form of a large shell, houses Christ on the Cross under a surbased decorated arch. The central shield bears the Duke of Lorraine’s arms; he often stayed in Hattonchatel and may have remarked the sculptor's talent.  A number of superb details are of particular interest, such as the vertical hang of Saint Veronica's coat and the look of curiosity and bewilderment on the face of the Saint as she leans forward.  The central panel presents several scenes ambitiously organised on three or four planes: the sculptor deliberately chose a complex approach with the deliberate juxtaposition of clothed and naked bodies, of people and animals, the foreshortening of the whinnying horse, preparing to bite"|}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdt55.tourinsoft.com/Upload/MEDIA_72cca896-c7bf-4016-b173-6f1d8336679d.pdf Text of brochure published by the Meuse Tourist Board.] Meuse Tourist Board.

==The Calvary at [[Génicourt]]==

This is considered to be Richier's first Calvary and Paul Denis wrote {{Quotation|"Parmi le groupe assez important des calvaires pouvant être rattachés à l'atelier, celui de Génicourt nous paraît devoir être regardé comme le premier en date. La très intéressante église de ce village, situé à mi-chemin entre Saint-Mihiel et Verdun, renferme en effet un Christ en croix et deux statues de bois polychrome, la Vierge et saint Jean"|}}&lt;ref name=PD/&gt;

The Génicourt work is thought to have been executed shortly after the retable at Hattonchâtel. The work is in polychromed wood and comprises a depiction of Jesus Christ on the Cross with the two robbers on either side and depictions of the Virgin Mary and St John.  Originally all the works were located by the church's sanctuary but are not currently kept together but located in various positions around the church.&lt;ref name=PD/&gt; Interesting to read Paul Denis on the subject of the location of such a work in relation to [[liturgical]] rules-{{Quotation|"Ces statues, placées sur le tref, pièce de bois horizontale posée en travers et à peu près à mi-hautcur de la grande arcade du sanctuaire ('), formaient jadis un groupe complet, dont les régies liturgiques prescrivaient l'érection à cet endroit. Il offrait aux méditations des fidèles, sous une forme sensible et matérielle, l'image du sacrifice sanglant du Calvaire, dont le sacrifice de la messe, célébré sous leurs yeux, n'est, d'après le dogme catholique, que le renouvellement et la continuation journalière. Chaque église autrefois avait un tref de ce genre"|}}&lt;ref name=PD/&gt;

Génicourt is located in the canton and arrondissement of [[Verdun]] in the Meuse.  The brochure issued by the Meuse Tourist Office on the Génicourt work is interesting and concentrates on the statue of the Virgin Mary. They write {{Quotation|"Everything in the beautiful church in Génicourt-sur-Meuse, the architecture, the furnishings, the stained glass, and all the painted decor.....give a very accurate idea of a rich parish church at the time of Ligier Richier"|}}.They also add {{Quotation|"For many years considered to be a work by the young Richier, the Génicourt Calvary is now attributed to a "Master of Génicourt", probably close to Richier, a sculptor of his generation and possibly familiar with the work of his workshop, but with lesser skills and aesthetic mastery|"}}

Despite the Tourist Board's comments the consensus of researcher's opinions seems to be that this is a Richier work.

The brochure continues {{Quotation|"...it is perhaps more significant to note the sense of tension and pathos, the way in which the Virgin's tapering fingers are intertwined making them as expressive as Her face; this is no longer popular art.  Her mouth suggests a gentle movement similar to that to be seen on the Holy Woman in Clermont-en-Argonne and Mary Magdalene in Briey."|}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tourisme-meuse.com/Upload/Mediatheque/patrimoine/site-remarquable/LigierRichier-FR.pdf. la Route Ligier Richier] la Route Ligier Richier. Meuse Tourist Office. Retrieved 15 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The brochure also includes a quotation from Bernard Noël {{Quotation|"The Lady of Génicourt does not play a role defined by convention.  She is just an ordinary woman who is deeply distressed."|}}

When dealing with the depiction of Christ, Paul Denis draws attention to the similarities with the works at Hattonchâtel, Briey and Bar-le-Duc.&lt;ref name=PD/&gt;{{Quotation|"Il offre des affinités incontestables avec celui que nous avons vu au centre de la scène principale du retable d'Hattonchâtel et ceux que nous rencontrerons par la suite à Bar-le-Duc,à Briey et ailleurs encore."|}}

Paul Denis also notes that Jesus' Cross in the Génicourt Calvary has a large "titulus" attached to it and that the inclusion of this "titulus" was unusual for Richier's work.&lt;ref&gt;The "titulus" is a plaque attached to the top of the Cross and upon which were engraved the letters "I.N.R.I".&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
|The [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] church of Saint-Gengoult in Briey dates back to the beginning of the 12th century and holds a Ligier Richier calvary with life size depictions of Christ on the Cross, with the two robbers on either side.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ville-briey.fr/site/_english_patrimony.php Briey] Briey's website. Retrieved 17 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The Briey composition features Jesus on the central cross with the good sinner on one side and the bad sinner on the other.  Richier adds to his composition the figures of the Virgin Mary, Mary Magdalene and St John. The work is thought to date to 1534 and was originally made by Richier for the [[Oratory (worship)|Oratory]] of Jean Milet which was located in the old Briey cemetery.  Jean Milet was a native of Briey and the vicar of La Chaussée.

|There is evidence that there was at one time a sculptured group by Richier in the church, this group comprising not only Jesus on the Cross but also the Virgin Mary, St John and St.[[Saint Longinus|Longinus]] but only the figure of Jesus on the Cross remains today.

It was in 1532 that Nicolas Chatourop, a citizen of [[Troyes]], made a pilgrimage to the famous Lorraine sanctuary called "Saint-Nicolas-de-Port" and on his return to Troyes he wrote an account of his journey and his observations of some of the religious works which he saw and these writings are a valuable resource for those studying the works of Richier and his contemporaries.  Chatourop's observations were used by dom Calmet in his Richier biography and two hundred years later were to be used by the Troyes scholar Grosley in his writings.

It was when travelling from Troyes to Saint-Nicolas that Chatourop visited Bar-le-Duc and one of the churches there, Notre-Dame. This church had been the only parish church in Bar-le-Duc until 1688 and it was linked to a benédictine priory founded in 1088 by Princess Sophie and given by her to the [[Saint Mihiel Abbey|Saint-Mihiel Abbey]]. Chatourop wrote about a work which had caught his attention and he considered of great beauty by {{Quotation|"M.Légier, tailleur d'images, le plus expert et meilleur ouvrier en dict art que l'on vit jamais"|}}and wrote of the beautiful crucifix which he had seen in the parish of Notre-Dame in Bar-le-Duc this accompanied by St John supporting the Virgin Mary and Saint Longinus&lt;ref&gt;Saint Longinus is the centurion who pierced the side of Our Lord while He was hanging on the Cross.  Saint Longinus, who was nearly blind, was healed when some of the blood and water from Jesus fell into his eyes. It was then he exclaimed "Indeed, this was the Son of God!" [Mark 15:39]. St. Longinus then converted, left the army, took instruction from the apostles and became a monk in Cappadocia. There he was arrested for his faith, his teeth forced out and tongue cut off. However, St. Longinus miraculously continued to speak clearly and managed to destroy several idols in the presence of the governor. The governor, who was made blind by the demons that came from the idols, had his sight restored when St. Longinus was being beheaded, because his blood came in contact with the governors' eyes. St. Longinus' relics are now in the church of St Augustine, in Rome. His lance is contained in one of the four pillars over the altar in the Basilica of St Peter's in Rome.

|This work is also in Saint-Mihiel and in the Abbey Church there (the abbaye de bénédictins Saint-Michel). As we see in the photograph of the work shown above,  St John is shown supporting the Virgin Mary who appears to have passed out, overwhelmed by grief. Scholars consider this to be what is left of a Calvary group of nine figures which was executed in the 1530s. It seems that Chatourop, the Troyes merchant mentioned in the section on Bar-le-Duc, passed by Saint-Mihiel after leaving Bar-le-Duc and paid a visit to the Abbey Church.  Here he wrote of having seen several works of sculpture by Ligier but he did not give a full description of these works.

In the vastness of the Saint-Mihiel Abbey Paul Denis writes how ones attention is drawn to the composition of what is known as the "swooning virgin" ("La Pâmoison" in French).

Records show that until 1720 the entire group remained in the chapels of the Abbey Church at which time the resident monks decided to transform the chapels and the statues were dispersed or lost with the exception of the depiction of Christ on His Cross which was kept in the refractory and the "swooning Virgin Mary" which remained on the church premises.

Events took a dramatic turn during the [[French Revolution]] in 1792,  when the [[crucifix]] was taken from the church by the mob and burnt along with other works of art. It seems that the next morning a local woman passed the embers of the fire and found in the ashes the head of Jesus which had survived the fire and was more or less intact.  She took it home where it stayed for many years.  It was subsequently discovered in a granary and came to the notice of a Vaucoulers sculptor called Pierson who made a model of it and produced several replicas one of which was acquired by the Musée de Nancy.

Thus all that remains of what Chatourop had so admired when visiting Saint Mihiel, is the "Pâmoison" and Pierson's models of Jesus' head plus the actual head retrieved from the fire.

The carving is incidentally from [[walnut]] and would originally have had a polychrome finish but this has worn away.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.gouv.fr/public/mistral/palissy_fr?ACTION=RETROUVER&amp;FIELD_8=REF%2cREFA&amp;VALUE_8=IA55000106&amp;NUMBER=42&amp;GRP=0&amp;REQ=%28%28IA55000106%29%20%3aREF%2cREFA%20%29&amp;USRNAME=nobody&amp;USRPWD=4%24%2534P&amp;SPEC=9&amp;SYN=1&amp;IMLY=&amp;MAX1=1&amp;MAX2=200&amp;MAX3=200&amp;DOM=Tous The Swooning Virgin] French Government Website "Culture".

|There are two works in the church of St Ėtienne in Bar-le-Duc which are attributed to Richier.  One is a Calvary depicting the crucifixion of Jesus Christ and the two robbers. The Calvary is thought to have been carved in about 1532. See photograph above and note the agonized expression on the faces of the robbers and their contorted bodies, these in contrast to the calmness which seems to emanate from Christ himself. Saint Ėtienne's church was the former Collegiate Church of St Pierre.  The church has stained-glass by Maréchal de Metz and Champigneulle.  In France of course St Ėtienne equates to St Stephen&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museeprotestant.org/Pages/Notices.php?scatid=29&amp;noticeid=230&amp;lev=1&amp;Lget=EN Calvary at St Stephen's Church in Bar-le-Duc] Website of Museum of French Protestantism. Retrieved 11 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The church of Saint-Étienne, also known as the church of Saint-Pierre, is located in a part of Bar-le-Duc known as "Ville-Haute".  In describing Richier's composition,  Paul Denis expresses the view that the "good robber", which follows convention and is placed to the right of Jesus Christ,  shows a certain hope as though he has accepted Christ's pardon ("il rend en paix son denier soupir") whereas the "bad robber" exudes sadness and despair and his body is contorted into an almost impossible shape.  It seems unlikely that he will find peace in death.  This work was carved from walnut and then painted.  Denis also believes the depiction of Christ and the two robbers are what remains of a much larger work, perhaps including the Virgin Mary, St John and Mary Magdalene but these have not been traced and Paul suspects that they went missing during the chaotic times of the French Revolution.&lt;ref name=PD/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mémoire sur ce que la France a de plus curieux by Brouilly&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pouillc du diocèse de Verdun by l'abbé Cillant&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul also notes that the crosses of the good and bad robber were of a "T" shape and that the robbers were fixed to the crosses by rope rather than their being nailed.  Paul states that this was the way the robbers were portrayed in ancient Christian art.&lt;ref name=PD/&gt;

==The "Chapelle des Princes" in Bar-le-Duc==

Although this chapel and the Saint Maxe Collegiate Church of which this was a part, were demolished many years ago, the pieces of Richier sculpture that were in the chapel are currently either in the library of the Société de L'histoire du Protestantisme Finançais or the [[Louvre]].

===The Collegiate Church of Saint-Maxe in Bar-le-Duc===

Not far from the Church of St Ḗtienne, in the so-called "Haut Ville" district of Bar-le-Duc, there was an even older church, dedicated to Saint Maxe and this served the old feudal fortress which stood in Bar-le-Duc and was the residence of the Counts of Bar. This church's structure was changed on many occasions and it was Gilles de Trêves who built a sumptuous chapel in the church and called it the "Chapelle des Princes".&lt;ref name=PD/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michel de Montaigne visited the chapel in 1580 and wrote of "La plus somptueuse chapelle de marbre, de peintures et d'ornements qui soit en France; de la plus belle structure, la mieux composée, étoffée, et la plus labourée d'ouvrages et d'enrichissements et la plus logeable"- Michel de Montaigne, Voyage en France. Paris, Le Jay, 1774, cité par Cournault p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several reliable sources have written that the "Chapelle des Princes" contained a retable by Ligier Richier. [[Nicolas Luton Durival]],  for example, the Lorraine historian, wrote stating that the chapel included work by Richier {{Quotation|"La Chapelle collatérale des Princes ou de Gilles, de Trêves doyen de Saint-Maxe, est très ornée de sculpture et d'architecture. Le plafond en voûte est enrichi de compartiments, de couronnes et de roses en culs-de-lampe dorés; les fonds peints d'azur.Le dessous des arcades que forment les deux entrées de la chapelle, est aussi décore de roses et de mascarons. Le retable d'autel est d'ordre dorique : ce qui en fliit la beauté est une Annonciation en relief attachée à un fond d'architecture de bas-relief: sur le piédestal, l'année et le nom de l'artiste: Ligier Richihr 1554. Sur la corniche du retable deux figures debout représentant des prophètes, et sur le frontispice,  Christ, la Vierge et saint Jean aux côtés. Huit figures, représentant les huit Pères de l'Église, grecque et latine, sont sur la première corniche qui règne autour de cette chapelle. L'artiste a représenté la Naissance de Jésus-Christ sur la croisée rès de l'auteL Sur l'autre croisée est la figure de Gilles de Trêves, à genoux devant un prie-dieu. Toutes ces figures paraissent de même main et dignes de Ligier Richier. Elles sont de pierre, polie et luisante comme le marbre". Nicolas-Luton Durival|}}.&lt;ref name=PD/&gt; The retable included a bas-relief depicting the "Annunciation" and this had "Ligier Richier 1554" inscribed. There were also carvings of two of the prophets as well as Jesus Christ, the Virgin Mary and St John.  There were also depictions of the "Fathers of the Church", Greek and Latin and a "Nativity" as well as a depiction of Gilles de Treves ("a genoux devant un prie-dieu"). Durival wrote "Toutes les figures paraissent de meme main et dignes de Ligier Richier."

It was by a Royal ordnance issued in March 1782 that the announcement was made that the Chapter of Saint-Maxe was to be united with that of Saint-Pierre and by the end of August the collegiate was completely abandoned. The remains of the princes of the House of Lorraine buried in the Saint-Maxe nave were moved to Saint-Pierre as were several works of funereal statuary. On 31 December 1790 Saint-Maxe was officially announced as closed by a decree issued by the authorities in Bar-le-Duc and on 2 August 1792 another decree ordered that it be sold and demolished. The various works of art were lodged in a local warehouse "pour être utilisés plus tard".  There is evidence that these works of art were not looked after properly, especially in the chaotic days of the revolution.

Durival wrote that as part of the Saint Maxe altarpiece or retable, Richier had included a carving of Christ on the Cross together with the Virgin Mary and St John and that all that was left of this was a rather mutilated head which was now kept by the "Bibliothèque de la Société de l'histoire du protestantisme finançais".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museeprotestant.org/Pages/Notices.php?scatid=29&amp;noticeid=230&amp;lev=1&amp;Lget=EN Bibliothèque de la Société de l'histoire du protestantisme finançais] Protestant Museum website. Retrieved 22 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Denis inspected this head, known as the "Christ mourant" at the library involved- "34, rue des Saints-Pères, Paris. Nous sommes heureux de remercier ici M. N. Weiss, conservateur de cet établissement, à l'obligeance duquel nous devons d'avoir pu étudier et photographier ce débris d'une des plus belles oeuvres de Richier",&lt;ref name=PD/&gt; This work is 0.13 metres in height.

Experts have also concluded that the sculpture of the head of Saint Jérôme and the composition "L'Enfant à la crèche", now in the Louvre, were also originally in Saint-Maxe. See section on the Louvre below.

Paul Denis identifies one final Richier work which came from Saint Maxe and that was the remains of a stone plinth just 0.35 metres long. This included an inscription in clear roman letters reading "LIGIER RICHIER F".  The lettering was broken off at the letter "F" but Denis thinks this would have read "Fecit".  This is just further evidence of Richier having completed works for Saint Maxe.  This fragment is in the collection of the Musée de Bar-le-Duc and there is a model of it in the Musée de Saint Mihiel.

==Miscellaneous works==

==="Plafond  à caissons" (Coffers or ornamental sunken ceiling panels)===

These were traced to a house inhabited at one time by Richier at 7 rue Haute-des-Fosses in Saint Mihiel.&lt;ref name=PD/&gt;

===Lintel for a mantelpiece===

This [[Lintel]]  originally came from the house in Saint Mihiel in which Richier had at one time lived.  The carving from two pieces of stone,  recreates across the top of the fireplace, a rich [[damask]] curtain complete with folds and decorations.  It is a masterpiece and made a great impression on dom Calmet when he saw it.&lt;ref name=PD/&gt;

The work is 2 metres in length and 50 centimetres high. It was purchased in 1761 by Monsieur Baudelaire who was the prior of the Abbey of Saint-Mihiel and subsequently moved to the presbytery at Han sur Meuse. During the Great War, 1914-1918, the village and presbytery were badly damaged by German artillery fire but Richier's mantelpiece fitting survived undamaged and was later installed above a fireplace in the local Mairie. It was classified as an historic monument in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansurmeuse.e-monsite.com/pages/l-histoire-de-han-sur-meuse/cheminee-de-ligier-richier.html Mantelpiece fitting]  Retrieved 26 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

|The church of Saint-Didier dates back to the 16th century. Building commenced in 1530 and the church was finally consecrated on 16 June 1577 by the Bishop of Verdun, Nicolas Bousmard. It has been touched by history on many occasions; in the 1654 siege it was transformed into a fortress,  after the "[[Fronde]]" it took 20 years to repair the damage and during the "Révolution" it was desecrated. Finally on 5 September 1914,  it was set ablaze by German soldiers from Würtenburg and had no roof for the duration of the Great War. Rebuilding took place between 1919 and 1939. The building has many interesting fittings and furnishings and in the chapel of  "Saint Roch" there is a "mise au tombeau". This includes depictions of six people but they are all from different periods and by different carvers. They came from St Anne's Chapel in Clermont Castle where they had been for many years. One of the statues is attributed to Richier and this is known as "The Holy Woman in a Peasant's Bonnet".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tourisme-argonne.fr/eglise-de-clermont-en-argonne.php Eglise St Didier - Clermont en Argonne] Argonne Tourist Board.

In their brochure "La Route Ligier Richier", the Meuse Tourist Board write "The outstanding recumbent figure of Christ is pre-16th century and the two kneeling angels in wood are 17th century.  The Holy Woman in a Peasant's Bonnet is clearly superior to the other figures in the quality of its execution and in its significantly more expressive plasticity."

==Oeuvres Funéraires (Funerary works)==

[[File:CORD-Gisant Philippe Gueldre.jpg|thumb|centre|650px|The tomb of Philippe de Gueldres.  One of Ligier Richier's Oeuvres Funéraires]]

===The tomb of Philippe de Gueldres in the Église des Cordeliers in Nancy===

Richier executed the carving on the tomb of Philippe de Gueldres in this church.  This work in limestone is an excellent example of how Richier was able to polish it and produce a marble effect. [[Philippa of Guelders|Philippe de Gueldres]] was born in Grave in Brabant on 9 November 1467 and died at Pont-à-Mousson in the Clarisses convent on 28 February 1547.  She was the daughter of Adolphe de Gueldres and Catherine de Bourbon and the second wife of René II of Lorraine, who died in 1547.

It was when Rene II died that she retired to the Clarrises convent.  In Richier's work he depicts Philippe in the dress of a Clarrises nun.

At the feet of Phillipe, Richier adds a small figurine of another Clarrises nun who is depicted on her knees and also dressed in the Clarisses habit. She holds the "ducal crown" in her hands. The work is 1.92 metres long. It came originally from the chapel of the monastery of the Clarisses in Pont-à-Mousson and is now held in the "des Cordeliers" church. There is a replica in the Musée du Trocadero.&lt;ref name=PD/&gt;

The monastery of the Clarisses in Pont-à-Mousson was seized in the 1792 revolution and then sold and most of it demolished.  The tomb of Philippe de Gueldres was violated and the bones dispersed.  Other works from the monastery were despatched to Nancy and some ended up in the parish church of Saint-Laurent.  The Philippe de Gueldres work is said to have been hidden in the monastery garden.  It was subsequently discovered and passed through various hands, none of whom realized its value. In 1822 it was discovered by a Doctor Lamoureux who recognized its importance and taken to Nancy and is now located in the old church of the Cordeliers monastery there.&lt;ref name=PD/&gt;

acception du XIIe siècle, "transi de vie", c'est-à-dire "trépassé". Apparu au XIVe siècle où guerres, épidémies de peste et
famines fauchent la moitié de la population européenne, le phénomène du transi marque une cassure dans l'art
funéraire du Moyen-Âge. Plus de sourires, de heaumes, ni de hennins ; l'horreur des vers et des crapauds les
remplacent. Dans ce même mouvement apparaissent des ouvrages sur l'Art de mourir (Ars moriendi), et, dans les
fresques et les enluminures, des Danses macabres, ou "dits des trois morts et des trois vifs" qui représentent trois
jeunes hommes dansant avec trois squelettes. Il existe de nombreuses théories sur cette évolution. D'une
part, on peut y voir l'indication d'une crise morale. D'autre part, une horreur de la mort et donc une célébration de "la vie pleine" : la décomposition est révélatrice d'une maladie qui dévore ses victimes et permet d'exhorter les passants à faire preuve d'humilité "car tu seras bientôt comme moi, un cadavre hideux, pâture des vers." http://perso.univ-lyon2.fr/~mollon/L3-LHA/fiches_doc/Transi.pdf.

[[File:Bar-le-Duc - Eglise Saint-Etienne - Le Transi -192.jpg|thumb|centre|350px| "Death as a skeleton" in St Ėtienne Church Bar-le-Duc]]
|In the section above dealing with the calvary we have made reference to Richier's work in the church of St Ėtienne in Bar-le-Duc.  There is a second Richier work is this Bar-le-Duc church, a work known as the "Transi" as shown in the photograph above.  It is a macabre work and an example of écorché.&lt;ref&gt;An écorché is a figure drawn, painted, or sculpted showing the muscles of the body without skin. The term écorché, meaning literally "flayed", came into usage via the French Academies (such as the École des Beaux Arts) in the 19th century.&lt;/ref&gt;
This sculpture was originally housed in the collegiate church of Saint-Maxe in Bar-le-Duc, which was abandoned in 1782.

This work, also known as the "Death as a skeleton" or the "Squelette de Bar"  is a memorial to Renė de Chalon, the brother-in-law of Duke Antoine of Lorraine. There is a cast of the work in the Musée barrois in Bar-le-Duc. The Meuse tourist office have produced a brochure covering the two works which opens with words by Bernard Noël, the French writer and poet {{Quotation|"The spectator today, who so frequently hears of people being tortured to death and of death without salvation, can see this "Death as a skeleton" as a ghost that may well come back to haunt us, but what symbolism should be attributed to the heart?” |}}

The brochure then explains that Gilles de Trèves, the Dean of Saint-Maxe’s Collegiate Church, had invited Ligier Richier to visit Bar in around 1540-1549 and to undertake extensive decorative work in the Chapel of the Princes.  The work was completed in 1554. The brochure explains that [[Michel de Montaigne]], who stayed in Bar in 1580, much admired the architecture and sculpture in polished stone and terra cotta, which must have been impressive at the time, but of which only a few fragments remain.  Saint-Maxe’s Collegiate Church was demolished during the French Revolution and what was left of Ligier’s work is now in Saint Etienne’s Church. Around 1550, Richier sculpted one of the most famous funerary monuments of the French Renaissance, "Death of a Skeleton".  The brochure explains that the work is a memorial to the heart of René de Chalon, the Duke Antoine of Lorraine’s brother-in-law. The figure holds de Chalon's heart up to heaven whilst the other hand rests on its chest. On the Calvary the brochure reads "Prior to Ligier Richier, many of Lorraine sculptors’ workshops had already produced versions of the bloodier aspects of Christ’s Passion, a popular religious theme in Lorraine at the time".  The work is 1.75 metres high.

Originally this work was located in the collegiate church of St Maxe and was placed over a burial vault which held the hearts of Duke Antoine de Lorraine, René de Chalon and other family members.&lt;ref name=PD/&gt; According to Paul Denis the work was moved from St Maxe in June 1790.&lt;ref&gt;"Longtemps après la fusion des deux collégiales, au mois de juin 1790, le monument fut transporté dans l'église Saint-Pierre, riche déjà du Christ et des deux larrons attribués également à notre sculpteur".Paul Denis.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1810 the vicar of Saint-Étienne, Claude Rollet, issued a paper giving a full description of the work and in 1894 a model was made for the Musée de sculpture du Trocadéro. In 1898 the statue was classified as a "monument historique". Interesting to note that during the Great War 1914-1918,  the "Squelette" was moved to Paris for its protection and deposited in the cellars of the [[Panthéon]] until the end of the war.  It was returned to the church in 1920.  It was restored in 1969 by Maxime Chiquet d’Alliancelles.  In 1993 the retable and the tomb itself were also classified as historic monuments and were also restored.&lt;ref&gt;[http://caoa55.free.fr/chap5/SqueletteBlD/actualite_squeletteBlD.htm Details of restoration of Le Squelette]  Retrieved 26 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recumbent effiges for the tombs of René de Beauvau and Claude de Baudoche===

These works by Richier were originally in the old parish church of Noviant-aux-Prés in the canton of Domêvre-en-Haye in the arrondissement of Toul. In 1866 they were taken to the Musée Lorraine in Nancy and are now held in the Église des Cordeliers.&lt;ref name=PD/&gt;

Richier follows the traditions of the Middle Ages in his composition with the two recumbent effiges lying side by side, hands clasped together in prayer with their heads resting on a pillow. They are dressed in the sumptuous clothing of the day.  See Paul Denis' work for a full description.&lt;ref&gt;[http://noviant.aux.pres.free.fr/histo/benoit/benoit.htm René de Beauvau and Claude de Baudoche] JOURNAL DE LA SOCIÉTÉ D'ARCHÉOLOGIE ET DU JOURNAL DE LA SOCIÉTÉ D'ARCHÉOLOGIE ET DU COMITÉ DU MUSÉE LORRAIN.

|-
| Saint Mihiel is located by the Meuse and gave its name to a monastery which the mayor of Austrasie had had built on a hill near the town.  This was later moved nearer Saint Mihiel which was originally called Saint-Michel but was corrupted over the years to Saint-Mihiel.&lt;ref name="LePage"/&gt;
The church of St Ėtienne in St Mihiel is a very old one, was destroyed and rebuilt several times and in one of the various excavations necessary when the church was being rebuilt the thirteen statues which make up the St Ėtienne "Mise au Tombeau" or "Sépulcre" were discovered.  These thirteen statues are the depictions of those who placed Jesus Christ in his tomb after the body had been brought down from the Cross.  Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus are shown "portent avec precaution leur precieux fardeau" (carefully carrying their precious package"). They are assisted by Martha and Salomé who have prepared the linen cover for the inside of the tomb. In describing the work,  LePage writes {{Quotation|"Madeleine, à genoux aux pieds du Christ, attire prinicipalement l'attention du visiteur; c'est, je crois, le morceau capital de l'oeuvre. Sous la femme convertie on devine la courtisane.  Sa toilette est riche, sa poitrine opulente, et sous ces grands yeux qui pleurent la mort du Maître on sent une vague reminiscence de la femme d'autrefois; cependant une douleur immense est peinte sur sa figure,   L'artiste a admirablement saisi cette physionomie de Madeleine, qui a toujours tenté les peintres de toutes les époques"|}}&lt;ref name="LePage"/&gt; In Richier's composition Sainte Monique is shown holding the crown of thorns which Jesus' persecutors had placed on his head. John and Mary Cleophas are shown supporting the Virgin Mary who is clearly distraught and overcome with grief.  An angel carrying the Cross looks on, as does the centurion who "contemple d'un oeil étonné cette scène de douleur"&lt;ref name="LePage"/&gt; and two soldiers who roll dice on the top of a drum.  It is said that the winner would have won Jesus' tunic. Scholars believe this to be Richier's final work and it was completed between 1554 and 1564 the year Richier left France to travel to Geneva.  He is thought to have left it to his son Gerard to carry out the installation in the chapel of Saint-Ėtienne church and possibly add some finishing touches to the work. It stands in the south side-aisle.  The figures involved are more than life-size and carved from a fine-grained Meuse limestone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.gouv.fr/lorraine/telecommande/Aun.htm Entombment Saint Mihiel] French Cultural website.

|-
! scope="col" style="width:1000px;"|The pietà at Étain Bon Dieu de Pitié.
|-
|This Richier composition located near the Sacrė-Coeur altar in the Étain parish church is regarded as his first pietà.&lt;ref&gt;It was Saint Bonaventure in his work "Méditations " on the life of Jesus Christ who described in detail the events after Christ had been taken down from the Cross and wrote that the Virgin Mary had taken the body of her son onto her knees looking down on him with love and remorse.&lt;/ref&gt;  Denis Paul points to the influence of Rhenish artists on artists in Lorraine in the way they depicted the pietà and how this would have been taken up by Richier. He gives as examples,  Tilman Riemensschneider's group at the University of Wurzbourg and the compositions by unknown artists at Saint-Jacques in Nuremberg and Notre Dame in Zwickau. As examples, Paul refers to the work in the church at Varangéville attributed to the workshop of Mansuy Gauvain, that at Saint-Nicolas-de-Port and that at the [[basilica]] Saint-Epvre in Nancy.&lt;ref name=PD/&gt; Instead of the conventional depiction of the Virgin Mary being seated with the body of Christ lying across her knees, Richier's Virgin Mary is shown kneeling in front of the body and tenderly lifting His left hand as though to draw attention to the wound in his side.  This was to become known as the style of the "Notre-Dame de Pitié".  Christ is no longer shown in a horizontal position but gradually the position changes to a vertical one.&lt;ref name=PD/&gt;

The work at Étain measures 1.30 metres in length and is 1.10 metres high.  It is thought that the limestone used came from a quarry near to Saint-Mihiel known as "de la Justice". This stone had a tendency to yellow with age and lent itself to work with the sculptor's chisel&lt;ref name=PD/&gt;

The work was originally carved for a tomb in a chapel in the Étain cemetery and was subsequently moved into the church probably around 1773. See section below dealing with the two [[terra cotta]]  figures in Clermont-en-Argonne which are thought to have some link to the Étain work.  It is certainly in the style of what had become known as "Notre-Dame de Pitié". Mary kneels in front of Jesus's body which she is propping up with her right hand. His left hand is held in her right hand.  The date 1530 is inscribed at the base of the work (this puts the work as having been executed 2 years after that at Étain suggesting that it was a maquette for another Richier work, perhaps an attempt to improve on the Étain composition.  It was restored by the sculptor Pierson from Vaucouleurs)&lt;ref name=PD/&gt;

{| class="wikitable sortable"
|-
! scope="col" style="width:1000px;"|Terra cotta figures in Clermont-en-Argonne
|-
|There are two small terra cotta figures in this church with a height of around 0.35 metres which seem to be a study for a larger piece rather than a piece in its own right. In all probability therefore they were intended as a "[[maquette]]" for a second work since lost or never completed.  Paul Denis expresses the view that these two pieces have all the hallmarks of Richier and could have been an early study for the Étain work or a maquette for a new study where Richier wanted to correct any imperfections he saw in the Étain work. However the dated inscribed of 1530 does suggest an association with a second work. Denis states that these two figures came from the old church of Clemont-en-Argonne ( Église de la citadelle)
|-

==Lost works==

According to Paul Denis, Richier executed carvings depicting Duke Antoine and his wife as well as several of their entourage, with maquettes being prepared in 1533. Denis bases this on papers left by Humbert Pierrot in the Meurthe and Moselle archives under reference B.7613.  Sadly these works have been lost.&lt;ref name=PD/&gt;

He also attributes to Richier, two carvings for the tomb of Claude de Lorraine, the Duke of Guise and Antoinette de Bourbon, which were placed in the collegiate church of Saint-Laurent in Joinville in Haute-Marne.  These works have also been lost.&lt;ref name=PD/&gt;

==Miscellaneous notes==

===Monument to Ligier Richier and the sculptors of the Sammielloise (Saint-Mihiel) School===

[[File:Buste de Ligier Richier 8561.JPG|thumb|centre|300px|Statue to Ligier Richier in Saint Mihiel]]

There is a statue erected in the place Ligier Richier in Saint Mihiel dedicated to the work of Ligier Richier and his fellow Saint Mihiel sculptors, as shown in the photograph above.  It involves a [[bronze]] depicting a young man who stands next to a half-pillar on which sits a model of the head of a baby. In his right hand he holds a sculptor's mallet.  The entire composition stands on a pedestal.

It was following a public subscription launched in 1900 that the monument was erected in 1908. The sculptural work on the pedestal was competed by L.Gallant of Saint-Mihiel and the bronze was completed by the foundry of A.Salin in Dammarie sur Saulx based on a model sculpted by Léon Vadel. The bronze was taken by the Germans during the 1914-1918 war and melted down for use in munitions manufacture.  It was replaced in 1933.  This time the foundry of Durenne in Val d'Osne were used but still based the bronze on Vadel's model. The 1900 monument had incidentally replaced one erected in 1836 on the occasion of the three hundredth anniversary of the completion of the Saint Mihiel "mise au tombeau" of which the people of Saint-Mihiel have always been fiercely proud.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.gouv.fr/public/mistral/palsri_fr?ACTION=CHERCHER&amp;FIELD_1=REF&amp;VALUE_1=IM55005888 Statue of Richier] French Cultural website.

===Convent of Clarisses===

The Convent of Clarisses in Pont-à-Mousson was one of 18 such convents established by St Colette of Corbie. Colette joined the Third Order of St. Francis and became a hermit, living in a hut near the parish church, under the spiritual direction of the abbot of the local [[Benedictine]] abbey. In 1406, after four years of this ascetic way of life and as a result of a number of dreams and visions, Colette came to believe that she was being called to reform the Poor Clares, the Second Order of the [[Franciscan]] movement, and return that Order to its original Franciscan ideals of absolute poverty and austerity. In October of that year, she travelled to Nice to seek the blessing of the Antipope Benedict XIII, who was recognized in France at that time as the rightful pope. Benedict received her and allowed her to take vows as a Poor Clare nun, giving her mission his blessing through several papal bulls, which authorized her both to reform existing monasteries and to found new ones according to her ideals. She then spent several years in [[Beaune]] in the Duchy of [[Burgundy]], under the guidance of the Blessed Henry of Beaume and in 1408, she established the first successful community of Poor Clare nuns under her inspired way of life in a semi-derelict monastery of the Order in Besançon. From there, her reform spread to Auxonne (1412), to Poligny (1415) and to [[Amiens]].  It began to spread outside France with foundations in Ghent in Flanders (1442) and Heidelberg, Germany (1444), and from there to other communities of Poor Clares around Europe.  In total, 18 monasteries were founded before her death in March 1447. One of these was that at Pont-à-Mousson.

===L'Imagier===

Sculptors of Ligier Richier's era were known as "Imagiers".&lt;ref name="LePage"&gt;"Ligier Richier" by Auguste Lepage. Published in 1868 by Academies des Bibliophiles. Paris.&lt;/ref&gt;        In medieval French this was written as "yimagier".

===Materials used===

Champagne and Lorraine were rich in the raw materials used by the artists of the period who would carve from stone, wood, bronze or terra cotta.

There were many quarries in the region and those who favoured limestone had several quarries at their disposal which offered limestone of the highest quality.

Often works would be painted in polychrome, basic paints made from pigment and colour powders.  Very often these colours have now worn away and are certainly not as rich as they would have been when first applied but in some cases the polychroming has been maintained especially where works were not overexposed to the elements.

Richier for example used limestone from the quarries at St Mihiel and the surrounding region and developed a way of polishing the limestone to produce a marble like effect, a process known as "l'encaustiquage".&lt;ref&gt;"La Sculpture flamboyante en Champagne et Lorraine" by Jacques Baudoin. Page 54. Book published by Cree. Retrieved 13 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; One such limestone was that taken from the quarries at Sorcy, a form of Euville stone.  This was the stone used for the "mise-au-tombeau" at St Etienne.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commercy.org/euville.htm Sorcy Quarry]  Commercy website. Retrieved 12 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Modelled at two-thirds the size of the original Beanery,&lt;ref name=cultuurwijs&gt;[http://www.cultuurwijs.nl/nwc.stedelijkmuseumamsterdam/cultuurwijs.nl/i000030.html Cultuurwijs - Een nagemaakte kroeg&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; it features the smells and sounds of the bar, and models of customers, all of whom have clocks for faces with the time set at 10:10. Only the model of Barney, the owner, has a real face. Kienholz is quoted as saying "The entire work symbolizes the switch from real time (symbolized by a newspaper) to the surrealist time inside the bar, where people waste time, kill time, forget time, and ignore time".&lt;ref name=cultuurwijs/&gt;

First exhibited in the parking lot of the bar in October 1965,&lt;ref name="Pincus"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pincus|first1=Robert L.|title=On a scale that competes with the world : the art of Edward and Nancy Reddin Kienholz|date=1990|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0-520-06730-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is now in the [[Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam]].

'''''The Cultural Politics of Emotion''''', published in 2004 by [[Edinburgh University Press]] and Routledge, is a book by [[Sara Ahmed]] that focuses on the relationship between emotions, language, and bodies.&lt;ref name="Primary"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ahmed|first=Sara|title=Cultural Politics of Emotion|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415972550}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahmed concentrates on the influence of emotions on the body and the way that bodies relate with communities, producing social relationships that determine the rhetoric of the nation.&lt;ref name="Riedner"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Riedner|first=Rachel C.|title=The Cultural Politics of Emotion, Sara Ahmed|journal=JAC Online Journal|volume=26|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book contributes to the growing conversation about emotion in [[rhetoric]] and [[cultural studies]] and employs a variety of theories including rhetorical theory, queer theory, feminist theory, Marxist theory, and poststructuralist theory of language.&lt;ref name=Riedner /&gt;

==Summary of Ahmed's hypothesis==
[[File:Vimy sculpture.JPG|thumb|''Mother Bereft'', Canadian War Memorial, France. Ahmed asks, "What does it do to say 'The nation mourns'?"]]
Ahmed argues emotions are cultural practices, not psychological states.&lt;ref name="Sapegno"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sapegno|first=Maria Serena|title=Book Review: The Cultural Politics of Emotion|journal=Feminist Theory|date=30 October 2006|volume=7|issue=3|pages=370–372|doi=10.1177/1464700106069051}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bodies are given value through emotion and thus the bodies, as well as the individuals, become aligned with a popular ideology.  Cultural politics of emotions creates "others" by aligning some bodies with each other inside a community and marginalizing other bodies. The repetition of words, or more broadly signs, elicits an emotional response that only grows upon more repetition.  Words often generate meaning because of their history and context, but eventually they can take on a new meaning.  Emotions are material rhetoric - they have affective power and can dictate our modes of life.  In fact, they are gateways into the social and material world.  Emotions can lead to collective politics and social alliances; this social power is exhibited through politics and social movement, even to create national identities.&lt;ref name=Riedner /&gt;  To illustrate her points, Ahmed analyzes public texts and the figurative language that they employ to name or perform emotion.&lt;ref name=Sapegno /&gt;  Ahmed's theory encourages readers to consider the political implications of emotion.&lt;ref name=Riedner /&gt;

==Contents==
Ahmed's book centers around three political events and ideas: the reconciliation of Australian aboriginal children to their families, the public's response to international terrorism, and asylum and immigration in the United Kingdom.  She analyzes texts surrounding these concepts to demonstrate how emotions are public and how the public is emotive.&lt;ref name=Sapegno /&gt;

The book is broken down into the following chapters:
#The Contingency of Pain: Discusses the way that pain is used in politics to demand action or shape identities &lt;ref name=Sapegno /&gt;
#The Organisation of Hate: Discusses the role of hate in nation building to separate self from others &lt;ref name=Sapegno /&gt;
#The Affective Politics of Fear: Argues that responses to terrorism work as an economy of fear &lt;ref name=Sapegno /&gt;
#The Performativity of Disgust: Emphasizes the way that the public views the "other" with disgust &lt;ref name=Sapegno /&gt;
#Shame Before Others: Asserts that shame can form a collective ideal and work for nation building &lt;ref name=Sapegno /&gt;
#In the Name of Love: Discusses the way that multicultural love can help build a nation's identity &lt;ref name=Sapegno /&gt;
#Queer Feelings: Considers the importance of emotions in queer theory &lt;ref name=Sapegno /&gt;
#Feminist Attachments: Discusses the role of emotions in feminist theory &lt;ref name=Sapegno /&gt;

==Critical response and references==

Ahmed's work has been referenced to in many different texts since its creation in 2004, but below are just a few instances where Ahmed's ideas have been discussed.

Greg Noble, a professor at the [[University of Western Sydney]] who was once disgruntled with many concepts of cultural theory, says that Ahmed's book contains an analysis that has moved on from traditions in psychology and sociology in productive ways. She successfully covers a diverse range of emotions and sensations in a variety of contemporary topics. But most attractive to Noble is her development of an understanding of how emotions move - that is, how bodies and worlds materialize from emotion, particularly in the process of nation building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Noble|first=Greg|title=Book Review: Faces of Shame, The Cultural Politics of Emotion|journal=[[International Journal of Cultural Studies]]|date=11 May 2006|volume=9|issue=2|pages=249–253|doi=10.1177/1367877906064033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an introduction to a collection of essays on the theoretical engagement with emotions and affectivity, Ahmed's theory is referred to as groundbreaking.  They commend her ability to depict the relationship between bodies, language, and emotion while also analyzing the intersections of gender, race, class, sexuality, and nation through a variety of histories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Athanasiou|first=Athena |author2=Pothiti Hantzaroula |author3=Kostas Yannakopolous|title=Towards a New Epistemology: The "Affective Turn"|journal=Historein|year=2008|volume=8|pages=5–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their book entitled ''Emotion in Education'', Paul A. Schutz and Reinhard Pekrun apply Ahmed's theories of emotional politics to the classroom, emphasizing Ahmed's idea that emotions are not private but are socially organized.  In addition, they use Ahmed's idea of affective economics - that emotions can be used as economy because they become attached to material objects that join some people together while separating others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schutz|first=Paul A.|author2=Reinhard Pekrun |title=Emotion in Education|year=2007|publisher=Academic Press|location=Burlington}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another text about education and emotions, Michalinos Zembylas discusses the notion of emotional capital, pulling from Bourdieu's various ideas about capital. He works to pull together contemporary discussion about the phrase emotional capital, especially in terms of education, and uses Ahmed's ideas in this synthesis of discussion. He points out the growing emphasis on emotion, especially within cultural studies, but turns the focus of his article to education. Zembylas employs Ahmed's idea that emotions help form the boundaries and relationships between individuals and society, but emotions themselves don't reside in either space. Emotions help us connect with some people while distancing us from others and in material form can be used for political purposes, making it a form of capital. Zembylas concludes that evaluating this emotional capital can help us better understand some of the dynamics that take place in classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zembylas|first=Michalinos|title=Emotional Capital and Education: Theoretical Insights from Bourdieu|journal=British Journal of Educational Studies|date=December 2007|volume=55|issue=4|pages=443–463|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8527.2007.00390.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Hermit Saints''''' is an oil on panel [[triptych]] by [[Hieronymus Bosch]], dating from around 1493. It measures 86 x 60&amp;nbsp;cm. It is housed at the [[Gallerie dell'Accademia|Gallerie dell'Accademia, Venice]].

==History==
The triptych is mentioned at the Palazzo Ducale in 1771, as hanging in the Eccelso Tribunale Hall. In 1838 it was removed by the Austrian authorities, then ruling Venice, to the Imperial Gallery of [[Vienna]] in [[Austria]], from which, in 1893, it went to the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]]. In 1919 it was returned to Venice.

The work has been badly damaged, perhaps by a fire: in particular in the central part, the sky, the landscape and the head of St. Jerome have been repainted. The date of 1493 has been confirmed by [[dendochronology|dendochronologic]] analysis.

==Description==
[[File:Jheronimus Bosch 006 central panel 03 detail 01.jpg|left|thumb|220px|Detail of Bosch's signature.]]

Each of the three panels portrays a different Christian [[anchorite]] saint.&lt;ref name=Falk2008&gt;{{cite book|last=Falk|first=Kurt|title=The Unknown Hieronymus Bosch|year=2008|publisher=North Atlantic Books|isbn=978-1-55643-759-5|page=35|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2h1xyL1GvOYC&amp;pg=PA35|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the center is [[Saint Jerome]], kneeling in the desert and praying at a [[crucifix]] on a stick. The setting is an altar resembling a sculpted Roman [[sarcophagus]], located within a ruined [[oratory (worship)|oratory]]. The reliefs depicts scenes connected to the redemption theme, such as ''[[Judith and Holophernes]]'' (symbolizing the victory of the soul, or Mary killing the devil), a knight and a [[unicorn]], symbol of virginity. In the lower part is a man diving into a beehive and covering himself with honey, perhaps an allusion to carnal love or to [[alchemic]] [[mercury (element)|mercury]]. This detail is depicted in a drawing housed in the [[Albertina]] in Vienna. All around are symbols of [[evil]], scattered in a desert and dark landscape and surrounded by a sinister vegetation. They include, at left, a column with an [[Idolatry|idolater]] adoring the atmospheric phenomena, skeletons, monstrous animals fighting each other and dried bush. At right are instead Jerome's traditional symbols, the red [[cardinal's hat]] and the lion, identifiable with the bony animal drinking at the pool.

The left panel portrays [[St. Anthony the Abbot]] in a nocturnal landscape. The village in fire is perhaps an allegory of the [[ergotism]] plague, or of the saint's alleged capability to quench fires. The saint is collecting the marshy water of a pool with a jar, surrounded by demonic visions such as the naked woman appearing behind a tent in company of several devils. Under her, a devil-fish is pouring wine from a jar, while around it are deformed crickets portrayed in grotesque postures: one is reading a [[missal]], one has a prolonged beak and a peacock tail, while another is composed by a nun head with feet, which carries a [[little owl]] and its nest above.

The right panel shows [[Saint Giles]], who is praying in a grotto; this houses a roll which, according to the [[Golden Legend]], contained all the names of those to be saved thanks to his intercession. The saint has been shot by an arrow, originally destined to the fawn at his feet. The landscape, the less dark of the triptych, is dominated by a sharp rock.

Erdmann, Jos Koldeweij, Rik Klein Gotink, Hieronymus Bosch, Painter and Draughtsman: Technical Studies, Yale University Press, 2016, pp. 66 – 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Bosch employed the usual [[pigments]] of the Renaissance period, such as [[azurite]], [[lead-tin-yellow]], [[vermilion]] and [[ochres]] omitting the expensive natural [[ultramarine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://colourlex.com/project/hieronymus-bosch-hermit-saints-triptych/ Hieronymus Bosch, The Hermit Saints Triptych, ColourLex]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tiny Fuppets''' is an animated Portuguese-language [[World Wide Web|web]]-based cartoon, created by Scott Gairdner.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/08/07/tiny-fuppets-bizzare-muppet-babies-knockoff_n_920511.html|title=Tiny Fuppets: The Most Bizarre 'Muppet Babies' Knockoff Ever (VIDEO)|publisher=huffingtonpost.com|accessdate=2014-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show is a parody of [[Jim Henson]]'s [[Muppet Babies]], and relies on irony and surrealism, as well as purposeful mistranslations for its humour. The show has been named "Most Bizarre Knockoff Ever" by Huffington Post.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/08/22/tiny-fuppets-creator-reac_n_933163.html|title=Tiny Fuppets 'Creator' Reacts To Knockoff Allegations (VIDEO)|publisher=huffingtonpost.com|accessdate=2014-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characters==
*'''Kormit''' - The apparent leader of the tiny fuppets. He generally gets along fine with the rest of the fuppets but can sometimes be hostile and is somewhat abrasive overall. His greatest wish is to be approximately three feet tall. He seems to have somewhat of a relationship with Ms. Woman, as cemented in the episode "Party Pals". He resembles [[Kermit the Frog]].
*'''Ms. Woman''' - The character that Kormit is in a "relationship" with. She is not very smart or headstrong, and usually just supports other characters.
*'''Gonzor''' - The least characteristic of the fuppets, he doesn't play much of a role.
*'''Tummi''' - Tummi plays the "unsung hero" character in the Halloween and Christmas episodes, but doesn't talk at all and is often neglected by the other fuppets
*'''Animanuel''' - Animanuel only occasionally speaks and doesn't often make sense or play a part in the story.

"'''Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Bat'''" is a poem recited by the [[Mad Hatter]] in [[s:Alice's Adventures in Wonderland/Chapter 7|chapter seven]] of [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]''. It is a [[parody]] of "[[Twinkle Twinkle Little Star]]".&lt;ref name=gardner98&gt;{{cite book|last=Gardner|first=Martin|authorlink=Martin Gardner|title=[[The Annotated Alice]]|publisher=[[Random House]]|year=1998|isbn=978-0-517-18920-7|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Text==
&lt;poem&gt;
Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!
How I wonder what you're at!
Up above the world you fly,
Like a tea tray in the sky.
&lt;/poem&gt;

==Context==
The Hatter is interrupted in his recitation by the [[The Dormouse|Dormouse]]. "The Bat" was the nickname of Professor [[Bartholomew Price]], one of the Dons at Oxford, a former teacher of Carroll's and well known to [[Alice Liddell]]'s family.&lt;ref name=gardner98/&gt;

==Other appearances==
* In [[Robert W. Chambers]]'s children's book, ''Orchard-land'' (1903), the poem is partially quoted, in the seventh chapter titled ‘Tha Bat’ and the creature reveals his dislike of being associated with a flying tea tray.
* The poem was sung in Disney's 1951 ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' film. In it, the Dormouse drowsily recited it at the tea party. The poem was later sung again at [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]]'s trial, and taken down as "important" evidence.
* It was sung in the 1970s version of Zoom and In the 1990s version of zoom it was sung due to a request sent in from a viewer who saw the 70s version.
* On the 1974 [[Steeleye Span]] album '[[Now We Are Six (album)|Now We Are Six]]', track 9 'Twinkle Twinkle Little Star' has someone singing 'Twinkle Twinkle Little Bat' quietly in the left audio track, and being very amused by themselves.
* In  the 1960s [[Batman (TV series)|Batman series]], Batman and a woman sing it while trapped in vases and pebbles being dropped on them in a version of the "Chinese water torture".
* The line "Like a teatray in the sky" is used in a 1968 song by [[The Move]] entitled "[[Cherry Blossom Clinic]]", about a mental patient.
* The poem was sung in the [[Alice in Wonderland (1999 film)|1999 film]] by the Hatter ([[Martin Short]]) as a sort of "[[encore (concert)|encore]]" to his singing performances.
* In the [[Muppet Show]] version of ''Alice in Wonderland'', the Mad Tea Party scene opens with The Hatter ([[Gonzo the Great]]) and the March hare and Dormouse ([[Camilla the chicken]]) singing the poem, only to fall about laughing immediately afterwards.
* The first two lines of the poems were recited by the [[Mad Hatter (comics)|Mad Hatter]] in the episode "Mad as a Hatter" of ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]''.
* The poem is also used in the ''[[Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight]]'' Halloween special entitled "Madness". It is read aloud by the [[Mad Hatter (comics)|Mad Hatter]], one of the villains in the series.
