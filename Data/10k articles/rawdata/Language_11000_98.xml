'''’Auhelawa''' is an [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian language]] found in [[Nuakata Island]] and the southeastern tip of [[Normanby Island, Papua New Guinea|Normanby Island]] in [[Milne Bay Province]], [[Papua New Guinea]]. It was spoken by about 1,200 people in 1998, 30% of whom were [[monolingual]] in the language.

The [[literacy rate]] for [[first language]] speakers is 85%, and is also 85% for [[second language]] users. There are translated [[Bible]] portions into the language from 1986–1993.

An '''adrenergic storm''' is a sudden and dramatic increase in [[serum (blood)|serum]] levels of the [[catecholamines]] [[adrenaline]] and [[noradrenaline]] (also known as [[epinephrine]] and [[norepinephrine]] respectively), with a less significant increase in [[dopamine]] transmission. It is a life-threatening condition because of extreme [[tachycardia]] and [[hypertension]], and is especially dire for those with prior heart problems. If treatment is prompt, [[prognosis]] is good; typically large amounts of [[diazepam]] or other [[benzodiazepine]]s are administered alongside [[beta blockers]]. Beta blockers are [[contraindicate]]d in some patients, so other [[anti-hypertensive]] medication such as [[clonidine]] may be used. It is usually caused by overdose of [[stimulant]]s, especially [[cocaine]] or [[methamphetamine]], or eating foods high in tyramine while taking [[MAOI|monoamine oxidase inhibitors]]. A [[subarachnoid hemorrhage]] can also cause an adrenergic storm. A catecholamine storm is part of the normal course of [[Rabies]] infection, and is responsible for the severe feelings of agitation, terror, and [[dysautonomia]] present in the pre-coma stage of the disease.

== Symptoms ==
The behavioral symptoms are similar to those of an [[amphetamine]], [[cocaine]] or [[caffeine]] overdose. Overstimulation of the [[central nervous system]] results in a state of [[hyperkinetic]] movement and unpredictable mental status including mania, rage and suicidal behavior.

Physical symptoms are more serious and include heart [[Heart arrhythmia|arrhythmia]]s as well as outright [[Coronary infarction|heart attack]] or [[stroke]] in people who are at risk of [[coronary disease]]. Breathing is rapid and shallow while both pulse and blood pressure are dangerously elevated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mayersohn|first=M.|last2=Guentert|first2=T. W.|date=1995|year=|title=Clinical pharmacokinetics of the monoamine oxidase-A inhibitor moclobemide|journal=Clinical Pharmacokinetics|volume=29|issue=5|pages=292–332|doi=10.2165/00003088-199529050-00002|issn=0312-5963|pmid=8582117|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==
There are several known causes of adrenergic storms; in the United States, cocaine overdose is the leading cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=C.|last2=Owens|first2=D.|date=1996|year=|title=The recreational drug user in the intensive care unit: a review|journal=Intensive &amp; Critical Care Nursing|volume=12|issue=3|pages=126–130|issn=0964-3397|pmid=8717812|via=|doi=10.1016/s0964-3397(96)80418-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any stimulant drug has the capacity to cause this syndrome if taken in sufficient doses, but even non-psychotropic drugs can very rarely provoke a reaction.

[[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor]]s (MAOIs) are a class of drugs that inhibit the enzyme [[monoamine oxidase]]. This enzyme is responsible for breaking down many compounds; basically, anything with a [[primary amine]] [[Moiety (chemistry)|moiety]] is likely to be [[Redox|oxidized]] by monoamine oxidase. An important [[Substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]] of the enzyme MAO is tyramine. MAOIs inhibit the enzyme either reversibly, in which MAO is inhibited only until the drug is cleared from the system, or irreversibly, in which the substrate binds permanently to the [[enzyme]], rendering it inactive and effectively destroying it. Irreversible MAOIs are potentially more dangerous, because the body takes about two weeks to regenerate MAO enzymes to functional levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yamada|first=Mitsuhiko|last2=Yasuhara|first2=Hajime|date=2004|year=|title=Clinical pharmacology of MAO inhibitors: safety and future|journal=Neurotoxicology|volume=25|issue=1–2|pages=215–221|doi=10.1016/S0161-813X(03)00097-4|issn=0161-813X|pmid=14697896|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two subtypes of MAO exist: MAO-A and MAO-B; this is relevant to adrenergic storms, as there are significant differences between the two types, such as their differential [[Gene expression|expression]] throughout the body, and range of substrates. While both MAO-A and MAO-B metabolize tyramine, only MAO-A is present in the gastrointestinal tract and singularly metabolizes the majority of consumed tyramine.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xlVglDdUdF4C&amp;pg=PA172#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Monoamine Oxidases and Their Inhibitors|last=Youdim|first=Moussa B. H.|last2=Riederer|first2=Peter|date=2011|publisher=Academic Press|year=|isbn=9780123864673|location=|pages=172|language=en|quote=|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The small portion normally passing into circulation is mostly degraded in the liver where both MAO types act.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;) Consequently, MAOIs that irreversibly inhibit MAO-A will permit high levels of circulating tyramine able to cause tyramine-induced hypertensive crisis. Aged [[cheese]], [[beer]], [[red wine]], some [[mushrooms]], and [[fermentation (food)|fermented products]] such as pickles are foods containing high levels of tyramine that passed into circulation can such a [[hypertensive crisis]].

Adrenergic storms are not provoked often from MAOI-tyramine interactions; hypertensive crisis alone does not diagnose adrenergic storm, although there will always be hypertension in an adrenergic storm, along with tachycardia and rapid, shallow breathing. However, if a patient on MAOIs uses recreational quantities of any drug with stimulant effects on the [[Central nervous system|CNS]], it can provoke an adrenergic crisis (along with the inevitable hypertensive crisis). Deaths have occurred from individuals attempting to combine MAOIs with various [[entheogen]]s to attain a stronger [[psychedelic experience]], both from adrenergic storms and [[serotonin syndrome]]. Combining drugs like [[MDMA]], [[2C-B]], [[mescaline]], [[2C-T-7]], etc. with even small quantities of MAOIs - small quantities of both drugs - is still extremely risky. Nevertheless, some users claim to use certain combinations successfully.

[[Subarachnoid hemorrhage]] is an extremely serious condition in which a neural membrane is breached and the brain itself is compromised. The onset is sudden, described as "the worst headache of one's life," and many grave symptoms follow. Adrenergic storm is often present among these symptoms, and is responsible for some of the dangers, both long-term and short, of subarachnoid hemhorrhage adrenergic storm, through a complex cascade of processes starting with the movement of subarachnoid blood into the brain. Apparently, as the [[intracranial pressure]] increases, the brain is squeezed and catecholamines are forced out of their vesicles into the synapses and extracellular space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uzdr1wLtIgAC&amp;pg=PA21|title=Current Management of Cerebral Aneurysms|last=Rodman|first=Karen D.|last2=Awad|first2=Issam A.|date=1993|publisher=Thieme|year=|isbn=9781879284135|editor-last=Awad|editor-first=Issam A.|location=|pages=21–43|language=en|chapter=5. Clinical Presentation|quote=|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An alternative explanation that has been proposed is that this increased in intracranial pressure transduces through the brain parenchyma through to the blood vessels producing a loss in effective cerebral perfusion.  This triggers the sympathetic nervous system to secrete more norepinepherine and epinepherine increasing blood pressure and heart rate to dangerous levels to maintain cerebral perfusion.

Rarely, a [[pheochromocytoma]] (tumor of the [[adrenal medulla|medullar]] tissue of the [[adrenal glands]], which are located [[anterior]] to the [[kidney]]), may result in an adrenergic storm. This type of tumor is not common to begin with, and furthermore, the subtype that can cause massive adrenaline release is rarer still. Patients with pheochromocytoma can unexpectedly fly into a rage or sink into trembling fear, possibly dangerous to themselves and others as their judgment is impaired, their senses and pain threshold are heightened, and the level of the adrenalin in their bloodstream is more than most people ever experience; pheochromocytoma can, very rarely, kill by internal adrenaline overdose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Whalen|first=R. K.|last2=Althausen|first2=A. F.|last3=Daniels|first3=G. H.|date=1992|year=|title=Extra-adrenal pheochromocytoma|journal=The Journal of Urology|volume=147|issue=1|pages=1–10|issn=0022-5347|pmid=1729490|via=|doi=10.1016/s0022-5347(17)37119-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; But overall, adrenergic storm is an uncommon but certainly not rare phenomenon associated with the also uncommon condition of pheochromocytoma.

[[Porphyria]]

==Diagnosis==
=== Differential diagnosis ===

Because the adrenergic storm overlaps with so many other similar conditions, such as hypertensive crises, stimulant intoxication or overdose, or even [[panic attack]], and because the treatments for these overlapping conditions are largely alike, it is not necessary to obtain a [[Differential diagnosis|differential]] and definitive diagnosis before initiating treatment. However, analysis of the patient's [[medical history]], checked against the possible causes of the adrenergic storm such as those above, should be done, because some adrenergic storms can be caused by serious underlying conditions. If a patient has an adrenergic storm and all or most of the other factors are ruled out, the adrenergic storm could lead to the discovery of a pheochromocytoma, which can become [[Malignancy|malignant]]. However, not all cases of adrenergic storm have an identifiable cause. Like a [[seizure]], sometimes a patient has a single one, or perhaps a few, and then does not for the rest of their life. The mechanisms of idiopathic adrenergic storm are very poorly understood.

[[Serotonin syndrome]], in which an excess of serotonin in the synapses causes a similar crisis of hypertension and mental confusion, could be confused with an adrenergic storm. The difference is that serotonin, being a tryptamine (non-catecholamine) involved in higher brain functions, can cause dangerous hypertension and tachycardia from its effects on the [[sympathetic nervous system]], but as there are no serotonin receptors in the heart or blood vessels there are no direct effects on the heart. Thus, the presence of arrythmia, abnormal echocardiograms, or chest pain indicates an adrenergic crisis and rules out serotonin syndrome.

== Treatment ==

If there is evidence of overdose or it is suspected, the patient should be given [[gastric lavage]], [[activated charcoal]], or both; this could make the difference between life and death in a close situation. It can however aggravate the patient which should be taken into account.

The first line treatments are [[diazepam]] and a non-selective beta blocker; other antihypertensive drugs may also be used. It is important to note that not all benzodiazepines and beta blockers are safe to use in an adrenergic storm; for instance, [[alprazolam]] and [[propranolol]]; alprazolam weakly agonizes dopamine receptors and causes catecholamine release while propranolol mildly promotes some catecholamine release - each worsening the condition.

Adrenergic storms are often idiopathic in nature; however if there is an underlying condition, then that must be addressed after bringing the heart rate and blood pressure down.

==Early life==
[[File:Earlier days.jpg|thumb|Aryamba Early Days]]
Aryamba is the youngest daughter of Sri B.M Krishnaswamy and Smt Thangamma. Sri B.M Krishnaswamy was the younger brother of Sri [[B. M. Srikantaiah]], the doyen of Kannada literature. Aryamba was born on March 12, 1936 in [[Mandya]], in the erstwhile [[Kingdom of Mysore]] of [[British India]] (in present-day [[Mysore]], [[Karnataka]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kannada Novelist Triveni's House In City To Be A Museum|url=http://starofmysore.com/kannada-novelist-trivenis-house-city-museum/|website=Star of Mysore|accessdate=25 April 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170425194906/http://starofmysore.com/kannada-novelist-trivenis-house-city-museum/|archivedate=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Aryamba comes from an illustrious family of established writers. Her uncle [[B. M. Srikantaiah]] was a renowned scholar and poet, whose translations are present in university texts all over the world. Her aunt [[Vani (writer)|Vani]] was a popular novelist. She has two sisters, Prabhavathi and [[Anasuya]], who both went on to publish. She also has four brothers, Bellur K. Srikanta Swamy, Bellur K. Ramachandra, Bellur K. Devaraj and Bellur K. Ranganath.

Aryamba completed her Master of Arts (MA) in Sociology, from Mysore University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Original Documents|author=S.N Shankar (Triveni's husband)|date=January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Over the course of several years, she has published 32 novels, 5 short story collections, 12 books for children, 5 biographies (including one on Mother Theresa whom she interviewed), 6 dramas, 3 essays, and 1 on sports literature. [[Rajyotsava Awards (2015)|2015]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scientist, actor, cricketer among 60 Rajyotsava awardees|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/509276/scientist-actor-cricketer-among-60.html|work=Deccan Herald|accessdate=1 May 2017|date=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aryamba conducted research for several of her biographies, including interviewing Mother Theresa when she had visited Mysore. Like her sister, she began to write fiction at a time when there were very few female writers in Kannada.

Her [[Eradu Mukha]] won Karnataka State Award and best picture award from Madras Film Lovers Association. [[Marali gudige]] won the State Award. [[Parampare]] novel (1985) was selected and published by Government of Karnataka. [[Bharathada Mahapurusharu]] was prescribed as the non detailed text book by Karnataka University, IInd PUC for 2 years (1977–1978). Some parts of the book were published in the text book of 10th standard - Karnataka and Kerala state schools. All six of her dramas have been broadcast from Mysuru and Bengaluru A.I.R, stations. She has presented at several literary state seminars throughout Mysore and Bangalore, presented her work on the All India Radio stations, won several awards and felicitations, had her work published in several daily, weekly and monthly Kannada magazines and papers, and is the founder of several organizations. She was the chief editor of "Mahila Sahithya Sameekshe" and "Sahithya Vimarshe".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sahitya Academy award for Aryamba Pattabhi|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/Sahitya-Academy-award-for-Aryamba-Pattabhi/articleshow/1749650230.cms|work=The Times of India|accessdate=1 May 2017|date=5 January 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Andrew Hsiu (2017)&lt;ref name="Hsiu2017"&gt;Hsiu, Andrew. 2017. ''[https://www.academia.edu/35542553/The_Lawu_languages_footprints_along_the_Red_River_valley_corridor The Lawu languages: footprints along the Red River valley corridor]''.&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that Awu is related to [[Lawu language|Lawu]] of [[Xinping County]], [[Yunnan]], and that the two form a ''Lawu'' or ''[[Lawoish languages|Lawoish]]'' language branch. The linguistic evidence suggests that the ancestors of the Awu had migrated down the [[Red River (Asia)|Red River]] valley from further up northwest, and arrived at their present location after migrating downstream. [[Lewu language|Lewu]], an extinct language, may have been related.

==Identity and names==
The Awu consider themselves to be a separate ethnic group from the [[Hani people]], including the [[Nuobi language|Nuobi]].&lt;ref name="Lu2011"/&gt; However, the Awu are officially classified by the Chinese government as a [[Hani people|Hani]] subgroup. On the other hand, the Nuobi refer to themselves as ''xa31 ni31''.&lt;ref name="Lu2011"/&gt; The Awu believe that they are culturally more similar to the [[Kucong language|Kucong]], who speak a language similar to [[Lahu language|Lahu]] (Lu &amp; Lu 2011:23).

The Awu call themselves ''lu33 ju33 za33'', and are referred to by the [[Nuobi language|Nuobi]] people as ''la31 wu33 za31''.

==Distribution==
Awu is also spoken in [[Jiangcheng Hani and Yi Autonomous County]] and [[Jinping Miao, Yao, and Dai Autonomous County]]. Pelkey (2011:454) calls the language ''Lawu Yi'', and reports that it spoken in Mengla Township and other nearby areas of Jinping County. The ''Jinping County Ethnic Gazetteer'' (2013:101) calls the language ''Laowu'' 老乌 (autonym: ''Laoyong'' 老涌), which is spoken in Laojizhai 老集寨, Laomeng 老勐, Yingpan 营盘, and Mengla 勐拉 townships (in 29 villages), comprising 2,222 households and 9,342 persons as of 2005.

In southern Yunnan, Awu (''a55 ɣu55 pho21'') is located in Mengzi County 蒙自, Nansha of Yuanyang County 元阳南沙, Dawuzhai of Yuanyang County 元阳大乌寨, and Tuanjie Xiaozhai of Jinping County 金平团结小寨.&lt;ref name="ynszxc2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynszxc.gov.cn/villagePage/vIndex.aspx?departmentid=189138|website=ynszxc.gov.cn|title=金平苗族瑶族傣族自治县老集寨乡团结村委会小寨村|accessdate=2017-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Long2007"&gt;龙倮贵. 2007.

'''Bamboo English''' was a [[Japanese Pidgin English|Japanese Pidgin-English jargon]] developed after [[World War II]] that was spoken between [[Americans|American]] [[United States Armed Forces|military personnel]] and the [[Japanese people|Japanese]] on US military bases in [[Occupation of Japan|occupied Japan]]. It has been thought to be a [[pidgin]],&lt;ref&gt;Duke (1970): p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; though analysis of the language's features indicates it to be a pre-pidgin or a jargon rather than a stable pidgin.&lt;ref&gt;Avram (2017): p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was exported to Korea during the [[Korean War]] by American military personnel as a method of communicating with Koreans. Here it acquired some Korean words, but remained largely based on English and Japanese. Recently, it has been most widely used in [[Okinawa Prefecture]],&lt;ref&gt;Smith (1994): p. 343.&lt;/ref&gt; where there is a significant [[United States Forces Japan|U.S. military presence]].

The [[Bonin Islands]] feature a similar form of Japanese Pidgin English referred to as [[Bonin English]]. This contact language was developed due to a back-and-forth shift in dominant languages between English and Japanese spanning over one hundred years.&lt;ref&gt;Long (2007): pp. 17-18&lt;/ref&gt;

The name Bamboo English was coined by Arthur M. Z. Norman in an article,&lt;ref&gt;Norman (1955): p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; where he initially described the language.

== Phonology ==
With the differences between Japanese and English in terms of sounds included in each language and the placement of those sounds within words, the combination of the two within Bamboo English shows some differences between English-speaking and Japanese-speaking individuals even for the same words.

The ending consonants of words are often altered by Japanese speakers for English words that do not end with [n, m,] or [ŋ] (such as can, from, and song, respectively) by adding an /o/ or /u/ to the end of the word.&lt;ref&gt;Avram (2017): p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; This altering was picked up by English speakers, though applied without the knowledge of why it was done, such as in the case of ''saymo-saymo'' meaning 'same'.&lt;ref&gt;Avram (2017): p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another similar alteration demonstrated in Bamboo English was the addition of the "ee" sound (as in cheese) to the end of English words. Words such as 'change', 'catch', and 'speak' then became ''changee'', ''ketchee'', and ''speakie''.&lt;ref&gt;Avram (2017): p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

As well, Japanese speakers mimicked some aspects of English speech by removing final vowels from some words, such as the word for 'car' which is normally ''jidōsha'' in Japanese but which is said as ''jidoš''&lt;ref&gt;Avram (2017): p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; in Bamboo English.

==Morphology==
Documentation of the [[morphology]] of Bamboo English is rather incomplete and so demonstrating the presence or absence of various characteristics is difficult.

[[Compound (linguistics)|Compounding]], for example, has little record of existing within Bamboo English due to this. On the other hand, [[affixation]] has been better noted. The presence of the [[suffix]] ''-san'', taken from Japanese, is often attached to terms of reference and address such as "mama", "papa", "boy", "girl", and "baby" to produce nouns such as ''mama-san'' or ''baby-san''.&lt;ref&gt;Avram (2017): p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

An additional morphological trait shown in Bamboo English is [[reduplication]], though examples shown from the language indicate that this is not true reduplication as there are no forms of these words with only a single occurrence of the root. Such words are ''chop-chop'' meaning 'food', ''dame-dame'' meaning 'bad', and ''hubba-hubba'' meaning 'to hurry' .&lt;ref&gt;Avram (2017): p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Syntax==
As Bamboo English does not make significant use of inflection and the vocabulary was limited, words obtained multiple functions. Nouns often served in this as the initial use, with use as a verb, adjective, or adverb then developing. For example, ''chop-chop'' means 'food' but also 'to eat'. Other such dual-use words are ''hayaku'' meaning 'quickly' and also 'to hurry up', ''sayonara'' meaning 'absence' and 'to get rid of', and ''taksan'' meaning 'many, many', 'very', and 'large'.&lt;ref&gt;Avram (2017): p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Example Phrases ===
Examples taken from Duke (1970): p. 170.

Bob Bryce was the team coordinator. It is undergoing final checking before publication.

In the final decades of the 20th century the [[Canadian Bible Society]], working in partnership with the Cree Nation, the Church and other partners – including the [[Summer Institute of Linguistics]] – began working on a new Cree Bible. Reverend Stan Cuthand, a Cree elder, Anglican priest and an expert in his language has been the lead translator on the project, working closely with several Cree people and with the support of Canadian Bible Society consultant Ruth Heeg. Progress on this new translation has been slow due in part to the lack of adequate resources to complete the quality assurance process. The Easter story from the Gospel of Luke was published in a Latin alphabet and issued with a CD. The Old Testament [[Book of Ruth]] was published in a parallel-script format that presented Cree syllabics and Latin on facing pages. The subsequent Gospel of Mark was also in a parallel script format with a CD.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Bible Society donates to Briercrest. http://www.briercrest.ca/alumni/news-article.asp?id=780&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4659">A '''character''' is a [[sign (semiotic)|sign]] or [[symbol]].

==History==
[[Ancient Greek|Greek]]  {{lang|grc|χαρακτήρ}} is a nomen agentis of the verb {{lang|grc|χαράσσω}} (''charassō'') with a meaning "to sharpen, to whet", and also "to make cake",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dxara%2Fssw χαράσσω], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; from a [[PIE root]] ''{{PIE|*g'ʰer-}}'' "cut" also continued in Irish ''gearr'' and English ''gash'', which is perhaps an early loan ultimately from the same Greek root.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/gash?rskey=Oftsw6&amp;result=1#m_en_gb0327980 gash], on Oxford Dictionaries&lt;/ref&gt;

A {{lang|grc|χαρακτήρ}} is thus an "engraver",  originally in the sense of a craftsman, but then also used for a tool used for engraving, and for a stamp for minting coins. From the stamp, the meaning was extended to the stamp impression, [[Plato]] using the noun in the sense of "engraved mark". In [[Plutarch]], the word could refer to a figure or letter, [[Lucian]] uses it of [[hieroglyph]]s as opposed to Greek ''grammata'' (''Herm''. 44)

Metaphorically, it could refer to a distinctive mark, [[Herodotus]] (1.57) using it of a particular dialect, or (1.116) of a characteristic mark of an individual. The collective noun {{lang|grc|χαρακτηριστικά}} "characteristics" appears later, in [[Dionysius Halicarnassensis]].

Via Latin ''{{lang|la|charactēr}}'', Old French ''{{lang|fr|caracter}}'', the word passed into [[Middle English]] as ''{{lang|und|caracter}}'' in the 14th century. [[John Wycliffe|Wycliffe]] (1382) has ''To haue a {{lang|und|caracter}} [...] in her forhedis'' ({{bibleref|Revelation|13:16}}) for the [[mark of the beast]] (translating {{lang|grc|χάραγμα}} "imprinted or branded mark").

==Grapheme==
The word was used in the sense of [[Letter (alphabet)|letter]] or [[grapheme]] by [[William Caxton]], referring to the [[Phoenician alphabet]],  ''The Fenyces were the fyrst inuentours of {{lang|und|caracteris}} dyfferencing that one fro{{Clarify|date=June 2016}} that other, of whiche were fourmed lettres for to write'' (''Eneydos'' 6.25). As in Greek, the word was used especially for foreign or mysterious graphemes (such as [[Chinese character|Chinese]], [[Syriac alphabet|Syriac]], or [[Runes|Runic]] ones)  as opposed to the familiar ''letters''; in particular of [[shorthand]] (in ''[[David Copperfield (novel)|David Copperfield]]'' (chapter 38) sarcastically of [[shorthand]], "a procession of new horrors, called arbitrary characters; the most despotic characters I have ever known"), and since 1949 in computing (see [[character (computing)]].

As a collective noun, the word can refer to writing or printing in general ([[Shakespeare's sonnet]] [[Sonnet 59|nr. 59]]: ''Since minde at first in carrecter was done'', viz. "since  thought was first put in writing").

==Esotericism and magic==
{{see|Diabolical signature}}
The word in [[Renaissance magic]] came to refer to any astrological, cabbalistic or magical sign or symbol. Related is the [[Sacramental character]] of Catholic doctrine.
Famously, [[John Dee (mathematician)|John Dee]] designed his ''[[Monas Hieroglyphica]]'' in 1564.

In the  19th century, this sense of the word appears mainly in Romantic poetry, such as  Sir [[Walter Scott]]'s ''Lay of the last minstrel'' (1805), where "A hallow'd taper shed a glimmering light / On mystic implements of magic might; On cross, and character, and talisman," (6.17).

==Semiotics and epistemology==
{{see|sign (semiotics)}}

From the esoteric or mystical meanings, Early Modern learned authors abstracted a notion of ''Character'' as a code or hierarchical system that embodied all knowledge or all of [[reality]], or a written representation of a [[philosophical language]] that would recover the "[[true name]]s" lost in the [[confusion of tongues]]. 

This idea had currency as a kind of epistemological [[philosophers' stone]] for about a century, from the mid 17th century, with [[Francis Lodwick]] (1642) and [[John Wilkins]]'s  ''Essay towards a Real Character, and a Philosophical Language''  (1668), to the later 18th century and the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' where in a long entry under the heading ''Charactère'', [[D'Alembert]] critically reviewed such projects of the past century.

'''''Crazy English''''' is a 1999 [[Cinema of China|Chinese documentary]] directed by [[Zhang Yuan (director)|Zhang Yuan]]. The film premiered along with Zhang's ''[[Seventeen Years (film)|Seventeen Years]]'' at the 1999 [[Locarno International Film Festival]]. It established Zhang's position as a "legitimate" director after years of working independently from, and often at odds with, the Chinese [[State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television|authorities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117914650.html|title=Seventeen Years Review|publisher=''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''|author=Elley, Derek |date=1999-09-13 |accessdate=2008-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to earlier films, like ''[[East Palace, West Palace]]'' (1997), ''Crazy English'' was produced with the cooperation of the state-owned [[Xi'an Film Studio]], which enjoys a "presented by" billing in the film's credits.&lt;ref name=Elley&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117914589.html|title=Crazy English Review| author= Elley, Derek| publisher = ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' | date=1999-08-30|accessdate=2008-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subject ==
{{main|Li Yang (Crazy English)}}

The film follows one of the [[People's Republic of China]]'s most popular motivational speakers, [[Li Yang (Crazy English)|Li Yang]], the founder of "[[Crazy English]]". Li is known for his stadium-sized presentations where he exhorts his audiences to engage in mass recitations of English phrases and [[idiom]]s, often with a strong [[Chinese nationalism|nationalist]] bent: "Conquer English to Make China Stronger!".&lt;ref name=NYer&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/04/28/080428fa_fact_osnos|title=Letter from China: Crazy English: Reporting and Essays| publisher = ''[[The New Yorker]]'' | author = Osnos, Evan| authorlink = Evan Osnos | date = 2008-04-28| accessdate=2008-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Li, however, has also courted controversy. Despite the fact that he teaches a foreign language, Li has never left China, a fact not revealed in the film until the end.&lt;ref name=Elley/&gt; Other common criticisms, including accusations that Li Yang is a "nationalist huckster" and that his methods do not actually improve English-speaking ability,&lt;ref name=NYer/&gt; receive a much more subtle presentation in Zhang's film.

The film follows Li on his tours throughout China with a few interspersed interviews. Zhang Yuan has described the film as a combination of [[Leni Riefenstahl]]'s ''[[Triumph of the Will]]'' and [[Robert Zemeckis]]' ''[[Forrest Gump]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Berry, Michael (2005). "Wording up a Sweat in a Celluloid Sauna" in ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=a5oy2HlLth8C Speaking in Images: Interviews with Contemporary Chinese Filmmakers]''. Columbia University Press, p. 144. {{ISBN|0-231-13331-6}}. Google Book Search. Retrieved 2008-08-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production history ==
The seeds for ''Crazy English'' first arose when Li Yang's manager asked to meet with Zhang Yuan at a bar in Beijing's [[Sanlitun]] neighborhood. At the time Zhang Yuan had not even heard of Li Yang or his "Crazy English" programs.&lt;ref name=B152&gt;Berry, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; After meeting with the manager, Zhang was sufficiently intrigued by the idea of a documentary about Li to arrange for an actual meeting with the motivational speaker.&lt;ref name=B152/&gt;

Once the two men met, Zhang Yuan "immediately" decided to make the film.&lt;ref name=B152/&gt; Though made with the assent of official authorities, the filmmakers were nevertheless forced to make certain cuts&lt;ref&gt;Tasker, Yvonne (2002). "Zhang Yuan" in [https://books.google.com/books?id=xjQ7ifqiIksC ''Fifty Contemporary Filmmakers'']. Routledge Publishing, p. 427. {{ISBN|0-415-18974-8}}. Google Book Search. Retrieved 2008-08-30.&lt;/ref&gt; before being allowed a limited release for their documentary.&lt;ref name="B153"/&gt; Zhang has noted that his own opinions of Li Yang vary dramatically from admiration to disgust.&lt;ref name=B152/&gt; One critic also noticed Zhang's ambivalence in the film and noted that the film seems to shift from appreciation or amusement at Li Yang's methodologies to one darker in tone, as Li Yang's mass rallies begin to resemble Mao-era [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guard]] rallies or even Hitler's [[Nuremberg Rally]].&lt;ref name=B152/&gt;

== Reception ==
Despite of its official approval, ''Crazy English'' received only a limited release in select cities within China.&lt;ref name=B153&gt;Berry, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; Zhang Yuan has stated that the film's reception within China was difficult to read, given the mass adoration (and criticism) that Li Yang often elicits.&lt;ref name=B153/&gt;

While China remained ambivalent, the west also responded to ''Crazy English'' with mixed reactions. At least one critic felt that the film was too long and better suited for [[television]] than film.&lt;ref name=Elley/&gt; On the other hand, the film journal ''[[Senses of Cinema]]'' showered praise on ''Crazy English'', saying, "This is a fascinating film - for China watchers, for educators and for fans of the documentary film - and is an absolute must for festival patrons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/festivals/00/8/miff/zhang.html |title=Zhang Yuan's Seventeen Years and Crazy English and Thai film Nang Nak |publisher=''[[Senses of Cinema]]'' |date=July 2000 |author=Freiberg, Freda |accessdate=2008-08-30 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080730155548/http://www.sensesofcinema.com/contents/festivals/00/8/miff/zhang.html |archivedate=2008-07-30 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As for the film's subject, Li Yang was reportedly less than pleased by the film's portrayal of him as a demagogue, and he has gone on to say that the film was "not a real documentary" accusing Zhang of manipulating the film to appeal to Western audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/NM-e/83370.htm|title=Li Yang a Crazy Talker |publisher=''[[City Weekend]]''| accessdate=2008-08-30|date=2003-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[pharmacology]], an '''endogenous agonist''' for a particular [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] is a compound naturally produced by the body which binds to and [[agonist|activates]] that receptor. For example, the primary endogenous agonist for [[5-HT receptor|serotonin receptors]] is [[serotonin]], and the primary endogenous agonist for [[dopamine receptor]]s is [[dopamine]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodman and Gilman's Manual of Pharmacology and Therapeutics. (11th edition, 2008). p14. {{ISBN|0-07-144343-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, receptors for [[small molecule]] [[neurotransmitter]]s such as serotonin will have only one endogenous agonist, but often have many different receptor subtypes (e.g. 13 different [[serotonin receptor|receptors for serotonin]]). On the other hand, [[neuropeptide]] receptors tend to have fewer subtypes, but may have several different endogenous agonists. This allows for a high degree of complexity in the bodies signalling system, with different tissues often showing quite distinct responses to a particular [[ligand]]. Some endogenous [[Antagonist (pharmacology)|antagonists]] and [[inverse agonist]]s are also known (e.g., [[kynurenic acid]] at the [[NMDA receptor]]), but these are much less common.

In [[graph theory]], the '''Erdős–Faber–Lovász conjecture''' is an unsolved problem about [[graph coloring]], named after [[Paul Erdős]], [[Vance Faber]], and [[László Lovász]], who formulated it in 1972.&lt;ref name="e81"&gt;{{harvtxt|Erdős|1981}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  It says:

:If {{mvar|k}} [[complete graph]]s, each having exactly {{mvar|k}} vertices, have the property that every pair of complete graphs has at most one shared vertex, then the union of the graphs can be colored with {{mvar|k}}&amp;nbsp;colors.

==Equivalent formulations==
{{harvtxt|Haddad|Tardif|2004}} introduced the problem with a story about seating assignment in committees: suppose that, in a university department, there are {{mvar|k}} committees, each consisting of {{mvar|k}} faculty members, and that all committees meet in the same room, which has {{mvar|k}} chairs. Suppose also that at most one person belongs to the intersection of any two committees. Is it possible to assign the committee members to chairs in such a way that each member sits in the same chair for all the different committees to which he or she belongs? In this model of the problem, the faculty members correspond to graph vertices, committees correspond to complete graphs, and chairs correspond to vertex colors.

A ''linear hypergraph'' (also known as [[partial linear space]]) is a [[hypergraph]] with the property that every two [[hyperedges]] have at most one vertex in common. A hypergraph is said to be uniform if all of its hyperedges have the same number of vertices as each other. The {{mvar|n}} cliques of size {{mvar|n}} in the Erdős–Faber–Lovász conjecture may be interpreted as the hyperedges of an {{mvar|n}}-uniform linear hypergraph that has the same vertices as the underlying graph. In this language, the Erdős–Faber–Lovász conjecture states that, given any {{mvar|n}}-uniform linear hypergraph with {{mvar|n}} hyperedges, one may {{mvar|n}}-color the vertices such that each hyperedge has one vertex of each color.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Romero|Sánchez Arroyo|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''simple hypergraph'' is a hypergraph in which at most one hyperedge connects any pair of vertices and there are no hyperedges of size at most one. In the graph coloring formulation of the Erdős–Faber–Lovász conjecture, it is safe to remove vertices that belong to a single clique, as their coloring presents no difficulty; once this is done, the hypergraph that has a vertex for each clique, and a hyperedge for each graph vertex, forms a simple hypergraph.
And, the hypergraph dual of [[graph coloring|vertex coloring]] is [[edge coloring]]. Thus, the Erdős–Faber–Lovász conjecture is equivalent to the statement that any simple hypergraph with {{mvar|n}} vertices has chromatic index (edge coloring number) at most {{mvar|n}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Chiang|Lawler|1988}}. {{harvtxt|Hindman|1981}} describes an equivalent problem in the language of set systems instead of hypergraphs.&lt;/ref&gt;

The graph of the Erdős–Faber–Lovász conjecture may be represented as an [[intersection graph]] of sets: to each vertex of the graph, correspond the set of the cliques containing that vertex, and connect any two vertices by an edge whenever their corresponding sets have a nonempty intersection. Using this description of the graph, the conjecture may be restated as follows: if some family of sets has {{mvar|n}} total elements, and any two sets intersect in at most one element, then the intersection graph of the sets may be {{mvar|n}}-colored.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hindman|1981}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Intersection number (graph theory)|intersection number]] of a graph {{mvar|G}} is the minimum number of elements in a family of sets whose intersection graph is {{mvar|G}}, or equivalently the minimum number of vertices in a hypergraph whose [[Line graph of a hypergraph|line graph]] is {{mvar|G}}.  {{harvtxt|Klein|Margraf|2003}} define the linear intersection number of a graph, similarly, to be the minimum number of vertices in a linear hypergraph whose line graph is {{mvar|G}}. As they observe, the Erdős–Faber–Lovász conjecture is equivalent to the statement that the chromatic number of any graph is at most equal to its linear intersection number.

{{harvtxt|Haddad|Tardif|2004}} present another yet equivalent formulation, in terms of the theory of [[Clone (algebra)|clones]].

==History and partial results==
[[Paul Erdős]], [[Vance Faber]], and [[László Lovász]] formulated the conjecture in 1972.&lt;ref name="e81"&gt;{{harvtxt|Erdős|1981}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Paul Erdős]] originally offered US$50 for proving the conjecture in the affirmative, and later raised the reward to US$500.&lt;ref name="e81"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Chung|Graham|1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{harvtxt|Chiang|Lawler|1988}} proved that the chromatic number of the graphs in the conjecture is at most {{math|3''k''/''2'' &amp;minus; 2}}, and {{harvtxt|Kahn|1992}} improved this to {{math|''k'' + ''o''(''k'')}}.

==Related problems==
It is also of interest to consider the chromatic number of graphs formed as the union of {{mvar|k}} cliques of {{mvar|k}} vertices each, without restricting how big the intersections of pairs of cliques can be. In this case, the chromatic number of their union is at most {{math|1 + ''k'' {{sqrt|''k'' &amp;minus; 1}}}}, and some graphs formed in this way require this many colors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Erdős|1991}}; {{harvtxt|Horák|Tuza|1990}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A version of the conjecture that uses the [[Fractional coloring|fractional chromatic number]] in place of the chromatic number is known to be true. That is, if a graph {{mvar|G}} is formed as the union of {{mvar|k}} {{mvar|k}}-cliques that intersect pairwise in at most one vertex, then {{mvar|G}} can be {{mvar|k}}-colored.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kahn|Seymour|1992}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the framework of edge coloring simple hypergraphs, {{harvtxt|Hindman|1981}} defines a number {{mvar|L}} from a simple hypergraph as the number of hypergraph vertices that belong to a hyperedge of three or more vertices. He shows that, for any fixed value of {{mvar|L}}, a finite calculation suffices to verify that the conjecture is true for all simple hypergraphs with that value of {{mvar|L}}. Based on this idea, he shows that the conjecture is indeed true for all simple hypergraphs with {{math|''L'' ≤ 10}}. In the formulation of coloring graphs formed by unions of cliques, Hindman's result shows that the conjecture is true whenever at most ten of the cliques contain a vertex that belongs to three or more cliques. In particular, it is true for {{math|''n'' ≤ 10}}.

'''Eugeni d’Ors i Rovira''' ({{IPA-ca|əwˈʒɛni ˈðɔɾs}}; [[Barcelona]], 28 September 1881 – [[Vilanova i la Geltrú]], 25 September 1954) was a [[spanish people|Spanish]] writer, [[essay]]ist, [[Journalism|journalist]], [[Philosophy|philosopher]] and [[Art criticism|art critic]]. He wrote in both [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]], sometimes under the [[pseudonym]] of ''Xènius'' ({{IPA-ca|ˈʃɛnius|pron}}).

He studied law in Barcelona and received his [[PhD]] degree in [[Madrid]]. 

He collaborated from 1906 on in  ''[[La Veu de Catalunya]]'' and was a member of Catalan [[Noucentisme]]. He was the secretary of the [[Institut d'Estudis Catalans]] in 1911 and director of the ''Instrucció Pública de la [[Mancomunitat de Catalunya]]'' (Commonwealth of Catalonia) in 1917, but he left in 1920 after [[Enric Prat de la Riba]]'s death. In 1923 he moved to [[Madrid]] where he became a member of the [[Real Academia Española]] in 1927. In 1938, during [[Spanish Civil War]] he was the General Director on Fine Arts in the [[Francoist]] provisional government in [[Burgos]].

He was the father of the noted Spanish jurist, historian and political theorist, [[Álvaro d'Ors]], and the grandfather of [[Juan d'Ors]].

When a person accused of a crime is convicted and [[sentence (law)|sentenced]] to [[capital punishment]], the person can make a '''final statement''', or express their '''[[last words]]''', before being executed. The substance of these last words may or may not have anything to do with the crime of which the condemned person has been convicted. 

==History==
In the mid-1670s there was an explosion of printed materials about trials and executions, addressed to a wide range of people who wanted to know more about these matters. This curiosity was satisfied with regular publications about last dying speeches and the behaviour of prisoners.

The publishing of last dying speeches and confessions started to be common after 1650, at the same time with the rise of newspapers and several political executions.
This right to have a public confession of innocence or guilt was one of the unalienable privileges of prisoners. But sometimes officials threatened the martyrs in order to guarantee their silence, or, other times, they were interrupted or silenced at the gallows.

==Content==
Final statements relevant to the alleged crime in question may run the gamut from maintenance of innocence to self-incrimination, and their tone may likewise be anywhere from conciliatory to provocative.  For example, one may
* maintain one's innocence while nevertheless forgiving one's executioners (see [[Ronald Clark O'Bryan]] below);
* maintain one's legal or at least moral innocence while haranguing the authorities and/or, as with some [[Political crime|political criminals]] especially in the era of [[Public execution|public executions]],{{cn|date=August 2013}} attempting to ensure one's status as a martyr (see [[Madame Roland]] below);
* admit or readmit one's guilt and apologize to one's victims (see [[Arthur Gary Bishop]] and [[Karla Faye Tucker]] below); or
* (re)admit one's commission of the alleged offense in the course of mocking that offense's victims and their injuries.

Other subject matters of final statements may include
* requests to one's executioner(s) for a quick and/or painless death (see [[Ronald Ryan]] and [[Irma Grese]] below);
* indifference toward death, especially given its inevitability for and universality among even persons not executed (see [[Robert Alton Harris]] below)
* affirmative welcoming of one's fate for reasons other than or broader than a desire to make atonement, especially including the perception of death as a release from suffering (see the second half of the first statement attributed to [[Sir Walter Raleigh]] below);
* contempt toward authorities and/or society for reasons unrelated to or broader than one's being convicted and sentenced (see [[John Wayne Gacy]] and Johnny Garrett below);
* challenges encouraging and implicitly ratifying the actions of one's executioners, usually to demonstrate bravery in the face of death in embodiment of an [[Ethos|ethical]] ideal and/or establish a historical record of one's having done so (see the first half of the first statement attributed to [[Sir Walter Raleigh]] below); and
* jokes, usually to demonstrate equanimity or even lightheartedness toward or contempt for death, and in those cases usually to embody an ethical ideal, make a final demonstration of one's wit, and/or establish a historical record of one's having done either or both (see [[James French (murderer)|James French]] and [[William Palmer (murderer)#Arrest and trial|William Palmer]] below)

* [[Arthur Gary Bishop]]: "I want to offer again my most profound and heartfelt apologies to my victims' families. I am truly sorry.

He survived by raiding garden patches with a stolen gun. When he was eventually caught, according to colonial governor [[David Collins (governor)|David Collins]], he was "so indifferent about meeting death, that he declared in confinement that if he should be hanged he would create a laugh before he was turned off, by playing some trick upon the executioner."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hughes, Robert|title=The Fatal Shore|publisher= Vintage Books|location= New York|date= 1986|page=196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2380">In naval hardware, '''fit to receive''' or fitting '''"for but not with"''' is where a weapon or system called for in a design is not installed or is only partially installed during construction, and the installation completed later as needed. This is done to reduce the vessel's build cost by not purchasing the system at the time of construction, or as a method of [[future proof]]ing a design.&lt;ref name=Friedman236/&gt; The term is usually used in regard to ships but sometimes extends to military vehicles, aircraft and other hardware.&lt;ref name=Friedman236&gt;Friedman, ''Seapower as strategy'', p. 236&lt;/ref&gt;

Provision is made physically with power supply and data wiring to a hardpoint or through software for the installation of a weapon or system which is marked for purchase at a later date, with installation during the vehicle's modernisation or refit.&lt;ref name=Friedman236/&gt;  Part of the justification for this design concept is the assumption that in the event of the system being required (such as a war), there should be enough warning time to purchase the system, install it in the vehicle, and train operators in its use.&lt;ref&gt;Leschen, ''The nature of future conflict and its impact on Australia’s defence policy and force structure'', pp. 57-8&lt;/ref&gt;

Fitting for but not with can range from leaving sufficient space for any future upgrades, to installing a weapon system during construction but not purchasing ammunition until it is needed.&lt;ref name=Friedman236/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Navy logistic support resources developments and disaster relief'', p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1373">'''François Nodot''' (c. 1650-1710) was a [[mercenary soldier]] and author of works in Latin and French. He is best known as author of [[Supplements to the Satyricon|spurious supplements]] to the text of the ''[[Satyricon]]'' of [[Petronius]].

In 1692 he announced to the French academies that he had a copy of previously unknown sections of the ''Satyricon''. The copy had been made from a manuscript found by his friend Du Pin during the [[Siege of Belgrade (1688)|siege of Belgrade]] in 1688.

Nodot published a new edition of the ''Satyricon'' at [[Paris]] in 1693. The forgery was soon suspected, but texts and translations of the ''Satyricon'' continued to incorporate Nodot's supplements until the early 20th century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8778">'''Gaius Julius Hyginus''' ({{IPAc-en|h|ᵻ|ˈ|dʒ|aɪ|n|ə|s}}; {{circa}} 64 BC – AD 17) was a [[Latin]] author, a pupil of the famous [[Alexander Polyhistor]], and a freedman of [[Augustus|Caesar Augustus]]. He was elected superintendent of the Palatine library by Augustus according to [[Suetonius' minor works|Suetonius']] ''De Grammaticis'', 20.&lt;ref&gt;Not everyone is sure that the Hyginus of ''Fabulae'' was this freedman of Augustus; for one, Edward Fitch, reviewing Herbert J. Rose, ''Hygini Fabulae'' in ''The American Journal of Philology'' '''56''',4 (1935), p. 422.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear whether Hyginus was a native of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] or of [[Alexandria]].

Suetonius remarks that he fell into great poverty in his old age, and was supported by the historian [[Clodius Licinus]]. Hyginus was a voluminous author: his works included topographical and biographical treatises, commentaries on [[Helvius Cinna]] and the poems of [[Virgil]], and disquisitions on agriculture and [[apiary|bee-keeping]]. All these are lost.

Under the name of Hyginus there are extant what are probably two sets of school notes abbreviating his treatises on [[mythology]]; one is a collection of ''Fabulae'' ("stories"), the other a "Poetical Astronomy".

==''Fabulae''==
''Fabulae'' consists of some three hundred very brief and plainly, even crudely told myths and celestial genealogies,&lt;ref&gt;"the ''Fabulae'' (more correctly ''Genealogiae'') of Hyginus", according to H. J. Rose, "Second Thoughts on Hyginus" ''[[Mnemosyne (journal)|Mnemosyne]]'', Fourth Series, '''11'''.1 (1958:42–48) p. 42; the article is in the way of a set of marginalia to Rose's edition of ''Fabulae''.&lt;/ref&gt; made by an author who was characterized by his modern editor, [[H. J. Rose]], as ''adulescentem imperitum, semidoctum, stultum''—"an ignorant youth, semi-learned, stupid"—but valuable for the use made of works of Greek writers of tragedy that are now lost. Arthur L. Keith, reviewing H. J. Rose's edition (1934) of ''Hygini Fabulae'',&lt;ref&gt;A.L. Keith, in ''The Classical Journal'' '''31'''.1  (October 1935) p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; wondered "at the caprices of Fortune who has allowed many of the plays of an [[Aeschylus]], the larger portion of [[Livy]]'s histories, and other priceless treasures to perish, while this school-boy's exercise has survived to become the ''pabulum'' of scholarly effort." Hyginus' compilation represents in primitive form what every educated Roman in the age of the Antonines was expected to know of Greek myth, at the simplest level. The ''Fabulae'' are a mine of information today, when so many more nuanced versions of the myths have been lost.

In fact the text of ''Fabulae'' was all but lost: a single surviving manuscript from the abbey of [[Freising]],&lt;ref&gt;A ''Codex Freisingensis'', noted by  Fitch, reviewing Rose, ''Hygini Fabulae'' 1934:421.&lt;/ref&gt; in a [[Beneventan script]] datable c. 900, formed the material for the first printed edition, negligently and uncritically&lt;ref&gt;A. H. F. Griffin, "Hyginus, Fabula 89 (Laomedon)" ''The Classical Quarterly'' New Series, '''36'''.2 (1986), p. 541 note.&lt;/ref&gt; transcribed by [[Jacob Micyllus]], 1535, who may have supplied it with the title we know it by. In the course of printing, following the usual practice, by which the manuscripts printed in the 15th and 16th centuries have rarely survived their treatment at the printshop, the manuscript was pulled apart: only two small fragments of it have turned up, significantly as stiffening in book bindings.&lt;ref&gt;One was discovered at Regensburg in 1864, another in Munich, 1942. Both fragments are conserved in Munich. See M.D. Reeve on Hyginus, ''Fabulae'' in L.D. Reynolds, ed., ''Texts and Transmission'' (Oxford) 1983, pp 189f.&lt;/ref&gt; Another fragmentary text, dating from the 5th century is in the Vatican Library. (Major 2002)

Among Hyginus' sources are the ''[[scholia]]'' on [[Apollonius of Rhodes]]' ''[[Argonautica]]'', which were dated to about the time of [[Tiberius]] by Apollonius' editor R. Merkel, in the preface to his edition of Apollonius (Leipzig, 1854).&lt;ref&gt;Noted by Rose 1958:42 note 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''De Astronomica'' or ''Poeticon Astronomicon'' ==
{{main|Poeticon Astronomicon}}

''De Astronomica'' was first published, with accompanying figures, by [[Erhard Ratdolt]] in Venice, 1482, under the title ''[[Poeticon astronomicon|Clarissimi uiri Hyginii Poeticon astronomicon opus utilissimum]].'' This "Poetic astronomy by the most renowned Hyginus, a most useful work," chiefly tells us the myths connected with the constellations, in versions that are chiefly based on ''[[Catasterismi]]'', a work that was traditionally attributed to [[Eratosthenes]].

Like the ''Fabulae,'' the ''Astronomica'' is a collection of abridgements, and the style and level of Latin competence and the elementary mistakes (especially in the rendering of the Greek originals) were held by the anonymous contributor to the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' (11th edition, 1911), to prove that they cannot have been the work of "so distinguished" a scholar as G. Julius Hyginus. It was further suggested that these treatises are an abridgment made in the latter half of the 2nd century of the ''Genealogiae'' of Hyginus by an unknown adapter, who added a complete treatise on mythology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Hyginus, Gaius Julius}}&lt;/ref&gt; The star lists in the ''Astronomica'' are in exactly the same order as in [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Almagest]],'' reinforcing the idea of a 2nd-century compilation.&lt;ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The lunar crater [[Hyginus (crater)|Hyginus]] and the minor planet [[12155 Hyginus]] are named after him.

The English author Sir [[Thomas Browne]] opens his discourse ''[[The Garden of Cyrus]]'' (1658) with a Creation myth sourced from the ''Fabulae'' of Hyginus.

This '''glossary of BDSM''' ('''bondage, discipline, dominance, submission, sadism, masochism''')''' terms defines terms commonly used in the [[BDSM]] community.

BDSM activities are described as ''play'' in BDSM terminology.&lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, Jay (2001) Ten Tips for the Novice, Single, Heterosexual Submissive Woman&lt;/ref&gt; 

The BDSM term is a [[portmanteau]] initialism intended to take in all of the following activities:
* [[Bondage (BDSM)|Bondage]] and [[discipline (BDSM)|discipline]] play ('''B &amp; D''' or '''B/D''')
* [[Dominance and submission (BDSM)|Dominance and submission]] ('''D &amp; S''' or '''D/s''') (including "master and slave" role-playing scenarios and ongoing relationship structures)
* [[Sadism and masochism]] ('''S &amp; M''' or '''S/M''')

==BDSM glossary==
[[File:Alsana Sin by ropemarks.jpg|thumb|[[Rope bondage]] in an uncomfortable position]]
[[Image:model-in-suspension.jpg|thumb|[[Suspension bondage]]: Horizontal suspension, face up.]]

* [[Master/slave (BDSM)|24/7]]: A relationship in which protocols are in place continuously.
* [[Animal roleplay|Animal transformation fantasy]]: Fantasy in which the focus is on the sub entering the altered mindspace of a different species, often a [[Pup-play|dog]], cat, or horse.
* [[Abrasion (BDSM)|Abrasion]]: Using something rough (such as sandpaper).
* ABDL: Adult Baby Diaper Lover, a subset of a [[DDLG]] relationship.
* [[Aftercare (BDSM)|Aftercare]]: The time after a BDSM scene or play session in which the participants calm down, discuss the previous events and their personal reactions to them, and slowly come back in touch with reality. BDSM often involves an [[endorphin]] high and very intense experience, and failure to engage in proper aftercare can lead to [[subdrop]] as these return to more everyday levels. In some BDSM relationships, such as D/s, aftercare may involve the Dominant caring for the submissive if physical pain was inflicted, such as applying [[baby oil]] to areas that were struck during play. 
* [[Ageplay]]: Usually referring to daddy/daughter or mommy/baby role play. Does not usually include or imply aspects of [[incest]], but rather the nurturing relationship of parent/child or teacher/student.
* [[Animal roleplay|Animal Play]]: The sub acts or dresses like an animal ([[Pup-play|puppy]], cat, pony, cow, etc.).
* [[Sexual slavery (BDSM)|Auctioned off]]: [[Top (BDSM)|Dominant]] auctions off the [[Slave (BDSM)|slave]] to the highest bidder (usually supervised and for temporary use).
* [[Good pain (BDSM)|Bad pain]]
*# Good pain and bad pain are terms used lightheartedly by BDSM practitioners, signifying that whilst BDSM may include an element (often quite pronounced) consensual pain, there is a purpose to it, and some pain is consented to and accepted whilst other pain is not. "Bad pain" is pain which is outside hard limits, non-mutual or non-valued, not wished for, and of limited or no value in this context.
*# Good pain and bad pain refer to pleasant vs. unpleasant pain. As a "vanilla" example, imagine soreness after a good workout at the gym versus the pain of stubbing your toe. Author [[Jay Wiseman]] suggests a correlation between perception of "bad pain" during BDSM play and subsequent injury.
* [[Bastinado]]: The act of whipping the sub's feet, usually the sub would be tied up to restrict movement as the torture is being inflicted; part of impact play.
* [[BDSM]]: Bondage/Discipline, Dominance/Submission, Sadism/Masochism: a combined acronym often used as a catchall for anything in the kink scene.
* [[Bondage (BDSM)|Bondage]]: Acts involving the physical restraint of a partner. Bondage typically refers to total restraint, however it can be limited to a particular body part, such as [[breast bondage]].
* [[Bottom (BDSM)|Bottom]]: one who receives physical sensation from a top in a scene; the one-done-to rather than the do-er.
* [[Breast bondage]]: The act of tying breasts so that they are either flattened against the chest or so that they bulge.
* [[Breast torture]]: Torture of the female [[breasts]].
* [[Breath control (BDSM)|Breath control]]: The dominant controls the submissive's breathing.
* [[Butt plug]]: Much like a dildo, but pear-shaped with a flared base. The flared base prevents the plug from being lost in the anal cavity; the pear shape helps hold the plug in place. They come in a variety of sizes; some can vibrate. Sometimes used in Petplay, with a tail attached.
* [[Chastity]]: A form of [[erotic sexual denial]] or [[orgasm denial]] whereby a person is prevented from access to, or stimulation of, their genitals, save at the whim or choice of their partner, usually by means of a device (called a [[chastity belt]] or sometimes for men a [[cock cage]]) that prevents contact and is controlled by means of a lock by the partner.
* [[Cock and ball torture]] (CBT): Torture of the male genitals for sexual gratification.
* [[Collar (BDSM)|Collared]]: Submissive or slave who is owned, usually (but certainly not exclusively) in a loving intimate relationship. A dominant may have multiple persons collared. Also: a [[Pup-play|pup's]] status, as differentiated from a "[[Animal roleplay|stray]]".
* [[Collar (BDSM)|Collaring]]: The formal acceptance by a dominant, of a sub's service, or the "ownership" of a [[Pup-play|pup]] by a Master or Trainer. Also the ceremony when a dominant commits to a sub (much like a wedding or other contract).
* [[Consent (BDSM)|Consent]]: Mutual agreement to the terms of a [[Scene (BDSM)|scene]] or ongoing BDSM relationship.
* [[Consent (BDSM)|Consensual non-consensuality]]: A mutual agreement that within defined limits, consent will be given as read without foreknowledge of the exact actions planned. As such, it is a show of trust and understanding and usually undertaken only by partners who know each other well, or otherwise agree to set clear safe limits on their activities.
* [[Contract (BDSM)|Contract]]: A written-out agreement between the dominant and submissive. It can be either formal or non, and is usually written after much negotiation by the dominant and the sub, outlining what structure, guidelines, rules and boundaries to the relationship are agreed upon by the two. It is not legally binding.
* DDLG: Daddy Dom/Little Girl, a subset of [[Dominance and submission]].
* [[Dungeon monitor|DM]]: Dungeon Monitor, a person who supervises the interactions between participants at a [[play party (BDSM)|play party]] or dungeons to enforce house rules – essentially, the bouncer of a BDSM event. They sometimes also play cruise director to keep/get the party going.
* [[Top (BDSM)|Dom]]: A person who exercises control (from [[Dominant (BDSM)|dominant]]-contrast with sub).
* [[Top (BDSM)|Dominant]] A person who exercises control – contrast with submissive.
* [[Dominatrix|Domme]]: Woman who exercises control (see also [[Dominatrix]]). Often associated with a particular brand of traditional femininity; many younger female dominants prefer to use the nongendered terms dom/dominant.
* Drop: A feeling of deflation or slight depression that comes after a kinky scene, party, convention, or conference. Usually caused by the removal of positive stimuli and the endorphins they produce either from play or being surrounded by others within the kinky community. Can happen to kinksters of any role.
* [[Dominance and submission|D/s]]: Dominance/submission: play or relationships that involve an erotic power exchange.
* [[Dungeon (BDSM)|Dungeon]]: Usually referring to a room or area with BDSM equipment and play space.
* [[Edgeplay]]: SM play that involves a chance of harm, either physically or emotionally. Because the definition of edgeplay is subjective to the specific players (i.e., what is risky for me may not be as risky for you), there is not a universal list of what is included in edgeplay. However, there are a few forms of play which almost always make the cut, including fireplay, gunplay, rough body play, breath play, and bloodplay.
* [[Erotic electrostimulation|Electro-Play]]: The practice of using electrical stimulation to the nerves of the body using a power source (such as a TENS, EMS, Violet wand, or made-for-play units) for purposes of sexual stimulation, body modification, tickling, or torture. 
* [[Endorphin|Endorphin rush]]: Endorphins are the chemicals responsible for the "high" people often get from activities such as sex, or high-risk sports, and is the body's response to heightened or intense experiences of certain kinds. BDSM activities, especially those incorporating a degree of [[sensation play]] often cultivate the endorphin rush as part of their "payoff" to the sub. But also see [[Aftercare (BDSM)|aftercare]] for the care needed to ensure that [[subdrop]] does not occur afterwards as the body returns to normal.
* [[Erotic sexual denial]]: keeping another person [[sexual arousal|aroused]] while delaying or preventing resolution of the feelings, to keep them in a continual state of anticipatory tension and inner conflict, and heightened sensitivity. (see also [[tease and denial]] and [[chastity]]).
* [[Erotic spanking]]: The act of spanking another person for the sexual arousal or gratification of either or both parties.
* [[Sexual fetishism|Fetish]]: A specific obsession or delight in one object or experience.
* [[Figging]]: The practice of inserting a piece of ginger root into the anus or vagina.
* [[Fire play]]: Using fire as an implement of BDSM. This can mean blowing the heat of a light torch onto a bottom, lighting pools of fuel on the bottom's skin, lighting flash cotton on the bottom, and other creative uses of heat. [[Cupping therapy|Cupping]] is usually considered an offshoot of fireplay, although in sensation it is closer to the use of clips and clamps. Usually considered edgeplay.
* [[Fisting]]: inserting a hand into the [[vagina]] or [[rectum]].
* [[Torture|Genitorture]]: Torture of the genitals.
* [[Good pain (BDSM)|Good pain]] (1): Good pain and bad pain are terms used lightheartedly by BDSM practitioners, signifying that whilst BDSM may include an element (often quite pronounced) of consensual pain, there is a purpose to it, and some pain is consented to and accepted whilst other pain is not. "Good pain" is therefore pain that is mutually agreed, desired or permitted by the submissive partner to be experienced, and seen by them as of enjoyment or value.
* [[Good pain (BDSM)|Good pain]] (2): Good pain and bad pain refer to perception of pain as pleasant vs. unpleasant.  Sensations that non-practitioners imagine to be painful are instead perceived and described by BDSM practitioners as pleasurable or a good form of pain, in much the way that muscles after a workout at the gym may be sore, but in a good way.  The transition of perception from "bad pain" to "good pain" may require a warm up beforehand.
* [[Urolagnia|Golden showers]]: Urinating on, or being urinated on by, another person.
* [[Gorean]]: A subgenre based upon the rituals and practices created within the world of [[Gor]] in the erotic novels by [[John Norman]]. Gorean culture is based on stereotypical gender-based roles which is considered by many to be in conflict with BDSM, where there is freedom for either gender to act in any role (Male/Female as either Dom/sub or Top/bottom).
* [[Gunplay (BDSM)|Gunplay]]: The practice of including actual (or simulated) firearms into a [[Scene (BSDM)|scene]].
* [[Handkerchief code]]s: Visible signs to indicate to others your area of BDSM interest; a color worn on the left indicates a top, on the right indicates a bottom.
* [[Limits (BDSM)|Hard limits]]: What someone absolutely will not do; non-negotiable (as opposed to "soft limits").
* [[Harem]]: A group of subs serving one or more dominants.
* [[Hogtie bondage|Hogtie]]: To tie up a submissive's wrists and ankles, fastening them together behind their back using physical restraints such as rope or cuffs.
* [[Impact play]]: Part of [[sensation play]], dealing with impact such as whips, riding crops, paddles, floggers, etc.
* [[paraphilic infantilism|Infantilism]]: Parent/child or parent/baby role playing.
* [[Animal roleplay|K-9 roleplay]]: animal roleplay where the animal being roleplayed is a dog
* [[Shibari|Kinbaku]]: Also known as Shibari which literally means "the beauty of tight binding". Kinbaku is a Japanese style of bondage or BDSM which involves tying up the bottom using simple yet visually intricate patterns, usually with several pieces of thin rope.
* [[Knife play]]: Slow, methodical sensation of the bottom with the edges and points of knives, usually without cutting the skin. Fear of the weapon plays a large part in the stimulus of the bottom.
* [[Limits (BDSM)|Limits]]: What someone will not participate in (hard limits), or is hesitant to do so (soft limits).
* Maintenance: Weekly spankings to cover the little things that might have been missed, remind the submissive to behave and allow the Dominant to release stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.allexperts.com/q/BDSM-2733/2009/1/started-1.htm|title=BDSM: getting back to where we started, candy store, strong desire|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Sadomasochism|Masochism]]: Act of receiving pain for sensual/sexual pleasure.
* [[Sadomasochism|Masochist]]: Person who enjoys pain, usually sexually.
* [[Master/slave (BDSM)|Master/slave]]: A consensual relationship in which one person receives control (the Master) when given it by another (the slave) for mutual benefit. An extreme form of [[D/s]] which usually involves a 24/7 relationship rather than a short period of time (scene or perhaps a week end.) The slave will usually accept a collar from their Master to show that they are owned.
* [[Mummification (BDSM)|Mummification]]: Immobilising the body by wrapping it up, usually with multiple layers of tight thin plastic sheeting. Breathing and other safety measures must be appropriately taken care of, often by leaving the face (or at least the mouth and nose) open. Body temperature (maintained to an extent by movement) may also be affected so a warm environment and warm aftercare may be important. Mummification is often used to enhance a feeling of total bodily helplessness, and incorporated with [[sensation play]].
* [[Munch (BDSM)|Munch]]: A group of people that are into BDSM meeting at a "vanilla" place in street-appropriate attire. Sometimes this is a club. You might see an announcement like, "This weekend's munch is at Denny's".
* [[Play piercing|Needle play]]: Temporary piercings done with sterile needles of varying gauges, usually only for the duration of a scene.
* [[Nose torture]]: A traditionally Japanese form of BDSM often involving nose hooks.
* [[Nyotaimori]]: Human sushi platters.
* [[Over The Knee|OTK]]: Over the knee (spanking).
* Painslut: A person who enjoys receiving a heavy degree of pain but may or may not necessarily enjoy submitting.
* [[Pegging (sexual practice)|Pegging]]: A sexual practice in which a woman penetrates a man's anus with a strap-on dildo.
* [[play party (BDSM)|Play party]]: A BDSM event involving many people engaging in [[Scene (BDSM)|scenes]].
* [[Dominatrix|ProDom]]: Male [[professional dominant]] (charges money).
* [[Dominatrix|ProDomme]]: Female [[professional dominant]] (charges money).
* [[Animal roleplay|Ponygirl or Ponyboy]]: Sub is dressed in a pony outfit, with mouth bit and anal plug with a tail. They are told to prance or behave like a pony.
* [[Animal roleplay|Pup-play]]: Sub is made to act like a puppy. Sub barks, whines, eats from a bowl, etc. Such play is sexual, but also focuses on the altered mind-space of bottom/pup and the complete dominance of his/her Trainer/Master.
* [[Pussy torture]]: Torture of the female genitals for sexual gratification.
* [[Risk-aware consensual kink|RACK]] – Risk Aware Consensual Kink.
* [[Rape fantasy|Rape fantasy, ravishment]]: The pleasurable fantasy of inflicting or being a victim to an act of consensual play-rape.
* [[Sadomasochism|Sadism]]: The act of inflicting pain.
* [[Sadomasochism|Sadist]]: Person who enjoys inflicting pain, usually sexually.
* [[Safe, sane and consensual]] – (SSC) a credo used by some BDSM practitioners to determine the appropriateness of BDSM play. Sometimes contrasted to RACK (risk aware consensual kink).
* [[Safeword]] – A codeword a bottom can use to force BDSM activity to stop – used especially in scenes which may involve consensual force.
* [[Coprophilia|Scat play]]: Feces play.
* [[Scene (BDSM)|Scene]]: A time period of BDSM activities. Also used to refer to the BDSM community ("the Scene").
* [[Sensation play (BDSM)|Sensation play]]: BDSM play where the intent is to push people's sensory limits, thus exploring texture, sensory deprival, through to whips, flagellation and [[edgeplay]].
* [[Service-oriented submission]]: A person who enjoys performing a service in a sexual or BDSM environment.
* [[Master/slave (BDSM)|Slave]]: A person (usually submissive) who consensually gives up total control of one or more aspects of their life to another person (their Master).
* [[Soft limits]]: Something that someone is hesitant to do or is nervous to try. They can sometimes be talked into the activity, or preferably it may be negotiated at a trial or beginner level into a scene.
* [[Subdrop]]: A physical condition, often with cold- or flu-like symptoms, experienced by a [[submissive]] after an intense session of BDSM play. This can last for as long as a week, and is best prevented by aftercare immediately after the session.
* [[Bottom (BDSM)|Submissive]], or "sub" for short. Person that gives up control either all the time or for a specified period (not to be confused with "bottom" or "slave").
* {{anchor|Subspace}}Subspace: A "natural high" that a sub (or bottom) gets during a scene or when being controlled. The sub may feel disconnected from time, space, and/or their body, and may have limited ability to communicate. It is critical that a Dom(me)/top take responsibility for the sub/bottom and be aware of their sub's well being if they are in subspace.
* [[switch (BDSM)|Switch]]: Someone who likes being both top and bottom, either in one scene or on different occasions.
* [[Taken in hand]]: 24/7 Male dominance in monogamous marriage, with or without BDSM aspects.
* [[Tease and denial]]: Keeping another person [[sexual arousal|aroused]] while delaying or preventing resolution of the feelings, to keep them in a continual state of anticipatory tension and inner conflict, and heightened sensitivity. (see also [[orgasm denial]]).
* [[Tit torture]]: The act of causing deliberate physical pain to the breasts and nipples.
* [[TNG (BDSM)|TNG]]: The Next Generation.  A tag commonly used by groups and organizations which cater to younger people involved in BDSM, typically ages 18–35.
* [[Top (BDSM)|Top]]: Person "doing the action" (contrast with bottom – person receiving the action). Not to be confused with Dom which is the person who "puts the scene together". A male Dom could enjoy [[Cock and ball torture|CBT]] and tell a sub what they are to do. In this case the Top is the submissive (following the direction of the Dom) and the bottom is the Dom (receiving the attention of the top).
* [[Top and bottom|Topping from the bottom]]: A bottom who purports to be a submissive but who nonetheless wants to direct the [[top]].
* [[Master/slave (BDSM)#Total power exchange|TPE]] or Total Power Exchange: a relationship where the dominant or owner has complete authority and influence over the submissive's life, making the majority of decisions.
* [[Training (BDSM)|Training]]: Either referring to a short period of time (a scene) or an ongoing effort of the dominant teaching the submissive how to act.
* [[Vanilla sex|Vanilla]]: Someone who is not into BDSM. Alternatively, sexual behaviour which does not encompass BDSM activity. The term is sometimes used in a derogatory sense.
* Warm up: The period at a beginning of a BDSM scene which involves gentle play, allowing the bottom to begin endorphin production, enter [[Subspace (BDSM)|subspace]], and undergo physiological changes (such as bringing fluids to the surface before impact play) that will accommodate more intense play.
* [[WIITWD]]: What It Is That We Do. A broad term referring to all forms of alternative sexuality.
* [[Wax play]]: The top drips hot wax on the bottom.

Some people in the BDSM community begin dominant terms with an upper case, for example: Top, Master, Dom, Domme, etc., as well as to begin submissive terms with a lower case, even where normally incorrect, chiefly in acronyms and abbreviations, such as D/s for Dom/sub. Some extend this to personal pronouns and names: for example Master Rob's slave linda may refer to him as Sir and herself as i (or as "this slave", restricted from using personal pronouns for herself). Others are highly dismissive of this "slashy speak."

In addition, '''high protocol''' refers to groups or individuals that adhere to strict roles and role-based rules of conduct, whereas '''low protocol''' refers to groups or individuals that are more relaxed. '''Old Guard''' now usually refers to high protocol groups, particularly gay leather BDSM groups; people who use this phrase may be romanticizing a perception of leather history: see [[Old Guard leather]].

The [[linguistics|linguist]] [[Ignace Gelb]] coined the term "'''grammatology'''" in 1952 to refer to the scientific study of [[writing systems]] or scripts.&lt;ref&gt;Gelb, Ignace. 1952. ''A Study of Writing''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt; Grammatology can examine the typology of scripts, the analysis of the structural properties of scripts, and the relationship between written and spoken [[language]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniels, Peter T. 1996. The study of writing systems.  In Daniels, Peter T. and Bright, William, eds., ''The World's Writing Systems'', pp. 1-17.  New York: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;  In its broadest sense, some scholars also include the study of [[literacy]] in grammatology and, indeed, the impact of writing on philosophy, religion, science, administration and other aspects of the organization of society.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Wilhelm Küster: "Geordnetes Weltbild. Die Tradition des alphabetischen Sortierens von der Keilschrift bis zur EDV. Eine Kulturgeschichte". Niemeyer: Tübingen, 2006/2007,p. 19f&lt;/ref&gt;

The scholars most immediately associated with grammatology, understood as the history and theory of writing, include [[Eric Havelock]] (''The Muse Learns to Write''), [[Walter J. Ong]] (''Orality and Literacy''), [[Jack Goody]] (''Domestication of the Savage Mind''), not to mention [[Marshall McLuhan]] (''[[The Gutenberg Galaxy]]''). Grammatology brings to any topic a consideration of the contribution of technology and the material and social apparatus of language. A more theoretical treatment of the approach may be seen in the works of [[Friedrich Kittler]] (''Discourse Networks: 1800/1900'') and [[Avital Ronell]] (''The Telephone Book'').

== Deconstructionism ==
In 1967 the [[deconstruction]]ist philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]] borrowed the term, but put it to different use, in his book ''[[Of Grammatology]]''. Derrida aimed to show that writing is not simply a reproduction of speech, but that the way in which thoughts are recorded in writing strongly affects the nature of knowledge. Deconstruction from a grammatological perspective places the history of philosophy in general, and metaphysics in particular, in the context of writing as such. In this perspective metaphysics is understood as a category or classification system relative to the invention of alphabetic writing and its institutionalization in School. Plato's Academy, and Aristotle's Lyceum, are as much a part of the invention of literacy as is the introduction of the vowel to create the Classical Greek alphabet. [[Gregory Ulmer]] took up this trajectory, from historical to philosophical grammatology, to add applied grammatology (''Applied Grammatology:  Post(e)-Pedagogy from Jacques Derrida to [[Joseph Beuys]]'', Johns Hopkins, 1985). Ulmer coined the term "[[electracy]]" to call attention to the fact that digital technologies and their elaboration in new media forms are part of an apparatus that is to these inventions what literacy is to alphabetic and print technologies. Grammatology studies the invention of an apparatus across the spectrum of its manifestations—technology, institutional practices, and identity behaviors. [[Marc Wilhelm Küster]] combines Derrida's approach with Gelbs's study of writing to build a more inclusive view of the interaction between writing and our ways of viewing the world.

== Structuralism and post-structuralism ==
Most common forms of literary writing is [[structuralism]] and [[post-structuralism]]. Swiss linguist [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] was considered to be a key figure in structural approaches to language.&lt;ref&gt;Barry, P., 1995, ''Beginning Theory – An introduction to Literary and Cultural Theory'', Manchester University Press, Manchester&lt;/ref&gt; Saussure writes, 'Language and writing are two distinct systems of signs; the second exists for the sole purpose of representing the first.'&lt;ref&gt;Derrida, J., 1976, ''Of Grammatology'', The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Barry explains this well in his book, the ''Beginning Theory''.

In the 1960s, post-structuralism sprang into existence with [[Roland Barthes]] and [[Jacques Derrida]], two of the major contributors to this movement. Barthes' writing has been described as interesting as one can see the transition of these two literary styles through comparing his earlier works with his later work. His early work is methodical and very structured in its delivery, Barthes' work then morphs into writing that has been described as random in sequence and unfocused, which is a key characteristics of post-structuralistic writing; Jacques Derrida published much work in the subject of literary theory but most were considered to be more philosophical than based on literary itself. However one of the most influential texts on post-structuralism is ''Of Grammatology'', a book that Jacques Derrida wrote. This book had a famous slogan of 'There is nothing outside the text' and is today one of the most quoted lines when discussing grammatology. This opinion of Derrida is quite different from that of Saussure who believes the meaning in words is outside the text.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10731">'''IBM alignment models''' are a sequence of increasingly complex models used in [[statistical machine translation]] to train a translation model and an alignment model, starting with lexical translation probabilities and moving to reordering and word duplication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.statmt.org/survey/Topic/IBMModels | title = IBM Models | date = 11 September 2015 | publisher = SMT Research Survey Wiki | access-date = 26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have underpinned the majority of statistical machine translation systems for almost twenty years. These models offer principled probabilistic formulation and (mostly) tractable inference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/yarin/PDFs/PY-IBM_presentation.pdf | authors = Yarin Gal, Phil Blunsom | title = A Systematic Bayesian Treatment of the IBM Alignment Models | date = 12 June 2013 | publisher = University of Cambridge | access-date = 26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original work on statistical machine translation at [[IBM]] proposed five models, and a model 6 was proposed later. The sequence of the six models can be summarized as:

* Model 1: lexical translation
* Model 2: additional absolute alignment model 
* Model 3: extra fertility model
* Model 4: added relative alignment model
* Model 5: fixed deficiency problem.
* Model 6: Model 4 combined with a [[Hidden Markov model|HMM]] alignment model in a log linear way

== Model 1 ==

IBM Model 1 is weak in terms of conducting reordering or adding and dropping words. In most cases, words that follow each other in one language would have a different order after translation, but IBM Model 1 treats all kinds of reordering as equally possible.

Another problem while aligning is the fertility (the notion that input words would produce a specific number of output words after translation). In most cases one input word will be translated into one single word, but some words will produce multiple words or even get dropped (produce no words at all). The fertility of word models addresses this aspect of translation. While adding additional components increases the complexity of models, the main principles of IBM Model 1 are constant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wołk | first1 = K. | last2 = Marasek | first2 = K. | title = Real-Time Statistical Speech Translation | url = | journal = Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing | publisher = Springer | volume = 275 | pages = 107–114 | issn = 2194-5357 | isbn = 978-3-319-05950-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Model 2 ==

The IBM Model 2 has an additional model for alignment that is not present in Model 1. For example, using only IBM Model 1 the translation probabilities for these translations would be the same: 
[[File:IBM models 01.jpg|none]]
The IBM Model 2 addressed this issue by modeling the translation of a foreign input word in position &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; to a native language word in position &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; using an alignment probability distribution defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;a(i\lor j,l_e,l_f)&lt;/math&gt;

In the above equation, the length of the input sentence f is denoted as l&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;, and the length of the translated sentence e as l&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;. The translation done by IBM Model 2 can be presented as a process divided into two steps (lexical translation and alignment).
[[File:IBM models 02.jpg|none]]
Assuming &lt;math&gt;t(e\mid f)&lt;/math&gt; is the translation probability and &lt;math&gt;a(i\lor j,l_e,l_f)&lt;/math&gt; is the alignment probability, IBM Model 2 can be defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;p(e,a\mid f)=\in \prod_{j=1}^{l_e} t(e_{j}\lor f_{a\mid j})a(a(j)\lor j,l_e,l_f)&lt;/math&gt;

In this equation, the alignment function &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; maps each output word &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; to a foreign input position &lt;math&gt;a(j)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Och | first1 = Franz Josef | last2 = Ney | first2 = Hermann | title = A systematic comparison of various statistical alignment models | journal = Computational linguistics | year = 2003 | issue = 29 | pages = 19–51 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Model 3 ==

The fertility problem is addressed in IBM Model 3. The fertility is modeled using probability distribution defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;n(\phi \lor f)&lt;/math&gt;

For each foreign word &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;, such distribution indicates to how many output words &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; it usually translates. This model deals with dropping input words because it allows &lt;math&gt;\phi=0&lt;/math&gt;. But there is still an issue when adding words. For example, the English word ''do'' is often inserted when negating. This issue generates a special ''NULL'' token that can also have its fertility modeled using a conditional distribution defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;n(\varnothing \lor NULL)&lt;/math&gt;

The number of inserted words depends on sentence length. This is why the NULL token insertion is modeled as an additional step: the fertility step. It increases the IBM Model 3 translation process to four steps:
[[File:IBM models 03.jpg|none]]
The last step is called distortion instead of alignment because it is possible to produce the same translation with the same alignment in different ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference | author = Wołk K., Marasek K. | year = 2014 | title = Polish-English Speech Statistical Machine Translation Systems for the IWSLT 2014 | conference = Proceedings of the 11th International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation, Lake Tahoe, USA }}&lt;/ref&gt;

IBM Model 3 can be mathematically expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt;P(S\mid E,A)=\prod_{i=1}^{I} \Phi_i!n(\Phi \mid e_j)*\prod_{j=1}^{J}t(f_j \mid e_{a_j})*\prod_{j:a(j)\neq 0}^{J}d(j\mid a_j,I,J)*(\begin{array}{c} J-\Phi_0 \\ \Phi_0 \end{array})p_0^{\Phi_0}p_1^J&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Phi_i&lt;/math&gt; represents the fertility of &lt;math&gt;e_i&lt;/math&gt;, each source word &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is assigned a fertility distribution &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; refer to the absolute lengths of the target and source sentences, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;FERNÁNDEZ, Pablo Malvar. Improving Word-to-word Alignments Using Morphological Information. 2008. PhD Thesis. San Diego State University.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Model 4 ==

In IBM Model 4, each word is dependent on the previously aligned word and on the word classes of the surrounding words. Some words tend to get reordered during translation more than others (e.g. adjective–noun inversion when translating Polish to English). Adjectives often get moved before the noun that precedes them. The word classes introduced in Model 4 solve this problem by conditioning the probability distributions of these classes. The result of such distribution is a lexicalized model. Such a distribution can be defined as follows:

For the initial word in the cept: &lt;math&gt;d_1(j-\odot_{[i-1]}\lor A(f_{[i-1]}),B(e_j))&lt;/math&gt;

For additional words: &lt;math&gt;d_1(j-\pi_{i,k-1}\lor B(e_j))&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;A(f)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B(e)&lt;/math&gt; functions map words to their word classes, and &lt;math&gt;e_{j}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f_{[i-1]}&lt;/math&gt; are distortion probability distributions of the words. The cept is formed by aligning each input word &lt;math&gt;f_i&lt;/math&gt; to at least one output word.&lt;ref name="Schoenemann"&gt;{{Cite conference | author = Schoenemann, Thomas | year = 2010 | title = Computing optimal alignments for the IBM-3 translation model | conference = Proceedings of the Fourteenth Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning | publisher = Association for Computational Linguistics | pages = 98–106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Model 3 and Model 4 ignore if an input position was chosen and if the probability mass was reserved for the input positions outside the sentence boundaries. It is the reason for the probabilities of all correct alignments not sum up to unity in these two models (deficient models).&lt;ref name="Schoenemann" /&gt;

== Model 5 ==

IBM Model 5 reformulates IBM Model 4 by enhancing the alignment model with more training parameters in order to overcome the model deficiency.&lt;ref&gt;KNIGHT, Kevin. A statistical MT tutorial workbook. Manuscript prepared for the 1999 JHU Summer Workshop, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; During the translation in Model 3 and Model 4 there are no heuristics that would prohibit the placement of an output word in a position already taken. In Model 5 it is important to place words only in free positions. It is done by tracking the number of free positions and allowing placement only in such positions. The distortion model is similar to IBM Model 4, but it is based on free positions. If &lt;math&gt;v_j&lt;/math&gt; denotes the number of free positions in the output, the IBM Model 5 distortion probabilities would be defined as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = Peter F. | title = The mathematics of statistical machine translation: Parameter estimation | journal = Computational linguistics | year = 1993 | issue = 19 | pages = 263–311 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the initial word in the cept:  &lt;math&gt;d_1(v_j\lor B(e_j),v_{\odot i-1},v_{max})&lt;/math&gt;

For additional words:  &lt;math&gt;d_1(v_{j}-v_{\pi_{i,k-1}}\lor B(e_j),v_{max'})&lt;/math&gt;

The alignment models that use first-order dependencies like the HMM or IBM Models 4 and 5 produce better results than the other alignment methods. The main idea of HMM is to predict the distance between subsequent source language positions. On the other hand, IBM Model 4 tries to predict the distance between subsequent target language positions. Since it was expected to achieve better alignment quality when using both types of such dependencies, HMM and Model 4 were combined in a log-linear manner in Model 6 as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~ivan.vulic/Files/TASOA.pdf | author = Vulić I. | title = Term Alignment. State of the Art Overview | year = 2010 | publisher = Katholieke Universiteit Leuven | accessdate = 26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;p_6(f,a\lor e)= \frac{p_4(f,a\lor e)^\alpha*p_{HMM}(f,a\lor e)}{\sum_{a',f'} p_4(f',a'\lor e)^\alpha*p_{HMM}(f',a'\lor e)}&lt;/math&gt;

where the interpolation parameter &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is used in order to count the weight of Model 4 relatively to the [[hidden Markov model]]. A log-linear combination of several models can be defined as &lt;math&gt;p_k (f, a \mid e)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;k=1,2,\dotsc,K&lt;/math&gt; as:

:&lt;math&gt;p_6(f,a\lor e)=\frac{\prod_{k=1}^{K}p_k(f,a\lor e)^{\alpha_{k}}}{\sum_{a',f'}\prod_{k=1}^{K}p_k(f',a'\mid e)^{\alpha_{k}}}&lt;/math&gt;

The log-linear combination is used instead of linear combination because the &lt;math&gt;P_r (f, a \mid e)&lt;/math&gt; values are typically different in terms of their orders of magnitude for HMM and IBM Model 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wołk | first1 = K. | title = Noisy-Parallel and Comparable Corpora Filtering Methodology for the Extraction of Bi-Lingual Equivalent Data at Sentence Level | journal = Computer Science | year = 2015 | issue = 16.2 | pages = 169–184 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Interexchange carrier''' ('''IXC''') is a U.S. legal and regulatory term for a [[telecommunication]] company, commonly called a '''long-distance telephone company'''. It is defined as any carrier that provides services across multiple [[local access and transport area]]s (interLATA). Calls made on telephone circuits within the local geographic area covered by one local network are handled only by that [[intraLATA]] carrier, commonly called a local telephone exchange carrier. Local calls are usually defined by connections made without additional charge whether the connected call is in the same LATA or connects to another LATA with no charge. IntraLATA usually refers to rated or toll calls between LATA within state boundaries, as opposed to interstate, or calls between LATAs in different states.

==Call handling==
An IXC carries traffic, usually voice traffic, between [[telephone exchange]]s. Telephone exchanges are usually identified in the United States by the [[LATA]] indicated by three-digit area code (NPA) and the first three digits of the phone number (NPA-NXX) within the LATA. Different exchanges generally cover different geographic locations, connected as separate [[telephone exchange|central office]]s (COs, also called "wire centers").

IXCs originally carried [[Circuit switching|voice traffic on analog lines]], but voice traffic has since become largely digitized. Therefore, voice traffic is more typically a data stream and can be intermixed with data traffic such as uplinks for [[DSL]]. Most commonly, links between IXCs and COs are [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode|ATM]] links carried on [[optical fiber]].

For voice traffic transfer, IXCs use softswitches and VoIP protocols and error correction.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} [[ITSP]]s can thereby connect between VoIP to [[Landline|POTS]], computer to computer, computer to phone, and [[Internet protocol|IP]] devices to other phone services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Softswitches in general|url=http://www.ixc.ua/telecom-industry-concepts|publisher=IXC|date=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Carrier identification code ==
Each carrier (interexchange or local exchange) is assigned a four-digit identification code, the '''Carrier Identification Code''' ('''CIC''') which was used with [[feature group]]s. The interexchange carrier to which calls from a subscriber line are routed by default is known as the '''Presubscribed Interexchange Carrier''' ('''PIC'''). To give telephone users the possibility of opting for a different carrier on a call-by-call basis, '''Carrier Access Codes''' ('''CAC''') were devised. These consist of the digits 101 followed by the four-digit CIC. The CAC is dialed as a prefix immediately before dialing a long-distance phone number.

In popular usage, CACs are often referred to as '''dial-around codes''' (because they allow dialing around the PIC). Sometimes they are even called "PIC codes", though this term is inaccurate, since the code is being used to ''avoid'' the PIC, not to use its services.

When CICs were first introduced in 1983, they were only three digits long, and the CAC consisted of the digits 10 followed by the three-digit CIC. In 1998, the CIC had to be extended to four digits. Existing carriers' codes were prefixed with 10. Thus, a pre-1998 CAC of the form 10-XXX became 101-0XXX.&lt;ref&gt;See the [http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Common_Carrier/FAQ/cic_faq.html FCC's FAQ] on the subject.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the CACs starting with 10-10 are generally the oldest and best-known ones, CACs are sometimes referred to as '''10-10 codes'''.

Use of CACs is popular with telephone users who wish to avoid paying a regular monthly fee for access to inexpensive long-distance service. They can also be useful if encountering a "circuits busy" condition when all long distance trunks are tied up; a CAC allows selection of an alternate carrier, which may have other open long-distance trunks.  This feature gave rise to ''[[telephone slamming|slamming]]'' and the lesser known ''[[Cramming (fraud)|cramming]]'' technique of [[telephone fraud]].

As multiple competitive long-distance carriers have been permitted in countries other than the United States, schemes similar to the CIC/CAC have spread worldwide. They are now used in (among other countries) Canada, Germany, and Japan.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Although CACs are no longer widely used, PICs and CICs are still common.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

A '''Jacobin''' ({{IPA-fr|ʒakɔbɛ̃}}) was a member of the [[Jacobin Club]], a revolutionary political movement that was the most famous political club during the [[French Revolution]] (1789–99).&lt;ref&gt;Tony Judt. Marxism and the ''French Left: Studies on Labour and Politics in France, 1830–1981''. New York, New York, USA; London, England, UK: New York University Press, 2011. Pp. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; The club was so called from the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] convent where they originally met, in the [[Rue Saint-Jacques, Paris|Rue Saint-Jacques]] (Latin: ''Jacobus'') in Paris. Today, the terms "Jacobin"  and "Jacobinism" are used in a variety of senses. Jacobin is sometimes used in Britain as a pejorative for [[Radicalism (historical)|radical]], [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] revolutionary politics ({{IPAc-en|lang|pron|ˈ|dʒ|æ|k|ə|b|ᵻ|n}}), especially when it exhibits dogmatism and violent repression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Charles Brockden Brown|author2=Philip Barnard, ed.|author3=Stephen Shapiro, ed.|title=Charles Brockden Brown's Wieland, Ormond, Arthur Mervyn, and Edgar Huntly|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J6otAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA360|year=2009|publisher=Hackett Publishing|page=360}}&lt;/ref&gt; In France, Jacobin now generally indicates a supporter of a centralized republican state and strong central government powers&lt;ref&gt;Alain Rey, Dictionnaire historique de la langue française, Le Robert, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; and/or supporters of extensive government intervention to transform society.

==In the French Revolution==
The Jacobin Club was one of several organizations that grew out of the French Revolution and it was distinguished for its [[Left-wing_politics|left-wing]], revolutionary politics.&lt;ref name="Rudé"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rudé |first=George |authorlink=George Rudé |date=1988 |title=The French Revolution}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, the Jacobins, unlike other sects like the [[Girondins]], were closely allied to the [[sans-culottes]], who were a popular force of working-class Parisians that played a pivotal role in the development of the revolution. The Jacobins had a significant presence in the National Convention, and were dubbed 'the Mountain' for their seats in the uppermost part of the chamber. Eventually, the Revolution coalesced around the Mountain's power, with the help of the insurrections of the sans-culottes, and, led by [[Robespierre]], the Jacobins established a revolutionary dictatorship, or the joint domination of the [[Committee of Public Safety]] and [[Committee of General Security]]. The Jacobin dictatorship was known for enacting the [[Reign of Terror]], which targeted speculators, [[monarchists]], right-wing agitators, [[Hébertists]], and traitors, and led to many beheadings.

The Jacobins were known for creating a strong government that could deal with the needs of war, economic chaos, and internal rebellion (such as the [[War in the Vendée]]). The Jacobins supported the rights of property, but represented a much more middle-class position than the government which succeeded them in [[Thermidorian Reaction|Thermidor]]. Their economic policy established the [[General maximum]], in order to control prices and create stability both for the workers and poor and the revolution. They favored free trade and a liberal economy much like the Girondists, but their relationship to the people made them more willing to adopt interventionist economic policies.&lt;ref name="Rudé"/&gt;{{rp|81–82}}

==United Kingdom==
In England, the word was also popularized in [[George Canning]]'s newspaper, ''The [[Anti-Jacobin]], or Weekly Examiner'', which criticized the [[Radicals (UK)|English Radical]]s, of the 18th and 19th centuries.

The English who supported the French Revolution during its early stages (or even throughout) were early known as ''Jacobins''. These included the young [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], [[William Wordsworth]], and others prior to their disillusionment with the outbreak of the [[Reign of Terror]]. Others, such as [[William Hazlitt]] and [[Thomas Paine]], remained idealistic about the Revolution. Much detail on English Jacobinism can be found in [[E.&amp;nbsp;P.&amp;nbsp;Thompson]]'s ''[[The Making of the English Working Class]]''. Welsh Jacobins include [[William Jones (Welsh radical)|William Jones]], a radical patriot who was a keen disciple of [[Voltaire]]. Rather than preaching revolution, Jones believed that an exodus from Wales was required and that a new Welsh colony should be founded in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=John |editor1-last=Davies|editor1-link=John Davies (historian)|editor2-first=Nigel |editor2-last=Jenkins | editor2-link=Nigel Jenkins| editor3-first=Baines |editor3-last=Menna|editor4-first=Peredur I. |editor4-last=Lynch|title=The Welsh Academy Encyclopaedia of Wales |year=2008 |publisher=University of Wales Press |location=Cardiff|page=434 |isbn=978-0-7083-1953-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Austria==
In the correspondence of [[Klemens Wenzel, Prince von Metternich|Metternich]] and other leaders of the repressive policies that followed the second fall of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] in 1815, ''Jacobin'' is the term commonly applied to anyone with [[liberalism|liberal]] tendencies, such as the emperor [[Alexander I of Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Jacobins, The |volume=15 |page=119 |first=Walter Alison |last=Phillips |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
Early [[Federalist Party|Federalist]]-leaning American newspapers during the French Revolution referred to the [[Democratic-Republican]] party as the "Jacobin Party". The most notable examples are the ''[[Gazette of the United States]]'', published in Philadelphia, and the ''[[Delaware and Eastern Shore Advertiser]]'', published in Wilmington, during the elections of 1798.

In modern American politics, the term Jacobin is often used to describe extremists of any party who demand ideological purity. For instance, in the lead-up to the [[1964&amp;nbsp;Republican National Convention]], the press referred to supporters of the insurgent [[Arizona]] conservative [[Barry Goldwater]] as "Cactus Jacobins" in their effort to unseat the moderate [[Eastern United States|East Coast]] branch of the party (see [[Rockefeller Republican]]).&lt;ref name="donaldson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Donaldson|first=Gary|title=Liberalism's Last Hurrah: The Presidential Campaign of 1964|year=2003|publisher=Sharpe|isbn=0765611198|pages=174|location=Armonk, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[L. Brent Bozell, Jr.]] has written in Goldwater's seminal ''[[The Conscience of a Conservative]]'' (1960) that "Throughout history, [[No true Scotsman|true Conservatism]] has been at war equally with autocrats and with 'democratic' Jacobins."&lt;ref name="goldwater"&gt;{{cite book|last=Goldwater|first=Barry M.|title=The Conscience of a Conservative|location=Shepherdsville, KY|publisher=Victor Publishing Company|year=1960|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 a radical American publication, ''[[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]]'', was founded.

===Tea Party===
In 2008–2010, the term was employed and started as a movement for presidential hopeful Ron Paul before being taken over by mainstream conservatives. For example, Eve Fairbanks described right-wing opponents of moderate Republican Congressman [[Wayne Gilchrest]] as "Jacobin conservatives" in ''[[The New Republic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Eve |last=Fairbanks |title=Unsafe At Any District |url=http://www.tnr.com/politics/story.html?id=56a3ea96-037a-45a3-9885-4558580577f9 |work=[[The New Republic]] |publisher=[[Canwest]] |date=5 November 2008 |accessdate=24 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 27 May 2010 issue of ''The New York Review of Books'', [[Columbia University|Columbia]] professor Mark Lilla analyzed five recent books dealing with American political party discontent in a review titled "The Tea Party Jacobins".&lt;ref&gt;"The Tea Party Jacobins", Mark Lilla, ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', 27 May 2010, p.53&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allegorical usage==
The conventionalized scrawny, French revolutionary ''[[sans-culottes]]'' Jacobin, was developed from about 1790 by British [[satire|satirical]] artists [[James Gillray]], [[Thomas Rowlandson]] and [[George Cruikshank]]. It was commonly contrasted with the stolid stocky conservative and well-meaning [[John Bull]], dressed like an English country squire. [[C.&amp;nbsp;L.&amp;nbsp;R.&amp;nbsp;James]] also used the term to refer to revolutionaries during the [[Haitian Revolution]] in his book ''[[The Black Jacobins]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="108725">'''[[Japanese language|Japanese]]''' is a [[synthetic language]] with a regular [[agglutination|agglutinative]] subject-object-verb ([[Subject–object–verb|SOV]]) morphology, with both productive and fixed elements. In language typology, it has many features divergent from most European languages. Its phrases are exclusively [[head-final]] and compound sentences are exclusively left-[[branching (linguistics)|branching]].&lt;ref&gt;In contrast, [[Romance languages]] such as [[Spanish language|Spanish]] are strongly right-branching, and [[Germanic languages]] such as [[English language|English]] are weakly right-branching&lt;/ref&gt; There are many [[subject–object–verb|such languages]], but few in Europe. It is a [[topic-prominent language]].

==Some distinctive aspects of modern Japanese sentence structure==

===Word order: head final and left branching===
The modern theory of constituent order ("word order"), usually attributed to [[Joseph Greenberg]], identifies several kinds of phrase. Each one has a '''head''' and possibly a modifier. The head of a phrase either precedes its modifier (head initial) or follows it (head final). Some of these phrase types, with the head marked in boldface, are:
*genitive phrase, i.e., noun modified by another noun ("the '''cover''' of the book", "the book's '''cover'''");
*noun governed by an [[Preposition and postposition|adposition]] ("'''on''' the table", "'''underneath''' the table");
*comparison ("[X is] '''bigger''' than Y", i.e., "compared to Y, X is '''big'''").
*noun modified by an adjective ("black '''cat'''").

Some languages are inconsistent in constituent order, having a mixture of head initial phrase types and head final phrase types. Looking at the preceding list, English for example is mostly head initial, but nouns ''follow'' the adjectives which modify them. Moreover, genitive phrases can be either head initial or head final in English. Japanese, by contrast, is the epitome of a head final language:
*genitive phrase: "猫の'''色'''" (neko no '''iro'''), cat GEN color = "the cat's (''neko no'') '''color''' (''iro'')";
*noun governed by an ''adposition'':日本'''に''' (nihon '''ni'''), Japan in = "'''in''' Japan";
*comparison: "Yより'''大きい'''" (Y yori '''ookii'''), Y than big = "'''big'''ger than Y";
*noun modified by an adjective: "黒'''猫'''" (kuro '''neko''') = "black '''cat'''".

Head finality in Japanese sentence structure carries over to the building of sentences using other sentences. In sentences that have other sentences as constituents, the subordinated sentences (relative clauses, for example), always ''precede'' what they refer to, since they are modifiers and what they modify has the syntactic status of phrasal head.  Translating the phrase ''the man who was walking down the street'' into Japanese word order would be ''street down walking was man''. (Note that Japanese has no articles, and the different word order obviates any need for the relative pronoun ''who''.)

Head finality prevails also when sentences are coordinated instead of subordinated. In the world's languages, it is common to avoid repetition between coordinated clauses by optionally deleting a constituent common to the two parts, as in ''Bob bought his mother some flowers and his father a tie'', where the second ''bought'' is omitted. In Japanese, such "gapping" must precede in the reverse order: ''Bob mother for some flowers and father for tie bought''. The reason for this is that in Japanese, sentences (other than occasional inverted sentences or sentences containing afterthoughts) always end in a verb (or other predicative words like adjectival verbs, adjectival nouns, auxiliary verbs)—the only exceptions being a few particles such as ''ka'', ''ne'', and ''yo''. ''ka'' turns a statement into a question, while the other sentence-final particles express the speaker's attitude towards the statement.

===Word class system===
Japanese has five major '''lexical''' [[word class]]es:
*nouns
*verbal nouns (correspond to English gerunds like 'studying', 'jumping', which denote activities)
*nominal adjectives (names vary, also called ''na''-adjectives or "adjectival nouns")
*verbs
*adjectives (so-called ''i''-adjectives)
More broadly, there are two classes: uninflectable (nouns, including verbal nouns and adjectival nouns) and inflectable (verbs, with adjectives as [[defective verb]]s). To be precise, a verbal noun is simply a noun to which {{Nihongo||する|suru|"do"}} can be appended, while an adjectival noun is like a noun but uses {{Nihongo||〜な|-na}} instead of {{Nihongo||〜の|-no}} when acting attributively. Adjectives (''i''-adjectives) inflect identically to the negative form of verbs, which end in {{Nihongo||ない|na-i}}. Compare {{Nihongo||食べない|tabe-na-i|don't eat}} → {{Nihongo||食べなかった|tabe-na-katta|didn't eat}} and {{Nihongo||熱い|atsu-i|is hot}} → {{Nihongo||熱かった|atsu-katta|was hot}}.

Some scholars, such as [[Eleanor Harz Jorden]], refer to adjectives instead as '''adjectivals''', since they are grammatically distinct from adjectives: they can [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]] a sentence. That is, {{Nihongo||熱い|atsui}} is glossed as "hot" when modifying a noun phrase, as in {{Nihongo||熱いご飯|atsui gohan|hot food}}, but as "''is'' hot" when predicating, as in {{Nihongo||ご飯は熱い|gohan wa atsui|[the] food is hot}}.

The two [[inflection|inflected]] classes, verb and adjective, are [[closed class]]es, meaning they do not readily gain new members.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Uehara|Uehara]], p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Dixon|1977|p=48}} Instead, new and borrowed verbs and adjectives are conjugated [[periphrasis|periphrastically]] as verbal noun + ''suru'' (e.g. {{Nihongo||勉強する|benkyō suru|do studying; study}}) and adjectival noun + ''na''. This differs from [[Indo-European languages]], where verbs and adjectives are [[Open class (linguistics)|open classes]], though analogous "do" constructions exist, including English "do a favor", "do the twist" or French "faire un footing" (do a "footing", go for a jog), and periphrastic constructions are common for other senses, like "try climbing" (verbal noun) or "try parkour" (noun). Other languages where verbs are a closed class include [[Basque language|Basque]]: new [[Basque verbs]] are only formed periphrastically. Conversely, pronouns are closed classes in Western languages but open classes in Japanese and some other [[East Asian languages]].

In a few cases new verbs are created by appending {{Nihongo||〜る|-ru}} to a noun or using it to replace the end of a word. This is most often done with borrowed words, and results in a word written in a mixture of katakana (stem) and hiragana (inflectional ending), which is otherwise very rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://japaneselevelup.com/homage-to-るru-the-magical-verbifier/ |title=Homage to る(ru), The Magical Verbifier |date= 2011-07-18 |author=[http://japaneselevelup.com/author/adshap8/ Adam]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is typically casual, with the most well-established example being {{Nihongo||[[:ja:サボる|サボる]]|sabo-ru|cut class; play hooky}} (circa 1920), from {{Nihongo||サボタージュ|sabotāju|sabotage}}, with other common examples including {{Nihongo||メモる|memo-ru|write a memo}}, from {{Nihongo||メモ|memo|memo}}, and {{Nihongo||ミスる|misu-ru|make a mistake}} from {{Nihongo||ミス|misu|mistake}}. In cases where the borrowed word already ends with a {{Nihongo||ル|ru}}, this may be punned to a {{Nihongo||る|ru}}, as in {{Nihongo||ググる|gugu-ru|to [[google (verb)|google]]}}, from {{Nihongo||グーグル|Google}}, and {{Nihongo||ダブる|dabu-ru|to double}}, from {{Nihongo||ダブル|daburu|double}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title =「ディスる」「タクる」は70%が聞いたことがないと回答　国語世論調査で判明|trans-title=70% of Japanese people have never heard of the words ''taku-ru'' and ''disu-ru''.  |url = http://nlab.itmedia.co.jp/nl/articles/1409/25/news148.html | accessdate = 2016-01-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

New adjectives are extremely rare; one example is {{Nihongo||黄色い|kiiro-i|yellow}}, from adjectival noun {{Nihongo||黄色|kiiro}}, and a more casual recent example is {{Nihongo||きもい|kimo-i|gross}}, by contraction of {{Nihongo||気持ち悪い|kimochi waru-i|bad-feeling}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/9012/languages-with-different-open-and-closed-word-classes Languages with different open and closed word classes]&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, in Old Japanese {{Nihongo||〜しき|-shiki}} adjectives (precursors of present ''i''-adjectives ending in {{Nihongo||〜しい|-shi-i}}, formerly a different word class) were open, as reflected in words like {{Nihongo||痛々しい|ita-ita-shi-i|pitiful}}, from the adjective {{Nihongo||痛い|ita-i|painful, hurt}}, and {{Nihongo||神々しい|kō-gō-shi-i|heavenly, sublime}}, from the noun {{Nihongo||神|kami|god}} (with sound change). Japanese adjectives are unusual in being closed class but quite numerous – about 700 adjectives – while most languages with closed class adjectives have very few.&lt;ref&gt;''The Typology of Adjectival Predication,'' Harrie Wetzer, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ORUUwhdDPpUC&amp;pg=PA311 p. 311]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guide96"&gt;''The Art of Grammar: A Practical Guide,'' Alexandra Y. Aikhenvald, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XFBVBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA96 p. 96]&lt;/ref&gt; Some believe this is due to a grammatical change of inflection from an aspect system to a tense system, with adjectives predating the change.

The [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] of ''i''-adjectives has similarities to the conjugation of verbs, unlike Western languages where inflection of adjectives, where it exists, is more likely to have similarities to the [[declension]] of nouns. Verbs and adjectives being closely related is unusual from the perspective of English, but is a common case across languages generally, and one may consider Japanese adjectives as a kind of [[stative verb]].

Japanese vocabulary has a large layer of [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary|Chinese loanwords]], nearly all of which go back more than one thousand years, yet virtually none of them are verbs or "''i''-adjectives" – they are all nouns, of which some are verbal nouns (''suru'') and some are adjectival nouns (''na''). In addition to the basic verbal noun + ''suru'' form, verbal nouns with a single-character root often experienced sound changes, such as {{Nihongo||〜する|-suru}} → {{Nihongo||〜ずる|-zuru}} → {{Nihongo||〜じる|-jiru}}, as in {{Nihongo||禁じる|kin-jiru|forbid}}, and some cases where the stem underwent sound change, as in {{Nihongo||達する|tassuru|reach}}, from {{Nihongo||達|tatsu}}.

Verbal nouns are uncontroversially nouns, having only minor syntactic differences to distinguish them from pure nouns like 'mountain'. There are some minor distinctions within verbal nouns, most notably that some primarily conjugate as {{Nihongo||〜をする|-wo suru}} (with a particle), more like nouns, while others primarily conjugate as {{Nihongo||〜する|-suru}}, and others are common either way. For example, {{Nihongo||経験をする|keiken wo suru|to experience}} is much more common than {{Nihongo||経験する|keiken suru}}, while {{Nihongo||勘弁する|kanben suru|to pardon}} is much more common than {{Nihongo||勘弁をする|kanben wo suru}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aveneca.com/cbb/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=3855 Closed and open classes in Natlangs (Especially Japanese)]&lt;/ref&gt; Nominal adjectives have more syntactic differences versus pure nouns, and traditionally were considered more separate, but they, too, are ultimately a subcategory of nouns.

There are a few minor word classes that are related to adjectival nouns, namely the [[taru adjective|''taru'' adjectives]] and [[naru adjective|''naru'' adjectives]]. Of these, ''naru'' adjectives are fossils of earlier forms of ''na'' adjectives (the ''nari'' adjectives of Old Japanese), and are typically classed separately, while ''taru'' adjectives are a parallel class (formerly ''tari'' adjectives in Late Old Japanese), but are typically classed with ''na'' adjectives.

===Japanese as a topic-prominent language===
In [[discourse]] [[pragmatics]], the term ''topic'' refers to what a section of discourse is about. At the beginning of a section of discourse, the topic is usually unknown, in which case it is usually necessary to explicitly mention it. As the discourse carries on, the topic need not be the grammatical subject of each new sentence.

Starting with Middle Japanese, the grammar evolved so as to explicitly distinguish topics from nontopics. This is done by two distinct [[Japanese particles|particles]] (short words which do not change form). Consider the following pair of sentences:
:太陽'''が'''昇る。
:''taiyō ''ga'' noboru''
:sun &lt;small&gt;NONTOPIC&lt;/small&gt; rise
:太陽'''は'''昇る。
:''taiyō ''wa'' noboru''
:sun &lt;small&gt;TOPIC&lt;/small&gt; rise
Both sentences translate as "the sun rises". In the first sentence the sun (太陽 ''taiyō'') is not a discourse topic—not yet; in the second sentence it now ''is'' a discourse topic. In linguistics (specifically, in discourse pragmatics) a sentence such as the second one (with ''wa'') is termed a '''presentational''' sentence because its function in the discourse is to present ''sun'' as a topic, to "broach it for discussion". Once a [[referent]] has been established as the topic of the current monolog or dialog, then in (formal) modern Japanese its marking will change from ''ga'' to ''wa''. To better explain the difference, the translation of the second sentence can be enlarged to "As for the sun, it rises" or "Speaking of the sun, it rises"; these renderings reflect a discourse fragment in which "the sun" is being established as the topic of an extended discussion.

===Liberal omission of the subject of a sentence===
The grammatical [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] is [[null-subject language|commonly omitted]] in Japanese, as in
:日本に行きました
:''nihon ni ikimashita''
:Japan &lt;small&gt;LATIVE&lt;/small&gt; go-&lt;small&gt;POLITE&lt;/small&gt;-&lt;small&gt;PERFECT&lt;/small&gt;
The sentence literally expresses "went to Japan". Subjects are mentioned when a topic is introduced, or in situations where an ambiguity might result from their omission. The preceding example sentence would most likely be uttered in the middle of a discourse, where who it is that "went to Japan" will be clear from what has already been said (or written).

==Sentences, phrases and words==
''Text'' (文章 ''bunshō'') is composed of ''[[Sentence (linguistics)|sentences]]'' (文 ''bun''), which are in turn composed of ''[[phrase]]s'' (文節 ''bunsetsu''), which are its smallest coherent components. Like [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and classical [[Korean language|Korean]], written Japanese does not typically demarcate words with spaces; its agglutinative nature further makes the concept of a ''[[word]]'' rather different from words in [[English language|English]]. The reader identifies word divisions by semantic cues and a knowledge of phrase structure. Phrases have a ''single'' meaning-bearing word, followed by a string of [[suffix]]es, [[auxiliary verb]]s and [[Grammatical particle|particles]] to modify its meaning and designate its grammatical role. In the following example, phrases are indicated by vertical bars:
:太陽が｜東の｜空に｜昇る。
:''taiyō ga | higashi no | sora ni | noboru''
:sun &lt;small&gt;SUBJECT&lt;/small&gt; | east &lt;small&gt;POSSESSIVE&lt;/small&gt; | sky &lt;small&gt;LOCATIVE&lt;/small&gt; | rise
:The sun rises in the eastern sky.

Some scholars [[Romanization|romanize]] Japanese sentences by inserting spaces only at phrase boundaries (''i.e.'', "''taiyō-ga higashi-no sora-ni noboru''"), treating an entire phrase as a single word. This represents an almost purely phonological conception of where one word ends and the next begins. There is some validity in taking this approach: [[phonology|phonologically]], the [[Preposition and postposition|postpositional]] particles [[Clitic|merge with the structural word that precedes them]], and within a ''phonological'' phrase, the [[Japanese pitch accent|pitch]] can have at most one fall. Usually, however, grammarians adopt a more conventional concept of ''word'' (単語 ''tango''), one which invokes meaning and sentence structure.

==Word classification==
In linguistics generally, words and affixes are often classified into two major word categories: [[lexical word|'''lexical''' words]], those that refer to the world outside of a discourse, and [[function word|'''function''' words]]—also including fragments of words—which help to build the sentence in accordance with the grammar rules of the language. Lexical words include nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and sometimes prepositions and postpositions, while grammatical words or word parts include everything else. The native tradition in Japanese grammar scholarship seems to concur in this view of classification. This native Japanese tradition uses the terminology ''jiritsugo'' (自立語), "independent words", for words having lexical meaning, and ''fuzokugo'' (付属語), "ancillary words", for words having a grammatical function.

Classical Japanese had some auxiliary verbs (i.e., they were independent words) which have become grammaticized in modern Japanese as inflectional suffixes, such as the past tense suffix ''-ta'' (which might have developed as a contraction of ''-te ari'').

Traditional scholarship proposes a system of word classes differing somewhat from the above-mentioned.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} The "independent" words have the following categories.
:''katsuyōgo'' (活用語), word classes which have inflections
::''dōshi'' (動詞), verbs,
::''keiyōshi'' (形容詞), ''i''-type adjectives.
::''keiyōdōshi'' (形容動詞), ''na''-type adjectives

:''hikatsuyōgo'' (非活用語) or ''mukatsuyōgo'' (無活用語), word classes which do not have inflections{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}
::''meishi'' (名詞), nouns
::''daimeishi'' (代名詞), pronouns
::''fukushi'' (副詞), adverbs
::''setsuzokushi'' (接続詞), conjunctions
::''kandōshi'' (感動詞), interjections
::''rentaishi'' (連体詞), prenominals

Ancillary words also divide into a nonconjugable class, containing  grammatical particles (助詞 ''joshi'') and [[Japanese counter word|counter words]] (助数詞 ''josūshi''), and a conjugable class consisting of auxiliary verbs (助動詞 ''jodōshi''). There is not wide agreement among linguists as to the English translations of the above terms.

===Controversy over the characterization of nominal adjectives===
Uehara (1998)&lt;ref&gt;[[#Uehara|Uehara]], chapter 2, especially §2.2.2.2&lt;/ref&gt; observes that Japanese grammarians have disagreed as to the criteria that make some words "inflectional", ''katsuyō'', and others not, in particular, the 形容動詞   ''keiyōdōshi'' – "''na''-adjectives" or "''na''-nominals". (It is not disputed that nouns like 'book' and 'mountain' are noninflectional and that verbs and ''i''-adjectives are inflectional.) The claim that ''na''-adjectives are inflectional rests on the claim that the syllable ''da'' 'is', usually regarded as a "copula verb", is really a suffix—an inflection. Thus ''hon'' 'book', generates a one-word sentence, ''honda'' 'it is a book', not a two-word sentence, ''hon da''. However, numerous constructions seem to be incompatible with the suffixal copula claim.

:(1) Reduplication for emphasis
::''Hora! Hon, hon!'' 'See, it ''is'' a book!'
::''Hora! Kirei, kirei!'' 'See, it ''is'' pretty!'
::''Hora! Furui, furui!'' 'See, it ''is'' old!' (the adjectival inflection -''i'' cannot be left off)
::''Hora! Iku, iku!'' 'See, it ''does'' go!' (the verbal inflection -''u'' cannot be left off)

:(2) Questions. In Japanese, questions are formed by adding the particle ''ka'' (or in colloquial speech, just by changing the intonation of the sentence).
::''Hon/kirei ka?'' 'Is it a book? ; Is it pretty?'
::''Furu-i/Ik-u ka?'' 'Is it old? ; Does it go?' (the inflections cannot be left off)

:(3) Several auxiliary verbs, e.g., ''mitai'', 'looks like it's'
::''Hon mitai da; Kirei mitai da'' 'It seems to be a book; It seems to be pretty'
::''Furu-i mitai da; Ik-u mitai da'' 'It seems to be old; It seems to go'

On the basis of such constructions, Uehara (1998) finds that the copula is indeed an independent word, and that regarding the parameters on which ''i''-adjectives share the syntactic pattern of verbs, the nominal adjectives pattern with pure nouns instead.

Similarly, [[Eleanor Jorden]] considers this class of words a kind of nominal, not adjective, and refers to them as ''na''-nominals in her textbook ''[[Japanese: The Spoken Language]].''

==Nouns==
{{see also|Honorific speech in Japanese}}
Japanese has no [[grammatical gender]], [[grammatical number|number]], or [[article (grammar)|article]]s (though the demonstrative その, ''sono'', "that, those", is often translatable as "the"). Thus, specialists{{who|date=September 2015}} have agreed that Japanese [[noun]]s are [[inflection|noninflecting]]: 猫   ''neko'' can be translated as "cat", "cats", "a cat", "the cat", "some cats" and so forth, depending on context. However, as part of the extensive pair of grammatical systems that Japanese possesses for ''honorification'' (making discourse deferential to the addressee or even to a third party) and politeness, nouns too can be modified. Nouns take politeness prefixes (which have not been regarded as inflections): ''o-'' for native nouns, and ''go-'' for Sino-Japanese nouns. A few examples are given in the following table. In a few cases, there is [[suppletion]], as with the first of the examples given below, 'rice'. (Note that while these prefixes are almost always in ''[[Hiragana]]''&amp;nbsp;— that is, as お   ''o-'' or ご  ''go''&amp;nbsp;— the ''[[kanji]]'' 御 is used for both ''o'' and ''go'' prefixes in formal writing.)

&lt;/div&gt;
Lacking number, Japanese does not differentiate between [[count noun|count]] and [[mass noun]]s. (An English speaker learning Japanese would be well advised to treat Japanese nouns as mass nouns.) A small number of nouns have [[collective number|collective]]s formed by [[reduplication]] (possibly accompanied by voicing and related processes ([[rendaku]])); for example: ''hito'' 'person' and ''hitobito'' 'people'. Reduplication is not [[productivity (linguistics)|productive]]. Words in Japanese referring to more than one of something are collectives, not [[plural]]s. ''Hitobito'', for example, means "a lot of people" or "people in general". It is never used to mean "two people". A phrase like ''edo no hitobito'' would be taken to mean "the people of [[Edo]]", or "the population of Edo", not "two people from Edo" or even "a few people from Edo". Similarly, ''yamayama'' means "many mountains".

A limited number of nouns have collective forms that refer to groups of people. Examples include ''watashi-tachi'', 'we'; ''anata-tachi'', 'you (plural)'; ''bokura'', 'we (less formal, more masculine)'. One uncommon personal noun, ''ware'', 'I', or in some cases, 'you', has a much more common reduplicative collective form ''wareware'' 'we'.

The suffixes ''-tachi'' (達) and ''-ra'' (等) are by far the most common collectivizing suffixes. These are, again, not pluralizing suffixes: ''tarō-tachi'' does not mean "some number of people named Taro", but instead indicates the group including Taro. Depending on context, ''tarō-tachi'' might be translated into "Taro and his friends", "Taro and his siblings", "Taro and his family", or any other logical grouping that has Taro as the representative. Some words with collectives have become fixed phrases and (commonly) refer to one person. Specifically, ''kodomo'' 'child' and ''tomodachi'' 'friend' can be singular, even though ''-[t]omo'' and ''-[t]achi'' were originally collectivizing in these words; to unambiguously refer to groups of them, an additional collectivizing suffix is added: ''kodomotachi'' 'children' and ''tomodachitachi'' 'friends', though ''tomodachitachi'' is somewhat uncommon. ''Tachi'' is sometimes applied to inanimate objects, ''kuruma'' 'car' and ''kuruma-tachi'', 'cars', for example, but this usage is colloquial and indicates a high level of anthropomorphisation and childlikeness, and is not more generally accepted as standard.

===Grammatical case===

[[Grammatical case]]s in Japanese are marked by [[Japanese particles|particles]] placed after the nouns.&lt;ref name="tarou takahashi"&gt;{{cite book|last=Takahashi|first=Tarou|title=A Japanese Grammar|year=2010|publisher=Hitsuji Shobou|location=Japan|isbn=978-4-89476-244-2|page=27|display-authors=etal|language=Japanese|edition=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; A distinctive feature of Japanese is the presence of two cases which are roughly equivalent to the nominative case in other languages: one representing the [[Topic and comment|sentence topic]], other representing the subject. The most important case markers are the following:

* [[Nominative case|Nominative]] - {{lang|ja|が}} (ga) for subject, {{lang|ja|は}} (wa) for the [[Topic marker#Japanese: は|topic]]
* [[Genitive case|Genitive]] - {{lang|ja|の}} (no)
* [[Dative case|Dative]] - {{lang|ja|に}} (ni)
* [[Accusative case|Accusative]] - {{lang|ja|を}} (wo)
* [[Lative case|Lative]] - {{lang|ja|へ}} (e), used for destination direction (like in "to some place")
* [[Ablative case|Ablative]] - {{lang|ja|から}} (kara), used for source direction (like in "from some place")
* [[Instrumental case|Instrumental]] - {{lang|ja|で}} (de)

&lt;/div&gt;
Although many grammars and textbooks mention [[pronoun]]s (代名詞 ''daimeishi''), Japanese lacks true pronouns. (''Daimeishi'' can be considered a subset of nouns.) Strictly speaking, pronouns do not take modifiers, but Japanese ''daimeishi'' do: 背の高い彼 ''se no takai kare'' (lit. tall he) is valid in Japanese. Also, unlike true pronouns, Japanese ''daimeishi'' are not [[closed-class word|closed-class]]: new ''daimeishi'' are introduced and old ones go out of use relatively quickly.

A large number of ''daimeishi'' referring to people are translated as pronouns in their most common uses. Examples: 彼  ''kare'', (he); 彼女  ''kanojo'', (she); 私  ''watashi'', (I); see also the adjoining table or a longer list.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sljfaq.org/afaq/pronoun.html "What are the personal pronouns of Japanese?"] in ''sci.lang.japan Frequently Asked Questions''&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these "personal nouns" such as 己 ''onore'', I (exceedingly humble), or 僕 ''boku'', I (young male), also have second-person uses: おのれ  ''onore'' in second-person is an extremely rude "you", and ''boku'' in second-person is a diminutive "you" used for young boys. ''Kare'' and ''kanojo'' also mean "boyfriend" and "girlfriend" respectively, and this usage of the words is possibly more common than the use as pronouns.

Like other [[subject (grammar)|subject]]s, Japanese deemphasizes personal ''daimeishi'', which are seldom used. This is partly because Japanese sentences do not always require explicit subjects, and partly because names or titles are often used where pronouns would appear in a translation:
:「木下さんは、背が高いですね。」
:''Kinoshita-san wa, se ga takai desu ne.''
: (addressing Mr. Kinoshita) "You're pretty tall, aren't you?"
:「専務、明日福岡市西区の山本商事の社長に会っていただけますか？」
:''Semmu, asu Fukuoka-shi nishi-ku no Yamamoto-shōji no shachō ni atte itadakemasu ka?''
: (addressing the managing director) "Would it be possible for you to meet the president of Yamamoto Trading Co. in [[Nishi-ku, Fukuoka|West Ward, Fukuoka]] tomorrow?"

The possible referents of ''daimeishi'' are sometimes constrained depending on the order of occurrence. The following pair of examples from Bart Mathias&lt;ref&gt;Bart Mathias. [http://groups-beta.google.com/group/sci.lang.japan/msg/fed63fa6c3614895?dmode=source Discussion of pronoun reference constraints] on sci.lang.japan.&lt;/ref&gt; illustrates one such constraint.
:''Honda-kun ni atte, kare no hon o kaeshita'' (本田君に会って、彼の本を返した。)
:(I) met Honda and returned his book. ("His" here can refer to Honda.)
:''Kare ni atte, Honda-kun no hon o kaeshita'' (彼に会って、本田君の本を返した。)
:(I) met him and returned Honda's book. (Here, "him" ''cannot'' refer to Honda.)

===Reflexive pronouns===
English has a reflexive form of each [[personal pronoun]] (''himself'', ''herself'', ''itself'', ''themselves'', etc.); Japanese, in contrast, has one main reflexive ''daimeishi'', namely ''jibun'' (自分), which can also mean 'I'. The uses of the reflexive (pro)nouns in the two languages are very different, as demonstrated by the following literal translations (*=impossible, ??=ambiguous):
{| class="wikitable" style="margin-left: 2em;"
! English !! Japanese !! reason
|- valign="top"
| History repeats itself.
| *''Rekishi wa jibun o kurikaesu.'' (*歴史は自分を繰り返す。)
| the target of ''jibun'' must be animate
|- valign="top"
| Hiroshi talked to Kenji about himself (=Hiroshi).
| ''Hiroshi wa Kenji ni jibun no koto o hanashita.'' (ひろしは健司に自分のことを話した。)
| there is no ambiguity in the translation as explained below
|- valign="top"
| *Makoto expects that Shizuko will take good care of himself (=Makoto; note that Shizuko is female).
| ??誠は静子が自分を大事にすることを期待している。&lt;br /&gt;??''Makoto wa Shizuko ga jibun o daiji ni suru koto o kitai shite iru.''&lt;br&gt;either "Makoto expects that Shizuko will take good care of him", or "Makoto expects that Shizuko will take good care of herself."
| ''jibun'' can be in a different sentence or dependent clause, but its target is ambiguous
|}
If the sentence has more than one grammatical or semantic subject, then the target of ''jibun'' is the subject of the ''primary'' or ''most prominent action''; thus in the following sentence ''jibun'' refers unambiguously to Shizuko (even though Makoto is the grammatical subject) because the primary action is Shizuko's reading.
:誠は静子に自分の家で本を読ませた。
:''Makoto wa Shizuko ni jibun no uchi de hon o yomaseta.''
:Makoto made Shizuko read book(s) in her house.

In practice the main action is not always discernible, in which case such sentences are ambiguous. The use of ''jibun'' in complex sentences follows non-trivial rules.

There are also equivalents to ''jibun'' such as ''mizukara''. Other uses of the [[reflexive pronoun]] in English are covered by adverbs like ''hitorideni'' which is used in the sense of "by oneself". For example,
:機械がひとりでに動き出した
:''kikai ga hitorideni ugokidashita''
:"The machine started operating by itself."

Change in a verb's [[Valency (linguistics)|valency]] is not accomplished by use of reflexive pronouns (in this Japanese is like English but unlike many other European languages). Instead, separate (but usually related) [[intransitive verb]]s and [[transitive verb]]s are used. There is no longer any productive morphology to derive transitive verbs from intransitive ones, or vice versa.

===Demonstratives===

|}
: 1. irregular formation
: 2. ''-ou'' is represented by ''-ō''
: 3. colloquially contracted to -cchi
&lt;/div&gt;

[[Demonstrative]]s occur in the ''ko-'', ''so-'', and ''a-'' series. The ''ko-'' (proximal) series refers to things closer to the speaker than the hearer, the ''so-'' (medial) series for things closer to the hearer, and the ''a-'' (distal) series for things distant to both the speaker and the hearer. With ''do-'', demonstratives turn into the corresponding interrogative form. Demonstratives can also be used to refer to people, for example
:「こちらは林さんです。」
:''Kochira wa Hayashi-san desu.''
:"This is Mr. Hayashi."

Demonstratives limit, and therefore precede, nouns; thus この本  ''kono hon'' for "this/my book", and その本  ''sono hon'' for "that/your book".

When demonstratives are used to refer to things not visible to the speaker or the hearer, or to (abstract) concepts, they fulfill a related but different [[Anaphora (linguistics)|anaphoric]] role. The anaphoric distals are used for shared information between the speaker and the listener.
:A：先日、札幌に行って来ました。
:''A: Senjitsu, Sapporo ni itte kimashita.''
:A: I visited Sapporo recently.
:B：あそこ(*そこ)はいつ行ってもいい所ですね。
:''B: Asoko (*Soko) wa itsu itte mo ii tokoro desu ne.''
:B: Yeah, that's a great place to visit whenever you go.

''Soko'' instead of ''asoko'' would imply that B doesn't share this knowledge about Sapporo, which is inconsistent with the meaning of the sentence. The anaphoric medials are used to refer to experience or knowledge that is not shared between the speaker and listener.
:佐藤：田中という人が昨日死んだんだって。
:''Satō : Tanaka to iu hito ga kinō shinda n da tte... ''
:Sato: I heard that a man called Tanaka died yesterday...
:森：えっ、本当?
:''Mori: E', hontō?''
:Mori: Oh, really?
:佐藤：だから、その(*あの)人、森さんの昔の隣人じゃなかったっけ？
:''Satō : Dakara, sono (*ano) hito, Mori-san no mukashi no rinjin ja nakatta 'kke?''
:Sato: It's why I asked... wasn't he an old neighbour of yours?

Again, ''ano'' is inappropriate here because Sato doesn't (didn't) know Tanaka personally. The [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|proximal]] demonstratives do not have clear anaphoric uses. They can be used in situations where the distal series sound too disconnected:
:一体何ですか、これ(*あれ)は?
:''Ittai nan desu ka, kore (*are) wa?''
:What on earth is this?

==Conjugable words==

===Stem forms===
Prior to discussing the conjugable words, a brief note about ''stem forms''. Conjugative suffixes and auxiliary verbs are attached to the stem forms of the affixee. In modern Japanese there are the following six stem forms.

Note that this order follows from the ''-a, -i, -u, -e, -o'' endings that these forms have in 五段 (5-row) verbs (according to the あ、い、う、え、お collation order of Japanese), where terminal and attributive forms are the same for verbs (hence only 5 surface forms), but differ for nominals, notably ''na''-nominals.
; ''Irrealis form'' (未然形 ''mizenkei'') ''-a'' (and ''-ō''): is used for plain negative (of verbs), causative and passive constructions. The most common use of this form is with the ''-nai'' auxiliary that turns verbs into their negative (predicate) form. (See Verbs below.) The ''-ō'' version is used for volitional expression and formed by a euphonic change (音便 onbin).
; ''Continuative form'' (連用形 ''ren'yōkei'') ''-i'': is used in a linking role (a kind of [[serial verb construction]]). This is the most productive stem form, taking on a variety of endings and auxiliaries, and can even occur independently in a sense similar to the ''-te'' ending. This form is also used to negate adjectives.
; ''Terminal form'' (終止形 ''shūshikei'') ''-u'': is used at the ends of clauses in [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] positions. This form is also variously known as ''plain form'' (基本形 ''kihonkei'') or ''[[dictionary form]]'' (辞書形 ''jishokei'') – it is the form that verbs are listed under in a dictionary.
; ''[[Attributive verb#Japanese|Attributive form]]'' ({{visible anchor|連体形}} ''rentaikei'') ''-u'': is prefixed to nominals and is used to define or classify the noun, similar to a [[relative clause]] in English. In modern Japanese it is practically identical to the terminal form, except that verbs are generally not inflected for politeness; in old Japanese these forms differed. Further, ''na''-nominals behave differently in terminal and attributive positions; see [[#Adjectives|adjectives]], below.
; ''Hypothetical form'' (仮定形 ''kateikei'') ''-e'': is used for conditional and subjunctive forms, using the ''-ba'' ending.
; ''Imperative form'' (命令形 ''meireikei'') ''-e'': is used to turn verbs into commands. Adjectives do not have an imperative stem form.

The application of conjugative suffixes to stem forms follow certain euphonic principles (音便 ''onbin''), which are discussed below.

===Verbs===
{{Main|Japanese verb conjugation}}

Verbs (動詞 ''dōshi'') in Japanese are rigidly constrained to the ends of clauses in what is known as the ''predicate position''. This means that the verb is always located at the end of a sentence.
{| cellpadding="2px" style="margin-left: 2em;"
|-
| 猫 || は || 魚 || を || 食べる。
|-
| ''neko'' || ''wa'' || ''sakana'' || ''o'' || ''taberu''
|-
| Cats || TOPIC || fish || OBJECT || eat
|-
|colspan="5"| Cats eat fish.
|}
The subject and objects of the verb are indicated by means of ''[[Japanese grammar#Particles|particles]]'', and the grammatical functions of the verb&amp;nbsp;— primarily tense and voice&amp;nbsp;— are indicated by means of [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]]. When the subject and the dissertative topic coincide, the subject is often omitted; if the verb is intransitive, the entire sentence may consist of a single verb. Verbs have two tenses indicated by conjugation, past and nonpast. The semantic difference between present and future is not indicated by means of conjugation. Usually there is no ambiguity as context makes it clear whether the speaker is referring to the present or future. Voice and aspect are also indicated by means of conjugation, and possibly agglutinating auxiliary verbs. For example, the continuative aspect is formed by means of the continuative conjugation known as the ''gerundive'' or ''[[te form of Japanese verb|-te form]]'', and the auxiliary verb ''iru'' "to be"; to illustrate, 見る  ''miru'' ("to see") → 見ている  ''mite iru'' ("to be seeing").

Verbs can be semantically classified based on certain conjugations.
; Stative verbs: indicate existential properties, such as "to be" (いる ''iru''), "to be able to do" (出来る ''dekiru''), "to need" (要る ''iru''), etc. These verbs generally do not have a continuative conjugation with ''-iru'' because they are semantically continuative already.
; Continual verbs: conjugate with the auxiliary ''-iru'' to indicate the progressive aspect. Examples: "to eat" (食べる ''taberu''), "to drink" (飲む ''nomu''), "to think" (考える ''kangaeru''). To illustrate the conjugation, 食べる  ''taberu'' ("to eat") → 食べている  ''tabete iru'' ("to be eating").
; Punctual verbs: conjugate with ''-iru'' to indicate a repeated action, or a continuing state after some action. Example: 知る  ''shiru'' ("to know") → 知っている  ''shitte iru'' ("to be knowing"); 打つ  ''utsu'' ("to hit") → 打っている  ''utte iru'' ("to be hitting (repeatedly)").
; Non-volitional verb: indicate uncontrollable action or emotion. These verbs generally have no volitional, imperative or potential conjugation. Examples: 好む  ''konomu'', "to like / to prefer" (emotive), 見える  ''mieru'', "to be visible" (non-emotive).
; Movement verbs: indicate motion. Examples: 歩く  ''aruku'' ("to walk"), 帰る  ''kaeru'' ("to return"). In the continuative form (see below) they take the particle ''ni'' to indicate a purpose.
There are other possible classes, and a large amount of overlap between the classes.

Lexically, nearly every verb in Japanese is a member of exactly one of the following three regular ''conjugation groups'' (see also [[Japanese consonant and vowel verbs]]).
; Group 2a (上一段 ''kami ichidan'', lit. upper 1-row group): verbs with a stem ending in ''i''. The terminal stem form always rhymes with ''-iru''. Examples: 見る  ''miru'' ("to see"), 着る  ''kiru'' ("to wear").
; Group 2b (下一段 ''shimo ichidan'', lit. lower 1-row group): verbs with a stem ending in ''e''. The terminal stem form always rhymes with ''-eru''. Examples: 食べる  ''taberu'' ("to eat"), くれる  ''kureru'' ("to give" (to someone of lower or more intimate status)). (Note that some Group 1 verbs resemble Group 2b verbs, but their stems end in ''r'', not ''e''.)
; Group 1 (五段 ''godan'', lit. 5-row group): verbs with a stem ending in a consonant. When this is ''r'' and the verb ends in ''-eru'', it is not apparent from the terminal form whether the verb is Group 1 or Group 2b, e.g. 帰る  ''kaeru'' ("to return"). If the stem ends in ''w'', that sound only appears in before the final ''a'' of the [[irrealis]] form.

The "row" in the above classification means a row in the [[gojūon]] table. "Upper 1-row" means the row that is one row above the center row (the u-row) i.e. i-row. "Lower 1-row" means the row that is one row below the center row (the u-row) i.e. e-row. "5-row" means the conjugation runs though all 5 rows of the [[gojūon]] table. A conjugation is fully described by identifying both the row and the column in the [[gojūon]] table. For example, 見る  (''miru'', "to see") belongs to マ行上一段活用 (ma-column i-row conjugation), 食べる  (''taberu'', "to eat") belongs to バ行下一段活用 (ba-column e-row conjugation), and 帰る (''kaeru'', "to return") belongs to ラ行五段活用(ra-column 5-row conjugation).

One should avoid confusing verbs in ラ行五段活用 (ra-column 5-row conjugation) with verbs in 上一段活用 (i-row conjugation) or 下一段活用 (e-row conjugation). For example, 切る  (''kiru'', "to cut") belongs to ラ行五段活用 (ra-column 5-row conjugation), whereas its homophone 着る  (''kiru'', "to wear") belongs to カ行上一段活用 (ka-column i-row conjugation). Likewise, 練る  (''neru'', "to knead") belongs to ラ行五段活用 (ra-column 5-row conjugation), whereas its homophone 寝る  (''neru'', "to sleep") belongs to ナ行下一段活用 (na-column e-row conjugation).

Historical note: classical Japanese had upper and lower 1- and 2-row groups and a 4-row group (上／下一段 ''kami/shimo ichidan'', 上／下二段 ''kami/shimo nidan'', and 四段 ''yodan'', the ''nidan'' verbs becoming most of today's ''ichidan'' verbs (there were only a handful of ''kami ichidan'' verbs and only one single ''shimo ichidan'' verb in classical Japanese), and the ''yodan'' group, due to the writing reform in 1946 to write Japanese as it is pronounced, naturally became the modern ''godan'' verbs. Since verbs have migrated across groups in the history of the language, conjugation of classical verbs is not predictable from a knowledge of modern Japanese alone.

Of the irregular classes, there are two:
; ''sa''-group: which has only one member, する  (''suru'', "to do"). In Japanese grammars these words are classified as サ変  ''sa-hen'', an abbreviation of サ行変格活用  ''sa-gyō henkaku katsuyō'', sa-row irregular conjugation).
; ''ka''-group: which also has one member, 来る  (''kuru'', "to come"). The Japanese name for this class is カ行変格活用  ''ka-gyō henkaku katsuyō'' or simply カ変  ''ka-hen''.
Classical Japanese had two further irregular classes, the ''na''-group, which contained 死ぬ  (''shinu'', "to die") and 往ぬ  (''inu'', "to go", "to die"), the ''ra''-group, which included such verbs as あり  ''ari'', the equivalent of modern ''aru'', as well as quite a number of extremely irregular verbs that cannot be classified.

The following table illustrates the stem forms of the above conjugation groups, with the root indicated with dots. For example, to find the hypothetical form of the group 1 verb 書く  ''kaku'', look in the second row to find its root, ''kak'', then in the hypothetical row to get the ending ''-e'', giving the stem form ''kake''. When there are multiple possibilities, they are listed in the order of increasing rarity.

# The -''a'' and -''o'' irrealis forms for Group 1 verbs were historically one, but since the post-WWII spelling reforms they have been written differently. In modern Japanese the -''o'' form is used only for the volitional mood and the -''a'' form is used in all other cases; see also the conjugation table below.
# The unexpected ending is due to the verb's root being ''tsukaw-'' but [w] only being pronounced before [a] in modern Japanese.

The above are only the stem forms of the verbs; to these one must add various verb endings in order to get the fully conjugated verb. The following table lists the most common conjugations. Note that in some cases the form is different depending on the conjugation group of the verb. See [[Japanese verb conjugation]]s for a full list.

# This is an entirely different verb; する  ''suru'' has no potential form.
# These forms change depending on the final syllable of the verb's dictionary form (whether ''u'', ''ku'', ''gu'', ''su'', etc.). For details, see [[#Euphonic changes (音便 onbin)|Euphonic changes]], below, and the article [[Japanese verb conjugation]].

The polite ending ''-masu'' conjugates as a group 1 verb, except that the negative imperfective and perfective forms are ''-masen'' and ''-masen deshita'' respectively, and certain conjugations are in practice rarely if ever used. The passive and potential endings ''-reru'' and ''-rareru'', and the causative endings ''-seru'' and ''-saseru'' all conjugate as group 2b verbs. Multiple verbal endings can therefore agglutinate. For example, a common formation is the ''causative-passive'' ending, ''-sase-rareru''.
:僕は姉に納豆を食べさせられた。
:''Boku wa ane ni nattō o tabe'''saserareta'''.''
:I '''was made to''' eat ''[[nattō]]'' by my (elder) sister.
As should be expected, the vast majority of theoretically possible combinations of conjugative endings are not semantically meaningful.

====Transitive and intransitive verbs====
Japanese has a large variety of related pairs of [[transitive verb]]s (that take a direct object) and [[intransitive verb]]s (that do not ''usually'' take a direct object), such as the transitive ''hajimeru'' (始める, someone or something begins an activity), and the intransitive ''hajimaru'' (始まる, an activity begins).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sljfaq.org/afaq/jitadoushi.html "What's the difference between hajimeru and hajimaru?"] in ''sci.lang.japan Frequently Asked Questions''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kim Allen (2000) [http://kimallen.sheepdogdesign.net/Japanese/verbs2.html "Japanese verbs, part 2"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810194203/http://kimallen.sheepdogdesign.net/Japanese/verbs2.html |date=2007-08-10 }} in ''Japanese for the Western Brain''&lt;/ref&gt;

:私は 東京を 離れる。
:''Watashi wa Tōkyō o hanareru.''
:I leave Tokyo.

===Adjectival verbs and nouns===
:{{Main|Japanese equivalents of adjectives}}

Semantically speaking, words that denote attributes or properties are primarily distributed between two morphological classes (there are also a few other classes):
*adjectival verbs (conventionally called "''i''-adjectives") (形容詞 ''keiyōshi'')&amp;nbsp;– these have roots and conjugating stem forms, and are semantically and morphologically similar to [[stative verb]]s.
*adjectival nouns (conventionally called "''na''-adjectives") (形容動詞 ''keiyōdōshi'', lit. "adjectival verb")&amp;nbsp;– these are nouns that combine with the copula.

Unlike adjectives in languages like English, ''i''-adjectives in Japanese inflect for aspect and mood, like verbs. Japanese adjectives do not have comparative or superlative inflections; comparatives and superlatives have to be marked periphrastically using adverbs like ''motto'' 'more' and ''ichiban'' 'most'.

Every adjective in Japanese can be used in an [[Adjective#Attributive|attributive position]]. Nearly every Japanese adjective can be used in a [[Adjective#Predicative|predicative position]]; this differs from English where there are many common adjectives such as "major", as in "a major question", that cannot be used in the predicate position (that is, *"The question is major" is not grammatical English). There are a few Japanese adjectives that cannot predicate, known as 連体詞 (''rentaishi,'' attributives), which are derived from other word classes; examples include 大きな  ''ōkina'' "big", 小さな  ''chiisana'' "small", and おかしな ''okashina'' "strange" which are all stylistic ''na''-type variants of normal ''i''-type adjectives.

All ''i''-adjectives except for いい  (''ii'', good) have regular conjugations, and ''ii'' is irregular only in the fact that it is a changed form of the regular adjective 良い  ''yoi'' permissible in the terminal and attributive forms. For all other forms it reverts to ''yoi''.

# The attributive and terminal forms were formerly 安き  ''.ki'' and 安し  ''.shi'', respectively; in modern Japanese these are used productively for stylistic reasons only, although many [[set phrase]]s such as 名無し ''nanashi'' (anonymous) and よし ''yoshi'' (sometimes written ''yosh''', general positive interjection) derive from them.
# The imperative form is extremely rare in modern Japanese, restricted to set patterns like 遅かれ早かれ  ''osokare hayakare'' 'sooner or later', where they are treated as adverbial phrases. It is impossible for an imperative form to be in a predicate position.

Common conjugations of adjectives are enumerated below. ''ii'' is not treated separately, because all conjugation forms are identical to those of ''yoi''.

Adjectives too are governed by euphonic rules in certain cases, as noted in the section on it below. For the polite negatives of ''na''-type adjectives, see also the section below on the copula だ  ''da''.

===The copula (だ ''da'')===
The [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]] ''da'' behaves very much like a verb or an adjective in terms of conjugation.

:John '''is''' a student.

:明日も晴れ'''なら'''、ピクニックしよう。
:''Ashita mo hare '''nara''', PIKUNIKKU shiyō''
:'''If''' tomorrow '''is''' clear too, let's have a picnic.

In continuative conjugations, では  ''de wa'' is often contracted in speech to じゃ  ''ja''; for some kinds of informal speech ''ja'' is preferable to ''de wa'', or is the only possibility.

:1. usually not reflected in spelling
&lt;/div&gt;

Modern pronunciation is a result of a long history of phonemic drift that can be traced back to written records of the thirteenth century, and possibly earlier. However, it was only in 1946 that the Japanese ministry of education modified existing [[kana]] usage to conform to the standard dialect (共通語 ''kyōtsūgo''). All earlier texts used the archaic orthography, now referred to as [[historical kana usage]]. The adjoining table is a nearly exhaustive list of these spelling changes.

Note that palatalized morae {{nihongo||ゆ、よ|yu, yo}} combine with the initial consonant, if present, yielding a palatalized syllable. The most basic example of this is modern {{Nihongo||今日、きょう|kyō|today}}, which historically developed as {{Nihongo||けふ|kefu}} → {{Nihongo||きょう|kyō}}, via the {{Nihongo||えふ|efu}} → {{Nihongo||よう|yō}} rule.

A few sound changes are not reflected in the spelling. Firstly, ''ou'' merged with ''oo,'' both being pronounced as a long ''ō.'' Secondly, the particles は and を are still written using historical kana usage, though these are pronounced as ''wa'' and ''o,'' rather than ''ha'' and ''wo,'' with the rare exception of 〜んを, which is pronounced as ''-n wo,'' as in {{Nihongo||千円をいただきます|sen'en wo itadakimasu|I humbly receive one thousand yen}}.

Among Japanese speakers, it is not generally understood that the historical ''kana'' spellings were, at one point, reflective of pronunciation. For example, the modern ''on'yomi'' reading {{Nihongo||よう|yō}} for {{Nihongo|leaf|葉|yō}} arose from historical {{Nihongo||えふ|efu}}. The latter was pronounced something like {{IPA|[ʲepu]}} by the Japanese at the time it was borrowed (compare [[Middle Chinese]] {{IPA|[jiɛp̚]}}). However, a modern reader of a classical text would still read this as {{IPAc-ja|yō}}, the modern pronunciation.

====Verb conjugations====
:{{Main|Japanese verb conjugation}}

As mentioned above, conjugations of some verbs and adjectives differ from the prescribed formation rules because of euphonic changes. Nearly all of these euphonic changes are themselves regular. For verbs the exceptions are all in the ending of the continuative form of group when the following auxiliary starts with a ''t''-sound, ''i.e.'', た  ''ta'', て  ''te'', たり  ''tari'', etc.

| い ''i'', ち ''chi'' or り ''ri''
| っ (double consonant)
| *買いて ''*kaite'' → 買って ''katte''&lt;br&gt;*打ちて ''*uchite'' → 打って ''utte''&lt;br&gt;*知りて ''*shirite'' → 知って ''shitte''
|-
| び ''bi'', み''mi'' or に ''ni''

| *遊びて ''*asobite'' → 遊んで ''asonde''&lt;br&gt;*住みて ''*sumite'' → 住んで ''sunde''&lt;br&gt;*死にて ''*shinite'' → 死んで ''shinde''
|-
| き ''ki''

|}

:&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; denotes impossible/ungrammatical form.

There is one other irregular change: 行く ''iku'' (to go), for which there is an exceptional continuative form: 行き ''iki'' + て ''te'' → 行って ''itte'', 行き ''iki'' + た ''ta'' → 行った ''itta'', etc.

There are dialectical differences, which are also regular and generally occur in similar situations. For example, in [[Kansai dialect]] the ''-i'' + ''t-'' conjugations are instead changed to ''-ut-,'' as in {{Nihongo||思うた|omōta}} instead of {{Nihongo||思った|omotta}}, as perfective of {{Nihongo||思う|omou|think}}. In this example, this can combine with the preceding vowel via historical sound changes, as in {{Nihongo||しもうた|shimōta}} (''au'' → ''ō'') instead of standard {{Nihongo||しまった|shimatta}}.

====Polite forms of adjectives====
The continuative form of proper adjectives, when followed by polite forms such as {{Nihongo||御座る|gozaru|be}} or {{Nihongo||存じる|zonjiru|know, think}}, undergoes a transformation; this may be followed by historical sound changes, yielding a one-step or two-step sound change. Note that these verbs are almost invariably conjugated to polite {{Nihongo||〜ます|-masu}} form, as {{Nihongo||ございます|gozaimasu}} and {{Nihongo||存じます|zonjimasu}} (note the irregular conjugation of ''gozaru,'' discussed below), and that these verbs are preceded by the ''continuative'' form – {{Nihongo||〜く|-ku}} – of adjectives, rather than the terminal form – {{Nihongo||〜い|-i}} – which is used before the more everyday {{Nihongo||です|desu|be}}.

The rule is {{Nihongo||〜く|-ku}} → {{Nihongo||〜う|-u}} (dropping the ''-k-''), possibly also combining with the previous syllable according to the spelling reform chart, which may also undergo palatalization in the case of {{nihongo|ゆ、よ|yu, yo}}.

Historically there were two classes of proper [[Old Japanese#Adjectives|Old Japanese adjectives]], {{Nihongo||〜く|-ku}} and {{Nihongo||〜しく|-shiku}} ("''-ku'' adjective" means "not preceded by ''shi''"). This distinction collapsed during the evolution of [[Late Middle Japanese#Adjectives|Late Middle Japanese adjectives]], and both are now considered {{Nihongo||〜い|-i}} adjectives. The sound change for ''-shii'' adjectives follows the same rule as for other ''-ii'' adjectives, notably that the preceding vowel also changes and the preceding mora undergoes palatalization, yielding {{Nihongo||〜しく|-shiku}} → {{Nihongo||〜しゅう|-shū}}, though historically this was considered a separate but parallel rule.

Contractions differ by dialect, but behave similarly to the standard ones given above. For example, in [[Kansai dialect]] {{Nihongo||〜てしまう|-te shimau}} → {{Nihongo||〜てまう|-temau}}.

==Other independent words==

===Adverbs===
Adverbs in Japanese are not as tightly integrated into the morphology as in many other languages. Indeed, adverbs are not an independent class of words, but rather a role played by other words. For example, every adjective in the continuative form can be used as an adverb; thus, 弱い  ''yowai'' 'weak' (adj) → 弱く  ''yowaku'' 'weakly' (adv). The primary distinguishing characteristic of adverbs is that they cannot occur in a predicate position, just as it is in English. The following classification of adverbs is not intended to be authoritative or exhaustive.
; Verbal adverbs: are verbs in the continuative form with the particle ''ni''. E.g. 見る  ''miru'' 'to see' → 見に  ''mi ni'' 'for the purpose of seeing', used for instance as: 見に行く ''mi ni iku'', ''go to see (something)''.
; Adjectival adverbs: are adjectives in the continuative form, as mentioned above.
; Nominal adverbs: are grammatical nouns that function as adverbs. Example: 一番  ''ichiban'' 'most highly'.
; Sound symbolism: are words that mimic sounds or concepts. Examples: きらきら  ''kirakira'' 'sparklingly', ぽっくり  ''pokkuri'' 'suddenly', するする ''surusuru'' 'smoothly (sliding)', etc.

Often, especially for sound symbolism, the particle ''to'' "as if" is used. See the article on [[Japanese sound symbolism]].

===Conjunctions and interjections===

Examples of conjunctions: そして  ''soshite'' 'and then', また  ''mata'' 'and then/again', etc.
Although called "conjunctions", these words are, as English translations show, actually a kind of adverbs.

Examples of interjections: はい (''hai'', yes/OK/uh), へえ (''hee'', wow!), いいえ (''iie'', no/no way), おい (''oi'', hey!), etc.
This part of speech is not very different from that of English.

==Ancillary words==

===Particles===
:{{Main|Japanese particles}}

Particles in Japanese are postpositional, as they immediately follow the modified component. A full listing of particles is beyond the scope of this article, so only a few prominent particles are listed here. Keep in mind that the pronunciation and spelling differ for the particles ''wa'' (は), ''e''  (へ) and ''o'' (を): This article follows the [[Hepburn romanization|Hepburn-style]] of romanizing them according to the ''pronunciation'' rather than spelling.

====Topic, theme, and subject: は ''wa'' and が ''ga''====
The complex distinction between the so-called topic (は ''wa'') and subject (が ''ga'') particles has been the theme of many doctoral dissertations and scholarly disputes. The clause 象は鼻が長い ''zō-wa hana-ga nagai'' is well known for appearing to contain two subjects. It does not simply mean "the elephant's nose is long", as that can be translated as 象の鼻は長い ''zō-no hana-wa nagai''. Rather, a more literal translation would be "(speaking of) the elephant, its nose is long".

Two major scholarly surveys of Japanese linguistics in English, (Shibatani 1990) and (Kuno 1973), clarify the distinction. To simplify matters, the referents of ''wa'' and ''ga'' in this section are called the ''topic'' and ''subject'' respectively, with the understanding that if either is absent, the grammatical topic and subject may coincide.

As an abstract and rough approximation, the difference between ''wa'' and ''ga'' is a matter of focus: ''wa'' gives focus to the ''action'' of the sentence, i.e., to the verb or adjective, whereas ''ga'' gives focus to the ''subject'' of the action. However, a more useful description must proceed by enumerating uses of these particles.

However, when first being introduced to the topic and subject markers ''wa'' and ''ga'' most are told that the difference between the two is simpler. The topic marker, ''wa'', is used to declare or to make a statement. The subject marker, ''ga'', is used for new information, or asking for new information.

''See [[Topic marker#Japanese: は|Topic marker: Japanese: は]].

=====Thematic ''wa''=====
The use of ''wa'' to introduce a new theme of discourse is directly linked to the notion of grammatical theme. Opinions differ on the structure of discourse theme, though it seems fairly uncontroversial to imagine a first-in-first-out hierarchy of themes that is threaded through the discourse. Of course, human limitations restrict the scope and depth of themes, and later themes may cause earlier themes to expire. In these sorts of sentences, the steadfast translation into English uses constructs like "''speaking of X''" or "''on the topic of X''", though such translations tend to be bulky as they fail to use the thematic mechanisms of English. For lack of a comprehensive strategy, many teachers of Japanese emphasize the "''speaking of X''" pattern without sufficient warning.
:ジョンは学生です。
:''JON wa gakusei desu''
: (On the topic of) John, (he) is a student.

A common linguistic joke shows the insufficiency of rote translation with the sentence 僕はウナギだ ''boku wa unagi da'', which per the pattern would translate as "''I am an eel.''" (or "(As of) me is eel"). Yet, in a restaurant this sentence can reasonably be used to say "My order is eel" (or "I would like to order an eel"), with no intended humour. This is because the sentence should be literally read, "As for me, it is an eel," with "it" referring to the speaker's order. The topic of the sentence is clearly not its subject.

=====Contrastive ''wa''=====
Related to the role of ''wa'' in introducing themes is its use in contrasting the current topic and its aspects from other possible topics and their aspects. The suggestive pattern is "''X, but...''" or "''as for X, ...''".
:{{lang|ja|雨は降っていますが...}}
:''ame wa futte imasu ga...''
:The rain is falling, but...

Because of its contrastive nature, the topic cannot be undefined.
: *誰かは本を読んでいる。
: *''dareka wa hon o yonde iru''
: *Someone is reading the book.

In this use, ''wa'' is required.

In practice, the distinction between thematic and contrastive ''wa'' is not that useful. Suffice it to say that there can be at most one thematic ''wa'' in a sentence, and it has to be the first ''wa'' if one exists, and the remaining ''wa''s are contrastive. For completeness, the following sentence (due to Kuno) illustrates the difference.
:僕が知っている人は誰も来なかった。
:''boku ga shitte iru hito wa daremo konakatta''
:(1) Of all the people I know, none came.
:(2) (People came but), there weren't any of the people I know.

The first interpretation is the thematic ''wa'', treating "the people I know" (''boku ga shitte iru hito'') as the theme of the predicate "none came" (''dare mo konakatta''). That is, if I know A, B, ..., Z, then none of the people who came were A, B, ..., Z. The second interpretation is the contrastive ''wa''. If the likely attendees were A, B, ..., Z, and of them I know P, Q and R, then the sentence says that P, Q and R did not come. The sentence says ''nothing'' about A', B', ..., Z', all of whom I know, but none of whom were likely to come. (In practice the first interpretation is the likely one.)

=====Exhaustive ''ga''=====
Unlike ''wa'', the subject particle ''ga'' nominates its referent as the sole satisfier of the predicate. This distinction is famously illustrated by the following pair of sentences.
:ジョンさんは学生です。
:''Jon-san wa gakusei desu''
:John is a student. (There may be other students among the people we're talking about.)
:(このグループの中で)ジョンが学生です。
:''(Kono gurūpu no naka de) Jon ga gakusei desu''
:(Of all the people we are talking about) it is John who is the student.

It may be useful to think of the distinction in terms of the question each statement could answer, e.g.:
:ジョンさんの仕事は何ですか。
:''Jon-san no shigoto wa nan desu ka''
:What is John's occupation?
for the first statement, versus
:どちらの方が学生ですか。
:''Dochira no kata ga gakusei desu ka''
:Which one (of them) is the student?
for the second.

Similarly, in a restaurant, if the waitress asks who has ordered the eels, the customer who ordered it can say{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}
:僕がウナギだ。
:''Boku ga unagi da''
:The eels are for me (not these other people).

=====Objective ''ga''=====
For certain verbs, typically ''ga'' instead of ''o'' is used to mark what would be the direct object in English: 
:ジョンさんはフランス語が出来る。
:''Jon-san wa furansu-go ga dekiru''
:John knows French.

These notions that would be thought of as actions, or "verbs" in English, e.g. 出来る (to be able to), ほしい (is/are desirable), 好きだ (is/are liked), 嫌いだ (is/are disliked), etc., are in fact simply adjectives and intransitive verbs whose subject is what would be a direct object in the English translation. The equivalent of the English subject is instead the [[Topic–comment|topic]] in Japanese and thus marked by ''wa'', reflecting the [[Topic-prominent language|topic-prominent]] nature of Japanese grammar.

====Objects, locatives, instrumentals: を ''o'', で ''de'', に ''ni'', へ ''e''====
The direct object of transitive verbs is indicated by the object particle を ''o''.
:ジョンさんは青いセーターを着ている。
:''Jon-san wa aoi sētā o kite iru''
:John is wearing a blue sweater.

This particle can also mean "through" or "along" or "out of" when used with motion verbs.
:メアリが細い道を歩いていた。
:''MEARI ga hosoi michi o aruite ita''
:Mary was walking along a narrow road.
:国境の長いトンネルを抜けると雪国であった。
:''kokkyō no nagai TONNERU o nukeru to yukiguni de atta''
:The train came out of the long tunnel into the snow country.

The general instrumental particle is で ''de'', which can be translated as "using" or "by":
:肉はナイフで切ること。
:''niku wa NAIFU de kiru koto''
:Meat must be cut with a knife.
:電車で行きましょう。
:''densha de ikimashō''
:Let's go by train.

This particle also has other uses: "at" (temporary location):
:町角で先生に会った。
:''machikado de sensei ni atta''
:(I) met my teacher at the street corner.

"In":
:海で泳ぐのは難しい。
:''umi de oyogu no wa muzukashii''
:Swimming in the sea is hard.

"With" or "in (the span of)":
:劇は主人公の死で終る。
:''geki wa shujinkō no shi de owaru''
:The play ends with the protagonist's death.
:俺は二秒で勝つ。
:''ore wa nibyō de katsu''
:I'll win in two seconds.

The general locative particle is に ''ni''.
:東京に行きましょう。
:''Tōkyō ni ikimashō''
:Let's go to [[Tokyo]]

In this function it is interchangeable with へ ''e''. However, ''ni'' has additional uses: "at (prolonged)":
:私は大手町一丁目99番地に住んでいます。
:''watashi wa Ōtemachi itchōme 99 banchi ni sunde imasu''
:I live at Ōtemachi ichōme 99 banchi.

"On":
:氷は水に浮く。
:''kōri wa mizu ni uku''
:Ice floats on water.

"In (some year)", "at (some point in time)":
:{{lang|ja|春の夕暮れに......}}
:''haru no yūgure ni...''
:On a spring eve...

====Quantity and extents: と ''to'', も ''mo'', か ''ka'', や ''ya'', から ''kara'', まで ''made''====
To conjoin nouns, と ''to'' is used.
:かばんには、教科書三冊と漫画本五冊を入れています。
:''Kaban ni wa kyōkasho san-satsu to manga-bon go-satsu o irete imasu''
:I have three textbooks and five comic books in the bag.

The additive particle も  ''mo'' can be used to conjoin larger nominals and clauses.
:ヨハンはドイツ人だ。ブリゲッタもドイツ人だ。
:''YOHAN wa DOITSU-jin da. BURIGETTA mo DOITSU-jin da''
:Johann is a German. Brigitte is a German too.
:彼は映画スターであり、政治家でもある。
:''kare wa eiga SUTĀ de ari, seijika de mo aru''
:He is a movie star and also a politician.

For an incomplete list of conjuncts, や  ''ya'' is used.
:ボリスやイバンを呼べ。
:''BORISU ya IBAN o yobe''
:Call Boris, Ivan, etc.

When only one of the conjuncts is necessary, the disjunctive particle か  ''ka'' is used.
:寿司か刺身か、何か注文してね。
:''sushi ka sashimi ka, nanika chūmon shite ne''
:Please order ''sushi'' or ''sashimi'' or something.

Quantities are listed between から  ''kara'' 'from' and まで  ''made'' 'to'.
:華氏92度から96度までの熱は心配するものではない。
:''Kashi 92 do kara 96 do made no netsu wa shinpai suru mono de wa nai''
:A temperature between 92 Fahrenheit and 96 is not worrisome.

This pair can also be used to indicate time or space.
:朝9時(午前9時)から11時まで授業があるんだ。
:''asa ku-ji kara jūichi-ji made jugyō ga aru n da''
:You see, I have classes between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m.

Because ''kara'' indicates starting point or origin, it has a related use as "because", analogously to English "[[wikt:since|since]]" (in the sense of both "from" and "because"):
:スミスさんはとても積極的な人ですから、いつも全部頼まれているのかもしれません。
:''SUMISU-san wa totemo sekkyokuteki na hito desu kara, itsumo zenbu tanomarete iru no kamoshiremasen''
:Mr. Smith, because you're so assertive, you may always be asked to do everything.

The particle ''kara'' and a related particle ''yori'' are used to indicate lowest extents: prices, business hours, etc.
:私たちの店は7時より営業しております。
:''Watashitachi no mise wa shichi-ji yori eigyō shite orimasu''
:Our shop is open for business from 7 onwards.

''Yori'' is also used in the sense of "than".
:お前は姉ちゃんよりうるさいんだ!
:''omae wa nē-chan yori urusai n da''
:You are louder/more talkative than my elder sister!

====Coordinating: と ''to'', に ''ni'', よ ''yo''====
The particle と  ''to'' is used to set off quotations.
:「殺して... 殺して」とあの子は言っていた。
:''"koroshite... koroshite" to ano ko wa itteita''
:The girl was saying, "Kill me... kill me."
:猫がニャーニャーと鳴く。
:''neko ga NYĀ NYĀ to naku''
:The cat says meow, meow.

It is also used to indicate a manner of similarity, "as if", "like" or "the way".
:彼は「愛してるよ」と言って、ぽっくり'''と'''死んだ。
:''kare wa "aishiteru yo" to itte, pokkuri '''to''' shinda''
:He said "I love you," and dropped dead.

In a related conditional use, it functions like "after/when", or "upon".
:雨が上がると、子ども達は授業を忘れて、日の当たっている水たまりの誘惑に夢中になる。
:''ame ga agaru to, kodomo-tachi wa jugyou wo wasurete, hi no atatteiru mizutamari no yūwaku ni muchū ni naru''
:Rain stops and then: children, forgetting their lessons, give in to the temptation of sun-faced puddles.
:国境の長いトンネルを抜けると雪国であった。
:''kokkyō no nagai TONNERU wo nukeru to, yukiguni de atta''
:The train came out of the long tunnel (and then) into the snow country.

Finally it is used with verbs like ''to meet (with)'' (会う ''au'') or ''to speak (with)'' (話す ''hanasu'').
:ジョンがメアリーと初めて会ったのは、1942年の春の夕暮れ時のことだった。
:''JON ga MEARI to hajimete atta no wa, 1942 nen no haru no yūguredoki no koto datta''
:John met Mary for the first time on a dusky afternoon of spring in 1942.

This last use is also a function of the particle に  ''ni'', but ''to'' indicates reciprocation which ''ni'' does not.
:ジョンはメアリーと恋愛している。(usually say ジョンはメアリーと付き合っている。)
:''JON wa MEARI[Ī] to ren'ai shite iru (JON wa MEARI[Ī] to tsukiatte iru)''
:John and Mary are in love.
:ジョンはメアリーに恋愛している。(usually say ジョンはメアリーに恋している。)
:''JON wa MEARI[Ī] ni ren'ai shite iru (JON wa MEARI[Ī] ni koi shite iru)''
:John loves Mary (but Mary might not love John back).

Finally, the particle よ  ''yo'' is used in a hortative or vocative sense.
:可愛い娘よ、私に顔をしかめるな。
:''kawaii musume yo, watashi ni kao wo shikameruna''
:Oh my beloved daughter, don't frown at me so!

====Final: か ''ka'', ね ''ne'', よ ''yo'' and related====
The [[sentence-final particle]] か  ''ka'' turns a declarative sentence into a question.
:そちらはアメリカ人でしょうか?
:''sochira wa amerika-jin deshō ka?''
:Are you perchance an American?

Other sentence-final particles add emotional or emphatic impact to the sentence. The particle ね  ''ne'' softens a declarative sentence, similar to English "you know?", "eh?", "I tell you!", "isn't it?", "aren't you?", etc.
:彼に電話しなかったのね。
:''kare ni denwa shinakatta no ne''
:You didn't call him up, did you?
:近々ロンドンに引っ越されるそうですね。
:''chikajika rondon ni hikkosareru sou desu ne.''
:I hear you're moving to London soon. Is that true?

A final よ  ''yo'' is used in order to soften insistence, warning or command, which would sound very strong without any final particles.
:嘘なんかついてないよ！
:''uso nanka tsuite nai yo!''
:I'm not lying!

There are many such emphatic particles; some examples: ぜ  ''ze'' and ぞ  ''zo'' usually used by males; な  ''na'' a less formal form of ''ne''; わ  ''wa'' used by females (and males in the [[Kansai region]]) like ''yo'', etc. They are essentially limited to speech or transcribed dialogue.

====Compound particles====
Compound particles are formed with at least one particle together with other words, including other particles. The commonly seen forms are:
* particle + verb (term. or cont. or ''-te'' form)
* particle + noun + particle

Other structures are rarer, though possible. A few examples:
:その件&lt;u&gt;に関して&lt;/u&gt;知っている限りのことを教えてもらいたい。
:''sono ken &lt;u&gt;ni kan-shite&lt;/u&gt; shitte-iru kagiri no koto o oshiete moraitai''
:Kindly tell me everything you know concerning that case. (particle + verb in cont.)
:外国語を学習する&lt;u&gt;上で&lt;/u&gt;大切なことは毎日の努力がものを言うということである。
:''gaikokugo o gakushū suru &lt;u&gt;ue de&lt;/u&gt; taisetsu na koto wa mainichi no doryoku ga mono o iu to iu koto de aru''
:In studying a foreign language, daily effort gives the most rewards. (noun + particle)
:兄は両親の心配&lt;u&gt;をよそに&lt;/u&gt;、大学をやめてしまった。
:''ani wa ryōshin no shinpai &lt;u&gt;o yoso ni&lt;/u&gt;, daigaku o yamete shimatta''
:Ignoring my parents' worries, my brother dropped out of college. (particle + noun + particle)

===Auxiliary verbs===
All auxiliary verbs attach to a verbal or adjectival [[#Stem forms|stem form]] and conjugate as verbs. In modern Japanese there are two distinct classes of auxiliary verbs:
; Pure auxiliaries (助動詞 ''jodōshi'') : are usually just called ''verb endings'' or ''conjugated forms''. These auxiliaries do not function as independent verbs.
; Helper auxiliaries (補助動詞 ''hojodōshi'') : are normal verbs that lose their independent meaning when used as auxiliaries.

In classical Japanese, which was more heavily agglutinating than modern Japanese, the category of ''auxiliary verb'' included every verbal ending after the stem form, and most of these endings were themselves inflected. In modern Japanese, however, some of them have stopped being productive. The prime example is the classical auxiliary たり ''-tari'', whose modern forms た ''-ta'' and て ''-te'' are no longer viewed as inflections of the same suffix, and can take no further affixes.

| 思い知る  ''omoishiru'' 'to realize' → 思い知らせる  ''omoishiraseru'' 'to cause to realize/to teach a lesson'
|}
:&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; ます  ''masu'' has stem forms: irrealis ませ and ましょ, continuative まし, terminal ます, attributive ます, hypothetical ますれ, imperative ませ.
:&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; られる  ''rareru'' in potential usage is sometimes shortened to れる  ''reru'' (grp.&amp;nbsp;2); thus 食べれる  ''tabereru'' 'to be able to eat' instead of 食べられる  ''taberareru''. But it is considered non-standard.
:&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Technically, such an auxiliary verb る, ''ru'', denoting the potential form, does not exist, as for example 飲める  ''nomeru'' is thought to actually come from the contraction of 飲み得る, ''nomieru'' (see below). However, textbooks tend to teach it this way. (飲める in old texts would have been the attributive past tense form of 飲む instead of the potential meaning.)
:&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; させる  ''saseru'' is sometimes shortened to さす  ''sasu'' (grp.&amp;nbsp;1), but this usage is somewhat literary.

Much of the agglutinative flavour of Japanese stems from helper auxiliaries, however. The following table contains a small selection of many such auxiliary verbs.

Owen was a former Welsh teacher and Head of Lower school at [[Ysgol Gyfun Rhydfelen]] near [[Pontypridd]], [[South Wales]].

==Education==
John Owen was a former pupil and prefect at [[Ysgol Gyfun Rhydfelen]]. He completed his [[Bachelor_of_Education#United_Kingdom|Bachelor of Education]] degree in 1974 at [[Trinity College, Carmarthen|Trinity College]] in [[Carmarthen]]; in the same year he took up his first teaching appointment at his former secondary school.&lt;ref name="clywch" /&gt;

==Child abuse==
{{See also|Child abuse}}
In September 2001, John Owen was arrested and charged with serious criminal offences against children at Ysgol Gyfun Rhydfelen. On October the 4th 2001 John Owen was found dead at his caravan in Porthcawl having failed to appear in court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC News timeline of events|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/3853953.stm|accessdate=2008-11-15 | date=2004-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC News story|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/3857009.stm|accessdate=2008-11-15 | date=2004-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had committed suicide.&lt;ref name="walesonline" /&gt;

Later an inquiry was launched by the Children's Commissioner Peter Clarke called the “Clywch Report” which also listed some of the allegation against John Owen, and gave recommendations that should be implemented to stop something similar happening again.&lt;ref name="clywch"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Clywch Report|url=http://www.childcom.org.uk/uploads/publications/70.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15746">In marketing terminology, a '''killer application''' (commonly shortened to '''killer app''') is any [[computer program]] that is so necessary or desirable that it proves the core value of some larger technology, such as [[computer hardware]], a [[video game console|gaming console]], [[software]], a [[programming language]], a [[software platform]], or an [[operating system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Killer app|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/killer%20app|website=Merrian-Webmaster|publisher=Merriam-Webster, Incorporated|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, consumers would buy the (usually expensive) hardware just to run that application.

[[File:Visicalc.png|thumb|[[VisiCalc]], the earliest generally agreed-upon example of a killer application]]
One of the first recognized examples of a killer application is generally agreed to be the [[VisiCalc]] [[spreadsheet]] for the [[Apple II series]].&lt;ref&gt;D.J. Power,
   ''[http://www.dssresources.com/history/sshistory.html A Brief History of Spreadsheets]'',
   DSSResources.COM, v3.6, 8 August 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Because it was not available on other computers for 12 months, people spent $100 for the software first, then $2,000 to $10,000 on the Apple computer they needed to run it.&lt;ref name="mcmullen19840221"&gt;{{cite magazine | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UCIvSU6Y2GAC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA120#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true | title=Apple Charts The Course For IBM |magazine=PC Magazine | date=1984-02-21 | accessdate=24 October 2013 | author=McMullen, Barbara E. and John F. |page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[BYTE]]'' wrote in 1980, "VisiCalc is the first program available on a microcomputer that has been responsible for sales of entire systems",&lt;ref name="ramsdell198011"&gt;{{cite magazine | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1980-11/1980_11_BYTE_05-11_High-Resolution_Graphics#page/n247/mode/2up | title=The Power of VisiCalc |magazine=BYTE | date=November 1980 | accessdate=18 October 2013 | author=Ramsdell, Robert E | pages=190–192}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''[[Creative Computing]]''{{'}}s VisiCalc review was subtitled "reason enough for owning a computer".&lt;ref name="green198008"&gt;{{cite magazine | url=https://archive.org/stream/creativecomputing-1980-08/Creative_Computing_v06_n08_1980_Aug#page/n29/mode/2up | title=VisiCalc: Reason Enough For Owning A Computer |magazine=Creative Computing | date=August 1980 | accessdate=18 October 2013 | author=Green, Doug |page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others also chose to develop software, such as [[EasyWriter]], for the Apple II first because of its higher sales, helping Apple defeat rivals [[Commodore International]] and [[Tandy Corporation]].{{r|mcmullen19840221}}

[[Lotus 1-2-3]] similarly benefited sales of the [[IBM PC]] and [[PC compatible|compatibles]], just as VisiCalc did for Apple sales. Noting that computer purchasers did not want PC compatibility as much as compatibility with certain PC software, ''InfoWorld'' suggested "let's tell it like it is. Let's not say 'PC compatible,' or even 'MS-DOS compatible.' Instead, let's say '1-2-3 compatible.'"{{r|mcmullen19840221}}&lt;ref name="clapp19840227"&gt;{{cite magazine | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gy4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;pg=PA22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true | title=PC compatibility |magazine=InfoWorld | date=1984-02-27 | accessdate=18 January 2015 | author=Clapp, Doug |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another killer app is [[WordStar]], the most popular [[word processor]] during much of the 1980s.&lt;ref name="bergin2006"&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Origins of Word Processing Software for Personal Computers: 1976-1985 | author=Bergin, Thomas J. | journal=IEEE Annals of the History of Computing |date=Oct–Dec 2006 | volume=28 | issue=4 | pages=32–47 | doi=10.1109/MAHC.2006.76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the Internet became more widely available to consumers, email was seen as a killer app that drove people to purchase computers, even though email is a genre of applications rather than a single "app."

The [[UNIX|UNIX Operating System]] served as a killer application for the [[PDP-11|DEC PDP-11 minicomputer]] and [[VAX-11|VAX-11 minicomputer]] during roughly 1975–1985. Many of the PDP-11 and VAX-11 processors never ran DEC's operating systems (RSTS or VAX/VMS), but instead, they ran UNIX, which was first licensed in 1975.  To get a virtual-memory UNIX ([[Berkeley_Software_Distribution#3BSD|BSD 3.0]]) you had to purchase a VAX-11 computer.  Many universities wanted a general-purpose timesharing system that would meet the needs of students and researchers (early versions of UNIX included free compilers for C, Fortran, and Pascal; at the time, offering even one free compiler was unprecedented).  From its inception UNIX could drive high-quality typesetting equipment and later [[PostScript]] printers using the [[nroff]]/[[troff]] typesetting language, and this was also unprecedented for its time.  UNIX was the first operating system offered in source-license form (a university license cost only $10,000, less than a PDP-11), allowing it to run on an unlimited number of machines, and allowing the machines to interface to any type of hardware because the UNIX I/O system was extensible.

==Usage==
The first recorded use of the term in print was 1988, in ''PC Week'' 24 May. 39/1. "Everybody has only one killer application. The secretary has a word processor. The manager has a spreadsheet."&lt;ref&gt;Earliest usage cited in [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/103376 ''Oxford English Dictionary'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of "killer app" came up during Bill Gates's questioning in the ''[[United States v. Microsoft Corp. (2001)|United States v. Microsoft Corp.]]'' antitrust case. Bill Gates had written an email in which he described Internet Explorer as a killer app. In the questioning, he said that the term meant "a popular application", and did not connote an application that would fuel sales of a larger product or one that would supplant its competition, as the Microsoft Computer Dictionary defined it.

===Video games===
The term has also been applied to [[Video game|computer and video games]] that cause consumers to buy a particular [[video game console]] or gaming hardware over a competing one, by virtue of being exclusive to that platform. Such a game is also known in gaming parlance as a "system seller". Examples of a video game killer applications are:
* The first generally agreed example of a "killer app" in gaming is the 1980 [[Atari 2600|Atari VCS]] port of the arcade game ''[[Space Invaders]]'', which quadrupled sales of the then three-year-old console .&lt;ref name="RG-41"&gt;{{Cite magazine|date=September 2007| title= The Definitive Space Invaders|magazine= [[Retro Gamer]]| publisher= [[Imagine Publishing]]|issue= 41| pages= 24–33 | url= http://www.nowgamer.com/features/152/the-definitive-space-invaders-part-1 | accessdate=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The port of ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'' was the killer app for the [[ColecoVision]] console in 1982.
* The video gaming website [[GameTrailers]] considers the ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' games to be the killer app for nearly all [[Nintendo]] home consoles, ''[[Tetris]]'' as the killer app for the [[Game Boy]], ''[[Grand Theft Auto III]]'' for the [[PlayStation 2]], ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'' for the [[Nintendo GameCube]], and ''[[Wii Sports]]'' for the [[Wii]].

* ''Computer Gaming World'' stated that ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]'' on the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], ''[[Phantasy Star II]]'' on the [[Sega Genesis]], and ''[[Far East of Eden]]'' for the NEC [[TurboGrafx-16]] were killer apps for their consoles.&lt;ref name="adams199011"&gt;{{cite magazine | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1990&amp;pub=2&amp;id=76 | title=Westward Ho!

* ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (1991 video game)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'', released in 1991, was hailed as a killer app as it revived sales of the (by then) three-year-old Genesis.
* ''[[Street Fighter II]]'', originally released for arcades in 1991, became a system-seller for the Super Nintendo when it was ported to the platform in 1992.&lt;ref name="egm_influential_sf2"&gt;{{cite web|last=Patterson|first=Eric L.|title=EGM Feature: The 5 Most Influential Japanese Games Day Four: Street Fighter II|url=http://www.egmnow.com/articles/news/egm-featurethe-5-most-influential-japanese-gamesday-four-street-fighter-ii/|work=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|accessdate=17 April 2012|date=November 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Myst]]'' and ''[[The 7th Guest]]'', both released in 1993, drove adoption of [[CD-ROM]] drives for [[personal computer]]s.
* [[Pokémon Red and Blue|''Pokémon Red'' and ''Blue'']] could be classified a "killer app" for the seven-year-old [[Game Boy line|Game Boy]] as a craze evolved around the series in the late 1990s, and it was only available on that platform.
* [[Pokémon Gold and Silver|''Pokémon Gold'' and ''Silver'']] were released at the height of the Pokémon craze alongside the [[Game Boy Color]], and fueled the sales for the console all the way to the release of the [[Game Boy Advance]] two years later.
* ''[[Super Mario 64]]'', ''[[GoldenEye 007 (1997 video game)|GoldenEye 007]]'' and ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time]]'' could be considered killer apps for the [[Nintendo 64]], with ''Super Mario 64'' being one of two launch titles for the console and the main factor behind the platform's initial success.
*''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'' could be{{vague|date=March 2016}} considered the killer app for [[3dfx]]'s Voodoo Graphics 3D accelerator card for home computers. {{citation needed|date=October 2016}}
*''[[The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings]]'' was regarded as a killer app for [[Xbox 360]] but its sequel ''[[The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt]]'' was available for [[PlayStation 4]] and not only [[Xbox One]].
*Highly popular games such as ''[[Bayonetta 2]]'', ''[[Batman: Arkham City]]'' and ''[[Call of Duty: Black Ops II]]'' were arguably killer apps for [[Wii U]] due to the relative shortage of video games belonging to the same genre as the aforementioned ones for [[Wii]] consoles.
*''[[PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale]]'' included characters from many killer apps for [[PlayStation 3]] such as ''[[Killzone 3]]'', ''[[God of War III]]'', ''[[Infamous 2]]'' and ''[[Ratchet &amp; Clank: All 4 One]]'', all published in 2011 with [[Killzone (series)|each]] of [[God of War (franchise)|these]] games being [[Infamous (series)|part]] of a [[Ratchet &amp; Clank|large]] franchise.
*''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'' and its [[Super Mario Galaxy|sequel]] were acclaimed as [[List of video games considered the best|two of the greatest video games of all time]] and killer apps for [[Wii]].
* ''[[Gears of War]]'' and ''[[Uncharted]]'', specifically the [[Gears of War 2|second]] and [[Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception|third]] [[Gears of War 3|installments]] of [[Uncharted 2: Among Thieves|both]] series, were prominent killer apps for [[Xbox 360]] and [[PlayStation 3]] as well as their sequels ''[[Gears of War 4]]'' and ''[[Uncharted 4: A Thief's End]]'' for [[Xbox One]] and [[PlayStation 4]], respectively.

'''Kuikuro''' or '''Kuikuroan''' is a dialect of the Upper Xingu Language spoken by the [[Kuikuro people]]. The Kuikuro are a group of Indigenous people living in [[Mato Grosso]], [[Brazil]]. The Upper Xingu Language is part of the Southern branch of the [[Cariban languages|Cariban]] language family. Although bilingualism in [[Brazilian Portuguese]] is prevalent among the men of the community, Kuikuro is not as immediately endangered as many of Brazilian Indigenous languages. As of 2006, there are an estimated 1,106 native speakers of Kuikuro worldwide, yielding the language a "Threatened" classification by [[Endangered Languages Project|The Endangered Languages Project.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.endangeredlanguages.com/lang/1852|title=Did you know Kuikuro is threatened?|website=Endangered Languages|language=en|access-date=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In collaboration with linguist Bruna Franchetto, the Kuikuro have created a library of recordings that feature Kuikuro stories in the language that is archived at the [[Archive of the Indigenous Languages of Latin America]]

== Morphology ==
Kuikuro is a dialect of the Upper Xingu Carib Language, which is a member of the Southern branch of the Carib family. Like most of the Carib family, Kuikuro is an [[agglutinative]] language with a highly complex [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] that effects both verbs and nouns. It is head-final and dependent marking. Its case system is ergative. A sample sentence shows the S/O V structure, the morphological richness, and the [[ergativity]] of Kuikuro:

katsogo-ko heke kangamuke-ko kagine-nügü&lt;ref&gt;Franchetto, B., &amp; Mehinaku, M., &amp; Santos, M. (2007) Concepts and forms of ‘plurality’ in Kuikuro. Pg. 101&lt;/ref&gt; 
dog-PL     ERG  child-PL     frighten-PNCT 
‘(the) dogs frightened (the) children’

=== Plurality ===
Kuikuro nouns can occur bare, with both number and definiteness being unmarked. Like many other neutral number languages ([[Korean language|Korean]], for example) there is a [[morpheme]] which - when affixed to a noun - denotes it as plural and marked. In Kuikuro this is the morpheme /-ko/. The following is demonstrative of one of the morpheme’s regular usages.&lt;ref&gt;Franchetto, Bruna; Santos, Mara; Lima, Suzi. Count/Mass distinction in Kuikuro: on individuation and counting.&lt;/ref&gt;

# kanga
  ‘(the/a/some) fish/es’
# kanga-ko
  ‘(the/some) fishes’
# *ehu-ko
  ‘(the/some) canoes’

It is important to note here that the morpheme /-ko/ is only used on nouns that are [+[[Animacy|animate]]] as in (2) but not (3).

In addition to the bound morpheme /-ko/, there is a quantifier which also serves to pluralize nouns; /tuguhu/. This quantifier is used to indicate that its entire constituent is pluralized. Unlike /-ko/ it can be used to mark plurality on nouns that are [-animate]. The following data is a minimal pair of readings that show the scope of /tuguhu/ and its usage as a pluralizer of [-animate] nouns.&lt;ref&gt;Franchetto, B., &amp; Mehinaku, M., &amp; Santos, M. (2007) Concepts and forms of ‘plurality’ in Kuikuro. Pg. 104-105&lt;/ref&gt;

# *ehu   tuhugu          etenegü          tuhugu 
  Canoe  many.together   paddle canoe     many.together 
  ‘(the) paddles of (the) canoes’
# [ehu etene-gü]       tuhugu 
  canoe paddle-REL     many.together  
  ‘(the) paddles of the canoe(s)

The preceding two morphemes are pluralizers of non-collective nouns. There is another set of morphemes which collectivize and pluralize nouns into sets that are – generally – based on the Kuikuro understanding of inter-personal relationships and kinship. Below is demonstrative of the collectivization concept, but not necessarily of the phono-morphological reality of its creation.&lt;ref name=franchetto2007&gt;Franchetto, B., &amp; Mehinaku, M., &amp; Santos, M. (2007) Concepts and forms of ‘plurality’ in Kuikuro. Pg. 108&lt;/ref&gt;

# u-hi-sü    			u-hi-jão  
  1-younger.brother-REL         1- younger.brother-REL.COLL 
‘my younger brother’            ‘all those whom I call ‘my younger brother’’

These collective plurals and the collective plural morphemes are rich and complex and warrant further study.

=== Pronouns and Pronominals ===
Pronouns and pronominal expressions in Kuikuro are bound morphemes that can be prefixed onto nouns, verbs, and certain particles. A partial set is listed below, allomorphs are not included.&lt;ref name=franchetto2007 /&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!  !! Singular !! Plural
|-
| First ||u- || ku- (dual, inclusive)
|-
| Second || e- || e- -ko
|-
| Third || is- || is- -ko
|}

These pronouns - when affixed to a VP - have an [[Absolutive case|absolutive]] reading.

# e-iniluN-ta(gü)-ko 
  2-cry-CONT(-REL)-PL 
  ‘you (pl) are crying ‘

To affect an ergative reading of a pronoun, it is prefixed to the ergative particle /heke/. The data below also shows that /-ko/ - as a pronominal pluralizer – is placed at the end of the verb construction.

# e-ini-ta(gü)-ko       u-heke 
  2-see-CONT(-REL)-PL   1-ERG
  ‘I’m looking at you (pl)’

Apart from their use as arguments for VPs, pronouns are also used to denote possession on NPs. These possessive prefixes are generally the same as their pronominal counter-parts. The data below also shows how the possessive pronouns are also split if they are in the plural.

# i-tahaku-gu-ko 
  3-bow-REL-PL 
  ‘their bow(s)

Pronouns surface in Kuikuro as pronominal prefixes. They can act as arguments when attached to VPs or certain morphemes like /heke/, and they can act as possessives. They also display a number of phonologically conditioned allomorphs. Unlike its treatment of plurality, Kuikuro’s use of pronouns is largely unremarkable.

== Syntax ==

=== Case ===
Kuikuro from a typological prospective is ergative. There is no obvious absolutive case marker. The morpheme /heke/ is used with some variety of nominal or pronominal argument to denote the ergativity of the argument. Below is an example of a basic sentence.&lt;ref&gt;Franchetto, B. (2010) “The ergativity in effect in Kuikuro”. 121-158.&lt;/ref&gt;

# u-ahetinhomba-tagü  i-heke
  1abs-help-cont      3-erg 
  ‘he is helping me’

However, there is also data that suggests that there is an accusative element to the Kuikuro case system. This is shown in clefting situations, where /heke/ is not used and the language must find other strategies for showing case. In these scenarios, the verb takes on additional morphology to show for a non-agentive reading on the initial argument. Below is a pair of sentences that show the changes in their canonical form.&lt;ref&gt;Franchetto, B. (2010) “The ergativity in effect in Kuikuro”. Pg 144-145&lt;/ref&gt;

# u-ingãtzu-ha   ekise-I   hikutaha  enge-ni-mbüngü
  1-sister-af    3d-cop    turtle    eat-agnr-subs 
  ‘it was my sister who ate the turtle
# hikutaha-ha   ege-I       u-ingãtzu   ng-enge-tagü
  turtle-af     ddist-cop   1-sister    om-eat-cont 
  ‘it was a turtle that my sister was eating’

The ‘ng-‘ in the second example above is an object marker which blocks the reading of the sentence from being “it was a turtle that was eating my sister.”&lt;ref&gt;Rill, Justin. Syntactic ergativity: a typological approach. Pg. 224&lt;/ref&gt; This is some evidence towards an accusative reading. But, there is no morphology on the argument itself and so it would be difficult to announce this as an accusative case rather than a different focus of the verb.

Other than the possible issues presented above, Kuikuro is a rather straightforward example of an ergative case system.

== Semantics ==

=== Constructions with Numerals ===
Numerals function quite differently in Kuikuro than the typical Indo-European system. First, there are morphemes for 1-5 and 10 only. The rest of the numerals are phrasal.&lt;ref&gt;Franchetto, Bruna; Santos, Mara; Lima, Suzi. Count/Mass distinction in Kuikuro: on individuation and counting. Pg. 9-13&lt;/ref&gt;

# aetsi 		‘One’ 
  takeko 		‘Two’ 
  tilako 		‘Three’ 
  tatakegeni 	        ‘Four’ 
  nhatüi 		‘Five’ 
  timüho 		‘Ten’

The rest of the numbers from 6-9 and 11-20 are expressed through phrase-level constructions such as the following.

# tilako   inkguge-toho   hügape
  three    cross-INSTNR   on.foot
  ‘Eighteen’

In NP-modifying constructions, numerals can occur either before the NP to be modified or at the end of the sentence.

# konige     tilako  tahitse  ingi-lü    u-heke 
  yesterday  three   macaw    see-PNCT   1- ERG 
  ‘Yesterday I saw three macaws’
# konige      tahitse  ingi-lü    u-heke   tilako 
  yesterday   macaw    see-PNCT   1- ERG   three 
  ‘Yesterday I saw three macaws’

Neither of the above examples can be read as having been counting the VP. To achieve this, the numeral must occur immediately preceding the VP it is quantifying.

# ige 	 ngune-mbeke  tilako  u-hülu   ihisundu 
  DPROX  moon-TEMP    three   1-walk   unit 
  ‘I traveled three times this month’

Critically, the above cannot be read as ‘three months’ but has to be a verb-numeral construction.

The counting of mass nouns hinges on the fact that Kuikuro is a number neutral language. In this system nouns can occur as either plural or singular and can occur bare. The Kuikuro grammar allows mass nouns to be counted using an assumed container. The following is a typical form.

# tilako nhukau 
  three  pequi.oil 
  ‘three bottles of pequi oil’
# tilako  u-ngipi  nhukau     ingü 
  three   1-have   pequi.oil  container 
  ‘I have three bottles of pequi oil’

Note that the morpheme /ingü/ is non-obligatory and that the container is assumed. This structure follows for all kinds of mass nouns.

She made her literary debut in 1997 when the journal ''La Plume'' published her short story “''Kkumkkuneun marionetteu''” (꿈꾸는 마리오네뜨 The Dreaming Marionette) and novella ''Sangja sogeui pureun kal'' (상자 속의 푸른 칼 Blue Knife in the Box).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.changbi.com/books/8320?board_id=7736|title=꿈꾸는 마리오네뜨 {{!}} 창비 – Changbi Publishers|website=www.changbi.com|language=ko-KR|access-date=2017-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; She won the 26th [[Yi Sang Literary Award]] in 2002 for her short story "''Baemjangeo styu''" (뱀장어 스튜 Eel Stew) and the 6th Dongin Literary Award in 2005 for ''Kkotgemudeom'' (꽃게무덤 Crab Grave).

== Life ==
Kwon Ji-ye was born in [[Gyeongju]], South Korea in 1960. She studied English literature at [[Ewha Womans University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=001&amp;aid=0000298563|title=&lt;문화계 신년인터뷰&gt;-①소설가 권지예|access-date=2017-09-26|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her time at Ewha, she was part of the literary society Darakbang (“Attic”) and won a writing contest run by the school. After graduating, however, her full-time job kept her from writing for nearly a decade. Her first job was at the publisher Minumsa and she went on to teach at a middle school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hankyung.com/news/app/newsview.php?aid=2011072241241&amp;intype=1|title=[파워 인터뷰] 소설가 권지예 씨 "밤마다 눈감고 영화 찍던 추억이 '영상적 글쓰기'의 비결"|date=2011-07-22|work=hankyung.com|access-date=2017-09-26|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then in 1991, she left for France and enrolled in the Asian studies program at [[Paris Diderot University]]. She wrote her doctoral dissertation on women in modern [[Korean literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.changbi.com/books/8320?board_id=7736|title=꿈꾸는 마리오네뜨 {{!}} 창비 – Changbi Publishers|website=www.changbi.com|language=ko-KR|access-date=2017-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason Kwon decided to continue her studies was that she believed a writing career would make her unhappy, even though she had wanted to become a writer since she was a student. Yet her stay in Paris turned out to spur her literary ambitions. She began writing to cope with the loneliness of living abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=001&amp;aid=0000298563|title=&lt;문화계 신년인터뷰&gt;-①소설가 권지예|access-date=2017-09-26|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; She made her literary debut in 1997 while she was still in Paris. In 1999, she returned to South Korea to focus on her literary career.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=1233097&amp;cid=40942&amp;categoryId=33385|title=권지예|access-date=2017-09-26|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; She taught creative writing at [[Hanzhong University]], but quit in 2003 to write full-time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=001&amp;aid=0000298563|title=&lt;문화계 신년인터뷰&gt;-①소설가 권지예|access-date=2017-09-26|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Writing ==
A central theme in Kwon Ji-ye’s works is love. Her novels often feature the voices of women who yearn for passion in their lives. They explore the psychology of women in love and portray how love breaks down and disappears in our everyday lives. Kwon’s female protagonists often find romance through steamy affairs. They tend to have marriage troubles and attempt to fight their romantic fantasies or desire for an exciting life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.changbi.com/books/8320?board_id=7736|title=꿈꾸는 마리오네뜨 {{!}} 창비 – Changbi Publishers|website=www.changbi.com|language=ko-KR|access-date=2017-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kwon’s first short story collection ''Kkumkkuneun marionetteu'' (꿈꾸는 마리오네뜨 The Dreaming Marionette) depicts protagonists cheating on their partners driven by lust. ''Yuhok'' (유혹 Seduction) is about a divorced college lecturer named Oh Yumi who flouts traditional sexual ethics and has multiple lovers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://hei.hankyung.com/news/app/newsview.php?aid=2011072076077&amp;intype=1|title=권지예 "짐승은 발정하지만 인간은 유혹한다"|work=권지예 "짐승은 발정하지만 인간은 유혹한다"|access-date=2017-09-26|language=ko-KR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all of Kwon’s works focus on desires that deviate from social norms. Her 2010 novel ''Sawoleui mulgogi'' (4월의 물고기 April Fish) is about a pair of destined lovers in a monogamous relationship. Kwon mentioned in an interview that her views on love have changed as she grew older.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hankyung.com/news/app/newsview.php?aid=2010011771051&amp;intype=1|title="운명적 사랑, 미스터리 스릴러로 꾸몄죠"|date=2010-01-17|work=hankyung.com|access-date=2017-09-26|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are an unknown number of indigenous [[deaf sign language]]s in [[Laos]], which may have historical connections with the languages indigenous to [[Vietnam]] and [[Thailand]], though it is not known if they are related to each other. There is no single "Laotian Sign Language".

'''Livemocha''' was an online [[language learning]] community, providing instructional materials in 38 languages and a platform for speakers to interact with and help each other learn new languages. According to the site, it had approximately 12 million registered members from 196 countries around the globe. It was free to join and use; however, it offered the option to pay for various benefits.  In 2012, 400,000 users visited the site daily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Livemocha statistics|url=http://www.wolframalpha.com/entities/web_domains/livemocha.com/k7/0v/z7/|publisher=Wolfram Alpha|accessdate=5 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company was founded in 2007 by Raghav Kher, Shirish Nadkarni and Krishnan Seshadrinathan. They conceived the idea for a web-based approach which utilized the power of [[social networking sites]] for language learning, with an emphasis on active participation and exchange in order to hone practical skills and conversational fluency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schmidt|first=Clint|title=Livemocha and the Power of Social Language Learning|journal=IH Journal of Education and Development|date=Spring 2010|issue=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The name "Livemocha" was invented by the founders during a brainstorming session at a local café, and was meant to evoke the relaxed atmosphere of a coffee shop. On June 8, 2010, Michael Schutzler was announced as the new CEO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Huang, Gregory T. |title= ''Schutzler Joins Livemocha as New CEO'' |location= www.seattlepi.com |publisher= ''[[Hearst Corporation|Hearst Newspapers]]'' |date= June 8, 2010 |url= http://www.seattlepi.com/xconomy/421379_xconomy83509.html |accessdate= April 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their headquarters were in [[Seattle]], Washington.

The site received attention from trade publications and national and international newspapers, including the ''New York Times''&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wayner|first=Peter|title=Learning a Language from an Expert, on the Web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/29/technology/personaltech/29basics.html|accessdate=4 January 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes_a"&gt;{{cite news|last=Eisenberg|first=Anne|title=Learning from a Native Speaker, Without Leaving Home|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/17/business/17novel.html|accessdate=4 January 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Financial Times''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hoare|first=Stephen|title=Communication: Students Appreciate Polyglot Approach|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/c1cf5952-4b72-11e0-89d8-00144feab49a.html#axzz1h6dSwyPe|accessdate=5 January 2012|newspaper=Financial Times|date=March 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Time'' magazine named Livemocha one of its 50 Best Websites in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=50 Best Websites 2010|magazine=Time Magazine|date=August 25, 2010|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2012721_2012929_2012923,00.html|accessdate=5 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 2, 2013, [[Rosetta Stone (company)|Rosetta Stone]] announced that it had acquired Livemocha.&lt;ref name="rs_press_release"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20130402005459/en/Rosetta-Stone-Acquires-Online-Language-Company-Livemocha|title= Rosetta Stone Acquires Online Language Company Livemocha |publisher=BusinessWire|date= 2 April 2013 |accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards, the Livemocha website required users' computers to have proprietary [[operating system]] [[Windows]] or [[Mac OS]], blocking access from [[free software]] operating systems.
On January 8, 2014, Livemocha closed access to its legacy website.&lt;ref name="rs_Internal_document"&gt;{internal email}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Livemocha's website posted an announcement&lt;ref&gt;[http://livemocha.com|URL where announcement appears as of 3/23/2016]&lt;/ref&gt; saying  {{cquote|Unfortunately, the Livemocha community will close permanently on Friday, April 22, 2016, and you will no longer be able to access your account after that date.}}
As early as December 2017 a new (self-employed) developer decided to recreate Livemocha to continue the primary concept of the network that was to help globalization by teaching new languages easily, now Livemocha has been recreated as [http://livemocha.co/redirect.php livemocha.co], social network for language learning completely free, as well as an Android [http://livemocha.co/redirect.php app Livemocha]

==Basic courses==

Livemocha supported 38 languages: [[English language|English]], [[Modern Standard Arabic|Arabic]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Estonian language|Estonian]], [[Farsi language|Farsi]],  [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Modern Greek language|Greek]], [[Modern Hebrew|Hebrew]], [[Hindi language|Hindi]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Latvian language|Latvian]], [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin Chinese]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian (Bokmål)]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Portuguese (Brazil)]], [[Portuguese (Portugal)]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Urdu language|Urdu]], and [[Esperanto]], which was the most recent addition.

The site could be viewed in 12 different languages: [[American English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin Chinese]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and [[Turkish language|Turkish]].

Free basic courses were offered in all the above languages, consisting of roughly 30–50 hours of coursework. Several languages, like [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] and Brazilian Portuguese, were first added to Livemocha through the process of "Member Translation": members fluent in two or more languages could translate already available course materials into their native tongue and publish the results on the site, with other users rating and improving the translations.

==Active courses==
More advanced courses—called "Active Courses"—were available in five languages: English, French, German, Italian and Spanish. These courses required a monthly or annual fee and were intended to achieve conversational fluency. Instead of signing up for one particular course, users could opt to purchase the "Gold Key" which granted unlimited access to premium or paid content. The active courses proceeded through four levels of proficiency, and included reading, writing, speaking, and listening exercises.

==Peer feedback==
Each reviewer earned 20 tokens for reviewing a user's submission. The reviewer could earn an extra 10 tokens for the first review of the passage or conversation. The writing was rated using three criteria: spelling, proficiency, and grammar. The speaking was rated using two criteria: pronunciation and proficiency. Each submission from a basic course for peer review cost 120 tokens.

==Member reviews==

Completed exercises from both basic and active courses could be sent out for review by other members (native or fluent speakers), who provided feedback and tips. Members could also pay for "Expert Reviews" from language teachers that had been certified by Livemocha for 120 tokens. The user could rate the quality of these reviews, and choose to work with a particular expert reviewer. Private instruction sessions, conducted via video chat with a selected tutor, were also available for purchase.

Members earned "Mochapoints" by completing exercises and reviewing other people's submissions. These points are not to be confused with the tokens. The tokens were earned for rating other people's submissions, or from paying a set fee in real life currency for a certain number of tokens. Mochapoints were a way to keep track of one's progress and to compare the amount of time a user has put into the website compared to others. A user gained Mochapoints for entering submissions, grading other people's submissions, chatting with other users, etc. They could not be spent for content access in the same way that the tokens could be.

==Language learning and social networks==

Livemocha called itself the largest language learning community in the world. In many ways it operated like a social networking site, and the basic ethos of the system was peer-to-peer: registered members could engage in synchronous and asynchronous communication, make a personal profile, connect with a circle of friends, upload content (there was a page dedicated to cultural exchange), contribute translations and help expand the base of available languages, and review other members’ work, such as recorded dialogues from lessons. It was referred to as "the Facebook of foreign languages,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Myers|first=Aaron G.|title=Best Language Learning Resources: Livemocha|url=http://www.everydaylanguagelearner.com/2011/02/21/best-language-learning-resources-livemocha/|publisher=The Everyday Language Learner|accessdate=4 January 2012|date=February 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Posgate|first=Natalie|title=Learn a new language through social media, the Web, or mobile apps|url=http://www.smudailycampus.com/pony-post-learn-a-new-language-through-social-media-the-web-or-mobile-apps-1.2691479#.Ttz64M20Z15|accessdate=4 January 2012|newspaper=The Daily Campus|date=November 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its potential impact on conventional language teaching compared to that of Wikipedia on the traditional encyclopedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Livemocha Review|url=http://learn-english-review.toptenreviews.com/livemocha-review.html|publisher=TopTenREVIEWS|accessdate=4 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One reviewer of the site observed, "With its unparalleled ability to connect people throughout the world, [the Internet] is changing the way that many people learn languages. There is still no way to avoid the hard slog through vocabulary lists and grammar rules, but the books, tapes and even CDs of yesteryear are being replaced by e-mail, video chats and social networks."&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;

==Partnership in Brazil==
In September 2011, Livemocha announced a partnership with the Brazilian education company Abril Educação, part of the media conglomerate Grupo Abril, which purchased a 5.9% stake in the company. Abril Educação promoted Livemocha to consumers and organizations throughout Brazil, with the aim of catering to the rising demand for language education and helping the country prepare to host the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gill|first=Martha|title=Brazil: Learning Inglês by Internet|url=http://blogs.ft.com/beyond-brics/2011/09/09/brazil-learning-ingles-by-internet/#axzz1h6dxHdE7|accessdate=4 January 2012|newspaper=Financial Times|date=September 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Winkler|first=Kirsten|title=Abril Educacao buys 5.9% of Livemocha—Building English Learning Platform for Brazil’s Middle Class|url=http://www.edukwest.com/abril-educacao-buys-5-9-of-livemocha-building-english-learning-platform-for-brazils-middle-class/|accessdate=4 January 2012|newspaper=Edukwest|date=September 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In January 2011, Livemocha announced an agreement with Telefônica Brasil to offer its Internet customers discounted pricing on Livemocha's English courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cook|first=John|title=Livemocha inks marketing pact with Telefonica Brazil|url=http://www.techflash.com/seattle/2011/01/livemocha-partners-with-telefonica.html|publisher=TechFlash|accessdate=4 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public libraries==
Access to Livemocha's courses was available for free through a number of public libraries in the US that subscribe to the site, including the [http://www.spl.org/library-collection/articles-and-research/languages Seattle Public Library].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cook|first=John|title=Livemocha opens door on language learning at Seattle Public Library|url=http://www.geekwire.com/2011/livemocha-opens-door-language-learning-seattle-public-libraries|publisher=GeekWire|accessdate=4 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Finance==
Livemocha was a privately held company. In 2011, it raised 5 million dollars in venture capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lamm|first=Greg|title=LiveMocha raises $5M|url=http://www.techflash.com/seattle/2011/07/bellevue-startup-livemocha-raises-5m.html|publisher=TechFlash|accessdate=4 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In previous years it raised 14 million dollars from investors August Capital and Maveron.&lt;ref&gt;"Livemocha Secures $6 Million in Venture Capital Series A Funding Led by Maveron: Funding to Accelerate Popular Language Learning Site’s Functionality and Growth", http://www.livemocha.com/pages/pr/01152008, January 15, 2008.

'''Moore's paradox''' concerns the apparent absurdity involved in asserting a first-person present-tense sentence such as, "It's raining, but I don't believe that it is raining" or "It's raining but I believe that it is not raining." The first author to note this apparent absurdity was [[G. E. Moore]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite book |first=G. E. |last=Moore |chapter=Moore's Paradox |editor-first=Thomas |editor-last=Baldwin |title=G. E. Moore: Selected Writings |location=London |publisher=Routledge |year=1993 |pages=207–212 |isbn=978-0-415-09853-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These 'Moorean' sentences, as they have become known, are paradoxical in that while they appear absurd, they nevertheless:
# Can be true,
# Are (logically) consistent, and moreover
# Are not (obviously) [[contradiction]]s.
The term 'Moore's paradox' is attributed to [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Ludwig |last=Wittgenstein |title=Philosophical Investigations |location= |publisher=Blackwell Publishers |year=1953 |others=Section II.x |page=190 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who considered the paradox Moore's most important contribution to philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Ludwig |last=Wittgenstein |title=Letters to Russell, Keynes and Moore |editor-first=G. H. |editor-last=von Wright |location=Oxford |publisher=Blackwell Publishers |year=1974 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wittgenstein wrote about the paradox extensively in his later writings, which brought Moore's paradox the attention it would not have otherwise received.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Ludwig |last=Wittgenstein |title=Remarks on the Philosophy of Psychology, Volume I |editor1-first=G. E. M. |editor1-last=Anscombe |editor2-first=G. H. |editor2-last=von Wright |others=Translated by G. E. M. Anscombe |location=Oxford |publisher=Blackwell Publishers |year=1980 |isbn=978-0-631-12541-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moore's paradox has also been connected to many other of the well-known [[paradox#Logical paradox|logical paradoxes]] including, though not limited to, the [[liar paradox]], the [[knower paradox]], the [[unexpected hanging paradox]], and the [[preface paradox]].&lt;ref name="Sorensen"&gt;{{Cite book |first=Roy A. |last=Sorensen |year=1988 |title=Blindspots |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-824981-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is currently no generally accepted explanation of Moore's paradox in the philosophical literature. However, while Moore's paradox remains a philosophical curiosity, Moorean-type sentences are used by logicians, computer scientists, and those working in the [[artificial intelligence]] community as examples of cases in which a knowledge, belief, or information system is unsuccessful in updating its knowledge/belief/information store in light of new or novel information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hendricks | first=Vincent F. | last2=Symons | first2=John | title=Where's the Bridge? Epistemology and Epistemic Logic | journal=Philosophical Studies | volume=128 | issue=1 | year=2006 | issn=0031-8116 | doi=10.1007/s11098-005-4060-0 | pages=137–167| citeseerx=10.1.1.330.3026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The problem==
Since [[Jaakko Hintikka]]'s seminal treatment of the problem,&lt;ref name="Hintikka"&gt;{{Cite book |first=Jaakko |last=Hintikka |year=1962 |title=Knowledge and Belief: An Introduction to the Logic of the Two Notions |location=Cornell, NY |publisher=Cornell University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; it has become standard to present Moore's paradox by explaining why it is absurd to assert sentences that have the logical form:
"P and NOT(I believe that P)" or "P and I believe that NOT-P."
Philosophers nowadays refer to these, respectively, as the omissive and commissive versions of Moore's paradox.

Moore himself presented the problem in two ways.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=G. E. |last=Moore |year=1991 |chapter=Russell's Theory of Descriptions |editor-first=P. A. |editor-last=Schilpp |title=The Philosophy of Bertrand Russell |series=The Library of Living Philosophers |volume=5 |location=La Salle, IL |publisher=Open Court Publishing |pages=177–225 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first more fundamental way of setting the problem up starts from the following three premises:
# It can be true at a particular time both that P, and that I do not believe that P.
# I can assert or believe one of the two at a particular time.
# It is absurd to assert or believe both of them at the same time.

I can assert that it is raining at a particular time. I can assert that I don't believe that it is raining at a particular time. If I say both at the same time, I am saying or doing something absurd. But the content of what I say—the [[proposition]] the sentence expresses—is perfectly consistent: it may well be raining, and I may not believe it. So why cannot I assert that it is so?

Moore presents the problem in a second, distinct, way:
# It is not absurd to assert the past-tense counterpart, e.g. "It was raining, but I did not believe that it was raining."
# It is not absurd to assert the second- or third-person counterparts to Moore's sentences, e.g. "It is raining, but ''you'' do not believe that it is raining," or "Michael is dead, but ''they'' do not believe that he is."
# It is absurd to assert the present-tense "It is raining and I don't believe that it is raining."

I can assert that I ''was'' a certain way, e.g. believing it was raining when it wasn't, and that you, he, or they, ''are'' that way but not that I ''am'' that way.

Subsequent philosophers have further noted that there is also an apparent absurdity in asserting a first-person ''future-tense'' sentence such as "It will be raining, and I will believe that it is not raining."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Luc |last=Bovens |year=1995 |title='P and I Will Believe that not-P': Diachronic Constraints on Rational Belief |journal=[[Mind (journal)|Mind]] |volume=104 |issue=416 |pages=737–760 |doi=10.1093/mind/104.416.737 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when it does not specify an exact time for when the belief is mistaken, the proposition will tend to be true at some point in the future - its negation would imply that "Every time I believe it's not raining, it will not be raining", which is unlikely since human beliefs are often mistaken.

Many philosophers—though by no means all—also hold that Moore's paradox arises not only at the level of [[Speech act#Classifying illocutionary speech acts|assertion]] but also at the level of [[belief]]. One who believes an instance of a Moorean sentence is tantamount to one who is subject to or engaging in [[self-deception]], at least on one standard way of describing it.

==Proposed explanations==
Philosophical interest in Moore's paradox, since Moore and Wittgenstein, has undergone a resurgence, starting with, though not limited to, [[Jaakko Hintikka]],&lt;ref name="Hintikka" /&gt; continuing with [[Roy Sorensen]],&lt;ref name="Sorensen"/&gt; [[David M. Rosenthal (philosopher)|David Rosenthal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=David |last=Rosenthal |chapter=Moore's Paradox and Consciousness |series=Philosophical Perspectives |volume=9 |title=AI, Connectionism and Philosophical Psychology |year=1995 |location=Atascadero, CA |publisher=Ridgeview |isbn=978-0-924922-73-2 |pages=313–334 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sydney Shoemaker]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Sydney |last=Shoemaker |chapter=Moore's Paradox and Self-Knowledge |title=The First-Person Perspective and other essays |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-521-56871-5 |pages=74–96 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first publication, in 2007, of a collection of articles devoted to the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor1-first=Mitchell S. |editor1-last=Green |editor2-first=John N. |editor2-last=Williams |title=Moore's Paradox: New Essays on Belief, Rationality and the First-Person |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-19-928279-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been several proposed constraints on a satisfactory explanation in the literature, including (though not limited to):
*It should explain the absurdity of both the omissive and the commissive versions.
*It should explain the absurdity of both asserting and believing Moore's sentences.
*It should preserve, and reveal the roots of, the intuition that contradiction (or something contradiction-like) is at the root of the absurdity.

The first two conditions have generally been the most challenged, while the third appears to be the ''least'' controversial. Some philosophers have claimed that there is, in fact, no problem in believing the content of Moore's sentences (e.g. David Rosenthal).  Others (e.g. Sydney Shoemaker) hold that an explanation of the problem at the level of belief will automatically provide us with an explanation of the absurdity at the level of assertion via the linking principle that what can reasonably be asserted is determined by what can reasonably be believed. Some have also denied (e.g. Rosenthal) that a satisfactory explanation to the problem need be uniform in explaining both the omissive AND commissive versions. Most of the explanations offered of Moore's paradox are united in holding that [[contradiction]] is at the heart of the absurdity.

One type of explanation at the level of assertion exploits the view that assertion implies or expresses [[belief]] in some way so that if someone asserts that ''p'' they imply or express the belief that ''p''. Several versions of this view exploit elements of [[speech act]] theory, which can be distinguished according to the particular explanation given of the link between assertion and belief. Whatever version of this view is preferred, whether cast in terms of the Gricean intentions (see [[Paul Grice]]) or in terms of the structure of Searlean illocutionary acts&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=John |last=Searle |lastauthoramp=yes |first2=Daniel |last2=Vanderveken |title=Foundations of Illocutionary Logic |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1985 |isbn=978-0-521-26324-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[speech act]]), it does not obviously apply to explaining the absurdity of the commissive version of Moore's paradox. To take one version of this type of explanation, if someone asserts ''p'' and conjoins it with the assertion (or denial) that he does not believe that ''p'', then he has in that very act contradicted himself, for in effect what the speaker says is: I believe that ''p'' and I do not believe that ''p''. The absurdity of asserting '''p'' &amp; I do not believe that ''p''' is thus revealed as being of a more familiar kind. Depending on one's view of the nature of contradiction, one might thus interpret a speaker of the omissive Moorean sentence as asserting everything (that is, asserting ''too'' much) or asserting nothing (that is, not asserting ''enough'').

An alternative view is that the assertion "I believe that ''p''" often (though '''not''' always) functions as an alternative way of asserting "''p''", so that the semantic content of the assertion "I believe that ''p''" is just ''p'': it functions as a statement about the world and not about anyone's state of mind. Accordingly, what someone asserts when they assert "''p'' and I believe that not-''p''" is just "''p'' and not-''p''" Asserting the commissive version of Moore's sentences is again assimilated to the more familiar (putative) impropriety of asserting a [[contradiction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Kent |last=Linville |lastauthoramp=yes |first2=Merrill |last2=Ring |title=Moore's Paradox Revisited |journal=Synthese |volume=87 |issue=2 |pages=295–309 |doi=10.1007/BF00485405 |year=1991 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the level of belief, there are two main kinds of explanation. The first, much more popular one, agrees with those at the level of assertion that contradiction is at the heart of the absurdity. The contradiction is revealed in various ways, some using the resources of [[doxastic logic]] (e.g. Hintikka), others (e.g. Sorensen) principles of [[rational belief]] maintenance and formation, while still others appeal to our putative capacity for [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|self-knowledge]] and the [[first-person authority]] (e.g. Shoemaker) we have over our states of mind.

Another alternative view, due to [[Richard Moran (philosopher)|Richard Moran]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Richard |last=Moran |title=Authority &amp; Estrangement: An Essay on Self-knowledge |location=Princeton |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-691-08944-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; views the existence of Moore's paradox as symptomatic of creatures who are capable of self-knowledge, capable of thinking ''for'' themselves from a deliberative point of view, as well as ''about'' themselves from a theoretical point of view. On this view, anyone who asserted or believed one of Moore's sentences would be subject to a loss of self-knowledge—in particular, would be one who, with respect to a particular 'object', broadly construed, e.g. person, apple, the way of the world, would be in a situation which violates, what Moran calls, the Transparency Condition: if I want to know what I think about X, then I consider/think about nothing but X itself. Moran's view seems to be that what makes Moore's paradox so distinctive is not some contradictory-like phenomenon (or at least not in the sense that most commentators on the problem have construed it), whether it be located at the level of belief or that of assertion. Rather, that the very possibility of Moore's paradox is a consequence of our status as agents (albeit finite and resource-limited ones) who are capable of knowing (and changing) their own minds.

'''Omaio''' (Omaiyo) is an obscure "[[Dorobo peoples|Dorobo]]" language of Tanzania. The people were expelled from the Serengeti in the 1950s to make way for the park. As of 2014, two elders remembered the language, though it had not been spoken since they were children, and two others remembered some words and phrases. From the few hundred words and phrases that have been collected, the language is not obviously related to anything else, and is thus a potential [[language isolate]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2364">'''Ophelia complex''' is the term used by [[Gaston Bachelard]] to refer to the links between femininity, liquids, and drowning which he saw as symbolised in the fate of Shakespeare's [[Ophelia]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Thompson ed., ''Hamlet'' (Arden 2016) p. 26-7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main theme==
Bachelard traced in [[Romanticism]] a nexus of ideas linking the dissolution of the self&lt;ref&gt;G. Wisker, ''Rites of Passage in Postcolonial Women's Writing'' (2010) p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;  - male or female - with immersion in the feminine element of water, as symbolised by Ophelia's drowning.&lt;ref&gt;P. Brooker, ''A Practical Reader in Contemporary Literary Theory'' (2010) p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literary offshoots===
[[Federico García Lorca]] explored the image of water and a despairing sexuality, epitomised in the Ophelia complex, throughout his writings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://muse.jhu.edu/article/510609/pdf The Weeping Brook]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exteriorised adolescence==
A later, and unconnected use of the terms Ophelia complex/Ophelia syndrome was introduced by [[Mary Pipher]] in her ''[[Reviving Ophelia]]'' of 1994.  There she argued for a view of Shakespeare's character as lacking inner direction, and externally defined by men (father/ brother);&lt;ref&gt;D. Lester, ''Katie's Diary'' (2004) p. 93-5&lt;/ref&gt; and suggested that similar external pressures were currently faced by post-pubescent girls.&lt;ref&gt;K. Douglas, ''Life Narratives and Youth Culture'' (2007) p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; The danger of the Ophelia syndrome was that of abandoning a rooted childhood self, for an apparently more sophisticated but over-externalised [[True self and false self|facade self]].&lt;ref&gt;D. Lester, ''Katie's Diary'' (2004) p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Overprinting''' refers to the process of printing one colour on top of another in [[Reprography|reprographics]]. This is closely linked to the reprographic technique of [[Trap (printing)|'trapping']]. Another use of overprinting is to create a [[rich black]] (often regarded as a colour that is "blacker than black") by printing black over another dark colour.

It is also the term used in the production of envelopes customised to order by printing images (such as logos) and texts (such as slogans) on mass-produced machine-made envelopes; the alternative way of producing such envelopes is to print "on the flat" and then cut out the individual shapes and fold them to form the envelopes.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} However the latter method is generally only economically viable for large print runs offering [[returns to scale]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

Overprinting also refers to the printing of additional information onto self-adhesive labels and product packaging. "Best Before", "Use By" dates and batch codes are printed in situ onto product
packaging as the items are packed. Generally thermal printers, ink jet printers or laser printers are used.

The '''Phla–Pherá''' (''Xwla–Xwela'') languages form a possible group of [[Gbe languages]] spoken mainly in southeastern and southwestern [[Benin]]; some communities are found in southeastern [[Togo]] and southwestern [[Nigeria]]. The group, comprising about ten [[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]], was introduced by H.B. Capo in his 1988 [[Language families and languages|classification]] of Gbe languages as one of the five main branches of Gbe. Additional research carried out by [[SIL International]] in the nineties corroborated many of Capo's findings and led to adjustment of some of his more tentative groupings; in particular, Phla–Pherá was divided in an eastern and a western cluster. Phla–Pherá is one of the smaller Gbe branches in terms of number of speakers. It is also the most linguistically diverse branch of Gbe, due partly to the existence of several geographically separated communities, but mainly because of considerable influence by several non-Gbe languages in the past. Some of the Phla–Pherá peoples are thought to be the original inhabitants of the region having intermingled with Gbe immigrants.

The term ''Phla–Pherá'' is a conjunction of the names of two major dialects of this grouping. There exist many spelling variants of both names. Phla, pronounced {{IPA|[χʷlà]}}, has been previously spelt ''Pla'', ''Kpla'', ''Xwla'', ''Hwla'', and ''Fla'' {{ref|failure}}. Pherá, pronounced {{IPA|[χʷèlá]}} or {{IPA|[χʷèrá]}}, has been previously spelt ''Peda'', ''Fida'', ''Péda'', and ''Houéda''. For simplicity's sake, this article will use the unified standard orthography of Gbe set forth by Capo.

==Geography and demography==
[[Image:Gbe languages.png|thumb|right|350px|The [[Gbe languages|Gbe]] language area. Green spots are languages of the Phla–Pherá cluster according to Capo (1988).]]
Most Phla–Pherá languages are spoken in the Mono, Atlantique, and Oueme (Weme) provinces of [[Benin]]. Alada, a lect that is sometimes included in the Phla–Pherá group, is spoken in southwestern [[Nigeria]] just southeast of Benin's administrative capital [[Porto-Novo]]. One Phla–Pherá language, [[Xwla language|Xwla]] (pronounced {{IPA-ee|xʷla|}}), is spoken west of the Mono river, along the coast between Anexo (Togo) and Grand Popo (Benin); this language has been called Popo in the past {{ref|popo}}. [[Fon language|Fon]] in its various shapes, representing another branch of Gbe, is the dominant language in this area and communities of Phla–Pherá speakers are scattered across the Fon area.

The Phla–Pherá languages are among the least investigated of the Gbe languages. In some cases, barely more is known than the name of a dialect and the village where it is spoken. Because of this, it is difficult to determine the total number of speakers of Phla–Pherá languages. A tentative approximation, based on the scanty demographic data available in the [[Ethnologue]], is 400 000 speakers excluding Alada, or 600 000 to 700 000 including Alada.

==Capo's initial classification==
Much of the comparative research for Hounkpati B.C. Capo's influential classification of the Gbe languages was carried out in the seventies, and partial results trickled down in the late seventies and early eighties in the form of articles on specific [[phonology|phonological]] developments in various branches of Gbe. In his 1988 work ''Renaissance du Gbe'', the internal classification of Gbe was published in full for the first time (part of the introduction in his 1991 ''A Comparative Phonology of Gbe'' is an English translation of this). In this classification, Phla–Pherá is considered one of the five branches of Gbe, the others being [[Ewe language|Ewe]], [[Gen language|Gen]], [[Fon language|Fon]], and [[Aja language (Niger–Congo)|Ajá]]. According to Capo (1988:15), the Phla–Pherá group consists of the following lects:

*[[Alada language|Alada]] (Allada, Arda) – southwest Nigeria, southeast of [[Porto-Novo]].
*[[Tɔli language|Tɔli]] (Tori) – Atlantique and [[Weme Province]], west of the Alada area.
*[[Tofin language|Tɔfin]] (Toffi, Tofin) – Weme province, Benin, north of [[Nokoué Lake]].
*[[Pherá language|Phelá]] (Fida, Péda, Xwela, Phera) – east of [[Lake Ahémé]] in the Atlantique province of Benin.
*[[Phla language|Phla]] (Pla, Xwla, Hwla, Popo) – in the coastal borderland of Togo and Benin, between [[Anexo]] and [[Grand Popo]].
*[[Ayizo language|Ayizɔ]] (Ayizo, Ayize) – Atlantique province, Benin.
*[[Ayizo language|Kotafon]] (Kotafohn) – [[Mono Province]], Benin.
*[[Gbesi language|Gbési]] (Gbesi) – Mono province, north of Ahéme Lake, Benin.
*[[Saxwe language|Tsáphɛ]] (Sahwe, Saxwe) – northern Mono province, Benin.
*[[Saxwe language|Sɛ]] (Se) – west Mono province, Benin.&lt;!--Counted as Saxwe in Ethn.--&gt;
Ayizɔ, Gbesi (''gbesiin'') and Kotafɔn (''kógbè'') are the same basic language.

Capo grouped the Phla–Pherá lects mainly on the basis of a number of shared phonological and [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] features, including the development of proto-Gbe {{IPA|*tʰ}} and {{IPA|*dʱ}} into {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/z/}}, the retained distinction between {{IPA|*ɛ}} and {{IPA|*e}}, and the occurrence of various nominal prefixes.

Capo noted that ‘the name Phla–Pherá is not used by speakers of the various lects which it comprises’ and that ‘in fact, the Phla–Pherá section is less unified than the others’ {{ref|name}}. However, according to Capo, their speakers ‘recognise a closer link between the lects listed here than between any of those listed in other [branches]’. He marked the Alada variety as an exception, as some people 'consider Alada and the Fon language ''Gun'' to be one and the same language'.

==Subsequent research==
In the early nineties, the Summer Institute of Linguistics initiated a study to assess which Gbe communities could benefit from existing [[literacy]] efforts and whether additional development programs in some of the remaining communities would be needed. Linguistic research carried out in the course of this study was to shed more light on the relations between the various varieties of Gbe. Some of the results of this study were presented in Kluge (2000, 2005, 2006).

Based on a synchronic analysis of lexical and grammatical features elicited among 49 Gbe varieties, Kluge divided the Gbe languages into three major groupings: western, central, and eastern {{ref|kluge}}. The eastern grouping consists of three clusters: Fon (roughly equivalent to Capo's 'Fon' branch), western Phla–Phera, and eastern Phla–Phera (together roughly equivalent to Capo's Phla–Pherá languages). Among other things, this part of Kluge's analysis confirmed the uncertainty of the classification of the Alada dialect: some possible results point to inclusion in the Fon group, while others suggest membership of one of the Phla–Pherá clusters {{ref|kluge2}}.  Likewise, Kluge's results indicate uncertainty regarding the classification of Ayizo and Kotafon {{ref|kluge3}}.

A number of lects considered by Kluge were not included in Capo's research (cf. Capo 1991:14ff), namely Ajra, Daxe, Gbesi, Gbokpa, Movolo, Se, and Seto, all of which Kluge (2000:32, 2005:41ff,47, 2006:74ff,79) classified as Phla–Phera.

==Linguistic diversity==
Just like Capo readily admitted the considerable diversity of the Phla–Pherá branch, Kluge's analysis did not result in conclusive evidence regarding the exact make-up of the western and eastern Phla–Pherá branches – various modes of computation yielded different configurations of the respective dialects (cf. 2000:62&amp;ndash;3, 2005:45ff). The diversity in this subfamily is probably due in part to the fact that the various Phla–Pherá communities do not occupy one specific geographical area but are scattered along the coast of the [[Bight of Benin]].

However, a more substantial reason for the noted diversity is one of historical nature. In a 1979 work on the history of the Gbe peoples (called ''Adjatado'' back then), the [[Catholic]] [[missionary]] Roberto Pazzi pointed out that 'three dialects emerged from the half-breeding between immigrant groups and the indigenes from Tádó: they are Gɛ̀n, Sáhwè and Xweɖá.' {{ref|pazzi}}. The latter two dialects are part of Capo's Phla–Pherá branch, and Capo adds that Tsáphɛ and Phelá have Cábɛ ([[Yoruba language|Yoruboid]]) and [[Edo language|E̟do]] respectively as [[substratum|substrata]]. This contact and intermingling of non-Gbe peoples with Gbe peoples and the influence of this processes on language inevitably diffuses the picture presented by comparative linguistic research. Further research into the historical origins of the Phla and Pherá peoples has yet to take place {{ref|research}}.

Due to the uncertainty about the internal structure of the eastern Gbe major grouping, the [[Ethnologue]] has omitted Phla–Pherá altogether from its subclassification of Gbe languages. Some of the lects of Capo's and Kluge's Phla–Pherá are included in other branches (for example, [[Xwla language|Xwla]] is found under Aja) while others are not included in any subgroup of Gbe (e.g. Xwela).

# {{note|failure}} Failure to recognize ''Hwla'' as a spelling variant seems to have caused the listing of this Phla–Pherá language as 'unclassified' on the [[Ethnologue]], as was pointed out by Angela Kluge (2000:104); this was rectified in the 15th edition.

A '''pocket park''' (also known as a '''parkette''', '''mini-park''', '''vest-pocket park''' or '''vesty park''') is a small [[park]] accessible to the general public. Pocket parks are frequently created on a single vacant [[Lot (real estate)|building lot]] or on small, irregular pieces of land. They also may be created as a component of the [[Form-based code#Public Space Standards|public space requirement]] of large building projects.

Pocket parks can be urban, suburban or rural, and can be on public or private land. Although they are too small for physical activities, pocket parks provide greenery, a place to sit outdoors, and sometimes a children's [[playground]]. They may be created around a monument, historic marker or art project.

In highly urbanized areas, particularly [[downtown]]s where land is very expensive, pocket parks are the only option for creating new public spaces without large-scale redevelopment. In inner-city areas, pocket parks are often part of [[urban regeneration]] plans and provide areas where [[wildlife]] such as birds can establish a foothold. Unlike larger parks, pocket parks are sometimes designed to be fenced and locked when not in use.

Small parks can increase the value of nearby homes.  One study conducted in [[Greenville, South Carolina]], found that "attractively maintained small and medium parks have a positive influence on neighboring property values."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Economic Benefits of Trails|url=http://www.americantrails.org/resources/economics/Economic-Benefits-Trails-Open-Space-Walkable-Community.html|publisher=American Trails|accessdate=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexico===
In [[Mexico City]], there is a city program to create up to 150 pocket parks of 400m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or less on vacant lots or even on land that had been part of a large intersection, such as [[Jardín Edith Sánchez Ramírez]] and the [[Condesa pocket park]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seduvi.df.gob.mx/portal/index.php/parques-publicos-de-bolsillo "Parques Públicos de Bolsillo", Secretariat of Urban Development and Housing, Mexican Federal District, accessed 2014-10-07]&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In England, a 1984 project to involve the local community in the creation and running of small, local parks has fostered several pocket parks in [[Northamptonshire]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/Images/Opening%20Green%20Doors_tcm6-9082.pdf Pocket Park project Page 6&amp;7]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northamptonshire.gov.uk/en/councilservices/Leisure/pocket-parks/Pages/default.aspx Northamptonshire's Pocket Park Website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205101339/http://www.northamptonshire.gov.uk/en/councilservices/Leisure/pocket-parks/Pages/default.aspx |date=2012-02-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was later developed by the [[Countryside Commission]] into the [[Millennium Green]] and [[Doorstep Green]] projects.

Over the twentieth century many communities have immigrated to the [[United Kingdom]] (UK), amongst them [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]]s from [[India]] and [[Pakistan]]. Many have brought their literary talents with them. Some have taken to writing in [[English (language)|English]], whilst others have expressed their works into their original language. These writers have absorbed what they have seen in England and reflected this in their [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] novels and poetry. Amongst these writers are [[Amarjit Chandan]], [[Harjeet Atwal]], [[Veena Verma]] (writer of ''Mull Di Teeveen'') and Shivcharan Gill. Others include Sathi Ludhianvi, K.C. Mohan, S.S. Santokh and Yash. In addition to these imigres, new British-born writers are emerging. These include Dominic Rai, [[Rupinderpal Singh Dhillon]] and [[Daljit Nagra]].

==Prominent British Punjabi writers==

===Shivcharan Jaggi Kussa===

Shivcharan Jaggi Kussa was born in the village of KUSSA, within the district of MOGA city. He immigrated to Austria in 1986 where he served with the German and Austrian border Police.  Since 2006 he has been living in the east end of London and over the years has produced a plethora of Punjabi novels. He is the most prolific and successful Punjabi writer, Roop Dhillon being his protégé.  He writes realistic satirical novels about corruption in the Indian Police force and Punjabi society in general. 
He has won many awards, including 7 gold medals and a further 17 literary awards, including the Nanak Singh Novelist Award from Punjabi Satth Lambra.
His books regularly appear on online magazines, like Roop Dhillon and he has embraced this medium. He is currently working on THE LOST FOOTPRINTS novel.
He is writing since 2012 for Bollywood Punjabi and Hindi films.

===Amarjit Chandan===
[[File:Amarjit Chandan.jpg|thumb|Amarjit Chandan]]
Amarjit Chandan was born in [[Nairobi]] in November 1946. After graduating from Panjab University in India, he joined the [[Maoist]] [[Naxalite]] movement, and subsequently spent two years in solitary confinement. Later he worked for various Punjabi literary and political magazines, including the Bombay-based Economic and Political Weekly before migrating to England in 1980, where he lives with his radio-broadcaster wife and two sons.

He has published eight collections of poetry and two books of essays in Punjabi in the [[Gurmukhi script]] and two in the [[Persian script]] in [[Lahore]] and one in English translation titled ''Being Here''.

He has edited many anthologies of world poetry and fiction, including two collections of British Punjabi poetry and short stories. His work is included in many anthologies in Punjabi, Hindi and English published in India and abroad. His poetry has been published in Greek, Turkish, Hungarian and Romanian and Indian languages. He has participated in many poetry readings in England, [[Hungary]] and at [[Columbia University]]. He has translated work by, among others, [[Brecht]], [[Pablo Neruda|Neruda]], [[Ritsos]], [[Hikmet]] and Cardenal into Punjabi.

He worked as a creative writer with the Punjab Drama Repertory Co., Chandigarh in the late 1970s and adapted Brecht's play ''The Caucasian Chalk Circle'' and Tagore's ''Mukatdhara'' in Punjabi. He was awarded Young Writer Fellowship by the Lalit Kala [Fine Arts] Akademi, India in 1980.

He is currently working on a Punjabi translation of [[Cervantes]]' [[Don Quixote]]. His own works include ''Jarhan'', ''Beejak'', ''Chhanna'', and ''Guthali''. He is a regular contributor to apnaorg.com and Sanjh magazine. His profile and work is listed on [[Danka Culture Guide|Danka - Pakistan's Cultural Guide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://danka.pk/index.php?var_action=artist_show&amp;artist_id=75|title=Danka - Pakistan's Cultural Guide|first=Hans Woppmann,|last=touristicweb|website=danka.pk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He resides in London, U.K with his family.

===Chaudhry Afzal Haq===

'''[[Chaudhry Afzal Haq]]''' (died 8 January 1942) was a  Writer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pakcolumnist.com/chaudhry-afzal-haq-marhoom-aur-punjab-hakumat.html |title=Chaudhry Afzal Haq|website=pakcolumnist.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Humanitarian, Leader of [[Majlis-e-Ahrar-e-Islam]] and a senior political figure in the history of [[Indian subcontinent|Sub-Continent India]]. He Worked to help the poor and unrepresented in The Punjab. He was also a founder of Majlis-e-Ahrar-e-Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Politics of sharing power: the Punjab Unionist Party, 1923-1947 |last=Tanwar |first=Raghuvendra |page=80 |year=1999 |publisher=Manohar Publishers &amp; Distributors |isbn=978-81-7304-272-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He founded Ahrar with [[Syed Ata Ullah Shah Bukhari]]. He was elected for three times in Punjab Assembly. He was also a [[Member of the Legislative Assembly]] of India.  He was known as Mufakkir-e-Ahrar. He wrote many books such as Zindagi, Mehbub-e-Khuda, Deen-e-Islam, Azadi-e-Hind, Mera Afsanah, Jawahraat, Mashooqa-e-Punjab, Shaoor, Dehati rooman, Pakistan and untouchability, Taareekh-e-Ahrar, Dunya may dozakh, Islam and Socialism etc. He died on January 8, 1942, in Lahore.

===Rupinderpal Singh Dhillon===

[[Rupinderpal Singh Dhillon]] is from [[West London (sub-region)|West London]] and writes novels, short stories and poetry in a British form of Punjabi which he taught himself to write. He has also published poetry in English.

===Harjeet Atwal===

Harjeet Atwal is a very famous Punjabi writer mainly known as a novelist and story-teller. His books are part of the regular courses of Indian Universities. Among his novels these are main ones; ''One Way'', ''Ret'', ''Sawari'', ''Southall'', ''British Born Desi'', ''Das Saal Das Yug'', ''Early Birds'', ''Geet''. He has written seven short stories books, one poetry collection, one travelogue, one biography and many more articles for different news papers and magazines. He is editor of a literary magazine as well named ''Shabad''. He is an organizer of a literary institute named 'Adara Shabad'. His work is available many different Indian languages. He is a law graduate and has honed legal practice for few years before he migrated to UK in 1977. He lives in London since he moved to UK. He was born on 8 September 1952 and married with three children.

All three of these writers represent wildly different schools of thought. Atwal is a traditional Punjabi writer well known in East Punjab. Chandan experiments with the language and has a more international approach. Some do not understand his work, but he too is firmly established now in a traditional Punjabi upbringing. He is equally well known in West Punjab. Of the three, Dhillon represents a totally new breed. His style is very anglicised, reflecting his upbringing in the west. In some eyes this has meant his Punjabi is not "proper". However, it is true reflection of the way English-bred second-generation Punjabis use it. But it is not only his grammar that irks traditionalists. His writing can be heavy and surreal, and hard to comprehend by those used to stories about village life. He is urban and better known in the Greater Punjab (Europe and America) then in the east.

'''Quasi-quotation''' or '''Quine quotation''' is a linguistic device in [[formal languages]] that facilitates rigorous and terse formulation of general rules about linguistic expressions while properly observing the [[use–mention distinction]].  It was introduced by the [[philosopher]] and [[logician]] [[Willard van Orman Quine]] in his book ''Mathematical Logic'', originally published in 1940.  Put simply, quasi-quotation enables one to introduce symbols that ''stand for'' a linguistic expression in a given instance and are ''used as'' that linguistic expression in a different instance.

For example, one can use quasi-quotation to illustrate an instance of [[substitutional quantification]], like the following:

::"Snow is white" is true if and only if snow is white.
::Therefore, there is some sequence of symbols that makes the following sentence true when every instance of φ is replaced by that sequence of symbols:  "φ" is true if and only if φ.

Quasi-quotation is used to indicate (usually in more complex formulas) that the φ and "φ" in this sentence are ''related'' things, that one is the [[iteration]] of the other in a [[metalanguage]]. Quine introduced quasiquotes because he wished to avoid the use of variables, and work only with [[closed sentence]]s (expressions not containing any variables).  However, he still needed to be able to talk about sentences with arbitrary [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicates]] in them, and thus, the quasiquotes provided the mechanism to make such statements. Quine had hoped that, by avoiding variables and [[axiom schema|schemata]], he would minimize confusion for the readers, as well as staying closer to the language that mathematicians actually use.&lt;ref&gt;Preface to the 1981 Revised Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

Quasi-quotation is sometimes denoted using the symbols ⌜ and ⌝  (unicode U+231C, U+231D), or double square brackets, ⟦&amp;nbsp;⟧, ("Oxford brackets") instead of ordinary quotation marks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What are Denotational Semantics and what are they for?|url=https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Denotational_semantics#What_are_Denotational_Semantics_and_what_are_they_for.3F}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dowty, D., Wall, R. and Peters, S.: 1981, Introduction to Montague semantics, Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scott, D. and Strachey, C.: 1971, Toward a mathematical semantics for computer languages, Oxford
University Computing Laboratory, Programming Research Group.&lt;/ref&gt;

== How it works ==
Quasi-quotation is particularly useful for stating formation rules for [[formal languages]].  Suppose, for example, that one wants to define the [[well-formed formula]]s (wffs) of a new formal language, ''L'', with only a single logical operation, [[negation]], via the following [[recursive definition]]:

# Any lowercase [[Roman letter]] (with or without subscripts) is a wff of ''L''.
# If φ is a wff of ''L'', then '~φ' is a wff of ''L''.
# Nothing else is a wff of ''L''.

Interpreted literally, rule 2 does not express what is apparently intended.  For '~φ' (that is, the result of [[concatenation|concatenating]] '~' and 'φ', in that order, from left to right) is not a wff of ''L'', because no [[Greek letter]] can occur in wffs, according to the apparently intended meaning of the rules.  In other words, our second rule says "If some sequence of symbols φ (for example, the sequence of 2 symbols φ = '~~''p''') is a wff of ''L'', then the sequence of 2 symbols '~φ' is a wff of ''L''".  Rule 2 needs to be changed so that the second occurrence of 'φ' (in quotes) be not taken literally.

Quasi-quotation is introduced as shorthand to capture the fact that what the formula expresses isn't precisely quotation, but instead something about the concatenation of symbols.  Our replacement for rule 2 using quasi-quotation looks like this:

:2'.    If φ is a wff of ''L'', then ⌜~φ⌝ is a wff of ''L''.

The quasi-quotation marks '⌜' and '⌝' are interpreted as follows.  Where 'φ' denotes a wff of ''L'', '⌜~φ⌝' denotes the result of concatenating '~' and ''the wff denoted by'' 'φ' (in that order, from left to right).  Thus rule 2' (unlike rule 2) [[logical consequence|entails]], e.g., that if &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''p''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; is a wff of ''L'', then '~''p''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; is a wff of ''L''.

Similarly, we could not define a language with [[disjunction]] by adding this rule:

:2.5.     If φ and ψ are wffs of ''L'', then '(φ v ψ)' is a wff of ''L''.

But instead:

:2.5'.    If φ and ψ are wffs of ''L'', then ⌜(φ v ψ)⌝ is a wff of ''L''.

The quasi-quotation marks here are interpreted just the same.  Where 'φ' and 'ψ' denote wffs of ''L'', '⌜(φ v ψ)⌝' denotes the result of concatenating left parenthesis, the wff denoted by 'φ', space, 'v', space, the wff denoted by 'ψ', and right parenthesis (in that order, from left to right).  Just as before, rule 2.5' (unlike rule 2.5) entails, e.g., that if &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''p''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; and &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''q''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; are wffs of ''L'', then '(''p'' v ''q'')' is a wff of ''L''.

== A caution ==
It does not make sense to quantify into quasi-quoted contexts using [[Variable (programming)|variables]] that range over things other than [[String (computer science)|character strings]] (e.g. [[number]]s, [[people]], [[electrons]]).  Suppose, for example, that one wants to express the idea that &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''s''(0)' denotes the successor of 0, '''s''(1)' denotes the successor of 1, etc.  One might be tempted to say:

* If ''φ'' is a [[natural number]], then ⌜''s''(''φ'')⌝ denotes the successor of ''φ''.

Suppose, for example, ''φ'' = 7. What is ⌜''s''(''φ'')⌝ in this case? The following tentative interpretations would all be equally absurd:

# ⌜''s''(''φ'')⌝ = 's(7)',
# ⌜''s''(''φ'')⌝ = 's(111)' (in the binary system, '111' denotes the integer 7),
# ⌜''s''(''φ'')⌝ = 's(VII)',
# ⌜''s''(''φ'')⌝ = 's(seven)',
# ⌜''s''(''φ'')⌝ = 's(семь)' ('семь' means 'seven' in Russian),
# ⌜''s''(''φ'')⌝ = 's(the number of days in one week)'.

On the other hand, if ''φ'' = '7', then ⌜''s''(''φ'')⌝ = 's(7)', and if ''φ'' = 'seven', then ⌜''s''(''φ'')⌝ = 's(seven)'.

The expanded version of this statement reads as follows:

* If ''φ'' is a natural number, then the result of concatenating &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''s''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;, left parenthesis, ''φ'', and right parenthesis (in that order, from left to right) denotes the successor of ''φ''.

This is a [[category mistake]], because a [[number]] is not the sort of thing that can be concatenated (though a [[numeral system|numeral]] is).

The proper way to state the principle is:

* If ''φ'' is an [[Arabic numeral]] that ''denotes'' a natural number, then ⌜''s''(''φ'')⌝ denotes the successor of the number denoted by ''φ''.

It is tempting to characterize quasi-quotation as a device that allows quantification into quoted contexts, but this is incorrect: quantifying into quoted contexts is ''always'' illegitimate.  Rather, quasi-quotation is just a convenient shortcut for formulating ordinary quantified expressions—the kind that can be expressed in [[first-order logic]].

As long as these considerations are taken into account, it is perfectly harmless to "abuse" the corner quote notation and simply use it whenever something like quotation is necessary but ordinary quotation is clearly not appropriate.

'''Quebec English''' encompasses the [[English language|English dialects]] (both native and non-native) of the predominantly [[French language|French]]-speaking [[Canada|Canadian]] province of [[Quebec]].&lt;ref&gt;Ingrid Peritz, "Quebec English elevated to dialect," [[Montreal Gazette]], 20 August 1997&lt;/ref&gt; There are few distinctive phonological features and very few restricted [[lexicon|lexical]] features common among [[English-speaking Quebecers]].&lt;ref name=r1&gt;{{cite news|last=Scott|first=Marian|title=Our way with words|url=https://montrealgazette.com/life/Part+Hear+that+anglo/2557359/story.html|accessdate=15 March 2011|newspaper=The Gazette|date=February 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The English spoken in Quebec generally belongs to [[Standard Canadian English]], whose [[sprachraum|speech region]] comprises one of the largest and most relatively homogeneous dialect areas in North America, arguably even classifiable under [[General American]]. This standard native-English accent is common in [[Montreal]], where the vast majority of [[anglophone|native English speaker]]s in Quebec live. [[English-speaking Quebecer#Montreal|English-speaking Montrealers]] have, however, established ethnic groups that retain certain lexical features: Irish, Jewish, Italian, and Greek communities that all speak discernible varieties of English.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt; Isolated fishing villages on the [[Basse-Côte-Nord]] of Quebec speak [[Newfoundland English]], and many [[Gaspé Peninsula|Gaspesian]] English-speakers use [[Maritimer English|Maritime English]]. Francophone speakers of Quebec (including Montreal) also have their own [[second language|second-language]] English that incorporates French accent features, vocabulary, etc. Finally, the [[Kahnawake]] Mohawks of south shore Montreal and the Cree and Inuit of Northern Quebec speak English with their own distinctive accents, usage, and expressions from their indigenous languages.

==Quebec Anglophone English==
The following are native-English (anglophone) phenomena unique to Quebec, particularly studied in Montreal English and spoken by the minority of Quebec Anglophone speakers in the Montreal area. Anglophone English was originally the dominant dialect of Quebec and the Montreal area. However, by the 1970s the Quebec Government imposed new legislation to protect and enforce French as the main language of the people of Quebec. This legislation also change English from its official language status in Quebec to a minority status. This legislation stopped English from being the language taught at school or spoken at work and the main purpose of this legislation was to keep French an active language in Quebec.:&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezproxy2.library.arizona.edu"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1111/j.1467-971X.2012.01776.x|title = English as a minority language in Quebec|journal = World Englishes|volume = 31|issue = 4|pages = 493–502|year = 2012|last1 = Boberg|first1 = Charles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phonology===
Anglophone Montreal speaks [[Standard Canadian English]], which has the [[Canadian Shift|Canadian Vowel Shift]] and [[Canadian raising]],{{sfnp|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|pp=219-220, 223}} with some additional features:
*Resistance to the [[mary–marry–merry merger|merry–marry]] merger: unlike the rest of typical North American English, Montreal English tends to maintain the distinction in words like ''Mary/merry'' versus ''marry'', ''perish'' versus ''parish'', and ''Erin'' versus ''Aaron''. The vowels remain, as in traditional East-Coast American English and often British English, {{IPAc-en|ɛ}} and {{IPAc-en|æ}}, respectively.{{sfnp|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=56}}
*The {{sc2|PRICE}} vowel is relatively backed.{{sfnp|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=97}}
*The "short ''a''" or {{sc2|TRAP}} vowel is not raised before {{IPA|/g/}} as elsewhere in Canada, but it is raised somewhat before {{IPA|/n/}} for ethnic British and Irish Montrealers. Among other ethnicities, such as Jewish Montrealers, there may be no raising of the vowel in any context.{{sfnp|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|pp=181-182, 223}}
*The following vowel sounds are linguistically-[[conservative (linguistics)|conservative]]: the sets of vowels represented by the words {{sc2|GOAT}} ([[back vowel|back]] and [[monophthong]]al), {{sc2|FACE}} (monophthongal), and {{sc2|MOUTH}} (back).{{sfnp|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=223}}
*The way that Anglo Montreal speakers pronounce the last letter of the alphabet "Z", Anglophone Montreal Speakers pronounce with an extended e vowel to sound like /Zee/. This differs from their Quebec Francophone Speakers who pronounce the last letter of the alphabet "Z" as /Zede/.&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezproxy2.library.arizona.edu"/&gt;

===Vocabulary===
Quebec English is heavily influenced by English and French the phrases / words below shows the variation of meaning among the Quebec English dialect.

Delay: an amount of time given before a deadline. " I was given a delay of 2 weeks before my project was due"&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezproxy2.library.arizona.edu"/&gt;

An Animator: is not an artist but is someone who meets and entertains children.&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezproxy2.library.arizona.edu"/&gt;

In most of Canada, a sweet carbonated beverage is commonly referred to as a "pop," but in Montreal, it is a "soda" or "soft drink."{{sfnp|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=290}} The phrase "in hospital" is often replaced by "in the hospital."{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}{{clarify|date=December 2017}}

A Formation - this word in English would normally mean a routine stance used in a professional formation. (I.E. The men stood in formation ) in Quebec a Formation is reference to an education.&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezproxy2.library.arizona.edu"/&gt;

A Pass - this phrase originates from Italian speakers, the phrase " Pass" is often used in phrase such  as I am going to pass by a friend on the way to the movies. The phrase is comparatively used when already your already completing one action but can squeeze in another action on the way to your destination.&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezproxy2.library.arizona.edu"/&gt;

In standard English this phrase "Your Bus will pass in 2 minutes " would mean that your are about to miss your bus or that you have already missed your bus. Alternatively in Montreal the Phrase " Pass " can also mean to arrive or stop as a way to show that the action will happen in a relatively short time frame. Example : " Your bus will pass in 2 minutes"&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezproxy2.library.arizona.edu"/&gt;

Another Phrase is the word "Corner peel" this phrase is used in conjunction with media outlets and advertising agency in the Montreal area. In English when giving directions to a store you would normally say this store is at the corner of 1st ave and 2nd ave. However, in Montreal the phrase is changed to this store is located at the corner peel of 1st ave and 2nd ave.&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezproxy2.library.arizona.edu"/&gt;

===French-language toponyms===
English-speakers commonly use French-language toponyms and official names for local institutions and organizations with no official English names. The names are pronounced as in French, especially in broadcast media. Examples include the [[Régie du logement]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Régie du logement – Welcome|url = http://www.rdl.gouv.qc.ca/en/1_0/index.asp|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20061211152529/http://www.rdl.gouv.qc.ca/en/1_0/index.asp|archivedate = 11 December 2006|accessdate = 25 June 2009|date = 24 November 2006|publisher = Gouvernement du Québec}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Collège de Maisonneuve]], [[Québec Solidaire]], the [[Parti québécois]], [[Hochelaga-Maisonneuve]], and [[Trois-Rivières]].

''Pie-IX'' (as in the boulevard, [[Pie IX Bridge|bridge]] and [[Pie-IX (Montreal Metro)|subway station]]) is pronounced {{IPA|/pinœf/}} or {{IPA|[ˈpiːˈnɐf]}}. On the other hand, a final written consonant may be included or added in pronunciation if a historic English-language name and pronunciation exists among Anglophone or English-dominant Allophone communities that are associated with particularly neighbourhoods. Examples are "Bernar''d'' Street," which in French is known as ''rue Bernard''. ''[[Montreal]]'' is always pronounced [ˌmɐntʃɹiˈɒl], following its historic official English-language name, but ''[[Quebec]]'' is pronounced {{IPA|[kwɪˈbɛk]}} or sometimes {{IPA|[kəˈbɛk]}}. English-speakers generally pronounce the French ''Saint-'' (m.) and ''Sainte-'' (f.) in street and place names as the English word "saint"; however, [[Saint-Laurent, Quebec|Saint-Laurent]] (the former city, now a borough of Montreal) can be pronounced as in Quebec French {{IPA|[sẽɪ̯̃lɔʁã]}}, but [[Saint Lawrence Boulevard]] can be said as ''Saint-Laurent'' {{IPA|[sẽlɔʁã]}} (silent ''t'') or as the original English name, ''Saint Lawrence''. [[Sainte-Foy, Quebec|Sainte-Foy]] is pronounced {{IPA|[seɪntˈfwɑː]}}. ''Saint-Denis'' is often pronounced {{IPA|[ˌseɪnt dəˈniː]}}, {{IPA|[ˌsẽɪ̯̃ dəˈni]}} or {{IPA|[seɪnt ˈdɛnəs]}}. [[Verdun, Quebec|Verdun]], as a place name, has the expected English-language pronunciation, {{IPA|/vəɹˈdʌn/}}, but English-speakers from Verdun traditionally pronounce the eponymous street name as {{IPA|/ˈvɜɹdən/}}. [[Saint-Léonard (borough)|Saint-Léonard]], a borough of Montreal, is pronounced "Saint-Lee-o-nard" {{IPA|/seɪnt ˌlioʊˈnɑɹd/}}, which is neither English nor French. Some French-language place names are very difficult for English speakers to say without adopting a French accent, such as [[Vaudreuil-Dorion|Vaudreuil]], [[Belœil, Quebec|Belœil]], and [[Longueuil]] in which pronunciation of the segment {{IPA|/œj/}} (spelled "euil" or "œil") is a challenge and so most often pronounced as {{IPA|/voʊˈdrɔɪ/}}, {{IPA|/bɛˈlɔɪ/}} and {{IPA|/lɔŋˈɡeɪ/}} or less often {{IPA|/lɔŋˈɡeɪl/}}. Used by both Quebec-born and outside English-speakers, acronyms with the letters pronounced in English, not French, rather than the full name for Quebec institutions and some areas on Montreal Island are common, particularly if the English-language names are or were official. For instance, ''SQ'' → [[Sûreté du Québec]] (pre-[[Bill 101]]: ''QPP'' → ''Quebec Provincial Police'', as it once was); ''NDG'' → [[Notre-Dame-de-Grâce]]; ''DDO'' → [[Dollard-des-Ormeaux]]; ''TMR'' → [[Mount Royal, Quebec|Town of Mount Royal]], the bilingual town's official English name.

*English toponyms in place of French (nonstandard whenwhen written): Older generations of English-speaking Montrealers are more likely to informally use traditional English toponyms that vary from official, French-language toponyms. In a notable generational distinction, it is uncommon among younger English-speaking Quebecers.&lt;ref name="One of Montreal's linguistic divides is generational"&gt;{{cite web|last=Scott|first=Marian|title=One of Montreal’s linguistic divides is generational|url=https://montrealgazette.com/life/Montreal+linguistic+divides+generational/6941731/story.html|publisher=Montreal Gazette|accessdate=July 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include ''Pine Avenue'', ''Park Avenue'', ''Mountain Street'', ''Dorchester Blvd.'', ''St. James Street'' – often used without St., Blvd., Ave., Rd., etc. (names for the designations "avenue des Pins", "av. du Parc", "rue de la Montagne", "boulevard René-Lévesque", "rue S&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;-Jacques"; the English-language official designations have reputedly been revoked, but evidence for that is difficult to find);{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} ''Guy'' and ''Saint Catherine'' Streets; ''[[Mount Royal, Quebec|Town of Mount Royal]]'', as it was chartered, and the charter has not been revoked; and ''Pointe Claire'' (English pronunciation {{IPA|[ˈpɔɪnt ˈklɛɹ]}} and typography, instead of official "[[Pointe-Claire]]" with French accent).

===French loanwords===
The use of a limited number of Quebec French terms for everyday place nouns (and occasional items) that have English equivalents; all of them are pronounced with English pronunciations or have undergone English clippings or abbreviations and so are regarded as ordinary English terms by Quebecers. Some of them tend sometimes to be preceded by ''the'' in contexts for which they could normally take ''a/an''.

===Pronunciation of French names===
The pronunciation of French-language first and last names uses mostly-French sounds may be mispronounced by speakers of other languages. For example, the pronounced "r" sound and the silent "d" of "Bouchar''d''" may be both pronounced: {{IPA|/buːˈʃɑrd/}}. French-speakers and Quebec English-speakers are more likely to vary such pronunciations, depending on the manner in which they adopt an English [[phonological]] framework. That includes names like ''[[Mario Lemieux]]'', ''[[Marie-Claire Blais]]'', ''[[Jean Charest]]'', ''[[Jean Chrétien]]'', ''[[Robert Charlebois]]'', and ''[[Céline Dion]]''.

==Quebec Francophone English==
Francophone second-language speakers of English use an interlanguage with varying degrees, ranging from French-accented pronunciation to Quebec Anglophone English pronunciation. High-frequency second-language phenomena by francophones, allophones, and other non-native-speakers occur in the most basic structures of English, both in and outside of Quebec. Commonly called "Frenglish" or "[[franglais]]", such phenomena are a product of [[interlanguage]], [[calques]], or mistranslation and thus may not constitute so-called "Quebec English" to the extent that they can be conceived of separately, particularly since such phenomena are similar for Francophone-speakers of English throughout the world, which leaves little to be specific to Quebec.

===Phonology===
Francophones speaking English often pronounce {{IPA|[t]}}/{{IPA|[d]}} instead of {{IPA|[θ]}}/{{IPA|[ð]}}, and some also pronounce {{IPA|[ɔ]}} for the phoneme {{IPA|/ʌ/}}, and some mispronounce some words, some pronounce a full vowel instead of a schwi, such as {{IPA|[ˈmɛseɪdʒ]}} for ''message''. Since French-speakers greatly outnumber English-speakers in most regions of Quebec, it is more common to hear French in public. Some Anglophones in overwhelmingly-Francophone areas use some of the features (especially the replacement of {{IPA|[θ]}} and {{IPA|[ð]}} by [t] and [d]), but their English is remarkably similar to that of other varieties of English in Canada ([[Shana Poplack|Poplack]], Walker, &amp; Malcolmson 2006 &lt;ref&gt;Shana Poplack, James Walker &amp; Rebecca Malcolmson (2006) An English "like no other"?: Language contact and change in Quebec.'' Canadian Journal of Linguistics.'' 185–213.&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Other speakers==
There is also a pronunciation (''NP'') of the [[phoneme]] {{IPA|/ŋ/}} as /n/ + /ɡ/ (among some [[Italian Canadians|Italian]] Montrealers) or /n/ + /k/ (among some [[Jewish]] Montrealers, especially those who grew up speaking [[Yiddish]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Scott|first=Marian|title=That 'aboat' sums it up|url=https://montrealgazette.com/life/Part+That+aboat+sums/2564512/story.html|accessdate=15 March 2011|newspaper=The Gazette|date=February 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as by high degrees of ethnic connectivity within, for instance, municipalities, boroughs, or neighbourhoods on [[Montreal Island]], such as [[St. Leonard, Quebec|Saint-Léonard]] and [[Outremont, Quebec|Outremont]]/[[Côte-des-Neiges]]/[[Côte Saint-Luc]]. Such phenomena occur as well in other [[diaspora]] areas such as [[New York City]].

===Vocabulary and grammar===

*The use of French [[collocation]]s (''NS''):

:''Close'' the TV'' – Turn/shut off the TV.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;
:''Close'' the door.'' – Lock the door.
:''Open'' the light.'' – Turn on the lights.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;
:''Close'' the light.'' – Turn off the lights.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;
:''Take'' a decision.'' – Make a decision. (NB "Take" is the older British version. Compare French ''Prends/Prenez une décision'')
:''Put'' your coat.'' – Put your coat on (from French ''Mets ton manteau/Mettez votre manteau'').
:''Pass'' someone money.'' – Lend someone money.
:''Pass'' the vacuum.'' – Run the vacuum (or do the vacuuming)

*The use of French grammar (''NS''): Many of these constructions are grammatically correct but only out of context. It is both the calquing and [[Language transfer|linguistic transfer]] from French and the betrayed meanings that make these sentences foreign to English.

:He ''speak/talk'' to me yesterday. – He spoke/talked to me yesterday. ([[verb tense]])
:''Me, I'' work in Laval.'' – I work in Laval. (vocal stress on "I". From French ''Moi, je travaille à Laval''.)
:''It/He have'' many books.'' – There are many books. (from French ''il y a'' meaning "there is/are")
:I like ''the'' beef and ''the'' red wine. – I like beef and red wine. (overuse of [[definite article]] to mean "in general". From French ''J'aime le bœuf et le vin rouge''.)
:''You speak French?'' – Do you speak French? (absence of [[auxiliary verb]]; otherwise it means surprise, disbelief or disappointment when out of context)
:''We were/are four.'' – There were/are four of us. (from French "nous sommes" and "nous étions")
:''We're Tuesday'' – It's Tuesday. (from French "nous sommes")
:I ''don't'' find my keys. – I can’t find my keys. (lack of [[English modal auxiliary verb]])
:At this moment I ''wash'' the dishes. – I’m washing the dishes right now. (verbal [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]])
:I can't join you at this moment because ''I eat''. – I can't join you right now because I'm eating. (verbal [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]])
:My computer, ''he don’t'' work. – My computer won’t work. (human pronoun, subject repetition, [[Inflexion|uninflected]] auxiliary verb)
:I would like a ''brownies''. – Could I have a brownie? (plural –s thought to be part of the singular word in [[relexification]] process; other examples: "a Q-tips", "a pins", "a buns", "a Smarties", "a Doritos", etc.)
:I would like ''shrimps'' with ''broccolis''. – Could I have some shrimp and broccoli? (use of regular plural instead of English unmarked [[English plural|plural]] or [[mass noun|non-count noun]]; this is not a case of [[hypercorrection]] but of [[language transfer]]).
:''Do'' you ''want'' to wash the dishes? – Will/would you wash the dishes? (lack of English [[modal verb]]; modal ''vouloir'' from French instead – ''Voulez-vous faire la vaisselle?'')
:We have to ''go in by'' downstairs – We have to go in downstairs (via the non-standard French 'entrer par')
:You're going to ''broke'' it! – You're going to break it! (mixing of homonymic French tenses; "cassé", past, versus "casser", infinitive)

*[[False cognate]]s or ''faux-amis'' (''NS''): This practice is quite common, so much so that those who use them abundantly insist that the false cognate is the English term even outside of Quebec. Note that these French words are all pronounced using English sounds and harbour French meanings. While the possibilities are truly endless, this list provides only the most insidious false cognates found in Quebec.

:''a stage'' – an internship (pronounced as in French, from the French word for internship, "un stage".)
:''Cégep'' {{IPA|[seɪ̯ˈʒɛp]}} (''cégep''; ''collégial'', ''cégepien'') – the acronym of the public college network preceding university in Quebec.
:''Chinese pâté'' {{IPA|[t͡ʃʰaɪ̯ˈniːz pʰætʰˌeɪ̯]}} or {{IPA|[t͡ʃʰaɪ̯ˈniːz pʰɑːˌtʰeɪ̯]}} – [[shepherd's pie]] (''[[Chinese pie|pâté chinois]]''; Quebeckers' pâté chinois is similar to shepherd's-pie dishes associated with other cultures)
:''a cold plate'' – some cold-cuts (reversed [[gallicism]] – ''assiette de viandes froides'')
:''coordinates'' – for address, phone number, e-mail, etc.
:''(a) salad'' – (a head of) lettuce
:''a subvention'' – a (government) grant
:''a parking'' – a parking lot/space
:''a location'' – a rental
:''a good placement'' – a good location
:''That's it.'' – That is correct. (from ''C'est ça.'')
:''all-dressed pizza'' – a deluxe pizza with pepperoni, mushrooms and green peppers (from ''pizza toute garnie.'')
:''soup, two times'' – two soups, or two orders of soup (from "deux fois.")

Few anglophone Quebeckers use many such false cognates, but most understand such high-frequency words and expressions. Some of these cognates are used by many francophones, and others by many allophones and anglophone accultured in allophone environments, of varying English proficiencies, from the bare-minimum level to native-speaker level.

The first traces of women's hockey in Canada date back to the 1890s when it is played at the university level. The [[University of Toronto]] and Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario were two of the first Canadian universities to field women's hockey teams.

==History==
[[File:Queens Gaels women goalie 2014.jpg|left|185px|thumbnail|Golden Gaels goalie in 2014-15 season.]]
[[File:Queens Gaels women 2014.jpg|right|185px|thumbnail|Golden Gaels player in 2014-15 season.]]
Elizabeth Graham would play hockey for Queen's University and is credited as being the first goaltender ever to wear a mask for protection. She used the mask in 1927, and the use of the mask was in the Montreal Daily Star. She actually wore a fencing mask and the speculation is that she had used the mask as a means of protecting dental work that was recently performed.&lt;ref name="hhof.com.Notable"&gt;{{cite web|ref=harv |year=2010 |url=http://www.hhof.com/html/wmspla03.shtml |title=Notable women hockey players |work=[[National Hockey League]] |publisher=[[Hockey Hall of Fame|Hockey Hall of Fame and Museum]] |accessdate=April 18, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203052216/http://www.hhof.com/html/wmspla03.shtml |archivedate=December 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1960s, Cookie Cartwright and a group of dedicated students revived the women's ice hockey program at Queen's University. Cartwright and the Golden Gaels would go on to capture the first women's university championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/hockeyhistory/episodesummary/06/post/ | work=CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 32 long years, the Queen's women's hockey team captured their first OUA Championship in 2010-11. The team won all five of their playoff games in overtime, knocking off nationally ranked opponents Windsor in the Quarter-final, Wilfrid Laurier in the Semifinal and Guelph in the Final. Game 1 of the OUA Championship series was historic in its own right for the Gaels as the team won the longest collegiate hockey game in history, a six-overtime marathon. The game finally game to an end after 107 minutes and 14 seconds of overtime when Morgan McHaffie banged home a rebound past Guelph goaltender Danielle Skoufranis. Queen's goaltender Mel Dodd-Moher made 66 saves for the win.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gogaelsgo.com/news/2011/3/3/HOCKEYW_0303115525.aspx?path=whockey Queens University Athletics and Recreation - Queens edges Guelph 2-1 in longest collegiate game in history]&lt;/ref&gt;

The team moved on to their first CIS Championship following the OUA playoffs where the Gaels defeated the defending champion Alberta Pandas and the host Wilfrid Laurier Golden Hawks to win the bronze medal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.cis-sic.ca/championships/wice/2010-11/releases/20110313-bronze CIS English : BRONZE CIS championship: Gaels earn bronze with 1-0 win over Hawks]&lt;/ref&gt;

Morgan McHaffie was recognized as the 2012 OUA women's hockey Player of the Year. She led the OUA league scoring race with 38 points (on 16 goals and 22 assists). She ranked fourth overall in CIS scoring. She was the first Gael to earn Player of the Year honors since the 2003-04 campaign. She was also recognized as an OUA First-Team All-Star.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.cis-sic.ca/sports/wice/2011-12/releases/20120224-oua CIS English : 2011-12 OUA women's hockey major awards and all-stars announced]&lt;/ref&gt;
Freshman Taryn Pilon was named to the 2012 OUA All-Rookie team. She appeared in every Queen's contest, while recording 21 points and taking only one penalty. Defender Katie Duncan was making her first appearances on an all-star team as she was named to the 2012 OUA Second Team All-Stars. Duncan finished the 2011-12 campaign tied for fourth among OUA defenders with 15 points. In addition, Duncan led all blueliners with six goals on the season.

===Notable games===
*March 3, 2011: A postseason match between the Queen's Golden Gaels and the Guelph Gryphons became the longest collegiate hockey game, male or female, Canadian or American — on record.

'''Rakesh Jhaveri''', also known as '''Pujya Gurudevshri Rakeshbhai''',{{efn-ua|Pujya Gurudevshri and Bhai are honorifics. He is credited in his books by this name. He is also addressed as Bapaji or Sahebji by his followers.}} (born 26 September 1966) is a spiritual leader, mystic,  scholar of [[Jainism]], author and orator from India.

He founded Shrimad Rajchandra Mission, [[Dharampur, Gujarat|Dharampur]] to support his spiritual and social activities.

==Early life==
Rakeshbhai Jhaveri was born in [[Mumbai]], India on 26 September 1966 to Shri Dilip and Rekha Jhaveri, who followed the [[Śvētāmbara|Shwetambara]] [[Murtipujaka]] tradition of Jainism.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.religionworld.in/jain-saint-rakesh-bhai-the-true-successor-of-shrimad-rajchandraji/|title=Jain Saint Rakeshbhai Jhaveri: The True Successor of Shrimad Rajchandraji|author=Shweta|date=|website=Religion World|publisher=ReligionWorld.in|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=7 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, Sahaj Anandji, a monk from [[Rajasthan]] who had established Shrimad Rajchandra Ashram at [[Hampi]], was at [[Palitana]]. Rakeshbhai's parents were influenced by Sahaj Anandji who passed away in 1970 and was succeeded by Mataji.{{snf|Salter|2002|p=101-102}} 

In 1972, Rakeshbhai began his academic studies at Activity High School in Mumbai. From an early age, he was spiritually inclined. His mother and others have recounted miracles prior to and after his birth. From the age of four he began speaking about Jain philosophy. He first encountered Shrimad Rajchandraji when a copy of {{transl|gu|Shrimad Rajchandra Vachanamrut}} fell and he saw the photograph of [[Shrimad Rajchandra]]. He recounted that he went into deep meditation for 72 hours after this incident, which led to {{transl|sa|IAST|jāti smaraṇa gnān}} (recounting of previous lives).{{snf|Salter|2002|p=104}} 

In 1978, Rakeshbhai visited Hampi and stayed for eighteen months.{{snf|Salter|2002|p=103}} A ''[[satsang]]-mandal'' (devotional group) was formed by 1978 and some followers had already started to call him [[Guru]] by 1980.{{snf|Salter|2002|p=105}} During his visit to his aunt in [[Jaipur]], he decided to devote rest of his life to spiritual activities.{{snf|Salter|2002|p=105}} In 1983, he visited Hampi again and stayed there for two years. There he was nominated as Mataji's successor.{{snf|Salter|2002|p=103}} In 1985, he returned to Mumbai upon his parents' request and started studying religious texts, practicing [[yoga]] and learning [[Indian classical music]]. He observed silence for twelve hours a day and traveled extensively between 1985 and 1990.{{snf|Salter|2002|p=106-107}}&lt;ref name="TIO2013" /&gt; During this period, the number of followers around him continued to grow.{{snf|Salter|2002|p=106}} During his holidays in [[Nepal]], he decided to pursue the college studies.{{snf|Salter|2002|p=106-107}}

He completed [[Bachelor of Arts|B. A.]] from [[Osmania University]], [[Hyderabad]], in 1988.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; In 1989, he visited [[Antwerp]] for his father's treatment where his discourses were attended by increasing number of followers.{{snf|Salter|2002|p=107}} He completed [[Master of Arts|M. A.]] in Philosophy in 1991 from the [[University of Mumbai]].&lt;ref name="TIO2013" /&gt; He started his doctoral studies on ''[[Atmasiddhiji]]'', a spiritual work composed by Shrimad Rajchandraji, in January 1994 under Ramanlal Shah. He was awarded PhD on 2 December 1998 by the University of Mumbai.{{snf|Salter|2002|p=107-108}}&lt;ref name="TIO2013"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/MBAs-doctors-engineers-surrender-soul-to-service-and-prayers/articleshow/18313508.cms?referral=PM|title=MBAs, doctors, engineers surrender soul to service and prayers|last=Chhapia|first=Hemali|date=February 2013|newspaper=Times of India|access-date=2014-02-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160714095854/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/MBAs-doctors-engineers-surrender-soul-to-service-and-prayers/articleshow/18313508.cms?referral=PM|archive-date=2016-07-14|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He had vowed not to give a public discourse until his PhD was completed.

Rakesh Jhaveri established Shrimad Rajchandra Adhyatmik Satsang Sadhana Kendra in 1994 to organise his followers which was later succeeded by the Shrimad Rajchandra Mission Dharampur. On 13 May 1999, the construction of an [[ashram]] spread across 223 acres at Dharampur was started{{snf|Salter|2002|p=98}}&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and was opened in April 2001. The ashram is located on the hillock of Mohangadh which was an estate of the last ruler of the erstwhile [[Dharampur State]].{{snf|Salter|2002|p=99}} In 2002, he started initiating followers, {{transl|gu|Atmarpit}}s, who give up worldly possessions and commit to [[celibacy]].&lt;ref name="TIO2013" /&gt; He gives the series of discourses to his followers at the ashram throughout the year. He gives discourses in Mumbai once a month on {{transl|gu|Shrimad Rajchandra Vachanamrut}}, a compilation of Shrimad Rajchandra's letters, personal diaries and transcriptions of his spiritual discourses.{{snf|Salter|2002|p=98-100}}{{snf|Salter|2002|p=247}} He also prescribes an annual scriptural study schedule to his followers.{{snf|Salter|2002|p=251}}

'''Sucite''' is a [[Senufo languages|Senufo]] language spoken in southwestern [[Burkina Faso]] by approximately 35,000 people. Sucite is a close neighbour of [[Supyire language|Supyire]], spoken in southeastern [[Mali]]. Sucite is sometimes regarded as the northern extension of Supyire. The two dialects are, according to Garber (1987), ‘quite mutually intelligible’. Sometimes speakers of Sucite will even refer to themselves as speaking Supyire. Another closely related lect is [[Mamara language|Mamara]] (also known as Minyanka).

Some other Senufo groups refers to the Sùcìté people as Tagba, because they live on the Tagouara plateau. There are various ways to spell the dialect names. Variants of Sùcìté include Sìcìté, Sìpììté, and Sicire. The [[SIL International|SIL]] language code is SEP.

==Sounds==
===Vowels===
All vowels can be lengthened and [[nasalization|nasalized]]. The schwa /ə/ is included in brackets because it is found only in two specific environments, where it appears to be in [[allophone|complementary distribution]] with some other vowel.

Geminate voiced stops/affricates are cognate to prenasalized voiceless stops in [[Supyire language|Supyire]],&lt;ref&gt;Garber 1987, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; and are indicated orthographically as {{angbr|mp, nt, ...}} in Garber (1987).

===Tone===
Sucite is a [[tonal language]] with three surface tone levels: High, Mid, and Low. Garber (1987) and Carlson (1994) analyse the Northern Senufo system as having two different Mid tones, a strong mid (Ms) and a weak mid (Mw). The Ms tone undergoes substantially less tonal alternations than the Mw tone. Garber (1988) suggests that this peculiarity may have its origin in a [[tone (linguistics)#tonal split|tonal split]].

Glides formed by combining pairs of tones exist, the most common being HL and ML.

==Grammar==
===Nouns===
Like the other Senufo languages, Sucite employs a [[noun class]] system of five genders: three pairings of singular/plural classes and two mass/collective classes.

Nouns take class-specific suffixes for definiteness. For example:
{| class="wikitable"
! Gloss
! Indef.
! Def.
! Gender
! Class
|-
! 'river'
| gba
| gba-ŋé
| rowspan="2" align="center" | ''wi''
| 1
|-
! 'rivers'
| gba-ála
| gba-á-bí 
| 2
|-
! 'house'
| gba-xa
| gba-ké
| rowspan="2" align="center" | ''ki''
| 3
|-
! 'houses'
| gba-ya
| gba-nyɛ́
| 4
|-
! 'forehead'
| gba-là
| gba-à-ne
| rowspan="2" align="center" | ''li''
| 5
|-
! 'foreheads'
| gbà-ʔala
| gbà-ʔà-ki
| 6
|}
&lt;ref&gt;Garber 1987, pp. 25-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pronouns===
Each noun class has its own set of pronouns. These may be general (clitic), emphatic, [[partitive]], interrogative, demonstrative, or relative.

{| class="wikitable"
|+ Pronouns&lt;ref&gt;Garber 1987, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tol''', also known as '''Eastern Jicaque''', ''Tolupan'', and ''Torupan'', is spoken by approximately 500 [[Tolupan people]] in [[La Montaña de la Flor]] reservation in [[Morazán Department]], [[Honduras]].{{fact|date=June 2015}}{{huh|reason=Morazán Department is actually in El Salvador|date=June 2015}} 

==Name==
Tol speakers refer to themselves as the Tolpán, but are called Jicaques or Turrupanes by [[Ladino people|ladinos]].

==Former extent==
Tol was also spoken in much of [[Yoro Department]], but only a few speakers were reported in the [[Yoro Valley]] in 1974. 

Tol used to be spoken from the [[Río Ulúa]] in the west, to modern-day [[Trujillo, Honduras|Trujillo]] in the east, and to the [[Río Sulaco]] in the inland south. This area included the areas around modern-day [[El Progreso]], [[La Ceiba]], and possibly also [[San Pedro Sula]]. Most Tolupan had fled the Spanish from coastal regions by the early 1800s. The Tol speakers at La Montaña de la Flor fled the Yoro Valley in 1865 to avoid being conscripted into forced labor by the local governor (Campbell &amp; Oltrogge 1980:206, Hagen 1943, Chapman 1978).

== Grammar ==

=== Constituent order ===

The basic constituent order of Tol is SOV and the language displays a consistently head final order of constituents, i.e. verbs follow the subject and the object, prepositions follow the nouns they refer to, and subordinating conjunctions appear at the end of subordinate clauses.

=== Inflection ===

Verbs and nouns are inflected for person, number and, in the case of verbs, tense, using a number of different morpho-syntactic means which often conflate various meanings (polyexponentiality). These means include, prefixing, suffixing and infixing, ablaut and stress shift and the use of independent pronouns. Tense is also expressed by the use of particles. Number is only marked in noun phrases with animate referents. Some examples are given below.

m-wayúm		'my husband'
w-y-ayúm	'your husband'
woyúm		'her husband'
khis wayúm	'our husband'
his wayúm	'your husband'
his wayúm	'their husband'

naph üsü  müʔüs	'I am drinking water'
hiph üsü müs		'you are drinking water'
huph üsü mü		'he is drinking water'
kuph üsü miskhékh	'we are drinking water'
nun üsü müskhé	'you are drinking water'
yuph üsü miʔün	'they are drinking water'


Most nouns take one of three suffixes:
-(sV)s 
-(V)N
-(V)kh

Examples are

wa/ wo-sís            'house'
sith / sith-ím        'avocado'
khan / khon-íkh   'bed'

Nouns that never take suffixes refer to body parts and kinship terms.

[[File:Ukrainian vowel chart.svg|thumb|upright=1.13|Ukrainian vowel chart, from {{Harvcoltxt|Pompino-Marschall|Steriopolo|Żygis|2016|p=?}}]]
Ukrainian has six vowel [[phoneme]]s: {{IPA|/{{IPA link|i}}, {{IPA link|u}}, {{IPA link|ɪ}}, {{IPA link|ɛ}}, {{IPA link|ɔ}}, {{IPA link|ɑ}}/}}.

{{IPA|/ɪ/}} may be classified as a retracted high-mid front vowel,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Rusanivs’kyj|Taranenko|Zjabljuk|2004|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; transcribed in narrow IPA as {{IPA|[e̠]}}, {{IPA|[ë]}}, {{IPA|[ɪ̞]}} or {{IPA|[ɘ̟]}}.

Ukrainian has no phonemic distinction between long and short vowels; however, unstressed vowels are somewhat reduced in time and, as a result, in quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Rusanivs’kyj|Taranenko|Zjabljuk|2004|p=407}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Unstressed {{IPA|/ɔ/}} has an allophone {{IPAblink|o}} that slightly approaches {{IPA|/u/}} if it is followed by a syllable with {{IPA|/u/}} or {{IPA|/i/}}.&lt;ref name="bmr3"/&gt;
* Unstressed {{IPA|/u/}} has an allophone {{IPAblink|ʊ}}.&lt;ref name="bmr3"/&gt;

In the table above, if there are two consonants in a row, the one to the right is voiced, and the one to the left is voiceless.

Phonetic details:
* There is no complete agreement about the phonetic nature of {{IPA|/ɦ/}}. According to some linguists, it is pharyngeal {{IPAblink|ʕ}}&lt;ref name="DanVak12"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Danyenko|Vakulenko|1995|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{IPAblink|ħ}} [or sometimes {{IPAblink|x}} in weak positions] when devoiced).&lt;ref name="DanVak12" /&gt; According to others, it is glottal {{IPAblink|ɦ}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Pugh|Press|2005|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The sound is described as "laryngeal fricative consonant" ({{lang|uk|гортанний
щілинний приголосний}}) in the official orthography: '§&amp;nbsp;14. Letter H' in Український правопис, Kyiv: Naukova dumka, 2012, p. 19 ([http://izbornyk.org.ua/pravopys/rozdil1.htm#par14 see e-text])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Українська мова: енциклопедія, Kyiv, 2000, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Word-finally, {{IPA|/m/}}, {{IPA|/l/}}, {{IPA|/r/}} are voiceless {{IPAblink|m̥}}, {{IPAblink|l̥}}, {{IPAblink|r̥}} after voiceless consonants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Danyenko|Vakulenko|1995|pp=6, 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In case of {{IPA|/r/}}, it only happens after {{IPA|/t/}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Danyenko|Vakulenko|1995|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{IPA|/w/}} is most commonly bilabial {{IPAblink|β̞}} before vowels but can alternate with labiodental {{IPAblink|ʋ}} (most commonly before {{IPA|/i/}}),&lt;ref name="w1"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Žovtobrjux|Kulyk|1965|pp=121–122}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can be a true labiovelar {{IPAblink|w}} before {{IPA|/ɔ/}} or {{IPA|/u/}}.&lt;ref name="bmr3"/&gt; It is also vocalized to {{IPA|[u̯]}} before a consonant at the beginning of a word, after a vowel before a consonant or after a vowel at the end of a word.&lt;ref name="w1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="w2"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Rusanivs’kyj|Taranenko|Zjabljuk|2004|pp=522–523}}&lt;/ref&gt; If {{IPA|/w/}} occurs before a voiceless consonant and not after a vowel, the voiceless articulation {{IPAblink|ʍ}} is also possible.&lt;ref name="bmr3"/&gt;
* {{IPA|/r/}} often becomes a single tap {{IPAblink|ɾ}} in the spoken language.
* {{IPA|/t, d, dʲ, n, nʲ, s, sʲ, z, zʲ, t͡s, t͡sʲ, d͡z, d͡zʲ/}} are dental {{IPA|[{{IPAlink|t̪}}, {{IPAlink|d̪}}, {{IPA|d̪ʲ}}, {{IPAlink|n̪}}, {{IPA|n̪ʲ}}, {{IPAlink|s̪}}, {{IPA|s̪ʲ}}, {{IPAlink|z̪}}, {{IPA|z̪ʲ}}, {{IPAlink|t̪͡s̪}}, {{IPA|t̪͡s̪ʲ}}, {{IPAlink|d̪͡z̪}}, {{IPA|d̪͡z̪ʲ}}]}},&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Danyenko|Vakulenko|1995|pp=8–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; while {{IPA|/tʲ, l, lʲ, r, rʲ/}} are alveolar {{IPA|[{{IPA|tʲ}}, {{IPAlink|l}}, {{IPA|lʲ}}, {{IPAlink|r}}, {{IPA|rʲ}}]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Danyenko|Vakulenko|1995|pp=8 and 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The group of palatalized consonants consists of 10 phonemes: {{IPA|/j, dʲ, zʲ, lʲ, nʲ, rʲ, sʲ, tʲ, t͡sʲ, d͡zʲ/}}. All except {{IPA|/j/}} have a soft and a hard variant. There is no agreement about the nature of the palatalization of {{IPA|/rʲ/}}; sometimes, it is considered as a semi-palatalized{{clarify|date=September 2017}} consonant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Ponomariv|2001|pp=16, 20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Labial consonants {{IPA|/p, b, m, f/}} have just semi-palatalized versions, and {{IPA|/w/}} has only the hard variant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Ponomariv|2001|pp=14-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The palatalization of the consonants {{IPA|/ɦ, ɡ, ʒ, k, x, t͡ʃ, ʃ, d͡ʒ/}} is weak; they are usually treated rather as the allophones of the respective hard consonants, not as separate phonemes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Buk|Mačutek|Rovenchak|2008|=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Unlike Russian and several other Slavic languages, Ukrainian does not have [[final-obstruent devoicing|final devoicing]] for most [[obstruent consonant|obstruent]]s, as can be seen, for example, in {{wikt-lang|uk|віз}} "cart", which is pronounced {{audio-IPA|Uk-віз.ogg|[ˈʋiz]}}, not {{IPA|*[ˈʋis]}}.&lt;ref name="bmr3"/&gt;
* The fricative articulations {{IPA|[{{IPAlink|v}}, {{IPAlink|ɣ}}]}} are voiced allophones of {{IPA|/f, x/}} respectively if they are voiced before other voiced consonants. (See [[#Consonant assimilation]].) {{IPA|/x, ɦ/}} do not form a perfect voiceless-voiced phoneme pair, but their allophones may overlap if {{IPA|/ɦ/}} is devoiced to {{IPA|[x]}} (rather than {{IPA|[h]}}).  In the standard language, {{IPA|/f, w/}} do not form a voiceless-voiced phoneme pair at all, as {{IPA|[v]}} does not phonemically overlap with {{IPA|/w/}}, and {{IPA|[ʍ]}} (voiceless allophone of {{IPA|/w/}}) does not phonemically overlap with {{IPA|/f/}}.&lt;ref name="bmr3"/&gt;

When two or more consonants occur word-finally, a vowel is [[Epenthesis|epenthesized]] under the following conditions:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Carlton|1972|p=?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given a consonantal grouping C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;({{lang|uk|ь}})C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;({{lang|uk|ь}}), C being any consonant. The vowel is inserted between the two consonants and after the {{lang|uk|ь}}. A vowel is not inserted unless C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is either {{IPA|/k/}}, {{IPA|/w/}}, {{IPA|/l/}}, {{IPA|/m/}}, {{IPA|/r/}}, or {{IPA|/ts/}}. Then:

# If C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is {{IPA|/w/}}, {{IPA|/ɦ/}}, {{IPA|/k/}}, or {{IPA|/x/}}, the epenthisized vowel is always {{IPA|[o]}}
## No vowel is epenthesized if the {{IPA|/w/}} is derived from a Common Slavic vocalic *l, for example, {{IPA|/wɔwk/}} (see below)
# If C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is {{IPA|/l/}}, {{IPA|/m/}}, {{IPA|/r/}}, or {{IPA|/ts/}}, then the vowel is {{IPA|/ɛ/}}.
# The combinations, {{IPA|/-stw/}} {{IPA|/-sk/}}  are not broken up.
# If the C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is {{IPA|/j/}} ({{lang|uk|й}}), the above rules may apply. However, both forms (with and without the fill vowel) often exist.

===Alternation of vowels and semivowels===
Ukrainian also has a non-syllabic {{IPA|[u̯]}}, as an allophone of {{IPA|/w/}}. The semivowels {{IPA|/j/}} and {{IPA|/w/}} alternate with the vowels {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} respectively. The semivowels are used in syllable codas: after a vowel and before a consonant, either within a word or between words:{{citation needed|date=November 2009}}

: {{lang|uk|він '''і'''де́}} {{IPA|/ˈwin '''i'''ˈdɛ/}} ('he's coming')
: {{lang|uk|вона́ '''й'''де}} {{IPA|/wɔˈnɑ ˈ'''j'''dɛ/}} ('she's coming')
: {{lang|uk|він '''і''' вона́}} {{IPA|/ˈwin '''i''' wɔˈnɑ/}} ('he and she')
: {{lang|uk|вона́ '''й''' він}} {{IPA|/wɔˈnɑ '''j''' ˈwin/}} ('she and he');

: {{lang|uk|'''У'''томи́вся '''в'''же}} {{IPA|/'''u'''tɔˈmɪwsʲɑ ˈ'''w'''ʒɛ/}} ('already gotten tired')
: {{lang|uk|'''У'''же́ '''в'''томи́вся}} {{IPA|/'''u'''ˈʒɛ '''w'''tɔˈmɪwsʲɑ/}} ('already gotten tired')
: {{lang|uk|Він '''у'''томи́вся.}} {{IPA|/ˈwin '''u'''tɔmɪwsʲɑ/}} ('He's gotten tired.')
: {{lang|uk|Він '''у''' ха́ті.}} {{IPA|/ˈwin '''u''' ˈxɑtʲi/}} ('He's inside the house.')
: {{lang|uk|Вона́ '''в''' ха́ті.}} {{IPA|/wɔˈnɑ '''w''' ˈxɑtʲi/}} ('She's inside the house.')
: {{lang|uk|під'''у'''чи́ти}} {{IPA|/pid'''u'''ˈt͡ʃɪtɪ/}} ('to learn/teach (a little more)')
: {{lang|uk|ви'''в'''чи́ти}} {{IPA|/wɪ'''w'''ˈt͡ʃɪtɪ/}} ('to have learnt')

That feature distinguishes Ukrainian phonology remarkably from Russian and Polish, two related languages with many cognates.

=== Consonant assimilation ===
Voiceless obstruents are voiced when preceding voiced ones, but the reverse is not true:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Mascaró|Wetzels|2001|p=209}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{wikt-lang|uk|наш}} {{IPA|[nɑʃ]}} ('our')
* {{lang|uk|наш дід}} {{IPA|[nɑʒ ˈdʲid]}} ('our grandfather')
* {{wikt-lang|uk|бере́за}} {{IPA|[bɛˈrɛzɑ]}} ('birch')
* {{wikt-lang|uk|бері́зка}} {{IPA|[bɛˈrʲizkɑ]}} ('small birch')
The exceptions are {{lang|uk|легко}}, {{lang|uk|вогко}}, {{lang|uk|нігті}}, {{lang|uk|кігті}}, {{lang|uk|дьогтю}}, {{lang|uk|дігтяр}}, and derivatives: {{IPA|/ɦ/}} may then be devoiced to {{IPAblink|h}} or even merge with {{IPA|/x/}}.&lt;ref name="bmr3"/&gt;

Unpalatalized dental consonants {{IPA|/n, t, d, t͡s, d͡z, s, z, r, l/}} become palatalized if they are followed by other palatalized dental consonants {{IPA|/nʲ, tʲ, dʲ, t͡sʲ, d͡zʲ, sʲ, zʲ, rʲ, lʲ/}}. They are also typically palatalized before the vowel {{IPA|/i/}}.  Historically, contrasting unpalatalized and palatalized articulations of consonants before {{IPA|/i/}} were possible and more common, with the absence of palatalization usually reflecting that regular sound changes in the language made an {{IPA|/i/}} vowel actually evolve from an older, non-palatalizing {{IPA|/ɔ/}} vowel. [[Ukrainian grammar]] still allows for {{IPA|/i/}} to alternate with either {{IPA|/ɛ/}} or {{IPA|/ɔ/}} in the regular inflection of certain words. The absence of consonant palatalization before {{IPA|/i/}} has become rare, however, but is still allowed.&lt;ref name="bmr3"/&gt;

While the labial consonants {{IPA|/m, p, b, f, w/}} cannot be phonemically palatalized, they can still precede one of the iotating vowels {{lang|uk|є і ьо ю я}}, when many speakers replace the would-be sequences {{IPA|*{{!}}mʲ, pʲ, bʲ, fʲ, wʲ{{!}}}} with the consonant clusters {{IPA|/mj, pj, bj, fj, wj/}}, a habit also common in nearby Polish.&lt;ref name="bmr3"/&gt;  The separation of labial consonant from {{IPA|/j/}} is already hard-coded in many Ukrainian words (and written as such with an apostrophe), such as in {{lang|uk|В'ячеслав}} {{IPA|/wjɑt͡ʃɛˈslɑw/}} "[[Vyacheslav]]", {{wikt-lang|uk|ім'я}} {{IPA|/iˈmjɑ/}} "name" and {{wikt-lang|uk|п'ять}} {{IPA|/pjɑtʲ/}} "five".{{cn|date=September 2017}}

Dental sibilant consonants {{IPA|/t͡s, d͡z, s, z/}} become palatalized before any of the labial consonants {{IPA|/m, p, b, f, w/}} followed by one of the iotating vowels {{lang|uk|є і ьо ю я}}, but the labial consonants themselves cannot retain phonemic palatalization.  Thus, words like {{lang|uk|свят}} {{IPA|/sʲw(j)ɑt/}} "holiday" and {{lang|uk|сват}} {{IPA|/swɑt/}} "matchmaker" retain their separate pronunciations (whether or not an actual {{IPA|/j/}} is articulated).&lt;ref name="bmr3"/&gt;

Sibilant consonants (including affricates) in clusters assimilate with the place of articulation and palatalization state of the last segment in a cluster. The most common case of such assimilation is the verbal ending {{lang|uk|-шся}} in which {{IPA|{{!}}ʃsʲɑ{{!}}}} assimilates into {{IPA|/sʲːɑ/}}.&lt;ref name="bmr3"/&gt;

Dental plosives {{IPA|/t, tʲ, d, dʲ/}} assimilate to affricate articulations before coronal affricates or fricatives {{IPA|/t͡s, d͡z, s, z, t͡sʲ, d͡zʲ, sʲ, zʲ, t͡ʃ, d͡ʒ, ʃ, ʒ/}} and assume the latter consonant's place of articulation and palatalization. If the sequences {{IPA|{{!}}t.t͡s, d.d͡z, t.t͡sʲ, d.d͡zʲ, t.t͡ʃ, d.d͡ʒ{{!}}}} regressively assimilate to {{IPA|/t͡s.t͡s, d͡z.d͡z, t͡sʲ.t͡sʲ, d͡zʲ.d͡zʲ, t͡ʃ.t͡ʃ, d͡ʒ.d͡ʒ/}}, they gain geminate articulations {{IPA|[t͡sː d͡zː t͡sʲː d͡zʲː t͡ʃː d͡ʒː]}}.&lt;ref name="bmr3"/&gt;

== Deviations of spoken language ==
There are some typical deviations which may appear in spoken language (often under the influence of [[Russian language|Russian]]);&lt;ref&gt;[http://ponomariv-kultura-slova.wikidot.com/fonetyka Oleksandr Ponomariv.

* {{IPAblink|ɨ}} for {{IPAslink|ɪ}}
* {{IPAblink|t͡ɕ}} for {{IPAslink|t͡ʃ}} and {{IPA|[ɕt͡ɕ]}} or even {{IPAblink|ɕː}} for {{IPA|[ʃt͡ʃ]}}
* {{IPA|[rʲ]}} for {{IPA|/r/}}, {{IPA|[bʲ]}} for {{IPA|/b/}}, {{IPA|[vʲ]}} for {{IPA|/w/}} ({{lang|uk|Ха́'''р'''ків}}, {{lang|uk|О'''б'''}}, {{lang|uk|любо́'''в'''ю}})
* {{IPA|[v]}} or {{IPA|[f]}} (the latter in syllable-final position) for {{IPA|[w ~ u̯ ~ β̞ ~ ʋ ~ ʍ]}} ({{lang|uk|любо́'''в'''}}, {{lang|uk|роби́'''в'''}}, {{lang|uk|'''в'''ари́ти}}, {{lang|uk|'''в'''ода́}})&lt;ref name="w1"/&gt;, in effect also turning {{IPA|/f, w/}} into a true voiceless-voiced phoneme pair, which is not the case in the standard language
* [[Final-obstruent devoicing]]

== Historical phonology ==
{{main article|Proto-Slavic language}}
Modern standard Ukrainian descends from [[Proto-Slavic|Common Slavic]] and is characterized by a number of [[sound change]]s and morphological developments, many of which are shared with other [[East Slavic languages]]. These include:

# In a newly closed [[syllable]], that is, a syllable that ends in a [[consonant]], Common Slavic *o and *e mutated into *i if the following [[vowel]] was one of the [[yer]]s (*ŭ or *ĭ).{{citation needed|date=November 2009}}
# [[Pleophony]]: The Common Slavic combinations, *CoRC and *CeRC, where R is either *r or *l, become in Ukrainian:
## CorC gives ''CoroC'' (Common Slavic *borda gives Ukrainian ''boroda'', {{wikt-lang|uk|борода́}})
## ColC gives ''ColoC'' (Common Slavic *bolto gives Ukrainian ''boloto'', {{wikt-lang|uk|боло́то}})
## CerC gives ''CereC'' (Common Slavic *berza gives Ukrainian ''bereza'', {{wikt-lang|uk|бере́за}})
## CelC gives ''ColoC'' (Common Slavic *melko gives Ukrainian ''moloko'', {{wikt-lang|uk|молоко́}})
# The Common Slavic nasal vowel *ę is reflected as {{IPA|/jä/}}; a preceding [[labial consonant]] generally was not palatalized after this, and after a [[postalveolar consonant|postalveolar]] it became {{IPA|/ä/}}. Examples: Common Slavic *pętĭ became Ukrainian {{IPA|/pjätʲ/}} ({{wikt-lang|uk|п'ять|п’ять}}); Common Slavic *telę became Ukrainian {{IPA|[tɛˈlʲæ]}} ({{wikt-lang|uk|теля́}}); and Common Slavic *kurĭčę became Ukrainian {{IPA|/kurˈt͡ʃä/}} ({{lang|uk|курча́}}&lt;!-- verification needed --&gt;).{{citation needed|date=November 2009}}
# Common Slavic *ě (Cyrillic ѣ), generally became Ukrainian {{IPA|/i/}} except:{{citation needed|date=November 2009}}
## word-initially, where it became {{IPA|/ji/}}: Common Slavic *(j)ěsti became Ukrainian {{wikt-lang|uk|ї́сти}} {{IPA|/ˈjistɪ/}}
## after the postalveolar sibilants where it became {{IPA|/ä/}}: Common Slavic *ležěti became Ukrainian {{IPA|/lɛˈʒätɪ/}} ({{lang|uk|лежа́ти}})
# Common Slavic *i and *y are both reflected in Ukrainian as {{IPA|/ɪ/}}{{citation needed|date=November 2009}}
# The Common Slavic combination -CĭjV, where V is any vowel, became {{IPA|-CʲːV}}, except:{{citation needed|date=November 2009}}
## if C is labial or {{IPA|/r/}} where it became -CjV
## if V is the Common Slavic *e, then the vowel in Ukrainian mutated to {{IPA|/ä/}}, e.g., Common Slavic *žitĭje became Ukrainian {{IPA|[ʒɪtʲːæ]}} ({{lang|uk|життя́}})
## if V is Common Slavic *ĭ, then the combination became {{IPA|/ɛj/}}, e.g., genitive plural in Common Slavic *myšĭjĭ became Ukrainian {{IPA|/mɪ̞ˈʃɛj/}} ({{lang|uk|мише́й}}&lt;!-- verification needed --&gt;)
## if one or more consonants precede C then there is no doubling of the consonants in Ukrainian
# Sometime around the early thirteenth century, the [[voiced velar stop]] lenited to {{IPA|[ɣ]}} (except in the cluster *zg).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Shevelov|1977|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a century, {{IPA|/ɡ/}} was reintroduced from Western European loanwords and, around the sixteenth century, {{IPA|[ɣ]}} [[debuccalization|debuccalized]] to {{IPA|[ɦ]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Shevelov|1977|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Common Slavic combinations *dl and *tl were simplified to {{IPA|/l/}}, for example, Common Slavic *mydlo became Ukrainian {{IPA|/ˈmɪlɔ/}} ({{wikt-lang|uk|ми́ло}}).{{citation needed|date=November 2009}}
# Common Slavic *ǔl and *ĭl became {{IPA|/ɔw/}}. For example, Common Slavic *vĭlkǔ became {{IPA|/wɔwk/}} ({{wikt-lang|uk|вовк}}) in Ukrainian.{{citation needed|date=November 2009}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2261">'''Wiio's laws''' are ''humoristically'' formulated observations about how [[human communication|humans communicate]].

Wiio's laws are usually commonly with "Human communications usually fail except by accident", which is the main observation made by Professor [[Osmo Antero Wiio]] in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Wiion lait - ja vähän muidenkin (Wiio's laws - and some others) |author=Osmo A. Wiio|isbn=951-35-1657-1|publisher=Weilin+Göös|year=1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/wiio.html |title=A commentary of Wiio's laws |last1=Korpela |first1=Jukka Kalervo |author-link1=:fi:Jukka Korpela (tietokirjailija) |date=2010 |website=IT and communication |access-date=2016-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Flauaus |first=Joeyn |url=http://journal.emwa.org/documents/journal/TWS/TWS%202009%204%2018.pdf |title=Principles of communication |journal=The Write Stuff |publisher=European Medical Writers Association |volume=18 |issue=4 |year=2009 |page=246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The laws ==
The fundamental Wiio's law states that "Communication usually fails, except by accident". The full set of laws is as follows:
# Communication usually fails, except by accident.
## If communication can fail, it will.
## If communication cannot fail, it still most usually fails.
## If communication seems to succeed in the intended way, there's a misunderstanding.
## If you are content with your message, communication certainly fails.
# If a message can be interpreted in several ways, it will be interpreted in a manner that maximizes the damage.
# There is always someone who knows better than you what you meant with your message.
# The more we communicate, the worse communication succeeds.
## The more we communicate, the faster misunderstandings propagate.
# In [[mass communication]], the important thing is not how things are but how they seem to be.
# The importance of a news item is inversely proportional to the square of the distance.
# The more important the situation is, the more probably you forget an essential thing that you remembered a moment ago.
