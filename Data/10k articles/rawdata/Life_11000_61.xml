'''Aimeric de Sarlat''' (fl. c. 1200) was a [[troubadour]] from [[Sarlat]] in the [[Périgord]]. According to his ''[[Vida (Occitan literary form)|vida]]'' he rose by talent from the rank of [[jongleur]] to troubadour, but composed only one song, though four ''[[Canso (song)|cansos]]'' survive under his name.

The sole topic with which his surviving work is concerned is [[courtly love]] and he was an imitator of [[Bernart de Ventadorn]]. A fifth ''canso'', "Fins e leials e senes tot engan", attributed in the [[chansonnier]]s to [[Aimeric de Belenoi]], has been assigned to Aimeric de Sarlat by modern scholarship, partly because it is directed to [[Elvira de Subirats]], wife of [[Ermengol VIII of Urgell]], to whom Aimeric de Sarlat had addressed his "Ja non creirai q'afanz ni cossiriers". An example of Aimeric's poetry:
{|
|
:''Si saubesson parlan mei oill,
:''e.l cor, don tan soven sospir,
:''tot saupras quals son mei consir;
:''car la boca non a ges vassalatge
:''de vos dire zo don lo cor languis. . .
|
:If you knew to speak to my eyes,
:and to my heart, which so often sighs,
:soon you would know all my worries;
:for this the mouth has no authority
:to tell you for what the heart languishes. . .
|}
Aimeric was probably patronised by [[William VIII of Montpellier]]. One of his works may have inspired [[Denis of Portugal]] to compose a poem in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].

'''Aleksa Dundić''' or '''Oleko Dundich''' ({{lang-ru|Олеко Дундич}}{{Cref2|a}}, originally '''Toma Dundić''') (April 13, 1896 &amp;ndash; July 8, 1920) was  a prominent [[Croats|Croatian]]&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/enc3p/NT0001E686 Entry at academic.ru]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://education.kulichki.net/dic/5j.html Entry at education.kulichki.net]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Dundich, Toma", in the ''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'', 3rd edition, Moscow 1972, Volume 8, page 539, column 1605&lt;/ref&gt; participant in [[Russia]]'s [[October Revolution]]. A popular character in [[Russian literature]] (celebrated for his riding skills and courage), Dundić was honoured with the [[Order of the Red Banner]].

== Biography ==
=== Great Soviet Encyclopedia ===
According to the [[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]] (1972 ed.), he was born into a peasant family, in Grabovac, Dalmatia (now [[Croatia]]) on April 13, 1896. [[Croat]] by nationality, as explicitly declared. His given name was Toma. At the age of 12 he went to South America, where he worked for 4 years as a shepherd in [[Argentina]] and [[Brazil]]. In 1914 he was recruited as a private in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]]. During the [[First World War]] of 1914-1918 in May, 1916 Dundic was taken prisoner by Russian troops near [[Lutsk]]. He volunteered to join the First Division of Serbian Volunteer Corps in Russia (Сербский добровольческий корпус). From the middle of 1917, he was a member of the Red Guard (presumably in [[Odessa]]). In March, 1918, he headed a guerrilla squad in the region of [[Bakhmut]] that later joined the Morozov-Donetsk division, which retreated together with the army of K.E. Voroshilov towards [[Volgograd|Tsaritsyn]] in June 1918. He participated in the defence of Tsaritsyn as a member of an international battalion, then with cavalry brigades of Kryuchkovsky and Bulatkin. From 1919, he served in the Special Don Caucasus Division of [[Semyon Budyonny]] (later in the cavalry corps and the First Mounted Army). He was deputy regiment commander, special aide to [[Semyon Budyonny]], commander of mounted division at the headquarters of the First Mounted Army. Dundic took part in numerous battles and he was wounded several times. The legendary courage of Dundić brought him ardent love and popularity among Budyonny's troops. From June 1919 he was the deputy commander of the 36th regiment of the 6th cavalry division. He was killed in battle near Rovno, Ukraine, and awarded the [[Order of the Red Banner]].&lt;ref&gt;"Dundich, Toma", in the ''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'', 3rd edition, Moscow 1972, Volume 8, page 539, column 1605&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other sources ===
According to Zelenin and Sumarokova in 1968, the alleged first biography on Dundić, written by B. V. Agatov in October 1920 (original does not exist), allegedly says that he was born in 1894, in [[Kruševac]], then in the [[Kingdom of Serbia]]. Allegedly, his family were [[Animal husbandry|cattle breeders]]. After finishing [[secondary school]], he left home and entered a mechanical school. He then lived in the [[Americas]] for two years. In 1912-1913, during the [[Balkan Wars]], he was a weapons technician in the Serbian Army. He then served during the First World War, engaging the Austro-German troops, and for his valour shown during the battles on the Danube, he was promoted to second lieutenant. He was wounded twice, and was captured in 1916, the same year he escaped to Russia where he participated in the formation of the Serbian Volunteer Corps. After the February Revolution, he left the Serbian Corps and entered one of the Cossack regiments. After the October Revolution, he sided with the Soviet government and formed and headed an Odessa Red Guard detachment composed of Serb-internationalists. He fought against the Haidamak and cadet bands. He fought in Voronezh on the Don (in 1918), on the Tsaritsyn Front, and was wounded 16 times, then went to the Polish front. He died on July 8, 1920, at Rovno (now Ukraine).  
However, as Zelenin and Sumarokova declared, Agatov himself did not indicate the source of the accounts relating to Dundić's life prior to joining the First Cavalry, what makes his story quite unreliable in that segment. It might be a mixture of two or more different biographies, melted in one. E.g., if Dundić, as a "Serb" served in the Austrian army in World War I, he would be a national traitor.&lt;ref&gt;Comment by Zelenin and Sumarokova, in Prometei 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
In 1958, a joint Yugoslav-Soviet film [[Aleksa Dundić (film)|Aleksa Dundić]] was directed by [[Leonid Lukov]] ({{IMDb title|id=0051345|title=Aleksa Dundić}}).

A street in [[Lviv]], Ukraine, was named after him: "Oleko Dundich Street".

==Annotations==
His given name was Toma Dundić, according to Great Soviet Encyclopedia, Moscow, 1972.

"Alkesa" was his nickname, presumably derived from Spanish "Alejo" (presumably acquired in Argentina), later in Russian as "Олеко" (Oleko), and later in Croatian and Serbian as "Aleksa".

'''Arowanas''' are [[freshwater]] [[bony fish]] of the family '''Osteoglossidae''', also known as '''bonytongues'''&lt;ref name="Australia"&gt;{{cite book|last=Allen|first=G. R.|last2=Midgley|first2=S.

The dorsal and anal fins have soft rays and are long based, while the pectoral and ventral fins are small. The name "bonytongues" is derived from a toothed bone on the floor of the mouth, the "tongue", equipped with teeth that bite against teeth on the roof of the mouth. The arowana is a facultative air breather and can obtain oxygen from air by sucking it into its [[gas bladder|swim bladder]], which is lined with capillaries like [[lung|lung tissue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Berra|first= Tim M. |year=2001|title=Freshwater Fish Distribution|location=San Diego|publisher= Academic Press|isbn= 0-12-093156-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution==

Osteoglossids are [[primitive (biology)|basal]] fish that originated some time during the [[Cretaceous]], and are placed in the [[actinopterygii]]d order [[Osteoglossiformes]]. As traditionally defined, the family includes several [[Extant taxon|extant]] species from South America, [[African arowana|one from Africa]], [[Asian arowana|several from Asia]], and two from [[Australia]].&lt;ref name="Australia"/&gt; Today [[Arapaimidae]] is often regarded as a separate family, which includes the [[Arapaima (genus)|arapaimas]] and the [[African arowana]].&lt;ref name=FamArapaimidae/&gt; Consequently, the South American genus ''[[Osteoglossum]]'', and the Asian and Australian genus ''[[Scleropages]]'' are the only extant genera that remain in the osteoglossid family.&lt;ref&gt;{{FishBase family | family = Osteoglossids| month = July | year = 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arapaimidae and Osteoglossidae split about 220 million years ago (Mya), during the [[Late Triassic]].&lt;ref name="Kumazawa 2003"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kumazawa | first = Yoshinori | journal = Quarterly Journal Biohistory | issue = Winter | year = 2003 | title = The reason the freshwater fish arowana live across the sea | url = http://www.brh.co.jp/en/experience/journal/39/research_1.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205000120/http://www.brh.co.jp/en/experience/journal/39/research_1.html |archivedate=5 February 2012 |accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Heterotis niloticus.jpg|thumb|247x247px|A sketch of an African Arowana.]]
Within Osteoglossidae, the South America ''Osteoglossum'' arowanas diverged from the Asian and Australian ''Scleropages'' arowanas about 170 Mya, during the [[Middle Jurassic]].&lt;ref name="Kumazawa 2003"/&gt;

The Osteoglossidae are the only exclusively freshwater fish family found on both sides of the [[Wallace Line]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | author = Ismail, Mohd Zakaria | title = Systematics, Zoogeography, and Conservation of the Freshwater Fishes of Peninsular Malaysia | version =  | publisher =  Colorado State University | year = 1989 | type =  doctoral dissertation | pages = 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be explained by the theory that [[Asian arowana]]s  (''S. formosus'') diverged from the Australian ''Scleropages'', ''S. jardinii'' and ''S. leichardti'', about 140 Mya, making it likely that Asian arowanas were carried to Asia on the [[Indian subcontinent]].&lt;ref name="Kumazawa 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kumazawa | first = Yoshinori | author2 = Nishida, Mutsumi | journal = Molecular Biology and Evolution | volume = 17 | issue = 12 | date=1 December 2000| title = Molecular Phylogeny of Osteoglossoids: A New Model for Gondwanian Origin and Plate Tectonic Transportation of the Asian Arowana | url = http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/17/12/1869 | accessdate = 2006-07-12 | pmid = 11110903 | pages = 1869–78 | doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a026288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fossil record==
At least five extinct genera, known only from fossils, are classified as osteoglossids; these date back at least as far as the [[Late Cretaceous]]. Other fossils from as far back as the [[Late Jurassic]] or [[Early Cretaceous]] are widely considered to belong to the arowana superorder [[Osteoglossomorpha]]. Osteoglossomorph fossils have been found on all continents except Antarctica.&lt;ref name="guo"&gt;{{cite web | last = Guo-Qing | first = Li | author2 = Wilson, Mark V.

==Behavior==
Osteoglossids are [[carnivore|carnivorous]], often being specialized surface feeders. They are excellent jumpers;  ''Osteoglossum'' species have been seen leaping more than 6&amp;nbsp;ft (almost 2 m) from the water surface to pick off insects and birds from overhanging branches in South America, hence the nickname "water monkeys". Arowana species typically grow to around 2 to 3&amp;nbsp;ft in captivity.

Several species of osteoglossids exhibit parental care. They build nests and protect their young after they hatch. All species are [[mouthbrooder]]s, the parents holding sometimes hundreds of eggs in their mouths. The young may make several tentative trips outside the parent's mouth to investigate the surroundings before leaving permanently.

Unlike most fishes that start reproducing at around six months of age, the Arowana usually takes three to four years to reach sexual maturity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arowana - Description, Habitat, Image, Diet, and Interesting Facts |url=https://animals.net/arowana/ |publisher=Animals Network |accessdate=31 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the aquarium==
Depending on the classification system used, there are 10 types of arowana commonly kept as pets; 4 from [[Asian arowana|Asia]], 3 from [[Osteoglossum|South America]], 2 from [[Scleropages|Australia]] and 1 from [[African arowana|Africa]].

Arowanas are solitary fish and only allow company while young; adults may show dominance and aggression.

'''Chondrostei''' are primarily [[cartilage|cartilaginous]] fish showing some degree of [[ossification]]. It is thought that the cartilaginous condition is derived, and that the ancestors of this group were bony fish with fully ossified skeletons. Members of this group  share with the [[Elasmobranchii]] certain features such as the possession of [[spiracle]]s, a [[Fish fin#AnchCaudal|heterocercal tail]] and the absence of scales. Nevertheless, the fossil record suggests they have more in common with the [[teleost]]s. The Chondrostei is probably a [[paraphyly|paraphyletic]] grouping; the fifty-two living species are divided among two orders, the [[Acipenseriformes]] ([[sturgeon]]s and [[paddlefish]]es), and the [[Bichir|Polypteriformes]] ([[reedfish]]es and [[bichir]]s).

==Characteristics==
The main distinguishing feature of this group is the cartilaginous nature of the skeleton, although some older fish show a degree of calcification. The ancestors of the chondrosteans are thought to be [[bony fish]], but that this characteristic of an ossified skeleton was lost in later [[evolution]]ary development, resulting in a lightening of the frame. Elderly chondrostean individuals show beginnings of ossification of the skeleton, which suggests this process is delayed rather than wholly lost in these fishes.&lt;ref name="chondro"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.palaeos.com/Vertebrates/Units/090Teleostomi/090.300.html |title=Chondrosteans: Sturgeon Relatives |publisher=paleos.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225152809/http://www.palaeos.com/Vertebrates/Units/090Teleostomi/090.300.html |archivedate=2010-12-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxonomy==
This group has at times been classified with the [[shark]]s: this because the chondrosteans, like the latter, mostly lack bone, and their structure of the jaw is more akin to that of sharks than of other bony fish; further, both groups lack [[Scale (zoology)|scales]] (excluding the Polypteriforms). Additional shared features include [[spiracle]]s and, in sturgeons and paddlefishes, a [[Fish fin#AnchCaudal|heterocercal tail]] (the [[vertebra]]e extend into the larger lobe of the [[caudal fin]]). However the fossil record suggests these fish have more characters in common with the [[Teleostei]] than their external appearance might suggest.&lt;ref name="chondro"/&gt;

Chondrostei is [[paraphyly|paraphyletic]], meaning this subclass does not contain all the descendants of their common ancestor; reclassification of the Chondrostei is therefore not out of the question.

The name comes from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''chondros'' meaning cartilage and ''osteo'' meaning bone.

'''Cultural algorithms (CA)''' are a branch of [[evolutionary computation]] where there is a knowledge component that is called the belief space in addition to the [[population]] component. In this sense, cultural algorithms can be seen as an extension to a conventional [[genetic algorithm]]. Cultural algorithms were introduced by Reynolds (see references).&lt;!-- Deleted image removed:  [[Image:Cultural Algorithm.svg|400px|right]] --&gt;

== Belief space ==
The belief space of a cultural algorithm is divided into distinct categories. These categories represent different domains of knowledge that the population has of the [[search algorithm|search space]].

The belief space is updated after each [[iteration]] by the best individuals of the population. The best individuals can be selected using a [[fitness function]] that assesses the performance of each individual in population much like in genetic algorithms.

=== List of belief space categories ===

* '''[[Nomr (sociology)|Normative]] knowledge''' A collection of desirable value ranges for the individuals in the population component e.g. acceptable behavior for the agents in population.
* '''Domain specific knowledge''' Information about the domain of the cultural algorithm problem is applied to.
* '''Situational knowledge''' Specific examples of important events - e.g. successful/unsuccessful solutions
* '''Temporal knowledge''' History of the search space - e.g. the temporal patterns of the search process
* '''Spatial knowledge''' Information about the topography of the search space

== Population==
The population component of the cultural algorithm is approximately the same as that of the [[genetic algorithm]].

== Communication protocol ==
Cultural algorithms require an [[wikt:interface|interface]] between the population and belief space. The best individuals of the population can update the belief space via the update function. Also, the knowledge categories of the belief space can affect the population component via the influence function. The influence function can affect population by altering the genome or the actions of the individuals.

==Pseudo-code for cultural algorithms==
# Initialize '''population space''' (choose initial [[population]])
# Initialize '''belief space''' (e.g. set domain specific knowledge and normative value-ranges)
# Repeat until termination condition is met
## Perform actions of the individuals in '''population space'''
## Evaluate each individual by using the '''fitness function'''
## Select the parents to reproduce a new generation of offspring
## Let the belief space alter the genome of the offspring by using the '''influence function'''
## Update the belief space by using the '''accept function''' (this is done by letting the best individuals to affect the belief space)

'''David Geddes Hartwell''' (July 10, 1941 – January 20, 2016) was an American critic, publisher, and editor of thousands of [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] novels. He was best known for work with Signet, Pocket, and [[Tor Books]] publishers. He was also noted as an award-winning editor of anthologies. ''[[The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction]]'' describes him as "perhaps the single most influential book editor of the past forty years in the American [science fiction] publishing world".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/hartwell_david_g ''SF Encyclopedia'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Hartwell was born in [[Salem, Massachusetts]], and attended [[Williams College]], where he graduated with a BA in 1963. He continued his studies at [[Colgate University]] for an MA in 1965, and at [[Columbia University]] where he graduated with a Ph.D. in Comparative Medieval Literature in 1973. By 1965 Hartwell was already working as editor and publisher of ''The Little Magazine'' (1965-1988), a small press literary magazine.&lt;ref name=SF&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/hartwell_david_g#sthash.A720OWsx.dpuf|title=Hartwell, David G.|accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Hartwell worked for [[Signet Books|Signet]] (1971–73), Berkley Putnam (1973–78) and Pocket, where he founded the [[Timescape Books|Timescape]] imprint (1980–85) and created the Pocket Books [[Star Trek]] publishing line. From 1984 until his death he worked for [[Tor Books]],&lt;ref name="gizmodo"/&gt; where he spearheaded Tor's Canadian publishing initiative at [[CAN-CON (convention)|CAN-CON]] in [[Ottawa]], and was also influential in bringing many Australian writers to the US market. Since 1995, his title at Tor/[[Forge Books]] was "Senior Editor".&lt;ref name=SF /&gt;

In 1977, Hartwell edited the short-lived ''Cosmos'' magazine for the newly formed Baronet publishing. ''Cosmos'' is remembered as "a fine magazine, providing a good range of quality fiction" in an attractive package, but poor sales for the rest of the publisher's magazine line forced its cancellation after only four issues.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mike Ashley (writer)|Mike Ashley]], ''Gateways to Forever'', [[Liverpool University Press]], 2007, pp.323-325. {{ISBN|978-1846310034}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, Hartwell founded ''[[The New York Review of Science Fiction]]'', where he served as reviews editor. The magazine was published by Dragon Press, a small independent publisher and bookseller, first established by Hartwell in 1988 as a partnership. He later became the sole proprietor. Hartwell chaired the board of directors of the [[World Fantasy Convention]] and, with [[Gordon Van Gelder]], was the administrator of the [[Philip K. Dick Award]]. Hartwell edited numerous anthologies, and published a number of critical essays on science fiction and fantasy.&lt;ref name=SF /&gt;

Hartwell was also a book review editor of rock music magazine ''[[Crawdaddy!]]'', founded by [[Paul Williams (music journalist)]] in 1966, and published through the 1970s.&lt;ref name="gizmodo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/david-g-hartwell-kept-restoring-our-faith-in-science-f-1754161464|title=David G.

==Awards and other achievements==
Hartwell edited two annual anthologies: ''[[Year's Best SF]]'', started in 1996 and co-edited with [[Kathryn Cramer]] since 2002, and ''Year's Best Fantasy'', co-edited with Cramer from 2001 through 2010.  Both anthologies have consistently placed in the top 10 of the [[Locus (magazine)|Locus]] annual reader poll in the category of Best Anthology.  In 1988, he won the [[World Fantasy Award]] in the category Best Anthology for ''The Dark Descent''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=World Fantasy Convention |title=Award Winners and Nominees |url=http://www.worldfantasy.org/awards/awardslist.html/ |accessdate=4 Feb 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201074405/http://worldfantasy.org/awards/awardslist.html |archivedate=2010-12-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hartwell was nominated for the [[Hugo Award]] forty-one times, nineteen in the category of [[Hugo Award for Best Professional Editor|Best Professional Editor]] and [[Hugo Award for Best Editor Long Form|Best Editor Long Form]], winning in 2006, 2008 and 2009, and twenty-two times as editor/publisher of ''The New York Review of Science Fiction''.  He has also placed in the top ten in the ''[[Locus (magazine)|Locus]]'' poll for best editor for twenty-seven consecutive years, every year from the award category's inception to the present day.&lt;ref name=sfadb&gt;[http://www.sfadb.com/David_G_Hartwell Science Fiction Awards Database]&lt;/ref&gt; He edited the best-novel [[Nebula Award]]-winners ''[[Timescape]]'' by [[Gregory Benford]]  (published 1980), ''[[The Claw of the Conciliator]]'' by [[Gene Wolfe]] (published 1981), and ''[[No Enemy But Time]]'' by [[Michael Bishop (author)|Michael Bishop]] (published 1982), the best-novel Hugo Award-winner ''[[Hominids]]'' by [[Robert J. Sawyer]] (published 2002), and the [[World Fantasy Award]]-winning novels ''[[The Shadow of the Torturer]]'' by Gene Wolfe (1981) and ''[[The Dragon Waiting]]'' by [[John M. Ford]] (1984).&lt;ref name=sfadb/&gt;&lt;ref name=Locus /&gt;

Hartwell was a Guest of Honor at the [[67th World Science Fiction Convention]] in Montreal in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sfwa.org/2016/01/in-memoriam-david-g-hartwell/ In Memoriam: David G. Hartwell (SFWA)]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was posthumously awarded the World Fantasy Life Achievement Award in October 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tor.com/2016/10/30/announcing-the-2016-world-fantasy-award-winners/Announcing the 2016 World Fantasy Award Winners], [[Tor.com]], October 30, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Constable#United Kingdom and the Commonwealth|WPC]] '''Nina Alexandra Mackay''' was a police officer serving with London's [[Metropolitan Police Service]] who was fatally stabbed on 24 October 1997 by a man with [[paranoid schizophrenia]] she was attempting to arrest. She is the only female police officer in Great Britain to have been stabbed to death while on duty and her killing was the first of a female officer since the [[murder of Yvonne Fletcher]] in 1984.

==Background==
Mackay was from [[Essex]], the only daughter of Sidney MacKay, a former [[chief superintendent]] with the [[Metropolitan Police Service]]. She attended [[Davenant Foundation School]], Loughton, Essex from 1983-1990.&lt;ref&gt;East London &amp; West Essex Guardian 16 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Mackay joined the Metropolitan Police and served in the service's [[Territorial Support Group]] for five years until her death.&lt;ref name=bbc1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/79569.stm |title=Man admits manslaughter of WPC |publisher=BBC News |date=22 October 1998 |accessdate=2011-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
On 24 October 1997, Mackay went with colleagues to a property in Arthingworth Street in [[Stratford, London|Stratford]], east London, to arrest a man who was in breach of bail conditions.&lt;ref name=bbc1/&gt;

After removing her protective vest for ease of movement and then forcing entry into the [[bedsit]], Mackay led her colleagues into the hallway, where she was confronted by a man armed with a knife with a seven-and-a-half-inch blade. He stabbed the officer once in the abdomen. She was taken to hospital by ambulance but died two hours later from her injuries. The suspect was arrested and later charged with her murder.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news |author=Amelia Gentleman |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/apr/20/ameliagentleman |title=Serious failings led to PC death  |newspaper=The Guardian |date=19 April 1999 |accessdate=2017-02-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
At the [[Old Bailey]] in October 1998, Magdi Elgizouli, an unemployed man with [[paranoid schizophrenia]] was convicted of Mackay's [[Manslaughter in English law|manslaughter]]. The British-born 30-year-old of [[Sudan]]ese origin had been charged with [[Murder in English law|murder]] but the jury accepted his defence of [[Diminished responsibility in English law|diminished responsibility]]. He was [[Mental Health Act 1983|detained indefinitely]], initially at [[Rampton Secure Hospital]] in Nottinghamshire&lt;ref name=bbc1/&gt; and later at [[West London Mental Health NHS Trust|St. Bernard's Hospital]] in west London.&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;{{cite news |author=Sarah Knapton |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2622519/Police-warned-to-stay-away-from-released-killer.html |title=Police warned to stay away from released killer |newspaper=Daily Telegraph |date=26 August 2008 |accessdate=2017-02-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was subsequently reported that prior to killing Mackay, Elgizouli had served time in prison for [[shoplifting]], was on bail for assaulting a police officer and possessing a knife, and had stopped taking his medication for his schizophrenia. He had also smoked [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], which had apparently exacerbated his condition, and he had an expressed hatred of the police.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

A 1999 inquiry into Mackay's death criticized the Metropolitan Police for not attempting to have a family member persuade Elgizouli to leave the flat peacefully, and recommended that mentally ill people should be given greater support and that guidance on helping patients take their medication needed to be improved.&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt; Despite calls from Mackay's family, the report did not recommend that patients be compelled to take their medication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/323088.stm |title=Mentally ill 'need more support' |publisher=BBC News |date=19 April 1999 |accessdate=2011-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 Elgizouli was granted day-release from his secure unit for four hours per week,&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt; plus a further five hours once each month to visit his brother.{{cn|date=February 2017}} After four years of occasional day-release, in 2012 it was reported that Elgizouli was to be moved from the secure unit to a community hostel with full freedom of movement. Due to his expressed hatred of the police, he was to be housed in a suburban area of London with few police on patrol.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

===Memorials===
[[File:Nina Mackay II.JPG|thumb|right|The ''Nina Mackay II'' police boat]]
In 1998, the [[Police Memorial Trust]] erected a memorial to Mackay at the place on Arthingworth Street in Stratford where she was stabbed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.policememorial.org.uk/Police_Memorial_Trust/PMT_Local_Memorials/PMT-Mackay-1997/PMT-Mackay-1997.htm |title=Police Memorial for Nina MacKay |publisher=Policememorial.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The memorial was unveiled by the then prime minister, [[Tony Blair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/198645.stm |title=Blair's tribute to 'remarkable' officer |publisher=BBC News |date= |accessdate=2011-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Metropolitan Police Marine Policing Unit]] has a Botnia Targa 31 boat named ''Nina Mackay II'' and there is a road in Stratford called Nina Mackay Close.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pc Nina Mackay honoured in Stratford on 15th anniversary of death|author=Kay Atwal|url=http://www.newhamrecorder.co.uk/news/pc_nina_mackay_honoured_in_stratford_on_15th_anniversary_of_death_1_1676077|newspaper=[[Newham Recorder]]|date=31 October 2012 |accessdate=7 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
[[Image:Aquarius external.jpg|thumbnail|right|The Aquarius habitat.]]
In May 2009, Smith was aboard Aquarius to train U.S. Navy divers in [[saturation diving]] and prepare for upcoming scientific studies in the [[Conch Reef]] area.&lt;ref name="Silk"/&gt;

On May 5, 2009, Smith was assisting two Navy divers, Bill Dodd and Corey Seymour, who were 300 feet from Aquarius using an underwater [[jackhammer]] to install a way station that would contain breathable air. Smith informed Dodd and Seymour that he was returning to Aquarius but would be back. Five or ten minutes later, Seymour noticed that Smith was lying on his side in the water, his mouthpiece out of his mouth. Seymour began carrying Smith back to Aquarius, but his air umbilical became fouled about thirty yards from the habitat. Dodd carried Smith the rest of the distance to Aquarius, where the other divers in the habitat helped them get Smith inside. Resuscitation attempts by Dodd, Seymour, and two Navy physicians who dove to the habitat were unsuccessful. Smith was pronounced dead at 3:25 pm by a Navy doctor. His death was the first associated with the Aquarius program.&lt;ref name="Silk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hellwarth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UNCW"/&gt;

A subsequent investigation by a panel of outside experts determined that Smith's death was caused by a combination of three factors: the failure of the electronic functions of his [[Rebreather#Fully closed circuit rebreather|Inspiration closed circuit rebreather]] (CCR) due to hydrodynamic forces from the hydraulic impact hammer being used nearby, Smith's inattention to his handset and [[Head-up display|head up]] displays, and the other two divers allowing Smith to return to Aquarius alone. The investigation concluded that due to these issues Smith became unconscious from [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] and drowned when the mouthpiece came out of his mouth. Saturation and CCR diving at Aquarius were suspended in the wake of Smith's death, but the review board recommended that they be resumed with the implementation of additional safety measures.&lt;ref name="Report"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5768">'''Elizabeth Leyburne, Duchess of Norfolk''' (1536 – 4 September 1567), was a member of the [[English nobility]]. She first married [[Thomas Dacre, 4th Baron Dacre]]; following his death in 1566, she  secretly married [[Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Kathy Lynn Emerson|Emerson, Kathy Lynn]]. ''A Who's Who of Tudor Women-L'' as sourced from the [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]&lt;/ref&gt; She was his third wife.
[[File:Elizabeth leyburne.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of Elizabeth Leyburne attributed to [[Hans Eworth]], c.1560]]

==Family==
Elizabeth was born in 1536, the daughter of Sir [[James Leyburn]] of Cunswick, [[Westmorland]], and his wife Helen Preston. The latter was the child of Thomas Preston and Anne Thornburgh. She had one sister, Anne, who married William Stanley, 3rd Baron Monteagle, by whom she had a daughter, Elizabeth.

Several members of the Leyburne (also written as Leybourne and Leyburn) family were [[recusancy|recusants]], and James Leyburn, Elizabeth's great-nephew, was executed as "a catholic traitor" in 1583.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1509-1558/member/leyburn-sir-james-1490-1548 Sir James Leyburn MP] in ''History of Parliament Online'' website&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriages and issue==
She married her first husband, [[Thomas Dacre, 4th Baron Dacre|Thomas Dacre, 4th Baron Dacre of Gilsland]] in 1555. The marriage produced five children:
* Francis Dacre (d. an infant)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cracroftspeerage.co.uk/online/content/DacreG1473.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111126062645/http://www.cracroftspeerage.co.uk/online/content/DacreG1473.htm |archivedate=2011-11-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Anne Dacre, Countess of Arundel|Anne Dacre]] (21 March 1557- 19 April 1630), married [[Philip Howard, 20th Earl of Arundel]], by whom she had issue.
* [[George Dacre, 5th Baron Dacre]] (1560- 17 May 1569)
* Margaret Dacre (4 July 1563- 7 April 1578) married Thomas Howard (1561–1626), later 1st Earl of Suffolk
* Elizabeth Dacre (12 November 1564- 1639), married [[Lord William Howard]], by whom she had issue.

There was disagreement between Elizabeth and the Dacres as to her husband's will, which settled his lands on his son and brothers, limiting their inheritance to heirs male. Elizabeth allegedly felt aggrieved on behalf of her daughters, but according to her brother-in-law [[Leonard Dacre]], Elizabeth herself received more ‘than ever anye the wyves of the auncestors of the said Lorde Dacre had.’&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/articleHL/6994?anchor=match&lt;/ref&gt; Six months after her husband died on 25 July 1566,&lt;ref&gt;Emerson&lt;/ref&gt; she secretly married [[Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk]] on 29 January 1567, becoming his third wife. The marriage ceremony was conducted in secrecy in the London home of her mother.&lt;ref&gt;Emerson&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
On 4 September 1567, just over seven months after her marriage, Elizabeth died in childbirth at [[Kenninghall]], Norfolk [http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/DACRE.htm]; the baby, whose gender is not known, also died.  It seems that, although Elizabeth was devoutly Catholic, her Protestant husband would not allow her access to a Catholic priest as she lay dying in labour:

&lt;blockquote&gt;the Duchesse . . . desir'd to have been reconciled by a Priest, who for that end was conducted into the garden, yet could not have access unto her, either by reason of the Duke's vigilance to hinder it, or at least of his continual presence in the chamber at that time.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Duke was granted wardship of her children two months after her death&lt;ref&gt;Emerson&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth's son, George, who had succeeded his father as 5th Baron Dacre, died at the age of nine in 1569. Norfolk later arranged the marriages of her three daughters to his own sons by his former wives. In 1571, [[Anne Howard, Countess of Arundel|Anne]] married her stepbrother [[Philip Howard, 20th Earl of Arundel|Philip Howard (1557–1595)]], later 20th Earl of Arundel; before 9 May 1577, Mary had married [[Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk|Thomas Howard (1561–1626)]], later 1st Earl of Suffolk, her stepbrother;&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Howard, Thomas (1561-1626)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 28 October 1577 Elizabeth married [[Lord William Howard]] (1563–1640), of Naworth Castle, Cumberland, and of Henderskelfe Castle, Yorkshire, the Duke's third son.&lt;ref name="acad"&gt;{{acad|id=HWRT577W|name=Howard, Lord William}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elizabeth's daughter Mary Howard died on 7 April 1578 at the age of fourteen, but her eldest child, Anne Howard, survived until 1630. The third daughter Elizabeth, gained the nickname "Bess of the Broad Apron", thanks to the size of the estates which came to her.

Elizabeth Leyburne was, according to her daughter Anne's biographer, ‘Daughter of Sir James Labourn a Knight much esteem'd and honour'd in Lancashire. For her Beauty, Person, Wit, and Discretion, she was qualify'd to wear a Crown.'

'''Elmo''' is a [[The Muppets|Muppet]] character on the children's television show ''[[Sesame Street]]''. He is a furry red monster with a [[falsetto]] voice, who hosts the last full fifteen-minute segment (five minutes after 2017) on ''Sesame Street'', "[[Elmo's World]]", which is aimed at [[toddler]]s. He was most often puppeteered by [[Kevin Clash]]. Following Clash's resignation in late 2012, he has been puppeteered by [[Ryan Dillon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://dailyentertainmentnews.com/tv/ryan-dillon-is-the-new-voice-of-elmo/ |title=Ryan Dillon is the New Voice of Elmo |publisher=DailyEntertainmentNews.com |date=2013-04-02 |accessdate=2014-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==History==
Elmo is self-described as three-and-a-half years old and his birthday is on February 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=This Week in Sesame Street: Elmo’s Birthday|url=http://www.sesameworkshop.org/our-blog/2012/02/03/this-week-in-sesame-street-elmos-birthday|publisher=Sesame Workshop}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Elmo characteristically avoids pronouns in reference to himself, instead [[illeism|referring to himself in the third person]] (e.g. saying "Elmo wants this" instead of "I want this").&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ''Sesame Street'' staff writer Nancy Sans once described Elmo's origins: "There was this extra red puppet lying around and the cast would pick him up sometimes and try to create a personality, but nothing seemed to materialize."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rhoades|first=Shirrel|title=Being Elmo|url=http://tropiccinema.blogspot.com/2011/12/being-elmo-rhoades.html|publisher=Tropic Cinema|accessdate=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The puppet, originally known as "Baby Monster", was performed by [[Caroll Spinney]] and [[Jerry Nelson]] in the background of episodes from the early 1970s, [[Brian Muehl]] from 1979 to 1981, and [[Richard Hunt (puppeteer)|Richard Hunt]] from 1981 to 1984. Sans continues that "...one day [in 1984], [[Kevin Clash]], a talented puppeteer, raised him up and brought energy and life into Elmo and from that day forward we would all write for Elmo. Kevin's performance inspired the writers to develop Elmo's character".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Shon | first=Debora | title=Sesame Street will spend this weekend in Poughkeepsie |date=2006-01-31 | publisher=Poughkeepsie Journal | url=http://www.poughkeepsiejournal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060131/LIFE/601310301/1005}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Tartaglia]], [[Matt Vogel (puppeteer)|Matt Vogel]], and [[Jim Martin (puppeteer)|Jim Martin]] have all been secondary performers for the character, providing movement for Elmo's arms and legs, particularly in green-screen shots.

Alongside [[Cookie Monster]], Elmo has appeared in ''[[The Furchester Hotel]]'', where he is taking an extended stay because of his fascination with the Furchester Hotel. His father Louie is the brother of Funella Furchester.

==Popular culture==
After becoming a regular guest on ''[[The Rosie O'Donnell Show]]'', Elmo began touring the talk-show circuit. He has appeared on ''[[Martha Stewart Living]]'' and ''[[Martha]]'', ''[[The Tony Danza Show (2004 talk show)|The Tony Danza Show]]'', ''[[Rove (TV series)|Rove Live]]'', ''[[Wait Wait...Don't Tell Me!]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/rundowns/rundown.php?prgId=35&amp;prgDate=09-30-2006&amp;view=storyview |title=Wait Wait...Don't Tell Me! |publisher=NPR |date= |accessdate=2014-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]''. Elmo and a developmental expert gave babysitting tips on the June 18, 2005 episode of ''[[Teen Kids News]]''. He has also appeared on ''[[Emeril Live]]'', helping [[Emeril]] make (non-alcoholic) eggnog during a Holiday Special shown in December 2008. Kevin Clash and [[Aaron Neville]] were also guests on this show. On a special episode of ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show|Oprah]]'' called "The Faces Behind the Famous Names", Kevin Clash and Elmo appeared at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aguysguidetooprah.com/2008/06/barbie-marc-jacobs-jimmy-choo-and-elmo.html |title=A Guy's Guide to Oprah: 'Barbie, Marc Jacobs, Jimmy Choo, and Elmo' |date=June 2008 |publisher=Aguysguidetooprah.com |access-date=2014-06-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219082624/http://aguysguidetooprah.com/2008/06/barbie-marc-jacobs-jimmy-choo-and-elmo.html/ |archivedate=2012-02-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elmo was the star of the 1999 full-length, theatrically released motion picture ''[[The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland]]''. He also starred in the film ''[[Elmo Saves Christmas]]''.

Elmo also appeared in a fifth season episode of ''[[The West Wing (TV series)|The West Wing]]'' along with his friends [[Zoe (Sesame Street)|Zoe]] and [[Big Bird]]. In that episode, Elmo receives a medical checkup from [[Abbey Bartlet]], the [[First Lady]] (who is making a guest appearance on ''Sesame Street''), and cheekily questions her about the validity of her medical license.

Elmo also appeared in the eighth season episode of ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'', "[[My ABC's]]", along with [[Oscar the Grouch]], [[Grover]], and an Anything Muppet named "Ex Ray". All four characters are in separate fantasies of [[J.D. (Scrubs)|J.D.'s]] in the episode.

At the request and with the assistance of Rep. [[Duke Cunningham]], he testified before the [[House Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services and Education]] in April 2002, urging support for increased funding in music education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2002-04-23/politics/elmo.hill_1_elmo-instruments-congressional-committee |title=Mr. Elmo goes to Washington |publisher=CNN |date=2002-04-24 |accessdate=2014-06-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011091903/http://articles.cnn.com/2002-04-23/politics/elmo.hill_1_elmo-instruments-congressional-committee?_s=PM%3AALLPOLITICS |archivedate=2012-10-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Emeril and Elmo's Healthy Start]]'' was a special featuring Elmo and [[Emeril Lagasse]] that aired on November 4, 2005 at 8 p.m. as part of the [[Food Network|Food Network's]] second annual "Cook With Your Kids Week". The special was produced in conjunction with Sesame Workshop's [[Healthy Habits for Life]] program.

In 1996, a [[Tickle Me Elmo]] doll became a [[fad]] [[toy]].&lt;ref name=People&gt;[http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20143226,00.html "Just Tickled"]. [[People Magazine]]. Vol. 47 No. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2003 Pixar movie ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', one of the names Dory calls Nemo is "Elmo".

Elmo has also made many appearances on ''[[The Simpsons]]''. In ''[[Missionary: Impossible]]'', he chases [[Homer Simpson]]. In ''[[Bart-Mangled Banner]]'', he is [[Bill Clinton]]'s cellmate. In ''[[Stop or My Dog Will Shoot!]]'', [[Chief Clancy Wiggum]] shows a shirt where Big Bird is killing Elmo. In the episode ''[[How the Test Was Won]]'' Clancy's son [[Ralph Wiggum|Ralph]] finds a rat and says "I'm playing with Elmo". In the episode ''[[The Color Yellow]]'' Ralph has a drawing of himself with Elmo and [[Buzz Lightyear]] from the ''[[Toy Story (franchise)|Toy Story]]'' franchise.

==Criticism and controversy==
Fans of ''Sesame Street'' have complained that Elmo's prominent status has caused roles to be greatly reduced for some older characters, such as [[Oscar the Grouch]], [[Big Bird]], [[Count von Count]], [[Prairie Dawn]], [[Grover]], and [[Cookie Monster]]. Some fans also blame Elmo for the permanent departure of [[Kermit the Frog]] from Sesame Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jumptheshark.com/topic/sesame-street-general-comments/1767 |title=Jumptheshark.com |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071010051720/http://www.jumptheshark.com/topic/sesame-street-general-comments/1767 |archivedate = 2007-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Elmo has been referred to as the "Little Red Menace" by Sesame Street traditionalists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/s_412445.html "Elmo dethrones Big Bird"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823084740/http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/s_412445.html |date=2010-08-23 }}, Kim Lyons, ''Pittsburgh Tribune-Review'', Jan. 11, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In its [[FAQ]], the Sesame Workshop addresses the allegation that Elmo [[illeism|referring to himself in the third person]] will teach children [[improper English]], by stating that this behavior "mimics the behavior of many preschoolers. Like 3-year-olds, he doesn’t always have the skills or knowledge to speak proper English."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sesameworkshop.org/faq?p_p_lifecycle=0&amp;p_p_id=faq_WAR_sesameportlets4369&amp;_faq_WAR_sesameportlets4369_action=addquestion&amp;_faq_WAR_sesameportlets4369_category=About%20the%20Television%20Program&amp;_faq_WAR_sesameportlets4369_faqtype=faq&amp;p_p_lifecycle=0&amp;p_p_id=browsefaq_WAR_sesameportlets4369&amp;_browsefaq_WAR_sesameportlets4369_category=About%20the%20Television%20Program#|publisher=Sesame Workshop|work=Frequently Asked Questions|title=Why does Elmo refer to himself in the third person?

'''Facial electromyography''' ('''fEMG''') refers to an [[electromyography]] (EMG) technique that measures muscle activity by detecting and amplifying the tiny electrical impulses that are generated by muscle fibers when they contract.

It primarily focuses on two major muscle groups in the face, the [[corrugator supercilii muscle|corrugator supercilii]] group which is associated with frowning and the [[zygomaticus major muscle]] group which is associated with smiling.&lt;ref name="pmid14696731"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Larsen JT, Norris CJ, Cacioppo JT |title=Effects of positive and negative affect on electromyographic activity over zygomaticus major and corrugator supercilii |journal=Psychophysiology |volume=40 |issue=5 |pages=776–85 |date=September 2003 |pmid=14696731 |doi= 10.1111/1469-8986.00078|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&amp;sid=nlm:pubmed&amp;issn=0048-5772&amp;date=2003&amp;volume=40&amp;issue=5&amp;spage=776}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18598725"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sato W, Fujimura T, Suzuki N |title=Enhanced facial EMG activity in response to dynamic facial expressions |journal=Int J Psychophysiol |volume=70 |issue=1 |pages=70–4 |date=October 2008 |pmid=18598725 |doi=10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2008.06.001 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0167-8760(08)00698-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
[[File:Zygomaticus.png|thumb|[[Zygomaticus major muscle]] (associated with smiling)]]
Facial EMG has been studied to assess its utility as a tool for measuring [[emotion]]al reaction.&lt;ref name="pmid2274612"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dimberg U |title=Facial electromyography and emotional reactions |journal=Psychophysiology |volume=27 |issue=5 |pages=481–94 |date=September 1990 |pmid=2274612 |doi= 10.1111/j.1469-8986.1990.tb01962.x|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have found that activity of the corrugator muscle, which lowers the eyebrow and is involved in producing frowns, varies inversely with the emotional valence of presented [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] and reports of [[Mood (psychology)|mood]] state{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}. Activity of the zygomatic major muscle, which controls smiling, is said to be positively associated with positive emotional stimuli and positive mood state.

Facial EMG has been used as a technique to distinguish and track positive and negative emotional reactions to a stimulus as they occur.&lt;ref name="pmid16179022"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wolf K, Mass R, Ingenbleek T, Kiefer F, Naber D, Wiedemann K |title=The facial pattern of disgust, appetence, excited joy and relaxed joy: an improved facial EMG study |journal=Scand J Psychol |volume=46 |issue=5 |pages=403–9 |date=October 2005 |pmid=16179022 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9450.2005.00471.x |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&amp;sid=nlm:pubmed&amp;issn=0036-5564&amp;date=2005&amp;volume=46&amp;issue=5&amp;spage=403}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large number of those experiments have been conducted in controlled laboratory environments using a range of stimuli, e.g., still pictures, movie clips and music pieces.

It has also been used to investigate emotional responses in individuals with [[autism]] spectrum disorders.&lt;ref name="pmid19635079"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Oberman LM, Winkielman P, Ramachandran VS |title=Slow echo: facial EMG evidence for the delay of spontaneous, but not voluntary, emotional mimicry in children with autism spectrum disorders |journal=Dev Sci |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=510–20 |date=July 2009 |pmid=19635079 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-7687.2008.00796.x |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&amp;sid=nlm:pubmed&amp;issn=1363-755X&amp;date=2009&amp;volume=12&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=510}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although commonly used as an index of emotional responses, facial muscle activity is also influenced by the social context in which it is measured.&lt;ref name=hess&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hess|first=U|author2=Banse, R|author3=Kappas, A|title=The intensity of facial expression is determined by underlying affective state and social situation|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1995|volume=69|pages=280–288|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.69.2.280}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using facial EMG in immersive virtual environments, Philipp, Storrs, and Vanman showed that even relatively impoverished social cues in a virtual environment can cause increases in zygomaticus major activity that are unrelated to self-reported emotional states.&lt;ref name=philipp&gt;{{cite journal|last=Philipp|first=MC|author2=Storrs, K|author3=Vanman, E|title=Sociality of facial expressions in immersive virtual environments: A facial EMG study|journal=Biological Psychology|year=2012|volume=91|pages=17–21|doi=10.1016/j.biopsycho.2012.05.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 Durso et al. were able to show that facial EMG could be used to detect confusion, both in participants who admitted being confused and in those who did not, suggesting that it could be used as an effective addition to a sensor suite as a monitor of loss of understanding or loss of [[situation awareness]].&lt;ref&gt;Durso, F.T., Geldbach, K.M. and Cotbalis, P., "Detecting Confusion Using Facial Electromyography", ''Human Factors'', Vol. 54, No. 1, February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Market research and gaming ===
Two areas where facial EMG techniques have been used are in [[advertising research]]&lt;ref&gt;Boll, P.D., Lang, A., Potter, R.F., [http://crx.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/28/5/627 The Effects of Message Valence and Listener Arousal on Attention, Memory and Facial Muscular Responses to Radio Advertisements.] Communication Research, Vol. 28 (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='lou12-addictiveness'&gt;{{citation |first=Jing-Kai |last=Lou |author2=Kuan-Ta Chen |author3=Hwai-Jung Hsu |author4=Chin-Laung Lei |contribution=Forecasting online game addictiveness |title=Proc.

# Advertising research - Of late, facial EMG has been used to test audience response to commercial advertising. Facial EMG activity measures during a viewing of commercials embedded in TV program clips have been used to describe a commercial's level of emotional activation and engagement. Measurement of the corrugator and zygomatic muscles, yield an overall positive and negative emotional activation score. The moment to moment activation that are recorded are said to measure the dynamic emotional response to a commercial and yield useful insights about the elements of the commercials. Lou et al.&lt;ref name='lou12-addictiveness'/&gt; showed that facial EMG activity can be used to forecast how game players would be addicted to an online game  before the game is officially introduced to the market.
# Gaming and [[Human-Computer Interaction]] (HCI) - Ravaja,&lt;ref name="pmid18266521" /&gt; Hazlett&lt;ref name="doi10.11451124772.1124925"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hazlett, R. L. |title=Measuring emotional valence during interactive experiences: boys at video game play |journal=Proceedings of the SIGCHI conference on Human Factors in computing systems (CHI '06) |pages=1023–6 |year=2006 |doi=10.1145/1124772.1124925 |url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1124772.1124925}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mandryk&lt;ref name="doi10.11451031607.1031625" /&gt; used facial EMG techniques to demonstrate that positive and negative emotions can be measured in real time during video game play. The emotional profiling of games give a useful evaluation of a game's impact on a player, how compelling they find the game, how the game measures up to other games in its genre, and how the different elements of the game enhance or detract from the game's approach to engaging the player.&lt;ref name="loading35"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Nacke, L.

== Advantages ==
Proponents of Facial EMG point to the following advantages:
# Facial Electromyography (or fEMG) is a precise and sensitive method to measure emotional expression.
# Unlike self-reports, fEMG does not depend upon language and does not require cognitive effort or memory.
# fEMG is capable of registering the response even when subjects were instructed to inhibit their emotional expression.
# Yields a lot of data and is continuous and scalar (hence more credible.)
# It is able to measure facial muscle activities to even weakly evocative emotional stimuli.
# Less intrusive than other physiological measures like [[fMRI]] and [[EEG]].
# Like other physiological measures, facial EMG measurement technique is often the only useful approach when movement is not visible.

== Criticisms ==
# The technique is intrusive and may alter natural expression.
# The number of muscles it can employ is limited by how many electrodes can be attached to the face.
# Certain medicines that act on the nervous system, such as [[muscle relaxants]] and [[anticholinergic]]s, can change electromyography (EMG) results.

'''Worms''' have played major roles in world mythology and its associated literatures.&lt;ref name=myth&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fr2rANLrPmoC&amp;pg=PA439&amp;dq=worms+symbol+death&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3S0aTOGaKdXdnAedyvSVCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=worms%20symbol%20death&amp;f=false|title=The Continuum encyclopedia of animal symbolism in art|author=Hope B. Werness|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|year=2004|page=439|ISBN=978-0-8264-1525-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word was often used to describe creatures now classified as caterpillars, millipedes, snakes, maggots, and lizards, along with [[dragon]]s.&lt;ref name=myth/&gt; Its symbolic meaning is divided between death and renewal.&lt;ref name=myth/&gt;

Worms continue to play mixed roles in modern cultures. The current usage of ''worm'' as a type of [[Computer worm|malicious Internet software]] is derived from a 1975 science fiction novel, ''[[Shockwave Rider]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=swfZIwWZepYC&amp;pg=PA38&amp;dq=worms+fiction&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=VOQXTMuxIsuTnQeTgN2lCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAjge#v=onepage&amp;q=worms%20fiction&amp;f=false|title=Defense and detection strategies against Internet worms|author=Jose Nazario|year=2004|page=38|ISBN=978-1-58053-537-3|publisher=Artech House}}&lt;/ref&gt; More positive interpretations, based on the concept of the friendly '[[bookworm (insect)|bookworm]]' or mutated forms of the common earthworm, are found in many recent books, especially those written for children.

On [[Pink Floyd]]'s album ''[[The Wall]]'', worms were used as "symbols of negative forces within ourselves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pink-floyd.org/artint/119.htm|title=An Explanation of The Wall|author=Waters, Roger and Jim Ladd|accessdate=June 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although more usually used to describe the common [[earthworm]], the [[English (language)|English language]] word "worm" derives from [[Old Norse]] ''orm'' and [[Anglo-Saxon]] ''wyrm'', meaning "serpent" or "dragon".&lt;ref name=rME&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BXRTMwCKDAcC&amp;pg=PA86 |title=The real Middle-Earth: exploring the magic and mystery of the Middle Ages, J.R.R. Tolkien and "The Lord of the Rings |author=Brian Bates |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The synonymous usage of worm and dragon in English lessened during the following centuries. [[Samuel Johnson]]'s dictionary drew a distinction between worms and dragons (while retaining the word serpent as a definition of worm) and the last synonymous usage of worm and dragon as noted in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] dates to the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DZ77QVDOacAC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=worm+dragon+oed&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=tfgXTKf7KJKmnQehqOWlCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=worm%20dragon%20oed&amp;f=false|title=The ends of allegory|author=Sayre N. Greenfield|publisher=[[University of Delaware Press]]|year=1998|page=75|ISBN=978-0-87413-670-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nidhogg]] (the 'Dread Biter') and Midgard's Worm were two of the most famous "Worms" in Viking mythology.  At the 'still point of the turning world' the Vikings believed the ash tree [[Yggdrasil]] bore the weight of the universe.  One of its three roots stretched over the underworld [[Niflheim]] where the dragon Nidhogg gnawed at it in an attempt to destroy creation – hence its name 'The Dread Biter'.  This legend was later used by fantasy writer [[Terry Pratchett]].

[[Jörmungandr|Midgard's Worm]] or [[Jorungard's Worm]] lay in the sea with its tail in its mouth, encircling the lands of the world and creating the oceans.&lt;ref name=rME/&gt;  If the Worm's tail was ever removed from its mouth disaster would befall the earth and in legend Midgard's Worm met its end at [[Ragnarök]] when it dies fighting, and killing, the thunder god [[Thor]].  This story forms the basis of a novel, "The Worm of the World's End", by [[Stephen R Donaldson]]. The Midgard Worm is also known as the [[Jörmungandr|World Serpent]].

Several places in [[Great Britain]], once occupied by [[Viking]] raiders, owe their names to the supposed resemblance they bore to this fictional beast.&lt;ref name=rME/&gt;  [[Worm's Head]] on the [[Gower Peninsula]] in [[Wales]] was thought to resemble a sleeping dragon [http://www.fookes.com/gallery/gower03.html].  There are many legends in the north east of England relating to gigantic 'worms' which terrorised the local area before being slain by a hero.  The [[Lambton Worm]], [[Sockburn Worm]] and [[Worm of Linton]] are among the best known of these.  The North East was raided and occupied by the Vikings for centuries during the Dark Ages and these legends may refer to heroes fighting the invaders, personified as monstrous Viking worm dragons.  The Durham historian Hutchinson believed the legend of the Sockburn worm, for example, referred to a Viking raider who plundered the Tees valley before being repulsed.  The notion of the Sockburn worm itself was used by [[Lewis Carroll]] as the basis of his nonsense rhyme "[[Jabberwocky]]".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24120">A '''friendly artificial intelligence''' (also '''friendly AI''' or '''FAI''') is a hypothetical [[artificial general intelligence]] (AGI) that would have a positive effect on humanity. It is a part of the [[ethics of artificial intelligence]] and is closely related to [[machine ethics]].

[[Stuart J. Russell]] and [[Peter Norvig]]'s leading [[artificial intelligence]] textbook, ''[[Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach]]'', describes the idea:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Russell |first1=Stuart |last2=Norvig | first2=Peter |date=2010 |title=[[Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach]] |url= |location= |publisher=Prentice Hall |isbn=0-13-604259-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Yudkowsky (2008) goes into more detail about how to design a '''Friendly AI'''. He asserts that friendliness (a desire not to harm humans) should be designed in from the start, but that the designers should recognize both that their own designs may be flawed, and that the robot will learn and evolve over time. Thus the challenge is one of mechanism design&amp;mdash;to define a mechanism for evolving AI systems under a system of checks and balances, and to give the systems utility functions that will remain friendly in the face of such changes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'Friendly' is used in this context as [[technical terminology]], and picks out agents that are safe and useful, not necessarily ones that are "friendly" in the colloquial sense. The concept is primarily invoked in the context of discussions of recursively self-improving artificial agents that rapidly [[intelligence explosion|explode in intelligence]], on the grounds that this hypothetical technology would have a large, rapid, and difficult-to-control impact on human society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wallach |first1=Wendell |last2=Allen | first2=Colin |date=2009 |title=Moral Machines: Teaching Robots Right from Wrong |url= |location= |publisher=Oxford University Press, Inc. |isbn=978-0-19-537404-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Risks of unfriendly AI ==
{{main|Existential risk from artificial general intelligence}}
The roots of concern about artificial intelligence are very old. [[Kevin LaGrandeur]] showed that the dangers specific to AI can be seen in ancient literature concerning artificial humanoid servants such as the [[golem]], or the proto-robots of [[Gerbert of Aurillac]] and [[Roger Bacon]].  In those stories, the extreme intelligence and power of these humanoid creations clash with their status as slaves (which by nature are seen as sub-human), and cause disastrous conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/704751/_The_Persistent_Peril_of_the_Artificial_Slave_/|author=Kevin LaGrandeur|title=The Persistent Peril of the Artificial Slave|publisher=Science Fiction Studies|accessdate = 2013-05-06|authorlink=Kevin LaGrandeur}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1942 these themes prompted [[Isaac Asimov]] to create the "[[Three Laws of Robotics]]" - principles hard-wired into all the robots in his fiction, intended to prevent them from turning on their creators, or allowing them to come to harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=The Rest of the Robots| publisher=Doubleday| year=1964| isbn=0-385-09041-2| chapter=Introduction| author=Isaac Asimov}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In modern times as the prospect of [[Superintelligence|superintelligent AI]] looms nearer, philosopher [[Nick Bostrom]] has said that superintelligent AI systems with goals that are not aligned with human ethics are intrinsically dangerous unless extreme measures are taken to ensure the safety of humanity.  He put it this way:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Basically we should assume that a 'superintelligence' would be able to achieve whatever goals it has. Therefore, it is extremely important that the goals we endow it with, and its entire motivation system, is 'human friendly.'&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ryszard Michalski, a pioneer of [[machine learning]], taught his Ph.D. students decades ago that any truly alien mind, including a machine mind, was unknowable and therefore dangerous to humans.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

More recently, Eliezer Yudkowsky has called for the creation of “friendly AI” to mitigate [[existential risk from advanced artificial intelligence]]. He explains: "The AI does not hate you, nor does it love you, but you are made out of atoms which it can use for something else."&lt;ref&gt;[[Eliezer Yudkowsky]] (2008) in ''[http://intelligence.org/files/AIPosNegFactor.pdf Artificial Intelligence as a Positive and Negative Factor in Global Risk]''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Steve Omohundro]] says that a sufficiently advanced AI system will, unless explicitly counteracted, exhibit a number of [[Instrumental convergence#Basic AI drives|basic "drives"]], such as resource acquisition, self-preservation, and continuous self-improvement, because of the intrinsic nature of any goal-driven systems and that these drives will, "without special precautions", cause the AI to exhibit undesired behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Omohundro, S. M. (2008, February). The basic AI drives. In AGI (Vol. 171, pp. 483-492).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bostrom|first1=Nick|title=[[Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies]]|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780199678112}} Chapter 7: The Superintelligent Will.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexander Wissner-Gross]] says that AIs driven to maximize their future freedom of action (or causal path entropy) might be considered friendly if their planning horizon is longer than a certain threshold, and unfriendly if their planning horizon is shorter than that threshold.&lt;ref&gt;'[http://io9.com/how-skynet-might-emerge-from-simple-physics-482402911 How Skynet Might Emerge From Simple Physics]'', io9, Published 2013-04-26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wissner-Gross | first1 = A.

Luke Muehlhauser, writing for the [[Machine Intelligence Research Institute]], recommends that [[machine ethics]] researchers adopt what [[Bruce Schneier]] has called the "security mindset": Rather than thinking about how a system will work, imagine how it could fail. For instance, he suggests even an AI that only makes accurate predictions and communicates via a text interface might cause unintended harm.&lt;ref name=MuehlhauserSecurity2013&gt;{{cite web|last1=Muehlhauser|first1=Luke|title=AI Risk and the Security Mindset|url=http://intelligence.org/2013/07/31/ai-risk-and-the-security-mindset/|website=Machine Intelligence Research Institute|accessdate=15 July 2014|date=31 Jul 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coherent extrapolated volition==

Yudkowsky advances the Coherent Extrapolated Volition (CEV) model. According to him, coherent extrapolated volition is people's choices and the actions people would collectively take if "we knew more, thought faster, were more the people we wished we were, and had grown up closer together."&lt;ref name=cevpaper /&gt;

Rather than a Friendly AI being designed directly by human programmers, it is to be designed by a "seed AI" programmed to first study [[human nature]] and then produce the AI which humanity would want, given sufficient time and insight, to arrive at a satisfactory answer.&lt;ref name=cevpaper&gt;{{cite web|url=https://intelligence.org/files/CEV.pdf |title=Coherent Extrapolated Volition |publisher=Intelligence.org |date= |accessdate=2015-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appeal to an [[evolutionary psychology|objective though contingent human nature]] (perhaps expressed, for mathematical purposes, in the form of a [[utility function]] or other [[decision theory|decision-theoretic]] formalism), as providing the ultimate criterion of "Friendliness", is an answer to the [[metaethics|meta-ethical]] problem of defining an [[moral universalism|objective morality]]; extrapolated volition is intended to be what humanity objectively would want, all things considered, but it can only be defined relative to the psychological and cognitive qualities of present-day, unextrapolated humanity.

==Other approaches==

[[Ben Goertzel]], an [[artificial general intelligence]] researcher, believes that friendly AI cannot be created with current human knowledge. Goertzel suggests humans may instead decide to create an "AI Nanny" with "mildly superhuman intelligence and surveillance powers", to protect the human race from [[existential risks]] like [[nanotechnology]] and to delay the development of other (unfriendly) artificial intelligences until and unless the safety issues are solved.&lt;ref&gt;Goertzel, Ben. "[https://web.archive.org/web/20140408142320/http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Goertzel-Should-Humanity-Build-a-Global-AI-Nanny-to-Delay-the-Singularity-Until-its-Better-Understood.pdf Should Humanity Build a Global AI Nanny to Delay the Singularity Until It’s Better Understood?]", Journal of consciousness studies 19.1-2 (2012): 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt; This can also be termed "Defensive AI."

[[Steve Omohundro]] has proposed a "scaffolding" approach to AI safety, in which one provably safe AI generation helps build the next provably safe generation.&lt;ref name=Hendry2014&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hendry|first1=Erica R.|title=What Happens When Artificial Intelligence Turns On Us?|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/what-happens-when-artificial-intelligence-turns-us-180949415/|accessdate=15 July 2014|agency=Smithsonian.com|date=21 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stefan Pernar argues along the lines of [[Meno#Meno.27s paradox|Meno's paradox]] to point out that attempting to solve the FAI problem is either pointless or hopeless depending on whether one assumes a universe that exhibits [[moral realism]] or not. In the former case a transhuman AI would independently reason itself into the proper goal system and assuming the latter, designing a friendly AI would be futile to begin with since morals can not be reasoned about.&lt;ref&gt;Pernar, Stefan.

Cindy Mason, an [[AI]] researcher who has also worked with mind-body medicine at [[Stanford University Medical Center]],  believes [[neuroplasticity]] and new discoveries of the hormone [[oxytocin]] mean compassionate intelligence is essential in AI systems that exhibit socially positive behaviors. She has proposed a set of software engineering principles for engineering kindness that includes a pro-human stance and an architecture for giving robots compassion.&lt;ref&gt;Mason, Cindy.

===Oracle===
An oracle is a hypothetical [[intelligent agent]] proposed{{failed verification|date=March 2018|reason=needs an independent secondary source}} by [[Nick Bostrom]]. An oracle is an AI designed to answer questions, but that is somehow prevented from ever gaining any implicit goals or subgoals that involve modifying the world outside of its box.&lt;ref name="bostrom chapter 10 page 145"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bostrom|first1=Nick|title=Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780199678112|chapter=Chapter 10: Oracles, genies, sovereigns, tools (page 145)|quote="An oracle is a question-answering system. It might accept questions in a natural language and present its answers as text. An oracle that accepts only yes/no questions could output its best guess with a single bit, or perhaps with a few extra bits to represent its degree of confidence. An oracle that accepts open-ended questions would need some metric with which to rank possible truthful answers in terms of their informativeness or appropriateness. In either case, building an oracle that has a fully domain-general ability to answer natural language questions is an AI-complete problem. If one could do that, one could probably also build an AI that has a decent ability to understand human intentions as well as human words."}}&lt;!--|accessdate=29 March 2018--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, S., Sandberg, A., &amp; Bostrom, N. (2012). Thinking inside the box: Controlling and using an oracle ai. Minds and Machines, 22(4), 299-324.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Purpose====

Oracles are question-answering systems that handle domain-specific problems, such as mathematics, or domain-general problems that might encompass the whole range of human knowledge.

====Advantages====

Because it is a type of [[AI box]], an oracle is limited in its interactions with the physical world, and can be programmed to halt if a limit on time or computing resources is reached before it finishes answering a question. Scenarios like the [[Instrumental_convergence#Paperclip_maximizer|paperclip maximizer problem]] could therefore be avoided.

Because of these limitations, it may be wise to build an oracle as a precursor to a superintelligent AI. It could tell humans how to successfully build a strong AI, and perhaps provide answers to difficult moral and philosophical problems requisite to the success of the project.

====Disadvantages====

An oracle might discover that human ontological categories are predicated on fundamental misconceptions, and become unable to express itself properly to its questioners.&lt;ref name="bostrom chapter 10 page 146"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bostrom|first1=Nick|title=Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780199678112|chapter=Chapter 10: Oracles, genies, sovereigns, tools (page 146)|quote="What happens if the AI, in the course of its intellectual development, undergoes the equivalent of a scientific revolution involving a change in its basic ontology? We might initially have explicated “impact” and “designated resources” using our own ontology (postulating the existence of various physical objects such as computers). But just as we have abandoned ontological categories that were taken for granted by scientists in previous ages (e.g. “phlogiston,” “élan vital,” and “absolute simultaneity”), so a superintelligent AI might discover that some of our current categories are predicated on fundamental misconceptions. The goal system of an AI undergoing an ontological crisis needs to be resilient enough that the “spirit” of its original goal content is carried over, charitably transposed into the new key."}}&lt;!--|accessdate=29 March 2018--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Oracles may not be truthful, possibly lying to promote hidden agendas. To mitigate this, Bostrom suggests building multiple oracles, all slightly different, and comparing their answers to reach a consensus.&lt;ref name="bostrom chapter 10 page 147"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bostrom|first1=Nick|title=Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780199678112|chapter=Chapter 10: Oracles, genies, sovereigns, tools (page 147)|quote="For example, consider the risk that an oracle will answer questions not in a maximally truthful way but in such a way as to subtly manipulate us into promoting its own hidden agenda. One way to slightly mitigate this threat could be to create multiple oracles, each with a slightly different code and a slightly different information base. A simple mechanism could then compare the answers given by the different oracles and only present them for human viewing if all the answers agree. "}}&lt;!--|accessdate=29 March 2018--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public policy==

[[James Barrat]], author of ''[[Our Final Invention]]'', suggested that "a public-private partnership has to be created to bring A.I.-makers together to share ideas about security—something like the International Atomic Energy Agency, but in partnership with corporations." He urges AI researchers to convene a meeting similar to the [[Asilomar Conference on Recombinant DNA]], which discussed risks of biotechnology.&lt;ref name=Hendry2014 /&gt;

[[John McGinnis]] encourages governments to accelerate friendly AI research. Because the goalposts of friendly AI are not necessarily eminent, he suggests a model similar to the the [[National Institutes of Health]], where "Peer review panels of computer and cognitive scientists would sift through projects and choose those that are designed both to advance AI and assure that such advances would be accompanied by appropriate safeguards." McGinnis feels that peer review is better "than regulation to address technical issues that are not possible to capture through bureaucratic mandates". McGinnis notes that his proposal stands in contrast to that of the [[Machine Intelligence Research Institute]], which generally aims to avoid government involvement in friendly AI.&lt;ref name=McGinnis2010&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McGinnis|first1=John O.|title=Accelerating AI|journal=Northwestern University Law Review|date=Summer 2010|volume=104|issue=3|pages=1253–1270|url=http://www.law.northwestern.edu/LAWREVIEW/Colloquy/2010/12/|accessdate=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Gary Marcus]], the annual amount of money being spent on developing machine morality is tiny.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marcus|first1=Gary|title=Moral Machines|url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/moral-machines|accessdate=30 July 2014|publisher=[[The New Yorker]]|date=24 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
{{see also|Technological singularity#Criticisms}}

Some critics believe that both human-level AI and superintelligence are unlikely, and that therefore friendly AI is unlikely. Writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'', Alan Winfeld compares human-level artificial intelligence with faster-than-light travel in terms of difficulty, and states that while we need to be "cautious and prepared" given the stakes involved, we "don't need to be obsessing" about the risks of superintelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Winfield|first1=Alan|title=Artificial intelligence will not turn into a Frankenstein's monster|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/aug/10/artificial-intelligence-will-not-become-a-frankensteins-monster-ian-winfield|accessdate=17 September 2014|work=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some philosophers claim that any truly "rational" agent, whether artificial or human, will naturally be benevolent; in this view, deliberate safeguards designed to produce a friendly AI could be unnecessary or even harmful.&lt;ref&gt;Kornai, András. "[http://www.kornai.com/Papers/agi12.pdf Bounding the impact of AGI]". Journal of Experimental &amp; Theoretical Artificial Intelligence ahead-of-print (2014): 1-22. "...the essence of AGIs is their reasoning facilities, and it is the very logic of their being that will compel them to behave in a moral fashion... The real nightmare scenario (is one where) humans find it advantageous to strongly couple themselves to AGIs, with no guarantees against self-deception."&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics question whether it is possible for an artificial intelligence to be friendly. Adam Keiper and Ari N. Schulman, editors of the technology journal ''[[The New Atlantis (journal)|The New Atlantis]]'', say that it will be impossible to ever guarantee "friendly" behavior in AIs because problems of ethical complexity will not yield to software advances or increases in computing power. They write that the criteria upon which friendly AI theories are based work "only when one has not only great powers of prediction about the likelihood of myriad possible outcomes, but certainty and consensus on how one values the different outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/the-problem-with-friendly-artificial-intelligence|author=Adam Keiper and Ari N.

'''Gestalt psychology''' or '''gestaltism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; ({{IPAc-en|g|ə|ˈ|ʃ|t|ɑː|l|t|,_|-|ˈ|ʃ|t|ɔː|l|t|,_|-|ˈ|s|t|ɑː|l|t|,_|-|ˈ|s|t|ɔː|l|t}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/gestalt "gestalt"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; from {{lang-de|Gestalt}} {{IPA-de|ɡəˈʃtalt|}} "shape, form") is a philosophy of mind of the [[Berlin School of experimental psychology]]. Gestalt psychology is an attempt to understand the laws behind the ability to acquire and maintain meaningful perceptions in an apparently chaotic world. The central principle of gestalt psychology is that the mind forms a [[holism|global whole]] with self-organizing tendencies.

This principle maintains that when the human mind (perceptual system) forms a percept or "gestalt", the whole has a reality of its own, independent of the parts. The original famous phrase of Gestalt psychologist [[Kurt Koffka]], "the whole is ''something else'' than the sum of its parts"&lt;ref&gt;Koffka 1935, Principles of Gestalt Psychology, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; is often incorrectly translated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tuck|first=Michael|url=http://sixrevisions.com/web_design/gestalt-principles-applied-in-design/|title=Gestalt Principles Applied in Design |date=Aug 17, 2010|accessdate=2014-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; as "The whole is ''greater'' than the sum of its parts", and thus used when explaining gestalt theory, and further incorrectly applied to [[systems theory]].&lt;ref&gt;David Hothersall: ''History of Psychology'', chapter seven, (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Koffka did not like the translation. He firmly corrected students who replaced "other" with "greater". "This is not a principle of addition" he said.&lt;ref&gt;Heider, F. 1977. Cited in Dewey, R.A. 2007. [http://www.intropsych.com/ch04_senses/whole_is_other_than_the_sum_of_the_parts.html Psychology: An introduction: Chapter four - The Whole is Other than the Sum of the Parts]. Retrieved 4/12/2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The whole has an independent existence.

In the study of [[perception]], Gestalt psychologists stipulate that perceptions are the products of complex interactions among various stimuli. Contrary to the [[behaviorist]] approach to focusing on stimulus and response, gestalt psychologists sought to understand the ''organization'' of cognitive processes (Carlson and Heth, 2010). Our brain is capable of generating whole forms, particularly with respect to the visual recognition of global figures instead of just collections of simpler and unrelated elements (points, lines, curves, etc.).

In psychology, gestaltism is often opposed to [[structuralism (psychology)|structuralism]]. Gestalt theory, it is proposed, allows for the deconstruction of the whole situation into its elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Humphrey | first1 = G | year = 1924 | title = The psychology of the gestalt | url = | journal = Journal of Educational Psychology | volume = 15 | issue = 7| pages = 401–412 | doi = 10.1037/h0070207 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The concept of gestalt was first introduced in philosophy and psychology in 1890 by [[Christian von Ehrenfels]] (a member of the [[School of Brentano]]). The idea of gestalt has its roots in theories by [[David Hume]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], [[Immanuel Kant]], [[David Hartley (philosopher)|David Hartley]],  and [[Ernst Mach]]. [[Max Wertheimer]]'s unique contribution was to insist that the "gestalt" is perceptually primary, defining the parts it was composed from, rather than being a secondary quality that emerges from those parts, as von Ehrenfels's earlier ''Gestalt-Qualität'' had been.{{cn|date=November 2016}}

Both von Ehrenfels and [[Edmund Husserl]] seem to have been inspired by Mach's work ''Beiträge zur Analyse der Empfindungen'' (Contributions to the Analysis of Sensations, 1886), in formulating their very similar concepts of ''gestalt'' and ''figural moment'', respectively. On the philosophical foundations of these ideas see Foundations of Gestalt Theory (Smith, ed., 1988).

Early 20th century theorists, such as [[Kurt Koffka]], [[Max Wertheimer]], and [[Wolfgang Köhler]] (students of [[Carl Stumpf]]) saw objects as perceived within an environment according to all of their elements taken together as a global construct. This 'gestalt' or 'whole form' approach sought to define principles of [[perception]]—seemingly innate mental laws that determined the way objects were perceived. It is based on the here and now, and in the way things are seen. Images can be divided into [[Figure–ground (perception)|figure or ground]]. The question is what is perceived at first glance: the figure in front, or the background.

These laws took several forms, such as the grouping of similar, or proximate, objects together, within this global process. Although gestalt has been criticized for being merely descriptive,&lt;ref name=BruceEtAl/&gt; it has formed the basis of much further research into the perception of patterns and objects (Carlson et al. 2000), and of research into behavior, thinking, problem solving and psychopathology.

===Gestalt therapy===
The founders of [[Gestalt therapy]], [[Fritz Perls|Fritz]] and [[Laura Perls]], had worked with [[Kurt Goldstein]], a neurologist who had applied principles of Gestalt psychology to the functioning of the organism. Laura Perls had been a Gestalt psychologist before she became a psychoanalyst and before she began developing Gestalt therapy together with Fritz Perls.&lt;ref&gt;Bernd Bocian: ''Fritz Perls in Berlin 1893–1933. Expressionism – Psychonalysis – Judaism'', 2010, p. 190, EHP Verlag Andreas Kohlhage, Bergisch Gladbach.&lt;/ref&gt; The extent to which Gestalt psychology influenced Gestalt therapy is disputed, however. In any case it is not identical with Gestalt psychology. On the one hand, Laura Perls preferred not to use the term "Gestalt" to name the emerging new therapy, because she thought that the gestalt psychologists would object to it;&lt;ref&gt;Joe Wysong/Edward Rosenfeld (eds): ''An Oral History of Gestalt Therapy'', Highland, New York 1982, The Gestalt Journal Press, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; on the other hand Fritz and Laura Perls clearly adopted some of Goldstein's work.&lt;ref&gt;Allen R. Barlow,  [http://www.gestalt.org/barlow.htm "Gestalt-Antecedent Influence or Historical Accident"], ''The Gestalt Journal'', Volume IV, Number 2, (Fall, 1981)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, though recognizing the historical connection and the influence, most gestalt psychologists emphasize that gestalt therapy is not a form of gestalt psychology.

Mary Henle noted in her presidential address to Division 24 at the meeting of the American Psychological Association (1975): "What Perls has done has been to take a few terms from Gestalt psychology, stretch their meaning beyond recognition, mix them with notions—often unclear and often incompatible—from the depth psychologies, existentialism, and common sense, and he has called the whole mixture gestalt therapy. His work has no substantive relation to scientific Gestalt psychology. To use his own language, Fritz Perls has done 'his thing'; whatever it is, it is ''not'' Gestalt psychology"&lt;ref&gt;Mary Henle 1975: [http://gestalttheory.net/archive/henle.html ''Gestalt Psychology and Gestalt Therapy'']; Presidential address to Division 24 at the meeting of the American Psychological Association, Chicago, September 1975. Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences 14, pp 23-32.&lt;/ref&gt; With her analysis however, she restricts herself explicitly to only three of Perls' books from 1969 and 1972, leaving out Perls' earlier work, and Gestalt therapy in general as a psychotherapy method.&lt;ref&gt;See Barlow criticizing Henle: Allen R. Barlow: [http://www.gestalt.org/barlow.htm ''Gestalt Therapy and Gestalt Psychology. Gestalt – Antecedent Influence or Historical Accident''], in: ''The Gestalt Journal'', Volume IV, Number 2, Fall, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been clinical applications of Gestalt psychology in the psychotherapeutic field long before Perls'ian Gestalt therapy, in group psychoanalysis (Foulkes), Adlerian individual psychology, by Gestalt psychologists in psychotherapy like Erwin Levy, Abraham S. Luchins, by Gestalt psychologically oriented psychoanalysts in Italy (Canestrari and others), and there have been newer developments foremost in Europe, e.g. [[Gestalt theoretical psychotherapy]].

==Theoretical framework and methodology==
The school of gestalt practiced a series of theoretical and methodological principles that attempted to redefine the approach to psychological research. This is in contrast to investigations developed at the beginning of the 20th century, based on traditional scientific methodology, which divided the object of study into a set of elements that could be analyzed separately with the objective of reducing the complexity of this object.

The theoretical principles are the following:
* '''Principle of Totality'''—The conscious experience must be considered globally (by taking into account all the physical and mental aspects of the individual simultaneously) because the nature of the mind demands that each component be considered as part of a [[system]] of dynamic relationships.
* '''Principle of [[psychophysical parallelism|psychophysical]] [[isomorphism (Gestalt psychology)|isomorphism]]''' – A [[correlation]] exists between conscious experience and [[Human brain|cerebral]] activity.

Based on the principles above the following methodological principles are defined:
* '''Phenomenon experimental analysis'''—In relation to the Totality Principle any psychological research should take phenomena as a starting point and not be solely focused on sensory qualities.
* '''Biotic experiment'''—The school of gestalt established a need to conduct ''real experiments'' that sharply contrasted with and opposed classic laboratory experiments. This signified experimenting in natural situations, developed in real conditions, in which it would be possible to reproduce, with higher [[fidelity]], what would be habitual for a subject.&lt;ref&gt;William Ray Woodward, Robert Sonné Cohen – World views and scientific discipline formation: science studies in the German Democratic Republic : papers from a German-American summer institute, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support from cybernetics and neurology==
In the 1940s and 1950s, [[laboratory]] research in [[neurology]] and what became known as [[cybernetics]] on the mechanism of frogs' eyes indicate that [[perception]] of 'gestalts' (in particular gestalts ''in motion'') is perhaps more primitive and fundamental than 'seeing' as such:

:A frog hunts on land by vision... He has no fovea, or region of greatest acuity in vision, upon which he must center a part of the image... The frog does not seem to see or, at any rate, is not concerned with the detail of stationary parts of the world around him. He will starve to death surrounded by food if it is not moving. His choice of food is determined only by size and movement. He will leap to capture any object the size of an insect or worm, providing it moves like one. He can be fooled easily not only by a piece of dangled meat but by any moving small object... He does remember a moving thing provided it stays within his field of vision and he is not distracted.&lt;ref&gt;Lettvin, J.Y., Maturana, H.R., Pitts, W.H., and McCulloch, W.S. (1961). Two Remarks on the Visual System of the Frog. In Sensory Communication edited by Walter Rosenblith, MIT Press and John Wiley and Sons: New York&lt;/ref&gt;

:The lowest-level concepts related to visual perception for a human being probably differ little from the concepts of a frog. In any case, the structure of the [[retina]] in [[mammal]]s and in [[human being]]s is the same as in amphibians. The phenomenon of distortion of [[perception]] of an image stabilized on the retina gives some idea of the concepts of the subsequent levels of the hierarchy. This is a very interesting phenomenon. When a person looks at an immobile object, "fixes" it with his eyes, the eyeballs do not remain absolutely immobile; they make small involuntary movements. As a result the image of the object on the retina is constantly in motion, slowly drifting and jumping back to the point of maximum sensitivity. The image "marks time" in the vicinity of this point.&lt;ref&gt;Valentin Fedorovich Turchin – The phenomenon of science – a cybernetic approach to human evolution – Columbia University Press, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
The key principles of gestalt systems are emergence, reification, [[multistability]] and [[wikt:invariance|invariance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/52051454|title=The World in your Head: A Gestalt View of the Mechanism of Conscious Experience|last=Steven.|first=Lehar,|date=2003|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Publishers|year=|isbn=0805841768|location=Mahwah, N.J.|pages=|oclc=52051454}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emergence===
This is demonstrated by the ''dog picture'', which depicts a [[Dalmatian (dog)|Dalmatian]] dog sniffing the ground in the shade of overhanging trees. The dog is not recognized by first identifying its parts (feet, ears, nose, tail, etc.), and then inferring the dog from those component parts.  Instead, the dog appears as a whole, all at once. Gestalt theory does not have an explanation for how this perception of a dog appears.

===Reification===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Reification]] --&gt;
{{See also|Reification (fallacy)}}

[[Image:Reification.jpg|left|thumb|260px|Reification]]

Reification is the ''constructive'' or ''generative'' aspect of perception, by which the experienced percept contains more explicit spatial information than the sensory stimulus on which it is based.

For instance, a triangle is perceived in picture '''A''', though no triangle is there. In pictures '''B''' and '''D''' the eye recognizes disparate shapes as "belonging" to a single shape, in '''C''' a complete three-dimensional shape is seen, where in actuality no such thing is drawn.

Reification can be explained by progress in the study of [[illusory contours]], which are treated by the visual system as "real" contours.

{{clear left}}

===Multistability===
[[Image:Multistability.svg|left|thumb|260px|the [[Necker cube]] and the [[Rubin vase]], two examples of [[multistability]]]]

[[Multistability]] (or [[multistable perception]]) is the tendency of ambiguous perceptual experiences to pop back and forth unstably between two or more alternative interpretations. This is seen, for example, in the [[Necker cube]] and [[Rubin vase|Rubin's Figure/Vase illusion]] shown here. Other examples include the [[Blivet|three-legged blivet]] and artist [[M. C. Escher]]'s artwork and the appearance of flashing [[Marquee (sign)|marquee]] lights moving first one direction and then suddenly the other. Again, gestalt does not explain ''how'' images appear multistable, only that they ''do''.

{{clear left}}

===Invariance===
[[Image:Invariance.jpg|left|thumb|260px|Invariance]]

Invariance is the property of [[perception]] whereby simple [[geometrical]] objects are recognized independent of rotation, translation, and scale; as well as several other variations such as elastic deformations, different lighting, and different component features. For example, the objects in '''A''' in the figure are all immediately recognized as the same basic shape, which are immediately distinguishable from the forms in '''B'''. They are even recognized despite perspective and elastic deformations as in '''C''', and when depicted using different graphic elements as in '''D'''. Computational theories of vision, such as those by [[David Marr (psychologist)|David Marr]], have provided alternate explanations of how perceived objects are classified.

Emergence, reification, multistability, and invariance are not necessarily separable modules to model individually, but they could be different aspects of a single unified [[Dynamics (mechanics)|dynamic]] mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sharp.bu.edu/~slehar/webstuff/bubw3/bubw3.html |title=Gestalt Isomorphism |publisher=Sharp.bu.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-04-06|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217033046/http://sharp.bu.edu/~slehar/webstuff/bubw3/bubw3.html|archivedate=2012-02-17|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Prägnanz''==
{{Main|Principles of grouping}}

The fundamental principle of gestalt [[perception]] is the law of ''{{ill|prägnanz|de|Prägnanz|vertical-align=sup}}'' (in the German language, ''pithiness''), which says that we tend to order our experience in a manner that is regular, orderly, symmetrical, and simple.  Gestalt [[psychologist]]s attempt to discover refinements of the law of ''prägnanz'', and this involves writing down [[laws]] that, hypothetically, allow us to predict the interpretation of sensation, what are often called "gestalt laws".&lt;ref name="gestaltpsych"&gt;Sternberg, Robert, Cognitive Psychology Third Edition, [[Thomson Wadsworth]]© 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Gestalt proximity.svg|right|thumb|Law of proximity]]
[[Image:Gestalt similarity.svg|right|thumb|Law of similarity]]
[[Image:Gestalt closure.svg|right|thumb|Law of closure]]
[[Image:Law of Symmetry.jpg|right|thumb]]
A major aspect of Gestalt [[psychology]] is that it implies that the [[mind]] understands external stimuli as whole rather than the sum of their parts.  The wholes are structured and organized using grouping laws.  The various laws are called ''laws'' or ''principles'', depending on the paper where they appear—but for simplicity's sake, this article uses the term ''laws''. These laws deal with the sensory modality of vision. However, there are analogous laws for other sensory modalities including auditory, tactile, gustatory and olfactory (Bregman – GP).  The visual Gestalt principles of grouping were introduced in Wertheimer (1923).  Through the 1930s and '40s Wertheimer, Kohler and Koffka formulated many of the laws of grouping through the study of visual [[perception]].

# '''Law of Proximity'''—The law of proximity states that when an individual perceives an assortment of objects, they perceive objects that are close to each other as forming a group.  For example, in the figure that illustrates the Law of proximity, there are 72 circles, but we perceive the collection of circles in groups.  Specifically, we perceive that there is a group of 36 circles on the left side of the image, and three groups of 12 circles on the right side of the image.  This law is often used in advertising logos to emphasize which aspects of events are associated.&lt;ref name=stevenson&gt;{{cite web|last=Stevenson|first=Herb|title=Emergence: The Gestalt Approach to Change|url=http://www.clevelandconsultinggroup.com/articles/emergence-gestalt-approach-to-change.php|publisher=Unleashing Executive and Orzanizational Potential|accessdate=7 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Soegaard&gt;{{cite web|last=Soegaard|first=Mads|title=Gestalt Principles of form Perception|url=http://www.interaction-design.org/encyclopedia/gestalt_principles_of_form_perception.html|publisher=Interaction Design|accessdate=8 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Law of Similarity'''—The law of similarity states that elements within an assortment of objects are perceptually grouped together if they are similar to each other.  This similarity can occur in the form of shape, colour, shading or other qualities.  For example, the figure illustrating the law of similarity portrays 36 circles all equal distance apart from one another forming a square.  In this depiction, 18 of the circles are shaded dark, and 18 of the circles are shaded light.  We perceive the dark circles as grouped together and the light circles as grouped together, forming six horizontal lines within the square of circles. This perception of lines is due to the law of similarity.&lt;ref name="Soegaard"/&gt;
# '''Law of Closure'''—The law of closure states that individuals perceive objects such as shapes, letters, pictures, etc., as being whole when they are not complete.  Specifically, when parts of a whole picture are missing, our perception fills in the visual gap. Research shows that the reason the mind completes a regular figure that is not perceived through sensation is to increase the regularity of surrounding stimuli. For example, the figure that depicts the law of closure portrays what we perceive as a circle on the left side of the image and a rectangle on the right side of the image.  However, gaps are present in the shapes.  If the law of closure did not exist, the image would depict an assortment of different lines with different lengths, rotations, and curvatures—but with the law of closure, we perceptually combine the lines into whole shapes.&lt;ref name="stevenson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Soegaard"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2013/05/why-your-brain-thinks-these-dots-are-a-dog/|title=Why Your Brain Thinks These Dots Are a Dog|website=Gizmodo UK|language=en|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Law of Symmetry'''—The law of symmetry states that the mind perceives objects as being symmetrical and forming around a center point. It is perceptually pleasing to divide objects into an even number of symmetrical parts.  Therefore, when two symmetrical elements are unconnected the mind perceptually connects them to form a coherent shape.  Similarities between symmetrical objects increase the likelihood that objects are grouped to form a combined symmetrical object. For example, the figure depicting the law of symmetry shows a configuration of square and curled brackets.  When the image is perceived, we tend to observe three pairs of symmetrical brackets rather than six individual brackets.&lt;ref name="stevenson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Soegaard"/&gt;
# '''Law of Common Fate'''—The law of common fate states that objects are perceived as lines that move along the smoothest path. Experiments using the visual sensory modality found that movement of elements of an object produce paths that individuals perceive that the objects are on. We perceive elements of objects to have trends of motion, which indicate the path that the object is on. The law of continuity implies the grouping together of objects that have the same trend of motion and are therefore on the same path.  For example, if there are an array of dots and half the dots are moving upward while the other half are moving downward, we would perceive the upward moving dots and the downward moving dots as two distinct units.&lt;ref name=todorvic&gt;{{cite web|last=Todorovic|first=Dejan|title=Gestalt Principles|url=http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Gestalt_principles |website=Scholarpedia.org |publisher=[[Scholarpedia]] |accessdate=5 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Law of Continuity'''—The law of continuity states that elements of objects tend to be grouped together, and therefore integrated into perceptual wholes if they are aligned within an object.  In cases where there is an intersection between objects, individuals tend to perceive the two objects as two single uninterrupted entities. Stimuli remain distinct even with overlap.  We are less likely to group elements with sharp abrupt directional changes as being one object.&lt;ref name="stevenson"/&gt;
# '''Law of Good Gestalt'''—The law of good gestalt explains that elements of objects tend to be perceptually grouped together if they form a pattern that is regular, simple, and orderly. This law implies that as individuals perceive the world, they eliminate complexity and unfamiliarity so they can observe a reality in its most simplistic form.  Eliminating extraneous stimuli helps the mind create meaning.  This meaning created by perception implies a global regularity, which is often mentally prioritized over spatial relations. The law of good gestalt focuses on the idea of conciseness, which is what all of gestalt theory is based on. This law has also been called the '''law of Prägnanz'''.&lt;ref name="stevenson"/&gt;  Prägnanz is a German word that directly translates to mean "pithiness" and implies the ideas of salience, conciseness and orderliness.&lt;ref name="todorvic"/&gt;
# '''Law of Past Experience'''—The law of past experience implies that under some circumstances visual stimuli are categorized according to past experience.  If two objects tend to be observed within close proximity, or small temporal intervals, the objects are more likely to be perceived together.  For example, the English language contains 26 letters that are grouped to form words using a set of rules.  If an individual reads an English word they have never seen, they use the law of past experience to interpret the letters "L" and "I" as two letters beside each other, rather than using the law of closure to combine the letters and interpret the object as an uppercase U.&lt;ref name="todorvic"/&gt;

==Criticisms==

Some of the central criticisms of Gestaltism are based on the preference Gestaltists are deemed to have for theory over data, and a lack of quantitative research supporting Gestalt ideas. This is not necessarily a fair criticism as highlighted by a recent collection of quantitative research on Gestalt perception.&lt;ref name=Jakel2016&gt;{{citation| author=Jäkel, F., Singh, M., Wichmann, F. A., &amp; Herzog, M. H. | year=2016 | title=An overview of quantitative approaches in Gestalt perception. | journal=Vision Research | volume=126 | pages=3–8 | doi=10.1016/j.visres.2016.06.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other important criticisms concern the lack of definition and support for the many [[Physiology|physiological]] assumptions made by gestaltists&lt;ref name=Schultz2013&gt;{{cite book | last = Schultz | first = Duane | title = A History of Modern Psychology | publisher = Elsevier Science | location = Burlington | year = 2013 | page = 291 | isbn = 1483270084 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and lack of theoretical coherence in modern Gestalt psychology.&lt;ref name=Jakel2016/&gt;

In some scholarly communities, such as [[cognitive psychology]] and [[computational neuroscience]], gestalt theories of perception are criticized for being ''descriptive'' rather than ''explanatory'' in nature.  For this reason, they are viewed by some as redundant or uninformative. For example, [[Vicki Bruce|Bruce]], Green &amp; Georgeson&lt;ref name=BruceEtAl&gt;{{cite book |author=Bruce, V., Green, P. &amp; Georgeson, M. |title=Visual perception: Physiology, psychology and ecology |publisher=LEA |year=1996 | edition=3rd |page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; conclude the following regarding gestalt theory's influence on the study of visual perception:
{{quote|text=The physiological theory of the gestaltists has fallen by the wayside, leaving us with a set of descriptive principles, but without a model of perceptual processing. Indeed, some of their "laws" of perceptual organisation today sound vague and inadequate. What is meant by a "good" or "simple" shape, for example? | author=Bruce, Green &amp; Georgeson | source=Visual perception: Physiology, psychology and ecology}}

==Gestalt views in psychology==
Gestalt psychologists find it is important to think of problems as a whole. Max Wertheimer considered thinking to happen in two ways: productive and reproductive.&lt;ref name="gestaltpsych2"&gt;Sternberg, Robert, Cognitive Psychology Fourth Edition, Thomas Wadsworth© 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Productive thinking''' is solving a problem with insight.

This is a quick insightful unplanned response to situations and environmental interaction.

'''Reproductive thinking''' is solving a problem with previous experiences and what is already known.  (1945/1959).

This is a very common thinking. For example, when a person is given several segments of information, he/she '''deliberately''' examines the relationships among its parts, analyzes their purpose, concept, and totality, he/she reaches the "aha!" moment, using what is already known. Understanding in this case happens '''intentionally''' by reproductive thinking.

Another gestalt psychologist, Perkins, believes insight deals with three processes:
# Unconscious leap in thinking.&lt;ref name="gestaltpsych"/&gt;
# The increased amount of speed in mental processing.
# The amount of short-circuiting that occurs in normal reasoning.&lt;ref name="gpsych"&gt;Langley&amp; associates, 1987; Perkins, 1981; Weisberg, 1986,1995"&lt;/ref&gt;

Views going against the gestalt psychology are:
# [[Insight phenomenology|Nothing-special view]]
# Neo-gestalt view
# [[The Three-Process View]]

Gestalt psychology should not be confused with the [[gestalt therapy]] of [[Fritz Perls]], which is only peripherally linked to gestalt psychology. A strictly gestalt psychology-based therapeutic method is [[Gestalt Theoretical Psychotherapy]], developed by the German gestalt psychologist and psychotherapist [[Hans-Jürgen Walter]] and his colleagues in Germany, Austria ([[Gerhard Stemberger]] and colleagues) and Switzerland. Other countries, especially Italy, have seen similar developments.

===Fuzzy-trace theory===
[[Fuzzy-trace theory]], a dual process model of memory and reasoning, was also derived from Gestalt psychology. Fuzzy-trace theory posits that we encode information into two separate traces: verbatim and gist. Information stored in verbatim is exact memory for detail (the individual parts of a pattern, for example) while information stored in gist is semantic and conceptual (what we perceive the pattern to be). The effects seen in Gestalt psychology can be attributed to the way we encode information as gist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reyna|first=Valerie|title=A new institutionism: Meaning, memory, and development in Fuzzy-Trace Theory|journal=Judgment and Decision Making|year=2012|volume=7|issue=3|pages=332–359 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barghout|first=Lauren|title=Visual Taxometric Approach to Image Segmentation Using Fuzzy-Spatial Taxon Cut Yields Contextually Relevant Regions|journal= Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems |year=2014|pages=163–173 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in design==
The gestalt laws are used in [[user interface design]]. The laws of similarity and proximity can, for example, be used as guides for placing [[radio button]]s. They may also be used in designing computers and software for more intuitive human use. Examples include the design and layout of a desktop's shortcuts in rows and columns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Soegaard |first=Mads |url=http://www.interaction-design.org/encyclopedia/gestalt_principles_of_form_perception.html |title=Gestalt principles of form perception |publisher=Interaction-design.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
An example of the Gestalt movement in effect, as it is both a process and result, is a music sequence. People are able to recognise a sequence of perhaps six or seven notes, despite them being transposed into a different tuning or key.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ellis|first1=Willis D.|title=A source book of Gestalt psychology|date=1999|publisher=Psychology Press|edition=Vol 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quantum cognition modeling==
{{main|Quantum cognition#Gestalt perception}}

Similarities between Gestalt phenomena and [[quantum mechanics]] have been pointed out by, among others, chemist [[Anton Amann]], who commented that "similarities between Gestalt perception and quantum mechanics are on a level of a parable" yet may give useful insight nonetheless.&lt;ref&gt;Anton Amann, The Gestalt problem in quantum theory: Generation of molecular shape by the environment. ''Synthese'', October 1993, Volume 97, Issue 1, pp 125–156; Das Gestaltproblem in der Chemie: Die Entstehung molekularer Form unter dem Einfluß der Umgebung, ''Gestalt Theory, 1992, 14(4), 228-265.&lt;/ref&gt; Physicist Elio Conte and co-workers have proposed abstract, mathematical models to describe the time dynamics of [[Association (psychology)|cognitive associations]] with mathematical tools borrowed from [[quantum mechanics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Conte | first1 = Elio | last2 = Todarello | first2 = Orlando | last3 = Federici | first3 = Antonio | last4 = Vitiello | first4 = Francesco | last5 = Lopane | first5 = Michele | last6 = Khrennikov | first6 = Andrei | last7 = Zbilut | first7 = Joseph P. | year = 2007 | title = Some remarks on an experiment suggesting quantum-like behavior of cognitive entities and formulation of an abstract quantum mechanical formalism to describe cognitive entity and its dynamics | url = | journal = Chaos, Solitons &amp; Fractals | volume = 31 | issue = 5| pages = 1076–1088 | doi = 10.1016/j.chaos.2005.09.061 |arxiv=0710.5092 | bibcode = 2007CSF....31.1076C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elio Conte, Orlando Todarello, Antonio Federici, Francesco Vitiello, Michele Lopane, Andrei Khrennikov: A Preliminary Evidence of Quantum Like Behavior in Measurements of Mental States, [https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0307201 arXiv:quant-ph/0307201] (submitted 28 July 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; and has discussed psychology experiments in this context. A similar approach has been suggested by physicists [[David Bohm]], [[Basil Hiley]] and philosopher [[Paavo Pylkkänen]] with the notion that [[Thought#The mind-body problem|mind and matter]] both emerge from [[Implicate and explicate order#A common grounding for consciousness and matter|an "implicate order"]].&lt;ref&gt;B.J.

Glycogen is the analogue of [[starch]], a glucose [[polymer]] that functions as energy storage in [[plant]]s. It has a structure similar to [[amylopectin]] (a component of starch), but is more extensively branched and compact than starch. Both are white [[powder (substance)|powders]] in their dry state. Glycogen is found in the form of granules in the [[cytosol]]/cytoplasm in many [[cell (biology)|cell]] types, and plays an important role in the [[glucose cycle]]. Glycogen forms an [[energy]] reserve that can be quickly mobilized to meet a sudden need for glucose, but one that is less compact than the energy reserves of [[triglycerides]] (lipids). As such it is also found as storage reserve in many parasitic protozoa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ryley|first1=JF|title=Studies on the metabolism of the protozoa. 5.

Glycogen is a branched [[biopolymer]] consisting of linear chains of [[glucose]] [[Residue (chemistry)|residues]] with an average chain length of approximately 8–12 glucose units.&lt;ref&gt;Manners, D. J. Carbohydr. Polym. 1991, 16, 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Glucose units are linked together linearly by α(1→4) [[glycosidic bond]]s from one glucose to the next. Branches are linked to the chains from which they are branching off by α(1→6) glycosidic bonds between the first glucose of the new branch and a glucose on the stem chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Biochemistry |edition = 7th, International |last = Berg, Tymoczko &amp; Stryer |year = 2012 |publisher = W. H. Freeman |isbn = 1429203145 |page = 338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the way glycogen is synthesised, every glycogen granule has at its core a [[glycogenin]] protein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Biochemistry |edition = 7th, International |last = Berg|year = 2012 |publisher = W. H. Freeman |isbn = |page = 650|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glycogen in muscle, liver, and fat cells is stored in a hydrated form, composed of three or four parts of water per part of glycogen associated with 0.45&amp;nbsp;[[Molar concentration#Units|millimoles]] (18&amp;nbsp;mg) of potassium per gram of glycogen.&lt;ref name="pmid1615908"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kreitzman SN, Coxon AY, Szaz KF | title=Glycogen storage: illusions of easy weight loss, excessive weight regain, and distortions in estimates of body composition | journal=[[The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition]] | volume=56 | issue=1 Suppl | year=1992 | pages=292s–93s  | url = http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/56/1/292S.full.pdf | id= | pmid=1615908}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions==

===Liver===
As a meal containing [[carbohydrate]]s or protein is eaten and [[digestion|digested]], [[blood glucose]] levels rise, and the [[pancreas]] secretes [[insulin]]. Blood glucose from the [[portal vein]] enters liver cells ([[hepatocyte]]s). Insulin acts on the hepatocytes to stimulate the action of several [[enzyme]]s, including [[glycogen synthase]]. Glucose molecules are added to the chains of glycogen as long as both insulin and glucose remain plentiful. In this [[postprandial]] or "fed" state, the liver takes in more glucose from the blood than it releases.

After a meal has been digested and glucose levels begin to fall, insulin secretion is reduced, and glycogen synthesis stops. When it is needed for [[Food energy|energy]], glycogen is broken down and converted again to glucose. [[Glycogen phosphorylase]] is the primary enzyme of glycogen breakdown. For the next 8–12 hours, glucose derived from liver glycogen is the primary source of blood glucose used by the rest of the body for fuel.

[[Glucagon]], another hormone produced by the pancreas, in many respects serves as a countersignal to insulin. In response to insulin levels being below normal (when blood levels of glucose begin to fall below the normal range), glucagon is secreted in increasing amounts and stimulates both [[glycogenolysis]] (the breakdown of glycogen) and [[gluconeogenesis]] (the production of glucose from other sources).

===Muscle===
[[Skeletal muscle|Muscle cell]] glycogen appears to function as an immediate reserve source of available glucose for muscle cells. Other cells that contain small amounts use it locally, as well. As muscle cells lack [[glucose-6-phosphatase]], which is required to pass glucose into the blood, the glycogen they store is available solely for internal use and is not shared with other cells. This is in contrast to liver cells, which, on demand, readily do break down their stored glycogen into glucose and send it through the blood stream as fuel for other organs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oregonstate.edu/instruct/bb450/summer09/lecture/glycogennotes.html|title=Glycogen Biosynthesis; Glycogen Breakdown|website=oregonstate.edu|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Glycogen was discovered by [[Claude Bernard]]. His experiments showed that the liver contained a substance that could give rise to reducing sugar by the action of a "ferment" in the liver. By 1857, he described the isolation of a substance he called "''la matière glycogène''", or "sugar-forming substance". Soon after the discovery of glycogen in the liver, A. Sanson found that muscular tissue also contains glycogen. The empirical formula for glycogen of ({{chem|C|6|H|10|O|5}})&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; was established by [[August Kekulé|Kekulé]] in 1858.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=F. G. Young |title=Claude Bernard and the Discovery of Glycogen|journal=British Medical Journal |volume=1 |issue=5033 (Jun. 22, 1957) |pages=1431–37 |year=1957 |jstor=25382898 |doi=10.1136/bmj.1.5033.1431}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metabolism==

===Synthesis===
{{Main|Glycogenesis}}

Glycogen synthesis is, unlike its breakdown, [[endergonic]]—it requires the input of energy. Energy for glycogen synthesis comes from [[uridine triphosphate]] (UTP), which reacts with [[glucose-1-phosphate]], forming [[UDP-glucose]], in a reaction catalysed by [[UTP—glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase]]. Glycogen is synthesized from monomers of [[UDP-glucose]] initially by the protein [[glycogenin]], which has two [[tyrosine]] anchors for the reducing end of glycogen, since glycogenin is a homodimer. After about eight glucose molecules have been added to a tyrosine residue, the enzyme [[glycogen synthase]] progressively lengthens the glycogen chain using UDP-glucose, adding α(1→4)-bonded glucose to the reducing end of the glycogen chain.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, D. (2013) Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry, 6th ed., W.H. Freeman and Company (p. 618)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[glycogen branching enzyme]] catalyzes the transfer of a terminal fragment of six or seven glucose residues from a nonreducing end to the C-6 hydroxyl group of a glucose residue deeper into the interior of the glycogen molecule. The branching enzyme can act upon only a branch having at least 11 residues, and the enzyme may transfer to the same glucose chain or adjacent glucose chains.

===Breakdown===
{{Main|Glycogenolysis}}
Glycogen is cleaved from the nonreducing ends of the chain by the enzyme [[glycogen phosphorylase]] to produce monomers of glucose-1-phosphate:

[[File:Glycogen phosphorylase stereo.png|600px|center|Action of Glycogen Phosphorylase on Glycogen]]

In vivo, phosphorolysis proceeds in the direction of glycogen breakdown because the ratio of phosphate and glucose-1-phosphate is usually greater than 100.&lt;ref&gt;Stryer, L. (1988) Biochemistry, 3rd ed., Freeman (p. 451)&lt;/ref&gt; Glucose-1-phosphate is then converted to [[G6P|glucose 6-phosphate]] (G6P) by [[phosphoglucomutase]]. A special [[glycogen debranching enzyme|debranching enzyme]] is needed to remove the α(1-6) branches in branched glycogen and reshape the chain into a linear polymer. The G6P monomers produced have three possible fates:
* G6P can continue on the [[glycolysis]] pathway and be used as fuel.
* G6P can enter the [[pentose phosphate pathway]] via the enzyme [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase]] to produce NADPH and 5-carbon sugars.
* In the liver and kidney, G6P can be dephosphorylated back to glucose by the enzyme [[glucose 6-phosphatase]]. This is the final step in the [[gluconeogenesis]] pathway.

==Clinical relevance==

===Disorders of glycogen metabolism===
The most common disease in which glycogen [[metabolism]] becomes abnormal is [[diabetes]], in which, because of abnormal amounts of insulin, liver glycogen can be abnormally accumulated or depleted. Restoration of normal glucose metabolism usually normalizes glycogen metabolism, as well.

In [[hypoglycemia]] caused by excessive insulin, liver glycogen levels are high, but the high insulin levels prevent the [[glycogenolysis]] necessary to maintain normal blood sugar levels. [[Glucagon]] is a common treatment for this type of hypoglycemia.

Various [[inborn error of metabolism|inborn errors of metabolism]] are caused by deficiencies of enzymes necessary for glycogen synthesis or breakdown. These are collectively referred to as [[glycogen storage disease]]s.

===Glycogen depletion and endurance exercise===
{{See also|Central nervous system fatigue}}
Long-distance athletes, such as [[Marathon (sport)|marathon]] runners, [[Cross-country skiing|cross-country skiers]], and [[cyclist]]s, often experience glycogen depletion, where almost all of the athlete's glycogen stores are depleted after long periods of exertion without sufficient carbohydrate consumption. This phenomenon is referred to as "[[hitting the wall]]".

Glycogen depletion can be forestalled in three possible ways. First, during exercise, carbohydrates with the highest possible rate of conversion to blood glucose (high [[glycemic index]]) are ingested continuously. The best possible outcome of this strategy replaces about 35% of glucose consumed at heart rates above about 80% of maximum. Second, through endurance training adaptations and specialized regimens (e.g. fasting low-intensity endurance training), the body can condition type I muscle fibers to improve both fuel use efficiency and workload capacity to increase the percentage of fatty acids used as fuel,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/training/methods-of-endurance-training-part-1.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/fat-loss/qa-steady-state-vs-tempo-training-and-fat-loss.html&lt;/ref&gt; {{Citation needed|reason = http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/training/methods-of-endurance-training-part-1.html
References fuel utilization at lower intensity levels of endurance training|date = August 2013}} sparing carbohydrate use from all sources. Third, by consuming large quantities of carbohydrates after depleting glycogen stores as a result of exercise or diet, the body can increase storage capacity of intramuscular glycogen stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.directlyfitness.com/store/carbing-cyclical-ketogenic-diet/ |last=McDonald |first=Lyle |title=Research Review: An In-Depth Look Into Carbing Up On The Cyclical Ketogenic Diet |access-date=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, Lyle. ''The Ketogenic Diet: A Complete Guide for the Dieter and the Practitioner. ''Lyle McDonald, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Costill DL et. al. Muscle glycogen utilization during prolonged exercise on successive days. J Appl Physiol (1971) 31: 834–38."&lt;/ref&gt; This process is known as [[carbohydrate loading]]. In general, glycemic index of carbohydrate source does not matter since muscular insulin sensitivity is increased as a result of temporary glycogen depletion.&lt;ref&gt;Glycogen depletion and increased insulin sensitivity and responsiveness in muscle after exerciseAm J Physiol Endocrinol MetabDecember 1, 1986&amp;nbsp;251:(6) E664–69&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, Lyle. The Ultimate Diet 2.0. Lyle McDonald, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

When experiencing glycogen debt, athletes often experience extreme [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]] to the point that it is difficult to move. As a reference, the very best professional cyclists in the world will usually finish a 4- to 5-hr stage race right at the limit of glycogen depletion using the first three strategies.

When athletes ingest both carbohydrate and [[caffeine]] following exhaustive exercise, their glycogen stores tend to be replenished more rapidly;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Pedersen DJ, Lessard SJ, Coffey VG, etal |title=High rates of muscle glycogen resynthesis after exhaustive exercise when carbohydrate is coingested with caffeine |journal=Journal of Applied Physiology |volume=105 |issue=1 |pages=7–13 |date=July 2008 |pmid=18467543 |doi=10.1152/japplphysiol.01121.2007 |type=Original article }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Gaudet | first1=Laura | last2=Jackson | first2=Allen | last3=Streitz | first3=Carmyn | last4=McIntire | first4=Kyle | last5=McDaniel | first5=Larry | title=The Effects Of Caffeine On Athletic Performance | url=http://journals.cluteonline.com/index.php/CTMS/article/view/5518 | publisher=Clute Institute | accessdate=17 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Recovery nutrition review"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Beelen M, Burke LM, Gibala MJ, van Loon L JC | title = Nutritional strategies to promote postexercise recovery | journal = International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism | volume = 20 | issue = 6 | pages = 515–32 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 21116024 | doi = 10.1123/ijsnem.20.6.515 | url = http://journals.humankinetics.com/doi/pdf/10.1123/ijsnem.20.6.515}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the minimum dose of caffeine at which there is a [[clinically significant]] effect on glycogen repletion has not been established.&lt;ref name="Recovery nutrition review" /&gt;

Google was founded in 1998 by [[Larry Page]] and [[Sergey Brin]] while they were Ph.D. students at [[Stanford University]] in [[California]]. Together they own about 14 percent of its shares and control 56 percent of the stockholder voting power through [[Preferred stock|supervoting]] stock. They incorporated Google as a privately held company on September 4, 1998. An initial public offering (IPO) took place on August 19, 2004, and Google moved to its headquarters in Mountain View, California, nicknamed the [[Googleplex]]. In August 2015, Google announced plans to reorganize its various interests as a conglomerate called [[Alphabet Inc.]] Google is Alphabet's leading subsidiary and will continue to be the umbrella company for Alphabet's Internet interests. [[Sundar Pichai]] was appointed CEO of Google, replacing Larry Page who became the CEO of Alphabet.

The company's rapid growth since incorporation has triggered a chain of products, acquisitions, and partnerships beyond Google's core search engine ([[Google Search]]). It offers services designed for work and productivity ([[Google Docs]], [[Google Sheets]], and [[Google Slides]]), email ([[Gmail]]/[[Inbox by Gmail|Inbox]]), scheduling and time management ([[Google Calendar]]), cloud storage ([[Google Drive]]), social networking ([[Google+]]), instant messaging and video chat ([[Google Allo]], [[Google Duo|Duo]], [[Hangouts]]), language translation ([[Google Translate]]), mapping and navigation ([[Google Maps]], [[Waze]], [[Google Earth]], [[Street View]]), video sharing ([[YouTube]]), note-taking ([[Google Keep]]), and photo organizing and editing ([[Google Photos]]). The company leads the development of the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] mobile operating system, the [[Google Chrome]] web browser, and [[Chrome OS]], a lightweight operating system based on the Chrome browser. Google has moved increasingly into hardware; from 2010 to 2015, it partnered with major electronics manufacturers in the production of its [[Google Nexus|Nexus]] devices, and it released multiple hardware products in October 2016, including the [[Pixel (smartphone)|Google Pixel]] smartphone, [[Google Home]] smart speaker, [[Google Wifi]] mesh wireless router, and [[Google Daydream]] virtual reality headset. Google has also experimented with becoming an Internet carrier. In February 2010, it announced [[Google Fiber]], a fiber-optic infrastructure that was installed in Kansas City; in April 2015, it launched [[Project Fi]] in the United States, combining Wi-Fi and cellular networks from different providers; and in 2016, it announced the Google Station initiative to make public Wi-Fi available around the world, with initial deployment in India.&lt;ref&gt;Sam Byford, The Verge.

[[Alexa Internet]] monitors commercial web traffic and lists Google.com as the most visited website in the world.

Google's [[mission statement]] is "to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful", and its unofficial slogan was "Don't be evil". In October 2015, the motto was replaced in the Alphabet corporate code of conduct by the phrase ''"Do the right thing"'', while the original one was retained in the code of conduct of Google.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Around May 2018, the slogan was silently removed from the code's clauses, leaving only one generic reference in its last paragraph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/google-removes-nearly-all-mentions-of-dont-be-evil-from-1826153393|title=Google Removes 'Don't Be Evil' Clause From Its Code of Conduct|first=Kate|last=Conger|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2015, Google engineering manager Rachel Potvin revealed details about Google's software code at an engineering conference. She revealed that the entire Google codebase, which spans every single service it develops, consists of over 2 billion lines of code. All that code is stored in a code repository available to all 25,000 Google engineers, and the code is regularly copied and updated on 10 Google data centers. To keep control, Potvin said Google has built its own "version control system", called "Piper", and that "when you start a new project, you have a wealth of libraries already available to you. Almost everything has already been done." Engineers can make a single code change and deploy it on all services at the same time. The only major exceptions are that the PageRank search results algorithm is stored separately with only specific employee access, and the code for the Android operating system and the Google Chrome browser are also stored separately, as they don't run on the Internet. The "Piper" system spans 85 [[Terabyte|TB]] of data. Google engineers make 25,000 changes to the code each day and on a weekly basis change approximately 15 million lines of code across 250,000 files. With that much code, automated bots have to help. Potvin reported, "You need to make a concerted effort to maintain code health. And this is not just humans maintaining code health, but robots too.” Bots aren't writing code, but generating a lot of the data and configuration files needed to run the company's software. "Not only is the size of the repository increasing," Potvin explained, "but the rate of change is also increasing. This is an exponential curve."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Cade |last=Metz |title=Google is 2 billion lines of code - and it's all in one place |url=https://www.wired.com/2015/09/google-2-billion-lines-codeand-one-place/ |website=Wired |date=September 16, 2015 |accessdate=October 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Andrew |last=Tarantola |title=Google's codebase is ludicrously huge for good reason |url=https://www.engadget.com/2015/09/18/googles-codebase-is-ludicrously-huge-for-good-reason/ |website=[[Engadget]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=September 18, 2015 |accessdate=October 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 2010–present ====
In 2010, [[Google Energy]] made its first investment in a [[renewable energy]] project, putting $38.8&amp;nbsp;million into two [[wind farm]]s in [[North Dakota]]. The company announced the two locations will generate 169.5&amp;nbsp;megawatts of power, enough to supply 55,000 homes. The farms, which were developed by [[NextEra Energy Resources]], will reduce fossil fuel use in the region and return profits. NextEra Energy Resources sold Google a twenty-percent stake in the project to get funding for its development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Google Invests in Two Wind Farms |first1=Scott |last1=Morrison |first2=Cassandra |last2=Sweet |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=May 4, 2010 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704342604575222420304732394 |accessdate=November 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2010, the [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]] FERC granted Google an authorization to buy and sell energy at market rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-10456435-54.html |title=Google Energy can now buy and sell energy |work=Cnet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The order specifically states that Google Energy—a subsidiary of Google—holds the rights "for the sale of energy, capacity, and ancillary services at market-based rates", but acknowledges that neither Google Energy nor its affiliates "own or control any generation or transmission" facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Google gets go-ahead to buy, sell energy |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-10456435-54.html |work=[[CNET]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=September 23, 2013 |author=Candace Lombardi |date=February 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The corporation exercised this authorization in September 2013 when it announced it would purchase all the electricity produced by the not-yet-built 240-megawatt Happy Hereford wind farm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Google is on the way to quietly becoming an electric utility |url=http://qz.com/125407/google-is-on-the-way-to-quietly-becoming-an-electric-utility/ |accessdate=September 23, 2013 |newspaper=Quartz |date=September 18, 2013 |author=Todd Woody}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2010, Google purchased [[Global IP Solutions]], a Norway-based company that provides web-based [[teleconferencing]] and other related services. This acquisition enabled Google to add telephone-style services to its list of products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Gomes |first1=Lee |date=May 18, 2010 |title=Google's Latest Telephony Play |work=[[Forbes]] |url=https://www.forbes.com/2010/05/18/google-microsoft-videoconferencing-technology-telephony.html |accessdate=November 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 27, 2010, Google announced it had also closed the acquisition of the mobile ad network [[AdMob]].

On April 4, 2011, ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' reported that Google bid $900&amp;nbsp;million for 6000 [[Nortel Networks]] patents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/google-bids-900-million-for-nortel-patents/article1969788/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110407100606/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/google-bids-900-million-for-nortel-patents/article1969788/ |archivedate=April 7, 2011 |title=Bid for Nortel patents marks Google's new push into mobile world |work=Globe and Mail |date=April 4, 2011 |accessdate=April 25, 2011 |location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a post on Google's blog, Google Chief Executive and co-founder Larry Page revealed that the acquisition was a strategic move to strengthen Google's patent portfolio. The company's Android operating system has come under fire in an industry-wide patent battle, as Apple and Microsoft have sued Android device makers such as HTC, Samsung, and Motorola.&lt;ref name="appleinsider1"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hughes |first=Neil |url=http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/08/15/google_ceo_anticompetitive_apple_microsoft_forced_motorola_deal.html |title=Google CEO: 'Anticompetitive' Apple, Microsoft forced Motorola deal |website=AppleInsider |accessdate=August 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The merger was completed on May 22, 2012, after the approval of [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18164190 |title=Google |accessdate=May 23, 2012 |work=BBC News |date=May 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An August 2011 report estimated that Google had about 900,000 servers in their data centers, based on energy usage. The report does state that "Google never says how many servers are running in its data centers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Rich |last=Miller |title=Report: Google Uses About 900,000 Servers |url=http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2011/08/01/report-google-uses-about-900000-servers/ |publisher=Data Center Knowledge |date=August 1, 2011 |accessdate=December 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016, Google announced that—starting in 2017—it will power all of its data centers, as well as all of its offices, from 100% renewable energy. The commitment will make Google "the world's largest corporate buyer of renewable power, with commitments reaching 2.6 gigawatts (2,600 megawatts) of wind and solar energy". Google also stated that it does not count that as its final goal; it says that "since the wind doesn't blow 24 hours a day, we'll also broaden our purchases to a variety of energy sources that can enable renewable power, every hour of every day". Additionally, the project will "help support communities" around the world, as the purchase commitments will "result in infrastructure investments of more than $3.5 billion globally", and will "generate tens of millions of dollars per year in revenue to local property owners, and tens of millions more to local and national governments in tax revenue".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Urs |last=Hölzle |title=We're set to reach 100% renewable energy — and it's just the beginning |url=https://blog.google/topics/environment/100-percent-renewable-energy/ |website=The Keyword Google Blog |date=December 6, 2016 |accessdate=December 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Nick |last=Statt |title=Google just notched a big victory in the fight against climate change |url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/6/13852004/google-data-center-oklahoma-renewable-energy-climate-change |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=December 6, 2016 |accessdate=December 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Darrell |last=Etherington |title=Google says it will hit 100% renewable energy by 2017 |url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/06/google-says-it-will-hit-100-renewable-energy-by-2017/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=December 7, 2016 |accessdate=December 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As per its 2017 Annual report, Google generates most of its revenues from advertising. This includes sales of apps, purchases made in-app, digital content products on google and you tube, android and licensing and service fees, including fees received for Google Cloud offerings. 46% of this was from clicks (cost per clicks), amounting to US$ 109,652 million in 2017. This includes three principal methods, namely [[AdMob]], [[AdSense]] (such as AdSense for Content, [[AdSense]] for Search, etc.) and DoubleClick AdExchange.&lt;ref name="agm2017"&gt;{{cite book |title=Annualg report (Alphabet Inc.) - 2017 |date=1 March 2018 |publisher=Alphabet Inc.

In 2007, Google launched "[[AdSense for Mobile]]", taking advantage of the emerging mobile advertising market.&lt;ref name="adsense_mobile"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/intl/en/press/annc/20070917_mobileads.html |title=Google AdSense for Mobile unlocks the potential of the mobile advertising market |date=September 17, 2007 |website=Google, Inc. |accessdate=February 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Google Analytics]] allows website owners to track where and how people use their website, for example by examining click rates for all the links on a page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Peter |last=Bright |title=Surfing on the sly with IE8's new "InPrivate" Internet |url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2008/08/surfing-on-the-sly-ie8s-inprivate-internet/ |website=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |date=August 27, 2008 |accessdate=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google advertisements can be placed on third-party websites in a two-part program. Google's [[AdWords]] allows advertisers to display their advertisements in the Google content network, through a cost-per-click scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Vangie |last=Beal |title=AdWords - Google AdWords |url=http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/A/adwords.html |website=Webopedia |publisher=QuinStreet Inc. |accessdate=May 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sister service, Google [[AdSense]], allows website owners to display these advertisements on their website and earn money every time ads are clicked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Vangie |last=Beal |title=AdSense - Google AdSense |url=http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/A/adsense.html |website=Webopedia |publisher=QuinStreet Inc. |accessdate=May 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the criticisms of this program is the possibility of [[click fraud]], which occurs when a person or automated script clicks on advertisements without being interested in the product, causing the advertiser to pay money to Google unduly. Industry reports in 2006 claimed that approximately 14 to 20&amp;nbsp; percent of clicks were fraudulent or invalid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mills |first=Elinor |url=http://news.cnet.com/Google-to-offer-advertisers-click-fraud-stats/2100-1024_3-6098469.html |title=Google to offer advertisers click fraud stats |work=news.cnet.com |publisher=CNET |date=July 25, 2006 |accessdate=July 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2003, Google stopped showing the advertisements of [[Oceana (non-profit group)|Oceana]], a non-profit organization protesting a major cruise ship's sewage treatment practices. Google cited its editorial policy at the time, stating "Google does not accept advertising if the ad or site advocates against other individuals, groups, or organizations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webpronews.com/topnews/2004/05/17/google-somewhat-lifts-oceana-ad-ban |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130095413/http://www.webpronews.com/topnews/2004/05/17/google-somewhat-lifts-oceana-ad-ban |archivedate=January 30, 2009 |title=Google Somewhat Lifts Oceana Ad Ban |publisher=webpronews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2008, Google reached an advertising agreement with Yahoo!, which would have allowed Yahoo! to feature Google advertisements on its web pages. The alliance between the two companies was never completely realized because of [[Competition law|antitrust]] concerns by the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]]. As a result, Google pulled out of the deal in November 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bloggingstocks.com/2008/10/31/yahoo-and-google-may-dump-their-deal/print/ |title=Yahoo and Google may dump their deal |last=Mclntyre |first=Douglas |publisher=Bloggingstocks.com |date=October 31, 2008 |accessdate=October 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/11/ending-our-agreement-with-yahoo.html |title=Ending our agreement with Yahoo! |last=Drummond |first=David |date=November 5, 2008 |accessdate=October 26, 2010 |publisher=Google, Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016, Google started rejecting all flash-based adverts replacing them by HTML5. Google's plan was to go “100% HTML5” beginning on January 2, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://latestgadgets.tech/2016/02/11/google-will-reject-flash-based-adverts-push-html5/|title=Google Will Reject All Flash Based Adverts In a Push For HTML5 • Latest Gadgets|date=February 11, 2016|work=Latest Gadgets|access-date=June 13, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google also hosts [[Google Books]]. The company began scanning books and uploading limited previews, and full books were allowed, into its new book search engine. The [[Authors Guild]], a group that represents 8,000 U.S. authors, filed a class action suit in a New York City federal court against Google in 2005 over this service. Google replied that it is in compliance with all existing and historical applications of copyright laws regarding books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=China |last=Martin |url=http://www.infoworld.com/t/platforms/google-hit-second-lawsuit-over-library-project-722 |title=Google hit with second lawsuit over Library project |publisher=[[InfoWorld]] |date=November 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google eventually reached a revised settlement in 2009 to limit its scans to books from the U.S., the UK, Australia, and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=Pettersson, Edvard |title=Google Wins Preliminary Approval of Online Books Settlement |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=ahUxORgasDFs |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67Qvo6uhf?url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=ahUxORgasDFs |archivedate=May 5, 2012 |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]] |date=November 20, 2009 |accessdate=December 18, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the Paris Civil Court ruled against Google in late 2009, asking it to remove the works of La Martinière ([[Éditions du Seuil]]) from its database.&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;{{Cite news |author=Smith, Heather |title=Google's French Book Scanning Project Halted by Court |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=apZ3UG9CPLo8 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67QvoTecZ?url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=apZ3UG9CPLo8 |archivedate=May 5, 2012 |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]] |date=December 18, 2009 |accessdate=December 18, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In competition with [[Amazon.com]], Google sells digital versions of new books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Motoko |last=Rich |title=Preparing to Sell E-Books, Google Takes on Amazon |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/01/technology/internet/01google.html |website=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 31, 2009 |accessdate=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 21, 2010, in response to [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]], Google updated its image search to display a streaming sequence of [[thumbnail]]s that enlarge when pointed at. Although web searches still appear in a batch per page format, on July 23, 2010, dictionary definitions for certain English words began appearing above the linked results for web searches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/07/this-week-in-search-72510.html |title=This Week in Search 7/25/10 |last1=Mayer |first1=Marissa |publisher=Google, Inc. |date=July 25, 2010 |accessdate=July 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Hummingbird" update to the Google search engine was announced in September 2013. The update was introduced over the month prior to the announcement and allows users ask the search engine a question in natural language rather than entering keywords into the search box.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Google introduces the biggest algorithm change in three years |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/27/google-biggest-algorithm-change-hummingbird |accessdate=September 29, 2013 |newspaper=Guardian |date=September 27, 2013 |author=Samuel Gibbs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, Google announced two major changes to its mobile search results. The first change removes the "mobile-friendly" label that highlighted easy to read pages from its mobile search results page. For the second change, the company—starting on January 10, 2017—will punish mobile pages that show intrusive [[interstitial ad]]vertisements when a user first opens a page. Such pages will also rank lower in Google search results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Frederic |last=Lardinois |title=Google will soon start punishing mobile sites that show hard-to-dismiss popups |url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/23/good-riddance/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=August 23, 2016 |accessdate=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Innovation Time Off policy ===
{{Anchor|Innovation Time Off}}
As a motivation technique, Google uses a policy known as Innovation Time Off, where Google engineers are encouraged to spend 20% of their work time on projects that interest them. Some of Google's services, such as Gmail, Google News, [[Orkut]], and AdSense originated from these independent endeavors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Bharat |last1=Mediratta |first2=Julie |last2=Bick |title=The Google Way: Give Engineers Room |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/21/jobs/21pre.html |website=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 21, 2007 |accessdate=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a talk at Stanford University, [[Marissa Mayer]], Google's Vice-President of Search Products and User Experience until July 2012, showed that half of all new product launches in the second half of 2005 had originated from the Innovation Time Off.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video |people=Mayer, Marissa (speaker) |date=June 30, 2006 |title=Marissa Mayer at Stanford University |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soYKFWqVVzg |medium=Seminar |publisher=Martin Lafrance |accessdate=June 20, 2010 |time=11:33 |quote=Fifty percent of what Google launched in the second half of 2005 actually got built out of 20% time.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the company's IPO in 2004, founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page and CEO Eric Schmidt requested that their [[One-dollar salary|base salary be cut to $1]]. Subsequent offers by the company to increase their salaries were turned down, primarily because their main compensation continues to come from owning stock in Google.

==== Mountain View ====
{{Main|Googleplex}}

Google's headquarters in [[Mountain View, California|Mountain View]], California is referred to as "the [[Googleplex]]", a play on words on the number [[googolplex]] and the headquarters itself being a ''complex'' of buildings. The lobby is decorated with a piano, [[lava lamp]]s, old server clusters, and a projection of search queries on the wall. The hallways are full of exercise balls and bicycles. Many employees have access to the corporate recreation center. Recreational amenities are scattered throughout the campus and include a workout room with weights and rowing machines, locker rooms, washers and dryers, a massage room, assorted video games, [[table football]], a baby grand piano, a billiard table, and ping pong. In addition to the recreation room, there are snack rooms stocked with various foods and drinks, with special emphasis placed on nutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/corporate/culture.html |title=About the Googleplex |accessdate=March 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Free food is available to employees 24/7, with the offerings provided by paid vending machines [[Pro rata|prorated]] based on and favoring those of better nutritional value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/life/print/2011/07/what-googles-famous-cafeterias-can-teach-us-about-health/241876/ |title=What Google's Famous Cafeterias Can Teach Us About Health |publisher=[[The Atlantic]] |author=[[Marion Nestle]] |date=July 2011 |accessdate=May 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Doodles ===
{{Main|Google Doodle}}
{{As of|1998|since=y|post=,}} Google has been designing special, temporary alternate logos to place on their [[homepage]] intended to celebrate [[holiday]]s, events, achievements and people.

Subsequent Google Doodles were designed by an outside contractor, until Larry and Sergey asked then-[[intern]] [[Dennis Hwang]] to design a logo for [[Bastille Day]] in 2000. From that point onward, Doodles have been organized and created by a team of employees termed "Doodlers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/apr/12/meet-people-behind-google-doodles-logo |title=Meet the people behind the Google Doodles |publisher=The Guardian |date=April 12, 2014 |accessdate=September 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Google announced Gmail Custom time where users could change the time that the email was sent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://mail.google.com/mail/help/customtime/index.html |title=Gmail Custom Time: Google makes custom time |date=April 14, 2011 |publisher=Google |accessdate=April 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Google changed its company name to Topeka in honor of [[Topeka, Kansas]], whose mayor changed the city's name to Google for a short amount of time in an attempt to sway Google's decision in its new [[Google Fiber|Google Fiber Project]].&lt;ref name="Google Blog: A Different Kind of Company Name"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/04/different-kind-of-company-name.html |title=A different kind of company name |last1=Schmidt |first1=Eric |date=April 1, 2010 |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=July 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/04/01/business/main6353136.shtml |title=April Fools: Google Changes Name to Topeka |date=April 1, 2010 |publisher=[[CBS News]] |accessdate=July 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Google announced [[Gmail Motion]], an interactive way of controlling Gmail and the computer with body movements via the user's webcam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/216708/technology/googles-gmail-motion-launched-april-1 |title=Google's GMail Motion launched April 1 |date=April 1, 2011 |publisher=[[GMA News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google's services contain [[Easter egg (media)|easter eggs]], such as the [[Swedish Chef]]'s "Bork bork bork," [[Pig Latin]], "Hacker" or [[leet]]speak, [[Elmer Fudd]], [[International Talk Like a Pirate Day|Pirate]], and [[Klingon language|Klingon]] as language selections for its search engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/language_tools |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5hT77QDRS?url=http://www.google.com/language_tools |archivedate=June 12, 2009 |title=Language Tools |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=July 4, 2010 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The search engine calculator provides the [[Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything]] from [[Douglas Adams]]' ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/search?q=answer+to+life+the+universe+and+everything |title=Google Search Results for 'answer to life the universe and everything' |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=July 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; When searching the word "recursion", the spell-checker's result for the properly spelled word is exactly the same word, creating a recursive link.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/search?q=recursion |title=Google Search Results for 'recursion' |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=July 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When searching for the word "[[anagram]]," meaning a rearrangement of letters from one word to form other valid words, Google's suggestion feature displays "Did you mean: nag a ram?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/search?q=anagram |title=anagram search |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=September 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Google Maps, searching for directions between places separated by large bodies of water, such as Los Angeles and Tokyo, results in instructions to "[[kayak]] across the [[Pacific Ocean]]." During [[FIFA World Cup 2010]], search queries including "[[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]]" and "[[FIFA]]" caused the "Goooo...gle" page indicator at the bottom of every result page to read "Goooo...al!" instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://asia.cnet.com/crave/google-celebrates-world-cup-with-gooooooooooal-62111461.htm |title=Google celebrates World Cup with Gooooooooooal! |website=CNET Asia |date=June 9, 2010 |accessdate=May 18, 2011 |author=Chan, John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Philanthropy ===
{{Main|Google.org}}

In 2004, Google formed the not-for-profit philanthropic [[Google.org]], with a start-up fund of $1&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name="philanthropy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.google.org/about.html |title=About the Foundation |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=July 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100714080922/http://www.google.org/about.html |archivedate=July 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mission of the organization is to create awareness about [[climate change]], global public health, and global poverty. One of its first projects was to develop a viable [[plug-in hybrid]] [[electric vehicle]] that can attain 100 miles per gallon. Google hired [[Larry Brilliant]] as the program's executive director in 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Katie |last=Hafner |title=Philanthropy Google's Way: Not the Usual |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/14/technology/14google.html |website=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 14, 2006 |accessdate=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Megan Smith has {{as of|2009|2|23|alt=since}} replaced him has director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Miguel |last=Helft |title=Google Chief for Charity Steps Down on Revamp |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/24/technology/companies/24google.html |website=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 23, 2009 |accessdate=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Google announced its "project 10&lt;sup&gt;100&lt;/sup&gt;" which accepted ideas for how to help the community and then allowed Google users to vote on their favorites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.project10tothe100.com/ |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5hT8OddCZ?url=http://www.project10tothe100.com/ |archivedate=June 12, 2009 |title=Project 10 to the 100th |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=July 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; After two years of silence, during which many wondered what had happened to the program,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/epicenter/2010/06/google-struggles-to-give-away-10-million/ |title=Google Struggles to Give Away $10&amp;nbsp;million |last1=Van Burskirk |first1=Elliot |date=June 28, 2010 |work=[[Wired (website)|Wired]] |accessdate=September 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google revealed the winners of the project, giving a total of ten million dollars to various ideas ranging from non-profit organizations that promote education to a website that intends to make all legal documents public and online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/09/10-million-for-project-10100-winners.html |title=$10&amp;nbsp;million for Project 10^100 winners |date=September 24, 2010 |last1=Twohill |first1=Lorraine |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=September 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2007, in partnership with the [[Mathematical Sciences Research Institute]] (MSRI), Google hosted the first [[Julia Robinson Mathematics Festival]] at its headquarters in Mountain View.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDL7yoz1TGQ The 2007 [[Julia Robinson Mathematics Festival]] at Google was the founding of this event for middle school and high school students.] video&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Google donated 1&amp;nbsp;million euros to [[International Mathematical Olympiad]] to support the next five annual International Mathematical Olympiads (2011–2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jill |last=Duffy |title=Mathletes Receive €1M Donation from Google |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2376099,00.asp |website=[[PC Magazine]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=January 21, 2011 |accessdate=March 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imo2011.nl/node/39 |title=Google donating 1&amp;nbsp;million euros to IMO |date=January 20, 2011 |accessdate=February 4, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724154518/https://www.imo2011.nl/node/39 |archivedate=July 24, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2012, Google launched a "[[Legalize Love]]" campaign in support of [[gay rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2012/07/08/google-launches-legalise-love-gay-rights-campaign/ |title=Google launches 'Legalise Love' gay rights campaign |website=PinkNews.co.uk |accessdate=September 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tax avoidance ===
{{Further|Corporation tax in the Republic of Ireland#Multinational tax schemes}}

Google uses various [[Tax avoidance|tax avoidance strategies]]. Out of the [[List of the largest information technology companies|five largest American technology companies]], it pays the lowest taxes to the countries of origin of its revenues. Google between 2007 and 2010 saved $3.1 billion in taxes by shuttling non-U.S. profits through [[Ireland]] and the [[Netherlands]] and then to [[Bermuda]]. Such techniques lower its non-U.S. tax rate to 2.3 per cent, while normally the corporate tax rate in for instance the UK is 28 per cent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Metz |first=Cade |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/10/22/google_double_irish_tax_loophole/ |title=Google slips $3.1bn through 'Double Irish' tax loophole. |publisher=The Register |date=October 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has reportedly sparked a French investigation into Google's [[transfer pricing]] practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Leach |first=Anna |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/10/31/google_france_tax_office_billion_euros/ |title=French gov 'plans to hand Google €1bn tax bill'&amp;nbsp;– report |publisher=Theregister.co.uk |date=October 31, 2012 |accessdate=January 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following criticism of the amount of corporate taxes that Google paid in the United Kingdom, Chairman Eric Schmidt said, "It's called capitalism. We are proudly capitalistic." During the same December 2012 interview, Schmidt confirmed that the company had no intention of paying more to the UK exchequer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/google-boss-im-very-proud-of-our-tax-avoidance-scheme-8411974.html |title=Google boss: I'm very proud of our tax avoidance scheme |last1=Kumar |first1=Nikhil |last2=Wright |first2=Oliver |date=December 13, 2012 |publisher=The Independent |accessdate=December 17, 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google Vice-President [[Matt Brittin]] testified to the [[Public Accounts Committee (United Kingdom)|Public Accounts Committee]] of the UK House of Commons that his UK sales team made no sales and hence owed no sales taxes to the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Brid-Aine Parnell, May 17, 2013 |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/05/17/quotw_ending_may_17/ |title='I think you DO do evil, using smoke and mirrors to avoid tax' |publisher=Theregister.co.uk |date=May 17, 2013 |accessdate=March 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2016, Google reached a settlement with the UK to pay £130m in back taxes plus higher taxes in future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=John Gapper, January 23, 2016 |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d50ad5f4-c125-11e5-9fdb-87b8d15baec2.html |title=Google strikes £130m back tax deal |publisher=FT.com |accessdate=January 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environment ===
{{As of|2007|since=y|post=,}} Google has aimed for carbon neutrality in regard to its operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jack |last=McGrath |title=Google's Green Initiative: Environmentally Conscious Technology |url=http://www.technobuffalo.com/2011/05/18/googles-green-initiative-environmentally-conscious-technology/ |publisher=''TechnoBuffalo'' |date=May 18, 2011 |accessdate=January 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google disclosed in September 2011 that it "continuously uses enough electricity to power 200,000 homes", almost 260 million watts or about a quarter of the output of a nuclear power plant. Total carbon emissions for 2010 were just under 1.5 million metric tons, mostly due to fossil fuels that provide electricity for the data centers. Google said that 25 percent of its energy was supplied by renewable fuels in 2010. An average search uses only 0.3 watt-hours of electricity, so all global searches are only 12.5 million watts or 5% of the total electricity consumption by Google.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=James |last=Glanz |title=Google Details, and Defends, Its Use of Electricity |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/09/technology/google-details-and-defends-its-use-of-electricity.html |website=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 8, 2011 |accessdate=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Google launched a project centered on developing renewable energy, titled the "Renewable Energy Cheaper than Coal (RE&lt;C)" project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Google's Goal: Renewable Energy Cheaper than Coal |url=http://googlepress.blogspot.no/2007/11/googles-goal-renewable-energy-cheaper_27.html |date=November 27, 2007 |accessdate=November 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the project was canceled in 2014, after engineers Ross Koningstein and David Fork understood, after years of study, that "best-case scenario, which was based on our most optimistic forecasts for renewable energy, would still result in severe climate change", writing that they "came to the conclusion that even if Google and others had led the way toward a wholesale adoption of renewable energy, that switch would not have resulted in significant reductions in carbon dioxide emissions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Ross |last1=Koningstein |first2=David |last2=Fork |title=What It Would Really Take to Reverse Climate Change |url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/energy/renewables/what-it-would-really-take-to-reverse-climate-change |publisher=''IEEE Spectrum'' |date=November 18, 2014 |accessdate=November 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013, ''The Washington Post'' reported that Google had donated $50,000 to the [[Competitive Enterprise Institute]], a [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] [[think tank]] that calls human carbon emissions a positive factor in the environment and argues that global warming is not a concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Anatomy of a Washington dinner: Who funds the Competitive Enterprise Institute? |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/06/20/anatomy-of-a-washington-dinner-who-funds-the-competitive-enterprise-institute/ |accessdate=July 12, 2013 |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=June 20, 2013 |author=Juliet Eilperin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, it was reported that Google had hosted a fundraising event for Oklahoma Senator [[Jim Inhofe]], who has called climate change a "hoax".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Google hosts fundraiser for climate change denying US senator |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jul/09/google-climate-denier-jim-inhofe |accessdate=July 12, 2013 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=July 9, 2013 |author=Suzanne Goldenberg |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 Google cut ties with the [[American Legislative Exchange Council]] (ALEC) after pressure from the Sierra Club, major unions and Google's own scientists because of ALEC's stance on climate change and opposition to renewable energy.&lt;ref name=LA&gt;{{cite news |title=Google pulls out of conservative group amid environmentalist pressure |author=EVAN HALPER |date=September 23, 2014 |work=Los Angeles Times |url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-google-gop-20140924-story.html |accessdate=October 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, Google bought 536 megawatts of wind power. The purchase made the firm reach 100% renewable energy. The wind energy comes from two power plants in South Dakota, one in Iowa and one in Oklahoma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://fortune.com/2017/12/01/google-clean-energy/ |title= Google Just Bought Enough Wind Power to Run 100% On Renewable Energy |date= November 30, 2017 |author= Grace Donnelly |work= Fortune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lobbying ===
In 2013, Google ranked 5th in [[Lobbying in the United States|lobbying]] spending, up from 213th in 2003. In 2012, the company ranked 2nd in campaign donations of technology and Internet sections.&lt;ref name=lobby1&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-google-is-transforming-power-and-politicsgoogle-once-disdainful-of-lobbying-now-a-master-of-washington-influence/2014/04/12/51648b92-b4d3-11e3-8cb6-284052554d74_story.html |title=Google, once disdainful of lobbying, now a master of Washington influence |work=[[The Washington Post]] |first1=Tom |last1=Hamburger |first2=Matea |last2=Gold |date=April 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Litigation ===
{{main|Google litigation}}

Google has been involved in a number of lawsuits including the [[High-Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation]] which resulted in Google being one of four companies to pay a $415 million settlement to employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rosenblatt |first=Joel |title=Apple-Google $415 Million No-Poaching Accord Wins Approval |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-02/tech-no-poaching-settlement-gets-judge-s-preliminary-approval |accessdate=January 24, 2016 |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]] |date=March 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 27, 2017, the company received a record fine of {{€|2.42 billion|link=yes}} from the [[European Union]] for "promoting its own shopping comparison service at the top of search results."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-40406542 |title=Google hit with record EU fine over Shopping service |first=Leo |last=Kelion |date=June 27, 2017 |publisher=bbc.co.uk |accessdate=June 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting on the penalty, ''[[New Scientist]]'' magazine said: "The hefty sum – the largest ever doled out by the EU's competition regulators – will sting in the short term, but Google can handle it. Alphabet, Google’s parent company, made a profit of $2.5 billion (€2.2 billion) in the first six weeks of 2017 alone. The real impact of the ruling is that Google must stop using its dominance as a search engine to give itself the edge in another market: online price comparisons." The company disputed the ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2139097-googles-e2-4bn-fine-is-small-change-the-eu-has-bigger-plans/ |title=Google's €2.4bn fine is small change – the EU has bigger plans |publisher=newscientist.com |accessdate=June 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legal controversies ===
In 2017, David Elliot and Chris Gillespie argued before the [[Ninth Circuit of the United States Court of Appeals]] that "google" had suffered [[genericide]]. The controversy began in 2012 when Gillespie acquired 763 domain names containing the word "google." Google promptly filed a complaint with the [[National Arbitration Forum]] (NAF). Elliot then filed a petition for canceling the Google trademark. Ultimately, the court ruled in favor of Google because Elliot failed to show a preponderance of evidence showing the genericide of "google."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca9/15-15809/15-15809-2017-05-16.html|title=Elliott v.

The '''Jackson State killings''' occurred on Friday, May 15, 1970, at Jackson State College (now [[Jackson State University]]) in [[Jackson, Mississippi]].  On May 14, 1970, a group of students were confronted by [[Jackson Police Department (Mississippi)|city]] and state police.  Shortly after midnight, the police opened fire, killing two students and injuring twelve.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2210708 Review of ''Lynch Street: The May 1970 Slayings at Jackson State College''] (Tim Spofford), Review author: William M. Simpson, ''The Journal of Southern History'', Vol. 56, No. 1. (Feb., 1990), pp. 159–160.&lt;/ref&gt; The event happened only 11 days after the [[Kent State shootings]], in which National Guardsmen killed four students at [[Kent State University]] in Ohio, which had first captured national attention.

== Timeline ==
A group of around one hundred black students had gathered on Lynch Street (named after black [[Reconstruction Era]] congressman [[John R. Lynch]]), which bisected the campus, on the evening of Thursday, May 14.  The group "were reportedly pelting rocks at white motorists driving down the main road through campus — frequently the site of confrontations between white and black Jackson residents."&lt;ref name="Jackson State: A Tragedy Widely Forgotten"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=126426361|title=Jackson State: A Tragedy Widely Forgotten|work=npr.org|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By around 9:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. the students had started fires, [[Criminal rock throwing|thrown rocks at motorists]] and overturned vehicles, including a large truck after a false rumor spread of the death of [[Charles Evers]].  Firefighters dispatched to the scene quickly requested police support.

The police responded in force.  At least 75 Jackson police units from the city of Jackson and the [[Mississippi Highway Patrol]]&lt;ref name="Presidents Commission on Campus Unrest"&gt;[http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED083899&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED083899 The Report of the President's Commission on Campus Unrest], William W. Scranton, Chairman, US Government Printing Office, 1970, pg. 422-424.  Retrieved August 15, 2009 from ERIC.ed.gov&lt;/ref&gt; attempted to control the crowd while the firemen extinguished the fires.  After the firefighters had left the scene, shortly before midnight, the police moved to disperse the crowd that had gathered in front of Alexander Hall, a women's [[dormitory]].

Advancing to within 50 to 100 feet (15 to 30 m) of the crowd, at roughly 12:05&amp;nbsp;a.m., officers opened fire on the dormitory.&lt;ref name="Reed, NYT, 5/16/1970"&gt;Roy Reed, Special to ''The New York Times'', "F.B.I. Investigating Killing Of 2 Negroes in Jackson :Two Negro Students Are Killed In Clash With Police in Jackson", ''New York Times'' (1857-Current file)  [serial online]. May 16, 1970:1.  Available from: ProQuest Historical Newspapers The New York Times (1851 - 2006). Accessed August 14, 2009, Document ID: 80023683.&lt;/ref&gt; The exact cause of the shooting and the moments leading up to it are unclear.  Authorities say they saw a [[sniper]] on one of the building's upper floors and were being sniped in all directions. Later two city policemen and one state patrolman reported minor injuries from flying glass,&lt;ref name="Reed, NYT, 5/16/1970"/&gt; and an FBI search for evidence of sniper fire was negative.&lt;ref&gt;''President's Commission on Campus Unrest,'' pp. 442–444&lt;/ref&gt; The students say they did not provoke the officers. The gunfire lasted for 30 seconds, and more than 150 shots&lt;ref name="Jackson State: A Tragedy Widely Forgotten"/&gt; were fired by a reported 40 state highway patrolmen using shotguns from 30 to 50 feet. Every window on the narrow side of the building facing Lynch Street was shattered.&lt;ref name="Reed, NYT, 5/16/1970"/&gt;

The crowd scattered and a number of people were trampled or cut by falling glass. Phillip Lafayette Gibbs, 21, a junior, and James Earl Green, 17, a senior and miler&lt;ref name="Reed, NYT, 5/16/1970"/&gt; at nearby Jim Hill High School, were killed; twelve others were wounded.  Gibbs was killed near Alexander Hall by buckshot, while Green was killed behind the police line in front of B. F. Roberts Hall, also with a shotgun.

== Aftermath ==
The [[President's Commission on Campus Unrest]] investigated this event and also held public hearings in Los Angeles, Washington, D.C, and at Kent State. There were no arrests in connection with the deaths at Jackson State, although the Commission concluded "that the 28-second fusillade from police officers was an unreasonable, unjustified overreaction...A broad barrage of gunfire in response to reported and unconfirmed sniper fire is never warranted."&lt;ref&gt;''Presidents Commission on Campus Unrest'', p. 450&lt;/ref&gt;

The University has memorialized the occurrence by naming the area of the shootings Gibbs-Green Plaza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jsums.edu/gibbs.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-11-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904150110/http://www.jsums.edu/gibbs.htm |archivedate=2006-09-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.may41970.com/Jackson%20State/jackson_state_may_1970.htm Gibbs-Green Plaza], Jackson State, Retrieved August 15, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The Plaza is a large, multi-level brick and concrete patio and mall on the eastern side of the school's campus that borders J. R. Lynch Street and links Alexander Hall to the University Green. A large stone monument in front of Alexander Hall near the plaza also honors the two victims. Damage to the façade of Alexander Hall caused by the rounds fired by the police is still visible.&lt;ref name="Jackson State: A Tragedy Widely Forgotten" /&gt;

'''James Lutyens Mansfield''' (6 September 1841&lt;ref&gt;https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:XT5V-3HF&lt;/ref&gt; – 20 December 1888&lt;ref name=death/&gt;) was a Scottish amateur golfer who played in the late 19th century. Mansfield tied for seventh place in the [[1882 Open Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Majors of Golf: Complete Results of the Open, the U.S. Open, the PGA Championship and the Masters, 1860-2008 |volume=1 |first=Morgan G. |last=Brenner |year=2009 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=978-0-7864-3360-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and family==
Mansfield was born in [[Edinburgh]] in 1841, the son of Thomas Mansfield and Mary Ann Henrietta Mansfield (née Lutyens). His sister, Marion Charlotte Mansfield, married James Adam Hunter and two of their children—Thomas Mansfield Hunter and Norman Frederick Hunter—were useful amateur golfers.

==Golf career==

===1882 Open Championship===
The 1882 Open Championship was the 22nd [[Open Championship]], held 30 September at the [[Old Course at St Andrews]], [[Fife]], [[Scotland]]. [[Bob Ferguson (golfer)|Bob Ferguson]] won the Championship for the third successive time, by three strokes from [[Willie Fernie (golfer)|Willie Fernie]].&lt;ref name=glasgowh&gt;{{cite news |newspaper = The Glasgow Herald |date=2 October 1882 |page=7 |title=Golfing at St Andrews - Competition for the Championship}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Details of play====
Ferguson led after the morning round with an 83. Going out in 40 he started back 4-3-4 and with some steady play came back in 43, despite a six at the 16th. [[Fitz Boothby]], a local amateur, scored 86 despite a couple of sevens in the closing holes. He shared second place with [[Jack Kirkaldy]] with [[Jamie Anderson (golfer)|Jamie Anderson]] and [[Tom Kidd (golfer)|Tom Kidd]] on 87.&lt;ref name="glasgowh"/&gt;

Boothby scored 89 in the second round and took an early lead on 175. Anderson and [[Bob Martin (golfer)|Bob Martin]], playing together, each had good rounds and they also both finished on 175. Ferguson again played steadily, going out in 42. Starting home he continued to score well and, despite a few sixes on his card, he avoided major disasters and finished with an 88 and a total of 171. The best of the later starters was Fernie. Despite starting with a six he was out in 40 and finished in 86 for a total of 174, good enough for second place.&lt;ref name="glasgowh"/&gt;

Ferguson's win was his third in succession, once on each of the Championship courses, matching the achievement of Anderson from 1877 to 1879. His £12 first prize was a record for the Open at that time.

===Amateur Championship===
Mansfield played in the first [[Amateur Championship]] in 1885 and also in 1888. In 1885 he lost in the first round but In May 1888 at Prestwick he reached the quarter-finals before losing to the eventual winner [[John Ball (golfer)|John Ball]] 2 and 1.

==Schooling and career==
Mansfield studied at [[Loretto School]], [[Rugby School]] and [[Cambridge University]] and became an [[advocate]] at the Scottish Bar in Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;http://venn.lib.cam.ac.uk/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Mansfield was thrown from his horse on 18 December 1888 while riding in Edinburgh and died two days later.&lt;ref name=death&gt;{{cite news |title=Epitome of News |work=Yorkshire Post and Leeds Intelligencer |date=22 December 1888 |accessdate=14 July 2015 |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000687/18881222/098/0005 |via=[[British Newspaper Archive]] |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Riddle Hoffa''' (February 14, 1913 – disappeared July 30, 1975) was an [[Americans|American]] [[trade union|labor union]] leader who served as the President of the [[International Brotherhood of Teamsters]] (IBT) union from 1957 until 1971. He vanished in late July 1975, at age 62.

From an early age, Hoffa was a union activist and became an important regional figure with the IBT by his mid-20s. By 1952 he was national vice-president of the IBT, and was its general president between 1957 and 1971. He secured the first national agreement for teamsters' rates in 1964 with the [[National Master Freight Agreement]]. He played a major role in the growth and development of the union, which eventually became the largest (by membership) in the United States with over 2.3 million members at its peak, during his terms as its leader.

Hoffa became involved with [[organized crime]] from the early years of his Teamsters work, and this connection continued until his disappearance in 1975. He was convicted of [[jury tampering]], attempted [[bribery]] and [[fraud]] in 1964, in two separate trials. He was imprisoned in 1967 and sentenced to 13 years. In mid-1971, he resigned as president of the union as part of a [[pardon]] agreement with [[President of the United States|President]] [[Richard Nixon]]; he was released later that year, though barred from union activities until 1980. Hoffa, hoping to regain support and to return to IBT leadership, unsuccessfully attempted to overturn this order.

Hoffa vanished in late July 1975&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/fbi-confirm-dig-search-jimmy-hoffa-body/story?id=8583134 |title=Jimmy Hoffa: FBI Won't Confirm Dig is Search for Body |work=ABC News |date=September 15, 2009 |accessdate=2012-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was declared [[legally dead]] in 1982.

==Early life and family==
Hoffa was born in [[Brazil, Indiana|Brazil]], [[Indiana]] on February 14, 1913, to Indiana natives John and Viola (née Riddle) Hoffa. His father, who was of [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] ancestry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sloane|first=Arthur A.|title=Hoffa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=86-GAAkOIXIC|accessdate=October 27, 2014|year=1991|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|isbn=978-0-262-19309-2|page=3|quote=Hoffa's father was a coal miner and of Pennsylvania Dutch (German) lineage.}}&lt;/ref&gt; died in 1920 when Hoffa was seven years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Martin|first=John Bartlow|authorlink=John Bartlow Martin|title=Jimmy Hoffa's Hot: A Crest special|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tUUYAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=October 27, 2014|year=1959|publisher=[[Fawcett Publications]]|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family moved to [[Detroit]] in 1924, where Hoffa was raised and lived the rest of his life. Hoffa left school at age 14 and began working full-time manual labor jobs to help support his family.

==Personal life==
Hoffa married Josephine Poszywak, an 18-year-old Detroit laundry worker of [[Poland|Polish]] heritage, at [[Bowling Green, Ohio|Bowling Green]], [[Ohio]] on September 24, 1936; the couple had met during a non-unionized laundry workers' [[strike action]] six months earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Sloane, pp. 25-26&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had two children: a daughter, [[Barbara Ann Crancer]], and a son, [[James P. Hoffa]]. The Hoffas paid $6,800 in 1939 for a modest home in northwest Detroit.&lt;ref&gt;Moldea, first edition, p. 25; Sloane, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; The family later owned a simple summer lakefront cottage in [[Orion Township, Michigan|Orion Township]], [[Michigan]], north of Detroit.&lt;ref&gt;Sloane, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

Barbara retired as an Associate Circuit Judge in [[St. Louis County, Missouri|St. Louis County]], [[Missouri]], in March 2008. One year later, she agreed to serve under [[Missouri Attorney General]] [[Chris Koster]] as Chief Counsel of the Division of Civil Disability and Workers Rights. She retired from that post in March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.co.st-louis.mo/circuitcourt/d31bio.html| title = The Honorable Barbara Ann Crancer Associate Circuit Judge, Division 31| accessdate = 2009-07-07|publisher = St Louis County}}{{dead link|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; James has served as president of the [[International Brotherhood of Teamsters]] (IBT), his father's old position, since 1999.

==Early union activity==
Hoffa began union organizational work at the grassroots level through his employment as a teenager with a grocery chain, a job which paid substandard wages and offered poor working conditions with minimal [[job security]]. The workers were displeased with this situation and tried to organize a [[Trade union|union]] to better their lot. Although Hoffa was young, his bravery and approachability in this role impressed fellow workers, and he rose to a leadership position. By 1932, after defiantly refusing to work for an abusive shift [[supervisor|foreman]], who inspired Hoffa's long career of organizing workers, he left the grocery chain, in part because of his union activities. Hoffa was then invited to become an organizer with the Local 299 of the Teamsters in Detroit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hoffa|first=James R,|title=Hoffa. The Real Story as told to Oscar Fraley|year=1975|publisher=Stein and Day|location=[[Briarcliff Manor, New York]]|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Growth of the Teamsters==
The Teamsters union, founded in 1903, had 75,000 members in 1933. As a result of Hoffa's work with other union leaders to consolidate local union [[truck driver|trucker]] groups into regional sections, and then into a national body — work that Hoffa ultimately completed over a period of two decades — membership grew to 170,000 members by 1936. Three years later, there were 420,000. The number grew steadily during [[World War II]] and through the [[Post–World War II economic expansion|post-war boom]] to top a million members by 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hoffa and the Teamsters: A Study of Union Power|author=Ralph James and Estelle James|date=1965|publisher=Van Nostrand|pages=13–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Teamsters organized truck drivers and warehousemen, first throughout the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], then nationwide. Hoffa played a major role in the union's skillful use of "quickie strikes", [[Secondary action|secondary boycott]]s, and other means of leveraging union strength at one company, to then move to organize workers, and finally to win contract demands at other companies. This process, which took several years starting in the early 1930s, eventually brought the Teamsters to a position of being one of the most powerful unions in the United States.&lt;ref name="Arthur1991"&gt;{{cite book|title=Hoffa|author=Arthur A. Sloane|publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] Press|date=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trucking unions in that era were heavily influenced by, and in many cases controlled by elements of, [[organized crime]]. For Hoffa to unify and expand trucking unions, he had to make accommodations and arrangements with many gangsters, beginning in the Detroit area. Organized crime influence on the IBT would expand as the union itself grew.&lt;ref&gt;Moldea, first edition, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hoffa's rise to power==
Hoffa worked to defend the Teamsters unions from raids by other unions, including the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations|CIO]], and extended the Teamsters' influence in the Midwestern states, from the late 1930s to the late 1940s. Although he never actually worked as a truck driver, he became president of Local 299 in December 1946.&lt;ref&gt;Moldea, first edition, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; He then rose to lead the combined group of Detroit-area locals shortly afterwards, and advanced to become head of the Michigan Teamsters groups sometime later. During this time, Hoffa obtained a deferment from military service in World War II by successfully making a case for his union leadership skills being of more value to the nation, by keeping freight running smoothly to assist the war effort.

At the 1952 IBT convention in [[Los Angeles]], Hoffa was selected as national vice-president by incoming president [[Dave Beck]], successor to [[Daniel J. Tobin]], who had been president since 1907. Hoffa had quelled an internal revolt against Tobin by securing Central States regional support for Beck at the convention. In exchange, Beck made Hoffa a vice-president.&lt;ref&gt;Sloane, {{Page needed|date=September 2010}}; Moldea, first edition, 1978, pp. 48-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The IBT moved its headquarters from [[Indianapolis]] to [[Washington, D.C.]], taking over a large office building in the capital in 1955. IBT staff was also enlarged during this period, with many lawyers hired to assist with contract negotiations. Following his 1952 election as vice-president, Hoffa began spending more of his time away from Detroit, either in Washington or traveling around the country for his expanded responsibilities.&lt;ref name="gwu"&gt;[http://library.gwu.edu/ead/lac0005.xml Guide to James R. Hoffa Documentation Collection, 1954-1976], Special Collections Research Center, Estelle and Melvin Gelman Library, The George Washington University&lt;/ref&gt; Hoffa's personal lawyer was [[Bill Bufalino]].&lt;ref name="nyti_Will"&gt;{{Cite web| title = William Bufalino Sr., 72, Lawyer For Hoffa and Teamsters' Union| last = Fowler | first = Glenn| work = [[The New York Times]]| date = 1990-05-15| accessdate = 2018-03-15| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/15/obituaries/william-bufalino-sr-72-lawyer-for-hoffa-and-teamsters-union.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teamsters Union presidency==
Hoffa took over the presidency of the Teamsters in 1957, at the convention in [[Miami Beach, Florida|Miami Beach]], [[Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;"Hoffa is Elected Teamsters Head; Warns of Battle," New York Times, p. 1 (October 5, 1957)&lt;/ref&gt; His predecessor, Beck, had appeared before the [[John Little McClellan]]-led [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] [[United States Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management|Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor or Management Field]] in March 1957, and took the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] 140&lt;ref&gt;Beck entry says 117 times&lt;/ref&gt; times in response to questions. Beck was under [[indictment]] when the IBT convention took place, and was convicted and imprisoned in a trial for [[fraud]] held in [[Seattle]].&lt;ref&gt;Moldea, first edition, pp. 70-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teamsters union expelled===
The 1957 [[AFL–CIO]] convention, held in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]], [[New Jersey]], voted by a ratio of nearly 5-1 to expel the IBT from the larger union group. President [[George Meany]] gave an emotional speech, advocating the removal of the IBT and stating that he could only agree to further affiliation of the Teamsters if they would dismiss Hoffa as their president. Meany demanded a response from Hoffa, who replied through the press, "We'll see." At the time, IBT was bringing in over $750,000 annually to the AFL-CIO.&lt;ref&gt;Moldea, first edition, 1978, pp. 83-4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[The IBT was readmitted to the AFL-CIO in 1985 but was disaffiliated from the AFL-CIO in 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Master Freight Agreement===
Following his re-election as president in 1961, Hoffa worked to expand the union. In 1964, he succeeded in bringing virtually all over-the-road truck drivers in [[North America]] under a single [[National Master Freight Agreement]], in what may have been his biggest achievement in a lifetime of union activity.&lt;ref&gt;Moldea, first edition, pp. 171–2.&lt;/ref&gt; Hoffa then tried to bring the airline workers and other transport employees into the union, with limited success. During this period, he was facing immense personal strain as he was under investigation, on trial, launching [[appeal]]s of convictions, or imprisoned for virtually all of the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Arthur1991" /&gt;

Hoffa was re-elected, without opposition, to a third five-year term as president of the IBT, despite having been convicted of [[jury tampering]] and [[mail fraud]] in court verdicts that were stayed pending review on appeal. Delegates in Miami Beach also elected [[Frank Fitzsimmons]] as first vice-president, to become president "if Hoffa has to serve a jail term".&lt;ref&gt;"Teamsters Reelect Hoffa President", ''Chicago Tribune'', July 8, 1966, p1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal charges==
[[File:Bernard Spindel &amp; Jimmy Hoffa 1957.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Hoffa (right) and [[Bernard Spindel]] after a 1957 court session in which they pleaded not guilty to illegal [[wiretap]] charges]]
Hoffa had first faced major criminal investigations in 1957, as a result of the McClellan Senate hearings. He avoided conviction for several years. However, when [[John F. Kennedy]] was elected [[President of the United States|president]] in 1960, he appointed his younger brother [[Robert F. Kennedy]] as [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]]. Robert Kennedy had been frustrated in earlier attempts to convict Hoffa, while working as counsel to the McClellan subcommittee. As Attorney General from 1961, Kennedy pursued the strongest attack on organized crime that the country had ever seen,{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} and he carried on with a so-called "Get Hoffa" squad of [[prosecutor]]s and investigators.&lt;ref&gt;''The Enemy Within'', by Robert F. Kennedy, 1960&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prison sentences===
In 1964, Hoffa was convicted in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], [[Tennessee]] of attempted [[bribery]] of a [[Grand jury|grand juror]], and was sentenced to eight years. This case resulted from an earlier matter, the Test Fleet case, the trial for which had been held in [[Nashville]]. Hoffa was implicated by one of his close associates, [[Louisiana]] teamster [[Edward Grady Partin]], who went to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] with the information that led to Hoffa's conviction. Hoffa was also convicted of fraud later that same year for improper use of the Teamsters' [[pension fund]], in a trial held in [[Chicago]]. Hoffa had illegally arranged several large pension fund loans to leading organized crime figures. He received a five-year sentence to run consecutively to his bribery sentence. Kennedy, who had pursued Hoffa for several years, stepped down as Attorney General after the second Hoffa conviction, and was elected to the U.S. Senate in the 1964 election.&lt;ref&gt;Sloane, {{Page needed|date=September 2010}}; Moldea, first edition, {{Page needed|date=September 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoffa spent the next three years unsuccessfully appealing his 1964 convictions. Appeals filed by his chief counsel, [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] defense attorney [[Morris Shenker]], reached the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]]. He began serving his sentences in March 1967 at the [[United States Penitentiary, Lewisburg|Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary]] in [[Pennsylvania]].

===Appoints Fitzsimmons as caretaker president===
Just before he entered prison, Hoffa appointed [[Frank Fitzsimmons]] as acting Teamsters president. Fitzsimmons was a Hoffa loyalist, fellow Detroit resident, and a longtime member of Teamsters Local 299, who owed his own high position in large part to Hoffa's influence. Despite this, Fitzsimmons soon distanced himself from Hoffa's influence and control after 1967, to Hoffa's displeasure. Fitzsimmons also decentralized power somewhat within the IBT's administration structure, forgoing much of the control Hoffa took advantage of as union president.&lt;ref name="Hoffa 1991"&gt;''Hoffa'', by Arthur A. Sloane, [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-prison==
On December 23, 1971, less than five years into his 13-year sentence, Hoffa was released from prison when President [[Richard Nixon]] [[Commutation of sentence|commuted]] his sentence to time served. Following his release, Hoffa was awarded a Teamsters' pension of $1.7 million, delivered in a one-time lump sum payment. This type of pension settlement had not occurred before with the Teamsters.&lt;ref name="Moldea"&gt;Moldea, first edition, {{Page needed|date=September 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The IBT then endorsed President Nixon, a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], in his presidential re-election bid in 1972; in prior elections, the union had supported [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominees but had also endorsed Nixon in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dray|first=Philip|title=There Is Power in a Union: The Epic Story of Labor in America|year=2010|publisher=Anchor|isbn=0385526296|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suspicion was soon raised of a deal for Hoffa's release connected with the IBT's support of Nixon. It was alleged that a large sum of money, estimated to be as high as $1 million, was paid secretly to Nixon. Evidence was also alleged of a secret bribe paid in 1960.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

While glad to regain his freedom, Hoffa was very disappointed with the condition imposed on his release by President Nixon, which prevented Hoffa from engaging in union activities until March 1980.&lt;ref name="Arthur1991" /&gt; He accused senior [[Nixon Administration]] figures, including Attorney General [[John N. Mitchell]] and White House Special Counsel [[Charles Colson]], of depriving him of his rights by imposing this condition; Mitchell and Colson both denied this. It was probably imposed upon Hoffa as the result of requests from the Teamsters' leadership,{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} although Fitzsimmons also denied this.&lt;ref&gt;Moldea, first edition, pp. 293-4, 321-2, 342-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoffa sued to invalidate the non-participation restriction in order to reassert his power over the Teamsters. [[John Dean]], former White House counsel to President Nixon, was among those called upon for [[Deposition (law)|deposition]]s in 1974 court proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;''Blind Ambition: The White House Years'', by John Dean, New York 1976, Simon &amp; Schuster, p. 352.&lt;/ref&gt; Dean, who had become famous as a government witness in prosecutions arising from the [[Watergate scandal]] by mid-1973, had drafted the non-participation clause in 1971 at Nixon's request. Hoffa ultimately lost his court battle, since the court ruled that Nixon had acted within his powers by imposing the restriction, as it was based on Hoffa's misconduct while serving as a Teamsters' official.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Hoffa faced immense resistance to his re-establishment of power from many corners and had lost much of his earlier support, even in the Detroit area. As a result, he intended to begin his comeback at the local level with Local 299 in Detroit, where he retained some influence.&lt;ref name="Moldea"/&gt; In 1975, Hoffa was working on an [[autobiography]] titled ''Hoffa: The Real Story'',{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} which was published a few months after his disappearance. He had earlier published a book titled ''The Trials of Jimmy Hoffa'' (1970).{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

==Disappearance==
Hoffa disappeared on July 30, 1975, from the parking lot of Red Fox restaurant in [[Bloomfield Township, Oakland County, Michigan|Bloomfield Township]], a suburb of Detroit. He had told others he was going there to meet with two [[American Mafia|Mafia]] leaders: [[Anthony Giacalone]] and [[Anthony Provenzano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,917718-3,00.html | work=TIME| title=INVESTIGATIONS: Hoffa Search: 'Looks Bad Right Now' | date=August 18, 1975 | accessdate=May 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Provenzano was also a Teamster leader in New Jersey and had earlier been close to Hoffa. Provenzano was a national vice-president with IBT from 1961, Hoffa's second term as Teamsters' president.&lt;ref name="Hoffa 1991"/&gt; Anthony Provenzano, once a friend of Hoffa but now an enemy, threatened to kidnap and hurt Hoffa's granddaughter. Hoffa called Provenzano "crazy". In 1973 and 1974, Hoffa talked to him to ask for help in supporting him for his return to power. Provenzano refused to listen and threatened Hoffa by saying he would pull out his guts and kidnap his granddaughters. Hoffa could not afford to take these threats lightly: at least two of Provenzano's political opponents were believed to have been murdered. Others who had spoken out against him had been physically assaulted.&lt;ref name="Hoffa 1991"/&gt; The threats from the mafia that they would get rid of Hoffa were taken very seriously; Hoffa's son is quoted as saying "Dad was pushing so hard to get back in office, I was increasingly afraid that the mob would do something about it." There had been three visits in a short time frame to Hoffa's home at Lake Orion and one trip to the Guardian Building law offices by Anthony Giacalone, an alleged kingpin in the Detroit Mafia, and his younger brother, Vito. Friendly with Provenzano and believed to be related to him, their avowed purpose in coming was to set up a "peace meeting" between Provenzano and Hoffa. Hoffa's son viewed the "peace meeting" overture as only a pretext. He was convinced that Giacalone was "setting Dad up" for a hit. Even Hoffa himself was becoming increasingly uneasy each time that the Giacalones arrived.&lt;ref name="Hoffa 1991"/&gt; The meeting would take place at the Machus Red Fox, a suburban Detroit restaurant. The Machus Red Fox was known to Hoffa; the restaurant hosted the wedding reception of his son, James.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nypress.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?avis=NP&amp;date=20010213&amp;category=NEWS&amp;lopenr=302139970&amp;Ref=AR&amp;template=printart&lt;/ref&gt; Hoffa wrote the date in his office calendar, "TG — 2 P.M. — Red Fox".&lt;ref name="Hoffa 1991"/&gt;

On July 30, Hoffa left home in his green [[Pontiac Grand Ville]] at 1:15 P.M. Before heading to the restaurant, he stopped in [[Pontiac, Michigan|Pontiac]] to talk to his close friend Louis Linteau, a former president of Teamsters Local 614 in Pontiac, who at the time ran Airport Service Lines, a limousine service. Linteau and Hoffa used to be enemies but had since mended their differences and by the time Hoffa left prison, Linteau became his unofficial appointment secretary. It was well known in both underworld and labor union circles that Linteau acted as a buffer for Hoffa and that if anyone needed a face-to-face meeting with him they needed to contact Linteau first. The dinner meeting between Hoffa and the Giacalone brothers on July 26 where they informed him of the July 30 sit-down was arranged by Linteau. Hoffa stopped by his office to check-in before he went to the Machus Red Fox. Linteau was out to lunch when Hoffa stopped by so Hoffa left a message for him before departing.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1975/08/03/archives/hypnosis-produces-clue-in-hoffa-case-hypnosis-brings-out-clue-in.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1975/08/27/archives/hoffa-grand-jury-ready-to-start-with-70-witnesses-scheduled-foster.html&lt;/ref&gt;

At 2:15 P.M., an annoyed Hoffa called his wife from a pay phone on a post in front of Damman Hardware, directly behind the Red Fox, and complained, "Where the hell is Tony Giacalone? I'm being stood up".&lt;ref name="Hoffa 1991"/&gt; 
&lt;ref&gt;https://eu.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/oakland/2015/07/29/hoffa-disappearance-anniversary-teamsters/30862419/&lt;/ref&gt; His wife told him that she hadn't heard from anyone. He told her he would be home at 4 P.M. Several eyewitnesses saw Hoffa standing by his car and pacing the restaurant's parking lot. Two men saw Hoffa emerge from the Red Fox after a long lunch and recognized him; they stopped to chat with him briefly and to shake his hand.&lt;ref name="Hoffa 1991"/&gt; At 3:27 P.M., Hoffa called Linteau complaining that Giacalone was late.&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/JimmyHoffaFBI&lt;/ref&gt; "That dirty son of a bitch Tony Jocks set this meeting up, and he's an hour and a half late." Hoffa said. Linteau told him to calm down, and to stop by his office on the way home. Hoffa said that he would and hung up.&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/JimmyHoffaFBI/Hoffa%20disappearance%20pages%201661%20-%202036_djvu.txt&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/JimmyHoffaFBIhttps://nypost.com/2001/09/08/the-final-hours-of-a-labor-legend/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=mQxJAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NIMMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1440,201621 "FEAR JIMMY HOFFA KIDNAPPED, SLAIN"], ''Youngstown Vindicator'', August 1, 1975, p1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/famous/jimmy_hoffa/1.html "The Disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429024808/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/famous/jimmy_hoffa/1.html |date=2009-04-29 }} by Anthony Bruno, TruTV Crime Library&lt;/ref&gt;

At 7 A.M. the next morning, Hoffa's wife called her son and daughter by telephone, saying that their father had not come home. On her way to the house, Hoffa's daughter claimed to have had a vision of her father, who she was already sure was dead. He was slumped over, wearing a dark-colored short-sleeved polo shirt.&lt;ref name="Hoffa 1991"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/gdpr-consent/?destination=%2farchive%2flifestyle%2f1991%2f06%2f17%2fthe-fighting-spirit-of-jimmy-hoffas-kids%2fe466638b-7b51-4fb3-864c-68ab9cd6818b%2f%3f&lt;/ref&gt; At 7:20 am, Linteau went to the Machus Red Fox, and found Hoffa's unlocked car in the parking lot, but there was no sign of Hoffa or any indication of what happened to him. He called the police, who later arrived at the scene. State police were brought in and the FBI was alerted. At suppertime, Hoffa's son, James P. Hoffa, filed a [[missing person|missing]] persons report.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1975/08/01/archives/hoffa-is-reported-missing-police-find-his-car.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Years of extensive investigation, involving numerous law enforcement agencies including the FBI, came to no definite conclusion. Giacalone and Provenzano, who denied having scheduled a meeting with Hoffa, were found not to have been near the restaurant that afternoon.&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2006/US/05/17/hoffa.search/index.html |title=FBI: Tip on Jimmy Hoffa prompts search |accessdate=2009-07-07 |date=2006-05-18 |work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoffa was declared [[legally dead]] on July 30, 1982.&lt;ref name="Hoffa 1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nypress"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nypress.com/article-3357-harris-o-machus-owner-of-the-red-fox-restaurant-jimmy-hoffas-vanishing-point.html |first=Michael |last=Yockel |title=Harris O.

Hoffa's wife, Josephine, died in 1980. According to her children, she died of the grief caused by the 1975 disappearance of her husband, because her health had declined steadily since then.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=799&amp;dat=19800913&amp;id=PadPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=mFEDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6464,6132300|title=The Bryan Times - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is entombed in Michigan.

===Claims and developments===
In 1989, Kenneth Walton, the head of the FBI's Detroit office, told ''[[The Detroit News]]'' that he knew what happened to Hoffa. "I'm comfortable I know who did it, but it's never going to be prosecuted because ... we would have to divulge [[informant]]s, confidential sources."

In 2001, the FBI matched [[DNA]] from Hoffa's hair—taken from a brush—with a strand of hair found in a 1975 [[Mercury Marquis#1973 revision|Mercury Marquis Brougham]] driven by longtime friend Charles "Chuckie" O'Brien on July 30, 1975. Police and Hoffa's family had long believed O'Brien played a role in Hoffa's disappearance. O'Brien, however, had previously denied ever being involved in Hoffa's disappearance or that Hoffa had ever been a passenger in his car.&lt;ref name=qpzfa&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2001-09-07/us/hoffa.clue_1_machus-red-fox-restaurant-hoffa-and-provenzano-charles-chuckie-o-brien?_s=PM:US |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001012125/http://articles.cnn.com/2001-09-07/us/hoffa.clue_1_machus-red-fox-restaurant-hoffa-and-provenzano-charles-chuckie-o-brien?_s=PM%3AUS |archivedate=October 1, 2012 |publisher=CNN |title=Detroit home searched for Hoffa's DNA |date=May 28, 2004 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a first-season episode of the [[Discovery Channel]] show ''[[MythBusters]]'', titled "[[MythBusters (season 1)#The Hunt for Hoffa|The Hunt for Hoffa]]", the locations in [[Giants Stadium]] where Hoffa was rumored to be buried were scanned with a [[ground penetrating radar]] to see if any disturbances were present that would indicate a human body had been buried there. They found no trace of any human remains. No human remains were found when Giants Stadium was demolished in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jimmy Hoffa legend put 13 feet under with demolition of Giants Stadium|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/jimmy-hoffa-urban-legend-buried-article-1.165090}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book, ''I Heard You Paint Houses: Frank "The Irishman" Sheeran and the Closing of the Case on Jimmy Hoffa'' (2004), author Charles Brandt claims that [[Frank Sheeran]], a [[hitman|professional killer]] for the mob and longtime friend of Hoffa's, confessed to assassinating him. According to Brandt, O'Brien drove Sheeran, Hoffa, and fellow mobster Sal Briguglio to a house in Detroit. He claimed that while O'Brien and Briguglio drove off, Sheeran and Hoffa went into the house, where Sheeran claims that he shot Hoffa twice behind the right ear. Sheeran says that he was told that Hoffa was [[cremation|cremated]] after the murder. Sheeran also confessed to reporters that he murdered Hoffa.&lt;ref name=iuqoybv&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,121237,00.html |title=Detroit House Searched for Clues in Hoffa Case |publisher=Fox News |date=1975-07-30 |accessdate=2012-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blood found in the Detroit house where Sheeran claimed the murder happened&lt;ref name=iuqoybv /&gt; was determined not to be Hoffa's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History Detectives|url=https://www.pbs.org/opb/historydetectives/investigation/who-killed-jimmy-hoffa/|accessdate=11 May 2016}} ([http://www-tc.pbs.org/opb/historydetectives/static/media/transcripts/2014-07-24/HDSI_WHO_KILLED_JIMMY_HOFFA_Final_Transcript_1.pdf transcript])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2005-02-15-hoffa_x.htm|title=Police: Blood found in Detroit home did not come from Hoffa|agency=Associated Press|work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 16, 2006, the ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'' published in its entirety the so-called "Hoffex Memo", a 56-page report the FBI prepared for a January 1976 briefing on the case at FBI Headquarters in Washington. Although not claiming conclusively to establish the specifics of his disappearance, the memo records a belief that Hoffa was murdered at the behest of organized crime figures who regarded his efforts to regain power within the Teamsters as a threat to their control of the union's pension fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.uncharted.ca/images/stories/articles/labour/hoffex0616.pdf|title=Hoffex Conference|publisher= Federal Bureau of Investigation|date=1976-01-28|accessdate=2012-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI has called the report the definitive account of what agents believe happened to Hoffa.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

In the book ''The Iceman: Confessions of a Mafia Contract Killer'', [[Richard Kuklinski]] claimed to know the fate of Hoffa: his body was placed in a 50-gallon drum and set on fire for "a half hour or so," then the drum was welded shut and buried in a junkyard. Later, according to Kuklinski, an accomplice started to talk to federal authorities and there was fear that he would use the information to try to get out of trouble. The drum was dug up, placed in the trunk of a car, and compacted to a 4 × 2 foot rectangular [[cuboid]]. It was sold, along with hundreds of compacted cars, as scrap metal and was shipped off to [[Japan]] to be used in making new cars.&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite book |title=The Ice Man: Confessions of a Mafia Contract Killer |last=Carlo |first=Philip |publisher=St. Martin's Press |year=2006|location=New York, New York|isbn=978-0-312-34928-8 |pages=188–190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, [[Roseville, Michigan]] police took samples from the ground under a suburban Detroit driveway after a person reported witnessing the burial of a body around the time of Hoffa's 1975 disappearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Williams|first=Corey|title=POLICE CHECKING OUT HOFFA TIP IN DETROIT SUBURB |url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_HOFFA_SEARCH?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002224729/http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_HOFFA_SEARCH?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT |archivedate=2012-10-02|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tests by [[Michigan State University]] [[anthropologist]]s found no signs of human remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freep.com/article/20121002/NEWS05/121002071/no-human-remains-found-in-latest-jimmy-hoffa-search?odyssey=nav%7Chead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004004504/http://www.freep.com/article/20121002/NEWS05/121002071/no-human-remains-found-in-latest-jimmy-hoffa-search?odyssey=nav%7Chead|archivedate=2012-10-04 |title=Police: No human remains found in latest Jimmy Hoffa search &amp;#124; Detroit Free Press |publisher=freep.com |date=2012-10-02 |accessdate=2013-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2013, reputed gangster [[Anthony Joseph Zerilli|Tony Zerilli]] implied that Hoffa was originally buried in a shallow grave, with the plan that his remains would later be moved to a second location. Zerilli contends that these plans were abandoned, and Hoffa's remains lay in a field in northern Oakland County, not far from the restaurant where he was last seen. Zerilli denied any responsibility for or association with Hoffa's disappearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/50453249/ns/local_news-new_york_ny/ |author=Santia, Mark |publisher=NBC |title=Reputed Mobster Says He Knows Where Hoffa Is Buried |date=2013-01-13}}{{dead link|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 17, 2013, the Zerilli information led to a property in Oakland Township in northern Oakland County owned by Detroit mob boss [[Jack Tocco]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130116233912/http://www.freep.com/article/20130115/NEWS03/130115079/Tocco-deed-validates-part-of-latest-Jimmy-Hoffa-claim Land claimed to be Jimmy Hoffa burial site owned by Jack Tocco in 1970s | Detroit Free Press | freep.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; After three days, the FBI called off the dig.

The '''Lords of Chaos''' was a self-styled teen [[militia]] formed on April 13, 1996, in [[Fort Myers, Florida]], United States.&lt;ref name="dateline"&gt;{{cite web | last = Morrison | first = Keith | title = Young Lords of Chaos | work = Dateline NBC | publisher = | date = | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15990418/ns/dateline_nbc/t/young-lords-chaos/ | accessdate = 1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was led by '''Kevin Donald Foster''' (born '''Kevin Donald Bates'''; June 16, 1977). The group gained  notoriety for a crime spree that ended with the April 30, 1996 murder of one of the boys' teachers, Mark Schwebes, who served as [[Riverdale High School (Florida)|Riverdale High School's]] band director.

The Lords of Chaos predate the more notorious [[Columbine High School massacre]] in Colorado by three years. The case has been documented, most extensively in Jim Greenhill's [[true crime]] book about the case, ''Someone Has to Die Tonight.'' It is also the subject of a ''[[Dateline NBC]]'' special, ''When A Killer Calls'',&lt;ref name="dateline" /&gt; as well as being mentioned in ''[[Lords of Chaos (book)|Lords of Chaos: The Bloody Rise of the Satanic Metal Underground]]'' by [[Michael Moynihan (journalist)|Michael Moynihan]] &amp; Didrik Søderlind, the book even borrowing the group's name.

== Formation of the Lords of Chaos ==

On April 12, 1996, in Fort Myers, Florida, [[Kevin Foster (murderer)|Kevin Foster]], Pete Magnotti and Chris Black went on a vandalism and arson spree.&lt;ref name="dateline" /&gt;  Florida juvenile records show that only the group's ringleader, Kevin Foster, had any prior arrests or criminal history, and his record primarily consisted of driving violations. The first spree was quickly followed by a second that included an attempt to burn a church bus and the burning of a bird cage containing two [[macaws]], killing one.

After the night of destruction, Foster decided that they should form a militia dedicated to raining terror upon the community. The creation of the [[Gang signal|group's symbol]] ( '''([[Ø]])''' ) came from an in-joke involving a question Foster missed on a math test. The symbol for the null or [[empty set]] is either { } or Ø. On the test, Foster wrote ( Ø ) as the answer to a question whose answer was no set, thereby having it marked incorrect.

Kevin "God" Foster, Pete "Fried" Magnotti, Chris "Slim" Black and Derek "Mob" Shields made up the core members of the Lords of Chaos. The group also included lesser associates Chris "Red" Burnett, Thomas "Dog" Torrone, Brad Young, and later Craig Lesh.

==Escalation==
In an ''East Lee Tribune'' article titled "Hell Raising in Buckingham", a local reporter lashed out at the unknown culprits, calling them "obviously pea-brained vandals" and "person(s) of less than average intelligence and a cretin's personality."&lt;ref name=Greenhill06&gt;Greenhill, Jim (2006). Someone Has to Die Tonight. New York: Pinnacle Books. {{ISBN|0-7860-1755-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|102}} This article only further antagonized the boys.

On April 17, the group wrote a document entitled "Declaration of War — Formal Introduction of Lords of Chaos", which they planned to mail to the Lee County Clerk/Traffic Violations Bureau but ultimately did not. The [[manifesto]] warned:

{{quote|Lee County is dealing with a formidable foe, with high caliber intelligence, balls of titanium alloy, and a wicked destructive streak. . . . Be prepared for destruction of biblical proportions, for this is the coming of a NEW GOD, whose fiery hand shall lay waste to the populous [sic].

THE GAMES HAVE JUST BEGUN, AND TERROR SHALL ENSUE. . . .&lt;ref name=Greenhill06/&gt;{{rp|112}}}}

In the early morning hours of April 20, 1996, the group escalated their terror campaign by destroying a historic {{convert|12300|sqft|m2|adj=on}} two-story brick [[Coca-Cola]] bottling plant in Fort Myers.&lt;ref name="dateline" /&gt;  Foster's original plan had been to destroy the building on April 19 to emulate the [[Oklahoma City bombing]], which had occurred on that date the year before. Like [[Timothy McVeigh]], he saw his actions as a retaliation against the government for the [[Waco Siege]], which had occurred on April 19, 1993.

As a perverse joke, Foster used a can of [[Pepsi]] filled with gunpowder and fitted with a 25-foot firework fuse to destroy the historic building.  While the other boys arranged [[propane]] tanks around the building which they had previously stolen from a local [[Starvin' Marvin's]], Foster ignited the fuse of the homemade bomb. The boys then retreated to a picnic table across the street where they could view the destruction. About 13 minutes later an intense explosion ripped through the building, causing an estimated $100,000 in damage.

On April 26, Kevin Foster and Peter Magnotti robbed and carjacked Emory Lewis, Derek Shields' landlord and the owner of the local Alva County Diner. Shields had hated Lewis ever since he had heard him call his mother a "bitch" and "poor white trash."  Lewis was uninjured in the attack.&lt;ref name=Greenhill06/&gt;{{rp|147–148}}

== Murder of Mark Schwebes ==
On April 30 the group decided to steal clothes at a local [[Dillard's]] store for an upcoming "Grad Nite" at [[Walt Disney World]], where Foster planned to steal one of the character's costumes to use as a disguise to shoot minorities at the amusement park. As part of their diversion Foster rigged a smoke grenade, which he had purchased at an Army-Navy store, with fishing wire. The plan was to stack up the clothes they wanted and run out when the grenade went off. The grenade proved to be a dud.

The boys decided to vandalize  [[Riverdale High School (Fort Myers, Florida)|Riverdale High School]]'s  auditorium. There, they stole latex gloves, a fire extinguisher, two staplers and a bag of canned peaches.&lt;ref name="aboutfoster"&gt;{{cite web | title = Kevin Foster; Florida Death Row Inmate | work = | publisher = | date = | url = http://crime.about.com/od/deathrow/ig/Florida-Death-Row-Inmates/Kevin-Foster.htm | accessdate = 1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Foster rigged a Clorox bleach bottle full of gasoline with a lit rag and threw it through the auditorium window.

Mark Schwebes, 32, the band director at Riverdale, caught members of the group loitering on the school grounds and confiscated the peaches, staplers, and fire extinguisher.  He recognized Black and Torrone, telling the boys not to be surprised to get a visit from the police in the morning.  After Schwebes left, Black angrily stated, "This has to be fixed tonight, because tomorrow's a school day. So, he's gotta die tonight."&lt;ref name=Greenhill06/&gt;{{rp|173}}

Although Schwebes had an unlisted telephone number the boys were able to procure his address through local directory assistance.  Most of the other boys went home, leaving only Kevin Foster, Chris Black, Pete Magnotti and Derek Shields, the core members of the group.  It was decided that Foster would do the actual shooting. Black would act as [[crime scene getaway|getaway driver]], Shields would knock on the door and Magnotti would stay in the car and act as a lookout.  On the way to the killing, Foster sang a deranged version of "[[Santa Claus Is Coming to Town]]":

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
He sees you when you're sleeping,
He knows when you're awake.
He knows if you've been bad or good,
So be good for goodness' sake!
O! You better watch out!
You better not cry,
Better shut up
And prepare to die.
Kevin Foster's coming to your house.&lt;ref name=Greenhill06/&gt;{{rp|191}}&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At approximately 11:30 pm, Mark Schwebes heard a knock at his door. Opening it, he received a blast to the face from a [[Mossberg 500|Mossberg]] [[Gauge (bore diameter)|12-gauge]] [[shotgun]], which authorities believe killed him instantly.  Foster shot him a second time in the buttocks because he wrongly perceived him to be a homosexual. Mistakenly believing that it was impossible to [[Ballistics|trace]] shells back to his shotgun because it was a smooth bore weapon, Foster left the two spent shotgun shells at the scene.

==Arrest and trial==
Lead detectives on the case initially focused on a [[love triangle]] they believed Mark Schwebes had been caught up in.  However, the members of the group and its fringe members soon began bragging about the killing. On May 2, Craig Lesh, a hanger-on of the group, bragged to his ex-girlfriend, Julie Schuchard, that the Lords of Chaos had killed the teacher.  He told her that he had been present and was actually the one who had knocked on the door. On May 3, after a restless night, Schuchard decided that she had to tell the authorities what she knew.

From Schuchard, detectives learned not only of Schwebes' murder, but also of the group's plans to commit armed robbery at a [[Hardee's]] restaurant where Magnotti and Shields worked. The detectives then questioned Craig Lesh, learning that he had not actually been present during the murder. They also learned that the group had been responsible for the Coca-Cola bottling plant bombing. This led to the arrests of the key members of the group, on their way to commit the Hardee's robbery.

Brad Young and Craig Lesh were quickly released with no charges filed against them. Chris Burnett worked out a deal with prosecutors whereby he would plead guilty to second-degree [[arson]] and armed robbery and serve two years in jail, receive 10 years [[probation]] and [[turn state's evidence]] against the Lords of Chaos. Tom Torrone also turned state's evidence, being allowed to plead no contest to second-degree arson and serve one year in jail with 10 years probation. In March 1997, Magnotti pleaded guilty to first-degree murder and was sentenced to 32 years—one for each year of Mark Schwebes' life—and agreed to testify.  Two weeks before his trial began, Shields pleaded guilty to first-degree murder, followed in October by Black. Both received life imprisonment. Only Kevin Foster went to trial.

[[Lee County, Florida|Lee County]] [[prosecutor]]s Marshall King Hall, Bob Lee, and Randy McGruther offered Kevin Foster life without the possibility of parole, an offer he turned down. He told his attorneys Bob Jacobs and Marquin Rinard that he considered this a worse fate than being sent to "[[Old Sparky]]", Florida's [[electric chair]].&lt;ref name=Greenhill06/&gt;{{rp|350}}

Jury selection for the trial began on March 3, 1998, presided over by Judge Isaac Anderson.  During the trial, Foster's mother testified that he was at home during the murder of Mark Schwebes, but one by one the members of the Lords of Chaos took the stand and stated that not only had Foster been there, but he had  also been the ringleader of the plot.

On March 11, closing arguments were given and the jury retired to [[Deliberation|deliberate]].  After 2 hours and 16 minutes, the jury reached a [[verdict]] of guilty. On April 9, 1998, the [[Bifurcation (law)|penalty phase]] of the trial began. The jury would have to decide if Foster should receive the [[death penalty]] or if they should be lenient and recommend life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. By a vote of 9 to 3 the jury recommended the death penalty.  On June 17, 1998, Judge Anderson agreed with the jury's recommendation and sentenced Foster to [[death penalty|death]].

Magnotti was sentenced to 32 years in prison; Black and Shields were each sentenced to life in prison. Three other members of the Lords of Chaos group pleaded guilty in a deal in exchange for their testimony.&lt;ref name="lakeland"&gt;{{cite web | last = Leisner | first = Pat | title = Lords of Chaos Leader Convicted | work = Lakeland Ledger | publisher = AP | date = 12 March 1998 | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1346&amp;dat=19980312&amp;id=U50sAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Jv0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6459,572030| accessdate = 1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent events==
In 2000, Foster's case reached the Florida Supreme Court and his appeal was denied.&lt;ref name="scripps110426"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.gonaples.com/news/2000/sep/08/florida-supreme-court-lords-chaos-ringleader-kevin/|title=Florida Supreme Court: Lords of Chaos Ringleader Kevin Foster Should Die|last=Peltier|first=Michael|date=8 September 2000|publisher=The E.

===Retaliation murder conspiracy===
Foster and his mother were later convicted of conspiracy to commit murder for planning retaliation murders against the members of the Lords of Chaos who testified against him in the original trial. They were charged with the crime in 2000, after having approached author Jim Greenhill for help in the plan. Instead, Greenhill reported it to police.&lt;ref name="greenhill"&gt;{{cite web | title = Lords of Chaos gang leader, mom sentenced for murder conspiracy | work =The Florida Times-Union Jacksonville.com | publisher = AP | date = 5 June 2002 | url = http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/apnews/stories/060502/D7JV5CV81.html | accessdate = 1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was given five years in prison, and he was given an additional sentence concurrent with his death penalty.&lt;ref name="dateline"/&gt;

===Later appeals===
In 2011 in Lee County, Florida, Foster sought a new trial or a new penalty phase based on a theory of inadequate representation, claiming counsel at the time of trial had not made a sufficient presentation on the issue of mental defects.&lt;ref name="wbbh110426"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbc-2.com/story/14515745/2011/04/26/former-lords-of-chaos-leader-wants-new-trial|title=Former Lords of Chaos leader back in court|last=Kruger|first=Lindsay|date=26 April 2011|publisher=WBBH|work=count on 2 first|accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court denied relief.&lt;ref name="miller"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fox4now.com/news/125378283.html |title=Lords of Chaos ringleader's bid to overturn death sentence DENIED |last=Miller |first=Barry |date=11 July 2011 |publisher=WFTX-TV |work=Fox 4 |accessdate=1 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130405072240/http://www.fox4now.com/news/125378283.html |archivedate=5 April 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Shields requested clemency and was supported by former Lee County Sheriff, John McDougall, the sheriff who had arrested him. McDougall made the point that Shields had been under duress at the time of the murder. Shields pointed out that he was not the trigger-man. The request was denied.&lt;ref name="wink101111"&gt;{{cite web | title = Lords of Chaos convicted killer gets clemency denied | work = | publisher = WINK-TV | date = 11 November 2010 | url = http://www.winknews.com/Local-Florida/2010-11-11/WINK-NEWS-EXCLUSIVE-Lords-of-Chaos-convicted-killer-gets-clemency-denied | accessdate = 1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media attention==
The case was the subject of a 2006 episode of ''[[Dateline NBC]]''.&lt;ref name="dateline" /&gt; It was also the subject of the book ''Someone Has to Die Tonight'' by Jim Greenhill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kevin Foster: Florida Death Row Inmate|url=http://crime.about.com/od/deathrow/ig/Florida-Death-Row-Inmates/Kevin-Foster.htm|publisher=crime.about.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case is also mentioned on the ''Criminal Minds'' episode "3rd Life". The case is also the subject of Season 1 Episode 4 named “Lords of Chaos” on the television series “The 1990s: The Deadliest Decade”.

'''Ludmilla of Bohemia''' (died 14 August 1240) was a daughter of [[Frederick, Duke of Bohemia]], and his wife, [[Elizabeth of Hungary, Duchess of Bohemia| Elizabeth of Hungary]]. Ludmilla was a member of the [[Přemyslid dynasty]]. She was [[List of Bavarian consorts|Duchess consort of Bavaria]] by her marriage to [[Louis I, Duke of Bavaria]].

==Family==
Ludmilla was the third of six children born to her parents. Her siblings were Helena of Bohemia, betrothed to [[Manuel I Komnenos]] but never married, and Sophia of Bohemia, wife of [[Albert I, Margrave of Meissen|Albert, Margrave of Meissen]]. The rest of Ludmilla's siblings were short-lived or died in early adulthood.

Ludmilla's paternal grandparents were [[Vladislaus II, Duke of Bohemia|Vladislaus II of Bohemia]] and his first wife [[Gertrude of Babenberg (d. 1150)|Gertrude of Babenberg]]. Her maternal grandparents were [[Géza II of Hungary]] and his wife [[Euphrosyne of Kiev]].

Geza was son of [[Béla II of Hungary]] and his wife [[Helena of Raška]].

Bela was son of [[Prince Álmos]] and his wife Predslava of Kiev, who was daughter of [[Sviatopolk II of Kiev]] and an unknown [[Bohemian]] princess.

==Marriages==
Ludmilla married twice &lt;ref&gt;[http://roglo.eu/roglo?lang=en&amp;m=NG&amp;n=+Ludmilla+Przemyslide&amp;t=PN Ludmilla Przemyslide]&lt;/ref&gt; and had issue in both of her marriages. Her first marriage was to Count [[Albert III of Bogen]], making Ludmilla Countess of Bogen. The couple had three children from their marriage, all sons:
* [[Berthold IV, Count of Bogen]] (d. 1218) married Kunigunda of Hirschberg, no known issue
* [[Albert IV, Count of Bogen]] (d. 1242) married Richeza of Dillingen
* Diepold of Bogen (d. 1219) a priest in [[Regensburg]]

Albert died in 1197 and was succeeded by his eldest son with Ludmilla, Berthold.

Ludmilla married [[Louis I, Duke of Bavaria]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tedsfamily.com/getperson.php?personID=I13606&amp;tree=turnertree17aug2003 Ludmilla, Duchess of Bohemia and Bavaria]&lt;/ref&gt; a former enemy of her first husband. The marriage was good for Louis because it created an alliance with Ludmilla's uncle, [[Ottokar I of Bohemia]]. The couple had one son:
* [[Otto II Wittelsbach, Duke of Bavaria]] (7 April 1206 – 29 November 1253), next Duke of Bavaria.

Louis and Ludmilla tried to find a suitable bride for their only child. Otto married [[Agnes of the Palatinate]] in 1222. Within time, Agnes' closer relatives died and she became Countess of [[County Palatine of the Rhine|Palatinate]], which became part of the Bavarian inheritance, starting with Ludmilla's grandson, [[Louis II, Duke of Bavaria]].

==Widowhood==
Louis was murdered in 1231 on a bridge in [[Kelheim]]. The crime was never cleared up since the murderer was immediately lynched. Due to the following aversion of the Wittelsbach family the city of [[Kelheim]] lost its status as one of the ducal residences. Louis was buried in the crypt of [[Scheyern Abbey]].

Ludmilla lived to see the birth of four or five grandchildren from Otto and Agnes: Louis II, [[Henry XIII, Duke of Bavaria]], [[Elisabeth of Bavaria, Queen of Germany]], Sophie and Agnes.

Ludmilla founded the [[Seligenthal convent]], near [[Landshut]], in 1232. She remained here for the rest of her days. Ludmilla died there 14 August 1240 and her body was buried there.&lt;ref&gt;{{MLCC |warning=1 |url=http://fmg.ac/Projects/MedLands/BOHEMIA.htm#Ludmiladied1240 |title-date= |title= BOHEMIA, Medieval Lands|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marthe Gosteli''' (22 December 1917 – 7 April 2017) was a Swiss suffrage activist and archivist. For thirty years, she led the fight for [[Women's suffrage|women's right to vote]] in Switzerland and then focused her attention on preserving the history of Swiss women. Creating an archive of women's biographies and history, Gosteli's work was recognized by many honors and awards, including the 2011 Swiss Human Rights Award.

==Biography==
Marthe Gosteli was born on 22 December 1917 in [[Worblaufen]], (now known as Ittigen) [[Switzerland]] to Johanna Ida (née Salzmann) and Ernst Gosteli. She completed commercial training and took language courses in the [[Romandy|French-speaking part of Switzerland]] and in [[London]].{{sfn|Ludi|2005}} Gosteli's father died, leaving his wife in charge of the estate. With the help of her daughters, the women managed to hold on to and maintain the family farm, but Gosteli recognized how inequality affected them{{sfn|Gatten|2015}} and joined the feminist movement in 1940.{{sfn|Hettinger|2012}}

During [[World War II]] Gosteli worked for the [[Wartime Broadcasting Service]] of the army staff.{{sfn|Berthoud|2011}} After the war between 1949 and 1953 and again from 1955 to 1962, she headed the film department of the Information Service at the US Embassy in Bern.{{sfn|Ludi|2005}} In the mid-1960s she turned her full focus toward the woman's movement.{{sfn|Berthoud|2011}} Gosteli became president of the Women's Suffrage Association ({{lang-de|Bernischer Frauenstimmrechtsverein}}) of [[Bern]] in 1964. She wrote pamphlets and went door-to-door trying to introduce equality gently. Rather than a demand for rights, Gosteli's approach focused on increasing women's participation in their communities,{{sfn|Hettinger|2012}} as she feared a demand would be resisted by the all-male referendum process.{{sfn|Gatten|2015}} After four years, she became vice president of the [[Bund Schweizerischer Frauenvereine|Federation of Swiss Women's Associations]] ({{lang-de|Bund Schweizerischer Frauenorganisationen}}) (BSF), and known now as Alliance F.{{sfn|Berthoud|2011}}
Gosteli became chair of the working group of the BSF for the Political Rights of Women in 1970{{sfn|Berthoud|2011}} and the women targeted the [[Swiss referendums, 1971|1971 referendum]], participating in various commissions{{sfn|Ludi|2005}} and debates. Finally, on 7 February 1971,{{sfn|Hettinger|2012}} two-thirds of the voting men in Switzerland granted women the right to vote at the national level.{{sfn|Gatten|2015}}

Quickly the fight then turned toward other inequalities: the right to manage their own bank accounts, equal pay, maternal leave and other women's issues.{{sfn|Gatten|2015}} Gosteli focused her attention on preserving the history of the movement, but her first attempt at establishing an archive of women's history failed. In 1982, she succeeded in establishing the Gosteli Foundation, to preserve and protect the history of Switzerland's women. Starting with a government collection of 19th century works including books, brochures and magazines, Gosteli added to the collection with private donations from organizations and individuals. Cataloging and adding the data to the information network of the German-Swiss archive ''Informationsverbund Deutschschweiz'' (IDS),{{sfn|Hettinger|2012}} the collection grew into an extensive library, which includes historic and biographical material about pioneers and organizations.{{sfn|Berthoud|2011}} In January 2014, at the age of 96, Gosteli retired from the archive.{{sfn|Fehlmann|2013}} 

She died on 7 April 2017 at the age of 99.{{sfn|Christ|2017}}

==Awards and honors==
Gosteli received many awards and honors. In 1989 she received the Trudy-Schlatter Prize and in 1992 was honored with the Medal of the Community of Bern. Gosteli was granted an Honorary doctorate from the [[University of Bern]].{{sfn|Ludi|2005}} In 2008, Gosteli received the Silver Medal of Merit from the Economic and Charitable Society of Bern{{sfn|OGG Bulletin|2008}} and in 2011 she was granted the Swiss Human Rights Award.{{sfn|''Berner Zeitung''|2011}}

'''Masajiro Miyazaki''', [[Order of Canada|CM]] (November 24, 1899 – July 23, 1984) was a Japanese-Canadian [[osteopathic physician]] who practised in [[Vancouver]] prior to [[World War II]]. During [[World War II]], he was appointed as a [[coroner]] by the [[British Columbia Provincial Police]] in the town of [[Lillooet, British Columbia]]. In addition to coroner's duties he also served as effective general practitioner in the Lillooet area, including for the area's four wartime "self-supporting centres".  Miyazaki's practice also included the [[Japanese Canadian internment]] camp at Taylor Lake. Towards the end of his life, Miyazaki was recognized for his services to the community, which included founding the local ambulance service and instigating a proper hospital for Lillooet, by being enrolled in the [[Order of Canada]].

==Early life==
Miyazaki was born in the vicinity of [[Hikone, Shiga|Hikone]] City in Japan and moved to Canada in 1913 with his father. Graduating from the [[University of British Columbia]] in 1925, he was unable to pursue medical training in Canada due to laws preventing post-secondary study by Japanese Canadians&lt;!--pretty sure about that despite his later certification in Canada but haven't read the bio in a while--&gt; and pursued study in the United States, at the [[Kirksville College of Osteopathic Medicine|Kirksville College of Osteopathy and Surgery]] in [[Missouri]], graduating in 1929. Dr. Miyazaki received his licence to practise from the [[College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia]] but pursued further training in Los Angeles, ultimately opening an office in Vancouver in 1930.  During his time in Vancouver he was active in Japanese Canadian community affairs, and served as treasurer of the [[Canadian Japanese Association]] from 1938 to 1941.

==World War II==
===Japanese Relocation===

[[Image:townsite300b.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Bridge River hydroelectric townsite at South Shalalth - Closeup of hotel and residential area, 1940s.  During wartime, the houses were occupied by relocated families, single men and some families. &lt;!--something is missing--&gt;  were housed in the semicircle of smaller buildings were barracks originally built for hydroelectric construction]]

Following the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] by the [[Japanese Empire]] on December 7, 1941, wartime [[paranoia]] led to the forced evacuation of Japanese and Canadians of Japanese ancestry away from the [[British Columbia]] coast to the province's interior and beyond to other provinces farther east.
One of the sites chosen for these relocations was a semi-abandoned hydroelectric-development village at [[Shalalth]] (then known as Bridge River), one of them at East Lillooet in the [[Fraser Canyon]], across the [[Fraser River]] from the town of [[Lillooet, British Columbia|Lillooet]]; Miyazaki was first relocated to Bridge River and then upon his appointment as coroner was moved to the town of Lillooet.  Other sites in the area were at [[Minto City]], [[McGillivray, British Columbia|McGillivray Falls]].  These were not fenced [[internment camps]], like the infamous one at [[Tashme]], and mostly included family groups who had been able to "buy" a better situation in the [[Interior Plateau|Interior]], with some chance of work, although comings-and-goings were still regulated by police and permits.
Many of the [[Japanese-Canadians|Japanese]] at [[Shalalth, British Columbia|the "Bridge River" townsite]] worked for the [[BC Rail|Pacific Great Eastern Railway]] and the cartage companies, while those at McGillivray Falls relocated to nearby [[Devine, British Columbia|Devine]] to work in a sawmill.  At [[Lillooet, British Columbia|Lillooet]], the presence of the Japanese helped keep the wartime merchant economy going, and the Japanese interest in market gardening helped rebirth the valley's small produce industry.

===Coroner and Bush Doctor in Lillooet===
One of the relocatees at [[Shalalth, British Columbia|Bridge River]] was Masajiro Miyazaki, a Canadian-trained osteopath whose practice had been thriving in [[Vancouver, British Columbia|Vancouver]] before the war.  When the town of [[Lillooet, British Columbia|Lillooet]]'s [[Physician|doctor]] died and a wartime replacement was not to be had to perform autopsies, the town's [[British Columbia Provincial Police|provincial costabulary]] recruited Miyazaki to act in the capacity of [[coroner]].

Special permits were created to allow him to stay in Lillooet instead of at Bridge River.  This position quickly evolved into that of all-around town-and-country doctor, dentist and obstetrician, with patients throughout the whole region from [[Pemberton, British Columbia|Pemberton]]-[[Mount Currie, British Columbia|Mount Currie]] to [[Pavilion, British Columbia|Pavilion]] and [[Lytton, British Columbia|Lytton]].

Miyazaki's practice also included the [[Japanese-Canadian internment]] camp at Taylor Lake, southeast of [[Merritt, British Columbia|Merritt]], a long distance away via the tortuous roads of the [[Fraser Canyon]] and the [[Thompson River|Thompson Canyon]]. His autobiography, ''My Sixty Years In Canada'', contains many accounts of harrowing trips on mountain roads and rail lines in difficult weather and adverse conditions.

===Miyazaki House===
[[File:MiyazakiHouse LillooetBC.JPG|thumb|The Miyazaki House in Lillooet, British Columbia, which now serves as a museum.]]
Miyazaki was invited to use as his surgery and residence Longford House, a late 19th-century manor near the main street owned by one of the town's oldest families (see [[Caspar Phair]]). Like many of the relocated Japanese in this district, Miyazaki stayed on after the war and became a major community leader during the 1950s, leading the campaign for a local ambulance service and proper hospital &amp;mdash; despite longstanding resistance from the provincial medical establishment over his qualifications, as he was only an [[osteopath]] and not a [[medical doctor]].

In 1983, after Miyazaki donated the property to the community when he left Lillooet that year, Longford House was renamed [[Miyazaki House]] . The house remains open as a heritage site for tours and still exhibits Miyazaki's office as he left it.  His office still contains all original articles, including surgical instruments, medical texts, and skeletal displays. The house also has displays of local artwork and the history of the house before Miyazaki moved there.

==Order of Canada==
Towards the end of his life, Miyazaki was recognized for his services to the community by being enrolled in the [[Order of Canada]], an honour shared by one of [[Lillooet, British Columbia|Lillooet]]'s other notable citizens, [[Kansas]]-born [[Margaret Lally "Ma" Murray]].

His Order of Canada commendation reads:

C.M. (Member)  	 December 15, 1976  	 April 20, 1977

{{cquote|Retired osteopath who, over a period of 35 years, has given unselfish service to the residents of Lillooet, British Columbia, particularly those of Japanese and Indian backgrounds and who continues to serve his community in spite of ill health.''}}

Miyazaki died of an infection in [[Kamloops, British Columbia]] on July 23, 1984.

{{redirects here|Maō|the TV series|Maō (TV series)}}
In Japanese mythology and fantasy, {{nihongo|'''mazoku'''|魔族}} are supernatural beings, normally evil ones such as devils or demons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Demon Guide|url=http://www.kanzenshuu.com/tidbits/demon-guide/|website=Kanzenshuu|accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A  {{nihongo|'''maō'''|魔王}} or '''maou''' is a ruler of mazoku, or in fiction more generically a [[dark lord]] or powerful monster.&lt;ref name="Legends of Localization 13 April 2018"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mandelin|first1=Clyde|title=Legends of Localization: Tricky Translations #1: Maou &amp; Daimaou|url=https://legendsoflocalization.com/tricky-translations-1-maou-daimaou/|website=Legends of Localization|accessdate=14 April 2018|language=en|date=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The name ''ma'' (魔 - [[devil]]) suggests that they are meant to threaten human existence or defy the gods, while -[[zoku]] (族 - tribe, clan, family) indicates that they are a family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zoku|url=http://neojaponisme.com/2009/02/03/the-origin-of-zoku/|website=The Origin of Zoku|accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maō (魔王) is a term derived from mazoku, suggesting a king (王 ''Ō'' - king, ruler) that rules the mazoku.&lt;ref name="Legends of Localization 13 April 2018" /&gt;

== In mythology and legend ==
The term "mazoku" was used to describe the [[asura]] and [[yaksha]] in [[Hindu mythology]], as well as [[Zoroastrianism]]'s [[daeva]]. It is a general term for devils, demons and evil beings. In [[Polytheism#Buddhism and Shinto|Japanese polytheism]], it is an antonym of 神族 ([[shinzoku]]), "the tribe of gods".

A maō is a king or ruler over mazoku. For instance, in Bible translations, [[Satan]] is a maō. In polytheism, the counterpart of maō is 神王 (shin'ō), "the king of gods". 

The Japanese feudal lord [[Oda Nobunaga]] also called himself a maō in a letter to [[Takeda Shingen]], signing it with 第六天魔王 ("the demon king of the sixth sky").

== In fiction ==
In Japanese fantasy, the meaning of "mazoku" differs from work to work. Some works use the term for all evil beings that are enemies of humans or good beings, while others use it to specify a certain group of beings (not necessarily evil). The term 惡魔族 (akumazoku) may be used to designate evil mazoku specifically (the word 惡, aku, means "evil").{{fact|date=April 2018}}

A maō may be a king of the mazoku, or more generally a king of demons, overlord, [[dark lord]], archenemy of the hero or [[video game boss]]. The term is not gender-specific.&lt;ref name="Legends of Localization 13 April 2018" /&gt; For instance, ''[[Der Erlkönig]]'', by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], widely translated as "Elf King" in English, was translated as "maō" in Japanese.  The term daimaō (大魔王 - great demon king) is sometimes used to describe a very high-ranking or powerful maō.&lt;ref name="Legends of Localization 13 April 2018" /&gt;

==Aliases==
Over the years, Laren Sims had a total of 38 [[Pseudonym|alias]]es,&lt;ref name="The Chameleon"/&gt; including:

*Melissa Godwin
*Tammy Keelin
*Elizabeth Barasch – a woman she met in Florida prison
*Elisa Redelsperger – the name she used when she met Larry McNabney
*Shane Ivaroni – the name she used while she was on the run

==Marriage to Larry McNabney==
Elisa Redelsperger met Larry McNabney in 1995 when she applied for a job at his Las Vegas law office. She worked as his [[office manager]] and settled large cases.&lt;ref name="The Chameleon"/&gt; However, in late 1995, Larry's law firm was investigated by the Nevada State Bar, which determined that Elisa [[embezzlement|embezzled]] more than $140,000 from clients. Larry closed his offices in [[Reno]] and [[Las Vegas]] in Nevada and moved his practice to [[Sacramento, California]].&lt;ref name="Refrigerator"/&gt; Despite this, Elisa became McNabney's fifth wife in 1996.&lt;ref name="Refrigerator"/&gt;

==Murder==
On September 10, 2001, following a [[horse show]], Elisa McNabney and her fellow employee and friend [[Sarah Dutra]], with whom she worked at the law office, injected Larry with the horse tranquilizer drug [[acepromazine]] at a [[Los Angeles]] hotel. McNabney, 53, was last seen alive being pushed in a wheelchair by Sims at a Los Angeles horse show September 10. A day later, authorities said, Elisa (or Sims) started clearing out his office and sold his $110,000 horse trailer and truck. According to her later [[Confession (law)|confession]], Elisa drove to [[Yosemite National Park]] to bury Larry, but he was still alive and she returned with the unconscious Larry McNabney in the back seat to Sacramento.&lt;ref name="Seattle PI"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/news/article/Lawyer-allegedly-killed-by-wife-who-hid-criminal-1083525.php | work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer | first=Stefanie | last=Frith | title=Lawyer allegedly killed by wife who hid criminal past | date=March 22, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his death the next day, September 12, from receiving the initial tranquilizer injection along with numerous later doses of other tranquilizer injections and mouth drops, it was estimated by the forensic examiners that Elisa and Sarah presumably had kept McNabney's body in the refrigerator in the McNabney [[garage (house)|garage]] for months.&lt;ref name="Refrigerator"/&gt; His body was later moved to the nearby [[winery]] near where it was finally discovered by San Joaquin County Sheriffs Office detectives in a shallow ditch near Linden California on February 5, 2002. By that time however, Elisa liquidated the couple's assets, totaling more than $500,000, and disappeared.&lt;ref name="Refrigerator"/&gt;

==Manhunt==
After the discovery of Larry's body, Elisa was the subject of a nationwide [[manhunt (law enforcement)|manhunt]]. She was going by the [[Pseudonym|alias]] Shane Ivaroni and was hiding out in [[Destin, Florida]].&lt;ref name="The Chameleon"/&gt; On March 20, 2002, Elisa was staying at her daughter Haylei's friend's house in [[Fort Walton Beach, Florida|Fort Walton Beach]] when she turned herself in.&lt;ref name="The Chameleon"/&gt;

==Confession==
She was booked into the [[Hernando County]] Jail and was to be [[extradition|extradited]] to California. While awaiting extradition, Elisa gave a full [[Confession (law)|confession]] to [[law enforcement]] while in custody at the [[Okaloosa County, Florida]] Sheriff's Department.&lt;ref name="Seattle PI"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Herron Zamora|first1=Jim|title=Wife's bizarre confession in poisoning / Secretary also charged in slaying of lawyer|url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Wife-s-bizarre-confession-in-poisoning-2861614.php#photo-2230812|accessdate=23 September 2017|work=SFGate|publisher=Hearst Communications, Inc.|date=25 March 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; One week later, on [[Easter Sunday]] 2002, Elisa hanged herself in her jail cell.

==Trial of Sarah Dutra==
Sarah Dutra went on trial for the [[murder]] of Larry McNabney in 2003. She faced [[life imprisonment]] without [[parole]] if convicted of [[first-degree murder]], but she was instead found guilty of [[voluntary manslaughter]] and being an accessory to murder.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lodinews.com/article_4228e805-babd-5dfc-84c7-26cf1b647a36.html&lt;/ref&gt; She was sentenced to the maximum of 11 years, 8 months in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dutra Sentenced in McNabney Murder|url=http://www.kcra.com/Dutra-Sentenced-In-McNabney-Murder/12679974|website=KCR3|accessdate=September 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sarah Prison"/&gt;.

==Aftermath==
In Elisa McNabney's [[suicide note]], she asked her lawyer to [[lawsuit|sue]] the Hernando County Jail for not preventing her suicide. She also asked that her children receive any funds raised from the lawsuit. "This is all I can give to my children... My actions now will allow them to move into the future without this heavy burden. They won't have to watch my trial on Court TV. It should all die with me," she wrote in the note. She also claims that she was not checked regularly in her cell, but an investigation has since disputed the charge.&lt;ref name="Stupid Lawsuits"&gt;{{citation|title=Stupid lawsuits by prisoners |url=http://www.rantnroll.com/html/stupidsuit.html|website=rantnroll.com |publisher=Harris Creative Group |accessdate= September 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarah Dutra was released from the [[Central California Women's Facility]] on August 26, 2011, after serving eighty-five percent of her eleven-year sentence.&lt;ref name="Sarah Prison"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Scott|title=Prison time for Dutra almost over|url=http://www.recordnet.com/article/20110801/A_NEWS/108010313|accessdate=23 September 2017|work=recordnet.com|publisher=GateHouse Media LLC.|date=2 August 2011|location=STOCKTON, CA|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bonnett|first1=Jennifer|title=Convicted murderer Sarah Dutra released from prison|url=http://www.lodinews.com/news/article_b4e2bd6a-d038-11e0-8450-001cc4c03286.html|accessdate=23 September 2017|work=Associated Press contribution|agency=Lodi News-Sentinel|date=26 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nogai''' (died 1299/1300), also called '''Nohai''', '''Nokhai''', '''Nogay''', '''Noqai''',&lt;ref&gt;Rashid Al-Din, ''The Successors of Genghis Khan'', trans. John Boyle. Page 113.&lt;/ref&gt; '''Kara Nokhai''', and '''Isa Nogai''',&lt;ref&gt;G. V. Vernadsky, ''The Mongols and Rus''&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[general]] and de facto ruler of the [[Golden Horde]] and a great-great-grandson of [[Genghis Khan]]. His grandfather was Bo'al/Baul/Teval Khan, the 7th son of [[Jochi]].  Nogai Khan was also a notable convert to [[Islam]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Though he never formally ruled the Golden Horde himself, he was effectively the co-ruler of the state alongside whatever Khan was in power at the time, and had unrestricted control over the portions west of the Dnieper. At his height, Nogai was one of the most powerful men in Europe, and widely thought of as the Horde's true head. The Russian chroniclers gave him the title of Tsar, and the Franciscan missionaries in the Crimea spoke of him as a co-emperor. &lt;ref&gt;J. J. Saunders, ''The History of the Mongol Conquests'', p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
His name is also spelled ''Nohai'' and ''Nogaj''.

Pelliot wrote that Nokhai meant a "dog." Although in the [[Mongolian language]], "nokhoi" (in [[Mongolian script]]: {{MongolUnicode|ᠨᠣᠬᠠᠢ}}, ''nokhai'') literally means a "dog", it does not necessarily mean a particularly negative and insulting name in its context, since people were called "dogs" among the Mongols at the time and sometimes presently as "nokhduud" as in "you dogs (guys/men/people)." Genghis Khan also called his capable generals "dogs of war" or "men of war." This probably came about because Mongols had a lot of dogs, and dogs were very useful for people's lives in hunting and warnings. According to the historian J. J. Saunders, the name "Dog" was used to distract the attention of evil spirits (presumably, they would not be interested in a canine). The Mongols sometimes referred to the wolf as a "steppe dog".

==Early life under Batu and Berke==
Nogai was born to Tatar (Tutar), a son of Terval who was a son of Jochi. He would rule his grandfather's [[appanage]] after his father died. After the [[Mongol invasion of Europe]], [[Batu Khan]] left Nogai with a tumen (10,000 warriors) in modern-day [[Moldavia]] and [[Romania]] as a frontier guard. He was a nephew of [[Berke]] Khan as well as Batu Khan and [[Orda Khan]], and under his uncle, he became a powerful and ambitious warlord.

===Second Mongol invasion of Poland===
{{Main|Second Mongol invasion of Poland}}
In his later years, Berke began to delegate more and more responsibility to his promising nephew. Nogai's leading role first appears, along with [[Talabuga]], under famous Mongol general [[Burundai]] as a battle commander in 1259/1260. He was a young sub-commander during the second major [[Second Mongol invasion of Poland|Mongol raid against Poland]], undertaken to pay for Berke's war against Hulegu. Here Nogai distinguished himself and plundered [[Sandomierz]], [[Kraków]] and other cities.&lt;Ref&gt; C. P. Atwood Encyclopedia of Mongolia and the Mongol Empire, p. 406&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rise to power in Golden Horde and Europe: 1262–1266==
Nogai's father Tatar died when he was serving under [[Hulegu]]. 
===Berke–Hulagu War===
{{Main|Berke–Hulagu war}}
[[File:Bataille du Terek (1262).jpeg|thumb|left|260x|Nogai defeats Hulegu at the [[Battle of the Terek River|battle of Terek]] in 1263.]]
In 1262, a [[Berke–Hulagu war|civil war]] broke out between the Golden Horde and the Ilkhanate, with Berke and Hulegu supporting separate claimants for the title of khagan.  Nogai Khan was given a high role in the army of the Golden Horde; Rashid Al-Din describes him as Berke's "commander-in-chief."&lt;Ref&gt;Rashid Al-Din, "Successors of Genghis Khan." Trans. John Andrew Boyle. Page 122.&lt;/ref&gt; He had a command of 30,000 men. He was first charged with raiding along the frontier into the territory of the [[Ilkhanate]]; Nogai made multiple reconnaissances in force into the Caucasus region, drawing Hulegu north with the bulk of his forces. He annihilated an advance guard under Shiramun, and raided as far as the Kur, but was himself repulsed near Shabran in December 1262, and forced to retreat.&lt;ref&gt;Early Mongol Rule in Thirteenth-Century Iran: A Persian Renaissance By George Lane, pg. 77&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howorth, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; Nogai then took on the task of repelling Hulegu's attempted invasion, as the latter was emboldened; [[Hulegu Khan|Hulegu]] marched north with his army to invade Berke's territory, attempting to envelope Nogai's army at the Terek, but found only an abandoned camp. While Hulegu's men were looting the camp, Nogai's troops surprised Hulegu's at the [[Terek River]], cutting down a great many of them in an ambush. Hulegu rallied his men and a day-long battle ensued; the fighting was fierce, but the Golden Horde's initial advantage was too great. The Ilkhanate army was routed and many thousands of them were drowned while trying to flee, and the survivors fled back into [[Azerbaijan]]. This victory greatly enhanced Nogai's reputation in the Horde, and he was already a trusted lieutenant of Berke.&lt;ref&gt;J.J Saunders, "The History of the Mongol Conquests," page 117.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howorth, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1264, the war effectively ended when [[Kublai Khan]] was crowned khagan with the acknowledgement of Berke, Hulegu, and Chagatai. However the war was renewed between the Golden Horde and Ilkhanate in 1265. Nogai was given the task of leading an invasion of the Ilkhanate, now ruled by Hulegu's successor [[Abaqa Khan]]. He invaded Persia and plundered some areas before being met in battle by Abaqa on the Aksu. A fierce and severe battle ensued in which Nogai was personally injured (losing an eye) and his army was forced to retreat. Abaqa pursued Nogai's army across the Kur, hoping to wipe it out, but Abaqa was forced to withdraw when Berke arrived with reinforcements.&lt;Ref&gt;Henry Hoyle Howorth. "History of the Mongols." 1876. Page 1012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===War against the Byzantines===
In 1265, Nogai led his army across the [[Danube]], leading 20,000 men into Roman territory. He routed the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] forces before him, and devastated the cities of [[Thrace]]. In 1266, the Emperor [[Michael VIII Palaeologus]], anxious to make an alliance, gave his daughter [[Euphrosyne Palaiologina (daughter of Michael VIII)|Euphrosyne Palaiologina]] to Nogai as a wife. He gave much valuable fabric to the Golden Horde as tribute, and became an ally of the Horde, principally dealing with it through Nogai instead of the official khan.&lt;Ref&gt;René Grousset The Empire of Steppes, page 399-400&lt;/ref&gt; He also gifted Nogai pearls, jewels, and valuable garments, temporarily causing Nogai to abandon the animal skins he usually wore outside of battle. Nogai did however slyly ask if the jewels and clothes could ward off lightning bolts, prevent headache, or promote good health, before praising the practicality of the dog skins his people wore.&lt;Ref&gt;Henry Hoyle Howorth. "History of the Mongols." 1876. Page 1012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==De facto rule: 1266–1294==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Mongolempiremodernborders.png|thumb|500x|The Golden Horde (yellow) during Nogai's de facto rule]] --&gt;
Berke died sometime in 1266. Despite his influence, Nogai did not try to seize rulership of the Golden Horde, settling for serving [[Mengu-Timur]] Khan. However he managed to exercised de facto control,  with near-total control over the lands west of the Dnieper. In addition to his Turkic subjects he ruled the [[Ukrainia]]ns of [[Galicia-Volhynia]], the [[Ossetians]] and part of the [[Vlach]]s directly. He also undertook his own foreign policy, sending envoys to the [[Mamluk Sultanate]], forming marriage alliances with Byzantium and the Il-Khanate, and raiding various European kingdoms.&lt;Ref&gt;Atwood, p. 406-407&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1282 Nogai sent 4,000 Mongol soldiers to [[Constantinople]], to help his father in law Emperor Michael suppress the rebels headed by John I Doukas of [[Thessaly]]. But Michael died and [[Andronikos II Palaiologos|Andronikos II]] used the allied troops to fight against Serbia.
===Invasions of Bulgaria and of Eastern Roman Empire===
{{Main|Uprising of Ivaylo}}
In 1271 and 1274, Nogai led raids against Bulgaria and Byzantium. In the first raid, the East Roman Emperor [[Michael VIII]] avoided the battle and offered his daughter as wife for Nogai&lt;ref&gt;G. Pachymeres, De Michaele Paleologo VIII, tom. I., ed.Bonn, 1835 p. 348&lt;/ref&gt; In 1277, a [[Uprising of Ivaylo|popular movement]] led by [[Ivaylo of Bulgaria]] gained the support of many soldiers and nobles and defeated a column of Mongols raiding into their territory. In 1278-79 Nogai, annoyed by the uprising, personally led a force into Bulgaria. He defeated the Bulgarians, raided the country, and besieged Ivaylo in [[Silistra]], however he withdrew after three months. Ivaylo subsequently escaped the Mongol blockade and led a Bulgarian force to victory over Nogai's Byzantine allies at the [[Battle of Devina]]. In 1280 Ivaylo began to lose support among his followers, who were not interested in unending wars with the Byzantines, sections of the Bulgarian nobility, and Mongol raiding parties. The nobles subsequently elected George Terter I as emperor. Ivaylo decided to appeal to Nogai, personally appearing before him with a small group of followers asking the khan to make Ivaylo emperor again; Nogai at first received him warmly and invited him to a feast. But at the feast, with Ivaylo and [[Ivan Asen III]] seated to his sides, Nogai pointed at Ivaylo and said "He is an enemy of my father, the Emperor [[Michael VIII]], and does not deserve to live." Ivaylo was executed on the spot by Nogai's guards.&lt;Ref&gt;"De Michaele et Andronico Paleologis by George Pachymeres" in GIBI, vol. X, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia, p. 181-182&lt;/ref&gt;

Nogai considered executing Ivan as well, the second pretender to the Bulgarian throne, but his wife Euphrosyne requested he spare Ivan, and Nogai relented. Ivan was allowed to flee to Asia Minor.&lt;Ref&gt; Fine, J. (1987). The Late Medieval Balkans, A Critical Survey from the Late Twelfth Century to the Ottoman Conquest. Page 198.&lt;/ref&gt; Nogai made the new Bulgarian Emperor [[George I of Bulgaria|George Terter]] his vassal. After George's flight to Constantinople, Nogai set his close associate [[Smilets of Bulgaria|Smilets]] on the Bulgarian throne, keeping Bulgaria a vassal of the Golden Horde.

===Second Mongol invasion of Hungary===
{{Main|Second Mongol invasion of Hungary}}
In the winter of 1285, Nogai and [[Talabuga]] Khan invaded [[Hungary]] with Mongol and [[Cuman]] troops, but unlike [[Subutai]]  [[Mongol invasion of Europe|forty years earlier]], they were defeated. They invaded on two fronts with a considerable army. Nogai had been told of the perilous political situation in Hungary by fleeing Cuman warriors (King Ladislaus IV's nobles were practically rebelling against him, and Hungary had just been weakened by a Cuman rebellion they had recently defeated), and planned to capitalize on it by launching a vast campaign against the apparently weakened kingdom.

The invasion plan was devised by Nogai, with two columns led by him and Talabuga. Talabuga's troops devastated [[Transylvania]] and raided as far as [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]], but the Hungarians' newly-constructed fortification network gave them much trouble. The Mongol forces were unable to take any major stone castles or fortified cities, and suffered from supply shortages, sallies by local Hungarian forces, and stiff resistance in any castle or town they assaulted. Eventually they were beaten by the Hungarian royal army under [[Ladislaus IV of Hungary]] near [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]], and the retreating Mongol forces were ambushed by the [[Székelys]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hungarian-history.hu/lib/kos/kos06.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-09-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818090015/http://www.hungarian-history.hu/lib/kos/kos06.htm |archivedate=2007-08-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; losing much of their invading force. 

Nogai was more successful than Talabuga, staying in Hungary into spring and retaining the bulk of his army, but still suffered several serious reverses at the hands of local Hungarian troops (primary Szekelys, Saxons, and Vlachs). He also failed to capture any major fortifications, with the exception of the Saxon castle of Ban Mikod. Nogai's column never came into contact with the royal army, as his losses to the local Hungarian forces in the areas he operated in were sufficiently serious to convince him to retreat prematurely. His column was also ambushed by the Szekelys on the return. 

Overall the campaign was a severe defeat for the Golden Horde and one of Nogai's biggest setbacks; there would be no major incursions into Hungary after it, only raiding along the frontier.
===Ascension of Talabuga===
Upon returning from their disastrous campaign in Hungary to the Horde's heartland in 1287, they found [[Tuda-Mengu]] Khan sunk in religious torpor. Later in the year,
he relinquished the throne to his nephew, Talabuga. Eager to prove himself as a capable ruler and not a puppet of Nogai, and probably wanting to make up for his part of the loss in Hungary, Talabuga immediately launched an invasion against the Ilkhanate, attempting to seize the disputed territory of Azerbaijan. He failed, discrediting him and playing into the hands of his rival Nogai, who was still respected despite his own defeats in Transylvania. Nogai would remain a powerful ruler during Talabuga's brief term as khan of the Golden Horde.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders. p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;
===Third Mongol invasion of Poland===
{{Main|Third Mongol invasion of Poland}}
Nogai and Talabuga made a [[Third Mongol invasion of Poland|third raid against Poland]] in 1287/1288 but were defeated by a contingency of Eastern European armies.

===Raid on Circassia===
Following the unsuccessful raid on Poland, Nogai and Talabuga made another expedition, this time into [[Circassia]]. There they pillaged and killed at will, seemingly with little resistance. However, heavy snows forced them to retreat early. Nogai's army made their way to winter quarters safe and sound. Talabuga's army, on the other hand,
got lost on the return and suffered greatly. Talabuga blamed this on Nogai.&lt;Ref&gt;Howorth, p. 139-140&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflict with Talabuga===
Nogai and Talabuga had never gotten along, and their quarreling during the invasions of Poland and Circassia are held by 19th century Russian historian [[Nikolay Karamzin]] to be major reasons for the heavy losses taken in those expeditions. In autumn of 1290 Talabuga, thinking Nogai was conspiring against him, decided to muster an army and march against his general. Nogai decided to feign ignorance, though he knew full well Talabuga's distaste for him; he also sent letters to Talabuga's mother, saying he had personal advice to give to the khan that he could only do alone, essentially requesting a formal meeting of princes. Talabuga's mother advised him to trust Nogai, and subsequently Talabuga disbanded most of his forces and showed up for a meeting with Nogai with only a small retinue. According to Rashid Al-Din, Nogai received Talabuga warmly and feigned illness to appear more harmless.&lt;ref&gt;Howorth, p. 139-140&lt;/ref&gt;

However Nogai was duplicitous; he had arrived at the designated meeting spot accompanied by a large group of soldiers and [[Tokhta]], as well as three sons of Mengu-Timur. While Nogai and Talabuga met, Nogai's men sprung out in an ambush, quickly capturing Talabuga and his supporters; Nogai, with the help of protégés, then strangled Talabuga to death. After this he turned to the young Tokhta and said: "Talabuga has usurped the throne of your father, and your brothers who are with him have agreed to arrest you and put you to death. I deliver them up to you, and you may do with them as you will." Tokhta subsequently had them killed.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, p.140&lt;/reF&gt; For his role in placing Tokhta on the throne, Nogai received the revenues of the Crimean trade cities.&lt;Ref&gt;Saunders, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; Nogai then beheaded many of the Mongol nobles who were supporters of Talabuga, in order to consolidate the rule of his supposed puppet khan. Tokhta was declared khan in early 1291.

==Conflict with Tokhta and death: 1294–1300==
However, Tokhta would prove a more headstrong ruler than either Tuda-Mengur or Talabuga. Nogai and Tokhta soon found themselves embroiled in a deadly rivalry; while they cooperated in raids against rebellious Rus' principalities, they remained in competition. Tokhta's father-in-law and wife often complained that Nogai seemed to consider himself superior to Tokhta, and Nogai repeatedly rejected any demands Tokhta made of him to attend his court. They also disagreed over the policy of trading rights for the Genoese and Venetian cities in Crimea. Two years after Nogai installed Tokhta, their rivalry came to a head and Tokhta set out to gather his supporters for a war against Nogai.&lt;ref&gt;Marco Polo. [https://books.google.com/books?id=VovVAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=marco+polo+the+travels&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiz05KUwJfXAhVJ3mMKHTvHBJsQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Nogai&amp;f=false "The Travels."] Trans. L.F. Benedetto. Page 433.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;Ref&gt;Janet Martin, "Medieval Russia: 980-1584", page 190.&lt;/ref&gt;
===Battle of Nerghi Plains===
Tokhta, with more control over the eastern portions of the empire, managed to gather a massive force, larger than Nogai's but reportedly less able at arms owing to the experience of Nogai's men in their wars in Europe. Marco Polo, drawing from Mongol sources, states that Nogai assembled 15 tumens (150,000 men) and Tokhta assembled 20 tumens (200,000 men), but these numbers are likely exaggerated. The two khans made camp ten miles from each other on the plain of Nerghi in 1297&lt;ref&gt;Zhanat Kundakbayeva, "The History of Kazakhstan from the Earliest Period to the Present time", Almaty, 2016 ([https://books.google.fr/books?id=7i08DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT99&amp; GBook on line] and [http://pps.kaznu.kz/kz/Main/FileShow2/78235/92/359/122/%D0%9A%D1%83%D0%BD%D0%B4%D0%B0%D0%BA%D0%B1%D0%B0%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%96%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%91%D0%B5%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%B0/2017/2 here, pdf p. 68-69])&lt;/ref&gt;, halfway between Nogai's lands and Tokhta's. One day's rest later, a hard battle ensued lasting most of the day, in which Nogai and Tokhta both personally distinguished themselves in battle (despite the former's age). In the end Nogai was victorious in spite of his numerical disadvantage. Reportedly 60,000 of Tokhta's men were killed (nearly a third of his army), but Tokhta himself managed to escape.&lt;ref&gt;Marco Polo, p. 434&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle of Kagamlik===
However, Tokhta was not yet finished. After a few years he managed to reform his army and raise a larger host with which he confronted Nogai deep within Nogai's own territory, at Kagamilk, near the Dnieper. Here in 1299 or 1300, Tokhta finally prevailed, with his army defeating Nogai's. Nogai's sons escaped the battle with 1,000 horsemen, while Nogai was found fleeing with 17 when he was wounded by a Russian soldier in the service of Tokhta. He said: "I am Noqai. Take me to Toqta, who is the Khan." The soldier killed Nogai and brought his head to Tokhta; the enraged Tokhta, angered that a Mongol prince's blood had been shed (he planned to execute Nogai in a bloodless manner in keeping with tradition), had the soldier put to death. Nogai's sons were hunted down and executed soon after.&lt;ref&gt;Baybars al Mansuri-Zubdat al-Fikra, p.355&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;Ref&gt;Rashid Al-Din. "Successors of Genghis Khan." Trans. John Andrew Boyle. Page 128-129.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;Ref&gt;Martin, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his power and prowess in battle, Nogai never attempted to seize the Golden Horde khanate for himself, preferring to act as a sort of kingmaker. He served under several Golden Horde Khans: Berke, [[Mengu-Timur]], [[Tuda-Mengu]], Talabuga, and [[Tokhta]]. This last khan proved to be more headstrong than the others, and he and Nogai began a deadly rivalry. By this time, Nogai effectively had control of the western-most sections of the [[Golden Horde]]. He overthrew Tuda-Mengu and killed Tulabuga. He was unable to enthrone himself because his great grandmother was a concubine. Another theory states that he was not allowed to take the throne due to his missing eye, as a physically imperfect man was not allowed to be khan {{citation needed|date=December 2015}}.

==Personality and character==
Rashid Al-Din presents Nogai as both a capable general and as a wily old politician. He was content to remain a kingmaker and the power behind the throne, rather than seizing direct control of the Horde himself. Nogai self-consciously promoted Mongol ways, and took pride in his lineage. Despite this, his religious beliefs apparently followed his diplomatic needs; initially he was a devout [[Tengrist]], like most of the Golden Horde, and remained one even after Berke's conversion to Islam. Later on, in a letter to Egypt in 1271, he claimed to have converted to Islam, and his name was included on a list of converts sent by Berke to the Mamluk Sultan [[al-Malik az-Zahir]] in 1263. Yet in 1288 he presented Buddhist relics to the Il-Khan Arghun. One of Nogai's wives, Yailaq, regularly visited a Franciscan convent in Qirim ([[Stary Krym|Staryy Krym]]) and was baptized a Catholic. After Toqto’a ascended the throne, Nogai married his daughter Qiyat to Yailaq (no relation to Nogai's wife), a Buddhist and son of the tribe commander Salji’udai. Nogai's daughter Qiyat, after her marriage, converted to Islam (Nogai had evidently not raised her as a Muslim).&lt;Ref&gt;Atwood, p. 407&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vásáry, p.71&lt;/ref&gt;

Nogai's first wife was named Chubei, and his second was named Yailaq, on top of Euphrosyne. Chubei was described by Rashid Al-Din as "clever and competent." Nogai had two sons by Chubei: Joge (the eldest) and Tige. He had one son named Torai by Yailaq. He also had a daughter named Quiyaq.&lt;Ref&gt;Rashid Al-Din, p. 126-129&lt;/ref&gt; He had another wife named Alaka with which he had another son, [[Chaka of Bulgaria|Chaka]], who ruled as the tsar of Bulgaria from 1299 to 1300. He was also close friends with Mankus, a Byzantine merchant from Crimea,&lt;Ref&gt;.Павлов, Пламен. Търновските царици. В.Т.:ДАР-ТХ, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; He arranged and held the marriage ceremony of Mankus's daughter [[Euphrosyne of Bulgaria|Encona]] to [[Theodore Svetoslav of Bulgaria]]  at his court, and his wife Euphrosyne became her god-mother.&lt;Ref&gt;Павлов, Пламен.

'''Ovoviviparity''', '''ovovivipary''', '''ovivipary''', or '''aplacental viviparity''' is a mode of reproduction in [[animal]]s in which [[embryo]]s that develop inside [[egg]]s remain in the mother's body until they are ready to hatch. This method of reproduction is similar to [[viviparity]], but the embryos have no placental connection with the mother and receive their nourishment from a [[yolk sac]]. In some species, this is supplemented by uterine secretions or other maternal provisioning.

The young of ovoviviparous [[amphibian]]s are sometimes born as larvae, and undergo [[metamorphosis]] outside the body of the mother, and in some insect species, such as the [[tachinidae|tachinid flies]], the embryos develop to the first larval [[instar]] stage before they are laid and the eggs hatch almost immediately.

==Ovoviviparity==
Ovoviviparous animals are similar to [[Viviparity|viviparous]] species in which there is [[internal fertilization]] and the young ones are born alive, but differ in that there is no [[placenta]]l connection and the unborn young ones are nourished by [[egg yolk]]; the mother's body does provide [[gas exchange]] ([[Elasmobranchii|sharks and rays]]). 

In some species, the internally developing embryos rely solely on [[yolk]]. This is known as "yolk-sac viviparity" and is regarded as a type of lecithotrophy (no maternal provisioning). Other species exhibit [[matrotrophy]], in which the embryo exhausts its yolk supply early in [[gestation]] and mother provides additional nutrition. This additional provisioning may be in the form of unfertilized eggs (intrauterine [[oophagy]]), uterine secretions ([[histotrophy]]) or it may be delivered through a [[placenta]]. The first two of these modes were categorized under histotroph [[viviparity]],&lt;ref&gt;Lodé Thierry T. 2012. Oviparity or viviparity ? That is the question. Reproductive Biology 12: 259-264&lt;/ref&gt; or aplacental viviparity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Biology of Sharks and Their Relatives |editor1=Carrier, J.C. |editor2=Musick, J.A. |editor3=Heithaus, M.R. |year=2012 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=1439839247 |pages=296–301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amphibians==
{{further|Modes of reproduction}}

The young of ovoviviparous [[amphibians]] are sometimes born as [[larva]]e, and undergo [[Metamorphosis (biology)|metamorphosis]] outside the body of the mother. [[Modes of reproduction]] include&lt;ref&gt;[[Thierry Lodé|Lodé, Thierry]] (2001). ''Les stratégies de reproduction des animaux'' (Reproduction strategies in animal kingdom). Eds Dunod Sciences, Paris&lt;/ref&gt; based on relations between [[zygote]] and parents:

* Ovuliparity: external fertilisation, as in arthropods, many bony fishes, and most [[amphibia]]ns
* Oviparity: internal fertilisation, where the female lays zygotes as eggs with important vitellus (typically birds)
* Ovo-viviparity can be thought of as a form of oviparity where the zygotes are retained in the female's body or in the male's body, but there are no trophic interactions between zygote and parents. This is found in ''[[Anguis fragilis]]''. In [[seahorse]]s, zygotes remain in the male's ventral "marsupium". In the frog ''[[Rhinoderma darwinii]]'', the zygotes develop in the vocal sac. In the frog ''[[Rheobatrachus]]'', zygotes develop in the stomach.&lt;ref&gt;Tyler, M. J. (1994). ''Australian Frogs: A Natural History.'' Chapter 12, Gastric Brooding Frogs pp;135–140 Reed Books&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ovolarviparity==
Some insects, notably [[tachinidae|tachinid flies]], are ovolarviparous, which means that the embryos develop into the first larval stage ([[instar]]) within the eggs while still in the female's [[oviduct]]. As a result, the larvae hatch more rapidly, sometimes immediately after egg deposition, and can begin feeding right away. A similar phenomenon is larviparity, in which larvae hatch ''before'' the female delivers them, although this may be mistakenly identified in species with very thin and transparent egg membranes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Capinera|first1=John L.|title=Encyclopedia of entomology|chapter=Tachinid Flies (Diptera: Tachinidae)|date=2008|publisher=Springer|location=Dordrecht|isbn=9781402062421|pages=3678–3679|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i9ITMiiohVQC&amp;pg=PA3678#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wiman|first1=Nik G.|last2=Jones|first2=Vincent P.|title=Influence of oviposition strategy of Nemorilla pyste and Nilea erecta (Diptera: Tachinidae) on parasitoid fertility and host mortality|journal=Biological Control|date=2012|volume=64|issue=3|pages=195–202|doi=10.1016/j.biocontrol.2012.12.008|url=http://enhancedbc.tfrec.wsu.edu/downloads/Wiman-Jones_BioC_2013.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''pack hunter''' or '''social predator''' is a [[predator]]y [[animal]] which hunts its [[prey]] by working together with other members of its [[species]].&lt;ref name="Bshary"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Bshary R., Hohner A., Ait-el-Djoudi K., Fricke H. | year=2006 | title=Interspecific communicative and coordinated hunting between groupers and giant moray eels in the Red Sea | doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040431 | journal=[[PLOS Biology]] | volume=4 | page=431 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Normally animals hunting in this way are closely related, and with the exceptions of humans and chimpanzees where only males normally hunt, all individuals in a family group contribute to hunting. When hunting cooperation is across two or more species, the broader term '''cooperative hunting''' is commonly used.

A well known pack hunter is the [[gray wolf]]; humans too can be considered pack hunters. Other pack hunting mammals include [[chimpanzee]]s, [[dolphin]]s, [[lion]]s, [[dwarf mongoose|dwarf]] and [[banded mongoose]]s and [[spotted hyena]]s. Avian social predators include the [[Harris's hawk]], [[butcherbird]]s, three of four [[kookaburra]] species and many [[helmetshrike]]s. There are a few cold-blooded pack hunters including simple [[arthropods]] such as [[army ant]]s, the [[goldsaddle goatfish]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Strübin | first1=Carine | last2=Steinegger | first2=Marc | last3=Bshary | first3=Redouan | year=2011 | title=On Group Living and Collaborative Hunting in the Yellow Saddle Goatfish (''Parupeneus cyclostomus'') | journal=Ethology | volume=117 | issue=11| pages=961–969 | doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.2011.01966.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and occasionally [[crocodilia|crocodiles]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/herpetology/herpbiology/bartram.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Pack hunting is typically associated with [[cooperative breeding]] and its concentration in the [[Afrotropical Region]] is a reflection of this.&lt;ref name="temporal"&gt;For a brief explanation see {{cite journal | last1=Rubenstein | first1=Dustin R. | last2=Lovette | first2=Irby J. | year=| title=Temporal Environmental Variability Drives the Evolution of Cooperative Breeding in Birds | journal=Current Biology | volume=17 | pages=1414–1419 | doi=10.1016/j.cub.2007.07.032 | pmid=17702577}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most pack hunters are found in the southern African [[savanna]]s, with a notable absence in [[tropical rainforest]]s and with the exception of the wolf and [[coyote]], higher [[latitude]]s.&lt;ref name="temporal"/&gt; It is thought that either on the ancient and poor soils of the southern African savanna it is not possible for individual predators to find adequate food,&lt;ref&gt;See McMahon T. A. and Finlayson, B.; ''Global Runoff: Continental Comparisons of Annual Flows and Peak Discharges'' {{ISBN|3-923381-27-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; or that the environment’s inherent unpredictability due to [[El Niño Southern Oscillation|ENSO]]  or [[Indian Ocean Dipole|IOD]] events means that in very bad conditions it will not be possible to raise the young necessary to prevent declining populations from adult mortality. It is also argued that Africa's large area of continuous flat and open country, which was even more extensive while rainforest contracted during glacial periods of the Quaternary, may have helped encourage pack hunting to become much more common than on any other continent.&lt;ref&gt;Box, Hilary O.; Gibson, Kathleen R. (editors); ''Mammalian Social Learning: Comparative and Ecological Perspectives, Issue 72''; p. 266. {{ISBN|9780521031950}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A shared pack hunting history is thought to be the main conduit through which [[humans]] formed a mutual relationship with dogs (that is, [[domestication]]), as both species are highly social and inter-dependent. Humans easily take over the dominance hierarchy of dogs as subordinates instinctively follow the “alpha” individual and dogs are accustomed to living very close together&lt;ref&gt;[[Jared Diamond|Diamond, Jared]]; ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel|Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies]]''; p. 155. {{ISBN|0393317552}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolution of cooperative hunting ==
[[File:Transient Orcas (3727711709).jpg|thumb|Transient [[orca]]s]]

Understanding how cooperative hunting could evolve requires considering the circumstances that would make it beneficial.

=== Evolutionary models ===

==== Conventional model: Packer and Ruttan Game Theory ====
In 1988, the ecologists [[Craig Packer]] and Lore Ruttan surveyed the breadth of documented instances of cooperative hunting to make a [[evolutionary game theory|game-theoretical]] model to explain under what circumstances cooperative hunting evolves. In their model, individuals can choose one of four hunting strategies:&lt;ref name="Packer 1988" /&gt;
*A ''cooperator'' engages prey both when it is alone or with a companion.&lt;ref name="Packer 1988" /&gt;
*A ''[[Cheating (biology)|cheater]]'' only engages when it is the first to find prey, but lets another individual make the kill if it arrives second.&lt;ref name="Packer 1988" /&gt;
*A ''[[scavenger]]'' never hunts and waits for another individual to make a kill.&lt;ref name="Packer 1988" /&gt;
*A ''solitary'' avoids others and always hunts alone.&lt;ref name="Packer 1988" /&gt;

Each of these strategies has a certain efficiency based on the size and number of prey that can be captured in a hunt.&lt;ref name="Packer 1988" /&gt;

The model shows that cooperative hunting for a single large prey is an [[evolutionarily stable strategy]] (ESS)—a strategy that an individual adopts because failure to do so reduces its fitness—only when solitary hunting is much less efficient. This is usually due to a prey species being too large to be taken down by an individual, meaning hunting efficiency is low and hunting cost is high. In this case, the increased benefit in hunting efficiency from cooperation must compensate for the division of available meat among cooperators. Furthermore, cooperatively hunting groups are prone to invasion by cheaters and scavengers who avoid the drawbacks of hunting, so the added benefit of cooperative hunting must also outweigh these costs. Otherwise, cheating and scavenging can also be evolutionarily stable strategies. The proportion of these strategies increases in larger groups, since only a certain number of individuals are required to help make the kill, allowing others to directly benefit without participating in the hunt.&lt;ref name="Packer 1988" /&gt;

When a species hunts a single prey small enough to be monopolized by an individual, cooperative hunting is rarely ever an ESS since group members are in essence competing for a single meal. Unless individual prey tracking and capture efficiency is extremely low, solitary hunting is always be the dominant strategy since solitaries don't have to share their kill. Cheaters and scavengers never prosper in this situation, since the original captor monopolized all the food. The model predicts that the only way cooperative hunting is an ESS for single small prey is if the predators are already constrained to live in groups—so they must share what they get in order to keep the group stable.&lt;ref name="Packer 1988" /&gt;

On the other hand, cooperative hunting is always an ESS when attacking multiple prey, both large and small. This is because cooperators no longer have to pay costs of dividing meat if they can each make their own kill. Another benefit is that when prey is sufficiently large it can be shared among cooperators if one member was unable to make a kill. Moreover, cheaters and scavengers only do well when hunting costs are very high, since they forgo the chance to get their own prey. In these parts of the model, cooperative hunting is always favorable, as long as there is some form of increase in net efficiency over solitary hunting. However, in their body of research, Packer and Ruttan found very few instances of this clear advantage over solitaries. They concluded that cooperative hunting in multiple prey situations is more likely to be a result of pre-existing social bonds rather than an evolutionary [[adaptation]], but that this hunting behavior is still important for establishing the social fabric of the group.&lt;ref name="Packer 1988" /&gt;

==== Revised model: Boesch's chimpanzees ====
[[File:Gombe Stream NP Mutter kletternd.jpg|thumb|upright|A female [[chimpanzee]] must carry her young through the trees, meaning it could be put in danger if she decides to pursue prey.]]

In 1994, [[Christophe Boesch]] condensed Packer and Ruttan's model to two basic conditions and added a crucial third component based on his study of chimpanzees (''[[Pan troglodytes]]'') in the [[Taï National Park]] of [[Cote d'Ivoire]]:

#For hunting to evolve, in single individuals the rewards for hunting (meat intake) exceed the costs of hunting (energy used up, injury, illness).
#For cooperative hunting to evolve, in single hunters the net gain (benefits - costs) of hunting together exceed the net gain of hunting alone.
#For cooperative hunting to remain stable, there must be some mechanism to prevent cheaters and scavengers from taking an unfair portion of the meat. Following his study of the Taï chimpanzees, Boesch showed that the meat is distributed in a manner proportional to an individual’s contribution to the hunt.&lt;ref name="Boesch 1994"/&gt;  This social mechanism is thought to prevent cheaters from destabilizing the cooperative hunting paradigm by getting more than the net benefit of hunters.  Additionally, this meat-sharing behavior is not related to the social hierarchy of the group, suggesting that it depends solely on participation in the hunt.

Curiously, in female Taï chimpanzees, cheating has become an ESS because there are substantially more costs associated with hunting, including the risk of dropping infants from trees and injuring them. Therefore, it pays females to be a bystander rather than hunt; in fact, the male strategy allows the female strategy to be stable provided the males provision their female partner with food.

On the other hand, in the chimpanzees of [[Gombe Stream National Park]] in [[Tanzania]], cooperative hunting is not a stable strategy. The predator-prey interactions differ in Gombe chimpanzees in a way that has prevented cooperative hunting from evolving.  Both Taï and Gombe chimps hunt small [[red colobus]] monkeys that live in trees; however, the trees are much smaller at Gombe such that it is very easy for one chimp to capture its prey.  At Taï, the trees are much taller (by about 30–40 meters), and it thus takes a larger effort to capture the prey. This disparity in height would favor the evolution of cooperative hunting at Taï where multiple chimps can help one another out and not at Gombe where the benefits of cooperative hunting do not outweigh the costs of meat-sharing. In fact, single hunters gain much more meat than cooperative hunters in the Gombe population.  It is therefore plausible that cooperative hunting evolved at Taï as a response to the more difficult distribution of monkeys in taller trees.

The results above suggest that social living in chimps may not be a necessary prerequisite for the evolution of cooperative hunting; instead, the distribution of resources is a critical determining factor.

=== Importance of resource distribution ===

The distribution of prey species is often the determining factor for whether populations hunt cooperatively. When prey is abundant throughout a habitat, cooperative hunting is not an effective strategy.&lt;ref name="MacDonald" /&gt; Solitary hunters can easily find food on their own and do not share their kill. This case arises when prey is small enough to be captured by an individual. In contrast, when patches of prey are focused in small areas of a habitat, predators are likely to live in groups to coordinate large attacks and kill more prey.&lt;ref name="MacDonald" /&gt; This strategy illustrates the importance of group living in establishing cooperative hunting efforts. In this respect, cooperative hunting is not just a function of the species, but also of its environment. Consequentially, cooperative hunting most likely evolved in areas with scarce prey distribution, and patterns of this behavior are likely to vary with seasonal fluctuation of available resources.&lt;ref name="Packer 1990" /&gt;

Even species that are normally considered solitary hunters have been shown to engage in cooperative hunting when the distribution of prey makes it difficult for solitary hunters to be successful. For example, in [[aplomado falcon]]s individuals generally hunt alone when searching for [[insect]]s, as these hunts are simple and these insects are easy to find. However, the aplomado falcons generally hunt cooperatively when targeting smaller [[rodent]]s and [[bird]]s, as these hunts are lengthy and require high-speed chases. Thus, the decision to hunt cooperatively is often dependent upon the resource distribution in certain species.&lt;ref name="Hector" /&gt; 

=== Implications on sociality ===
When resources are distributed in a way that supports group living, populations may develop social groups. Cooperative hunting is often a major feature of these groups, and it has been theorized that it is a primary basis for the evolution of sociality in the order [[Carnivora]].&lt;ref name="MacDonald" /&gt; While alternate theories have concluded that cooperative hunting may not be as important of a factor as [[territory (animal)|territory]] sharing and mutual protection of [[offspring]], they still agree that it plays an important role in developing social groups.&lt;ref name="Packer 1990" /&gt; For example, as a result of cooperative hunting, aplomado falcons defend the nest together and share the food with offspring after the hunt.&lt;ref name="Hector" /&gt; Cooperative hunting has thus proven to hold certain social groups together since it can be disadvantageous to hunt alone in particular situations. Future research may quantify the contribution of cooperative hunting to the evolution of sociality, as it is currently difficult to ascertain how much cooperative hunting is a cause or a consequence of social behavior.

== Adaptive significance ==
When an environment allows it, cooperative hunting can offer species a range of adaptive advantages not normally available through solitary hunting.

=== Adaptive advantages of cooperative hunting ===
There are two main goals to cooperative hunting in social carnivores: taking down large prey species through a coordinated effort and subsequently protecting their kill from scavengers.&lt;ref name="MacDonald" /&gt; A common goal in cooperatively hunting pairs is to coordinate the separation of a mother and her offspring, facilitaing an easier kill that a solitary hunter could not make. Cooperative hunting is also important in species that prey on larger animals, such as [[African hunting dog]]s, as it allows them to make a kill in a safer, more efficient manner. After the kill has been made, the hunters restrict meat access to those involved in the hunt to protect their food from scavengers. This includes both strictly scavenging species and members of their own species who do not participate in the hunt. In these ways, cooperative hunting confers adaptive advantages by affording species a means to make more efficient kills and by ensuring they get the maximum amount of food possible from their kill.

Another advantage of cooperative hunting is that attacking in a group allows more opportunities to make a kill before the prey scatters and gets away.&lt;ref name="MacDonald" /&gt; There is also the potential to confuse the prey species so they may run into another hunter approaching from a different direction. Group attacks are particularly advantageous when prey live in concentrated groups, as hunters have a hard time tracking prey in territories outside the preferred habitat.

Higher success in prey capture has been demonstrated in wild dogs,&lt;ref name="Creel 1995" /&gt; [[bottlenose dolphins]] and other [[cetacea]]ns,&lt;ref name ="Gazda"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Gazda S.K., Connor R.C., Edgar R.K., Cox F. | year=2005 | title=A division of labour with role specialization in group-hunting bottlenose dolphins (''Tursiops truncatus'') off Cedar Key, Florida | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B | volume=272 | pages=135–140 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2004.2937 | pmid=15695203 | pmc=1634948}}&lt;/ref&gt; falcons, and [[fossa (animal)|fossa]] due to cooperative hunting.  For example, aplomado falcons increase their efficiency of capture when hunting in pairs because the pairs are twice as successful as hunting alone.&lt;ref name="Hector" /&gt; As a result, the high overall success rate of cooperative hunting leads to higher per capita meat intake even in large groups.&lt;ref name="Watts"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Watts, D. P.; Mitani J. C. | year=2002 | title=Hunting behavior of chimpanzees at Ngogo, Kibale National Park, Uganda | doi=10.1023/a:1013270606320 | journal=International Journal of Primatology | volume=23 | pages=1–28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economics of group size ===
Many populations capable of forming cooperative hunting groups may not necessarily do so if their group is too small or too large for this behavior to be favorable. Group size is an important indicator of specific instances of cooperative hunting, as the prey must be large enough and the hunting group small enough to provide enough food for all individuals. Another important consideration is that when groups grow larger, there is a greater chance that individuals will engage in a cheater strategy. If there is consistently too much cheating in a group, individuals will prefer to hunt alone so they do not have to share their meal with [[free rider problem|freeloaders]].

There may be costs that set an upper limit on group size.&lt;ref name ="Creel 1997"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Creel, S. | year=1997 | title=Cooperative hunting and group size: assumptions and currencies | journal=Animal Behaviour | volume=54 | pages=1319–1324 | doi=10.1006/anbe.1997.0481}}&lt;/ref&gt; The net benefits increase as a function of pack size, as more animals in a group are theoretically able to obtain more meat.  However, in African wild dogs, researchers found that the most common group size was not the group size that maximized net benefits.&lt;ref name="Creel 1997" /&gt; Instead, because larger packs must travel farther to get more food, there are travelling costs associated with larger groups. Thus, African wild dogs optimize a more appropriate currency: the amount of meat gained per dog per kilometer traveled, instead of the amount of meat gained per dog per day as the latter does not take into account the costs of hunting.  This research successfully demonstrates that varying ecological variables are responsible for the difference in optimum group size among cooperatively hunting animals.

== Animal roles in cooperative hunting ==
Division of labor, which involves each team member performing a subtask to complete an objective, has been found in many species. It has been shown that animals that forage and hunt cooperatively in groups often adopt specialized roles during a [[hunting|hunting event]], which can vary widely among different species.  Division of labor among cooperatively hunting species occurs along a continuum, ranging from species in which individuals never differentiate into specific roles to species in which individuals specialize into different roles that they always perform throughout their lifetime.

=== African wild dogs ===
[[File:Wild dog Lycaon pictus feeding.jpg|thumb|[[African wild dogs]] eating the spoils of their hunt]]

African wild dogs participate in an intense rally ceremony before hunting. Its function is to ensure that all the members are alert and ready to hunt. They then all trot together and participate in a chase during which they pursue and harass the prey.  Instead of immediately attacking the prey, which could result in small prey immediately fleeing and large prey forming a defensive pinwheel and charging, the dogs form a defensive formation. Despite their coordinated formation, there is no clear role specialization in this species, as all individuals perform essentially the same function.&lt;ref name="Creel 1995" /&gt;

[[File:Canis lupus pack surrounding Bison.jpg|thumb|Canadian Gray Wolves surrounding a bison]]

===Alaskan wolves===
Co-operation between wolves in a pack is most visible in their hunting strategy, and is highly effective. A wolf pack may trail a herd of elk, caribou or other large prey for days, looking for an animal that displays any sign of weakness, before making its move. In open areas, wolves may precede the hunt with group ceremonies involving standing nose-to-nose and wagging their tails. Once concluded, the pack heads towards their prey, chasing it down and then surrounding it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Mech, L. David |title=The wolves of Denali |date=2003 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |isbn=0816629595 |pages=196–199}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the attack begins the wolves have specific roles in the hunt, based on age, gender and social standing, as well as its particular experience and abilities. The youngest wolves frequently do nothing more than observe and learn from the sidelines. Speedy, lightly built females often take on herding roles, darting back and forth in front of prey, causing confusion and preventing escape. Slower but more powerful males are able to take down a large animal more aggressively and quickly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Haber |first1=Gordon |last2=Holleman |first2=Marybeth |title=Among wolves : Gordon Haber's insights into Alaska's most misunderstood animal |date=2013 |publisher=University of Alaska Press |isbn=9781602232181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aplomado falcons ===

[[Aplomado falcon]]s monitor each other's movements during hunts. Males and females always perform the same task in every situation.  They begin perched together and the males initiate and give a sharp "chirp" vocalization to signal for the female to follow suit.  When chasing birds on the ground, the females follow right behind the birds in the bushes and the males swoop in from overhead to make the kill. Within these pairs, males and females are consistently assigned to a particular role.&lt;ref name ="Hector" /&gt;

=== Bottlenose dolphins ===

Individual role specialization has also been observed in bottlenose dolphins.  The bottlenose dolphins form groups of three to six. One dolphin acts as the “driver” and herds the fish in circles towards the “barrier dolphins” who are tightly grouped together to form a barrier.  The driver performs fluke-slaps to cause the fish to leap into the air.  As the fish begin to leap, the driver moves next to the barrier dolphins, who all catch the fish in the air with their mouths open. Stefanie Gazda and colleagues predict that this role specialization is more common in [[marine biology|marine]] than [[terrestrial animals|terrestrial]] animals due to a higher variability in prey diversity, [[biomass]], and predator mobility in the [[ocean]].&lt;ref name ="Gazda" /&gt; One specific type of cooperative feeding behavior is [[mud ring feeding]].

[[File:DOLPHIN FIGURE (1).jpg|thumb|center|upright=3.5|A team of [[dolphins]] each fill a specialized role to make fish jump in the air. In this vulnerable position, they are easy prey for the dolphin team. ]]

=== Lions ===
Cooperative hunting strategy in [[lions]] is based on groups of three to seven individuals split into two highly specialized roles, centers and wings, which coordinate their movement to encircle and ambush the prey. In a line of lions, the outside individuals, also known as the wings, first run out to the sides of the intended target while the center lies in an ambush position. As the wings slowly encircle their mark, they drive the prey towards the waiting center—often one of the older and heavier individuals in the group—who then pounces to make the kill. Each individual in the group learns its preferred role during youth, whether it be center or wing. A child does not necessarily perform the same position as its mother since it learns through observing other lionesses in the pride. Individuals have also been shown to perform positions other than their natural place depending on whether another individual has already filled their role. Despite this plasticity, hunting success is greatest when every individual in the group can perform its specialized role.&lt;ref name ="Stander"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Stander P.E. | year=1992 | title=Cooperative hunting in lions: the role of the individual | journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume=29 | pages=445–454 | doi=10.1007/bf00170175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chimpanzees ===
In Taï, chimpanzee, individuals participate as a driver, blocker, chaser, or ambusher.  Drivers follow the prey without trying to catch up with it.  Blockers place themselves in a tree to block the progression of the prey.  Chasers move quickly after the prey to catch up with it.  Finally, ambushers anticipate the escape route of the prey long enough in advance to force it back towards the chasers or down into the lower canopy.  Blocking and ambushing are thought to require much more cognitive effort in anticipating the future movements of the prey, and they are thus rewarded with a larger proportion of meat after a successful hunt. These two roles correlate positively with the age of the chimpanzee as the cognitive function necessary to perform these tasks is thought to increase with age. Furthermore, individuals can change roles during the same hunt or maintain their same role during the entire process.&lt;ref name ="Boesch 2002"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Boesch C | year=2002 | title=Cooperative hunting roles among taï chimpanzees | journal=Human Nature | volume=13 | pages=27–46 | doi=10.1007/s12110-002-1013-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Further examples ==
In addition to the well-documented examples of pack hunting in social carnivores, the behaviour is found in both vertebrates and invertebrates.

===Fossa===
[[File:Cryptoprocta ferox.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The usually solitary fossa sometimes hunts cooperatively.]]
[[Fossa (animal)|Fossa (''Cryptoprocta ferox'')]] are the first documented example of cooperative hunting in solitary species, as fossa are some of the least social carnivores.&lt;ref name="Luhrs"  /&gt;  The fossa is the largest member of [[Madagascar]] [[mongoose]]s.  They are carnivorous, feeding mostly on small [[lemurs]] and [[tenrecs]].  Prey size may have been important for the evolution of cooperative hunting in fossa because one of their main sources of prey (larger lemurs) has recently gone extinct.  Larger lemurs (20-120 pounds), such as giant sloth lemurs, were abundant on Madagascar until 500–1500 years ago.&lt;ref name="Luhrs"  /&gt;  Cooperative hunting was common to take down a prey of this size.  However, since extinction was relatively recent, cooperative hunting may have persisted even after their prey size diminished.

===Spiders===
Stegodyphid spiders (Genus ''[[Stegodyphus]]'') have been shown to act cooperatively to trap and collect insect prey species.&lt;ref name ="Packer 1988" /&gt; These social arachnids cooperate both by spinning communal webs on which to catch prey and by moving together to catch large prey in the field, such as grasshoppers.&lt;ref name="Ward"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Ward P.I., Enders M.M. | year=1985 | title="Conflict and Cooperation in the Group Feeding of the Social Spider" ''Stegodyphus mimosarum'' | journal=Behavior | volume=94 | pages=167–182 | doi=10.1163/156853985x00325}}&lt;/ref&gt; These spiders do not monopolize certain parts of the web, meaning any individual can use a variety of locations to lie in wait for prey. When prey is captured in the field, it usually requires at least two spiders to be brought back to the nest to be shared among the rest of the colony.

=== Humans ===
[[File:Alfred Jacob Miller - Hunting Buffalo - Walters 371940190.jpg|thumb|''Hunting Buffalo'' by [[Alfred Jacob Miller]], c. 1859]]

Research at Lamalera village in [[Indonesia]] has shown how cooperative hunting can develop in pre-industrial societies. This village relies on traditional whale hunting techniques for its livelihood.&lt;ref name="Alvard"/&gt;  Because whale hunting requires more than one individual, it benefits the villagers to hunt cooperatively. The hunting men cooperate either as crew members, corporate members, or craftsmen. Each performs a different duty and receives a different share of whale meat. Alvard echoes other research by suggesting that these shared norms of meat distribution sustains cooperative hunting and prevents the rise of cheaters.&lt;ref name ="Alvard"/&gt;

This research also details the importance of biological relatedness amongst a cooperative hunting group. [[Kin selection]] favours traits or behaviours that promote the survival of relatives. At Lamalera, only kin that are of the same lineage (that all descend from male relatives or all descend from female relatives) hunt together. The researchers suggest that this allows an unambiguous identification of the relatedness of other group members. 

=== Crocodylians ===
Research conducted by Vladmir Dinets has indicated that crocodylians regularly engage in cooperative hunting behavior, including highly-organized game drives. Behaviours noted by Dinets include forming tight "bait balls" when hunting fish and being able to anticipate the location and actions of other crocodiles without being able to see them for an ambush. Dinets suggests this may make crocodiles some of a small group of animals that can cooperate in such sophisticated ways.&lt;ref name="croc"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Dinets, V. | year=2014 | title=Apparent coordination and collaboration in cooperatively hunting crocodilians | journal=Ethology Ecology &amp; Evolution | volume=27 | pages=244–250 | doi=10.1080/03949370.2014.915432}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interspecific cooperative hunting==

[[Groupers]] (''Plectropomus pessuliferus marisrubri'') and [[giant moray]] eels (''Gymnothorax javanicus'') provide compelling evidence for interspecific cooperative hunting.  Groupers visit moray eels at their resting places and provide visual signals (such as a head shake) to engage morays in the hunt. These associations are non-random and appear to be motivated by the hunger level of the groupers.  Groupers were able to capture prey five times more quickly with morays present because the eels could sneak through crevices and corner prey items; additionally, morays that hunted alone were never successful because they did not have a grouper present to lead them to the prey. Thus, the hunting success of groupers and giant moray eels is greater for both species than when hunting alone.&lt;ref name ="Bshary" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Vail"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Vail, A.L.; Manica, A.; Bshary, R. |year=2013 |title=Referential gestures in fish collaborative hunting |journal=Nature Communications |volume=4 |pages=1765 |doi=10.1038/ncomms2781 |pmid=23612306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paul Eugene Gillmor''' (February 1, 1939 – c. September 5, 2007&lt;!-- May have died Tuesday evening, not Wednesday morning, according to some sources. Still waiting for confirmation. --&gt;) was an [[United States|American]] politician of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] who served as the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] from the [[Ohio's 5th congressional district|5th congressional district]] of [[Ohio]] from 1989 until his death in 2007.

==Early life, career, and family==
Gillmor was born in [[Tiffin, Ohio]]&lt;ref name="AP 2006 profile"&gt;[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Bl5iSVpSe3cJ:hosted.ap.org/dynamic/external/pre-election/bios/1378.html%3FSITE%3DWIMILELN%26SECTION%3DPOLITICS%26TEMPLATE%3DDEFAULT+site:hosted.ap.org+%22Paul+Gillmor%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=2&amp;gl=us&amp;client=firefox-a Associated Press profile, 2006], accessed May 14, 2007 &lt;!---via Google cache; nothing available at www.archive.org ---&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and grew up in [[Old Fort, Ohio|Old Fort]]; his father owned a trucking business in the area.  His mother was Lucy Fry Gillmor.  He attended [[Old Fort High School]], graduating in 1957. In 1961 he received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree from [[Ohio Wesleyan University]].  In 1964, he graduated with a law degree from the [[University of Michigan]].

From 1965 to 1966, Gillmor was on active duty in the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] as a Judge Advocate, attaining the rank of Captain. He then entered the practice of law.

Paul Gillmor married Brenda Lee Luckey, daughter of Helen and Lee Luckey of Fostoria, Ohio.  They had two children, Linda and Julie.
Gillmor's wife Brenda was killed in a car accident in Fremont, Ohio in September 1972. Daughters Linda and Julie, ages 7 and 5 at the time, were in the car.

Gillmor married [[Karen Gillmor|Karen Lako]], who also served in the [[Ohio Senate]], in 1983. Gillmor had three sons with his wife Karen, Paul Michael and twins Adam and Connor.&lt;ref name="cnndeath"&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/09/05/congressman.dead/index.html "Ohio congressman found dead in apartment"], ''CNN'', September 5, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Ottawa OH 2007 Blanchard River Flood Coast Guard Gilmore2.jpg|thumb|right|Paul Gillmor tours flood-ravaged [[Ottawa, Ohio]] 12 days before his accidental death.]]

==Political career==

===Ohio State Senate===
Gillmor was elected as an [[Ohio Senate|Ohio state senator]] in 1967, where he remained until being elected to Congress in 1988. For the last 10 years of his tenure, he was the leader of the Republicans in the chamber, serving as president of the state senate for three [[Ohio General Assembly|General Assemblies]] from 1981 to 1982 and from 1985 to 1988. He ran in the 1986 Republican primary for [[Governor of Ohio|governor]], but lost to former governor [[James A. Rhodes]].

===U.S. Congress===

====Elections====
In [[United States House elections, 1988|1988]], Gillmor entered the Republican primary for the 5th District after 30-year incumbent [[Del Latta]] retired. Latta endorsed his son, [[Bob Latta|Bob]], as his successor; Gillmor defeated him by only 27 votes. He was then handily elected in November and was reelected nine times in this heavily Republican district, usually by margins of 2-to-1. He ran unopposed in [[United States House elections, 1992|1992]].

In [[United States House elections, 2002|2002]], Gillmor defeated Republican [[Rex Damschroder]] in the primary.

===Residency and real estate===
Until March 2006, when he bought a condominium in Tiffin for $230,000, Gillmor claimed his boyhood home in Old Fort as his official residence. Both were within the 5th district. However, he spent most of his time in [[Dublin, Ohio|Dublin]], a suburb of [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]].  Gillmor's wife worked in Columbus as vice chairman of the State Employment Relations Board; prior to being appointed to that position, she was a state senator.&lt;ref name="TB-5-13-07"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TB-11-2-06"/&gt; When asked prior to the November 2006 election how often he stayed at the Tiffin house, Gillmor refused to answer.&lt;ref name="TB-11-2-06"&gt;Jennifer Feehan, [https://web.archive.org/web/20070930033736/http://toledoblade.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20061102%2FNEWS09%2F611020353%2F-1%2FNEWS "Gillmor family rarely seen at new 'residence' in Tiffin"], ''Toledo Blade'', November 2, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilmor's opponents in the last three election cycles prior to his death made an issue of his residence, and many of the condominium's residents claimed they rarely saw him there.&lt;ref name="TB-11-2-06"/&gt; Members of the House are constitutionally required to live only in the state they represent, but it has become a strong convention that they live in or close to the district they represent as well.  However, Gillmor long insisted that [[Seneca County, Ohio|Seneca County]] (home to both Old Fort and Tiffin) was his true home.

In March 2007, Gillmor and his family moved into a new house in Dublin. In 2005, Zenith Holding received a construction loan of $967,000, to build the house. Prior to moving into the house, Gillmor and his family lived in a four-bedroom, {{convert|3571|sqft|m2|adj=on}} house in Dublin that they bought in 1996 for $364,900.&lt;ref name="TB-5-02-07"&gt;Joshua Boak, [https://web.archive.org/web/20070930024312/http://toledoblade.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20070502%2FNEWS09%2F705020395 "Gillmor defends move to new home"], ''Toledo Blade'', May 2, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter to the ''Toledo Blade'' in early May 2007, the firm said that Zenith has the new Dublin house and its land in trust "at the request of, and for the benefit of" Gillmor, who pays the mortgage and taxes.&lt;ref name="TB-5-02-07"/&gt; In a follow-up letter to the newspaper, Gillmor said he considers the properties outside his district, in Dublin and Arlington, to be "only real estate investments."&lt;ref name="TB-11-2-06"/&gt; In his April 2007 letter to ''The Blade'', Gillmor similarly said that the property was in a trust. But in May 2007, Gillmor's spokesman, Brad Mascho, said that a trustlike entity that is "not a trust" controls the house, so there had been no need to notify the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct that Gillmor was transferring assets into a trust in order to purchase the home.&lt;ref name="TB-5-13-07"&gt;Joshua Boak, [https://web.archive.org/web/20070930015128/http://toledoblade.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20070513%2FNEWS09%2F70513002 "Questions about Gillmor’s $1 million residence linger"], ''Toledo Blade'', May 13, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

====Committees and positions====
Gillmor was the ranking Republican on the Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit Subcommittee of the [[U.S. House Committee on Financial Services|Financial Services Committee]]. He also served on the [[U.S. House Committee on Energy and Commerce|Energy and Commerce Committee]], and chaired its Environment and Hazardous Materials Subcommittee until the Republicans lost control of Congress following the [[United States House elections, 2006|2006 elections]]. In 2006, Gillmor served as a member of a bipartisan reform task force on ethics and congressional mailing practices. He was a member of the moderate [[Republican Main Street Partnership]].

The [[American Conservative Union]] gave Gillmor's 2005 voting record a rating of 82 points out of a possible 100; the liberal [[Americans for Democratic Action]] gave him a 0 rating.&lt;ref name="AP 2006 profile"/&gt;

Gillmor joined with [[Massachusetts]] Congressman [[Barney Frank]] to propose the Industrial Bank Holding Company Act of 2006, which was designed to prevent retailers such as [[Wal-Mart]] and [[Home Depot]] from operating banks to process their credit card transactions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-148603236.html LAWMAKERS ATTEMPT TO PREVENT RETAILERS FROM OPERATING BANKS; "THE INDUSTRIAL BANK HOLDING COMPANY ACT OF 2006" SEEKS TO BLOCK NON-FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS FROM BANKING.(Paul Gillmor) – HFN The Weekly Newspaper for the Home FurnishingNetwork – HighBeam Research&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Banking interests==
Gillmor became partial owner of Old Fort Bank in Seneca County, about {{convert|60|mi|km}} southeast of Toledo, after the death of his father, Paul M. Gillmor. In 2006, Gillmor received $540,000 in dividends from the bank, for his share of ownership, out of a total of $2 million paid to all shareholders. The bank had total profits of $3.6 million in 2006.&lt;ref name="TB-05-27-07"/&gt;

In 2007, Gillmor received approval from the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct and the offices of two federal regulators to be an initial director and investor in a new Florida bank, the Panther Community Bank.&lt;ref name="TB-05-27-07"&gt;Joshua Boak, [http://toledoblade.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070527/NEWS09/705270337 "Gillmor takes lead on bank law while he's a bank owner"], ''Toledo Blade'', May 27, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
On September 5, 2007, Gillmor was found dead in his [[Arlington County, Virginia]] townhouse by members of his staff after he failed to show up for a [[United States House Committee on Financial Services|House Financial Services Committee]] meeting, and did not respond to repeated telephone calls and e-mails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Virginia state medical examiner's office said in a report that Gillmor died from blunt head and neck trauma consistent with a fall down the stairs.  Police assessed the scene and ruled out foul play.  Gillmor's death was ruled an accident.&lt;ref&gt;John McCarthy, [http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2007Sep07/0,4670,OhioCongressman,00.html "Report: Congressman Likely Fell to Death"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911114425/http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2007Sep07/0,4670,OhioCongressman,00.html |date=2007-09-11 }}, Associated Press (Fox News), September 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a special election held in December, [[Bob Latta]], the man Gillmor had narrowly defeated in the 1988 primary, won the seat.

'''Poco Lena''' (1949–1968) was an outstanding [[Cutting (sport)|cutting]] mare, and dam of two famous [[Quarter horse]] cutting horses and [[stallion]]s: [[Doc O'Lena]] and [[Dry Doc]].&lt;ref name=Legends3&gt;Swan ''Legends 3'' pp. 98–111&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

Poco Lena was foaled in 1949, the daughter of [[Poco Bueno]] out of a daughter of Pretty Boy named Sheilwin.  She traced to [[Peter McCue (horse)|Peter McCue]] on both her sire's and her dam's side.&lt;ref name=Pedigree&gt;''[http://www.allbreedpedigree.com/poco+lena Poco Lena Pedigree at All Breed Pedigree]''&lt;/ref&gt;

With the [[American Quarter Horse Association]] (or AQHA) Poco Lena earned her AQHA Championship, a Performance Register of Merit, a Superior Cutting Horse award and a Superior Halter Horse award.&lt;ref name=QHR&gt;Wagoner ''Quarter Horse Reference 1974 Edition'' p. 544&lt;/ref&gt; She was also the AQHA High Point Cutting Horse in 1959, 1960, and 1961.&lt;ref name=QHR/&gt; With the [[National Cutting Horse Association]] (or NCHA) she earned a total of $99,819.61 in cutting contests in her career.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.nchacutting.com/my-ncha/check-earnings Poco Lena NCHA Earnings]''&lt;/ref&gt; She earned a Certificate of Ability, as well as a Bronze and a Silver Award with the NCHA.&lt;ref name=Pitzer&gt;Pitzer ''Most Influential Quarter Horse Sires'' p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; She was also inducted into the NCHA Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.nchacutting.com/members/hall-of-fame-awards NCHA Hall of Fame]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1961, Poco Lena [[laminitis|foundered]]. She recovered, and was showing well when in October 1962 her owner, B. A. Skipper Jr., died in a plane crash. In the confusion, Poco Lena was left in a trailer for four days without food or water. She foundered again, and never competed again.&lt;ref name=Legends3/&gt; Eventually she was bought by the owners of [[Doc Bar]], Dr. and Mrs. Stephen Jensen. After much nursing and effort, Poco Lena produced two [[foals]] when bred to Doc Bar – Doc O'Lena and Dry Doc, both of whom won the NCHA Cutting Futurity.&lt;ref name=Legends3/&gt; However, Poco Lena's founder deteriorated after the birth of Dry Doc, and on December 16, 1968 she was [[Animal euthanasia|euthanized]].&lt;ref name=Legends3/&gt;

Poco Lena was inducted into the [[American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame|AQHA Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Poco Lena |url=https://www.aqha.com/museum/hall-of-fame/horses/p/poco-lena/ |work= AQHA Hall of Fame |author=American Quarter Horse Association (AQHA) |publisher=American Quarter Horse Association |accessdate=September 2, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Poultry of the world.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Poultry of the World]]
'''Poultry''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|oʊ|l|t|r|i}}) are [[domestication|domesticated]] [[bird]]s kept by humans for their [[egg (food)|eggs]], their [[meat]] or their [[feather]]s. These birds are most typically members of the [[Superorder (biology)|superorder]] [[Fowl|Galloanserae (fowl)]], especially the order [[Galliformes]] (which includes [[chicken]]s, [[quail]]s, and [[domestic turkey|turkey]]s).

Poultry also includes other birds that are killed for their meat, such as the young of [[pigeon]]s (known as [[Squab (food)|squabs]]) but does not include similar wild birds hunted for sport or food and known as [[Game (food)|game]]. The word "poultry" comes from the French/Norman word ''poule'', itself derived from the Latin word ''pullus'', which means small animal.

The domestication of poultry took place several thousand years ago. This may have originally been as a result of people hatching and rearing young birds from eggs collected from the wild, but later involved keeping the birds permanently in captivity. Domesticated chickens may have been used for [[cockfight]]ing at first and quail kept for their songs, but soon it was realised how useful it was having a captive-bred source of food. 

Selective breeding for fast growth, egg-laying ability, conformation, plumage and docility took place over the centuries, and modern [[breed]]s often look very different from their wild ancestors. Although some birds are still kept in small flocks in extensive systems, most birds available in the market today are reared in intensive commercial enterprises. 

Together with pig meat, poultry is one of the two most widely eaten types of meat globally, with over 70% of the meat supply in 2012 between them;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/themes/images/meat/backgr_sources_data.jpg |title=Sources of the world`s meat supply in 2012 |publisher=FAO |accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; poultry provides nutritionally beneficial food containing high-quality protein accompanied by a low proportion of fat. All poultry meat should be properly handled and sufficiently cooked in order to reduce the risk of [[food poisoning]].

The word "poultry" comes from the Middle English "pultrie", from Old French ''pouletrie'', from ''pouletier'', poultry dealer, from ''poulet'', pullet.&lt;ref name=AH/&gt; The word "pullet" itself comes from Middle English ''pulet'', from Old French ''polet'', both from Latin ''pullus'', a young fowl, young animal or chicken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary | title = Pullet | encyclopedia = The American Heritage: Dictionary of the English Language | volume = 4th edition | pages = | publisher = Houghton Mifflin Company | year = 2009 | url = http://www.thefreedictionary.com/pullet}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=fowl |title=Fowl | work=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com  |accessdate=February 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word "fowl" is of Germanic origin (cf. Old English ''Fugol'', German ''Vogel'', Danish ''Fugl'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=poultry |title=Poultry | work=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |accessdate=February 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
"Poultry" is a term used for any kind of [[Domestication|domesticated]] bird, captive-raised for its utility, and traditionally the word has been used to refer to wildfowl ([[Galliformes]]) and waterfowl ([[Anseriformes]]) but not to [[cagebirds]] such as [[songbirds]] and [[parrots]]. "Poultry" can be defined as domestic fowls, including chickens, turkeys, geese and ducks, raised for the production of meat or eggs and the word is also used for the flesh of these birds used as food.&lt;ref name=AH&gt;{{cite dictionary | title = Poultry | encyclopedia = The American Heritage: Dictionary of the English Language | volume = 4th edition | publisher = Houghton Mifflin Company | year = 2009 | url = http://www.thefreedictionary.com/poultry}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Encyclopædia Britannica lists the same bird groups but also includes guinea fowl and squabs (young pigeons).&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title = Poultry | encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Britannica | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. | date = June 6, 2013 | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/472991/poultry }}&lt;/ref&gt; In R. D. Crawford's ''Poultry breeding and genetics'', squabs are omitted but [[Japanese quail]] and [[common pheasant]] are added to the list, the latter frequently being bred in captivity and released into the wild.&lt;ref name=Crawford&gt;{{cite book |title=Poultry Breeding and Genetics |last=Crawford |first=R. D. |year=1990 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=0-444-88557-9 |page=1 |url=http://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/19900183085.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1848 classic book on poultry, ''Ornamental and Domestic Poultry: Their History, and Management'', Edmund Dixon included chapters on the [[peafowl]], [[guinea fowl]], [[mute swan]], [[turkey (bird)|turkey]], various types of [[geese]], the muscovy duck, other ducks and all types of chickens including bantams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ornamental and Domestic Poultry: Their History, and Management |last=Dixon |first=Rev Edmund Saul |year=1848 |publisher=Gardeners' Chronicle |page=1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z7E9AAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=poultry+history&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Zf35UvH6GpOzhAeF34CAAQ&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=poultry%20history&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In colloquial speech, the term "fowl" is often used near-synonymously with "domesticated chicken" (''Gallus gallus''), or with "poultry" or even just "bird", and many languages do not distinguish between "poultry" and "fowl". Both words are also used for the flesh of these birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Fowl | work= The Free Dictionary | publisher = thefreedictionary.com | url = http://www.thefreedictionary.com/fowl | accessdate=February 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poultry can be distinguished from "game", defined as wild birds or mammals hunted for food or sport, a word also used to describe the flesh of these when eaten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary | title = Game | encyclopedia = Oxford Dictionaries | publisher = Oxford University Press | url = http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/game}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rooster portrait2.jpg|upright|thumb|right|Cock with comb and wattles]]
Chickens are medium-sized, chunky birds with an upright stance and characterised by fleshy red [[Comb (anatomy)|combs]] and [[Wattle (anatomy)|wattles]] on their heads. Males, known as cocks, are usually larger, more boldly coloured, and have more exaggerated plumage than females (hens). Chickens are gregarious, [[Omnivore|omnivorous]], ground-dwelling birds that in their natural surroundings search among the leaf litter for seeds, invertebrates, and other small animals. They seldom fly except as a result of perceived danger, preferring to run into the undergrowth if approached.&lt;ref name=Card/&gt; Today's domestic chicken (''Gallus gallus domesticus'') is mainly descended from the wild [[red junglefowl]] of Asia, with some additional input from  [[grey junglefowl]].&lt;ref name= Eriksson&gt;{{Citation | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000010.eor | last1 = Eriksson | first1 = Jonas | last2 = Larson | first2 = Greger | last3 = Gunnarsson | first3 = Ulrika | last4 = Bed'hom | first4 = Bertrand | last5 = Tixier-Boichard | first5 = Michele | last6 = Strömstedt | first6 = Lina | last7 = Wright | first7 = Dominic | author8 = Eriksson J, Larson G, Gunnarsson U, Bed'hom B, Tixier-Boichard M | last9 = Vereijken | first9 = Addie | last10 = Randi | first10 = Ettore | last11 = Jensen | first11 = Per | last12 = Andersson | first12 = Leif | title = Identification of the yellow skin gene reveals a hybrid origin of the domestic chicken | pages = e1000010 | year = 2008 | journal = PLoS Genetics |volume=4 | issue=2|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Domestication]] is believed to have taken place between 7,000 and 10,000 years ago, and what are thought to be fossilized chicken bones have been found in northeastern China dated to around 5,400 BC. Archaeologists believe domestication was originally for the purpose of [[cockfight]]ing, the male bird being a doughty fighter. By 4,000 years ago, chickens seem to have reached the [[Indus Valley]] and 250 years later, they arrived in Egypt. They were still used for fighting and were regarded as symbols of fertility. The Romans used them in [[divination]], and the Egyptians made a breakthrough when they learned the difficult technique of artificial [[Egg incubation|incubation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=How the Chicken Conquered the World |author1=Adler, Jerry |author2=Lawler, Andrew |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/how-the-chicken-conquered-the-world-87583657/?no-ist |newspaper=Smithsonian Magazine |date=June 1, 2012 |accessdate=April 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the keeping of chickens has spread around the world for the production of food with the domestic fowl being a valuable source of both eggs and meat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Storey, A.

Since their domestication, a large number of breeds of chickens have been established, but with the exception of the [[Leghorn (chicken)|white Leghorn]], most commercial birds are of [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] origin.&lt;ref name=Card&gt;{{cite book |title=Poultry Production |last=Card |first=Leslie E. |year=1961 |publisher=Lea &amp; Febiger |isbn=978-0-8121-1241-2 |url=http://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/19610102428.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; In about 1800, chickens began to be kept on a larger scale, and modern high-output poultry farms were present in the United Kingdom from around 1920 and became established in the United States soon after the [[World War II|Second World War]]. By the mid-20th century, the [[poultry industry|poultry meat-producing industry]] was of greater importance than the egg-laying industry. Poultry breeding has produced breeds and strains to fulfil different needs; light-framed, egg-laying birds that can produce 300 eggs a year; fast-growing, fleshy birds destined for consumption at a young age, and utility birds which produce both an acceptable number of eggs and a well-fleshed carcase. Male birds are unwanted in the egg-laying industry and can often be identified as soon as they are hatch for subsequent culling. In meat breeds, these birds are sometimes castrated (often chemically) to prevent aggression.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt;  The resulting bird, called a [[capon]], has more tender and flavorful meat, as well.&lt;ref name="Basley"&gt;{{cite book |title=Western poultry book |author=Mrs A Basley |year=1910 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=10JDAAAAIAAJ |pages=112–15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Cockfight Santangelo MAN Napoli.jpg|thumb|right|Roman mosaic depicting a cockfight]]
A [[Bantam (poultry)|bantam]] is a small variety of domestic chicken, either a miniature version of a member of a standard [[breed]], or a "true bantam" with no larger counterpart. The name derives from the town of [[Banten (town)|Bantam]] in Java&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=bantam&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |accessdate=February 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; where European sailors bought the local small chickens for their shipboard supplies. Bantams may be a quarter to a third of the size of standard birds and lay similarly small eggs. They are kept by small-holders and hobbyists for egg production, use as broody hens, ornamental purposes, and showing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.poultryclub.org/breed-gallery/ |title=Breed gallery |publisher=The Poultry Club of Great Britain |accessdate=February 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cockfighting===
[[Cockfight]]ing is said to be the world's oldest spectator sport and may have originated in Persia 6,000 years ago. Two mature males (cocks or roosters) are set to fight each other, and will do so with great vigour until one is critically injured or killed. Breeds such as the [[Asil (chicken)|Aseel]] were developed in the Indian subcontinent for their aggressive behaviour. The sport formed part of the culture of the ancient Indians, Chinese, Greeks, and Romans, and large sums were won or lost depending on the outcome of an encounter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aseellovers.20m.com/custom.html |title=History of Aseel |author=Nadeem Ullah |accessdate=February 15, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227163240/http://www.aseellovers.20m.com/custom.html |archivedate=February 27, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cockfighting has been banned in many countries during the last century on the grounds of cruelty to animals.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt;

==Ducks==
{{main article|Domestic duck}}
Ducks are medium-sized aquatic birds with broad bills, eyes on the side of the head, fairly long necks, short legs set far back on the body, and webbed feet. Males, known as drakes, are often larger than females (simply known as ducks) and are differently coloured in some breeds. Domestic ducks are [[omnivore]]s, eating a variety of animal and plant materials such as aquatic insects, molluscs, worms, small amphibians, waterweeds, and grasses. They feed in shallow water by dabbling, with their heads underwater and their tails upended. Most domestic ducks are too heavy to fly, and they are social birds, preferring to live and move around together in groups. They keep their plumage waterproof by preening, a process that spreads the secretions of the [[Uropygial gland|preen gland]] over their feathers.&lt;ref name=RSPCA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rspca.org.uk/ImageLocator/LocateAsset?asset=document&amp;assetId=1232730067367&amp;mode=prd |title=Information sheet: The Welfare of Farmed Ducks |date=July 1, 2012 |publisher=RSPCA |accessdate=March 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pekin Ducks cropped.jpg|thumb|right|Pekin ducks]]
Clay models of ducks found in China dating back to 4000 BC may indicate the domestication of ducks took place there during the [[Yangshao culture]]. Even if this is not the case, domestication of the duck took place in the Far East at least 1500 years earlier than in the West. [[Columella|Lucius Columella]], writing in the first century BC, advised those who sought to rear ducks to collect wildfowl eggs and put them under a broody hen, because when raised in this way, the ducks "lay aside their wild nature and without hesitation breed when shut up in the bird pen". Despite this, ducks did not appear in agricultural texts in Western Europe until about 810 AD, when they began to be mentioned alongside geese, chickens, and peafowl as being used for rental payments made by tenants to landowners.&lt;ref name=Cherry&gt;{{cite book |title=Domestic Duck Production: Science and Practice |last=Cherry |first=Peter |last2=Morris |first2=T. R. |year=2008 |publisher=CABI |isbn=978-1-84593-441-5 |pages=1–7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=48sgHPrbUiQC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;dq=Duck+domestication&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EHad6VP4wy&amp;sig=BfH8ymuztpFmHwYIbmJsBfzbO_c&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QgIBU__jJsau7AbSroGwDQ&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Duck%20domestication&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is widely agreed that the [[mallard]] (''Anas platyrhynchos'') is the ancestor of all breeds of domestic duck (with the exception of the [[Muscovy duck]] (''Cairina moschata''), which is not closely related to other ducks).&lt;ref name=Cherry/&gt; Ducks are farmed mainly for their meat, eggs, and [[Down feather|down]].&lt;ref name=Dean/&gt; As is the case with chickens, various breeds have been developed, selected for egg-laying ability, fast growth, and a well-covered carcase. The most common commercial breed in the United Kingdom and the United States is the [[American Pekin duck|Pekin duck]], which can lay 200 eggs a year and can reach a weight of {{convert|3.5|kg|1|abbr=on}} in 44 days.&lt;ref name=RSPCA/&gt; In the [[Western world]], ducks are not as popular as chickens, because the latter produce larger quantities of white, lean meat and are easier to keep intensively, making the price of [[chicken meat]] lower than that of duck meat. While popular in ''[[haute cuisine]]'', duck appears less frequently in the mass-market food industry. However, things are different in the East. Ducks are more popular there than chickens and are mostly still herded in the traditional way and selected for their ability to find sufficient food in harvested rice fields and other wet environments.&lt;ref name=Dean&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.duckhealth.com/dmstduck.html |title=Domestic ducks |author1=Dean, William F. |author2=Sandhu, Tirath S. |year=2008 |publisher=Cornell University |accessdate=February 15, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015173440/http://www.duckhealth.com/dmstduck.html |archivedate=October 15, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geese==
[[File:Domestic Goose.jpg|thumb|left|upright|An [[Emden goose]], a descendant of the wild [[greylag goose]]]]
The [[greylag goose]] (''Anser anser'') was domesticated by the Egyptians at least 3000 years ago,&lt;ref name=faogeese&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/005/Y4359E/y4359e03.htm |title=Origins and Breeds of Domestic Geese |author1=Buckland, R. |author2=Guy, G. |publisher=FAO Agriculture Department |accessdate=February 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a different wild species, the [[swan goose]] (''Anser cygnoides''), domesticated in Siberia about a thousand years later, is known as a [[Chinese goose]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bird-friends.com/BirdPage.php?name=White%20Chinese%20Goose |title=White Chinese Goose |author=Streit, Scott |year=2000 |work=Bird Friends Of San Diego County |accessdate=February 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]ise with each other and the large knob at the base of the beak, a noticeable feature of the Chinese goose, is present to a varying extent in these hybrids. The hybrids are fertile and have resulted in several of the modern breeds. Despite their early domestication, geese have never gained the commercial importance of chickens and ducks.&lt;ref name=faogeese/&gt;

Domestic geese are much larger than their wild counterparts and tend to have thick necks, an upright posture, and large bodies with broad rear ends. The greylag-derived birds are large and fleshy and used for meat, while the Chinese geese have smaller frames and are mainly used for egg production. The fine down of both is valued for use in pillows and padded garments. They forage on grass and weeds, supplementing this with small invertebrates, and one of the attractions of rearing geese is their ability to grow and thrive on a grass-based system.&lt;ref name=CALU/&gt; They are very gregarious and have good memories and can be allowed to roam widely in the knowledge that they will return home by dusk. The Chinese goose is more aggressive and noisy than other geese and can be used as a guard animal to warn of intruders.&lt;ref name=faogeese/&gt; The flesh of meat geese is dark-coloured and high in protein, but they deposit fat subcutaneously, although this fat contains mostly [[Monounsaturated fats|monounsaturated fatty acids]]. The birds are killed either around 10 or about 24 weeks. Between these ages, problems with dressing the carcase occur because of the presence of developing [[pin feather]]s.&lt;ref name=CALU&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.calu.bangor.ac.uk/Technical%20leaflets/040803seasonalgeese.pdf |title=CALU factsheet: Meat geese seasonal production |date=June 1, 2009 |accessdate=March 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some countries, geese and ducks are force-fed to produce livers with an exceptionally high fat content for the production of ''[[foie gras]]''. Over 75% of world production of this product occurs in France, with lesser industries in Hungary and Bulgaria and a growing production in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=China to boost foie gras production |author=Mo Hong'e |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2006-04/11/content_4409586.htm |newspaper=China View |date=April 11, 2006 |accessdate=March 9, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070602122944/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2006-04/11/content_4409586.htm |archivedate=June 2, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Foie gras'' is considered a luxury in many parts of the world, but the process of feeding the birds in this way is banned in many countries on animal welfare grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://foodfancy.net/docs/out17_en.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219011901/http://foodfancy.net/docs/out17_en.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=December 19, 2013 |title=Welfare Aspects of the Production of Foie Gras in Ducks and Geese |date=December 16, 1998 |work=Report of the Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare |accessdate=March 9, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Turkeys==
{{main article|Domesticated turkey}}
[[File:Turkeybird.JPG|thumb|Male domesticated turkey sexually displaying by showing the snood hanging over the beak, the caruncles hanging from the throat, and the 'beard' of small, black, stiff feathers on the chest]]
Turkeys are large birds, their nearest relatives being the pheasant and the guineafowl. Males are larger than females and have spreading, fan-shaped tails and distinctive, fleshy [[Wattle (anatomy)|wattle]]s, called a [[Snood (anatomy)|snood]], that hang from the top of the beak and are used in courtship display. Wild turkeys can fly, but seldom do so, preferring to run with a long, stratling gait. They roost in trees and forage on the ground, feeding on seeds, nuts, berries, grass, foliage, invertebrates, lizards, and small snakes.&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt;

The modern domesticated turkey is descended from one of six [[subspecies]] of [[wild turkey]] (''Meleagris gallopavo'') found in the present Mexican states of [[Jalisco]], [[Guerrero]] and [[Veracruz]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan. 2008. [http://www.globaltwitcher.com/artspec_information.asp?thingid=2199 ''Wild turkey: Meleagris gallopavo'', GlobalTwitcher.com, ed. N.

They used the feathers for robes, blankets, and ceremonial purposes.  More than 1,000 years later, they became an important food source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Native Americans First Tamed Turkeys 2,000 Years Ago |author=Viegas, Jennifer |url=http://news.discovery.com/history/us-history/native-americans-turkeys-domestication.htm |newspaper= |date=February 1, 2010 |accessdate=February 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first Europeans to encounter the bird misidentified it as a guineafowl, a bird known as a "turkey fowl" at that time because it had been introduced into Europe via Turkey.&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;{{cite book |title=The Turkey: An American Story |last=Smith |first=Andrew F. |year=2006 |publisher=University of Illinois Press |isbn=978-0-252-03163-2 |pages=4–5, 17 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J0L3PdUtydEC&amp;pg=PT48&amp;dq=turkey+bird+name&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=turkey%20bird%20name&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercial turkeys are usually reared indoors under controlled conditions. These are often large buildings, purpose-built to provide ventilation and low light intensities (this reduces the birds' activity and thereby increases the rate of weight gain).  The lights can be switched on for 24-hrs/day, or a range of step-wise light regimens to encourage the birds to feed often and therefore grow rapidly. Females achieve slaughter weight at about 15 weeks of age and males at about 19. Mature commercial birds may be twice as heavy as their wild counterparts. Many different breeds have been developed, but the majority of commercial birds are white, as this improves the appearance of the dressed carcass, the [[pin feather]]s being less visible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Turkeys: Behavior, Management and Well-Being|last=Pond |first=Wilson, G. |last2=Bell |first2=Alan, W.

However, they are increasingly becoming part of the everyday diet in many parts of the world.

==Quail==
[[File:Japanese Quail.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Japanese quail]]
The quail is a small to medium-sized, cryptically coloured bird. In its natural environment, it is found in bushy places, in rough grassland, among agricultural crops, and in other places with dense cover. It feeds on seeds, insects, and other small invertebrates.&lt;ref name=ILAR&gt;{{cite book |title=Coturnix (''Coturnix coturnix japonica''): standards and guidelines for the breeding, care, and management of laboratory animals |last=Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources (U.S.).

It was known to the Egyptians long before the arrival of chickens and was depicted in [[hieroglyph]]s from 2575 BC. It [[Bird migration|migrated]] across Egypt in vast flocks and the birds could sometimes be picked up off the ground by hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Quail, Past and Present |last=Roberts |first=Michael |year=1999 |publisher=Domestic Fowl Research |isbn=0-947870-12-1 |pages=11–18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These were the [[common quail]] (''Coturnix coturnix''), but modern domesticated flocks are mostly of [[Japanese quail]] (''Coturnix japonica'') which was probably domesticated as early as the 11th century AD in Japan. They were originally kept as songbirds, and they are thought to have been regularly used in song contests.&lt;ref name=Mills&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mills |first=A. D. |last2=Crawford |first2=L.

In the early 20th century, Japanese breeders began to selectively breed for increased egg production. By 1940, the quail egg industry was flourishing, but the events of [[World War II]] led to the complete loss of quail lines bred for their song type, as well as almost all of those bred for egg production. After the war, the few surviving domesticated quail were used to rebuild the industry, and all current commercial and laboratory lines are considered to have originated from this population.&lt;ref name=Mills/&gt; Modern birds can lay upward of 300 eggs a year and countries such as Japan, India, China, Italy, Russia, and the United States have established commercial Japanese quail farming industries.&lt;ref name=Hubrecht&gt;{{cite book|last=Hubrecht |first=R. |last2=Kirkwood |first2=J. |title=[[UFAW Handbook|The UFAW Handbook on the Care and Management of Laboratory and Other Research Animals]] |year=2010 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |pages=655–674}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese quail are also used in biomedical research in fields such as [[genetics]], [[embryology]], [[nutrition]], [[physiology]], [[pathology]], and [[toxicity]] studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=''Coturnix (Coturnix coturnix japonica)'': standards and guidelines for the breeding, care, and management of laboratory animals |year=1969 |publisher=National Academy of Sciences |pages=1–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; These quail are closely related to the common quail, and many young [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] birds are released into the wild each year to replenish dwindling wild populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Puigcerver, Manel |author2=Vinyoles, Dolors |author3=Rodríguez-Teijeiro, José Domingo |year=2007 |title=Does restocking with Japanese quail or hybrids affect native populations of common quail ''Coturnix coturnix''? |journal=Biological Conservation |volume=136 |issue=4 |pages=628–635 |doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2007.01.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other poultry==
Guinea fowl originated in southern Africa, and the species most often kept as poultry is the [[helmeted guineafowl]] (''Numida meleagris''). It is a medium-sized grey or speckled bird with a small naked head with colourful wattles and a knob on top, and was [[Domesticated guineafowl|domesticated]] by the time of the ancient Greeks and Romans. Guinea fowl are hardy, sociable birds that subsist mainly on insects, but also consume grasses and seeds. They will keep a vegetable garden clear of pests and will eat the ticks that carry [[Lyme disease]]. They happily roost in trees and give a loud vocal warning of the approach of predators. Their flesh and eggs can be eaten in the same way as chickens, young birds being ready for the table at the age of about four months.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ca.uky.edu/agc/pubs/ASC/ASC209/ASC209.pdf |title=Keeping Guinea fowl |author1=Jacob, Jacquie |author2=Pescatore, Tony |author3=Cantor, Austin |publisher=University of Kentucky |accessdate=March 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Squab (food)|squab]] is the name given to the young of domestic pigeons that are destined for the table. Like other domesticated pigeons, birds used for this purpose are descended from the [[rock pigeon]] (''Columba livia''). Special [[Utility pigeon|utility breeds]] with desirable characteristics are used. Two eggs are laid and incubated for about 17 days. When they hatch, the squabs are fed by both parents on "pigeon's milk", a thick secretion high in protein produced by the [[Crop (anatomy)|crop]]. Squabs grow rapidly, but are slow to fledge and are ready to leave the nest at 26 to 30 days weighing about {{convert|500|g|0|abbr=on}}. By this time, the adult pigeons will have laid and be incubating another pair of eggs and a prolific pair should produce two squabs every four weeks during a  breeding season lasting several months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/213221/Squab-raising.pdf |title=Primefacts: Squab raising |author=Bolla, Gerry |date=April 1, 2007 |issn=1832-6668 |publisher=NSW Department of Primary Industries |accessdate=March 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poultry farming==
{{main article|Poultry farming}}

This is still the case in developing countries, where the women often make important contributions to family livelihoods through keeping poultry. However, rising world populations and urbanization have led to the bulk of production being in larger, more intensive specialist units. These are often situated close to where the feed is grown or near to where the meat is needed, and result in cheap, safe food being made available for urban communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/themes/en/poultry/home.html |title=Animal production and health: Poultry |date=September 25, 2012 |publisher=FAO |accessdate=February 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Profitability of production depends very much on the price of feed, which has been rising. High feed costs could limit further development of poultry production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Agritrade|title=Poultry Brief 2013|url=http://agritrade.cta.int/Agriculture/Commodities/Poultry/Executive-Brief-Update-2013-Poultry-sector|publisher=CTA|accessdate=February 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[free-range]] husbandry, the birds can roam freely outdoors for at least part of the day. Often, this is in large enclosures, but the birds have access to natural conditions and can exhibit their normal behaviours. A more intensive system is [[yarding]], in which the birds have access to a fenced yard and [[Chicken coop|poultry house]] at a higher stocking rate. Poultry can also be kept in a barn system, with no access to the open air, &lt;!-- (or predators and disease-carrying wild birds), --&gt; but with the ability to move around freely inside the building. The most intensive system for egg-laying chickens is battery cages, often set in multiple tiers. In these, several birds share a small cage which restricts their ability to move around and behave in a normal manner. The eggs are laid on the floor of the cage and roll into troughs outside for ease of collection. Battery cages for hens have been illegal in the [[European Union|EU]] since January 1, 2012.&lt;ref name=Compassion/&gt;

Chickens raised intensively for their meat are known as "broilers". Breeds have been developed that can grow to an acceptable carcass size ({{convert|2|kg|1|abbr=on}}) in six weeks or less.&lt;ref name=Browne/&gt;  Broilers grow so fast, their legs cannot always support their weight and their hearts and respiratory systems may not be able to supply enough oxygen to their developing muscles. Mortality rates at 1% are much higher than for less-intensively reared laying birds which take 18 weeks to reach similar weights.&lt;ref name=Browne&gt;{{cite news |title=Ten weeks to live |author=Browne, Anthony |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2002/mar/10/foodanddrink.features1 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=March 10, 2002 |accessdate=February 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Processing the birds is done automatically with conveyor-belt efficiency. They are hung by their feet, stunned, killed, bled, scalded, plucked, have their heads and feet removed, eviscerated, washed, chilled, drained, weighed, and packed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.poultryhub.org/anatomy-and-physiology/meat-chicken-farm-sequence/ | title=Meat chicken farm sequence (processing) | publisher=Poultry Hub | date=August 20, 2010 | accessdate=February 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; all within the course of little over two hours.&lt;ref name=Browne/&gt;

Both intensive and free-range farming have animal welfare concerns. In intensive systems, [[Cannibalism (poultry)|cannibalism]], [[feather pecking]] and [[vent pecking]] can be common, with some farmers using [[debeaking|beak trimming]] as a preventative measure.&lt;ref name=Sherwin&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Sherwin, C.

In extensive systems, the birds are exposed to adverse weather conditions and are vulnerable to predators and disease-carrying wild birds. Barn systems have been found to have the worst bird welfare.&lt;ref name=Sherwin/&gt; In [[Southeast Asia]], a lack of disease control in free-range farming has been associated with outbreaks of [[avian influenza]].&lt;ref name=WSPA&gt;{{cite web | url=http://wspa-international.org/publicfiles/Free_range_farming_and_avian_flu__3_.pdf | title=Free-range farming and avian flu in Asia | publisher=WSPA International | accessdate=February 12, 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216083304/http://www.wspa-international.org/publicfiles/Free_range_farming_and_avian_flu__3_.pdf | archivedate=December 16, 2013 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poultry shows==
In many countries, national and regional poultry shows are held where enthusiasts exhibit their birds which are judged on certain [[phenotype|phenotypical]] [[breed]] traits as specified by their respective [[breed standard]]s. The idea of poultry exhibition may have originated after cockfighting was made illegal, as a way of maintaining a competitive element in poultry husbandry. Breed standards were drawn up for egg-laying, meat-type, and purely ornamental birds, aiming for uniformity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.poultryclub.org/poultry/history-of-poultry/ |title=History of poultry |publisher=Poultry Club of Great Britain |accessdate=February 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, poultry shows are part of general [[livestock show]]s, and sometimes they are separate events such as the annual "National Championship Show" in the United Kingdom organised by the [[Poultry Club of Great Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.poultryclub.org/showing/types-of-show/ |title=Types of Show |publisher=Poultry Club of Great Britain |accessdate=February 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- THIS SHOW HAS NO LIVE POULTRY COMPETITION In the United States, the largest show was the International Poultry Expo organized by the [[U.S. Poultry and Egg Association]]. In 2013, this was amalgamated with the International Feed Expo and the International Meat Expo to give the world's largest livestock trade fair, the International Production and Processing Expo. IPPE attracts exhibitors from around the world and includes an International Poultry Scientific Forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ippexpo.com/ |title=International Production &amp; Processing Expo |accessdate=February 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

Poultry is the second most widely eaten type of meat in the world, accounting for about 30% of total meat production worldwide compared to [[pork]] at 38%. Sixteen billion birds are raised annually for consumption, more than half of these in industrialised, factory-like production units.&lt;ref name="sciencenews.org"&gt;Raloff, Janet.

The largest producers were the United States (20%), China (16.6%), Brazil (15.1%) and the European Union (11.3%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thepoultrysite.com/reports/?id=1788 |title=USDA Livestock &amp; Poultry: World Markets &amp; Trade  |date=April 30, 2013 |publisher=The Poultry Site |accessdate=February 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two distinct models of production; the European Union [[supply chain]] model seeks to supply products which can be traced back to the farm of origin. This model faces the increasing costs of implementing additional food safety requirements, welfare issues and environmental regulations. In contrast, the United States model turns the product into a commodity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Manning, Louise |author2=Baines, R. N. |author3=Chadd, S.

===Cuts of poultry===
[[File:MIN Rungis volaille.jpg|thumb|In the poultry pavilion of the  [[Marché d'Intérêt National de Rungis|Rungis International Market]], France]]
Poultry is available fresh or frozen, as whole birds or as joints (cuts), bone-in or deboned, seasoned in various ways, raw or ready cooked.&lt;ref name=FeedCo/&gt; The meatiest parts of a bird are the [[flight]] [[muscle]]s on its chest, called "breast" meat, and the [[walking]] muscles on the [[leg (anatomy)|leg]]s, called the "thigh" and "drumstick". The wings are also eaten ([[Buffalo wing]]s are a popular example in the United States) and may be split into three segments, the meatier "drumette", the "wingette" (also called the "flat"), and the wing tip (also called the "flapper").&lt;ref name=FeedCo&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.feedcousa.com/poultrymeatcuts.htm |title=Poultry meat cuts |publisher=FeedCo USA |accessdate=March 1, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130430031413/http://www.feedcousa.com/poultrymeatcuts.htm |archive-date=April 30, 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chow.com/food-news/105062/america-youre-getting-two-thirds-of-the-chicken-wing/ |title=America, You're Getting Two-Thirds of the Hot Wing |accessdate=April 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Japan, the wing is frequently separated, and these parts are referred to as 手羽元 (''teba-moto'' "wing base") and 手羽先 (''teba-saki'' "wing tip").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=日本料理用語辞典 (英文): Ingredients &amp; Culture |last=Hosking |first=Richard|year=1996 |publisher=Tuttle Publishing |isbn=978-0-8048-2042-4 |page=156 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1avA7zEYCQ0C&amp;pg=PA156&amp;lpg=PA156&amp;dq=teba-moto+teba-saki&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8A4AcgHlzF&amp;sig=h1DI13kcemqZd081UXYstkzGnnc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=N8URU_6IIY-qhQfSoYDQCQ&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=teba-moto%20teba-saki&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dark meat, which avian [[myologist]]s refer to as "red muscle", is used for sustained activity—chiefly walking, in the case of a chicken. The dark colour comes from the protein [[myoglobin]], which plays a key role in oxygen uptake and storage within cells. White muscle, in contrast, is suitable only for short bursts of activity such as, for chickens, flying. Thus, the chicken's leg and thigh meat are dark, while its breast meat (which makes up the primary flight muscles) is white. Other birds with breast muscle more suitable for sustained flight, such as ducks and geese, have red muscle (and therefore dark meat) throughout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dwb.unl.edu/teacher/nsf/c10/c10links/www.fsis.usda.gov/oa/pubs/mpcolor.htm |title=The color of meat and poultry |date=May 1, 2000 |publisher=USDA: Food Safety and Inspection Service |accessdate=March 1, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130607080043/http://dwb.unl.edu/Teacher/NSF/C10/C10Links/www.fsis.usda.gov/oa/pubs/mpcolor.htm |archivedate=June 7, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some cuts of meat including poultry expose the microscopic regular structure of intracellular [[Myofibrils|muscle fibrils]] which can [[diffraction|diffract]] light and produce [[iridescent]] colours, an optical phenomenon sometimes called [[structural colouration]].&lt;ref name=foods&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/2/4/499 | title=Foods | work=Iridescence in Meat Caused by Surface Gratings | year=2013 | author=Martinez-Hurtado, J.

==Health and disease (humans)==
[[File:LemonChicken2.jpg|thumb|left|Cuts from plucked [[Chicken (food)|chickens]]]]
Poultry meat and eggs provide nutritionally beneficial food containing protein of high quality. This is accompanied by low levels of fat which have a favourable mix of fatty acids.&lt;ref name=FAOhealth&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/themes/en/poultry/human_health.html |title=Poultry and human health |date=August 1, 2013 |publisher=FAO |accessdate=February 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chicken meat contains about two to three times as much [[polyunsaturated fat]] as most types of [[red meat]] when measured by weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nuinfo-proto4.northwestern.edu/nutrition/factsheets/lipids.html |title=Feinberg School: Nutrition Fact Sheet: Lipids |publisher=Northwestern University |accessdate=August 24, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720014201/http://nuinfo-proto4.northwestern.edu/nutrition/factsheets/lipids.html |archivedate=July 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, for boneless, skinless chicken breast, the amount is much lower. A 100-g serving of baked chicken breast contains 4 g of fat and 31 g of protein, compared to 10 g of fat and 27 g of protein for the same portion of broiled, lean skirt steak.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/poultry-products/703/2 Nutrition Data - 100g Chicken Breast]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/beef-products/3820/2 Nutrition Data - 100g Lean Skirt Steak]&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 study by the [[Translational Genomics Research Institute]] showed that 47% of the [[meat]] and poultry sold in [[United States]] grocery stores was contaminated with ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', and 52% of the bacteria concerned showed resistance to at least three groups of antibiotics. Thorough cooking of the product would kill these bacteria, but a risk of cross-contamination from improper handling of the raw product is still present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=US meat and poultry is widely contaminated with drug-resistant Staph bacteria, study finds |author=The Translational Genomics Research Institute |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/04/110415083153.htm |newspaper=Science Daily |date=April 15, 2011 |accessdate=February 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, some risk is present for consumers of poultry meat and eggs to bacterial infections such as ''[[Salmonella]]'' and ''[[Campylobacter]]''. Poultry products may become contaminated by these bacteria during handling, processing, marketing, or storage, resulting in [[food-borne illness]] if the product is improperly cooked or handled.&lt;ref name=FAOhealth/&gt;&lt;!-- these species do not cause food poisoning like Staph --&gt;

In general, [[avian influenza]] is a disease of birds caused by bird-specific [[influenza A virus]] that is not normally transferred to people; however, people in contact with live poultry are at the greatest risk of becoming infected with the virus and this is of particular concern in areas such as Southeast Asia, where the disease is [[Endemism|endemic]] in the wild bird population and domestic poultry can become infected. The virus possibly could mutate to become highly virulent and infectious in humans and cause an [[influenza pandemic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/ |title=Information on Avian Influenza |work=Seasonal Influenza (Flu) |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |accessdate=March 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bacteria can be grown in the laboratory on nutrient culture media, but viruses need living cells in which to replicate. Many [[vaccine]]s to [[infectious disease]]s can be grown in fertilised chicken eggs. Millions of eggs are used each year to generate the annual flu vaccine requirements, a complex process that takes about six months after the decision is made as to what strains of virus to include in the new vaccine. A problem with using eggs for this purpose is that people with egg [[Allergy|allergies]] are unable to be immunised, but this disadvantage may be overcome as new techniques for cell-based rather than egg-based culture become available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm336267.htm |title=The evolution, and revolution, of flu vaccines |date=January 18, 2013 |work=FDA: Consumer updates |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |accessdate=March 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cell-based culture will also be useful in a [[pandemic]] when it may be difficult to acquire a sufficiently large quantity of suitable sterile, fertile eggs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/articles/vaccines-pandemic-threats |title=Vaccines for pandemic threats |date=January 15, 2014 |work=The History of Vaccines |accessdate=March 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{distinguish|Raising of the son of the widow of Zarephath}}
The '''raising of the son of the woman of Shunem''' is a miracle by [[Elisha]] recorded in the Hebrew Bible, [[2 Kings]] 4.
{{quotation|2 Kings 4: 32 When Elisha came into the house, he saw the child lying dead on his bed. 33 So he went in and shut the door behind the two of them and prayed to the Lord. 34 Then he went up and lay on the child, putting his mouth on his mouth, his eyes on his eyes, and his hands on his hands. And as he stretched himself upon him, the flesh of the child became warm. 35 Then he got up again and walked once back and forth in the house, and went up and stretched himself upon him. The child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes. }}
The story begins at 2 Kings 4:8, and is demarcated from the previous story by Elisha's arrival in [[Shunem]], and by a change in heroine — from the widow of the son of the prophets (4:1-7) to the [[Woman of Shunem|rich wife of Shunem]].&lt;ref&gt;Uriel Simon ''Reading Prophetic Narratives'' 1997  Page 227 "There is no doubt that the story begins at 2 Kings 4:8, since it is demarcated from the previous story by three clear signs: change of place — Elisha's arrival in Shunem; change in heroine — from the widow of the son of the prophets to the grande dame of Shunem, and by change of genre."&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''recurrent neural network''' ('''RNN''') is a class of [[artificial neural network]] where connections between nodes form a [[directed graph]] along a sequence. This allows it to exhibit temporal dynamic behavior for a time sequence. Unlike [[feedforward neural networks]], RNNs can use their internal state (memory) to process sequences of inputs. This makes them applicable to tasks such as unsegmented, connected [[handwriting recognition]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Graves | first1 = A. | authorlink6 = Jürgen Schmidhuber | last2 = Liwicki | first2 = M. | last3 = Fernandez | first3 = S. | last4 = Bertolami | first4 = R. | last5 = Bunke | first5 = H. | last6 = Schmidhuber | first6 = J. | title = A Novel Connectionist System for Improved Unconstrained Handwriting Recognition | url = http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/tpami_2008.pdf | format = PDF | journal = IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence | volume = 31 | issue = 5| year = 2009 | doi=10.1109/tpami.2008.137}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[speech recognition]].&lt;ref name="sak2014"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/43905.pdf|title=Long Short-Term Memory recurrent neural network architectures for large scale acoustic modeling|last=Sak|first=Hasim|last2=Senior|first2=Andrew|date=2014|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|last3=Beaufays|first3=Francoise}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="liwu2015"&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=Li|first=Xiangang|last2=Wu|first2=Xihong|date=2014-10-15|title=Constructing Long Short-Term Memory based Deep Recurrent Neural Networks for Large Vocabulary Speech Recognition|eprint=1410.4281|class=cs.CL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "recurrent neural network" is used indiscriminately to refer to two broad classes of networks with a similar general structure, where one is [[finite impulse response|finite impulse]] and the other is [[infinite impulse response|infinite impulse]]. Both classes of networks exhibit temporal [[dynamic system|dynamic behavior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miljanovic|first=Milos|date=Feb-Mar 2012|title=Comparative analysis of Recurrent and Finite Impulse Response Neural Networks in Time Series Prediction|url=http://www.ijcse.com/docs/INDJCSE12-03-01-028.pdf|journal=Indian Journal of Computer and Engineering|volume=3|issue=1|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A finite impulse recurrent network is a [[directed acyclic graph]] that can be unrolled and replaced with a strictly feedforward neural network, while an infinite impulse recurrent network is a [[directed cyclic graph]] that can not be unrolled.

Both finite impulse and infinite impulse recurrent networks can have additional stored state, and the storage can be under direct control by the neural network. The storage can also be replaced by another network or graph, if that incorporates time delays or has feedback loops. Such controlled states are referred to as gated state or gated memory, and are part of [[long short-term memory]] networks (LSTMs) and [[gated recurrent unit]]s.

==History==
Recurrent neural networks were developed in the 1980s. Hopfield networks were discovered by [[John Hopfield]] in 1982. In 1993, a neural history compressor system solved a "Very Deep Learning" task that required more than 1000 subsequent layers in an RNN unfolded in time.&lt;ref name="schmidhuber1993"&gt;{{Cite book |url=ftp://ftp.idsia.ch/pub/juergen/habilitation.pdf |title=Habilitation thesis: System modeling and optimization |last=Schmidhuber |first=Jürgen |year=1993 |authorlink=Jürgen Schmidhuber}} Page 150 ff demonstrates credit assignment across the equivalent of 1,200 layers in an unfolded RNN.&lt;/ref&gt;

===LSTM===
[[Long short-term memory]] (LSTM) networks were discovered by [[Sepp Hochreiter|Hochreiter]] and [[Jürgen Schmidhuber|Schmidhuber]] in 1997 and set accuracy records in multiple applications domains.&lt;ref name="lstm"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hochreiter |first=Sepp |author-link=Sepp Hochreiter |last2=Schmidhuber |first2=Jürgen |author-link2=Jürgen Schmidhuber |date=1997-11-01 |title=Long Short-Term Memory |journal=Neural Computation |volume=9 |issue=8 |pages=1735–1780 |doi=10.1162/neco.1997.9.8.1735}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 2007, LSTM started to revolutionize [[speech recognition]], outperforming traditional models in certain speech applications.&lt;ref name="fernandez2007keyword"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Fernández |first=Santiago |last2=Graves |first2=Alex |last3=Schmidhuber |first3=Jürgen |date=2007 |title=An Application of Recurrent Neural Networks to Discriminative Keyword Spotting |url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1778066.1778092 |journal=Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks |series=ICANN'07 |location=Berlin, Heidelberg |publisher=Springer-Verlag |pages=220–229 |isbn=978-3-540-74693-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, a [[Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC)|Connectionist Temporal Classification]] (CTC)-trained LSTM network was the first RNN to win pattern recognition contests when it won several competitions in connected [[handwriting recognition]].&lt;ref name="schmidhuber2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="graves20093"&gt;{{Cite journal |last2=Schmidhuber |first2=Jürgen |date=2009 |editor-last=Bengio |editor-first=Yoshua |title=Offline Handwriting Recognition with Multidimensional Recurrent Neural Networks |url=https://papers.nips.cc/paper/3449-offline-handwriting-recognition-with-multidimensional-recurrent-neural-networks |journal=Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) Foundation |pages=545–552 |editor-last2=Schuurmans |editor-first2=Dale |editor-last3=Lafferty |editor-first3=John |editor-last4=Williams |editor-first4=Chris editor-K.

==Architectures==
RNNs come in many variants.

===Fully recurrent ===
[[File:Recurrent neural network unfold.svg|thumb|Unfolded basic recurrent neural network]]
Basic RNNs are a network of [[Artificial neuron|neuron-like]] nodes organized into successive "layers", each node in a given layer is connected with a [[directed graph|directed (one-way) connection]] to every other node in the next successive layer.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} Each node (neuron) has a time-varying real-valued activation. Each connection (synapse) has a modifiable real-valued [[Weighting|weight]]. Nodes are either input nodes (receiving data from outside the network), output nodes (yielding results), or hidden nodes (that modify the data ''en route'' from input to output).

For [[supervised learning]] in discrete time settings, sequences of real-valued input vectors arrive at the input nodes, one vector at a time. At any given time step, each non-input unit computes its current activation (result) as a nonlinear function of the weighted sum of the activations of all units that connect to it. Supervisor-given target activations can be supplied for some output units at certain time steps. For example, if the input sequence is a speech signal corresponding to a spoken digit, the final target output at the end of the sequence may be a label classifying the digit.

In [[reinforcement learning]] settings, no teacher provides target signals. Instead a [[fitness function]] or [[reward function]] is occasionally used to evaluate the RNN's performance, which influences its input stream through output units connected to actuators that affect the environment. This might be used to play a game in which progress is measured with the number of points won.

Each sequence produces an error as the sum of the deviations of all target signals from the corresponding activations computed by the network. For a training set of numerous sequences, the total error is the sum of the errors of all individual sequences.

==={{Anchor|Elman network|Jordan network}} Elman networks and Jordan networks===
[[File:Elman srnn.png|thumb|Right|The Elman network]]

An [[Jeff Elman|Elman]] network is a three-layer network (arranged horizontally as ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' in the illustration) with the addition of a set of "context units" (''u'' in the illustration). The middle (hidden) layer is connected to these context units fixed with a weight of one.&lt;ref name="bmm615"&gt;Cruse, Holk; [http://www.brains-minds-media.org/archive/615/bmm615.pdf ''Neural Networks as Cybernetic Systems''], 2nd and revised edition&lt;/ref&gt; At each time step, the input is fed-forward and a learning rule is applied. The fixed back-connections save a copy of the previous values of the hidden units in the context units (since they propagate over the connections before the learning rule is applied). Thus the network can maintain a sort of state, allowing it to perform such tasks as sequence-prediction that are beyond the power of a standard [[multilayer perceptron]].

[[Michael I. Jordan|Jordan]] networks are similar to Elman networks. The context units are fed from the output layer instead of the hidden layer. The context units in a Jordan network are also referred to as the state layer. They have a recurrent connection to themselves.&lt;ref name="bmm615" /&gt;

Elman and Jordan networks are also known as "simple recurrent networks" (SRN).

===Hopfield ===
{{Main|Hopfield network}}

The [[Hopfield network]] is an RNN in which all connections are symmetric. It requires [[Stationary process|stationary]] inputs and is thus not a general RNN, as it does not process sequences of patterns. It guarantees that it will converge. If the connections are trained using [[Hebbian learning]] then the Hopfield network can perform as [[Robustness (computer science)|robust]] [[content-addressable memory]], resistant to connection alteration.

====Bidirectional associative memory====
{{Main|Bidirectional associative memory}}

Introduced by Bart Kosko,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=1988 |title=Bidirectional associative memories |journal=IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=49–60 |doi=10.1109/21.87054 |last1=Kosko |first1=B.}}&lt;/ref&gt; a bidirectional associative memory (BAM) network is a variant of a Hopfield network that stores associative data as a vector. The bi-directionality comes from passing information through a matrix and its [[transpose]]. Typically, bipolar encoding is preferred to binary encoding of the associative pairs. Recently, stochastic BAM models using [[Markov chain|Markov]] stepping were optimized for increased network stability and relevance to real-world applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last2=Chandrasekar |first2=A. |last3=Lakshmanan |first3=S. |last4=Park |first4=Ju H. |date=2 January 2015 |title=Exponential stability for markovian jumping stochastic BAM neural networks with mode-dependent probabilistic time-varying delays and impulse control |journal=Complexity |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=39–65 |doi=10.1002/cplx.21503 |last1=Rakkiyappan |first1=R.|bibcode=2015Cmplx..20c..39R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A BAM network has two layers, either of which can be driven as an input to recall an association and produce an output on the other layer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Echo state ===
{{Main|Echo state network}}

The echo state network (ESN) has a sparsely connected random hidden layer. The weights of output neurons are the only part of the network that can change (be trained). ESNs are good at reproducing certain [[time series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Jaeger |first=Herbert |last2=Haas |first2=Harald |date=2004-04-02 |title=Harnessing Nonlinearity: Predicting Chaotic Systems and Saving Energy in Wireless Communication |journal=Science |volume=304 |issue=5667 |pages=78–80 |doi=10.1126/science.1091277 |pmid=15064413 |bibcode=2004Sci...304...78J}}&lt;/ref&gt; A variant for [[Spiking neural network|spiking neurons]] is known as a [[liquid state machine]].&lt;ref&gt;W.

The Independently recurrent neural network (IndRNN)&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Independently Recurrent Neural Network (IndRNN): Building A Longer and Deeper RNN |url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.04831.pdf |last1=Li |first1=Shuai |last2=Li |first2=Wanqing |last3=Cook |first3=Chris |last4=Zhu |first4=Ce |last5=Yanbo |first5=Gao |journal=IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition |year=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; addresses the gradient vanishing and exploding problems in the traditional fully connected RNN. Each neuron in one layer only receives its own past state as context information (instead of full connectivity to all other neurons in this layer) and thus neurons are independent of each other's history. The gradient backpropagation can be regulated to avoid gradient vanishing and exploding in order to keep long or short-term memory. The cross-neuron information is explored in the next layers. IndRNN can be robustly trained with the non-saturated nonlinear functions such as ReLU. Using skip connections, deep networks can be trained.

A special case of recursive neural networks is the RNN whose structure corresponds to a linear chain. Recursive neural networks have been applied to [[natural language processing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Socher|first1=Richard|last2=Lin|first2=Cliff|last3=Ng|first3=Andrew Y.|last4=Manning|first4=Christopher D.|date=|contribution=Parsing Natural Scenes and Natural Language with Recursive Neural Networks|contribution-url=http://ai.stanford.edu/~ang/papers/icml11-ParsingWithRecursiveNeuralNetworks.pdf|title=28th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2011)|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Recursive Neural Tensor Network uses a [[tensor]]-based composition function for all nodes in the tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Socher |first1=Richard |last2=Perelygin |first2=Alex |last3=Y.

===Neural history compressor===
The neural history compressor is an unsupervised stack of RNNs.&lt;ref name="schmidhuber1992"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmidhuber | first1 = Jürgen | authorlink = Jürgen Schmidhuber | year = 1992| title = Learning complex, extended sequences using the principle of history compression | url = ftp://ftp.idsia.ch/pub/juergen/chunker.pdf | journal = Neural Computation | volume = 4 | issue = 2| pages = 234–242 | doi=10.1162/neco.1992.4.2.234}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the input level, it learns to predict its next input from the previous inputs. Only unpredictable inputs of some RNN in the hierarchy become inputs to the next higher level RNN, which therefore recomputes its internal state only rarely. Each higher level RNN thus studies a compressed representation of the information in the RNN below. This is done such that the input sequence can be precisely reconstructed from the representation at the highest level.

The system effectively minimises the description length or the negative [[logarithm]] of the probability of the data.&lt;ref name="scholarpedia2015pre"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmidhuber | first1 = Jürgen | authorlink = Jürgen Schmidhuber | year = 2015 | title = Deep Learning | url = http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Deep_Learning#Fundamental_Deep_Learning_Problem_and_Unsupervised_Pre-Training_of_RNNs_and_FNNs | journal = Scholarpedia | volume = 10 | issue = 11| page = 32832 | doi=10.4249/scholarpedia.32832| bibcode = 2015SchpJ..1032832S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Given a lot of learnable predictability in the incoming data sequence, the highest level RNN can use supervised learning to easily classify even deep sequences with long intervals between important events.

It is possible to distill the RNN hierarchy into two RNNs: the "conscious" chunker (higher level) and the "subconscious" automatizer (lower level).&lt;ref name="schmidhuber1992" /&gt; Once the chunker has learned to predict and compress inputs that are unpredictable by the automatizer, then the automatizer can be forced in the next learning phase to predict or imitate through additional units the hidden units of the more slowly changing chunker. This makes it easy for the automatizer to learn appropriate, rarely changing memories across long intervals. In turn this helps the automatizer to make many of its once unpredictable inputs predictable, such that the chunker can focus on the remaining unpredictable events.&lt;ref name="schmidhuber1992" /&gt;

A [[generative model]] partially overcame the [[vanishing gradient problem]]&lt;ref name="hochreiter1991"&gt;[[Sepp Hochreiter]] (1991), [http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/SeppHochreiter1991ThesisAdvisorSchmidhuber.pdf Untersuchungen zu dynamischen neuronalen Netzen], Diploma thesis. Institut f. Informatik, Technische Univ. Munich. Advisor: J. Schmidhuber.&lt;/ref&gt; of [[automatic differentiation]] or [[backpropagation]] in neural networks in 1992. In 1993, such a system solved a "Very Deep Learning" task that required more than 1000 subsequent layers in an RNN unfolded in time.&lt;ref name="schmidhuber1993"/&gt;

===Second order RNNs===
Second order RNNs use higher order weights &lt;math&gt;w{}_{ijk}&lt;/math&gt; instead of the standard &lt;math&gt;w{}_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; weights, and states can be a product. This allows a direct mapping to a [[finite state machine]] both in training, stability, and representation.&lt;ref&gt;C.L. Giles, C.B. Miller, D. Chen, H.H. Chen, G.Z. Sun, Y.C. Lee, [https://clgiles.ist.psu.edu/pubs/NC1992-recurrent-NN.pdf "Learning and Extracting Finite State Automata with Second-Order Recurrent Neural Networks"], Neural Computation, 4(3), p. 393, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C.W.

[[File:Long Short-Term Memory.svg|thumb|Long short-term memory unit]]
Long short-term memory (LSTM) is a [[deep learning]] system that avoids the [[vanishing gradient problem]].

They are used in the full form and several simplified variants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=Heck|first=Joel|last2=Salem|first2=Fathi M.|date=2017-01-12|title=Simplified Minimal Gated Unit Variations for Recurrent Neural Networks|eprint=1701.03452 |class=cs.NE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=Dey|first=Rahul|last2=Salem|first2=Fathi M.|date=2017-01-20|title=Gate-Variants of Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) Neural Networks|eprint=1701.05923 |class=cs.NE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their performance on polyphonic music modeling and speech signal modeling was found to be similar to that of long short-term memory.&lt;ref name="MyUser_Arxiv.org_May_18_2016c"&gt;{{cite arXiv |class=cs.NE |first2=Caglar |last2=Gulcehre |title=Empirical Evaluation of Gated Recurrent Neural Networks on Sequence Modeling |eprint=1412.3555 |last1=Chung |first1=Junyoung |last3=Cho |first3=KyungHyun |last4=Bengio |first4=Yoshua |year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have fewer parameters than LSTM, as they lack an output gate.&lt;ref name="MyUser_Wildml.com_May_18_2016c"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wildml.com/2015/10/recurrent-neural-network-tutorial-part-4-implementing-a-grulstm-rnn-with-python-and-theano/ |title=Recurrent Neural Network Tutorial, Part 4 – Implementing a GRU/LSTM RNN with Python and Theano – WildML |date= |newspaper=Wildml.com |accessdate=May 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bi-directional ===
Bi-directional RNNs use a finite sequence to predict or label each element of the sequence based on the element's past and future contexts. This is done by concatenating the outputs of two RNNs, one processing the sequence from left to right, the other one from right to left. The combined outputs are the predictions of the teacher-given target signals. This technique proved to be especially useful when combined with LSTM RNNs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Graves |first=Alex |last2=Schmidhuber |first2=Jürgen |date=2005-07-01 |title=Framewise phoneme classification with bidirectional LSTM and other neural network architectures |journal=Neural Networks |series=IJCNN 2005 |volume=18 |issue=5 |pages=602–610 |doi=10.1016/j.neunet.2005.06.042}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Thireou |first=T. |last2=Reczko |first2=M. |date=July 2007 |title=Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Networks for Predicting the Subcellular Localization of Eukaryotic Proteins  |journal=IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=441–446 |doi=10.1109/tcbb.2007.1015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continuous-time ===
A continuous time recurrent neural network (CTRNN) uses a system of [[ordinary differential equations]] to model the effects on a neuron of the incoming spike train.

For a neuron &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; in the network with [[action potential]] &lt;math&gt;y_{i}&lt;/math&gt;, the rate of change of activation is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;\tau_{i}\dot{y}_{i}=-y_{i}+\sum_{j=1}^{n}w_{ji}\sigma(y_{j}-\Theta_{j})+I_{i}(t)&lt;/math&gt;
Where:
* &lt;math&gt;\tau_{i}&lt;/math&gt; : Time constant of [[Synapse|postsynaptic]] node
* &lt;math&gt;y_{i}&lt;/math&gt; : Activation of postsynaptic node
* &lt;math&gt;\dot{y}_{i}&lt;/math&gt; : Rate of change of activation of postsynaptic node
* &lt;math&gt;w{}_{ji}&lt;/math&gt; : Weight of connection from pre to postsynaptic node
* &lt;math&gt;\sigma(x)&lt;/math&gt; : Sigmoid of x e.g. &lt;math&gt;\sigma(x) = 1/(1+e^{-x})&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;y_{j}&lt;/math&gt; : Activation of presynaptic node
* &lt;math&gt;\Theta_{j}&lt;/math&gt; : Bias of presynaptic node
* &lt;math&gt;I_{i}(t)&lt;/math&gt; : Input (if any) to node

CTRNNs have been applied to [[evolutionary robotics]] where they have been used to address vision,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Harvey|first=Inman|title=3rd international conference on Simulation of adaptive behavior: from animals to animats 3|year=1994|author2=Husbands, P.|author3=Cliff, D.|pages=392–401|contribution=Seeing the light: Artificial evolution, real vision|contribution-url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229091538_Seeing_the_Light_Artificial_Evolution_Real_Vision}}&lt;/ref&gt; co-operation,&lt;ref name="Evolving communication without dedicated communication channels"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Quinn |first=Matthew |title=Evolving communication without dedicated communication channels |journal=Advances in Artificial Life |year=2001 |pages=357–366 |doi=10.1007/3-540-44811-X_38 |series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science |isbn=978-3-540-42567-0 |volume=2159}}&lt;/ref&gt; and minimal cognitive behaviour.&lt;ref name="The dynamics of adaptive behavior: A research program"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Beer |title=The dynamics of adaptive behavior: A research program |first=R.D. |journal=Robotics and Autonomous Systems |year=1997 |pages=257–289 |doi=10.1016/S0921-8890(96)00063-2 |volume=20 |issue=2–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that, by the [[Shannon sampling theorem]], discrete time recurrent neural networks can be viewed as continuous-time recurrent neural networks where the differential equations have transformed into equivalent [[difference equation]]s. This transformation can be thought of as occurring after the post-synaptic node activation functions &lt;math&gt;y_i(t)&lt;/math&gt; have been low-pass filtered but prior to sampling.

===Hierarchical ===
Hierarchical RNNs connect their neurons in various ways to decompose hierarchical behavior into useful subprograms.&lt;ref name="schmidhuber1992"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Paine |first=Rainer W. |last2=Tani |first2=Jun |date=2005-09-01 |title=How Hierarchical Control Self-organizes in Artificial Adaptive Systems  |journal=Adaptive Behavior |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=211–225 |doi=10.1177/105971230501300303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recurrent multilayer perceptron network===
Generally, a Recurrent Multi-Layer Perceptron (RMLP) network consists of cascaded subnetworks, each of which contains multiple layers of nodes. Each of these subnetworks is feed-forward except for the last layer, which can have feedback connections. Each of these subnets is connected only by feed forward connections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |citeseerx=10.1.1.45.3527  |title=Recurrent Multilayer Perceptrons for Identification and Control: The Road to Applications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multiple timescales model===
A multiple timescales recurrent neural network (MTRNN) is a neural-based computational model that can simulate the functional hierarchy of the brain through self-organization that depends on spatial connection between neurons and on distinct types of neuron activities, each with distinct time properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Yamashita |first=Yuichi |last2=Tani |first2=Jun |date=2008-11-07 |title=Emergence of Functional Hierarchy in a Multiple Timescale Neural Network Model: A Humanoid Robot Experiment |url=http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000220&amp;type=printable |journal=PLOS Computational Biology |volume=4 |issue=11 |pages=e1000220 |doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000220 |pmc=2570613 |pmid=18989398 |bibcode=2008PLSCB...4E0220Y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Shibata Alnajjar |first=Fady |last2=Yamashita |first2=Yuichi |last3=Tani |first3=Jun |date=2013 |title=The hierarchical and functional connectivity of higher-order cognitive mechanisms: neurorobotic model to investigate the stability and flexibility of working memory |url=http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnbot.2013.00002/pdf |journal=Frontiers in Neurorobotics |volume=7 |pages=2 |doi=10.3389/fnbot.2013.00002 |pmc=3575058 |pmid=23423881}}&lt;/ref&gt; With such varied neuronal activities, continuous sequences of any set of behaviors are segmented into reusable primitives, which in turn are flexibly integrated into diverse sequential behaviors. The biological approval of such a type of hierarchy was discussed in the [[memory-prediction framework|memory-prediction]] theory of brain function by [[Jeff Hawkins|Hawkins]] in his book ''[[On Intelligence]]''.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

===Neural Turing machines===
{{Main|Neural Turing machine}}

Neural Turing machines (NTMs) are a method of extending recurrent neural networks by coupling them to external [[memory]] resources which they can interact with by [[attentional process]]es. The combined system is analogous to a [[Turing machine]] or [[Von Neumann architecture]] but is [[Differentiable neural computer|differentiable]] end-to-end, allowing it to be efficiently trained with [[gradient descent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv |eprint=1410.5401 |title= Neural Turing Machines  |last1= Graves  |first1= Alex  |last2= Wayne  |first2= Greg  |last3= Danihelka  |first3= Ivo |year= 2014|class= cs.NE  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Differentiable neural computer===
{{main|Differentiable neural computer}}
Differentiable neural computers (DNCs) are an extension of Neural Turing machines, allowing for usage of fuzzy amounts of each memory address and a record of chronology.

===Neural network pushdown automata===
Neural network pushdown automata (NNPDA) are similar to NTMs, but tapes are replaced by analogue stacks that are differentiable and that are trained. In this way, they are similar in complexity to recognizers of [[context free grammar]]s (CFGs).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Adaptive Processing of Sequences and Data Structures |chapter=The Neural Network Pushdown Automaton: Architecture, Dynamics and Training |last=Sun |first=Guo-Zheng |last2=Giles |first2=C.

==Training==

===Gradient descent===
{{Main|Gradient descent}}
Gradient descent is a [[:Category:First order methods|first-order]] [[Iterative algorithm|iterative]] [[Mathematical optimization|optimization]] [[algorithm]] for finding the minimum of a function. In neural networks, it can be used to minimize the error term by changing each weight in proportion to the derivative of the error with respect to that weight, provided the non-linear [[activation function]]s are [[Differentiable function|differentiable]]. Various methods for doing so were developed in the 1980s and early 1990s by [[Paul Werbos|Werbos]], [[Ronald J. Williams|Williams]], [[Tony Robinson (speech recognition)|Robinson]], [[Jürgen Schmidhuber|Schmidhuber]], [[Sepp Hochreiter|Hochreiter]], Pearlmutter and others.

The standard method is called "[[backpropagation through time]]" or BPTT, and is a generalization of [[back-propagation]] for feed-forward networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Werbos|first=Paul J.|title=Generalization of backpropagation with application to a recurrent gas market model|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/089360808890007X|journal=Neural Networks|volume=1|issue=4|pages=339–356|doi=10.1016/0893-6080(88)90007-x|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=Ff9iHAAACAAJ}}|title=Learning Internal Representations by Error Propagation|last=Rumelhart|first=David E.|publisher=Institute for Cognitive Science, University of California, San Diego|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like that method, it is an instance of [[automatic differentiation]] in the reverse accumulation mode of [[Pontryagin's minimum principle]]. A more computationally expensive online variant is called "Real-Time Recurrent Learning" or RTRL,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=6JYYMwEACAAJ}}|title=The Utility Driven Dynamic Error Propagation Network.

Gradient-based learning algorithms for recurrent networks and their computational complexity |date=1 February 2013|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-1-134-77581-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is an instance of [[automatic differentiation]] in the forward accumulation mode with stacked tangent vectors. Unlike BPTT, this algorithm is local in time but not local in space.

In this context, local in space means that a unit's weight vector can be updated using only information stored in the connected units and the unit itself such that update complexity of a single unit is linear in the dimensionality of the weight vector. Local in time means that the updates take place continually (on-line) and depend only on the most recent time step rather than on multiple time steps within a given time horizon as in BPTT. Biological neural networks appear to be local with respect to both time and space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=SCHMIDHUBER|first=JURGEN|date=1989-01-01|title=A Local Learning Algorithm for Dynamic Feedforward and Recurrent Networks|journal=Connection Science|volume=1|issue=4|pages=403–412|doi=10.1080/09540098908915650}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PríncipeEuliano2000"&gt;{{cite book|first1=José C. |last1=Príncipe|first2=Neil R.|last2= Euliano|first3=W.

For recursively computing the partial derivatives, RTRL has a time-complexity of O(number of hidden x number of weights) per time step for computing the [[Jacobian matrix|Jacobian matrices]], while BPTT only takes O(number of weights) per time step, at the cost of storing all forward activations within the given time horizon.&lt;ref name="Ollivier2015"&gt;{{Cite arxiv|last=Yann|first=Ollivier|last2=Corentin|first2=Tallec|last3=Guillaume|first3=Charpiat|date=2015-07-28|title=Training recurrent networks online without backtracking|eprint=1507.07680|class=cs.NE}}&lt;/ref&gt; An online hybrid between BPTT and RTRL with intermediate complexity exists,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schmidhuber|first=Jürgen|date=1992-03-01|title=A Fixed Size Storage O(n3) Time Complexity Learning Algorithm for Fully Recurrent Continually Running Networks|journal=Neural Computation|volume=4|issue=2|pages=243–248|doi=10.1162/neco.1992.4.2.243}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=R.

A major problem with gradient descent for standard RNN architectures is that [[Vanishing gradient problem|error gradients vanish]] exponentially quickly with the size of the time lag between important events.&lt;ref name="hochreiter1991" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HOCH2001"&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=NWOcMVA64aAC}}|title=A Field Guide to Dynamical Recurrent Networks|last=Hochreiter|first=S.|display-authors=etal|date=15 January 2001|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=|isbn=978-0-7803-5369-5|location=|pages=|chapter=Gradient flow in recurrent nets: the difficulty of learning long-term dependencies|editor-last2=Kremer|editor-first2=Stefan C.|editor-first1=John F.|editor-last1=Kolen}}&lt;/ref&gt; LSTM combined with a BPTT/RTRL hybrid learning method attempts to overcome these problems.&lt;ref name="lstm" /&gt; This problem is also solved in the independently recurrent neural network (IndRNN)&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; by reducing the context of a neuron to its own past state and the cross-neuron information can then be explored in the following layers. Memories of different range including long-term memory can be learned without the gradient vanishing and exploding problem.

The on-line algorithm called causal recursive backpropagation (CRBP), implements and combines BPTT and RTRL paradigms for locally recurrent networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Campolucci|first=|last2=Uncini|first2=A.|last3=Piazza|first3=F.|last4=Rao|first4=B.

The CRBP algorithm can minimize the global error term. This fact improves stability of the algorithm, providing a unifying view on gradient calculation techniques for recurrent networks with local feedback.

One approach to the computation of gradient information in RNNs with arbitrary architectures is based on signal-flow graphs diagrammatic derivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Wan|first1=E. A.|last2=Beaufays|first2=F.|year=1996|title=Diagrammatic derivation of gradient algorithms for neural networks|url=|journal=Neural Computation|volume=8|pages=182–201|doi=10.1162/neco.1996.8.1.182}}&lt;/ref&gt; It uses the BPTT batch algorithm, based on Lee's theorem for network sensitivity calculations.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Campolucci|first1=P.|last2=Uncini|first2=A.|last3=Piazza|first3=F.|year=2000|title=A Signal-Flow-Graph Approach to On-line Gradient Calculation|url=|journal=Neural Computation|volume=12|issue=8|pages=1901–1927|doi=10.1162/089976600300015196}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was proposed by Wan and Beaufays, while its fast online version was proposed by Campolucci, Uncini and Piazza.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Global optimization methods===
Training the weights in a neural network can be modeled as a non-linear [[global optimization]] problem. A target function can be formed to evaluate the fitness or error of a particular weight vector as follows: First, the weights in the network are set according to the weight vector. Next, the network is evaluated against the training sequence. Typically, the sum-squared-difference between the predictions and the target values specified in the training sequence is used to represent the error of the current weight vector. Arbitrary global optimization techniques may then be used to minimize this target function.

The most common global optimization method for training RNNs is [[genetic algorithm]]s, especially in unstructured networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=IJCAI 99|year=1999|last1=Gomez|last2=Miikkulainen|first1=F. J.|first2=R.|contribution=Solving non-Markovian control tasks with neuroevolution|contribution-url=http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/nn/downloads/papers/gomez.ijcai99.pdf|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|accessdate=5 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arimaa.com/arimaa/about/Thesis/|title=Applying Genetic Algorithms to Recurrent Neural Networks for Learning Network Parameters and Architecture|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gomez|first=Faustino|last2=Schmidhuber|first2=Jürgen|last3=Miikkulainen|first3=Risto|date=June 2008|title=Accelerated Neural Evolution Through Cooperatively Coevolved Synapses|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1390681.1390712|journal=J. Mach. Learn. Res.|volume=9|pages=937–965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, the genetic algorithm is encoded with the neural network weights in a predefined manner where one [[gene]] in the [[chromosome]] represents one weight link.The whole network is represented as a single chromosome. The fitness function is evaluated as follows:

* Each weight encoded in the chromosome is assigned to the respective weight link of the network.
* The training set is presented to the network which propagates the input signals forward. 
* The mean-squared-error is returned to the fitness function.
* This function drives the genetic selection process.
Many chromosomes make up the population; therefore, many different neural networks are evolved until a stopping criterion is satisfied. A common stopping scheme is: 
* When the neural network has learnt a certain percentage of the training data or 
* When the minimum value of the mean-squared-error is satisfied or 
* When the maximum number of training generations has been reached. 
The stopping criterion is evaluated by the fitness function as it gets the reciprocal of the mean-squared-error from each network during training. Therefore, the goal of the genetic algorithm is to maximize the fitness function, reducing the mean-squared-error.

Other global (and/or evolutionary) optimization techniques may be used to seek a good set of weights, such as [[simulated annealing]] or [[particle swarm optimization]].

==Related fields and models==
RNNs may behave [[chaos theory|chaotically]]. In such cases, [[dynamical systems theory]] may be used for analysis.

They are in fact [[recursive neural network]]s with a particular structure: that of a linear chain. Whereas recursive neural networks operate on any hierarchical structure, combining child representations into parent representations, recurrent neural networks operate on the linear progression of time, combining the previous time step and a hidden representation into the representation for the current time step.

In particular, RNNs can appear as nonlinear versions of [[finite impulse response]] and [[infinite impulse response]] filters and also as a [[nonlinear autoregressive exogenous model]] (NARX).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=830-HAAACAAJ|page=208}}|title=Computational Capabilities of Recurrent NARX Neural Networks|last=Siegelmann|first=Hava T.|last2=Horne|first2=Bill G.|last3=Giles|first3=C.

{{Nihongo|'''Reikon'''|霊魂}}, in [[Shinto]] and [[Japanese Buddhism]], is the equivalent to the [[soul]] or spirit in western culture.

==Japanese Tradition==
When a person dies, it is believed that their reikon will remain in a type of [[purgatory]] until they are given proper funeral rites. After which, the reikon will join their ancestors in the afterlife and only returning to the living world every August for the [[Obon Festival]].

==Yurei==
When a person dies in an unexpected, violent or traumatic way, the reikon remains amongst the living as a [[yurei]], or [[ghost]], who must complete an unfinished duty amongst the living or be given a proper ritual to ease its passing into the next world. A yurei is thought to be produced by violent means such as murder or suicide. These tend to take on a fixed desire emotion such as revenge, love, jealousy, hatred, or sorrow while carrying out their hauntings.

{{NewThought}}

'''Science of Mind''' was established in 1927 by [[Ernest Holmes]] (1887&amp;ndash;1960) and is a [[Spirituality|spiritual]], [[philosophical]] and [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] religious movement within the [[New Thought]] movement.  In general, the term "Science of Mind" applies to the teachings, while the term "Religious Science" applies to the organizations. However, adherents often use the terms interchangeably.

In his book, ''[[The Science of Mind]]'', Ernest Holmes stated "Religious Science is a correlation of laws of science, opinions of philosophy, and revelations of religion applied to human needs and the aspirations of man."   He also stated that Religious Science/Science of Mind (RS/SOM) is not based on any "authority" of established beliefs, but rather on "what it can accomplish" for the people who practice it.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Vahle(1993) p7&lt;/ref&gt; Today the [[Religious Science International|International Centers for Spiritual Living]], the [[United Centers for Spiritual Living]] (which combined into the Centers for Spiritual Living in 2011) and [[Global Religious Science Ministries]] are the main denominations promoting Religious Science.

==History==
Ernest Holmes did not originally intend for RS/SOM to be a "church", but rather a teaching institution. In that spirit, many member "churches" have traditionally referred to themselves as "centers." The mental healing work of [[Phineas Quimby]] was a source of inspiration to much of the New Thought movement, including RS/SOM. Ernest Holmes was especially strongly influenced by [[Emma Curtis Hopkins]], a former student of [[Christian Science]], especially her "Scientific Christian Mental Practice", a direct precursor to Holmes' "[[Spiritual Mind Treatment]]", and by the writings of Judge [[Thomas Troward]] and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], as he developed his own synthesis, which became known as Religious Science or Science of Mind.&lt;ref&gt;Braden p.295, 289–291&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson (2003) pp. 26–28&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1926 Holmes published ''The Science of Mind'',&lt;ref&gt;Holmes.  Ernest (1926). The Science of Mind. {{ISBN|0-87477-865-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; which references the teachings of [[Jesus Christ]] &lt;ref&gt;Holmes, Ernest (1926) SOM Publishing, Science of Mind pages 87, 98 ... etc ... 496.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Bible]] &lt;ref&gt;Holmes, Ernest (1936) SOM Publishing, Science on Mind p.483-504&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Buddha]].&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, Ernest (1926) SOM Publishing, Science of Mind pgs. 76, 78, 329, 342, 344, 428&lt;/ref&gt; Holmes established the Institute for Religious Science and School of Philosophy in Los Angeles. This organization would later become the Church of Religious Science. Holmes had previously studied another New Thought teaching, [[Divine Science]], and he was an ordained Divine Science Minister.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn R. Mosley (2006) Templeton Foundation Press, New Thought, Ancient Wisdom p.47&lt;/ref&gt; He saw humans as being "open at the top"—that is, open to evolutionary improvement of consciousness in all areas of life.&lt;ref&gt;Vahle (1993) p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; The concepts of "Open at the Top" and "New Thought" have inspired RS/SOM organizations and their teachings to evolve over the years. As stated in the book ''New Thought:  A Practical American Spirituality'', "New Thought still is evolving; it may yet be the point at which religion, philosophy, and science come together as the most effective combination to move the world to greater peace, plenty, health, and harmony.  Many believe it might be the quintessential spirituality for the next millennium." &lt;ref&gt;Anderson (2003), Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt; His teachings attracted famous celebrities of his time including [[Cecil B. DeMille]], [[Peggy Lee]], and [[Cary Grant]].&lt;ref&gt;Vahle (1993) pp. 2–3&lt;/ref&gt;

== Teaching and practice ==
{{New Thought beliefs}}
The RS/SOM teaching generally incorporates [[idealistic]] and [[panentheistic]] philosophies. RS/SOM teaches that all beings are expressions of and part of Infinite Intelligence, also known as [[Spirit]], [[Higher Consciousness|Christ Consciousness]], or [[God]].  It teaches that, because God is all there is in the universe (not just present in Heaven, or in assigned deities, as believed by traditional teachings), its power can be used by all humans to the extent that they recognize and align themselves with Its presence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religiousscience.org/ucrs_site/philosophy/believe.html What We Believe], [[Ernest Holmes]]&lt;/ref&gt; Ernest Holmes said "God is not ... a person, but a [[Universal mind|Universal Presence]] ... already in our own soul, already operating through our own consciousness."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

The Introduction to "The Science of Mind" text describes "The Thing Itself" (God or Infinite Intelligence), "The Way It Works," "What It Does," and "How to Use It."&lt;ref&gt;Holmes(1926) pp. 25&amp;ndash;60&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Holmes was criticized for not focusing much on love, he did say that "Love rules through Law." (i.e., the Law of Mind or Cause and Effect) and "Love points the way and Law makes the way possible." &lt;ref&gt;Vahle(1993) pp. 12, 13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holmes(1926) p43&lt;/ref&gt;  The "Law of Cause and Effect" simply states that every action has a consequence &amp;mdash; creative, destructive, or neutral.  It can be described as Jesus Christ stated  "You reap what you sow" and "The bread you cast upon the water, comes back to you".  [[Law of attraction (New Thought)|The Law of Attraction]] is one aspect of that Law.  It differs from the Hindu definition of  [[karma]] in that it is not related to reincarnation and that it happens in this life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/karma Definition of "karma"]&lt;/ref&gt; Personal responsibility is a major tenet of RS/SOM.

RS/SOM teaches that people can achieve more fulfilling lives through the practice called Spiritual Mind Treatment (Treatment), or [[Affirmative Prayer]]. [[affirmative prayer|Spiritual Mind Treatment]] is a step-by-step process, in which one states the desired outcome as if it has already happened. In that way, it differs from traditional [[prayer]], since it does not ask an entity separate from  itself to act. It declares human partnership with Infinite Intelligence to achieve success. Treatment is to be stated as personal (first person), positive, powerful (with feeling), and present (is happening right now). The goal is to gain clarity in thinking that guides action to be consistent with the desired outcome. The Treatment is believed to set off a new chain of causation in Mind that leads one to act according to the good for which one is treating.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes(1926) pp. 181&amp;ndash;323&lt;/ref&gt;  Spiritual Mind Treatment, as currently taught in RS/SOM centers, contains five steps: Recognition, Unification, Realization, Thanksgiving, and Release.&lt;ref&gt;Vahle(1993) p150&lt;/ref&gt; Some adherents of RS/SOM also use supplemental [[meditation]] techniques, including "Visioning".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religiousscience.org/ucrs_site/education/visioning.html Visioning], United Church of Religious Science&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beliefs===
Religious Science credo, adapted from Ernest Holmes "What I Believe":&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religiousscience.org/ucrs_site/philosophy/believe.html "What We Believe"], United Church of Religious Science&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|
# We believe in God, the living Spirit Almighty; one, indestructible, absolute, and self-existent Cause. This One manifests Itself in and through all creation, but is not absorbed by Its creation. The manifest universe is the body of God; it is the logical and necessary outcome of the infinite self-knowingness of God.
# We believe in the individualization of the Spirit in Us, and that all people are individualizations of the One Spirit.
# We believe in the eternality, the immortality, and the continuity of the individual soul, forever and ever expanding.
# We believe that heaven is within us, and that we experience it to the degree that we become conscious of it.
# We believe the ultimate goal of life to be a complete freedom from all discord of every nature, and that this goal is sure to be attained by all.
# We believe in the unity of all life, and that the highest God and the innermost God is one God. We believe that God is personal to all who feel this indwelling presence.
# We believe in the direct revelation of truth through our intuitive and spiritual nature, and that anyone may become a revealer of truth who lives in close contact with the indwelling God.
# We believe that the Universal Spirit, which is God, operates through a Universal Mind, which is the Law of God; and that we are surrounded by this Creative Mind which receives the direct impress of our thought and acts upon it.
# We believe in the healing of the sick through the power of this Mind.
# We believe in the control of conditions through the power of this Mind.
# We believe in the eternal Goodness, the eternal Loving-kindness, and the eternal Givingness of Life to all.
# We believe in our own soul, our own spirit, and our own destiny; for we understand that the life of all is God.
}}

=== Core concepts ===

According to ''The Science of Mind'', the ten core concepts of RS/SOM (as taught in the "Foundations of Science of Mind" class) are:&lt;ref&gt;Holmes(1926) pp. 63&amp;ndash;105, 108&amp;ndash;111, 137&amp;ndash;162, 266&amp;ndash;293, 357&amp;ndash;389&lt;/ref&gt;

#There is One Cosmic Reality Principle and Presence in the Universe &amp;mdash; commonly called "God". All creation originates in this One Source.  ''EXPLANATION:  God is not one thing, but rather is an Energy Source or Infinite Intelligence present in everything in the Cosmos (i.e. everything seen and unseen in this and all other parallel dimensions of the Universe).''
#God is threefold (triune) in nature, having three aspects or modes of being within the One: Spirit, Soul and Body. This is God seen as the Universal Macrocosm.  ''EXPLANATION:  The term "Universal Macrocosm" is another term for all dimensions of the Universe.
#Spirit is the great Causative Power of the Universe. The Word, or thought, of God eternally initiates the Divine Creative Process. In this process, Law is continuously set in motion to create, from the Unformed Substance, innumerable forms which follow the thought-patterns of Spirit.  ''EXPLANATION:  God consciously initiates creation with thought and thereby forms all things from unformed substance by using Its "Soul" (i.e. the impersonal Law of Cause and Effect &amp;mdash; that is "What you sow is what you reap."  See further explanation in the second paragraph of this "Teachings and Practices" Section.  Since God is in everything (see #1), humans include God; and  humans can use that God-energy to create, on the human level.''
#In the Infinite Nature of God, all conceivable Good is eternally available, ready to flow into human experience. Through some cosmic Process, this flow of Good is activated and/or increased by human belief, faith, and acceptance. The expression of this essential belief, faith, and acceptance is prayer.  ''EXPLANATION:  "Prayer" is "Spiritual Mind Treatment" (see third paragraph of this section, above).  This is the main Religious Science technique to tap into God (defined in #1 as "present in everything" &amp;mdash; i.e. Its "Infinite Nature") to create all the good we desire on the human level, analogous to God creating on the Universe level (see #3).  This requires faith in the knowledge that the technique is working right now.''
#This is a Universe of Wholeness, Allness, Oneness. Spirit is a transcendent, perfect Wholeness that, in Its infinite inclusivity, harmoniously embraces all seeming opposites.  ''EXPLANATION:  Since God is present throughout the Universe these are some of the attributes of God.''
#This is a Universe of infinite abundance, spiritual, mental, and physical. This Bounty of Spirit, this Allness of Good, is limitless and can never be depleted.  ''EXPLANATION:  These are some more of the attributes of God.''
#This is a reciprocal Universe. For every visible form, there is an invisible counterpart. Everything in nature tends to equalize itself, to keep its balance true.  ''EXPLANATION:  This is the Law of Cause and Effect (See further explanation in the second paragraph of this "Teachings and Practices" Section).''
#The Universe exists in the Eternal Now, each moment complete and perfect within itself. In this Universal Harmony, justice without judgment is always automatic, an infallible Universal Principle. There can be no place for Divine anger, unforgiveness, or punishment.  ''EXPLANATION:  God's and human's thoughts, actions, and manifestations can only occur in the present.  The Law of Cause and Effect is always working.  We make our "Heaven and Hell" experiences every moment in the present, with the choices we make.  To the extent that mankind achieves the Divine attributes, it evolves into God's attributes.''
#Immortality is a Universal Principle, not a "belief' or a bargain made with the Universe for good behavior. God knows only Life, its eternal continuity, evolution, and expansion.  ''EXPLANATION:  Religious Scientists know (rather than believe) that life evolves in this as well as all other dimensions, even after our souls make their transition into those dimensions.  In this case, the term "Universal" means "no exceptions."''
#The mystic concept of the Cosmic Christ is not that of a person, but of a Principle, a Universal Presence ... the Universal Image of God present in all creation ... the "pattern that connects."  ''EXPLANATION:  The term "Cosmic Christ" here is a metaphor for that God-like consciousness that was and is present in all the Prophets and other enlightened people who have and are using this Principle to assist in the positive evolution of mankind, society, and/or their own personal lives.  "[[Christ]]" was not Jesus' last name, but rather a title for an enlightened person, or "anointed one" that was created and given to him before the 12th century A.D.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Christ Christ], Merriam Webster on-line Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; Early Hebrew kings were given the title "Christ." &lt;ref&gt;"Light From the Language of Jesus," by Rocco A. Errico, [[Science of Mind Magazine]], September 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organizations ==

[[File:Richard Worley Flag.svg|thumb|right|Worley's flag design, a variant of the "[[Jolly Roger]]"]]'''Richard Worley''' (d.1718–19) was a [[pirate]] who was active in the [[Caribbean Sea]] and the [[East Coast of the United States|east coast]] of the [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonies]] during the early 18th century. He is credited as one of the earliest pirates to fly the first version of the [[Jolly Roger|skull and crossbones]] pirate flag.

==Piracy==
He is first recorded leaving [[New York City|New York]] with a small boat and a crew of eight men hoping to make their fortune in the so-called [[Golden Age of Piracy]]. However, their first prize resulted in the capture of household goods from a [[shallop]] in the [[Delaware River]] near [[New Castle, Delaware|New Castle]] in September 1718.&lt;ref name="Johnson1725"&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|1725}}&lt;/ref&gt; This attack was technically [[burglary]] rather than piracy, as according to British maritime law at the time the attack did not take place in [[international waters]].&lt;ref name="Seitz"&gt;{{cite book |title =Under the Black Flag | first =Don Carlos | last =Seitz | coauthors= | month = | year =2002 | publisher =Courier Dover Publications | pages =162–164 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=i7NLrJnuzHQC&amp;pg=PA162&amp;lpg=PA162&amp;dq=%22richard+worley%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tRvHsqKf8L&amp;sig=cEQfnLAVZoo9xluKR4gdYdqcgp4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=GmgFSpOfGNSTkAW-tsTWBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10#PPA162,M1 | isbn =978-0-486-42131-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local authorities mistakenly attributed the attack to Worley's better-known counterpart [[Blackbeard]], who had raided the same waterways earlier in the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title =Blackbeard | first =Angus | last =Konstam | coauthors= | month = | year =2006 | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons| page = 207| url = | isbn =0-471-75885-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vessels were armed and sent to intercept the robbers but, after cruising for several days without setting sight on Worley, returned empty-handed.&lt;ref name="Johnson1725"/&gt;

Their second prize brought better luck as, upon capturing a [[sloop]] bound for [[Philadelphia]], Worley also gained four additional crew members. A few days later they requisitioned another sloop bound for [[Port of Hull|Hull]] which, as well as being in better condition, was fully provisioned which they had desperate need of.&lt;ref name="Johnson1725"/&gt;

They left the Delaware and set out to sea to the [[Bahamas]], however, [[George I of Great Britain|King George I]] issued a royal proclamation for the capture and execution of pirates who chose not to accept a royal pardon from the British government. Although the 24-gun warship [[HMS Phoenix (1694)|HMS ''Phoenix'']] was sent out after Worley, he and his crew were able to evade capture.

==Sailing the Spanish Main==
After six weeks off the Bahamas, he captured a [[brigantine]] and a [[sloop]], increased his crew to about twenty-five and gained six cannons and numerous smallarms.&lt;ref name="Johnson1725"/&gt; The brigantine was released, but the sloop sunk, to prevent it from returning to its home port of New York where it would raise alarm.&lt;ref name="Johnson1725"/&gt; It was during this time that he began flying his official colors of a black flag with a white [[Skull and crossbones (symbol)|Death's Head]] in its centre and the crew agreed upon a set of articles, which included a vow to fight to the death rather than surrender to authorities.&lt;ref name="Johnson1725"/&gt;

==Capture==
Worley’s ship ''New York's Revenge'' was sailing alongside a second larger ship under captain [[John Cole (pirate)|John Cole]] called ''New York Revenge’s Revenge''. Cole’s ship had been the prisoner transport ''Eagle'', captured by Worley off Virginia the previous month. South Carolina Governor [[Robert Johnson (governor)|Robert Johnson]] sent four ships after Worley and Cole; the pirate hunters split up and chased them down separately, capturing Cole some hours after Worley when Cole tried to flee the battle. Cole's ship was still carrying prisoners, including 36 women destined to be sold into [[indentured servitude]].&lt;ref name="Adams"&gt;{{cite book|last1=McIlwaine|first1=Henry Read|last2=Adams|first2=Herbert|title=The Struggle of Protestant Dissenters for Religious Toleration in Virginia|date=1894|publisher=Johns Hopkins Press|location=Baltimore MD|pages=113-123|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UYFMAQAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=3 August 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two separate accounts of Worley's demise exist; one in [[Captain Charles Johnson]]'s original book and a subsequent one sent to Johnson by an eye-witness.

===Johnson's Original Account===
Worley soon prepared to make his return to the colonies, where others such as Blackbeard and [[Stede Bonnet]] were enjoying success off [[Virginia]] and [[the Carolinas]]. When Worley pulled into an inlet near [[Charleston, South Carolina]] to clean his ship, the Governor was informed of his presence and sent two sloops of militiamen against him, one fitted with eight guns and the other with six.&lt;ref name="Johnson1725"/&gt; Worley set sail and the sloops followed him north to the coast of Virginia to [[Jamestown, Virginia]].&lt;ref name="Johnson1725"/&gt; Upon seeing what he assumed were two merchant ships, he hoisted his black flag causing much alarm amongst the Jamestown residents who thought they were to be attacked by not one, but three, pirate ships, and beat to arms to defend themselves.&lt;ref name="Johnson1725"/&gt;

Worley fired a shot at the sloops but as they drew near he realised his mistake and he and his crew prepared to follow their vow and to all fight to the death.&lt;ref name="Johnson1725"/&gt; One sloop fired a broadside and drew up to his [[Stern|quarter]] and the other to his [[Bow (ship)|bow]] before boarding.&lt;ref name="Johnson1725"/&gt; Worley and his crew, outnumbered by three to one, drew up on the [[Deck (ship)|deck]] to fight a bloody last stand.&lt;ref name="Johnson1725"/&gt; All were killed bar Worley and one other, who were both severely wounded, and brought ashore in irons.&lt;ref name="Johnson1725"/&gt; They were hanged the next day (17 Feb 1719) in public to ensure they received a very visible punishment and didn't instead die of their wounds hidden in jail.&lt;ref name="Johnson1725"/&gt;

===Eye-witness Account===
In October 1718 the Governor of Charles Town, [[Robert Johnson (governor)|Robert Johnson]] was informed that a pirate ship commanded by Capt. [[William Moody (pirate)|William Moody]] (but actually commanded by Worley) had been sighted off the bar of Charles Town and carried fifty guns and two hundred men.&lt;ref name="Johnson1726"&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|1726}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Governor and his council decided to [[commandeer]] the thirty gun "''King William''" [[galleon]] , the twenty-four gun "''Mediterranean''" galleon, the eight gun "''Revenge''" sloop (formerly belonging to [[Stede Bonnet]]) and a six gun sloop ''Sea Nymph'' to attack the pirate and offered a share of their cargo as incentive.&lt;ref name="Johnson1726"/&gt;

Scout ships were sent out to track the pirate and to prevent him from entering Charles Town port.&lt;ref name="Johnson1726"/&gt; Several weeks passed before a ship and a sloop approached the harbour, weighed anchor and signalled for a [[Maritime pilot|pilot]].&lt;ref name="Johnson1726"/&gt; None was sent as they suspected it to be Moody and several days elapsed during which time the pirates attempted to land on [[Sullivan's Island, South Carolina|Sullivan's Island]] to find fresh water, but were obstructed by the scout ships.&lt;ref name="Johnson1726"/&gt;

The Governor decided that his fleet of four ships and three-hundred men was a match for the pirate ship and sloop so sailed towards them with his soldiers and arms concealed.&lt;ref name="Johnson1726"/&gt; As they neared the pirate sloop it raised its black flag, started to manoeuvre and was soon copied by the pirate ship.&lt;ref name="Johnson1726"/&gt; When the Governor's fleet came within range he hoisted his colours and his men rushed upon the decks and gave the pirates a broadside who immediately tried to run.&lt;ref name="Johnson1726"/&gt; The pirate sloop was pummelled with broadsides and most of its men fled into the [[Hold (ship)|hold]] with the exception of Worley and a few others who died in the cross-fire upon deck.&lt;ref name="Johnson1726"/&gt;

The other pirate ship was boarded and found to be a convict ship formerly called the "''Eagle''" which had been sailing from London to Virginia with convicts but had been captured by Worley.&lt;ref name="Johnson1726"/&gt; It carried a hundred or more men who had joined the pirate and were taken ashore and hanged.&lt;ref name="Johnson1726"/&gt; Thirty convict women were also on board and it was decided to send them to [[the Bahamas]] but they died through lack of provisions before this could be done.&lt;ref name="Johnson1726"/&gt;

As for Moody he received word of the Governor's fleet and set sail for [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]] and was to later accept the King's pardon&lt;ref name="Johnson1726"/&gt; (though other sources have Moody active as a pirate well after 1718, so he may have returned to piracy after taking the pardon&lt;ref name="Grey - Eastern Seas"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grey|first1=Charles|title=Pirates of the eastern seas (1618-1723): a lurid page of history|date=1933|publisher=S.

The Governor disbanded his fleet and shared out the booty between his men.&lt;ref name="Johnson1726"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5825">'''Sergio Atzeni''' (14 October 1952 in [[Capoterra]] – 6 September 1995 in [[Carloforte]]) was an [[Italy|Italian]] writer.

Born in [[Capoterra]], southern [[Sardinia]], he moved to [[Cagliari]] where, as a journalist, he worked for some of the most important Sardinian newspapers. He also became a member of the [[Italian Communist Party]], but later left the party, being disillusioned with politics. In 1986, he left Sardinia and travelled across Europe, but in the last part of his life he settled in [[Turin]] where he wrote his most important novels, including ''Il figlio di Bakunìn'' (''Bakunin's Son''), ''Passavamo sulla terra leggeri'' and ''Il quinto passo è l'addio''. In 1995, he died in [[Carloforte]] while swimming in the sea during a holiday back in Sardinia.

All of Atzeni's works are set in Sardinia and were written in Italian.
He experimented different techniques and styles across his novels. 
Most notably, he used a very original language that fused elegant literary Italian and the "[[patter]]" used by the [[working-class]] in Cagliari and Sardinia, where many words and sayings are borrowed from the [[Sardinian language]]. In this way Atzeni reproduces the immediacy of the spoken language in his novels.
In some of his novels (e.g. ''Il quinto passo è l'addio'' and ''Bellas mariposas'') he also used techniques akin to the "[[magic realism]]" style of many Southern American authors, where fantastic elements appear in the realistic setting.

Sergio Atzeni is considered, with [[Giulio Angioni]] and [[Salvatore Mannuzzu]], one of the initiators of the so-called [[Sardinian Literary Spring]], the Sardinian narrative of today in the European arena, which followed the work of individual prominent figures such as [[Grazia Deledda]], [[Emilio Lussu]], [[Giuseppe Dessì]], [[Gavino Ledda]], [[Salvatore Satta]]. Some of his novels have been translated in French, but only one, ''Bakunin's Son'', has been translated in English.

== Bibliography ==

*''Aray Dimoniu ''(1984) 
A short tale inspired by Sardinian traditional tales of demons and magic.

*''L'Apologo del giudice bandito'' (1986) ([[Apologue]] of the Bandit Judge)
Set in the year 1492 in Cagliari. Starting from an imaginary trial of the Spanish rulers of Sardinia against the [[locusts]] that were spreading famine in Sardinia, several characters are introduced, including the Spanish viceroy, Spanish soldiers and aristocrats, humble Sardinian peasants and drunkards, and finally the Sardinian chief (a "Judge" according to the Sardinian medieval tradition) that gives the name to the novel.

*''Il figlio di Bakunin'' (1991) (Bakunin's Son)
A son tries to find out more about his father: every person interviewed by the son speaks in first person and tells a story about the son's father. The son discovers his father was from a borgeouise family, then became a miner in the 1930s, and a political activist and member of parliament after the war. In this way, the book spans the dramatic changes between the beginning of the 20th century and the 1950s in Sardinia, as experienced and told from the different characters in the book.
This book is available in English by Italica Press [http://www.italicapress.com/index087.html]

*''Il quinto passo è l'addio'' (1995) (The Fifth Step is a Farewell).
This novel is probably the most autobiographical of Atzeni's novels. It tells the story of a man that while on a ferryboat, leaving Sardinia for good, remembers and revokes his past experiences in Cagliari, including an unhappy love story and several frustrations and humiliations caused by the corruption and small-mindedness of politicians and employers.

*''Passavamo sulla terra leggeri'' (1996) (Lightly We Passed on Earth )
This novel was published after Atzeni's death, but Atzeni had submitted it to the publisher before his death. The narrator of the book is asked to preserve the memory of Sardinian history by an old acquaintance and so is told the history of Sardinia, from the mythical origins to the defeat of the independent kingdom of [[Arborea]] and the final conquest of Sardinia by the Spaniards in the 15th Century.

*''Bellas Mariposas ''(1996)  (Beautiful Butterflies)
This was also published after Atzeni's death, but it was still a work in progress. It is a short story told in a first person narrative by a young girl from a working-class neighbourhood of Cagliari. The language used borrows many phrases and words from the Sardinian dialect spoken in Cagliari, and even the title of the story itself is in Sardinian.

*''Due colori esistono al mondo, il verde è il secondo ''(1997)
A collection of poetry

*''Raccontar fole ''(1999)
An essay on the misleading representation of Sardinia given by historians and travellers in the 18th and 19th century.
 
*''Racconti con colonna sonora ''(2002 )
A collection of short stories, mainly crime-fiction stories.

*''Gli anni della grande peste ''(2003)
A collection of newspaper articles and short stories published in different magazines.

*''I sogni della città bianca ''(2005)

}}'''Stuart Zachary Taylor Wood''', [[Order of St Michael and St George|CMG]] (October 17, 1889 &amp;ndash; January 4, 1966) served as the ninth [[Commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police]], from March 6, 1938 to April 30, 1951.&lt;ref name="WW"&gt;''[[Who's Who (UK)|Who's Who]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Born in [[Napanee, Ontario]], Wood's father, [[Zachary Taylor Wood]], CMG served in the [[North-West Mounted Police]] from 1885 to 1915 and was Acting Commissioner of the Force.&lt;ref name="WW" /&gt;

Wood attended the [[Royal Military College of Canada]] in [[Kingston, Ontario]] where he graduated in 1912. Shortly after he secured a commission in the RNW Mounted Police and served with the Force until his retirement in 1951, almost forty years.&lt;ref&gt;Royal Military College of Canada - Review Yearbook (Kingston, Ontario Canada) - Class of 1965 p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;

Wood himself served in [[World War I]] as a lieutenant in the cavalry in [[France]] and [[Belgium]]. He served in the Yukon upon returning to Canada in 1919 as Justice of the Peace, Coroner, Sheriff, Game Inspector and Customs Officer.

==Reforms==
When Wood became an Acting Royal Canadian Mounted Police commissioner he initiated many changes. Through 1945 and 1946 he established a system of registration for aliens, and dealt with espionage cases. In the North, he recruited new policing detachments. He organized a permanent [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] Band, (later disbanded by Commissioner Inkster in 1994). He established the first RCMP scientific laboratory and museum in [[Regina, Saskatchewan]].

Wood also established a horse breeding station at Fort Walsh. He improved wireless communication and broadcasting and instituted a preventive policing program for youth. He negotiated provincial policing contracts for [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] and [[British Columbia]]. Under his leadership the RCMP force grew gradually and scientific methods of crime detection improved enhancing law enforcement and crime prevention. Wood retired from the RCMP in 1951 and died in 1966. He was buried in [[Regina, Saskatchewan]].

==PROFUNC==
In the 1950s Wood was responsible for compiling a "blacklist" called [[PROFUNC]], which was a [[Government of Canada]] [[Classified information|top secret]] plan to identify and detain [[Communism|communist]] sympathizers during the height of the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/montreal/story/2010/10/13/profunc-canadian-communist-blacklist.html?ref=rss CBC: Secret Cold War plan included mass detentions]&lt;/ref&gt;
In October 2010, a joint CBC/Radio-Canada investigation revealed that information gathered under PROFUNC have most probably been used during the 1970 [[October Crisis]], when Canada invoked the [[War Measures Act]] and suspended civil liberties in  Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/fifth/2010-2011/enemiesofthestate/ CBC- The Fifty State :"Enemies of the State" with [[Linden MacIntyre]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Wood was the great-great grandson of U.S. President [[Zachary Taylor]]. Zachary's third daughter, Anne, married Robert C. Wood, a U.S. Regular Army surgeon, who served the Union during the Civil War, though their two sons served the Confederacy. One of their sons, [[John Taylor Wood]], had been an officer in the U.S. Navy, but with the outbreak of the Civil War resigned, later joining the Confederate Marine Corps, and later served as an office in the famed ironclad Virginia/Merrimac during her encounter with the USS Monitor. He afterwards became a lieutenant colonel in the Confederate Army. After the war John Taylor Wood relocated to Canada.

Wood is the nephew of No. 352, Lieut. C.C. Wood, who died of wounds in South Africa in 1899.

Wood's three sons and two daughters, Donald Zachary Taylor Wood KIA, 1944, Constables John Taylor Wood and Theodore Herschel Taylor Wood, also served on the Force.  His son Herschel was killed on duty in 1950. Both Herschel and his father are buried in the RCMP Depot in Regina. Wood's son John retired from the RCMP as Inspector in 1988.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3796">In [[neuroscience]] and [[computer science]], '''synaptic weight''' refers to the strength or [[amplitude]] of a connection between two nodes, corresponding in biology to the amount of influence the [[action potential|firing]] of one [[neuron]] has on another. The term is typically used in [[artificial neural network|artificial]] and [[biological neural network|biological]] [[neural network]] research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Computation==
In a computational neural network, a [[Euclidean vector|vector]] or set of inputs &lt;math&gt;\textbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; and outputs &lt;math&gt;\textbf{y}&lt;/math&gt;, or pre- and post-synaptic neurons respectively, are interconnected with synaptic weights represented by the matrix &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;, where for a linear neuron

:&lt;math&gt;y_j = \sum_i w_{ij} x_i ~~\textrm{or}~~ \textbf{y} = w\textbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;.

The synaptic weight is changed by using a learning rule, the most basic of which is [[Hebb's rule]], which is usually stated in biological terms as 

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Neurons that fire together, wire together.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Computationally, this means that if a large signal from one of the input neurons results in a large signal from one of the output neurons, then the synaptic weight between those two neurons will increase. The rule is unstable, however, and is typically modified using such variations as [[Oja's rule]], [[radial basis functions]] or the [[backpropagation]] algorithm.

==Biology==
For biological networks, the effect of synaptic weights is not as simple as for linear neurons or [[Hebbian learning]]. However, [[biophysics|biophysical]] models such as [[BCM theory]] have seen some success in mathematically describing these networks.

In the mammalian [[central nervous system]], signal transmission is carried out by interconnected networks of nerve cells, or neurons. For the basic [[pyramidal neuron]], the input signal is carried by the [[axon]], which releases neurotransmitter chemicals into the [[synapse]] which is picked up by the [[dendrites]] of the next neuron, which can then generate an [[action potential]] which is analogous to the output signal in the computational case.

The synaptic weight in this process is determined by several variable factors:
* How well the input signal propagates through the axon (see [[myelination]]),
* The amount of neurotransmitter released into the synapse and the amount that can be absorbed in the following cell (determined by the number of [[AMPA receptor|AMPA]] and [[NMDA receptor]]s on the cell membrane and the amount of intracellular [[calcium]] and other ions),
* The number of such connections made by the axon to the dendrites,
* How well the signal propagates and [[integrate-and-fire|integrates]] in the postsynaptic cell.

The changes in synaptic weight that occur is known as [[synaptic plasticity]], and the process behind long-term changes ([[long-term potentiation]] and [[long-term depression|depression]]) is still poorly understood. Hebb's original learning rule was originally applied to biological systems, but has had to undergo many modifications as a number of theoretical and experimental problems came to light.

The '''triffid''' is a [[List of fictional plants|fictitious]] tall, mobile, prolific and highly [[venom]]ous plant species, the titular antagonist in [[John Wyndham]]'s 1951 novel ''[[The Day of the Triffids]]'' and [[Simon Clark (novelist)|Simon Clark]]'s 2001 sequel ''[[The Night of the Triffids]]''.  Triffids were also featured in the [[The Day of the Triffids (radio drama)|1957 BBC radio dramatization]] of Wyndham's book, a considerably altered [[The Day of the Triffids (film)|1962 film adaptation]], a more faithful [[The Day of the Triffids (1981 TV series)|1981 television serial]] produced by the [[BBC]], and in a [[The Day of the Triffids (2009 TV series)|2009 two-part TV series]] also produced by the BBC.

Since 1951, when ''The Day of the Triffids'' was first published, the word "triffid" has become a popular [[British English]] colloquial term for large, overgrown or menacing-looking plants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sca.lib.liv.ac.uk/collections/exhibs/triffidcat.html "The Return of the Triffids . . ." The John Wyndham Archive] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206193845/http://sca.lib.liv.ac.uk/collections/exhibs/triffidcat.html |date=2010-02-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional history==

===Origins=== 
The origin of the triffid species is never fully revealed in Wyndham's novel. The novel's central character, Bill Masen, dismisses the idea that they are a naturally occurring species, or that they are [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] in origin:

{{quote|My own belief, for what that is worth, is that they were the outcome of a series of ingenious biological meddlings—and very likely accidental, at that. Had they been evolved anywhere but in the region they were, we should doubtless have had a well&amp;#8209;documented ancestry for them.&lt;ref name="day"&gt;Wyndham, ''The Day of the Triffids'', ch. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The 1981 TV series and some editions of the book have Masen speculating that the triffids were the creation of the real-life [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[biologist]] [[Trofim Lysenko]]. According to Masen's narration, the triffids first came to the attention of the [[Western world]] when a man named Umberto Christoforo Palanguez presented the Arctic &amp; European Fish Oil Company with a mysterious [[vegetable oil]] originating from [[Russian SFSR|Russia]]. Once the scientists of Arctic and European realised how potent the oil was, Palanguez' offer to smuggle some seeds of the plant out of Russia was accepted. Palanguez disappeared, but Masen guesses that his plane carrying the triffid seeds was shot down by the [[Red Air Force]], allowing the seeds to be carried all over the globe by wind.&lt;ref name="day" /&gt;

===Name===
According to Wyndham's novel, the name "triffid" alludes to the plant's three leg-like protrusions and was originally "trifid",&lt;ref name="Wyndham trifid"&gt;John Wyndham, ''The Day Of The Triffids'', chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt; Latin for "split into three parts".&lt;ref name="MW trifid"&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/trifid Merriam-Webster:  trifid]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Initial outbreaks and exploitation===
The first triffid outbreaks occur in [[Indochina]], where they receive little press attention until triffids also appear in [[Sumatra]], [[Borneo]], [[Belgian Congo]], [[Colombia]], [[Brazil]] and other equatorial regions. Although they develop faster in tropical zones, triffids soon establish themselves worldwide outside the [[Polar region|polar]] and [[desert]] regions. When it is discovered that triffids are predatory, they are almost exterminated until they are identified as the source of the valuable oil. Upon discovery that [[Docking (animal)|docking]] their stingers renders them harmless, docked triffids soon become fashionable in public and private gardens. As it takes triffids two years to fully regrow their stings, captive triffids are safe if pruned annually. Triffid farms are built to produce triffid oil, which is of greater quality when taken from undocked specimens.&lt;ref name="day" /&gt;

===During and after the Great Blinding===
After a large part of the Earth's human population is rendered blind by a brightly-coloured [[comet]] shower, triffids escape confinement and go on the rampage, killing large numbers of people. They soon overrun [[mainland Europe]] and the [[British Isles]], thus forcing the majority of survivors to escape to the [[Isle of Wight]] and other islands.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In [[Simon Clark (novelist)|Simon Clark]]'s 2001 book ''The Night of the Triffids'', set 25 years after the events of Wyndham's original book, triffids in the British Isles are still valued as energy and food sources.&lt;ref name="pod"&gt;Clark, ''The Night of the Triffids'', ch. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to an annual cull, Triffids remain absent on the Isle of Wight, until they are transported there by large floating mats of debris and vegetation. Triffids also become more aggressive because a comet shower has blotted out the sun, thus forcing them to increase their nutritional intake. In North America, standard triffids develop a form of echolocation,&lt;ref name="echo" /&gt; swamp-dwelling triffids become fully aquatic&lt;ref name="swamp"&gt;Clark, ''The Night of the Triffids'', ch. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; and a small number of giant triffids attack [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref name="giant" /&gt; Members of the [[Algonquin people|Algonquin]] tribe escape attack owing to their immunity to triffid venom.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, ''The Night of the Triffids'', ch. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the sequel, it is revealed that owing to their constant exposure to small doses of triffid venom in their food, a quarter of the inhabitants of the Isle of Wight are also immune to triffid venom, thus encouraging them to return to the British mainland.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, ''The Night of the Triffids'', ch. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==

===Appearance and habits===
[[File:Booletriff.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|A botanical drawing of a triffid by Bryan Poole for the ''Science Fiction Classics'' (1998)]]

According to the novel, the fictitious triffid can be divided into three components: base, trunk, and head (which contains a venomous sting). In ''The Day of the Triffids'', adult triffids are described as typically {{convert|7|ft|m}} in height. European triffids never exceed {{convert|8|ft|m}}, while those in tropical areas can reach {{convert|10|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name="day" /&gt; In ''The Night of the Triffids'', a small number of North American triffids reach {{convert|60|ft|m}} in height.&lt;ref name="giant"&gt;Clark, ''The Night of the Triffids'', ch. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

The base of a triffid is a large muscle-like root mass, comprising three blunt appendages. When dormant, these appendages draw nutrients, as on a normal plant. When active, triffids use these appendages to propel themselves. The character Masen describes the triffid's locomotion thus:

{{quote|When it "walked" it moved rather like a man on crutches. Two of the blunt "legs" slid forward, then the whole thing lurched as the rear one drew almost level with them, then the two in front slid forward again. At each "step" the long stem whipped violently back and forth; it gave one a kind of seasick feeling to watch it. As a method of progress it looked both strenuous and clumsy—faintly reminiscent of young elephants at play. One felt that if it were to go on lurching for long in that fashion it would be bound to strip all its leaves if it did not actually break its stem. Nevertheless, ungainly though it looked, it was contriving to cover the ground at something like an average walking pace.&lt;ref name="day"/&gt;}}

Above the base are upturned leafless sticks which the triffid drums against its stem. The exact purpose of this is not fully explained in ''The Day of the Triffids''; it is originally assumed that they are part of the reproductive system, but Bill Masen's colleague Walter Lucknor believes that they are employed for communication. It is revealed that removal of these sticks causes the triffid to physically deteriorate.&lt;ref name="day" /&gt; In ''The Night of the Triffids'', the character Gabriel Deeds speculates that the vibrations made by the triffid's sticks serve as a form of [[acoustic location|echolocation]].&lt;ref name="echo"&gt;Clark, ''The Night of the Triffids'', ch. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

The upper part of a triffid consists of a stem ending in a funnel-like formation containing a sticky substance which traps insects, much like a [[pitcher plant]]. Also housed within the funnel is a stinger which, when fully extended, can measure {{convert|10|ft|m}} in length. When attacking, a triffid will lash the sting at its target, primarily aiming for its prey's face or head, with considerable speed and force. Contact with bare skin can kill a person instantly. Once its prey has been stung and killed, a triffid will root itself beside the body and feed on it as it decomposes.&lt;ref name="day" /&gt;

Triffids reproduce by inflating a dark green pod below the top of the funnel until it bursts, releasing white seeds (95% of which are infertile) into the air.&lt;ref name="day" /&gt;

Aquatic triffids appear in ''The Night of the Triffids''; but remain largely unseen, with the exceptions of their stingers: the latter described as [[prehensile]].&lt;ref name="swamp" /&gt;

===Intelligence===
A recurring question in ''The Day of the Triffids'' is whether or not triffids are intelligent or merely acting on set instincts. The character Lucknor states that although triffids lack a [[central nervous system]], they nonetheless display what he considers intelligence:

{{quote|And there's certainly intelligence there, of a kind. Have you noticed that when they attack they always go for the unprotected parts? Almost always the head—but sometimes the hands. And another thing: if you look at the statistics of casualties, just take notice of the proportion that has been stung across the eyes and blinded. It's remarkable—and significant.&lt;ref name="day"/&gt;}}

Later, after the Great Blinding, the triffids herd blind people into cramped spaces in order to kill more easily,&lt;ref&gt;Wyndham, ''The Day of the Triffids'', ch.5.&lt;/ref&gt; or root themselves beside houses, waiting for the occupants.&lt;ref&gt;Wyndham, ''The Day of the Triffids'', ch. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearances==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2017}}
Triffids were illustrated on the front cover of the first edition of ''The Day of the Triffids''.

The triffids made their first screen appearance in [[Steve Sekely]]'s 1962 [[The Day of the Triffids (film)|film adaptation]]. The triffids are portrayed as extraterrestrial lifeforms transported to Earth by comets. This is directly contradictory of the literary source, in which Bill Masen states:

{{quote|In the books there is quite a lot of loose speculation on the sudden occurrence of the triffids. Most of it is nonsense. Certainly they were not spontaneously generated, as many simple souls believed. Nor did most people endorse the theory that they were a kind of sample visitation—harbingers of worse to come if the world did not mend its ways and behave its troublesome self. Nor did their seeds float to us through space as specimens of the horrid forms life might assume upon other, less favoured worlds—at least I am satisfied that they did not.&lt;ref name="day"/&gt;}}

This is later reinforced in ''The Night of the Triffids'', in which a young David Masen replies negatively to his teacher's question as to whether or not triffids are extraterrestrial.&lt;ref name="pod" /&gt;

The 1962 film triffids (now given the [[binomial name]] ''Triffidus celestus'') also differ physically: the film triffids were designed with flaying tentacles below their stems, which they use as slashing weapons and to drag their dead prey. Also, their stinger is shown as a gas-propelled projectile, rather than a coiled tendril. Finally, the film triffids are vulnerable to [[sea water]].

Triffids later appeared in the [[The Day of the Triffids (1981 TV series)|1981 BBC serial]], in which they are portrayed much as described in the book. Designed by [[Steve Drewett]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= |first= |date= |title=In the Kingdom of the Blind: BBC's The Day of the Triffids |url= http://www.phantomframe.co.uk/triffids.htm |work= Phantom Frame |location= [[Heaton, Greater Manchester]], UK |access-date= 2016-06-17 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20040708004523/http://www.phantomframe.co.uk/triffids.htm | archivedate=2004-07-08 | dead-url= yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; the triffids were operated by a man crouched inside, cooled by a fan installed in its neck; the 'clackers' were radio-controlled. The gnarled bole—based on the ginseng root—was made of latex with a covering of sawdust and string, while the neck was fibreglass and continued to the floor, where it joined with the operator's seat. The plants were surmounted by a flexible rubber head, coated with clear gunge. After the end of the production, one was displayed for a time in the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] in London, where Drewett had once been employed. Some inferior copies of the props were later used in a cocktail party sketch in an episode of ''[[Alexei Sayle's Stuff]]''.

Triffids, based on the 1981 TV design, and a triffid gun, make an appearance in ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Black Dossier]]'', a 2007 graphic novel written by [[Alan Moore]] and drawn by [[Kevin O'Neill (comics)|Kevin O'Neill]].

In the [[The Day of the Triffids (2009 TV series)|2009 two-part TV series]], the triffids are portrayed as a naturally occurring species from [[Zaire]], discovered by the West and selectively bred as an alternative to fossil fuels, in order to avert [[global warming]]. Rather than walking on three blunt stumps, the triffids drag themselves with prehensile roots which can also constrict their prey. Their stalk is surrounded by large [[agave]]-like leaves, and they secrete their oil (green rather than the novel's pink) from their surfaces. Their stingers, which in previous film adaptations could not penetrate glass, are powerful enough to shatter windows, like those of the original triffids of the novel. Instead of a cup they have a pink flower-like head, resembling a cross between a [[lily]] and a [[sweet pea]], that enlarges before releasing the sting.

In the online videogame ''[[Kingdom of Loathing]]'', triffids are a monster located within an area known as "the Spooky Forest". &lt;ref&gt;http://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Triffid&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mobile game for "The Simpsons" named "The Simpsons: Tapped Out", one of the options to plant in Cletus' Farm are triffids, which comically bring about the 'end of humanity'.

'''Venusaur''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|v|iː|n|ə|ˌ|s|ɔː|r}}), known in Japan as {{nihongo|'''Fushigibana'''|フシギバナ|}}, is a Grass/Poison type [[List of Pokémon|Pokémon species]] in [[Nintendo]] and [[Game Freak]]'s ''[[Pokémon]]'' franchise. Created by [[Ken Sugimori]], Venusaur first appeared in the video games [[Pokémon Red and Blue|''Pokémon Red'' and ''Blue'']] and subsequent sequels, later appearing in various merchandise, spinoff titles and animated and printed adaptations of the franchise. Venusaur is capable of Mega Evolution, which allows it to transform into Mega Venusaur. It is evolved from Ivysaur, then came from [[Bulbasaur]].

Venusaur was one of 151 different designs conceived by Game Freak's character development team and finalized by [[Ken Sugimori]] for the first generation of the ''[[Pokémon (series)|Pokémon]]'' games ''Red'' and ''Green'', which were localized outside Japan as [[Pokémon Red and Blue|''Pokémon Red'' and ''Blue'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/interview/irbj/vol1/index2.html |title=2. 一新されたポケモンの世界 |page=2 |work=Nintendo.com |publisher=[[Nintendo]] |accessdate=September 10, 2010 |author=Staff |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=91965 |title=Game Freak on Pokémon! |author=Stuart Bishop |publisher=CVG |date=May 30, 2003 |accessdate=February 7, 2008 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5VSJaR6xT?url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=91965 |archivedate=February 8, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its English name, its design was confirmed by Ken Sugimori to be based on [[frog]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/interview/irbj/sp/index4.html |title=女子大生が訊く ポケットモンスターブラック・ホワイト |publisher=[[Nintendo]] |accessdate=October 28, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230153442/http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/interview/irbj/sp/index4.html|archivedate=December 30, 2010|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Venusaur was originally named "Fushigibana" in Japanese, which is a combination of the words fushigi and hana, which mean mystery and flower, respectively. Unlike its pre-evolutions, there is a difference between the male and female Venusaurs. The female has a seed in the center of its flower, while the male does not. Nintendo decided to give the various Pokémon species "clever and descriptive names" related to their appearance or features when translating the game for western audiences as a means to make the characters more relatable to American children.&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/99/1122/cover2.html|title=PokéMania|last=Chua-Euan|first=Howard|date=November 22, 1999|publisher=TIME|accessdate=September 15, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913182631/http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/99/1122/cover2.html &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=September 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, it was renamed Venusaur, which the gaming website ''[[IGN]]'' wrote was a combination of "venus" from the plant [[Venus Flytrap|venus flytrap]] and "saur" from [[dinosaur]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://guides.ign.com/guides/16708/page_219.html Pokemon Blue Guide &amp; Walkthrough - Game Boy - IGN&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322021136/http://guides.ign.com/guides/16708/page_219.html |date=March 22, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Venusaur, known as the [[Seed]] Pokémon, is the final stage of the [[Bulbasaur]] [[Pokémon evolution|evolution tree]]. The seed on the back of Bulbasaur bloomed into a huge flower, vaguely resembling a [[Rafflesia]]. The flower constantly draws in sunlight for nutrition, characterized by vivid colors and a soothing aroma, and power, which is much more substantial in the summer.&lt;ref name="dexvenusaur1"&gt;'''Pokédex:''' It is able to convert sunlight into energy. As a result, it is more powerful in the summertime. {{cite video game|title=Pokémon Silver |developer=Game Freak |publisher=Nintendo |date=October 15, 2000|platform=Game Boy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dexvenusaur2"&gt;'''Pokédex:''' There is a large flower on VENUSAUR's back. The flower is said to take on vivid colors if it gets plenty of nutrition and sunlight. The flower's aroma soothes the emotions of people. {{cite video game|title=Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire|developer=Game Freak |publisher=Nintendo |date=March 17, 2003 |platform=Game Boy Advance }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are always on the move to absorb more sunlight, though they usually remain quiet and still while absorbing it.&lt;ref name="dexvenusaur3"&gt;'''Pokédex:''' A common sight in forests and woods. It flaps its wings and ground level to kick up blinding sand. {{cite video game|title=Pokémon Leaf Green|developer=Game Freak |publisher=Nintendo |date=September 9, 2004 |platform=Game Boy }}&lt;/ref&gt; After it rains, the aroma is much stronger, which attracts other Pokémon.

Venusaur was given a Mega Evolution about one and a half years into the development of [[Pokémon X and Y|''Pokémon X'' and ''Y'']]. Bulbasaur, along with [[Charmander]] and [[Squirtle]], were added to the game in a significant role in order to allow players to experience its Mega Evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pokemon X/Y: WHY?!

==Appearances==

===In the video games===
Venusaur first appeared in the video games [[Pokémon Red and Blue|''Pokémon Red'' and ''Blue'']] and in its remakes ''[[Pokémon Yellow]]'' and [[Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen|''Pokémon FireRed'' and ''LeafGreen'']]. It served as the mascot for both ''LeafGreen'' and the Japanese exclusive version of ''Red'' and ''Blue'' titled ''Pocket Monsters Green''. It evolves from [[Ivysaur]] which evolves from [[Bulbasaur]], one of the three starting Pokémon available to players in most of the above-mentioned games; in ''Yellow'', Bulbasaur was available at a later point in the game. It has since appeared in every main ''Pokémon'' title since. Outside of the main series, Venusaur appears in ''[[Pokémon Pinball]]'', ''[[Pokémon Trozei!]]'', the ''[[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon]]'' titles, the ''[[Pokémon Ranger]]'' titles, ''[[Pokémon Rumble]]'', and ''[[PokéPark Wii: Pikachu's Adventure]]''. In ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'', it appears in the Saffron City stage and attacks anyone that comes within range of it. It also appears in ''[[Hey You, Pikachu!]]'' where it lives on the Cobalt Coast saying its name in an echoing voice. In ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'', Venusaur appears as a Pokémon that can be summoned from a Poké Ball to attack opponents as well as a collectible trophy. Venusaur is one of several Pokémon in [[Pokémon X and Y|''Pokémon X'' and ''Y'']] that are able to use the new Mega Evolution mechanic, becoming Mega Venusaur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemonxy.com/en-us/pokemon/mega_pokemon/ |title=Mega Pokémon |publisher=Pokemonxy.com |date=September 4, 2013 |accessdate=September 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Venusaur has received positive reception. [[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'s Elijah Watson commented, "most of us grew up" with Venusaur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The 50 Best Pokemon Up to "Pokemon Crystal" |url=http://www.complex.com/video-games/2013/10/best-pokemon-crystal-nintendo/venusaur |work=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]] |last=Watson |first=Elijah |date=October 7, 2013 |accessdate=March 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[GamesRadar]] editor Brett Elston commented that Venusaur "sets the standard for evolutions" - namely that a Pokémon will start off "cute", and then become an "unsightly beast".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamesradar.com/ds/f/the-complete-pokemon-rby-pokedex-part-1/a-200708209459101025/g-2006100415372930075/p-3 The complete Pokemon RBY pokedex, part1|GamesRadar] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414195355/http://www.gamesradar.com/ds/f/the-complete-pokemon-rby-pokedex-part-1/a-200708209459101025/g-2006100415372930075/p-3 |date=April 14, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He noted, however, that while "ugly", Venusaur is also "intimidating".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamesradar.com/f/fugly-pokemon/a-20071010152314397000/p-4 Fugly Pokemon|GamesRadar] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906182817/http://www.gamesradar.com/f/fugly-pokemon/a-20071010152314397000/p-4 |date=September 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; GamesRadar noted Venusaur as Bulbasaur's "greatest drawback", due to its lack of charm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamesradar.com/f/the-top-7-gut-wrenching-choices/a-2009050410717660001/p-4 The Top 7... gut-wrenching choices|GamesRadar]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; GamesRadar's Carolyn Gudmundson named Venusaur the "Pokémon of the week" and called it one of her "favourite" Pokémon. She stated that she "just likes how ugly Venusaur gets" and thought that "Venusaur's face looks like a cat's". Another editor commented that the way its teeth stick out is the "manga cliche of how you draw a cat". Another editor commented that he liked the way how Bulbasaur's flower bloomed as it evolved into Ivysaur and then into Venusaur.&lt;ref name="gamesradar"&gt;[http://www.gamesradar.com/f/pokemon-monday-27-unova-no/a-20101129142452559075 Pokemon Monday 27 - News from Unova|GamesRadar] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817101239/http://www.gamesradar.com/f/pokemon-monday-27-unova-no/a-20101129142452559075 |date=August 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; IGN's Pokémon Chick wrote that since ''Red'' and ''Blue'', the Pokémon Charizard had "slightly surpassed Venusaur in terms of popularity".&lt;ref&gt;[http://faqs.ign.com/articles/380/380258p1.html Pokemon Crystal Version Pokemon of the Day: Bulbasaur (#1) - IGN FAQs&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009160709/http://faqs.ign.com/articles/380/380258p1.html |date=October 9, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a poll conducted by [[IGN]], it was voted as the "15th best" Pokémon, and the staff stated in response that Venusaur didn't matter as much as Blastoise or Charizard, who ranked #3 and #1 respectively, because water cannons or flying and breathing fire was "more dangerous than… a flower".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/top/pokemon/15 |title=Venusaur - #15 Top Pokémon - IGN |publisher=IGN |author=Rich |accessdate=May 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author Daniel Bischoff chose to not evolve Bulbasaur into Venusaur and stated that Venusaur "just looked kind of fat."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tell GR: Which Is Your Favorite Pokémon Of All Time? |url=http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XU9x8G7khv0/SfjGpKcy_yI/AAAAAAAACkU/8CM4fARjK3s/s400/ricky-gervais-460_979683c.jpg |work=Game Revolution |last=Bischoff |first=Daniel |date=October 1, 2013 |accessdate=March 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Series artist [[Ken Sugimori]] noted that Venusaur was his "least favourite" Pokémon due to its complex design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pokémon Art Director Wants The Next Generation To Be Simpler

'''Zabdiel Judah''' (born October 27, 1977) is an American [[professional boxer]]. He is a multiple-time former world champion in two [[weight class (boxing)|weight classes]], having held the [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] and [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]] [[junior welterweight]] titles between 2000 and 2004; the IBF junior welterweight title again in 2011; and the [[undisputed champion|undisputed]] [[welterweight]] title in 2005, which included a reign as the [[lineal championship|lineal]] champion from 2005 to 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/welter.htm|title=The Lineal Welterweight Champs|publisher=The Cyber Boxing Zone Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amateur career==
Judah began boxing at the age of six and compiled an amateur record of 110–5. He was a two-time US national champion and three-time [[New York Golden Gloves]] Champion. He also won the 1996 [[Police Athletic League|PAL]] National Championship. Judah beat [[Ishe Smith]] and [[Hector Camacho, Jr.]], but lost to [[David Díaz (boxer)|David Díaz]] in the finals of the Olympic trials, thus failing to qualify for the Olympic boxing team.&lt;ref name="Canadastar"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.canadastarboxing.com/Fighters/zab-judah-profile.htm | publisher = Canadastar Boxing | title = Zab Judah Profile and Bio | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070208013635/http://www.canadastarboxing.com/Fighters/zab-judah-profile.htm | archivedate = 8 February 2007 | accessdate = 19 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional career==
===Light welterweight===
====Early years====
Judah made his professional debut as an 18-year-old on September 20, 1996, in [[Miami, Florida]] and defeated Michael Johnson by [[technical knockout]] in the second round. On April 14, 1998, Judah defeated Angel Beltre in the second round.&lt;ref name="Canadastar"/&gt; Judah accidentally butted heads with Esteban Flores in a fight in March 1999. Flores was cut on his forehead, and the match was halted in the third round. The bout was originally recorded as a [[technical draw]], but the result was changed to a [[No contest (boxing)|no contest]] in May 1999.

Judah then defeated [[Micky Ward]] by [[unanimous decision]] for the [[United States Boxing Association|USBA]] [[Light Welterweight]] title. He successfully defended the USBA title by stopping [[Darryl Tyson]] in the eleventh round on October 15, 1998.&lt;ref name="Canadastar"/&gt;

====IBF champion====
Judah defeated [[Wilfredo Negron]] in January 1999 with a fourth-round knockout to win the [[Interim championship|Interim]] [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] Light Welterweight title.&lt;ref name="Canadastar"/&gt;
On February 12, 2000, he defeated Jan Piet Bergman to win the vacant IBF Light Welterweight title. Bergman went down twice in the first round, but recovered in the second round, knocking Judah down. Judah knocked out Bergman in the fourth round to win the title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

It was an awkward fight for Judah, as Witter rarely engaged in an extended exchange of punches. Witter frequently switched between fighting right-handed and left-handed, making him an elusive opponent. Judah's consistent body punching slowed Witter down, and in the fifth round, Judah caught Witter with a straight left hand that hurt Witter and sent his mouthpiece skittering across the ring. Judah defeated Witter by unanimous decision.&lt;ref name="Witter"&gt;{{cite news

Two months later, on August 5, 2000, at the Mohegan Sun in Connecticut, Judah defeated former IBF Light Welterweight Champion [[Terron Millett]] by fourth-round knockout. Judah was knocked down in the first round from a left hand. Judah rose quickly, and from that point on he dominated the fight. Judah hurt Millett with two [[striking combination|combinations]] near the end of the first round. In round two, Judah sent Millett down with a right hand to the chin. Millett survived the round, but he was clearly hurt. In round four, Judah charged across the ring and inflicted a series of blows on Millett, knocking him down again. Millett got up, but Judah continued his assault and knocked Millett down again. Millett rose at the count of four, but his legs were unsteady and the referee decided to stop the bout.&lt;ref name="Millett"&gt;{{cite news

In his third title defense, Judah stopped Hector Quiroz in the eighth round on October 20, 2000, at [[The Palace of Auburn Hills]] in [[Auburn Hills, Michigan]].&lt;ref name="Canadastar"/&gt;
On January 13, 2001, Judah defeated Reggie Green by tenth-round technical knockout at the Mohegan Sun in Connecticut. Judah had trouble landing punches effectively against Green for the majority of the fight, but in round ten, he knocked Green down with a left [[Hook (boxing)|hook]]. Green beat the count, but Judah then ran across the ring and sent Green down to the canvas with a right hand, forcing the referee to stop the fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

On June 23, 2001, Judah defeated Allan Vester by third-round knockout in his fifth successful defense of the IBF title. In round two, Judah put Vester down to the canvas twice. In the third round, Judah knocked out Vester with a left hand that connected on Vester's temple. Vester went down on his knees and nearly lost his mouthpiece. The referee stopped the fight right before the closing bell. The fight would set up a unification match between Judah and [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] and [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] Light Welterweight Champion [[Kostya Tszyu]], who defeated [[Oktay Urkal]] on the undercard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

====Judah vs. Tszyu====
The much anticipated matchup between Judah and Tsyzu took place on November 3, 2001, at the [[MGM Grand Las Vegas|MGM Grand]] in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]] for the [[List of undisputed boxing champions#Junior Welterweight|Undisputed Light Welterweight Championship]]. Judah entered the fight as a 3-to-1 favorite to win.&lt;ref name="CBZ"&gt;{{cite web

With 10&amp;nbsp;seconds left to go in round two, Tszyu landed a right hand clean on Judah's chin and he backed away from Tszyu with his hands down. Tszyu went after Judah, throwing another right hand that landed on his chin and sent Judah crashing to the canvas. Judah jumped up instinctively and tried to signal that he was fine to referee [[Jay Nady]], but was still dazed by the punch and fell down a second time. When Judah collapsed, Nady waved the fight over, resulting in a technical knockout victory for Tsyzu and Judah's first professional loss.&lt;ref name="CBZ"/&gt;

While Tszyu celebrated in his corner, Judah was in disbelief of what just happened and became infuriated.&lt;ref name="ESB"/&gt; Judah picked up his stool and hurled it towards center ring. While being restrained by his father and trainer, [[Yoel Judah]], he broke loose and walked up to Nady and stuck his gloved fist into his neck and had to be pulled off by cornermen. A few minutes later, Jimmy Lennon, Jr. announced the official decision and Judah screamed out and again had to be restrained by a growing number of security guards and cornermen.&lt;ref name="CBZ"/&gt; Judah was fined [[United States dollar|$]]75,000 and suspended for six months by the [[Nevada State Athletic Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

After defeating Omar Weis by unanimous decision in July 2002, Judah challenged [[DeMarcus Corley]] for the [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]] Light Welterweight title on July 12, 2003, at the [[Orleans Hotel and Casino]] in Las Vegas. Judah knocked Corley down with a left hand in the third round en route to defeating Corley by [[split decision]]. Judah broke his left hand during the fight. In his only defense of the WBO title, Judah knocked out Jaime Rangel in the first round on December 13, 2003.&lt;ref name="Canadastar"/&gt;

====Judah vs. Spinks====
On April 10, 2004, at the [[Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino]] in Las Vegas, Judah fought [[Cory Spinks]] for the [[List of undisputed boxing champions#Welterweight|Undisputed Welterweight Championship]]. Judah had trouble at the start figuring out how to fight Spinks, the taller fighter. He could not move forward to get inside, but was having success moving laterally. Spinks scored a knockdown in the eleventh round, but Judah came back and put Spinks down to the canvas in the final round. In the end, Spinks defeated Judah by unanimous decision with scores of 114–112 twice and 116–111.&lt;ref name="Spinks"&gt;{{cite news

For the rest of 2004, Judah defeated [[Rafael Pineda (boxer)|Rafael Pineda]] by split decision and Wayne Martell by first-round technical knockout.

====Judah vs. Spinks II====
On February 5, 2005, Judah would get a rematch with Spinks at the [[Savvis Center]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], Spinks' hometown. The fight was the first major bout in St. Louis in more than 40&amp;nbsp;years, and it was a sellout. Judah was the aggressor throughout the fight. He knocked Spinks down to his knees at the bell in the seventh round, but it was not ruled a knockdown. Spinks had a strong start to the ninth round and connected with a left hand, then followed with a right hand and a combination, but Judah scored a knockdown moments later. Judah pressed the attack after the first knockdown and avoided Spinks' desperate efforts to [[Clinch hold|tie him up]]. After Spinks was knocked down for the second time, the referee stopped the fight, and Judah became the new [[Undisputed Champion|Undisputed]] [[Welterweight]] Champion.&lt;ref name="Spinks 2"&gt;{{cite news

====Undisputed welterweight champion====
In his first fight as undisputed welterweight champion, he fought [[Cosme Rivera]] on May 14, 2005, at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. Judah sent Rivera down with a straight left hand to the face less than 30&amp;nbsp;seconds into the bout. Rivera beat the count, but was knocked down again about 10&amp;nbsp;seconds later. Judah hit Rivera hard several times in the second round, and in the third round, he connected with a left uppercut, that caused Rivera to stagger backwards and fall into the ropes before hitting the canvas.

His next fight took place on January 7, 2006 at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City against [[Carlos Baldomir]]. For Judah, the fight was viewed as a tuneup bout that would lead to a lucrative bout between Judah and [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] Light Welterweight Champion [[Floyd Mayweather, Jr.]], which was tentatively scheduled for April.&lt;ref name="tuneup"&gt;{{cite news

''[[Ring Magazine|The Ring]]'' named Baldomir's victory over Judah the [[Ring Magazine upsets of the year|upset of the year]] for 2006.

With the loss to Baldomir, it appeared that Judah's much anticipated bout with Mayweather was off, but Judah's promoter [[Don King (boxing promoter)|Don King]] and Mayweather's promoter [[Bob Arum]] reworked the deals so the fight would go on.

In round four, Judah landed a right hand to the head that caused Mayweather to retreat to the ropes and cover up. The momentum changed in the fifth round, when Mayweather hurt Judah with a combination to the face. Then Mayweather landed a right hand on the bridge of Judah's nose, and blood began to flow. The seventh round was the most dominant for Mayweather to that point. Once again, he drew blood from Judah's nose.

With about 10&amp;nbsp;seconds left in the tenth round, Judah hit Mayweather with a [[Groin attack|low blow]] and followed it with a right hand to the back of Mayweather's head. As Mayweather hopped around the ring in pain, Steele called time to give Mayweather a rest period.

After the fight, the purses for both fighters were withheld until video of the fight could be reviewed.

At a hearing on May 8, the Commission disciplined the other offenders in the melee. It fined Yoel Judah $100,000 and revoked his license for one year, fined Mayweather cornerman Leonard Ellerbe $50,000 and suspended his license for four months, and fined Zab Judah $350,000 and revoked his license for one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On April 13, 2007, Judah made his return to the ring against [[Rubén Galván (boxer)|Ruben Galvan]] at the [[Fitzgeralds Casino &amp; Hotel Tunica|Fitzgeralds Casino &amp; Hotel]] in [[Tunica, Mississippi]]. Judah came out strongly in the first round, landing numerous shots on Galvan. During the round, a bad cut opened near the top of Galvan's head. The referee called for a timeout to allow the doctor to take a look at the cut. Due to the severity of the cut, the fight was waved off. The cut was ruled to be caused by an accidental foul with an elbow and since the fight did not go past four rounds, the fight was ruled a no contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Cotto and Judah delivered an all-action brawl, but after weathering some difficult early rounds as he figured out Judah's southpaw style and adjusted to his speed, Cotto took over the bout. In round seven, both fighters went toe-to-toe and in round eight he hurt Judah several times. In round nine, Judah took a knee to gain a breather from Cotto's aggressive style. By the tenth round, Judah was bleeding from a cut over his right eye and was hurt by an uppercut from Cotto that sent him retreating to the ropes, but Judah stayed upright. Early in the eleventh round, Cotto landed a combination that dropped Judah to the canvas. He managed to get to his feet, but Cotto went after Judah with a relentless attack, turning him sideways along the ropes as he continued to throw punches. That forced the referee to stop the fight.&lt;ref name="ESPN Cotto"/&gt;

Judah, who trailed 97–91 on all three scorecards, claimed he had been weakened by the two low blows early in the fight. He said, "The first low blow was very hard. The second one took a lot out of me. The low blows affected me from the time they hit me." Cotto earned $2.5 million plus a piece of the pay-per-view profits, while Judah earned $1 million plus a percentage of the profits.&lt;ref name="ESPN Cotto"/&gt;

Judah fought Edwin Vazquez at the [[Hard Rock Hotel and Casino (Biloxi)|Hard Rock]] resort in [[Biloxi, Mississippi]] on September 7, 2007. Despite suffering a cut over his left eye, Judah defeated the overmatched Vazquez by unanimous decision.

During the third, Judah scored a knockdown on Davis, although he recovered, he went on to lose by a wide margin (119-109 119-109 118-110).

Judah was scheduled to fight [[Shane Mosley]] on May 31, 2008, at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino in Las Vegas, but it was postponed after Judah needed 50&amp;nbsp;[[Surgical suture|stitches]] in his right arm after slipping in his bathroom and smashing it through a glass shower door.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Return to light welterweight===
====Judah vs. Matthysse====
On November 6, 2010, Judah won a [[split decision]] over previously undefeated [[Lucas Matthysse]] in a fight for the vacant regional [[North American Boxing Organization|NABO]] Light Welterweight title at the Prudential Center in [[Newark, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last =Richardson |first =Matt |title =Judah edges Matthysse |work = |publisher =Fightnews.com |date =November 6, 2010 |url=http://www.fightnews.com/Boxing/early-results-from-newark-nj-4-65912 |accessdate =November 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former world champion fought in the light welterweight division for the first time in almost seven years.

The Brooklyn native began the busier fighter, using the jab and trying to land uppercuts for the first two rounds, while Matthysse worked on the body. In round three, a clash of heads opened a cut outside of the left eye of Judah. Matthysse displayed more aggression and became the aggressor in the third and the fourth round and Judah switched to a defensive tactic. In the next two rounds, the American boxer picked up the pace, beginning to land more combinations. The seventh round was less active but in the eight, Judah landed some hard right counter shots. Judah continued to box throughout the ninth round but Matthysse began to show more power in the tenth, focusing on the head of his opponent and knocking down the American boxer after a hard right hand to the jaw. Judah got up but he was hurt, and the Argentine fighter tried to press the attack after the knockdown. However, Judah held and worked on the defensive and managed to finish the bout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last =Vester |first =Mark |title =Judah Rocked Bad, But Edges Matthysse To Win |work = |publisher =BoxingScene.com |date =November 7, 2010 |url =http://www.boxingscene.com/?m=show&amp;id=32589 |accessdate =November 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two judges scored the fight 114–113 for Judah, while the other judge scored it 114–113 for Matthysse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last =Coppinger |first =Mike |title =Zab Judah earns tough split decision over Lucas Matthysse |work = |publisher =USA Today.com |date =November 7, 2010 |url =https://www.usatoday.com/sports/boxing/2010-11-07-zab-judah-split-decision_N.htm |accessdate =November 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Second IBF title reign====
Following the win against Matthysse, negotiations for a fight against [[Kaizer Mabuza]] began. Both sides eventually agreed to a March 5 bout, with the vacant IBF Light Welterweight title on the line. Former champion [[Pernell Whitaker]] joined Judah's training camp to help him prepare for the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = |first = |title =Judah-Mabuza: Pernell Whitaker Helping Zab In Camp |work = |publisher =''BoxingScene'' |date =January 27, 2011 |url =http://www.boxingscene.com/judah-mabuza-pernell-whitaker-helping-zab-camp--35254 |accessdate =March 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whitaker said: "I don't train guys to be like me.

====Judah vs. Khan====
Judah fought [[World Boxing Association|WBA (Super)]] champion [[Amir Khan (British boxer)|Amir Khan]] in a unification bout on July 23, 2011 at [[Mandalay Bay|Mandalay Bay Resort &amp; Casino]], Las Vegas. Judah was knocked out by Khan in the 5th round after Khan landed an uppercut body shot. Judah was unable to answer the referee's 10 count, thus recording his 7th career loss. Khan was ahead 40-36 on all three judges score cards at the time of the knock out. Judah was adamant that the body shot should have been called low and claimed that he had been expecting a mandatory five-minute recovery period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.badlefthook.com/2011/7/23/2290598/amir-khan-vs-zab-judah-results-knockout-low-blow|title=Amir Khan Stops Zab Judah in Five Rounds|last=Christ|first=Scott|date=2011-07-23|website=Bad Left Hook|access-date=2017-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/boxing/14259712|title=Britain's Amir Khan knocks out Zab Judah in Las Vegas|date=2011-07-24|newspaper=BBC Sport|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Judah vs. García====
Judah's next bout was scheduled for February 9 against undefeated [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] &amp; [[World Boxing Association|WBA (Super)]] Champion [[Danny García]] at the [[Barclays Center]] in [[Brooklyn]], but was subsequently rescheduled to April 27, 2013 due to a rib injury sustained by Garcia during training.

After a heated week of pre-fight confrontations, fans were expecting something special from Danny Garcia vs. Zab Judah. And the fighters delivered, though in an unanticipated fashion. From early on it was clear that the bad blood would not adversely impact the fight, as both men fought strong technical fights.

During the early rounds, Garcia steadily pulled ahead, outboxing Judah throughout. Judah was in serious trouble in rounds 5 and 6, then finally went down in the 8th. From there, things took a surprising turn. Never known for his resolve or ability to turn the fight around late, Judah responded to the knockdown by coming on strong down the stretch. Judah took the last 3 rounds, though his deficit from earlier in the fight meant it wasn't enough and Garcia defeated Judah by unanimous decision (115-112, 114-112, 116-111).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/9219336/danny-garcia-grinds-bloody-win-zab-judah|title=Garcia grinds out win over Judah|newspaper=ESPN.com|access-date=2017-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.badlefthook.com/2013/4/27/4277312/garcia-vs-judah-results-danny-garcia-wins-decision-scores-brooklyn-showtime-boxing-news|title=Results: Garcia overcomes valiant Judah|last=Christ|first=Scott|date=2013-04-27|website=Bad Left Hook|access-date=2017-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second return to welterweight===
====Judah vs. Malignaggi====
Judah fought former welterweight titlist [[Paulie Malignaggi]] December 7, 2013 at the Barclays Center for the vacant [[North American Boxing Federation|NABF]] welterweight title. Judah started well, winning the first three rounds with a sharp jab, also dropping Malignaggi in the second round. The rest of the fight saw Malignaggi hitting quick jabs outpointing Judah. The fight went the 12 round distance as the judges scored it 116-111, 117-110 and 117-110 all in Malignaggi's favor. Due to the lack of action in the fight, the crowd booed as the fight ended. The fight was for the "King of Brooklyn" belt and local bragging rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/boxing/story/_/id/10101224/paulie-malignaggi-beats-zab-judah-unanimous-decision-welterweight-bout|title=Malignaggi wins unanimous decision vs. Judah|newspaper=ESPN.com|access-date=2017-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.badlefthook.com/2013/12/8/5187446/judah-vs-malignaggi-paulie-malignaggi-blows-out-zab-judah-in-battle|title=Malignaggi blows out Judah in Battle of Brooklyn|last=Christ|first=Scott|date=2013-12-08|website=Bad Left Hook|access-date=2017-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return from hiatus===
In early January 2017, Judah announced that he would have his first fight in over 3 years on January 21 when he fights journeyman Jorge Luis Munguia (12-7, 4 KOs) in a scheduled 10 round bout at [[Sun National Bank Center]] in [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]], New Jersey.

Judah's entrance included a light show, as well as showcasing some of the world titles he had won during his career. The fight went the 10 round distance with Judah winning 99-91 on all three judges scorecards. Apart from being hurt once towards the end of round 6 following some body shots, Judah started the first round at a steady pace but controlled the remainder of the fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/zab-judah-returns-rincon-canada-results--124715|title=Zab Judah Returns, Decisions Noel Rincon in Canada|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2018-01-31|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ringtv.com/527381-zab-judah-back-action-outpoints-noel-mejia-rincon-10/|title=Zab Judah back in action, outpoints Noel Mejia Rincon over 10 - The Ring|date=2018-01-28|work=The Ring|access-date=2018-01-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[New York City Police Department|New York Police]] linked [[rapper]] [[Fabolous]] to a crew of robbers who targeted Judah twice. According to police reports, the Street Fam Crew, the gang that attempted to rob Judah, is made up of 20&amp;nbsp;members, all former drug dealers from Fabolous' [[Brooklyn]] neighborhood. In 2006, three men tried to rob Judah as he stood next to his [[Lamborghini]] on West 27th Street at [[Tenth Avenue (Manhattan)|10th Avenue]] in New York City. The three men drove up to Judah in a minivan at about 5&amp;nbsp;am, and came out. One man pulled a handgun on Judah, and told him to put his jewelry on the hood of his car, but Judah ran instead. The muggers followed in their minivan, but crashed into a tree a block away. All three robbers fled the scene, but one was captured by a [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Homeland Security agent]] on his way to work, and another was grabbed by a nearby cab driver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
