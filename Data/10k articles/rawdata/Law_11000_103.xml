The December 15, '''1836 U.S. Patent Office fire''' was the first of several disastrous fires the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent Office]] has had in its history.&lt;ref&gt;Niemann, p. 130 ''History sometimes repeats itself, I said, history sometimes repeats itself. In 1877, a second fire occurred at the Patent Office.''&lt;/ref&gt; An initial investigation considered the possibility of [[arson]] due to suspected corruption in the [[United States Postal Service|Post Office]], which shared the same building, but it was later ruled out. The cause was ultimately determined to be accidental. This event is considered to be a turning point in the history of the Patent Office.&lt;ref name="kids"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/ahrpa/opa/kids/special/1836fire.htm |title=''One Hot Commodity'': Great Patent Fire of 1836 United States Patent Office |work=Kids pages |publisher=United States Patent and Trademark Office |accessdate=16 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Byars"&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/com/speeches/01-60.htm |title=December 15th Marks the 165th Anniversary of The Great Patent Office Fire of 1836: Flames Destroyed a Significant Period of U.S. Patent History |last1=Byars |first1=Kim |date=14 December 2001 |number=#01-60 |publisher=United States Patent and Trademark Office |accessdate=16 December 2011}} December 15, 2011 was the [[Sesquicentennial|Dodransbicentennial]]—175 years from this calamitous event.&lt;/ref&gt;

Local fire suppression efforts were incapable of preventing the damage due to lack of fire personnel and old equipment. Many patent documents and models from the preceding three decades were irretrievably lost. As a result of the fire, Congress and the newly legally revamped Patent Office changed the way it handled its recordkeeping, assigning numbers to patents and requiring multiple copies of supporting documentation.

==History==

The fire broke out at 3 a.m. on December 15. At that time the Patent Office was located in Blodget's Hotel, as was the fire department and the post office.&lt;ref group=upper-alpha&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tx9Zkz0XqA4C&amp;pg=PA129&amp;dq=%22the+fire+hose+was+sixteen+years+old%22&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20fire%20hose%20was%20sixteen%20years%20old%22&amp;f=false |page=129 |place=Quincy, Il |publisher=Horsefeathers Publishing Company |year=2006 |title=More Invention Mysteries: 52 Little-known Stories Behind Well-known Inventions |first1=Paul J. |last1=Niemann |accessdate=19 April 2013}} '' The Patent Office was housed in the same Washington, DC building as the fire department ...'' ''... but the fire hose was sixteen years old and in such bad shape that it was useless, but no one found out until they had to use it the night of the fire ...''&lt;/ref&gt; Patent Office employees stored firewood in the basement of the hotel, near where postal employees disposed of the hot ashes from their fires. Sometime after midnight that morning the hot ashes ignited the firewood. The fire department's hose was old and defective and would not funnel the water onto the fire. All 10,000 patents and several thousand related [[patent model]]s were destroyed.&lt;ref name="Niemann129"&gt;Niemann, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1810, Congress had authorized the purchase of the unfinished Blodgett's Hotel from its builder to house the Post and Patent offices.&lt;ref name="Harmon"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/service/pnp/ppmsca/17500/17590v.jpg |first1=Artemas Canfield (1873- )|last1=Harmon |title=Description of Blodget's Hotel (which housed the Patent Office) |date=c. 1920|publisher=[[Library of Congress]] |accessdate=17 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Congress was aware of the fire risk. During the [[War of 1812]], Superintendent [[Dr. William Thornton]] convinced members of the British expeditionary force to leave it standing while they [[Burning of Washington|burned the rest of the city]].&lt;ref name="patent"/&gt;&lt;ref group=upper-alpha&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.myoutbox.net/pobere.htm |title=Brief History of the United States Patent Office from its foundation—1790 to 1886—with an outline of laws, growth, publications, office routine, etc. |place=Washington, D.C. |publisher=R. Beresford, Printer |year=1886 |accessdate=16 December 2011}} It is written that a loaded cannon was aimed at the Patent Office to destroy it. Thornton "put himself before the gun, and in a frenzy of excitement exclaimed: 'Are you [[Englishmen]] or only [[Goths]] and [[Vandals]]? This is the Patent Office, a depository of the ingenuity of the American nation, in which the whole civilized world is interested. Would you destroy it? If so, fire away, and let the charge pass through my body.' The effect is said to have been magical upon the soldiers, and to have saved the Patent Office from destruction."&lt;/ref&gt; "When the smoke cleared from the dreadful attack, the Patent Office was the only Government building . . . left untouched" from the [[Burning of Washington]].&lt;ref name=kids/&gt;

Consequently, a well-equipped fire station was located nearby. In 1820, "Congress authorized the covering of the building with a [[Slate#Uses|slate roof]] and the purchase of a [[Fire apparatus|fire engine]] for its protection against fires."&lt;ref name="Harmon"/&gt; Unfortunately, the [[volunteer fire department]] lost its sense of purpose and was disbanded.&lt;ref name="patent"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://patent.laws.com/patent-act-of-1836/patent-act-of-1836-patent-fire-of-1836 |title=The Patent Fire of 1836 |publisher=patentlaws.com |accessdate=14 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dobyns"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wkfinetools.com/hUS/z_Patents/z_pOffice/fire1836.asp |title=Patent Office Fire of 1836 A History of the Early Patent Office |first1=Kenneth W |last1=Dobyns |work=The History of Woodworking Tools in US |accessdate=14 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, a complete firehouse equipped with a fire engine was just down the street. Although equipped with a forcing pump and with riveted leather hose 1,000 feet (300 m) long (all purchased 16 years earlier by [[Act of Congress]]), there were no firefighters.&lt;ref name="patent"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dobyns"/&gt; Running a [[bucket brigade]] to put out the building blaze was totally ineffective.&lt;ref name="patent"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dobyns"/&gt;

The lost items included 168 folio volumes of records, 26 large portfolios of some nine thousand drawings, related descriptive patent documents, and miscellaneous paperwork. The 7,000 lost models included those of various textile manufacturing processes and several models of steam-powered machinery for propelling boats (including [[Robert Fulton]]'s original bound folio of full-color patent drawings, done in his own hand).&lt;ref name="Dobyns"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Campbell"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.myoutbox.net/pocamp.htm |place=Washington D.C. |title=The Patent System of the United States so far as it relates to the Granting of Patents: A History |first1=Levin H. |last1=Campbell |publisher=Press of McGill and Wallace |year=1891 |accessdate=14 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Patent Office's own model-cases, press and seals, desks, book-cases and office furniture were also destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Senate Report by Mr. [[John Ruggles|Ruggles]] of January 9, 1837, with Senate Bill No. 107&lt;/ref&gt; The entirety of the library was lost, excepting only "one book, volume VI of the Repertory of Arts and Manufactures (now in the Scientific Library of the Office), which an employee of the office happened to have taken to his home,"&lt;ref name="Campbell"/&gt; against the office's rules.&lt;ref name="kids"/&gt; [[John Ruggles]], chairman of the Senate investigating committee, wrote that the lost materials "not only embraced the whole history of American invention for half a century, but were the monuments of property of vast amount, (including) 'the largest and most interesting collection of models in the world.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.myoutbox.net/poarnold.htm |title=The Patent Office and its Mission |first1=Aza |last1=Arnold |publisher=Extract from The National Recorder of Religious and Literary Intelligence |volume= I |number=2 |pages=29–30 |place=Washington, D.C. |date=February 1859}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

Congress investigated the fire immediately, suspecting [[arson]]. At the time of the fire the Post Office Department was under investigation for awarding dishonest mail contracts. It was first thought that perhaps the fire was set to [[obstruction of justice|destroy evidence]]. However, it turned out that the Post Office Department had saved all their documents. Investigators concluded that someone had stored hot ashes in a box in the basement. The live embers then ignited the firewood; no one was ever identified as having caused the fire.&lt;ref name="kids"/&gt;&lt;ref name="arson"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.myoutbox.net/popch17.htm|title= History of the United States Patent Office, The Patent Office Pony, A History of the Early Patent Office, Chapter 17... and also the Worst of Years|first1= |last1= |work= |accessdate=15 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Patent Office was moved to the old City Hall, at the time the District Courthouse.&lt;ref name="kids"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015000692775;view=image;seq=17;q1=1836%20%22Patent%20Office%22%20fire;start=1;size=10;page=search;num=7 |title=The story of the United States Patent Office, 1790-1956 |place=Washington, D.C. |publisher=U.S. Govt.

All patents from prior to the fire are listed today as [[X-Patents]] by the office. There are estimated to be 9,957, of which only 2,845 have been restored.&lt;ref name="princeton"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libguides.princeton.edu/content.php?pid=168624&amp;sid=1474173 |title=1836 Patent Office Fire |date=28 October 2011|publisher=[[Princeton University Library]] |accessdate=14 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Congress solicited for the restoration of the lost patents and appropriated monies for this purpose.&lt;ref name="Ames"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myoutbox.net/poames.htm|title=Extract from Ten Years in Washington |first1=Mary Clemmer |last1=Ames|date= |publisher=Kenneth W.

|accessdate=15 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is difficult for modern researchers to find those patents.&lt;ref name="princeton"/&gt;

The fire occurred around the time of the [[Patent Act of 1836]], which had required that patent applications be examined before being granted.&lt;ref name="patent"/&gt; An amendment to it the following year required submission of two copies of drawings—one for safekeeping in the patent office; the other attached to the patent grant transmitted to the applicant. The requirement ended in 1870 when the Office began printing complete copies of patents as issued.&lt;ref name="Bellis"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://inventors.about.com/library/weekly/aa073100a.htm |title=The 212th Anniversary of the First American Patent Act |first1=Mary |last1=Bellis |accessdate=14 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the fire, the way patents were identified was changed.&lt;ref name="archives"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov/research/guide-fed-records/groups/241.html |title=Records of the Patent and Trademark Office Search OPA for Entries from this Record Group (Record Group 241) 1836-1973 23,879 cu. ft. |publisher=[[National Archives]] |accessdate=14 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the National Archives notes: "Patent records predating 1836 were unnumbered and could be accessed only by name of patentee and date of patent. After 1836, unique numbers assigned by the Patent Office distinguished each new patent."

On July 4, 1836, the Patent Office became a separate organization within the Department of State under the Patent Act of 1836 (5 Stat. 117). [[Henry Leavitt Ellsworth]] became its first Commissioner. He immediately began construction of a new "[[Fireproofing|fire-proof]]" building,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/patent.html?c=y&amp;page=3 |title=Back To The Future: One of Washington's most exuberant monuments—the old Patent Office Building—gets the renovation it deserves |first1=Adam |last1=Goodheart |publisher=[[Smithsonian magazine]] |date = July 2006|page=3 |accessdate=17 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was not completed until 1864.&lt;ref name="kids"/&gt;&lt;ref name="keim"&gt;{{cite book |url=

The March 3, 1837, Act made provisions to restore the models and drawings lost in the 1836 fire. An amount of $100,000 was appropriated as a budget. There were some 10,000 patent records lost and some 7,000 invention models. One method of restoration was by getting back a duplicate from the original inventor. By 1849 the restoration process was discontinued and it was determined that $88,237.32 had been spent from the budget allowed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=sDIVAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA141&amp;dq=Patent+office+1877+fire&amp;hl=en#v=snippet&amp;q=Patent%20office%20fire&amp;f=false ''v Report of the investigation of the United States Patent office made by the President's commission on economy and efficiency,'' December, 1912, United States Printing Office, p. 130]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''1993 Cherbourg incident''' were a series of maritime incidents which took place from 26 March to 2 April 1993 between the British [[Royal Navy]] and French fishermen as a result of a [[Exclusive economic zone|fishing rights]] dispute in and around the [[Channel Islands]] waters.

== Background ==

The tensions around the Channel Islands waters rose high since September 1992, when the [[European Union]] (EU) recognised a six-mile British limit for [[Exclusive Economic Zone|exclusive fishing rights]] around the islands. Until then, British and French trawlers operated in the zone without restrictions.&lt;ref name=burn/&gt; The agreement left a three-mile limit from the coastline where only [[Jersey]] trawlers could fish, between the three-mile and the six-mile for any British-flagged boat and an outer area between the six-mile and the 12-mile limit where only British and French fishing boats could operate.&lt;ref name=surv/&gt;

== The incidents ==

The first incident took place on 26 March, when two fishing inspectors from the Channel Islands were illegally taken on the trawler ''Impatiens'' to the French port of [[Barneville-Carteret]], after the French fishing boat was challenged by the British fishery vessel [[HMS Orkney (P299)|HMS ''Orkney'']] from [[Guernsey]],&lt;ref name=day/&gt; which confiscated her pots.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The inspectors were rescued some hours later by a French coastguard vessel.&lt;ref name=surv&gt;British Information Services: Survey of current affairs: Volumen 23, 1993, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=day&gt;Daily report. West Europe, 1–15. United States. [[Foreign Broadcast Information Service]], p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 March 1993, [[HMS Blazer (P279)|HMS ''Blazer'']] was paying a visit to [[Cherbourg]] when the local fishermen learned that a boat from their fleet, the ''La Calypso'', had been stopped at sea by a British minesweeper, [[HMS Brocklesby (M33)|HMS ''Brocklesby'']]. The captain of the ''La Calypso'' refused to submit and set out for Cherbourg with three British fishery protection servicemen on board. A French port vessel later returned the personnel to Royal Navy control. Eight French trawlers subsequently surrounded the ''Blazer''&lt;ref name=burn/&gt; at 3:00 pm and angry fishermen boarded the ship. According to witnesses,&lt;ref name=day/&gt; HMS ''Blazer'' was seized while manoeuvring outside the port and sailed to Cherbourg harbour by the intruders. Her crew of 16 were forced to remain below the deck for three hours, while the ship's [[White Ensign]]  was burned.  French authorities subsequently put an end to the situation and forcibly expelled the fishermen from ''Blazer'' and placed them under arrest. The [[French Navy]], meanwhile, dispatched the patrol boat ''Coriander'' to Cherbourg.&lt;ref name=burn&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/french-fishermen-burn-patrol-boats-ensign-minister-warns-navy-will-get-tough-after-two-new-humiliations-in-fishing-rights-dispute-1500601.html "French fishermen burn patrol boat's ensign: Minister warns Navy will get tough after two new humiliations in fishing rights dispute"]. ''The Independent'', 29 March 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 March a flotilla of 36 French trawlers steamed up to [[Saint Peter Port]] in Guernsey, where a preliminary deal was agreed.&lt;ref name=surv/&gt; After the first incidents, the Royal Navy deployed unarmed [[Royal Marines]] to conduct any future similar law enforcement operations. The marines were from 40 Commando, based at [[Taunton]] in Somerset. The ''La Calypso'' was eventually caught by the fishery vessel [[HMS Jersey (P295)|HMS ''Jersey'']] and her master was put under arrest in Guernsey on 2 April 1993.&lt;ref name=skip&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/french-skipper-under-arrest-in-guernsey-1453007.html "French skipper under arrest in Guernsey "]. ''The Independent'', 3 April 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; The skipper, Michel Mesnage, was released on bail on 3 April.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/guernsey-bails-fish-feud-skipper-1453328.html "Guernsey bails fish feud skipper"]. ''The Independent'', 4 April 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; A new incident took place on 30 June 1993, when the Guernsey-based trawler ''Sara P'' was seized by the French Navy, and had her pots confiscated.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== British and French reactions ==

A spokeswoman for the French fishermen accused the Royal Navy of "severe provocation", while the British [[Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (United Kingdom)|minister of Agriculture]], [[John Gummer]], stated that "The rule of law must be upheld. I have always emphasised the need for fisheries regulations to be properly enforced throughout the EC. The regulations are there to conserve fish and the long-term interests of the fishermen themselves."&lt;ref name=skip/&gt; The British Fisheries junior Minister, [[David Curry]], claimed that the conflict was caused by the French authorities' failure to properly inform their fishermen about the agreement sanctioned by the EU in 1992, and the [[French legislative election, 1993|French legislative election]], which in practice left no French government to deal with at the time of the incidents.&lt;ref name=surv/&gt; The British Agriculture Minister had met his elected French counterpart on 1 April, and they had agreed that the 1992 EU decision should be enforced.&lt;ref name=skip/&gt; The French government condemned the fishermen's actions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1993-03-30/news/1993089075_1_british-channel-islands-french-fishermen-british-and-french Seizing of British officers by French fishing boat sends chill across channel] by Richard O'Mara. [[The Baltimore Sun]], 30 March 1993&lt;/ref&gt; British and Cherbourg fishermen signed an informal agreement on 5 April, on the first day since the beginning of the crisis, that boats from England and the islands were allowed to unload their catch in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/fishermen-make-pact-friendly-overtures-as-british-catch-is-unloaded-in-france-1453579.html|title=Fishermen make 'pact': Friendly overtures as British catch is unloaded|date=1993-04-06|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-02-25|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A definitive agreement regarding fishing around the Channel Islands and the [[Contentin]] peninsula and [[Brittany]] was reached after an exchange of notes in Paris, on 16 August 1994.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://treaties.fco.gov.uk/docs/pdf/1995/TS0037.pdf|title = Exchange of notes constituting an agreement regarding activities by the local coastal fishermen in the vicinity of Guernsey and the French coasts of the Cotentin Peninsula and of Brittany.

[[File:433eros.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[433 Eros]] is a [[S-type asteroid|stony asteroid]] in a near-Earth orbit]]

'''Asteroid mining''' is the exploitation of raw materials from [[asteroid]]s and other [[minor planet]]s, including [[near-Earth object]]s.&lt;ref&gt;O'Leary, B.  1977.  Mining the Apollo and Amor Asteroids.  Science:  197, 363-366.&lt;/ref&gt;

Minerals can be [[Mining|mined]] from an asteroid or spent [[comet]], then used in space for construction materials or taken back to [[Earth]]. These include [[gold]], [[iridium]], [[silver]], [[osmium]], [[palladium]], [[platinum]], [[rhenium]], [[rhodium]], [[ruthenium]] and [[tungsten]] for transport back to Earth; [[iron]], [[cobalt]], [[manganese]], [[molybdenum]], [[nickel]], [[aluminium]], and [[titanium]] for construction.

Due to the high cost of spaceflight, inaccurate identification of asteroids suitable for mining, and ore extraction challenges, [[Mining|terrestrial mining]] remains the only means of raw mineral acquisition today. If space program funding, either public or private, dramatically increases, this situation is likely to change in the future as [[Peak minerals#Future production|resources on Earth are becoming increasingly scarce]] and the full potentials of asteroid mining—and [[space exploration]] in general—are researched in greater detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://isulibrary.isunet.edu/opac/doc_num.php?explnum_id=73 |title=ASteroid mining, Technologies Roadmap, and Applications |author=Alotaibi, Ghanim |date=2010 |publisher=International Space University |location=Strasbourg |display-authors=etal |access-date=9 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|47f}} However, it is yet uncertain whether asteroid mining will develop to attain the volume and composition needed in due time to fully compensate for dwindling terrestrial reserves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Esty |first=Thomas |date=2013 |title=Asteroid Mining and Prospecting |journal=H.C.O.

Today, these metals are mined from Earth's crust, and they are essential for economic and technological progress. Hence, the geologic history of Earth may very well set the stage for a future of asteroid mining.

In 2006, the [[Keck Observatory]] announced that the binary [[Jupiter trojan]] [[617 Patroclus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Marchis | first1 = F. | display-authors = etal   | title = A low density of 0.8 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; for the Trojan binary asteroid 617 Patroclus | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v439/n7076/abs/nature04350.html| journal = Nature | volume = 439 | issue = 7076| pages = 565–567 | doi=10.1038/nature04350|arxiv = astro-ph/0602033 |bibcode = 2006Natur.439..565M | pmid=16452974 | year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and possibly large numbers of other Jupiter trojans, are likely [[extinct comet]]s and consist largely of water ice. Similarly, Jupiter-family comets, and possibly [[near-Earth asteroid]]s that are extinct comets, might also provide water. The process of [[in-situ resource utilization]]—using materials native to space for propellant, thermal management, tankage, radiation shielding, and other high-mass components of space infrastructure—could lead to radical reductions in its cost.&lt;ref name="April 2012"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-17827347|title=Plans for asteroid mining emerge|date=24 April 2012|work=BBC News|accessdate=2012-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although whether these cost reductions could be achieved, and if achieved would offset the enormous infrastructure investment required, is unknown.

Ice would satisfy one of two necessary conditions to enable "human expansion into the Solar System" (the ultimate goal for human space flight proposed by the 2009 "Augustine Commission" [[Review of United States Human Space Flight Plans Committee]]): physical sustainability and economic sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;C. Gardner, [http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1827/1 "Tobacco and beaver pelts: the sustainable path"], ''The Space Review'', 18 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the [[astrobiology|astrobiological]] perspective, asteroid prospecting could provide scientific data for the search for extraterrestrial intelligence ([[SETI]]). Some astrophysicists have suggested that if advanced extraterrestrial civilizations employed asteroid mining long ago, the hallmarks of these activities might be detectable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://smithsonianscience.org/2011/04/evidence-of-asteroid-mining-in-our-galaxy-may-lead-to-the-discovery-of-extraterrestrial-civilizations/ Evidence of asteroid mining in our galaxy may lead to the discovery of extraterrestrial civilizations] smithsonianscience.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centauri-dreams.org/?p=17357 Asteroid Mining: A Marker for SETI?] centauri-dreams.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |arxiv = 1103.5369|last1 = Marchis|first1 = Franck|title = Extrasolar Asteroid Mining as Forensic Evidence for Extraterrestrial Intelligence|journal = International Journal of Astrobiology|volume = 10|issue = 4|pages = 307–313|last2 = Hestroffer|first2 = Daniel|last3 = Descamps|first3 = Pascal|last4 = Berthier|first4 = Jerome|last5 = Bouchez|first5 = Antonin H|last6 = Campbell|first6 = Randall D|last7 = Chin|first7 = Jason C.

An important factor to consider in target selection is orbital economics, in particular the change in velocity ([[delta-v|Δ&lt;var&gt;v&lt;/var&gt;]]) and travel time to and from the target. More of the extracted native material must be expended as [[propellant]] in higher Δ&lt;var&gt;v&lt;/var&gt; trajectories, thus less returned as payload. [[Hohmann transfer orbit|Direct Hohmann trajectories]] are faster than Hohmann trajectories assisted by planetary and/or lunar flybys, which in turn are faster than those of the [[Interplanetary Transport Network]], but the reduction in transfer time comes at the cost of increased Δ&lt;var&gt;v&lt;/var&gt; requirements.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The Easily Recoverable Object (ERO) subclass of [[Near-Earth asteroid]]s are considered likely candidates for early mining activity. Their low Δ&lt;var&gt;v&lt;/var&gt; makes them suitable for use in extracting construction materials for near-Earth space-based facilities, greatly reducing the economic cost of transporting supplies into Earth orbit.&lt;ref name=te20130416&gt;
{{cite news |last=Harris|first=Stephen |title=Your questions answered: asteroid mining |url=http://www.theengineer.co.uk/aerospace/in-depth/your-questions-answered-asteroid-mining/1015966.article|accessdate=2013-04-16 |newspaper=The Engineer |date=2013-04-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The table above shows a comparison of Δ&lt;var&gt;v&lt;/var&gt; requirements for various missions. In terms of propulsion energy requirements, a mission to a near-Earth asteroid compares favorably to alternative mining missions.

An example of a potential target&lt;ref&gt;Ross, S.D. (2001). [http://www.nss.org/settlement/asteroids/NearEarthAsteroidMining(Ross2001).pdf Near-Earth asteroid mining]&lt;/ref&gt; for an early asteroid mining expedition is [[4660 Nereus]], expected to be mainly [[enstatite]]. This body has a very low Δ&lt;var&gt;v&lt;/var&gt; compared to lifting materials from the surface of the Moon. However it would require a much longer round-trip to return the material.

Multiple types of asteroids have been identified but the three main types would include the C-type, S-type, and M-type asteroids:

# [[C-type asteroid]]s have a high abundance of water which is not currently of use for mining but could be used in an exploration effort beyond the asteroid. Mission costs could be reduced by using the available water from the asteroid. C-type asteroids also have a lot of organic [[carbon]], [[phosphorus]], and other key ingredients for [[fertilizer]] which could be used to grow food.&lt;ref name="astronomysource.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronomysource.com/tag/m-type-asteroids/|title=M-Type Asteroids – Astronomy Source|website=astronomysource.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[S-type asteroid]]s carry little water but look more attractive because they contain numerous metals including: nickel, cobalt and more valuable metals such as gold, platinum and rhodium. A small 10-meter S-type asteroid contains about {{convert|1433000|lb|kg|abbr=on|order=flip}} of metal with {{convert|110|lb|kg|abbr=on|order=flip}} in the form of rare metals like platinum and gold.&lt;ref name="astronomysource.com"/&gt;
# [[M-type asteroid]]s are rare but contain up to 10 times more metal than S-types&lt;ref name="astronomysource.com"/&gt;

A class of ''easily recoverable objects'' (EROs) was identified by a group of researchers in 2013. Twelve asteroids made up the initially identified group, all of which could be potentially mined with present-day rocket technology. Of 9,000 asteroids searched in the [[near-Earth object|NEO]] database, these twelve could all be brought into an Earth-accessible orbit by changing their [[delta-V|velocity]] by less than {{convert|500|m/s|km/h mph|sp=us}}. The dozen asteroids range in size from {{convert|2| to |20|m|ft|-1|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name=ibt20120813&gt;

=== Asteroid cataloging ===
{{Main|B612 Foundation}}

The [[B612 Foundation]] is a private [[Nonprofit organization|nonprofit]] [[Private foundation (United States)|foundation]] with headquarters in the United States, dedicated to protecting Earth from [[Impact event|asteroid strikes]]. As a [[non-governmental organization]] it has conducted two lines of related research to help detect asteroids that could one day strike Earth, and find the technological means to divert their path to avoid such collisions.

The foundation's 2013 goal was to design and build a privately financed asteroid-finding [[Space observatory|space telescope]], [[Sentinel (space telescope)|Sentinel]], hoping in 2013 to launch it in 2017–2018.  The Sentinel's infrared telescope, once parked in an orbit similar to that of [[Venus]], is designed to help identify threatening asteroids by cataloging 90% of those with diameters larger than {{convert|140|m}}, as well as surveying smaller Solar System objects.&lt;ref name="Discover-2013.09"&gt;Powell, Corey S. [http://discovermagazine.com/2013/september/17-hunting-season-for-asteroids "Developing Early Warning Systems for Killer Asteroids"], ''[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]]'', August 14, 2013, pp. 60–61 (subscription required).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="B612-Sentinel Mission" /&gt;&lt;ref name="New York Times-2013.02.16" /&gt;{{update after|2018|2|24}}

Data gathered by Sentinel was intended to be provided through an existing scientific data-sharing network that includes [[NASA]] and academic institutions such as the [[Minor Planet Center]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. Given the satellite's telescopic accuracy, Sentinel's data may prove valuable for other possible future missions, such as asteroid mining.&lt;ref name="B612-Sentinel Mission"&gt;

== Mining considerations ==

There are three options for mining:&lt;ref name=te20130416/&gt;
# Bring raw asteroidal material to Earth for use.
# Process it on-site to bring back only processed materials, and perhaps produce propellant for the return trip.
# Transport the asteroid to a safe orbit around the Moon, Earth or to the ISS.&lt;ref name="Kiss"/&gt; This can hypothetically allow for most materials to be used and not wasted.&lt;ref name="Valentine" /&gt;

Processing ''in situ'' for the purpose of extracting high-value minerals will reduce the energy requirements for transporting the materials, although the processing facilities must first be transported to the mining site. ''In situ'' mining will involve drilling boreholes and injecting hot fluid/gas and allow the useful material to react or melt with the solvent and the extract the solute. Due to the weak gravitational fields of asteroids, any drilling will cause large disturbances and form dust clouds.

Mining operations require special equipment to handle the extraction and processing of ore in outer space.&lt;ref name=te20130416/&gt;
The machinery will need to be anchored to the body,{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}&lt;!-- some, but not all asteroids; other techniques are also likely per the te20130416 source --&gt; but once in place, the ore can be moved about more readily due to the lack of gravity. However, no techniques for refining ore in zero gravity currently exist. Docking with an asteroid might be performed using a harpoon-like process, where a projectile would penetrate the surface to serve as an anchor; then an attached cable would be used to winch the vehicle to the surface, if the asteroid is both penetrable and rigid enough for a harpoon to be effective.&lt;ref name="Mining Near-Earth Asteroids-National Space Society"&gt;{{cite web|last=Durda|first=Daniel|title=Mining Near-Earth Asteroids|url=http://www.nss.org/adastra/volume18/durda.html|website=nss.org|publisher=National Space Society|accessdate=17 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the distance from Earth to an asteroid selected for mining, the round-trip time for communications will be several minutes or more, except during occasional close approaches to Earth by near-Earth asteroids. Thus any mining equipment will either need to be highly automated, or a human presence will be needed nearby.&lt;ref name=te20130416/&gt; Humans would also be useful for troubleshooting problems and for maintaining the equipment. On the other hand, multi-minute communications delays have not prevented the success of robotic [[exploration of Mars]], and automated systems would be much less expensive to build and deploy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Crandall W.B.C. | title=Why Space, Recommendations to the Review of United States Human Space Flight Plans Committee | journal=NASA Document Server| year=2009 | url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/383154main_53%20-%2020090803.7.toAugustineCommittee-2009-08-03.pdf | displayauthors=etal  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology being developed by [[Planetary Resources]] to locate and harvest these asteroids has resulted in the plans for three different types of satellites:
# Arkyd Series 100 (the Leo Space telescope) is a less expensive instrument that will be used to find, analyze, and see what resources are available on nearby asteroids.&lt;ref name="astronomysource.com"/&gt;
# Arkyd Series 200 (the Interceptor) Satellite that would actually land on the asteroid to get a closer analysis of the available resources.&lt;ref name="astronomysource.com"/&gt;
# Arkyd Series 300 (Rendezvous Prospector) Satellite developed for research and finding resources deeper in space.&lt;ref name="astronomysource.com"/&gt;

Technology being developed by [[Deep Space Industries]] to examine, sample, and harvest asteroids is divided into three families of spacecraft:
# FireFlies are triplets of nearly identical spacecraft in [[CubeSat]] form launched to different asteroids to rendezvous and examine them.&lt;ref name="cnbc.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2013/11/21/precious-metal-hunters-look-to-outer-space.html|title=Precious metal hunters look to outer space|last=CNBC|date=21 November 2013|website=cnbc.com|accessdate=24 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# DragonFlies also are launched in waves of three nearly identical spacecraft to gather small samples (5–10&amp;nbsp;kg) and return them to Earth for analysis.&lt;ref name="cnbc.com"/&gt;
# Harvestors voyage out to asteroids to gather hundreds of tons of material for return to high Earth orbit for processing.&lt;ref&gt;http://deepspaceindustries.com/video/press/FBN_01-27-2013_18.39.36.mp4&lt;/ref&gt;

Asteroid mining could potentially revolutionize space exploration.{{Original research inline|date=September 2018}} The C-type asteroids's high abundance of water could be used to produce fuel by splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen. This would make space travel a more feasible option by lowering cost of fuel. While the cost of fuel is a relatively insignificant factor in the overall cost for low earth orbit manned space missions, storing it and the size of the craft become a much bigger factor for interplanetary missions. Typically 1&amp;nbsp;kg in orbit is equivalent to more than 10&amp;nbsp;kg on the ground (for a Falcon 9 1.0 it would need 250 tons of fuel to put 5 tons in GEO orbit or 10 tons in LEO).{{Cn|date=September 2018}} This limitation is a major factor in the difficulty of interplanetary missions as fuel becomes payload.

==Extraction techniques==

===Surface mining===

On some types of asteroids, material may be scraped off the surface using a [[Scoop (machine part)|scoop]] or [[Auger conveyor|auger]], or for larger pieces, an "active grab."&lt;ref name=te20130416/&gt; 
There is strong evidence that many asteroids consist of rubble piles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=L. Wilson |author2=K. Keil |author3=S. J. Love | title=The internal structures and densities of asteroids | journal=Meteoritics &amp; Planetary Science | year=1999 | volume=34 | issue=3 | pages=479–483 | bibcode=1999M&amp;PS...34..479W | doi=10.1111/j.1945-5100.1999.tb01355.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; making this approach possible.

===Shaft mining===

A mine can be dug into the asteroid, and the material extracted through the shaft. This requires precise knowledge to engineer accuracy of [[HORTA (mining)|astro-location]] under the [[regolith|surface regolith]] and a transportation system to carry the desired ore to the processing facility.

===Magnetic rakes===

Asteroids with a high metal content may be covered in loose grains that can be gathered by means of a magnet.&lt;ref name=te20130416/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=William K. Hartmann | title=The Shape of Kleopatra | journal=Science | year=2000 | volume=288 | issue=5467 | pages=820–821 | url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/288/5467/820 | doi=10.1126/science.288.5467.820 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heating===

For asteroids such as carbonaceous chondrites that contain hydrated minerals, water and other volatiles can be extracted simply by heating. A water extraction test in 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | last =Zacny | first =Kris | last2 =Metzger | first2 =Phil | last3 =Luczek | first3 =Kathryn | last4 =Matovani | first4 =James | last5 =Mueller | first5 =Robert | last6 =Spring | first6 =Justin | title =The World is Not Enough (WINE): Harvesting Local Resources for Eternal Exploration of Space | series=AIAA Space| location=Long Beach, CA | year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Honeybee Robotics used asteroid regolith simulant&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | last =Covey | first =Stephen | last2 =Lewis | first2 =John S. | last3 =Metzger | first3 =Philip | last4 =Britt | first4 =Daniel | last5 =Mueller | first5 =Robert | last6 =Wiggins | first6 =Sean | title =Simulating the Surface Morphology of a Carbonaceous Chondrite Asteroid | series=ASCE Earth &amp; Space| location=Orlando, FL | year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed by Deep Space Industries and the [[University of Central Florida]] to match the bulk mineralogy of a particular carbonaceous meteorite.  Although the simulant was physically dry (i.e., it contained no water molecules adsorbed in the matrix of the rocky material), heating to about 510&amp;nbsp;°C released [[hydroxyl]], which came out as substantial amounts of water vapor from the molecular structure of [[phyllosilicate]] clays and [[sulphur]] compounds. The vapor was condensed into liquid water filling the collection containers, demonstrating the feasibility of mining water from certain classes of physically dry asteroids.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

For volatile materials in extinct comets, heat can be used to melt and vaporize the matrix.&lt;ref name=te20130416/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David L. Kuck, "Exploitation of Space Oases", Proceedings of the Twelfth SSI-Princeton Conference, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extraction using the Mond process===

The nickel and iron of an iron rich asteroid could be extracted by the [[Mond process]]. This involves passing carbon monoxide over the asteroid at a temperature between 50 and 60&amp;nbsp;°C for nickel, higher for iron, and with high pressures and enclosed in materials that are resistant to the corrosive carbonyls. This forms the gases [[nickel tetracarbonyl]] and [[iron pentacarbonyl]] - then nickel and iron can be removed from the gas again at higher temperatures, perhaps in an attached printer, and platinum, gold etc. left as a residue.&lt;ref name="JenniskensDamer2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jenniskens|first1=Peter|last2=Damer|first2=Bruce|last3=Norkus|first3=Ryan|last4=Pilorz|first4=Stuart|last5=Nott|first5=Julian|last6=Grigsby|first6=Bryant|last7=Adams|first7=Constance|last8=Blair|first8=Brad R.|title=SHEPHERD: A Concept for Gentle Asteroid Retrieval with a Gas-Filled Enclosure|journal=New Space|volume=3|issue=1|year=2015|pages=36–43|issn=2168-0256|doi=10.1089/space.2014.0024|bibcode=2015NewSp...3...36J}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jenniskens, P., et al.

[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19910015913.pdf "Extraction of volatiles and metals from extraterrestrial materials."] (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-replicating machines===

A 1980 NASA study entitled ''Advanced Automation for Space Missions'' proposed a complex automated factory on the Moon that would work over several years to build 80% of a copy of itself, the other 20% being imported from Earth since those more complex parts (like computer chips) would require a vastly larger supply chain to produce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Advanced_Automation_for_Space_Missions |editor=Robert Freitas, William P. Gilbreath |editor-link=Robert Freitas | title=Advanced Automation for Space Missions| year=1982| id=NASA Conference Publication CP-2255 (N83-15348)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exponential growth of factories over many years could refine large amounts of lunar (or asteroidal) [[regolith]]. Since 1980 there has been major progress in [[miniaturization]], [[nanotechnology]], [[materials science]], and [[additive manufacturing]], so it may be possible to achieve 100% "closure" with a reasonably small mass of hardware, although these technology advancements are themselves enabled on Earth by expansion of the supply chain so it needs further study. A NASA study in 2012 proposed a "bootstrapping" approach to establish an in-space supply chain with 100% closure, suggesting it could be achieved in only two to four decades with low annual cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Metzger | first=Philip | last2=Muscatello | first2=Anthony | last3=Mueller | first3=Robert | last4=Mantovani | first4=James | title=Affordable, Rapid Bootstrapping of the Space Industry and Solar System Civilization | journal=Journal of Aerospace Engineering | volume=26 | issue=1 | pages=18–29 | date= January 2013 | language=English | doi=10.1061/(ASCE)AS.1943-5525.0000236 | arxiv=1612.03238 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A study in 2016 again claimed it is possible to complete in just a few decades because of ongoing advances in robotics, and it argued it will provide benefits back to the Earth including economic growth, environmental protection, and provision of clean energy while also providing humanity protection against existential threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Metzger | first=Philip | title=Space Development and Space Science Together, an Historic Opportunity | journal=Space Policy | volume=37 | issue=2 | pages=77–91 | date= August 2016 | language=English | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0265964616300625 | doi=10.1016/j.spacepol.2016.08.004 | access-date=2016-12-09 | arxiv=1609.00737}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed mining projects==

On April 24, 2012 a plan was announced by billionaire entrepreneurs to mine asteroids for their resources. The company is called [[Planetary Resources]] and its founders include aerospace entrepreneurs [[Eric C. Anderson|Eric Anderson]] and [[Peter Diamandis]]. Advisers include film director and explorer [[James Cameron]] and investors include Google's chief executive [[Larry Page]] and its executive chairman [[Eric Schmidt]].&lt;ref name='April 2012'/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Brad Lendon | title = Companies plan to mine precious metals in space | date = 24 April 2012 | url = http://lightyears.blogs.cnn.com/2012/04/24/companies-plan-to-mine-precious-metals-in-space/?hpt=hp_t3 | work = CNN News | accessdate = 2012-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also plan to create a fuel depot in space by 2020 by using water from asteroids, [[Water splitting|splitting it]] to liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen for [[rocket fuel]]. From there, it could be shipped to Earth orbit for refueling commercial satellites or spacecraft.&lt;ref name='April 2012'/&gt;  The plan has been met with skepticism by some scientists, who do not see it as cost-effective, even though platinum is worth £22 per gram and gold nearly £31 per gram (approximately £961 per troy ounce).{{when|date=September 2015}}   Platinum and gold are raw materials traded on terrestrial markets, and it is impossible to predict what prices either will command at the point in the future when resources from asteroids become available.   For example, platinum traditionally is very valuable due to its use in both industrial and jewelry applications, but should future technologies make the [[internal combustion engine]] obsolete, the demand for platinum's use as the catalyst in [[catalytic converters]] may well decline and decrease the metal's long term demand.  The ongoing NASA mission [[OSIRIS-REx]], which is planned to return just a minimal amount (60&amp;nbsp;g; two ounces) of material but could get up to 2&amp;nbsp;kg from an asteroid to Earth, will cost about US$1 billion.&lt;ref name='April 2012'/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asteroidmission.org/qa/|title=Q &amp; A – OSIRIS-REx Mission|author=|date=|website=asteroidmission.org|accessdate=24 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Planetary Resources says that, in order to be successful, it will need to develop technologies that bring the cost of space flight down. Planetary Resources also expects that the construction of "space infrastructure" will help to reduce long-term running costs. For example, fuel costs can be reduced by extracting water from asteroids and [[Water splitting|splitting]] to hydrogen using solar energy. In theory, hydrogen fuel mined from asteroids costs significantly less than fuel from Earth due to high costs of escaping Earth's gravity. If successful, investment in "space infrastructure" and economies of scale could reduce operational costs to levels significantly below NASA's ongoing ([[OSIRIS-REx]]) mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetaryresources.com/technology/|title=Technology – Planetary Resources|website=planetaryresources.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010142546/http://www.planetaryresources.com/technology/|archivedate=2012-10-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=September 2015}}This investment would have to be amortized through the sale of commodities, delaying any return to investors. There are also some indications that Planetary Resources expects government to fund infrastructure development, as was exemplified by its recent request for $700,000 from NASA to fund the first of the telescopes described above.

Another similar venture, called [[Deep Space Industries]], was started in 2013 by David Gump, who had founded other space companies.&lt;ref name="soper-2013"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.geekwire.com/2013/deep-space-industries-entering-asteroidmining-world-creates-competition-planetary-resources/| title=Deep Space Industries entering asteroid-mining world, creates competition for Planetary Resources | work=GeekWire: Dispatches from the Digital Frontier | date=January 22, 2013 | agency=GeekWire | accessdate=January 22, 2013 | author=Soper, Taylor}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the company hoped to begin prospecting for asteroids suitable for mining by 2015 and by 2016 return asteroid samples to Earth.&lt;ref name="dsi-pr-2013"&gt;{{cite press_release | url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2013/1/prweb10346181.htm | title=Commercial Asteroid Hunters announce plans for new Robotic Exploration Fleet | publisher=Deep Space Industries | date=January 22, 2013 | accessdate=January 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deep Space Industries planned to begin mining asteroids by 2023.&lt;ref name="wall-2013"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.space.com/19368-asteroid-mining-deep-space-industries.html |title=Asteroid-Mining Project Aims for Deep-Space Colonies | work=Space.com | date=January 22, 2013 | agency=TechMediaNetwork | accessdate=January 22, 2013 | author=Wall, Mike}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At ISDC-San Diego 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isdc.nss.org/2013/speakers-all.shtml|title=Current ISDC 2013 Speakers|website=nss.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kepler Energy and Space Engineering (KESE,llc) also announced it was going to mine asteroids, using a simpler, more straightforward approach: KESE plans to use almost exclusively existing guidance, navigation and anchoring technologies from mostly successful missions like the Rosetta/Philae, Dawn, and Hyabusa's Muses-C and current NASA Technology Transfer tooling to build and send a 4-module Automated Mining System (AMS) to a small asteroid with a simple digging tool to collect ~40 tons of asteroid regolith and bring each of the four return modules back to [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO) by the end of the decade. Small asteroids are expected to be loose piles of rubble, therefore providing for easy extraction.

In September 2012, the [[NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts]] (NIAC) announced the Robotic Asteroid Prospector project, which will examine and evaluate the feasibility of asteroid mining in terms of means, methods, and systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/offices/oct/early_stage_innovation/niac/2012_phase_I_fellows_cohen.html Robotic Asteroid Prospector (RAP) Staged from L-1: Start of the Deep Space Economy] nasa.gov, accessed 2012-09-11&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of its small escape velocity combined with large amounts of water ice, it also could serve as a source of water, fuel, and oxygen for ships going through and beyond the asteroid belt.&lt;ref name=AM101/&gt; Transportation from Mars or the Moon to Ceres would be even more energy-efficient than transportation from Earth to the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Economic Viability of Mars Colonization |author=Robert Zubrin |url=http://www.4frontierscorp.com/dev/assets/Economic%20Viability%20of%20Mars%20Colonization.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928081643/http://www.4frontierscorp.com/dev/assets/Economic%20Viability%20of%20Mars%20Colonization.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Potential targets==
According to the Asterank database{{when|date=October 2016}}&lt;!-- the prose should be explicit on time context. I'm not adding the date referenced today as the source (added by another editor) shows it was recently accessed, on 24Sep2016; so conceivably was correct on that date.

==Economics ==

Currently, the quality of the [[ore]] and the consequent cost and mass of equipment required to extract it are unknown and can only be speculated. Some economic analyses indicate that the cost of returning asteroidal materials to Earth far outweighs their market value, and that asteroid mining will not attract private investment at current commodity prices and space transportation costs.&lt;ref&gt;R. Gertsch and L. Gertsch, "[http://www.kemcom.net/EconAnal.pdf Economic analysis tools for mineral projects in space]", Space Resources Roundtable, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Jeffrey Kluger | title = Can James Cameron — Or Anyone — Really Mine Asteroids? | date = April 25, 2012 | url = http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,2112996,00.html?hpt=hp_c3 | work = Time Science | accessdate = 2012-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies suggest large profit by using [[solar power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094576598000873|title=The technical and economic feasibility of mining the near-earth asteroids| doi=10.1016/S0094-5765(98)00087-3|bibcode=1997AcAau..41..637S|volume=41|issue=4–10|pages=637–647|journal=Acta Astronautica|year=1997|last1=Sonter|first1=M.J}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Busch |first1=M. |title=Profitable Asteroid Mining |journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society |date=2004 |volume=57 |pages=301 |bibcode=2004JBIS...57..301B}}&lt;/ref&gt; Potential markets for materials can be identified and profit generated if extraction cost is brought down. For example, the delivery of multiple [[tonne]]s of water to [[low Earth orbit]] for rocket fuel preparation for [[space tourism]] could generate a significant profit if space tourism itself proves profitable, which has not been proven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Sonter | first = Mark | url = http://www.spacefuture.com/archive/mining_economics_and_risk_control_in_the_development_of_near_earth_asteriod_resources.shtml | title = Mining Economics and Risk-Control in the Development of Near-Earth-Asteroid Resources | publisher = Space Future | accessdate = 2006-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997 it was speculated that a relatively small metallic asteroid with a diameter of {{convert|1.6|km|mi|0|abbr=on|sp=us}} contains more than US$20 trillion worth of industrial and precious metals.&lt;ref name=MTS1997&gt;{{cite book | last = Lewis | first = John S. | title = Mining the Sky: Untold Riches from the Asteroids, Comets, and Planets | publisher = Perseus | year = 1997 | pages = | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=k9hwi3ktye8C&amp;dq=isbn=0201328194 | isbn = 978-0-201-32819-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chview.nova.org/station/ast-mine.htm|title=Asteroid Mining|website=nova.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; A comparatively small [[M-type asteroid]] with a mean diameter of {{convert|1|km|mi|abbr=on|sp=us}} could contain more than two billion metric tons of [[iron]]–[[nickel]] ore,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; or two to three times the world production of 2004.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.newmaterials.com/news/833.asp World Produces 1.05 Billion Tonnes of Steel in 2004] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060331081029/http://www.newmaterials.com/news/833.asp |date=March 31, 2006 }}", International Iron and Steel Institute, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The asteroid [[16 Psyche]] is believed to contain {{val|1.7|e=19|u=kg}} of nickel–iron, which could supply the world production requirement for several million years. A small portion of the extracted material would also be precious metals.

Not all mined materials from asteroids would be cost-effective, especially for the potential return of economic amounts of material to Earth. For potential return to Earth, [[platinum]] is considered very rare in terrestrial geologic formations and therefore is potentially worth bringing some quantity for terrestrial use. Nickel, on the other hand, is quite abundant and being mined in many terrestrial locations, so the high cost of asteroid mining may not make it economically viable.&lt;ref name=ibt20150421&gt;

=== Scarcity ===
{{Main|Natural resource #Classification}}
{{See also | Steady-state economy #Pushing some of the terrestrial limits into outer space }}
[[Scarcity]] is a fundamental economic problem of humans having seemingly unlimited wants in a world of limited resources. Since Earth's resources are not infinite, the relative abundance of asteroidal ore gives asteroid mining the potential to provide nearly unlimited resources, which would essentially [[Post-scarcity economy|eliminate scarcity]] for those materials.

The idea of exhausting resources is not new. In 1798, [[Thomas Malthus]] wrote, because resources are ultimately limited, the exponential growth in a population would result in falls in income per capita until poverty and starvation would result as a constricting factor on population.&lt;ref name="Lee, R. J. 2012"&gt;Lee, R. J. (2012). Law and Regulation of Commercial Mining of Minerals in Outer Space. (Vol. 7). New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;   It should be noted that Malthus posited this {{Age |1798|1|1}} years ago, and no sign has yet emerged of the Malthus effect regarding raw materials.   
* [[Proven reserve]]s are deposits of mineral resources that are already discovered and known to be economically extractable under present or similar demand, price and other economic and technological conditions.&lt;ref name="Lee, R. J. 2012"/&gt;
* Conditional reserves are discovered deposits that are not yet economically viable.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}
* Indicated reserves are less intensively measured deposits whose data is derived from surveys and geological projections. Hypothetical reserves and speculative resources make up this group of reserves.
* Inferred reserves are deposits that have been located but not yet exploited.&lt;ref name="Lee, R. J. 2012"/&gt;

Continued development in asteroid mining techniques and technology will help to increase mineral discoveries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.space.com/29323-nasa-manned-mars-exploration-plans.html Roadmap for Manned Missions to Mars Reaching 'Consensus.' NASA Chief Says], Elizabeth Howell. ''Space.com'' |quote="We really are trying to demonstrate we can develop the technologies and the techniques to help commercial companies, entrepreneurs and others get to asteroids and mine them."&lt;/ref&gt; As the cost of extracting mineral resources, especially platinum group metals, on Earth rises, the cost of extracting the same resources from celestial bodies declines due to technological innovations around space exploration.&lt;ref name="Lee, R. J. 2012"/&gt;  However, it should be noted that the "substitution effect", i.e. the use of other materials for the functions now performed by platinum, would increase in strength as the cost of platinum increased.   New supplies would also come to market in the form of jewelry and recycled electronic equipment from itinerant "we buy platinum" businesses like the "we buy gold" businesses that exist now.

{{asof|2016|09}}, there are 711 known asteroids with a value exceeding [[United States dollar|US$]]100 trillion.&lt;ref name=asterank20160924/&gt;

=== Financial feasibility ===

Space ventures are high-risk, with long lead times and heavy capital investment, and that is no different for asteroid-mining projects. These types of ventures could be funded through private investment or through government investment. For a commercial venture it can be profitable as long as the revenue earned is greater than total costs (costs for extraction and costs for marketing).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Lee, R. J. (2012). Law and Regulation of Commercial Mining of Minerals in Outer Space. (Vol. 7). New York: Springer&lt;/ref&gt; The costs involving an asteroid-mining venture have been estimated to be around US$100 billion in 1996.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

There are six categories of cost considered for an asteroid mining venture:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
# Research and development costs
# Exploration and prospecting costs
# Construction and infrastructure development costs
# Operational and engineering costs
# Environmental costs
# Time cost

Determining financial feasibility is best represented through [[net present value]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; One requirement needed for financial feasibility is a high [[return on investment]]s estimating around 30%.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Example calculation assumes for simplicity that the only valuable material on asteroids is platinum. On August 16, 2016 platinum was valued at $1157 per [[ounce]] or $37,000 per kilogram. At a price of $1,340, for a 10% return on investment, {{convert|5,575,000|ozt|kg|order=flip|abbr=on}} of platinum would have to be extracted for every 1,155,000 tons of asteroid ore. For a 50% return on investment {{convert|54,750,000|ozt|kg|order=flip|abbr=on}} of platinum would have to be extracted for every 11,350,000 tons of asteroid ore. This analysis assumes that doubling the supply of platinum to the market (5.13 million ounces in 2014) would have no effect on the price of platinum. A more realistic assumption is that increasing the supply by this amount would reduce the price 30–50%.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

A Techno-Economic Analysis of Asteroid Mining. arXiv preprint arXiv:1810.03836.[https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1810/1810.03836.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; have specifically explored the case where platinum is brought from space to Earth and estimate that economically viable asteroid mining for this specific case would be rather challenging. 

Decreases in the price of space access matter.  The start of operational use of the low-cost-per-kilogram-in-orbit [[Falcon Heavy]] launch vehicle in 2018 is projected by astronomer Martin Elvis to have increased the extent of economically-minable near-Earth asteroids from hundreds to thousands.  With the increased availability of several kilometers per second of [[delta-v]] that Falcon Heavy provides, it increases the number of NEAs accessible from 3 percent to around 45 percent.&lt;ref name=gizmodo20180218&gt;

== Regulation and safety ==
Space law involves a specific set of [[International law|international treaties]], along with national [[statutory law]]s. The system and framework for international and domestic laws have emerged in part through the [[United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unoosa.org/oosa/en/ourwork/spacelaw/index.html|title=Space Law|last=sinead.harvey|date=|website=unoosa.org|accessdate=24 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rules, terms and agreements that space law authorities consider to be part of the active body of international space law are the five international space treaties and five UN declarations. Approximately 100 nations and institutions were involved in negotiations.  The space treaties cover many major issues such as arms control, non-appropriation of space, freedom of exploration, liability for damages, safety and rescue of astronauts and spacecraft, prevention of harmful interference with space activities and the environment, notification and registration of space activities, and the settlement of disputes. In exchange for assurances from the space power, the nonspacefaring nations acquiesced to U.S. and Soviet proposals to treat outer space as a commons (res communis) territory which belonged to no one state.

Asteroid mining in particular is covered by both international treaties—for example, the [[Outer Space Treaty]]—and national statutory laws—for example, specific legislative acts in the [[SPACE Act of 2015|United States]]&lt;ref&gt;

Varying degrees of criticism exist regarding international space law. Some critics accept the Outer Space Treaty, but reject the Moon Agreement. Therefore, it is important to note that even the Moon Agreement with its common heritage of mankind clause, allows space mining, extraction, private property rights and exclusive ownership rights over natural outer space resources, if removed from their natural place. The Outer Space Treaty and the Moon Agreement allow private property rights for outer space natural resources once removed from the surface, subsurface or subsoil of the moon and other celestial bodies in outer space. Thus, international space law is capable of managing newly emerging space mining activities, private space transportation, commercial spaceports and commercial space stations/habitats/settlements. Space mining involving the extraction and removal of natural resources from their natural location is without question allowable under the Outer Space Treaty and the Moon Agreement. Once removed, those natural resources can be reduced to possession, sold, traded and explored or used for scientific purposes. International space law allows space mining, specifically the extraction of natural resources. It is generally understood within the space law authorities that extracting space resources is allowable, even by private companies for profit. However, international space law prohibits property rights over territories and outer space land.

Astrophysicists [[Carl Sagan]] and [[Steven J. Ostro]] raised the concern [[Asteroid impact avoidance#Deflection technology concerns|altering the trajectories of asteroids]] near Earth might pose a collision hazard threat. They concluded that orbit engineering has both opportunities and dangers: if controls instituted on orbit-manipulation technology were too tight, future spacefaring could be hampered, but if they were too loose, human civilization would be at risk.&lt;ref name="Hazards"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ostro1998&gt;

=== The Outer Space Treaty ===
{{Main|Outer Space Treaty}}{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
After ten years of negotiations between nearly 100 nations, the Outer Space Treaty opened for signature on January 27, 1966. It entered into force as the constitution for outer space on October 10, 1967.  The Outer Space Treaty was well received; it was ratified by ninety-six nations and signed by an additional twenty-seven states. The outcome has been that the basic foundation of international space law consists of five (arguably four) international space treaties, along with various written resolutions and declarations. The main international treaty is the Outer Space Treaty of 1967; it is generally viewed as the "Constitution" for outer space. By ratifying the Outer Space Treaty of 1967, ninety-eight nations agreed that outer space would belong to the "province of mankind", that all nations would have the freedom to "use" and "explore" outer space, and that both these provisions must be done in a way to "benefit all mankind". The province of mankind principle and the other key terms have not yet been specifically defined (Jasentuliyana, 1992). Critics have complained that the Outer Space Treaty is vague. Yet, international space law has worked well and has served space commercial industries and interests for many decades. The taking away and extraction of Moon rocks, for example, has been treated as being legally permissible.

The framers of Outer Space Treaty initially focused on solidifying broad terms first, with the intent to create more specific legal provisions later (Griffin, 1981: 733–734). This is why the members of the COPUOS later expanded the Outer Space Treaty norms by articulating more specific understandings which are found in the "three supplemental agreements" – the Rescue and Return Agreement of 1968, the Liability Convention of 1973, and the Registration Convention of 1976 (734).

Hobe (2006){{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} explains that the Outer Space Treaty "explicitly and implicitly prohibits only the acquisition of territorial property rights" – public or private, but extracting space resources is allowable.

=== The Moon Agreement ===
{{Main|Moon Agreement}}
The Moon Agreement (1979–1984) is often treated{{by whom|date=October 2016}} as though it is not a part of the body of international space law, and there has been extensive debate on whether or not the Moon Agreement is a valid part of international law. It entered into force in 1984, because of a five state ratification consensus procedure, agreed upon by the members of the United Nations Committee on Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS). Still today very few nations have signed and/or ratified the Moon Agreement. In recent years this figure has crept up to a few more than a dozen nations who have signed and ratified the treaty. The other three outer space treaties experienced a high level of international cooperation in terms of signage and ratification, but the Moon Treaty went further than them, by defining the Common Heritage concept in more detail and by imposing specific obligations on the parties engaged in the exploration and/or exploitation of outer space. The Moon Treaty explicitly designates the Moon and its natural resources as part of the Common Heritage of Mankind.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

The Moon Agreement allows space mining, specifically the extraction of natural resources. The treaty specifically provides in Article 11, paragraph 3 that:{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Neither the surface nor the subsurface of the Moon, nor any part thereof or natural resources in place [emphasis added], shall become property of any State, international intergovernmental or non-governmental organization, national organization or non-governmental entity or of any natural person. The placement of personnel, space vehicles, equipment, facilities, stations and installations on or below the surface of the Moon, including structures connected with its surface or subsurface, shall not create a right of ownership over the surface or the subsurface of the Moon or any areas thereof.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The objection to the treaty by the spacefaring nations is held to be the requirement that extracted resources (and the technology used to that end) must be shared with other nations. The similar regime in the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] is believed to impede the development of such industries on the seabed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Legal regimes of some countries===
Some nations are beginning to promulgate legal regimes for extraterrestrial resource extraction.  For example, the United States "[[SPACE Act of 2015]]"—facilitating private development of space resources consistent with US international treaty obligations—passed the [[US House of Representatives]] in July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2262 H.R.2262 – SPACE Act of 2015], accessed 14 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wp20150522&gt;

==Environmental Impact==
A positive impact of asteroid mining has been conjectured as being an enabler of transferring industrial activities into space, such as energy generation &lt;ref&gt;Metzger, P. T. (2016). Space development and space science together, an historic opportunity. Space Policy, 37, 77-91.[https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1609/1609.00737.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;. A quantitative analysis of the potential environmental benefits of water and platinum mining in space has been developed, where potentially large benefits could materialize, depending on the ratio of material mined in space and mass launched into space &lt;ref&gt;Hein, A. M., Saidani, M., &amp; Tollu, H. (2018). Exploring Potential Environmental Benefits of Asteroid Mining. arXiv preprint arXiv:1810.04749.[https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1810/1810.04749.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;.

== In fiction ==

The first mention of asteroid mining in science fiction apparently came in Garrett P. Serviss' story ''[[Edison's Conquest of Mars]]'', published in the ''New York Evening Journal'' in  1898.&lt;ref&gt;TechNovelGy timeline, [http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/content.asp?Bnum=1930 ''Asteroid Mining''] {{webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120307155718/http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/content.asp?Bnum=1930 |date= March 7, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garrett P. Serviss, ''Edison's Conquest of Mars'' at [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19141/19141-h/19141-h.htm Project Gutenberg]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1979 film [[Alien (film)|''Alien'']], directed by [[Ridley Scott]], features the crew of the ''Nostromo'', a commercially-operated spaceship on a return trip to Earth hauling a refinery and 20 million tons of mineral ore mined from an asteroid.

[[C. J. Cherryh]]'s 1991 novel, ''[[Devil to the Belt|Heavy Time]]'', focuses on the plight of asteroid miners in the [[Alliance-Union universe]], while ''[[Moon (film)|Moon]]'' is a 2009 British science fiction drama film depicting a lunar facility that mines the alternative fuel [[helium-3]] needed to provide energy on Earth. It was notable for its realism and drama, winning several awards internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://rottentomatoes.com/m/10009075-moon/|title= Moon (2009) |publisher= Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate= 17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.metacritic.com/movie/moon|title= Moon|publisher= Metacritic |accessdate= 11 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last= Wise | first= Damon | url= http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/arts/film/reviews/article1864390.ece | title= Poignant tale of starman waiting in the sky | work= [[The Times]] | date= 24 January 2009 | accessdate= 24 February 2009 | location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several science-fiction [[video games]] include asteroid mining. For example, in the space-[[Massively multiplayer online game|MMO]], ''[[EVE Online]]'', asteroid mining is a very popular career, owing to its simplicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Mining guide |url= https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Mining_guide |website= EVE Online Wiki |publisher= EVE Online |accessdate= 12 February 2013 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130117185138/http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Mining_guide |archivedate= 17 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= EVE Evolved: Mining 101 – Advanced mining|url= http://massively.joystiq.com/2011/01/23/eve-evolved-mining-101-advanced-mining/|website= EVE Evolved|publisher= Joystiq|accessdate= 12 February 2013|author= Brendan Drain|date= 23 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="youtube-eve"&gt;{{cite web|author= MMOGames|title= EVE Online Beginner's Guide – Episode 3 (Choosing A Focus)|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0mwJ6ngyA|website= EVE Online Beginner's Guide|publisher= YouTube|accessdate= 12 February 2013|format= Video|date= 20 April 2012}} – relevant content is between 1m00s and 1m50s in the video.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the computer game ''[[Star Citizen]]'', the mining occupation supports a variety of dedicated specialists, each of which has a critical role to play in the effort.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[The Expanse (novel series) | ''The Expanse'']] series of novels, asteroid mining is a driving economic force behind the colonization of the solar system. Since huge energy input is required to escape planets' gravity, the novels imply that once space-based mining platforms are established, it will be more efficient to harvest natural resources (water, oxygen, building materials, etc.) from asteroids rather than lifting them out of Earth's gravity well.{{citation needed|date= June 2018}}

'''Atheists of Florida''' ('''AOF''') is a [[501(c)(3) organization|501(c)(3)]] [[Education|educational]] [[nonprofit organization]]. Their main goal is to advocate for [[separation of church and state]].

==History==
Atheists of Florida, like many other atheist groups affiliated with the Atheist Alliance, had its beginning as a chapter of American Atheists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Golly|first1=Ed|title=History of Atheists of Florida|url=http://aof.ngo|website=Atheists of Florida}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1980s, [[American Atheists]] (AA) operated a chapter program intended to increase membership through the activities of these chapters. To indemnify the organization from being financially depleted through a lawsuit, [[Madalyn Murray O’Hair]], founder of AA, formed six organizations in addition to the anchor corporation, Society of Separationists, Inc. A board of directors was established for each corporation consisting of O’Hair, her son, Jon Murray, president for life of American Atheists, and her adopted granddaughter, Robin Murray O’Hair, and two other members of AA. This way, the O’Hair family retained complete control of all corporations.

O’Hair structured the business to provide for the future of her family. Any funds inherited by the organization became the private property of the O’Hair family, never accounted for within the organization.
Christos Tzanetakos, Director of the Miami Chapter of AA and a member of one of the corporate boards, expressed concerns about how AA was being run. He asserted it should be run according to laws governing 501 (c) (3) organizations whereby the membership would elect the officers, similar to the operating practices of the National Academy of Sciences. AA, he contended, was in violation of non-profit organization laws. Tzanetakos complained to the IRS suggesting AA was operating in violation of the law. O’Hair responded by closing all but one of the chapters (the surviving chapter was involved in litigation at the time). Tzanetakos had accumulated over $6,000 in donations he intended to use to instigate a scholarship fund sponsored by the Miami chapter. Chapter bank accounts had been opened using the AA 501 (c) (3) charter documents in each state, which subsequently gave the O’Hairs access to all bank accounts. The O’Hairs closed the chapter.

Tzanetakos, with the backing of his membership, decided to incorporate Atheists of Florida (A of F), which was don January 22, 1992.

A second AA chapter had been operating in the Tampa Bay Area. When closed with all the others, it continued to hold casual meetings that accomplished little more than camaraderie among the members.

Upon formation of A of F, Tzanetakos contacted the Tampa chapter informing them of his actions and explaining that if a minimum of ten members from a common geographic area joined A of F, they could form a chapter. The local chapter consented to become members of A of F.

The Miami chapter eventually dissolved while the Tampa Bay chapter continued to grow. Increasingly, the majority of board members came from the Tampa Bay area, and eventually the Tampa chapter obtained space in a commercial building in South Tampa, which evolved into the headquarters of the organization.

== Controversy ==

===2004 Invocation to Tampa City Council===
On July 29, 2004, a member of Atheists of Florida (Michael R. Harvey) was scheduled to give the invocation to the [[Tampa City Council]]. As the meeting opened, one of the City Council members made a motion to stop the delivery of the invocation by an atheist. Several council members defended the right of the member to deliver the invocation. The motion ended in a tie, after one council member left the meeting, asserting that "I don't have to sit here and listen to an atheist tell me what I should or should not believe." With the invocation set to begin, another two council members left the meeting, claiming that they rather not listen to an atheist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tbo.com/news/politics/nd-group-asks-tampa-city-council-to-halt-invocations-56296 |title=2nd group asks Tampa City Council to halt invocations |website=TBO.com |date= |accessdate=2016-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religious intrusion into public schools ===
In January, 2016, Atheists of Florida met with the [[Hillsborough County Public Schools|Hillsborough County School]] superintendent concerning the involvement of various religious groups in the public school system and the oversight of these groups to ensure they are following the constitution. This followed the press coverage of T-shirts supplied to various school officials proclaiming the school's partnership with a local [[Baptists|Baptist church]], along with the church's symbol on the shirts, which consisted of two crosses. Other groups were found to be participating in the schools in what appeared to be violation of the [[Equal Access Act]]. The school board has responded with an effort to ensure that all groups are following the constitution.

Some of these same groups are involved in school districts throughout the state of Florida, Atheists of Florida have contacted several other school districts in regard to the involvement of these groups in their school district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/gradebook/aclu-asks-eakins-for-church-state-review/2260581|title=ACLU asks Eakins for church-state review &amp;#124; Tampa Bay Times|date=2016-01-08|website=Tampabay.com|accessdate=2016-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://livesite-prd-loadbalancer-1407837793.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/blogs/gradebook/more-about-the-idlewild-controversy/2254977|title=More about the Idlewild controversy &amp;#124; Tampa Bay Times|date=2015-11-22|website=Livesite-prd-loadbalancer-1407837793.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com|accessdate=2016-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Greece (town), New York|Greece, New York]] decision by the Supreme Court, Atheists of Florida members have delivered invocations on several occasions to various local government bodies, all without incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/localgovernment/atheists-joining-those-making-invocations-at-local-government-meetings/2191987 |title=Atheists joining those making invocations at local government meetings (w/video) &amp;#124; Tampa Bay Times |website=Tampabay.com |date=2014-08-07 |accessdate=2016-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Daniel Ruth |url=http://www.tampabay.com/opinion/columns/ruth-an-atheist-visits-and-all-hell-does-not-break-loose/2192997 |title=Ruth: An atheist visits, and all hell does not break loose &amp;#124; Tampa Bay Times |website=Tampabay.com |date=2014-08-14 |accessdate=2016-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tampabay.com/incoming/atheists-challenging-lakelands-prayers-at-meetings/1079710 |title=Atheists challenging Lakeland's prayers at meetings &amp;#124; News update, news roundup &amp;#124; Tampa Bay Times |website=Tampabay.com |date=2010-03-13 |accessdate=2016-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/localgovernment/lakeland-not-pinellas-park-named-in-atheists-lawsuit/1108653 |title=Lakeland, not Pinellas Park, named in atheists' lawsuit &amp;#124; Tampa Bay Times |website=Tampabay.com |date=2010-07-13 |accessdate=2016-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Saunders |first=Jim |url=http://www.theledger.com/article/20130326/NEWS/130329359/0/search |title=Federal Appeals Court Rules Prayer Before Lakeland City Commission Meetings OK |website=TheLedger.com |date=2013-03-26 |accessdate=2016-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Drumm |first=Sara |url=http://www.theledger.com/article/20131023/NEWSCHIEF/131029722/0/search |title=Court Ruling Could Affect Invocations at City Government Meetings |website=TheLedger.com |date= |accessdate=2016-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Malcolm X any means necessary.jpg|thumb|This poster, based on a famous photograph from ''[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]'', popularized the slogan.]]

'''By any means necessary''' is a translation of a phrase used by French intellectual [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] in his play ''[[Dirty Hands]]''. It entered the popular [[civil rights]] culture through a speech given by [[Malcolm X]] at the [[Organization of Afro-American Unity]] founding rally on June 28, 1964. It is generally considered to leave open all available tactics for the desired ends, including [[violence]]; however, the “necessary” qualifier adds a caveat—if violence is not necessary, then presumably, it should not be used.

== Jean-Paul Sartre ==

The phrase is translation of a sentence used in French intellectual Jean-Paul Sartre's play ''Dirty Hands'':

{{quote
| text = I was not the one to invent lies: they were created in a [[society]] divided by [[Social class|class]] and each of us inherited lies when we were born. It is not by refusing to lie that we will abolish lies: it is by eradicating class ''by any means necessary''.
| sign = Jean-Paul Sartre
| source = ''Dirty Hands'': act 5, scene 3. 1963&lt;ref name="Bartleby" /&gt;
}}

== Malcolm X ==

It entered the popular culture through a speech given by Malcolm X in the last year of his life.
{{quote
| text = We declare our right on this earth to be a man, to be a human being, to be respected as a human being, to be given the rights of a human being in this society, on this earth, in this day, which we intend to bring into existence ''by any means necessary''.
| sign = Malcolm X
| source = 1965&lt;ref name="Malcolm X 1992" /&gt;
}}

=== Mandela case ===

In the final scene of the 1992 movie ''[[Malcolm X (1992 film)|Malcolm X]]'', [[Nelson Mandela]]—recently released after 27&amp;nbsp;years of political imprisonment—appears as a schoolteacher in a [[Soweto]] classroom.&lt;ref name="Cunningham 2004-06-03" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guerrero 1993" /&gt; Yet Mandela informed director [[Spike Lee]] that he could not utter the famous final phrase ''"by any means necessary"'' on camera; fearing that the [[apartheid]] government would use it against him if he did. Lee obliged, and the final seconds of the film feature black-and-white footage of Malcolm X himself delivering the phrase.&lt;ref name="Guerrero 1993" /&gt;

The '''Byron David Smith killings''' occurred on [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving Day]] of 2012, when Haile Kifer, 18, and her cousin, Nicholas Brady, 17, broke into the home of Byron David Smith, 64, in [[Little Falls, Minnesota]], in the [[United States]]. Smith, armed with a [[Ruger Mini-14]],&lt;ref name=WPTV&gt;{{cite news |title=Byron David Smith killed teens Haile Kifer, Nicholas Schaeffel because he feared weapons, cops say |url=http://www.wptv.com/dpp/news/national/byron-david-smith-killed-teens-haile-kifer-nicholas-schaeffel-because-he-feared-weapons-cops-say |newspaper=WPTV |date=November 27, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121130020345/http://www.wptv.com/dpp/news/national/byron-david-smith-killed-teens-haile-kifer-nicholas-schaeffel-because-he-feared-weapons-cops-say |archivedate=2012-11-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; shot the teens separately and minutes apart as they entered the basement where he was, later stating to police he was worried about them being armed. 

The case sparked debate over the [[Castle Doctrine|"castle doctrine"]], which allows a homeowner to defend his home with lethal force.&lt;ref name=Louwagie&gt;{{cite news|last1=Louwagie|first1=Pam|last2=Brooks|first2=Jennifer|title=Byron Smith gets life sentence for murdering two Little Falls teens|url=http://www.startribune.com/local/257169671.html|newspaper=Star Tribune|date=April 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=njsd&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2008/Bills/A0500/159_I1.PDF|title=Assembly, No. 159, State of New Jersey, 213th Legislature, The "New Jersey Self Defense Law"| date= May 6, 2008| quote=The "Castle Doctrine" is a long-standing American legal concept arising from English Common Law that provides that one's abode is a special area in which one enjoys certain protections and immunities, that one is not obligated to retreat before defending oneself against attack, and that one may do so without fear of prosecution. |accessdate=2009-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecution alleged that Smith's actions showed aspects of premeditation (see [[lying in wait]]) and he used excessive force in relation to the threat.

==Lead up==
Smith, 64, was retired from the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]]&lt;ref name=publicradio&gt;{{cite news|last=Baran|first=Madeleine|title=Little Falls shooter protected U.S. embassies from terrorists and spies|url=http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2012/11/28/crime/little-falls-byron-smith-shooter-protected-us-embassies-terrorists-spies/|newspaper=MPR News|publisher=© Minnesota Public Radio |date=November 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had a history of international travel to Moscow, Bangkok and Beijing.&lt;ref name=StarTrib22Dec/&gt; Smith's brother described him as a retired [[security engineering]] officer.&lt;ref name="moreshots"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Forliti |first1=Amy |title=Minn. man says he 'fired more shots than I needed' |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/little-falls-mourns-teen-cousin-shooting-victims |accessdate= August 29, 2018 |work=Associated Press |agency=AP News |publisher=© Associated Press |date=27 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141026211139/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/little-falls-mourns-teen-cousin-shooting-victims |archivedate=26 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the incident, Byron Smith had been burglarized at least half a dozen times over the preceding few months. Among the items stolen were thousands of dollars in cash, the watch his father had received after spending nearly a year as a [[POW]] in [[World War II]], medals and ribbons Smith had earned in the [[Air Force]] during the [[Vietnam War]], several firearms, and jewelry. Smith began routinely wearing a holster with a loaded gun inside his home. There is some evidence that Kifer and Brady committed at least a couple of the previous break-ins and were being investigated for prior burglaries, including one earlier on the day they were killed.&lt;ref name="security system"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Oakes&gt;{{cite news|last1=Oakes|first1=Larry|last2=Powell|first2=Joy|title=One break-in tied to slain Little Falls teens, others being investigated|url=http://www.startribune.com/one-break-in-tied-to-slain-little-falls-teens-others-being-investigated/181189391/|accessdate=August 29, 2018|work=StarTribune|publisher=© StarTribune|date=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith installed a security system to protect himself.&lt;ref name="security system"&gt;{{cite news|title=Byron Smith: Trial set to begin for Minnesota man who fatally shot teens in his home|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/trial-set-to-begins-for-minnesota-man-who-shot-teens-in-his-home/|work=Associated Press|agency=www.cbsnews.com|publisher=© CBS Interactive Inc.|date=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incident==
On November 22, 2012, Kifer and Brady broke into Smith's home. Video surveillance captured the teens casing the property prior to the break-in.&lt;ref name="rawvideo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Byron Smith house surveillance (RAW video)|url=http://www.sctimes.com/videos/news/local/2014/05/07/8822029/|website=www.sctimes.com|publisher=© St. Cloud Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By his own account to police, Smith was in the basement when he shot Brady twice at the top of the basement stairs, and once in the face fatally after he fell to the bottom of the stairs. Minutes later when Kifer entered the basement, he shot her at the top of the stairs. Wounded, she fell down the stairs, and after Smith's rifle jammed, he shot her multiple times in the chest with a [[.22 LR|22-caliber]] [[revolver]], dragged her across the floor to set her beside the body of her cousin, and then shot her fatally under the chin.&lt;ref name=WPTV/&gt; 

Audio and video of the events were recorded by Smith's security system. &lt;ref name=audio&gt;{{cite news|title=HEAR IT: Graphic audio catches moment Byron Smith guns down two teens|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/hear-graphic-audio-catches-moment-byron-smith-guns-teens-article-1.1776145|work=Associated Press|agency=New York Daily News|publisher=©  NYDailyNews.com|date=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=video&gt;{{cite news|last=Associated Press|title=Man who 'shot dead two teen cousins who broke into his home on Thanksgiving has CCTV footage of burglary and shooting'|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2246080/Byron-David-Smith-CCTV-footage-teen-cousins-breaking-Minnesota-home-Thanksgiving-shot-dead.html|newspaper=Daily Mail UK|date=December 10, 2012|publisher=© Associated Newspapers Ltd.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
The deaths were not immediately reported to police. Smith waited until the next day to notify police of the shootings, claiming he didn't want to bother the police on Thanksgiving.&lt;ref name="security system"/&gt;&lt;ref name="evidence"&gt;{{cite news|title=Byron Smith Trial: Homeowner Convicted of Murdering 2 Teens|url=http://www.newsmax.com/TheWire/byron-smith-trial-homeowner-convicted/2014/04/30/id/568615/|accessdate=August 29, 2018|work=Newsmax.com|agency=Newsmax Wires|publisher=© Newsmax Media, Inc.|date=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morrison County Sheriff Michel Wetzel has acknowledged that Brady and Kifer were there to burglarize Smith's residence.&lt;ref name="StarTrib22Dec"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brown|first1=Curt|last2=Louwagie|first2=Pam|last3=Powell|first3=Joy|title=Little Falls teen shooting deaths called 'cold-blooded'|url=http://www.startribune.com/no-9-little-falls-teen-shooting-deaths-called-cold-blooded/180853761/?refer=y|accessdate=29 May 2016|work=Star Tribune|publisher=© StarTribune|date=22 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brady's sister claimed Brady stole drugs from her home August 28 in a case that was still under investigation.&lt;ref name=moreshots/&gt; Evidence recovered from the car driven by Brady was linked to a burglary of the residence of a retired teacher the night before he and Kifer were killed by Byron Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.startribune.com/local/181119611.html |first=Joy |last=Powell |title=Slain teenage cousins are linked to an earlier Little Falls break-in? |newspaper=Star Tribune | publisher=© StarTribune |date=November 28, 2012 |accessdate=29 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith's statements to police describe delivering killing shots to the heads of both victims after he had shot them on the stairs and they had fallen to the basement floor wounded.&lt;ref name=Pioneer&gt;{{cite news |last1=Magan |first1=Christopher |last2=Lindberg |first2=Joseph |date=November 25, 2012 |title=Little Falls man describes 'finishing' teenagers with shots to heads |url=http://www.twincities.com/localnews/ci_22067764/little-falls-man-describes-finishing-teenagers-shots-heads |newspaper=Pioneer Press | publisher=© Digital First Media|accessdate=2014-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Criminal Complaint: State of Minn. vs. Byron David Smith | url=http://stmedia.startribune.com/documents/Criminal+Complaint+-+BYRON+SMITH.pdf | website=stmedia.startribune.com|format=pdf|date=26 November 2012| accessdate=August 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his statement, Smith said that Kifer had let out a short laugh after she fell down the stairs, saying "If you're trying to shoot somebody and they laugh at you, you go again." The audiotape did not record Kifer laughing; instead she cries "Oh my God!" in fear. In police interviews Smith acknowledged "firing more shots than I needed to" and that he fired "a good clean finishing shot" into Kifer's head.&lt;ref name=publicradio/&gt;

==Castle doctrine debate==
Legal analysts have stated that the initial shootings most likely would have been justified under Minnesota's laws, but that the subsequent shots were not justified once any threat had been removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thornton |first=Patrick |url=http://minnlawyer.com/2012/12/07/in-morrison-county-shooting-case-minnesota-state-law-on-trial/ |title=In Morrison County shooting case, Minnesota state law on trial |publisher=Minnesota Lawyer |date=December 7, 2012 |accessdate=2012-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheriff Wetzel said that "The law doesn't permit you to execute somebody once a threat is gone."&lt;ref name=moreshots/&gt; [[Hamline University School of Law]] professor Joseph Olson: "I think the first shot is justified. After the person is no longer a threat because they're seriously wounded, the application of self-defense is over."&lt;ref name=StarTrib22Dec/&gt;

A number of aspects of the case were noted by police as being inconsistent with self-defense. Smith moved his truck earlier in the day. He claimed it was in order to clean his garage. Prosecutors argued at his trial that it was an attempt to make the house look abandoned in order to lure the burglars into his home.&lt;ref name=Nye&gt;{{cite news|last=Nye|first=James|title='You're dying b****!' Court releases the chilling audio recording of two teen burglars being murdered by homeowner, 65, who set a trap for them in his basement|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2618100/Court-releases-audio-chilling-murders-two-teen-burglars-recorded-65-year-old-killer-set-trap-basement.html|newspaper=Daily Mail UK|publisher=&amp;copy; Associated Newspapers Ltd| date=May 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his home surveillance system, Smith also recorded at least 6 hours of audio on a digital recorder in the basement of the residence.&lt;ref name="security system"/&gt; He was sitting in a chair at the bottom of the stairs with a loaded rifle and a tape recorder that captured not only the shootings, but also a monologue by Smith. Prior to the break-in, he is heard saying "In your left eye." and "I realize I don't have an appointment but I would like to see one of the lawyers here.". The prosecution noted that Kifer was later shot in the left eye by Smith and allege that the other statement is a rehearsal of what he would say after the shooting—an indication that he knew he would soon need an attorney.&lt;ref name=Gerdes&gt;{{cite news|last=Gerdes|first=Ashli|title=Byron Smith Murder Trial Case Sent to Jury|url=http://wjon.com/byron-smith-murder-trial-case-sent-to-jury/|newspaper=WJON|publisher=&amp;copy; Townsquare Media, LLC|date=April 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following the shootings, Smith captured a number of statements including: "I am not a bleeding heart liberal. I felt like I was cleaning up a mess - not like spilled food, not like vomit, not even like…not even like diarrhea - the worst mess possible. And I was stuck with it…in some tiny little respect…in some tiny little respect. I was doing my civic duty. If the law enforcement system couldn't handle it, I had to do it. I had to do it. The law system couldn't handle her and if it fell into my lap and she dropped her problem in my lap…and she threw her own problem in my face. And I had to clean it up."&lt;ref name=Gerdes/&gt; Smith's recorded statements, the evidence indicating he had planned the shootings, along with the excessive number of shots fired led to the charge of second degree murder.&lt;ref name=Gerdes/&gt; Smith was initially charged with two counts of second degree murder, however, in April 2013, he was indicted on two counts of first degree murder.&lt;ref name=StarTrib22Dec/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pioneer/&gt; Bail was later set at $50,000, which Smith posted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shenoy|first1=Rupa|last2=Forliti|first2=Amy|last3=Associated Press|title=Grand jury indicts Byron Smith of first-degree murder in shooting deaths of 2 teens|url=http://www.mprnews.org/story/2013/04/25/news/little-falls-shooter-byron-smith-charged|accessdate=August 29, 2018 |work=www.mprnews.org|publisher=&amp;copy; Minnesota Public Radio|date=25 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hamline law professor emeritus Joseph Daly commented that the laws surrounding the case were dividing the Little Falls community. "In some states, somebody breaks into your home you are allowed to shoot them dead. Period," said Daly. He pointed out others states, such as Florida have a "stand your ground" law, but Minnesota has what's known as a reasonable person doctrine. "If a reasonable person would see if you are in fear of great bodily harm of death. That's our statute. It comes down to what would a reasonable person see in this situation for Mr. Smith?" said Daly.&lt;ref name=Daly&gt;{{cite news|last=Seavert|first=Lindsay|title=Byron Smith trial set to begin Monday|url=http://www.kare11.com/story/news/crime/2014/04/20/byron-smith-little-falls-teenagers-shot-trial-monday/7951511/|newspaper=Kare11|publisher=&amp;copy;KARE-TV|date=April 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial==
On April 29, 2014, Byron David Smith was found guilty on two counts of first-degree murder with premeditation and on two counts of second-degree murder after three hours of jury deliberations. He was immediately sentenced to life in prison without parole.&lt;ref name="minnesota.cbslocal.com"/&gt; The audio recordings were named by the jurors as the biggest influence on their decision. "That was the most damning piece of evidence in my mind," Wes Hatlestad, one of 12 jurors, said following the trial. "That audio recording of the actual killings and the audio recording of Mr. Smith's interview immediately after his arrest ... pretty much convinced me that we were dealing with a deranged individual."&lt;ref name=juror&gt;{{cite news|title=Court releases recording of Byron Smith gunning down teens|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/02/byron-smith-audio_n_5255546.html|work=Associated Press|agency=The Huffington Post|publisher=© TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc.|date=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law==
Under Minnesota state statute, "...[R]easonable force may be used upon or toward the person of another without the other's consent when the following circumstances exist or the actor reasonably believes them to exist...when used by any person in lawful possession of real or personal property...in resisting...unlawful interference with such property...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=609.06 - 2015 Authorized Use Of Force|url=https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=609.06|website=www.revisor.mn.gov|publisher=Revisor of Statutes, State of Minnesota.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another state statute states: "The intentional taking of the life of another is not authorized..., except when necessary in resisting or preventing an offense which the actor reasonably believes exposes the actor or another to great bodily harm or death, or preventing the commission of a felony in the actor's place of abode." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=609.065 - 2015 Justifiable Taking Of Life|url=https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=609.065|website=www.revisor.mn.gov|publisher=Revisor of Statutes, State of Minnesota}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Admiralty law}}
The '''Carriage of Goods By Sea Act 1992''' is a [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[Act of Parliament|Statute]] that repeals the [[Bills of Lading Act 1855]] and makes new provisions.

==Background to the Act==
The Bills of Lading Act 1855 was commendably brief and proved useful, but as time went by certain defects became apparent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/lqr6&amp;div=36&amp;id=&amp;page= |title=On Some Defects in the Bills of Lading Act 1855 6 Law Quarterly Review 1890 |website=Heinonline.org |date= |accessdate=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The English courts devised some ways round the problem: in ''[[Brandt v Liverpool]]'' 1924 &lt;ref&gt;[1924] 1 KB 575&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brandt v Liverpool, Brazil and River Plate Steam Navigation Co. Ltd&lt;/ref&gt; the concept of implied contracts was developed.  Nevertheless, there were difficulties relating to passing of property and passing of risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ieD5nT0ndHcC&amp;pg=PA380&amp;lpg=PA380&amp;dq=brandt+v+liverpool&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=k3jEh0TXOY&amp;sig=H-6rwaWdS2fqnNOKQdApnR0-pt4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj7ivPYpvjNAhWhAcAKHYPsBy8Q6AEIPTAF#v=onepage&amp;q=brandt%20v%20liverpool&amp;f=false |title=Clive M. Schmitthoff's Select Essays on International Trade Law |author=Clive Maximilian Schmitthoff |page=380 |website=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Law Commission]] and the [[Scottish Law Commission]] addressed the issue in a report, "Rights of Suit in respect of Carriage of Goods by Sea".&lt;ref&gt;LAW COM No. 196 &amp; SCOT LAW COM No. 130&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rights-of-suit-in-respect-of-carriage-of-goods-by-sea-date |title=Rights of suit in respect of carriage of goods by sea - Publications |website=Gov.uk |date=1991-03-20 |accessdate=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160918064449/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/228559/0250.pdf] &lt;/ref&gt; The Report contained a draft [[Bill (law)|bill]] which Parliament adopted in full without amendment.&lt;ref&gt;Except that, for obvious reasons, the proposed short title was changed from "Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1991'' to " ~~~ 1992"&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Act's provisions==
The statute makes provision for Bills of Lading and other documents of carriage, as follows:
*s.1:	The CoGSA 1992 now applies to: [[bill of lading|bills of lading]],  sea waybills, and ship's delivery orders. A bill of lading must be [[Negotiable instrument|negotiable]], and includes a "received for shipment" bill.
*s.1 also empowers the Minister to make regulatory provision (by way of a [[Statutory Instrument]]) in respect of electronic transactions and electronic bills of lading.
*s.2:	A person who becomes the lawful holder of a bill of lading (or sea waybill, or delivery order)  shall have transferred to and vested in him all rights of suit under the contract of carriage as if he had been a party to the contract.
*s.3:	Where such a person (s.2) takes or demands delivery of the goods (or makes a cargo claim), that person becomes subject to the same liabilities under that contract as if he had been a party to that contract.
*s.4:	A bill of lading which represents goods to have been shipped, and which is signed by the ship’s master or his agent is '''conclusive''' evidence of receipt for shipment.
*(s.4 quashes the rule in ''[[Grant v Norway]]'' 1851).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maritimelawdigital.com/uploads/HTML/Grant_Norway_1851.htm |title=Grant v Norway |website=Maritimelawdigital.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pntodd.users.netlink.co.uk/cases/cases_g/grant_n.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060517174039/http://pntodd.users.netlink.co.uk/cases/cases_g/grant_n.htm |archivedate=17 May 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bills of Lading==
{{main|Bill of lading}}
A [[bill of lading]] serves three main functions: 
*  it is a conclusive receipt, i.e. an acknowledgement that the goods have been loaded; 
* it contains or evidences the terms of the contract of carriage; and 
* it serves as a document of title to the goods, subject to the ''[[nemo dat quod non habet]]'' rule.

Although the term "bill of lading" is well known and well understood, it may become obsolete.  Articles 1:15 &amp; 1:16 of the [[Rotterdam Rules]] create the new term "transport document"; but (assuming the Rules come into force) it remains to be seen whether shippers, carriers and "maritime performing parties" (another new Rotterdam Rules coinage) will abandon the long-established and familiar term, "bill of lading".

== The Carriage of Goods By Sea Act 1971 ==
The [[Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1971]] incorporates the [[Hague-Visby Rules]] into English Law.  These rules require (where the Article X invokes the Rules) that, on demand, the carrier must provide the shipper with a bill of lading that meets the requiirements of Article III.  Although CoGSA 1992 cannot amend the Hague-Visby Rules, which are an [[Public international law|International Convention]], s.4 of the 1992 Act (above) upgrades the status of a bill of lading to be conclusive evidence of receipt for shipment.

The '''Columbia River Treaty''' is a 1964 agreement between [[Canada]] and the [[United States]] on the development and operation of dams in the upper [[Columbia River]] basin for power and flood control benefits in both countries. Four dams were constructed under this treaty: three in [[British Columbia]], Canada ([[Duncan Dam]], [[Mica Dam]], [[Keenleyside Dam]]) and one in [[Montana]] in the United States ([[Libby Dam]]). The treaty provided for the sharing with Canada of one-half of the downstream U.S. power and flood benefits, and allows the operation of Treaty storage for other benefits. The long-term impacts of the treaty have been mixed: while the dams have provided enormous economic benefits to British Columbia and the U.S. Pacific Northwest through hydroelectric generation and flood control, there are longstanding concerns regarding social and economic impacts to the local communities, and the environmental effects associated with the construction and operation of large dams.

==Background==
In 1944, the Canadian and U.S. governments agreed to begin studying the potential for joint development of dams in the Columbia River basin. Planning efforts were slow until a 1948 Columbia River flood caused extensive damage from Trail, British Columbia, to near Astoria, Oregon, completely destroying [[Vanport, Oregon|Vanport]], the second largest city in Oregon. The increased interest in flood protection and the growing need for power development initiated 11 years of discussion and alternative proposals for construction of dams in Canada. In 1959, the governments issued a report that recommended principles for negotiating an agreement and apportioning the costs and benefits. Formal negotiations began in February 1960 and the Treaty was signed 17 January 1961 by Prime Minister Diefenbaker and President Eisenhower.&lt;ref&gt;"Columbia River Treaty Signed: U.S., Canada Pledge Resource Development", ''Fairbanks'' (Alaska) ''Daily News-Miner''. 17 January 1961. Page A1.&lt;/ref&gt; The treaty was not implemented, however, until over three years later due to difficulties in creating arrangements for funding the construction of the Canadian dams and marketing the electrical power owed to Canada which was surplus to Canadian needs during the early treaty years.  A Treaty Protocol and a Canada-B.C. agreement were signed in January 1964 that limited and clarified many treaty provisions, defined rights and obligations between the British Columbia and Canadian governments, and allowed for the sale of the Canadian Entitlement to downstream U.S. power authorities [[Bonneville Power Authority|(BPA)]].  Instruments of ratification were exchanged and the treaty was implemented on 16 September 1964.

=== United States ===
Starting in the 1930s, the United States constructed dams on the lower Columbia River for power generation, flood control, channel navigation, and irrigation in Washington as part of the [[Columbia Basin Project]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Stewart|author2=Kathleen Miller |author3=Alan Hamlet |author4=Wendy Avis |title=Climate Change and Resource Management in the Columbia Basin|journal=Water International|year=2000|volume=25|issue=2|pages=253–272 |doi=10.1080/02508060008686827}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dam construction on the American side of the border thus began prior to the entry into force of the Columbia River Treaty. There were various plans put forward in the early 20th century for major dams on the Columbia, many focused on irrigation, but development did not begin in earnest until the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|White|first=Richard|1995|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Great Depression]], the US Federal Government provided the impetus for construction, as part of the [[New Deal]] make-work program.&lt;ref name="white56"&gt;{{harvnb|White|1995|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction on the Bonneville and Grand Coulee Dams began during this period, but government involvement in Columbia dam construction has continued through to the present.&lt;ref name="white56" /&gt;

The long range plans for American development of the Columbia for hydroelectricity came together in the late 1930s. In 1937, the US Congress passed the Bonneville Power Act, creating the [[Bonneville Power Administration]]. This was a new federal institution meant to build transmission lines and sell the power generated by Bonneville, Grand Coulee and future Columbia Dams.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|White|1995|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; While these projects substantially increased the ability to control floods and generate power, the system was unable to provide full protection or maximize the amount of power generated. American planners realized that the full potential of the river could only be harnessed through transboundary cooperation to create additional storage capacity above the existing lower Columbia complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Swainson|first=Neil|title=Conflict Over the Columbia: The Canadian Background to an Historic Treaty|year=1979|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the storage provided in Canada, water releases could be timed to meet power demand, rather than relying on the snowmelt-determined natural flow rates of the river.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|White|1995|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
In Canada, British Columbia Premier [[W.A.C. Bennett]] and his [[British Columbia Social Credit Party|Social Credit Government]] were responsible for the development of infrastructure throughout the province during the 1950s and 1960s. Bennett was the Canadian force behind the Columbia River Treaty and as a believer in the development of public power, he created and promoted a "Two Rivers Policy".&lt;ref name="Mitchell 1983 page=303"&gt;{{harvnb|Mitchell|1983|page=303}}&lt;/ref&gt; This policy outlined the hydroelectric development of two major rivers within the province of British Columbia: the [[Peace River (Canada)|Peace River]] and the [[Columbia River]]. Bennett wanted to develop the Peace River to fuel northern expansion and development, while using the Columbia River to provide power to growing industries throughout the province.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mitchell|1983|page=297}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Loo, Arrow Lakes"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Loo|first=Tina.|title=PEOPLE IN THE WAY: Modernity, Environment, and Society on the Arrow Lakes|journal=BC Studies|date=Summer 2004|issue=142/143|pages=161–196|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/196909730|accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ongoing negotiations of the Columbia River Treaty provided a unique opportunity for W.A.C. Bennett to fulfil his Two Rivers Policy by working around British Columbia's monetary issues. During the 1950s, the government of British Columbia lacked the funds necessary to develop both the Columbia and Peace rivers and privately owned utility BC Electric was unwilling to pay for hydroelectric development on these rivers. Therefore, the BC Energy Board recommended that hydroelectric development be undertaken as a public venture.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mitchell|1983|page=300}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BC Citizens"&gt;{{cite web|last=BC Citizens Campaign for Public Power|title=BC Hydro|url=http://www.citizensforpublicpower.ca/issues/bc_hydro|accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 August 1961 Bill 5 was proposed to the BC legislature calling for provincial control over BC Electric and creation of the Peace River Power Development Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mitchell|1983|page=305}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month, Bill 5 was passed into law paving the way for the creation of BC Hydro in 1963, completing Bennett's vision of "public power".&lt;ref name="Mitchell 1983 page=303"/&gt; BC Hydro thereafter consisted of BC Electric, the Peace River Power Development Company, and the BC Power Commission. The creation of a government owned power entity allowed Bennett to finance the dams and powerhouses on the Columbia at lower interest rates, thus reducing the cost.&lt;ref name="BC Citizens" /&gt; Next, the BC-Canada Agreement of 8 July 1963 designated BC Hydro as the entity responsible for Canadian dams outlined in the treaty, and annual operations of the treaty.&lt;ref name="Columbia Basin Trust"&gt;{{cite web|last=Columbia Basin Trust|title=Who Implements the Columbia River Treaty?|url=http://www.cbt.org/crt/FAQ.html|accessdate=3 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723000335/http://cbt.org/crt/FAQ.html|archivedate=23 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lastly, Bennett directed the negotiations for a Canadian Entitlement sales agreement which provided the funds to develop both the Columbia and the Peace rivers simultaneously. Since it was illegal for Canada to export power during the 1950s and 1960s{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}, the funds provided by the Columbia River Treaty entitlement were the only affordable way for British Columbia to develop both rivers, thus the Treaty became integral to Bennett's vision of power in British Columbia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mitchell|1983|page=325}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the cash received from the sale of the additional power generation of the Canadian Entitlement (approximately C$274.8 million in Sept. 1964 for the first 30 years) the BC government proceeded to develop power facilities on both the Columbia and Peace Rivers, fulfilling Bennett's 'Two River Policy'.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mitchell|1983|page=323}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mitchell|1983|page=326}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In short, BC pursued the Columbia River Treaty because it provided a unique opportunity for hydroelectric development that otherwise would not have been possible (due to the financial situation of the province during that period). It was the hope that these developments would promote industrial growth within the province and help expand the economy.

Under the terms of the agreement, Canada was required to provide 19.12&amp;nbsp;km³ (15.5 million acre-feet (Maf)) of usable reservoir storage behind three large dams. This was to be accomplished with 1.73&amp;nbsp;km³ (1.4 Maf) provided by [[Duncan Dam]] (1967), 8.76&amp;nbsp;km³ (7.1 Maf) provided by [[Arrow Dam]] (1968) [subsequently renamed the Hugh [[Keenleyside Dam]]], and 8.63&amp;nbsp;km³ (7.0 Maf) provided by [[Mica Dam]] (1973).  The latter dam, however, was built higher than required by the Treaty, and thus provides a total of 14.80&amp;nbsp;km³ (12 Maf) including 6.17&amp;nbsp;km³ (5.0 Maf) of Non Treaty Storage space. Unless otherwise agreed, the three Canadian Treaty projects are required to operate for flood protection and increased power generation at-site and downstream in both Canada and the United States, although the allocation of water storage operations among the three projects is at Canadian discretion. The downstream power and flood control benefits in the United States created by the operation of Canada's Treaty reservoirs are shared by the two countries in accordance with Treaty provisions.

The Treaty also allowed the U.S. to build the [[Libby Dam]] on the [[Kootenai River]] in [[Montana]] which provides a further 6.14&amp;nbsp;km³ (4.98 Maf) of active storage in the Koocanusa reservoir.  Although the name sounds like it might be of aboriginal origins, it is actually a concatenation of the first three letters from '''Koo'''tenai / '''Koo'''tenay, '''Can'''ada and '''USA''', and was the winning entry in a contest to name the reservoir. Water behind the Libby dam floods back {{convert|42|mi|km}} into Canada, while the water released from the dam returns to Canada just upstream of Kootenay Lake. Libby Dam began operation in March 1972 and is operated for power, flood control, and other benefits at-site and downstream in both Canada and the United States.  The U.S. did not pay Canada for the land submerged by the Libby Dam reservoir and Canada does not pay the U.S. for the resulting power and flood control benefits downstream on the Kootenay River.

With the exception of the Mica Dam, which was designed and constructed with a powerhouse, the Canadian Treaty projects were initially built for the sole purpose of regulating water flow. In 2002, however, a joint venture between the [[Columbia Power Corporation]] and the [[Columbia Basin Trust]] constructed the 185 MW [[Arrow Lakes]] Hydro project in parallel with the Keenleyside Dam near [[Castlegar, British Columbia|Castlegar]], 35 years after the storage dam was originally completed. The Duncan Dam remains a storage project, and has no power generation facilities.

The Canadian and U.S. Entities defined by the Treaty, and appointed by the national governments, manage most of the Treaty required activities. The Canadian Entity is B.C. Hydro and Power Authority, and the U.S. Entity is the Administrator of the Bonneville Power Administration and the Northwestern Division Engineer for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  The Treaty also established a Permanent Engineering Board, consisting of equal members from Canada and the U.S., that reports to both governments annually on Treaty issues, any deviations from the operating plans, and assists the Entities in resolving any disputes.

===Payment for U.S. Benefits===
As payment for the U.S. benefits realized by the Canadian storage operation, the Treaty required the U.S. to: 
# deliver to Canada one-half of the estimated increase in U.S. downstream power benefits, on an ongoing basis (the '''Canadian Entitlement'''), and 
# make a one-time monetary payment as each of the dams were completed for one-half of the value of the estimated future flood damages prevented in the U.S.
The Canadian Entitlement is calculated five years in advance for each operating year using an agreed treaty calculation method, and the amount varies mainly as a function of forecasted power loads, thermal generating resources, and operating procedures.  The method gives Canada a "first-added" storage benefit that ignores U.S. dams built after 1961 (e.g. Libby and Dworshak), limits sales of surplus power to California, and excludes modern fish related constraints at U.S. dams.  Without the first two of these limits, the Canadian Entitlement would be slightly less than one-half current values.  The Canadian Entitlement during the August 2012 through July 2013 operating year is 504.5 average annual [[megawatts]] of energy (reduced by 3.4% for transmission losses, net ≈ 4,269 GWh), shaped hourly at peak rates up to 1321 MW (minus 1.9% for transmission losses, net = 1296 MW). The Canadian Entitlement is marketed by [[Powerex (electricity)]].&lt;ref name=power&gt;{{cite web|last=Powerex|title=Power|url=http://www2.powerex.com/ProductsAndServices/Power.aspx|accessdate=5 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian Entitlement varies from year to year, but is generally in the range of 4,400 GWh per year and about 1,250 MW of capacity.&lt;ref name=hydroreport&gt;{{cite web|last=B.C. Hydro|title=BC Hydro Annual Report 2011|url=http://www.bchydro.com/etc/medialib/internet/documents/annual_report/2011_BCH_AnnualReport.Par.0001.File.2011-BCH-Annual-Report.pdf|accessdate=5 April 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904200237/http://www.bchydro.com/etc/medialib/internet/documents/annual_report/2011_BCH_AnnualReport.Par.0001.File.2011-BCH-Annual-Report.pdf|archivedate=4 September 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Treaty required the U.S. to pay a total of $64.4&amp;nbsp;million {{nowrap|(C$69.6 million)}} for the flood control benefits due to the operation of 8.45 Maf of Canadian storage.  The payment was based on an allocation that:
# gives Canada equal credit to U.S. projects existing in 1961 (better than first added), 
# ignores the flood control benefits provided by Libby and other post-1961 U.S. projects, and 
# also ignores the flood control benefits provided by the Canadian power storage operation that normally drafts far more than the 8.45 Maf flood control obligation.  The estimated annual benefit was capitalized for an up-front payment based on a low U.S. interest rate of 3⅞ percent for the flood damages prevented until September 2024. The U.S. insisted on determining the payment based on benefits until 2024 because the alternative was to construct U.S. dams that would be fully paid for by then.  Canada accepted the calculation method and explained to Parliament that the $64.4&amp;nbsp;million is 24% greater than the value to Canada at 5½% interest of annual payments made in perpetuity.  Absent any new agreements, the U.S. purchase of an annual operation of Canadian storage for flood control will expire in 2024 and be replaced with an option for the U.S. to "Call Upon" Canadian storage for flood control needs that cannot adequately be met by U.S. projects, and the U.S. must pay Canada for operating costs and any economic losses due to requested flood control operations.

===Termination===
The treaty has no end date, but it includes an option for either country to terminate most treaty provisions anytime after 60 years (i.e. 16 September 2024), given at least 10 years advance notice. If the treaty is terminated, several provisions continue including Called Upon flood control, operation and coordination of Libby, and Kootenay River diversion rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Columbia River Treaty 2014/2024 Review Phase 1 Report|url=http://www.em.gov.bc.ca/EPD/ColumbiaRiverTreaty/Documents/BackgrounderJuly29Noon.pdf|accessdate=5 April 2012}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian and US governments are reviewing the treaty before the 2014 opportunity for notice for earliest termination. Options generally fall into three categories:
* Continue the Treaty with the automatic change to called upon flood control, 
* Terminate the treaty (with continued called upon flood control), or 
* Negotiate changes to the treaty that modify the flood control and power obligations and/or create new provisions for other benefits, especially environmental objectives.

There was initial controversy over the Columbia River Treaty when British Columbia refused to give consent to ratify it on the grounds that while the province would be committed to building the three major dams within its borders, it would have no assurance of a purchaser for the Canadian Entitlement which was surplus to the province's needs at the time. The final ratification came in 1964 when a consortium of 37 public and four private utilities in the United States agreed to pay C$274.8 million to purchase the Canadian Entitlement for a period of 30 years from the scheduled completion date of each of the Canadian projects.  British Columbia used these funds, along with the U.S. payment of C$69.6 million for U.S. flood control benefits, to construct the Canadian dams.

In recent years, the Treaty has garnered significant attention, not because of what it contains, but because of what it is lacking. A reflection of the times in which it was negotiated, the Treaty's emphasis is on hydroelectricity and flood control.  The "Assured Operating Plans" that determine the Canadian Entitlement amounts and establish a base operation for Canadian Treaty storage, include little direct treatment of other interests that have grown in importance over the years, such as fish protection, irrigation and other environmental concerns.  However, the Treaty permits the Entities to incorporate a broad range of interests into the "Detailed Operating Plans" that are agreed to immediately prior to the operating year, and which modify the "Assured Operating Plans" to produce results more advantageous to both countries.  For more than 20 years, the "Detailed Operating Plans" have included a growing number of fish-friendly operations designed to address environmental concerns on both sides of the border.

BC Premier [[W.A.C. Bennett]] was a major player in negotiating the treaty and, according to U.S. Senator [[Clarence Dill]], was a tough bargainer. The U.S. paid C$275 million, which accrued to C$458 million after interest. But Bennett's successor [[Dave Barrett]] was skeptical about the deal; he observed that the three dams and associated power lines ultimately cost three times that figure, in addition to other costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Dr. Hugh L. Keenleyside (for whom Keenleyside dam is named) dismissed these claims and other confusion about the Treaty benefits and costs in his 1974 paper "Ten Year Later, The Results of the Columbia River Treaty."  He explained that the original estimate of the cost of the Canadian dams was about C$411 million in 1963 dollars. Actual cost in 1973 dollars was about C$548 million, and this included $50 million in regional improvement beyond replacement of like for like.  This was a 33% increase over ten years, and he noted that during that time the average cost of dams and reservoirs in Canada increased by 80%.  The value of the U.S. power and flood control payments in 1973 dollars, which had increased with interest, was C$479 million; leaving a deficit of C$69 million.  For this cost, B.C. was then able to add a power house at Mica, and later at  Kootenay Canal, Revelstoke and Keenleyside, and construct transmission lines, to delivery power to major load centers far cheaper than alternatives.  Since the end of the 30-year sale of the Canadian Entitlement to the U.S. in March 2003, the U.S. delivery of the Entitlement power to B.C. has been a benefit far greater than the C$5 million per year estimate by the Canadian government in 1964.  The B.C. government reported in Dec. 2012 that the average annual revenue from the Canadian Entitlement power, which is marketed by POWEREX for the Province, over the previous ten years was C$202 million per year.  Those revenues go into the Province's Consolidated Revenue Fund.

===Social Impacts===

====Local====

Various attitudes were generated from local residents who would be affected directly or indirectly by the construction of the Columbia River Treaty dams. [[BC Hydro]] had to relocate and compensate for peoples loss of land, and homes. In [[Arrow Lakes|Arrow Lake]] 3,144 properties had to be bought and 1,350 people had to be relocated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stanley|2012|page=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the construction of the [[Duncan Dam]] 39 properties were bought and 30 people moved, subsequently at [[Mica Dam]] 25 properties including trap lines and other economic resourceful lands were bought.&lt;ref name="stan 233"&gt;{{harvnb|Stanley|2012|page=233}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since Arrow Lake had the largest number of people needing to be relocated it generated the most controversy and varying of opinions. People who worked on the dam felt a sense of pride and purpose for being able to provide for their families on a long term basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stanley|2012|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the exclusion of local hearings for the Treaty and the outcome of the Arrow Dam many residents felt powerless in the provinces decision to flood the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stanley|2012|page=231}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In response, the Columbia Basin Trust was established, in part, to address the long term socio-economic impacts in British Columbia that resulted from this flooding.

J.W Wilson who took part in the settlement agreement for BC Hydro noticed that while they looked at the physical value of the resident's houses they were unable to include the losses that went along with living self-sufficiently, which was a lifestyle that would not be possible in a city or urban area.&lt;ref name="Wilson9"&gt;{{harvnb|Wilson|1973|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The kind of wealth that went unnoticed consisted of agriculture, livestock, tourism and lumber. Paying minimal taxes also enabled a self-sufficient lifestyle with little cost.&lt;ref name="Wilson9" /&gt; In addition, from an outsiders perspective it seemed as though BC Hydro was being fair with the resident's settlement prices for their land and homes. However many people thought that the settlement prices from BC Hydro were unfair, but were intimidated and felt powerless to challenge them in court, so they accepted the prices begrudgingly.&lt;ref name="stan 233" /&gt; The residents questioned what benefits the dam would have for them if they were just going to be relocated, and lose money in the long run.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stanley|2012|page=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, BC Hydro built new communities for those living from [[Nakusp]] to Edgewood, as part of the compensation process. These communities came with BC Hydro electricity, running water, telephone services, a school, a church, a park and stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilson|1973|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, building the dam did provide work for many families, and supplied electricity to remote communities that were once out of reach of BC's transmission grid, and dependent on gas and diesel generators.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stanley|2012|page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite receiving physical reimbursement, Wilson argues that the emotional loss of peoples homes and familiar landscape could not be compensated, and increased the physical and psychological stress of relocating their homes and communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilson|1973|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emotional loss was especially difficult for the [[First Nations]] people living around these areas. The [[Sinixt]] people who occupied the Columbia River Valley for thousands of years, lost sacred burial grounds, an extremely devastating experience for their community.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pryce|1999|pages=87–98}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the Sinixt were labeled as officially extinct by the Canadian government in 1953 despite many Sinixt people still being alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pryce|1999|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is questionable the timing of labeling these people extinct, with the quick follow up of signing the Columbia River Treat a few years after. With that in mind [[Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada|Indian Affairs of Canada]] had to power to possibly influence the signing of the dams in particular the Libby and Wardner Dam and potential cost of replacement as well as "rehabilitating Indians".&lt;ref name="Stanley234"&gt;{{harvnb|Stanley|2012|page=234}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the push to assimilate First Nations people into a cash based economy, and no reserves being physically affected by the dams, Indian Affairs had minimal participation and influence.&lt;ref name="Stanley234" /&gt; Once again, like BC Hydro, Indian Affairs disregarded hunting, fishing, gathering, and sacred grounds as having either material, emotional or spiritual significance to First Nations people.&lt;ref name="Stanley234" /&gt;

====Provincial====

The objective of the [[International Joint Commission]] (IJC), with regard to the development of the [[Columbia River Drainage Basin|Columbia River Basin]], was to accomplish with the Columbia River Treaty (CRT) what would not have been possible through either British Columbia or the U.S. operating individually.&lt;ref name="krut"&gt;{{cite book|last=Krutilla|first=John V.|authorlink=John V. Krutilla|title=The Columbia River Treaty: The Economics of an International River Basin Development|year=1967|publisher=Published for Resources for the Future by Johns Hopkins Press|location=Baltimore, MD|pages=191–204}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was expected that either additional costs would have been avoided or additional benefits gained by the cooperation between BC/Canada and the US.&lt;ref name="krut" /&gt; However, many felt that such expectations were left unrealized by the effects of the actual treaty.  Soon after the treaty came into effect, it became apparent that greater combined returns had not necessarily been achieved than had each country continued operating independently.&lt;ref name="krut" /&gt;  Others dispute that idea.

Over the lifespan of the treaty, both positive and negative impacts have been felt by the province of [[British Columbia]] (BC).  For BC, the positive impacts of the treaty have included both direct and indirect economic and social benefits.&lt;ref name="CRT History"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Columbia River Treaty|url=http://www.empr.gov.bc.ca/EAED/EPB/Documents/History%20ofColumbiaRiverNov139web).pdf|publisher=Columbia Basin Trust|accessdate=19 March 2012|year=2008–2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Direct benefits came in the form of better flood protection, increased power generation at both new and existing facilities, assured winter flows (for power) and the Canadian Entitlement power currently owed to BC by the U.S. (valued at approximately $300 million annually).&lt;ref name="CRT History" /&gt; At the beginning of the treaty, the province received lump sum payments from the U.S. for the sale of the Canadian Entitlement for 30 years and for the provision of 60 years of assured flood protection to the Northwestern States.&lt;ref name="CRT History" /&gt; Indirect benefits to the province have included the creation of employment opportunities for several thousand people in the construction and operation of dams as well as lower power rates for customers in both BC and the Northwestern U.S.&lt;ref name="CRT History" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CRT Overview"&gt;{{cite web|title=An Overview: Columbia River Treaty|url=http://www.cbt.org/crt/assets/pdfs/CRTbrochure.pdf|publisher=Columbia Basin Trust|accessdate=19 March 2012|year=2008–2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114025750/http://www.cbt.org/crt/assets/pdfs/CRTbrochure.pdf|archivedate=14 November 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, many later developments in BC were made possible by the CRT because of water regulation provided by upstream storage.&lt;ref name="CRT History" /&gt; The [[Kootenay Canal#Canal plant agreement|Kootenay Canal Plant]] (1975), [[Revelstoke Dam]] (1984), [[Arrow Lakes Generating Station|185 MW Arrow Lakes Generating Station]] and the [[Brilliant Dam|Brilliant Expansion Project]] are examples of these developments.&lt;ref name="CRT History" /&gt;  Another project made possible in part by the CRT was the [[Pacific DC Intertie]], which was constructed in the U.S. and to this day remains a key part of the western power grid, facilitating easy trading of power between all parts of western Canada and the western U.S.&lt;ref name="CRT History" /&gt;

However, for the province of BC, the impacts of the CRT were not entirely positive.  By 1974, only ten years after the signing of the treaty, professors, politicians and experts across BC were divided on how beneficial it was to the province.  Many said that the terms of the treaty would never have been accepted in their present day.&lt;ref name= "poole"&gt;{{cite video |people=Poole, Mike (Director)|year=1974|title=Sunday Best: The Columbia River Treaty|format=Documentary|medium=Film|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|location=British Columbia|accessdate=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The negative impacts of the CRT have affected both the economy and the environment of BC.&lt;ref name="poole" /&gt;  Treaty revenue from U.S. was used to pay in part for the construction of the [[Duncan Dam|Duncan]], [[Keenleyside Dam|Keenleyside]] and [[Mica Dam|Mica]] dams, but the cost to BC to build the three dams exceeded the revenue initially received from the sale of downstream power and flood control benefits.&lt;ref name="poole" /&gt;  The province also had to pay for improved highway, bridges, railway relocation, as well as welfare increases for the people affected by installation of the dams.&lt;ref name="poole" /&gt;  Because of this deficit, it is alleged that school and hospital construction suffered, and services such as the Forest Service, highways and water resources were secretly tapped for funds.&lt;ref name="poole" /&gt;

It has become obvious, in retrospect, that the 30 year sale of the [[Columbia River Treaty#Canadian Entitlement|Canadian Entitlement]] was under estimated at the time of the treaty signing.&lt;ref name="poole" /&gt;  [[W.A.C. Bennett]]'s administration has often been criticized for being short-sighted in initial negotiations, but it was difficult to accurately value these agreements at the time.&lt;ref name="poole" /&gt;  In 1960, Columbia River power produced half a million tons of aluminum for the U.S.  By 1974, treaty power had increased this production threefold, hurting BC's own aluminum production, effectively exporting thousands of jobs in this industry.&lt;ref name="poole" /&gt;  Further negative impacts include the flooding of approximately 600&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of fertile and productive valley bottoms to fill the [[Arrow Lakes]], [[Duncan Lake (British Columbia)|Duncan]], [[Kinbasket Lake|Kinbasket]] and [[Lake Koocanusa|Koocanusa]] reservoirs.&lt;ref name="CRT Overview" /&gt; No assessment of the value of flooded forest land was ever made; land which could have produced valuable timber for the BC economy.&lt;ref name="poole" /&gt;

=== Environmental Impacts ===

====Canada====
[[Image:Pacific Northwest River System.png|thumb|left|250px]]
The Columbia River has the greatest annual drainage as compared to all other rivers along the Pacific coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Parr|2010|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the introduction of dams on the river, the changes in water level rose and fell predictably with the seasons and a nine-meter displacement existed between the spring snowmelt highs and fall lows.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Parr|2010|page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the dams were built, the river flows changed and in some areas the previous maximum and minimum water levels were altered by several tens of meters.&lt;ref name="par124"&gt;{{harvnb|Parr|2010|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; High spring-summer flows were reduced, and fall-winter flows were increased to satisfy United States power demands.  After the damming, the water during high floods began to cover much of the valley's arable land - and when it was drawn down to produce power it carried away fertile soil, leaving agricultural land useless.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Parr|2010|pages=104, 132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, it is estimated that the habitat of 8,000 deer, 600 elk, 1,500 moose, 2,000 black bears, 70,000 ducks and geese was flooded due to the creation of the reservoirs.&lt;ref name="poole" /&gt;

The introduction of a dam affects every living thing in the surrounding area, both up and downstream.&lt;ref name="stan192"&gt;{{harvnb|Stanley|2011|page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upstream change is obvious as water levels rise and submerge nesting grounds and migration routes for water fowl.&lt;ref name="stan192" /&gt; As water levels in storage reservoirs change throughout the year, aquatic habitat and food source availability become unreliable.&lt;ref name="stan192" /&gt; Plankton, a main staple of salmon and trout's diet, is especially sensitive to changes in water level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waterfield|first=Donald|title=Continental Waterboy|year=1970|publisher=Clarke, Irwin &amp; Company|location=Toronto|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nutrient rich sediment, that would previously have flowed downstream, becomes trapped in the reservoirs above dams, resulting in changes in water properties and temperatures on either side of the barrier.&lt;ref name="stan192" /&gt; A difference in water temperature of 9 degrees Celsius was once measured between the Columbia and its tributary the Snake River.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stanley|2011|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; When silt settles to the bottom of the river or reservoir it covers rocks, ruins spawning grounds and eliminates all hiding place for smaller fish to escape from predators.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stanley|2011|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alteration in water quality, such as acidity or gas saturation, may not be visually dramatic, but can be deadly to certain types of aquatic life.&lt;ref name="stan192" /&gt; The Columbia River, with its series of dams and reservoirs, is influenced by a complex combination of these effects, making it difficult to predict or understand exactly how the animal populations will react.

Salmon and Steelhead trout travel from the ocean upriver to various spawning grounds. The construction of multiple dams on the Columbia threatened this fishery as the fish struggled to complete the migration upstream.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stanley|2011|page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; All dams on the Columbia River downstream of Chief Joseph have fish ladders installed, from Wells to Bonneville Dam.

Migration downriver is also problematic after dams are built. Pre-dam currents on the Columbia efficiently carried fry to the ocean, but the introduction of dams and reservoirs changed the flow of the river, forcing the young fish to exert much more energy to swim through slack waters. In addition, many fish are killed by the dam turbines as they try to swim further downstream.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bullard|1968|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear exactly how many fish are killed in the turbines, but old estimates range between 8-12% per dam. If a fish hatches high upstream they will have to swim through multiple dams, leading to possible cumulative losses of over 50-80% of the migrating fry.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bullard|1968|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts to make turbines safer for fish to pass through have significantly reduced fish loses to near pre-dam levels. While hatcheries appear to be quite successful for some species of fish, their efforts to increase fish populations will not be effective until up and downstream migration is improved. There is no one solution to improving the salmon and trout populations on the Columbia as it is the cumulative effects of the dams, slack-water reservoirs, loss of habitat, pollution, and overfishing that are killing the fish.
From 1965 to 1969, 27, 312 acres were logged along the Columbia River to remove timber from the new flood plain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stanley|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The slashing of vegetation along the shoreline weakened soil stability and made the land susceptible to wind erosion, creating sandstorms. Conversely, in wet periods, the cleared areas turned into vast mud flats.&lt;ref name="stan192" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Parr|2010|page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1940s, the BC Fish and Wildlife Branch began studying the impacts the dams were having on the area's animal inhabitants. Their findings resulted in a small sum being designated for further research and harm mitigation.&lt;ref name="stan192" /&gt; Their work, in collaboration with local conservation groups, became focused on preserving Kokanee stock jeopardized by the Duncan Dam which ruined kilometers of spawning grounds key to Kokanee, Bull Trout, and Rainbow Trout survival.&lt;ref name="stan192" /&gt;&lt;ref name="spawn"&gt;{{cite web|title=Spawning Channels|url=http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/kootenay/fsh/main/spawning.htm|publisher=BC Ministry of Environment|accessdate=27 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110829025847/http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/kootenay/fsh/main/spawning.htm|archivedate=29 August 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Rainbow and Bull Trout feed on Kokanee, it was essential Kokanee stock remained strong.&lt;ref name="spawn" /&gt; As a result, BC Hydro funded the construction of Meadow Creek Spawning Channel in 1967, which is 3.3&amp;nbsp;km (2 miles) long, and at the time was longest human-made spawning ground and first made for fresh water sport fish.&lt;ref name="stan192" /&gt;&lt;ref name="spawn" /&gt; The channel supports 250,000 spawning Kokanee every year, resulting in 10-15 million fry, with the mean egg to fry survival rate at around 45%.&lt;ref name="spawn" /&gt; BC Hydro has also provided some funding to Creston Valley Wildlife Management Area to help alleviate damage done by Duncan Dam to surrounding habitats.&lt;ref name="Masters"&gt;{{cite web|last=Masters|first=Sally|title=BC Hydro Supports Creston Valley Wildlife Management Area|url=http://www.el.bchydro.com/mediabulletins/bulletin/community/creston_valley_wildlife_support|publisher=BC Hydro|accessdate=27 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207094918/http://www.el.bchydro.com/mediabulletins/bulletin/community/creston_valley_wildlife_support|archivedate=7 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area is a seasonal home to many unique bird species, such as Tundra Swans, Greater White-Fronted Geese and many birds of prey.&lt;ref name="Masters" /&gt; Such species are sensitive to changes in the river as they rely on it for food and their nesting grounds are typically found quite close to the water. BC Hydro, in partnership with the Province of BC and Fisheries and Oceans Canada, has also been contributing to the Columbia Basin Fish and Wildlife Compensation Program since 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fish and Wildlife Compensation Program|url=http://www.bchydro.com/about/our_commitment/compensation_programs.html|publisher=BC Hydro|accessdate=27 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330030420/http://www.bchydro.com/about/our_commitment/compensation_programs.html|archivedate=30 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====

Unlike the Columbia's Canadian reach, the US portion of the river had already been heavily developed by the time the treaty entered into force. Because the US role in the agreement was largely to supply power generating capacity, and that capacity was already in place, it was not obligated to construct any new dams. While in the Upper Columbia, treaty dams meant the filling of large reservoirs, submerging large tracts of land, on the Lower Columbia no new dams had to be built. The local effects of dam construction were limited to those of the [[Libby Dam]] in Montana. The US was authorized to build this optional dam on the Kootenay River, a tributary of the Columbia. Lake Koocanusa, Libby Dam's reservoir, extends some distance into Canada.

Because this project involved a transboundary reservoir, it was slow to move from planning to construction. By 1966, when construction began, the environmental movement had begun to have some political currency. Environmental impact assessments found that this dam would be deleterious to a variety of large game animals, including big-horned sheep and elk. While the Libby Dam opened the possibilities of downstream irrigation, scientists determined that it would also destroy valuable wetland ecosystems and alter the river hydrology throughout the area of its extent, in the reservoir and far downstream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Van Huizen|first=Phil|title=Building a Green Dam: Environmental Modernism and the Canadian-American Libby Dam Project|journal=Pacific Historical Review|date=August 2010|volume=76|issue=3|pages=418–453 [439]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Under pressure from environmental activist groups, the Army Corps of Engineers developed a mitigation plan that represents a major departure from the previous treaty dams. This plan addressed concerns about fish by building hatcheries, acquired land to serve as grazing areas for animals whose normal ranges were submerged, and implemented a technological fix as part of the dam project that enabled control of the temperature of water released from the dam.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Van Huizen|2010|page=444}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The local environmental impact of the Libby Dam was to flood 40,000 acres (around 162 square kilometers), altering downstream and upstream ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Van Huizen|2010|page=452}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the greatest direct environmental effect of the treaty in the United States. While the Libby Dam and Lake Koocanusa were the most visible results of the treaty in the US, there were long-ranging environmental implications of the new management regime. The increased storage capacity in the Upper Columbia dams afforded river managers a much greater degree of control over the river's hydrograph.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cohen|Miller|Hamlet|Avis|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peak flows could now be more dramatically reduced, and low flows bolstered by controlled releases from storage. Peak power demands tend to occur in midwinter and midsummer, so river managers calibrate releases to coincide with periods of high demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cohen|Miller|Hamlet|Avis|2000|page=256}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a dramatic change from the snowmelt-driven summer peak flows of the river prior to its development.

{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2018}}
In the [[United States]] and several other countries, including the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], and [[South Africa]], a '''community court''' is a neighborhood-focused [[Problem-solving courts|problem-solving court]] that applies a problem-solving approach&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courtinnovation.org/_uploads/documents/Principles.pdf|title=Principles of Problem-Solving Justice |publisher=Center for Court Innovation}}&lt;/ref&gt; to local crime and safety concerns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courtinnovation.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=page.viewPage&amp;pageID=570&amp;documentTopicID=17 Community Court | Center for Court Innovation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Community courts can take many forms, but all strive to create new relationships, both within the justice system and with outside stakeholders such as residents, merchants, churches and schools. Community courts emphasize collaboration, crime prevention, and improved outcomes, including lower recidivism and safer communities. Community courts are also sometimes referred to as community or neighborhood justice centers.

In [[Australia]], a '''community court''' is the name given to "indigenous court" proceedings conducted in the [[Magistrates Court of the Northern Territory]]. Australia also has a [http://www.neighbourhoodjustice.vic.gov.au Neighbourhood Justice Centre] in Collingwood, Victoria, based on the U.S.-style community court.

==Community courts in the U.S.==

===Midtown Community Court===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Midtown Community Court facade.jpg|thumb|The Midtown Community Court]] --&gt;
The first community court in the United States was the [[Midtown Community Court]], launched in 1993 in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.courtinnovation.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=Page.ViewPage&amp;PageID=591&amp;currentTopTier2=true |title=Midtown Community Court {{!}} Center for Court Innovation |access-date= 18 November 2008 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080609002527/http://www.courtinnovation.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=Page.ViewPage&amp;PageID=591&amp;currentTopTier2=true |archive-date=9 June 2008 |dead-url= yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The court, which serves the [[Times Square]] neighborhood of Manhattan, targets quality-of-life offenses, such as prostitution, illegal vending, graffiti, shoplifting, farebeating, and vandalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ncjrs.gov/txtfiles/168618.txt |title= Neighborhood Justice at the Midtown Community Court |publisher= National Institute of Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Operated as a public/private partnership among the [http://www.courts.state.ny.us/  New York State Unified Court System], [[New York City]], and the [[Center for Court Innovation]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courtinnovation.org Center for Court Innovation | Research. Development. Justice. Reform&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; the court initially opened as a three-year demonstration project, designed to test the ability of criminal courts to forge closer links with the community and develop a collaborative problem-solving approach to quality-of-life offenses.

The Midtown Court experiment was born of a profound frustration with the conventional response to quality-of-life crime. Supporters of the initiative, which included justice system innovators, business leaders and neighborhood residents, felt that the justice system did not take community concerns seriously. They also felt that a court could use its leverage to more effectively address the causes and conditions that contribute to crime.

Court planners sited the new court in a renovated 1896 building. The building featured clean, bright holding rooms secured with glass panels rather than bars, a pointed contrast to the typical holding pens. The new courthouse also included a full floor of office space for social workers to assist offenders. And the building was wired for an innovative computer system that would allow the judge, attorneys and social service workers to keep in touch with each other and quickly access a defendant's full record.

Offenders at the Midtown Community Court are sentenced to pay back the community through work projects in the neighborhood—caring for street trees, getting rid of graffiti, cleaning subway stations and sorting recycled cans and bottles. At the same time, wherever possible, the court uses its legal leverage to link offenders with social services—drug treatment, health care, education—to help them address their problems. In these ways, the Midtown Community Court seeks to stem the chronic offending that demoralizes law-abiding residents.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of how the court works, see {{cite web|url=http://www.courtinnovation.org/_uploads/documents/How%20it%20works.pdf |title=How It Works: A Summary of Case Flow and Interventions at the Midtown Community Court|publisher=Center for Court Innovation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research conducted by the [[National Center for State Courts]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20060625094626/http://www.ncsconline.org/]  on the implementation and early effects of the Midtown Community Court over its first 18 months found that the project achieved its key operational objectives: to provide speedier justice; to make justice visible in the community where crimes take place; to encourage enforcement of low-level crime; to marshal the energy of local residents, organizations and businesses to collaborate on developing community service and social service projects; and to demonstrate that communities are victimized by quality-of-life offenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/9057026147 |title=Dispensing Justice Locally: The Implementation and Effects of the Midtown Community Court|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The researchers also credited the Midtown Court with changing conventional sentencing practices for low-level offenses, which were typically either sentences of "time served" (i.e., the time spent in jail between arrest and appearing in court) or short-term jail (a month or less). Sentencing at the Midtown Court produced significantly more intermediate sanctions than the city's conventional arraignment court. Intermediate sanctions included immediate assignment to community restitution projects (with offenders often beginning their sentences within 24 hours of their arraignments) to mandatory participation in social services, such as drug treatment or job training.

In addition, the researchers found "substantial evidence" that the Midtown Court contributed to improvements in quality-of-life conditions in Times Square and surrounding neighborhoods. Together, ethnographic observations of local crime and safety "hot spots," interviews with offenders, analysis of arrest data, focus group interviews and interviews with local police, community leaders and residents pointed to substantial reductions in concentrations of prostitution and unlicensed vending. Arrests for prostitution in the Midtown neighborhood dropped by 56 percent over the first 18 months and arrests for unlicensed vending fell by 24 percent, reflecting a visible reduction in criminal activity on the streets. Community members also reported a marked reduction in graffiti along Ninth Avenue, the commercial strip that serves the residential community.

By 1997, the Court was arraigning an average of 65 cases per day for an annual total of over 16,000 cases. This volume made the Midtown Court one of the busiest arraignment courts in the city. In addition, sentenced offenders were performing the equivalent of $175,000 worth of community restitution work per year. The Midtown Court's emphasis on immediacy—offenders must report to the Court's community service or social service center immediately after sentencing—also improved compliance rates. Nearly 75 percent complete their community restitution sentences as mandated, the highest rate in the city.

===Principles of community courts===
According to the [[Center for Court Innovation]], community courts are animated by six key principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courtinnovation.org/_uploads/documents/Communitycourtprinciples.pdf|title=Community Court Principles: A Guide for Planners|publisher=Center for Court Innovation}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are:

*Restoring the community:
*Bridging the gap between communities and courts;
*Knitting together a fractured criminal justice system;
*Helping offenders deal with problems that lead to crime;
*Providing the courts with better information; and
*Building a physical courthouse that reflects these ambitions.

===Research===
By the end of 2010, there had been at least 19 separate evaluations conducted of community courts, including 11 impact studies, nine process evaluations, and three cost-benefit analyses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courtinnovation.org/sites/default/files/documents/Community%20Courts%20Research%20Lit.pdf|title=Community Court: The Research Literature: A Review of Findings|publisher=Center for Court Innovation}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 evaluation of the District of Columbia Superior Court's East of the River Community Court found that the program brought down rates of re-offending among misdemeanor defendants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legaltimes.typepad.com/files/ercc-coverletter-and-evaluationreport.pdf|title=East of the River Community Court Evaluation: Final Report|publisher=Westat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Replication of the community court model===
Over 30 community courts, inspired by the model of the Midtown Community Court,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/bja/183452.pdf|title=Community Courts: An Evolving Model |publisher=U.S. Bureau of Justice Assistance}}&lt;/ref&gt;  are in operation or planning around the U.S. Although different in many ways, the various U.S. community courts all strive to create new relationships, both within the justice system and with outside stakeholders, such as residents, merchants, churches and schools. They also test new and aggressive approaches to public safety.

USA Today reported that interest in community courts was growing, citing new courts in the works in Newark, N.J., among other cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2008-06-09-frequentfliers_N.htm | work=USA Today | title=Alternative courts gain ground for petty criminals | first=Donna | last=Leinwand | date=2008-06-09 | accessdate=2010-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===American-style community courts outside the U.S.===
Interest in the American community court model is also increasing abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courtinnovation.org/sites/default/files/documents/CJ-International.pdf|title=Community Justice Around the Globe: An International Overview |publisher=Crime &amp; Justice International}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A report by the Open Society Institute issued in 2008 found that by the end of 2007, 52 community courts were operational around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;For a comprehensive overview of community courts around the world, see {{cite web|url=http://www.osf.org.za/File_Uploads/docs/community_court_world_text_web.pdf|title=Community Courts Across the Globe: A Survey of Goals, Performance Measures and Operations|publisher=Criminal Justice Initiative of Open Society Foundation for South Africa|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110422215924/http://www.osf.org.za/File_Uploads/docs/community_court_world_text_web.pdf|archivedate=2011-04-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report said an additional 27 new courts were slated to open in coming years.

Based on the success of pilot community court projects in North Liverpool and Salford, in 2006 the British government announced plans to create 11 new community courts, all of which were up and running by early 2008.&lt;ref&gt;For more information about community courts in Great Britain, see the British government's official web site at {{cite web |url=http://www.communityjustice.gov.uk/index.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807120725/http://www.communityjustice.gov.uk/index.htm |archivedate=2008-08-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Seventeen community court projects are already in operation in South Africa. (In South Africa, the term "community court" also refers to a form of tribunal also known as Courts for Chiefs and Headmen; in these courts, an authorised African headman or his deputy may decide cases using indigenous law and custom, brought before him by an African against another African within his area of jurisdiction.)

The Collingwood Neighbourhood Justice Centre opened in Melbourne, Australia, in March 2007.

The Downtown Community Court opened in [[Vancouver, Canada]], in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;For more information about the Vancouver Community Justice Centre, see http://www.criminaljusticereform.gov.bc.ca/en/justice_reform_projects/community_court/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The court addresses the [[Downtown Eastside]] neighborhood. The court seeks both to reduce the harm caused to the community by crime and use collaborative case management to help offenders make long-term changes to their behavior. However, Laura Track, a lawyer and housing campaigner for Vancouver's Pivot Society, says there's a legal log jam ahead unless the government invests millions more in housing and treatment programs. This new court is presided over by Justice Thomas Gove.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20080906/BC_community_court_080906/20080906?hub=TopStories|title=Community court first of its kind in Canada|publisher=CTV News|accessdate=2008-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A community court project is also being planned for Glasgow, Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.journalonline.co.uk/News/1004031.aspx The Journal Online : Community court plans for Glasgow&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Community courts in Australia==
In Australia, the "community court" is not an actual court, but is the commonly referred designation of the [[Court of Summary Jurisdiction of the Northern Territory]] when dealing with indigenous offenders accused of crime. This is to show its distinction from the usual procedures involved in that criminal court. The court commenced as a twelve-month trial in [[Darwin, Australia|Darwin]] and still continues today.&lt;ref&gt;"Recidivism in the Northern Territory: Adult Prisoners Released in 2001-02" http://aic.gov.au/en/events/aic%20upcoming%20events/2005/~/media/conferences/2005-abs/yick.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; At present, the court only sits in Darwin.  However, there is no barrier to the court sitting outside Darwin if the court determines that it is necessary to do so.

The court allows the involvement of the Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities in the sentencing process.  It allows senior members of the local community to be involved in and express their views upon the particular and to be part of the sentencing process.  The Court is conducted in a fairly informal manner and is conducted with a view to enhance the reaching of an agreement between the involved parties as to the most appropriate sentence to impose.  The court is innovative in that it incorporates the victim of the actual crime into the restorative process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nt.gov.au/justice/ntmc/ "NT Magistrates Court website"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jurisdiction===
The establishment of the court differs from other indigenous courts established around Australia.  In [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[Queensland]], each of those States have established separate and distinct courts to deal with indigenous offenders.  Those courts are the [[Koori Court]] and the [[Murri Court]] respectively.  The Community Court is not established as a court in its own right.  The court is actually the Court of Summary Jurisdiction, which is the Territory's main criminal court dealing with summary criminal matters.  Summary criminal matters are generally less serious criminal matters, as serious crime is dealt with the [[Supreme Court of the Northern Territory]].

The court also differs in that it operates under guidelines established by the Chief Magistrate of the Northern Territory. Those guidelines are available on the Magistrates Court website. In other States, similar courts operate under special legislation. In [[New South Wales]], this is the "circle sentencing" legislation which is heard by the [[Local Court of New South Wales]].  However, in practice, these distinctions make little difference to the manner in which each of the courts operate.

Participation in "indigenous courts" is voluntary, and offenders are eligible to participate only if they plead guilty to the offence or offences for which they have been charged.  Participation in the program is available for any type of offence, although sexual assaults and domestic violence offences are usually not dealt with by the court.  While participants in the court are involved in determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed upon an offender, the magistrate has the final say on the sentence imposed.  In an Australian Law Reform Commission report, it was reported that participants in these types of court report higher levels of satisfaction with the system than the usual British based legal proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;"Same Crime, Same Time: Sentencing of Federal Offenders", ALRC Report 103, http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/alrc/publications/reports/103/index.html{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constitution of the court===
As the court is actually a Court of Summary Jurisdiction, the court is constituted by a [[magistrate]].  The magistrate presides, facilitates, and ultimately determines the appropriate sentence for the offender.  The magistrate is assisted by at least one community representative.  The community representative provides the court with information on the background of the offender, as well as being able to point out the aspects of the offence as they relate to the offender, the impacts they have on the community and the effect it has had on the victim of the crime.

The prosecutor continues to present the facts of the case and makes submissions as necessary on the crime.  The offender participates in the process by agreeing to adhere to the community process involved.  Lastly, the victim is encouraged to be part of the process and to outline the impact of the crime upon them.  However, it is not compulsory for the victim to be involved if they do not wish to.

===Procedure===
The court begins with the participants arranged in a circle in the venue.  The presiding magistrate opens the court and explains the process of the court and the role of the various participants in the proceedings.  Each participant introduces themselves, explaining who they, and their relationship to the offender.  
The court clerk reads the charge and the offender reaffirms their earlier guilty plea to the community.  The prosecutor reads out the "fact" of the crime.  This is a narrative of the events that constitute the crime.  This narrative has been agreed to before court as being accurate and a fair representation of what actually occurred.  Each participant is then given an opportunity to speak about the offence.  At the end of this, there may be a general discussion of the impact of the offence.
At the conclusion of this, the offender and the prosecutor make formal submissions to the court about the sentence.  The community representatives then have an opportunity to make comments on those submissions.  Lastly, the presiding magistrate determines the appropriate sentence to impose.

===Appeals===
As the proceedings are actually a case in the Court of Summary Jurisdiction, all the usual appeal processes that apply in that court continue to apply.

{{about|the obligations of individual directors|the official duties of directors|Board of directors}}
'''Directors' duties''' are a series of statutory, common law and equitable obligations owed primarily by members of the [[board of directors]] to the [[corporation]] that employs them. It is a central part of [[corporate law]] and [[corporate governance]]. Directors' duties are analogous to duties owed by trustees to beneficiaries, and by agents to principals.

Among different jurisdictions, a number of similarities between the framework for directors' duties exist.

*directors owe duties to the corporation,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''[[Percival v Wright]]'' [1902] Ch 421&lt;/ref&gt;  and not to individual shareholders,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{cite NZLII |litigants=[[Coleman v. Myers]] |year=1976 |court=NZHC |num=5 |parallelcite=[1977] 2 [[New Zealand Law Reports|NZLR]] 225 |courtname=auto}}, where the board is authorised by the shareholders to negotiate with a takeover bidder. It has been held in New Zealand that "depending upon all the surrounding circumstances and the nature of the responsibility which in a real and practical sense the director has assumed towards the shareholder,"&lt;/ref&gt; employees or creditors outside exceptional circumstances
*directors' core duty is to remain loyal to the company, and avoid conflicts of interest
*directors are expected to display a high standard of care, skill or diligence
*directors are expected to act in [[good faith]] to promote the success of the corporation

== Australia ==

=== General Law ===
Directors have [[Fiduciary]] Duties under general law in Australia. They are:
*Duty to act in good faith and not to act contrary to the interest of the company
*Duty not to use power for an  improper purpose
*Duty to avoid conflicts of interest &lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|36|1984|litigants=Chan v Zacharia |parallelcite=(1984) 154 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 178 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|963|2007|litigants=ASIC v Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Ltd (No 4) |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Duty to retain discretion

===Statutory Duties===
Directors also have duties under [[Corporations Act 2001]]: 
*Section 181: Mirrors the general law duty to act in good faith, in the best interests of the company and for proper purpose.
*Section 182: Duty not to misuse position to gain advantage

===Breach of Duties===
There is an important distinction between the general law and statute in that there are different consequences when it comes for breach
*If a director is acting dishonestly or recklessly then there will be criminal liability imported under statute. But not in general law.
*At general law where a director breaches their duties the likely remedy will be equitable damages or statutory compensation or recission. But within context of statute it is not possible. If it is a statutory duty, ASIC will enforce statute.

===Tripartite Fiduciary Duty===
In Canada, a debate exists on the precise nature of directors' duties following the controversial landmark judgment in ''[[BCE Inc. v. 1976 Debentureholders]]''. This Supreme Court of Canada decision has raised questions as to the nature and extent to which directors owe a duty to non-shareholders. Scholarly literature has defined this as a "tripartite fiduciary duty", composed of (1) an overarching duty to the corporation, which contains two component duties — (2) a duty to protect shareholder interests from harm, and (3) a procedural duty of "fair treatment" for relevant stakeholder interests. This tripartite structure encapsulates the duty of directors to act in the "best interests of the corporation, viewed as a good corporate citizen".&lt;ref&gt;

===Acting within powers===
*s.171 Companies Act 2006

Directors are also strictly charged to exercise their powers only for a proper purpose.  For instance, were a director to issue a large number of new shares, not for the purposes of raising capital but to defeat a potential takeover bid, that would be an improper purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|37|1968|litigants=[[Harlowe's Nominees Pty v. Woodside]] |parallelcite=(1968) 121 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 483 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in many jurisdictions the members of the company are permitted to ratify transactions that would otherwise fall foul of this principle.  It is also largely accepted in most jurisdictions that this principle should be capable of being abrogated in the company's constitution.

Directors must exercise their powers for a proper purpose. While in many instances an improper purpose is readily evident, such as a director looking to feather his or her own nest or divert an investment opportunity to a relative, such breaches usually involve a breach of the director's duty to act in good faith.  Greater difficulties arise where the director, while acting in good faith, is serving a purpose that is not regarded by the law as proper.

The seminal authority in relation to what amounts to a proper purpose is the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]] decision of ''[[Howard Smith Ltd v. Ampol Ltd]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII |litigants=[[Howard Smith Ltd v. Ampol Ltd]] |year=1974 |court=UKPC |num=3 |parallelcite=[1974] {{abbr|AC|Appeal Cases}} 832 |juris=NSW |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The case concerned the power of the directors to issue new [[stock|shares]].&lt;ref&gt;Following ''[[Hogg v. Cramphorn Ltd.]]'' [1967] Ch 254&lt;/ref&gt;  It was alleged that the directors had issued a large number of new shares purely to deprive a particular shareholder of his voting majority. The court rejected an argument that the power to issue shares could only be properly exercised to raise new capital as too narrow, and held that it would be a proper exercise of the director's powers to issue shares to a larger company to ensure the financial stability of the company, or as part of an agreement to exploit mineral rights owned by the company.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Teck Corporation v. Millar]]'' (1972) 33 DLR (3d) 288&lt;/ref&gt;  If so, an incidental result (even desirable) that a shareholder lost his majority, or a takeover bid was defeated would not itself make the share issue improper. But if the sole purpose was to destroy a voting majority, or block a takeover bid, that would be an improper purpose.

Not all jurisdictions recognised the "proper purpose" duty as separate from the "good faith" duty however.&lt;ref&gt;This division was rejected in British Columbia in ''[[Teck Corporation v. Millar]]'' (1972) 33 DLR (3d) 288&lt;/ref&gt;

===Promoting company success===
{{see also|Corporate benefit}}
*s.172 [[Companies Act 2006]], "to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole". It sets out six factors to which a director must have regards in fulfilling the duty to promote success. These are:
* the likely consequences of any decision in the long term
* the interests of the company’s employees
* the need to foster the company’s business relationships with suppliers, customers and others
* the impact of the company’s operations on the community and the environment
* the desirability of the company maintaining a reputation for high standards of business conduct, and
* the need to act fairly as between members of a company

This represents a considerable departure from the traditional notion that directors' duties are owed only to the company. Previously in the United Kingdom, under the [[Companies Act 1985]], protections for non-member stakeholders were considerably more limited (see e.g., s.309, which permitted directors to take into account the interests of employees but that could be enforced only by the shareholders, and not by the employees themselves. The changes have therefore been the subject of some criticism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.altassets.net/features/arc/2006/nz8451.php Director's duties&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Directors must act honestly and in ''bona fide''. The test is a subjective one—the directors must act in "''[[good faith]]'' in what they consider—not what the court may consider—is in the interests of the company..." per Lord Greene MR.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Re Smith &amp; Fawcett Ltd]]'' [1942] Ch 304&lt;/ref&gt; However, the directors may still be held to have failed in this duty where they fail to direct their minds to the question of whether in fact a transaction was in the best interests of the company.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Re W &amp; M Roith Ltd]]'' [1967] 1 WLR 432&lt;/ref&gt;

Difficult questions arise when treating the company too abstractly. For example, it may benefit a corporate group as a whole for a company to guarantee the debts of a "sister" company,&lt;ref&gt;a company with 100% the same shareholder&lt;/ref&gt; even if there is no "benefit" to the company giving the guarantee. Similarly, conceptually at least, there is no benefit to a company in returning profits to shareholders by way of dividend. However, the more pragmatic approach illustrated in the Australian case of ''[[Mills v. Mills]]'' normally prevails:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[directors are] not required by the law to live in an unreal region of detached altruism and to act in the vague mood of ideal abstraction from obvious facts which [sic] must be present to the mind of any honest and intelligent man when he exercises his powers as a director."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|4|1938|litigants=[[Mills v. Mills]] |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1938/4.pdf (1938) 60 CLR 178] |courtname=auto}} at p. 164 per Latham CJ.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*''[[Hutton v. West Cork Railway Co]]'' (1883) 23 Ch D 654, per [[Bowen LJ]],
&lt;blockquote&gt;"money which [sic] is not theirs but the company’s, if they are spending it for the purposes which are reasonably incidental to the carrying on of the business of the company. That is the general doctrine. Bona fides cannot be the sole test, otherwise you might have a lunatic conducting the affairs of the company, and paying away its money with both hands in a manner perfectly bona fide yet perfectly irrational… It is for the directors to judge, provided it is a matter which is reasonably incidental to the carrying on of the business of the company… The law does not say that there are to be no cakes and ale, but there are to be no cakes and ale except such as are required for the benefit of the company."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*''[[Boulting v Association of Cinematograph, Television and Allied Technicians]]'' [1963] 2 QB 606

===Independent judgment===
*s.173 Companies Act 2006

Directors cannot, without the consent of the company, fetter their [[discretion]] in relation to the exercise of their powers, and cannot bind themselves to vote in a particular way at future board meetings.&lt;ref&gt;Although as Gower points out, as well understood as the rule is, there is a paucity of authority on the point. But see ''[[Clark v. Workman]]'' [1920] 1 Ir R 107 and ''[[Dawson International plc v. Coats Paton plc]]'' 1989 SLT 655&lt;/ref&gt;  This is so even if there is no improper motive or purpose, and no personal advantage to the director.

This does not mean, however, that the board cannot agree to the company entering into a contract that binds the company to a certain course, even if certain actions in that course will require further board approval. The company remains bound, but the directors retain the discretion to vote against taking the future actions (although that may involve a breach by the company of the [[contract]] that the board previously approved).

===Care and skill===
{{main|Duty of care (business associations)}}
Traditionally, the level of care and skill a director must demonstrate has been framed largely with reference to the non-executive director. In ''Re City Equitable Fire Insurance Co'' [1925] Ch 407, it was expressed in purely subjective terms, where the court held that:

:"a director need not exhibit in the performance of his duties a greater degree of skill than may reasonably be expected from a person of ''his'' knowledge and experience." (''emphasis'' added)

However, this decision was based firmly in the older notions (see above) that prevailed at the time as to the mode of corporate decision making, and effective control residing in the shareholders; if they elected and put up with an incompetent decision maker, they should not have recourse to complain.

However, a more modern approach has since developed, and in ''[[Dorchester Finance Co Ltd v Stebbing]]'' [1989] BCLC 498 the court held that the rule in ''Equitable Fire'' related only to skill, and not to diligence. With respect to diligence, what was required was:

:"such care as an ordinary man might be expected to take on his own behalf."

This was a dual subjective and objective test, and one deliberately pitched at a higher level.

More recently, it has been suggested that both the tests of skill and diligence should be assessed objectively and subjectively; in the United Kingdom the statutory provisions relating to directors' duties in the new [[Companies Act 2006]] have been codified on this basis.&lt;ref name="NormanGoddard"&gt;''[[Norman v. Theodore Goddard]]'' [1991] BCLC 1027&lt;/ref&gt;

*''[[Re Barings plc (No.5)]]'' [1999] 1 BCLC 433
*''[[Re D’Jan of London Ltd]]'' [1994] 1 BCLC 561

===Loyalty and conflicts of interest===
{{main|Duty of loyalty|Conflict of interest}}
Directors also owe strict duties not to permit any [[conflict of interest]] or conflict with their duty to act in the best interests of the company.  This rule is so strictly enforced that, even where the conflict of interest or conflict of duty is purely hypothetical, the directors can be forced to disgorge all personal gains arising from it.  In ''[[Aberdeen Ry v. Blaikie]]'' (1854) 1 Macq HL 461 [[Robert Rolfe, 1st Baron Cranworth|Lord Cranworth]] stated in his judgment that,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"A corporate body can only act by agents, and it is, of course, the duty of those agents so to act as best to promote the interests of the corporation whose affairs they are conducting.  Such agents have duties to discharge of a fiduciary nature towards their principal.  And it is a rule of universal application that no one, having such duties to discharge, shall be allowed to enter into engagements in which he has, ''or can have'', a personal interest conflicting ''or which possibly may conflict'', with the interests of those whom he is bound to protect... So strictly is this principle adhered to that no question is allowed to be raised as to the fairness or unfairness of the contract entered into..."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*s.175 Companies Act 2006
*''[[Keech v Sandford]]'' (1726) Sel Cas. Ch.61
*''[[Regal (Hastings) Ltd v Gulliver]]'' [1942] All ER 378
*''[[Cook v Deeks]]'' [1916] 1 AC 554
*''[[Industrial Development Consultants Ltd v Cooley]]'' [1972]
*''[[Dorchester Finance Co Ltd v Stebbing]]'' [1989] BCLC 498
*''[[In Plus Group Ltd v Pyke]]''
*''[[Foster Bryant Surveying Ltd v Bryant]]'' [2007] EWCA Civ 200
*''[[O'Donnell v Shanahan]]'' [2009] EWCA Civ 751

As fiduciaries, the directors may not put themselves in a position where their interests and duties conflict with the duties that they owe to the company. The law takes the view that good faith must not only be done, but must be manifestly seen to be done, and zealously patrols the conduct of directors in this regard; and will not allow directors to escape liability by asserting that his decision was in fact well founded. Traditionally, the law has divided conflicts of duty and interest into three sub-categories.

;Transactions with the company
By definition, where a director enters into a transaction with a company, there is a conflict between the director's interest (to do well for himself out of the transaction) and his duty to the company (to ensure that the company gets as much as it can out of the transaction). This rule is so strictly enforced that, even where the [[conflict of interest]] or conflict of duty is purely hypothetical, the directors can be forced to disgorge all personal gains arising from it. In ''[[Aberdeen Ry v. Blaikie]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Aberdeen Ry v. Blaikie]]'' (1854) 1 Macq HL 461&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Rolfe, 1st Baron Cranworth|Lord Cranworth]] stated in his judgment that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"A corporate body can only act by agents, and it is, of course, the duty of those agents so to act as best to promote the interests of the corporation whose affairs they are conducting. Such agents have duties to discharge of a fiduciary nature towards their principal. And it is a rule of universal application that no one, having such duties to discharge, shall be allowed to enter into engagements in which he has, ''or can have'', a personal interest conflicting ''or which possibly may conflict'', with the interests of those whom he is bound to protect... So strictly is this principle adhered to that no question is allowed to be raised as to the fairness or unfairness of the contract entered into..."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, in many jurisdictions the members of the company are permitted to ratify transactions which would otherwise fall foul of this principle. It is also largely accepted in most jurisdictions that this principle should be capable of being abrogated in the company's constitution.

In many countries there is also a statutory duty to declare interests in relation to any transactions, and the director can be fined for failing to make disclosure.&lt;ref&gt;In the United Kingdom, see section 317 of the Companies Act 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

;Use of corporate property, opportunity, or information
Directors must not, without the informed consent of the company, use for their own profit the company's assets, opportunities, or information. This prohibition is much less flexible than the prohibition against the transactions with the company, and attempts to circumvent it using provisions in the articles have met with limited success.

In ''[[Regal (Hastings) v Gulliver|Regal (Hastings) Ltd v Gulliver]]'' [1942] All ER 378 the House of Lords, in upholding what was regarded as a wholly unmeritorious claim by the shareholders,&lt;ref&gt;In summary, the facts were as follows:  Company A owned a cinema, and the directors decided to acquire two other cinemas with a view to selling the entire undertaking as a [[going concern]].  They formed a new company ("Company B") to take the leases of the two new cinemas.  But the lessor insisted on various stipulations, one of which was that Company B had to have a paid up [[share capital]] of not less than £5,000 (a substantial sum at the time).  Company A was unable to subscribe for more than £2,000 in shares, so the directors arranged for the remaining 3,000 shares to be taken by themselves and their friends.  Later, instead of selling the undertaking, they sold all of the shares in both companies and made a substantial profit.  The shareholders of Company A sued asking that directors and their friends to disgorge the profits that they had made in connection with their 3,000 shares in Company B - the very same shares which the shareholders in Company A had been asked to subscribe (through Company A) but refused to do so.&lt;/ref&gt; held that:

:"(i) that what the directors did was so related to the affairs of the company that it can properly be said to have been done in the course of their management and in the utilisation of their opportunities and special knowledge as directors; and (ii) that what they did resulted in profit to themselves."

And accordingly, the directors were required to disgorge the profits that they made, and the shareholders received their windfall.

The decision has been followed in several subsequent cases,&lt;ref&gt;''Industrial Development Consultants v Cooley'' [1972] 1 WLR 443 (corporate information), ''[[Canadian Aero Service v. O'Malley]]'' (1973) 40 DLR (3d) 371 (corporate opportunity) and ''Boardman v Phipps'' [1967] 2 AC 46 (corporate opportunity, which again, the company itself had declined to take up)&lt;/ref&gt; and is now regarded as settled law.

;Competing with the company
Directors cannot, clearly, compete directly with the company without a conflict of interests arising. Similarly, they should not act as directors of competing companies, as their duties to each company would then conflict with each other.

*''[[Hogg v. Cramphorn Ltd.]]'' [1967] Ch 254

===Remedies for breach of duty===
As in most jurisdictions, the law provides for a variety of remedies in the event of a breach by the directors of their duties:
# [[injunction]] or [[declaration (law)|declaration]]
# [[damages]] or compensation
# restoration of the company's property
# [[Rescission (contract law)|rescission]] of the relevant [[contract]]
# [[account of profits]]
# [[Termination of employment#Summary termination|summary dismissal]]

S 176 A Duty not to accept benefits from third parties.

A director must not accept financial or non financial benefits from third parties.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7597">With regard to a [[mobile network operator]] (MNO, or ''operator''), the term dumb pipe, or '''dumb network''', refers to a simple network that, with a high enough bandwidth to transfer bytes between the customer's device and the [[Internet]] without the need to prioritize content, can afford to be completely neutral with regard to the services and applications the customer accesses. The use of the term "dumb" refers to the fact that the network operator does not affect the customer's accessibility of the Internet such as by either limiting the available services or applications to its own proprietary portal (like a [[Closed platform|walled garden]]) or offer additional capabilities and services beyond simple connectivity (like a [[smart pipe]], the term with which it contrasts). A dumb pipe primarily provides simple bandwidth and network speeds greater than the maximum network loads expected thus avoiding the need to discriminate between data types.

Among the commonly understood operational models for a [[mobile network operator|MNO]] are the dumb pipe, the [[smart pipe]], and the [[Closed platform|walled garden]].

==Description==

A dumb network is marked by using intelligent devices (i.e. PCs) at the periphery that make use of a network that does not interfere with or manage an application's operation / communication. The dumb network concept is the natural outcome of the [[end to end principle]]. The [[Internet]] was originally designed to operate as a dumb network.

In some circles the dumb network is regarded as a natural culmination of technological progress in network technology. With the justification that the dumb network uniquely satisfies the requirements of the end to end principle for application creation, supporters see the dumb network as uniquely qualified for this purpose, as – by design – it is not sensitive to the needs of applications. The dumb network model can, in some ways, allow for flexibility and ease of innovation in the development of applications that is not matched by other models.

=== Examples ===
One widely regarded example of the operator "dumb pipe" scenario is [[Apple Inc.|Apple's]] [[iPhone]]. The [[iPhone]] enables its users to directly surf the [[Internet]] with its mobile [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] [[web browser|browser]] and connects to [[Apple Inc.|Apple's]] [[iTunes Store]] for purchasing [[ringtone]]s and [[Mobile music|music]] instead of the operator's own portal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.engadget.com/2007/09/05/apple-adds-iphone-ringtones-to-itunes/ Apple adds iPhone ringtones to iTunes]&lt;/ref&gt; Operators such as [[AT&amp;T Mobility]] cannot offer their traditional services (such as downloads of [[mobile wallpaper|wallpapers]], [[ringtones]], [[mobile game|games]], [[mobile software|applications]], etc.) as [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] controls the total [[iPhone]] user experience. Operators must be content to provide only the network connectivity and bandwidth which the [[iPhone]] has tripled in some cities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shaiberger.com/?p=52 iPhone Triples AT&amp;amp;T's Data Traffic]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to losing valuable revenue opportunities with the customer, operators are rumored to pay [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] a percentage of the customer's monthly bill as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.ft.com/techblog/2007/08/apples-european.html Apple's European iPhone Deals]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2704,2185225,00.asp Inside Apple: An iPhone Invasion]&lt;/ref&gt; While the [[iPhone]] is a good example of the dumb pipe, not everyone believes it will ultimately be bad for operators.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/gadgets/wireless/magazine/16-02/ff_iphone?currentPage=all Wired: How the iPhone Blew Up the Wireless Industry]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of the operator dumb pipe / [[smart pipe]] dilemma is the upcoming deployment of [[WiMAX]] technology. Companies such as [[Sprint Nextel]] and [[Clearwire]] are looking into ways to deploy [[WiMAX]] with additional services to keep them from becoming dumb pipes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fiercebroadbandwireless.com/story/analysys-wimax-carriers-risk-becoming-dumb-pipes/2007-07-16 WiMAX Carriers Risk Becoming Dumb Pipes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719131129/http://www.fiercebroadbandwireless.com/story/analysys-wimax-carriers-risk-becoming-dumb-pipes/2007-07-16 |date=2008-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opinions==

=== Criticism ===

Critics of dumb network architecture posit two arguments in favor of "intelligent" networks. The first, that certain users and transmission needs of certain applications are more important than others and thus should be granted greater network priority or [[quality of service]]. An example is that of real time video applications that are more time sensitive than say, text applications. Thus video transmissions would receive network priority to prevent picture skips, while text transmissions could be delayed without significantly affecting its application performance. The second is that networks should be able to defend against attacks by [[malware]] and other [[Brad Pitt|bad actors]].

The dumb network (and the end to end principle) was conceived of as an antithesis to the idea of a centralized [[intelligent computer network]] in which all applications were under central network control. A synthesis is taking place in the [[context aware network]]s. These networks allow intelligent devices to set up end-to-end applications as in the dumb network. However, they are aware of application needs and in the social and enterprise context in which the applications are being used. Thus the network can make decisions on resource allocation conflicts in light of the collective needs of all users and the purposes (social and enterprise) that guide them.

=== Support ===

Advocates of dumb networks  counter the first argument by pointing out that prioritizing network traffic is very expensive in monetary, technology, and network performance. Dumb networks advocates also consider the real purpose for prioritizing network traffic is to overcome insufficient bandwidth to handle traffic and not a network protocol issue.  The security argument is that malware is an end-to-end problem and thus should be dealt with at the endpoints, and that attempting to adapt the network to counterattacks is both cumbersome and inefficient.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2630">The term '''fact pattern''' indicates a set of facts which entail some legal consequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Translators-Law-Dictionary-English-Francais/dp/1477689915/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8#reader_1477689915|title=Translator's Law Dictionary: English – Deutsch – Francais|last=LL.M|first=Dr Eric Allen Engle|date=2012-06-19|publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform|year=|isbn=9781477689912|location=|pages=20, 101, 133|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fact pattern in turn may be analogized to other similar cases to form a constellation of cases, whether as binding law or merely persuasive evidence of law. The "fact pattern" is the minor premise of a legal syllogism. The major premise of a legal syllogism is a point of law. For example "[[Murder]] is the killing of another human being with [[malice aforethought]] and without [[justification (jurisprudence)|justification]] or [[excuse]]." is a major premise of a legal syllogism. The elements of the crime are killing ([[actus reus]]) and malice aforethought i.e. intentional action ([[mens rea]]). The defenses are a legal justification (e.g. self-defense) or excuse (e.g. no mens rea due to insanity). Note in this example no fact pattern has yet been given. One common example of a relevant fact pattern follows: 

"The defendant did return home, at night and discovered a burglar in their house, armed, and then killed said burglar." 

This is a fact pattern, and the fact pattern is the minor premise of the legal syllogism. The entailed conclusion of the legal syllogism is the judicial decision. 

On these facts it is most likely no murder conviction would obtain as the legal conclusion to the syllogism because of the right to [[self defense]] and the lack of a [[duty to retreat]] in one's own home ("[[castle doctrine]]"). That is, this fact pattern would entail as legal conclusion that the killing was justified and thus no conviction for murder. There was an intentional killing in this hypothetical case, but it was not murder due to the justification of self-defense. Equivalent German legal terms are "Tatbestand" possibly also "Fallkonstellation"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/U-S-Constitutional-German-Speaking-Jurists-ebook/dp/B00G1GU9AI/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8|title=U.S. Constitutional Law for German Speaking Jurists|last=Engle|first=Eric|date=2013-10-19|publisher=Euro-American Law Press|year=|isbn=|location=Berlin|pages=5|language=English with German legal terms}}&lt;/ref&gt; (=case constellation, i.e. a group of cases with similar fact patterns).

The '''Four Fs''' is an informal term and [[mnemonic]] in English [[common law]] for '''fruit, fungi, flowers and foliage'''.

People can gather the Four Fs so long as it is for personal use, and not for sale or commercial gain. This does not mean that people can [[Trespass to land|enter land unlawfully]] to do so, but in areas where they can lawfully be, for example on a country park, or walking along a [[Right-of-way (transportation)|right of way]], they are entitled to collect and take away the Four Fs.

Like most common law this provision does not apply if some other legal provision over-rides it, for example the species in question is specially protected, say by listing in Schedule 8 of the [[Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981]]. The same act also prohibits uprooting of any wild plant without the landowner's permission, so the Four Fs only applies to picking, for example daisies in a public park;  not to digging up, for example, bluebell bulbs or young trees. Another significant exception is that land made accessible through the [[Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000]] is not subject to these rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=J. Wright|title=Hedgerow: River Cottage Handbook|date=2010|publisher=Bloomsbury|isbn=9781408801857|page=26|edition=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This principle was put into statute in the [[Theft Act 1968]] which states: "A person who picks mushrooms growing wild on any land, or who pick flowers, fruit or foliage from a plant growing wild on any land, does not (although not in possession of the land) steal what he picks, unless he does it for reward or for sale or other commercial purpose. (For purposes of this subsection 'mushroom' includes any fungus, and 'plant' includes any shrub or tree.)"

Legal challenges to this right are unusual, and not always successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailypost.co.uk/farming-north-wales/farming-news/2007/09/20/mushroom-pickers-defy-ban-on-estate-55578-19816266/ |title=Mushroom pickers defy ban on estate|accessdate=May 31, 2008 |deadurl=yes |author=Andrew Forgrave|date=20 September 2007|work=Daily Post|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720013302/http://www.dailypost.co.uk/farming-north-wales/farming-news/2007/09/20/mushroom-pickers-defy-ban-on-estate-55578-19816266/ |archivedate=20 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Aida Edemariam]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/nov/25/ruralaffairs.foodanddrink |title=UK's top mushroomer is back in business &amp;#124; UK news |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= |accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''''huissier de justice''''' (literally [[French language|French]] for "justice usher"), sometimes [[anglicization|anglicized]] as '''judicial officer''', is an [[officer of the court]] in [[France]], [[Luxembourg]], [[French Community of Belgium|Belgium]], [[Quebec|Canada]], [[Greece]], [[Italy]], and [[Switzerland]]. The officer is appointed by a [[judge|magistrate of the court]] (or in France, by the Minister of Justice) and holds a monopoly on the service and execution of court decisions and enforceable instruments. Huissiers de justice also serve as formal witnesses to events (''constat d'huissier'') in the manner of a [[notary public]]. 

There is no exactly similar position in the [[English law|English]] or [[American legal system]], but the post is often translated as '''[[bailiff]]''' or '''[[process server]]''' because of the roughly similar function.

As a member of the legal profession, he acts in the [[service of process]], responsible for delivering such documents and authenticating parties to whom they are delivered; proceeds in the enforcement and recovery of any court and legal claims, including [[bankruptcy]], property claims, [[search and seizure|seizures]], and [[eviction]]s; issues court summonses (assignments and quotations); and performs other actions. He may also exercise authorizations of a [[Court of Appeals]], and act in insurance and property actions. He has the monopoly right to call police hearings to guarantee execution of court orders, and to conduct non-monopoly activities such as amicable settlements, draft findings of private deeds, and offer limited legal advice. He also can authenticate character findings which may serve as evidence during litigation. Some elements of his statements cannot be challenged except by way of improbation.

'''International labour law''' is the body of rules spanning [[public international law|public]] and [[private international law]] which concern the rights and duties of employees, employers, [[trade union]]s and governments in regulating the workplace. The [[International Labour Organization]] and the [[World Trade Organization]] have been the main international bodies involved in reform labour markets. The [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[World Bank]] have indirectly driven changes in labour policy by demanding [[structural adjustment]] [[Conditionality|conditions]] for receiving loans or grants. [[Conflict of laws]] issues arise, determined by national courts, when people work in more than one country, and supra-national bodies, particularly in the [[EU law|law]] of the [[European Union]], has a growing body of rules regarding labour rights.

'''International labour standards''' refer to conventions agreed upon by international actors, resulting from a series of value judgments, set forth to protect basic worker rights, enhance workers’ job security, and improve their terms of [[employment]] on a global scale. The intent of such standards, then, is to establish a worldwide minimum level of protection from inhumane labour practices through the adoption and implementation of said measures.  From a theoretical standpoint, it has been maintained, on ethical grounds, that there are certain basic [[human rights]] that are universal to humankind.&lt;ref name="Brown1"&gt;Brown, Drusilla K., Alan V. Deardorff and Robert M. Stern. "International Labour Standards and Trade: A Theoretical Analysis", ''Fair trade and harmonisation: Prerequisites for free trade?'' Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1996. 227–272.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it is the aim of international labour standards to ensure the provision of such rights in the [[workplace]], such as against [[workplace aggression]], [[workplace bullying|bullying]], [[employment discrimination|discrimination]] and [[gender inequality]] on the other hands for [[diversity (business)|working diversity]], [[workplace democracy]] and [[empowerment]].

While the existence of international labour standards does not necessarily imply implementation or enforcement mechanisms, most real world cases have utilised formal treaties and agreements stemming from international institutions.&lt;ref name=Berik2006&gt;Berik, Günseli and Yana Rodgers. 2006. "Asia's race to capture post-MFA markets: a snapshot of labour standards, compliance, and impacts on competitiveness", ''Asian Development Review'' 23(1): 55–86.&lt;/ref&gt; The primary international agency charged with developing working standards is the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO). Established in 1919, the ILO advocates international standards as essential for the eradication of labour conditions involving "injustice, hardship and privation". According to the ILO, international labour standards contribute to the possibility of lasting [[peace]], help to mitigate potentially adverse effects of international [[market competition]] and help the progress of [[international development]].

Implementation, however, is not limited to the ILO nor is it constrained to the legislative model that the ILO represents.  Other alternatives include direct trade sanctions, multilateral enforcement, and voluntary standards. In addition to controversies that arise over each of these models, greater issues have also been raised concerning the debate over the need for international labour standards themselves. However, while critics have arisen, the [[international community]] has largely come to a consensus in favour of basic protection of the world’s labour force from inhumane practices.&lt;ref&gt;Maskus, Keith E. [http://elibrary.worldbank.org/content/workingpaper/10.1596/1813-9450-1817 "Should core labour standards be imposed through international trade policy?"] ''The World Bank: The Policy Working Paper Series'' 1 (1999), accessed March 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Associated with the development of successful international labour standards is proper monitoring and enforcement of labour standards. Most monitoring occurs through the ILO, but domestic agencies and other NGOs also play a role in the successful monitoring of international labour standards.&lt;ref name=ApplyingPromoting /&gt;

==History==
{{main|History of labour law}}
Since the [[industrial revolution]] the labour movement has been concerned how economic [[globalisation]] would weaken the bargaining power of workers, as their employers could move to hire workers abroad without the protection of the labour standards at home. In the Fourth Annual International Congress in 1869, the following was resolved:&lt;ref&gt;K Marx, ''Report of the General Council to the Fourth Annual Congress'' ([http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/iwma/documents/1869/basle-report.htm 1869])&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Cquote|the extension of the principle of free trade, which induces between nations such a competition that the interest of the workman is liable to be lost sight of and sacrificed in the fierce international race between capitalists, demands that such [unions] should be still further extended and made international.}}

=== Early history ===
The concept of protecting workers from the perils of labour environments dates all the way back to 14th-century Europe.&lt;ref name="Brown2"&gt;Brown, Drusilla K. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2696558 "Labour standards: Where do they belong on the international trade agenda?"] ''The Journal of Economic Perspectives'' 15, no. 3 (2001): 89-112, accessed March 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The first example of the modern labor rights movement, though, came in response to the brutal working conditions that accompanied the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]] in the 18th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref name="Brown2"/&gt;  In 1802, the Parliament of the United Kingdom passed what is now known as the [[Factory Acts|English Factory Act]].  The act sought to regulate the workday of apprentices by restricting work hours to 12 per day.&lt;ref name="Brown2"/&gt;  In doing so, the English Factory Act served as a precursor to the models of international labour standards seen today.  Minimal regulations similar to those found in English legislation subsequently became increasingly commonplace among 19th century industrialising nations.  Early attempts at the provision of labour standards were limited in scope, though.  Such conventions focused primarily on improving working conditions in relation to hours of work, women's and [[Child labour|children's labour]], and the use of hazardous materials.&lt;ref name="Brown1"/&gt; While it was evident that support for workers’ rights was inconsistent across international boundaries, activists originally only employed the use of moral suasion to deal with differences in labour standards.  It was not until the latter parts of the 19th century that efforts were made to implement uniform standards on an international scale.&lt;ref name="Brown2"/&gt;

=== Creation of ILO ===
[[File:Flag of ILO.svg|thumb|Flag of ILO]]
In 1919, following the end of the [[World War I|First World War]], the agenda on international labour standards reached a new level of prominence as a result of the founding of the [[International Labour Organization]].&lt;ref name="Brown1"/&gt; As mandated by Part XIII of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], the ILO was created as a branch of the [[League of Nations]] in order to address all conceivable aspects of labour rights.  Preliminary efforts focused primarily on the eradication of slavery and all forms of forced labour.&lt;ref name="Brown1"/&gt; The agenda quickly expanded, however, to include the rights to freedom of association and collective bargaining, non-discrimination in employment, and the elimination of child labour. The ILO’s creation marked the first instance of multiple major international actors coming together in an attempt to reach a consensus on universal workers’ rights. Despite a lack of any formal means of coercion, the ILO then urged its 44 original member countries to adopt and ratify conventions limiting oppressive labour market practices.&lt;ref name="Brown1"/&gt;

=== The early years of the ILO ===
In the first two years of the ILO’s existence, 22 international labour conventions were adopted.&lt;ref name=Origins&gt;{{cite web|title=Origins and History|url=http://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/history/lang--en/index.htm|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the topics that the first conventions addressed were “hours of work in industry, unemployment, maternity protection, night work for women, minimum age, and night work for young persons in industry.”&lt;ref name=Origins/&gt; In 1930, the ILO adopted the first future fundamental convention: the Forced Labour Convention (No.29), which prohibited all forms of forced labour unless exempted by certain conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ILO between the two world wars 1930|url=http://www.ilo.org/public/english/support/lib/century/content/1930.htm|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
With the onset of the [[Great Depression]], the [[United States]] joined the ILO in 1934 noting that complex labour issues would require an international response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brief History and Timeline|url=http://www.ilo.org/washington/ilo-and-the-united-states/brief-history-and-timeline/lang--en/index.htm|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout the history of the [[League of Nations]], the ILO is the only League-affiliated organisation that the United States joined. With the backdrop of World War 2, the ILO broadened its mandate with the [[Declaration of Philadelphia]], signed during the 26th general conference session in 1944. The Declaration of Philadelphia, which is attached to the general constitution of the ILO, foreshadows some of the ILO’s earliest future fundamental conventions including the freedom of expression and association which was adopted in 1948 as Convention 87, Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention.&lt;ref name=Philadelphia&gt;{{cite web|title=Declaration of Philadelphia|url=http://www.ilo.org/public/libdoc/ilo/1944/44B09_10_e_f.pdf|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=C087 - Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87)|url=http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO:12100:P12100_ILO_CODE:C087|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Globalisation and changing divisions of labour ===
In the first half of the 20th century, global [[Division of labour|divisions of labour]] were shaped largely by the practices of [[colonialism]]. Poorer countries exported natural resources to richer countries, which then manufactured and produced specialised goods.&lt;ref name=Kabeer3&gt;Kabeer, Naila. [http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all?content=10.1080/1354570042000198227 "Globalisation, labour standards, and women's rights: dilemmas of collective (in)action in an interdependent world"], ''Feminist Economics'' 10, no. 1 (2004): 3-35, accessed March 18, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; As many colonised nations achieved independence, developing nations in the [[North-South divide|global South]] took on increasingly [[Protectionism|protectionist policies]] in attempts to build up the manufacturing sectors of their economies, thus marking a shift in the global division of labour. However, towards the latter part of the 20th century, a number of factors saw protectionist measures fall. Such factors included rising labour costs in the north, advances in transportation and communication technologies, the liberalisation of trade, and the deregulation of markets.&lt;ref name=Kabeer3/&gt; In the midst of a changing international labour landscape, developing nations in the south took on a previously unseen domination of the labour-intensive manufacturing industry.

With the deregulation of major markets and significant increases in the volume of international trade, attempts to make manufacturing sectors more attractive to retailers saw extreme downward pressure placed on the quality of working conditions in lower income regions of the world.&lt;ref name="Kabeer3" /&gt; This gave rise to growing concerns about a global [[Race to the bottom]], in which governments take part in the iterative loosening of labour protections in attempts to aid the international competitiveness of export-oriented industries. Fears of this nature consequently produced the notable increases in the discourse on international labour ethics that characterise the contemporary [[international human rights law|international human rights]] arena.&lt;ref name="Brown2" /&gt;

== Models ==
The traditional model of labour standards regulation has been, for most of history, within-country or within-jurisdiction legislation and enforcement.&lt;ref name=Block258&gt;Block, Richard N., Karen Roberts, Cynthia Ozeki and Myron J. Roomkin. "Models of international labour standards", ''Industrial Relations'' 40, no. 2 (2001): 258–292.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this model may not be appropriate when competitors in a product market are located in different countries or jurisdictions with dissimilar labour standards. This concern opens up the discussion for the establishment of international labour standards, which, in turn, require international regulation, particularly in the context of global trade. However, determining an effective method of implementation of international labor standards has been an area of difficulty and an area that is highly contested. The following sections outline several existing models for the regulation of international labour standards based largely on work by Richard N. Block, Karen Roberts, Cynthia Ozeki and Myron J. Roomkin in their paper titled "Models of International Labour Standards".&lt;ref name=Block258/&gt;

=== Legislative ===
The legislative model for implementing a set of international labour standards is the best known.&lt;ref name=Block258/&gt; This model involves the enactment and enforcement of labour standards by a legislative body across a union of countries.  Social policies regarding employment and labour typically fall into three areas: free movement of labour, prevention of [[social dumping]] via low labour standards, and dialogue between labour and management.&lt;ref name=Block258/&gt; This model has been adopted by the [[European Community]], part of the [[European Union]], and is also the model taken by the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO). Organisations, such as these, are given the authority, through a series of procedures, to then issue directives in any of these areas of labour policy. Member states must comply with these directives; however, what compliance actually means and entails is left to the discretion of each member state.

=== Direct trade sanctions ===
For over 25 years, there have been links between labour standards and [[international trade]], particularly for specific commodities.&lt;ref name=Berik56/&gt; The earliest and broadest-based example of linking international labour standards with trade is found in U.S. legislation under the [[Trade Act of 1974]], creating the [[Generalized System of Preferences]] (GSP). Under the GSP, the United States was allowed to grant nonreciprocal [[tariff]] preference to less developed countries, based on certain country and product eligibility criteria, in order to promote their economic growth and development. Among the country eligibility criteria is affording workers in a country certain internationally recognized rights, similar to the four core conventions established by the ILO.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. International Trade Commission. 1997. Advice on Providing Additional GSP Benefits for Least Developed Countries. Investigation No. 332-370, Publication 3023, February. At http://www.usitc.go:80/wais/reports/arc/W3023.HTM{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; If a complaint or petition was filed against a GSP beneficiary, these are processed through the [[Office of the United States Trade Representative]]. Since 1988, eight countries have been suspended or terminated from the GSP program: Burma, Liberia, Maldives, Mauritania, Nicaragua, Pakistan (several products), Sudan and Syria.&lt;ref name=Suspended&gt;"Countries Suspended from the GSP Program for Failure to Enforce Internationally Recognised Worker Rights", 1998, Correspondence with Jon Rosenbaum of the Office of the United States Trade Representative.&lt;/ref&gt; Four countries have been suspended but subsequently reinstated: Central African Republic, Chile, Paraguay, and Romania.&lt;ref name=Suspended/&gt; Additionally, Section 2202 of the [[Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988]] requires that the [[Secretary of State]] submit to Congress an annual report on the economic policy and trade practices of each country with which the United States has an economic or trade relationship.

The trade sanctions model in the United States, also working as an incentives approach of sorts, appears to have been successful in forcing U.S. officials to encourage countries that are the subject of complaints to address severe violations of labour standards, as defined in the legislation. This model, however, is not designed to be a broad-based guarantee of labour standards among trading partners because it is based on external complaints not the results of monitoring.&lt;ref name=Berik56/&gt; While it is effective in providing procedural rights, a lower percentage of trading partners provide substantive standards, so this measure has had mixed success. Some hope that implementation in competitor developing countries along with support by complementary domestic policies would allow this model to overall, raise the global [[social floor]].&lt;ref name=Berik56/&gt;

=== Multilateral enforcement ===
Another example of the various methods of implementation of international labour standards is the multilateral enforcement model. The model, embodied in the [[North American Free Trade Agreement|North American Agreement on Labor Cooperation]] (NAALC), is different from other compulsory methods in that it opposes any imposition of common standards schemes.&lt;ref name=Block258/&gt; Instead, the multilateral enforcement model requires that signatories to agreements like the NAALC make firm commitments to existing labor standard structures within their respective domestic spheres.  The unique aspect of the NAALC, however, is that it does not in any way dictate policy.  This includes a strong aversion to uniformly adopted standards on the international level.  Rather than encouraging the inclusion of a baseline set of workers’ rights, the multilateral enforcement model merely requires that its members strive to create unbiased administrative bodies that judge whether or not appropriate measures are being taken to ensure the continued support of domestic labour standards.&lt;ref name=Block258/&gt; In this manner, the multilateral model is not international in its adoption of a common set of principles, but rather in its level of required commitment to an unspecified group of standards.  In enforcing such commitments, agreements like the NAALC primarily utilize recommendations and publicity to make decision makers accountable for their actions.  Multilateral enforcement models like the NAALC have experienced mixed results in terms of effectiveness due to their limited powers of influence.&lt;ref name=Block258/&gt;

=== Voluntary standards ===
The voluntary standards model makes reference to a system of implementation for labour standards based on a corporate [[code of conduct]]. Corporate codes of conduct are adopted when various organizations join together in agreement to operate under a set of socially responsible labour rules. Therefore, this model generally involves voluntary behaviour and self-regulation. An example of voluntary corporate adoption of labour standards is given by the [[Sullivan Principles]] in [[South Africa]] that were taken on by a group of U.S. companies.&lt;ref&gt;Dordrecht, Jan, Karen Paul and Steven D. Lyndenberg. 1992. "Applications of Corporate Social Monitoring Systems", ''Journal of Business Ethics'' 11(1):1-11.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, U.S. apparel retailers, such as [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], the Gap, and Liz Claiborne, have recently attempted to put in place a system of regulations to prevent their products from being produced under [[sweatshop]] conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Paula. 1998a. “U.S. Apparel Industry to Monitor World Shops.” Journal of Commerce, October 19, p. 1A.&lt;/ref&gt;

For this model to be successful, there must be incentive for compliance. The problem, however, is that in the case of labour standards, there are usually high economic incentives to disregard these standards, which are viewed as rises in production costs. For this reason, the monitoring system plays a crucial role in the success and effectiveness of such conditions. In some cases, like the aforementioned [[Sullivan Principles]] in South Africa, monitoring has demonstrated the codes’ success. In this case, investors rewarded adherence to the code, as a sign of [[corporate citizenship]]. On the other hand, consumers can also punish firms they see as socially irresponsible by means of [[boycott]]s or the individual decision to avoid purchase of certain products.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, Richard B. 1994. “A Hard-Headed Look at Labour Standards.” In International Labour Standards and Economic Interdependence, edited by Werner Sengenberger and Duncan Campbell, pp. 79-91. Geneva: ILO&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The main point of these examples being: where there is strong pressure from investors and consumers to support certain standards, companies may benefit by being seen as upholding accepted morals.&lt;ref name=Block258/&gt;

Now, while this is true, it is also true that where costs of complying with stringent standards are high and the sources of consumer pressure diffused, codes are likely to be ineffective.  It takes the active involvement and interest of the company, in response to whatever actions have been taken, for this model to be successful. When they choose to respond to outside pressures, companies use means such as public announcements, local religious leaders, human rights activists, university professors, and labor representatives, among others, to implement compliance and a system of monitoring. Another difficulty has been that, while pressure has been effectively pressed on individual firms, it has been difficult to find agreement at an industry level, in terms of corporate codes.

Finally, a variation of the voluntary standards models is one of certification, which began in October 1997 with the issuance of [[SA8000|SA (Social Accountability) 8000]] by the Council on Economic Priorities Accrediting Agency (CEPAA). [[SA8000]] is an example of a corporate certification process for social responsibility and labor standards.&lt;ref name=Block258/&gt; This certification process has the purpose of identifying corporations that comply with certain criteria based on social accountability requirements, including criteria for [[child labor]] and worker health and safety. The resulting certification then serves the purpose of assuring customers that goods and services provided by certified firms have been produced by workers who are offered labour standards that meet at least a minimally acceptable level.&lt;ref name=Block258/&gt;

==International Labour Organization==
{{Clist global labour}}
{{main|International Labour Organization|List of ILO Conventions}}
The [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) is a specialised agency of the [[United Nations]], consisting of 187 member countries, that deals with labour issues. Following [[World War I]], the [[Treaty of Versailles]] contained the first constitution of a new [[International Labour Organization]] founded on the principle that "labour is not a commodity", and for the reason that "peace can be established only if it is based upon social justice".&lt;ref&gt;[[Treaty of Versailles]] 1919, [[s:Constitution of the International Labour Office|Part XIII]], Section I and art 427&lt;/ref&gt; The primary role of the [[ILO]] has been to coordinate principles of international labour law by issuing Conventions, which codify labour laws on all matters. Members of the ILO can voluntarily adopt and ratify the conventions by enacting the rules in their domestic law. For instance, the first [[Hours of Work (Industry) Convention, 1919]] requires a maximum of a 48-hour week, and has been ratified by 52 out of 185 member states. The UK ultimately refused to ratify the Convention, as did many current EU members states, although the [[Working Time Directive]] adopts its principles, subject to the individual opt-out.&lt;ref&gt;See generally, KD Ewing, ''Britain and the ILO'' (2nd edn IER 1994) 16. Two further general working time conventions are the [[Forty-Hour Week Convention, 1935]] No 51 and the [[Holidays with Pay Convention, 1936]] No 52&lt;/ref&gt; The present constitution of the ILO comes from the [[Declaration of Philadelphia]] 1944, and under the [[Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work]] 1998 classified eight conventions&lt;ref&gt;There are 189 Conventions, however some have been superseded by others. For instance, Conventions Nos 2, 34, 96 and 181 all concern [[private employment agencies]], but only Convention 181 is in force.&lt;/ref&gt; as core. Together these require freedom to join a union, bargain collectively and take action (Conventions Nos [[Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention|87]] and [[Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention|98]]) abolition of forced labour ([[Forced Labour Convention|29]] and [[Abolition of Forced Labour Convention|105]]) abolition labour by children before the end of compulsory school ([[Minimum Age Convention, 1973|138]] and [[Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention|182]]) and no discrimination at work (Nos [[Equal Remuneration Convention|100]] and [[Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention|111]]). Compliance with the core Conventions is obligatory from the fact of membership, even if the country has not ratified the Convention in question. To ensure compliance, the ILO is limited to gathering evidence and reporting on member states' progress, so that publicity will put public and international pressure to reform the laws. Global reports on core standards are produced yearly, while individual reports on countries who have ratified other Conventions are compiled on a bi-annual or perhaps less frequent basis.

The ILO, by its existence, is the recognised international vehicle for raising international labour standards issues in a worldwide forum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilo.org/public/english/standards/relm/country.htm "Alphabetical list of ILO member countries"], ''International Labour Organization'', accessed April 3, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; No other model in existence is capable of performing this role. This organisation establishes labour standards by means of both conventions and recommendations and has a tripartite governing structure – representing government, employers and workers.&lt;ref name=Block258/&gt; While ILO recommendations take more of the role of providing mere guidance to member states, the stronger form, ILO conventions, have the status of a [[treaty]], which, in principle, is binding on the member countries that voluntarily ratify them. These represent benchmarks of strong labour standards towards which countries can strive by promulgating and enforcing national laws that comply with the conventions.&lt;ref name=Berik56&gt;Berik, Günseli and Yana Van der Meulen Rodgers. "Options for enforcing labour standards: Lessons from Bangladesh and Cambodia", ''Journal of International Development'' 22 (2008): 56-85, www.interscience.wiley.com, accessed March 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It is through these means that the organisation works to enforce international labour standards.

In 1998, the ILO [[International Labour Conference]] adopted the “Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work” defining certain rights as “fundamental.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilo.org/declaration/lang--en/index.htm "Declaration: Home page"],  International Labour Organization, accessed April 3, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The Declaration commits member states to respect and promote these main principles, referred to as the core conventions, which are grouped into the following four categories (total of eight ILO conventions): freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to [[collective bargaining]], the elimination of forced or compulsory labour, the abolition of [[child labour]], and the elimination of [[discrimination]] in respect of employment and occupation. The Declaration claims these rights to be universal, applying to all people in all States – regardless of level of economic development.&lt;ref name=Berik56/&gt; The International Labour Conference regards these principles as so important that all member counties are obligated to comply with them, regardless of ratification status.

Alongside the fundamental conventions, the ILO has also identified four priority conventions or governance conventions. Crucial to the running of the international labour standards systems implemented by the ILO, the ILO recommends that member states ratify the following priority conventions: the Labour Inspection Convention (1947), the Labour Inspection (Agriculture) Convention (1969), the Triparte Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention (1976), and the Employment Policy Convention (1964).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conventions and Recommendations|url=http://www.ilo.org/global/standards/introduction-to-international-labour-standards/conventions-and-recommendations/lang--en/index.htm|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Issues with the ILO’s approach to implementing international labour standards come down to a question of universality amongst the conventions and member countries, with some arguing that flexibility is necessary to meet the needs of developing countries. These concerns gather around the idea that the race to expand exports or attract foreign investment can cause competition on the basis of labour costs, leading to a decline in international labour standards as governments either dismantle national laws that protect workers or weaken the enforcement of these laws.&lt;ref name=Berik56/&gt; The underlying issue here is the connection between national incomes and the standards a country can feasibly support while remaining competitive. Other issues involve enforcement of these standards following ratification. The ILO provides a vehicle for investigating cases of noncompliance through representations, filed by employer or worker organisations, or complaints, lodged by another member that also ratified the convention.&lt;ref name=Berik56/&gt; These are then sent to a committee that launches an investigation and report. This is followed by either acceptance of recommendations on steps the government may take to address the complaint or the request to submit the case to the [[International Court of Justice]]. Failure to comply may result in an incurred sanction from the organization. [[File:Peace Palace covered by the first flakes of snow of 2009.jpg|thumb|[[Peace Palace]], the headquarters for the International Court of Justice]]

Overall, the ILO structure essentially created a system of [[voluntary compliance]] with labor standards based on ratification of the established conventions.  In general the enforcement system of representation and complaints has been successful – success being measured by the fact that only one representation or complaint has reached the most severe sanction.&lt;ref name=Berik56/&gt; On the other hand, due to the absence of strong sanctions, the ILO lacks a strong enough deterrent factor for countries inclined to violate the standards the ILO upholds. Further, the “flexibility” of standards allows too much leeway for adaptation based on independent circumstances, diminishing the force of the conventions.

==World Trade Organization==
{{main|Labour standards in the World Trade Organization}}
[[File:Wto logo.svg|thumb|left|As one of the only [[international organisations]] with real enforcement power through trade sanctions, the [[WTO]] has been the target for calls by labour lawyers to incorporate global standards of the [[International Labour Organization]].]]
Because the ILOs enforcement and sanction mechanisms are weak, there has been significant discussion about incorporating [[labour standards in the World Trade Organization]]'s operation, since its formation in 1994. The [[WTO]] oversees, primarily, the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] which is a treaty aimed at reducing customs, tariffs and other barriers to free import and export of goods, services and capital between its 157-member countries. Unlike for the ILO, if the WTO rules on trade are contravened, member states who secure a judgment by the [[Dispute settlement in the World Trade Organization|Dispute Settlement procedures]] (effective a judicial process) may retaliate through trade sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Hughes and Rorden Wilkinson (1998), "International Labour Standards and World Trade: No Role for the World Trade Organization?", New Political Economy, 3: 3, pp. 375-389&lt;/ref&gt; This could include reimposition of targeted tariffs against the non-compliant country. Proponents of an integrated approach have called for a "[[social clause]]" to be inserted into the GATT agreements, for example by amending article XX, which gives an exception to the general trade barrier reduction rules allowing imposition of sanctions for breaches of human rights. An explicit reference to core labour standards could allow action where a WTO member state is found to be in breach of ILO standards. Opponents argue that such an approach could backfire and undermine labour rights, as a country's industries, and therefore its workforce, are necessarily harmed but without any guarantee that labour reform would take place. Furthermore, it was argued in the Singapore Ministerial Declaration 1996 that "the [[comparative advantage]] of countries, particularly low-age developing countries, must in no way be put into question."&lt;ref&gt;Singapore Ministerial Declaration ([http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/minist_e/min96_e/wtodec_e.htm 13 December 1996])&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, it is argued that countries ought to be able to take advantage of low wages and poor conditions at work as a comparative advantage in order to boost their exports. Similarly it is disputed that business will relocate production to low wage countries from higher wage countries such as the UK, because that choice depends mostly on [[productivity]] of workers. The view of many labour lawyers and economists remains that more trade, in the context of weaker bargaining power and mobility for workers, still allows for business to opportunistically take advantage of workers by moving production, and that a coordinated multilateral approach with targeted measures against specific exports is preferable.&lt;ref&gt;See KA Elliott and [[RB Freeman]], ''Can Labor Standards Improve under Globalization?'' (Institute for International Economics 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; While the WTO has yet to incorporate labour rights into its procedures for dispute settlements, many countries began to make bilateral agreements that protected core labour standards instead.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. EU-South Korea Free Trade Agreement (14 May 2011) OJ 2011 L127, article 13&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in domestic tariff regulations not yet touched by the WTO agreements, countries have given preference to other countries who do respect core labour rights, for example under the EU Tariff Preference Regulation, articles 7 and 8.&lt;ref&gt;Tariff Preference Regulation (EC) No 732/2008 arts 7, 8, 15 and Annex II and III&lt;/ref&gt;

==Workers in multiple countries==
{{main|Conflict of laws}}
While the debate over labour standards applied by the ILO and the WTO seeks to balance standards with free movement of capital globally, [[conflicts of laws]] (or [[private international law]]) issues arise where workers move from home to go abroad. If a worker from America performs part of her job in Brazil, China and Denmark (a "peripatetic" worker) or if a worker is engaged in Ecuador to work as an expatriate abroad in France, an employer may seek to characterise the contract of employment as being governed by the law of the country where labour rights are least favourable to the worker, or seek to argue that the most favourable system of labour rights does not apply. For example, in a [[UK labour law]] case, ''[[Ravat v Halliburton Manufacturing and Services Ltd]]''&lt;ref&gt;[2012] UKSC 1&lt;/ref&gt; Mr Ravat was from the UK but was employed in Libya by a German company that was part of the American multinational oil conglomerate, [[Halliburton]]. He was dismissed by a supervisor based in [[Egypt]]. He was told he would be hired under UK law terms and conditions, and this was arranged by a staffing department in Aberdeen. Under the UK [[Employment Rights Act 1996]] he would have a right to unfair dismissal, but the Act left open what the territorial scope of the statute was. The UK Supreme Court held that the principle would be that for an expatriate worker, although the general rule is that they will not have UK labour law rights, there would be an exception if the worker could show a "close connection" to the UK, and this was established through the contractual assurances given to Mr Rabat.&lt;ref&gt;See also ''[[Lawson v Serco Ltd]]'' [2006] UKHL 3 and ''[[Duncombe v Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families]]'' [2011] UKSC 36&lt;/ref&gt;

This fits within the general framework in the EU. Under the EU [[Rome I Regulation]] article 8,&lt;ref&gt;Rome I Regulation (Regulation (EC) No 593/2008&lt;/ref&gt; workers will have employment rights of the country where they habitually work. But exceptionally they may have a claim in another country if they can establish a close connection to it. The Regulation emphasises that the rules should be applied with the purpose of protecting the worker.&lt;ref&gt;See Rome I, recital 23 and Brussels I, recital 13&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also necessary that a court has jurisdiction to hear a claim. Under the [[Brussels I Regulation]] article 19,&lt;ref&gt;Brussels I Regulation (EC) No 44/2001&lt;/ref&gt; this requires the worker habitually works in the place where the claim is brought, or is engaged there.

==European Union law==
{{main|EU law|European labour law|Directive on services in the internal market}}
The [[European Community]] (EC) is a multigovernmental legislative structure that, through the [[Treaty of European Union]] (Maastricht) in 1992, the [[Treaty of Amsterdam]] in 1997, and various other agreements has promoted full economic integration of its member states.&lt;ref name=Springer1994&gt;Springer, Beverly. 1994. ''The European Union and Its Citizens: The Social Agenda'', Westport, CT: Greenwood Press.&lt;/ref&gt; While it has issued a number of directives in non-labour areas, the same cannot be said for matters concerning social policy and labour. However, some restrictions regarding health and safety have been adopted by the EC in an attempt to mitigate any inhumane practices, involving low health and safety standards, used for the sake of a [[competitive advantage]].&lt;ref name=Springer1994/&gt;

The European Union, unlike most international organisations, has an extensive system of labour laws, but officially excluding (according to the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]]) matters around direct wage regulation (e.g. setting a minimum wage), fairness of dismissals (e.g. a requirement for elected workers to approve dismissals) and collective bargaining. A series of Directives regulate almost all other issues, for instance the [[Working Time Directive]] guarantees 28 days of paid holiday, the [[Equality Framework Directive]] prohibits all forms of discrimination for people performing work, and the [[Collective Redundancies Directive]] requires that proper notice is given and consultation takes place before any decisions about economic dismissals are finalised.

However, the [[European Court of Justice]] has recently expanded upon the Treaties through its case law. As well as having legal protection for workers rights, an objective of trade unions has been to organise their members across borders in the same way that [[multinational corporations]] have organised their production globally. In order to meet the balance of power that comes from ability of businesses to dismiss workers or relocate, unions have sought to take collective action and strikes internationally. However, this kind of coordination was recently challenged in the [[European Union]] in two controversial decisions. In ''[[Laval Ltd v Swedish Builders Union]]''&lt;ref&gt;(2008) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:62005J0341:EN:HTML C-319/05]&lt;/ref&gt; a group of Latvian workers were sent to a construction site in Sweden on low pay. The local Swedish Union took industrial action to make Laval Ltd sign up to the local collective agreement. Under the [[Posted Workers Directive]], article 3 lays down minimum standards for workers being posted away from home so that workers always receive at least the minimum rights that they would have at home in case their place of work has lower minimum rights. Article 3(7) goes on to say that this "shall not prevent application of terms and conditions of employment which are more favourable to workers". Most people thought this meant that more favourable conditions could be given than the minimum (e.g. in Latvian law) by the host state's legislation or a collective agreement. However, in an interpretation seen as astonishing by many, the ECJ said that only the posting state could raise standards beyond its minimum for posted workers, and any attempt by the host state, or a collective agreement (unless the collective agreement is declared universal under article 3(8)) would be an infringement of the business' freedom to provide services under [[TFEU]] article 56. This decision was implicitly reversed by the European Union legislature in the [[Rome I Regulation]], which makes clear in recital 34 that the host state may allow more favourable standards. However, in ''[[The Rosella]]'', the ECJ also held that a blockade by the [[International Transport Workers Federation]] against a business that was using an [[Estonia]]n [[flag of convenience]] (i.e. saying it was operating under Estonian law to avoid labour standards of Finland) infringed the business' right of free establishment under [[TFEU]] article 49. The ECJ said that it recognised the workers' "right to strike" in accordance with ILO Convention 87, but said that its use must be proportionately to the right of the business' establishment. The result is that the European Court of Justice's recent decisions create a significant imbalance between the international freedom of business, and that of labour, to bargain and take action to defend their interests.

For those members within the EC who favour the implementation of labour standards, there has been a push to ease the decision-making barriers to social legislation.&lt;ref&gt;Liebfried, Stephan and Paul Pierson (eds.). 1995. "Semisovereign Welfare States: Social Policy in a Multitiered Europe", ''European Social Policy: Between Fragmentation and Integration'', pp. 43-77. Washington: The Brookings Institution.&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 February, 1992, the signing of the [[Maastricht Treaty]] made it easier to pass legislation on less controversial issues, such as health and safety, nondiscrimination, and consultation with workers.&lt;ref&gt;European Union. 1998a. “Glossary: The Reform of the European Union.” At European Union Internet resources: {{cite web |url=http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/GSSI/eu.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030402125359/http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/GSSI/eu.html |archivedate=2003-04-02 |df= }} linked to http://europa.eu.int/en/agenda/igc-home/en/g4000s.htm#s1 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990208203802/http://europa.eu.int/en/agenda/igc-home/en/g4000s.htm#s1#s1 |date=1999-02-08 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the EC provides a structure for enacting legislation that applies across counties, the extent to which it can actually create international labour standards, even within its own confines, is limited.&lt;ref name=Block258/&gt; While these directives allow for labour concerns to be brought above the national level, the presence of philosophical differences among member states as well as constraints on state autonomy demonstrate barriers to this model. However, despite these difficulties and a complex decision-making structure designed to include consultation with the governments of all member states, the various EC policy-making institutions and the related parties have succeeded in creating cross-national legislation for labour standards under its social policy umbrella.&lt;ref name=Block258/&gt; Consequently, this model, as demonstrated by the EC, is a viable one for establishing labour standards on a cross-national basis. The difficulty lies in the duplication of this model elsewhere, due to the EC’s unique, integrated community that is the only such general multinational standard system in the world today.&lt;ref name=Block258/&gt;

== Monitoring ==
A crucial element to the success of international labour standards is proper monitoring and enforcement. When monitoring international labor standards, agencies rely on three major types of information: information from international organisations, like the ILO, information from national agencies, and information from non-governmental organizations.&lt;ref name=NationalAcademiesPress&gt;{{cite book|author=Committee on Monitoring International Labour Standards, Center for Education, Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education, and Policy and Global Affairs|title=Monitoring international labor standards techniques and sources of information|year=2004|publisher=National Academies Press|location=Washington, DC|edition=[Online-Ausg.]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon locating and determining the necessary data, monitoring agencies then need to process and sift through the results to analyze compliance with certain international labor standards. Finally after compliance analysis, recommendations and required adjustments are then communicated to the concerned party.&lt;ref name=NationalAcademiesPress/&gt;

=== Data sources ===
One of the major sources of data necessary for the monitoring of international labour standards is the International Labour Organization. According to Article 22 of the ILO Constitution, “each of the members agrees to make an annual report to the International Labour Office on the measures which it has taken to give effect to the provisions of Conventions to which it is a party.”&lt;ref name=Constitution&gt;{{cite web|title=Constitution of the International Labour Organization|url=http://www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/leg/download/constitution.pdf|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, countries are mandated to prepare a report every two years for the Core Labour Standards of the ILO and every five years for all other active conventions that the country has ratified, which are submitted, to the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations and the Conference Committee on the Application of Standards.&lt;ref name=ExpCommittee&gt;{{cite web|title=Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations|url=http://www.ilo.org/global/standards/applying-and-promoting-international-labour-standards/committee-of-experts-on-the-application-of-conventions-and-recommendations/lang--en/index.htm|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For conventions that have not yet been ratified by the country, Article 19 of the ILO Constitution mandates countries to demonstrate on regular intervals steps “they have taken to give effect to any provision of certain conventions or recommendations, and to indicate any obstacles which have prevented or delayed the ratification of a particular convention.”&lt;ref name=Constitution/&gt; All of the above combine to form the ILO’s regular system of supervision.&lt;ref name=ApplyingPromoting&gt;{{cite web|title=Applying and promoting International Labour Standards|url=http://www.ilo.org/global/standards/applying-and-promoting-international-labour-standards/lang--en/index.htm|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=General Surveys|url=http://www.ilo.org/global/standards/applying-and-promoting-international-labour-standards/general-surveys/lang--en/index.htm|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Flag of the United Nations.svg|thumb|Flag of the United Nations]]
The ILO also has a special procedures type of supervisory mechanism where complaints levelled against member states and freedom of association complaints are dealt with.&lt;ref name=ApplyingPromoting/&gt; Under articles 24 and 26 of the ILO Constitution, different groups of people may indicate to the governing body that a certain state is not complying with an international labor standard that they have previously ratified.&lt;ref name=NationalAcademiesPress/&gt;&lt;ref name=Constitution/&gt; Within the ILO framework, the labor standard regarding the freedom to associate has also received a special priority which allows complaints to be brought up to the governing body even if the state has not ratified the conventions regarding the freedom of association.&lt;ref name=ApplyingPromoting/&gt;

Other international organisations like the [[United Nations]] and the [[World Bank]] also monitor international labour standards.&lt;ref name=NationalAcademiesPress/&gt; The United Nations largely relies on self-reported data from member states. These data points are used to determine whether or not member states are meeting the requirements of international treaties agreed to by the United Nations. Given that the ILO is a subset of the UN, generally, more detailed labour standards data and compliance records are located within the realm of the ILO.&lt;ref name=NationalAcademiesPress/&gt; The World Bank incorporates the international standards set by the ILO as one of the factors behind assistance to member states.

National agencies and NGOs also monitor international labour standards. National agencies generally report on domestic compliance of international labour standards while NGOs are much more diverse in their scope.&lt;ref name=NationalAcademiesPress/&gt;

=== Challenges ===
Several challenges, however, exist in the monitoring of international labour standards. The ILO and other international organisations generally rely on self-reporting data from countries.&lt;ref name=ApplyingPromoting /&gt;&lt;ref name=NationalAcademiesPress /&gt;&lt;ref name=ExpCommittee /&gt; Some analysts have questioned the quality and neutrality of these sources of data. For example, definitions of what constitutes [[unemployment]] vary from country to country making it difficult to compare data and to judge data quality.&lt;ref name=NationalAcademiesPress /&gt;  Additionally, despite the large amount of data, there are still gaps in their coverage. Coverage is greatest in the urban environments and the formal sector. Conversely, gaps exist in the coverage of rural environments and informal sectors which can positively skew the labour statistics that countries report.&lt;ref name=NationalAcademiesPress /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Rigby, Crispin |author=Division of Behavioural and Social Sciences and Education, Policy and Global Affairs Division, National Research Council of the National|title=Monitoring international labour standards international perspectives : summary of regional forums|year=2004|publisher=National Academies Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=0-309-52986-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Challenges also exist in the usage of data to assess compliance with various international labour standards. As interest continues to grow in the monitoring and enforcement of international labour standards, an assessment, according to the National Research Council, “requires careful analysis of what the core labor standards mean and imply, how to determine when a country is or is not in compliance, what indicators of compliance and which sources of information to use, and limitations of the sources of information.”&lt;ref name=NationalAcademiesPress /&gt;  Standardisation will be necessary to allow proper and effective monitoring of labor standards.

=== Workplace discrimination ===
{{See also|Employment Discrimination}}
Workplace discrimination, overt and covert, is an example of violations of international labour standards.  The ILO defines workplace discrimination as “treating people differently because of certain characteristics, such as race, colour, or sex, which results in the impairment of equality and of opportunity and treatment.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Workplace Discrimination|url=http://www.ilo.org/global/topics/equality-and-discrimination/workplace-discrimination/lang--en/index.htm|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=20 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020214812/http://www.ilo.org/global/topics/equality-and-discrimination/workplace-discrimination/lang--en/index.htm|archivedate=20 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An overt example of workplace discrimination is unequal pay, especially between men and women. Though recognized as an example of workplace discrimination since 1919, the [[gender pay gap]], often a measurement of unequal pay, is estimated to be 22.9%, which means that for every dollar earned by a man, a woman, in the same position would earn 77.1 cents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Equal Pay: An Introductory Guide|url=http://www.ilo.org/ilc/ILCSessions/100thSession/reports/reports-submitted/WCMS_154779/lang--en/index.htm|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=20 October 2013|author1=Oelz, Martin  |author2=Olney, Shauna &amp; Tomei, Manuela}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the fact that the ILO proposes that there are many benefits to reducing and eliminating the gender pay gap, at the current, slow rates of gender pay reduction, the ILO estimates that “another 75 years will be needed to bridge this gap.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A New Era of Social Justice|url=http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/@ed_norm/@relconf/documents/meetingdocument/wcms_155656.pdf|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Job security]] is another arena where workplace discrimination can be found. In some developing countries, like Bangladesh, job insecurity reflects patriarchal societies that have diminished women’s options. Currently in Bangladesh, of the 1.8 million workers in garment factories, 1.5 million are women. From the perspective of the factory owners, the advantage of hiring woman is the “docility that comes with disadvantage.”&lt;ref name=Kabeer3 /&gt; Women have fewer opportunities than men when it comes to decent, respectable employment. For many of these women, if they were to lose their jobs at the garment factories, they would be forced into poverty or work in the informal sector, like prostitution.&lt;ref name=Kabeer3 /&gt;

Other forms of discrimination, outside of [[gender discrimination]], include discrimination based on race &amp; ethnicity, age, religion, political opinions, social origins, disabilities, sexual orientations, genetics, and lifestyle. The ILO identifies all these forms of discrimination as violations of international labor standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Equality at work: The continuing challenge|url=http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_norm/---relconf/documents/meetingdocument/wcms_154779.pdf|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Child labour ===
{{Main|Child Labour}}
[[File:Minimum age convention.png|thumb|300px|Parties to ILO's 1973 Minimum Age Convention, and the minimum ages they have designated: purple, 14 years; green, 15 years; blue, 16 years]]
[[File:Mining diggerboys.jpg|thumb|Young diamond miners in Sierra Leone]]
According to the ILO, [[child labor]] is “work that deprives children of their childhood, their potential and their dignity, and that is harmful to physical and mental development.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is child labour|url=http://www.ilo.org/ipec/facts/lang--en/index.htm|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ILO classifies work conducted by children into three categories: children in employment, child labor, and hazardous work. The ILO condemns both child labor and hazardous work with the goal of eliminating hazardous child labor by 2016. In 2012, the ILO estimated that 168 million children (11% of the world’s children) were engaged in child labour, of which, 85 million engaged in hazardous work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Making progress against child labour|url=http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_norm/---ipec/documents/publication/wcms_221513.pdf|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ILO Convention No. 5 adopted in 1919 and entered into force in 1921 was the first ILO convention regulating child labour. Specifically, the main provision of the article stated “children under the age of fourteen years shall not be employed or work in any public or private industrial undertaking.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=C005 - Minimum Age (Industry) Convention, 1919 (No. 5)|url=http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO:12100:P12100_ILO_CODE:C005|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its inception in 1919, several other ILO conventions had been adopted that have modified and expanded the initial 1919 convention. Today, the C138 [[Minimum Age Convention, 1973]] and C182 [[Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention]] 1999 have replaced all the previous conventions. The Minimum Age Convention defines the minimum age children are allowed to work. Children, unless under special allowances, are not allowed to engage in hazardous work until the age of 18. The basic minimum age for child labor is 15 (14 for developing countries), and the minimum wage for light work, which may not interfere with education or vocational orientation and training, is 13 (12 for developing countries).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=C138 - Minimum Age Convention, 1973 (No. 138)|url=http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO:12100:P12100_ILO_CODE:C138|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  C182 urges all governments to take immediate action to identify and eliminate the worst forms of child labour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=C182 - Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999 (No. 182)|url=http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO:12100:P12100_ILO_CODE:C182|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The following are defined as hazardous work according to the ILO:
* “Work which exposes children to physical, psychological, or sexual abuse
*Work underground, underwater, at dangerous heights, or in confined spaces
*Work with dangerous machinery, equipment, and tools, or which involves the manual handling or transport of heavy loads
*Work in an unhealthy environment which may, for example, expose children to hazardous substances, agents, or processes, or to temperatures, noise levels, or vibrations, damaging to their health
*Work under particularly difficult conditions such as work for long hours or during the night or work where the child is unreasonably confined to the premises of the employer” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eliminating the worst forms of child labour: A practical guide to ILO Convention No. 182 - Handbook for parliamentarians No. 3, 2002|url=http://www.ilo.org/pardev/civil-society/parliamentarians/WCMS_172685/lang--en/index.htm|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=20 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020224427/http://www.ilo.org/pardev/civil-society/parliamentarians/WCMS_172685/lang--en/index.htm|archivedate=20 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of UN Member States has ratified both C138 and C182. The [[Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention]] (C182) has been ratified by 177 nations, while 8 countries (Cuba, Eritrea, India, Marshall Islands, Myanmar, Palau, Somalia, Tuvalu) have yet to ratify it. The [[Minimum Age Convention]] (C138) has been ratified by 166 countries, while 19 countries have yet to ratify it.

=== {{anchor|C155|C161|C187}} Unsafe labour practices ===
[[File:Image of Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire on March 25 - 1911.jpg|thumb|Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire on March 25, 1911]]
Operating under the mantra that “decent work is safe work,” the ILO Programme on Safety and Health at Work and the Environment, SafeWork, has the goal of making work safer for all. According to the ILO, someone dies from a work-related accident or disease every 15 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Safety and health at work|url=http://www.ilo.org/global/topics/safety-and-health-at-work/lang--en/index.htm |publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unsafe labour practices have a long, sordid history. From the 1911 [[Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire]] to the 2013 [[West Fertiliser Company Explosion|fertilizer explosion]] in West, Texas, [[industrial disasters]] negatively affect the lives of workers and their dependents with high associated economic costs. Since its creation in 1919, ensuring worker safety has been one of the ILO’s fundamental missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Global strategy on occupational safety and health: Conclusions adopted by the International Labour Conference at its 91st Session, 2003|url=http://www.ilo.org/safework/info/policy-documents/WCMS_107535/lang--en/index.htm|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ILO has over its history adopted several conventions that have the goal of maximising worker safety and health. Currently, there are three fundamental conventions that are in effect: the Occupation Safety and Health Convention (C155, 1981), the Occupational Health Services Convention (C161, 1985), and the Promotional Framework for Occupational Safety and Health Convention (C187, 2006). The most recent convention has the stated aim of “promoting a preventative safety and health culture and progressively achieving a safe and healthy working environment.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Labour Standards on Occupational safety and health|url=http://www.ilo.org/global/standards/subjects-covered-by-international-labour-standards/occupational-safety-and-health/lang--en/index.htm |publisher= International Labour Organization|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One challenge that the ILO faces is the low ratification levels of the fundamental health and safety conventions. C155, C161, and C187 have been ratified by 60, 31, and 25 nations respectively.&lt;ref name=Ratification_C155&gt;{{cite web|title=Ratifications of C155 - Occupational Safety and Health Convention, 1981 (No. 155) |url=http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:11300:0::NO:11300:P11300_INSTRUMENT_ID:312300:NO|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ratifications of C161 - Occupational Health Services Convention, 1985 (No. 161)|url=http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:11300:0::NO:11300:P11300_INSTRUMENT_ID:312306:NO|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ratifications of C187 - Promotional Framework for Occupational Safety and Health Convention, 2006 (No. 187)|url=http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:11300:0::NO:11300:P11300_INSTRUMENT_ID:312332:NO|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the perspective of the ILO failing to meet the expectations delineated in the conventions are examples of international labor standards violations.

== Criticisms ==
In addition to disagreements about the appropriate method of implementation for international labour standards, there are dissenting opinions concerning the validity of their existence at all.  The two most common arguments raised against international labour standards are that they undermine international competitiveness and erode domestic policy.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

=== Undermines international competitiveness ===
A critique of international labour standards historically raised by right-of-centre economists is that they distort market forces, thus inhibiting employment and income.&lt;ref name=Kabeer3/&gt; According to right-wing economists, global free trade allows countries to specialise in those activities in which they have a [[comparative advantage]] and to reap mutual gains through exchange.  The international competitiveness of countries with large amounts of unskilled labour depends on their ability to provide low-cost workers.&lt;ref name=Kabeer3/&gt; Therefore, international standards would undermine any comparative advantage by increasing the cost of labour.  According to the conservative argument, international labour standards leave developing nations with a diminished export economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Labour standards in international trade agreements: an assessment of the arguments|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/095851999340594|journal = The International Journal of Human Resource Management|date = January 1, 1999|access-date = 2015-04-24|issn = 0958-5192|pages = 351–375|volume = 10|issue = 2|doi = 10.1080/095851999340594|first = George|last = Tsogas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of international labour standards often respond by arguing that this critique only attacks a particular aspect of enforcement rather than the standards themselves.  Furthermore, left-of-centre economists suggest that higher labour standards do not necessarily undermine competitiveness.&lt;ref name=Berik2006/&gt; Empirical evidence provided by Berik and Rodgers (2006) suggests that any costs of raising labour standards can easily be offset by incentives encouraging [[foreign direct investment]] (FDI) and exports.&lt;ref name=Berik2006/&gt; Following this line of argument, not only do higher labour standards improve social and political stability, thus encouraging more foreign investment, but they also provide valuable investments in human capital that can lead to efficiency gains.&lt;ref name=Berik2006/&gt;

=== Erodes domestic policy ===
Another prominent argument against international labour standards is the notion that any attempt to harmonise set benchmarks for acceptable working conditions disregards, to some extent, the current state of an individual country’s unique economic and social climates.&lt;ref name="Brown1"/&gt; It is suggested that rather than adopting an internationally agreed upon group of labour standards, sovereign states are better off leaving labour market regulation to domestic policy.&lt;ref name="Brown1"/&gt; In this way, it is argued, a country can tailor a standard such as a minimum wage to the specific situation in that area of the world rather than trying to implement an ill-fitting uniform wage.&lt;ref name="Brown1"/&gt; In a 1996 study, Drusilla Brown, Alan Deardorff and Robert Stern use a variety of theoretical labour models to test the effectiveness of the harmonisation of international labour standards.&lt;ref name=Seminar3&gt;Brown, Drusilla K., Alan V. Deardorff and Robert M. Stern. [http://www. fordschool.umich.edu/rsie/workingpapers/ppp.html "International labour standards and trade: A theoretical analysis"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020012258/http://www/ |date=2011-10-20 }}, ''Research Seminar in International Economics'' 3 (1996), accessed March 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The study concludes that in theoretical cases, market failures that allow a breakdown in working environment conditions are most adequately remedied by labour standards.&lt;ref name=Seminar3/&gt; However, market failures are not uniform across countries and so it stands to reason that labour standards should not be constructed in an international way.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

An example of this critique can be seen by looking at the issue of child labour practices.  The case against harmonised international labour rights makes the point that the amount of child labour in a country is directly dependent on its level of economic development.&lt;ref name="Brown2"/&gt; Following this line of reasoning, poorer countries have a better chance at abolishing child labour through economic development rather than minimum age requirements. In fact, one study found that children 14 years and younger are not completely withdrawn from the labour force until GDP approaches $5000 per capita.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Edmonds | first1 = E.

'''''Juarez v. AutoZone Stores, Inc.''''', Case No. 08-CV-00417-WVG (S.D. Cal. Nov. 17, 2014), was a court case in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California which is believed to be the largest single-plaintiff employment verdict in United States history at $185,872,719.52.&lt;ref&gt;https://lrus.wolterskluwer.com/news/employment-law-daily/185m-punitive-damages-verdict-for-autozone-employee-after-legal-department-cast-as-perpetrator/27260/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2014/nov/18/verdict-autozone-pregnancy-women-juarez-lawsuit/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.law360.com/articles/597232/jury-hits-autozone-with-185m-verdict-in-pregnancy-bias-row&lt;/ref&gt; This case is also believed to be the largest punitive damages verdict awarded to a single plaintiff in an employment discrimination lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parkerpoe.com/newsevents/2014/12/employnews-12-05-federal-judge-upholds-record |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-12-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222233203/http://www.parkerpoe.com/newsevents/2014/12/employnews-12-05-federal-judge-upholds-record |archivedate=2015-12-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://thenetwork.berkeleylawblogs.org/files/2014/11/Record-Punitive-Damages-set-in-Juarez-v.-AutoZone-Stores-Inc.-Verdict-.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and trial==
Rosario Juarez worked for [[AutoZone]] beginning in December 1999 as a cashier.  She was promoted to the position of Part Sales Manager in 2001 where she hit a glass ceiling and remained in that position for 3 years.

During the five years since she joined AutoZone, Ms. Juarez noticed that male employees were treated more favorably than female employees.  In particular, less experienced male employees were promoted to vacant store manager positions and other promotions far more often than women, regardless of experience and knowledge. Although qualified for open store manager positions in her district, Ms. Juarez was frequently passed over for promotion in favor of less experienced and qualified male employees.

The practice of promoting male employees to better positions faster than female employees permeated AutoZone in the past.  Most often women were relegated to service as delivery drivers. When possible, younger attractive women were sought for these positions to encourage predominantly male operated repair shops to place orders.  Women at AutoZone have rarely been promoted beyond assistant store manager or part sales manager positions.

Unknown to Plaintiff, AutoZone's California operations were subject to a legal requirement that women were to be provided greater opportunity for employment and advancement. Senior managers were required to keep statistical records concerning the hiring and promotion of women. The requirement resulted from a gender discrimination claim brought against Chief Auto Parts. AutoZone acquired Chief after the legal requirement was imposed and 
was therefore obligated to comply until it expired sometime in 2004. After the legal requirement expired, a meeting was held to announce that statistics pertaining to women in the workplace no longer needed to be collected. A district manager who was present at the meeting testified about 
how AutoZone leaders celebrated in reaction to the announcement. According to the witness, who was then an AutoZone District Manager the Vice President of the Western Division said “we can finally start getting rid of these women.”  Another corporate leader (who was later placed in charge of Plaintiff in San Diego) remarked that “women weren’t worth sh#t” to AutoZone. The same leader was also credited with telling a district manager that he needed to fire the women in his district stores if he hoped to be promoted to a regional manager himself.

In 2004, shortly after the end of the legal requirement expired, Plaintiff Ms. Juarez complained to upper management that she had been unfairly passed over for promotion to store manager.  Ms. Juarez specifically asked if she would be required to file a lawsuit in order to get promoted. Shortly after complaining, Plaintiff was informed she would be put in a Store Manager Training program for several months. Male employees who worked for AutoZone did not have to go through this training program which was only required for store manager candidates who came from other companies. Plaintiff received no actual training in the program and continued to serve as an assistant manager for other stores in the San Diego Market. Eventually in October 2004, Plaintiff was given her first opportunity to serve as a store manager.

Plaintiff excelled in the Store Manager position and had a positive impact on her store's sales and appearance.  At this time, her supervisor was a woman District Manager.  After several months, Ms. Juarez was assigned a different district manager, a male, who was demeaning and condescending to Plaintiff and the other women in her store. Male employees in the store would receive pats on the back and jolly greetings, while Plaintiff and her female assistant manager were treated coldly by the district manager with little positive encouragement or interaction. Although Plaintiff's store was steadily improving in response to her efforts, the district manager would continuously comment that she could not handle the job.  
 
In August 2005, Ms. Juarez became pregnant. At first she kept her condition secret for fear that the district manager would become more critical and upset. In late October 2005, Plaintiff received a favorable performance evaluation wherein she “met expectations” overall. However, the evaluation included multiple unfair comments.  Although she was fearful of the consequences, Ms. Juarez felt that company rules required her to disclose her condition to the district manager. In early November 2005, Ms. Juarez told the district manager she was pregnant. The meeting was witnessed by two assistant managers who testified at trial. Upon hearing the news, the district manager became visibly upset. He sarcastically responded, "Congratulations....I guess."  Later the district manager stated, "I feel sorry for you." Immediately after being informed Ms. Juarez was pregnant, the district manager became more aggressive, mean and critical of Ms. Juarez.  Suddenly, nothing was being done correctly. Time-consuming work assignments had to be redone, even though no need for a redo existed. Before knowing of the pregnancy the district manager gave the store short “fix-it-lists” of approximately 15 items to be addressed. Afterward, the lists became several pages and sometimes containing as many as 70 nitpicking items.  Yelling criticisms and public humiliation followed. The district manager repeatedly remarked in front of workers and customers that he did not believe Plaintiff could perform the work in her “condition” and told her to “step down.” Even though Plaintiff and her managers worked tirelessly, and often off the clock, to address the unwarranted “fix-it-lists,” Ms. Juarez was placed on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP). At 
all times while on the PIP, Ms. Juarez and her sales team met or beat sales targets set by the company. Nevertheless, the company falsely claimed she failed to improve and meet expectations.

In February 2006, Ms. Juarez was demoted back to assistant manager and placed in a different store.  Ms. Juarez lost her bonuses and overtime pay.  She was replaced by a male store manager who was not given “fix-it-lists.” Ms. Juarez worked until she was nine months pregnant and then went out on maternity leave one week before the birth of her second child. While on leave in April 2006, Ms. Juarez filed a charge of gender and pregnancy 
discrimination with California Department of Fair Employment and Housing concerning her demotion from store manager.  A key document in this case was a letter from AutoZone's legal department, called “AutoZoner Relations” to the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing in response to the discrimination complaint filed by Ms. Juarez. In a July 2006 letter, AutoZoner Relations claimed to have "thoroughly investigated" the claims of Ms. Juarez and found no problem.  However, at trial evidence clearly demonstrated that AutoZoner Relations never spoke to any of the obvious witnesses to the conduct including Plaintiff and the people who worked with Plaintiff in her store.

Following her maternity leave, Ms. Juarez returned to her demoted position in 2007.  While employed, Ms. Juarez filed a lawsuit in San Diego state court in January 2008, challenging her demotion as discrimination based on gender and pregnancy. She was deposed by AutoZone in October 2008, as part of her lawsuit. On November 20, 2008, Ms. Juarez was fired by AutoZone because she was allegedly not trustworthy. However, during discovery, AutoZone's person most knowledgeable witnesses indicated that the reasons for Plaintiff's termination were unknown. At trial, the witnesses “remembered” that the termination was probably related to an incident when loss prevention managers investigated a situation where another employee lost $400 cash while Plaintiff was in charge of the store. Alternatively, the company claimed that the termination may have been related to Plaintiff's refusal to fully cooperate in the $400 investigation by loss prevention.

During the course of litigation, AutoZone continued the date for trial because the company's loss prevention manager who investigated the missing $400 became pregnant. Months after the continuance, but before this trial, the company fired this loss prevention manager (while she was pregnant) for allegedly falsifying a store audit. The loss prevention manager testified to additional information not provided at the deposition she gave when still employed. According to the witness, the investigation into the missing $400 was requested by high level upper management. The investigation was prioritized over other incidents involving larger amounts of missing cash.  She was specifically instructed to target Ms. Juarez rather than the subordinate employee who the loss prevention manager actually suspected to have lost the cash. Contrary to the allegations of the company, the loss prevention manager confirmed that Ms. Juarez acted appropriately during the investigation and answered all questions concerning the incident. The loss prevention manager stated she provided a detailed report to AutoZoner Relations immediately following the investigation which was never produced by the company and was not brought to trial.

When Ms. Juarez was suspended for the incident on the day of the investigation, the loss prevent manager suspected retaliation had occurred; unfortunately, she did not say so at her deposition under pressure from AutoZone's lawyers to say only what she knew for absolute certain and for fear of retaliation. Several former AutoZone employees testified about a pervasive fear of retaliation at the company. One of Ms. Juarez's assistant managers testified he was fired a few months after she was demoted in retaliation for supporting Ms. Juarez as a store manager.

Declarations submitted by the company in support of AutoZone's summary judgment motions indicated that “AutoZoner Relations” had recommended both the demotion and termination of Ms. Juarez. In closing argument, counsel for Ms. Juarez argued that the illegal demotion and termination were orchestrated and/or ratified by the company's legal department. AutoZone did not call a single woman employee to say she was fairly treated by the company.

AutoZone's attorneys strenuously argued that there was no evidence to support Plaintiff's claims. Further, AutoZone claimed that Plaintiff was a manipulative liar who used threats to receive promotions. In closing, AutoZone's lead trial counsel asked the jury to ignore the evidence about their own upper management's statements. Its counsel argued that the company had additional witnesses and documents to support its position, but the company did not want to waste the time presenting the information.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.10news.com/news/jury-awards-mother-more-than-185m-in-damages-in-pregnancy-discrimination-case-against-autozone-11172014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wsj.com/articles/autozone-hit-with-186-million-verdict-1416359038&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-auto-zone-discrimination-verdict-20141118-story.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/AutoZone-Ordered-to-Pay-185M-in-Discrimination-Suit-283004671.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bna.com/autozone-pay-185-n17179912162/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Verdict==
The verdict in favor of Plaintiff included $393,749.52 in past wages, $228,960 in future wages, and $250,000 for past emotional distress for garden variety emotional harm such as anger, anxiety, emotional distress, worry and the like. Plaintiff testified to the shame and embarrassment she felt after her demotion. At the time of her termination, she was a single mother caring for her two young children. During a lengthy period of unemployment, she and her children would make burritos and sell them just to make money to survive. Although Ms. Juarez eventually found new employment with a different auto parts company, the difference between the earnings and benefits resulted in significant financial losses. The ability to earn bonuses and overtime pay as a store manager at AutoZone as compared to jobs without such benefits supported future wage loss, even though gainfully employed at the time of trial.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newyorkemploymentattorneysblog.com/sexual-harassment/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://go.bna.com/autozone-pay-185-n17179912162/{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The jury deliberated for a day and a half before finding for Plaintiff on all claims asserted.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.law360.com/articles/596966/ex-autozone-manager-wins-nearly-1m-in-gender-bias-row&lt;/ref&gt;

==Punitive damages phase==
Following the liability phase, Plaintiff presented the testimony of an economist to assess the company's ability to pay punitive damages. Using AutoZone's public financial disclosures, it was established that the cash flow of the company, after all operational expenses, is $20,798,192 a week.  Although on paper the company had a negative net worth of $1 billion, Plaintiff's economist explained the company's net worth is not a reliable indicator of the company's ability to pay because the excess cash was used to repurchase its stock, which had the effect of making outstanding shares more valuable.  Plaintiff's economist further testified that AutoZone had the ability to pay a $100,000,000 punitive damage award after only four weeks of operations. Defendant's economist, who was unaware of the company's cash flow, testified about the company's negative net worth but offered no comment regarding what amount of punitive damages the company could pay.

In opposition to any award of punitive damages, the company offered the testimony of attorney Allison Smith, the director AutoZoner Relations from its headquarters in Memphis, TN. Ms. Smith testified that she had come from Memphis to tell the jury that the company had heard their verdict and would be examining its “processes.” Ms. Smith told the jury that she wanted to speak with the jury to hear why they had found liability. On cross-examination, Ms. Smith acknowledged that this case was not the first time a California jury had sent the company a message about “retaliation.” She acknowledged a prior 2010 verdict in Sacramento, where AutoZone fired a district manager for “falsifying an audit” after he reported that a human resources manager used the “N” word in reference to customers and employees of AutoZone. Ms. Smith was asked what AutoZone had done as a result of the 2010 jury finding and she responded that AutoZone had paid the judgment.

As to financial condition, Ms. Smith confirmed that the company's current public filing with the SEC reported that all pending litigation against the company “individually or in the aggregate” was “not material to the company’s financial condition.” This became a stipulated fact during the punitive damages phase of trial.

In the closing argument for punitive damages, Plaintiff's counsel argued that the reprehensibility of the conduct was extremely high because the unlawful acts were committed by the legal department which was responsible for guiding operations around the world. Counsel suggested that more than a hundred million dollars would be required to ensure that the Board of Directors took a hard look at their legal department and "clean house."  Specifically, counsel suggested that the award should equate to one week of the company's extra cash for each year of injustice suffered by Plaintiff. Counsel expressed a hope that the verdict would come to be known as the “Juarez Award” which would stand for the proposition that women are an equal part of the workplace, that they have a right to work pregnant, and that retaliation will not be tolerated.  In opposition, AutoZone argued that it had heard the message and no further punitive damages were required.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dlapiper.com/en/us/insights/publications/2014/12/185-million-punitive-damages/&lt;/ref&gt; The jury deliberated one day before reaching its punitive damage verdict.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.law360.com/articles/596966/ex-autozone-manager-wins-nearly-1m-in-gender-bias-row&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31982">'''Judicial review in English law''' enables people to challenge the exercise of [[Political power|power]], often by a [[public body]]. A person who feels that an exercise of power is unlawful may apply to the [[Administrative Court]] (a division of the High Court) for a court to decide whether a decision followed the law. If the court finds the decision unlawful it may have it set aside (quashed) and possibly award damages. A court may impose an [[injunction]] upon the public body.

When creating a [[public body]], legislation will often define duties, limits of power, and prescribe the reasoning a body must use to make decisions. These provisions provide a means for a decision to be found unlawful. In addition, the [[Human Rights Act 1998]] provides that law must be interpreted and public bodies must act in a manner compliant with the European Convention on Human Rights. There are also [[common law]] constraints on the decision-making process of a body. Unlike the United States and some other jurisdictions, English law does not permit judicial review of primary legislation (laws passed by Parliament), except in a few cases where primary legislation is contrary to EU law or the European Convention on Human Rights. A person wronged by an Act of Parliament therefore cannot apply for judicial review unless this is the case, but may still argue that a body did not follow the Act.

==Constitutional position==
The English constitutional theory, as expounded by [[A. V. Dicey]], does not recognise a separate system of administrative courts that would review the decisions of public bodies (as in France, Germany and many other European countries). Instead, it is considered that the government should be subject to the jurisdiction of ordinary [[Common Law]] courts.

At the same time, the doctrine of [[Parliamentary sovereignty]] does not allow for the judicial review of primary legislation (primarily [[Act of Parliament|Acts of Parliament]]). This limits judicial review in English law to the decisions of officials and public bodies, and secondary (delegated) legislation, against which ordinary common law remedies, and special "[[prerogative writ|prerogative orders]]", are available in certain circumstances.

The constitutional theory of judicial review has long been dominated by the doctrine of ''[[ultra vires]]'', under which a decision of a public authority can only be set aside if it exceeds the powers granted to it by Parliament. The role of the courts was seen as enforcing the "will of Parliament" in accordance with the doctrine of Parliamentary sovereignty. However, the doctrine has been widely interpreted to include errors of law&lt;ref&gt;''[[Anisminic v Foreign Compensation Commission]]'' [1969] 2 AC 147&lt;/ref&gt; and of fact and the courts have also declared the decisions taken under the [[Royal Prerogative]] to be amenable to judicial review.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service]]'' [1985] AC 374&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it seems that today the constitutional position of judicial review is dictated by the need to prevent the abuse of power by the executive as well as to protect individual rights.

==Procedural requirements==

Under the [[Civil Procedure Rules]] a claim (application) for judicial review will only be admissible if permission (leave) for judicial review is obtained from the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]], which has supervisory jurisdiction over public authorities and tribunals. Permission may be refused if one of the following conditions is not satisfied:

# The application must be made promptly and in any event within three months from the date when the grievance arose.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov.uk/civil/procrules_fin/contents/parts/part54.htm Civil Procedure Rules, Part 54.5.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070524034326/http://www.justice.gov.uk/civil/procrules_fin/contents/parts/part54.htm |date=2007-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that legislation can impose shorter time limits while a court may hold that an application made in less than three months may still be not prompt enough. 
# The applicant must have sufficient interest in a matter to which the application relates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&amp;title=Supreme+Court+Act&amp;Year=1981&amp;searchEnacted=0&amp;extentMatchOnly=0&amp;confersPower=0&amp;blanketAmendment=0&amp;sortAlpha=0&amp;TYPE=QS&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;NavFrom=0&amp;parentActiveTextDocId=2033370&amp;ActiveTextDocId=2033416&amp;filesize=4940 Section 31(3) Senior Courts Act 1981] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090313235953/http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&amp;title=Supreme+Court+Act&amp;Year=1981&amp;searchEnacted=0&amp;extentMatchOnly=0&amp;confersPower=0&amp;blanketAmendment=0&amp;sortAlpha=0&amp;TYPE=QS&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;NavFrom=0&amp;parentActiveTextDocId=2033370&amp;ActiveTextDocId=2033416&amp;filesize=4940 |date=2009-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This requirement is known as the requirement of locus standi, or [[standing (law)|standing]]. 
# The application must be concerned with a [[public law]] matter, i.e. the action must be based on some rule of public law, not purely [[tort]] or [[contract]].

However, the Court will not necessarily refuse permission if one of the above conditions is in doubt. It may, in its discretion, examine all the circumstances of the case and see if the substantive grounds for judicial review are serious enough.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. ''[[R v Inland Revenue Commissioners ex p National Federation of Self-Employed and Small Businesses]]'' [1982] AC 617&lt;/ref&gt; Delay or lack of sufficient interest can also lead to the court refusing to grant a remedy after it had considered the case on the merits.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&amp;title=Supreme+Court+Act&amp;Year=1981&amp;searchEnacted=0&amp;extentMatchOnly=0&amp;confersPower=0&amp;blanketAmendment=0&amp;sortAlpha=0&amp;TYPE=QS&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;NavFrom=0&amp;parentActiveTextDocId=2033370&amp;ActiveTextDocId=2033416&amp;filesize=4940 Section 31(6)(b) Supreme court Act 1981] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090313235953/http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&amp;title=Supreme+Court+Act&amp;Year=1981&amp;searchEnacted=0&amp;extentMatchOnly=0&amp;confersPower=0&amp;blanketAmendment=0&amp;sortAlpha=0&amp;TYPE=QS&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;NavFrom=0&amp;parentActiveTextDocId=2033370&amp;ActiveTextDocId=2033416&amp;filesize=4940 |date=2009-03-13 }} and ''R v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Ex p World Development Movement Ltd'' [1995] 1 WLR 386&lt;/ref&gt;

The [http://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/protocol/prot_jrv pre-action protocol] states that it is usual for the Claimant to write a letter before claim to the proposed Defendant. The purpose of the letter is to identify the issues in dispute and to avoid litigation where possible. The protocol specifies a template for the letter. It is usual to allow 14 days for a response.

===Styling of the claimant===
Unlike other civil proceedings in English courts, in judicial review court papers the claimant is styled as ''The Queen (on the application of Claimant X)'' (or ''King'' when reigning). For example, ''The Queen (on the application of Claimant X) v Defendant Y'' or more succinctly ''R (on the application of Claimant X) v Defendant Y'' or ''R (Claimant Y) v Defendant Y''. This is a purely cosmetic formality that arises from a historical procedure where Her Majesty's Judiciary acted on her behalf in a supervisory capacity. Technically a judicial review is brought by the Crown, on the application of the claimant, to ensure that powers are being properly exercised.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/540607/administrative-court-judicial-review-guide.pdf Para 2.3.6 The Administrative Court Judicial Review Guide 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amenability to judicial review===
The decision complained of must have been taken by a public body, i.e. a body established by statute or otherwise exercising a public function. In ''[[R v Panel for Takeovers and Mergers Ex p Datafin]]'' [1987] 1 QB 815, the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] held that a privately established panel was amenable to judicial review because it in fact operated as an integral part of a governmental framework for regulating Mergers and Takeover, while those affected had no choice but to submit to its jurisdiction.

===Ouster clauses===
Sometimes the legislator may want to exclude the powers of the court to review administrative decision, making them final, binding and not appealable (''[[R (Cowl) v Plymouth City Council]]''). However, the courts have consistently held that none but the clearest words can exclude judicial review.&lt;ref&gt;''[[R v Medical Appeal Tribunal ex parte Gilmore]]'' [1957] 1 QB 574; [http://oxcheps.new.ox.ac.uk/casebook/Resources/CCSUVM_1%20DOC.pdf ''Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210112015/http://oxcheps.new.ox.ac.uk/casebook/Resources/CCSUVM_1%20DOC.pdf |date=2007-02-10 }}[1985] AC 374&lt;/ref&gt; When the Government wanted to introduce a new Asylum and Immigration Act containing such clear words, members of the judiciary protested to the extent of saying that they will not accept even such an exclusion.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://politics.guardian.co.uk/constitution/story/0,,1162591,00.html Lord Woolf: The Guardian Profile]&lt;/ref&gt; The Government withdrew the proposal.

The courts however do uphold time limits on applications for judicial review.&lt;ref&gt;''[[R v Secretary of State for the Environment ex parte Ostler]]'' [1976] 3 All ER 90&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exclusivity rule===
The House of Lords held in ''[[O'Reilly v Mackman]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1983] 2 AC 237&lt;/ref&gt; that where public law rights were at stake, the claimants could only proceed by way of judicial review. They could not originate their action under the general civil law procedure, because that would be avoiding the procedural safeguards afforded to public authorities by the judicial review procedure, such as the requirement of sufficient interest, timely submission and permission for judicial review. However, a defendant may still raise public law issues as a defence in civil proceedings. So for example, a tenant of the public authority could allege illegality of its decision to raise the rents when the authority sued him for failing to pay under the tenancy contracts. He was not required to commence a separate judicial review process (''[[Wandsworth London Borough Council v Winder]]'' (1985)). If an issue is a mix of private law rights, such as the right to get paid under a contract, and public law issues of the competence of the public authority to take the impugned decision, the courts are also inclined to allow the claimant to proceed using ordinary civil procedure, at least where it can be demonstrated that the public interest of protecting authorities against frivolous or late claims has not been breached (''[[Roy v Kensington and Chelsea and Westminster Family Practitioner Committee]]'' (1992), ''[[Trustees of the Dennis Rye Pension Fund v Sheffield City Council]]'' (1997)).

==Grounds for review==
In [http://oxcheps.new.ox.ac.uk/casebook/Resources/CCSUVM_1%20DOC.pdf ''Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service''] [1985] AC 374, [[Lord Diplock]] summarised the grounds for reversing an administrative decision by way of judicial review as follows:

* Illegality
* Irrationality (Unreasonableness)
* Procedural impropriety
* Legitimate expectation

The first two grounds are known as substantive grounds of judicial review because they relate to the substance of the disputed decision. Procedural impropriety is a procedural ground because it is aimed at the decision-making procedure rather than the content of the decision itself. Those grounds are mere indications: the same set of facts may give rise to more than one ground for judicial review.

===Illegality===

In Lord Diplock's words, this ground means that the decision maker "must understand correctly the law that regulates his decision-making power and must give effect to it".&lt;ref&gt;Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for Civil Service [1985] AC 374&lt;/ref&gt;

A decision may be illegal for many different reasons. There are no hard and fast rules for their classification, but the most common examples of cases where the courts hold administrative decisions to be unlawful are the following:

====The decision is made by the wrong person (unlawful sub-delegation)====

If the law empowers a particular authority, e.g. a minister, to make certain decisions, the Minister cannot subdelegate this power to another authority, e.g. an executive officer or a committee. This differs from a routine job not involving much discretion being done by civil servants in the Minister's name, which is not considered delegation.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Allingham v The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries]]'' (High Court, 1948); ''[[Carltona doctrine|Carltona v Commissioner of Works]]'' (Court of Appeal, 1943); ''[[R v Secretary of State for the Home Office Ex p Oladehinde]]'' (House of Lords, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of when this happened was in ''[[Allingham v Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries]]'' where a notice preventing farmers from growing sugar beet was unlawful because the power to put up the sign was delegated by the original committee. Where a decision is made by a properly empowered department within a local council, s.101 of the [[Local Government Act 2003]] allows for delegation.

====Jurisdiction: Error of law or error of fact====

The court will quash a decision where the authority has misunderstood a legal term or incorrectly evaluated a fact that is essential for deciding whether or not it has certain powers. So, in ''[[R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Khawaja]]'' [1984] AC 74, the House of Lords held that the question whether the applicants were "illegal immigrants" was a question of fact that had to be positively proved by the Home Secretary before he could use the power to expel them. The power depended on them being "illegal immigrants" and any error in relation to that fact took the Home Secretary outside his jurisdiction to expel them. However, where a term to be evaluated by the authority so broad and vague that reasonable people may reasonably disagree about its meaning, it is generally for the authority to evaluate its meaning. For example, in ''[[R v Hillingdon Borough Council ex Parte Pulhofer]]'' [1986] AC 484, the local authority had to provide homeless persons with accommodation. The applicants were a married couple, who lived with their two children in one room and applied to the local authority for aid. The local authority refused aid because it considered that the Pulhofers were not homeless and the House of Lords upheld this decision because whether the applicants had accommodation was a question of fact for the authority to determine.

====The decision maker went beyond their power: ultra vires====
The classic example of this is ''[[Attorney General v Fulham Corporation]]'' (1921) where Fulham council had the power to set up wash-houses for those without the facilities. They decided to charge people to use it. The court held they went beyond their power by trying to benefit commercially from something that was supposed to be for everyone.

Another example of this is the case of ''[[R v Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Ex p The World Development Movement]]''. Section 1 of the [[Overseas Development and Co-operation Act 1980]] empowered the [[Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs]] to assign funds for development aid of economically sound projects. The Secretary assigned the funds for a project to construct a power station on the [[Pergau River]] in [[Malaysia]] (see [[Pergau Dam]]) which was considered as uneconomic and not sound. The House of Lords held that this was not the purpose envisaged by the enabling statute and the Minister therefore exceeded his powers. A similar principle exists in many continental legal systems and is known by the French name of ''[[détournement de pouvoir]]''.

====Ignoring relevant considerations or taking irrelevant considerations into account====
This ground is closely connected to illegality as a result of powers being used for the wrong purpose. For example, ''[[Wheeler v Leicester City Council]]'', where the City Council banned a rugby club from using its ground because three of the club's members intended to go on a tour in [[South Africa]] at the time of [[apartheid]]. In ''[[R v Somerset County Council Ex parte Fewings]]'' the local authority decided to ban stag hunting on the grounds of it being immoral. In ''[[Padfield v Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food]]'', the Minister refused to mount an inquiry into a certain matter because he was afraid of bad publicity. In ''[[R v Inner London Education Authority, ex parte Westminster City Council]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[R v Inner London Education Authority, ex parte Westminster City Council]]'' [1986] 1 WLR 28, [[judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] (UK).&lt;/ref&gt; the London Education Authority used its powers to inform the public for the purpose of convincing the public of its political point of view. In all these cases, the authorities have based their decisions on considerations, which were not relevant to their decision making power and have acted unreasonably (this may also be qualified as having used their powers for an improper purpose).

Note that the improper purpose or the irrelevant consideration must be such as to '''materially influence''' the decision. Where the improper purpose is not of such material influence, the authority may be held to be acting within its lawful discretion. Hence in ''[[R v Broadcasting Complaints Commission, ex parte Owen]]'' [1985] QB 1153, the Broadcasting authority refused to consider a complaint that a political party has been given too little broadcasting time mainly for good reasons, but also with some irrelevant considerations, which however were not of material influence on the decision.

====Fettering discretion====
An authority will be acting unreasonably where it refuses to hear applications or makes certain decisions without taking individual circumstances into account by reference to a certain policy. When an authority is given discretion, it cannot bind itself as to the way in which this discretion will be exercised either by internal policies or obligations to others. Even though an authority may establish internal guidelines, it should be prepared to make exceptions on the basis of every individual case.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Lavender v Minister of Housing and Local Government]]'' [1970] 1 WLR 1231; ''[[British Oxygen v Minister of Technology]]'' [1971] AC 610&lt;/ref&gt;

===Irrationality===
Under Lord Diplock's classification, a decision is irrational if it is "so outrageous in its defiance of logic or of accepted moral standards that no sensible person who had applied his mind to the question could have arrived at it." This standard is also known as [[Wednesbury unreasonableness]], after the decision in ''[[Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corporation]]'', where it was first imposed.

Unlike illegality and procedural impropriety, the courts under this head look at the merits of the decision, rather than at the procedure by which it was arrived at or the legal basis on which it was founded. The question to ask is whether the decision "makes sense". In many circumstances listed under "illegality", the decision may also be considered irrational.

====Proportionality====
[[Proportionality (political maxim)|Proportionality]] is a requirement that a decision is proportionate to the aim that it seeks to achieve. E.g. an order to forbid a protest march on the grounds of public safety should not be made if there is an alternative way of protecting public safety, e.g. by assigning an alternative route for the march. Proportionality exists as a ground for setting aside administrative decisions in most continental legal systems and is recognised in England in cases where issues of [[EU law]] and [[European Convention on Human Rights|human rights]] are involved. However, it is not as yet a separate ground of judicial review, although Lord Diplock has alluded to the possibility of it being recognised as such in the future. At present, lack of proportionality may be used as an argument for a decision being irrational.&lt;ref&gt;''[[R (Daly) v Secretary of State for the Home Department]]'' [2001] 2 AC 532&lt;/ref&gt;

===Procedural impropriety===
A decision suffers from procedural impropriety if in the process of its making the procedures prescribed by statute have not been followed or if the "rules of [[natural justice]]" have not been adhered to.

====Statutory procedures====
An Act of Parliament may subject the making of a certain decision to a procedure, such as the holding of a public hearing or inquiry,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Jackson Stansfields v Butterworth]]''&lt;/ref&gt; or a consultation with an external adviser.&lt;ref&gt;''[[R v Social Services Secretary ex parte Association of Metropolitan Authorities]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Some decisions may be subject to approval by a higher body. Courts distinguish between "mandatory" requirements and "directory" requirements. A breach of mandatory procedural requirements will lead to a decision being set aside for procedural impropriety.

====Breach of natural justice====
{{see also|Natural justice}}
The rules of natural justice require that the decision maker approaches the decision making process with "fairness". What is fair in relation to a particular case may differ. As pointed out by [[Lord Bridge]] in ''[[Lloyd v McMahon]]'' [1987] AC 625, "the rules of natural justice are not engraved on tablets of stone". Below are some examples of what the rules of natural justice require:

=====The rule against bias=====
{{further information|R v Bow Street Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate Ex parte Pinochet Ugarte (No.1)}}
The first basic rule of natural justice is that nobody may be a judge in his own case. Any person that makes a judicial decision - and this includes e.g. a decision of a public authority on a request for a licence - must not have any personal interest in the outcome of the decision. If such interest is present, the decision maker must be disqualified even if no actual bias can be shown, i.e. it is not demonstrated that the interest has influenced the decision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld199899/ldjudgmt/jd981125/pino01.htm R v Bow Street Magistrates] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080709074338/http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld199899/ldjudgmt/jd981125/pino01.htm |date=2008-07-09 }} Ex p [[Augusto Pinochet|Pinochet]] [1999] 2 WLR 272&lt;/ref&gt; The test as to whether the decision should be set aside is whether there is a "real possibility [of bias]", as established in ''[[Gough v Chief Constable of the Derbyshire Constabulary]]'' [2001],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Gough v Chief Constable of the Derbyshire Constabulary]]'' [2001] 4 ALL ER 289&lt;/ref&gt; which dropped the 'fair minded observer' part of the test.&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldjudgmt/jd011213/magill-1.htm ''Magill v Porter''] [2002] AC 347&lt;/ref&gt;

=====The right to a fair hearing=====
Whether or not a person was given a fair hearing of his case will depend on the circumstances and the type of the decision to be made. The minimum requirement is that the person gets the chance to present his case. If the applicant has certain [[legitimate expectations]], for example to have his licence renewed, the rules of natural justice may also require that they are given an oral hearing and that their request may not be rejected without giving reasons.&lt;ref&gt;''[[McInnes v Onslow-Fane]]'' [1978] 1 WLR 1520&lt;/ref&gt; 

This was the principle in the case of ''[[Ridge v Baldwin]]'' [1964] AC 40.

=====Duty to give reasons=====
Unlike many other legal systems, English administrative law does not recognise a general duty to give reasons for a decision of a public authority.&lt;ref&gt;''[[R v Secretary of State for the Home Department Ex p Doody]]'' [1993] 3 All ER 92&lt;/ref&gt; A duty to give reasons may be imposed by statute. Where it is not, [[common law]] may imply such a duty and the courts do so particularly with regard to judicial and quasi-judicial decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Doody (above), R v Civil Service Appeal Board Ex p Cunningham [1991]4 All ER 310&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legitimate expectations===
A legitimate expectation will arise when a person (or a group or class of persons) has been led by a policy, promise or representation of a public body to understand that, for example, certain steps will be followed in reaching a decision.
Considerations of legitimate expectations:

# When an individual or a group has been led to think that certain steps will apply.
# When an individual or a group relies on a policy or guidelines which govern an area of past executive action.

The above principle has been recognized in the case of [[R v Liverpool Corporation, ex parte Liverpool Taxi Fleet Operators (1972)]].&lt;ref&gt;''R v Liverpool corporation ex parte Liverpool taxi Fleet Operators'' [1972]&lt;/ref&gt;

The court may uphold not only a legitimate expectation that a certain procedure would be followed by a public body ("procedural" expectations), but also an expectation of some substantive benefit. In a leading case on the latter point, Ms Coughlan, having been badly injured in a car accident, was promised a "home for life" by the health authority when she was transferred from the hospital to a care home. When the authority tried to evict her later, the court held the authority to their promise, since to frustrate Ms Coughlan's legitimate expectation would be unfair in the circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;(R v. North and. East Devon Health Authority, ex parte Coughlan [2001] QB 213)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Possibility of additional grounds of review ===
It has been suggested that proportionality (which is now expressly cited as a doctrine of review only in human rights cases and cases with an EU dimension) should become a separate general head of review.

There is some authority for the proposition that the courts employ a normative legal concept of "moral desert". Dr Kennefick of Queen's College, Oxford has posited that the essential question that the courts ask themselves is this: "did they deserve it?" When both parties deserve it, the secondary inquiry is "who deserved it more?" On the unlikely occurrence of equal moral desert existing between two parties, the courts should, Kennefick argues, be able to give both parties a remedy.

==Remedies==
The following remedies are available in proceedings for judicial review:
* Quashing order
* Prohibiting order
* Mandatory order
* Declaration
* Injunction
* Damages (only available if sought on non-Judicial Review grounds)

In any case more than one remedy can be applied for; however, the granting of all remedies is entirely at the court’s discretion.

=== Quashing order ===

A quashing order nullifies a decision which has been made by a public body. The effect is to make the decision completely invalid. Such an order is usually made where an authority has acted outside the scope of its powers (''ultra vires''). The most common order made in successful judicial review proceedings is a quashing order. If the court makes a quashing order it can send the case back to the original decision maker directing it to remake the decision in light of the court’s findings. Very rarely, if there is no purpose in sending the case back, it may take the decision itself.

=== Prohibiting order ===

A prohibiting order is similar to a quashing order in that it prevents a tribunal or authority from acting beyond the scope of its powers. The key difference is that a prohibiting order acts prospectively by telling an authority not to do something in contemplation. Examples of where prohibiting orders may be appropriate include stopping the implementation of a decision in breach of natural justice, or to prevent a local authority licensing indecent films, or to prevent the deportation of someone whose immigration status has been wrongly decided.

=== Mandatory order ===

A mandatory order compels public authorities to fulfill their duties. Whereas quashing and prohibition orders deal with wrongful acts, a mandatory order addresses wrongful failure to act. A mandatory order is similar to a mandatory injunction (below) as they are orders from the court requiring an act to be performed. Failure to comply is punishable as a contempt of court. Examples of where a mandatory order might be appropriate include: compelling an authority to assess a disabled person’s needs, to approve building plans, or to improve conditions of imprisonment. A mandatory order may be made in conjunction with a quashing order, for example, where a local authority’s decision is quashed because the decision was made outside its powers, the court may simultaneously order the local authority to remake the decision within the scope of its powers.

=== Declaration ===

A declaration is a judgment by the Administrative Court which clarifies the respective rights and obligations of the parties to the proceedings, without actually making any order. Unlike the remedies of quashing, prohibiting and mandatory order the court is not telling the parties to do
anything in a declaratory judgment. For example, if the court declared that a proposed rule by a local authority was unlawful, a declaration would resolve the legal position of the parties in the proceedings. Subsequently, if the authority were to proceed ignoring the declaration, the applicant who obtained the declaration would not have to comply with the unlawful rule and the quashing, prohibiting and mandatory orders would be available.

=== Injunction ===

An injunction is an order made by the court to stop a public body from acting in an unlawful way. Less commonly, an injunction can be mandatory, that is, it compels a public body to do something. Where there is an imminent risk of damage or loss, and other remedies would not be sufficient, the court may grant an interim injunction to protect the position of the parties before going to a full hearing. If an interim injunction is granted pending final hearing, it is possible that the side which benefits from the injunction will be asked to give an undertaking that if the other side is successful at the final hearing, the party which had the benefit of the interim protection can compensate the other party for its losses. This does not happen where the claimant is legally aided.

=== Damages ===

Damages are available as a remedy in judicial review in limited circumstances. Compensation is not available merely because a public authority has acted unlawfully. For damages to be available there must be either:
# A recognised private law cause of action such as negligence or breach of statutory duty or;
# A claim under European law or the Human Rights Act 1998.

=== Discretion ===

The discretionary nature of the remedies outlined above means that even if a court finds a public body has acted wrongly, it does not have to grant any remedy. Examples of where discretion will be exercised against an applicant may include where the applicant’s own conduct has been unmeritorious or unreasonable, for example where the applicant has unreasonably delayed in applying for judicial review, where the applicant has not acted in good faith, where a remedy would impede an authority's ability to deliver fair administration, or where the judge considers that an alternative remedy could have been pursued.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12338">The '''Lloyd–La Follette Act''' of 1912 began the process of protecting [[civil servants]] in the [[United States]] from unwarranted or abusive removal by codifying "just cause" standards previously embodied in presidential orders.  It defines "just causes" as those that would promote the "efficiency of the service."  August 24, 1912, § 6, {{USStat|37|555}}, {{USC|5|7511}}

The Act further states that "the right of employees... to furnish information to either House of Congress, or to a committee or Member thereof, may not be interfered with or denied." {{USC|5|7211}}

== Legislative history ==

Under the leadership of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Senator [[Robert M. La Follette, Sr.]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.napfe.com/mg0701wc.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-08-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050129201112/http://www.napfe.com/mg0701wc.htm |archivedate=2005-01-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United States Congress]] enacted the Act with the intention of conferring job protection rights on federal employees which they had not previously had.  Prior to the enactment of this language, there was no such statutory inhibition on the authority of the government to discharge a federal employee, and an employee could be discharged with or without cause for conduct which was not protected under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]].

The act was passed after the [[Theodore Roosevelt]] (in 1902) and [[William Howard Taft|Taft]] (in 1909) administrations prohibited federal employees from communicating with Congress without authorization from their superiors. This language was later placed in the [[Civil Service Reform Act of 1978]] and codified in {{USC|5|7211}}. The purpose of this Act was to allow Congress to obtain uncensored, essential information from federal employees. Congress intended to allow the federal workers direct access to Congress in order to register complaints about conduct by their supervisors and to report corruption or incompetence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.congress.gov/cgi-bin/cpquery/T?&amp;report=sr167&amp;dbname=106&amp; DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA COURT EMPLOYEES ACT OF 1999, Report of the COMMITTEE ON GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS UNITED STATES SENATE, to accompany H.R. 858, TO AMEND CHAPTER 17 OF TITLE 11, DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CODE, TO PROVIDE FOR PERSONNEL PROTECTION FOR DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA COURT EMPLOYEES]&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Arnett v. Kennedy]]'', 416 U.S. 134 (1974),&lt;ref&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=416&amp;invol=134 FindLaw for Legal Professionals - Case Law, Federal and State Resources, Forms, and Code&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; the United States Supreme Court addressed questions about the Act.  It held that the Act's standard of employment protection, which describes as explicitly as is feasible in view of the wide variety of factual situations where employees' statements might justify dismissal for "cause" the conduct that is ground for removal, is not impermissibly vague or overbroad in regulating federal employees' speech.

One of the primary purposes of the Act was to protect those who criticize of superiors from official retribution. Senator La Follette gave the following example of an abuse sought to be cured by the bill

&lt;blockquote&gt;The cause for [the employee's] dismissal was that he gave publicity to the insanitary conditions existing in some part of the post-office building in Chicago where the clerks were required to perform their services.... [H]e furnished some facts to the press of Chicago, and the publication was made of the conditions. They were simply horrible.... The public health officers of Chicago, as soon as their attention was called to the conditions, condemned the situation as they found it; and yet this young man, one of the brightest fellows I have met, was removed from the service because, he had given publicity to these outrageous conditions. {{USCongRec|48|10731}} (1912).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Act was thus the first federal law enacted specifically to protect [[whistleblower]]s.

The history and scope of the Act was further described by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in ''[[Bush v. Lucas]]'', 462 U.S. 367, 103 S.Ct. 2404 (1983).&lt;ref&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=462&amp;invol=367 findlaw.com], quoting directly from the decision&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Congressional attention to the problem of {{Sic|hide=y|politically|-}}motivated removals was again prompted by the issuance of Executive Orders by Presidents Roosevelt and Taft that forbade federal employees to communicate directly with Congress without the permission of their supervisors....  These "gag orders," enforced by dismissal, were cited by several legislators as the reason for enacting the Lloyd–La Follette Act in 1912, {{USStat|37|555}}, § 6.FN20 That statute... explicitly guaranteed that the right of civil servants "to furnish information to either House of Congress, or to any committee or member thereof, shall not be denied or interfered with." FN22 As the House Report explained, this legislation was intended "to protect employees against oppression and in the right of free speech and the right to consult their representatives." FN23 In enacting the Lloyd–La Follette Act, Congress weighed the competing policy considerations and concluded that efficient management of government operations did not preclude the extension of free speech rights to government employees.FN24&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Footnote 20. See 48 Cong.Rec. 4513 (1912) (remarks of Rep. Gregg) ("[I]t is for the purpose of wiping out the existence of this despicable 'gag rule' that this provision is inserted. The rule is unjust, unfair, and against the provisions of the Constitution of the United States, which provides for the right of appeal and the right of free speech to all its citizens.") A number of the bill's proponents asserted that the gag rule violated the First Amendment rights of civil servants. See, e.g., id., at 4653 (remarks of Rep. Calder) (1912); id., at 4738 (remarks of Rep. Blackmon); id., at 5201 (remarks of Rep. Prouty); id., at 5223 (remarks of Rep. O'Shaunessy); id., at 5634 (remarks of Rep. Lloyd); id., at 5637-5638 (remarks of Rep. Wilson); id., at 10671 (remarks of Sen. Ashurst); id., at 10673 (remarks of Sen. Reed); id., at 10793 (remarks of Sen. Smith); id., at 10799 (remarks of Sen. La Follette).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{quote|Footnote 22. This provision was accompanied by a more specific guarantee that membership in any independent association of postal employees seeking improvements in wages, hours, and working conditions, or the presentation to Congress of any grievance, "shall not constitute or be cause for reduction in rank or compensation or removal of such person or groups of persons from said service."

Footnote 23. H.R.Rep. No. 388, 62d Cong., 2d Sess. 7 (1912).

Footnote 24. Members of the House, which originated § 6, suggested that it would improve the efficiency and morale of the civil service. "It will do away with the discontent and suspicion which now exists among the employees and will restore that confidence which is necessary to get the best results from the employees." 48 Cong.Rec. 4654 (1912) (remarks of Rep. Calder); see id., at 5635 (remarks of Rep. Lloyd).

The Senate Committee initially took a different position, urging in its report that the relevant language, see id., at 10732 (House version) be omitted entirely:

As to the last clause in section 6, it is the view of the committee that all citizens have a constitutional right as such to present their grievances to Congress or Members thereof. But governmental employees occupy a position relative to the Government different from that of ordinary citizens. Upon questions of interest to them as citizens, governmental employees have a [[right to petition]] Congress direct. A different rule should prevail with regard to their presentation of grievances connected with their relation to the Government as employees. In that respect good discipline and the efficiency of the service requires that they present their grievances through the proper administrative channels." S.Rep. No. 955, 62d Cong.2d Sess. 21 (1912).

As Sen. Bourne explained, "it was believed by the committee that to recognize the right of the individual employee to go over the head of his superior and go to Members of Congress on matters appertaining to his own particular grievances, or for his own selfish interest, would be detrimental to the service itself; that it would absolutely destroy the discipline necessary for good service." 48 Cong.Rec. 10676 (1912).

This view did not prevail. After extended discussion in floor debate concerning the right to organize and the right to present grievances to Congress, id., at 10671-10677, 10728-10733, 10792-10804, the committee offered and the Senate approved a compromise amendment to the House version, guaranteeing both rights at least in part, which was subsequently enacted into law. Id., at 10804; 37 Stat. 555.}}

==Subsequent legislation==

In 1997, the Justice Department argued that Congress does not have a constitutional right to obtain information from civil servants through unauthorized disclosures. Based on its analysis of disclosure laws and its stance on separation of powers, Justice argued that Congress cannot vest "in executive branch employees a right to provide classified information to members of Congress without official authorization."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.govexec.com/story_page.cfm?articleid=13371&amp;printerfriendlyVers=1&amp; govexec.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Congress adopted an anti-gag rule.  The government-wide prohibition on the use of appropriated funds to pay the salary of any federal official who prohibits or prevents or threatens to prohibit or prevent a federal employee from contacting Congress first appeared in the [[Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act]], 1998, {{USPL|105|61}}, {{USStat|111|1318}}, (1997). In 1997, the Senate passed a prohibition that applied only to the Postal Service, while the House of Representatives passed a governmentwide prohibition. The conference report adopted the House version, and a government-wide prohibition has been included in every Treasury-Postal appropriations act since fiscal year 1998.&lt;ref&gt;H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 105-284, at 50, 80 (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

This provision has its antecedents in several older pieces of legislation, including the [[Treasury Department Appropriation Act of 1972]], the Lloyd–La Follette Act of 1912, and the [[Civil Service Reform Act of 1978]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gao.gov/decisions/appro/302911.htm gao.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Rep. [[John Conyers]] included the Lloyd–La Follette Act in a list of 26 laws that he contends President [[George W. Bush]] violated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buzzflash.com/articles/alerts/95+ buzzflash.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.house.gov/judiciary_democrats/iraqrept2.html house.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mining setts''' were a legal arrangement used historically in the counties of [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]] in South West England to manage the exploitation of land for the extraction of [[tin]]. The term was also used on the [[Isle of Man]].&lt;ref&gt;''Manx Sun'', Saturday, February 25, 1871; Page: 9&lt;/ref&gt;

They were a form of licence by the holder of a set of [[tin bounds]] (or bounder) to allow a miner or group of miners (known as adventurers) to work the ground within the bounds for tin. Setts were usually granted subject to conditions, such as the requirement to actually work the ground and were also often limited to a specified depth of ground.

In return for the grant of a sett, the adventurers were required to pay a portion of the tin extracted to the bounders. This portion was known as [[farm tin]]. Its payment was in addition to the requirement to pay [[toll tin]] to the freeholder of the land and [[tin coinage]] duty on the refined tin before it could legally be sold.

'''NABERS''', the '''National Australian Built Environment Rating System''', is an initiative by the government of Australia to measure and compare the [[Environmentally friendly|environmental performance]] of [[Global warming in Australia|Australian]] buildings and tenancies. There are NABERS rating tools for [http://www.nabers.gov.au/public/WebPages/ContentStandard.aspx?module=21&amp;template=2&amp;id=210&amp;include=Dashboard.htm commercial office buildings] to measure [[Greenhouse gas|greenhouse gas emissions]], [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]], [[water efficiency]], [[Waste|waste efficiency]] and [[Building science|indoor environment quality]]. There are also energy/greenhouse and water rating tools for [http://www.nabers.gov.au/public/WebPages/ContentStandard.aspx?module=22&amp;template=2&amp;id=211&amp;include=Dashboard.htm hotels], [http://www.nabers.gov.au/public/WebPages/ContentStandard.aspx?module=23&amp;template=2&amp;id=212&amp;include=Dashboard.htm shopping centres] and [http://www.nabers.gov.au/public/WebPages/ContentStandard.aspx?module=27&amp;template=2&amp;id=216&amp;include=Dashboard.htm data centres].

== Accredited Assessors ==
A key feature of the initiative is the use of independent 'Accredited Assessors' to conduct ratings. Assessors are required to attend training, pass an exam and complete two supervised assessments before they receive full accreditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is an Accredited Assessor?|url = http://www.nabers.gov.au/public/WebPages/ContentStandard.aspx?module=30&amp;template=3&amp;include=AccreditAssessor.htm&amp;side=AssessorTertiary.htm|website = www.nabers.gov.au|accessdate = 2016-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there are no formal pre-requisites to attend the training, most Assessors have experience in the building services, property or energy management industries. Building owners and tenants can use the online 'self-assessment' tool, however they cannot promote these results. Only ratings that have been certified by the NABERS National Administrator can be promoted using the NABERS [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/trademark trademark].

== Calculating a rating ==
The vision statement of NABERS is 'To support a more [[sustainable]] [[built environment]] through a relevant, reliable and practical measure of [[building performance]]'.

=== Offices ===
The NABERS tools attempt to provide an [[Accuracy and precision|accurate]] [[measurement]] of how [[Efficiency|efficiently]] building owners and tenants are providing their services ''without penalising them for factors that are beyond their control''. 

For example if the primary service that an [[Office|office building]] owner provides is [[Safety|safe]], [[Light|lit]] and [[comfortable]] office space the NABERS Energy for offices tool would consider how much space is being used, how much energy is being used to supply services to the space, and then statistically adjusts for factors like the climate - which will influence [[Energy conservation|how much energy is used for heating and cooling]].

==== Energy====
To obtain a NABERS Energy for offices rating, consumption data for the building (such as electricity and gas bills) is collected by Accredited Assessors along with data about a number of other aspects of the building such as its size, hours of occupation, climate location and density of occupation. Data requirements are set out in a document called [http://www.nabers.gov.au/public/WebPages/DocumentHandler.ashx?docType=2&amp;id=44&amp;attId=0 'The NABERS Energy and Water for Offices Rules for Collecting and Using Data v.3.0']. This data is then input into the NABERS rating calculator&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Rating calculator – NABERS|url = http://www.nabers.gov.au/public/WebPages/RatingCalculator.aspx?module=40|website = www.nabers.gov.au|accessdate = 2016-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; which statistically adjusts for these factors so that the building can have its consumption fairly [[Benchmarking|benchmarked]] against its peers. The result of this calculation is a star rating on a six star scale, where zero is very poor performance and six is market leading.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nabers.gov.au/public/WebPages/DocumentHandler.ashx?docType=2&amp;id=44&amp;attId=0|title = NABERS Energy and Water for offices - Rules for collecting and using data|date = February 2013|accessdate = 2016-01-09|website = www.nabers.gov.au|publisher = NABERS|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Water ====
The procedure for an office water rating is similar to conducting an office energy rating. The main differences are that it is water rather than energy bills that are used, and some data such as the hours of operation are not required. Unlike office energy ratings, which can either be for the base building, tenancies or whole building, office water ratings are only available for whole buildings.

=== Data centres ===

==== Energy ====
Like NABERS for offices, NABERS Energy for [[Data center|data centres]] has three distinct rating types to reflect the different interests and responsibilities from data centres owners, operators and tenants - Infrastructure (co-location owner), Whole Facility (data centre owner) and IT Equipment (data centre tenant) ratings. The tool is designed to rate the majority of data centres in Australia, provide a direct comparison with other rateable data centres, and allow an individual data centre to measure and compare performance over time.

The NABERS Data Centre IT Equipment Rating is designed for organisations that control and manage their own [[IT]] equipment ([[Server (computing)|servers]], [[Computer Storage|storage]] and [[networking devices]]). The IT Equipment rating measures feastures that are closely related to the primary functions of a data centre ([[Computer performance|processing]], [[Computer data storage|storage]] and [[Computer network|networking]]) and that all data centres provide, regardless of how they provide them. NABERS uses two IT equipment metrics:
* [[Processing power|Processing capacity]]: number of server cores × clock speed in gigahertz (GHz) and
* [[Computer data storage|Storage capacity]] (total unformatted storage capacity in [[terabytes]]).
The NABERS performance benchmark model predicts the industry median [[greenhouse gas]] emissions for a given amount of data centre processing and storage capacity. This means that if a data centre consumes more energy than the benchmark model predicts, the site is less energy efficient than the industry median (set at 3 stars), while if it consumes less energy it is more efficient than the median. 
To obtain a NABERS Energy for data centres IT Equipment rating, [[Energy in Australia|energy consumption]] data for the IT equipment over a 28- to 40-day period is collected by Accredited Assessors along with data about the total unformatted storage capacity and total processing capacity as above.

The Infrastructure Rating measures the [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] in delivering support services to the IT equipment, using the widely accepted industry [[Power usage effectiveness|Power Usage Effectiveness]] (PUE) ratio that is converted into kilogram of emissions with some modification for climate and shared cooling services. To obtain an infrastructure rating, 12 months of energy consumption data for IT equipment and infrastructure services is collected by Accredited Assessors along with the climate location of the data centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nabers.gov.au/public/WebPages/DocumentHandler.ashx?docType=3&amp;id=85&amp;attId=0|title = NABERS Energy for data centres - Rules for collecting and using data|date = |accessdate = 2016-01-09|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Whole Facility rating measures the energy efficiency of the whole data centre by assessing the processing and storage capacity and the industry median energy efficiency for infrastructure services compared with the overall energy consumption of the data centre. It is a combination of both the IT Equipment and Infrastructure rating benchmarks To obtain a NABERS Energy for data centres Whole Facility rating, 12 months of energy consumption data for the data centre is collected by Accredited Assessors along with the processing and storage capacity and climate location of the data centre.

==Comparison to other building rating systems==
There are a number of building environmental certification systems across the world, such as [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]], [[Green Star (Australia)|Green Star]], [[BREEAM|BRE Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM)]] and [[Display Energy Certificate|Display Energy Certificates (DECs)]]. The key features of NABERS as a system are that it is based on performance rather than design, assessments are carried out by third party 'Accredited Assessors', it is based on third party verifiable data (such as utility bills), ratings undergo government quality assurance checks and it distinguishes between the environmental impact of a building's shared services and its tenancies. While other rating systems across the world share some of these features, none share all of them.

== Program Success ==
NABERS Energy for offices is considered by many to have been successful, as over 82% of the Australian national office market has now been rated with either a base building or whole building rating. Factors behind the success of the tool are largely attributed to its ability to differentiate between the base building and tenants energy end uses and strong government support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.buildingrating.org/graphic/australias-nabers-energy-rating-label|title = Australia's NABERS Energy Rating Label|date = 2014-05-01|accessdate = 2016-01-09|website = Building Rating|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Far fewer tenancy energy ratings have been conducted however and there has also been far less uptake of the other tools.

== Use in Australian Energy Programs &amp; Policy ==
While NABERS Energy is a voluntary rating scheme for buildings, its success has been at least partly driven by its extensive use in energy initiatives by government and industry throughout Australia.  Some programs include:

* '''[http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/resources/government/140567NSWGREP.pdf The NSW Government Resource Efficiency Policy (GREP)]:''' The most recent iteration of a series of NSW government procurement policies that set out NABERS targets in government leasing criteria. In the GREP, government tenants require a building to have a 4.5 star NABERS rating. It also states a 4.5 star energy rating as a minimum criteria for government data centres. Similar policies are in place other states and territories, as well as the Australian government (the 'Energy Efficiency in Government Operations' policy).
* '''[http://www.environment.gov.au/climate-change/emissions-reduction-fund Emissions Reduction Fund]:''' the centrepiece of Australia's carbon abatement strategy, to begin operating in early 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Emissions Reduction Fund to begin allocating money next year|url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-11-02/emissions-reduction-fund-direct-action-begin-allocating-money/5860762|website = ABC News|accessdate = 2016-01-09|language = en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;  NABERS Energy is used in the commercial buildings methodology, to calculate and ensure the carbon abatement achieved by project proponents is real &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Emissions Reduction Fund methods|url = http://www.environment.gov.au/climate-change/emissions-reduction-fund/methods|website = www.environment.gov.au|accessdate = 2016-01-09|language = en|first = Department of the|last = Environment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Library of Scotland''' ({{lang-gd|Leabharlann Nàiseanta na h-Alba}}, {{lang-sco|Naitional Leebrar o Scotland}}) is the [[legal deposit]] [[library]] of [[Scotland]] and is one of the country's [[National Collections]]. Its main public building is in  [[Edinburgh]] city centre on [[George IV Bridge]], between the [[Edinburgh#Old Town|Old Town]] and the [[University of Edinburgh|university]] quarter. There is also a more modern building (1980s) in a residential area on the south side of the town centre, on Causewayside. This was built to accommodate some of the specialist collections, such as maps and science collections, and to provide extra large-scale  storage. In 2016 a new public centre opened at Glasgow's [[Kelvin Hall]] providing access to the Library's digital and moving image collections.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nls.uk/using-the-library/kelvin-hall|title=Kelvin Hall|last=|first=|date=|website=National Library of Scotland|language=en|access-date=2017-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Library of Scotland holds 7 million books,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rampantscotland.com/visit/bldev_visitnls.htm |title=Places to Visit in Scotland - National Library of Scotland |publisher=rampantscotland.com |accessdate=23 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 14 million printed items and over 2 million maps. The collection includes copies of the [[Gutenberg Bible]], the letter which [[Charles Darwin]] submitted with the manuscript of ''[[Origin of Species]]'', the [[First Folio of Shakespeare]] and numerous journals and other publications. It has the largest collection of Scottish Gaelic material of any library.

==History==
Originally, Scotland's national deposit library was the [[Advocates Library]] belonging to the [[Faculty of Advocates]]. It was opened in 1689 and gained [[national library]] status in the 1710 Copyright Act, giving it the legal right to a copy of every book published in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]]. In the following centuries, the library added books and manuscripts to the collections by purchase as well as legal deposit, creating a privately funded national library in all but name.

By the 1920s, the upkeep of such a major collection was too much for a private body, and, with an endowment of £100,000 provided by [[Sir Alexander Grant, 1st Baronet|Alexander Grant]], managing director of [[McVitie's|McVitie &amp; Price]], the Library's contents were presented to the nation. The National Library of Scotland was formally constituted by Act of Parliament in 1925.

The Nation recognised Grant with a baronetcy, and he was created Sir Alexander Grant of Forres in June 1924. In 1928 he donated a further £100,000 – making his combined donations the equivalent of around £6 million today – for a new library building to be constructed on [[George IV Bridge]], replacing the Victorian-period Sheriff Court, which institution moved to the [[Royal Mile]]. Government funding was secured which matched Sir Alexander's donation. Work on the new building was started in 1938, interrupted by the Second World War, and completed in 1956. The architect was [[Reginald Fairlie]]; the architectural sculptor was [[Hew Lorimer]]. The coat of arms above the entrance was sculpted by [[Scott Sutherland]] and the roundels above the muses on the front facade by [[Elizabeth Dempster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://canmore.org.uk/site/74103/edinburgh-57-george-iv-bridge-national-library-of-scotland|title=Edinburgh, 57 George Iv Bridge, National Library Of Scotland|last=|first=|date=|website=CANMORE|language=en|access-date=2017-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1970s, room for the ever-expanding collections was running out, and other premises were needed. The Causewayside Building opened in the south-side of Edinburgh in two phases, in 1989 and in 1995, at a total cost of almost £50 million, providing much-needed additional working space and storage facilities.

Since 1999, the Library has been funded by the [[Scottish Parliament]]. It remains one of only six legal deposit libraries in the United Kingdom and Ireland, and is governed by a board of trustees.

The Library also holds many ancient family manuscripts including those of the [[Clan Sinclair]], which date back as far as 1488.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/places/rosslynchapel_1.shtml |title=History of Rosslyn |last1=Turnbull |first1=Michael TRB |date=6 August 2009 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=23 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 February 2009, areas of the building were flooded after a water main burst on the 12th floor. Firefighters were called and the leaking water was stopped within ten minutes. A number of items were lightly damaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/edinburgh_and_east/7913935.stm |title=National library hit by flooding |date=27 February 2009 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=23 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last letter written by [[Mary Queen of Scots]] made a rare public appearance to mark the opening of a new Library visitor centre in September 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nls.uk/news/press/2009/09/mary-queen-of-scots-last-letter-now-on-display-for-limited-time |title=Mary Queen of Scots' last letter now on display for limited time |date=13 September 2009 |publisher=National Library of Scotland |accessdate=23 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Library joined the [[10:10]] project in 2010 in a bid to reduce their [[carbon footprint]]. One year later they announced that they had reduced their carbon emissions according to 10:10's criteria by 18%.

On 16 May 2012 the National Library of Scotland Act 2012 was passed by the [[Scottish Parliament]], and received [[Royal assent|Royal Assent]] in 21 June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2012/3/introduction/enacted|title=National Library of Scotland Act 2012|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In April 2013 the Library advertised for a [[Wikipedian in residence]], becoming the first institution in the Scotland to create such a post.&lt;ref name="Scotsman 25Apr2013"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/culture/books/national-library-of-scotland-to-hire-wikipedian-1-2908433 |title=National Library of Scotland to hire 'Wikipedian' |first=Brian |last=Ferguson |date=25 April 2013 |accessdate=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the Library recruited a Gaelic Wikipedian in residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.historyscotland.com/articles/news/gaelic-wikipedia-in-preparation-through-national-library-of-scotland|title=Gaelic Wikipedia in preparation through National Library of Scotland collaboration|last=|first=|date=11 October 2016|website=History Scotland|language=en|access-date=2017-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016 the Library opened a new centre at the refurbished [[Kelvin Hall]], Glasgow, in partnership with [[Glasgow City Council|Glasgow Life]] and the [[University of Glasgow]]. The centre provides access to the Library's digital and moving image collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kelvinhall.org.uk/|title=Kelvin Hall|author=|date=|website=kelvinhall.org.uk|accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5264">'''Nations''' are [[student]] divisions at some of the [[ancient universities of Scotland]].

[[Nation (university)|Nations]] were a characteristic of some of the ancient universities and have gradually decreased in significance in recent times. As the newest of the ancient universities, nations never existed at the [[University of Edinburgh]], and were abolished at St Andrews following discussions at the Royal Commission on the Universities of Scotland, which later led to the [[Universities (Scotland) Acts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/media/medieval_university.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605183405/http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/media/medieval_university.pdf |archivedate=2011-06-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/officersofmarisc00aberuoft|title=Officers of the Marischal College and University of Aberdeen, 1593-1860|first=University of Marischal College|last=Aberdeen|date=17 September 1897|publisher=[Aberdeen] Univ. Press|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Student nations continued into modern times at the [[University of Aberdeen]] and the [[University of Glasgow]] for the specific purpose of electing a [[Ancient university governance in Scotland#The Rector|Rector]] of the university.

==St Andrews==
The [[University of St Andrews]], in common with continental universities at the time of its founding, was divided into nations each presided over by a Procurator. The four nations were originally Albany, Angus, Lothian and Britain covering approximately North West, North East, South East and South West Scotland. Later, the original Albany was renamed Fife, while Britain became Albany and included the Western Isles and all places outside Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://foi.st-andrews.ac.uk/PublicationScheme/servlet/core.generator.gblobserv?id=119 ]{{dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The four nations each chose an “intrant”, who in turn chose the [[Rector of the University of St Andrews|Lord Rector]]. At that time the duties of Rector were similar to those of the [[ancient university governance in Scotland#Principal and Vice Chancellor|Principal of the university]] today. In case of a tie, the decision was left to the outgoing Lord Rector.&lt;ref&gt;R.G.Cant, ''The University of St Andrews'' (Scottish Academic Press, 1970), p.7-8&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the nations system for rectorial elections was discontinued after the national establishment of elected Rectors under the [[Universities (Scotland) Act 1858]].

==Glasgow==

At the [[University of Glasgow]] the use of nations continued until 1977 for the election of the university's [[Rector of the University of Glasgow|Lord Rector]]. The University has four nations, originally called [[Clydesdale]], [[Teviotdale]], Albany and [[Rothesay, Argyll and Bute|Rothesay]], and later as Clydesdale (''Glottiana''), Lothian, ''Transforthana'' (land over the Forth, essentially Albany) and Rothesay. Respectively, their heraldic symbols are: a two headed bird over crossed tools, an anchor over crossed tools, a horn over crossed tools and a sailing ship over crossed tools.

Three of the 'nations' consisted of defined areas in Scotland, with Loudoniana consisting of students from all other places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish-places.info/towns/townhistory338.html|title=Glasgow from The Gazetteer for Scotland|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The heraldic symbols of the nations can be seen in the stonework of a number of university buildings, including the [[Glasgow University Union]] and the chapel, under the Latin title of the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scran.ac.uk/000-000-145-456-C|title=Scran ::: Armorial Plaques Representing The Student Nations Of The University Of Glasgow|website=Scran}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aberdeen==
[[File:Aberdeen plaque.jpg|thumb|Plaque depicting the arms of the University of Aberdeen and its four nations (in each corner) in [[King's College, Aberdeen|King's College]] Chapel.]]
The [[University of Aberdeen]] also had a system of nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/past/53.1.28|title=Medieval Student Power|journal=Past and Present|volume=53|page=28|year=1971|last1=Cobban|first1=Alan B.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Universities (Scotland) Act 1858]], the use of nations to elect the [[Rector of the University of Aberdeen|Lord Rector]] continued via the election of Procurators, similar to the system used at the University of Glasgow, with the Chancellor having deciding vote in case of a tie. The four nations of the University were [[Angus, Scotland|Angus]], [[Marr|Mar]] (''"Marriensis"''), [[Buchan]] (''"Buchanensis"'') and [[Moray]] (''"Moraviensis"'').&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Prior to the 1858 Act, Glasgow and [[Marischal College]], one of Aberdeen's predecessor universities, were alone in making provision via the nations for election of a Rector.&lt;ref&gt;R.D. Anderson, ''The Student Community at Aberdeen 1860-1939'' (Aberdeen University Press, 1988), p.26&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor '''Obrad Stanojević''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Обрад Станојевић}}; March 28, 1934 – November 23, 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politika.rs/vesti/najnovije-vesti/Preminuo-prof-dr-Obrad-Stanojevic.sr.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=December 16, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125055728/http://www.politika.rs/vesti/najnovije-vesti/Preminuo-prof-dr-Obrad-Stanojevic.sr.html |archivedate=November 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[Emeritus professor]] and former dean of the [[University of Belgrade]]'s [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Law|Law School]], [[Serbia]]. He was a renowned expert in [[Roman law]], [[comparative law]], [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] and [[international law]], and has written extensively in these fields. Stanojević was a member of the International Advisory Board of the [[Loyola University New Orleans College of Law]] and has been associated with this law school since 1990 when he visited it as a [[Fulbright Scholar]]. He has also taught at the [[Loyola University New Orleans College of Law|Loyola College of Law]] as a [[visiting professor]] from 1994 to 1996, and he has taught in Loyola’s summer programs in [[Hungary]], [[Mexico]], and [[Russia]]. He has lectured widely at leading European universities. Together with Professor [[Sima Avramović]], he was the organizer of the prestigious [[Belgrade Competition in Oratory]]. Additionally, Stanojević was the only representative from [[Eastern Europe]] of the international review ''Revue Internationale des Droits de l’Antiquite'' – [[Brussels]].

==Early life==
Professor Obrad Stanojević was born on March 28, 1934. in Mustapić, Serbia to father Rev. Slobodan Stanojević (b. July 22, 1910. - d. July 19, 1942.) and mother Nadežda (Nada) Stanojević (née Marković, b. Sep. 30, 1910 - d. October 30, 2007.). At the time Rev. Slobodan Stanojević was temporarily stationed in Mustapić to perform his first service as a priest of Serbian Orthodox Church. Both parents are by origin from the city of Prokuplje, Serbia where they later continued to live. Obrad attended elementary school in Prokuplje, where he stayed during German occupation in World War II. Upon arrival of German army, Rev. Slobodan Stanojević became one of the local leaders (Vojvoda) of the Serbian Loyalist movement - Četniks, which successfully organized armed resistance against German troops during occupation. Rev. Slobodan Stanojevic was betrayed by his neighbour, and was assassinated in his home by communist militia on the night of July 19, 1942. Nada and Obrad Stanojević remained in Prokuplje until summer of 1947, when they moved to Belgrade. In Belgrade they lived in Dorćol district in Cara Urosa 31 street, where Obrad attended the First Gymnasium middle school (Prva Muška Gimnazija).

==Professional career==
Following his interest in sciences and social studies Obrad enrolled University of Belgrade School of Law in 1953, where he obtained LL.B. degree in 1957. After graduation Obrad became a postgraduate student at the Department of Classical Philology (Greek and Latin) of Belgrade University. He also spent several years studying abroad at Institut Universitaire des Etudes Europeennes (Turin, Italy 1960/61) and Institute of Comparative Law, New York University (1964/65). Obrad obtained his Ph.D. degree in 1964 with the thesis: “Loan and interest, Historical and Comparative Study”. By this time he became fluent in several foreign languages: English, French, Italian, Russian (in all those languages he delivered lectures), with passive knowledge of Latin, Spanish and German.

Obrad devoted most of his career teaching Roman Law and History of Law at Belgrade University School of Law where he was appointed first Associate Professor of Law and later Full Professor. He also served as Associate Dean (1980–82) and Dean (1991–92). During his professional career Obrad became one of the world’s leading scholars in Roman Law and lectured extensively around the globe. He also authored numerous scholarly articles and books that were translated in several languages. He retired from teaching at Belgrade University Law School in 1998, but remained active in the “Forum Romanum” Club, as a chief organizer of the annual student contest in rhetorics. Obrad also continued extensive teaching activities as a guest lecturer at other universities in the region and around the world.

{{Libertarian socialism}}

'''Participism''' is a [[libertarian socialist]] political philosophy consisting of two independently created economic and political systems: [[participatory economics]] or "parecon" and [[participatory politics]] or "parpolity". Participism is intended as an alternative to both [[capitalism]] and centrally-planned [[state socialism]]. Participism has significantly informed the International Organization for a Participatory Society.
{{Socialism sidebar}}

==Overview==
Advocates of participism envision remaking all of [[human]] [[society]] from the bottom up according to principles of [[Radical democracy|direct participatory democracy]] and replacing economic and social competition with cooperation. Supporters of what is termed a "participatory society" support the eventual dissolution of the centralized [[Sovereign state|state]], [[market (economics)|market]]s, and [[money]] (in its current form) placing it in the tradition of anti-authoritarian libertarian socialism. To elucidate their vision for a new society, advocates of participism categorize their aspirations into what they term a "liberating theory".

Liberating theory is a [[holistic]] framework for understanding society that looks at the whole of society and the interrelations among different parts of people's social lives. Participism groups human society into four primary "spheres", all of which are set within an international and [[ecological]] context, and each of which has a set of defining functions:

*The [[Participatory politics|political]] sphere: policy-making, administration, and collective implementation.
*The [[Participatory Economics|economic]] sphere: production, consumption, and allocation of the material means of life.
*The [[Femminism|kinship]] sphere: procreation, nurturance, socialisation, gender, sexuality, and organisation of daily home life.
*The [[Polyculturalism|community]] sphere: development of collectively shared historical identities, culture, religion, spirituality, linguistic relations, lifestyles, and social celebrations.

Within each sphere there are two components. The first component is the ''Human Centre'', the collection of people living within a society. Each person has needs, desires, personalities, characteristics, skills, capacities, and consciousness. The second component is the ''Institutional Boundary'', all of society’s social institutions that come together to form interconnected roles, relationships, and commonly held expectations and patterns of behaviour, that produce and reproduce societal outcomes. These institutions come together to help shape who people are as individuals.

===Participatory politics===

{{Main|Participatory politics}}

''Parpolity'' is the political system first proposed by [[Stephen R. Shalom]], professor of [[political science]] at William Paterson University in New Jersey. Shalom has stated that Parpolity is meant as a long range vision of where [[social justice]] should reach its apex within the field of politics and should complement the level of participation in the economy with an equal degree of participation in policy and administrative matters.
[[File:Nested council.png|thumb|right|upright=2.0|A diagram of the nested council structure.]]
The values on which parpolity is based are:
*[[Political freedom|freedom]]
*[[Workers' self-management|self-management]]
*[[justice]]
*[[solidarity]]
*and [[Toleration|tolerance]].

The goal, according to Shalom, is to create a political system that will allow people to participate, as much as possible in a direct and face to face manner. The proposed decision-making principle is that every person should have say in a decision proportionate to the degree to which she or he is affected by that decision.

The vision is critical of aspects of modern representative democracies arguing that the level of political control by the people isn't sufficient. To address this problem parpolity suggests a system of Nested Councils, which would include every adult member of a given society.

In a country or society run according to participism, there would be local councils of voting citizens consisting of 25-50 members. These local councils would be able to pass any law that affected only the local council. No higher council would be able to override the decisions of a lower council, only a council court would be able to challenge a local law on [[human rights]] grounds. The councils would be based on [[consensus]], though majority votes are allowed when issues cannot be agreed upon.

Each local council would send a delegate to a higher level council, until that council fills with 25-50 members. These second level councils would pass laws on matters that effect the 625 to 2500 citizens that it represents. A delegate to a higher level council is bound to communicate the views of her or his sending council, but is not bound to vote as the sending council might wish. Otherwise, Shalom points out that there is no point in having nested councils, and everyone might as well vote on everything. A delegate is recallable at any time by her or his sending council. Rotation of delegates would be mandatory, and delegates would be required to return to their sending councils frequently.

The second level council sends a delegate to a third level council, the third level councils send delegates to a fourth level and so on until all citizens are represented. Five levels with 50 people on every council would represent 312,500,000 voters (around the population of the United States). However, the actual number of people represented would be even higher, given that young children would not be voting. Thus, with a further sixth level nested council, the entire human population could be represented. This would not however be equatable to a global world state, but rather would involve the dissolution of all existing [[nation-states]] and their replacement with a worldwide [[confederal]] "coordinating body" made of delegates immediately recallable by the nested council below them.

Lower level councils have the opportunity to hold referendums at any time to challenge the decisions of a higher level council. This would theoretically be an easy procedure, as when a threshold of lower level councils call for a referendum, one would then be held. Shalom points out that sending every issue to lower level councils is a waste of time, as it is equivalent to [[referendum]] democracy.

There would be staff employed to help manage council affairs. Their duties would perhaps include minute taking and researching issues for the council. These council staff would work in a balanced job complex defined by a participatory economy.

===Participatory economics===

{{Main|Participatory economics}}

''Parecon (participatory economics)'' is an economic system proposed primarily by activist and political theorist [[Michael Albert]] and radical economist [[Robin Hahnel]]. It uses participatory decision making as an economic mechanism to guide the [[Production (economics)|production]], [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] and [[Resource allocation|allocation]] of resources in a given society. It is described as "an anarchistic economic vision", and a form of [[socialism]], the means of production are [[common ownership|owned in common]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} The theory is proposed as an alternative to both contemporary capitalist market economies and centrally planned socialism. It distinguishes between two parts of the working class. The 'coordinator class' that does the conceptual, creative and managerial work and the rest of the class doing rote work. This situation is deemed 'coordinatorism', which the theory claims it to be a major flaw with [[Marxism]].{{r|looking|p=4-8}}

The underlying values that parecon seeks to implement are equity, solidarity, diversity, [[workers' self-management]] and efficiency. (Efficiency here means accomplishing goals without wasting valued assets.) It proposes to attain these ends mainly through the following principles and institutions:
* [[Workers councils|workers' and consumers' councils]] utilizing self-managerial methods for making decisions,
* balanced job complexes,
* remuneration according to effort and sacrifice, and
* [[Economic democracy|participatory planning]].

In place of money parecon would have a form of currency in which [[Labour voucher|personal vouchers]] or "credits" would be awarded for work done to purchase goods and services. Unlike money, credits would disappear upon purchase, and would be non-transferable between individuals, making bribery and monetary theft impossible. Also, the only items or services with a price attached would most likely be those considered wants or non-essentials and anything deemed a need would be completely free of charge (e.g.: health care, public transportation).

Albert and Hahnel have stressed that parecon is only meant to address an alternative ''economic'' theory and must be accompanied by equally important alternative visions in the fields of politics, culture and kinship. The authors have also discussed elements of [[social anarchism]] in the field of politics, [[polyculturalism]] in the field of culture, and [[feminism]] in the field of family/kinship and gender relations as being possible foundations for future alternative visions in these other spheres of society. Since the publication of Albert's book "Parecon", other thinkers have come forward and incorporated these concepts which have rounded participism into a more fully formed political and social ideology.

===Feminist kinship===
''See also [[Nurture kinship]] and [[Free love]]''

Outside of both political and economic relations there still exists the sphere of human kinship. Participism sees this as a vital component in a liberated society and applies feminist principles to this aspect of human relations. Feminist kinship relations are seen to seek to free people from oppressive definitions that have been socially imposed and to abolish all sexual divisions of labour and [[sexist]] and [[heterosexist]] demarcation of individuals according to gender and sexuality.

Participism holds that a participatory society must be respectful on an individual’s nature, inclinations, and choices and all people must be provided with the means to pursue the lives they want regardless of their gender, sexual orientation, or age. Feminist kinship relations are dependent on the liberation of women, [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] persons, youth, the elderly, and intersex ([[true hermaphroditism|hermaphroditic]] and [[pseudohermaphroditism|pseudohermaphroditic]]) individuals.

To extend liberation into daily home life, a participatory society aims to provide the means for traditional couples, single parents, [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexuality|bisexual]], [[transsexualism|transsexual]], [[transgender]], and [[intersex]] parents, communal parenting, [[polygamy]] (especially [[polyandry]]), [[polyamory|polyamorous]] and multiple parenting arrangements to develop and flourish. It is believed that within the home and the community, the task of raising children must be elevated in status. Highly personalised interaction between children and adults should be encouraged, and responsibilities for these interactions must be distributed equitably throughout society without segregating tasks by gender. A participatory society would provide parents with access to high quality day-care, flexible work hours, and parental leave options allowing them to play a more active role in the lives of their children.

The liberation of women and society from patriarchal and [[heteronormativity|heteronormative]] oppression, according to participism, requires total reproductive freedom. Society must provide all members with the right to family planning, without shame or guilt for performing or soliciting an abortion or for engaging in alternative sexual behavior and without fear of sterilization or economic deprivation; the right to have or not to have children and to terminate undesired pregnancies through unhindered access to [[birth control]] and unregulated [[abortion]], respectively; and the right to comprehensive sexual education and [[healthcare]] that provide every citizen with information and resources to live a healthy and fulfilling sex life.

In such [[sex-positivity|sex-positive]] participatory societies the full exploration of human sexuality, with the possible exception of [[child sexuality]], would be accepted and embraced as normative. Participism encourages the exercise of and experimentation of different forms of sexuality by consenting partners.

===Polycultural community===
Human society is held to have long and brutal history of conquest, [[colonisation]], [[genocide]], and slavery which cannot be transcended easily. To begin the step-by-step process of building a new historical legacy and set of behavioural expectations between [[community|communities]], a participatory society would construct intercommunalist institutions to provide communities with the means to assure the preservation of their diverse cultural traditions and to allow for their continual development. With [[Polyculturalism|polycultural]] intercommunalism, all material and psychological privileges that are currently granted to a section of the population at the expense of the dignity and standards of living for oppressed communities, as well as the division of communities into subservient positions according to culture, ethnicity, nationality, and religion, will be dissolved.
 
The multiplicity of cultural communities and the historical contributions of different communities would be respected, valued, and preserved by guaranteeing each sufficient material and communicative means to reproduce, self-define, develop their own cultural traditions, and represent their culture to all other communities. Through construction of intercommunalist relations and institutions that guarantee each community the means necessary to carry on and develop their traditions, a pariticipatory society assists eliminating negative inter-community relations and encourages positive interaction between communities that can enhance the internal characteristics of each.
 
In a participatory society, individuals would be free to choose the cultural communities they prefer and members of every community would have the right of dissent and to leave. Intervention would not be permitted except to preserve this right for all. Those outside a community would also be free to criticize cultural practices that they believe violate acceptable social norms, but the majority would not have the power to impose its will on a vulnerable minority.

==Criticisms==

===Anarchism===
Certain [[anarchism|anarchists]] of the libcom community (an internet community of [[Anarcho-communism|libertarian communists]]) have criticized the [[parpolity]] aspect of participism for deciding beforehand the scale and scope of the councils whilst only practice, they argue, can accurately indicate the size and scale of anarchist confederations and other organizational platforms, especially since each region is unique with unique residents and unique solutions and unique wants. Anarchists argue that such blueprints containing detailed information are either dangerous or pointless. Furthermore, some anarchists have criticized the potential use of referendums to challenge decisions taken by higher councils as this implies both a top-down structure and an absence of [[participatory democracy|vis-à-vis democracy]] as they argue that referendums are not participatory.&lt;ref name="libcom1"&gt;[http://libcom.org/library/participatory-society-or-libertarian-communism Parecon or libertarian communism?]. libcom.org. Retrieved on 2013-07-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

They have also criticized the enforcement of laws passed by councils rather than the use of supposed voluntary custom or [[customary law]] which develops through mutual recognition rather than being enforced by an external authority, as they argue the laws passed by such councils would need to be.&lt;ref name="libcom1"/&gt;

===Capitalism===
The [[criticism of socialism]] could be applied to participism as well, as advocates of capitalism object to the absence of a market and [[private property]] in a hypothetical participatory society. However, in a debate with David Horowitz, Michael Albert argued that those criticisms could not apply to parecon, as it was especially designed to take them into account. New specific criticisms should then be formulated. For instance, in an answer to the comments of David Kotz and John O'Neill about one of their articles on the subject, Albert and Hahnel assert that they designed parecon understanding "that knowledge is distributed unequally throughout society",&lt;ref&gt;Albert, Michael and Robin Hahnel. 2002. "Reply". In ''Science and Society'', vol. 66, no. 1, p. 26, [online]. http://gesd.free.fr/albert.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; hypothetically answering to the famous criticisms of Friedrich Von Hayek on the possibility of planning.

In [[cryptanalysis]] and [[computer security]], '''password cracking''' is the process of recovering [[password]]s from [[data (computing)|data]] that have been stored in or transmitted by a [[computer system]]. A common approach ([[brute-force attack]]) is to  try guesses repeatedly for the password and check them against an available [[cryptographic hash function|cryptographic hash]] of the password.&lt;ref name="MM1"&gt;{{cite web| last=Montoro|first=Massimiliano| title=Brute-Force Password Cracker| url=http://www.oxid.it/ca_um/topics/brute-force_password_cracker.htm| publisher=Oxid.it| accessdate=August 13, 2013| year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of password cracking might be to help a user recover a forgotten password (installing an entirely new password is less of a security risk, but it involves System Administration privileges), to gain unauthorized access to a system, or as a preventive measure by [[system administrator]]s to check for easily crackable passwords. On a file-by-file basis, password cracking is utilized to gain access to digital evidence for which a judge has allowed access but the particular file's access is restricted.

==Time needed for password searches==

The time to crack a password is related to bit strength (''see'' [[password strength]]), which is a measure of the password's [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]], and the details of how the password is stored. Most methods of password cracking require the computer to produce many candidate passwords, each of which is checked. One example is [[Brute-force attack|brute-force cracking]], in which a computer tries ''every'' possible key or password until it succeeds. More common methods of password cracking, such as [[dictionary attack]]s, pattern checking, word list substitution, etc. attempt to reduce the number of trials required and will usually be attempted before brute force. Higher password bit strength exponentially increases the number of candidate passwords that must be checked, on average, to recover the password and reduces the likelihood that the password will be found in any cracking dictionary.&lt;ref name="SS1"&gt;{{cite web| last=Lundin|first=Leigh |title= PINs and Passwords, Part 2 | url=http://www.sleuthsayers.org/2013/08/pins-and-passwords-part-2.html |work=Passwords| publisher=SleuthSayers| location=Orlando| date=August 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability to crack passwords using computer programs is also a function of the number of possible passwords per second which can be checked. If a hash of the target password is available to the attacker, this number can be in the billions or trillions per second, since an ''offline attack'' is possible. If not, the rate depends on whether the authentication software limits how often a password can be tried, either by time delays, [[CAPTCHA]]s, or forced lockouts after some number of failed attempts. Another situation where quick guessing is possible is when the password is used to form a [[cryptographic key]]. In such cases, an attacker can quickly check to see if a guessed password successfully decodes encrypted data.

For some kinds of password hash, ordinary desktop computers can test over a hundred million passwords per second using password cracking tools running on a general purpose CPU and billions of passwords per second using GPU-based password cracking tools&lt;ref&gt;[http://hashcat.net/oclhashcat-lite/ oclHashcat-lite – advanced password recovery].

Retrieved on 2013-01-31.&lt;/ref&gt;  The rate of password guessing depends heavily on the cryptographic function used by the system to generate password hashes.  A suitable password hashing function, such as [[bcrypt]], is many orders of magnitude better than a naive function like simple [[MD5]] or [[Secure Hash Algorithm|SHA]].  A user-selected eight-character password with numbers, mixed case, and symbols, with commonly selected passwords and other dictionary matches filtered out, reaches an estimated 30-bit strength, according to NIST. 2&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt; is only one billion permutations&lt;ref name=NIST&gt;{{cite web | url = http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-63/SP800-63V1_0_2.pdf | title = Electronic Authentication Guideline | format = PDF | publisher = NIST | accessdate = March 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and would be cracked in seconds if the hashing function is naive.  When ordinary desktop computers are combined in a cracking effort, as can be done with [[botnet]]s, the capabilities of password cracking are considerably extended. In 2002, [[distributed.net]] successfully found a 64-bit [[RC5]] key in four years, in an effort which included over 300,000 different computers at various times, and which generated an average of over 12 billion keys per second.&lt;ref name=distributed&gt;{{cite web | url = http://stats.distributed.net/projects.php?project_id=5 | title = 64-bit key project status | publisher = Distributed.net | accessdate = March 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Graphics processor]]s can speed up password cracking by a factor of 50 to 100 over general purpose computers.  As of 2011, available commercial products claim the ability to test up to 2,800,000,000 passwords a second on a standard desktop computer using a high-end graphics processor.&lt;ref name=elcomsoft&gt;[http://www.elcomsoft.com/eprb.html#gpu [[ElcomSoft]] Password Recovery Speed table], [[NTLM]] passwords, [[Nvidia Tesla]] S1070 GPU, accessed February 1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Such a device can crack a 10 letter single-case password in one day. The work can be distributed over many computers for an additional speedup proportional to the number of available computers with comparable GPUs.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

Despite their capabilities, desktop CPUs are slower at cracking passwords than purpose-built password breaking machines. In 1998, the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF) built a dedicated password cracker using [[ASICs]], as opposed to general purpose CPUs. Their machine, [[EFF DES cracker|Deep Crack]], broke a DES 56-bit key in 56 hours, testing over 90 billion keys per second.&lt;ref name=EFF-deep-crack&gt;{{cite web | url = http://w2.eff.org/Privacy/Crypto/Crypto_misc/DESCracker/HTML/19980716_eff_descracker_pressrel.html | title = EFF DES Cracker machine brings honesty to crypto debate | publisher = EFF | accessdate = March 27, 2008 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100101001853/http://w2.eff.org/Privacy/Crypto/Crypto_misc/DESCracker/HTML/19980716_eff_descracker_pressrel.html | archivedate = January 1, 2010 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2010, the [[Georgia Tech Research Institute]] developed a method of using [[GPGPU]] to crack passwords, coming up with a minimum secure password length of 12 characters.&lt;ref name="gtri"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.rh.gatech.edu/news/341201/teraflop-troubles-power-graphics-processing-units-may-threaten-worlds-password-security | title=Teraflop Troubles: The Power of Graphics Processing Units May Threaten the World's Password Security System|publisher=[[Georgia Tech Research Institute]]|accessdate=November 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="msnbc"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/38771772/| title=Want to deter hackers?

==Easy to remember, hard to guess==

Passwords that are difficult to remember will reduce the security of a system because (a) users might need to write down or electronically store the password using an insecure method, (b) users will need frequent password resets and (c) users are more likely to re-use the same password. Similarly, the more stringent requirements for password strength, e.g. "have a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters and digits" or "change it monthly", the greater the degree to which users will subvert the system.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110126220702/http://all.net/journal/netsec/1997-09.html Managing Network Security]. Fred Cohen &amp; Associates. All.net. Retrieved on January 31, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In "The Memorability and Security of Passwords",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.comp.lancs.ac.uk/~yanj2/jyan_ieee_pwd.pdf |title=Password Memorability and Security: Empirical Results |doi=10.1109/MSP.2004.81|year=2004|last1=Yan|first1=J.|last2=Blackwell|first2=A.|last3=Anderson|first3=R.|last4=Grant|first4=A.|journal=IEEE Security &amp; Privacy Magazine|volume=2|issue=5|pages=25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeff Yan et al. examines the effect of advice given to users about a good choice of password. They found that passwords based on thinking of a phrase and taking the first letter of each word are just as memorable as naively selected passwords, and just as hard to crack as randomly generated passwords. Combining two unrelated words is another good method. Having a personally designed "[[algorithm]]" for generating obscure passwords is another good method.

However, asking users to remember a password consisting of a "mix of uppercase and lowercase characters" is similar to asking them to remember a sequence of bits: hard to remember, and only a little bit harder to crack (e.g. only 128 times harder to crack for 7-letter passwords, less if the user simply capitalizes one of the letters). Asking users to use "both letters and digits" will often lead to easy-to-guess substitutions such as 'E' → '3' and 'I' → '1', substitutions which are well known to attackers. Similarly typing the password one keyboard row higher is a common trick known to attackers.

Research detailed in an April 2015 paper by several professors at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] shows that people's choices of password structure often follow several known patterns. As a result, passwords may be much more easily cracked than their mathematical probabilities would otherwise indicate. Passwords containing one digit, for example, disproportionately include it at the end of the password.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=New Technology Cracks 'Strong' Passwords – What You Need To Know |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/josephsteinberg/2015/04/21/new-technology-cracks-long-complex-passwords-what-you-need-to-know/ |work=Forbes |first=Joseph |last=Steinberg |authorlink=Joseph Steinberg |date=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incidents==
On July 16, 1998, [[CERT Coordination Center|CERT]] reported an incident where an attacker had found 186,126 encrypted passwords. By the time they were discovered, they had already cracked 47,642 passwords.&lt;ref name="CERT IN-98.03"&gt;{{cite web

In December 2009, a major password breach of the [[RockYou|Rockyou.com]] website occurred that led to the release of 32 million passwords. The  attacker then leaked the full list of the 32 million passwords (with no other identifiable information) to the internet. Passwords were stored in cleartext in the database and were extracted through a SQL Injection vulnerability. The [[Imperva]] Application Defense Center (ADC) did an analysis on the strength of the passwords.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imperva.com/docs/WP_Consumer_Password_Worst_Practices.pdf |title=Consumer Password Worst Practices}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, [[NATO]] (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) experienced a security breach that led to the public release of first and last names, usernames, and passwords for more than 11,000 registered users of their e-bookshop. The data were leaked as part of [[Operation AntiSec]], a movement that includes [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]], [[LulzSec]], as well as other hacking groups and individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/06/24/nato_hack_attack/ |accessdate = July 24, 2011 |title=NATO Hack Attack}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 11, 2011, [[Booz Allen Hamilton]], a large American Consulting firm that does a substantial amount of work for [[the Pentagon]], had their servers hacked by [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] and leaked the same day. "The leak, dubbed 'Military Meltdown Monday,' includes 90,000 logins of military personnel—including personnel from [[United States Central Command|USCENTCOM]], [[United States Special Operations Command|SOCOM]], the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]], various [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] facilities, [[Homeland Security]], [[United States State Department|State Department]] staff, and what looks like private sector contractors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://gizmodo.com/5820049/anonymous-leaks-90000-military-email-accounts-in-latest-antisec-attack |title=Anonymous Leaks 90,000 Military Email Accounts in Latest Antisec Attack |date=July 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These leaked passwords wound up being hashed with [[salt (cryptography)|unsalted]] [[SHA-1]], and were later analyzed by the ADC team at [[Imperva]], revealing that even some military personnel used passwords as weak as "1234".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://blog.imperva.com/2011/07/military-password-analysis.html  |title=Military Password Analysis |date= July 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 18, 2011, Microsoft Hotmail banned the password: "123456".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.imperva.com/2011/07/microsofts-hotmail-bans-123456.html |title=Microsoft's Hotmail Bans 123456 |date=July 18, 2011 |work=Imperva |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327010416/http://blog.imperva.com/2011/07/microsofts-hotmail-bans-123456.html |archivedate=March 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015, a group calling itself "The Impact Team" [[Ashley Madison data breach|stole the user data of Ashley Madison]]. Many passwords were hashed using both the relatively strong [[bcrypt]] algorithm and the weaker MD5 hash. Attacking the latter algorithm allowed some 11 million plaintext passwords to be recovered.

==Prevention==
The best method of preventing a password from being cracked is to ensure that attackers cannot get access even to the hashed password. For example, on the [[Unix]] [[operating system]], hashed passwords were originally stored in a publicly accessible file &lt;tt&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/tt&gt;. On modern Unix (and similar) systems, on the other hand, they are stored in the [[shadow password]] file &lt;tt&gt;/etc/shadow&lt;/tt&gt;, which is accessible only to programs running with enhanced privileges (i.e., "system" privileges). This makes it harder for a malicious user to obtain the hashed passwords in the first instance, however many collections of password hashes have been stolen despite such protection.  Another strong approach is to combine a site-specific secret key with the password hash, which prevents plaintext password recovery even if the hashed values are purloined. A third approach is to use [[key derivation function]]s that reduce the rate at which passwords can be guessed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-63b | title = SP 800-63B-3 – Digital Identity Guidelines, Authentication and Lifecycle Management | format = PDF | publisher = NIST | date = June 2017 | accessdate = August 6, 2017 | doi=10.6028/NIST.SP.800-63b | last1 = Grassi | first1 = Paul A}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5.1.1.2}}
Unfortunately, many common Network Protocols transmit passwords in cleartext or use weak challenge/response schemes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.usenix.org/publications/login/2001-11/pdfs/singer.pdf |title=No Plaintext Passwords |journal=;login: |date=November 2001 |volume=26 |issue=7 |pages=83–91 |author=Singer, Abe |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060924002626/http://www.usenix.org/publications/login/2001-11/pdfs/singer.pdf |archivedate=September 24, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schneier.com/paper-pptp.html Cryptanalysis of Microsoft's Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol]. Schneier.com (July 7, 2011). Retrieved on 2013-01-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Unix Systems have replaced traditional [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]]-based password hashing function [[Crypt (C)|crypt()]] with stronger methods such as [[bcrypt]] and [[scrypt]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usenix.org/events/usenix99/provos.html A Future-Adaptable Password Scheme]. Usenix.org (March 13, 2002). Retrieved on 2013-01-31.&lt;/ref&gt; Other systems have also begun to adopt these methods.  For instance, the Cisco IOS originally used a reversible [[Vigenère cipher]] to encrypt passwords, but now uses md5-crypt with a 24-bit [[Salt (cryptography)|salt]] when the "enable secret" command is used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://c3rb3r.openwall.net/mdcrack/download/FAQ-18.txt MDCrack FAQ 1.8]. None. Retrieved on January 31, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; These newer methods use large salt values which prevent attackers from efficiently mounting offline attacks against multiple user accounts simultaneously.  The algorithms are also much slower to execute which drastically increases the time required to mount a successful offline attack.&lt;ref name="usenix.org"&gt;[http://www.usenix.org/publications/login/2004-06/pdfs/alexander.pdf Password Protection for Modern Operating Systems]. Usenix.org. Retrieved on January 31, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many hashes used for storing passwords, such as [[MD5]] and the [[Secure Hash Algorithm (disambiguation)|SHA]] family, are designed for fast computation and efficient implementation in hardware. As a result, they are ineffective in preventing password cracking, especially with methods like [[rainbow table]]s. Using [[key stretching]] Algorithms, such as [[PBKDF2]], to form password hashes can significantly reduce the rate at which passwords can be tested.

Solutions like a [[security token]] give a [[formal proof]] answer by constantly shifting password. Those solutions abruptly reduce the timeframe for [[Brute-force attack|brute forcing]] (attacker needs to break and use the password within a single shift) and they reduce the value of the stolen passwords because of its short time validity.

In 2013 a long-term [[Password Hashing Competition]] was announced to choose a new, standard algorithm for password hashing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://password-hashing.net/call.html | title=Password Hashing Competition | accessdate=March 3, 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902044128/https://password-hashing.net/call.html | archivedate=September 2, 2013 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Software==
{{maincat|Password cracking software}}

There are many password cracking software tools, but the most popular&lt;ref name="sectools-top-10"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sectools.org/tag/pass-audit/ | accessdate=November 1, 2009 |title=Top 10 Password Crackers |publisher=Sectools }}&lt;/ref&gt; are [[Aircrack]], [[Cain (software)|Cain and Abel]], [[John the Ripper]], [[Hashcat]], [[Hydra (software)|Hydra]], [[DaveGrohl (software)|DaveGrohl]] and [[ElcomSoft]]. Many [[computer forensics|litigation support software]] packages also include password cracking functionality. Most of these packages employ a mixture of cracking strategies, algorithm with brute force and dictionary attacks proving to be the most productive.

:''For the agreement between prosecutor and defendant, see [[proffer letter]].''

A '''proffer''' is an offer made prior to any formal negotiations.

In a trial, to '''proffer''' (sometimes '''profer''') is to offer [[evidence (law)|evidence]] in support of an [[Logical argument|argument]], or elements of an [[affirmative defense]] or offense. A party with the [[legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] must proffer sufficient evidence to carry that burden. For example, in support of a particular argument, a party may proffer [[documentary evidence]] or [[witnesses]].

Where a party is denied the right to introduce evidence because that evidence would be inflammatory, [[hearsay]], or would lack sufficient [[authentication (law)|authentication]], that party must make a proffer of what the evidence would have shown in order to preserve the issue for [[appeal]].

As in business, a proffer can be a sign of  "good faith" a first offer or proposal, to show a willingness to "barter".

*see [[Implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing|good faith bargaining]], [[barter]].

==Etymology==

The word '''proffer''' is derived from Anglo-French "por-", forth, and offrir, to offer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/proffer|title=Definition of proffer from the Merriam-Webster dictionary|accessdate=2009-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Thomson Reuters Corp sold a 55-percent majority stake in its Financial &amp; Risk (F&amp;R) unit to private equity firm Blackstone Group LP on October 1, 2018, in a deal which valued the total F&amp;R business at about $20 billion. This business was formed into Refinitiv.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Operations==

Under the deal, Thomson Reuters transferred its complete Financial and Risk product portfolio to Refinitiv, with the exception of Regulatory Intelligence, Risk Compliance Learning and Data Privacy Advisory Services. 

Refinitiv's [[FinTech]] data, analytics, trading, and risk assessment tools include [[FXall]], [[Eikon|Eikon Messenger]], Auto Audit and the Elektron Data Platform creating 32,000 risk intelligence records every month from internal and third-party sources. Another, the [https://www.refinitiv.com/en/products/world-check-kyc-screening World-Check Risk Intelligence database], compiles information from international financial watch lists, government records, and media searches to tackle [[Money Laundering]].

Although Thomson Reuters is now a minority shareholder in Refinitiv, it still supplies Reuters news and content to the company's 400,000 plus customers in more than 40,000 businesses around the world, supported by a network of at least 13,000 registered developers.

The '''Sicilian Parliament''' was the [[legislature]] of the  [[Kingdom of Sicily]].

==History==
The Sicilian Parliament is arguably considered one of the oldest parliaments in the world and the first legislature in the modern sense.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sites.google.com/site/ilparlamento02/storia-del-parlamento Storia del Parlamento - Il Parlamento]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Enzo Gancitano, ''Mazara dopo i Musulmani fino alle Signorie - Dal Vescovado all'Inquisizione'', Angelo Mazzotta Editore, 2001, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Castello Ursino - Sala dei Parlamenti.jpg|thumb|''Sala dei Parlamenti'' (Parliaments Hall), establishment of the Sicilian Parliament in the Aragonese time.]]

In 1097 came the first conference in [[Mazara del Vallo]] convened by [[Roger I of Sicily|Roger I]] the Great Count of a parliament initially travelling. The Sicilian Parliament was made up of three branches: from feudalism, from the Ecclesiastical and from the State Property.  The feudal branch was formed by nobles representatives of counties and baronies, the ecclesiastical branch was formed by [[archbishop]]s, [[bishop]]s, [[abbot]]s and [[archimandrite]]s, while the state-owned branch was formed by representatives of 42 autonomous towns in Sicily. The first Norman parliament was not a deliberative, and had only an advisory function and confirmation of the sovereign, especially in taxation, economics and wars. Members were chosen from the more powerful nobles.

Since 1130 meetings are held in the [[Palazzo dei Normanni]], in [[Palermo]]. First radical change came with [[Frederick II of Swabia]], which allowed the access part to civil society.
After a period in the background during the reign of [[Anjou]], the Parliament became the central focus of the organization of the [[Sicilian Vespers]]. On 3 April 1282, during the uprising, the red and yellow flag with the center triscele was adopted by Parliament: today is the [[flag of Sicily]]. With the Vespers and the subsequent settlement of [[Frederick III of Sicily|Frederick III]] of Aragon in 1297, the Assembly strengthened its central role.  This was the time that the permanent establishment of the Parliament was in the [[Castello Ursino]], in [[Catania]], at the ''Sala dei Parlamenti'' (Parliaments Hall).  At this time consisted primarily of landowners, mayors of cities from the counts and barons, was chaired and convened by the king. Parliament had the constitutional responsibility to elect the king and to perform the function of body guaranteeing the proper conduct of ordinary justice exercised by executioners, judges, notaries and other officials of the kingdom.

In 1410 the Sicilian Parliament held at [[Palazzo Corvaja]] of [[Taormina]], in the presence of Queen [[Blanche I of Navarre]], a historic meeting for the election of the [[King of Sicily]] after the death of [[Martin II]].  With the successive kings of Aragon, Sicily lost its political autonomy and a [[viceroy]] ruled the island. With [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] in 1532 was again summoned a parliament in Palermo, which also continued to meet under [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]], preserving its authority.

In Sicily the [[Bourbons]] ruled from [[Naples]] and found himself the function of Parliament is greatly reduced gradually until the [[Sicilian revolution of 1848|revolution followed the riots of 1848]], when it regained its centrality. 
[[File:Bilderrevolution0222.jpg|thumb|Popular revolt in front of the Sicilian parliament in 1848]]
In fact, Palermo, 25 March of that year, met the General Parliament of Sicily, with a revolutionary government composed of a president and ministers from the president himself eligible. [[Vincenzo Fardella di Torrearsa|Vincenzo Fardella]] of Torrearsa and then [[Ruggero Settimo]] were elected president: declared void the Bourbon dynasty and offered the vacant throne of Sicily to the [[Duke of Genoa]], the second son of [[Carlo Alberto of Savoy]], who would not.  The life of the Parliament of 1848-49 lasted briefly and already the so-called Gaeta decree of 28 February 1849 [[Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies]] began to take possession of Sicily, and 14 May the assize was dissolved.

Reconstitution of the Parliament came at the end of [[World War II]], when for the vast defuse separatist movement in Sicily, was granted special autonomy and was reborn, 25 May 1947, in Palermo, as [[Sicilian Regional Assembly]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30056">In law, '''standing''' or '''''locus standi''''' is the term for the ability of a party to demonstrate to the [[court]] sufficient connection to and harm from the law or action challenged to support that party's participation in the case. Standing exists from one of three causes:
# The party is directly subject to an adverse effect by the statute or action in question, and the harm suffered will continue unless the court grants relief in the form of damages or a finding that the law either does not apply to the party or that the law is void or can be nullified. This is called the "something to lose" doctrine, in which the party has standing because they will be directly harmed by the conditions for which they are asking the court for relief.
# The party is not directly harmed by the conditions by which they are petitioning the court for relief but asks for it because the harm involved has some reasonable relation to their situation, and the continued existence of the harm may affect others who might not be able to ask a court for relief. In the United States, this is the grounds for asking for a law to be struck down as violating the [[First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States|First Amendment]], because while the plaintiff might not be directly affected, the law might so adversely affect others that one might never know what was not done or created by those who fear they would become subject to the law – the so-called "[[chilling effect|chilling effects]]" doctrine.
# The party is granted automatic standing by act of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Evan|last2=Mason Ellis|first2=Josephine|title=The Standing Doctrine's Dirty Little Secret|journal=Northwestern Law Review|date=December 3, 2012|volume=107|pages=169|ssrn=2027130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under some environmental laws in the United States, a party may sue someone causing pollution to certain waterways without a federal permit, even if the party suing is not harmed by the pollution being generated. The law allows them to receive attorney's fees if they substantially prevail in the action. In some U.S. states, a person who believes a book, film or other work of art is obscene may sue in their own name to have the work banned directly without having to ask a District Attorney to do so.

In the United States, the current doctrine is that a person cannot bring a suit challenging the [[United States constitutional law|constitutionality]] of a law unless the [[plaintiff]] can demonstrate that he/it is or will "imminently" be harmed by the law. Otherwise, the court will rule that the plaintiff "lacks standing" to bring the suit, and will dismiss the case without considering the merits of the claim of unconstitutionality. To have a court declare a law unconstitutional, there must be a valid reason for the lawsuit. The party suing must have something to lose in order to sue unless it has automatic standing by action of law.

==International courts==
The [[Council of Europe]] created the first international court before which individuals have automatic ''locus standi''.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Rhona K. M., ''Textbook on International Human Rights''. 4th Edition.  2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==
In [[Canada|Canadian]] [[administrative procedure law|administrative law]], whether an individual has standing to bring an application for judicial review, or an appeal from the decision of a tribunal, is governed by the language of the particular statute under which the application or the appeal is brought. Some statutes provide for a narrow right of standing while others provide for a broader right of standing.&lt;ref&gt;For example, under s. 18(1) the ''Federal Court Act'', an application for review may be made by "anyone directly affected by the matter in respect of which the relief is sought".&lt;/ref&gt;

Frequently a litigant wishes to bring a [[civil action]] for a [[declaratory judgment]] against a public body or official. This is considered an aspect of administrative law, sometimes with a constitutional dimension, as when the litigant seeks to have legislation declared unconstitutional.

===Public interest standing===
The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] developed the concept of public interest standing in three constitutional cases commonly called "the Standing trilogy": ''[[Thorson v. Attorney General of Canada]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Thorson v. Attorney General of Canada]]'', [1975] 1 S.C.R. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Nova Scotia Board of Censors v. McNeil]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Nova Scotia Board of Censors v. McNeil]]'', [1976] 2 S.C.R. 265.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Minister of Justice v. Borowski]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Minister of Justice v. Borowski]]'', [1981] 2 S.C.R. 575.&lt;/ref&gt; The trilogy was summarized as follows in ''[[Canadian Council of Churches v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration)]]'':&lt;ref&gt;''[[Canadian Council of Churches v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration)]]'', [1992] 1 S.C.R. 236&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|It has been seen that when public interest standing is sought, consideration must be given to three aspects. First, is there a serious issue raised as to the invalidity of legislation in question? Second, has it been established that the plaintiff is directly affected by the legislation or if not does the plaintiff have a genuine interest in its validity? Third, is there another reasonable and effective way to bring the issue before the court?&lt;ref&gt;http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/1992/1992rcs1-236/1992rcs1-236.html&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Public-interest standing is also available in non-constitutional cases, as the Court found in ''Finlay v. Canada (Minister of Finance)''.&lt;ref&gt;''Finlay v. Canada (Minister of Finance)'', [1986] 2 S.C.R. 607 [http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/1986/1986rcs2-607/1986rcs2-607.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
In British administrative law, the applicant needs to have a sufficient interest in the matter to which the application relates.&lt;ref&gt;Senior Courts Act 1981 s.31(3).&lt;/ref&gt; This sufficient interest requirement has been construed liberally by the courts. As [[Lord Diplock]] put it:&lt;ref&gt;''Inland Revenue Commissioners Appellants v National Federation of Self-Employed and Small Businesses Ltd. Respondents'' [1982] A.C. 617.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[i]t would&amp;nbsp;... be a grave danger to escape ''[[Lacuna (law)|lacuna]]'' in our system of public law if a pressure group&amp;nbsp;... or even a single public spirited taxpayer, were prevented by outdated technical rules of ''locus standi'' from bringing the matter to the attention of the court to vindicate the rule of law and get the unlawful conduct stopped.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the [[English law of contract|law of contract]], the doctrine of [[privity]] meant that only those who were party to a contract could sue or be sued upon it.&lt;ref&gt; ''[[Tweddle v Atkinson]]'', ''[[Dunlop v Selfridge]]'', ''[[Beswick v Beswick]]''&lt;/ref&gt; This doctrine was substantially amended by the [[Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999]]. which allows beneficiaries under a contract to enforce it.

Almost all criminal prosecutions are brought by the state via the [[Crown Prosecution Service]], so private prosecutions are rare. An exception was the case of [[Whitehouse v Lemon]] where [[Mary Whitehouse|Mrs Mary Whitehouse]], a self-appointed guardian of suburban morality, was permitted to bring a private prosecution for "[[blasphemous libel]]" against the publisher of ''[[Gay News]]'', [[Denis Lemon]].&lt;ref&gt;''Whitehouse v Lemon'' 2 WLR 281 [https://www.swarb.co.uk/c/hl/1979Whitehouse-GayNews.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Victims of crime have standing to sue the perpetrator and they may claim [[Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority|criminal injuries compensation]] from the state. If the state fails properly to bring a case, the victim or his family mayhave standing to bring a private prosecution, as in the case of [[Murder of Stephen Lawrence|Stephen Lawrence]].

Australia has a [[Common law]] understanding of ''locus standi'' or standing which is expressed in [[statute]]s such as the [[Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977]] and common law decisions of the [[High Court of Australia]] especially the case ''Australian Conservation Foundation v Commonwealth'' (1980).&lt;ref name="ACF"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|53|1980|litigants=Australian Conservation Foundation v Commonwealth |parallelcite=(1980) 146 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 493 |coutname=auto |date=13 February 1980}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At common law, the test for standing is whether the plaintiff has a 'special interest in the subject matter of the action'.&lt;ref name="ACF"/&gt; Under the ''Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act'' 1977 to have standing the applicant must be ‘a person who is aggrieved’,&lt;ref name="ADJR s5"&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|adra1977396|Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977|5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; defined as ‘a person whose interests are adversely affected’ by the decision or conduct complained of.&lt;ref name="ADJR s3"&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|adra1977396|Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977|3}}(4).&lt;/ref&gt; This has generally been interpreted in accordance with the common law test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|FCA|1060|1995|litigants=Right To Life Association (NSW) Inc  v Secretary, Department of Human Services and Health and Family Planning Inc (Vic) |parallelcite=(1995) 128 [[Australian Law Reports|ALR]] 238 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
{{US fed civ pro}}
In [[United States law]], the [[Supreme Court of the United States of America|Supreme Court]] has stated, "In essence the question of standing is whether the [[litigant]] is entitled to have the court decide the merits of the dispute or of particular issues."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Warth v. Seldin]]'', 422 U.S. 490, 498 (1975).&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of requirements that a plaintiff must establish to have standing before a federal court. Some are based on the [[case or controversy]] requirement of the judicial power of [[Article Three of the United States Constitution]], [[Article III of the Constitution of the United States#Powers|§ 2, cl.1]]. As stated there, "The Judicial Power shall extend to all Cases . . .[and] to Controversies . . ." The requirement that a plaintiff have standing to sue is a limit on the role of the judiciary and the law of Article III standing is built on the idea of separation of powers.&lt;ref name=AllenvWright&gt;{{ussc|name=Allen v. Wright|volume=468|page=737|pin=752|year=1984}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Federal courts may exercise power only "in the last resort, and as a necessity".&lt;ref name=AllenvWright/&gt;

The [[United States|American]] doctrine of standing is assumed as having begun with the case of ''[[Frothingham v. Mellon]]''.&lt;ref name=Frothingham&gt;{{ussc|name=Frothingham v. Mellon|volume=262|page=447|pin=|year=1923}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, legal standing truly rests its first prudential origins in ''[[Fairchild v. Hughes]]'', (1922) which was authored by Justice Brandeis.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Fairchild v. Hughes|volume=258|page=126 |pin=|year=1922}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Fairchild'', a citizen sued the Secretary of State and the Attorney General to challenge the procedures by which the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]] was ratified. Prior to it, the doctrine was that all persons had a right to pursue a private prosecution of a public right.&lt;ref&gt;''The Metaphor of Standing and the Problem of Self-Governance'', by Steven L. Winter, 40 ''Stan. L. Rev.'' 1371, July, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the doctrine has been embedded in [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure|judicial rules]] and some statutes.

In 2011, in ''[[Bond v. United States (2011)|Bond v. United States]]'', the U.S. Supreme Court held that a criminal defendant charged with violating a federal statute does have standing to challenge the constitutionality of that statute under the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Bond v. United States|link=Bond v. United States (2011)|volume=564|page=211|pin=|year=2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Standing requirements===
There are three standing requirements:

# '''Injury-in-fact:''' The plaintiff must have suffered or imminently will suffer injury—an invasion of a legally protected interest that is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) actual or imminent (that is, neither conjectural nor hypothetical; not abstract).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|last1=Varma
|first1=Corey
|year=2016
|title=The Presumption of Injury: Giving Data Breach Victims 'A Leg To Stand On'
|journal=Journal of Information Technology &amp; Privacy Law 
|volume=32
|issue=4
|url=http://repository.jmls.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1794&amp;context=jitpl
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The injury can be either economic, non-economic, or both.
# '''Causation:''' There must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of, so that the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant and not the result of the independent action of some third party who is not before the court.&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''[[Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency]]''  (global warming caused by EPA's refusal to regulate [[carbon dioxide]] emissions satisfied element of causation for Massachusetts's alleged injury of loss of coastland).&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Redressability:''' It must be likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that a favorable court decision will redress the injury.&lt;ref name="Lujan v 1992"&gt;{{ussc|name=Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife|504|555|1992}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prudential limitations===
Additionally, there are three major prudential (judicially created) standing principles. Congress can override these principles via statute:

# '''Prohibition of [[Third-party standing]]:''' A party may only assert his or her own rights and cannot raise the claims of a third party who is not before the court; exceptions exist where the third party has interchangeable economic interests with the injured party, or a person unprotected by a particular law sues to challenge the oversweeping of the law into the rights of others. For example, a party suing over a law prohibiting certain types of visual material, may sue because the [[Amendment I to the United States Constitution|1st Amendment]] rights of theirs, and others engaged in similar displays, might be damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, third parties who do not have standing may be able to sue under the [[next friend]] doctrine if the third party is an infant, mentally handicapped, or not a party to a contract. One example of a statutory exception to the prohibition of third party standing exists in the [[qui tam]] provision of the Civil [[False Claims Act]].&lt;ref name=VermontANR&gt;{{ussc|name=Vermont Agency of Natural Resources v. United States ex rel. Stevens|volume=529|page=765|pin=|year=2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Prohibition of generalized grievances:''' A plaintiff cannot sue if the injury is widely shared in an undifferentiated way with many people. For example, the general rule is that there is no federal taxpayer standing, as complaints about the spending of federal funds are too remote from the process of acquiring them. Such grievances are ordinarily more appropriately addressed in the representative branches.
# '''Zone of interest test:''' There are in fact two tests used by the United States Supreme Court for the zone of interest
## Zone of injury - The injury is the kind of injury that Congress expected might be addressed under the statute.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Federal Election Commission v. Akins|volume=524|page=11|pin=|year=1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
## Zone of interests - The party is arguably within the zone of interest protected by the statute or constitutional provision.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Allen v. Wright|volume=468|page=737|pin=|year=1984}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent development of the doctrine===
In 1984, the Supreme Court reviewed and further outlined the standing requirements in a major ruling concerning the meaning of the three standing requirements of injury, causation, and redressability.&lt;ref&gt;''Allen v. Wright'', 468 U.S. at 752 (1984).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the suit, parents of black public school children alleged that the Internal Revenue Service was not enforcing standards and procedures that would deny tax-exempt status to racially discriminatory private schools. The Court found that the plaintiffs did not have the standing necessary to bring suit.&lt;ref name="avw755"&gt;''Allen v. Wright'', 468 U.S. at 755 (1984).&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Court established a significant injury for one of the claims, it found the causation of the injury (the nexus between the defendant’s actions and the plaintiff’s injuries) to be too attenuated.&lt;ref name="avw755" /&gt; "The injury alleged was not fairly traceable to the Government conduct respondents challenge as unlawful".&lt;ref&gt;''Allen v. Wright'', 468 U.S. at 757 (1984).&lt;/ref&gt;

In another major standing case, ''[[Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife]]'', 504 U.S. 555 (1992), the Supreme Court elaborated on the redressability requirement for standing.&lt;ref name="Lujan v 1992"/&gt; The case involved a challenge to a rule promulgated by the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] interpreting §7 of the [[Endangered Species Act of 1973]] (ESA). The rule rendered §7 of the ESA applicable only to actions within the United States or on the high seas. The Court found that the plaintiffs did not have the standing necessary to bring suit, because no injury had been established.&lt;ref&gt;''Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife'', 504 U.S. at 562.&lt;/ref&gt; The injury claimed by the plaintiffs was that damage would be caused to certain species of animals and that this in turn injures the plaintiffs by the reduced likelihood that the plaintiffs would see the species in the future. The court insisted though that the plaintiffs had to show how damage to the species would produce imminent injury to the plaintiffs.&lt;ref&gt;''Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife'', 504 U.S. at 564.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court found that the plaintiffs did not sustain this burden of proof. "The 'injury in fact' test requires more than an injury to a cognizable interest. It requires that the party seeking review be himself among the injured".&lt;ref&gt;''Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife'', 504 U.S. at 563.&lt;/ref&gt; The injury must be imminent and not hypothetical.

Beyond failing to show injury, the Court found that the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate the standing requirement of redressability.&lt;ref&gt;''Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife'', 504 U.S. at 568.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court pointed out that the respondents chose to challenge a more generalized level of government action, "the invalidation of which would affect all overseas projects". This programmatic approach has "obvious difficulties insofar as proof of causation or redressability is concerned".

In a 2000 case, ''Vermont Agency of Natural Resources v. United States ex rel. Stevens'', 529 U.S. 765 (2000),&lt;ref name=VermontANR/&gt; the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] endorsed the "partial assignment" approach to [[qui tam]] relator standing to sue under the [[False Claims Act]] — allowing private individuals to sue on behalf of the U.S. government for injuries suffered solely by the government.&lt;ref&gt;Nathan D. Sturycz, ''The King and I?: An Examination of the Interest Qui Tam Relators Represent and the Implications for Future False Claims Act Litigation'', 28 St. Louis Pub. L. Rev. 459 (2009), available at http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1537749. For the general standing rule, see {{ussc|name=Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife|504|555|1992}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taxpayer standing===
The initial case that established the doctrine of standing, ''[[Frothingham v. Mellon]]'', was a taxpayer standing case.&lt;ref name=Frothingham/&gt;

Taxpayer standing is the concept that any person who pays taxes should have standing to file a [[lawsuit]] against the taxing body if that body allocates funds in a way that the [[taxpayer]] feels is improper. The [[United States Supreme Court]] has held that taxpayer standing is not by itself a sufficient basis for standing against the [[United States government]], unless the narrower [[Flast test]] is met.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Flast v. Cohen|volume=392|page=83|pin=|year=1968}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court has consistently found that the conduct of the federal government is too far removed from individual taxpayer returns for any injury to the taxpayer to be traced to the use of tax revenues, e.g., ''[[United States v. Richardson]].''

In ''[[DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno|volume=547|page=332|pin=|year=2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the Court extended this analysis to state governments as well.  However, the Supreme Court has also held that taxpayer standing is constitutionally sufficient to sue a [[municipal government]] in a [[United States federal court|federal court]].{{citation needed|reason=no court case given to support this assertion|date=January 2015}}

States are also protected against lawsuits by their [[sovereign immunity]]. Even where states waive their sovereign immunity, they may nonetheless have their own rules limiting standing against simple taxpayer standing against the state. Furthermore, states have the power to determine what will constitute standing for a litigant to be heard in a state court, and may deny access to the courts premised on taxpayer standing alone.

In [[Florida]], a taxpayer has standing to sue if the state government is acting unconstitutionally with respect to public funds, or if government action is causing some special injury to the taxpayer that is not shared by taxpayers in general. In [[Virginia]], the [[Supreme Court of Virginia]] has more or less adopted a similar rule.  An individual taxpayer generally has standing to challenge an act of a city or county where they live, but does not have general standing to challenge state expenditures.

===Standing to challenge statutes===
With limited exceptions, a party cannot have standing to challenge the constitutionality of a statute unless he will be subjected to the provisions of that statute.  There are some exceptions, however; for example, courts will accept [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] challenges to a statute on overbreadth grounds, where a person who is only partially affected by a statute can challenge the parts that do not affect him on the grounds that laws that restrict speech have a [[Chilling effect (term)|chilling effect]] on other people's right to free speech.

The only other way someone can have standing to challenge the constitutionality of a statute is if the existence of the statute would otherwise deprive him of a right or a privilege even if the statute itself would not apply to him. The Virginia Supreme Court made this point clear in the case of ''[[Martin v. Ziherl]]'' 607 S.E.2d 367 (Va. 2005). Martin and Ziherl were girlfriend and boyfriend and engaged in unprotected sexual intercourse when Martin discovered that Ziherl had infected her with [[herpes]], even though he knew he was infected and did not inform her of this. She sued him for damages, but because it was illegal (at the time the case was filed) to commit "fornication" (sexual intercourse between a man and a woman who are not married), Ziherl argued that Martin could not sue him because joint tortfeasors - those involved in committing a crime - cannot sue each other over acts occurring as a result of a criminal act (''Zysk v. Zysk'', 404 S.E.2d 721 (Va. 1990)). Martin argued in rebuttal that because of the U.S. Supreme Court decision in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'' (finding that state's sodomy law unconstitutional), Virginia's anti-fornication law was also unconstitutional for the reasons cited in Lawrence. Martin argued, therefore, she could, in fact, sue Ziherl for damages.

Lower courts decided that because the Commonwealth's Attorney doesn't prosecute [[fornication]] cases and no one had been prosecuted for fornication anywhere in Virginia in over 100 years, Martin had no risk of prosecution and thus lacked standing to challenge the statute. Martin appealed. Since Martin had something to lose - the ability to sue Ziherl for damages - if the statute is upheld, she had standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statute even though the possibility of her being prosecuted for violating it was zero. Since the U.S. Supreme Court in ''Lawrence'' has found that there is a privacy right in one's private, noncommercial sexual practices, the Virginia Supreme Court decided that the statute against fornication was unconstitutional. The finding gave Martin standing to sue Ziherl since the decision in ''Zysk'' was no longer applicable.

However, the only reason Martin had standing to challenge the statute was that she had something to lose if it stayed on the books.

=== Ballot measures ===
In ''[[Hollingsworth v. Perry]]'', the Supreme Court ruled that being the proponents of a ballot measure is not by itself enough to confer legal standing. In that case, [[Proposition 8]] had banned same-sex marriage in California, a ban that was ruled unconstitutional. The Supreme Court ruled that the proponents of Proposition 8 has no standing in court since they failed to show that they were harmed by the decision.

===State law===
State law on standing differs substantially from federal law and varies considerably from state to state.

====California====
On  December 29, 2009,  the [[California Courts of Appeal|California Court of Appeal]] for the Sixth District ruled that California Code of Civil Procedure Section 367 cannot be read as imposing a federal-style standing doctrine on California's code pleading system of civil procedure.&lt;ref name="jasmine"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Jasmine Networks, Inc. v. Superior Court (Marvell Semiconductor, Inc.) |vol=180 |reporter=Cal. App. 4th |opinion=980 |pinpoint= |court= |date=2009 |url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/ca-court-of-appeal/1500032.html |accessdate=2018-01-06 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In California, the fundamental inquiry is ''always'' whether the plaintiff has sufficiently pleaded a cause of action,  not whether the plaintiff has some entitlement to judicial action separate from proof of the substantive merits of the claim advanced.&lt;ref name="jasmine" /&gt; The court acknowledged that the word "standing" is often sloppily used to refer to what is really ''[[jus tertii]]'', and held that ''jus tertii'' in state law is not the same thing as the federal standing doctrine.&lt;ref name="jasmine" /&gt;

==History==
After the [[Colombian Declaration of Independence|Colombian first declaration of independence]] from [[Spain]] on 20 July 1810, a number of independent States like [[Tunja]] (1811), [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]] (1812), [[Cartagena de Indias]] (1812) and [[Free and Independent State of Cundinamarca|Cundinamarca]] (1812) were established. Each State had its own body in charge of the administration of justice. Later, when these States established the ''Provincias Unidas de la Nueva Granada'' ([[United Provinces of New Granada]]), on 23 September 1814, the ''Alto Tribunal de Justicia'' (High Tribunal of Justice) was established. In 1819, the Republic of Colombia (the [[Gran Colombia]]) was born. A Court was created according to the provisions its Constitution of 30 August 1821, named ''Alta Corte de Justicia'' (High Court of Justice). In 1830, the Gran Colombia was dissolved and the [[Republic of New Granada]] was formed. As per the provisions of its Constitution of 29 February 1832, the ''Corte Suprema de Justicia'' (Supreme Court of Justice) was established. On 20 May 1853, it became the ''Corte Suprema de la Nación'' (Supreme Court of the Nation). In 1858, the [[Grenadine Confederation]] was founded. On adoption of its Constitution of 22 May 1858, the ''Courte Suprema'' (Supreme Court) became the body in charge of the administration of justice. In 1863, the Grenadine Confederation was replaced by the ''Estados Unidos de Colombia'' ([[United States of Colombia]]). On adoption of its Constitution of 8 May 1863, the ''Corte Suprema Federal'' (Supreme Federal Court) was established. Finally, after the establishment of the ''República de Colombia'' ([[Republic of Colombia]]) and on adoption of its [[Colombian Constitution of 1886|Constitution of August 4, 1886]], the body was renamed as the present, the ''Corte Suprema de Justicia'' (Supreme Court of Justice) on 3 September 1886. Its first President was Rito Antonio Martínez.

In 1985 in the [[Palace of Justice siege]], members of the [[19th of April Movement|M-19]] guerrilla group took over the Palace of Justice, and held the Supreme Court [[hostage]], intending to put [[President of Colombia|President]] [[Belisario Betancur]] ''on trial''. Hours later, after a military raid, the incident left all the rebels and 11 of the 25 Supreme Court Justices dead.

'''Tanzanian nationality law''' is the law which deals with citizenship and other forms of nationality. A Tanzanian citizen is anyone who is in possession of citizenship to the [[United Republic of Tanzania]]. Nationality law is mentioned in the [[Constitution of Tanzania]].

The citizenship law was first implemented after independence in 1961 and amended in 1964, when [[Tanganyika]] and [[Zanzibar]] united to form Tanzania.

==Acquisition of citizenship==
{{Commonwealth citizen}}

===Citizenship by birth===
Any child born within the borders of the United Republic of Tanzania, on or after Union Day, 26 April 1964, is granted citizenship of Tanzania, except for children of foreign diplomats, as stated in the Tanzania Citizenship Act of 1995.&lt;ref name=Manby&gt;{{cite web|author=Manby, Bronwen|title=Citizenship Law in Africa: A Comparative Study.|edition=2nd|publisher=Open Society Institute|date=2010|accessdate=2013-06-30|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/women/docs/OtherEntities/OSJI%20CitizenshipAfricaStudy.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Refworld&gt;{{cite web|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/3ae6b5734.html |title=Tanzania Citizenship Act, 1995 |publisher=Refworld |date= |accessdate=2013-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Citizenship by descent===
A person born outside Tanzania enjoys a right to Tanzanian citizenship from birth provided that at least one parent is a Tanzanian citizen by birth or naturalization.&lt;ref name=Manby/&gt;&lt;ref name=ImmiServDep&gt;{{cite web|title=''Tanzania Citizenship.'' |publisher=Tanzanian Immigration Services Department|accessdate=2013-06-30|url=http://immigration.go.tz/module1.php?id=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Citizenship by naturalisation===
Any foreign national with no ancestry or birth ties with Tanzania may apply for citizenship through [[naturalisation]]. In order for a foreign national to become a Tanzanian citizen through naturalisation, the following conditions must be met.

*(a). Residence in the United Republic throughout the period of twelve months immediately preceding the date of the applications.
*(b). During the ten years immediately preceding the said period of twelve months, total residence in the United Republic for periods amounting in the aggregate to not less than seven years.
*(c). Adequate knowledge of [[Kiswahili]] or the [[English language]].
*(d). Good character.
*(e). Would be a suitable citizen in terms of past and potential contribution to social and cultural welfare as well as economic, scientific, or technological advancement of Tanzania.
*(f). Intention, if naturalised, to continue to reside permanently in the United Republic.&lt;ref name=ImmiServDep&gt;{{cite web|title=''Tanzania Citizenship.'' |publisher=Tanzanian Immigration Services Department|accessdate=2013-06-30|url=http://immigration.go.tz/module1.php?id=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the lodging of the application, the applicant must publish a notice of intention to naturalise in two consecutive issues of the registered newspapers. After the application has been scrutinised by various officials, a final recommendation is made to the Minister of Home Affairs, who ultimately decides whether or not to approve the application.&lt;ref name=ImmiServDep /&gt;

A person receiving Tanzanian citizenship by naturalisation must renounce foreign citizenships under current law.&lt;ref name=Manby /&gt;

'''The case for Minors'''
In the case of minors, according to the citizenship act of 1995, once the parents are granted citizenship to the United Republic of Tanzania, the child is also by right entitled to receive citizenship, considered they are under legal age and still living under the care of their parents.

==Dual citizenship==
Tanzania does not currently allow its citizens to hold foreign citizenship in addition to their Tanzanian citizenship, except in the case of Tanzanian woman acquiring foreign nationality through marriage{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}, or persons under 18 who acquire Tanzanian citizenship by birth or descent. Multiple nationals automatically lose their Tanzanian citizenship at 18 unless they renounce all other citizenships. The ban on dual citizenship has historically been motivated by suspicions about potential disloyalty amongst the sizable Asian minority. Nevertheless, a debate has arisen about permitting dual citizenship. In August 2007, the minister of home affairs submitted a report recommending that the law be changed.&lt;ref name=Manby /&gt; Nevertheless, Tanzania currently continues to restrict dual citizenship.

==Commonwealth citizenship==
Tanzania has been a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] since 26 April 1964, following the merger of [[Tanganyika]] and [[Zanzibar]]. Being that it is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, Tanzanian citizens are also [[Commonwealth citizen]]s, a status which entitles them to certain rights and benefits in the United Kingdom. Amongst some of the benefits, in some countries without Tanzanian consular representation, citizens of the United Republic may enquire or seek assistance with the United Kingdom's High commission.

==E.A.C. citizenship==
Following its collapse in 1977, the East African community was again revived in 2001, containing the original three founding states; namely, [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]] and [[Tanzania]]. In 2007, the organisation expanded to include the Republic of [[Rwanda]] and the Republic of [[Burundi]] as part of the [[East African Community]]. in 2016 the organisation expanded to include the Republic of [[South Sudan]]. 

Owing to the customs union, relaxed immigration regulations and free movement of labour set to be implemented within the community,Tanzanian citizens stand to benefit free movement within the East African Community zone, likewise citizens of other East African Community member states, may also enjoy free movement to Tanzania and other member territories and unlimited duration of stay while still maintaining their original nationality.

==Loss of citizenship==
Those who acquired Tanzanian citizenship at birth cannot be involuntarily stripped of their citizenship, though they may voluntarily renounce it.&lt;ref name=Manby /&gt; Those wishing to renounce their Tanzanian citizenship must provide evidence of another country's citizenship as well as return their [[Tanzanian passport]].&lt;ref name=ImmiServDep /&gt;

Those who acquired Tanzanian citizenship by naturalisation may have their citizenship revoked for the following reasons:
* A finding of fraud in the naturalisation application,
* Any criminal conviction carrying a sentence of at least twelve months within five years of naturalisation,
* Disloyal behaviour towards Tanzania, or
* Five years residence abroad without registering an intention to retain Tanzanian citizenship.&lt;ref name=Manby /&gt;&lt;ref name=Refworld /&gt;

{{Chinese Political Realism}}
The '''''Book of Lord Shang''''' ({{zh|t=商君書|p=Shāng jūn shū}}) is an ancient Chinese text from the 3rd century BC, regarded as a foundational work of "[[Chinese Legalism]]". The earliest surviving of such texts (the second being the [[Han Feizi]], which is generally considered more philosophically engaging),&lt;ref&gt;Pines, Yuri, "Legalism in Chinese Philosophy", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), 1.1 Major Legalist Texts, http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2014/entries/chinese-legalism/&lt;/ref&gt; it is named for and to some extent attributed to major [[Qin (state)|Qin]] reformer [[Shang Yang]], who served as minister to [[Duke Xiao of Qin]] (r. 361{{snd}}338{{sbc}}) from 359{{sbc}} until his death in 338{{sbc}} and is generally considered to be the father of that state's "legalism".{{sfnp|Levi|1993|p=368}} 

The ''Book of Lord Shang'' includes a large number of ordinances, essays, and courtly petitions attributed to Shang Yang, as well as discourses delivered at the Qin court. The book focuses mainly on maintaining societal order through a system of impartial laws that strictly mete out rewards and punishments for citizens' actions. The first chapters advise promoting [[agriculture]] and suppressing other low-priority secondary activities, as well as encouraging martial virtues for use in creating and maintaining a state army for wars of conquest.{{sfnp|Knechtges|Shi|2014|p=810}}

==Textual tradition==
With some chapters written decades or even more than a century after his death, no critical scholar supposes the text to have been written by Shang Yang, though "some chapters were almost certainly penned by Shang Yang himself; others may come from the hand of his immediate disciples and followers." Highly composite, it nonetheless forms a "relatively coherent ideological vision", likely reflecting the evolution of what Zheng Liangshu (1989) dubbed Shang Yang’s 'intellectual current' (xuepai 學派).&lt;ref&gt;Creel,What Is Taoism?, 101

Like the later [[Han Feizi]], the Book of Lord Shang insists on the anachronism of the policies of the distant past, drawing on more recent history.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Edward Lewis 1999 p.122. Writing and Authority in Early China. https://books.google.com/books?id=8k4xn8CyHAQC&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison with it, though considering them to be "digressions of minor importance", Yuri Pines notes in ''Legalism in Chinese Philosophy'' that ''The Book of Lord Shang'' "allowed for the possibility that the need for excessive reliance on coercion would end and a milder, morality-driven political structure would evolve." The [[Han Feizi]] does not.&lt;ref&gt;Pines, Yuri, "Legalism in Chinese Philosophy", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), 2.1 Evolutionary view of History, http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2014/entries/chinese-legalism/&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Puett and [[Mark Edward Lewis]] compare the [[Rites of Zhou]] to the [[Chinese Legalism|"Legalism"]] of [[Shang Yang]].&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Elman, Martin Kern 2010 p.17,41.

==Overview==
The Book of Lord Shang teaches that "The law is an expression of love for the people... The sage, if he is able to strengthen the state thereby, does not model himself on antiquity, and if he is able to benefit the people thereby, does not adhere to the established rites."&lt;ref&gt;http://ctext.org/shang-jun-shu/reform-of-the-law&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the philosophy espoused is quite explicitly anti-[[Confucianism|Confucian]]:
{{cquote|Sophistry and cleverness are an aid to [[Antinomianism|lawlessness]]; rites and music are symptoms of dissipations and licence; kindness and benevolence are the foster‑mother of transgressions; employment and promotion are opportunities for the rapacity of the wicked. If lawlessness is aided, it becomes current; if there are symptoms of dissipation and licence, they will become the practice; if there is a foster‑mother for transgressions, they will arise; if there are opportunities for the rapacity of the wicked, they will never cease. If these eight things come together, the people will be stronger than the government; but if these eight things are non‑existent in a state, the government will be stronger than the people. If the people are stronger than the government, the state is weak; if the government is stronger than the people, the army is strong. For if these eight things exist, the ruler has no one to use for defence and war, with the result that the state will be dismembered and will come to ruin; but if there are not these eight things, the ruler has the wherewithal for defence and war, with the result that the state will flourish and attain supremacy.|40px|40px|Chapter 2, Paragraph 5 of ''The Book of Lord Shang''|pg 109 of J.J.-L.

'''Trademark distinctiveness''' is an important concept in the law governing [[trademark]]s and [[service mark]]s. A trademark may be eligible for registration, or '''registrable''', if it performs the essential trademark function, and has '''distinctive character'''. Registrability can be understood as a continuum, with "inherently distinctive" marks at one end, "generic" and "descriptive" marks with no distinctive character at the other end, and "suggestive" and "arbitrary" marks lying between these two points. "Descriptive" marks must acquire distinctiveness through secondary meaning - consumers have come to recognize the mark as a source indicator - to be protectable. "Generic" terms are used to refer to the product or service itself and cannot be used as trademarks.

==The spectrum of distinctiveness==

In [[United States trademark law]], [[Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co. v. Hunting World]] 537 F.2d 4 (2nd Cir. 1976) established the [[spectrum]] of trademark distinctiveness in the US, breaking trademarks into classes which are accorded differing degrees of protection. Courts often speak of marks falling along the following "'''spectrum of distinctiveness'''," also known within the US as the "[[Abercrombie &amp; Fitch|Abercrombie]] classification" or "[[Abercrombie &amp; Fitch|Abercrombie]] factors":&lt;ref&gt;''[[Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co. v. Hunting World]]'' 537 F.2d 4 (2nd Cir. 1976)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inta.org/TrademarkBasics/FactSheets/Pages/TrademarksvsGenericTermsFactSheet.aspx |publisher=[[International Trademark Association]] |title=Trademarks vs. Generic Terms |accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://definitions.uslegal.com/a/abercrombie-classification |title=Abercrombie Classification Law &amp; Legal Definition |publisher=US Legal, Inc. |accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fanciful marks===
A '''fanciful''' / '''inherently distinctive''' trademark is [[prima facie]] registrable, and comprises an entirely invented or "fanciful" sign. For example, "[[Kodak]]" had no meaning before it was adopted and used as a trademark in relation to goods, whether photographic goods or otherwise. Invented marks are [[neologism]]s which will not previously have been found in any [[dictionary]].

===Arbitrary marks===
An '''arbitrary''' trademark is usually a common word which is used in a meaningless context (e.g. "[[Apple Inc.|Apple]]" for computers). Such marks consist of words or images which have some dictionary meaning before being adopted as trademarks, but which are used in connection with products or services unrelated to that dictionary meaning. Arbitrary marks are also immediately eligible for registration. ''Salty'' would be an arbitrary mark if it used in connection with e.g. telephones such as in ''Salty Telephones'', as the term "[[salt]]" has no particular connection with such products.

===Suggestive marks===
A '''suggestive''' trademark tends to indicate the nature, quality, or a characteristic of the products or services in relation to which it is used, but does not describe this characteristic, and requires imagination on the part of the consumer to identify the characteristic. Suggestive marks invoke the consumer’s perceptive imagination. An example of a suggestive mark is [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]], a new technology of high-capacity data storage that utilizes a "blue" (actually [[Violet (color)|violet]]) [[laser]].

===Descriptive marks===
A '''descriptive''' mark is a term with a dictionary meaning which is used in connection with products or services directly related to that meaning. An example might be ''Salty'' used in connection with saltine crackers or anchovies. Such terms are not registrable unless it can be shown that distinctive character has been established in the term through extensive use in the [[marketplace]] (see further below). [[Lektronic]] was famously refused protection by the USPTO on the grounds of being descriptive for electronic goods.

===Generic terms===
{{Redirect|Generic term}}
A '''generic term''' is the common name for the products or services in connection with which it is used, such as "salt" when used in connection with sodium chloride. A generic term is not capable of serving the essential trademark function of distinguishing the products or services of a business from the products or services of other businesses, and therefore cannot be afforded any legal protection. This is because there has to be some term which may generally be used by anyone—including other manufacturers—to refer to a product without using some organization's proprietary trademark. Marks which become generic after losing distinctive character are known as [[genericized trademark]]s. Marks which are a misspelling of a generic term (e.g., the elimination of a space) do not change the generic significance of the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/com/sol/foia/ttab/other/2005/76219917.pdf|title= In re NetEnterprise, Inc., Serial No. 76219917|work=USPTO|language=en|date=2005-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thettablog.blogspot.com/2005/05/netenterprise-generic-for-internet.html|title='NETENTERPRISE' Generic For An Internet Business, Says TTAB|work=TTABlog|language=en|date=2005-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assessing distinctiveness==
In trademark litigation, courts are most frequently asked to distinguish between ''suggestive'' and ''descriptive'' marks on the one hand, and between ''descriptive'' and ''generic'' marks on the other. This is because suggestive marks, like fanciful and arbitrary marks, are presumed to be entitled to trademark protection, while descriptive marks are entitled to protection if they have become known as representing the producer of the goods, and generic marks can never receive protection. It can be seen from the examples above that the distinctive character of a term is closely related to the products or services in relation to which the term is used.

A general method for assessing the distinctive character of a mark is to consider a consumer's reaction to a mark. The mark may only be inherently registrable if the consumer has never encountered the mark before. On the other hand, the mark is unlikely to be inherently registrable if it informs him about any characteristic of the relevant products or services (e.g. whether they are delicious, large, spicy, black, or sweet, in the case of fruit). In any other case the mark may not be registrable.

Another example of a descriptive mark would be a geographical word or phrase that merely indicates the origin of the product or service. For example, [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] based [[ice cream]] might find that the name "Houston ice cream" is denied trademark protection on the grounds that the word Houston is merely descriptive. However, they might have better luck with the name "North Pole ice cream". In the latter case, although North Pole is a geographical location, the ice cream is not actually made at the [[North Pole]], and no reasonable person would assume that the phrase North Pole is literally descriptive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.findlaw.com/12international/countries/nz/articles/482.html| publisher= Findlaw|title=Trading on a good name| first=Baldwin Shelston| last= Waters|author2=Angela Sutton |date=July 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore marks that identify or describe a product or service, or that are in common use, or that are used as [[geographical indication]]s, generally cannot be registered as trademarks, and remain in the [[public domain]] for use by anyone. For example, a generic term such as "apple", or descriptive terms such as "red" or "juicy" could not be registered in relation to apples.

Primary consideration in the selection and use of trademarks should be given to marks which are inherently distinctive, as they possess the strongest distinctive character and do not require evidence of use to establish acquired distinctiveness. A fanciful, arbitrary, or suggestive term can be inherently distinctive and registrable without proof of acquired distinctiveness.
Although these categories are most easily applied in relation to trademarks comprising words, the same general principles are applied in relation to all kinds of trademarks. For example, a pine tree shape is descriptive when used on pine-scented products.

===Acquired distinctiveness===
A trademark with no distinctive character (i.e. a mark which is not inherently distinctive) is [[prima facie]] unregistrable. However, most jurisdictions may still allow such marks to be registered if the trademark owner can demonstrate, typically by reference to '''evidence of use''', that consumers in the marketplace exclusively associate the mark, as used on the identified goods or in connection with the identified services, with a particular commercial origin or source (i.e. the trademark owner). "Use" may include authorized use by a licensee or other party. If the trade marks office is satisfied that the evidence demonstrates that a mark has "acquired" distinctive character ''as a [[de facto|matter of fact]]'', then the mark may be accepted for registration on the basis of '''acquired distinctiveness'''.

The nature and extent of acceptable evidence of use varies between jurisdictions, although the most useful evidence usually includes sales figures, details of advertising and promotional expenditure, and examples of promotional material. Consumer surveys may also help establish that consumers chiefly associate an otherwise non-distinctive mark with the trademark owner and its products or services. Generally, evidence of use may only be acceptable or relevant if it covers a certain period of time (e.g. three years prior to the filing date of the trademark application) and originates from within the jurisdiction where registration is sought.

The terminology of acquired distinctiveness is accepted in the [[European Union]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] jurisdictions such as [[Australia]], [[Hong Kong]] and the [[United Kingdom]], and the common law jurisdiction of the [[United States]] (which also uses the term '''secondary meaning'''). In the U.S., if a trademark has been used for a continuous period of at least five years after the date of registration, the right to use the mark and the registration may become "incontestable" (e.g. invulnerable to cancellation for non-use, but not for becoming [[Genericized trademark|generic]]). In such cases the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|USPTO]] checks and confirms whether the request for incontestability meets formality requirements, but whether a registration is incontestable at law can only be determined during legal proceedings involving the registration.

The essential function of a trademark is to exclusively identify the commercial source or origin of products or services, such that a trademark, properly called, indicates source or serves as a badge of origin. The use of a trademark in this way is known as trademark use. Certain exclusive rights attach to a registered mark, which can be enforced by way of an action for trademark infringement, while unregistered trademark rights may be enforced pursuant to the common law tort of passing off.

It should be noted that trademark rights generally arise out of the use and/or registration (see below) of a mark in connection only with a specific type or range of products or services. Although it may sometimes be possible to take legal action to prevent the use of a mark in relation to products or services outside this range (e.g. for passing off), this does not mean that trademark law prevents the use of that mark by the general public. A common word, phrase, or other sign can only be removed from the public domain to the extent that a trademark owner is able to maintain exclusive rights over that sign in relation to certain products or services, assuming there are no other trademark objections. For a case study in both concepts, see Apple Corps and its disputes with Apple, Inc.

===Maintaining distinctiveness===
If a court rules that a trademark has become "[[genericized trademark|generic]]" through common use (such that the mark no longer performs the essential trademark function and the average consumer no longer considers that exclusive rights attach to it), the corresponding registration may also be ruled invalid.

For example, the [[Bayer]] company's trademark "[[Aspirin]]" has been ruled generic in the United States, so other companies may use that name for [[acetylsalicylic acid]] as well (although it is still a trademark in [[Canada]]). [[Xerox]] for photocopiers and [[Band-Aid]] for adhesive bandages are both trademarks which are at risk of succumbing to death by becoming declared generic in certain countries, something that the respective trademark owners actively seek to prevent. In order to prevent marks becoming generic, trademark owners often contact those who appear to be using the trademark incorrectly, from web page authors to dictionary editors, and request that they cease the improper usage.

The proper use of a trademark means using the mark as an [[adjective]], not as a [[noun]] or a [[verb]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.inta.org/index.php?option=com_simplefaq&amp;task=display&amp;Itemid=60&amp;catid=284&amp;page=1&amp;getcontent=1#FAQ75| publisher=[[International Trademark Association]]| title= How Do I Use a Trademark Properly?| work=Information and Publishing FAQ| accessdate=2006-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.3com.com/corpinfo/en_US/legal/trademark/prop_usage_tmb.html#1| title=Always Use a Trademark as an Adjective, Followed by the Appropriate Noun Descriptor(s)| publisher=3Com Legal| work=Trademarks and Brands| accessdate=2006-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.adobe.com/misc/trade.html| title=Permissions and trademark guidelines| publisher=Adobe| accessdate=2006-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000943.html | title=A Guide to Proper Trademark Use | author=Pullum, Geoffrey K.  | accessdate=2006-12-05 | work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; though for certain trademarks, use as nouns and, less commonly, verbs is common. For example, [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]] sent e-mails to many web authors using the term "[[photoshopped]]" telling them that they should only use the term "modified by Adobe® Photoshop® software."  Xerox has also purchased print advertisements declaring that "you cannot 'xerox' a document, but you can copy it on a Xerox Brand copying on machine." Another popular example is the use of the word "[[frappuccino]]" by [[Starbucks]] customers to mean any blended coffee beverage, though employees are instructed to only say "frappuccino blended coffee" or "frappuccino blended cream" when referring to such drinks. This rule is not hard-and-fast, however; for example, Lexis-Nexis has a U.S. trademark registration for "Shepardize," [http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&amp;entry=74120780 Reg. No. 1743711], and defines "Shepardizing on a [http://www.lexisnexis.com/infopro/zimmerman/disp.aspx?z=1930 web page] as "the process of looking up citations" in "a series of books called Shepard's Citations."  Such efforts may or may not be successful in preventing genericism in the long run, which depends less on the mark owner's efforts and more on how the public actually perceives and uses the mark. In fact, legally it is more important that the trademark holder visibly and actively seems to attempt to prevent its trademark from becoming generic, regardless of real success.{{cn|date=January 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29451">[[File:Victoria Parliament House Melbourne.jpg|thumb|Legislation in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] is enacted by the '''[[Parliament of Victoria]]'''.  The Parliament is a [[bicameral]], or two-house, legislature. It comprises the [[Monarchy of Australia|Queen of Australia]], the [[Victorian Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]] or ''Lower House'' and the [[Victorian Legislative Council|Legislative Council]] or ''Upper House''. The head of the State Government is the [[Premiers of Victoria|Premier of Victoria]].]]

The '''Transport Legislation Review''' was a policy and legislation review project conducted by the [[Department of Transport (Victoria, Australia)|Department of Transport]] in the State of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]] between 2004 and late 2010. The aim of the project was review of transport policy and laws and generation of new policy and legislation as a platform for better transport across the State.

The Review was the most extensive project of its kind in transport in Victoria&lt;ref&gt;A review between 1982 and 1988 produced the following major statutes&amp;nbsp;– the Transport Act 1983, the Road Safety Act 1986 and the Marine Act 1988. A major proposal for a Victorian Ports Authority Act was defeated in [[Victorian Parliament|Parliament]] in 1985.  The period 1995-1999 was also a major period of policy and legislative activity although not on a portfolio-wide scale.  Review work and outputs in that period were mainly confined to statutes relating to reorganisation of rail services in the state and initial new safety regulation schemes in the rail and bus sectors.&lt;/ref&gt; and touched all areas of transport including land and water based transport activities.  Proposals were developed by the Review for consideration by the [[Government of Victoria (Australia)|Victorian Government]] and proceeded initially as policy ideas. Proposals were progressively refined over time using modules and sub projects sometimes in response to stakeholder input.  Outputs from Review often proceeded as new State regulatory schemes and laws, commonly in the form of Bills considered by the [[Parliament of Victoria|Victorian Parliament]].

The new laws which arose from the Review had [[Regulation|regulatory]] and [[Deregulation|de-regulatory]] effects in particular areas.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Accident Towing Services Act|Accident Towing Services Act 2007]] provides an example of a de-regulatory initiative. The Act repealed provisions which regulated the [[Tow truck|towing]] industry in the former Transport Act 1983. While some provisions were re-enacted in a modified form in the new statute, provisions regulating trade towing were not continued therefore removing economic regulation controls from that sector.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Review was notable for pursuing principle-based initiatives,&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the policy framework reflected in the Transport Integration Act 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; introducing performance-based concepts into transport law often in the form of safety duties owed by industry participants to persons using transport services and to other industry participants&lt;ref&gt;See the safety duties contained in the [[Rail Safety Act|Rail Safety Act 2006]], the [[Bus Safety Act|Bus Safety Act 2009]] and the Marine Safety Act 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and suites of new administrative and court sanctions targeted at non compliance. The project also had significant impacts on organisational arrangements in Victorian transport.

The Victorian Government Ministers who oversaw the work of the project at times were [[Peter Batchelor]], [[Lynne Kosky]], [[Tim Pallas]] and [[Martin Pakula]].

== Scope ==
The work of the Transport Legislation Review was described in a 2009 paper released by the [[Department of Transport (Victoria, Australia)|Department of Transport]]:

::A comprehensive review of Victoria’s transport policy and legislation has been underway since 2004.  Its aim has been to modernise transport policy, legislation and regulatory practices, drawing on developments in regulatory theory and approaches in other industry sectors and in other jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;Improving Marine Safety in Victoria&amp;nbsp;– Review of the Marine Act 1988, Discussion Paper, July 2009.  Foreword, Page 1.  Paper available at the [http://www.transport.vic.gov.au/Doi/Internet/planningprojects.nsf/AllDocs/5233ADAD980B4DFACA2575DF0000B402?OpenDocument Department of Transport website].&lt;/ref&gt;

The explanatory memorandum to the Transport Legislation Amendment (Compliance, Enforcement and Regulation) Bill 2010 also observed that:

::"...major renewal is underway across the transport portfolios through the Government's ''Transport Legislation Review''.  This project is ...generating an entire new legislative framework for the State along best practice lines."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.vic.gov.au/domino/Web_Notes/LDMS/PubPDocs.nsf/ee665e366dcb6cb0ca256da400837f6b/5CB10C3D43254C6ACA2576E100794879/$FILE/561376exi1.pdf Explanatory memorandum, page 1, Transport Legislation (Compliance, Enforcement and Regulation) Bill 2010], from the official Victorian Government legislation site.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Context ==
The Transport Legislation Review arose from concerns about the poor state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria's]] transport laws. In particular, most transport legislation was thought to be complex, unnecessarily detailed and generally based on old policy.&lt;ref&gt;For example, see the Minister's second reading speech in support of the [[Rail Safety Act|Rail Safety Act 2006]] which contained numerous criticisms of the style and substance of the former legislation.  Another example can be found in the [http://www.legislation.vic.gov.au/domino/Web_Notes/LDMS/PubPDocs.nsf/ee665e366dcb6cb0ca256da400837f6b/4cbe3f232ac73d51ca25774b0005c117!OpenDocument explanatory memorandum for the Tourist and Heritage Railways Bill 2010] which observes that, "Tourist and heritage railways were previously governed by the [[Transport Act 1983]], under which the Governor in Council was empowered to make Orders in Council granting persons the right to occupy, operate and maintain tourist railway services. Importantly, this regulatory scheme only covered a narrow range of matters affecting the sector and did not provide sufficient clarity or make appropriate provision for the occupation and use of Victorian railways and railway infrastructure."&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Victorian Government]] was also troubled that areas of the laws did not reflect regulatory advances in other industries and were not sufficiently informed by overseas reforms.

Pearce and Shepherd observed that it "...was a timely point to commence the review, given it had been 20 years since the State's central transport statute, the [[Transport Act 1983]], was first enacted....&lt;ref&gt;Robert Pearce and Ian Shepherd, ''The [[Transport Integration Act 2010]]: driving integrated and [[sustainable transport]] outcomes through legislation'', Urban Transport XVII, page 356.&lt;/ref&gt;   They went on to say that the -

::"...Transport Act had become the largest statute in Victoria with over 700 pages of dense and prescriptive provisions in accordance with the prevailing legislative style.  A number of other transport related Acts (and amendments to the Transport Act) had also been created to respond to different transport policies of successive governments over time.  Most of these were examples of either facilitative or coercive legislative approaches.  Importantly, however, there was no overarching framework for transport policy reflected in the State's legislation.   In other words, transport legislation did not have aspirational elements.  More specifically:

::*  there was no clear vision for the transport system
::* bodies (such as [[VicRoads]] and the [[Director of Public Transport]]) were established with different (and potentially competing) objectives
::* there was no overarching framework to express broader policy objectives for transport as a whole
::* the legislation contained minimal reference to social policy objectives and no reference to environmental objectives
::* linkages with related areas (such as planning and local government) were not clear or not recognised."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Pearce and Ian Shepherd, ''The [[Transport Integration Act 2010]]: driving integrated and sustainable transport outcomes through legislation'', Urban Transport XVII, page 356-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plan and approach ==
The Review aimed to complete a wholesale revision of the State's transport policies and legislation.  The project was guided by a target legislative framework diagram showing the final desired state of transport legislation in Victoria after completion of work. The diagram was headed by a overarching portfolio-based statute intended to provide long term symbolic and aspirational direction, the [[Transport Integration Act]], supported by a range of transport modal and subject-specific statutes. Diagrams showing the current and former legislative structures were also used.&lt;ref&gt;Current, future and past legislative structure diagrams are available online at the [http://www.transport.vic.gov.au/Doi/Internet/planningprojects.nsf/AllDocs/5B9DF9312B4B1037CA25735A000909DA?OpenDocument relevant pages] on the Department of Transport web site.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Review was policy-driven and proceeded on a modular basis.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Pearce and Ian Shepherd, ''The [[Transport Integration Act 2010]]: driving integrated and sustainable transport outcomes through legislation'', Urban Transport XVII, page 357.&lt;/ref&gt;   This approach "...sought to more clearly delineate between overarching institutional elements and more detailed regulatory, operational, project and service delivery elements.  It also sought to explicitly identify linkages within the transport portfolio (road, rail, tram, bus, taxi, hire car, tow trucks) and intefaces with other portolios (local government authorities and planning portfolios)."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Pearce and Ian Shepherd, ''The [[Transport Integration Act 2010]]: driving integrated and sustainable transport outcomes through legislation'', Urban Transport XVII, page 357.&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of the new statutes which emerged from the work of the Review were preceded by extensive policy and stakeholder processes.  This typically involved the public release of documents outlining issues in the relevant transport sector and later circulation of draft proposals which signalled the intended direction of change.   The conduct of industry and [[public consultation]] forums and the receipt of public submissions was a feature of this activity.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Rail Safety Act]], the [[Accident Towing Services Act]], the [[Bus Safety Act]], the [[Transport Integration Act]], the Marine Safety Act and the [[Tourist and Heritage Railways Act]] all involved such processes.  Copies of papers from these reviews can be located at the [[Department of Transport (Victoria, Australia)|Department of Transport]] web site at www.transport.vic.gov.au.&lt;/ref&gt;

== New laws generated ==
The Review concentrated on long, medium and short term measures. Global sector or scheme reviews typically resulted in the creation of suites of new contemporary regulatory policy which led in most instances to new Acts of Parliament which repealed existing Acts.&lt;ref&gt;See Principal statutes section below.&lt;/ref&gt; These are called principal statutes and typically take two years or more to fully complete. Smaller or mid range reforms, on the other hand, were pursued through Acts which amended existing principal statutes.&lt;ref&gt;See Other statutes section below.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Principal statutes ===
{{Main|Transport Integration Act|Rail Safety Act|Bus Safety Act|Accident Towing Services Act|Tourist and Heritage Railways Act}}
[[File:LAR-Konferanse 06 Foto Lars-Andreas Kvisle - forsamling 5.jpg|thumb|Many of the major proposals originated by the Transport Legislation Review were developed using workshops or meetings with key stakeholders who were informed by the release of comprehensive discussion papers. The process for developing the Marine Safety Act 2010, for example, involved the holding of 26 public sessions throughout [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].]]

The work of the Transport Legislation Review led to the development and enactment of seven major principal statutes between early 2006 and late 2010. The centrepiece of the Review and now the prime transport statute in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] is the  [[Transport Integration Act|Transport Integration Act 2010]] which came into effect on 1 July 2010.  The Act "....locates the development of a policy framework for integrated and sustainable transport in Victoria within global and international debates regarding sustainable development.  This has resulted in the inclusion of a vision, set of objectives and decision making principles for transport in the (transport Integration Act) reflecting an integration and sustainability policy framework."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Pearce and Ian Shepherd, ''The [[Transport Integration Act 2010]]: driving integrated and sustainable transport outcomes through legislation'', Urban Transport XVII, page 355.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other statutes ===
A wide range of amending statutes was also generated. While generally smaller than most principal statutes, the amending Acts often dealt with significant "big picture" changes and were routinely used to pursue discrete, urgent and priority regulatory reforms.

Some of these statutes developed by the Review included:

=== Regulations ===
A range of new regulations was also generated by the Review. In the majority of cases, the regulations were advertised publicly in draft form accompanied by regulatory impact statements, and made available for comment by individuals, the community and affected industries.&lt;ref&gt;For example, the Transport (Conduct) Regulations 2005 and the Transport (Ticketing) Regulations 2006 were both subject to such processes.  Copies of regulatory impact statements for these regulations are available from the website of the Victorian Competition and Efficiency Commission&amp;nbsp;– www.vcec.vic.gov.au.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Organisational impacts ===
The work of the Transport Legislation Review had significant impacts on governance arrangements in the Victorian Transport portfolio.  These effects can be summarised as follows:

{{columns-list|colwidth=25em|
* the [[Rail Safety Act|Rail Safety Act 2006]] and the Transport Legislation (Safety Investigations) Act 2006 developed by the Review created Victoria's first independent safety offices&amp;nbsp;– the [[Director, Public Transport Safety]] and the Chief Investigator, Public Transport and Marine Safety Investigations
* the [[Accident Towing Services Act|Accident Towing Services Act 2007]] transferred responsibility for towing industry regulation from the [[Director of Public Transport]] to [[VicRoads]]
* the [[Transport Integration Act]] merged the former marine safety regulator&amp;nbsp;– the Director of Marine Safety&amp;nbsp;– into the public transport safety regulator to create a new integrated transport safety regulator for the State (the [[Director, Transport Safety]])
* a number of proposals increased the powers of the [[Director of Public Transport]] variously over taxi and bus regulation
* the Major Transport Projects Facilitation Act 2009 changed planning approvals procedures for major transport projects thereby having a significant impact on State planning agencies
* the [[Transport Integration Act]] re-established the agencies and offices that comprise the Victorian transport portfolio and gave each a new statutory charter and in some cases, revised powers
* the [[Transport Integration Act]] extended transport regulation coverage in a major way across the planning and local government agencies for the first time
* the [[Transport Integration Act]]&lt;ref&gt;As amended by the Transport Legislation Amendment (Ports Integration) Act 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; brought land based and water-based transport together for the first time under a single statutory framework in Victoria.

=== Legislative structure impacts ===
The Review had major impacts on Victoria's transport legislation suite.  Before the Review, Victoria's suite of legislation was divided into land-based and water-based groupings.  The land-based group covering rail and road statutes and associated activities was headed by the [[Transport Act 1983]].  By contrast, the water-based grouping regulating the ports and marine sectors had no central coordinating statute.   Both groupings were characterised by old and inconsistent underlying policy frameworks.

The [[Transport Integration Act]] was developed by the Review to provide a central statute to facilitate integration and co-ordination of the whole transport portfolio through the introduction of a modern policy framework and re-establishment of agencies with consistent charters which were tied bound by the framework.   The development of the Transport Integration Act also ultimately led to the subordination and renaming of the Transport Act as the [[Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act 1983]].

Further complex and discrete structural changes were driven by the Review through policy reviews and the development of new individual statutory schemes.   For example, the work of the Review led to Victoria's first ever stand alone statutory schemes for rail and bus safety (the [[Rail Safety Act]] and [[Bus Safety Act]]), vehicle towing regulation (the [[Accident Towing Services Act]]), reduction of red tape in respect of approval and delivery of major transport projects (the Major Transport Projects Facilitation Act), tourist railways regulation (the [[Tourist and Heritage Railways Act]]) and public transport ticketing requirements (the Transport (Ticketing) Regulations).

== Incomplete or pending reviews ==
The work of the Transport Legislation Review concluded in late 2010.  Major areas signalled for overhaul before the conclusion of the project&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the [http://tex.parliament.vic.gov.au/bin/texhtmlt?form=VicHansard.dumpall&amp;db=hansard91&amp;dodraft=0&amp;house=ASSEMBLY&amp;speech=8582&amp;activity=Second+Reading&amp;title=TRANSPORT+INTEGRATION+BILL&amp;date1=10&amp;date2=December&amp;date3=2009&amp;query=true%0a%09and+%28+activity+contains+'Second+Reading'+%29%0a%09and+%28+hdate.hdate_3+=+2009+%29%0a%09and+%28+hdate.hdate_2+contains+'December'+%29%0a%09and+%28+house+contains+'ASSEMBLY'+%29%0a second reading speech] and the [http://www.legislation.vic.gov.au/domino/Web_Notes/LDMS/PubPDocs.nsf/ee665e366dcb6cb0ca256da400837f6b/98F3688CCE1FCE19CA257685007B58C7/$FILE/561223exi1.pdf explanatory memorandum] for the Transport Integration Bill.  Copies of documents sourced from the [http://www.legislation.vic.gov.au/ official Victorian Government legislation site].&lt;/ref&gt; included policy reviews and new statutes in the following areas:
* Taxi and Hire Car regulation
* Walking and Cycling
* Road Safety
* Port Management
* compliance, enforcement and other matters covered by the [[Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act 1983]].

Taxi industry reform was taken up as a major issue by the [[Victorian Government]] when the Review concluded.  The Government established a [[Taxi Industry Inquiry]] in May 2011 under a new agency, the [[Taxi Services Commission]].   The Inquiry ultimately recommended major changes to policy and legislation to reform the taxi and small commercial passenger vehicles sector.  The recommendations are currently being implemented.

== Support and criticism ==
The Transport Legislation Review project and its policy and legislation projects were well supported during the term of the project.  Most Acts and regulations generated by the project were passed or made with broad support and little or no opposition from affected parties.  In the six years of the project, no Act or regulation failed to be passed by the [[Victorian Parliament]] even when the Government of the day did not control Parliamentary numbers.  The overwhelming majority of Act products, for example, were passed by Parliament with all party support.

While the Review was not subject to public criticism, some individual policy and legislative proposals arising from it were criticised. For example, the [[Rail Safety Act|Rail Safety Act 2006]] was opposed on a reasoned basis in the [[Victorian Parliament]] by Liberal and National party members of Parliament.  However, the Bill was ultimately passed.&lt;ref&gt;A reasoned amendment calling for the withdrawal of the Bill was defeated in the Victorian Parliament on 1 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Several policy proposals developed  by the project including in 2009 during a review of the Marine Act 1988 were abandoned and not included in the subsequent Marine Safety Act 2010 due to widespread opposition.

The Bill for the [[Transport Integration Act]] was criticised by Liberal and National party members during its passage through Parliament&lt;ref&gt;See Hansard in the [[Legislative Assembly]] on 4 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; but was not opposed.  Finally, a proposal to add port authorities to the [[Transport Integration Act]] organisational framework was opposed and eventually defeated in the [[Legislative Council]] by the Liberal, National and Green parties.&lt;ref&gt;See Hansard for the Legislative Council proceedings on 22 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Bill was later passed by the [[Victorian Parliament]] due to use of a dispute resolution process.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Legislative Assembly]] returned the Bill to the [[Legislative Council]] for its agreement as recommended in the Dispute Resolution Committee of the Parliament on 27 July 2010.   The Bill was subsequently passed by the Legislative Council on 12 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Worshipful Company of Arbitrators''' is 93rd in the order of precedence of the [[Livery Company|Livery Companies]] of the [[City of London]]. The organisation formally became a Livery Company on 17 March 1981. The Company supports education in the field of [[arbitration]]. It also functions as a charitable institution. Its [[motto]] (as displayed beneath its [[coat of arms]]) is ''Law and Custom''.

As with other Livery Companies, there are two main categories of membership: ''[[Liveryman|Liverymen]]'' and ''[[Freedom of the City|Freemen]]''. Its limit of 300 Liverymen was decreed by the Court of [[Alderman|Aldermen]], all of whom must be Freemen of the [[City of London]]. Being admitted as a Liveryman acknowledges a dedication to good government and order. Only Liverymen may be part of the leadership of the Company; the [[Master (form of address)|Master]], the Senior Warden, the Junior Warden and the Court of Assistants; likewise only Liverymen may nominate others for membership.

Company Freemen must be of good character and have an interest in and relevant experience of private dispute resolution (while many of the older Companies' links with their original trades have expired, most of the newer Livery Companies maintain close ties with their vocations).  

The '''Arbitrators' Company''' (as it is alternatively styled) arranges a programme of activities to promote arbitration and interest in arbitration in London.  In such matters it is held to be at the leading edge of ideas and development, in ways which cross boundaries between different dispute resolution specialisations in all fields, including commerce and all business and domestic activities.

The Company has established charitable trusts through which it expects to continue building substantial funds, with the aim of supporting education in the field of arbitration.

It provides members with the opportunity of hearing from distinguished experts in its field and to exchange ideas and views in convivial surroundings. It is also dedicated to the promotion of the City of London as the centre of excellence for International Dispute Resolution.

The Company is a member of the Financial Services Group of Livery Companies, the other 11 members of which are the Worshipful Companies of [[Worshipful Company of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales|Chartered Accountants]], [[Worshipful Company of Actuaries|Actuaries]], [[Worshipful Company of International Bankers|International Bankers]], [[Worshipful Company of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators|Chartered Secretaries and Administrators]], [[Worshipful Company of Insurers|Insurers]], [[Worshipful Company of Information Technologists|Information Technologists]], [[City of London Solicitors' Company|City of London Solicitors]], [[Worshipful Company of Management Consultants|Management Consultants]], [[Worshipful Company of Marketors|Marketors]], [[Worshipful Company of Tax Advisers|Tax Advisers]], and [[Worshipful Company of World Traders|World Traders]].
