      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16886">Across [[Culture of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]], [[proverb]]s are a valued part of speaking, both publicly and in conversations. Afghans "use proverbs in their daily conversations far more than Westerners do, and with greater effect" ([[Edward Zellem]] 2012b: i).

The most extensive proverb collections in Afghan languages are in Dari and Pashto, the two largest languages in Afghanistan. The [[Dari (Persian dialect)|Dari]] language is very similar to [[Persian language|Persian]] spoken in Iran and [[Tajik language|Tajik]] spoken in nearby Tajikistan. A broader, more contextualized, study of '''Afghan proverbs''' would include comparisons of Afghan proverbs with [[q:Persian proverbs|Persian proverbs from Iran]] (for which several volumes are available in English) and with Tajik proverbs (e.g. comparing with those in Bell 2009) from Tajikistan.
[[File:Afghan proverb books.png|thumb|A collection of recent books containing collections of proverbs in three languages of Afghanistan.]]

== Collections ==
So far, [[Paremiography|collections of proverbs]] in Afghan languages are available in English translation for at least four Afghan languages: Dari, Pashto, Pashai, and Balochi.

[[Dari (Persian dialect)|Dari]]: For Dari, there are two main published collections of proverbs, with some overlap between them. The earlier is J. Christy Wilson's collection of 100 (2002), ''One Hundred Afghan Persian Proverbs'', the list having been reproduced (without credit) in other sources.&lt;ref&gt;''Concise English Afghan Dari Dictionary &amp; Proverbs'', Behzad Book Center&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://old.tasvirafghanistan.com/proverbs Wilson's 100 proverbs]&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent main collection of Dari proverbs is the 3rd edition of U.S. Navy Captain [[Edward Zellem]]'s collection, built on the 151 of the 2012 edition, plus 50 more that were submitted via the Web.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Zellem. 2015. Zarbul Masalha. Tampa, FL: Cultures Direct.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, Ruth. 2016. Review of ''Zarbul Masalha: 151 Afghan Dari Proverbs.'' [http://www.jfr.indiana.edu/review.php?id=2026 Online access to review]&lt;/ref&gt; The 2012 edition won a 2013 award from the [[Military Writer's Society of America]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mwsadispatches.com/node/1584 2013 award by MWSA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004215534/http://www.mwsadispatches.com/node/1584 |date=2013-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 151 proverbs of the 2012 edition, 38 were chosen for an edition with color illustrations, intended for language learning by a more popular audience ([https://www.amazon.com/Afghan-Proverbs-Illustrated-Edward-Zellem/dp/1479287458/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1349452578&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=edward+zellem Zellem 2012a]). This edition's format has been published with [http://www.afghanproverbs.com/ translations into a number of languages], including English, Russian (Zellem 2013a), German (Zellem 2013b), French (2013c), and Finnish. There are reports that ''Zarbolmathalhâ'', a collection of 1,152 Dari proverbs collected by Mowlânâ Khâl Mohammad Khaste, was published in 1983 (Kreyenbroek 2010:317). There is also a collection of Dari proverbs with German translations by Noor Nazrabi, ''Afghanische Redensarten und Volksweisheiten''.&lt;ref&gt;Noor Nazrabi. 2014. ''Afghanische Redensarten und Volksweisheiten'', with illustrations by Moshtari Hillal. Hamburg: Afghanistik Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pashto language|Pashto]]: For Pashto, one of the two main languages of Afghanistan, the newest available source is the collection of 151 proverbs by Zellem.&lt;ref&gt;''Mataluna: 151 Afghan Pashto Proverbs''. 2014. Tampa: Cultures Direct.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kulberg, Eve. 2015. Review of ''Mataluna: 151 Afghan Pashto Proverbs''. [http://media.wix.com/ugd/68b8a3_b8e20395ceac4571bdcf6e8d4c5ce1df.pdf Online access].&lt;/ref&gt; A larger collection of Pashto proverbs of 1,350 proverbs is by Bartlotti and Khattak (2006), a revised and expanded version of an earlier work by Tair and Edwards (1982). Enevoldsen published 100 proverbs and 100 ''tapas'' folk poems (1967). An earlier collection was published by Benawa (1979). An older source containing 406 Pashto proverbs is Thorburn's (1876), where he includes them in his book on pp.&amp;nbsp;231–473. Another out-of-print collection is Boyle's ''"Naqluna": Some Pushtu Proverbs and Sayings'' from 1926. The most recent published collection of Pashto proverbs contains 151 proverbs submitted by Pashto speakers via the Web and Twitter (Zellem 2014). There are reports that Nuri published a selection of proverbs from ''Paśto Toləna'' in 1910 (Kreyenbroek 2010:151). There are about 50 pages of Pashto proverbs arranged by topic in a doctoral dissertation by Bartlotti.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard Bartlotti. 2000. Negotiating Pakhto: Proverbs, Islam and the Construction of Identity among Pashtuns. University of Wales: Ph.D. thesis. [http://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.418525 Web access]&lt;/ref&gt; Three additional volumes on Pashto proverbs have also been published in Pakistan, the first by M.M.K. Shinwari,  ''Da mataluno qisay'' (stories of proverbs) in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Shinwari, M. M. K. (1999). ''Da mataluno qisay'' (stories of proverbs). Peshawar: Master Printers, Mohalla Jangi.&lt;/ref&gt; There are two additional volumes printed in Pakistan, both by M. A. Lashkar,  ''Oulasi mataluna'' (Popular proverbs) in 2005&lt;ref&gt;Lashkari, M. A. (2005). ''Oulasi mataluna'' (Popular Proverbs). Peshawar: Zeb Art Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Da mataluno qisay: Ter pa her baqi rozgar'' (Stories of proverbs: Old forgotten new adopted) in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Lashkari, M. A. (2009). ''Da mataluno qisay: Ter pa her baqi rozgar'' (Stories of proverbs: Old forgotten new adopted). Peshawar: Zeb Art Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a collection of proverbs prepared by Boyle in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, Cecil Alexander. 1926. ''"Naqluna": Some Pushtu Proverbs and Sayings.'' Allababad: The Pioneer Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pashai language|Pashai]]: Pashai is a less known language community living east of Kabul. A local committee working with Yun produced a collection of 171 proverbs (2010), each one translated into English, Korean, and Pashto. Lehr has analyzed an aspect of the grammar of proverb use.&lt;ref&gt;p. 293. Lehr, Rachel. 2014. ''A descriptive grammar of Pashai: The language and speech of a community of Darrai Nur.'' Phd dissertation, University of Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Balochi language|Balochi]]: For Balochi, a language spoken on both sides of the Pakistan-Afghan border, Badalkan gives a number of Balochi proverbs translated into English in his article, focusing on proverbs that are related to specific stories (2000). He also cites several published collections of Balochi proverbs, all published in Balochi. Six proverbs are given on the last pages (203, 204) of Dames' 1907 ''Popular poetry of the Baloches''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/popularpoetryba00damegoog scanned copy of ''Popular poetry of the Baloches'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these publications in English, there are items about proverbs in languages spoken in Afghanistan published in other languages. These include:
*An article about [[Waigali language|Waigali]] proverbs in German (Buddruss 1992)
*An article about [[Kyrgyz language|Kyrgyz]] proverbs in Afghanistan, in French (Dor 1982)

== Commonalities ==
Proverbs are often shared across languages when there is significant interaction among peoples. Some examples of shared proverbs among the languages of Afghanistan include:
* "Even on a mountain, there is still a road" found in Dari, Pashai, and Pashto.
* "The wound of the sword/gun will heal, but not that of the tongue" found in Dari, Pashai, and Pashto.
* "If you plan to keep elephants/camels, make your door high" found in Dari, Pashai, and Pashto
* "An intelligent enemy is better than a foolish friend" found in Dari, Pashai, and Pashto, but traceable to [[Al-Ghazali]], an Arab poet of the 11th century.

The proverbs of Afghanistan are not fixed, archaic expressions. For example, there is a traditional proverb in Pashto (Bartlotti and Khattak 2006: 264) and Dari (Wilson 2002:32), "The wound of the sword will heal, but not that of the tongue." The Pashai form of this proverb reflects a more modern form of weapon, "A bad wound by a gun will be cured, but the wound by a bad word won’t be cured" (Yun 2010:159). Another example of an updated proverb is today's Pashai proverb "An unloaded gun makes two people afraid" compared with a Pashto proverb published in 1876 reflecting an older form of military technology "Of the broken bow two persons are in fear" (1876:408).

Not surprisingly, proverbs in all four of the languages documented have proverbs that mention nouns common in Afghanistan, such as "camels", "mountains", and "poverty".

It is not surprising to find proverbs that reflect Afghanistan's Islamic traditions, such as 
*"To repeat the Koran often is good" Pashto (Thorburn 1876:374) 
*"It is the sword that protects Islam" Pashto (Barlotti &amp; Khattak 2006:36) 
*"Saying 'Salam' [an Islamic religious expression] is a sign of true faith" Dari (Wilson 2002: 51) 
* "In childhood you are playful, in youth you are lustful, in old age you are feeble; So when will you before God be worshipful?" Dari (Wilson 2022:54)
* "You have cleansed your body, how will you cleanse your soul?" Pashto (Barlotti &amp; Khattak 2006:48)

A common element among the proverb traditions of Afghanistan is that some proverbs are linked to stories (though this is not unique to Afghanistan). Proverbs that trace their origin to stories are found in Pashto (Thorburn 1876: 314), Dari ([https://www.amazon.com/Zarbul-Masalha-Afghan-Dari-Proverbs/dp/1475093926/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1336013923&amp;sr=8-1 Zellem 2012b:153]), and Balochi (Badalkhan 2000).

==Analysis of Afghan proverbs==
For most Afghan languages, the first challenge is to collect proverbs before analysis can be done. For Pashto, which has the oldest and largest collections of proverbs, there have been two dissertations that analyzed the links between their proverbs and culture. (Though both projects were done with Pashto speakers on the Pakistan side of the border, the findings are expected to apply on the Afghan side of the borders, as well.) The first was about '"pashtunwali" or "pakhto", "the way of the Pashtuns", ... a code of honour embracing the customary law, morality, ethos and notion of ancestral heritage associated with "being Pashtun" and "doing pakhto" '.&lt;ref&gt;p. iii. Leonard Bartlotti. 2000. Negotiating Pakhto: Proverbs, Islam and the Construction of Identity among Pashtuns. University of Wales: Ph.D. thesis. [http://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.418525 Web access]&lt;/ref&gt; The second dissertation 'argues that Pashto proverbs encode and promote a patriarchal view and sexist ideology.'&lt;ref&gt;Sanauddin, Noor. (2015) Proverbs and patriarchy: analysis of linguistic sexism and gender relations among the Pashtuns of Pakistan. University of Glasgow: PhD thesis. [http://theses.gla.ac.uk/6243/1/2015SanauddinPhD.pdf PDF of the dissertation]&lt;/ref&gt; Gender identities and roles as expressed in Pashto proverbs are also described in an article-length presentation. &lt;ref&gt;Khan, Qaisar, Nighat Sultana, Arab Naz. 2015. The Linguistic Representation of Gender Identities in Pakhtu Proverbs. ''NUML Journal of Critical Inquiry''. 13 (2). [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Qaisar_Khan11/publication/305143730_The_Linguistic_Representation_of_Gender_Identities_in_Pakhtu_Proverbs/links/578365c608ae37d3af6b09a3.pdf?origin=publication_list Web access]&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, there is an article about the status of women as seen through Pakhtun proverbs.&lt;ref&gt;Ikram Badshah and Sarfraz Khan. 2017. "Understanding the Status of Women through the Deconstruction of Sexist Proverbs in Pakhtun Society in Pakistan." ''THE 6th INTERNATIONAL ACADEMIC CONFERENCE ON SOCIAL SCIENCES'' pp. 25-29.[file:///C:/Users/Pete%20Unseth/Documents/Badshah%20&amp;%20Khan-%20Pakhtun%20sexist%20proverbs.pdf Weblink to the article]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kohistani has written a thesis to show how understanding Afghan Dari proverbs will help Europeans understand Afghan culture.&lt;ref&gt;Kohistani, Zahra. 2011. Understanding culture through proverbs. University of Amsterdam MA thesis. [http://dare.uva.nl/cgi/arno/show.cgi?fid=346423 Online access]&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of proverbs and other artistic language in talking about war and instability in Afghanistan is the subject of a study by Margaret Mills.
&lt;ref&gt;Mills, Margaret A. "Gnomics: Proverbs, Aphorisms, Metaphors, Key Words and Epithets in Afghan Discourses of War and Instability." ''Afghanistan in Ink: Literature Between Diaspora and Nation'' (2013): 229-253.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Attempto Controlled English''' ('''ACE''') is a [[controlled natural language]], i.e. a subset of standard [[English grammar|English]] with a restricted syntax and restricted semantics described by a small set of construction and interpretation rules.&lt;ref name="FLAIRS 2006"&gt;{{cite conference |author1=Norbert E. Fuchs |author2=Kaarel Kaljurand |author3=Gerold Schneider | title = Attempto Controlled English Meets the Challenges of Knowledge Representation, Reasoning, Interoperability and User Interfaces | booktitle = FLAIRS 2006 | date = 2006 | url = http://attempto.ifi.uzh.ch/site/publications/papers/FLAIRS0601FuchsN.pdf | format = [[PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been under development at the [[University of Zurich]] since 1995. In 2013, ACE version 6.7 was announced.&lt;ref&gt;http://attempto.ifi.uzh.ch/site/news/&lt;/ref&gt;

ACE can serve as [[knowledge representation]], [[specification language|specification]], and [[query language]], and is intended for professionals who want to use formal notations and formal methods, but may not be familiar with them. Though ACE appears perfectly natural – it can be read and understood by any speaker of English – it is in fact a [[formal language]].&lt;ref name="FLAIRS 2006"/&gt;

ACE and its related tools have been used in the fields of [[requirements analysis|software specifications]], [[theorem proving]], [[automatic summarization|text summaries]], [[ontologies]], rules, querying, [[health informatics|medical documentation]] and [[planning]].

Here are some simple examples:

# Every woman is a human.
# A woman is a human.
# A man tries-on a new tie. If the tie pleases his wife then the man buys it.

ACE construction rules require that each noun be introduced by a determiner (''a'', ''every'', ''no'', ''some'', ''at least 5'', ...). ACE interpretation rules decide that (1) is interpreted as [[Universal quantification|universally quantified]], while (2) is interpreted as [[Existential quantification|existentially quantified]]. Sentences like "Women are human" do not follow ACE syntax and are consequently not valid.

Interpretation rules resolve the [[Deixis#Anaphoric reference|anaphoric references]] in (3): ''the tie'' and ''it'' of the second sentence refer to ''a new tie'' of the first sentence, while ''his'' and ''the man'' of the second sentence refer to ''a man'' of the first sentence. Thus an ACE text is a coherent entity of anaphorically linked sentences.

The Attempto Parsing Engine (APE) translates ACE texts unambiguously into [[Discourse Representation Theory|discourse representation structures]] (DRS) that use a variant of the language of [[first-order logic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |author1=Norbert E. Fuchs |author2=Kaarel Kaljurand |author3=Tobias Kuhn | title = Discourse Representation Structures for ACE 6.6 | booktitle = Technical Report ifi-2010.0010, Department of Informatics, University of Zurich | date = 2010 | url = http://attempto.ifi.uzh.ch/site/pubs/papers/drs_report_66.pdf| format = [[PDF]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; A DRS can be further translated into other [[formal languages]], for instance AceRules with various semantics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | author = Tobias Kuhn | title = AceRules: Executing Rules in Controlled Natural Language | booktitle = First International Conference on Web Reasoning and Rule Systems (RR 2007) | year = 2007  | url = http://attempto.ifi.uzh.ch/site/pubs/papers/kuhn07acerules.pdf| format = [[PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Web Ontology Language|OWL]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |author1=Kaarel Kaljurand |author2=Norbert E.

Translating an ACE text into (a fragment of) first-order logic allows users to  [[inference|reason]] about the text, for instance to [[formal verification|verify]], to [[formal verification|validate]], and to [[Information retrieval|query]] it.

== Overview ==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}
As an overview of the current version 6.6 of ACE this section:

* Briefly describes the vocabulary
* Gives an account of the syntax
* Summarises the handling of ambiguity
* Explains the processing of anaphoric references.

=== Vocabulary ===

The vocabulary of ACE comprises:

* Predefined function words (e.g. determiners, conjunctions)
* Predefined phrases (e.g. "it is false that ...", "it is possible that ...")
* Content words (e.g. nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs).

=== Grammar ===

The grammar of ACE defines and constrains the form and the meaning of ACE sentences and texts. ACE's grammar is expressed as a set of  [http://attempto.ifi.uzh.ch/site/docs/ace_constructionrules.html  construction rules]. The meaning of sentences is described as a small set of [http://attempto.ifi.uzh.ch/site/docs/ace_interpretationrules.html  interpretation rules]. A [http://attempto.ifi.uzh.ch/site/docs/ace_troubleshooting.html Troubleshooting Guide] describes how to use ACE and how to avoid pitfalls.

==== ACE texts ====

An ACE text is a sequence of declarative sentences that can be anaphorically interrelated. Furthermore, ACE supports questions and commands.

==== Simple sentences ====

A simple sentence asserts that something is the case — a fact, an event, a state.

:The temperature is −2 °C.
:A customer inserts 2 cards.
:A card and a code are valid.

Simple ACE sentences have the following general structure:

:subject + verb + complements + adjuncts

Every sentence has a subject and a verb. Complements (direct and indirect objects) are necessary for transitive verbs (''insert something'') and ditransitive verbs (''give something to somebody''), whereas adjuncts (adverbs, prepositional phrases) are optional.

All elements of a simple sentence can be elaborated upon to describe the situation in more detail. To further specify the nouns ''customer'' and ''card'', we could add adjectives:

:A trusted customer inserts two valid cards.

possessive nouns and ''of''-prepositional phrases:

:John's customer inserts a card of Mary.

or variables as appositions:

:John inserts a card A.

Other modifications of nouns are possible through relative sentences:

:A customer who is trusted inserts a card that he owns.

which are described below since they make a sentence composite. We can also detail the insertion event, e.g. by adding an adverb:

:A customer inserts some cards manually.

or, equivalently:

:A customer manually inserts some cards.

or, by adding prepositional phrases:

:A customer inserts some cards into a slot.

We can combine all of these elaborations to arrive at:

:John's customer who is trusted inserts a valid card of Mary manually into a slot A.

==== Composite sentences ====

Composite sentences are recursively built from simpler sentences through [[coordination (linguistics)|coordination]], [[subordination (linguistics)|subordination]], [[Quantification (linguistics)|quantification]], and [[negation]]. Note that ACE composite sentences overlap with what linguists call compound sentences and complex sentences.

===== Coordination =====

Coordination by ''and'' is possible between sentences and between phrases of the same syntactic type.

:A customer inserts a card and the machine checks the code.
:There is a customer who inserts a card and who enters a code.
:A customer inserts a card and enters a code.
:An old and trusted customer enters a card and a code.

Note that the coordination of the noun phrases ''a card'' and ''a code'' represents a plural object.

Coordination by ''or'' is possible between sentences, verb phrases, and relative clauses.

:A customer inserts a card or the machine checks the code.
:A customer inserts a card or enters a code.
:A customer owns a card that is invalid or that is damaged.

Coordination by ''and'' and ''or'' is governed by the standard binding order of logic, i.e. ''and'' binds stronger than ''or''. Commas can be used to override the standard binding order. Thus the sentence:

:A customer inserts a VisaCard or inserts a MasterCard, and inserts a code.

means that the customer inserts a VisaCard and a code, or alternatively a MasterCard and a code.

===== Subordination =====

There are four constructs of subordination: relative sentences, ''if-then'' sentences, modality, and sentence subordination.

Relative sentences starting with ''who'', ''which'', and ''that'' allow to add detail to nouns:

:A customer who is trusted inserts a card that he owns.

With the help of ''if-then'' sentences we can specify conditional or hypothetical situations:

:If a card is valid then a customer inserts it.

Note the anaphoric reference via the pronoun ''it'' in the ''then''-part to the noun phrase ''a card'' in the ''if''-part.

Modality allows us to express possibility and necessity:

:A trusted customer can/must insert a card.
:It is possible/necessary that a trusted customer inserts a card.

Sentence subordination comes in various forms:

:It is true/false that a customer inserts a card.
:It is not provable that a customer inserts a card.
:A clerk believes that a customer inserts a card.

===== Quantification =====

Quantification allows us to speak about all objects of a certain class ([[universal quantification]]), or to denote explicitly the existence of at least one object of this class ([[existential quantification]]). The textual occurrence of a universal or existential quantifier opens its scope that extends to the end of the sentence, or in coordinations to the end of the respective coordinated sentence.

To express that all involved customers insert cards we can write

:Every customer inserts a card.

This sentence means that each customer inserts a card that may, or may not, be the same as the one inserted by another customer. To specify that all customers insert the same card — however unrealistic that situation seems — we can write:

:A card is inserted by every customer.

or, equivalently:

:There is a card that every customer inserts.

To state that every card is inserted by a customer we write:

:Every card is inserted by a customer.

or, somewhat indirectly:

:For every card there is a customer who inserts it.

===== Negation =====

Negation allows us to express that something is not the case:

:A customer does not insert a card.
:A card is not valid.

To negate something for all objects of a certain class one uses ''no'':

:No customer inserts more than 2 cards.

or, ''there is no'':

:There is no customer who inserts a card.

To negate a complete statement one uses sentence negation:

:It is false that a customer inserts a card.

These forms of negation are logical negations, i.e. they state that something is provably not the case. Negation as failure states that a state of affairs cannot be proved, i.e. there is no information whether the state of affairs is the case or not.

:It is not provable that a customer inserts a card.

==== Queries ====

ACE supports two forms of queries: ''yes/no''-queries and ''wh''-queries.

''Yes/no''-queries ask for the existence or non-existence of a specified situation. If we specified:

:A customer inserts a card.

then we can ask:

:Does a customer insert a card?

to get a positive answer. Note that interrogative sentences always end with a question mark.

With the help of ''wh''-queries, i.e. queries with query words, we can interrogate a text for details of the specified situation. If we specified:

:A trusted customer inserts a valid card manually in the morning in a bank.

we can ask for each element of the sentence with the exception of the verb.

:Who inserts a card?
:Which customer inserts a card?
:What does a customer insert?
:How does a customer insert a card?
:When does a customer enter a card?
:Where does a customer enter a card?

Queries can also be constructed by a sequence of declarative sentences followed by one interrogative sentence, for example:

:There is a customer and there is a card that the customer enters. Does a customer enter a card?

==== Commands ====

ACE also supports commands. Some examples:

:John, go to the bank!
:John and Mary, wait!
:Every dog, bark!
:A brother of John, give a book to Mary!

A command always consists of a noun phrase (the addressee), followed by a comma, followed by an uncoordinated verb phrase. Furthermore, a command has to end with an exclamation mark.

=== Constraining ambiguity ===

To constrain the ambiguity of full natural language ACE employs three simple means:

* Some ambiguous constructs are not part of the language; unambiguous alternatives are available in their place
* All remaining ambiguous constructs are interpreted deterministically on the basis of a small number of interpretation rules
* Users can either accept the assigned interpretation, or they must rephrase the input to obtain another one.

==== Avoidance of ambiguity ====

In natural language, relative sentences combined with coordinations can introduce ambiguity:

:A customer inserts a card that is valid and opens an account.

In ACE the sentence has the unequivocal meaning that the customer opens an account, as reflected by the paraphrase:

:A card is valid. A customer inserts the card. The customer opens an account.

To express the alternative — though not very realistic — meaning that the card opens an account, the relative pronoun ''that'' must be repeated, thus yielding a coordination of relative sentences:

:A customer inserts a card that is valid and that opens an account.

This sentence is unambiguously equivalent in meaning to the paraphrase:

:A card is valid. The card opens an account. A customer inserts the card.

==== Interpretation rules ====

Not all ambiguities can be safely removed from ACE without rendering it artificial. To deterministically interpret otherwise syntactically correct ACE sentences we use a small set of interpretation rules. For example, if we write:

:A customer inserts a card with a code.

then ''with a code'' attaches to the verb ''inserts'', but not to ''a card''. However, this is probably not what we meant to say. To express that ''the code'' is associated with ''the card'' we can employ the interpretation rule that a relative sentence always modifies the immediately preceding noun phrase, and rephrase the input as:

:A customer inserts a card that carries a code.

yielding the paraphrase:

:A card carries a code. A customer inserts the card.

or — to specify that the customer inserts a card and a code — as:

:A customer inserts a card and a code.

=== Anaphoric references ===

Usually ACE texts consist of more than one sentence:

:A customer enters a card and a code. If a code is valid then SimpleMat accepts a card.

To express that all occurrences of card and code should mean the same card and the same code, ACE provides anaphoric references via the definite article:

:A customer enters a card and a code. If the code is valid then SimpleMat accepts the card.

During the processing of the ACE text, all anaphoric references are replaced by the most recent and most specific accessible noun phrase that agrees in gender and number. As an example of "most recent and most specific", suppose an ACE parser is given the sentence:

:A customer enters a red card and a blue card.

Then:

:The card is correct.

refers to the second card, while:

:The red card is correct.

refers to the first card.

Noun phrases within ''if-then'' sentences, universally quantified sentences, negations, modality, and subordinated sentences cannot be referred to anaphorically from subsequent sentences, i.e. such noun phrases are not "accessible" from the following text. Thus for each of the sentences:

:If a customer owns a card then he enters it.
:Every customer enters a card.
:A customer does not enter a card.
:A customer can enter a card.
:A clerk believes that a customer enters a card.

we cannot refer to ''a card'' with:

:The card is correct.

Anaphoric references are also possible via personal pronouns:

:A customer enters a card and a code. If it is valid then SimpleMat accepts the card.

or via variables:

:A customer enters a card ''X'' and a code ''Y''. If ''Y'' is valid then SimpleMat accepts ''X''.

Anaphoric references via definite articles and variables can be combined:

:A customer enters a card ''X'' and a code ''Y''. If the code ''Y'' is valid then SimpleMat accepts the card ''X''.

Note that proper names like ''SimpleMat'' always refer to the same object.

'''Balinese''', or simply '''Bali''', is a [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian language]] spoken by 3.3 million people ({{As of|2000|lc=on}}) on the [[Indonesia]]n island of [[Bali]] as well as northern [[Nusa Penida]], western [[Lombok]] and eastern [[Java]].&lt;ref&gt;Ethnologue.&lt;/ref&gt; Most Balinese speakers also know [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]. Balinese itself is not [[mutually intelligible]] with Indonesian but may be understood by [[Javanese language|Javanese]] speakers after some exposure.{{cn|date=September 2016}}

In 2011, the Bali Cultural Agency estimated that the number of people still using the Balinese language in their daily lives on the [[Bali]] Island does not exceed 1 million, as in urban areas their parents only introduce the [[Indonesian language]] or even English, while daily conversations in the institutions and the mass media have disappeared. The written form of the Balinese language is increasingly unfamiliar, and most Balinese people use the Balinese language only as a means of oral communication, often mixing it with Indonesian in their daily speech. But in the transmigration areas outside Bali Island, the Balinese language is extensively used and believed to play an important role in the survival of the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/03/30/balinese-language-will-never-die.html |title=Balinese language ‘will never die’ |date=March 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The higher [[Register (sociolinguistics)|registers]] of the language borrow extensively from Javanese: an old form of classical Javanese, [[Kawi language|Kawi]], is used in Bali as a [[Liturgical language|religious]] and ceremonial language.

===Stress===
Stress falls on the last syllable.&lt;ref name=Spitzing /&gt;

==Grammar==

The word order is similar to that of [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], and verb and noun [[inflection]]al [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] is similarly minimal.  However, [[Derivation (linguistics)|derivational]] morphology is extensive, and suffixes are applied to indicate definite or indefinite articles, and optionally to indicate [[genitive case|possession]].&lt;ref name="Spitzing" /&gt;

===Registers{{anchor|Registers}}===
Balinese has different [[Register (sociolinguistics)|registers]] depending on the relationship and status of those speaking: low (''basa ketah''), middle (''basa madia''), and high (''basa singgih''). ''Basa singgih'' contains many [[loanword]]s from [[Sanskrit]] and [[Javanese language|Javanese]].

==Numerals==
{{main|Balinese numerals}}
Balinese has a decimal numeral system, but this is complicated by numerous words for intermediate quantities such as 45, 175, and 1600.

==Writing==
Balinese has been written in two different [[writing system]]s: the [[Balinese script]], and in modern times the [[Latin script]].

===Balinese script===
[[File:Hanacaraka-bali.svg|thumb|400px|Basic signs of the Balinese script&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;Note: The script is arranged in Javanese order.&lt;/small&gt;]]
{{Main|Balinese script}}
The Balinese script (''Aksara Bali'', {{Script|Bali|ᬅᬓ᭄ᬱᬭᬩᬮᬶ}}), which is arranged as ''[[Balinese script|Hanacaraka]]'' ({{Script|Bali|ᬳᬦᬘᬭᬓ}}), is an [[abugida]], ultimately derived from the [[Brāhmī script]] of [[India]]. The earliest known inscriptions date from the 11th century AD.

Few people today are familiar with the Balinese script.&lt;ref&gt;Omniglot.&lt;/ref&gt; The Balinese Script is almost the same as [[Javanese script]].

===Latin alphabet===
Schools in Bali today teach a Latin alphabet known as ''Tulisan Bali''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.balivision.com/Article_Resources/TheBaliniseLanguage.asp The Balinese Languages by Fred B Eiseman, Jr] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/66jAyRvtI?url=http://balibagusholiday.com/ |date=2012-04-06 }} – Bali Vision&lt;/ref&gt;

==Note==
&lt;small&gt;
{{note|1|1}} In Balinese script, [[Sanskrit]] and [[Kawi language|Kawi]] loanword has different orthography than native words. The first Balinese script is influenced by orthography of [[Sanskrit]] and [[Kawi language|Kawi]] as word ''[[bahasa|basa]]'' derives from the Sanskrit word भाषा ''bhāṣā''. Meanwhile, diacritics is not written in current romanization of Balinese language. Thus, {{script|Bali|ᬪᬵᬱᬩᬮᬶ}} and ''basa Bali'' are the standard forms.

'''Bartholomäus Metlinger''' (born in [[Augsburg]] - died c.1491) was a German physician of the late [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;Scheibenreiter, page 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Metlinger graduated in 1470 at the [[University of Bologna]]. He was city physician in [[Nördlingen]] from 1476 to 1483, when he took the same position in [[Augsburg]], probably succeeding his late father Peter Metlinger.

His most famous work ''Kinderbüchlein'' ("Little Book on Children") was published on 7 December 1473, being retitled on later editions as ''Ein Regiment der jungen Kinder'' (A Guide on Young Children).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.europeana.eu/resolve/record/03486/BibliographicResource_1000128570713|title=Ein Regiment der jungen Kinder|author=Metlinger, Bartholomäus |accessdate=2014-09-25 |publisher=Europeana}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first German-language work on [[Pediatrics]]. In it, Metlinger deals with the care of infants and small children up to the age of seven. The book describes several childhood diseases and their treatments, besides providing educational advice. It also contains one of the first known written definitions of a [[pacifier]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8814">{{other uses|Bodily Harm (disambiguation)}}

'''Bodily harm''' is a legal term of art used in the definition of both [[statutory]] and [[common law]] offences in [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[England and Wales]] and other common law jurisdictions. It is a synonym for [[injury]] or [[bodily injury]] and similar expressions, though it may be used with a precise and limited meaning in any given jurisdiction. The expression [[grievous bodily harm]] first appeared in a statute in [[Lord Ellenborough's Act]] (1803).

==Canada==

In the Canadian [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]], "bodily harm" is defined as "any hurt or injury to a person that interferes with the health or comfort of the person and that is more than merely transient or trifling in nature."&lt;ref&gt;[[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]], [http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-1.html#h-2 RSC 1985, c C-46, s 2 "bodily harm"].&lt;/ref&gt;

==England and Wales==

The expression is not defined by any statute. It currently appears in a number of offences under the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]] (ss. 18, 20, 23, 26, 28, 29, 31, 35, and 47) and in the offence of [[burglary]] under the [[Theft Act 1968]] (s. 9). It is also used in the definition of [[Murder in English law|murder]] (as it appears in case law) in the guise of grievous bodily harm.

'''Psychiatric disorder'''

Non-physical or ''psychiatric injury'' can be considered "bodily harm" whether "actual" or "grievous", but there must be formal medical evidence to verify the injury.

In R v Ireland, R v Burstow, Lord Steyn said:

{{Blockquote|The proposition that the Victorian legislator when enacting sections 18, 20 and 47 of the Act 1861, would not have had in mind psychiatric illness is no doubt correct. [[Psychiatry]] was in its infancy in 1861.}}

In modern times, the practice of [[statutory interpretation]] frequently refers to the actual intention of the draftsman as expressed in the words of the Act, but considered in the light of contemporary knowledge. [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/1993/1.html ''R v. Chan Fook'']&lt;ref&gt;R v Chan Fook [1994] 1 [[Weekly Law Reports|WLR]] 689, [1994] 2 [[All England Law Reports|All ER]] 552, (1993) 99 [[Criminal Appeal Reports|Cr App R]] 147, [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|CA]] (22 October 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; applied this approach.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Hobhouse LJ. said the prosecution "chose to introduce into the case an allegation that even if Mr Martins had suffered no physical injury at all as a result of the assault upon him by the Appellant, he had nevertheless been reduced to a mental state which in itself, without more, amounted to actual bodily harm. The only evidence to which the prosecution could point in support of this allegation was the evidence of Mr Martins that he felt abused and humiliated, that he had been threatened with further violence, and that he was very frightened. There was no medical or psychiatric evidence to support the allegation. There was no evidence that he was in a state of shock at any time prior to receiving the injuries which he suffered as a result of falling from the window."

Hobhouse LJ. said:

{{Blockquote|The first question on the present appeal is whether the inclusion of the word "bodily" is the phrase "actual bodily harm" limits harm to harm to the skin, flesh and bones of the victim. Mr Justice Lynskey rejected this submission. In our judgment he was right to do so. The body of the victim includes all parts of his body, including his organs, his nervous system and his brain. Bodily injury therefore may include injury to any of those parts of his body responsible for his mental and other faculties.}}

He went on to say:

{{Blockquote|Accordingly the phrase "actual bodily harm" is capable of include psychiatric injury. But it does not include mere emotions such as fear or distress nor panic nor does it include, as such, states of mind that are not themselves evidence of some identifiable clinical condition.}}

He said that juries "should not be directed that an assault which causes a hysterical and nervous condition is an assault occasioning actual bodily harm".

This was followed by the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] in [[R v Constanza]],&lt;ref&gt;[1997] 2 Cr App R 492, (1997) The Times, 31 March 1997&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[House of Lords]] which confirmed the principle in [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1997/34.html ''R v Burstow'', ''R v Ireland''].&lt;ref&gt;R v Ireland, R v Burstow [1998] 1 Cr App R 177, [1997] 3 WLR 534, [1998] AC 147, [1997] 4 All ER 225, [[House of Lords|HL]] (24 July 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Ireland caused three women to suffer psychiatric illness. Burstow's victim was fearful of personal violence and was diagnosed as suffering from a severe [[depressive illness]]. The best medical practice today accepts a link between the body and psychiatric injury, so the words "bodily harm" in sections 20 and 47 were capable of covering recognised psychiatric illnesses, such as an [[anxiety disorder]]s or a depressive disorder, which affect the central nervous system of the body. However, to qualify, those neuroses must be more than simple states of fear, or problems in coping with everyday life, which do not amount to psychiatric illnesses.

'''Venereal and other communicable disease'''

See [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2004/1103.html R v. Dica] [2004] EWCA Crim 1103

The Law Commission stated its view that "the deliberate or reckless causing of disease should not be beyond the reach of the criminal law" and there is continuing debate over whether the transmission of [[HIV]] is covered as grievous bodily harm or under sections 22 to 24 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861.

In R v Clarence,&lt;ref&gt;R v Clarence (1888) 22 QBD 23, (1888) 16 Cox 511, (1888) 5 [[Times Law Reports|TLR]] 61, (1888) 53 JP 149, [[Court for Crown Cases Reserved|CCR]]&lt;/ref&gt; it appeared that at a time when the prisoner knew, but his wife did not know, that he was suffering from gonorhoea, he had "connection" with her; that the result was that the disease was communicated to her, and that had she been aware of the prisoner's condition she would not have submitted to the intercourse.

Lord Coleridge CJ., Pollock and Huddleston BB., Stephen, Manisty, Mathew, A L Smith, Wills and Grantham JJ., held that the conduct of the prisoner did not amount to an offence under either section 20 or section 47. Field, Hawkins, Day and Charles JJ. dissented.

Wills J. said "the facts are ... that he infected her, and that from such infection she suffered grievous bodily harm".&lt;ref&gt;R v Clarence (1888) 22 QBD 23 at 27, CCR&lt;/ref&gt;

Hawkins J. said:

{{Blockquote|In this condition of things the prisoner had sexual intercourse with his wife and in doing so communicated to her his disease and thereby caused her grievous bodily harm.&lt;ref&gt;R v Clarence (1888) 22 QBD 23 at 46, CCR&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Field J. said (a footnote has been included in the body of the text, indicated by "(1)"):

{{Blockquote|It is, I think, also clear that if the condition of the man is such that it is an ordinary and natural consequence of the contact to communicate an infectious disease to the woman, and he does so, he does in fact inflict upon her both "actual" and "grievous bodily harm." Such an act produces what a great authority, [[Lord Stowell]], describes as "an injury of a most malignant kind:" see the note to Durant v. Durant. (1) 1 Hagg. Eccl. Cases, 768.&lt;ref&gt;R v Clarence (1888) 22 QBD 23 at 57, CCR&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The remark by Lord Stowell referred to is reprinted at 162 [[English Reports|ER]] [http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/EngR/1828/296.pdf 747]. It is included in footnote (b) to page 745 of that volume of the English Reports and is taken from Popkin v Popkin (Consistory, Hil. Term, 2nd Session, 1794). The report of Durant v Durant referred to begins at 1 Hagg Ecc 733 and 162 ER [http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/EngR/1828/56.pdf 734]. The digitised copy of the from [[CommonLII]] is in two parts.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Unconsciousness'''

See [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2003/266.html T v. DPP] [2003] EWHC 266 (Admin), [2003] Crim LR 622.

'''Hair'''

See DPP v. Smith [2006] EWHC 94 (Admin)

'''Pain or hurt such as persisting headaches, vomiting, pains in joints, stomach aches not caused by physical trauma'''

Mentioned in [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/1997/2564.html R v. Morris (Clarence Barrington)] [1998] Cr App R 386

'''Great pain followed by tenderness and soreness for some time afterwards'''

This may constitute [[actual bodily harm]], even though there is no physically discernible injury. See Reigate Justices ex p.&amp;nbsp;Counsell (1984) 148 JP 193, DC

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29871">{{about|the grammar of Central Atlas Tamazight|the grammar of Berber languages in general|Berber languages}}
[[Central Atlas Tamazight]] (also referred to as just Tamazight&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;While Central Atlas Tamazight is the only Berber language whose speakers use the term ''Tamaziɣt'' to refer to their language regularly and exclusively, other Berber groups also refer to their language using this term along with more common local names.&lt;/ref&gt;) belongs to the [[Northern Berber languages|Northern Berber]] branch of the [[Berber languages]].

As a member of the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] family, '''Tamazight grammar''' has a two-[[grammatical gender|gender]] (''tawsit''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tamazgha.org/uploads/4/2/2/3/422318/amazigh_voice_vol9_n1.pdf The Amazigh Voice] (PDF), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;) system, [[verb–subject–object|VSO]] [[linguistic typology|typology]], [[emphatic consonants]] (realized in Tamazight as [[velarization|velarized]]), and a templatic [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]].

Tamazight has a verbo-nominal distinction, with adjectives being a subset of verbs.&lt;ref name="inalco_syntax"&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.inalco.fr/crb/crb_2/fiches_thema/berbere_syntaxe.htm La Syntaxe de la Langue Berbère ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081130000000/http://www.inalco.fr/crb/crb_2/fiches_thema/berbere_syntaxe.htm |date=November 30, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Sadiqi|1986|pp=22–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nouns ==

Nouns may be masculine or feminine and singular or plural. Definiteness is not marked (even though many loanwords from Arabic contain what was originally the Arabic definite article).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Abdel-Massih|1971b|pp=89–90, 92–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Normally plurals end in /-n/, singular masculines have the prefix /a-/ and plurals /i-/, and feminines have the [[circumfix]] {{IPA|/t(a)...t(ː)/}} in singular and {{IPA|/t(i)...(in/t)/}} in plural.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Abdel-Massih|1971b|pp=88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Ayt Seghrouchen initial /a/ is dropped in many singular nouns, though their plurals and construct states are similar to Ayt Ayache.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Abdel-Massih|1971b|p=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plurals may either involve a regular change ("sound plurals"), internal vowel change ("broken plurals"), or a combination of the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Abdel-Massih|1971b|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some plurals are mixed, e.g. {{IPA|/tafust/}} ('hand') &gt; {{IPA|/tifusin/}} ('hands').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Abdel-Massih|1971b|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Native masculine singular nouns usually start with {{IPA|/a(m)-/}} in singular and {{IPA|/i-/}} in plural, and "sound plurals" (as opposed to "broken plurals" which also take the suffix {{IPA|/-n/}} in plural).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Abdel-Massih|1971b|pp=93–94}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suffix undergoes the following assimilatory rules:

* {{IPA|/-n/ + /-n/}} &gt; {{IPA|/-nː/}} (in AA and AS)
* {{IPA|/-r/ + /-n/}} &gt; {{IPA|/-rː/}} (only AA)
* {{IPA|/-l/ + /-n/}} &gt; {{IPA|/-lː/}}) (only AA) &lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Abdel-Massih|1971b|pp=100, 126–127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Native feminine usually are surrounded by {{IPA|/t...(t)/}} (or {{IPA|/m...t/}}) in the singular. "Sound" plurals usually take {{IPA|/t(i/u)...n/}} and "Broken" plurals {{IPA|/ti-/}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Abdel-Massih|1971b|pp=95–96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples:.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Abdel-Massih|1971b|pp=97–112}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: /'''a'''xam/-/'''i'''xam'''n'''/ 'big tent(s)' (m)
: /'''a'''maziɣ/-/'''i'''maziɣ'''n'''/ 'Berber(s)' (m)
: /'''a'''daʃu//-/'''i'''d'''u'''ʃ'''a'''/ 'sandal(s)' (m)
: /'''a'''srdun/-/'''i'''srd'''a'''n/ 'mule(s)' (m)
: /'''ta'''xam'''t'''/-/'''ti'''xam'''in'''/ 'tent(s)' (f)
: /'''ta'''funas'''t'''/-/'''ti'''funas'''in'''/ 'cow(s)' (f)
: /'''ta'''grtil'''t'''/-/'''ti'''grt'''a'''l/ 'mat(s)' (f)
: /'''ta'''mazir'''t'''/-/'''ti'''m'''i'''z'''a'''r/ 'property(ies)' (f)

Nouns may be put into the [[construct state]] (contrasting with [[Free state (grammar)|free state]]) to indicate possession, or when the subject of a verb follows the verb. This is also used for nouns following numerals and some prepositions (note that {{IPA|/ɣɾ/}}, 'to', only requires this for feminine nouns), as well as the word {{IPA|/d-/}} ('and').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Abdel-Massih|1971b|pp=121–123}}&lt;/ref&gt; The construct state is formed as follows:

* In masculine nouns:
: Initial {{IPA|/a/}} &gt; {{IPA|/u, wː, wa/}}
: Initial {{IPA|/i/}} &gt; {{IPA|/i, j, ji/}}
: Initial {{IPA|/u/}} &gt; {{IPA|/wu/}}
* In feminine nouns:
: Initial {{IPA|/ta/}} &gt; {{IPA|/t/}} or rarely {{IPA|/ta/}}
: Initial {{IPA|/ti/}} &gt; {{IPA|/t/}} or rarely {{IPA|/ti/}}
: Initial {{IPA|/tu/}} &gt; {{IPA|/tu/}} &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Abdel-Massih|1971b|pp=119–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples (in AA):&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
: {{IPA|/babuxam/}} (&lt; {{IPA|/axam/}}) 'head of the house'
: {{IPA|/ijːs ntslit/}} (&lt; {{IPA|/tislit/}}) 'the horse of the bride'

== Pronouns ==
Tamazight's use of [[possessive suffix]]es mirrors that of many other [[Afroasiatic languages]].

# of verbs and prepositions
# whether objective pronouns are prefixed or suffixed is determined by various factors
# -inw is used when the noun ends in a consonant
# In Ayt Ayache these have the allomorphs {{IPA|/-ʃ/}}, {{IPA|/-m/}}, {{IPA|/-s/}}, etc. after prepositions. These mutate after {{IPA|/-d/}} (e.g. in {{IPA|/ad-/}}).

Ayt Seghrouchen also has a special set of suffixes for future transitive verbs (which combine with the future marker {{IPA|/ad-/}}):

|}

Independent possessives are formed by attaching the possessive suffixes to {{IPA|/wi-/}} (if the object possessed is masculine) or {{IPA|/ti-/}}' (for feminine), e.g. {{IPA|/winw/}} ('mine').

Special possessive suffixes are used with kinship terms.

Emphatics are formed with the word {{IPA|/nːit/}}, e.g. {{IPA|/nkː nːit/}} ('I myself').

# Ayt Ayache

When {{IPA|/-a/}} / {{IPA|/-u/}} / {{IPA|/-inː/}} is suffixed to a noun ending in {{IPA|/a/}} or {{IPA|/u/}} epenthetic {{IPA|/j/}} is inserted, e.g. {{IPA|/tabardaja/}} ('this pack-saddle').

Other deictic suffixes: {{IPA|/-dːɣ/}} ('this'), {{IPA|/-nːa/}} ('that'), e.g. {{IPA|/tadːartdːɣ/}} ('this house'), {{IPA|/tadːartnːa/}} ('that house').

== Verbs ==

Verbs are marked for [[grammatical tense|tense]], [[grammatical aspect|aspect]], [[grammatical mode|mode]], [[voice (grammar)|voice]], and [[grammatical polarity|polarity]], and agree with the [[grammatical number|number]], [[grammatical person|person]], and [[grammatical gender|gender]] of the subject.

'''Verb framing'''

[[Satellite framing]] is accomplished with the proximate affix&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;These are "moveable affixes", like the object pronominal affixes, and whether they are prefixed or suffixed depends on environmental factors&lt;/ref&gt; /d/ (/dː/ in AS) and remote /nː/, e.g. /dːu/ 'to go' yields /i-dːa/ 'he went', /i-dːa-d/ 'he came', /i-dːa-nː/ 'he went there' (in AS the verb /rˠaħ/ 'to go' is used instead)&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Abdel-Massih|1971b|pp=154–155, 216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Voice'''

Derived verb stems may be made from basic verb stems to create causatives, reciprocals, recipro-causatives, passives, or habituals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Abdel-Massih|1971b|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Causatives are derived from unaugmented stems with the prefix /s(ː)-/.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;This is a feature of many [[Afro-Asiatic languages]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Abdel-Massih|1971b|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:/ħudr/ 'bend' &gt; /'''s'''ħudr/

Habituals are derived from unaugmented and reciprocal/recipro-causative stems with the prefix /tː-/ (sometimes with internal change), from causatives by an infixed vowel, and from passives by an optional infixed vowel:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Abdel-Massih|1971b|pp=176, 179, 181–182}}&lt;/ref&gt;
/fa/ 'yawn' &gt; /tːfa/
:(/ħudr/ 'bend' &gt;) /sħudr/ &gt; /sħud'''u'''r/
:(/ʕum/ 'swim' &gt; /mːsʕum/ &gt;) /'''tː'''mːsʕum/
:(/bdr/ 'mention' &gt; /tːubdr/ &gt;) /tːubd'''a'''r/

Reciprocals are formed with the prefix /m(ː)-/, and recipro-causatives with /-m(ː)s-/, sometimes with internal change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Abdel-Massih|1971b|pp=180–181}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: /sal/ 'ask' &gt; /'''mː'''sal/

Passives are formed with the prefix /tːu-/:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Abdel-Massih|1971b|pp=181–182}}&lt;/ref&gt;
/ħnːa/ 'pity' &gt; /'''tːu'''ħnːa/

'''Tense, mode, and subject'''

{{IPA|/ad-/}} marks future tense, {{IPA|/is-/}} marks interrogative mode, and {{IPA|/ur-/}} marks negative mode.

Pronominal complement markers cliticize to the verb, with the indirect object preceding the direct object, e.g. /izn-as-t/ "he sold it to him".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.univie.ac.at/linguistics/tagungen/phon02/wopal/abstracts/wopal_louali_and_philippson.pdf Vowel apophony and underlying segments in Siwa Berber (Egypt)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Central Atlas Tamazight uses a bipartate negative construction (e.g. /uriffiɣ ʃa/ 'he didn't go out') which apparently was modeled after proximate [[Arabic language|Arabic]] varieties, in a common development known as [[Jespersen's Cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.pwf.cam.ac.uk/cbl23/ContactRevised170708.pdf Contact-induced grammatical change: towards an explicit account]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (PDF), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; This is a phenomenon where a postverbal item is reanalyzed as being an element of a discontinuous negation marker composed of it and the preverbal negation marker.&lt;ref name="jespersen"&gt;[http://people.pwf.cam.ac.uk/cbl23/revisedjesaraber.pdf Jespersen's Cycle in Arabic and Berber]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (PDF), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; It is present in multiple Berber varieties, and is argued to have originated in neighboring Arabic and been adopted by contact.&lt;ref name="jespersen" /&gt;

Standard negation is accompanied by a negative indefinite pronoun, ''walu''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linguistics.berkeley.edu/~syntax-circle/syntax-group/spr08/miestamo.pdf Negation – An Overview of Typological Research] (PDF), pp. 13-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tamazight has a [[null copula]].&lt;ref name="inalco_syntax" /&gt; The words {{IPA|/ɡ/}} {{IPA|/iʒ/}} 'to be, to do' may function as a copula in Ayt Ayache and Ayt Seghrouchen respectively, especially in structures preceded by /aj/ 'who, which, what'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Abdel-Massih|1971a|p=298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Arabic loans have been integrated into the Tamazight verb lexicon. They adhere fully to patterns of native stems, and may even undergo ablaut.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Abdel-Massih|1971b|p=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ablaut'''

In Ayt Ayache, [[ablaut]] occurs only in affirmative and/or negative past (in applicable verb classes). Types of ablaut include Ø:i/a,  Ø:i, and a:u, which may be accompanied by [[Metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Abdel-Massih|1971b|pp=161–166}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Ayt Seghrouchen types of ablaut include Ø:i (in negative), i/a, i/u, a-u, and a-i.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Abdel-Massih|1971b|pp=218–219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Adjectives ==

Adjectives come after the noun the modify, and inflect for number and gender:&lt;ref&gt;[http://wals.info/languoid/lect/wals_code_bma WALS - Beber (Middle Atlas)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="s23"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Sadiqi|1986|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- examples from Sadiqi: --&gt;
: /argaz amʕdur/ 'the foolish man' (lit. 'man foolish')
: /tamtˤot tamʕdurt/ 'the foolish woman' &lt;!-- /o/ can't be phonemic! --&gt;
: /irgzen imʕdar/ 'the foolish men'
: /tajtʃin timʕdar/ 'the foolish women'

Adjectives may also occur alone, in which case they become an NP.&lt;ref name="s23" /&gt;

Practically all adjectives also have a verbal form used for predicative purposes, which behaves just like a normal verb:&lt;ref name="s23" /&gt;
: /i-mmuʕdr urgaz/ 'the man is foolish' (lit. '3ps-foolish man')
: /argaz i-mmuʕdr-n/ 'the foolish man' [using a non-finite verb]

As such, adjectives may be classed as a subset of verbs which also have other non-verbal features.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Sadiqi|1986|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; However Penchoen (1973:21) argues that they are actually nouns.

'''Prepositions'''

Prepositions include {{IPA|/xf/}} ('on'), {{IPA|/qbl/}} ('before'), {{IPA|/ɣɾ/}} ('to'), and {{IPA|/ɡ/}} ('until'). These may take pronominal suffixes (see Pronouns).

Some prepositions require the following noun to be in the construct state, while others do not.

{{IPA|/n/}} encliticizes onto the following word (which is put into construct state), and assimilates to some initial consonants: it becomes {{IPA|/l/}} before a noun with initial {{IPA|/l/}}, {{IPA|/w/}} before initial {{IPA|/a/}}, and {{IPA|/j/}} before initial {{IPA|/i/}} (note that this creates geminates rather than doubled phonemes, e.g. {{IPA|/ʃa lːħlib/}} 'some milk').&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Abdel-Massih|1971b|pp=124–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nouns with initial {{IPA|/a/}} normally drop in when following {{IPA|/ʃa/}} 'some of', e.g. {{IPA|/ʃa wksum/}} (&lt; |{{IPA|ʃa n aksum}}|) 'some meat', but some don't, following the normal rules of construct state, e.g. {{IPA|/ʃa wːataj/}} (&lt; |{{IPA|ʃa n ataj}}|) 'some tea'.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

'''Conjunctions'''

The conjunction {{IPA|/d/}} 'and' requires construct state, and also assimilates to a following {{IPA|/t/}}, e.g. {{IPA|/aɣjul tːfunast/}} 'the donkey and the cow'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Abdel-Massih|1971b|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Numerals ==

'''Cardinal numerals'''

The first few (1-3 in Ayt Ayache, 1-2 in Ayt Seghrouchen) cardinal numerals have native Berber and borrowed [[Arabic language|Arabic]] forms. The Arabic numerals are only used for counting in order and for production of higher numbers when combined with the tens.

|-

| {{IPA|/ʃɾatː/}}
|}
All higher cardinals are borrowed from Arabic. This is consistent with the [[linguistic universal]]s that the numbers 1-3 are much more likely to be retained, and that a borrowed number generally implies that numbers greater than it are also borrowed. The retention of one is also motivated by the fact that Berber languages near-universally use unity as a determiner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ling.cam.ac.uk/camling/Manuscripts/CamLing2007_Souag.pdf The Typology of Number Borrowing in Berber] (PDF), p. 240.&lt;br /&gt;[http://lameen.googlepages.com/berber-numbers.pdf The Typology of Number Borrowing in Berber (slideshow)] (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt;

The numbers 3-9 have special apocopated forms, used before the words {{IPA|/snin/}} ('years'), {{IPA|/mjːa/}} ('100'), {{IPA|/alaf/}} ('1,000'), and {{IPA|/mlajn/}} ('million'), e.g. {{IPA|/sbʕ snin/}} ('7 years'; without the preposition {{IPA|/n/}}).

Cardinal numbers precede the modified noun, connected by the preposition {{IPA|/n/}} (optional for the number 1).&lt;ref&gt;C.f. {{Harvcoltxt|Abdel-Massih|1971b|pp=23–25, 27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The procliticization-triggered phonological change of {{IPA|/n/}} may cause {{IPA|/jun/}} / {{IPA|/jut/}} and {{IPA|/sin/}} to become proclitics {{IPA|/ju-/}}, {{IPA|/si-/}}, e.g. {{IPA|/julːʕil/}} ('one boy'), {{IPA|/jutːɾbatː ~ jut ntɾbatː/}} ('one girl'), {{IPA|/siwːaɾːjalː/}} ('two rials').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Abdel-Massih|1971b|pp=23–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When referring to money, {{IPA|/qːlː/}} ('minus') and {{IPA|/ɣiɾ/}} ('except') may be used, for example: {{IPA|/mjːa qːlː/}} / {{IPA|/ɣiɾ ʕʃɾˠa/}} ('90 [rials]'), {{IPA|/mitajn qːlː ʕʃɾin/}} ('180 [rials]'), {{IPA|/mitajn ɣiɾ xmsa/}} ('195 [rials]').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Abdel-Massih|1971b|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nouns following numerals require construct state.

'''Ordinal numerals'''

The word for 'the first' is unique in that it is not derived from a cardinal stem and it inflects for number:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! 'the first'
! singular
! plural
|-
! m
| {{IPA|/amzwaɾu/}}
| {{IPA|/imzwura/}}
|-
! f
| {{IPA|/tamzwaɾutː/}}
| {{IPA|/timzwura/}}
|}

From 'the second' on, ordinals are formed by prefixing {{IPA|/wisː-/}} in the masculine and {{IPA|/tisː-/}} in the feminine (using the native Berber forms of 2 and 3).

'''Fractions'''

There are unique words which may be used for some fractions, although male ordinals can be used for 1/4 on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Abdel-Massih|1971b|pp=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Syntax ==
Word order is usually Verb + Subject [in construct state] but sometimes is Subject [in free state] + Verb, e.g. ({{IPA|/ifːɣ umaziɣ/}} vs. {{IPA|/amaziɣ ifːɣ/}} 'the Berber went out').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Abdel-Massih|1971b|p=295}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tamazight exhibits [[pro-drop]] behavior.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hum2.leidenuniv.nl/pdf/lucl/sole/console12/console12-stoyanova.pdf The typology of multiple wh-questions and language variation] (PDF), p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Questions===

wh- questions are always [[cleft sentence|cleft]]s, and multiple wh-questions are not found.&lt;ref name="Stoyanova 2008 105"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Stoyanova|2008|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that Tamazight cannot grammatically express an equivalent to the English "who saw what?".

Tamazight's clefting, relativisation, and wh-interrogation cause what is called "anti-agreement effects", similarly to [[Shilha language|Shilha]].&lt;ref name="Stoyanova 2008 105"/&gt; This is when the verb doesn't agree with or agrees in a special way with wh-words.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/norvin/www/papers/WampanoagConjunct.pdf The Syntax of the Conjunct and Independent Orders in Wampanoag] (PDF), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; In Berber, the feminine singular prefix {{IPA|/t-/}} disappears when the subject is a wh- phrase, but only for [[affirmative (linguistics)|affirmative]] verbs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/norvin/www/papers/WampanoagConjunct.pdf The Syntac of the Conjunct and Independent Orders in Wampanoag] (PDF), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2874">'''Contrastive distribution''' in [[linguistics]], as opposed to [[complementary distribution]] or [[free variation]], is the relationship between two different elements in which both elements are found in the same environment with a change in meaning.

==Phonology==
In [[phonology]], two sounds of a language are said to be in contrastive distribution if replacing one with the other in the same phonological environment results in a change in meaning. If a sound is in contrastive distribution, it is considered a [[phoneme]] in that language.

For example, in [[English language|English]], the sounds {{IPA|[p]}} and {{IPA|[b]}} can both occur word-initially, as in the words ''pat'' and ''bat'' ([[minimal pairs]]), which are distinct [[morphemes]]. Therefore, {{IPA|[p]}} and {{IPA|[b]}} are in contrastive distribution and so are phonemes of English.

Note that two sounds which are in contrastive distribution in one language can be in complementary distribution or free variation in another. These sounds occur in English, as in the word ''team'' {{IPA|[tʰiːm]}} and ''steam'' {{IPA|[stiːm]}}, but their occurrence is purely dependent upon phonological context. Therefore, in English, {{IPA|[tʰ]}} and {{IPA|[t]}} are not in contrastive distribution but in complementary distribution.

==Morphology==

In [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], two morphemes are in contrastive distribution if they occur in the same environment, but have different meanings. 

For example, in [[Korean language|Korean]], noun phrases are followed by one of the various markers that indicate syntactic role: /-ka/, /-i/, /-(l)ul/, etc. /-ka/ and /-i/ are in complementary distribution. They are both used to indicate [[nominative case]], and their occurrence is conditioned by the final sound of the preceding noun. If the noun ends in a consonant, /-i/ occurs; otherwise, /-ka/. /-(l)ul/, on the other hand, occurs in the same position as /-i/ or /-ka/ and is also conditioned by the immediately previous sound, but it indicates the [[accusative case]]. Therefore, /-(l)ul/ and the set {/-i/, /-ka/} are in contrastive distribution.

==Syntax==
In [[syntax]], the requirements are similar. In English, the expression of the [[indicative mood|indicative]] and the [[subjunctive]] moods is contrastive:

:(1) If I ''am'' a rich man, then I have a lot of money.
:(2) If I ''were'' a rich man, then I would have a lot of money.

The change from non-past first-person singular indicative ''am'' to the subjunctive ''were'' results in a change in the [[grammatical mood]] of the sentence.

'''Differential object marking''' ('''DOM''') is a linguistic phenomenon that is present in more than 300 languages; the term was coined by Georg Bossong.&lt;ref&gt;Bossong, Georg. 1985. ''Empirische Universalienforschung. Differentielle Objektmarkierung in der neuiranischen Sprachen''. Tübingen: Narr&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bossong, Georg. 1991. Differential object marking in Romance and beyond. In ''New Analyses in Romance Linguistics, Selected Papers from the XVIII Linguistic Symposium on Romance Languages 1988'', eds. D. Wanner and D. Kibbee, 143–170. Amsterdam: Benjamins&lt;/ref&gt; It is a form of [[Differential Argument Marking|differential argument marking]] that applies to the direct object. In languages where DOM is active, [[direct object]]s are divided in two different classes, depending on different meanings, and, in most DOM languages, only one of the classes receives a marker, the other being unmarked (but there are languages, like [[Finnish language|Finnish]], where both types of objects are marked with different endings).

==Spanish==

A well-known DOM language is [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. In Spanish, direct objects that are both human and specific require a special marker (the preposition ''a'' "to"):&lt;ref&gt;Fernández Ramírez, Salvador. 1986. ''Gramática española 4. El verbo y la oración''. Madrid: Arco/Libros.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pensado, Carmen ed. 1995. ''El complemento directo preposicional''. Madrid: Visor.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez-Mondoñedo, Miguel. 2007. The Syntax of Objects. Agree and Differential Object Marking, University of Connecticut: PhD Dissertation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Torrego, Esther. 1998. ''The dependencies of objects''. Linguistic Inquiry Monographs 34. Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Pedro besó a Lucía.'' = Peter kissed Lucy. (Literally, "Peter kissed '''to''' Lucy")

Inanimate direct objects do not usually allow this marker, even if they are specific:

*''Pedro besó el retrato.'' = Peter kissed the picture.

Yet, some animate objects that are specific can optionally bear the marker:

Some dialectal variation has been attested regarding the use of DOM in different varieties of Spanish. Balasch finds that, while the linguistic factors conditioning the use of DOM remain the same in both Mérida (Venezuela) Spanish and Madrid Spanish, DOM appears much more often in Madrid data. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lingref.com/cpp/wss/5/paper2511.pdf|title=Factors Determining Spanish Differential Object Marking within Its Domain of Variation|last=Balasch|first=Sonia|date=December 22, 2016|website=Factors Determining Spanish Differential Object Marking within Its Domain of Variation|publisher=University of New Mexico|access-date=December 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Tippets and Schwenter find that a factor known as ''relative animacy''  (the animacy of the direct object relative to that of the subject) is quite important in the implementation of DOM in varieties of Spanish such as Buenos Aires and Madrid Spanish. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ling.upenn.edu/NWAV/abstracts/nwav36_schwenter_tippets.pdf|title=Relative Animacy and Differential Object Marking in Spanish|last=Schwenter, Tippets|first=Scott, Ian|date=December 22, 2016|website=ling.upenn.edu|publisher=The Ohio State University|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Other languages==

Other examples of languages with differential object marking are [[Persian Language|Persian]], [[Turkish Language|Turkish]], [[Triqui language|Copala Triqui]], [[Khasi language|Khasi]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]], [[Kham language|Kham]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Amharic language|Amharic]]. A number of languages in Mozambique also show differential object marking.&lt;ref&gt;Ngunga, Armindo Saúl Atelela, Fábio Bonfim Duarte, and Quesler Fagundes Camargos. 2016. Differential object marking in Mozambican languages. ''Diversity in African languages'' pp. 333ff. Doris L. Payne, Sara Pacchiarotti, Mokaya Bosire, eds. Language Science Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
In Turkish, the direct object can either have accusative case or have no (visible) case at all; when it has accusative case, it is interpreted as specific (e.g. one specific person), and otherwise it is interpreted as nonspecific (e.g. some person).&lt;ref&gt;See Jaklin Kornfilt and Klaus von Heusinger (2005). The case of the direct object in Turkish. Semantics, syntax and morphology. In ''Turkic Languages'' 9, 3–44&lt;/ref&gt;

This is different from what happens in non-DOM languages, where all direct objects are uniformly marked in the same way; for instance, a language could mark all direct objects with an accusative ending (as in  [[Quechua language|Quechua]]); other language could leave all direct objects without overt marker (as in [[English language|English]]).

Although the phenomenon has been known for a very long time, it was considered a minor quirk in a few languages until [[Georg Bossong]], during the 1980s, presented evidence of DOM in more than 300 languages.&lt;ref&gt;Bossong, Georg. 1985.

'''Enuani''' is an [[Igbo language|Igbo]] dialect spoken in [[Nigeria]] by the [[Igbo people]] of [[Delta State]], Onitsha, Obosi and Ogbaru in Anambra State and Ndoni in Rivers State. The Enuani dialect is generally similar to the Igbo dialect of Anambra State. Enuani is tonal like the rest of [[Anioma people|Anioma]] dialects and is particularly related to the standard Igbo pronunciation in many regards. The Enuani dialect is the dominant Igbo dialect in Delta State.

== Areas of concentration ==
Enuani is one of the four major Igbo dialects spoken by the Anioma people (predominantly based in Aniocha and Oshimili Areas) in Delta north. The area of concentration of these people mostly comprises Ibusa, Asaba, Ogwashi-Uku, Illah, Issele-Uku, Akukwu -igbo Issele-Azagba, Okpanam, Ubulu-uno, Ubulu-Uku, Ubulu-okiti, Ashaba Ubulu-uno, Oko communities, Ejeme-Aniogo, Egbudu-Akah, Onicha-Ugbo, Idumuje-Uno, Idumuje-Ugboko, Onicha-Uku, Akukwu-igbo, Onicha-Olona, Ugbodu, Ukwunzu and the rest of them. This dialect as spoken in all of these areas are homogeneous in accent and mutually intelligible. It is also remarkable that this dialect has natural standardized orthography and has gained wider acceptance linguistically.

{{Tort law}}
'''Fair comment''' is a [[legal term]] for a [[common law]] defense in [[defamation]] cases ([[libel]] or [[slander]]). It is referred to as '''honest comment''' in some countries.

==United States==
In the [[United States]], the traditional privilege of "fair comment" is seen as a protection for robust, even outrageous published or spoken opinions about public officials and [[public figure]]s. Fair comment is defined as a "common law defense [that] guarantees the freedom of the press to express statements on matters of public interest, as long as the statements are not made with ill will, spite, or with the intent to harm the plaintiff".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hfac.uh.edu/comm/media_libel/libel/definition.html|title=Definition|publisher=University of Houston |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050830085000/http://www.hfac.uh.edu/comm/media_libel/libel/definition.html |archivedate=2005-08-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The defense of "fair comment" in the U.S. since 1964 has largely been replaced by the ruling in ''[[New York Times Co. v. Sullivan]]'', 376 U.S. 254 (1964). This case relied on the issue of [[actual malice]], which involves the defendant making a statement known at the time to be false, or which was made with a "reckless disregard" of whether the statement was true or false. If "actual malice" cannot be shown, the defense of "fair comment" is then superseded by the broader protection of the failure by the plaintiff to show "actual malice".

Each state writes its own laws of [[defamation]], and the laws and previously decided precedents in each state vary. In many states, (including Alabama where the case of ''Times v. Sullivan'' originated), the "fair comment" defense requires that the "privilege of 'fair comment' for expressions of opinion depends on the truth of the facts upon which the comment is based" according to U.S Supreme Court Justice Brennan who wrote the ruling in ''Times v. Sullivan''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=376&amp;invol=254|title=FindLaw's United States Supreme Court case and opinions.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is still technically possible to rely on the common law defense of "fair comment" without referring to the "actual malice" standard set by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] but that would only be a likely course of action when the defendant is absolutely sure that the facts upon which the opinion of the defendant was based were true, or that any falsehoods are not defamatory. If those facts are not absolutely true (and the actual malice standard is not taken into account) then the defendant could be sued by the plaintiff for damages, although the plaintiff would need to establish to the satisfaction of a jury that the statements were defamatory, and that the defendant published or made them.

"Actual malice" removes the requirement of being faultless in the reporting of the facts by the defendant. (Under the law prior to this decision any false statement could, if found to be defamatory, be grounds for damages.) Instead it raises the question of whether factual errors were made in good faith. "Actual malice" means then that the defendant intentionally made false statements of alleged facts, or recklessly failed to verify alleged facts when any reasonable person would have checked. If it is held that the defendant made intentionally false statements of fact, that will form a powerful argument that any statements of opinion based upon those facts were made with malice. If the plaintiff can prove malice on the part of the defendant the common law defense of "fair comment" is defeated.

The "actual malice" standard only applies when the statement is about a "public official", or a "public figure", or in some cases about a "matter of public interest". When it does apply it offers so much more protection to the defendant that it would be very rare for the defendant to assert "fair comment" instead. When the allegedly defamatory statement is about a purely private person, who is not a "public figure" in any way, the defendant may need to resort to the defense of "fair comment" instead.
Also, the "actual malice" standard is specifically part of United States law, derived from the U.S. Constitution. The defense of "fair comment" is a part of the older common law, and so might apply in non-U.S. jurisdictions which share the common-law tradition, such as the United Kingdom and the British Commonwealth.

==Canada==

In [[Canada]], for something to constitute fair comment, the comment must be on a matter of public interest (excluding gossip), based on known and provable facts, must be an opinion that any person is capable of holding based on those facts, and with no actual malice underlying it. The cardinal test of whether a statement is fair comment is whether it is recognizable as an opinion rather than a statement of fact, and whether it could be drawn from the known facts. There was formerly a rule stating that the opinion must be honestly held by the publisher (See [[Chernesky v. Armadale Publications Ltd.]] [1978] 6 W.W.R. 618 (S.C.C.)) but this rule was changed to one requiring that the opinion is capable of being held by anyone. (See [[Rafe Mair v. Kari Simpson]] [2008] 2 S.C.R. 420)

==United Kingdom==

Fletcher-Moulton LJ said in Hunt v Star Newspaper [1908] 2 KB 309, Tab 3, at 319-320, CA:

{{quote|“The law as to fair comment, so far as is material to the present case, stands as follows: In the first place, comment in order to be justifiable as fair comment must appear as comment and must not be so mixed up with the facts that the reader cannot distinguish between what is report and what is comment: see Andrews v. Chapman. [FN16] The justice of this rule is obvious. If the facts are stated separately and the comment appears as an inference drawn from those facts, any injustice that it might do will be to some extent negatived by the reader seeing the grounds upon which the unfavourable inference is based. But if fact and comment be intermingled so that it is not reasonably clear what portion purports to be inference, he will naturally suppose that the injurious statements are based on adequate grounds known to the writer though not necessarily set out by him. In the one case the insufficiency of the facts to support the inference will lead fair-minded men to reject the inference. In the other case it merely points to the existence of extrinsic facts which the writer considers to warrant the language he uses. In this relation *320 I must express my disagreement with the view apparently taken by the Court of Queen's Bench in Ireland in the case of Lefroy v. Burnside [FN17], where the imputation was that the plaintiffs dishonestly and corruptly supplied to a newspaper certain information. The Court treated the qualifications "dishonestly" or "corruptly" as clearly comment. In my opinion they are not comment, but constitute allegations of fact. It would have startled a pleader of the old school if he had been told that, in alleging that the defendant "fraudulently represented," he was indulging in comment. By the use of the word "fraudulently" he was probably making the most important allegation of fact in the whole case. Any matter, therefore, which does not indicate with a reasonable clearness that it purports to be comment, and not statement of fact, cannot be protected by the plea of fair comment. In the next place, in order to give room for the plea of fair comment the facts must be truly stated. If the facts upon which the comment purports to be made do not exist the foundation of the plea fails. This has been so frequently laid down authoritatively that I do not need to dwell further upon it: see, for instance, the direction given by Kennedy J. to the jury in Joynt v. Cycle Trade Publishing Co. [FN18], which has been frequently approved of by the Courts.”}}

In Branson v Bower [2002] QB 737, at p 748, para 29, Eady J said:

{{quote|“The comment must be upon ‘facts truly stated’
[29] A commentator must not deliberately distort the true situation. That would be relevant on "malice" even according to Lord Nicholls's criterion. It would not be honest. The matter of distortion (whether dishonest or otherwise) may also come into play, however, at the stage of the objective test, because one cannot decide whether a hypothetical commentator could hold an opinion in a vacuum. Even at this point, it is surely necessary to test the matter against some factual assumptions.” }}

Whether the comment is fair, Diplock J (as Lord Diplock then was) said in a summing up to jury in Silkin v. Beaverbrook Newspapers Ltd. and Another [1958] 1 WLR 743, Tab 5, at 749:

{{quote|“Would a fair-minded man holding strong views, obstinate views, prejudiced views, have been capable of making this comment? If the answer to that is yes, then your verdict in this case should be a verdict for the defendants. … If you were to take the view that it was so strong a comment that no fair-minded man could honestly have made it, then the defence fails and you would have to consider the question of damages.”}}

In relation to malice in the context of fair comment (which is different from the malice in the context of qualified privilege), Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead NPJ said in Albert Cheng v Tse Wai Chun (2000) 3 HKCFAR 339 at p 360I to 361D:

{{quote|“My conclusion on the authorities is that, for the most part, the relevant judicial statements are consistent with the views which I have expressed as a matter of principle. To summarise, in my view a comment which falls within the objective limits of the defence of fair comment can lose its immunity only by proof that the defendant did not genuinely hold the view he expressed. Honesty of belief is the touchstone. Actuation by spite, animosity, intent to injure, intent to arouse controversy or other motivation, whatever it may be, even if it is the dominant or sole motive, does not of itself defeat the defence. However, proof of such motivation may be evidence, sometimes compelling evidence, from which lack of genuine belief in the view expressed may be inferred. Proof of motivation may also be relevant on other issues in the action, such as damages.

It is said that this view of the law would have the undesirable consequence that malice would bear different meanings in the defences of fair comment and qualified privilege, and that this would inevitably cause difficulty for juries. I agree that if the term 'malice' were used, there might be a risk of confusion. The answer lies in shunning that word altogether. Juries can be instructed, regarding fair comment, that the defence is defeated by proof that the defendant did not genuinely believe the opinion he expressed. Regarding qualified privilege, juries can be directed that the defence is defeated by proof that the defendant used the occasion for some purpose other than that for which the occasion was privileged. This direction can be elaborated in a manner appropriate to the facts and issues in the case.”}}

The common law defence of fair comment in an action for defamation was abolished in the UK by the [[Defamation Act 2013]], replaced with the statutory defence of honest opinion.

A '''flood-meadow''' (or '''floodmeadow''') is an area of [[grassland]] or [[pasture]] beside a [[river]], subject to seasonal [[flooding]].  Flood-meadows are distinct from [[water-meadow]]s in that the latter are artificially created and maintained, with flooding controlled on a seasonal and even daily basis.

'''Gayle M. Haggard''' (born April 8, 1957) is an author, speaker and the wife of [[United States|American]] [[Evangelism|evangelical]] [[preacher]] [[Ted Haggard]].

==Life and career==

Haggard and her husband founded New Life Church in Colorado Springs, in 1985, with meetings in the basement of their home. The church grew to 14,000 members by 2006, with a large campus on the north side of Colorado Springs, Colorado.&lt;ref name="californiawomen1"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Women's Conference|author=Haggard, Gayle|date=15 September 2009|url=http://www.californiawomen.org/gayle-haggard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2006, Haggard's husband revealed to her that he had engaged in extramarital homosexual activity and drug use.  Once this became public the couple were removed from the New Life Church. When Haggard subsequently lost her position as the Director of Women's Ministries due to her husband’s removal from his position as pastor, she told the congregation via a letter written to them, “What I want you to know is that I love my husband, Ted Haggard, with all my heart. I am committed to him until death 'do us part.' We started this journey together and with the grace of God, we will finish together.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Letter to New Life Church|date=5 November 2006|website=Beliefnet.com|accessdate=21 September 2009 |url=http://www.beliefnet.com/News/2006/11/Ted-Haggard-I-Am-A-Deceiver-And-A-Liar.aspx?p=2#gayle}}&lt;/ref&gt; She went on to say that she wanted the women of New Life Church to “watch her” as she hoped to prove herself faithful.

Haggard's book ''Why I Stayed'', authored with Angela Hunt, was released in January 2010. The book is the story of her marriage to Ted Haggard and how they survived his infidelity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;"Taylor"[Taylor, Mark. To Tyndale's Partners. Letter. Tyndale House Publishers. Carol Stream: Tyndale House Publishers, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; The book also teaches the fundamental Christian message of forgiveness and restoration while chronicling the events that took place during the three years after the scandal broke.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

During her time of ministry at New Life Church, Haggard led a large women's ministry with up to 150 small groups meeting throughout the city.&lt;ref name="californiawomen1" /&gt; She taught wives of ministry leaders at leadership conferences held at the church.&lt;ref&gt;G. Haggard, ''A Life Embraced, A Hopeful Guide for the Pastor's Wife'', p. 143. [Haggard, Gayle. ''A Life Embraced, A Hopeful Guide for the Pastor's Wife''. Colorado Springs: Waterbrook Press, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; She spearheaded the citywide observance of the National Day of Prayer, making it the second largest event of its kind in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gorski, Eric|title=National Day of Prayer events move to ballpark|date=2 May 2001|website=Findarticles.com|accessdate=21 September 2009|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4191/is_20010502/ai_n9987811/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Haggard started a new ministry for women at New Life Church called "Women Belong". Her aim was to teach the message of acceptance and love in the body of Christ.&lt;ref name="californiawomen1" /&gt;
Her message of encouragement for women was featured as a chapter in two separate books, ''Leading Women to the Heart of God'' (2002) and ''Free to Soar'' (2005). Her first full-length book was written to other wives of pastors and was published in 2004, entitled, ''A Life Embraced, A Hopeful Guide for the Pastor’s Wife''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14813">This is a '''glossary of [[Schenkerian analysis]]''', a method of [[musical analysis]] of tonal music based on the theories of [[Heinrich Schenker]] (1868–1935). The method is discussed in the [[Schenkerian analysis|concerned article]] and no attempt will be made here to summarize it. Similarly, the entries below will whenever possible link to other articles where the concepts are described with more details (in several cases, the name of the entry links to a specialized article), and the definitions will be kept here to a minimum.

{{Compact ToC|center=yes}}

==A==
'''''Anstieg'''''
: See [[#I|Initial ascent]].
'''[[Arpeggio|Arpeggiation]] ({{lang-de|Brechung}})'''
: Elementary elaboration of a harmony. See also [[#B|Bass arpeggiation]]; [[#F|First-order arpeggiation]]; [[#U|Unfolding]].
'''''Ausfaltung'''''
: See [[#U|Unfolding]].
'''''Auskomponierung'''''
: See [[#P|Prolongation]].
'''''Außensatz'''''
: See [[#F|Fundamental structure]].

==B==
'''Background ({{lang-de|Hintergrund}})'''
: The [[#S|structural level]] of the [[#F|fundamental structure]]. See also [[#M|Middelground]] and [[#F|Foreground]].
'''[[Bass arpeggiation]] ({{lang-de|Bassbrechung}})'''
: Bass pattern I-V-I forming the harmonic content of the [[#B|background]] of tonal musical pieces; the concept belongs to the final version of Schenkerian theory, from 1930 onwards. See also [[Schenkerian analysis#The arpeggiation of the bass and the divider at the fifth|Schenkerian analysis: The arpeggiation of the bass]].
'''''Bassbrechung'''''
: See [[#B|Bass arpeggiation]].
'''''Brechung'''''
: See [[#A|Arpeggiation]].

==C==
'''Chord of nature'''
: See [[#K|Klang]].
'''Composing out'''
: See [[#P|Prolongation]].
'''Compound melody'''
: See [[#U|Unfolding]].
'''[[Coupling (Schenker)|Coupling]] ({{lang-de|Koppelung}})'''
: "The connection of two registers which lie an octave apart".&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Schenker (1979), § 152.&lt;/ref&gt; It often results from a [[#R|register transfer]] in which the transferred voice maintains a relation with its original register.&lt;ref&gt;Forte and Gilbert (1982). ''An Introduction to Schenkerian Analysis'', pp. 167–69. {{ISBN|9780393951929}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
'''Cover tone ({{lang-de|Deckton}})'''
: "A tone of the inner voice which appears above the foreground diminution".&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Schenker (1979), § 267.&lt;/ref&gt; It often results from an ascending [[#R|register transfer]] or coupling, but "the main thread of melodic activity remains with the displaced voice while the voice that does the displacing functions as a 'cover'".&lt;ref&gt;Forte and Gilbert (1982). ''An Introduction to Schenkerian Analysis'', p. 223. {{ISBN|9780393951929}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==D==
'''''Deckton'''''
: See [[#C|Cover tone]].
'''[[Diminution (Schenker)|Diminution]]'''
: "The process by which an interval formed by notes of longer value is expressed in notes of smaller value".&lt;ref&gt;Forte and Gilbert (1982), p.7.&lt;/ref&gt;
'''Divider ({{lang-de|Teiler}})'''
: Consonant subdivision of a consonant interval: the octave can be divided at the fifth (fifth-divider, {{lang-de|Quintteiler}}) and the fifth can be divided at the third (third-teiler, {{lang-de|Terzteiler}}). Schenker had also imagined a divider at the fourth (or lower fifth),&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Schenker (1923). "Bach’s Little Prelude No. 3 in C Minor, BWV 999", ''Der Tonwille'' 5, transl. J. Dubiel, Oxford University Press, 2004, note 7: "The upper or lower fifth of a chord, presenting itself by leap in the service of a passing motion or neighbor note, I call an upper- or lower-fifth [divider]" (the last word is missing in Dubiel's translation).&lt;/ref&gt; but he apparently abandoned the concept after 1926, probably because the upper fourth does not belong to the divided triad. See also [[Schenkerian analysis#The arpeggiation of the bass and the divider at the fifth|Schenkerian analysis: The arpeggiation of the bass and the divider at the fifth]].

==E==
'''Elaboration'''
: See [[#P|Prolongation]]

==F==
'''''Fernhören'''''
: See [[#S|Structural hearing]].
'''First-order arpeggiation'''
: Arpeggiated motion leading to the [[#P|primary tone]] of the [[#F|fundamental line]]. The term has been proposed by Forte &amp; Gilbert.&lt;ref&gt;Forte &amp; Gilbert (1982), p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[Schenkerian analysis#Initial ascent, initial arpeggiation|Schenkerian analysis: Initial ascent, initial arpeggiation]].
'''Foreground ({{lang-de|Vordergrund}})'''
: See [[#S|Structural level]].
'''''[[Free Composition]]'' ({{lang-de|freier Satz}})'''
: Title of the American translation of Schenker's ''Der freie Satz''&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Schenker (1979).&lt;/ref&gt;
'''[[Fundamental line]] ({{lang-de|Urlinie}})'''
: The melodic aspect of the [[#F|fundamental structure]], a stepwise descent from one of the triad notes to the tonic, with the [[#B|bass arpeggiation]] being the harmonic aspect. The notion of the descending fundamental line belongs to the final version of Schenkerian theory, from 1930 onwards; fundamental (or, better, "primal") lines in Schenker's earlier writings at times were ascending. The first note of the fundamental line is its [[#P|primary tone]]. See also [[Schenkerian analysis#The fundamental line|Schenkerian analysis: The fundamental line]].
'''[[Fundamental structure]] ({{lang-de|Ursatz}})'''
: "The [[#B|''background'']] in music is represented by a contrapuntal structure which I have designated the ''fundamental structure''".&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Schenker (1979), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; It consists in the [[#F|fundamental line]] counterpointed by the [[#B|bass arpeggiation]], together forming a counterpoint of the outer lines ({{lang-de|Au?ensatz}}).&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Schenker (1979), §28.&lt;/ref&gt;

==H==
'''Headnote'''
: See [[#P|Primary tone]].
'''''Hintergrund'''''
: See [[#B|Background]].
'''''Höherlegung'''''
: See [[#R|Register transfer]]

==I==
'''Initial arpeggiation'''
: See [[#F|First-order arpeggiation]].
'''[[Intial ascent (Schenker)|Initial ascent]] ({{lang-de|Anstieg}})'''
: Ascending motion leading to the [[#P|primary tone]] of the [[#F|fundamental line]].
==K==
'''[[Klang (music)|Klang]]'''
: The complex sound consisting of the first five notes of the harmonic series, suggesting a model for the major triad. For a discussion of the meaning of this concept, see [[Klang_%28music%29|Klang (music)]].
'''''Kopfton'''''
: See [[#P|Primary note]].
'''''Koppelung'''''
: See [[#C|Coupling]].

==L==
'''Level'''
: See [[#S|Structural level]].
'''[[Linear progression]] ({{lang-de|Auskomponierungszug}} or ''Zug'')'''
: A passing note elaboration involving stepwise melodic motion in one direction between two harmonic tones.&lt;ref&gt;Pankhurst, Tom (2008). ''Schenker Guide: A Brief Handbook and Website for Schenkerian Analysis'', p.243 and 27. {{ISBN|0-415-97398-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==M==
'''''Middleground'' ({{lang-de|Mittelgrund}})'''
: See [[#S|Structural level]]
'''''Mischung'''''
: See [[#M|Mixture]].
'''''Mittelgrund'''''
: See [[#M|Middelground]].
'''[[Mixture (Schenker)|Mixture]] ({{lang-de|Mischung}})'''
: Change of mode of the tonic (major to minor, minor to major).

==N==
'''[[Neighbour note]] ({{lang-de|Nebennote}})'''
: Nonchord tone that passes, usually stepwise, from a chord tone directly above or below it (which frequently causes the NN to create dissonance with the chord) and resolves to the same chord tone. See [[Nonchord_tone#Neighbor_tone_2|Neighbor tone]]. See also [[Schenkerian_analysis#Arpeggiation.2C_neighbour_note.2C_passing_note|Schenkerian analysis]].

==O==
'''[[Octave transfer]]'''
: See [[#R|Register transfer]].
'''''Obligate Lage'''''
: See [[#O|Obligatory register]].
'''[[Obligatory register]] ({{lang-de|obligate Lage}})'''
: "No matter how far the composing-out may depart from its basic register [...], it nevertheless retains an urge to return to that register".&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Schenker (1979), § 268.&lt;/ref&gt; This urge is often fulfilled, but not always.

==P==
'''Primal line, Primal structure'''
: The use of "Fundamental" as a translation of ''Ur-'' in [[#U|Urlinie]] or [[#U|Ursatz]] has been questioned. For more details, see [[Fundamental_structure#Terminology|Fundamental structure: Terminology]].
'''[[Primary tone]] ({{lang-de|Kopfton}})'''
: The first tone of the [[#F|Fundamental line]]. One of the three notes of the tonic triad, {{music|scale|8}}, {{music|scale|5}} or {{music|scale|3}}. See [[Schenkerian_analysis#The_fundamental_line|Schenkerian analysis:The fundamental line]].
'''[[Prolongation]] ({{lang-de|Auskomponierung}}), Composing-out, Elaboration'''
: The process in tonal music through which a pitch, interval, or consonant triad is able to govern spans of music when not physically sounding. Schenker himself appears to have used the German term ''Prolongation'' mainly to describe extensions of the laws of strict counterpoint to freer writing: see [[Prolongation#Prolongation_in_Heinrich_Schenker|Prolongation in Heinrich Schenker]]. ''Auskomponierung'' can be literally translated as "composing-out"; the German word is coined on the model of ''Ausarbeitung'', "elaboration".

==R==
'''[[Reaching over]] ({{lang-de|Übergreifen}})'''
: Elaboration by which a descending inner voice is placed above the (descending) upper voice by a [[#R|register transfer]]. Successive reaching-over lines may produce an ascending motion. See [http://nicolas.meeus.free.fr/Theorie/Uebergreifen.pdf List of Schenker's references to reaching over].
'''[[Register transfer]]'''
: Ascending ({{lang-de|Höherlegung}}) or descending ({{lang-de|Tieferlegung}}) motion of one or several voices into a different octave (i.e. into a different register).

==S==
'''[[Scale-step]] ({{lang-de|Stufe}})'''
: "The scale-step is a higher and more abstract unit [than that of triad]. At times it may even comprise several harmonies [...]; in other words: even if, under certain circumstances, a certain number of harmonies look like independent triads or seventh-chords, they may nonetheless add up, in their totality, to one single triad [...] and they would have to be subsumed under the concept of this triad [...] as a scale-step.&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Schenker (1954) ''Harmony'', Oswald Jonas ed., Elisabeth Mann Borgese transl., p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;
'''''Schicht'''''
: See [[#S|Structural level]].
'''''Stimmtausch'''''
: See [[#V|Voice exchange]].
'''[[Strata (music)|Strata]] ({{lang-de|Schichten}})'''
: Term used by John Rothgeb to translate [[#S|''Schicht'']] (see [[#S|Structural level]]) in Oswald Jonas' ''Introduction to the Theory of Heinrich Schenker''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oswald Jonas|Jonas, Oswald]] (1982). ''Introduction to the Theory of Heinrich Schenker'', p.138. (1934: ''Das Wesen des musikalischen Kunstwerks: Eine Einführung in Die Lehre Heinrich Schenkers''). Transl. John Rothgeb, p. 138. {{ISBN|0582282276}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
'''Structural hearing'''
: Title of the influential book by Felix Salzer.&lt;ref&gt;Felix Salzer (1952). ''Structural Hearing. Tonal Coherence in Music''. New York, Boni, 2 vols.&lt;/ref&gt; The expression may derive from that of "long-distance hearing" ({{lang-de|Fernhören}}), that Schenker used in ''Der Tonwille'' 1 and 2 (1921 and 1922)&lt;ref&gt;English translation, 2004, p. 22, 77, 82.&lt;/ref&gt; and that Furtwängler quoted in his paper "Heinrich Schenker. Ein zeitgemäßes Problem" of 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Furtwängler (1954). ''Ton und Wort: Aufsätze und Vorträge 1918 bis 1954'', Wiesbaden: Brockhaus, p. 198-204.&lt;/ref&gt;
'''[[Structural level]] ({{lang-de|Schicht}})'''
: Schenker uses the term "level" mainly in the expression "voice-leading level", denoting the successive levels through which the [[#F|fundamental structure]] develops to form the [[#F|foreground]]. The expression "Structural level" appears to have been coined by Allen Forte.&lt;ref&gt;Allen Forte (1959). "Schenker's Conception of Musical Structure", ''Journal of Music Theory'' 3, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;
'''''Stufe'''''
: See [[#S|Scale step]].

==T==
'''''Teiler'''''
: See [[#D|Divider]].
'''''Tieferlegung'''''
: See [[#R|Register transfer]].
'''[[Tonal space]]'''
: One of the most general principles of [[Schenkerian analysis]]: the intervals between the notes of the tonic triad form a tonal space that is filled with passing and neighbour notes, producing new triads and new tonal spaces, open for further elaborations until the surface of the work (the score) is reached.

==U==
'''''Übergreifen'''''
: See [[#R|Reaching over]].
'''[[Unfolding (music)|Unfolding]] ({{lang-de|Ausfaltung}})'''
: The transformation of a single chord into a horizontal succession (see [[#A|Arpeggiation]]), either when a tone of the upper voice and one of the inner voice are interconnected, or when a similar connection takes place in a succession of several chords.&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Schenker (1979), § 140.&lt;/ref&gt; See [[#C|Coupling]]. See also [[Schenkerian analysis#Unfolding|Schenkerian analysis: Unfolding]].
'''''Urlinie'''''
: See [[#F|Fundamental line]].
'''''Urlinietafel'''''
: "Graph of the ''Urlinie''", rhythmic reduction or the score with which Schenker often began his analyses. See also [[Schenkerian analysis#Schenkerian notation|Schenkerian analysis: Schenkerian notation]].
'''''Ursatz'''''
: See [[#F|Fundamental structure]].

==V==
'''[[Voice exchange]] ({{lang-de|Stimmtausch}})'''
: "A pattern that involves two and only two voices, a pattern in which the voices literally exchange their pitches."&lt;ref&gt;Forte &amp; Gilbert (1982), p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[Schenkerian analysis#Voice exchange|Schenkerian analysis: Voice exchange]].
'''[[Voice leading]]'''
: "The study of voice leading is the study of the principles that govern the progression of the component voices of a composition both separately and in combination. In the Schenkerian tradition, this study begins with strict species counterpoint."&lt;ref&gt;Forte &amp; Gilbert (1982), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;
'''''Vordergrund'''''
: See [[#F|Foreground]].

==Z==
'''''Zug'''''
: See [[#L|Linear progression]].

'''Herz Homberg''' (September 1749, [[Libeň]] – 24 August 1841, [[Prague]]) was an Austrian-Jewish educator and writer.

==Life==

He studied [[Talmud]] at Prague, [[Presburg]], and [[Gross-Glogau]], and began the study of general literature in his seventeenth year. The reading of [[Rousseau]]'s ''[[Emile, or On Education|Emile]]'' awakened in him the desire to devote himself to [[pedagogy]]. He prepared himself at Berlin, where he became tutor (1779) to [[Moses Mendelssohn]]'s eldest son, Joseph. During the three years he remained under Mendelssohn's roof he himself became a pupil of the philosopher, who continued to take an interest in him, as may be seen by his fifteen letters to Homberg (Mendelssohn's "Gesammelte Schriften," v., Leipsic, 1844).

Under [[Emperor Joseph II]] the status of the Jews in Austria underwent a complete change. German normal schools were to be introduced into the Jewish communities, but there were no men available to organize these schools and take charge of the public instruction. Homberg now decided to return to his native country. Being very highly recommended by Mendelssohn, he was appointed (1784) superintendent of all the German-Jewish schools of [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]].

In 1793 he was called by [[Emperor Francis II]] to Vienna to formulate laws regulating the moral and political status of the Jews in Austria. The work appeared in 1797, and won for Homberg the great gold medal. When the normal schools of Galicia were placed under the general direction of the district schools, Homberg retired to Vienna, employing his time partly as censor and partly in compiling such readers for Jews as had been ordered by the royal commission for studies. He was not successful in either of these directions.

Homberg was later appointed assistant professor of religious and moral philosophy at Prague, with the title of "Schulrath," retaining this position until his death.

[[File:Herzensschatzikomm.jpg|thumb|An example of what hypergraphia may look like]]
'''Hypergraphia''' is a behavioral condition characterized by the intense desire to write or draw. Forms of hypergraphia can vary in writing style and content. It is a symptom associated with [[temporal lobe]] changes in [[epilepsy]], which is the cause of the [[Geschwind syndrome]], a mental disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Devinsky J, Schachter S |title=Norman Geschwind's contribution to the understanding of behavioral changes in temporal lobe epilepsy: the February 1974 lecture |journal=Epilepsy Behav |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=417–24 |date=August 2009 |pmid=19640791 |doi=10.1016/j.yebeh.2009.06.006|type=Biography, History article}}&lt;/ref&gt; Structures that may have an effect on hypergraphia when damaged due to temporal lobe epilepsy are the [[hippocampus]] and [[Wernicke's area]]. Aside from temporal lobe epilepsy, chemical causes may be responsible for inducing hypergraphia.

==Characteristics==
In some cases hypergraphia can manifest with compulsive drawing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roberts|first1=JK|last2=Robertson|first2=MM|last3=Trimble|first3=MR|title=The lateralising significance of hypergraphia in temporal lobe epilepsy|journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry|date=February 1982|volume=45|issue=2|pages=131–8|doi=10.1136/jnnp.45.2.131|pmid=7069424|pmc=1083040}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawings by patients with hypergraphia exhibit repetition and a high level of detail, sometimes mixing both compulsive writing and drawing together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Neurology and General Medicine|last=Aminoff|first=Michael|publisher=|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=579}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writing style===

Waxman and Geschwind were the first to describe hypergraphia, in the 1970s. The patients they observed displayed extensively compulsive detailed writing, sometimes with literary creativity. The patients kept diaries, which some used to meticulously document minute details of their everyday activities, write poetry, or create lists. Case 1 of their study wrote lists of her relatives, her likes and dislikes, and the furniture in her apartment. Beside lists, the patient wrote poetry, often with a moral or philosophical undertone. She described an incident in which she wrote the lyrics of a song she learned when she was 17 several hundred times and another incident in which she felt the urge to write a word over and over again. Another patient wrote [[Aphorism|aphorisms]] and certain sentences in repetition.&lt;ref name=Waxman1974&gt;{{cite journal|last=Waxman|first=SG|author2=Geschwind, N |title=Hypergraphia in temporal lobe epilepsy. 1974.|journal=Epilepsy &amp; Behavior|date=March 2005 |volume=6|issue=2|pages=282–91|pmid=15710320|doi=10.1016/j.yebeh.2004.11.022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A patient from a separate study experienced "continuously rhyming in his head" for five years after a seizure and said that he "felt the need to write them down."&lt;ref name= Mendez1961&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mendez |first=MF |title=Hypergraphia for poetry in an epileptic patient|journal=The Journal of neuropsychiatry and clinical neurosciences|date=Fall 2005|volume=17|issue=4|pages=560–1|pmid=16388002|doi=10.1176/jnp.17.4.560}}&lt;/ref&gt; The patient did not talk in rhyme, nor did he read poetry. Language capacity and mental status were normal for this patient, except for recorded right temporal spikes on electroencephalograms. This patient had right hemisphere epilepsy. Functional MRI scans of other studies suggest that rhyming behavior is produced in the left hemisphere, but Mendez proposed that hyperactive electrical activity of the right hemisphere may induce a release of writing and rhyming abilities in the left hemisphere.&lt;ref name=Mendez1961 /&gt;

In addition to writing in different forms (poetry, books, repetition of one word), hypergraphia patients differ in the complexity of their writings. While some writers (e.g. [[Alice Flaherty]]) use their hypergraphia to help them write extensive papers and books, most patients do not write things of substance. Flaherty defines hypergraphia, as a result of temporal lobe epilepsy, as a condition that "increase[s] idea generation, sometimes at the expense of quality."&lt;ref name=Flaherty2005&gt;{{cite journal |author=Flaherty AW |title=Frontotemporal and dopaminergic control of idea generation and creative drive |journal=J. Comp. Neurol. |volume=493 |issue=1 |pages=147–53 |date=December 2005 |pmid=16254989 |pmc=2571074 |doi=10.1002/cne.20768|type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patients hospitalized with temporal lobe epilepsy and other disorders causing hypergraphia have written memos and lists (like their favorite songs) and recorded their dreams in extreme length and detail.&lt;ref name=Flaherty2005 /&gt; Some patients who also suffer from temporal lobe epilepsy record the times and locations of each seizure compiled as a list.&lt;ref name=Waxman1974 /&gt;

There are many accounts of patients writing in nonsensical patterns including writing in a center-seeking spiral starting around the edges of a piece of paper.&lt;ref name="Yamadori"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yamadori A, Mori E, Tabuchi M, Kudo Y, Mitani Y |title=Hypergraphia: a right hemisphere syndrome |journal=J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatry |volume=49 |issue=10 |pages=1160–4 |date=October 1986 |pmid=3783177 |pmc=1029050 |doi=10.1136/jnnp.49.10.1160}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In one case study, a patient even wrote backwards, so that the writing could only be interpreted with the aid of a mirror.&lt;ref name=Waxman1974 /&gt; Sometimes the writing can consist of scribbles and frantic, random thoughts that are quickly jotted down on paper very frequently. Grammar can be present, but the meaning of these thoughts is generally hard to grasp and the sentences are loose.&lt;ref name="Yamadori" /&gt; In some cases, patients write extremely detailed accounts of events that are occurring or descriptions of where they are.&lt;ref name="Yamadori" /&gt;

==Causes==
Some studies have suggested that hypergraphia is related to [[bipolar disorder]], [[hypomania]], and [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref name=Flaherty2011 /&gt; Although creative ability was observed in the patients of these studies, signs of creativity were observed, not hypergraphia specifically. Therefore, it is difficult to say with absolute certainty that hypergraphia is a symptom of these psychiatric illnesses because creativity in patients with bipolar disorder, hypomania, or schizophrenia may manifest into something aside from writing. However, other studies have shown significant accounts between hypergraphia and temporal lobe epilepsy&lt;ref name=Frequency_of_Hypergraphia&gt;{{ cite journal |last1 = Sachdev |first1 = H S |last2 = Waxman |first2 = S G |year = 1981 |title = Frequency of hypergraphia in temporal lobe epilepsy: an index of interictal behaviour syndrome. |journal = Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry |quote = Patients with temporal lobe epilepsy tended to reply more frequently to a standard questionnaire, and wrote extensively (mean: 1301 words) as compared to others (mean: 106 words). The incidence of temporal lobe epilepsy was 73% in patients exhibiting hypergraphia compared to 17% in patients without this trait. These findings suggest that hypergraphia may be a quantitative index of behaviour change in temporal lobe epilepsy. |pmid = 7241165 |pages = 358–60 |issue = 4 |volume = 44 |doi=10.1136/jnnp.44.4.358 |pmc=490963}}&lt;/ref&gt; and chemical causes. {{mcn|date=December 2013}}

=== Temporal lobe epilepsy ===
[[File:Gray728.svg|thumb|Image of the temporal lobe]]
Hypergraphia is a symptom of [[temporal lobe epilepsy]], a condition of reoccurring seizures caused by excessive neuronal activity, but it is not a common symptom among patients. Less than 10 percent of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy exhibit characteristics of hypergraphia.{{mcn|date=December 2013}} Temporal lobe epilepsy patients may exhibit irritability, discomfort, or an increasing feeling of dread if their writing activity is disrupted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=van Vugt P, Paquier P, Kees L, Cras P |title=Increased writing activity in neurological conditions: a review and clinical study |journal=J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatry |volume=61 |issue=5 |pages=510–4 |date=November 1996 |pmid=8937347 |pmc=1074050 |doi=10.1136/jnnp.61.5.510}}&lt;/ref&gt; To elicit such responses when interrupting their writing suggests that hypergraphia is a compulsive condition, resulting in an obsessive motivation to write.&lt;ref name=Flaherty2011&gt;{{cite journal|last=Flaherty|first=AW|title=Brain illness and creativity: mechanisms and treatment risks |journal=Canadian Journal of Psychiatry|date=March 2011|volume=56|issue=3 |pages=132–43|pmid=21443820|doi=10.1177/070674371105600303}}&lt;/ref&gt; A temporal lobe epilepsy may influence frontotemporal connections in such a way that the drive to write is increased in the [[frontal lobe]], beginning with the [[Prefrontal cortex|prefrontal]] and [[premotor cortex]] planning out what to write, and then leading to the [[motor cortex]] (located next to the [[central sulcus|central fissure]]) executing the physical movement of writing.&lt;ref name=Flaherty2011 /&gt;

Most temporal lobe epilepsy patients who suffer from hypergraphia can write words, but not all may have the capacity to write complete sentences that have meaning.&lt;ref name="Yamadori" /&gt;

=== Chemical ===
Certain drugs have been known to induce hypergraphia including [[donepezil]]. In one case study, a patient taking donepezil reported an elevation in mood and energy levels which led to hypergraphia and other excessive forms of speech (such as singing).&lt;ref name="Wicklund"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wicklund S, Wright M |title=Donepezil-induced mania |journal=J Neuropsychiatry Clin Neurosci |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=E27 |year=2012 |pmid=23037669 |doi=10.1176/appi.neuropsych.11070160}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six other cases of patients taking donepezil and experiencing mania have been previously reported. These patients also had cases of [[dementia]], cognitive impairment from a [[cerebral aneurysm]], bipolar I disorder, and/or depression. Researchers are unsure why donepezil can induce mania and hypergraphia. It could potentially result from an increase in [[acetylcholine]] levels, which would have an effect on the other neurotransmitters in the brain.&lt;ref name="Wicklund" /&gt;

Another potential cause of hypergraphia is from one of the body's neurotransmitters, [[dopamine]] (DA). Dopamine has been known to decrease latent inhibition, which causes a decrease in the ability to habituate to different stimuli. Low latent inhibition leads to an excessive level of stimulation and could contribute to the onset of hypergraphia and general creativity. This research implies that there is a direct correlation between the levels of DA between neuronal synapses and the level of creativity exhibited by the patient. DA agonists increase the levels of DA between synapses which results in higher levels of creativity, and the opposite is true for DA antagonists.&lt;ref name=Flaherty2005 /&gt;

==Pathophysiology==
[[File:Cerebrum lobes.svg|thumbnail|left|Image of the brain lobes, including the temporal lobe and somatomotor (primary motor) cortex.]]
Several regions of the brain are involved in the act of writing. Primary areas are the superior [[parietal cortex]] and the [[frontal lobe]], the region of the brain that plans out movement.&lt;ref name=Planton&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Planton S, Jucla M, Roux FE, Démonet JF |title=The "handwriting brain": A meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies of motor versus orthographic processes |journal=Cortex |volume=49 |issue=10 |pages=2772–87 |year=2013 |pmid=23831432 |doi=10.1016/j.cortex.2013.05.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An area of the frontal lobe that is especially active is Exner's area, located in the [[premotor cortex]].&lt;ref name=Planton /&gt; The physical motion of the hand is controlled by the [[primary motor cortex]], also located in the frontal lobe, and the right cerebellum.&lt;ref name=Planton /&gt; Writing creatively and generating ideas, on the other hand, is controlled by the limbic system, specifically involving the activity of the hippocampus, which is important in the retrieval of long-term memories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shah C, Erhard K, Ortheil HJ, Kaza E, Kessler C, Lotze M |title=Neural correlates of creative writing: an fMRI study |journal=Hum Brain Mapp |volume=34 |issue=5 |pages=1088–101 |date=May 2013 |pmid=22162145 |doi=10.1002/hbm.21493}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Words and ideas are cognized and understood by the [[temporal lobes]], and these temporal lobes are connected to the limbic system.&lt;ref name=Planton /&gt; 
[[File:Gray518.png|thumb|Image of the hippocampal gyrus]]

Although hypergraphia cannot be isolated to one specific part of the brain, some areas are known to have more of an effect than others.  The [[hippocampus]] has been found to play a role in the occurrence of temporal lobe epilepsy and schizophrenia.  In one study, rats induced with temporal lobe epilepsy showed an increase in dopamine neural activity in the hippocampus.  Because hypergraphia has been linked to temporal lobe epilepsy and schizophrenia, the hippocampus could have an effect on hypergraphia as well.&lt;ref name="Cifelli"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Cifelli P, Grace AA |title=Pilocarpine-induced temporal lobe epilepsy in the rat is associated with increased dopamine neuron activity|journal=The International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology|date=12 July 2011|volume=15|issue=07|pages=957–964|doi=10.1017/S1461145711001106}}&lt;!--|accessdate=10 November 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  In another study, patients with bilateral hippocampal atrophy (BHA) showed signs of having Geschwind syndrome, including hypergraphia.&lt;ref name="Elst"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=van Elst LT, Krishnamoorthy ES, Bäumer D, etal |title=Psychopathological profile in patients with severe bilateral hippocampal atrophy and temporal lobe epilepsy: evidence in support of the Geschwind syndrome?|journal=Epilepsy &amp; Behavior|date=June 2003|volume=4|issue=3|pages=291–7|pmid=12791331|doi=10.1016/s1525-5050(03)00084-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While epilepsy-induced hypergraphia is usually lateralized to the left cerebral hemisphere in the language areas, hypergraphia associated with lesions and other brain damage usually occurs in the right cerebral hemisphere.&lt;ref name="Ishikawa"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ishikawa|first=T|author2=Saito, M |author3=Fujimoto, S |author4= Imahashi, H |title=Ictal increased writing preceded by dysphasic seizures.|journal=Brain &amp; development|date=September 2000|volume=22|issue=6|pages=398–402|pmid=11042425|doi=10.1016/s0387-7604(00)00163-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lesions to the right side of the brain usually cause hypergraphia because they can disinhibit language function on the left side of the brain.&lt;ref name=Flaherty2005 /&gt; Hypergraphia has also been known to be caused by right hemisphere strokes and tumors.&lt;ref name="Yamadori" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Imamura"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Imamura|first=T|author2=Yamadori, A |author3=Tsuburaya, K |title=Hypergraphia associated with a brain tumour of the right cerebral hemisphere.|journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry|date=January 1992|volume=55|issue=1|pages=25–7|pmid=1548492|doi=10.1136/jnnp.55.1.25|pmc=488927}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lesions to [[Wernicke's area]] (in the left temporal lobe) can increase speech output, which can sometimes manifest itself in writing.&lt;ref name=Flaherty2005 /&gt;

==Society and culture==
&lt;!-- Please review [[WP:MEDMOS]] before adding speculation here--&gt;
Hypergraphia was one of the central issues in the 1999 trial of Alvin Ridley for the imprisonment and murder of his wife [[Virginia Ridley]].&lt;ref name="Brownlee"&gt;Brownlee 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The mysterious woman, who had died in bed of apparent suffocation, had remained secluded in her home for 27 years in the small town of [[Ringgold, Georgia]], USA. Her ten thousand page journal, which provided abundant evidence that she suffered from [[epilepsy]] and had remained housebound of her own will, was instrumental in the acquittal of her husband.&lt;ref name="Brownlee" /&gt;

"I am a compulsive writer", [[Isaac Asimov]] said in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/nightfallotherst00asim#page/244/mode/2up|title=Nightfall, and other stories|last=Asimov|first=Isaac|date=1969|publisher=Doubleday|pages=244}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vincent van Gogh]] and [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]] are reported to have been affected by hypergraphia {{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}.

[[Lewis Carroll]], the author of ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]'', is said to have had hypergraphia.&lt;ref name="Flaherty"&gt;Flaherty, ''The Midnight Disease'' p 26&lt;/ref&gt; In his lifetime he wrote over 98,000 letters varying in format. Some were written backwards, in [[rebus]], and in patterns, as with "The Mouse's Tale" in ''Alice''.

{{Psychoanalysis |Concepts}}

The '''id, ego, and super-ego''' are three distinct, yet interacting agents in the [[psychic apparatus]] defined in [[Sigmund Freud|Sigmund Freud's]] [[Ego psychology|structural model]] of the [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]].

The three parts are the theoretical constructs in terms of whose activity and interaction our [[mental life]] is described. According to this Freudian model of the psyche, the id is the set of uncoordinated instinctual trends; the super-ego plays the critical and moralizing role; and the ego is the organized, realistic part that mediates between the desires of the id and the super-ego.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, Sigmund. ''The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud.'' Vol. XIX. Translated from the German under the General Editorship of [[James Strachey]]. In collaboration with [[Anna Freud]]. Assisted by [[Alix Strachey]] and [[Alan Tyson]], Vintage, 1999. [Reprint.] {{ISBN|0-09-929622-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Freud explained:&lt;blockquote&gt;The functional importance of the ego is manifested in the fact that normally control over the approaches to motility devolves upon it. Thus in its relation to the id it is like a man on horseback, who has to hold in check the superior strength of the horse; with this difference, that the rider tries to do so with his own strength while the ego uses borrowed forces. The analogy may be carried a little further. Often a rider, if he is not to be parted from his horse, is obliged to guide it where it wants to go; so in the same way the ego is in the habit of transforming the id's will into action as if it were its own. (p. 19).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/965512|title=The standard edition of the complete psychological works of Sigmund Freud.

The super-ego is observable in how someone can view themselves as guilty, [[Evil|bad]], [[shameful]], weak, and feel compelled to do certain things. Freud in ''[[The Ego and the Id]]'' discusses "the general character of harshness and cruelty exhibited by the [ego] ideal – its dictatorial 'Thou shalt.{{'"}}

Freud (1933) hypothesizes different levels of ego ideal or superego development with increasingly greater ideals:
{{quote|...nor must it be forgotten that a child has a different estimate of [their] parents at different periods of [their] life. At the time at which the [[Oedipus complex]] gives place to the super-ego they are something quite magnificent; but later they lose much of this. Identifications then come about with these later parents as well, and indeed they regularly make important contributions to the formation of character; but in that case they only affect the ego, they no longer influence the super-ego, which has been determined by the earliest parental images.|''New Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis'', p. 64}}

The earlier in development, the greater the estimate of parental power. When one defuses into rivalry with the parental imago, then one feels the 'dictatorial thou shalt' to manifest the power the imago represents. Four general levels are found in Freud's work: the auto-erotic, the narcissistic, the anal, and the phallic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pederson|first1=Trevor|title=The Economics of Libido: Psychic Bisexuality, the Superego, and the Centrality of the Oedipus Complex|date=2015|publisher=Karnac}}&lt;/ref&gt; These different levels of development and the relations to parental imagos correspond to specific id forms of aggression and affection. For example, aggressive desires to decapitate, to dismember, to cannibalize, to swallow whole, to suck dry, to make disappear, to blow away, etc. animate myths, are enjoyed in fantasy and horror movies, and are observable in the fantasies and repressions of patients across cultures.  
      
The concepts themselves arose at a late stage in the development of Freud's thought as the "structural model" (which succeeded his "economic model" and "topographical model") and was first discussed in his 1920 essay ''[[Beyond the Pleasure Principle]]'' and was formalized and elaborated upon three years later in his ''The Ego and the Id''. Freud's proposal was influenced by the ambiguity of the term "[[Unconscious mind|unconscious]]" and its many conflicting uses.

{{quote|It is the dark, inaccessible part of our personality, what little we know of it we have learned from our study of the [[dreamwork]] and of course the construction of neurotic symptoms, and most of that is of a negative character and can be described only as a contrast to the ego. We approach the id with analogies: we call it a chaos, a cauldron full of seething excitations. ...It is filled with energy reaching it from the instincts, but it has no organization, produces no collective will, but only a striving to bring about the satisfaction of the instinctual needs subject to the observance of the pleasure principle.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud (1933), ''New Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis''. pp. 105–6.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the id:

{{quote|...contrary impulses exist side by side, without cancelling each other out. ...There is nothing in the id that could be compared with negation...nothing in the id which corresponds to the idea of time.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud (1933). p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Developmentally, the id precedes the ego; i.e., the psychic apparatus begins, at birth, as an undifferentiated id, part of which then develops into a structured ego. While "id" is in search of pleasure, "ego" emphasizes the principle of reality.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite article |last1=Lapsley |first1=Daniel K. |last2=Paul C.  |first2=Stey |title=Id, Ego, and Superego |url=https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:https://www3.nd.edu/~dlapsle1/Lab/Articles_%26_Chapters_files/Entry%2520for%2520Encyclopedia%2520of%2520Human%2520BehaviorFInal%2520Submitted%2520Formatted4.pdf |doi=10.1016/B978-0-12-375000-6.00199-3}} Chapter of {{cite book |editor-last=Ramachandran |editor-first=Vilayanur S. |editor-link=V.

{{quote|...contains everything that is inherited, that is present at birth, is laid down in the constitution—above all, therefore, the instincts, which originate from the somatic organization, and which find a first psychical expression here (in the id) in forms unknown to us.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''An Outline of Psycho-analysis'' (1940)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The mind of a newborn child is regarded as completely "id-ridden", in the sense that it is a mass of instinctive drives and impulses, and needs immediate satisfaction. The "id" moves on to what organism needs. Example is reduction of tension which is experienced.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

The id "knows no judgements of value: no good and evil, no morality. ...Instinctual [[cathexis|cathexes]] seeking discharge—that, in our view, is all there is in the id."&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud (1933). p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; It is regarded as "the great reservoir of [[libido]]",&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, "The Ego and the Id", ''On Metapsychology'' (Penguin Freud Library 11) p. 369.&lt;/ref&gt; the instinctive drive to create—the life instincts that are crucial to pleasurable survival. Alongside the life instincts came the death instincts—the [[death drive]] which Freud articulated relatively late in his career in "the hypothesis of a ''death instinct'', the task of which is to lead organic life back into the inanimate state."&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' p. 380.&lt;/ref&gt; For Freud, "the death instinct would thus seem to express itself—though probably only in part—as an ''instinct of destruction'' directed against the external world and other organisms"&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' p. 381.&lt;/ref&gt; through aggression. Freud considered that "the id, the whole person...originally includes all the instinctual impulses...the destructive instinct as well",&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud (1933). p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; as [[Eros (concept)|eros]] or the life instincts.

=== Ego ===
The ego (Latin for "I",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Ego |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/ego-philosophy-and-psychology |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |date=February 22, 2016 |accessdate=February 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-de|Ich}})&lt;ref name="Ich"&gt;Laplanche, Jean; Pontalis, Jean-Bertrand (1988).

An example would be to resist the urge to grab other people's belongings, but instead to purchase those items.&lt;ref&gt;Schacter, Gilbert, Wegner, Daniel (2011). ''Psychology'' (1. publ., 3. print. ed.). Cambridge: WorthPublishers. {{ISBN|978-1-429-24107-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ego is the organized part of the personality structure that includes defensive, perceptual, intellectual-cognitive, and executive functions. Conscious awareness resides in the ego, although not all of the operations of the ego are conscious. Originally, Freud used the word ego to mean a sense of self, but later revised it to mean a set of psychic functions such as judgment, tolerance, reality testing, control, planning, defense, synthesis of information, intellectual functioning, and memory.&lt;ref name="Snowden"&gt;{{cite book|title=Teach Yourself Freud|last=Snowden|first=Ruth|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]]|year=2006|isbn=978-0-07-147274-6|pages=105–107}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ego separates out what is real. It helps us to organize our thoughts and make sense of them and the world around us.&lt;ref name="Snowden"/&gt; "The ego is that part of the id which has been modified by the direct influence of the external world. ...The ego represents what may be called reason and common sense, in contrast to the id, which contains the passions...in its relation to the id it is like a person on horseback, who has to hold in check the superior strength of the horse; with this difference, that the rider tries to do so with their own strength, while the ego uses borrowed forces."&lt;ref&gt;Freud,''The Ego and the Id'', ''On Metapsychology'' pp. 363–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Still worse, "it serves three severe masters...the external world, the super-ego and the id."&lt;ref name="Freud, p. 110"/&gt; Its task is to find a balance between primitive drives and reality while satisfying the id and super-ego. Its main concern is with the individual's safety and allows some of the id's desires to be expressed, but only when consequences of these actions are marginal. "Thus the ego, driven by the id, confined by the super-ego, repulsed by reality, struggles...[in] bringing about harmony among the forces and influences working in and upon it," and readily "breaks out in anxiety—realistic anxiety regarding the external world, moral anxiety regarding the super-ego, and neurotic anxiety regarding the strength of the passions in the id."&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud (1933). pp. 110–11.&lt;/ref&gt; It has to do its best to suit all three, thus is constantly feeling hemmed by the danger of causing discontent on two other sides. It is said, however, that the ego seems to be more loyal to the id, preferring to gloss over the finer details of reality to minimize conflicts while pretending to have a regard for reality. But the super-ego is constantly watching every one of the ego's moves and punishes it with feelings of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]], and inferiority.

To overcome this the ego employs [[defense mechanism]]s. The defense mechanisms are not done so directly or consciously. They lessen the tension by covering up our impulses that are threatening.&lt;ref name="Meyers"&gt;{{cite book |last=Meyers |first=David G. |authorlink=David Myers (academic) |title=Psychology Eighth Edition in Modules |publisher=Worth Publishers |year=2007 |chapter=Module 44 The Psychoanalytic Perspective |isbn=978-0-7167-7927-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ego defense mechanisms are often used by the ego when id behavior conflicts with reality and either society's morals, norms, and taboos or the individual's expectations as a result of the internalization of these morals, norms, and their taboos.

[[File:Structural-Model1.png|thumb|right|200px|"The ego is not sharply separated from the id; its lower portion merges into it.... But the repressed merges into the id as well, and is merely a part of it.

([[Sigmund Freud]], 1923)]]In a diagram of the [[Defense mechanism#Structural model: The id, ego, and superego|Structural and Topographical Models of Mind]], the ego is depicted to be half in the consciousness, while a quarter is in the [[preconscious]] and the other quarter lies in the [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]].

=== Super-ego ===
{{Redirect|Superego|the podcast|Superego (podcast)}}
The super-ego&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Superego |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/superego |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |date=February 22, 2016 |accessdate=February 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{Lang-de|Über-Ich}})&lt;ref name="Über-Ich"&gt;Laplanche, Jean; Pontalis, Jean-Bertrand (1988). "[https://books.google.com/?id=PsvZpv0ZRw0C&amp;pg=435&amp;dq=%22Super-Ego+%3D+D.:+Ober-Ich%22 Super-Ego (pp. 435–8)"].&lt;/ref&gt; reflects the internalization of cultural rules, mainly taught by parents applying their guidance and influence.&lt;ref name="Schacter"/&gt; Freud developed his concept of the super-ego from an earlier combination of the ego ideal and the "special psychical agency which performs the task of seeing that narcissistic satisfaction from the ego ideal is ensured...what we call our 'conscience'."&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' pp. 89-90.&lt;/ref&gt; For him "the installation of the super-ego can be described as a successful instance of identification with the parental agency," while as development proceeds "the super-ego also takes on the influence of those who have stepped into the place of parents&amp;nbsp;— educators, teachers, people chosen as ideal models".
{{quote|Thus a child's super-ego is in fact constructed on the model not of its parents but of its parents' super-ego; the contents which fill it are the same and it becomes the vehicle of tradition and of all the time-resisting judgments of value which have propagated themselves in this manner from generation to generation.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud (1933). pp. 95-6.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The super-ego aims for perfection.&lt;ref name="Meyers"/&gt; It forms the organized part of the personality structure, mainly but not entirely unconscious, that includes the individual's [[ego ideals]], spiritual goals, and the psychic agency (commonly called "conscience") that criticizes and prohibits their drives, fantasies, feelings, and actions. "The Super-ego can be thought of as a type of conscience that punishes misbehavior with feelings of guilt. For example, for having extra-marital affairs."&lt;ref&gt;Arthur S. Reber, ''The Penguin Dictionary of Psychology'' (1985)&lt;/ref&gt; Taken in this sense, the super-ego is the precedent for the conceptualization of the [[inner critic]] as it appears in contemporary therapies such as [[Internal Family Systems Model|IFS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schwartz|first1=Richard|title=Internal Family Systems Therapy|date=1997|publisher=The Guilford Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The super-ego works in contradiction to the id. The super-ego strives to act in a socially appropriate manner, whereas the id just wants instant self-gratification. The super-ego controls our sense of right and wrong and guilt. It helps us fit into society by getting us to act in socially acceptable ways.&lt;ref name="Snowden"/&gt;

The super-ego's demands often oppose the id's, so the ego sometimes has a hard time in reconciling the two.&lt;ref name="Meyers"/&gt;

Freud's theory implies that the super-ego is a symbolic internalisation of the [[father figure]] and cultural regulations. The super-ego tends to stand in opposition to the desires of the id because of their conflicting objectives, and its aggressiveness towards the ego. The super-ego acts as the [[conscience]], maintaining our sense of morality and proscription from taboos. The super-ego and the ego are the product of two key factors: the state of helplessness of the child and the [[Oedipus complex]].&lt;ref name="Sédat"&gt;{{cite journal

Freud described the super-ego and its relationship to the father figure and Oedipus complex thus:
{{quote|The super-ego retains the character of the father, while the more powerful the Oedipus complex was and the more rapidly it succumbed to repression (under the influence of authority, religious teaching, schooling and reading), the stricter will be the domination of the super-ego over the ego later on—in the form of conscience or perhaps of an unconscious sense of guilt.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''[[The Ego and the Id]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The concept of super-ego and the Oedipus complex is subject to criticism for its perceived sexism. Women, who are considered to be already castrated, do not identify with the father, and therefore, for Freud, "their super-ego is never so inexorable, so impersonal, so independent of its emotional origins as we require it to be in men...they are often more influenced in their judgements by feelings of affection or hostility."&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Sexuality'' (Penguin Freud Library 7) p. 342.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Freud went on to modify his position to the effect "that the majority of men are also far behind the masculine ideal and that all human individuals, as a result of their human identity, combine in themselves both masculine and feminine characteristics, otherwise known as human characteristics."&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''On Sexuality'' p. 342.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages of the structural model ==

[[File:Structural-Iceberg.svg|thumb|280px|The [[iceberg]] metaphor is often used to explain the psyche's parts in relation to one another.]]

Freud's earlier, topographical model of the mind had divided the mind into the three elements of conscious, [[preconscious]], and unconscious. The conscious contains events that we are aware of, preconscious is events that are in the process of becoming conscious, and unconscious include events that we are not aware of.&lt;ref name=Freud&gt;{{cite book |last=Carlson|first=Neil R.|title=Psychology, the science of behaviour: The psychodynamic approach|year=2010|publisher=Pearson Canada |location=Toronto |isbn=978-0-205-64524-4 |page=453}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its heart was "the dialectic of unconscious traumatic memory versus consciousness...which soon became a conflict between System Ucs versus System Cs."&lt;ref&gt;James S. Grotstein, in Neville Symington, ''Narcissism: A New Theory'' (London 2003) p. x&lt;/ref&gt; With what Freud called the "disagreeable discovery that on the one hand (super-)ego and conscious and on the other hand repressed and unconscious are far from coinciding,"&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud (1933). p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Freud took the step in the structural model to "no longer use the term 'unconscious' in the systematic sense," and to rename "the mental region that is foreign to the ego...[and] in future call it the 'id'."&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud (1933). p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; The partition of the psyche defined in the structural model is thus one that cuts across the topographical model's partition of "conscious vs. unconscious".

"The new terminology which he introduced has a highly clarifying effect and so made further clinical advances possible."&lt;ref&gt;Angela Richards "Editor's Introduction" Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' pp. 344–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Its value lies in the increased degree of precision and diversification made possible: Although the id is unconscious by definition, the ego and the super-ego are both partly conscious and partly unconscious. What is more, with this new model Freud achieved a more systematic classification of mental disorder than had been available previously:

{{quote|[[Transference neurosis|Transference neuroses]] correspond to a conflict between the ego and the id; [[narcissistic neurosis|narcissistic neuroses]], to a conflict between the ego and the superego; and [[psychosis|psychoses]], to one between the ego and the external world.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''[[Neurosis and Psychosis]]''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It is important to realise however, that "the three newly presented entities, the id, the ego and the superego, all had lengthy past histories (two of them under other names)"&lt;ref&gt;Angela Richards, "Editor's Introduction" in ''On Metapsychology'' p. 345.&lt;/ref&gt;—the id as the systematic unconscious, the super-ego as conscience/ego ideal. Equally, Freud never abandoned the topographical division of conscious, preconscious, and unconscious, though as he noted ruefully "the three qualities of consciousness and the three provinces of the mental apparatus do not fall together into three peaceful couples...we had no right to expect any such smooth arrangement."&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud (1933). pp. 104–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The iceberg metaphor is a commonly used visual metaphor when attempting to relate the ego, id and superego with the conscious and unconscious mind. In the iceberg metaphor the entire id and part of both the superego and the ego would be submerged in the underwater portion representing the unconscious mind. The remaining portions of the ego and superego would be displayed above water in the conscious mind area.&lt;ref name="Carlson"/&gt;

== Translation ==

The terms "id", "ego", and "super-ego" are not Freud's own. They are latinisations by his translator [[James Strachey]]. Freud himself wrote of "''[[wikt:das#German|das]] [[wikt:Es#German|Es]]''",&lt;ref name="Es"/&gt; "''das [[wikt:Ich|Ich]]''",&lt;ref name="Ich"/&gt; and "''das [[wikt:über-|Über-]]Ich''"&lt;ref name="Über-Ich"/&gt;—respectively, "the It", "the I", and "the Over-I" (or "I above"); thus to the German reader, Freud's original terms are more or less self-explanatory. Freud borrowed the term "''das Es''" from [[Georg Groddeck]], a German physician to whose unconventional ideas Freud was much attracted (Groddeck's translators render the term in English as "the It").&lt;ref name="Groddeck"&gt;{{de icon}} {{cite book |last=Groddeck |first=Georg |authorlink=Georg Groddeck |title=Das Buch vom Es. Psychoanalytische Briefe an eine Freundin |trans-title=[https://archive.org/details/b29815101 The Book of the It] |url=https://books.google.com/?id=lpYXAAAAYAAJ |publisher=Internationaler Psychoanalytischer Verlag |location=[[Vienna]] |year=1923}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''[[wikt:ego|ego]]'' is taken directly from [[Latin]], where it is the [[nominative]] of the first person singular [[personal pronoun]] and is translated as "I myself" to express emphasis.
Figures like [[Bruno Bettelheim]] have criticized the way "the English translations impeded students' efforts to gain a true understanding of Freud."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Neville Symington, ''Narcissism: A New Theory'' (London 1996) p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; by substituting the formalised language of the [[Basil Bernstein|elaborated code]] for the quotidian immediacy of Freud's own language.

'''Kim Hyesoon''' (born 1955) ({{ko-hhrm|hangul=김혜순}}) is a [[South Korea]]n poet.

==Life==
In 1955 Kim Hyesoon was born in Uljin, Gyeongsangbuk-do. She received her Ph.D. in Korean Literature from [[Konkuk University]] and began as a poet in 1979 with the publication of ''Poet Smoking a Cigarette'' (''Dambaereul piuneun siin'') and four other poems in Literature and Intellect.&lt;ref&gt;LTI Korea Author Database: {{cite web |url=http://eng.klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do?method=author_detail&amp;AI_NUM=167&amp;user_system=keuser |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201141837/http://eng.klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do?method=author_detail&amp;AI_NUM=167&amp;user_system=keuser |archivedate=2014-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kim is an important contemporary poet in [[South Korea]], and she lives in [[Seoul]] and teaches creative writing at the [[Seoul Institute of the Arts]]. Kim was in the forefront of women published in a literary journal, ''Munhak kwa jisŏng'' (Literature and Intellect).&lt;ref&gt;South Korea - Poetry International Web: http://www.poetryinternational.org/piw_cms/cms/cms_module/index.php?obj_id=17171{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Kim started to receive critical acclaim in the late 1990s and it is her own belief that her work was partly recognized because at that time there was a generally strong wave of women’s poets and poetry.&lt;ref&gt;South Korea - Poetry International Web: http://www.poetryinternational.org/piw_cms/cms/cms_module/index.php?obj_id=17171{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kim is the recipient of multiple literary prizes including the Kim Su-yŏng Literature Award (1996) for her poem, ''A Poor Love Machine'', [[So-Wol Poetry Prize|Sowol Poetry Literature Award]] (2000),&lt;ref&gt;LTI Korea Author Database: {{cite web |url=http://www.klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710092802/http://www.klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do |archivedate=2011-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Midang Literature Award (2006), which are named after three renowned contemporary Korean poets. Kim was the first woman poet to receive the Kim Su-yŏng Literature Award, Midang Award, contemporary poetry award and [[Daesan Literary Awards|Daesan Literary Award]].

Kim’s poetry collections include: ''From another star'' (1981), ''Father's scarecrow'' (1984), ''The Hell of a certain star'' (1987), ''Our negative picture'' (1991), ''My Upanishad, Seoul'' (1994), ''A Poor Love Machine'' (1997), ''To the Calendar Factory Manager'' (2000), ''A Glass of Red Mirror'' (2004), ''Your First'' (2008), and ''Sorrowtoothpaste Mirrorcream'' (2011)Blossom, Pig(2016)

Kim has participated in readings at poetry festivals all over the world: Smith College Poetry Center (2003), Taipei Poetry Festival (2008), 41st Poetry International Festival Rotterdam (2010), Poesie Festival Berlin (2011), Poetry Parnassus London (2012), Stockholm international Poetry Festival(2014), Hong Kong International Poetry nights(2015)Festival for World Literature Cologne (2018) etc.

Kim's skill as a writer resides in her facility at combining poetic images with experimental language while simultaneously grounding her work in ‘feminine writing’ drawn from female experiences.&lt;ref&gt;South Korea - Poetry International Web: http://www.poetryinternational.org/piw_cms/cms/cms_module/index.php?obj_id=17171{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her language is violent and linguistically agile, appropriate for her topics which often center on death and/or injustice.&lt;ref&gt;South Korea - Poetry International Web: http://www.poetryinternational.org/piw_cms/cms/cms_module/index.php?obj_id=17171{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many times, Kim’s poetry is marked by the color of blood, as in “red baby,”“red embryonic fluid,”and “red dew.”&lt;ref&gt;Kim Hyesoon, Korean Literature Translation Institute, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Kyōiku kanji'''''|教育漢字||literally "education kanji"}}, also known as {{nihongo|'''''Gakunenbetsu kanji haitōhyō'''''|学年別漢字配当表||literally "list of kanji by [[school year]]"}} is a list of 1,006 [[kanji]] and associated readings developed and maintained by the [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (Japan)|Japanese Ministry of Education]] that prescribes which kanji, and which readings of kanji, Japanese schoolchildren should learn for each year of primary school. Although the list is designed for Japanese children, it can also be used as a sequence of learning characters by non-native speakers as a means of focusing on the most commonly used kanji. ([[:ja:学年別漢字配当表]])

Kyōiku kanji is a subset of [[Jōyō kanji]].

==Versions of kyōiku list==

==List by grade==
Note 1: Many kanji have complex meanings and nuances, or express concepts not directly translatable into English. In those cases, the English meanings mentioned here constitute approximations.

Note 2: In the [[Kanji#Kun'yomi (Japanese reading)|kun'yomi]] readings, readings after - (hyphen) are [[Okurigana]].

Note 3: A - (hyphen) at the end of the -yomi corresponds to a [[Sokuon|small tsu]] in [[Kana|kana]], which indicates that the following consonant is [[Gemination|geminated]].

==Special characters==

===Kokuji===
Kokuji are characters originally created in Japan; two of them are kyōiku kanji:
&lt;span style="font-family:Meiryo; font-size:large; line-height:125%" lang=ja&gt;働&lt;/span&gt; (Grade 4) and &lt;span style="font-family:Meiryo; font-size:large; line-height:125%" lang=ja&gt;畑&lt;/span&gt; (Grade 3). There are also 8 kokuji within the secondary-school kanji and 16 within the jinmeiyō kanji.
The character 働 and some others are also used in Chinese now, but most kokuji are unknown outside Japan.

===Kokkun===
Kokkun are characters and combinations of characters that have different meanings in Japanese and Chinese.

For example, the character combination &lt;span style="font-family:Meiryo; font-size:large; line-height:125%" lang=ja&gt;手紙&lt;/span&gt; means "''letter''" in Japanese, but "''toilet paper''" in Chinese. However, the isolated characters have the same meaning in both languages: 手 (Grade 1) means "''hand''," and 紙  (Grade 2) means "''paper''."

==Simplified characters and their traditional forms==

''See also'' [[shinjitai]] ''and'' [[kyūjitai]]''.''

===Differences in simplification between China and Japan===

China and Japan simplified their writing systems independently from each other. After World War II, their relations were not good, so they did not cooperate. Traditional Chinese characters are still officially used in Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, South Korea (as a supplement to [[Hangul]], but they are no longer used in North Korea), and by many overseas Chinese.
&lt;br /&gt;
In Chinese, many more characters were simplified than in Japanese; some characters were simplified in only one language; other characters were simplified in the same way in both languages, and other characters were simplified in both languages but in different ways. This means that those who want to learn the writing systems of both languages must sometimes learn at least three different variations of one character: traditional Chinese, simplified Chinese, and modern Japanese (for example 兩 - 两 - 両), some others have more variations, such as (斗 - 鬥 - 鬭 - 鬬 - 鬪 - 鬦 - 闘 - 閗), where are considered the older forms of Chinese characters and variations of different Chinese regions, and the older forms of Japanese characters ([[kyūjitai]]).

===Traditional characters that may cause problems displaying===
Note that within the kyōiku kanji, there are 26 characters; the old forms of which may cause problems displaying:

* Grade 2 (2 kanji): &lt;span style="font-family:Meiryo; font-size:large; line-height:125%" lang=ja&gt;海  社&lt;/span&gt;
* Grade 3 (8 kanji): &lt;span style="font-family:Meiryo; font-size:large; line-height:125%" lang=ja&gt;勉  暑 漢 神 福  練  者 都&lt;/span&gt;
* Grade 4 (6 kanji): &lt;span style="font-family:Meiryo; font-size:large; line-height:125%" lang=ja&gt;器  殺 祝 節 梅 類&lt;/span&gt; 
* Grade 5 (1 kanji): &lt;span style="font-family:Meiryo; font-size:large; line-height:125%" lang=ja&gt;祖&lt;/span&gt;
* Grade 6 (9 kanji): &lt;span style="font-family:Meiryo; font-size:large; line-height:125%" lang=ja&gt;勤  穀  視  署  層 著 諸 難 朗&lt;/span&gt;
* Within the jōyō kanji, the same is true for 36 secondary-school kanji, so, in total, 62 of the 2,136 jōyō kanji have traditional forms that may cause problems displaying.

These characters are Unicode CJK Unified Ideographs for which the old form (kyūjitai) and the new form (shinjitai) have been unified under the Unicode standard. Although the old and new forms are distinguished under the JIS X 0213 standard, the old forms map to Unicode CJK Compatibility Ideographs which are considered by Unicode to be canonically equivalent to the new forms and may not be distinguished by user agents. Therefore, depending on the user environment, it may not be possible to see the distinction between old and new forms of the characters. In particular, all Unicode normalization methods merge the old characters with the new ones.

===List of the simplified kyōiku kanji===

For example, 万 is the simplified form of 萬.
Note that 弁 is used to simplify three different traditional characters (辨, 瓣, and 辯).

==The kyōiku kanji and their Chinese hànzì equivalents==

The characters are sorted by the radicals of the Japanese kanji. The two kokuji 働 and 畑, which have no Chinese equivalents, are not listed here. See also the section "''Differences in simplification between China and Japan''."

===Same form in Chinese and Japanese===

The following kyōiku kanji are characters of Group 1 ('''not''' simplified in both languages, e.g. 田). For characters of Group 2 ('''same''' simplification in China and Japan, '''but a traditional form exists,''' e.g. 万-萬-万), see "''Different forms in Chinese and Japanese.''"

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3555">{{other uses|Lolita (disambiguation)}}
'''LOLITA''' is a [[natural language processing]] system developed by [[Durham University]] between 1986 and 2000. The name is an [[acronym]] for "Large-scale, Object-based, [[Linguistics|Linguistic]] [[Interactor]], [[Machine translation|Translator]] and Analyzer".

LOLITA was developed by Roberto Garigliano and colleagues between 1986 and 2000. It was designed as a general-purpose tool for processing unrestricted text that could be the basis of a wide variety of [[Application software|applications]]. At its core was a [[semantic network]] containing some 90,000 interlinked concepts. Text could be [[Parsing|parsed]] and analysed then incorporated into the semantic net, where it could be reasoned about (Long and Garigliano, 1993). Fragments of the semantic net could also be rendered back to [[English language|English]] or [[Spanish language|Spanish]].

Several applications were built using the system, including financial information analysers and information extraction tools for Darpa’s “[[Message Understanding Conference]] Competitions” ([[Message Understanding Conference|MUC-6]] and [[Message Understanding Conference|MUC-7]]). The latter involved processing original [[Wall Street Journal]] articles, to perform tasks such as identifying key job changes in businesses and summarising articles. LOLITA was one of a small number of systems worldwide to compete in all sections of the tasks. A system description and an analysis of the MUC-6 results were written by Callaghan (Callaghan, 1998).

LOLITA was an early example of a substantial application written in a [[Functional programming|functional language]]: it consisted of around 50,000 lines of [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]], with around 6000 lines of [[C (programming language)|C]]. It is also a complex and demanding application, in which many aspects of Haskell were invaluable in development.

LOLITA was designed to handle unrestricted text, so that ambiguity at various levels was unavoidable and significant. [[Lazy evaluation|Laziness]] was essential in handling the explosion of [[Syntax|syntactic]] ambiguity resulting from a large [[grammar]], and it was much used with semantic ambiguity too. The system used multiple "[[Domain-specific programming language|domain specific]] [[Embedded system|embedded]] [[Programming language|languages]]" for [[Semantics|semantic]] and pragmatic processing and for generation of natural language text from the semantic net. Also important was the ability to work with complex abstractions and to [[prototype]] new analysis [[algorithm]]s quickly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj/papers/history-of-haskell/history.pdf A History of Haskell: Being Lazy With Class] section 11.5&lt;/ref&gt;

Later systems based on the same design include Concepts and SenseGraph.

'''La'bi''' is the esoteric [[ritual language]] of male initiation among the [[Gbaya Kara language|Gbaya Kara]], the [[Mbum language|Mbum]], and some [[Sara Laka language|Sara Laka]], in the area of [[Touboro]] near where the CAR, Chad, and Cameroon meet. It has no native speakers. It is related to Mbum, with substantial loans from one or more [[Sara languages]].&lt;ref name="e18" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yves Moñino, 1977.

[[File:South Estonian today.PNG|thumb|right|300px|Estonia with contemporary South Estonian highlighted.]]
The official '''language of [[Estonia]]''' is [[Estonian language|Estonian]], a [[Uralic languages|Uralic language]] which is related to [[Finnish language|Finnish]]. It is unrelated to the bordering [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Latvian language|Latvian]] languages, both of which are [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] (more specifically [[East Slavic languages|East Slavic]] and [[Baltic languages|Baltic]], respectively). Standard Estonian is mainly based on the [[North Estonian language]], while [[South Estonian language|South Estonian]] comprises several [[Estonian language#Dialects|dialects]], specifically [[Võro language|Võro]], Mulgi and Tartu. Võro, being furthest away from Standard Estonian, is the only one to have been given an [[ISO 639-3]] language code by [[SIL International|SIL]] ("vro").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/documentation.asp?id=vro|title=ISO 639 code sets|website=01.sil.org|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Võru is widely accepted to have a subdialect [[Seto language|Setu]], although some consider it a separate language.

== Minority languages ==

=== Russian ===
{{main|Russians in Estonia|Baltic Russians}}
[[File:Russophone population in Estonia.png|thumb|300px|Distribution of the Russian language in Estonia according to data from the 2000 Estonian census.]]
Russian is by far the most spoken minority language in the country. There are towns in [[Estonia]] with large concentrations of Russian speakers and there are towns where Estonian speakers are in the minority (especially in the northeast, e.g. [[Narva]]).

=== German ===
{{main|Baltic Germans}}
The '''Baltic Germans''' ({{lang-de|Deutsch-Balten}}, or ''{{lang|de|Baltendeutsche}}'') were mostly [[ethnic German|ethnically German]] inhabitants of the eastern shore of the [[Baltic Sea]], which today form the countries of [[Estonia]] and [[Latvia]]. The Baltic German population never made up more than 10% of the total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/50985/Baltic-states/253375/Gradual-modernization|title=Baltic states - region, Europe|website=Britannica.com|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; They formed the social, commercial, political and cultural [[élite]] in that region for several centuries. Some of them also took high positions in the military and civilian life of the [[Russian Empire]], particularly in [[Saint Petersburg]].
Their history and presence in the Baltics came to an abrupt end in late 1939 following the signing of the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] and the subsequent [[Nazi-Soviet population transfers]] when almost all the Baltic Germans were resettled by the German Government into the [[Wartheland]] and [[Danzig-West Prussia]]. Today there are very few Germans living in Estonia aside from some temporary residents from [[Germany]]. The German language is the third most popular foreign language among Estonians.

=== Swedish ===
{{main|Estonian Swedes}}
The '''Estonian Swedes''', are a [[Swedish language|Swedish-speaking]] linguistic minority traditionally residing in the coastal areas and islands of what is now western and northern [[Estonia]]. The beginning of the continuous settlement of Estonian Swedes in these areas (known as ''Aiboland'') dates back to the 13th and 14th centuries, when their Swedish-speaking ancestors arrived in Estonia from what is now [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]]. Almost all of Estonia's Swedish-speaking minority fled to Sweden during [[World War II]], and only the descendants of a few individuals who opted to stay are permanently resident in Estonia today.

=== Sign languages ===
The [[Estonian Sign Language]] ('''ESL''', {{lang-et|Eesti viipekeel}}) is the national [[sign language]] of [[Estonia]]. In 1998 there were about 4,500 signers out a population of 1,600 deaf and 20,000 hearing impaired.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://libguides.gallaudet.edu/content.php?pid=119476&amp;sid=1061103|title=LibGuides. Deaf Statistics. Europe.|last=Henry|first=Sarah Hamrick, Laura Jacobi, Patrick Oberholtzer, Elizabeth|website=Libguides.gallaudet.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is widespread in the cities of [[Tallinn]] and [[Pärnu]] among deaf ethnic Estonians; deaf Russian Estonians in Tallinn use [[Russian Sign Language]], Russians outside Tallinn tend to use a Russian&amp;ndash;Estonian Sign Language pidgin, or may be bilingual. In its formative stages, Estonian Sign Language was influenced by Russian and [[Finnish Sign Language]]; for example, the ESL sign for 'butterfly' developed from the Finnish sign for 'bird'. There are several dialects, the most archaic of which is the Pärnu variety.

Both English and Manx are official languages in [[Tynwald]].

==Manx==

{{main|Manx language}}
The Manx language is a Celtic language of the [[Goidelic languages|Goidelic]] subdivision, and descendant of Old Irish. It is sometimes called Manx Gaelic to distinguish it from the local variety of English.

The language was historically the dominant one on the island, but fell out of use during the twentieth century, and is considered to have become extinct in 1974 after the death of [[Ned Maddrell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=glv |title=Manx |publisher=Ethnologue |date=1999-02-19 |accessdate=2014-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the present time, less than one hundred children receive their education exclusively in Manx. There are an additional 1,689 second-language speakers, comprising 2.2% of the population of the Isle of Man. The language has been offered in public schools since 1992, and has been mandatory since 2001.

==English language==
{{main|British English|Manx English}}

The English language has replaced Manx as the dominant language on the island. The native dialect is known as [[Manx English|Anglo-Manx]] or Manx English, and has been employed by a number of the island's more notable writers such as [[T.E. Brown]] and "[[Josephine Kermode (Cushag)|Cushag]]". which distinguishes itself by considerable influence and a large number of loanwords and phrases from Manx Gaelic. However, this dialect is being supplanted by other dialects of English, especially from north west England.

For formal purposes [[British English]] is the usual form of English used in the Isle of Man. For many years, the [[BBC]] has been the main broadcaster to the island, and many [[English people]] have settled in the IOM. 

Forms of [[Irish English]] can also be heard on the island, from both [[Dublin]] and [[Belfast]]. The island has traditionally had many [[Irish people|Irish]] tourists, and settlers.

==Other minority languages==
There are a few people in the island who speak other languages habitually. These include [[Irish language|Irish]] speakers. [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] are also taught in the island's schools.

==Extinct languages of the Isle of Man==

===Historical forms of "Irish"===
[[Old Irish]] and [[Middle Irish]] are the ancestors of today's Manx language. Neither of these became extinct, so much as evolved, and Manx diverged from Scottish and Irish forms.

During the Middle Ages, the three Gaelic languages maintained a single standard for higher registers and poetry. This is sometimes misleadingly referred to as "[[Classical Irish]]" - despite the fact it was much in use in [[Scotland]] and presumably the Isle of Man. It is also known as [[Classical Gaelic]].

===Old Norse===
Many of the island's placenames are [[Old Norse|Norse]] in origin, e.g. [[Laxey]], [[Ramsey, Isle of Man|Ramsey]], and so are some of the island's institutions e.g. [[Tynwald]] (''Þingvóllr''). A few Norse inscriptions remain.

===Brythonic===
There seems to be evidence that the island once spoke a form of [[P-Celtic]] before it became [[Gaelicisation|Gaelicised]]. There is little evidence of this in placenames however.

===Latin and French===
[[Latin language|Latin]] and [[French language|French]] have been used in ceremonial purposes, e.g. legal use, and mottos, as in the UK.

'''Mahesh Elkunchwar''' (Born 9 October 1939) is an [[India]]n playwright, screenplay writer with more than 20 plays to his name, in addition to his theoretical writings, critical works, and his active work in India's ''[[Parallel Cinema]]'' as actor{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} and screenwriter. Today along with [[Vijay Tendulkar]],  he is credited as one of the most influential and progressive playwrights not just in [[Marathi theatre]], but also in [[Indian theatre]]. In 2014, he was awarded the [[Sangeet Natak Akademi Fellowship]], the highest honour in performing arts in [[India]].&lt;ref name=mi&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.livemint.com/2009/02/06211922/Fringe-takes-centre-stage.html|title=Fringe takes centre stage: The importance of being Mahesh Elkunchwar and Satish Alekar in Marathi theatre|date=6 February 2009|publisher=Mint |accessdate=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Born to a 9th generation [[Telugu Brahmin]] migrant family in Parwa village in [[Vidarbha]] region of [[Maharashtra]], at the age of four he had to leave his parents and leave a city where he grew up a lonely child and hardly interested in studies, and raised outside of Indian urban centres. As films and theatre were taboo in his family, he saw his first play when he moved to [[Nagpur]] for his matriculation. Here he studied at Morris College, and went on to do M.A. in English from [[Nagpur University]]. While still college came the turning point in his life, when one day he went to watch a film and unable to get movie ticket, he ended up watching a play. That play was a veteran theatre director [[Vijaya Mehta]]'s production of [[Vijay Tendulkar]]'s ''Mee jinkalo mee Haralo'' (I Won, I Lost) in 1965. Deeply influenced by the play, he went to watch play again the following day and decided to write plays. He devoted the next year to reading plays of all kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=I'm writer by default, says Elkunchwar|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-02-13/nagpur/28139333_1_mahesh-elkunchwar-award-vijay-tendulkar |publisher=[[The Times of India]] |date=13 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tribune1998&gt;{{cite news |title=Urban folk theatre is artistic kleptomania|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/1998/98oct18/sunday/view.htm |publisher=[[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]] |date=18 October 1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
He taught English literature at Dharampeth Arts, Commerce College, Nagpur and M. P. Deo Memorial Science College, Nagpur, until retiring as its Head in 1999.He was a guest professor of screen play-writing at the Film and Television Institute, Pune in 2000-2001.He taught as a visiting professor at the National school of Drama, New Delhi for a number of years.

Elkunchwar has experimented with many forms of dramatic expression, ranging from the realistic to symbolic, [[Expressionist theater|expressionist]] to [[absurd theatre]] with theme ranging from creativity to life, sterility to death and has influenced modern Indian theatre for more than three decades.&lt;ref name=mi/&gt; Elkunchwar emerged onto the national theatre scene with the publication of his one-act play ''Sultan'' in 1967 in noted literary magazine ''Satyakatha''. This play was immediately noticed by Vijaya Mehta; she went on to direct four of his early plays, including ''Holi'' and ''Sultan'' in 1969 and 1970 for ''Rangayan''.&lt;ref name=mi/&gt; A number of commercial hits followed such as ''Holi'' (1969), ''Raktapushpa'' (1971), ''Party'' (1972), ''Virasat'' (1982), and ''Atamkatha'' (1987).

Considered a successor to [[Vijay Tendulkar]],&lt;ref name=tribune1998/&gt; Elkunchwar's plays are written in [[Marathi language|Marathi]], the Indian language that is spoken by approximately 90 million people. The plays have been subsequently translated into multiple Indian and Western languages (including English, French and German).

In 1984, his play ''Holi'' was made into the film ''[[Holi (1984 film)|Holi]]'' by [[Ketan Mehta]], for which he wrote the screenplay. In the same year, [[Govind Nihalani]] directed a film, ''[[Party (1984 film)|Party]]'', based on his eponymous play. Sonata (2017), a film starring Aparna Sen, Shabana Azmi and Lilette Dubey was based on Elkunchwar's eponymous play.

A lesser known fact about him is as Mahesh Elkunchwar, the essaysist. His collection of essays 'Maunraag' has broken new grounds in this genre and was considered the book of the decade in 2012. An uncanny blend of autobiographical and meditative, His essay show his erudition and a vivid imagination.

'''Paper''' is a thin material produced by pressing together moist [[fibre]]s of [[cellulose]] pulp derived from [[wood]], [[Textile|rags]] or [[poaceae|grasses]], and drying them into flexible sheets.
It is a versatile material with many uses, including [[writing]], [[printing]], packaging, [[Housekeeping|cleaning]], decorating, and a number of industrial and construction processes. Papers are essential in legal or non-legal documentation.

The pulp papermaking process is said to have been developed in [[History of China|China]] during the early 2nd century CE, possibly as early as the year 105 CE,&lt;ref&gt;Hogben, Lancelot. "Printing, Paper and Playing Cards". Bennett, Paul A. (ed.) ''Books and Printing: A Treasury for Typophiles''. New York: The World Publishing Company, 1951. pp. 15–31. p. 17. &amp; Mann, George. ''Print: A Manual for Librarians and Students Describing in Detail the History, Methods, and Applications of Printing and Paper Making''. London: Grafton &amp; Co., 1952. p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[Han Dynasty|Han]] court [[eunuch]] [[Cai Lun]], although the earliest archaeological fragments of paper derive from the 2nd century BCE in China.&lt;ref name="Tsien1985"&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The modern [[pulp and paper industry]] is global, with China leading its production and the United States right behind it.

==History==
{{Main|History of paper}}
[[File:Chinese hemp paper western han.jpg|thumb|[[Hemp]] [[wrapping paper]], China, circa 100 BC.]]
The oldest known archaeological fragments of the immediate precursor to modern paper date to the 2nd century BCE in [[China]]. The pulp paper-making process is ascribed to [[Cai Lun]], a 2nd-century CE [[Han Dynasty|Han]] court [[eunuch]].&lt;ref name="Tsien1985" /&gt;

In the 13th century, the knowledge and uses of paper spread from China through the [[Middle East]] to [[medieval Europe]], where the first water powered [[paper mill]]s were built.&lt;ref name="Burns 1996, 417f."&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|1996|pp=417f.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because paper was introduced to the West through the city of Baghdad, it was first called ''bagdatikos''.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Stuart A. P. ''The Library: An illustrated History''. Skyhorse Publishing, 2009, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 19th century, industrialization greatly reduced the cost of manufacturing paper. In 1844, the Canadian inventor [[Charles Fenerty]] and the German F. G. Keller independently developed processes for pulping wood fibres.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.charlesfenerty.ca/book.html|title=Charles Fenerty and his paper invention|last=Burger|first=Peter|date=2007|publisher=Peter Burger|location=Toronto|isbn=9780978331818|oclc=173248586|pages=25–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early sources of fibre==

{{see also|wood pulp|deinking}}
Before the industrialisation of paper production the most common fibre source was recycled fibres from used textiles, called rags. The rags were from [[hemp]], [[linen]] and [[cotton]].&lt;ref name=PST1&gt;{{Cite book|title=Recycling fiber and deinking|last=Göttsching|first=Lothar|last2=Gullichsen|first2=Johan|last3=Pakarinen|first3=Heikki|last4=Paulapuro|first4=Hannu|last5=Yhdistys|first5=Suomen Paperi-Insinöörien|author6=Technical Association of the Pulp and Paper Industry|date=2000|publisher=Fapet Oy|location=Finland|isbn=978-9525216073|oclc=247670296|pages=12–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; A process for removing printing inks from [[recycled paper]] was invented by German jurist [[Justus Claproth]] in 1774.&lt;ref name=PST1 /&gt; Today this method is called [[deinking]]. It was not until the introduction of [[wood pulp]] in 1843 that paper production was not dependent on recycled materials from [[ragpicker]]s.&lt;ref name=PST1 /&gt;

==Etymology==
{{Further|Papyrus}}

The word "paper" is etymologically derived from [[Latin]] ''papyrus'', which comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] πάπυρος (''papuros''), the word for the ''[[Cyperus papyrus]]'' plant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpa%2Fpuros πάπυρος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/papyrus papyrus], on Oxford Dictionaries&lt;/ref&gt; [[Papyrus]] is a thick, paper-like material produced from the pith of the ''Cyperus papyrus'' plant, which was used in [[ancient Egypt]] and other [[History of the Mediterranean region|Mediterranean]] cultures for [[History of writing|writing]] before the introduction of paper into the Middle East and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Dictionary.com|papyrus|accessdate=20 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the word paper is etymologically derived from papyrus, the two are produced very differently and the development of the first is distinct from the development of the second. Papyrus is a lamination of natural plant fibres, while paper is manufactured from fibres whose properties have been changed by maceration.&lt;ref name="Tsien1985" /&gt;

==Papermaking==
{{Main|Papermaking}}

===Chemical pulping===
{{Main|kraft process|sulfite process|soda pulping}}

To make pulp from wood, a [[chemical pulping process]] separates [[lignin]] from [[cellulose]] fibres. This is accomplished by dissolving [[lignin]] in a cooking liquor, so that it may be washed from the [[cellulose]]; this preserves the length of the cellulose fibres. Paper made from chemical pulps are also known as [[wood-free paper]]s–not to be confused with [[tree-free paper]]; this is because they do not contain lignin, which deteriorates over time. The pulp can also be [[bleaching of wood pulp|bleached]] to produce white paper, but this consumes 5% of the fibres; chemical pulping processes are not used to make paper made from cotton, which is already 90% cellulose.

[[File:PaperAutofluorescence.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|The microscopic structure of paper: [[Micrograph]] of paper [[autofluorescence|autofluorescing]] under [[ultraviolet]] illumination. The individual fibres in this sample are around 10 [[micrometre|µm]] in diameter.]]

There are three main chemical pulping processes: the [[sulfite process]] dates back to the 1840s and it was the dominant method extent before the second world war. The [[kraft process]], invented in the 1870s and first used in the 1890s, is now the most commonly practiced strategy, one of its advantages is the chemical reaction with lignin, that produces heat, which can be used to run a generator. Most pulping operations using the kraft process are net contributors to the electricity grid or use the electricity to run an adjacent paper mill. Another advantage is that this process recovers and reuses all inorganic chemical reagents. [[Soda pulping]] is another specialty process used to pulp [[straw]]s, [[bagasse]] and [[hardwoods]] with high [[silicate]] content.

===Mechanical pulping===
There are two major mechanical pulps: thermomechanical pulp (TMP) and groundwood pulp (GW). In the TMP process, wood is chipped and then fed into steam heated refiners, where the chips are squeezed and converted to fibres between two steel discs. In the groundwood process, debarked logs are fed into grinders where they are pressed against rotating stones to be made into fibres. Mechanical pulping does not remove the [[lignin]], so the yield is very high, &gt;95%, however it causes the paper thus produced to turn yellow and become brittle over time. Mechanical pulps have rather short fibres, thus producing weak paper. Although large amounts of [[electrical energy]] are required to produce mechanical pulp, it costs less than the chemical kind.

===De-inked pulp===
[[Paper recycling]] processes can use either chemically or mechanically produced pulp; by mixing it with water and applying mechanical action the [[hydrogen]] bonds in the paper can be broken and fibres separated again. Most recycled paper contains a proportion of virgin fibre for the sake of quality; generally speaking, de-inked pulp is of the same quality or lower than the collected paper it was made from.

There are three main classifications of recycled fibre:.
* Mill broke or internal mill waste&amp;nbsp;– This incorporates any substandard or grade-change paper made within the paper mill itself, which then goes back into the manufacturing system to be re-pulped back into paper. Such out-of-specification paper is not sold and is therefore often not classified as genuine reclaimed recycled fibre, however most paper mills have been reusing their own waste fibre for many years, long before recycling became popular.
* Preconsumer waste&amp;nbsp;– This is offcut and processing waste, such as guillotine trims and envelope blank waste; it is generated outside the paper mill and could potentially go to landfill, and is a genuine recycled fibre source; it includes de-inked preconsumer (recycled material that has been printed but did not reach its intended end use, such as waste from printers and unsold publications).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrdc.org/ Natural Resource Defense Council]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Postconsumer waste&amp;nbsp;– This is fibre from paper that has been used for its intended end use and includes office waste, magazine papers and newsprint. As the vast majority of this material has been printed&amp;nbsp;– either digitally or by more conventional means such as lithography or rotogravure&amp;nbsp;– it will either be recycled as printed paper or go through a de-inking process first.

Recycled papers can be made from 100% recycled materials or blended with virgin pulp, although they are (generally) not as strong nor as bright as papers made from the latter.

===Additives===
Besides the fibres, pulps may contain fillers such as [[chalk]] or [[china clay]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=SHiQAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=pulps+may+contain+fillers+such+as+chalk+or+china+clay&amp;dq=pulps+may+contain+fillers+such+as+chalk+or+china+clay|title=Appropriate Technology|date=1996|publisher=Intermediate Technology Publications.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; which improve its characteristics for printing or writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=zp0_a909uyIC&amp;pg=PA203&amp;dq=Besides+the+fibres,+paper+pulps+may+contain+fillers+such+as+chalk+or+china+clay,+which+improve+its+characteristics|title=Applications of Wet-End Paper Chemistry|last=Thorn|first=Ian|last2=Au|first2=Che On|date=2009-07-24|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9781402060380|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additives for [[sizing]] purposes may be mixed with it or applied to the paper web later in the manufacturing process; the purpose of such sizing is to establish the correct level of surface absorbency to suit ink or paint.

===Producing paper===
{{Main|Paper machine|papermaking}}

The [[Pulp (paper)|pulp]] is fed to a paper machine where it is formed as a paper web and the water is removed from it by pressing and drying.

Pressing the sheet removes the water by force; once the water is forced from the sheet, a special kind of felt, which is not to be confused with the traditional one, is used to collect the water; whereas when making paper by hand, a blotter sheet is used instead.

Drying involves using air or heat to remove water from the paper sheets. In the earliest days of paper making, this was done by hanging the sheets like laundry; in more modern times, various forms of heated drying mechanisms are used. On the paper machine, the most common is the steam-heated can dryer. These can reach temperatures above {{convert|200|F|C}} and are used in long sequences of more than forty cans where the heat produced by these can easily dry the paper to less than six percent moisture.

===Finishing===
The paper may then undergo [[sizing]] to alter its physical properties for use in various applications.

Paper at this point is ''uncoated''. [[Coated paper]] has a thin layer of material such as [[calcium carbonate]] or [[china clay]] applied to one or both sides in order to create a surface more suitable for high-resolution [[halftone]] screens. (Uncoated papers are rarely suitable for screens above 150 lpi.) Coated or uncoated papers may have their surfaces polished by [[calender]]ing. Coated papers are divided into matte, semi-matte or silk, and gloss. Gloss papers give the highest [[optical density]] in the printed image.

The paper is then fed onto reels if it is to be used on web printing presses, or cut into sheets for other printing processes or other purposes. The fibres in the paper basically run in the machine direction. Sheets are usually cut "long-grain", i.e. with the grain parallel to the longer dimension of the sheet. [[Continuous stationery|Continuous form paper]] (or continuous stationery) is cut to width with holes punched at the edges, and folded into stacks.

====Paper grain====
All paper produced by paper machines as the [[Fourdrinier Machine]] are wove paper, i.e. the wire mesh that transports the web leaves a pattern that has the same density along the paper grain and across the grain. Textured finishes, [[watermark]]s and wire patterns imitating hand-made ''laid'' paper can be created by the use of appropriate rollers in the later stages of the machine.

Wove paper does not exhibit "laidlines", which are small regular lines left behind on paper when it was handmade in a mould made from rows of metal wires or bamboo. Laidlines are very close together. They run perpendicular to the "chainlines", which are further apart. Handmade paper similarly exhibits "deckle edges", or rough and feathery borders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/forgery/ "Document Doubles"] in a virtual museum exhibition at Library and Archives Canada&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

It is estimated that paper-based storage solutions captured 0.33% of the total in 1986 and only 0.007% in 2007, even though in absolute terms, the world's capacity to store information on paper increased from 8.7 to 19.4 [[petabyte]]s.&lt;ref name="HilbertLopez2011"&gt;[http://science.sciencemag.org/content/332/6025/60 "The World’s Technological Capacity to Store, Communicate, and Compute Information"], especially [http://science.sciencemag.org/content/suppl/2011/02/08/science.1200970.DC1/Hilbert-SOM.pdf Supporting online material], Martin Hilbert and Priscila López (2011), [[Science (journal)|Science]], 332(6025), 60–65; free access to the article through here: martinhilbert.net/WorldInfoCapacity.html {{doi|10.1126/science.1200970}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that in 1986 paper-based postal letters represented less than 0.05% of the world's telecommunication capacity, with sharply decreasing tendency after the massive introduction of digital technologies.&lt;ref name="HilbertLopez2011"/&gt;

Paper has a major role in the visual arts. It is used by itself to form two and three-dimensional shapes and [[collage]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.arts.gov/50th/stories/lynette-schweigert|title=Lynette Schweigert|date=2015-11-05|work=NEA|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.arts.gov/honors/heritage/fellows/herminia-albarr%C3%A1n-romero|title=Herminia Albarrán Romero|date=2013-01-24|work=NEA|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also evolved to being a structural material used in furniture design.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morris|date=August-September 2018|title=Material Values, Paper|url=|journal=The Economist |volume=|pages=38|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Watercolor paper]] has a long history of production and use.

==Types, thickness and weight==
{{Main|Paper size|Grammage|Paper density}}
[[File:Coloured, textured craft card.jpg|thumb|right|Card and paper stock for [[crafts]] use comes in a wide variety of textures and colors.]]

The thickness of paper is often measured by caliper, which is typically given in thousandths of an inch in the United States and in micrometers (µm) in the rest of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.casepaper.com/resources/charts/paper-thickness-caliper/|title=Paper Thickness (Caliper) Chart|website=Case Paper|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paper may be between {{convert|0.07|and|0.18|mm|in}} thick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2001/JuliaSherlis.shtml|title=Thickness of a Piece of Paper|last=Elert|first=Glenn|website=The Physics Factbook|language=en|access-date=2017-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paper is often characterized by weight. In the United States, the weight assigned to a paper is the weight of a ream, 500 sheets, of varying "basic sizes", before the paper is cut into the size it is sold to end customers. For example, a ream of 20&amp;nbsp;lb, {{convert|8.5|x|11|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} paper weighs 5 pounds, because it has been cut from a larger sheet into four pieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Hammerhill guide to desktop publishing in business|last=McKenzie|first=Bruce G.|date=1989|publisher=Hammerhill|isbn=9780961565114|oclc=851074844|page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, printing paper is generally 20&amp;nbsp;lb, 24&amp;nbsp;lb, or 32&amp;nbsp;lb at most. [[Cover stock]] is generally 68&amp;nbsp;lb, and 110&amp;nbsp;lb or more is considered [[card stock]].

In Europe, and other regions using the [[ISO 216]] paper sizing system, the weight is expressed in grammes per square metre (g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or usually just g) of the paper. Printing paper is generally between 60&amp;nbsp;g and 120&amp;nbsp;g. Anything heavier than 160&amp;nbsp;g is considered card. The weight of a ream therefore depends on the dimensions of the paper and its thickness.

Most commercial paper sold in North America is cut to standard paper sizes based on [[United States customary units|customary units]] and is defined by the length and width of a sheet of paper.

The ISO 216 system used in most other countries is based on the surface area of a sheet of paper, not on a sheet's width and length. It was first adopted in Germany in 1922 and generally spread as nations adopted the metric system. The largest standard size paper is A0 (A zero), measuring one square meter (approx. 1189 × 841&amp;nbsp;mm). A1 is half the size of a sheet of A0 (i.e., 594&amp;nbsp;mm × 841&amp;nbsp;mm), such that two sheets of A1 placed side by side are equal to one sheet of A0.  A2 is half the size of a sheet of A1, and so forth. Common sizes used in the office and the home are A4 and A3 (A3 is the size of two A4 sheets).

The [[density]] of paper ranges from {{convert|250|kg/m3|lb/ft3|0|abbr=on}} for tissue paper to {{convert|1500|kg/m3|lb/ft3|0|abbr=on}} for some speciality paper. Printing paper is about {{convert|800|kg/m3|lb/ft3|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paperonweb.com/density.htm|title=Density of paper and paperboard|publisher=PaperOnWeb|accessdate=31 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paper may be classified into seven categories:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Thames and Hudson manual of bookbinding|last=Johnson|first=Arthur|date=1978|publisher=Thames and Hudson|location=London|oclc=959020143|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Printing papers'' of wide variety.
* ''Wrapping papers'' for the protection of goods and merchandise. This includes wax and kraft papers.
* ''Writing paper'' suitable for stationery requirements. This includes ledger, bank, and bond paper.
* ''Blotting papers'' containing little or no size.
* ''Drawing papers'' usually with rough surfaces used by artists and designers, including cartridge paper.
* ''Handmade papers'' including most decorative papers, [[Ingres paper]]s, [[Japanese paper]] and [[tissue paper|tissues]], all characterized by lack of grain direction.
* ''Specialty papers'' including cigarette paper, toilet tissue, and other industrial papers.

==Paper stability==
Much of the early paper made from wood pulp contained significant amounts of [[alum]], a variety of [[aluminium sulfate]] salts that is significantly [[acidic]]. Alum was added to paper to assist in [[sizing]],&lt;ref name="bier"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Essentials of pulping and papermaking|last=Biermann|first=Christopher J/|date=1993|publisher=Academic Press|location=San Diego|isbn=978-0120973606|oclc=813399142}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it somewhat water resistant so that [[inks]] did not "run" or spread uncontrollably. Early papermakers did not realize that the alum they added liberally to cure almost every problem encountered in making their product is eventually detrimental.&lt;ref name="clark"&gt;{{cite book |last=Clark |first=James d'A. |authorlink= |title=Pulp Technology and Treatment for Paper |edition=2nd |date=1985 |publisher=Miller Freeman Publications |location=San Francisco |isbn=978-0-87930-164-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[cellulose]] fibres that make up paper are [[hydrolyzed]] by acid, and the presence of alum eventually degrades the fibres until the paper disintegrates in a process known as "[[slow fires|slow fire]]". Documents written on [[Cotton paper|rag paper]] are significantly more stable. The use of non-acidic additives to make paper is becoming more prevalent, and the stability of these papers is less of an issue.

Paper made from [[pulp mill#The mill|mechanical pulp]] contains significant amounts of [[lignin]], a major component in wood. In the presence of light and oxygen, lignin reacts to give yellow materials,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fabbri | first1 = Claudia | last2 = Bietti | first2 = Massimo | last3 = Lanzalunga | first3 = Osvaldo | year = 2005| title = Generation and Reactivity of Ketyl Radicals with Lignin Related Structures.

Chem. | volume = 2005 | issue = 70| pages = 2720–2728 | doi = 10.1021/jo047826u | pmid = 15787565 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is why [[newsprint]] and other mechanical paper yellows with age. Paper made from [[bleaching of wood pulp|bleached]] [[kraft process|kraft]] or [[sulfite process|sulfite]] pulps does not contain significant amounts of lignin and is therefore better suited for books, documents and other applications where whiteness of the paper is essential.

Paper made from wood pulp is not necessarily less durable than a rag paper. The aging behavior of a paper is determined by its manufacture, not the original source of the fibers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Erhardt | first1 = D. | last2 = Tumosa | first2 = C. | year = 2005 | title = Chemical Degradation of Cellulose in Paper over 500 years | journal = Restaurator: International Journal for the Preservation of Library and Archival Material | volume = 26 | issue = 3| page = 155 | doi=10.1515/rest.2005.26.3.151}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, tests sponsored by the Library of Congress prove that all paper is at risk of acid decay, because cellulose itself produces formic, acetic, lactic and oxalic acids.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Mechanical pulping yields almost a tonne of pulp per tonne of dry wood used, which is why mechanical pulps are sometimes referred to as "high yield" pulps. With almost twice the yield as chemical pulping, mechanical pulps is often cheaper. Mass-market paperback books and newspapers tend to use mechanical papers. Book publishers tend to use [[acid-free paper]], made from fully bleached chemical pulps for [[hardback]] and [[Trade paperbacks|trade paperback]] books.

== Environmental impact ==
{{Main|Environmental impact of paper|Deforestation}}

The production and use of paper has a number of adverse effects on the environment.

Worldwide consumption of paper has risen by 400% in the past 40 years{{clarify|date=November 2017}} leading to increase in [[deforestation]], with 35% of harvested trees being used for paper manufacture. Most paper companies also plant trees to help regrow forests. Logging of [[old growth forest]]s accounts for less than 10% of wood pulp,&lt;ref name="chase"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecology.com/feature-stories/paper-chase/index.html |title=Paper Chase |accessdate=21 September 2007 |last=Martin |first=Sam |date=2004 |website= |publisher=Ecology Communications, Inc. |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070619104819/http://www.ecology.com/feature-stories/paper-chase/index.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 19 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is one of the most controversial issues.

Paper waste accounts for up to 40% of total waste produced in the United States each year, which adds up to 71.6&amp;nbsp;million tons of paper waste per year in the United States alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=General Overview of What's in America's Trash |url=http://www.epa.gov/osw/wycd/catbook/what.htm |publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency |accessdate=4 April 2012 |author=EPA |date=28 June 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105015733/http://www.epa.gov/osw/wycd/catbook/what.htm |archivedate=5 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The average office worker in the US prints 31 pages every day.&lt;ref&gt;Groll, T. 2015 [http://www.zeit.de/karriere/2015-06/papier-enerige-sparen-unternehmen In vielen Büros wird unnötig viel ausgedruckt], Zeit Online, 20 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Americans also use in the order of 16&amp;nbsp;billion [[paper cup]]s per year.

Conventional bleaching of wood pulp using elemental chlorine produces and releases into the environment large amounts of [[organochloride|chlorinated organic compounds]], including chlorinated [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxins]].&lt;ref name="can"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/environmental-workplace-health/reports-publications/environmental-contaminants/canadian-environmental-protection-act-priority-substances-list-assessment-report-effluents-pulp-mills-using-bleaching.html |title=Effluents from Pulp Mills using Bleaching – PSL1 |accessdate=21 September 2007 |last= |first= |date=1991 |work={{ISBN|0-662-18734-2}} DSS |publisher=Health Canada}} [https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/hc-sc/migration/hc-sc/ewh-semt/alt_formats/hecs-sesc/pdf/pubs/contaminants/psl1-lsp1/pulp_mill_effluents_pate_blanchie/pulp_bleaching-pate_blanchie-eng.pdf Pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Dioxins are recognized as a persistent environmental pollutant, regulated internationally by the [[Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants]]. Dioxins are highly toxic, and health effects on humans include reproductive, developmental, immune and hormonal problems. They are known to be carcinogenic. Over 90% of human exposure is through food, primarily meat, dairy, fish and shellfish, as dioxins accumulate in the food chain in the fatty tissue of animals.&lt;ref&gt;

== Future ==
Some manufacturers have started using a new, significantly more environmentally friendly alternative to expanded plastic packaging. Made out of paper, and known commercially as PaperFoam, the new packaging has mechanical properties very similar to those of some expanded plastic packaging, but is [[Biodegradation|biodegradable]] and can also be recycled with ordinary paper.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paperfoam.com/ PaperFoam Carbon Friendly Packaging]&lt;/ref&gt;

With increasing environmental concerns about synthetic coatings (such as [[PFOA]]) and the higher prices of hydrocarbon based petrochemicals, there is a focus on [[zein]] (corn protein) as a coating for paper in high grease applications such as popcorn bags.&lt;ref&gt;[https://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?CC=WO&amp;NR=2006002346&amp;KC=&amp;FT=E&amp;locale=en_EP Barrier compositions and articles produced with the compositions cross-reference to related application]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, synthetics such as [[Tyvek]] and [[Teslin (material)|Teslin]] have been introduced as printing media as a more durable material than paper.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11769">'''Pregroup grammar (PG)''' is a [[Formal grammar|grammar formalism]] intimately related to [[categorial grammar]]s. Much like categorial grammar (CG), PG is a kind of [[type logical grammar]]. Unlike CG, however, PG does not have a distinguished function type. Rather, PG uses inverse types combined with its monoidal operation.

== Definition of a pregroup ==

A pregroup is a [[partial order|partially ordered]] [[universal algebra|algebra]] &lt;math&gt;(A, 1, \cdot, -^l, -^r, \leq)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;(A, 1, \cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[monoid]], satisfying the following relations:

* &lt;math&gt;x^l \cdot x \leq 1 \qquad x \cdot x^r \leq 1&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(contraction)
* &lt;math&gt;1 \leq x \cdot x^l \qquad 1 \leq x^r \cdot x&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(expansion)

The contraction and expansion relations are sometimes called  [[Ajdukiewicz]] laws.

From this, it can be proven that the following equations hold:

* &lt;math&gt;1^l = 1 = 1^r&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;x^{lr} = x = x^{rl}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;(x\cdot y)^l = y^l \cdot x^l \qquad (x\cdot y)^r = y^r \cdot x^r&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x^l&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x^r&lt;/math&gt; are called the [[left adjoint|left]] and [[right adjoint]]s of ''x'', respectively.

The symbol &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\leq&lt;/math&gt; are also written &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\to&lt;/math&gt; respectively. In [[category theory]], pregroups are also known as [[autonomous category|autonomous categories]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference

== Definition of a pregroup grammar ==

A pregroup grammar consists of a [[lexicon]] of words (and possibly [[morphemes]]) ''L'', a set of atomic types ''T'' which [[free object|freely generates]] a pregroup, and an relation &lt;math&gt;:&lt;/math&gt; that relates words to types. In simple pregroup grammars, typing is a function that maps words to only one type each.

=== Examples ===

Some simple, intuitive examples using English as the language to model demonstrate the core principles behind pregroups and their use in linguistic domains.

Let ''L'' = {John, Mary, the, dog, cat, met, barked, at}, let ''T'' = {''N, S, N''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}, and let the following typing relation holds:

: &lt;math&gt;\text{John} : N \qquad \text{Mary} : N \qquad \text{the} : N \cdot N_0^l \qquad \text{dog} : N_0 \qquad \text{cat} : N_0&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\text{met} : N^r \cdot S \cdot N^l \qquad \text{barked} : N^r \cdot S \qquad \text{at} : S^r \cdot N^{rr} \cdot N^r \cdot S \cdot N^l&lt;/math&gt;

A sentence ''S'' that has type ''T'' is said to be grammatical if &lt;math&gt;T \leq S&lt;/math&gt;. We can prove this by use of a chain of &lt;math&gt;\leq&lt;/math&gt;. For example, we can prove that &lt;math&gt;\text{John met Mary} : N \cdot N^r \cdot S \cdot N^l \cdot N&lt;/math&gt; is grammatical by proving that &lt;math&gt;N \cdot N^r \cdot S \cdot N^l \cdot N \leq S&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;N \cdot N^r \cdot S \cdot N^l \cdot N ~\leq~ S \cdot N^l \cdot N ~\leq~ S&lt;/math&gt;

by first using contraction on &lt;math&gt;N \cdot N^r&lt;/math&gt; and then again on &lt;math&gt;N^l \cdot N&lt;/math&gt;. A more convenient notation exists, however, that indicates contractions by connecting them with a drawn link between the contracting types (provided that the links are nested, i.e. don't cross). Words are also typically placed above their types to make the proof more intuitive. The same proof in this notation is simply

A more complex example proves that ''the dog barked at the cat'' is grammatical:

== Historical notes ==

Pregroup grammars have been introduced by [[Joachim Lambek]] in 1993 as a development of his [[Categorial grammar|syntactic calculus]], replacing the quotients by adjoints.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such adjoints had already been used earlier by [[Zellig Harris|Harris]] but without iterated adjoints and expansion rules.
Adding such adjoints was interesting to handle more complex linguistic cases, where the fact that &lt;math&gt;a^{ll} \neq a&lt;/math&gt; is needed. It was also motivated by a more algebraic viewpoint: the definition of a pregroup is a weakening of that of a [[Group (mathematics)|group]], introducing a distinction between the left and right inverses and replacing the equality by an order. This weakening was needed because using types from a [[free group]] would not work: an adjective would get the type &lt;math&gt;N \cdot N^{-1} = 1&lt;/math&gt;, hence it could be inserted at any position in the sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

== Semantics of pregroup grammars ==

Because of the lack of function types in PG, the usual method of giving a semantics via the [[Lambda calculus|λ-calculus]] or via function denotations is not available in any obvious way. Instead, two different methods exist, one purely formal method that corresponds to the λ-calculus, and one denotational method analogous to (a fragment of) the tensor mathematics of [[quantum mechanics]].

=== Purely formal semantics ===

The purely formal semantics for PG consists of a logical language defined according to the following rules:

* Given a set of atomic terms ''T'' = {''a'', ''b'', ...} and atomic function symbols ''F'' = {''f&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;, g&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', ...} (where subscripts are meta-notational indicating arity), and variables ''x'', ''y'', ..., all constants, variables, and well-formed function applications are basic terms (a function application is well-formed when the function symbol is applied to the appropriate number of arguments, which can be drawn from the atomic terms, variables, or can be other basic terms)
* Any basic term is a term
* Given any variable ''x'', [''x''] is a term
* Given any terms ''m'' and ''n'', &lt;math&gt;m \cdot n&lt;/math&gt; is a term

Some examples of terms are ''f''(''x''), ''g''(''a'',''h''(''x'',''y'')), &lt;math&gt;g(x,b) \cdot [x]&lt;/math&gt;. A variable ''x'' is free in a term ''t'' if [''x''] does not appear in ''t'', and a term with no free variables is a closed term. Terms can be typed with pregroup types in the obvious manner.

The usual conventions regarding α conversion apply.

For a given language, we give an assignment ''I'' that maps typed words to typed closed terms in a way that respects the pregroup structure of the types. For the English fragment given above we might therefore have the following assignment (with the obvious, implicit set of atomic terms and function symbols):

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
I(John : N) &amp;= j : E
\\
I(Mary : N) &amp;= m : E
\\
I(the : N \cdot N_0^l) &amp;= \iota(p) \cdot [p] : E \cdot E_0^l
\\
I(dog : N_0) &amp;= dog : E_0
\\
I(cat : N_0) &amp;= cat : E_0
\\
I(met : N^r \cdot S \cdot N^l) &amp;= [x] \cdot met(x,y) \cdot [y] : E^r \cdot T \cdot E^l
\\
I(barked : N^r \cdot S) &amp;= [x] \cdot barked(x) : E^r \cdot T
\\
I(at : S^r \cdot N^{rr} \cdot N^r \cdot S \cdot N^l) &amp;= [x] \cdot y \cdot [y] \cdot at(x,z) \cdot [z] : T^r \cdot E^{rr} \cdot E^r \cdot T \cdot E^l
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''E'' is the type of entities in the domain, and ''T'' is the type of truth values.

Together with this core definition of the semantics of PG, we also have a reduction rules that are employed in parallel with the type reductions. Placing the syntactic types at the top and semantics below, we have

[[File:PregroupGrammar-LeftAdjointReduction.png|center|frameless|upright=1.5]]

[[File:PregroupGrammar-RightAdjointReduction.png|center|frameless|upright=1.5]]

For example, applying this to the types and semantics for the sentence &lt;math&gt;\text{John met Mary} : N \cdot (N^r \cdot S \cdot N^l) \cdot N&lt;/math&gt; (emphasizing the link being reduced)

[[File:SemanticCalculation-JohnMetMary.png|center|frameless|upright=1.25]]

For the sentence &lt;math&gt;\text{the dog barked at the cat} : (N \cdot N_0^l) \cdot N_0 \cdot (N^r \cdot S) \cdot (S^r \cdot N^{rr} \cdot N^r \cdot S \cdot N^l) \cdot (N \cdot N_0^l) \cdot N_0&lt;/math&gt;:

'''Recitative''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|r|ɛ|s|ɪ|t|ə|ˈ|t|iː|v}}, also known by its Italian name "''recitativo''" ({{IPA-it|retʃitaˈtiːvo|}})) is a style of delivery (much used in [[opera]]s, [[oratorio]]s, and [[cantata]]s) in which a singer is allowed to adopt the rhythms of ordinary speech. Recitative does not repeat lines as formally composed songs do. It resembles sung ordinary speech more than a formal musical composition.

Recitative can be distinguished on a continuum from more speech-like to more musical, with more sustained melodic lines. The mostly syllabic '''''recitativo secco''''' ("dry", accompanied only by [[Basso continuo|continuo]]) is at one end of a spectrum through '''''recitativo accompagnato''''' (using orchestra), the more [[melisma]]tic [[arioso]], and finally the full-blown [[aria]] or ensemble, where the pulse is entirely governed by the music.

The term recitative (or occasionally liturgical recitative) is also applied to the simpler [[Reciting Θyy tone|formulas]] of [[Gregorian chant]], such as the tones used for the [[Epistle]], [[Gospel]], [[preface (liturgy)|preface]] and [[collect]]s; see [[accentus]].

==Origins==
The first use of recitative in [[opera]] was preceded by the [[monody|monodies]] of the [[Florentine Camerata]] in which [[Vincenzo Galilei]], father of the astronomer [[Galileo Galilei]], played an important role. The elder Galilei, influenced by his correspondence with [[Girolamo Mei]] on the writings of the ancient Greeks and with [[Erycius Puteanus]] on the writings of [[Hucbald]]&lt;ref&gt;Hope 1894, p. ??&lt;/ref&gt; and wishing to recreate the old manner of storytelling and drama, pioneered the use of a single melodic line to tell the story, accompanied by simple chords from a harpsichord or lute. 

In the [[baroque music|baroque]] era, recitatives were commonly rehearsed on their own by the stage director, the singers frequently supplying their own favourite [[insertion aria|baggage aria]]s which might be by a different composer (some of [[Mozart]]'s so-called concert arias fall into this category). This division of labour persisted in some of [[Rossini]]'s works; the ''secco'' recitatives for ''[[The Barber of Seville]]'' and ''[[La Cenerentola]]'' were composed by assistants.&lt;ref&gt;Gossett 2006, p. 249&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Secco'' ==
''Secco'' recitatives, popularized in Florence though the proto-opera music dramas of [[Jacopo Peri]] and [[Giulio Caccini]] during the late 16th century, formed the substance of [[Claudio Monteverdi]]'s operas during the 17th century, and continued to be used into the 19th century [[Romanticism (music)|Romantic era]] by such composers as [[Gaetano Donizetti]], reappearing in Stravinsky's ''[[The Rake's Progress]]''. They also influenced areas of music outside opera from the outset; the recitatives of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], found in his passions and [[cantata]]s, are especially notable.

In the early operas and cantatas of the Florentine school, secco recitatives were accompanied by a variety of instruments, mostly plucked fretted strings including the [[chitarrone]], often with a [[pipe organ]] to provide sustained tone. Later, in the operas of [[Vivaldi]] and [[Händel]], the accompaniment was standardised as a [[harpsichord]] and a bass [[viol]] or [[violoncello]]. When the harpsichord was gradually phased out over the late 18th century, and mostly disappeared in the early 19th century, many opera-houses did not replace it with the [[fortepiano]], a hammered-string keyboard invented in 1700. 

Instead the violoncello was left to carry on alone or with reinforcement from a [[double bass]]. A 1919 recording of [[Rossini]]'s ''[[Barber of Seville]]'', issued by Italian [[HMV]], gives a unique glimpse of this technique in action, as do [[cello]] methods of the period and some scores of [[Meyerbeer]]. There are examples of the revival of the harpsichord for this purpose as early as the 1890s (e.g. by [[Hans Richter (conductor)|Hans Richter]] for a production of [[Mozart]]'s ''[[Don Giovanni]]'' at the London [[Royal Opera House]], the instrument being supplied by [[Arnold Dolmetsch]]), but it was not until the 1950s that the 18th-century method was consistently observed once more. In the 2010s, the early music revival movement has led to the re-introduction of harpsichord in some Baroque performances.

{{anchor|Accompagnato}}

==''Accompagnato'' (or ''obbligato'')==
Accompanied recitative, known as ''accompagnato'' or ''stromentato'', employs the [[orchestra]] as an accompanying body. As a result, it is less improvisational and declamatory than ''recitativo secco'', and more [[song]]-like. This form is often employed where the orchestra can underscore a particularly dramatic text, as in ''[[Messiah Part I#5|Thus saith the Lord]]'' from Händel's ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]''; [[Joseph Haydn]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] were also fond of it. A more inward intensification calls for an [[arioso]]; the opening of ''[[Messiah Part I#2|Comfort ye]]'' from the same work is a famous example, while the ending of it ("The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness") is secco.

Sometimes a distinction is made between the more dramatic, expressive, or interjecting 'orchestral recitative' (''recitativo obbligato'' or ''stromentato'') and a more passive and sustained 'accompanied recitative' (''recitativo accompagnato'').&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=Orchestral recitative|author=|access-date=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-Wagner uses==
Later operas, under the influence of [[Richard Wagner]], favored [[through-composition]], where recitatives, arias, choruses and other elements were seamlessly interwoven into a whole. Many of Wagner's operas employ sections which are analogous to accompanied recitative.

Recitative is also occasionally used in [[musicals]], being put to ironic use in the finale of [[Kurt Weill]]'s ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]''. It also appears in ''[[Carousel (musical)|Carousel]]'' and ''[[Of Thee I Sing]]''.

[[George Gershwin]] used it in his opera ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'', though sometimes the recitative in that work is changed to spoken dialogue. ''Porgy and Bess'' has also been staged as a musical rather than as an opera.

==Instrumental recitative==
Recitative has also sometimes been used to refer to parts of purely instrumental works which resemble vocal recitatives. One of the earliest examples is found in the slow movement of [[Vivaldi]]'s violin concerto in D, RV 208 which is marked 'Recitative', although it is perhaps more virtuosic and flashy than most operatic recitative. [[C. P. E. Bach]] included instrumental recitative in his "Prussian" piano sonatas of 1742, composed at [[Frederick the Great]]'s court in Berlin. In 1761, [[Joseph Haydn]] took his post at [[Esterhazy Palace]] and soon after composed his Symphony No. 7 ("Le Midi") in concertante style (i.e. with soloists). In the second movement of that work, the violinist is the soloist in an instrumental recitative.

[[Ludwig van Beethoven]] used the instrumental recitative in at least three works, including ''[[Piano Sonata No. 17 (Beethoven)|Piano Sonata No. 17]]'' (''The Tempest''), ''[[Piano Sonata No. 31 (Beethoven)|Piano Sonata No. 31]]'', and perhaps most famously in the opening section of the Finale of his [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]]. Here, Beethoven inscribed on the score (in French) "In the manner of a recitative, but in tempo." Leon Plantinga argues that the second movement of Beethoven's [[Piano Concerto No. 4 (Beethoven)|Fourth Piano Concerto]] is also an instrumental recitative,&lt;ref&gt;Plantinga 1996, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; although Owen Jander interprets it as a dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;Jander 1985, pp. 195–212&lt;/ref&gt;

Other [[Romantic music|Romantic]] composers to employ instrumental recitative include [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]] (who composed a lyrical, virtuosic recitative for solo violin with [[harp]] accompaniment to represent the [[Scheherazade|title character]] in his orchestral ''[[Scheherazade (Rimsky-Korsakov)|Scheherazade]]'') and [[Hector Berlioz]] (whose [[choral symphony]] ''[[Roméo et Juliette (Berlioz)|Roméo et Juliette]]'' contains a [[trombone]] recitative as part of its Introduction).

[[Arnold Schoenberg]] labeled the last of his [[Five Pieces for Orchestra]], Op. 16, as "''Das obligate Rezitativ''" (English: "The [[obbligato]] recitative"), and also composed a piece for [[Organ (music)|organ]], ''Variations on a Recitative'', Op. 40. Other examples of instrumental recitative in twentieth century music include the third movement of [[Douglas Moore]]'s [[Quintet for clarinet and strings (Moore)|Quintet for Clarinet and Strings]] (1946), the first of [[Richard Rodney Bennett]]'s ''Five [[Impromptu]]s'' for [[guitar]] (1968), the opening section of the last movement of [[Benjamin Britten]]'s [[String Quartet No. 3 (Britten)|String Quartet No. 3]] (1975), and the second of [[William Bolcom]]'s ''12 New Etudes for Piano'' (1977–86).

[[File:Flippin House siding detail - Clatskanie Oregon.jpg|thumb|Highly decorative wood-shingle siding on a house in Clatskanie, [[Oregon]], U.S.A.]]
'''Siding''' or '''wall cladding''' is the protective material attached to the exterior side of a [[wall]] of a [[house]] or other building. Along with the roof, it forms the first line of defense against the elements, most importantly sun, rain/snow, heat and cold, thus creating a stable, more comfortable environment on the interior side.  The siding material and style also can enhance or detract from the building's beauty. There is a wide and expanding variety of materials to side with, both natural and artificial, each with its own benefits and drawbacks. Masonry walls as such do not require siding, but any wall can be sided. Walls that are internally framed, whether with wood, or steel I-beams, however, must always be sided.

Most siding consists of pieces of weather-resistant material that are smaller than the wall they cover, to allow for expansion and contraction of the materials due to moisture and temperature changes. There are various styles of joining the pieces, from board and batton, where the butt joints between panels is covered with a thin strip (usually 1 to 2 inches wide) of wood, to a variety of clapboard, also called lap siding, in which planks are laid horizontally across the wall starting from the bottom, and building up, the board below overlapped by the board above it. These techniques of joinery are designed to prevent water from entering the walls. Siding that does not consist of pieces joined together would include stucco, which is widely used in the Southwest. It is a plaster-like siding and is applied over a lattice, just like plaster. However, because of the lack of joints, it eventually cracks and is susceptible to water damage. ''[[Rainscreen]]'' construction is used to improve siding's ability to keep walls dry.

==Thatch siding==
[[File:Kimpoys.jpg|thumb|Thatched gable wall in the [[Philippines]]]]
[[Thatch]] is an ancient and very widespread building material used on roofs and walls. Thatch siding is made with dry vegetation such as longstraw, water reeds, or combed wheat reed. The materials are overlapped and weaved in patterns designed to deflect and direct water.

==Wood siding==
Wood siding is very versatile in style and can be used on a wide variety of building structures. It can be painted or stained in any color palette desired.

Though installation and repair is relatively simple, wood siding requires more maintenance than other popular solutions, requiring [[Wood preservation|treatment]] every four to nine years depending on the severity of the elements to which it is exposed. Ants and termites are a threat to many types of wood siding, such that extra treatment and maintenance that can significantly increase the cost in some pest-infested areas.

Wood is a moderately renewable resource and is biodegradable. However, most paints and stains used to treat wood are not environmentally friendly and can be toxic. Wood siding can provide some minor insulation and structural properties as compared to thinner cladding materials.

===Shingles===
[[File:Bardeaux-deramond-barre.JPG|thumb|Ordinary wood shingle siding in [[France]].]]
[[Wood shingle]]s or irregular cedar "[[Shake (roof)|shake]]" siding was used in early [[New England]] construction, and was revived in [[Shingle Style]] and [[Queen Anne style architecture in the United States|Queen Anne style architecture]] in the late 19th century.

Wood siding in overlapping horizontal rows or "courses" is called [[clapboard (architecture)|clapboard]], [[weatherboard]] (British English), or bevel siding which is made with beveled boards, thin at the top edge and thick at the butt.

In colonial North America, [[Eastern white pine]] was the most common material. Wood siding can also be made of naturally rot-resistant woods such as [[Sequoia sempervirens|redwood]] or [[Cedar wood|cedar]].

===Drop siding===
[[File:Types bardages.jpg|thumb|Variations on horizontal, wooden siding.]]
Jointed horizontal siding (also called "drop" siding or novelty siding) may be [[shiplap]]ped or [[tongue and groove]]d (though less common). Drop siding comes in a wide variety of face finishes, including Dutch Lap (also called German or Cove Lap) and log siding (milled with curve).

===Vertical boards===
[[File:Stabbur trenagler detalj.JPG|thumb|An ancient example of board and batten siding on a type of storage building in [[Norway]] called a stabbur.]]
Vertical siding may have a cover over the joint: '''board and [[batten]]''', popular in American wooden [[Carpenter Gothic]] houses; or less commonly behind the joint called ''batten and board'' or ''reversed board and batten''.

===Wooden sheet siding===
[[Plywood]] sheet siding is sometimes used on inexpensive buildings, sometimes with grooves to imitate vertical [[shiplap]] siding. One example of such grooved plywood siding is the type called Texture 1-11 ''T1-11'' or ''T111'' ("tee-one-eleven"). There is also a product known as reverse board-and-batten ''RBB'' that looks similar but has deeper grooves. Some of these products may be thick enough and rated for structural applications if properly fastened to studs. Both T-11 and RBB sheets are quick and easy to install as long as they are installed with compatible flashing at butt joints.

==Stone siding==

[[File:Parement de lauze Lannion Bretagne.JPG|thumb|[[Flagstone]] wall shingles]]
Slate shingles may be simple in form but many buildings with slate siding are highly decorative.

==Plastic siding==

Wood clapboard is often imitated using [[vinyl siding]] or [[Polyvinyl chloride#Unplasticized Polyvinyl Chloride (uPVC)|uPVC]] [[weatherboarding]].  It is usually produced in units twice as high as clapboard.  Plastic imitations of wood shingle and wood shakes also exist.

Since plastic siding is a manufactured product, it may come in unlimited color choices and styles. Historically vinyl sidings would fade, crack and buckle over time, requiring the siding to be replaced. However, newer vinyl options have improved and resist damage and wear better. Vinyl siding is sensitive to direct heat from grills, barbecues or other sources. Unlike wood, vinyl siding does not provide additional insulation for the building, unless an insulation material (e.g., foam) has been added to the product. It has also been criticized by some fire safety experts for its heat sensitivity. This sensitivity makes it easier for a house fire to jump to neighboring houses in comparison to materials such as brick, metal or masonry.

Vinyl siding has a potential environmental cost.  While vinyl siding can be recycled, it cannot be burned (due to toxic dioxin gases that would be released).  If dumped in a landfill, plastic siding does not break down quickly.

Vinyl siding is also considered one of the more unattractive siding choices by many. Although newer options and proper installation can eliminate this complaint, vinyl siding often has visible seam lines between panels and generally do not have the quality appearance of wood, brick, or masonry. The fading and cracking of older types of plastic siding compound this issue. In many areas of newer housing development, particularly in North America, entire neighbourhoods are often built with all houses clad in vinyl siding, given an unappealing uniformity. Some cities now campaign for house developers to incorporate varied types of siding during construction.

==Imitation brick or stone–asphalt siding==
[[File:Walnut Street South 754 in Bloomington.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A house with imitation brick siding]]
[[File:Insulbrick dangling.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Imitation brick siding installed over wooden siding]]

A predecessor to modern maintenance free sidings was asphalt brick siding. Asphalt impregnated panels (about 2 feet by 4 feet) gave the appearance of brick or even stone. Many buildings have this siding, especially old sheds and garages. If the panels are straight and level and not damaged, the only indication that they are not real brick may be seen at the corner caps.  Trademarked names included Insulbrick, Insulstone, Insulwood.  Commonly used names now are faux brick, lick it and stick it brick, and ghetto brick. Often such siding is now covered over with newer metal or plastic siding. Today thin panels of real brick are manufactured for veneer or siding.

==Insulated siding==
[[Insulated siding]] has emerged as a new siding category in recent years. Considered an improvement over [[vinyl siding]], insulated siding is custom fit with expanded [[polystyrene]] foam (EPS) that is fused to the back of the siding, which fills the gap between the home and the siding.

Products provide environmental advantages by reducing energy use by up to 20 percent. On average, insulated siding products have an [[R-value (insulation)|R-value]] of 3.96, triple that of other exterior cladding materials. Insulated siding products are typically [[Energy Star]] qualified, engineered in compliance with environmental standards set by the [[U.S. Department of Energy]] and the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]].

In addition to reducing energy consumption, insulated siding is a durable exterior product, designed to last more than 50 years, according to manufacturers. The foam provides rigidity for a more ding- and wind-resistant siding, maintaining a quality look for the life of the products. The foam backing also creates straighter lines when hung, providing a look more like that of wood siding, while remaining low maintenance.

Manufacturers report that insulated siding is permeable or "breathable", allowing water vapor to escape, which can protect against rot, mold and mildew, and help maintain healthy indoor air quality.

==Metal Siding==
[[Image:LightningVolt Corrugated Steel Siding.jpg|thumb|left|Corrugated [[steel]] siding, for the side of a [[barn (building)|barn]].]]
{{see also|Copper cladding}}

Metal siding comes in a variety of metals, styles, and colors. It is most often associated with modern, industrial, and retro buildings. Utilitarian buildings often use corrugated [[galvanized steel]] sheet siding or cladding, which often has a coloured vinyl finish. Corrugated [[aluminium]] cladding is also common where a more durable finish is required, while also being lightweight for easy shaping and installing making it a popular metal siding choice.

Formerly, imitation wood clapboard was made of aluminium (aluminium siding). That role is typically played by vinyl siding today. Aluminium siding is ideal for homes in coastal areas (with lots of moisture and salt), since aluminium reacts with air to form aluminium oxide, an extremely hard coating that seals the aluminium surface from further degradation. In contrast, steel forms [[rust]], which can weaken the structure of the material, and corrosion-resistant coatings for steel, such as zinc, sometimes fail around the edges as years pass. However, an advantage of steel siding can be its dent-resistance, which is excellent for regions with severe storms—especially if the area is prone to [[hail]].

The first architectural application of aluminium was the mounting of a small grounding cap on the [[Washington Monument]] in 1884. Sheet-iron or steel clapboard siding units had been patented in 1903, and Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company had been offering embossed steel siding in stone and brick patterns in their catalogues for several years by the 1930s. ALCOA began promoting the use of aluminium in architecture by the 1920s when it produced ornamental spandrel panels for the [[Cathedral of Learning]] and the Chrysler and Empire State Buildings in New York. The exterior of the A.O. Smith Corporation Building in Milwaukee was clad entirely in aluminium by 1930, and 3'-square siding panels of Duralumin sheet from ALCOA sheathed an experimental exhibit house for the Architectural League of New York in 1931. Most architectural applications of aluminium in the 1930s were on a monumental scale, and it would be another six years before it was put to use on residential construction.

In the first few years after World War II, manufacturers began developing and widely distributing aluminium siding. Among them Indiana businessman Frank Hoess was credited with the invention of the configuration seen on modern aluminium siding. His experiments began in 1937 with steel siding in imitation of wooden clapboards. Other types of sheet metal and steel siding on the market at the time presented problems with warping, creating openings through which water could enter, introducing rust. Hoess remedied this problem through the use of a locking joint, which was formed by small flap at the top of each panel that joined with a U-shaped flange on the lower edge of the previous panel thus forming a watertight horizontal seam. After he had received a patent for his siding in 1939, Hoess produced a small housing development of about forty-four houses covered in his clapboard-style steel siding for blue-collar workers in Chicago. His operations were curtailed when war plants commandeered the industry. In 1946 Hoess allied with Metal Building Products of Detroit, a corporation that promoted and sold Hoess siding of ALCOA aluminium. Their product was used on large housing projects in the northeast and was purportedly the siding of choice for a 1947 Pennsylvania development, the first subdivision to solely use aluminium siding. Products such as 4", 6", 8" and 10" X 12' unpainted aluminium panels, starter strips, corner pieces and specialized application clips were assembled in the Indiana shop of the Hoess brothers. Siding could be applied over conventional wooden clapboards, or it could be nailed to studs via special clips affixed to the top of each panel. Insulation was placed between each stud. While the Hoess Brothers company continued to function for about twelve more years after the dissolution of the Metal Building Products Corporation in 1948, they were not as successful as rising siding companies like Reynolds Metals.&lt;ref&gt;"Architectural Aluminum", Arkansas Historic Preservation Program&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;("Hoess Aluminum Siding and Roofing", American Builder, October 1946)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Masonry siding ==
{{main|Stone cladding}}
[[Stone veneer|Stone]] and [[masonry veneer]] is sometimes considered ''siding'', are varied and can accommodate a variety of styles—from formal to rustic. Though masonry can be painted or tinted to match many color palettes, it is most suited to neutral earth tones, and coatings such as [[Roughcast|roughcast and pebbeldash]]. Masonry has excellent durability (over 100 years), and minimal maintenance is required. The primary drawback to masonry siding is the initial cost.

Precipitation can threaten the structure of buildings, so it is important that the siding will be able to withstand the weather conditions in the local region. For regions that receive a lot of rain, [[exterior insulation finishing system]]s (EIFS) have been known to suffer underlying wood rot problems with excessive moisture exposure.

The environmental impact of masonry depends on the type of material used. In general, concrete and concrete based materials are intensive energy materials to produce. However, the long durability and minimal maintenance of masonry sidings mean that less energy is required over the life of the siding.

==Composite siding==
[[File:U.S. Army 1st Sgt. Benton Gil measures the length of a house before installing its sidings while volunteering for the Habitat for Humanity at Edinburgh, Ind., Aug 110812-A-VC802-003.jpg|thumb|Composite siding in clapboard form being installed.]]
Various composite materials are also used for siding: [[asphalt shingle]]s, [[Asbestos#Modern usage|asbestos]], [[fiber cement siding|fiber cement]], [[Aluminium#Applications|aluminium]] (ACM), [[fiberboard]], [[hardboard]], ''etc.'' They may be in the form of shingles or boards, in which case they are sometimes called [[Clapboard (architecture)|clapboard]].

Composite sidings are available in many styles and can mimic the other siding options. Composite materials are ideal for achieving a certain style or 'look' that may not be suited to the local environment (e.g., corrugated aluminium siding in an area prone to severe storms; steel in coastal climates; wood siding in termite-infested regions).

Costs of composites tend to be lower than wood options, but vary widely as do installation, maintenance and repair requirements. Not surprisingly, the durability and environmental impact of composite sidings depends on the specific materials used in the manufacturing process.

[[Fiber cement siding]] is a class of composite siding that is usually made from a combination of cement, cellulose (wood), sand, and water.  They are either coated or painted in the factory or installed and then painted after installation. Fiber cement is popular for its realistic look, durability, low-maintenance properties, and fire resistance.  Composite siding products containing cellulose (wood fibers) have been shown to have problems with deterioration, delamination, or loss of coating adhesion in certain climates or under certain environmental conditions.

A younger class of non-wood synthetic siding has sprouted in the past 15 years. These products are usually made from a combination of non-wood materials such as polymeric resins, fiberglass, stone, sand, and fly ash and are chosen for their durability, curb appeal, and ease of maintenance. Given the newness of such technologies, product lifespan can only be estimated, varieties are limited, and distribution is sporadic.

'''Vasant Ranchhod Gowarikar''' (25 March 1933&amp;nbsp;– 2 January 2015) was an Indian scientist. He was the chief of [[Indian Space Research Organization]] and also the scientific advisor to the Prime Minister of India in 1991–1993. Gowarikar made valuable contributions to the fields of space research, weather and population. He was well known for his monsoon forecast model as he was the first scientist to develop an indigenous weather forecasting model that predicted the monsoon correctly.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.manase.org/en/maharashtra.php?mid=68&amp;smid=23&amp;pmid=6&amp;id=845 Vasant Gowarikar]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ZeeObit /&gt;

==Early life==
Gowarikar was born in [[Pune]], India on 25 March 1933 in Maharashtrian family. After his schooling and graduation from [[Kolhapur]] district in Western Maharashtra, he embarked on his scientific odyssey to [[England]] in the early 1950s. He obtained his M.Sc. and Ph.D. in chemical engineering, supervised by F. H. Garner. His collaboration resulted in the Garner-Gowarikar theory, which was a novel analysis of heat and mass transfer between solids and fluid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/former-isro-chief-vasant-gowarikar-passes-away/article6749083.ece Vasant Gowarikar]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
He had worked with the [[Indian Space Research Organisation]]. Gowarikar was involved in space research in early career under [[Vikram Sarabhai]] when his office was in the building of the local St Mary Magdalene Church in [[Thumba]] in [[Kerala]]. He pioneered solid propellant development and later served as Director of the [[Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre]] (VSSC) between 1979 and 1985.

Gowarikar also served as the scientific advisor to [[Prime Minister of India]] [[P.V. Narasimha Rao]] from 1991 to 1993. He had also been the Secretary of Department of Science and Technology.

He was appointed as Vice-Chancellor, [[Pune University]] and was chairman of the Marathi Vidnyan Parishad between 1994 and 2000. Gowarikar, along with his associates, also compiled ''The Fertilizer Encyclopedia'' (2008) that featured 4,500 entries detailing the chemical composition of fertilizers, and containing information on everything from their manufacturing and application to their economic and environmental considerations.

==Awards==
Gowarikar was awarded [[Padma Shri]] in 1984 and [[Padma Bhushan]] in 2008.&lt;ref name="Padma Awards"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/LST-PDAWD-2013.pdf | title=Padma Awards | publisher=Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India | date=2015 | accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also received the Fie Foundation Award.&lt;ref name=ZeeObit /&gt;

==Death==
Gowarikar died on 2 January 2015 at Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital, Pune, India following [[dengue]] and urinary tract infections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/former-isro-chief-vasant-gowarikar-passes-away/article6749083.ece Scientist Vasant Gowarikar passes away]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ZeeObit&gt;{{cite news | url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/sci-tech/former-isro-chief-v-r-gowarikar-dies-in-pune_1523955.html | title=Former ISRO chief VR Gowarikar dies in Pune | date=3 January 2015 | publisher=Zee News | accessdate=29 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/scientist-vasant-gowarikar-no-more-115010200837_1.html Scientist Vasant Gowarikar no more]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9045">[[Image:Wadcuttercomp.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[.32 ACP]] [[Full metal jacket bullet|full metal jacket]], [[.32 S&amp;W Long]] wadcutter, [[.380 ACP]] jacketed [[hollow point]] (L-R)]]
A '''wadcutter''' is a special-purpose flat-fronted [[bullet]] specifically designed for shooting paper targets, usually at close range and at subsonic velocities typically under approximately 900&amp;nbsp;ft/s (274&amp;nbsp;m/s).  Wadcutters have also found favor for use in self-defense guns, such as [[.38 caliber]] [[snubnosed revolver]]s, where, due to short barrel lengths, maximum bullet velocities are usually low, typically under 900&amp;nbsp;ft/s (274&amp;nbsp;m/s), and improved lethality is desired. Wadcutters are often used in [[handgun]] and [[airgun]] competitions.

==Bullet profile==
[[Image:38 special wadcutter.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[.38 Special]] wadcutters loaded [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridges]], 148 grain [[Hollow-base bullet|hollow-base]] wadcutter bullet and target showing the clean round holes.]]
A wadcutter has a flat or nearly flat front that is typically as wide as the caliber size or only slightly smaller in diameter than caliber size. For target shooting, a wadcutter cuts a very clean hole through the paper target, making it easier to score and ideally reducing errors in scoring the target in the favor of the shooter.&lt;ref name="M.D.1998"&gt;{{cite book|last=M.D.|first=Vincent J.M. DiMaio,|title=Gunshot Wounds: Practical Aspects of Firearms, Ballistics, and Forensic Techniques, SECOND EDITION|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VbrDbbHAflsC&amp;pg=PA26|date=30 December 1998|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4200-4837-7|pages=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the flat nosed bullet is not well suited for feeding out of a magazine, wadcutters are normally used only in [[revolver]]s or in specially designed [[Semi-automatic self-loading pistol|semi-automatic pistol]]s, although this is not always the case as some wadcutters may have rounded bullet nose profiles.

==Types of firearm wadcutters==
[[Image:Keith-Style-45-SWC.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Keith-Style SWC with one crimping groove and one filled lubrication groove. In practice, the bullet can be crimped over the leading band, or on the crimping groove, as desired.]]A variety of wadcutter types exist: HBWC (Hollow Base Wadcutter), DEWC (Double-ended wadcutters), BBWC (Beveled-Base Wadcutters), and [[Semiwadcutter|SWC (Semi-Wadcutters)]].&lt;ref name="Cunningham2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cunningham|first=Grant|title=Gun Digest’s Handgun Ammo &amp; Calibers Concealed Carry eShort: Learn the most effective handgun calibers &amp; pistol ammo choices for the self-defense revolver.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NTuthGS3MwQC&amp;pg=PT20|date=1 July 2012|publisher=Gun Digest Books|location=Iola, wisconsin|isbn=1-4402-3392-6|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; HBWC rounds are best used at only the lowest velocities, as by being hollow at the rear end, they can split under heavy loads. DEWC rounds are best suited for automatic press reloading uses, as they may be used when loaded with either end pointed forward. BBWC have been developed to permit easier bullet insertion into the case when reloading.  SWC rounds were developed to permit them to be loaded in either semi-automatic pistols or revolvers, where the rounded bullet shape often works better with feed ramps on semi-automatic pistols, and they are often used for heavy loads intended either for hunting or for self-defense. Some SWC bullet designs have a smaller diameter rear end, making these bullets suitable for use with [[gas check]]s. Properly lubricated SWC bullets with gas checks are suitable for use at velocities exceeding 1700&amp;nbsp;ft/s (518&amp;nbsp;m/s), the gas check reducing leading within the bore.

===Accuracy===
The maximum accurate distance of wadcutters varies considerably with the shape of the front of the bullet. Full caliber diameter wadcutters are suitable for use only at short ranges, typically not being used at ranges exceeding 25 yards where accuracy is especially desirable. At distances beyond 50 yards, full caliber diameter wadcutters become highly inaccurate.  On the other hand, SWC bullets can maintain high accuracy at ranges exceeding 100 yards. In general, semi-wadcutters having a partially rounded nose are more accurate than wadcutters having a flat-front profile. In contrast, flat-front profile wadcutters tend to have improved lethality for hunting or self-defense purposes.&lt;ref name="Cunningham2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cunningham|first=Grant|title=Gun Digest Book of the Revolver|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kyGBsbcZEl0C&amp;pg=PA53|date=13 October 2011|publisher=Krause Publications|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=1-4402-1816-1|pages=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lubrication and bullet crimping===
All lead wadcutters require proper lubrication to prevent leading of rifling and forcing cones when used in firearms.  With proper lubrication, no leading for solid lead wadcutters occurs until velocities exceed approximately 940&amp;nbsp;ft/s.  Without proper lubrication, however, severe leading can occur quickly, in as few as a couple of rounds. Most DEWC, BBWC, HBWC, and SWC bullets have 1, 2, or 3 lubrication grooves, with or without an additional 1 or 2 crimping grooves. (Having two crimping grooves is sometimes seen in dual-use bullets, such as intended for use with both .38 Special and .357 Magnum cartridges, or, similarly, for use with both .44 Special and .44 Magnum, in instances where overall cartridge lengths may need to be set differently so as to achieve the highest accuracy.) Used in revolvers, wadcutters must be roll crimped.  Used in semi-automatic pistols, wadcutters must be taper crimped. Used in single-shot firearms (e.g., Thompson Center Contender or Encore), no crimping is absolutely required, but higher velocities may be achieved with either a roll or taper crimp, depending on cartridge, to permit pressure to rise higher before the bullet is released from the brass case.

===Indoor wadcutters===
Wadcutter bullets for center-fire firearms often have a modified profile with a reduced-diameter central point or rounded section. This was developed to allow the use of wadcutter bullets without causing excessive damage to the rubber anti-splashback curtain on indoor ranges. This profile produces a clean cut without tearing of the paper on the paper target for scoring but will only partially deform a rubber curtain and rebound before penetrating enough to cut the surface of the rubber mat.

===Bullet loading techniques===
Wadcutters can be loaded flush with the brass case opening or they may be set to extend out of the brass case, depending on what provides the most accuracy; the desired powder capacity of the case; or other desired criteria. Both varieties of wadcutters (flush, or non-flush) are commercially available. Although primarily intended for target practice, wadcutters can be used for close-in self-defense and hunting because their sharp edges and close-range accuracy are claimed to increase lethality.&lt;ref name="Taffin2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Taffin|first=John|authorlink=John Taffin|title=Single Action Sixguns|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HzW3nn6LTycC&amp;pg=PA57|date=12 October 2005|publisher=Krause Publications|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=0-87349-953-0|pages=57–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leading effects==
Wadcutters are typically made from lead. Deposition of lead into the [[rifling]] grooves of barrels and into the forcing cones of revolvers limits the maximum usable velocity of wadcutters to less than about 900&amp;nbsp;ft/s. Shots fired at higher velocities may cause severe leading of the rifling and of the forcing cone, introducing a potentially dangerous condition from overpressure if [[Full metal jacket bullet|FMJ]] (Full Metal Jacket) bullets are subsequently fired without first removing the lead buildup.  Either a mechanical lead removing tool (i.e., a Lewis Lead Remover or a generic equivalent) and/or chemical removal techniques may be used to remove the lead build-up caused from shooting wadcutters at too high a velocity.&lt;ref name="Cunningham2011"/&gt;

==Air rifle and pistol wadcutters==
[[Image:4.5 mm (.177 in) match air gun pellet.jpg|thumb|right|A typical 4.5 mm (.177 in) match diabolo air gun pellet, in the HBWC (Hollow Base Wadcutter) configuration]]
Target airguns used for [[10 metre air rifle]] and [[10 metre air pistol]] competitions generally shoot wadcutter [[pellet (air gun)|pellets]] at muzzle velocities around {{convert|570|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}. The use of wadcutter match diabolo pellets is nearly universal in airgun target shooting where paper targets are used, at distances of 25 meters or less.&lt;ref name="Carmichel1986"&gt;{{cite book|last=Carmichel|first=Jim|title=Guns and Shooting, 1986|year=1986|publisher=Times Mirror Magazines, Incorporated, Book Division|isbn=978-0-943822-58-7|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Windtalkers''''' is a 2002 American [[war film]] directed and produced by [[John Woo]], and starring [[Nicolas Cage]] and [[Adam Beach]]. The film was released in the United States on June 14, 2002.

==Plot==
During [[World War II]], USMC Cpl Joseph F. "Joe" Enders returns to active duty with the aid of his pharmacist, Rita, having previously survived a gruesome [[Solomon Islands campaign|battle on the Solomon Islands against the Imperial Japanese Army]] that killed his entire squad and left him almost deaf in his left ear. Enders' new assignment is to protect [[Navajo people|Navajo]] [[code talker]] Pvt. Ben Yahzee, and carries a promotion for Enders to Sergeant. Sgt. Pete "Ox" Henderson also receives a parallel assignment protecting Navajo code talker Pvt. Charlie Whitehorse.

Yahzee and Whitehorse, lifelong friends from the same Navajo tribe, are trained to send and receive coded messages that direct [[Fire support|artillery fire]]. Enders and Henderson are instructed to kill their code talkers if capture is imminent so that the code cannot fall into enemy hands. As Enders and Henderson meet Yahzee and Whitehorse, it becomes apparent that the two experienced Marines are less than happy to be babysitting their Navajo codetalkers, and the Navajos must also endure racial harassment by some of the white Marines, notably Private Chick.  During their missions, however, Henderson and Whitehorse discover a mutual love of music. Enders and Yahzee also discover that they have much in common, notably their Catholic upbringings.

The [[battle of Saipan|invasion of Saipan]] becomes Yahzee's and Whitehorse's first combat experience. After the [[beachhead]] is secured, the Marines come under [[friendly fire]] from U.S. artillery. Yahzee's radio is destroyed and the convoy is unable to call off the bombardment. Yahzee suggests that he disguise himself as a Japanese soldier and slip behind enemy lines to commandeer a radio, with Enders as his prisoner. Yahzee is forced to kill for the first time before he can redirect U.S. artillery fire onto the Japanese position. For their bravery, Enders is awarded a Silver Star by the commanding officer, with Yahzee's role almost ignored until Enders points him out but still credits Enders. Later, after a night of sake drinking, Yahzee performs Navajo rituals over the unconscious Enders to protect him with the spirits.

That night, the Marines camp in the nearby village of Tanapag. While Yahzee is temporarily assigned back to the command post to translate a code, Enders becomes increasingly torn because he cannot imagine killing Yahzee, despite his orders. He demands to be relieved from his unit but his request is denied. The next morning, Japanese soldiers ambush the village. Henderson is killed and Whitehorse is about to be captured. Enders sees Whitehorse being beaten and dragged away by the Japanese. Enders, realizing the Japanese will torture him for the code, throws a grenade at Whitehorse, killing him and his captors.

Yahzee returns to Tanapag and, seeing Whitehorse's body, screams at Enders to explain what happened as the village was thought to be secured. Enders, exhausted, mutters that he killed Whitehorse, but does not reveal that Whitehorse was willing to die to protect the code. Outraged, Yahzee aims his weapon at Enders but cannot bring himself to kill him. Enders confesses that he hated having to kill Whitehorse and that, like Henderson, his mission was to protect the code above all else.

The Marines are mobilized on another mission and are once again ambushed, this time near a deadly minefield on [[Mt. Tapochau]], during which many Marines are killed. Enders, Yahzee, Chick, and Cpl. Pappas (the last of the Marines) take cover on a ridge, and see Japanese artillery fire from the top of the ridge attacking a Marine convoy below their position. Still enraged over the death of Whitehorse, Yahzee charges the Japanese line fearlessly, and in doing so, fumbles the radio needed to call in the coordinates for a bombardment. Yahzee and Enders are both shot as they retrieve the radio and call in an airstrike on the Japanese artillery. However, surrounded and knowing the Japanese will capture and torture him for the code as they almost did with Whitehorse, Yahzee entreats Enders to kill him. Enders, determined that no one else will die that day, manages to carry Yahzee to safety, albeit taking a shot in the chest. Friendly planes arrive and the Japanese position is successfully destroyed. Yahzee rejoices in their success but finds Enders mortally wounded.  With his last breaths, Enders reverts to the religious upbringing he earlier claimed he had abandoned, and recites a Hail Mary.

Returning to the U.S., Yahzee, his wife, and his son George Washington Yahzee, sit atop Point Mesa in [[Monument Valley]], Arizona, and, wearing the sacred necklaces and other Navajo ceremonial dress, performs the Navajo ritual of paying respects to Enders. He tells his son that Enders was a fierce warrior and Marine and, that if his son ever tells a story about Enders, to simply say that he was Yahzee's friend. He then cleans Enders' dog tags in holy water and lifts them to the sky while chanting in ritual.

An epilogue states that the Navajo code was crucial to America's success against Japan across the Pacific theater and that, during the war, the code was never broken.

==Production==
Filming locations on [[Hawaii]] included [[Kualoa Ranch]], the location where ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' and ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' were shot. To portray the Marines in the film the producers recruited extras that were volunteers from Schofield Barracks Army Base, Hickam Air Force Base, Pearl Harbor Naval Station, and Kaneohe Marine Corps Air Station. Some of the actual Marines from 4th Force Recon Company were used in the film portraying their actual job. Some violence was trimmed in order to avoid an NC-17 rating. This violence trim was restored for the Director's cut released on DVD running 134 minutes.

For the [[Grumman F6F Hellcat|F6F Hellcat]] fighters that appear in the beach-landing scenes on Saipan, the producers used computer-generated versions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kodak.com/US/plugins/acrobat/en/motion/newsletters/inCamera/oct2001/windtalkers.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907074010/http://www.kodak.com/US/plugins/acrobat/en/motion/newsletters/inCamera/oct2001/windtalkers.pdf |date=September 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==

===Box office===
The film was a [[box office bomb]], grossing only just under $41 million at the US box-office and a combined $77.6 million worldwide.&lt;ref name=mojo/&gt;

===Critical reception===
''Windtalkers'' received negative reviews from critics. The film currently holds a 32% approval rating from [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 167 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://au.rottentomatoes.com/m/windtalkers/ |title=Windtalkers |publisher=''[[Rotten Tomatoes]]'' |accessdate=May 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film two stars, remarking that "the filmmakers have buried it beneath battlefield cliches, while centering the story on a white character played by Nicolas Cage".&lt;ref name="Windtalkers"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20020614/REVIEWS/206140305/1023 |title=Windtalkers |author=Ebert, Roger |date=June 14, 2002 |publisher=''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' |accessdate=May 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was criticized for featuring the Navajo characters only in supporting roles; they were not the primary focus of the film. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.plume-noire.com/movies/reviews/windtalkers.html |title=Windtalkers |author=Thom, Fred |publisher=''Plume Noire'' |accessdate=May 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was ranked number four on Careeraftermilitary.com's "10 Most Inaccurate Military Movies Ever Made," which also included ''[[The Patriot (2000 film)|The Patriot]]'', ''[[The Hurt Locker]]'', ''[[U-571 (film)|U-571]]'', ''[[The Green Berets (film)|The Green Berets]]'', ''[[Pearl Harbor (film)|Pearl Harbor]]'', ''[[Battle of the Bulge (film)|Battle of the Bulge]]'', ''[[Red Tails]]'', ''[[Enemy at the Gates]]'' and ''[[Flyboys (film)|Flyboys]]'' on its list of falsified war movie productions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.careeraftermilitary.com/10-most-inaccurate-military-movies-ever-made/&lt;/ref&gt;
