The '''2013 Egyptian coup d'état''' took place on 3 July 2013. Egyptian army chief General [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi]] led a coalition to remove the President of Egypt, [[Mohamed Morsi]], from power and suspended the [[Egyptian Constitution of 2012|Egyptian constitution of 2012]]. The move came after the military's ultimatum for the government to "resolve its differences" with protesters during [[June 2013 Egyptian protests|widespread national protests]]. The military arrested Morsi and [[Muslim Brotherhood]] leaders,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Coup topples Egypt's Morsy; deposed president under 'house arrest'|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/07/03/world/meast/egypt-protests|first=Ben|last=Wedeman|work=CNN|date=4 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and declared Chief Justice of the [[Supreme Constitutional Court (Egypt)]] [[Adly Mansour]] as the interim president of Egypt. The announcement was followed by demonstrations and clashes between supporters and opponents of the move throughout Egypt.&lt;ref name=Hauslohner/&gt; The military's action was supported by the [[Grand Imam of al-Azhar|Grand Sheikh of Al Azhar]] [[Ahmed el-Tayeb]], the [[Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Orthodox Pope]] [[Pope Tawadros II of Alexandria|Tawadros II]] and opposition leader [[Mohamed ElBaradei]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2013/07/201376165715352978.html|agency=Al Jazeera|title=Elbaradei appointed as Egypt's interim PM|date=6 July 2013|accessdate=6 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were mixed international reactions to the events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.chron.com/bakerblog/2013/07/egypt-after-the-revolution-only-the-beginning-of-the-beginning/ Egypt after the coup: Only the beginning of the beginning |Baker Institute Blog |a Chron.com blog]{{dead link|date=July 2016}}.

In February 2011, [[Hosni Mubarak]] resigned after [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011|18 days of mass demonstrations]] that ended [[History of Egypt under Hosni Mubarak|his 29-year rule of Egypt]]. In July 2011 the caretaker government approved an election law, leading to election of a Parliament in December 2011 – January 2012, and an advisory council in January–February 2012 [ref: Egyptian Parliamentary Election 2011–2012; Wikipedia] An alliance led by the Freedom and Justice Party won the most seats in each election.  An additional 25% of the members of the advisory council were to be appointed by the President.  In June 2012, Mohamed Morsi won the [[Egyptian presidential election, 2012|presidential election]] with 51.73% of total votes to become the first democratically elected president of Egypt.&lt;ref name=Hauslohner/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Khalil |first=Ashraf |url=http://world.time.com/2013/07/03/egypts-military-ousts-democratically-elected-president-morsi-angering-his-islamist-supporters/ |title=Egypt: President Morsi's Ouster Angers Islamist Supporters |publisher=World.time.com |date=30 June 2013 |accessdate=6 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lederman |first=Josh |url=http://www.edmontonjournal.com/news/Pentagon+Secretary+Hagel+calls+Egyptian+defence+minister/8611323/story.html |title=Egypt's future uncertain, US takes cautious approach and urges quick return to elected govt |publisher=Edmontonjournal.com |date=2 July 2013 |accessdate=6 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006074344/http://www.edmontonjournal.com/news/Pentagon%2BSecretary%2BHagel%2Bcalls%2BEgyptian%2Bdefence%2Bminister/8611323/story.html |archivedate=6 October 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In June 2012, prior to Morsi being sworn in as President, the Supreme Constitutional Court ruled that the election law was unconstitutional and ordered the elected bodies dissolved.  After assuming office, President Morsi appointed additional members to the advisory council from 35 political parties and invited the elected bodies to meet to discuss the ruling of the court.

The elected parliament determined that the constitutional court did not have authority to dissolve an elected parliament, then referred the matter to the Court of Cassation.  The elected parliament could not pass any laws, but the advisory council continued to give advice on proposed Presidential Decrees.  Parliament also proceeded with creation of a new constitutional committee to draft amendments to the Egyptian Constitution, replacing the committee created in March 2012 but dissolved by the constitutional court.  Proposed constitutional amendments were approved in December 2012 by a national referendum.&lt;ref&gt;[[Egyptian constitutional referendum, 2012|Egyptian constitutional referendum, 2012 – Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia]]&lt;/ref&gt; New elections were scheduled for April 2013 under a law approved in draft by the constitutional court, but were postponed to October 2013 to comply with a technical order of an administrative court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/11/us-egypt-elections-law-idUSBRE93A0J720130411 |work=Reuters |title=Egyptian parliament approves revamped election law |date=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/04/21/state-agency-representing-egypt-president-loses-appeal-high-court-upholds/ |work=Fox News |title=State agency representing Egypt president loses appeal, high court upholds election suspension |date=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2012, following the protests against the [[Muslim Brotherhood in post-Mubarak electoral politics of Egypt#President Morsi's temporary assumption of full constitutional power and push for new constitution|Constitutional Declaration]] by Morsi, opposition politicians – including [[Mohamed ElBaradei]], [[Amr Moussa]] and [[Hamdeen Sabahi]], according to the [[The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal]] – started holding confidential meetings with army leaders, in order to discuss ways of removing President Morsi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324425204578601700051224658|title=In Egypt, the 'Deep State' Rises Again|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|date=12 July 2013|accessdate=15 July 2013|first1=Charles|last1=Levinson|first2=Matt|last2=Bradley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 April 2013, [[Tamarod]] was started as a grassroots movement to collect signatures to remove Morsi by 30 June. They called for peaceful demonstrations across Egypt especially in front of the Presidential Palace in Cairo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Egypt's 'Rebel' campaign gathered 22 mn signatures, says spokesman|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/75244/Egypt/Politics-/Egypts-Rebel-campaign-gathered--mn-signatures,-say.aspx|agency=Ahram Online|date=29 June 2013|accessdate=29 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement was supported by the [[National Salvation Front (Egypt)|National Salvation Front]], [[April 6 Youth Movement]] and [[Strong Egypt Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Reactions vary to the Rebel movement's 30 June plans|url=http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2013/06/05/reactions-vary-to-tamarods-30-june-plans/|agency=Daily News Egypt|date=5 June 2013|accessdate=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Strong Egypt Party supports protest on 30 June, opposes military coup|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/74273/Egypt/Politics-/Strong-Egypt-Party-supports-protest-on--June,-oppo.aspx|agency=Ahram Online|date=18 June 2013|accessdate=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a poll published by PEW research center in May 2013, 54% of Egyptians approved of Morsi against a 43% who saw him negatively, while about 30% were happy with the direction of the country, 73% thought positively of the army and only 35% were content about local policy authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewglobal.org/2013/05/16/egyptians-increasingly-glum/|title=Egyptians Increasingly Glum|date=16 May 2013|work=Pew Research Center's Global Attitudes Project|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the lead up to the protests, a [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]] poll indicated that about a third of Egyptians said they were "suffering" and viewed their lives poorly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/163877/morsi-ousted-suffering-shot-egypt.aspx |title=As Morsi Ousted, "Suffering" Shot Up in Egypt |publisher=Gallup.com |date= |accessdate=27 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a conference on 15 June, Morsi called for [[Foreign involvement in the Syrian civil war|foreign intervention in Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Egyptian president cuts ties with Syria and calls for no-fly zone over country |agency=Reuters |newspaper=The Guardian |date=15 June 2013 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/15/egypt-mohamed-morsi-cuts-ties-with-syria |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Yasser El-Shimy, an analyst with the [[International Crisis Group]], this statement crossed "a national security red line." The army rebuked this statement the next day by stating that its only role was to guard Egypt's borders.

As the first anniversary of Morsi's presidential inauguration approached in 2013, his supporters such as the [[Anti-Coup Alliance|National Coalition for Supporting Legitimacy]] started demonstrations at multiple places including [[El-Hossari Mosque]], [[El-Nahda Square]], outside [[Cairo University]], outside Al-Rayan Mosque in the posh suburb of Maadi, and in [[Ain Shams]] district.

==Causes==
The removal of Morsi from office by the coalition was a result of a [[coup d'état]] following protests, that were instigated by frustration with Morsi's year-long rule in which Egypt faced economic issues, energy shortages, lack of security, and diplomatic crises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://masroregypt.wordpress.com/2013/08/16/the-revolution-continues/|title=The Revolution Continues|work=Masr or Egypt|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the issues that might have caused the protests and lead to the later removal of Morsi include:

* A year earlier (on 22 November 2012), President Morsi enacted a constitutional declaration, granting the presidential power to appoint the People's Prosecutor, and until the constitution was finalized, and a new People's Assembly was elected, all Presidential decisions were final and irrefutable. The declaration also immunized the Constituent Assembly and Shura Council from dissolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/News/58947.aspx |title=English text of Morsi's Constitutional Declaration – Politics – Egypt – Ahram Online |publisher=English.ahram.org.eg |date= |accessdate=27 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The declaration was later abrogated before referendum due to multiple protests and public anger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Spencer|first=Richard|title=Violence breaks out across Egypt as protesters decry Mohammed Morsi's constitutional 'coup'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/9699801/Violence-breaks-out-across-Egypt-as-protesters-decry-Mohammed-Morsis-constitutional-coup.html|newspaper=Telegraph|date=23 November 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/News/50248.aspx |title=English text of President Morsi's new Egypt Constitutional Declaration – First 100 days – Egypt – Ahram Online |publisher=English.ahram.org.eg |date= |accessdate=27 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  {{Verify source|date=April 2016}}

{{main article|June 2013 Egyptian protests}}
[[File:Anti Morsi protest march at 28th June 2013.jpg|thumb|Anti-Morsi demonstrators marching in Cairo on 28 June]]

On Friday 28 June, protests against Morsi started to build throughout Egypt including in such cities as [[Cairo]], [[Alexandria]], [[Dakahlia Governorate|Dakahlia]], [[Gharbia Governorate|Gharbiya]] and [[Aswan]] as a "warm up" for the massive protests expected on 30 June that were planned by Tamarod. Pro-Morsi and Muslim Brotherhood supporters started counter demonstrations at the [[Rabia Al-Adawiya Mosque]] in Nasr City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/News/75483.aspx |title=Egypt warms up for a decisive day of anti- and pro-Morsi protests |publisher=English.ahram.org.eg |date=7 February 2013 |accessdate=3 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the protests, Christians, particularly in Upper Egypt, received threats from pro-Morsi protestors, pressuring them not to take part in the protests. Sheikh Essam Abdulamek, a member of parliament's Shura Council, said in an interview on television that Christians should not participate in the protests and warned them "do not sacrifice your children [since the] general Muslim opinion will not be silent about the ousting of the president."&lt;ref name="human"/&gt;

According to information that came out after the removal of Morsi, officials claimed that Morsi stopped working at [[Egyptian Presidential Palace]] on 26 June in anticipation to the protests and moved with his family to [[El-Quba Palace]].&lt;ref name="bigstory1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hendawi |first=Hamza |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/his-final-days-morsi-was-isolated-defiant |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130707111210/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/his-final-days-morsi-was-isolated-defiant |archivedate=7 July 2013 |title=In his final days, Morsi was isolated but defiant |publisher=Bigstory.ap.org |date=1 July 2013 |dead-url=yes |accessdate=6 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, the coup was preceded by the reconciliation of military and economic elites who organized shortages of fuel to provoke discontent of general population toward the Morsi administration.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/25995601/Egyptian_coup_of_2013_an_econometric_analysis Egyptian coup of 2013: an ‘econometric’ analysis.

On the same day, it was reported that [[Barack Obama]] called Morsi.

===3 July: Day of Action===
[[File:General Al Sisi.jpg|thumb|right|General [[Abdul Fatah al-Sisi]] in 2013.]]
As the deadline of the army's ultimatum approached on 3 July, there was renewed expectation of an increase in violence, according to the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dahlia Kholaif |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/07/201373104310728444.html |title=Fears of bloodshed loom large in Egypt |publisher=Al Jazeera |accessdate=3 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As in other days, there were both anti-Morsi and pro-Morsi protests, the latter particularly in Nasr City and near Cairo University. Army tanks were reported to surround two smaller pro-Morsi rallies as the demonstrators vowed to defend the government with their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Winston Sm1th |url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/07/03/1220929/-Al-Jazeera-Reports-that-Tanks-Ordered-to-Pro-Morsi-Rally |title=Al Jazeera Reports that Tanks Ordered to Pro-Morsi Rally |work=Daily Kos |date=7 March 2013 |accessdate=3 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the 16:35 deadline set by the army approached, the coalition met with the military leaders for emergency talks, with the expectation that the army would issue a statement when the deadline passed. [[Mohamed El-Baradei]], who was chosen to represent the [[National Salvation Front (Egypt)|National Salvation Front]], was also said to have met army chief General [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2013/07/20137394753443155.html |title=Egypt's Morsi offers consensus government |publisher=Al Jazeera |accessdate=3 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On same day just before the deadline approached, Morsi offered to form a consensus government. An army statement read: "The General Command of the Armed Forces is currently meeting with a number of religious, national, political and youth icons...There will be a statement issued from the General Command as soon as they are done." At the same time the Freedom and Justice Party's senior leader, [[Waleed al-Haddad]], said: "We do not go to invitations (meetings) with anyone. We have a president and that is it."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt;

At about 17:30 [[Mohammed Zaki]], Leader of Republic Guards, joined Morsi with some of the Republic Guards officers and conducted the arrest. It was reported from Morsi's assistant [[Yahya Hamed]] the flow of conversation took place as Morsi saying "Mohammed (Leader of Republic Guards) you know well you are going to be trailed for that." and Mohammed Zaki replying: "I know, however I had already told them I don't want in, because of my special good relations with the president."&lt;ref name="التفاصيل الأخيرة لحكم مرسي"/&gt;{{POV statement|talk=uncorroborated biased statements|date=November 2016}}

===14 August crackdown===
{{main article|August 2013 Rabaa massacre}}
[[File:Dead bodies in RABIA Massacre (3).jpg|thumb|180px|Bodies of pro-Morsi Muslim Brotherhood members]]
On 14 August 2013, Egyptian security forces raided two camps of protesters in Cairo: one at al-Nahda Square and a larger one at Rabaa al-Adawiya Mosque. The two sites had been occupied by supporters of ousted President Mohamed Morsi, who was removed from office by the military after mass street protests against him. The camps were raided after initiatives to end the six-week sit-ins failed and as a result of the raids the camps were cleared out within hours.

The Interior Minister Mohamed Ibrahim announced that police used water hoses to disperse the campers. Yet, all videos and photos from the scenes of the raids never showed water or hoses. Tents and bodies were on fire, and the main mosque of [[Rabaa al-Adawiya mosque|Rabaa Al-Adawiya]] was burned with hundreds of unidentified bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=El-Hewie|first=Mohamed F|title=Islam Facts and Fiction And The Fight For Egypt|year=2013|publisher=Shaymaa Publishing|location=USA|isbn=1493577530|page=246|url=https://www.amazon.com/Islam-Facts-Fiction-Fight-Egypt/dp/1493577530/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1383300968&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Islam+Facts+and+Fiction+And+The+Fight+For+Egypt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Egyptian Health Ministry, 638 people were killed on 14 August, of which 595 were civilians and 43 police officers, with at least 3,994 injured. However, the Muslim brotherhood and National Coalition for Supporting Legitimacy (NCSL) put the number of deaths from the Rabaa al-Adawiya Mosque sit-in alone at some 2,600. Violent retaliation followed in several cities across the country. The interim government declared a month-long state of emergency in response and curfews were instituted in many areas. The total casualty count made 14 August the deadliest day since the 2011 Egyptian revolution which toppled Morsi's predecessor Hosni Mubarak. The clashes between the police and some armed protestors were widely denounced by world leaders, with the exception of Gulf Arab states: the U.A.E., Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and potential GCC member Jordan.

A study conducted by the Egyptian Centre for Media Studies and Public Opinion{{Disputed inline|the organisation is literally unknown|date=November 2016}} revealed that 79% of Egyptians believe the massacres on 14 August were crimes against humanity. 73% hold General Al Sisi, the Defence Minister, responsible for the massacres {{Verify source|date=April 2016}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/news/africa/7043-new-study-reveals-73-of-egyptians-believe-sisi-is-responsible-for-massacres|title=Middle East Monitor|author=|date=|work=middleeastmonitor.com|access-date=11 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214201412/https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/news/africa/7043-new-study-reveals-73-of-egyptians-believe-sisi-is-responsible-for-massacres#|archive-date=14 December 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another poll by Egyptian Centre for Public Opinion Research later showed that 67 percent of Egyptians were satisfied about the method in which the Rabaa al-Adaweya and Nahda sit-ins were dispersed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Poll: 67% of Egyptians satisfied about method of ending pro-Morsy sit-ins |url=http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/poll-67-egyptians-satisfied-about-method-ending-pro-morsy-sit-ins}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Egyptian opinion on sit-in dispersals: Finding truth in reported facts|url=http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2013/08/26/egyptian-opinion-on-sit-in-dispersals-finding-truth-in-reported-facts/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=67% of Egyptians are satisfied with dispersal of Brotherhood sit-ins: Baseera

On 10 December, thirteen Egyptian and international human rights organizations urged Cairo's interim authorities to probe the mass killing of protesters in the capital on 14 August. The joint call issued by organizations that included Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, said an investigation must be launched into the killing of "up to 1,000 people by security forces" almost four months ago when they dispersed sit-ins by supporters of deposed president Mohamed Morsi. "There can be no hope for the rule of law and political stability in Egypt, much less some modicum of justice for victims, without accountability for what may be the single biggest incident of mass killing in Egypt's recent history," said Gasser Abdel-Razak, associate director at the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights. "As a first step toward accountability, the government should establish an effective independent fact-finding committee to investigate responsibility throughout the chain of command for the unlawful killings," the rights groups said. They said that on 14 August a "small minority of protesters used firearms... but the police responded excessively by shooting recklessly, going far beyond what is permitted under international law." "After the unprecedented levels of violence and casualties seen since the ousting of Mohamed Morsi, investigations must provide real answers and cannot be another whitewash of the security forces' record," Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui of Amnesty International said in the statement. "Egypt's authorities cannot deal with the carnage through PR in world's capitals, rewriting events and locking up Morsi's supporters." The groups also said the probe should determine whether there is any evidence of a policy to kill protesters or commit other serious crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/88788/Egypt/Politics-/Rights-groups-urge-probe-of-mass-killing-in-Egypt.aspx|title=Rights groups urge probe of mass killing in Egypt|publisher=|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Back in 2011, Egypt opened a probe on former Interior Minister Habib el-Adly's reported role in the New Year's Eve bombing of al-Qiddissin Church in Alexandria in which 24 people were killed. According to the UK diplomatic sources quoted in the reports, the former interior ministry had masterminded the deadly church attack with the intent to blame it on Islamists, escalate government crackdown on them, and gain increased western support for the regime.
The former interior minister had built up in over six years a special security system that was managed by 22 officers and that employed a number of former radical Islamists, drug dealers and some security firms to carry out acts of sabotage around the country in case the regime was under threat to collapse. The proclamation also pointed, sourcing reports on UK intelligence services, that interior ministry officer Maj. Fathi Abdelwahid began on 11 December 2011 preparing Ahmed Mohamed Khaled, who had spent 11 years in Egyptian prisons, to contact an extremist group named Jundullah and coordinate with it the attack on the Alexandria church. Khaled reportedly told the group he could assist with providing weapons he had allegedly obtained from Gaza and that the act was meant to "discipline the Copts." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/02/07/136723.html|title=Ex-minister suspected behind Alex church bombing|first=|last=0|date=|work=alarabiya.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What the Brotherhood neglected to understand is that democracy means more than simply holding elections.  Real democracy requires inclusiveness, compromise, respect for human and minority rights, and a commitment to the rule of law.  Morsi and his inner circle did not embrace any of these principles and instead chose to consolidate power and rule by fiat.  As a result the Egyptian people and their economy suffered greatly. It is now up to the Egyptian military to demonstrate that the new transitional government can and will govern in a transparent manner and work to return the country to democratic rule.

The military was faced with, genuinely overheated situation … It isn’t a coup in any classic sense and, yet, the military played a role in upsetting the government. We have to ask ourselves, then, finally, what are the interests of the United States? And here the president wisely has waiver authority and has to make a judgment. Egypt is the largest and most influential country in the Middle East. Egypt is central to peace with Israel. Egypt's fate will influence the course of politics elsewhere in the region. So we want to be very, very careful before we go out and condemn an event that has, by the most recent polling of Egypt's best pollsters, 80 percent support in the population.

====Political NGO====
* {{flagicon image|Flag of al-Qaeda.svg}} [[Al-Qaeda]] – Al-Qaeda's Egyptian leader [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]] commented in a video released on the Internet by criticising the Islamists for losing power and not uniting to implement [[Sharia]]. He said: "The battle isn’t over, it has just started...the Islamic nation should offer victims and sacrifices to achieve what it wants and restore power from the corrupt authority governing Egypt."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2013/07/06/al-zawahiri-calls-for-victims-and-sacrifices/|title=Al-Zawahiri calls for "victims and sacrifices"|date=6 July 2013|publisher=Daily News Egypt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Media====
Syrian state-television carried live coverage of the anti-Morsi protests.&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/07/03/uk-egypt-protests-syria-idUKBRE96219620130703 |title=Syria's Assad says political Islam being defeated in Egypt |agency=Reuters |accessdate=3 July 2013 |first=Dominic |last=Evans |date=3 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also said of the statement that "Syria's people and leadership and army express their deep appreciation for the national, populist movement in Egypt which has yielded a great achievement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/world/middle-east/syria-hails-ouster-of-egypts-morsi-as-great-achievement#ixzz2YDSNwu00 |title=Syria hails ouster of Egypt's Morsi as 'great achievement' |publisher=The National |agency=AFP |date=4 July 2013 |accessdate=6 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States media pointed out that Obama did not call the removal of Morsi a coup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/07/03/19273203-we-pray-for-god-to-help-you-reactions-to-military-take-over-in-egypt?lite |title='We pray for God to help you': Reactions to military take-over in Egypt |publisher=NBCNews.com |date=3 July 2013 |accessdate=3 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; If Obama accepts that a coup had taken place, then U.S. law requires him to cut off military and economic aid to Egypt such as previous incidents in [[2005 Mauritanian coup d'état|Mauritania]], [[2012 Malian coup d'état|Mali]], [[2009 Malagasy political crisis|Madagascar]] and [[1999 Pakistani coup d'état|Pakistan]]. The U.S. funds 20% of Egypt's military costs (US$1.3 billion) and gives another US$250 million in economic aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Miller |first=Zeke J |url=http://swampland.time.com/2013/07/03/apparent-egyptian-military-coup-puts-obama-in-bind-on-military-aid/ |title=Apparent Egyptian Military Coup Puts Obama in Bind on Aid &amp;#124; TIME.com |publisher=Swampland.time.com |date=3 July 2013|accessdate=4 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Al Jazeera'' noted that the refusal to term the events as a coup were tied with the U.S. stance in stopping military aid to countries that have perpetrated a coup.&lt;ref name="aljazreact"/&gt;

The media noted that the U.K. did not condemn the removal of Morsi, nor call for him to be restored to power.&lt;ref name="reacts"/&gt; Some media reports refer to the events as another "revolution"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mohamed Morsi ousted in Egypt's second revolution in two years|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/03/mohamed-morsi-egypt-second-revolution|newspaper=The Guardian|date=4 July 2013|location=London|first1=Patrick|last1=Kingsley|first2=Martin|last2=Chulov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fisher|first=Max|title=Is what happened in Egypt a coup or a revolution?

====Others====
[[Egyptian American]]s, particularly in the Arab-dominated areas of [[Michigan]], had mixed views of the event with some wary of the Muslim Brotherhood, but also wary of usurping democratic rights following a 30-year dictatorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Warikoo |first=Niraj |url=http://www.freep.com/article/20130703/NEWS05/307030163/1008/NEWS06/Egyptian-Americans-mixed-reaction-Morsi-s-removal |title=Egyptian Americans in metro Detroit have mixed reaction to Morsi's removal |publisher=Detroit Free Press |date=3 July 2013 |accessdate=6 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231010459/http://www.freep.com/article/20130703/NEWS05/307030163/1008/NEWS06/Egyptian-Americans-mixed-reaction-Morsi-s-removal |archivedate=31 December 2013 |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5839">'''Ackomokki''' or '''A-ca-oo-mah-ca-ye''', also known as '''Old Swan''', was the name of three [[Siksika Nation|Siksiká]] [[Tribal chief|chief]]s between the late 1700s and 1860.&lt;ref name="DictCanBio"&gt;{{DictCanbio|ID=3754}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ackomokki/Old Swan (I)==
The first Ackomokki (d. January 1795) was known as a peacemaker who was open to trade with Europeans.&lt;ref name="Binnema2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Binnema|first=Theodore|title=Common and Contested Ground: A Human and Environmental History of the Northwestern Plains|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VIFuHTPIVIEC&amp;pg=PA174|accessdate=25 November 2018|year=2001|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|location=Norman, Oklahoma|isbn=978-0-8061-3361-4|pages=174–175; 223}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time Ackomokki was chief, the [[Blackfoot Confederacy|Blackfoot/Plains Confederacy]] had consolidated power throughout he plains of what is modern-day Montana, Alberta, and western Saskatchewan.&lt;ref name="Judy1987"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Judy| first=Mark A.| date=1987| title=Powder Keg on the Upper Missouri: Sources of Blackfeet Hostility, 1730-1810| url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/1183693| journal=American Indian Quarterly| volume=11| issue=2| pages=127-144| doi=10.2307/1183693| jstor=1183693| access-date=November 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ackomokki/Old Swan (II)/Feathers==
Ackomokki's son was known to fur traders as ''Feathers'' (or ''Painted Feathers''), but after his father's death he took on his father's name, ''Old Swan'' (or ''Ackomokki'' in [[Blackfoot language|Blackfoot]])&lt;ref name="Binnema2001" /&gt;, although Europeans continued to call him "Feathers" or "Many Swans" to distinguish him from his father. The younger Ackomokki (d. 1814), like his father, worked to preserve peace among his people and the neighboring [[Cree]] and [[Assiniboine]] peoples, as well as with European traders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bradford|first=Tolley|editor-first=Gregory P.|editor-last=Marchildon|title=The Early Northwest|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p3Yy3RjHKJkC&amp;pg=PA166|accessdate=25 November 2018|year=2008|publisher=University of Regina Press|location=Regina, Saskatchewan|isbn=978-0-88977-207-6|pages=147–170|chapter=Home, Away from Home: Old Swan, James Bird and the Edmonton District, 1795–1815}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1800, Ackomokki allowed the Hudson's Bay Company to establish the Chesterfield House trading post within the Blackfoot's wintering grounds at the confluence of the [[Red Deer River|Red Deer]] and [[South Saskatchewan River]]s.&lt;ref name="Binnema2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FosterMacleod2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Binnema|first=Theodore|editor1-first=John Elgin |editor1-last=Foster| editor2-first=R.C. |editor2-last=Macleod| editor3-first=Theodore |editor3-last=Binnema|title=From Rupert's Land to Canada|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=owas2dba1jYC&amp;pg=PA220|accessdate=25 November 2018|year=2001|publisher=University of Alberta Press|location=Edmonton, Alberta|isbn=978-0-88864-363-6|pages=201–227|chapter=How Does a Map Mean?}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, changes in the balance of power between the Blackfoot and neighboring tribes brought on in part by westward expansion of U.S. traders lead to increasing conflicts and military decline for the Siksika.&lt;ref name="Judy1987" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FosterMacleod2001" /&gt;

Around 1801, the younger Ackomokki drew for Hudson Bay Company surveyor [[Peter Fidler]] a detailed map of the lands around the [[Missouri River|Upper Missouri]], including names of rivers, mountains, and peaks and travel time between them and information about 32 tribes populating the region.&lt;ref name="Beattie1985"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Beattie| first=Judith Hudson| date=1985| title=Indian Maps in the Hudson's Bay Company Archives: A Comparison of Five Area Maps Recorded by Peter Fidler, 1801-1802| url=https://archivaria.ca/index.php/archivaria/article/viewFile/11246/12185| journal=Archivaria| volume=21| issue=Winter| pages=166-175| format=PDF| access-date=November 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These drawings were later incorporated into the 1802 edition of [[Aaron Arrowsmith]]'s map of the Interior Parts of North America.&lt;ref name="Chiarello2014"&gt;{{cite thesis |type=MA |last=Chiarello |first=Michael Cesare |date=2014 |title=Mapping the Liberal Impulse: The Primacy of Cartography in the Hudson's Bay Company's Imperial Project, 1749–1857 |publisher=Carleton University |url=https://curve.carleton.ca/2979825a-b2e8-48a6-a1ea-37d2ba06f2c6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LitalienPalomino2007"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Litalien|first1=Raymonde |last2=Palomino|first2=Jean-François|last3=Vaugeois|first3=Denis |title=La mesure d'un continent: atlas historique de l'Amérique du Nord, 1492-1814|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WJqZOMlZSN0C&amp;pg=PA206|accessdate=25 November 2018|year=2007|publisher=Presses Paris Sorbonne|location=Paris, France|language=French|isbn=978-2-84050-550-1|pages=206–207}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ackomokki's maps included significant details about the topography and inhabitants of the area, which proved helpful in expanding the Hudson's Bay Company activities in the region.&lt;ref name="Chiarello2014" /&gt;

==Ackomokki/Old Swan (III)==
A third Old Swan (d. 1859/1860), possibly a son or nephew of the younger Ackomokki, assumed leadership of what was called by Europeans "Old Feathers' Band" by 1822.&lt;ref name="DictCanBio" /&gt; He was described in 1858 by Dr. [[James Hector]] as one of the principal chiefs of the [[Blackfoot Confederacy]], and, in July 1859, the [[Palliser Expedition]] were his guests at his encampment on the Red Deer River.

'''Advocacy of suicide''' has occurred in many [[culture]]s and [[subculture]]s. [[Confucianism]] holds that one should give up one's [[life]], if necessary, either passively or actively, for the sake of upholding the cardinal moral values of ''[[ren (Confucianism)|ren]]'' (altruism) and ''[[yi (Confucianism)|yi]]'' (righteousness).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://arts.hkbu.edu.hk/~pclo/e5.pdf |author=Lo, Ping-cheung |title=Confucian Ethic of Death with Dignity and Its Contemporary Relevance |year=1999 |publisher=Society of Christian Ethics |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716110845/http://arts.hkbu.edu.hk/~pclo/e5.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Japanese military]] during World War II encouraged and glorified [[kamikaze]] attacks, and Japanese society as a whole has been described as suicide 'tolerant' (see [[Suicide in Japan]]).

==Internet==
Advocacy of [[suicide]] has also taken place over the Internet. A study by the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' found that Web searches for information on suicide are likely to return sites that encourage, and even facilitate, [[suicide attempt]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode.cfm?id=4D4415E7-0BB5-F377-FCD222D85009C84B|title=World Wide Suicide: A Self-Termination Community Grows on the Web|date=April 14, 2008|publisher=Scientific American}}&lt;/ref&gt; While pro-suicide resources were less frequent than neutral or anti-suicide sites, they were nonetheless easily accessible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 18494533 | volume=69 | title=Googling suicide: surfing for suicide information on the Internet | year=2008 | journal=J Clin Psychiatry | pages=878–88 |vauthors=Recupero PR, Harms SE, Noble JM | doi=10.4088/jcp.v69n0601}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is some concern that such sites may push the [[suicidality|suicidal]] over the edge.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/Depression/story?id=4630504&amp;page=1|title=Death by Chat Room?|author =Hunter, Aina|publisher=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people form [[suicide pact]]s with people they meet online.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Teens die after logging into 'suicide chat rooms'|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/teens-die-after-logging-into-suicide-chat-rooms-415386.html|author =Jonathan Owen|date=10 September 2006 | work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; Becker writes, "Suicidal adolescent visitors risk losing their doubts and fears about committing suicide. Risk factors include peer pressure to commit suicide and appointments for joint suicides.

'''Candido Portinari''' (December 29, 1903 – February 6, 1962) was a Brazilian painter. He is considered one of the most important [[Brazil]]ian [[painting|painters]] as well as a prominent and influential practitioner of the [[neorealism (art)|neo-realism]] style in painting.

Portinari painted more than five thousand canvases, from small sketches to monumental works such as the [[War and Peace (Portinari)|Guerra e Paz]] panels, which were donated to the [[United Nations Headquarters]] in 1956. Portinari developed a strong social preoccupation throughout his oeuvre and maintained an active life in the Brazilian cultural and political worlds.

==Life and career==
Born to Giovan Battista Portinari and Domenica Torquato, [[Italian people|Italian]] [[Immigration in Brazil|immigrants]] from Chiampo, [[Veneto]], in a [[coffee]] plantation near [[Brodowski]], in [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]]. Growing up on a coffee plantation of dark soil and blue sky, Portinari gained his inspiration from the homeland he loved. In the majority of his later paintings, murals and frescoes, he used the color blue and lots of browns and reds because this was the color of his home. 

One of Portinari’s beginner jobs was drawing photographs where he closely captured the exact image using paints and then enlarging the photos. These sold successfully because the resemblance was astounding. Portinari then studied at the [[Escola Nacional de Belas Artes]] National School of Fine Arts) in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. In 1928 he won a gold medal at the ENBA and a trip to [[Paris]] where he stayed until 1930, when he returned to Brazil. He traveled to Europe again, finally returning to Brazil in 1933. These visits significantly influenced Portinari. Portinari studied various European artwork, visited museums and during his travels met his future wife, Maria Martinelli. Throughout his time traveling, he didn’t paint much but studied and possibly seeing life elsewhere, hoped to better his homeland as well. He came back to Brazil fully set on conveying the true Brazilian lifestyle and capturing the pain and struggles of his people through his art&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;http://www.portinari.org.br/#/pagina/candido-portinari/apresentacao&lt;/ref&gt;.

After his return, Portinari began portraying the reality of Brazil, from its natural beauties to the harsh lives of the country's most impoverished populations, pursuing an amalgamation of his academic formation with the modernist [[avant-garde]]s. Portinari remained himself and didn’t allow his new experiences and new outlooks change him. His roots remained important to him and he strove to portray this in his paintings; the true Brazilian spirit. He wanted the world to see the harsh reality of living conditions in Brazil and the struggle for survival. Strength, hard work, independence and authenticity shows through in almost every one of his works&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Portinari|last=Bento|first=Antonio|publisher=Leo Christiano Editorial|year=1982|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In 1939, Portinari exposed at the [[1939 New York World's Fair|New York World's Fair]]. In the following year, Portinari had for the first time a canvas exposed at the [[Museum of Modern Art]]. The rise of fascism in Europe, the wars and the close contact with Brazilian problematic society, reaffirmed the social character of his work, as well as conducting him to political engagement.

He joined the [[Brazilian Communist Party]] and stood for [[Chamber of Deputies of Brazil|deputy]] in 1945&lt;ref&gt;ABREU, Alzira Alves de. Dicionário Histórico-Biográfico Brasileiro. Rio de Janeiro; Fundação Getúlio Vargas; 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; and for [[Senate of Brazil|senator]] in 1947,&lt;ref&gt;Candido Portinari[1]Galeria de Arte André.&lt;/ref&gt; but had to flee for [[Uruguay]] due to the persecution of [[Communism|communists]] during the government of [[Eurico Gaspar Dutra]]. In 1951, the first [[São Paulo Art Biennial]] dedicated a special room for his works. He returned to Brazil in the following year, after a declaration of general amnesty from the government. In 1956, after the [[United Nations]] had appealed to its affiliated countries for the donation of a work of art to the organization's new headquarters. Brazil designated Portinari for the task, who took four years and around 180 studies to complete the painting. [[Dag Hammarskjöld]], [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|UN Secretary-General]], named the work "the most important monumental work of art donated to the UN".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guerraepaz.org.br/#/oProjeto&lt;/ref&gt;

Even after being warned by the doctor of the risks of the toxins and poisoning, he didn’t give up and continued to paint. Portinari suffered from ill health during the last decade of his life. He died in [[Rio de Janeiro]] in 1962 in result of [[lead poisoning]] from his paints.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.portinari.org.br/#/pagina/candido-portinari/apresentacao&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 20, 2007, his painting ''{{Interlanguage link multi|O Lavrador de Café|pt}}''&lt;ref name="wordpress"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ritualcafe.files.wordpress.com/2007/07/lavrador-de-cafe.jpg|date=2005-07-18|title=Image: lavrador-de-cafe.jpg, (819 × 1030 px)|publisher=ritualcafe.files.wordpress.com|accessdate=2015-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; was stolen from the [[São Paulo Museum of Art]] along with Pablo Picasso's ''[[Portrait of Suzanne Bloch]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=MacSwan, Angus |title=Security questioned in Picasso theft in Brazil |url=http://uk.news.yahoo.com/rtrs/20071221/ten-uk-brazil-picasso-d3877cb_1.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071230164038/http://uk.news.yahoo.com/rtrs/20071221/ten-uk-brazil-picasso-d3877cb_1.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-12-30 |date=2007-12-21 |publisher=Reuters |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The paintings remained missing until January 8, 2008, when they were recovered in [[Ferraz de Vasconcelos]] by the [[Polícia Militar do Estado de São Paulo|Police of São Paulo]].

There were a number of commemorative events in the centenary of his birth in 2003, including an exhibition of his work in London.

[[File:Brazil Candido Portinari banknote 1989.jpg|thumb|A 1989 Brazilian [[banknote]] featuring Portinari on both sides]]

Portinari's works comprehend a strong will to represent Brazilian people and their traits. Portinari himself said he would "paint that people with that clothing and that color". According to [[Antonio Callado]], Portinari's oeuvre demonstrate a "monumental book of art which teaches Brazilians to love more their land".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.portinari.org.br/#/pagina/candido-portinari/apresentacao&lt;/ref&gt;

Portinari was capable of transcending his original academic formation by experiencing with and absorbing [[Modernism|modernist]] techniques and styles, which fundamentally created his painting personality. The range and sweep of his output includes paintings depicting rural and urban labour, refugees fleeing the hardships of Brazil's rural north-east; and, despite these major and better known aspects of his work, treatments of the key events in the history of Brazil since the arrival of the Portuguese in 1500, images of childhood, portraits of members of his family and leading Brazilian intellectuals, illustrations for books and tiles decorating the Church of São Francisco at [[Pampulha (Belo Horizonte)|Pampulha]], [[Belo Horizonte]].

His career coincided with and included collaboration with [[Oscar Niemeyer]] amongst others. Portinari's works can be found in galleries and settings in Brazil and abroad, ranging from the family chapel in his childhood home in Brodowski to his panels ''Guerra e Paz'' ([[War and Peace (Portinari)|War and Peace]]) in the [[United Nations Art Collection|United Nations]] building in New York and four murals in the Hispanic Reading Room of the [[Library of Congress]] in [[Washington, DC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/hispanic/portinari.html |title=Portinari Murals at Library of Congress |publisher=Loc.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contribution to Brazilian Modernism ==
As previously mentioned, Candido Portinari came from a poor immigrant family&lt;ref&gt;Bento, Antônio. ''Portinari''. Rio de Janeiro: Léo Christiano Editorial, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;. This allowed him to have a unique perspective on Brazilian culture and what it meant to truly Brazilian. This is important because he was a prominent artist during the Brazilian Modernism era&lt;ref&gt;Barnitz, Jacqueline, and Patrick Frank. Twentieth-century art of Latin America. Austin: University of Texas Press, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;. As such, his perspective gave a more proud and dignified view of the workers at that time. While other artists like Lasar Segall with ''Bananal'' and Tarsila do Amaral with ''Workers'' provided a picture of the workers that removed personality and made each individual anonymous, Portinari did the opposite. For example, in his painting, ''The Mestizo'', he paints a character that looks strong, competent, and noble. In this, he is demonstrating that the workers were not broken. Instead, they were proud and independent. Portinari used his culture and life experience to add to the explanation of what Brazil is in a distinctive style.

== Portinari's Murals ==
In ''Cocoa (1938)'' Portinari depicts workers on the coffee plantations. A woman is seen in the back balancing a crate on her head and there is a child in the painting. This was meant to signify that children were present during this hard work as well, and were encouraged to help the parents. Land was given to families in return for their labor on the plantations where they took care of their share. Here too is included the use of blues and oranges to truly capture the significance of Brazil, which was Portinari’s desire. This artwork was described by saying “Brazil is being rescued from obscurity by ‘Portinari’s Coffee’.”&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Portinari of Brazil|last=Museum of Modern Art|first=|publisher=The Museum of Modern Art|year=1940|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Coffee (National Museum of Fine Arts, 1935)'' represents strong and resourceful workers. Their big hands and feet show they were strong and did not fear hard work.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The people worked together to preserve their lands and survive. This painting is also a great depiction of “realism” because of how he captures his people with the short bodies, rounder heads and the brown and red hues of the land.

In ''The Mestizo (1934)'' he tries to present not just a portrait but an individual type of person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Art in Latin America: The Modern Era, 1820-1980|last=Ades|first=Dawns|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Portinari shows that Brazilian workers were tough and proud of their work because in the background of the ''Mestizo'' are seen the fields and all their hard work; his proud stance portrays confidence and strength. 

''War and Peace'' (Guerra and Paz; Palácio Gustavo Capanema in Rio de Janeiro; 1952-56) was a mural created when the United Nations asked Brazil to donate a work of art. Portinari created two murals to show war, agony, fear and pain that showed how the people suffered and were affected during the war. His use of blue hues in ''War'' created a contrast between the lighter yellows in ''Peace''. The second was meant to express peace and happiness. Bento Antonio in his book ''Portinari'', describes this work as, “a sort of innocent vision of paradise.” With this mural, he also meant to connect different racial groups and show peace among the variety of individuals. There was a large variety of ethnicities that lived in Brazil at this time. His works were meant to create a bridge between the multicultural individuals. This work is located in the United Nations General Assembly building in New York which was created in remembrance to World War II and its horrors. It was meant to resemble something that should never occur again. Here, visitors come witnessing an epitome of war and leave realizing that peace is indeed attainable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://culturalbrny.com/2016/01/01/the-second-unveiling-of-war-and-peace/|title=THE SECOND UNVEILING OF “WAR AND PEACE”|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  “Guerra and Paz are the synthesis of an entire life committed to human beings. His painting, like his militant political views, spoke out against injustice, violence and misery in the world per his son, João Candido Portinari.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://agencia.fapesp.br/portinaris_war_and_peace_are_shown_for_the_first_time_in_sao_paulo/15258/|title=Portinari's War and Peace are shown for the first time in São Paulo|last=Alisson|first=Elton|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the Hispanic Foundation of the Library of Congress, Washington D.C. are located four murals that Portinari did in 1941 depicting the struggles of the Hispanic Americans. ''Discovery of the Land, Entry into the Forest, Teaching of the Indians, and Discovery of Gold'' are all meant to represent the coming of the Spaniards and Portuguese to America and took him two months to complete with the help of his brother Luiz. The ''Discovery of the Land'' is meant to show common sailors that sailed the boats. ''Entry in the Forest'' is the “reminiscent of frescoes” where he also doesn’t fail to capture his style of enlarging the figures’ arms and legs to show their strength. In the ''Teaching of the Indians,'' Portinari tries to create a scene of a priest or Spanish “Jesuit father” with Indians and obvious unity. Also the presence of the red Brazilian soil. The last mural, ''Discovery of Gold'' the artist chooses to paint just a single boat and specific people to represent that they had found gold. The Brazilian government paid for Portinari to travel to Washington to create the murals and represent their country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/hispanic/portinari.html|title=Hispanic Reading Room|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=August 17, 2010|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
Portinari once said, “I am the Son of the Red Earth. I decided to paint the Brazilian reality, naked and crude as it is.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Breedlove|first=Byron|last2=Sorvillo|first2=Frank J.|title=“I Am a Son of the Red Earth”|url=http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/22/8/AC-2208_article.htm|journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases|language=en-us|volume=22|issue=8|pages=1524–1525|doi=10.3201/eid2208.ac2208}}&lt;/ref&gt; Life in Brazil wasn’t easy for Portinari, especially considering he was never wealthy, but his desire to show proof of this reality is evident in all his artworks. Poor housing, inadequate nutrition, no education, little or no healthcare access and various diseases created desperate situations for the Brazilian people who struggled to survive. This led to Portinari’s desire to raise global awareness of the human pain which he tried to depict in almost every painting. 

Portinari also greatly affected the future Brazilian generation of artists, musicians, poets and composers. Having vastly traveled Europe, studying their art, their technique and styles, he came back to Brazil hoping to create his personal method and interpret his own style. Instead of continuing to imitate the European appearance, Portinari painted what he experienced and his life. Portinari’s works urged emerging artists to pursue their own, unique style particular to their lives, experiences and reality in their country. This is also another reason blues, reds, and oranges were so commonly used in his art; the colors of his homeland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/30/arts/brazil-gathers-archive-on-its-painter-portinari.html|title=BRAZIL GATHERS ARCHIVE ON ITS PAINTER, PORTINARI|last=Hoge|first=Warren|date=1983-05-30|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-12-06|last2=Times|first2=Special to the New York|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Projeto Portinari,'' begun in 1979 is dedicated to Candido Portinari by his son Joao Candido to revive his works, make them more known and preserve the history. Not only was his son able to locate more than 5,000 paintings, he also found thousands of drawings, sketches, and documents related to Portinari’s life and travels and interactions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
The Catalogue Raisonné of Portinari’s complete works was published in 2004. It was the first Raisonné covering the complete works of a Latin American painter.
“Projeto Portinari” also curated the first retrospective exhibition of Portinari’s oeuvre, at the “Museu de Arte de São Paulo - MASP”, in 1997.

Candido Portinari name continues to be seen today. Rodovia Candido Portinari is a State highway located in Brazil in São Paulo.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

The '''Carnegie Collection''' was a series of authentic [[replicas]] based on [[dinosaur]]s and other extinct [[prehistoric]] creatures, using [[fossils]] featured at the [[Carnegie Museum of Natural History]] as references.  The line was produced by [[Florida]]-based company [[Safari Ltd]]., known for their hand-painted replicas, from 1989 to 2015.

== Statistics ==
The collection was first released in 1989, with seventeen models. The line has seen a steady stream of additions since that time, usually two or three each year. As of 2009, 70 models representing 49 species of dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals have been produced for the line, although several of these have been retired during the course of its run.  Each of the models is hand-painted, ensuring that no two copies of the same model are identical.  Each animal featured is authenticated by [[paleontologists]] using the scientific data available (although models are occasionally outdated by newer findings, see below).  Most of the animals are designed at a 1:40 scale (where one inch on the model represents 40&amp;nbsp;inches on the real creature), although some models representing smaller creatures are built at a larger scale.  Models in the collection range greatly in size from 24&amp;nbsp;inches long (original ''Diplodocus'') to only three inches long (original ''Dimetrodon'') with all shapes and sizes represented in-between.  On the underside of each model is information detailing its name, year of initial production, and [[copyright]] information.

The models feature an informational hang tag providing scientific details about the animal represented by the replica. In some cases, the dinosaurs were packaged in cardboard display boxes, in which case a small booklet featuring information on each dinosaur featured in the collection was included in lieu of the hang tags. In some instances, two or three models would be packaged together in a box.  Examples include ''Dimetrodon'' and ''Deinonychus'', ''Protoceratops'' and ''Euoplocephalus'', ''Apatosaurus'' and ''Apatosaurus'' Baby, ''Elasmosaurus'' and ''Mosasaurus'', and ''Australopithecus'' Male/Female pair and ''Smilodon''. The boxes are not often seen today, and most of the time the dinosaurs are found free of packaging.  Also produced for the collection was a specially-designed display "mountain". The display featured multiple tiers upon which the pieces in the collection could be placed in a variety of creative ways. This display was touted primarily to retailers in order to encourage sales of the replicas, but the display has also become popular with collectors. A second display set was made in gray plastic that featured a volcano, but this design was short-lived.

Production of the Carnegie Collection concluded in March 2015, after a 28 year partnership.

== Models ==
[[File:Carnegie 1st 10 years.JPG|thumb|right|All models released in the first ten years of the Carnegie Collection's history. All of the models that received updated sculpts in 1996 here are seen in their updated molds, except for ''[[Stegosaurus]]''.]]Prior to 1996, each model was cast from a grey material and covered in a coat of paint corresponding to the base color of the finished model. The details of the model were then painted onto this layer of paint, resulting in a loss of the finer sculpting detail due to the thickness of the paint on each finished model. Beginning in 1996, each model was cast from a pigmented material corresponding to the base color of the finished model. The details of the model were then painted directly onto this material, resulting in greater detail and a less shiny appearance. 

To coincide with this change in production, eight models were retired between 1996 and 1997, and the sculpts of the remaining eighteen models were updated. Despite the modifications, the eighteen remaining models retained the same model numbers as their predecessors. This became the cause of some confusion as a single model number was used to refer to two versions of the same model, which was particularly noticeable with the new color schemes for ''[[Stegosaurus]]'', ''[[Triceratops]]'', and ''[[Pachycephalosaurus]]''. Colorful name tags were also designed and attached to each model in place of the original folded paper name tags. 

In 2007, twelve more models received new color schemes. These models, however, did not retain the same model numbers as their predecessors. New model numbers were assigned to distinguish them as new versions.

'''Crinoids''' are marine animals that make up the class '''Crinoidea''' of the [[echinoderm]]s (phylum Echinodermata). The name comes from the Greek word ''krinon'', "a lily", and ''eidos'', "form".&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's New Universal Unabridged Dictionary.'' 2nd ed. 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OnlineEtDict&gt;{{cite web|title=crinoid|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=crinoid&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; They live in both shallow water&lt;ref name="Zmarzly85"&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/handle/10125/941 | title=The Shallow-Water Crinoid Fauna of Kwajalein Atoll, Marshall Islands: Ecological Observations, Interatoll Comparisons, and Zoogeographic Affinities | author=Zmarzly, D.L. | journal=Pacific Science | year=1985 | volume=39 | pages=340–358}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in depths as great as {{convert|9000|meters}}.&lt;ref name="IzuDeep"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.2108/zsj.26.406 | title=Discovery of Dense Aggregations of Stalked Crinoids in Izu-Ogasawara Trench, Japan | author=Oji, T. | author2=Ogawa, Y. | author3=Hunter, A.

Crinoids are characterised by a mouth on the top surface that is surrounded by feeding arms. They have a U-shaped gut, and their anus is located next to the mouth. Although the basic echinoderm pattern of fivefold symmetry can be recognised, most crinoids have many more than five arms. Crinoids usually have a stem used to attach themselves to a [[Substrate (marine biology)|substrate]], but many live attached only as juveniles and become free-swimming as adults.

There are only about 600 extant crinoid species,&lt;ref name=adw&gt;{{cite web|url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Crinoidea.html|title=Animal Diversity Web - Crinoidea|publisher=University of Michigan Museum of Zoology|accessdate=August 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they were much more abundant and diverse in the past. Some thick [[limestone]] beds dating to the mid- to late-[[Paleozoic]] are almost entirely made up of disarticulated crinoid fragments.

==Morphology==
[[File:Haeckel Crinoidea.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.9|A stalked crinoid drawn by [[Ernst Haeckel]]]]
[[File:Crinoidea NOAA.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Close-up on the calyx of a characteristic abyssal stalked crinoid. Ten arms are visible, with their pinnules.]] 
Crinoids comprise three basic sections; the stem, the [[Calyx (zoology)|calyx]], and the arms. The stem is composed of highly porous ossicles which are connected by ligamentary tissue. The calyx contains the crinoid's digestive and reproductive organs, and the [[mouth]] is located at the top of the [[Dorsal (anatomy)|dorsal]] cup, while the [[anus]] is located peripheral to it. The arms display [[Symmetry in biology#Pentamerism|pentamerism]] or pentaradial symmetry and comprise smaller ossicles than the stem and are equipped with [[Organelle|cilia]] which facilitate feeding by moving the organic media down the arm and into the mouth.

The majority of living crinoids are free-swimming and have only a [[vestigial]] stalk. In those deep-sea species that still retain a stalk, it may reach up to {{convert|1|m|ft}} in length, although it is usually much smaller. The base of the stalk consists of a disc-like sucker, which, in some species, has root-like structures that further increase its grip on the underlying surface. The stalk is often lined by small [[cirrus (biology)|cirri]].&lt;ref name=IZ&gt;{{cite book |author= Barnes, Robert D. |year=1982 |title= Invertebrate Zoology |publisher= Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 997–1007|isbn= 0-03-056747-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other echinoderms, crinoids have pentaradial symmetry. The aboral surface of the body is studded with plates of calcium carbonate, forming an endoskeleton similar to that in starfish and sea urchins. These make the calyx somewhat cup-shaped, and there are few, if any, ossicles in the oral (upper) surface. The upper surface, or ''tegmen'', is divided into five ''ambulacral areas'', including a deep groove from which the [[tube feet]] project, and five ''interambulacral areas'' between them. The anus, unusually for echinoderms, is found on the same surface as the mouth, at the edge of the tegmen.&lt;ref name=IZ/&gt;

The ambulacral grooves extend onto the arms, which thus have tube feet along their inner surfaces. Primitively, crinoids had only five arms, but in most living species these are divided into two, giving ten arms in total. In most living species, especially the free-swimming feather stars, the arms branch several times, producing up to two hundred branches in total. The arms are jointed, and lined by smaller feather-like appendages, or ''pinnules'', which also include tube feet.&lt;ref name=IZ/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Biology==

===Feeding===
[[File:Podia of a red feather star.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Close-up on the pinnules with visible rows of translucent podia.]]
Crinoids feed by filtering small particles of food from the sea water with their feather-like arms. The tube feet are covered with a sticky [[mucus]] that traps any food that floats past. Once they have caught a particle of food, the tube feet can flick it into the [[ambulacral]] groove, where the cilia are able to propel the stream of mucus towards the mouth. Generally speaking, crinoids living in environments with relatively little [[plankton]] have longer and more highly branched arms than those living in rich environments.&lt;ref name=IZ/&gt;

The mouth descends into a short [[oesophagus]]. There is no true stomach, so the oesophagus connects directly to the [[intestine]], which runs in a single loop right around the inside of the calyx. The intestine often includes numerous [[diverticula]]e, some of which may be long or branched. The end of the intestine opens into a short muscular [[rectum]]. This ascends towards the [[anus]], which projects from a small conical protuberance at the edge of the tegmen.&lt;ref name=IZ/&gt;

=== Predation ===
Specimens of the sea urchin ''[[Calocidaris micans]]'' present in a meadow of the crinoid ''[[Endoxocrinus parrae]]'', have been shown to contain large quantities of stem portions (or columnals) in the direct vicinity of living crinoids, some of which were upended. The gut content of the sea urchins consisted of articulated ossicles with soft tissue, whereas the local sediment contained only disarticulated ossicles without soft tissue. This makes it highly likely that these sea urchins are predators of the crinoids, and that the crinoids flee, offering part of their stem in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1666/07031.1 |title=Urchins in the meadow: Paleobiological and evolutionary implications of cidaroid predation on crinoids |journal=Paleobiology |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=22–34 |year=2008 |last1=Baumiller |first1=Tomasz K. |last2=Mooi |first2=Rich |last3=Messing |first3=Charles G. |jstor=20445573}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various crinoid fossils hint at possible prehistoric predators. Coprolites of both fish and cephalopods have been found containing ossicles of various crinoids, such as the pelagic crinoid ''[[Saccocoma]]'', from the [[Jurassic]] [[lagerstatten]] [[Solnhofen]],&lt;ref name="Hess"&gt;{{cite book |first=Hans |last=Hess |chapter=Upper Jurassic Solnhofen Plattenkalk of Bavaria, German |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=TTKhrnw23MkC&amp;pg=PA216 |pages=216–24 |editor1-first=Carlton E. |editor1-last=Brett |editor2-first=William I. |editor2-last=Ausich |editor3-first=Michael J. |editor3-last=Simms |year=2003 |title=Fossil Crinoids |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-52440-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; while damaged crinoid stems with bite marks matching the toothplates of [[Coccosteidae|coccosteid]] [[placoderms]] have been found in Late [[Devonian]] [[Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1127/0077-7749/2010/0111 |title=Inferred placoderm bite marks on Devonian crinoids from Poland |journal=Neues Jahrbuch für Geologie und Paläontologie - Abhandlungen |volume=259 |pages=105–12 |year=2011 |last1=Gorzelak |first1=Przemys Law |last2=Rakowicz |first2=Lukasz |last3=Salamon |first3=Mariusz A. |last4=Szrek |first4=Piotr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The calyxes of several Devonian to [[Carboniferous]]-aged crinoids have the shells of a snail, ''[[Platyceras]]'', intimately associated with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brett |first1=Carlton E. |first2=Sally E. |last2=Walker |title=Predators and predation in Paleozoic marine environments |journal=Paleontological Society Papers |volume=8 |year=2002 |pages=93–118 |url=http://www.yale.edu/ypmip/predation/Chapter_05.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have the snail situated over the anus, suggesting that ''Platyceras'' was a [[coprophagous]] commensal, while others have the animal directly situated over a borehole, suggesting a more pernicious relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |hdl=2027.42/75509 |title=Infestation of Middle Devonian (Givetian) camerate crinoids by platyceratid gastropods and its implications for the nature of their biotic interaction |journal=Lethaia |volume=36 |issue=2 |pages=71–82 |year=2003 |last1=Gahn |first1=Forest J. |last2=Baumiller |first2=Tomasz K. |doi=10.1080/00241160310003072}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Circulatory systems===

Like other echinoderms, crinoids possess a [[water vascular system]] that maintains [[hydraulic]] pressure in the tube feet. This is not connected to external sea water, as in other echinoderms, but only to the [[coelom|body cavity]]. The body cavity is itself somewhat restricted, being largely replaced by connective tissue, although it is present as narrow canals within the arms and stalk.&lt;ref name=IZ/&gt;

Crinoids also possess a separate '''haemal system''', consisting of fluid-filled sinuses within the connective tissue. There is a large plexus of sinuses around the oesophagus, with branches extending down to a mass of glandular tissue at the base of the calyx.&lt;ref name=IZ/&gt;

These various fluid-filled spaces, in addition to transporting nutrients around the body, also function as both a respiratory and an excretory system. Oxygen is absorbed primarily through the tube feet, which are the most thin-walled parts of the body, while waste is collected by [[phagocyte|phagocytic]] '''coelomocytes'''.&lt;ref name=IZ/&gt;

===Nervous system===

The crinoid nervous system is divided into three parts, with numerous connections between them. The uppermost portion is the only one [[homology (biology)|homologous]] with the nervous systems of other echinoderms. It consists of a central nerve ring surrounding the mouth, and radial nerves branching into the arms. Below this lies a second nerve ring, giving off two brachial nerves into each arm. Both of these sets of nerves are sensory in nature, with the lower set supplying the pinnules and tube feet.&lt;ref name=IZ/&gt; The third portion of the nervous system lies below the other two, and is responsible for motor action. This is centred on a mass of neural tissue near the base of the calyx, and provides a single nerve to each arm and a number of nerves to the stalk.&lt;ref name=IZ/&gt;

===Reproduction and life cycle===

Crinoids are [[dioecious]], with separate male and female individuals. They have no true [[gonad]]s, producing their [[gamete]]s from genital canals found inside some of the pinnules. The pinnules eventually rupture to release the [[sperm]] and [[ovum|eggs]] into the surrounding sea water.&lt;ref name=IZ/&gt; The fertilised eggs hatch to release a free-swimming '''vitellaria''' [[larva]]. The larva is barrel-shaped with rings of [[cilia]] running round the body, and a tuft of sensory hairs at the upper pole. In some cases females have been known to temporarily [[Offspring|brood]] the larvae using chambers within the arms. While both feeding and non-feeding larvae exist among the four other extant echinoderm classes, all present day crinoids appears to be descendants from a surviving clade that went through a [[Population bottleneck|bottleneck]] after the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event|Permian extinction]], which had lost its feeding larval stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/sj.hdy.6800866 |pmid=16850040 |title=The active evolutionary lives of echinoderm larvae |journal=Heredity |volume=97 |issue=3 |pages=244–52 |year=2006 |last1=Raff |first1=R A |last2=Byrne |first2=M}}&lt;/ref&gt; The larva's free-swimming period lasts only for a few days before settling to the bottom and attaching itself to the underlying surface using an adhesive gland on its ventral surface. The larva then [[metamorphosis|metamorphoses]] into a stalked [[Juvenile (organism)|juvenile]]. Even the free-swimming feather stars sometimes go through this stage, with the adult eventually breaking away from the stalk.&lt;ref name=IZ/&gt; Within 10 to 16 months the crinoid will be able to reproduce.{{citation needed|date=December 2009}}

==Mobility==
[[File:Crinoid and comatule.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|A stalked crinoid (white) and a comatulid (red) in deep sea, showing the differences between these two sister groups]]
Most modern crinoids, i.e., the feather stars, are free-swimming and lack a stem as adults. Examples of fossil crinoids that have been interpreted as free-swimming include ''Marsupitsa'', ''Saccocoma'' and ''Uintacrinus''.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} In 2005, a stalked crinoid was recorded pulling itself along the sea floor off the [[Grand Bahama|Grand Bahama Island]]. While it has been known that stalked crinoids move, before this recording the fastest motion of a crinoid was 0.6 metres/hour (2&amp;nbsp;ft/h) 0.0167&amp;nbsp;cm/s (centimeters per second). The 2005 recording showed a crinoid moving much faster, at a rate of 4-5 centimeters/second (144 to 180 meters per hour).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Baumiller |first1=Tomasz K. |last2=Messing |first2=Charles G. |title=Crawling In Stalked Crinoids: In Situ Observations, Functional Morphology, and Implications for Paleozoic Taxa |booktitle=Geological Society of America Abstracts with Programs |volume=37 |issue=7 |date=6 October 2005 |page=62 |url=https://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2005AM/finalprogram/abstract_96883.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If one ignores the enigmatic ''[[Echmatocrinus]]'' of the [[Burgess Shale]], the earliest known unequivocal crinoid groups date back to the [[Ordovician]]. There are two competing hypotheses pertaining to the origin of the group: the traditional viewpoint holds that crinoids evolved from within the [[blastozoa]]ns (the [[eocrinoid]]s and their derived descendants, the [[blastoids]] and the [[cystoids]]), whereas the most popular alternative suggests that the crinoids split early from among the [[edrioasteroids]].&lt;ref name="Guensburg2010"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1502-3931.2010.00220.x |title=Pelmatozoan arms from the mid-Cambrian of Australia: Bridging the gap between brachioles and brachials?

=== Diversity ===

The crinoids underwent two periods of abrupt [[adaptive radiation]]; the first during the Ordovician, the other was during the early Triassic after they underwent a selective [[P-T extinction|mass extinction]] at the end of the [[Permian]] period.&lt;ref name=Foote1999&gt;{{cite journal

The long and varied geological history of the crinoids demonstrates how well the echinoderms have adapted to filter-feeding. The fossils of other stalked filter-feeding echinoderms, such as blastoids, are also found in rocks of the [[Palaeozoic]] era. These extinct groups can exceed the crinoids in both numbers and variety in certain [[Stratum|strata]]. However, none of these others survived the crisis at the end of the Permian period.

===Fossils===

Some fossil crinoids, such as ''[[Pentacrinites]]'', seem to have lived attached to floating driftwood and complete colonies are often found. Sometimes this driftwood would become waterlogged and sink to the bottom, taking the attached crinoids with it. The stem of ''Pentacrinites'' can be several metres long. Modern relatives of ''Pentacrinites'' live in gentle currents attached to rocks by the end of their stem. The largest fossil crinoid on record had a stem {{Convert|40|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In 2012, three geologists reported they had isolated complex organic molecules from 340-million-year-old ([[Mississippian (geology)|Mississippian]]) fossils of multiple species of crinoids. Identified as "resembl[ing ...] [[aromatic]] or [[polyaromatic]] [[quinone]]s", these are the oldest molecules to be definitively associated with particular individual fossils, as they are believed to have been sealed inside ossicle pores by precipitated calcite during the fossilization process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1130/G33792.1 |laysummary=http://phys.org/news/2013-02-ancient-fossilized-sea-creatures-yield.html |laysource=Phys.org |laydate=Feb 19, 2013|title=Isolation and characterization of the earliest taxon-specific organic molecules (Mississippian, Crinoidea) |journal=Geology |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=347 |year=2013 |last1=O'Malley |first1=C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1500">A '''cyberneticist''' or a '''cybernetician''' is a person who practices [[cybernetics]].

[[Heinz von Foerster]] once told [[Stuart Umpleby]] that [[Norbert Wiener]] preferred the term "cybernetician" rather than "cyberneticist",  perhaps because Wiener was a mathematician rather than a physicist.
On the other hand, [[Nicolas Rashevsky]] who began as a theoretical physicist, as well as [[Robert Rosen (theoretical biologist)|Robert Rosen]] who began his career as a mathematician, regarded  [[Neuro cybernetics]]—and more generally [[Biocybernetics]]—as fields closely allied to [[Mathematical Biology]] and Mathematical Biophysics in which [[control theory]] and [[dynamical system]] theories also play significant roles.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1187">A '''dense heterarchy''' is a [[hierarchical organization]] in [[social insect]] colonies in which the higher levels affect the lower levels and lower levels eventually influence the higher levels.  Individual [[ants]] within the colony network are likely to have many connections with one another – making the network denser and non-hierarchical.  Because there is no highest level within a heterarchy but the heterarchy itself, control is decentralized (not controlled by the queen).  Communication between individuals in a dense heterarchy occurs directly between individuals and through [[stigmergy]].  Feedback loops of communication can produce [[emergent properties]] not obvious when only examining singular activities or communication.&lt;ref&gt;Edward O. Wilson and [[Bert Hölldobler]].  ‘Dense heterarchies and mass communication as the basis of organization in ant colonies.’  TREE.  3:3.  1988.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Camazine, J.L. Deneubourg, N.R.

The '''Discovery District''' is one of the commercial districts in [[Downtown Toronto]], Ontario, Canada. It has a high concentration of hospitals and research institutions, particularly those related to [[biotechnology]]. The district is roughly bounded by [[Bloor Street]] on the north, [[Bay Street]] on the east, [[Dundas Street (Toronto)|Dundas Street]] on the south, and [[Spadina Avenue]] on the west.

==Characteristics==
The area includes the main campus of the [[University of Toronto]], as well as leading health-care facilities such as the [[Hospital for Sick Children]], [[Toronto General Hospital]], [[Princess Margaret Cancer Centre]], [[Mount Sinai Hospital (Toronto)|Mount Sinai Hospital]], [[Toronto Rehabilitation Institute]] and the [[MaRS Discovery District]]. These buildings are concentrated along the section of [[University Avenue (Toronto)|University Avenue]] between Dundas and [[College Street (Toronto)|College Streets]]. An extension of the Discovery District is located at the southwest block of [[Kensington Market]] at the intersection of Dundas and [[Bathurst Street (Toronto)|Bathurst Street]]s, where the [[Krembil Research Institute]] of the [[Toronto Western Hospital]] is located.
[[File:MaRSfromCollege.jpg|thumb|left|[[MaRS Discovery District]] is one of several research institutes located in the Discovery District.]]
This area was subdivided from three main 'park lot' estates: Macaulay Estate (to the east, became a residential district known as '[[The Ward, Toronto|the Ward]]' until demolished), Elmsley Estate (redivided with the Macaulay Estate which was concentrated to the south.  Elmsley estate is closely tied with the history of both the University of Toronto and the commercial district on Yonge Street) and the Powell Estate (became the 'University Park' now the [[University of Toronto]])

A short stretch of Gerrard Street West from Bay Street to LaPlante Avenue was referred to as [[Gerrard Street (Toronto)#Gerrard Village|Gerrard Village]], a Bohemian Greenwich Village like area from the late 19th century to the early 1970s.

This area is referred to by Statistics Canada as census tract 5350035.00. According to the 2011 National Household Survey, 80% of the population surveyed reported an income of over $50 000 annually. This is almost 30% higher than the average provincial income. For the total 2011 population within the discovery district 395 people made between $30 000 ad $39 000 annually, 410 made between $40 000 and $49 000, and 2250 made over $50 000. The accuracy of these figures is questionable due to the National Household Survey being optional, and therefore wealthier people could possibly be over represented. But considering the location in the heart of downtown Toronto and the rapid expansion of condominium build ups, people would have to make more money to live here.

==History==
The original plans for the Town of York (later City of Toronto) divided the City along Lot Street (Queen Street) with a street grid creating small urban 'town lots' to the south and large rectangular 'park lots' (farms) to the north.  The 'park lots' along Lot St (Queen) were given to many of York's (Toronto's) most prominent families who had professions and sometimes even a separate house in the Town and generally did not farm; therefore they often did not clear their lots of the natural forest.  As each 'park lot' extended in a rectangle from Lot Street (Queen) to what would become Bloor,&lt;ref&gt;The Estates of Old Toronto, Liz Lundell, 1997.  {{ISBN|1-55046-219-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; most of the estate houses were built on the north side of Lot Street opposite the Town.  Four 'park lots' (numbers 9 to 12) comprised the area north of Queen just across from the heart of Toronto between Yonge Street and just west of College Avenue (now University Ave).  Three of the families occupying these lots built large estate homes all fairly far north of Lot St (Queen):
* Caer Howell (built for the Welsh [[United Empire Loyalist|Loyalist]] Chief Justice of Upper Canada; [[William Dummer Powell]], later demolished) on College Avenue (now University Avenue).  This lot became the 'University Park' (now University of Toronto).&lt;ref&gt;The Estates of Old Toronto, Liz Lundell, 1997.  {{ISBN|1-55046-219-9}}, Pg 26&lt;/ref&gt;
* Elmsley Villa  (built for another of Upper Canada's Chief Justices and Speaker of the Legislative Assembly; John Elmsley. Was Government House for the short time Toronto was the [[Province of Canada|United Canada's]] capital) this family famously converted to Catholicism and founded [[University of St. Michael's College|St. Michael's College]] on their former 'park lot'.&lt;ref&gt;The Estates of Old Toronto, Liz Lundell, 1997.  {{ISBN|1-55046-219-9}}, Pg 24&lt;/ref&gt;
* Teraulay Cottage (named after the owner [[James Macaulay|Mr. &amp; Mrs. Macauley née Hayter]] who had served as surgeon with Simcoe's Queen's Rangers) later subdivided the estate with a square in the centre onto which fronted Terauley Cottage and Little Trinity Anglican Church (still standing) built on land donated by the family.  This first Toronto residential neighbourhood north of Lot (Queen) was originally called 'Macauleytown' later 'the Ward'.&lt;ref&gt;The Estates of Old Toronto, Liz Lundell, 1997.  {{ISBN|1-55046-219-9}}, Pg 18&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Exterior view, Osgoode Hall - Toronto, Canada - DSC00382.jpg|thumb|[[Osgoode Hall]] was completed in 1834, and presently houses the [[Law Society of Ontario]].]]
The situation of these lots just north of the town meant that this land was in high demand as the city outgrew its original boundaries south of Lot (Queen).  As most Toronto streets started at Lot (Queen), the 'park lots' commanded impressive views into the town and many of the buildings that were built as the 'park lots' were subdivided by their owner, were impressive institutions such as [[Osgoode Hall]] (Upper Canada's Law Courts) still standing, built at the top of York Street by 1832 just two years before the Town of York became a City with the name Toronto.  By the time Toronto became a city in 1834, the area south of Lot St (Queen) from the [[Garrison Creek (Ontario)|Garrison Creek]] to the [[Don River (Ontario)|Don River]] had all been subdivided and the four 'park lots' north of Lot St (Queen) were subdivided by their owners with the eastern lot (Macaulay's estate) becoming the first residential district north of Queen, the western lot (Powell's estate) becoming the 'University Park', gated parkland intended to become Toronto's University&lt;ref&gt;Toronto:  City Life Old &amp; New, [[Mike Filey]], 1979.  {{ISBN|0-919324-40-1}} Pg 46&lt;/ref&gt; and the area between on the north side of Lot St (Queen) attracting various institutions and businesses.

===Development===
The area just north of Lot St (Queen) became something of an institutional area with buildings such as the House of Industry (still standing),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritagetoronto.org/discover-toronto/map/plaque/house-industry |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527174640/http://www.heritagetoronto.org/discover-toronto/map/plaque/house-industry |archivedate=2011-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Armoury (behind Osgoode Hall, now demolished for the University Avenue Court Houses) and the Eaton's Company store to the south (creating 'the cavern' with the Hudson Bay building on the south of Queen St) and the University of Toronto in the 'University Park' to the north which was gated at Queen St &amp; College Ave (University Ave) and was largely forested.  
[[File:The Ward as viewed from Eaton factory.jpg|thumb|left|In the early 1900s, [[The Ward, Toronto|The Ward]], an economically depressed neighbourhood was demolished.]]
By about 1900 there still remained a large residential district called 'The Ward' which became Toronto's first Chinatown but also attracted many attempts to have it demolished as it was economically depressed.  At this time some of Toronto's oldest and most important institutions south of Queen were replaced with larger buildings north of Queen St such as Old City Hall (called 'New' City Hall at this time) at the top of Bay Street&lt;ref&gt;Toronto:  City Life Old &amp; New, [[Mike Filey]], 1979.  {{ISBN|0-919324-40-1}} Pg 30&lt;/ref&gt; and the Ontario Parliament Building; Queen's Park on the University grounds at the top of College Avenue (renamed University Ave).

Part of 'The Ward' had been demolished for the building of New City Hall (Now Old City Hall) and in the years after the first world war, several plans were made to more closely link the institutional area north of Queen with the older town to the south.  Two plans in particular substantially changed this area although both ultimately collapsed with the [[Great Depression]].  University Avenue was extended south of Queen street although the street itself, formerly a large quiet street leading to Queen's Park and the 'University Park' was only slowly turned into the bustling Boulevard of towers and hospitals it is today, none of the Art Deco towers originally planned for the street were ever built. The second plan called for a new 'Federal Avenue' in the middle of the old town's grid (between Bay and York Streets) starting from the new Union Station north to a proposed Government complex on the north side of Queen.&lt;ref&gt;Historical Atlas of Toronto, Derek Hayes, 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-55365-290-8}}, Pg 138&lt;/ref&gt; Many buildings in 'The Ward' were purchased by the government before the plan fell through.  In the 1960s with the City of Toronto annexing the last independent municipalities, 'The Ward' was demolished and a new City Hall was built on the north side of Queen Street between what became Old City Hall and Osgoode Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://torontoist.com/2008/10/historicist_forgotten_urban_squalor_1.php|title=Historicist: Forgotten Urban Squalor of The Ward|last=Torontoist|date=11 October 2008|website=torontoist.com|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Domestic violence within lesbian relationships''' is the pattern of violent and [[coercive]] behavior in a female [[same-sex relationship]] wherein a [[lesbian]] or other [[non-heterosexual]] woman seeks to control the thoughts, beliefs, or conduct of her female intimate partner.&lt;ref name="bornstein"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bornstein | first1 = Danica R. | last2 = Fawcett | first2 = Jake | last3 = Sullivan | first3 = Marianne | last4 = Senturia | first4 = Kirsten D.  | last5 = Shiu-Thornton | first5 = Sharyne | title = Understanding the experiences of lesbian, bisexual and trans survivors of domestic violence: a qualitative study | journal = [[Journal of Homosexuality]] | volume = 51 | issue = 1 | pages = 159–181 | publisher = Taylor and Francis| doi = 10.1300/J082v51n01_08 | date = June 2006 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1300/J082v51n01_08 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of multiple forms of domestic partner abuse, it is also referred to as '''lesbian battering'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Violent Betrayal: Partner Abuse in Lesbian Relationships|last=Renzetti|first=Claire|publisher=Sage Publications|year=1992|isbn=|location=Newbury Park|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prevalence ==
{{further information|Domestic violence#Same-sex relationships}}
The issue of domestic violence among lesbians has become a serious social concern,&lt;ref name="west"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = West | first1 = Carolyn M. | title = Lesbian intimate partner violence: prevalence and dynamics | journal = Journal of Lesbian Studies, special issue: lesbian love and relationships | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 121–127 | publisher = Taylor and Francis | doi = 10.1300/J155v06n01_11 | date = March 2002 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1300/J155v06n01_11 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the topic has often been ignored, both in academic analyses and in the establishment of social services for battered women.&lt;ref name="miller" /&gt;

The ''Encyclopedia of Victimology and Crime Prevention'' states, "For several methodological reasons&amp;nbsp;– nonrandom sampling procedures and self-selection factors, among others&amp;nbsp;– it is not possible to assess the extent of same-sex domestic violence. Studies on abuse between [[gay]] male or lesbian partners usually rely on small convenience samples such as lesbian or gay male members of an association."&lt;ref name="Fisher"&gt;{{cite book| authors=Bonnie S.

Hampton, Thomas P. Gullotta| title = Interpersonal Violence in the African-American Community: Evidence-Based Prevention and Treatment Practices| publisher =[[Springer Science &amp; Business Media]]|year = 2010|page=49|accessdate = August 19, 2014| isbn = 0387295984 |url =https://books.google.com/books?id=IAG1R-ZMmkYC&amp;pg=PA49}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, some researchers commonly assume that lesbian couples experience domestic violence at the same rate as heterosexual couples, and have been more cautious when reporting domestic violence among gay male couples.&lt;ref name="Fisher"/&gt;

The issue of domestic violence among lesbian couples may be underreported due to the social construction of [[gender role]]s that women are expected to play in society; violence perpetrated by women may be ignored due to beliefs that the male social construction itself is a primary source of violence.&lt;ref name="terrance"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Little | first1 = Betsi | last2 = Terrance | first2 = Cheryl | title = Perceptions of domestic violence in lesbian relationships: stereotypes and gender role expectations | journal = [[Journal of Homosexuality]] | volume = 57 | issue = 3 | pages = 429–440 | publisher = Taylor and Francis | doi = 10.1080/00918360903543170 | date = March 2010 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00918360903543170 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The social construction of women is characterized as passive, dependent, nurturing, and highly emotional, and the social construction of men is characterized as competitive, aggressive, strong, and even prone to violence. Due to forms of [[discrimination]], [[homophobia]], and [[heterosexism]], and the belief that heterosexuality is normative within society, domestic violence has been characterized as being between the male perpetrator and the female victim.&lt;ref name="west" /&gt; This contributes to the invisibility of all domestic violence perpetrated by women. Further, the fear of reinforcing negative [[stereotype]]s could lead some community members, activists, and victims to deny the extent of violence among lesbians.&lt;ref name="groscup"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = Michael J. | last2 = Groscup | first2 = Jennifer | title = Perceptions of same-sex domestic violence among crisis center staff | journal = Journal of Family Violence | volume = 24 | issue = 2 | pages = 87–93 | publisher = Springer | doi = 10.1007/s10896-008-9212-5 | date = February 2009 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10896-008-9212-5 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social service agencies are often unwilling to assist victims of domestic violence perpetrated by women.&lt;ref name="groscup"/&gt; Victims of domestic violence in lesbian relationships are less likely to have the case prosecuted within a legal system.&lt;ref name="miller"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Miller | first1 = Diane Helene | last2 = Greene | first2 = Kathryn | last3 = Causby | first3 = Vickie | last4 = White | first4 = Barbara W. | last5 = Lockhart | first5 = Lettie L. | title = Domestic violence in lesbian relationships | journal = [[Women &amp; Therapy]] | volume = 23 | issue = 3 | pages = 107–127 | publisher = Taylor and Francis | doi = 10.1300/J015v23n03_08 | date = October 2001 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1300/J015v23n03_08 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to overcome the denial of domestic violence in lesbian relationships, advocates for abused women often concentrate on similarities between homosexual and heterosexual domestic violence. The main goal of activists is to legitimize lesbian domestic violence as real abuse and validate the experience of its victims.&lt;ref name="miller"/&gt;

=== Other factors of unreliability ===
Literature and research regarding domestic violence in lesbian relationships is relatively limited, especially in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Many different factors play into this, such as "different definitions of domestic violence, non-random, self selected and opportunistic sampling methods (often organisation or agency based, or advertising for participants who have experienced violence) and different methods and types of data collected".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Irwin|first=Jude|date=2008|title=(Dis)counted Stories: Domestic Violence and Lesbians|url=http://0-qsw.sagepub.com.helin.uri.edu/content/7/2/199.full.pdf+html?|journal=Qualitative Social Work 7.2|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This causes results to be unreliable, thus making it difficult to make general assumptions about the rates of lesbian domestic violence. This has caused rates of violence in lesbian relationships to range from 17 to 73 percent as of the 1990s, being too large of a scale to accurately determine the pervasiveness of lesbian abuse in the community.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Since not all lesbians are open about their sexuality, large random samples are difficult to obtain and therefore are unable to show trends in the general lesbian community.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Research samples tend to be smaller, causing report rates of violence to be lower than they may be. This is "a consequence of the invisibility of such violence and fear of homophobic reactions".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Theoretical analysis of domestic violence in lesbian relationships is heavily debated. Popular approaches mainly discuss "the comparability of violence in lesbian and gay male relationships (same sex violence,) or draw on feminist theories of gendered power relations, comparing domestic violence between lesbians and heterosexual women".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some theorists also study same sex violence by defining gender as anatomy, and claim that gender is not relevant in any case of domestic violence due to its prevalence in same-sex relationships that is perpetrated as a form of homophobic behavior and occurs without consequence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Other theorists argue that gay men and lesbians still internalize feminine and masculine behaviors, causing lesbians to "mimic traditional heterosexual relationships" and create blatant power dynamics between dominant and submissive partners.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Forms ==

The scope of domestic violence among lesbian relationships displays the pattern of intimidation, coercion, terrorism, or violence that achieves enhanced power and control for the perpetrator over her partner.&lt;ref name="miller" /&gt; The forms of domestic violence in lesbian relationships include physical abuse, such as hitting, choking, using weapons, or restraining, often referred to as "battering"; emotional abuse, such as lying, neglecting, and degrading; intimidation threats, such as threats to harm the victim, their family, or their pets; sexual abuse, such as forcing sex or refusing safe sex; destruction of property, such as vandalizing the home and damaging furniture, clothing, or personal objects; economic, such as controlling the victim's money and forcing financial dependence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bimbi | first1 = David S. | last2 = Palmadessa | first2 = Nancy A. | last3 = Parsons | first3 = Jeffrey T. | title = Substance use and domestic violence among urban gays, lesbians and bisexuals | journal = Journal of LGBT Health Research | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = 1–7 | publisher = Taylor and Francis | doi = 10.1300/J463v03n02_01 | date = 2008 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1300/J463v03n02_01 | ref= harv | postscript= .}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, psychological abuse was found to be common among lesbian victims. Findings from studies have shown that slapping was most the commonly reported form of abuse, while beatings and assaults with weapons were less frequent.&lt;ref name="west" /&gt; Sexual violence within lesbian relationships was found to be as high as 55%. The most frequent type included forced kissing, breast, and genital fondling, and oral, anal, or vaginal penetration. Eighty percent of victims reported psychological abuse and verbal abuse. Lesbians are also less likely to use physical force or threats than gay men.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women-Identified Women|last=Darty|first=Trudy|last2=Potter|first2=Sandee|publisher=Mayfield|year=1984|isbn=|location=Palo Alto|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contributing factors ==

===General===
Factors that contribute to domestic violence include the belief that abuse (physical or verbal) is acceptable, substance abuse, unemployment, mental health problems, lack of coping skills, isolation, and excessive dependence on the abuser.&lt;ref name="Newman p. 11"&gt;{{citation | last1 = Newman | first1 = Willis C. | last2 = Newman | first2 = Esmeralda | contribution = What is domestic violence?

Also homophobia is an important factor in shaping the experience of domestic violence in lesbian relationships.&lt;ref name="bornstein" /&gt; For instance, mental health agencies still contain homophobic and heterosexual beliefs which limit the extent of the services provided to the victims.&lt;ref name="groscup" /&gt; These victims experience violence within the context of a world that is not only misogynistic but is also homophobic.&lt;ref name="bornstein" /&gt;

=== Stigma towards lesbians ===
Lesbian couples frequently experience [[Sexual stigma|social stigma]] against them, including experiences of discrimination and bias against them, as well as other minority stress factors which can include the fear of [[outing]], [[internalized homophobia]], the butch/femme identity, and relationship quality.&lt;ref name="balsam"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Balsam | first1 = Kimberly F. | last2 = Szymanski | first2 = Dawn M. | title = Relationship quality and domestic violence in women's same-sex relationships: the role of minority stress | journal = [[Psychology of Women Quarterly]] | volume = 29 | issue = 3 | pages = 258–269 | publisher = Sage | doi = 10.1111/j.1471-6402.2005.00220.x | date = September 2005 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-6402.2005.00220.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Internalized homophobia  ===
A perpetrator may use her partner's internalized homophobia to justify her own violence. This may cause a general distaste or negative conception of the lesbian identity, both of oneself and others. This behavior is described as horizontal hostility, or minority groups becoming hostile or violent toward each other.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Homophobia: A Weapon of Sexism|last=Pharr|first=Suzanne|publisher=Chardon|year=1988|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This stems from both finding it easier to direct hatred toward other oppressed groups and internalized homophobia and misogyny. In the case of domestic violence in lesbian relationships, this hostility is perpetuated in the form of intimate partner abuse.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In some cases, the lesbian community can dismiss cases of domestic violence in lesbian relationships or shame victims of domestic violence.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Naming the Violence: Speaking Out About Lesbian Battering|last=Lobel|first=Kerry|publisher=Seal|year=1986|isbn=|location=Seattle|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This contributes to low self-esteem, feelings of powerlessness, denial of group membership, and difficulty being in committed and trusting relationships. These negative feelings are then acted out in the form of lesbian battering. Also women fear that they might suffer from isolation, risk of losing their job, housing or family as consequences to homophobia and internalized homophobia.&lt;ref name="bornstein" /&gt; A woman who abuses her female partner can use homophobic control as a method of psychological abuse, which further isolates the victim.&lt;ref name="west" /&gt; For example, an abuser may out her partner without permission by revealing her sexual orientation to others, including relatives, employers, and landlords, and in child custody cases. This form of abuse could result in a variety of negative consequences for the victim, such as being shunned by family members and the loss of children, a job, and housing. In fearing isolation due to homophobia, lesbians also experience the phenomenon of living in the "second closet", or that they must keep both their sexualities and experiences with domestic violence hidden from others due to fear of negative repercussions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These homophobic roots also integrate themselves into how lesbians raise their children.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lesbian Couples: Creating Healthy Relationships for the '90's|last=Clunis|first=Merilee|last2=Green|first2=Dorsey|publisher=Seal|year=1993|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Past experiences with domestic violence and abuse ===
Many lesbians who are either battered or batter have had experience with domestic violence and sexual assault, often familial or as a child, including beatings, incest, molestation, and verbal abuse.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In growing up in living situations where violence is "normalized", the partner often does not label the problem or recognize that the violence within the relationship is an issue. This can also translate into how the couple raise potential children and implement discipline.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Power and control ===
{{See also|Abusive power and control}}
Domestic violence in lesbian relationships happens for many reasons. Domestic violence can occur due to control. Violence is most frequently employed as a tactic for achieving interpersonal power or control over their partner.&lt;ref name="miller" /&gt; Also perceived loss of power or control may also lead to increased violence within the relationship. The alienation and isolation imposed by internalized and external oppression may construct loss of control, and the need to reclaim it becomes the central concern for lesbians. Lesbians may be denied control over numerous aspects of their lives.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, if she remains in the closet, she is also denied control, subjected to continuous self-monitoring, and forced to deal with stress so that she could hide her identity and her intimate relationship from the eyes of others. The perpetrator of violence in an intimate relationship can also threaten their partner to abduct their children if only one has legal custody of their children.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; On the contrary, there have also been cases of lesbians and lesbian couples that become ''guardian ad litems'' and households that have been licensed to provide temporary foster care for children that are vulnerable to domestic violence.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Power and control take advantage the most intimate parts of lesbian relationships, including sex life and the individual agency of the victim in the relationship.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Dependency and self-esteem factors ===
Another reason why domestic violence can occur is dependency.&lt;ref name="miller" /&gt; The need to achieve balance between separateness and connection has been identified as the primary task in relationships, and is a specifically frequent problem in lesbian relationships.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The degree of dependence on a relationship and on one's intimate partner causes abuse. Lesbians who report more frequent use of violent tactics in conflict with their partner will report a higher level of dependency as a personality trait.

Dependency in lesbian relationships is also a result of female-specific socialization.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Since women have been socialized for "togetherness" and cooperative living, women often struggle with balancing social life and being alone. A study found that lesbians are more likely to spend free time at home than homosexual men are.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In lesbian relationships, women often find it difficult to spend time apart because they feel pressured to take care of one another. Women may assume that spending time away from their partner would make them upset or angry. Without proper communication, improper management of time may lead to unhealthy discourse within a relationship, and partner equality remains difficult to maintain.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Self-esteem]] is another underlying factor of domestic abuse. Low self-esteem and a negative self-image are qualities that characterize both perpetrators and victims of heterosexual domestic violence. The jealousy and the possessiveness that are frequently linked to battering behavior are associated with problems of low self-esteem and negative self-concept. Lesbians who report more frequent use of violent tactics in conflicts with their partners will report a lower level of self-esteem as a personality trait.&lt;ref name="miller" /&gt;

== Erasure of homosexuality in domestic violence shelters ==
Domestic violence shelters also provide heterocentric services for battered women, which further isolates battered lesbians and silences the pervasiveness of domestic violence in lesbian relationships. The perpetrator of violence in an abusive relationship is often assumed to be male, while the victim of the violence is assumed to be straight.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These services can be improved by ensuring that the case statement of an agency unit is LGBTQ friendly, providing training services for faculty and staff at shelters, making sure that all services does not have heterosexist language, and providing opportunities for lesbians to take leadership positions in these endeavors.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Fond du Lac County Jane Doe''' is an unidentified female discovered on November 23, 2008, in [[Ashford, Wisconsin|Ashford]], [[Fond du Lac County, Wisconsin|Fond du Lac County]], [[Wisconsin]]. She has yet to be identified, although many efforts have been made to discover who she was. Investigators believe that it is possible that she may not have been from the area.&lt;ref name=nightmare/&gt;&lt;ref name=baffles&gt;{{cite news|title=Cold Cases: Wisconsin Jane Doe baffles detective|url=http://www.wisconsinrapidstribune.com/article/20130801/WRT019804/308010354/Cold-Cases-Wisconsin-Jane-Doe-baffles-detective-video-|accessdate=25 July 2014|agency=Wisconsin Rapids Tribune|date=1 August 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140727214821/http://www.wisconsinrapidstribune.com/article/20130801/WRT019804/308010354/Cold-Cases-Wisconsin-Jane-Doe-baffles-detective-video-|archivedate=27 July 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her face was reconstructed digitally by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in 2009 and again in 2018 to give an approximation of how she may have appeared in life. The victim was between fifteen and twenty-one years old when she died, placing her year of birth between 1987 and 1994.&lt;ref name=ncmec/&gt;

==Discovery==

The remains of a young woman were found frozen in a creek by hunters on November 23, 2008, in [[Fond du Lac County, Wisconsin]], near an abandoned farm.&lt;ref name=Unraveling&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hicks|first1=Brad|title=Unraveling the Jane Doe Mystery|url=http://fox6now.com/2012/02/29/unraveling-the-jane-doe-mystery/|accessdate=25 July 2014|publisher=Fox News|date=29 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; To extract the body, investigators were forced to chisel away the ice and scuba divers searched the bottom for evidence.&lt;ref name=baffles/&gt; Some articles of clothing were found, including a strapless Zoey Beth black and pink top with a pink bow, originating from [[Family Dollar]], distributed in the spring of 2008.&lt;ref name=nightmare/&gt;&lt;ref name=network&gt;{{cite web|title=Case File 764UFWI|url=http://doenetwork.org/cases/764ufwi.html|publisher=[[The Doe Network]]|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="more" /&gt; The underclothing that she wore, also from Family Dollar, was shipped only between July 1 and July 15, 2008.&lt;ref name=Unraveling/&gt;&lt;ref name=mia/&gt; Her jeans were that of the [[Angels Jeanswear|Angels]] brand and the bottom of the legs had been rolled up, somewhat, and an elastic [[ponytail]] holder was found on her [[wrist]].&lt;ref name=Unraveling/&gt;&lt;ref name="abc buried"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Caron|first1=Christina|title=Jane Doe Buried After Three Year Probe Hits Dead End|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/jane-doe-buried-years-body-discovered/story?id=15120619|accessdate=25 July 2014|agency=[[20/20 (U.S. TV series)|20/20 News]]|publisher=ABC News|date=9 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No [[sock]]s or [[shoe]]s were found at the scene. Initially, no [[jewelry]] was found, until a penny-sized St. Benedict medal was found by divers, but it may not have belonged to her, as examiners could not be certain how long it had been in the water. However, some reports claim that a [[bracelet]] containing several [[pendant]]s was also found on the girl's remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fond Du Lac (sic) Wisconsin Jane Doe November 2008|url=http://www.canyouidentifyme.org/FondDuLacWisconsinJaneDoeNovember2008|website=canyouidentifyme.org|accessdate=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hair was a shoulder-length light brown, possibly having [[hair highlighting|hair highlights]] due to having some different shades.&lt;ref name=Unraveling/&gt;&lt;ref name=network/&gt; The clothing had caused some issues with investigators, as many of the different articles were in various sizes.&lt;ref name=mia/&gt; It has been determined, however, that she was most likely around 120 pounds.&lt;ref name="more" /&gt;

==Examination==

[[File:Fond Du Lac Reconstruction 004a.jpg|thumb|left|Another artist's rendering of the Jane Doe, incorporating the clothing she was found wearing.]]

Determining the cause of death was inconclusive, as the severe [[decomposition]] on the body had removed all signs of possible violence from the remains. However, the case is believed to have been a murder, as [[suicide]] was eliminated as a possibility of the girl's death. The circumstances of the location of the remains had also sparked suspicion among authorities.&lt;ref name=go/&gt; Toxicology tests were conducted to see if any drugs or alcohol had been in her system, yet the results were never released.&lt;ref name=nightmare/&gt;&lt;ref name=mia/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Plummer|first1=Russell|title=Trail Goes Cold: No ID for Murder Victim Found in Ashford Creek|accessdate=6 August 2015|work=News Makers|agency=The Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=order&gt;{{cite news|last1=Netter|first1=Sarah|title=Detectives Get Court Order to Post Facebook Page of Dead Girl|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=8373710|accessdate=25 July 2014|publisher=ABC News|date=20 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the body was found in [[autumn]], she had died in the [[summer]], two to four months previously. This was established by [[forensic entomology|examining traces from insects]] that were found on the remains.&lt;ref name=Unraveling/&gt; She had an [[overbite]], and some fillings and dental sealants were found on the upper molars with no current cavities. The overbite was not described as extreme, but may have been noticeable, which could be a reliable feature depicted in her [[forensic facial reconstruction|facial reconstruction]]. The estimated height was between 4'10" and 5'4", the victim being between fifteen and twenty-one years old and weighing between 110 to 135 pounds, at an "average frame".&lt;ref name=Unraveling/&gt; Examiners believe she was either [[White people|white]] or [[Hispanic]], although [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] and [[Asian people|Asian]] races cannot be ruled out.&lt;ref name=mia/&gt;&lt;ref name=namus&gt;{{cite web|title=NamUs UP # 3043|url=https://www.namus.gov/UnidentifiedPersons/Case#/3043|website=NamUs|publisher=[[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]]|accessdate=30 November 2014|date=22 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also may have been [[biracial]]. Other physical characteristics included a healed rib fracture and being [[pigeon toed]] or [[knock-kneed]], which may have been noticeable when she walked, as her feet were slanted inward.&lt;ref name=Unraveling/&gt;&lt;ref name=order/&gt; She also suffered from [[spina bifida occulta]], but may have been unaware of the condition.&lt;ref name=ncmec/&gt; 

To obtain DNA information, her [[femur]] was transported to the [[University of Texas]].&lt;ref name=baffles/&gt; The victim's dental records were also recorded to compare to missing persons.&lt;ref name="more" /&gt;

==Investigation==

At least 200 leads have been explored into discovering the identity of the victim.&lt;ref name=go&gt;{{cite news|last1=Caron|first1=Christina|title=Jane Doe Buried After Three Year Probe Hits Dead End|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/jane-doe-buried-years-body-discovered/story?id=15120619|accessdate=7 March 2016|work=ABC Go|publisher=ABC|date=9 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[forensic facial reconstruction|computer-generated reconstruction]] was created from the [[skull]] by the [[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]] from [[morgue|mortuary]] photographs and a CT scan of the skull that were submitted to the center.&lt;ref name=nightmare&gt;{{cite web| title=Unidentified murder victim a 'total nightmare' case for detectives| url=http://www.fdlreporter.com/article/20130804/FON019804/308040064/Unidentified-murder-victim-total-nightmare-case-detectives| accessdate=18 April 2014| first=Adam| last=Rodewald| date=5 August 2013| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714184728/http://www.fdlreporter.com/article/20130804/FON019804/308040064/Unidentified-murder-victim-total-nightmare-case-detectives| archivedate=14 July 2015| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Unraveling/&gt;&lt;ref name=mia&gt;{{cite web| title=Fond Du Lac (sic) Wisconsin Jane Doe November 2008| url=http://www.missinginamerica.us/apps/blog/categories/show/1555811-fond-du-lac-wisconsin-jane-doe-november-2008| accessdate=21 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reconstruction of the victim generated over two hundred tips that did not produce solid leads, as the composite apparently resembled a large number of missing people.&lt;ref name=baffles/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Buried Without My Name|url=http://www.missinginamerica.us/apps/blog/categories/show/1555811-fond-du-lac-wisconsin-jane-doe-november-2008 |publisher=Missing in America |accessdate=25 July 2014|date=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former missing person [[Ariel Castro kidnappings|Amanda Berry]], one of several possible identities of the Jane Doe, was ruled out by DNA analysis.

Besides Amanda Berry, two other individuals that were eventually located were also ruled out of the case: Connie McCallister and Brittany Peart.&lt;ref name=namus/&gt; McCallister, native to Wisconsin, was abducted at age 16 and taken to Mexico. She was eventually recovered alive after meeting a "church missionary" that reported the find to the [[National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Connie McCallister, Wis. woman who disappeared in 2004, found in Mexico; family says she was drugged, forced there|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/connie-mccallister-wis-woman-who-disappeared-in-2004-found-in-mexico-family-says-she-was-drugged-forced-there/|accessdate=6 August 2015|work=Crimesider|publisher=CBS|date=8 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brittany Peart disappeared in July 2008 from Elkton, Maryland.

The Jane Doe's body was buried in 2011 after the investigation turned cold.&lt;ref name=nightmare/&gt;&lt;ref name="abc buried"/&gt; Television shows such as ''[[America's Most Wanted]]'' were contacted to broadcast the case to possibly reveal new clues.&lt;ref name="more" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jane Doe services held next month|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7UF-XtBGw8|accessdate=30 November 2014|work=WLUK-TV FOX 11|publisher=Fox|date=27 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Facebook]] page was also created to generate leads for the case.&lt;ref name=order/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Woman Known As Jane Doe Buried In Fond du Lac County|url=http://www.wisn.com/Woman-Known-As-Jane-Doe-Buried-In-Fond-du-Lac-County/8043846#!bmgkOd|accessdate=25 July 2014|agency=WISN 12|publisher=ABC News|date=7 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lyle|first1=D.P.|title=Fond Du Lac (sic) Jane Doe: A Unique Method for Corpse ID|url=http://writersforensicsblog.wordpress.com/2009/08/22/fond-du-lac-jane-doe-a-unique-method-for-corpse-id/|accessdate=25 July 2014|date=22 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 23, 2018, a revised reconstruction was released and plans to exhume the victim for isotope testing and DNA phenotyping to predict geographical locations where she may have originated and to develop a clearer estimation of her ethnicity and physical characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New Developments in FDL County Jane Doe Investigation|url=http://www.sunny977.com/2018/04/23/4-23-18-new-developments-in-fdl-county-jane-doe-investigation/|accessdate=23 April 2018|work=Sunny997|date=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Frontier Middle School shooting''' was a [[school shooting]] that occurred on February 2, 1996, at Frontier Middle School in [[Moses Lake, Washington]], United States. The gunman, 14-year-old Barry Dale Loukaitis ({{IPAc-en|l|uː|ˈ|k|aɪ|t|ɪ|s}}; born February 26, 1981), killed his algebra teacher and two students, and held his classmates hostage before a gym coach subdued Loukaitis.

==Shooting==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}
On the day of the shooting, Loukaitis was dressed as a [[Wild West]]-style [[gunslinger]] and was wearing a black [[duster (clothing)|duster]]. He was armed with a [[.30-30 Winchester|.30–30 caliber]] hunting rifle and two handguns ([[.357 Magnum|.357 caliber]] revolver and [[.25 ACP|.25 caliber]] [[semiautomatic pistol]]) that belonged to his father, and was carrying approximately 78 rounds of ammunition.

Loukaitis walked from his house to his school, where he had entered his [[algebra]] classroom during fifth period. He opened fire at students, killing two, Arnold Fritz and Manuel Vela, Jr., both fourteen. Another student, 13-year-old Natalie Hintz, sustained critical gunshot wounds to the right arm and abdomen, and was airlifted to [[Harborview Medical Center]] in Seattle.

Loukaitis then fatally shot his algebra teacher Leona Caires in the chest. As his classmates began to panic, Loukaitis reportedly said, "This sure beats the hell out of algebra, doesn't it?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/14/us/where-rampages-begin-special-report-adolescent-angst-shooting-up-schools.html|title=WHERE RAMPAGES BEGIN: A special report.; From Adolescent Angst To Shooting Up Schools|last=Egan|first=Timothy|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which is often erroneously reported as a quote from the [[Stephen King]] novel ''[[Rage (Stephen King novel)|Rage]]''. Teacher and coach Jon Lane entered the classroom upon hearing the gunshots to find Loukaitis holding his classmates hostage. He planned to use one hostage so he could safely exit the school. Lane volunteered as the hostage, and Loukaitis kept him at gunpoint with his rifle. Lane then grabbed the weapon from Loukaitis and wrestled him to the ground, later assisting in the [[emergency evacuation|evacuation]] of students.

Lane kept Loukaitis subdued until police arrived at the scene.

==Trial==
In June 1996, the Spokane Court of Appeals were to come to a decision whether 15-year-old Barry Loukaitis should be [[tried as an adult]] or juvenile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=August 27, 1996 |title=Hearing delayed for suspect in Moses Lake shooting deaths |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19960827&amp;slug=2346162 |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |accessdate=June 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 2, three members of the Spokane Court of Appeals convinced Judge Evan Sperline to allow court-appointed psychiatrist Joan Petrich to present a testimony based on Loukaitis' mental health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=July 3, 1996 |title=Moses Lake trial to be open |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19960703&amp;slug=2337537 |work=The Seattle Times |accessdate=June 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trial was later moved to [[Seattle, Washington]] due to media publicity. Loukaitis had [[insanity plea|pleaded insanity]] on all charges against him,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=September 2, 1997 |title=Loukaitis trial resumes today |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19970902&amp;slug=2558026 |work=The Seattle Times |accessdate=June 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and claimed that "mood swings" were the cause of his violent actions. During his trial, Joan Petrich testified that Loukaitis had been experiencing [[delusion]]al and [[messiah|messianic]] thoughts before the shooting. She had stated, "He felt like he was God and would laugh to himself. He felt he was superior to other people, and then those feelings were later replaced by hate, disdain, and not measuring up."

Prosecutors Donna Wise and John Knodell argued that Loukaitis had carefully planned the shooting,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Fitten |first1=Ronald K. |last2=Santana |first2=Arthur |date=September 25, 1997 |title=Teen's trial a no-win case |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19970925&amp;slug=2562274 |work=The Seattle Times |accessdate=June 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; getting ideas from the [[Pearl Jam]] song ''[[Jeremy (song)|Jeremy]]''. The music video from ''Jeremy'' shows a troubled youth committing suicide in front of his teacher and classmates, although it was largely believed that "Jeremy" had opened fire on the class. This has been widely misunderstood because [[MTV]] had strong anti violence imagery rules. The original video showed the child putting the gun into his mouth, however the only images allowed to air were those of the children covered in his blood. Prosecution also said that he had gotten ideas from the [[Stephen King]] novel ''[[Rage (Stephen King novel)|Rage]]'' and the films ''[[Natural Born Killers]]'' and ''[[The Basketball Diaries (film)|The Basketball Diaries]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Coleman |first=Loren |title=The Copycat Effect: How the Media and Popular Culture Trigger the Mayhem in Tomorrow's Headlines |publisher=Paraview Pocket Books |isbn=1-4165-0554-7 |date=2004 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loukaitis has also stated that he tried to model his life after the novel ''Rage'''s [[protagonist]] Charlie Decker, who kills two teachers and takes his algebra class hostage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/1996/apr/10/school-killings-all-too-familiar-moses-lake/|title=School Killings All Too Familiar Moses Lake Horror Parallels Plot Of Novel Found In Suspect’s Room|last=Harris|first=Bonnie|date=April 10, 1996|accessdate=June 29, 2017|publisher=The Spokesman Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 24, 1997, Loukaitis was convicted of two counts of [[first-degree murder]], one count of [[second-degree murder]], one count of first-degree [[attempted murder]], and 16 counts of aggravated kidnapping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=November 1, 1996 |title=Kidnapping charges added in Moses Lake murder case |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19961101&amp;slug=2357382 |work=The Seattle Times |accessdate=June 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=December 25, 1996 |title=Teen faces King Co. trial in Moses Lake slayings |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19961225&amp;slug=2366756 |work=The Seattle Times |accessdate=June 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was sentenced to serve two [[life imprisonment|life sentence]]s and an additional 205 years without the possibility of [[parole]]. He is currently imprisoned at the [[Clallam Bay Corrections Center]] in Washington State. The Washington State [[Appellate court|Court of Appeals]] denied Loukaitis's request for a new trial in 1999.

=== Re-sentencing ===
The [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in 2012 that people convicted of murder they committed under 16 years of age could not receive life terms without parole. Loukaitis was heard for a re-sentencing in 2017, during which he apologized for the first time, in a letter to the Grant County Superior Court. He was re-sentenced to 189 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Geranios |first=Nicholas K. |date=April 14, 2017 |title=Barry Loukaitis, Moses Lake school shooter, breaks silence with apology |url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/barry-loukaitis-moses-lake-school-shooter-apologizes-in-1st-remarks/ |work=The Seattle Times |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=April 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perpetrator and motives==
In the year prior to the shooting, the Loukaitis family was facing various [[Dysfunctional family|dysfunctional]] issues.&lt;ref name=parents&gt;{{cite news |last=Fitten |first=Ronald K. |date=September 9, 1997 |title=Loukaitis jurors hear parents, see Pearl Jam video |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19970909&amp;slug=2559355 |work=The Seattle Times |accessdate=June 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loukaitis' parents separated in 1995, after his mother discovered her husband was having an affair. She filed for divorce against her husband in January 1996. His mother, Jo Ann Phillips, was a domineering woman who became increasingly distant and began speaking of suicide. She would frequently imply that her son Barry would also have to kill himself, and that the date of the double-suicide would be on [[Valentine's Day]] of 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Andersen |first=Peggy |date=September 8, 1997 |title=Loukaitis' mother says she told son of plan to kill herself |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19970908&amp;slug=2559214 |work=The Seattle Times |accessdate=June 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barry talked his mother out of doing so, by having her write down her feelings.&lt;ref name=parents/&gt;

=== Mental illness ===
Psychologists hired by the defense believed Loukaitis suffered from either [[depression (mood)|depression]] or [[bipolar disorder]], while prosecution witness Dr. Alan Unis, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the University of Washington, diagnosed him with [[dysthymic disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/1997/sep/17/loukaitis-knew-shooting-wrong-psychiatrist-says/ |title=Loukaitis Knew Shooting Wrong, Psychiatrist Says|date=September 17, 1997|accessdate=June 29, 2017|publisher=The Spokesman Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/1996/sep/26/prosecutor-loukaitis-is-faking-attacks-defense/|title=Prosecutor: Loukaitis Is Faking Attacks Defense Witnesses That Depression Behind Shootings|last=Miller|first=William|date=September 26, 1996|accessdate=June 29, 2017|publisher=The Spokesman Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loukaitis suffered from [[hyperactivity]], and was taking [[Ritalin]] at the time of the shooting. He also suffered from [[clinical depression]], a mental illness present in the last three generations of the Loukaitis family, and last four generations of the Phillips family.

Loukaitis claimed that he only intended on killing Manuel Vela,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=September 4, 1997 |title=Murder trial jurors hear Loukaitis' confession |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-3946562.html |work=The Seattle Times |via=HighBeam |accessdate=June 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=April 18, 1996 |title=Moses Lake boy tells of killing three at school |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19960418&amp;slug=2324774 |work=The Seattle Times |accessdate=June 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the other deaths were accidental.

A '''grave candle''', '''grave lantern''', '''death candle''' or a '''death lantern''' is a type of [[candle]] or [[lantern]], which is lit in memory of the dead or to commemorate solemn events. The form of a lantern is commonly used in [[Christianity]], whereas candles are more common in [[Judaism]] (where they are known as the [[Yahrzeit candle]]).

The tradition has been adopted by Christianity from the earlier [[paganism|pagan]] tradition.&lt;ref name=tvp/&gt;

The grave lanterns, known as ''znicz'', are a common tradition in [[Poland]].&lt;ref name=tvp&gt;http://www.tvp.pl/bialystok/aktualnosci/spoleczne/zaduszkowe-tradycje/8984919&lt;/ref&gt;

'''HMS ''D2''''' was one of eight [[British D-class submarine|D-class submarine]] built for the [[Royal Navy]] during the first decade of the 20th century.

==Description==
The D-class submarines were designed as improved and enlarged versions of the preceding [[British C-class submarine|C class]], with [[diesel engine]]s replacing the dangerous [[petrol engine]]s used earlier. ''D2'' was slightly smaller than her sister ships and had a length of {{convert|162|ft|1|in|m|1}} [[length overall|overall]], a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|20|ft|6|in|m|1}} and a mean [[draft (ship)|draught]] of {{convert|10|ft|10|in|m|1}}. She [[displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{convert|489|LT|t}} on the surface and {{convert|603|LT|t}} submerged.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt; The D-class submarines had a crew of 25 officers and [[other ranks (UK)|other ranks]] and were the first to adopt [[saddle tank (submarine)|saddle tanks]].&lt;ref name=gg9&gt;Gardiner &amp; Gray, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

For surface running, the boats were powered by two {{convert|600|bhp|lk=in|0|adj=on}} diesels, each driving one [[propeller shaft]]. When submerged each propeller was driven by a {{convert|275|hp|0|adj=on}} [[electric motor]]. They could reach {{convert|14|kn|lk=in}} on the surface and {{convert|9|kn}} underwater. On the surface, the D class had a range of {{convert|2500|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|10|kn}}.&lt;ref name=gg9/&gt;

The boats were armed with three [[British 18 inch torpedo|18-inch (45&amp;nbsp;cm)]] [[torpedo tube]]s, two in the bow and one in the stern. They carried one reload for each tube, a total of six torpedoes.&lt;ref name=gg9/&gt;

==Construction and career==
''D2'' was [[laid down]] by [[Vickers]] on 10 July 1909 at their [[Barrow-in-Furness|Barrow]] shipyard and commissioned on 29 March 1911. During her career, ''D2'' returned from the second [[Heligoland Bight]] patrol along with {{HMS|D3||2}}, {{HMS|E5||2}} and {{HMS|E7||2}}. On 28 August 1914, ''D2'', ''D3'' and {{HMS|D8||2}} fought in the [[Battle of Heligoland Bight (1914)|Battle of Heligoland Bight]]. Then, two days before ''D2'' met her fate, [[Lieutenant commander|Lieutenant Commander]] Jameson was washed overboard off [[Harwich Dockyard|Harwich]]. Lt. Cdr. Head was his replacement. ''D2'' was rammed and sunk by a German patrol boat off [[Borkum]] on 25 November 1914, leaving no survivors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23326">'''[[Taxidermy]]''', or the process of preserving animal skin together with its feathers, fur, or scales, is an art whose existence has been short compared to forms such as painting, sculpture, and music. The word derives from two Greek words: ''taxis'', meaning order, preparation, and arrangement and ''derma'', meaning skin. Directly translated, taxidermy means "skin art".

According to John W. Moyer, a staff member at the Chicago [[Field Museum of Natural History]] famous for his comprehensive studies on the development of this process, in his book ''Practical Taxidermy'', the modern form of taxidermy greatly differs from the taxidermy of antiquity.&lt;ref name="refname1"/&gt;  In ancient times, although considered some form of "art", it was a process of animal preservation; in contrast, modern taxidermy methods seek to produce lifelike mounts of wildlife by accurately modeling the [[anatomy]] of animal specimens as they might appear in their natural habitat.&lt;ref name="refname1"/&gt; According to Albert B. Farnham, in his book ''Home Taxidermy for Pleasure and Profit'', although its methods greatly differ over time, the art reveals that there existed then as now the desire to preserve the trophy of the hunter’s prowess and skill in natural objects &lt;ref name="refname2"/&gt;

==Early forms of taxidermy==

===Ancient Egyptians===
As documented in Frederick H. Hitchcock's 19th-century manual entitled ''Practical Taxidermy'', the earliest known taxidermists were the ancient [[Egyptians#History|Egyptians]] and despite the fact that they never removed skins from animals as a whole, it was the Egyptians who developed one of the world's earliest forms of animal preservation through the use of injections, spices, oils, and other [[embalming]] tools.&lt;ref name="refname3"/&gt; As early as 2200 BC, they embalmed the bodies of dogs, cats, monkeys, birds, sheep, oxen, and any other pets of Egyptian royalty and buried them in their [[Pharaoh]]'s [[tomb]].&lt;ref name="refname1"/&gt; This art of embalming was effective, not for the purpose of having the specimens look natural or for exhibition, but to satisfy the tradition of the times.&lt;ref name="refname2"/&gt; Likewise, according to Thomas Brown, a 19th-century naturalist and malacologist, "Egyptian preservation attempts were prepared in such a manner as to produce no pleasurable sensations in examining them; instead, they were remarkable only for their great antiquity and spiritual beliefs".&lt;ref name="refname6"/&gt; Though these people did not seek to preserve animals for modeling their anatomy as they might appear in a natural setting, the ancient Egyptians’ ability to preserve the carcasses of animals as immense as the hippopotamus (a mummy of which was discovered in Thebes) reflect the veracity of these early textual claims to the art's earliest roots.&lt;ref name="refname3"/&gt;

===Carthaginian Empire===
Other instances of ancient roots in taxidermy date as far back as five centuries B.C. in the record of the African explorations of [[Hanno the Navigator|Hanno the Carthaginian]].&lt;ref name="refname2"/&gt; Within the past five centuries, an account is given of the discovery of what were evidently gorillas and the subsequent preservation of their skins, which were hung in the temple of Astarte where they remained until the taking of Carthage in the year 146 B.C.&lt;ref name="refname2"/&gt;

===Western/Central Europe===
The people of Greece, Rome, ancient Britain, and other northern lands could be said to have practiced a form of taxidermy in the tanning of skins used for clothing.&lt;ref name="refname1"/&gt; Because they had no other means of covering their bodies, early Europeans developed methods of preserving the skins of lions, tigers, wolves, and bears for survival.&lt;ref name="refname1"/&gt;

===Native Americans===
Much like the people of Greece, Rome, and northern Europe, many Native American tribes such as the [[Sioux]], [[Cherokee]], [[Pottawatomie]], and [[Cheyenne]] preserved the skins of foxes, [[raccoons]], bears, [[American bison|buffalo]], [[porcupines]], and [[eagle]]s to produce and decorate their clothing, tools, and equipment.&lt;ref name="refname1"/&gt; To this day, remnants of such Native American tribes continue this early form of taxidermy in tanning and preserving animal carcasses for traditional and cultural purposes.

==Early European developments in modern taxidermy==
Nearly a millennium after the fall of Rome in 476 AD, Western European societies transcended the Dark Ages and transformed into powerful, centralized nations through the Renaissance and Scientific Revolution; as these countries were formed, advances in technology and overall living conditions decreased the need for hide tanning&amp;nbsp;– taxidermy in one of its earliest forms. Instead, Western Europe witnessed the rise in modern taxidermy, or the modeling the anatomy of various animals in their natural habitats.&lt;ref name="refname1"/&gt; As taxidermy developed into its modern form, its growth in popularity paralleled the growth of modern naturalistic exhibition.&lt;ref name="refname2"/&gt;

===Birds in the Netherlands===
About 400 years ago, the first mounting attempt on record included the preservation of birds in the Netherlands. As reported, a wealthy Dutch trader obtained an aviary of exotic birds that were brought back from the East Indies. Due to the neglect of the bird keeper, every bird died of suffocation; but as the owner wished to keep their skins and plumage for display, they were skinned and preserved with spices brought to Holland, also from the East Indies. The skins were then wired and stuffed with cotton and tow and were ultimately posed in natural positions.&lt;ref name="refname1"/&gt;

===Rhinoceros in Florence===
Though the preservation of bird skins from the East Indies is the first officially recorded mounting attempt, the Royal Museum of Vertebrates, located in Florence, Italy, poses a mounted rhinoceros believed to date back as early as 1500.&lt;ref name="refname1"/&gt; Though the exact method of preservation of the animal’s skin is unknown, it is believed that the skull and leg bones were used to set up the animal’s frame on a wood [[Armature (sculpture)|armature]] and were then stuffed.&lt;ref name="refname1"/&gt;

===Crocodile in Switzerland===
Another specimen that was prepared during the birth of modern taxidermy is a mounted crocodile 10 to 12 feet long from Egypt that has been on exhibit at the Museum at [[St. Gallen#Museums|St. Gall]] in Switzerland since 1627. Like the rhinoceros, the exact methods of how the crocodile was mounted are unknown. However, the specimen has never been kept under glass, which reveals the success of modern taxidermy, even in its earliest years.&lt;ref name="refname1"/&gt;

==Developments in 18th- and 19th-century Europe==

===Royal Academy of Vienna===
One of the first published works on taxidermy is found in ''Natural History'', published by the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences|Royal Academy of Vienna]] in the beginning of the 18th-century.&lt;ref name="refname1"/&gt; Containing a treatise on the dissection of birds and animals, the work also makes reference to the preservation of birds in the Netherlands more than a century before.

===R. A. F. de Reaumur===
According to John W. Moyer in another one of his works for ''[[Encyclopedia Americana]]'', one of the earliest published works on taxidermy is [[Rene Antoine Ferchault de Reaumur|R. A. F. de Reaumur]]'s ''Treatise'', which was published in 1749.&lt;ref name="refname5"/&gt; In this work, Reaumur discussed the preservation of skins of birds; however, because his plan was simply mounting birds with wires&amp;nbsp;– as had been done over two centuries before&amp;nbsp;– his method did not find much favor among other taxidermists.&lt;ref name="refname3"/&gt; Instead, it spurred the development of a new system of preservation in which one cut the skins longitudinally into halves, filled one half with plaster, fixing the skin to a backboard, inserting an eye, painting on a beak and legs, and then mounting the bird in a framework of glass.&lt;ref name="refname3"/&gt; For the next several decades, this process became the standard method of European taxidermists.

===British Museum===
After rising to prominence in 1759, the [[British Museum]], which, was then known as the [[Montagu House, Bloomsbury|Montagu House]], contained the world's largest collection of animal skins in the 18th- and early 19th-century, displaying a total of 1886 mammals, 1172 birds, 521 reptiles, and 1555 fishes;&lt;ref name="refname3"/&gt; however, a great proportion of these were not stuffed specimens, but simply bones and preparations of skins.&lt;ref name="refname3"/&gt; Soon after the Museum's opening, these natural history collections drew a great deal of interest from the public, thus demonstrating the rise in popularity of the art into the 1800s.

Following the regaining of its independence from Napoleon and the restoration of peace in Europe, Great Britain witnessed continued growth in the Museum’s status as naturalists and taxidermists found that the public had then time and the inclination to devote themselves to such collections.&lt;ref name="refname3"/&gt;

Perhaps the most notable event that provided an impetus to a more accurate, realistic modeling of specimens in their natural settings was the [[Great Exhibition of 1851]] in London.&lt;ref name="refname3"/&gt; Displaying a plethora of exhibits from all around the world in various forms, it was the first time in history where taxidermists from across the world gathered together and presented modern, innovative methods pertaining to the art.

===Rowland Ward studio===
In the late 1800s, British taxidermists established the [[Rowland Ward]] studio was established in London; the individuals who worked there are credited with many improved methods in taxidermy. It was at Ward’s that the ''Lion and Tiger'' struggle (despite its unnatural display of history) was designed and mounted, then considered the finest animal exhibit of ancient or modern times.&lt;ref name="refname1"/&gt; This display was initially moved to an exhibit in Paris, but was soon returned to the Sydenham [[Crystal Palace, London|Crystal Palace]] in London.&lt;ref name="refname3"/&gt;

===Jules Verieaux===
Following the creation of the ''Lion and Tiger'' exhibit, a prominent French taxidermist named [[Jules Verreaux|Jules Verieaux]] mounted another animal group, though different in design. Entitled ''The Courier'', the display depicted the figure of an Arab man (presumably formed from some type of wax) seated upon a stuffed camel being attacked by two lions.&lt;ref name="refname1"/&gt; This spectacle was first exhibited at the [[Exposition Universelle (1867)|Paris Fair of 1867]] and was later purchased by the [[American Museum of Natural History]].&lt;ref name="refname1"/&gt; Like the ''Lion and Tiger display'', Verieaux’s work&amp;nbsp;– along with those of other European taxidermists such as Edwin Ward&amp;nbsp;– demonstrated the development of taxidermy into its modern form as its artists paid a greater deal of attention to animals’ anatomical movements and features.

===Influence of Victorian society===
Although the French and Germans progressed in the practice of taxidermy prior to the [[Great Exhibition of 1851]] in London, the English made several improvements in methodology and skill in the years that followed.&lt;ref name="refname1"/&gt; Much of this can be attributed to the culture of Victorian Society. According to Paul Farber, a researcher at the [[University of Chicago]], in his book ''The Development of Taxidermy and the History of Ornithology'', the art of taxidermy was first brought into popular regard by the Victorians, who were enthralled by all tokens of exotic travel, especially to any domesticated representations of wilderness.&lt;ref name="refname4" /&gt; Whether it was having a glassed-in miniature rain forest on the tea table or a mounted antelope by the front door, members of the elite class relished the art as a manifestation of one’s knowledge, wealth, and artistry.&lt;ref name="refname4"/&gt; As Victorian English society reached its pinnacle near the end of the 19th-century, technique and methodology of the art progressed; however, compared to modern standards, poses were still fairly stiff and expressionless.&lt;ref name="refname4"/&gt;

==Developments in United States: 19th-century to present==

===John Scudder===
One of the pioneers in early American taxidermy, a man named John Scudder succeeded to the proprietorship of Gardner Baker's [[Scudder's American Museum|American Museum]], which had been founded in New York in 1791 by the [[Tammany Society]]. The museum was later acquired by [[P. T. Barnum]] and was soon reestablished as [[Barnum's American Museum]] in 1842. Scudder's successor, [[Titian Peale]], who was appointed assistant manager of the [[Academy of Natural Sciences|Philadelphia Museum]] in 1821, also made important contributions to early taxidermy exhibits.&lt;ref name="refname5"/&gt; Though Scudder and Peale did not contribute any known innovations in the art's technique or methodology, their museum work in New York and Philadelphia paved the way for the development of modern American taxidermy in the decades that followed.

===Ward's Natural Science Museum===
Though taxidermy’s early roots developed in Africa and Western Europe, modern-day taxidermy began in the United States in 1861 when [[Henry Augustus Ward]]'s [[Ward's Natural Science|Natural Science Establishment]] was founded in [[Rochester, New York]].&lt;ref name="refname1"/&gt; Modern-day taxidermists often give credit to this establishment for placing taxidermy on a level with other allied arts and beginning a new era in museum exhibitions. Many later taxidermists, whose work was among the most advanced exhibited, could credit their careers to Ward's Establishment, and many present museums have display collections built around these early Ward specimens.&lt;ref name="refname5"/&gt;

It was at Ward's that the Society of American Taxidermists was founded on March 24, 1880. This society, the first of its kind in the United States, published scholarly reports and held three competitive exhibitions: the first in Rochester on December 14–18, 1880; the second in Boston on December 14–21, 1881; and the third in New York City on April 30-May 5, 1883.&lt;ref name="refname1"/&gt; Terminated after the last exhibit in 1883, "the society in three years had done more for taxidermy and the natural history museum in general in the United States than had ever previously been accomplished".&lt;ref name="refname5"/&gt; Founded by America's most skilled taxidermists of the day, the Society presented to the public modern methods and techniques, which were freely discussed and served to bring about a higher standard of commercial work and museum exhibits.&lt;ref name="refname1"/&gt; It was during this time in which the "stuffing" of animals transformed into a purely elaborate art form.&lt;ref name="refname1"/&gt; In addition, this institution generated many famous taxidermists and naturalists such as [[William Temple Hornaday|William T. Hornaday]], Frederic S. Webster, John Martens, [[Carl Akeley|Carl E. Akeley]], Joseph Palmer, William J. Critchley, Thomas W. Fraine, and J.F.D. Bailey.&lt;ref name="refname1"/&gt;

===Carl E. Akeley===
By the early part of the twentieth century, following the termination of Ward's Society of American Taxidermists, individuals such as Akeley, Hornaday, and Leon Pray had refined techniques and begun emphasizing artistry.&lt;ref name="refname4"/&gt; Akeley, specifically, is responsible for devising a method of mounting that is now standard. In this process, "the true contours of the specimen are preserved by making a clay model, exactly duplicating the animal's muscle structure, over an [[Armature (sculpture)|armature]] that includes the original skeleton or parts of it. A plaster mold is then made, from which is produced a light, durable frame that holds the skin in position. Synthetic materials, especially [[celluloid]], are now often used to reproduce the true color and translucence of such specimens as reptiles and fishes."&lt;ref name="refname8"/&gt;

However, as the techniques of taxidermy became more realistic, the more mounted displays discomfited viewers; instead of expressionless [[moose]] heads mounted onto a wall of a building, artists began mounting specimens such as [[bobcat]]s pouncing in midair.&lt;ref name="refname4"/&gt; Therefore, as a result, for the next several decades, taxidermy existed in the margins&amp;nbsp;– practitioners were located sporadically throughout the United States, often self-taught, and usually known only by word of mouth.&lt;ref name="refname4"/&gt;

===A 20th-century revival===
After years of disorganization and scattered existence, American taxidermy witnessed a sudden rebirth in the early 1970s. Taxidermy schools opened, igniting hopes of success in prospective artists. In 1971, for instance, the National Taxidermy Association was formed after years of unsuccessful organization.&lt;ref name="refname4"/&gt; Similarly, in 1974, a trade magazine called Taxidermy Review began sponsoring national competitions.&lt;ref name="refname4"/&gt; For the first time in history, American taxidermists had a chance to collaborate and discuss specific processes in the taxidermy process such as gluing tongues into jaw sets or accurately measuring the carcass of a squirrel. The majority of such techniques are still used in taxidermy shops today, allowing practitioners to prepare specimens as realistically as possible.

==Taxidermy and American social life==
American culture reflects its preoccupation with taxidermy in a variety of ways. Various words and phrases used in everyday life are derived from the vocabulary of taxidermy—the threat to "beat the 'stuffing' out of someone" or derogatorily referring to someone as a "stuffed shirt," meaning that they are fake or artificially pompous.&lt;ref name="refname7"/&gt; It has also manifested itself in popular television shows such as in the ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'' episode where the doctors encounter a dead dog and in ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'' where Dwight offers to have his taxidermist stuff Angela's deceased cat.

Taxidermy has also been institutionalized as an American folk craft. At one time, it was listed in the [[Boy Scouts of America]] Handbook as one of the skills which, when mastered, could earn a merit badge. The Merit Badge of Taxidermy was first introduced in 1911 and included in the Handbook through 1954, during which 10,344 scouts earned the badge. In 1954, the taxidermy badge was dropped from the merit badge series because of the "lack of interest."&lt;ref name="refname7"/&gt;

Many Americans have acquired their expertise in taxidermy via mail-order lessons and commenced their artistic career with the carcass of a sparrow or squirrel. Many prominent Americans, such as the noted painter [[Charles Willson Peale|Charles Wilson Peale]] and the famous military leader [[George Armstrong Custer]], were enthusiastic taxidermists. The art has enjoyed a pervasive integration into the fabric of American social life as practitioners are found in practically every small town in America.&lt;ref name="refname7"/&gt; Specimens are widely employed in home and store decorations, for business advertising, for sporting trophies, and perhaps, most importantly, reifying the notion that humans can symbolically "restore" life to dead animals&amp;nbsp;— thereby, in a sense, demonstrating our perceived human power over death.

==Faux Taxidermy==
Faux Taxidermy has been a modern phenomenon in home decor and decorating since the 2010s.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} In 2013, the Huffington post noted that decorating with sculpted fake animal heads painted in different colors had become a popular trend in interior design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/09/faux-taxidermy-decor_n_3245609.html|title=Faux Taxidermy Is A Surprisingly Chic Decor Element (PHOTOS)|first=Rain|last=Embuscado|date=9 May 2013|publisher=|via=Huff Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

{{Refimprove|date=November 2010}}
An '''isomorph''' is an organism that does not change in shape during growth. The implication is that its volume is proportional to its cubed length, and its surface area to its squared length. This holds for any shape it might have; the actual shape determines the proportionality constants.

The reason why the concept is important in the context of the [[Dynamic Energy Budget]] (DEB) theory is that food (substrate) uptake is proportional to surface area, and maintenance to volume. Since volume grows faster than surface area, this controls the ultimate size of the organism. [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] wrote this in a letter to [[Edward Bagnall Poulton|E. B. Poulton]] in 1865.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Finch|first1=Caleb E.|title=Longevity, senescence, and the genome|date=1994|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=9780226248899|edition=Pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see Finch, C. 1990 ''Longevity, senescence, and the genome'' Univ Chicago Press Appendix 3&lt;/ref&gt; The surface area that is of importance is the part that is involved in substrate uptake (e.g. the gut surface), which is typically a fixed fraction of the total surface area in an isomorph. The DEB theory explains why isomorphs grow according to the [[von Bertalanffy]] curve if food availability is constant.

Organisms can also change in shape during growth, which affects the growth curve and the ultimate size, see for instance [[V0-morph]]s and [[V1-morph]]s. Isomorphs can also be called V2/3-morphs.

Most animals approximate isomorphy, but plants in a vegetation typically start as [[V1-morph]]s, then convert to isomorphs, and end up as [[V0-morph]]s (if neighbouring plants affect their uptake).

In [[computer science]], '''Java Grammatical Evolution''' is an implementation of [[grammatical evolution]] in the [[Java programming language]]. Examples include jGE library and GEVA.

== jGE library ==

'''jGE library''' was the first published implementation of grammatical evolution in the Java language.&lt;ref&gt;Georgiou, L. and Teahan, W. J. (2006a) “jGE - A Java implementation of Grammatical Evolution”. &lt;u&gt;10th WSEAS International Conference on Systems&lt;/u&gt;, Athens, Greece, July 10–15, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, another well-known published Java implementation exists, named '''[http://ncra.ucd.ie/Site/GEVA.html GEVA]'''. GEVA was developed at [[University College Dublin]]'s Natural Computing Research &amp; Applications group under the guidance of one of the inventors of grammatical evolution, [http://www.csi.ucd.ie/users/michael-oneill Dr. Michael O'Neill.]

jGE library aims to provide not only an implementation of grammatical evolution, but also a free, open-source, and extendable framework for experimentation in the area of [[evolutionary computation]]. Namely, it supports the implementation (through additions and extensions) of any [[evolutionary algorithm]].&lt;ref&gt;Georgiou, L. and Teahan, W. J. (2008) “Experiments with Grammatical Evolution in Java”. &lt;u&gt;Knowledge-Driven Computing: Knowledge Engineering and Intelligent Computations, Studies in Computational Intelligence&lt;/u&gt; (vol. 102), 45-62. Berlin, Germany: Springer Berlin / Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, its extendable architecture and design facilitates the implementation and incorporation of new experimental implementation inspired by natural evolution and biology.&lt;ref&gt;Georgiou, L. and Teahan, W. J. (2006b) “Implication of Prior Knowledge and Population Thinking in Grammatical Evolution: Toward a Knowledge Sharing Architecture”. &lt;u&gt;WSEAS Transactions on Systems&lt;/u&gt; 5 (10), 2338-2345.&lt;/ref&gt;

The jGE library binary file, the source code, the documentation, and an extension for the [http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo NetLogo modeling environment], named jGE NetLogo extension, can be downloaded from the [https://web.archive.org/web/20101129085227/http://www.bangor.ac.uk/~eep201/jge/ jGE Official Web Site].

'''Joseph Force Crater''' (January 5, 1889 – disappeared August 6, 1930, declared legally dead June 6, 1939) was a [[New York State Supreme Court]] Justice who vanished amid political scandal. He was last seen leaving a restaurant on West 45th Street in [[Manhattan]], and entered [[popular culture]] as one of the most mysterious missing persons cases of the twentieth century. Despite massive publicity, the case was never solved and was officially closed 40 years after he disappeared.  His disappearance fueled public disquiet about New York City [[corruption]] and was a factor in the downfall of the [[Tammany Hall]] [[political machine]].

==Early life and legal career==
Crater was born in [[Easton, Pennsylvania]], the eldest of four children of Frank Ellsworth Crater and the former Leila Virginia Montague.&lt;ref&gt;records of the members of the First Methodist Church, Easton, Pennsylvania&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Media:Crater draft.jpg|World War I draft registration]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Media:1900 census Crater.jpg|Joseph Force Crater]] in the [[1900 United States Census]]; [[Easton, Pennsylvania]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harold Leslie Crater, Jr., ''The descendents [''sic''] of Moritz Creeter (1703–1772), who arrived at the Port of Philadelphia on the ship Mortonhouse on August 19, 1729'' (privately published, 2003), p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at [[Lafayette College]] (class of 1910) and [[Columbia University]]. He was a member of the [[Sigma Chi]] fraternity.&lt;ref&gt;''The Sigma Chi Quarterly: The Official Organ of the Sigma Chi Fraternity'', Volume 26 (Google eBook), p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;

Crater's official title was Justice of the [[New York Supreme Court]] for [[Manhattan|New York County]], which is a [[trial court]] despite the designation "supreme" (New York's [[supreme court|highest court]] is the [[New York Court of Appeals|Court of Appeals]]). Bank records later revealed that he withdrew $20,000 shortly before taking up the position in April 1930 at the relatively young age of 41. This caused suspicion{{who|date=July 2014}} that a payment to [[Tammany Hall]] politicians had secured his appointment. While acting as official [[receivership|receiver]] in a bankruptcy, Crater sold a property at a tiny fraction of the $3 million that the city paid to get it back shortly afterward. The huge profit generated in the transaction later caused speculation that he had been killed in a dispute over the money made on a corrupt scheme, although no evidence of corruption was ever found.

Crater issued two published opinions: ''Rotkowitz v. Sohn'',&lt;ref&gt;https://casetext.com/case/rotkowitz-v-sohn&lt;/ref&gt; involving [[fraudulent conveyance]]s and [[Mortgage fraud|mortgage foreclosure fraud]];&lt;ref&gt;239 N.Y.S. 639, N.Y.Sup., February 8, 1930.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Henderson v. Park Central Motors Service'',&lt;ref&gt;https://casetext.com/case/henderson-v-park-central-motors-service&lt;/ref&gt; dealing with a garage company's liability for an expensive car stolen and wrecked by an ex-convict.&lt;ref&gt;244 N.Y.S. 409, N.Y.Sup., July 11, 1930.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disappearance==
In the summer of 1930, Crater and his wife Stella Mance Wheeler were vacationing at their summer cabin in [[Belgrade, Maine]]. In late July, Crater received a telephone call. He offered no information to his wife about the content of the call, other than to say that he had to return to the city "to straighten those fellows out". The next day, he arrived at his 40 Fifth Avenue apartment, but instead of dealing with business, he made a trip to [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]], with his mistress, showgirl Sally Lou Ritzi (who used the stage name Ritz).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gibson|first=John Winslow|title=Judge Crater, the Missingest Person: How He Disappeared and Why They Couldn't Find Him|publisher=Dog Ear Publishing| year=2010|page=30|location=Indianapolis, Indiana|isbn=978-1-60844-712-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Maine on August 1, and traveled back to New York on August 3. Before making this final trip, he promised his wife that he would return by her birthday on August 9. Crater's wife stated that he was in good spirits and behaving normally when he departed for New York City. On the morning of Wednesday, August 6, Crater spent two hours going through his files in his courthouse chambers, reportedly destroying several documents. He then had his [[law clerk]] Joseph Mara cash two checks for him that amounted to $5,150 (equivalent to about ${{Inflation|US|5150|1930|fmt=c}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars). At noon, he and Mara carried two locked [[briefcase]]s to his apartment and he let Mara take the rest of the day off.

Later that evening, Crater went to a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] ticket agency (Supreme Tickets) and bought one seat from William Deutsch (proprietor of Supreme) for a comedy called ''Dancing Partner''&lt;ref&gt;{{IBDB show|2910|Dancing Partner}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Belasco Theatre]]. He then went to Billy Haas's Chophouse at 332 West 45th Street, where he ate dinner with Ritzi and William Klein, a lawyer friend.&lt;ref name="New York Magazine"&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5-UCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA11 | title=Good Night, Judge Crater, Wherever You Are | journal=New York Magazine | date=August 11, 1980 | author=Garrett, Robert | pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Klein later told investigators that Crater was in a good mood that evening and gave no indication that anything was bothering him. The dinner ended a little after 9 p.m., shortly after the curtain rose on the show for which Crater had bought a ticket, and the small group went outside.

===Last known sighting===
Crater's dinner companions gave differing accounts of Crater's departure from the restaurant. William Klein initially testified that "the judge got into a taxicab outside the restaurant about 9:30 p.m. and drove west on Forty-fifth Street,"&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/nyregion/crater-ransom.pdf|title=Ransom of $20,000 Asked for Crater|date=Sep 16, 1930|page=1|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=July 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this account was initially confirmed by Sally Lou Ritz: "At the sidewalk Judge Crater took a taxicab".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/nyregion/crater-cuba.pdf|title=Search for Crater Swings to Havana|date=Sep 24, 1930|page=4|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=July 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Klein and Ritz later changed their story and said that they had entered a taxi outside the restaurant while Crater had walked down the street.&lt;ref name="CNN Transcripts"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0508/22/ltm.02.html|title=CNN Transcript: Interview with Richard Tofel, August 22, 2005|publisher=CNN|accessdate=August 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Delayed responses to disappearance===
There was no immediate reaction to Judge Crater's disappearance. He did not return to Maine for 10 days, and his wife began making calls to their friends in New York, asking if anyone had seen him. Only when he failed to appear for the opening of the courts on August 25 did his fellow justices become alarmed. They started a private search but failed to find any trace of him. The police were finally notified on September 3 and, after that, the missing judge was front-page news.&lt;ref&gt;Times Wide World Photo. (September 4, 1930).

===Investigation===
Once an official investigation was launched, the case received widespread publicity.&lt;ref&gt;"Wide Hunt is begun for Justice Crater, missing four weeks," ''New York Times'', September 4, 1930, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Detectives discovered that the judge's [[safe deposit box]] had been emptied and the two briefcases that Crater and his assistant had taken to his apartment were missing. These promising leads were quickly lost amid the thousands of false reports from people claiming to have seen the missing man.&lt;ref&gt;"Aide denies Crater destroyed papers; hunt is pressed," ''New York Times'', September 5, 1930, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Federal men scan Crater bank books," ''New York Times'', September 6, 1930, pg. 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Family asks hunt for Judge Crater," New York Times, September 7, 1930, p.3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Search for Crater near a standstill," ''New York Times'', September 8, 1930, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sally Lou Ritzi, June Brice, and Vivian Gordon====
Crater enjoyed the city's nightlife and had been involved with several women. In the aftermath of the case, two of the women he had been involved with left town abruptly and a third was murdered. Ritzi, the showgirl who had dined with him the evening that he vanished, left New York in August or September 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charleyproject.org/cases/r/ritz_sally.html |title=Sally Lou Ritz |publisher=The Charley Project |accessdate=August 4, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613070713/http://charleyproject.org/cases/r/ritz_sally.html |archivedate=June 13, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was found in late September 1930, living in [[Youngstown, Ohio]], with her parents. She said that she had left New York suddenly because she had received word that her father was ill. Ritzi was still being subjected to interviews by police investigating the Crater case in 1937, by which time she was living in [[Beverly Hills, California]].&lt;ref&gt;"Mystery to Sally," The Daily Times (Beaver, PA), Sept. 25, 1930, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CHECK ON BODIES IN CRATER SEARCH. (September 28, 1930). Daily Boston Globe (1928–1960), B2. Retrieved August 9, 2011, from ProQuest Historical Newspapers Boston Globe (1872–1979). (Document ID: 1999524842).&lt;/ref&gt;

Showgirl June Brice had been seen talking to Crater the day before he disappeared. A lawyer acting for Crater's wife believed that Brice had been at the center of a scheme to blackmail Crater (thus explaining why Crater had taken cash out of the bank) and that a gangster boyfriend of Brice had killed the judge. Brice disappeared the day that a grand jury was to convene on the case. In 1948, she was discovered in a [[Psychiatric hospital|mental hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;''NY Press'' [http://nypress.com/the-missingest-man-in-new-york/ Missingest Man in New York]&lt;/ref&gt;

Vivian Gordon, a third woman, was involved in high-end [[prostitution]] and linked to madam [[Polly Adler]]. Gordon had liaisons with a large number of influential businesspeople, and was the owner, on paper at least, of a number of properties believed to be fronts for illegal activity. She was also seen around town with gangster [[Legs Diamond|Jack "Legs" Diamond]], with whom Crater was rumored to socialize. Crater had known Diamond's former boss, organized crime figure [[Arnold Rothstein]], and had been extremely upset at his murder.&lt;ref name="CNN Transcripts" /&gt;&lt;ref name="blogs.smithsonianmag.com"&gt;Smithsonian.com, February 25, 2013,[http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/history/2013/02/the-dead-woman-who-brought-down-the-mayor/ The Dead Woman Who Brought Down the Mayor]&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 20, 1931, Vivian Gordon was angry about a conviction that had resulted in her losing custody of her 16-year-old daughter. She met the head of an official inquiry into city government corruption (launched in the wake of Crater's disappearance) and offered to testify about police [[graft (politics)|graft]]. She was murdered five days later. Detectives searching her apartment found a coat that had belonged to Crater.

The publicity surrounding Gordon's killing led to the resignation of a policeman whom she had accused of framing her, and the suicide of her daughter. The Tammany Hall political machine's hold on the city was largely eliminated in the ensuing scandal, as it was already weakened by Rothstein and the conflict over his former empire. This also led to the resignation of New York City Mayor [[Jimmy Walker]].&lt;ref name="CNN Transcripts" /&gt;&lt;ref name="blogs.smithsonianmag.com"/&gt;

====Open verdict====
In October, a grand jury began examining the case, calling 95 witnesses and amassing 975 pages of testimony. Mrs. Crater refused to appear.&lt;ref name="proquest.com"&gt;"Stella Crater Kunz, Once Wed To Judge Who Vanished, Dead." ''New York Times'' (1923–Current file),  September 24, 1969,  http://www.proquest.com/ (Retrieved August 9, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; The conclusion was that "the evidence is insufficient to warrant any expression of opinion as to whether Crater is alive or dead, or as to whether he has absented himself voluntarily, or is the sufferer from disease in the nature of amnesia, or is the victim of crime".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prairieghosts.com/crater.html|title=What Happened To Judge Crater?|publisher= Prairieghosts.com|accessdate=August 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Daniel MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCES, New York, Dodd Meade &amp; Company, 1976 pages 18 and 19&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, some theorized that he had left town with another woman or fled to avoid revelations of corruption, but the case's extensive publicity would have made it virtually impossible for Crater to have begun a new life somewhere else. Six months after his disappearance, Crater's wife found envelopes in a dresser drawer containing money and a note from the judge. The discovery led to a number of new but ultimately inconclusive leads, and no trace of him was ever found.&lt;ref name="CNN Transcripts" /&gt; Crater's wife said that he had been murdered.&lt;ref&gt;"Crater Probe Has Shifted to West" (INS story), ''Chester (PA) Times'', July 26, 1937, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The case was officially closed in 1979.&lt;ref name="Janet Cawley 1980"&gt;Janet Cawley.  "Column 1 :Judge Crater case slips into history Police file is closed on 'missingest' person." ''Chicago Tribune'' (1963–Current file),  August 5, 1980,  http://www.proquest.com/ (Retrieved August 9, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mrs. Crater===
Judge Crater met Stella Mance Wheeler in 1917 when he served as her divorce lawyer, and they married seven days after her divorce was finalized.&lt;ref name="TOM MEEHAN 1960"&gt;By TOM MEEHAN. "Cause No. 13595 :It's thirty years later, there's plenty of data – but still no Judge Crater." ''New York Times'' (1923–Current file), August 7, 1960, http://www.proquest.com/ (Retrieved August 9, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Mrs. Crater remained at their vacation home in Belgrade Lakes, Maine, during the search for her husband, until January 20, 1931, when she allegedly discovered checks, stocks, bonds, and a note written by the judge in a drawer that had been empty when police checked earlier.&lt;ref name="TOM MEEHAN 1960"/&gt; Without Crater's income, Mrs. Crater was unable to maintain the couple's fashionable [[Fifth Avenue]] apartment and was evicted.&lt;ref name="proquest.com"/&gt; She petitioned to have the judge declared officially dead in July 1937; she was reportedly living on the $12 per week (approximately ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|12|1937|r=0}}}} in 2013 funds{{inflation-fn|US}}) that she earned as a telephone operator in Belgrade Lakes.&lt;ref&gt;Exclusive. "JUDGE CRATER'S WIFE ENDS HOPE: Asks Missing Jurist Declared Legally Dead." ''Los Angeles Times'' (1923–Current File), July 21, 1937, http://www.proquest.com/ (Retrieved August 9, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

Mrs. Crater married Carl Kunz, a New York electrical contractor, in [[Elkton, Maryland]], on April 23, 1938, a year before the judge was declared legally dead.&lt;ref&gt;Special Dispatch to The Post.. "Crater's Widow Wed at Elkton; Husband Gave D.C. Address: Ceremony Took Place on April 23; Jurist Held Legally Dead. Judge Crater's Widow Married In Elkton Rites Crater." ''The Washington Post'' (1923–1954), July 14, 1938, http://www.proquest.com/ (Retrieved August 9, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Kunz's first wife had hanged herself only eight days before the wedding.&lt;ref name="Janet Cawley 1980"/&gt;

The judge was finally declared legally dead in 1939 thanks to Mrs. Crater's lawyer, noted New York attorney Emil K. Ellis.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Meehan, "Case No. 13595," ''New York Times'', August 7, 1960, p. SM27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Crater Will Case Up May 26." ''New York Times'' (1923–Current file), April 28, 1939, http://www.proquest.com/ (Retrieved August 9, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; She received $20,561 in life insurance (approximately ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|20561|1939|r=0}}}} in 2013 dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}). She separated from Kunz in 1950 and died in 1969 at age 70.&lt;ref name="proquest.com"/&gt;

She expressed her belief that Crater had been murdered in her own account of the case, ''The Empty Robe'', which was written with freelance writer and journalist [[Oscar Fraley]] and published by [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Crater, Stella (Wheeler). The Empty Robe. Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;By EMANUEL PERLMUTTER. "A Missing Person: THE EMPTY ROBE.

===Recent information===
On August 19, 2005, authorities revealed that, after her death at age 91, they had received notes that had been written by Stella Ferrucci-Good, from [[Queens]]. In the letter, Ferrucci-Good claimed that her husband, Robert Good, a detective with the NYPD, had learned that Crater was killed by [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] officer Charles Burns (also bodyguard of [[Abe Reles]] of [[Murder, Inc.]]) and Burns' brother, Frank. According to the letter, Crater was buried near West Eighth Street in [[Coney Island]], [[Brooklyn, New York|Brooklyn]], at the current site of the [[New York Aquarium]].&lt;ref name=Rashbaum /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gendar|first=Alison|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2005-08-19/news/18321667_1_judge-joseph-crater-showgirl-mistress-tammany-hall|title=JUDGE CRATER FOUND?

Tofel, the author of ''Vanishing Point: The Disappearance of Judge Crater and the New York He Left Behind'', expressed skepticism of Ferrucci-Good's account.&lt;ref name="Rashbaum" /&gt;

==Popular culture==
The phrase "to pull a Crater" means to disappear. It is no longer widely used.&lt;ref name="Kelly"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/web/20060805-joseph-force-crater-new-york-tammany-hall-supreme-court.shtml|title=Kelly, Jack, 'Judge Crater Vanishes Forever|publisher=Americanheritage.com|accessdate=August 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

For many years following Crater's disappearance, "Judge Crater, call your office" was a standard gag of nightclub comedians.&lt;ref name="Kelly" /&gt;

As a publicity stunt for their 1933 film ''[[Bureau of Missing Persons]]'', [[First National Pictures]] promised in advertisements to pay Crater $10,000 ({{Inflation|US|10000|1933|r=-4|fmt=eq}}) if he claimed it in person at the box office.&lt;ref&gt;Cinema: The New Pictures (September 18, 1933). [http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,746087-3,00.html ''Time'' Magazine archive (subscription required)], retrieved April 22, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 66th episode of ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'' Rob and Laura renew their wedding vows before a Connecticut Justice of the Peace who says he is "Judge Crater".  He admits moments later it is really Krata but he deliberately mispronounces it because he loves watching people's reactions.

Judge Crater's last letter, possibly written on the day of his disappearance, was sold at auction on June 22, 1981, for $700.&lt;ref&gt;Sotheby Parke Bernet, Sale No. 4652E on June 22, 1981, "Printed and Manuscript Americana," Lot 174.&lt;/ref&gt; The letter was marked "confidential" and began: "The following money is due me from the persons named. Get in touch with them for they will surely pay their debts." It was incorrectly reported that this letter was Crater's will.&lt;ref&gt;''Los Angeles Times'', June 23, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Jack Finney]]'s science fiction short story "[[Of Missing Persons]]", the narrator speculates that Judge Crater went to Verna.

In his novel ''The Man Who Never Returned'' (2010), Peter Quinn investigates the Crater case through the lens of a fictional detective working the case in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://newyorkpaddy.com/|title=The official website of Author Peter Quinn|publisher=New York Paddy|date=August 6, 1930|accessdate=August 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In her novel ''The Wife, the Maid, and the Mistress'' (2014), Ariel Lawhon theorizes that the women in Judge Crater's life all knew what happened to him, but refused to reveal the facts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17618286-the-wife-the-maid-and-the-mistress|title=The Wife, the Maid, and the Mistress at goodreads.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:FallPando02.jpg|thumbnail|Although it appears to be multiple trees, [[Pando (tree)|Pando]] is a clonal colony of an individual [[Populus tremuloides|quaking aspen]] with an interconnected root system. It is widely held to be the world's most massive single organism.]]
The '''largest organisms''' now found on Earth can be determined according to various aspects of an [[organism|organism's]] size, such as: mass, volume, area, length, height, or even [[genome size]]. Some organisms group together to form a [[superorganism]] (such as [[ant]]s or [[bee]]s), but such are not classed as single large organisms. The [[Great Barrier Reef]] is the world's largest structure composed of living entities, stretching {{convert|2,000|km|mi|abbr=on}}, but contains many organisms of many types of species.

This article lists the largest species for various types of organisms, and mostly considers [[Extant taxon|extant]] species. The organism sizes listed are frequently considered "outsized" and are not in the normal size range for the respective group.

If considered singular entities, the largest organisms are [[clonal colony|clonal colonies]] which can spread over large areas. [[Pando (tree)|Pando]], a clonal colony of the [[Populus tremuloides|quaking aspen tree]], is widely considered to be the largest such organism by mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.zmescience.com/other/science-abc/heaviest-organism-pando-aspen/|title = The Heaviest Living Organism in the World|date = 9 February 2015|accessdate = 10 February 2016|website = ZME Science|publisher = |last = Mihai|first = Andrei}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if such colonies are excluded, [[trees]] retain their dominance of this listing, with the [[giant sequoia]] being the most massive tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Giant Sequoia National Monument|url=http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/sequoia/home/?cid=stelprdb5394941|website=Sequoia National Forest|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture - Forest service|accessdate=10 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 a huge [[clonal colony]] of ''[[Posidonia oceanica]]'' was discovered south of the island of [[Ibiza]].

Among [[animals]], the largest species are all [[marine mammal]]s, specifically [[whales]]. The [[blue whale]] is believed to be the largest animal to have ever lived. The largest land animal classification is also dominated by [[mammals]], with the [[African bush elephant]] being the most massive of these.

==Plants==
{{main|List of largest plants}}
The largest single-stem tree by wood volume and mass is the [[giant sequoia]] (''Sequoiadendron giganteum''), native to Sierra Nevada and California; it typically grows to a height of {{convert|70|-|85|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} and {{convert|5|-|7|m|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter.

Multiple-stem trees such as [[banyan]] can be enormous. [[Thimmamma Marrimanu]] in India spreads over {{convert|2.5|acre|ha|abbr=in|order=flip}}.

The largest organism in the world, according to mass, is the [[Populus tremuloides|aspen tree]] whose colonies of clones can grow up to five miles long. The largest such colony is [[Pando (tree)|Pando]], in the Fishlake National Forest in Utah.

Another form of flowering plant that rivals Pando as the largest organism on earth in breadth, if not mass, is the giant marine plant, ''[[Posidonia oceanica]]'', discovered in the Mediterranean near the [[Balearic Islands]], Spain. Its length is about {{convert|8|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}. It may also be the [[Oldest organisms|oldest living]] organism in the world, with an estimated age of 100,000 years.&lt;ref name=seagrass&gt;[http://www.ibiza-spotlight.com/news/2006/monster_plant_280506_i.htm Ibiza's Monster Marine Plant] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226063158/http://www.ibiza-spotlight.com/news/2006/monster_plant_280506_i.htm |date=2007-12-26 }}. ''Ibiza Spotlight'' (2006-05-28).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Green algae===
[[Green algae]] are photosynthetic unicellular and multicellular [[protist]]s that are related to land plants. The [[thallus]] of the unicellular mermaid's wineglass, ''[[Acetabularia]]'', can grow to several inches (perhaps 0.1 to 0.2 m) in length. The fronds of the similarly unicellular, and invasive ''[[Caulerpa taxifolia]]'' can grow up to a foot (0.3 m) long.

==Animals==
A member of the order [[Cetacea]], the [[blue whale]] (''Balaenoptera musculus''), is thought to be the largest animal ever to have lived. The maximum recorded weight was 190 metric [[tonne]]s for a specimen measuring {{convert|27.6|m|ft}}, whereas longer ones, up to {{convert|33.6|m|ft}}, have been recorded but not weighed.&lt;ref name = "Wood"&gt;Wood, Gerald ''The Guinness Book of Animal Facts and Feats'' (1983) {{ISBN|978-0-85112-235-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davies|first1=Ella|title=The longest animal alive may be one you never thought of|url=http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20160420-the-longest-animal-alive-may-not-be-the-blue-whale|website=BBC Earth|accessdate=2018-02-14|language=en|date=2016-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/largest-mammal Largest mammal | Guinness World Records&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[African bush elephant]] (''Loxodonta africana''), of the order [[Proboscidea]], is the largest living land animal. A native of various open habitats in sub-Saharan Africa, this elephant is commonly born weighing about {{convert|100|kg|lb}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Emanuelson|first1=Karen|editor1-last=Fowler|editor1-first=Murray|editor2-last=Mikota|editor2-first=Susan K.|title=Biology, Medicine, and Surgery of Elephants|date=2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9780470344118|page=234|chapter=Chapter 16 Neonatal care and hand rearing. Neonatal care}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest elephant ever recorded was shot in [[Angola]] in 1974. It was a male measuring {{convert|10.67|m|ft}} from trunk to tail and {{convert|4.17|m|ft}} lying on its side in a projected line from the highest point of the shoulder to the base of the forefoot, indicating a standing shoulder height of {{convert|3.96|m|ft}}. This male had an computed weight of 12.25 tonnes.&lt;ref name="Wood"/&gt;

;Table of heaviest living animals
The heaviest living animals are all [[cetacean]]s, and thus also the largest living mammals. Since no scale can accommodate the whole body of a large whale, most whales have been weighed by parts.

*'''Aspiraculates''' ([[Aspiraculata]])
:The largest aspiraculates: ''[[Oligotrema]]'' large and surrounded by six large lobes; the cloacal syphon is small. They live exclusively in deep water and range in size from less than one inch (2 cm) to 2.4 inches (6 cm).

===[[Thaliacea]]===
[[File:Pyrosoma_atlanticum.JPG|thumb|right|The ''[[Pyrosoma atlanticum]]'' the largest thaliacean]]
:The largest thaliacean: ''[[Pyrosoma atlanticum]]'' is cylindrical and can grow up to 60 cm (2 ft) long and 4–6 cm wide. The constituent [[zooid]]s form a rigid tube, which may be pale pink, yellowish, or bluish. One end of the tube is narrower and is closed, while the other is open and has a strong diaphragm. The outer surface or test is gelatinised and dimpled with backward-pointing, blunt processes. The individual zooids are up to 8.5 mm (0.3 in) long and have a broad, rounded branchial sac with [[gill]] slits. Along the side of the branchial sac runs the [[endostyle]], which produces [[mucus]] filters. Water is moved through the gill slits into the centre of the cylinder by [[Cilium|cilia]] pulsating rhythmically. [[Plankton]] and other food particles are caught in mucus filters in the processes as the colony is propelled through the water. ''P. atlanticum'' is bioluminescent and can generate a brilliant blue-green light when stimulated.&lt;ref name=JelliesZone/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://species-identification.org/species.php?species_group=zmns&amp;id=588 ''Pyrosoma atlanticum''] Marine Species Identification Portal.

Retrieved 2011-11-17.&lt;/ref&gt; The doliolid body is small, typically 1–2&amp;nbsp;cm long, and barrel-shaped; it features two wide [[siphon]]s, one at the front and the other at the back end, and eight or nine circular [[muscle]] strands reminiscent of barrel bands. Like all [[tunicate]]s, they are [[filter feeder]]s. They are free-floating; the same forced flow of water through their bodies with which they gather [[plankton]] is used for propulsion - not unlike a tiny [[ramjet]] engine. Doliolids are capable of quick movement. They have a complicated [[biological life cycle|lifecycle]] consisting of sexual and asexual generations. They are nearly exclusively tropical animals, although a few species can be found as far to the north as northern [[California]].

*'''Salps''' ([[Salpida]])
:The largest salps: ''[[Cyclosalpa bakeri]]''15cm (6ins) long. There are openings at the anterior and posterior ends of the cylinder which can be opened or closed as needed. The bodies have seven transverse bands of muscle interspersed by white, translucent patches. A stolon grows from near the endostyle (an elongated glandular structure producing mucus for trapping food particles). The stolon is a ribbon-like organ on which a batch of aggregate forms of the animal are produced by [[budding]]. The aggregate is the second, colonial form of the salp and is also gelatinous, transparent and flabby. It takes the shape of a radial whorl of individuals up to about 20cm (4in) in diameter. It is formed of approximately 12 [[zooid]]s linked side by side in a shape that resembles a crown.&lt;ref name=JelliesZone&gt;[http://jellieszone.com/pelagic-tunicates/cyclosalpa-bakeri/ ''Cyclosalpa bakeri'' - Ritter, 1905] JelliesZone, by David Wrobel.

;Table of heaviest living bird species
The following is a list of the heaviest living bird species based on maximum reported or reliable mass, but average weight is also given for comparison. These species are almost all flightless, which allows for these particular birds to have denser bones and heavier bodies. Flightless birds comprise less than 2% of all living bird species.

In 2007, authorities in New Zealand announced the capture of the largest known colossal squid specimen. It was initially thought to be {{convert|10|m|ft|abbr=on}} and {{convert|450|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. It was later measured at {{convert|4.2|m|ft|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|495|kg|lb|abbr=on}} in weight.&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10430435"&gt;Kathy Marks.

The [[giant squid]] (''Architeuthis dux'') was previously thought to be the largest squid, and while it is less massive and has a smaller mantle than the colossal squid, it may exceed the colossal squid in overall length including tentacles.

'''Lautaro''' ({{lang-arn|Lef-Traru}} "[[southern crested caracara|swift hawk]]") ({{IPA-es|lau̯ˈtaɾo}}; 1534? – April 29, 1557) was a young [[Mapuche|Araucanian]] ''[[toqui]]'' known for leading the indigenous resistance against [[Conquest of Chile|Spanish conquest in Chile]]. Lautaro begun his career as a captive of [[Pedro de Valdivia]] but escaped in 1551. Back among his people he was declared toqui and led Mapuche warriors into a series of victories against the Spanish culminating in the [[Battle of Tucapel]] in December 1553 where Pedro de Valdivia was killed.
. The outbreak of a [[typhus]] plague, a [[drought in Chile|drought]] and a famine prevented the Mapuche from taking further actions to expel the Spanish in 1554 and 1555. Between 1556 and 1557 a small group of Mapuche commanded by Lautaro attempted to reach Santiago to liberate the whole of [[Central Chile]] from Spanish rule. Lautaro's attempts ended in 1557 when he was [[Battle of Mataquito|killed in an ambush]] by the Spanish.

Today Lautaro is revered among Mapuche and non-Mapuche Chileans for his resistance against foreign conquest, servitude and cruelty.

==Early life==
Lautaro was the son of a Mapuche ''[[lonko]]'' (a chief who holds office during peacetime) called, Curiñancu&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; (Kurüñamku in the Mapuche language, Mapudungun, ‘[[Buteo|aguilucho]] negro’ meaning ‘black harrier’) and was born in 1533.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Diccionario Historico de Chile|last=Fuentes|first=Jordi|publisher=Editorial del Pacífico, S. A.|year=1966|isbn=|location=Santiago Chile|pages=246}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lived a normal life until, at the age of 11, he was captured by the Spanish and forced into servitude by Don Pedro de Valdivia and became his personal servant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=El toqui Lautaro (ca.1534-1557) - Memoria Chilena|url=http://www.memoriachilena.cl/602/w3-article-721.html|publisher=Biblioteca Nacional de Chile|language=spanish|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since it was difficult for the Spaniards to pronounce Lautaro’s original name, Leftraru, they gave him the name of Felipe Lautaro.  Don [[Pedro de Valdivia]] was a Spanish conqueror of [[Chile]] and then became the captain general of Chile.

Lautaro learned the military ways and skills of the Spaniards' army by observation. He was witness to atrocities committed by the Spanish on captive Mapuche warriors.  According to several historians, in the immediate vicinity of what is now the city of [[Concepción, Chile]], Pedro de Valdivia ordered his men to cut off the feet and hands of every Mapuche in Curiñancu's tribe, for resisting Spanish colonization, among them Curiñancu and his wife, Lautaro’s parents, in order to teach the Mapuche a lesson.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lautaro, Joven Libertador de Arauco|last=Alegría|first=Fernando|publisher=F. S. Crofts &amp; CO., INC.|year=1946|isbn=|location=New York|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that because of Valdivia’s command to cut off the toes of the Mapuche warriors, the Spanish soldiers named the place “El Valle de La Mocha”, whose name has been maintained over time.  A great hatred of the Spanish and particularly of Pedro de Valdivia was born in the young Lautaro because of this incident.  After his capture they made him a [[Yanakuna]], meaning a “black slave” in [[Quechuan languages|Quechua]].  He remained a prisoner of the Spanish for three years.  Because he kept his personal hatred of Valdivia hidden, Lautaro soon became his personal [[Page (servant)|page]].  Among his daily tasks as a page, he was in charge of taking care of Valdivia’s horses and always accompanying them into battle and military exercises.  This is how he learned not to fear horses and even become a good rider himself.

During this period he had a certain level of friendship with one of Valdivia’s principal captains by the name of Marcos Veas, who taught Lautaro how to use different kinds of weapons and cavalry tactics. This was a typical practice because as a yanakuna Lautaro was responsible to serve as an indigenous assistant during battles.

According to the Chilean novelist [[Isabel Allende]] in her historical novel, ''Inés del Alma Mía'', the boy Lautaro had deliberately allowed himself to be captured by the Spanish in order to learn their secrets, and made no attempt to escape until he felt he had learned enough. In any case, he fled twice, first in 1550 and for good in 1552. In 1553 (the year Lautaro turned 19), the Mapuches convened to decide how to respond to the Spanish invasion. The convention decided upon war. The ''[[toqui]]'' [[Caupolicán]] chose Lautaro as vice toqui because he had served as a [[page (servant)|page]] in the Spanish cavalry, and thereby possessed knowledge of how to defeat the mounted ''conquistadors''. Lautaro introduced [[horses in warfare|use of horses]] to the Mapuche{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} and designed better combat tactics. He organized a large, cohesive army—a military formation unfamiliar to the Mapuche.

==Campaigns==

===Battle of Tucapel===
[[File:El joven Lautaro - P. Subercaseaux.PNG|250px|thumbnail|right|Picture "El joven Lautaro" of [[Pedro Subercaseaux|P. Subercaseaux]], shows the military genius and expertise of his people.]]
With 6,000 warriors under his command, Lautaro attacked Fort Tucapel. The Spanish garrison couldn't withstand the assault and retreated to Purén. Lautaro seized the fort, sure that the Spaniards would attempt to retake it. That is exactly what Governor Valdivia tried to do with a reduced force, which was quickly surrounded and massacred by the Mapuches on Christmas Day, 1553. The [[Battle of Tucapel]] would be Pedro de Valdivia's last, as he was captured and then killed.{{sfn|Vivar|1987}}

After the defeat at Tucapel, the Spanish hastily reorganized their forces, reinforcing the defenses of Fort Imperial and abandoning the settlements of Confines and Arauco in order to strengthen Concepción. However, Mapuche tradition dictated a lengthy victory celebration, which kept Lautaro from realizing his desire to pursue the military advantage he had just gained. It was only in February 1554 that he succeeded in putting together an army of 8,000 men, just in time to confront a punitive expedition under the command of [[Francisco de Villagra]].

===Battle of Marihueñu===
Lautaro chose the hill of [[Marihueñu]] to fight the Spanish. He organized his forces in four divisions: two charged with containing and wearing down the enemy, a third held in reserve to launch a fresh attack as the Spanish were about to crumble, and the last charged with cutting off their retreat. Additionally, a small group was sent to destroy the reed bridge the Spanish had erected across the [[Bío-Bío River]], which would further disrupt any attempted retreat of Villagra.

The Spanish attack broke the first Mapuche lines, but the quick response of the third division maintained the Mapuche position. Later, the wings of this division began to attack the Spanish flanks, and the fourth division attacked from behind. After hours of battle, only a small group of Spanish managed to retreat. Despite this fresh victory, Lautaro was again unable to pursue the opportunity due to the celebrations and beliefs of his people. By the time he arrived at Concepción, it was already abandoned. He burned it, but his remaining forces were insufficient to continue the offensive, so the campaign came to an end.

In [[Santiago]], Villagra reorganized his forces, and that same year of 1554, he departed again for Arauco and reinforced the strongholds of Imperial and Valdivia, without any interference from the Mapuches, who were dealing with their first epidemic of [[smallpox]], which had been brought by the Spanish.

In 1555, the [[Real Audiencia of Lima]] ordered him to reconstruct Concepción, which was done under the command of Captain Alvarado. Upon learning of this, Lautaro successfully besieged Concepción with 4,000 warriors. Only 38 Spaniards managed to escape by sea the second destruction of the city.

===Peteroa and the Battle of Mataquito===
After the second rout at Concepción, Lautaro desired to attack [[Santiago]]. He found scant support for this plan from his troops, who soon dwindled to only 600, but he carried on. In October 1556 his northward march reached the [[Mataquito River]], where he established a fortified camp at [[Peteroa]]. In the [[Battle of Peteroa]] he repulsed attacking Spanish forces under the command of [[Diego Cano]], and later held off the larger force commanded by Pedro de Villagra. Being advised that still more Spaniards were approaching, Lautaro decided to retreat towards the [[Maule River]] losing 200 warriors. With the Spaniards in hot pursuit he was forced to retire beyond the [[Itata River]]. From there he launched another campaign towards Santiago when Villagra's army passed him by on the way to the save the remaining Spanish settlements in [[Araucanía (historic region)|Araucanía]]. Lautaro had chosen to give Villagra's force the slip and head for the city to attack it.

Despite the Mapuches' stealth, the city's leaders learned of the advance and sent a small expedition to thwart it, buying time for word to be sent to Villagra to return to the city from the south. The Spanish forces met in the field, and from a member of the local ethnos, the [[Picunche]], they learned the disposition of Lautaro's camp. At dawn, on April 29, 1557 the ''conquistadors'' launched a surprise attack from the hills of Caune, obtaining a decisive victory in the [[Battle of Mataquito]] in which Lautaro was killed early in the fighting. After the defeat of his army, his head was cut off and displayed in the plaza of Santiago.

==Legacy==
[[Alonso de Ercilla]], an officer in the Spanish forces early in the Araucanian war (who, as it happened, was only one year older than Lautaro), in the decade following his service composed that masterpiece of the Spanish Golden Age of literature—the [[epic poetry|epic]] poem, ''[[La Araucana]]--''in which Lautaro is a central figure.

Lautaro is acclaimed in Chile as its first general, for uniting the dispersed Mapuche people and leading them in battle. He inflicted crushing defeats on Spanish armies which had armored horsemen wielding swords, metal war clubs and steel-tipped lances, armored footmen as well, with their own swords and clubs, crossbows and arquebuses, even though his own Mapuche were armed only with slings, bows and arrows, wooden spears, clubs and axes.  Remarkably, he did this not fighting a "guerilla" war, but in pitched battle.

His name was used by [[Francisco de Miranda]] when he founded the [[Lautaro Lodge]], a secret Latin American independence society of the end of 18th century and the beginning of the 19th century. In the 20th century, Chilean author [[Pablo Neruda]], the future [[Nobel Literature Prize]] laureate, wrote a poem about him.

Lautaro appears in the 2018 video-game expansion ''[[Civilization VI: Rise and Fall]]'' as the Mapuche leader&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pcgamer.com/chilean-warchief-lautaro-will-lead-the-mapuche-into-battle-in-civilisation-6-rise-and-fall/ PC Gamer], PC Gamer&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Jean-Baptiste Poquelin''', known by his stage name '''Molière''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ɒ|l|ˈ|j|ɛər|,_|m|oʊ|l|-}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/molière "Molière"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-fr|mɔ.ljɛːʁ|lang}}; 15 January 1622{{snd}}17 February 1673), was a French playwright, actor and poet, widely regarded as one of the greatest writers in the French language and universal literature. His extant works includes [[comedie]]s, [[farce]]s, [[Tragicomedy|tragicomedies]], [[comédie-ballet]]s, and more. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed at the [[Comédie-Française]] more often than those of any other playwright today.&lt;ref&gt;Hartnoll, p. 554. "Author of some of the finest comedies in the history of the theater", and Roy, p. 756. "...one of the theatre's greatest comic artists".&lt;/ref&gt;

Born into a prosperous family and having studied at the Collège de Clermont (now [[Lycée Louis-le-Grand]]), Molière was well suited to begin a life in the theatre. Thirteen years as an itinerant actor helped him polish his comic abilities while he began writing, combining [[Commedia dell'arte]] elements with the more refined French comedy.&lt;ref&gt;Roy, p. 756.&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the patronage of aristocrats including [[Philippe I, Duke of Orléans]]—the brother of [[Louis XIV]]—Molière procured a command performance before the King at the [[Louvre]]. Performing a classic play by [[Pierre Corneille]] and a [[farce]] of his own, ''The Doctor in Love'', Molière was granted the use of salle du [[Petit-Bourbon]] near the Louvre, a spacious room appointed for theatrical performances. Later, he was granted the use of the [[Théâtre du Palais-Royal (rue Saint-Honoré)|theatre in the Palais-Royal]]. In both locations Molière found success among Parisians with plays such as ''[[The Affected Ladies]]'', ''[[The School for Husbands]]'' and ''[[The School for Wives]]''. This royal favour brought a royal [[pension]] to his troupe and the title ''Troupe du Roi'' ("The King's Troupe"). Molière continued as the official author of court entertainments.&lt;ref name = "R7567"&gt;Roy, p. 756–757.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the adulation of the court and Parisians, Molière's satires attracted criticism from churchmen.  For ''[[Tartuffe]]'s'' impiety, the Catholic Church denounced this study of religious hypocrisy followed by the Parliament's ban, while ''[[Dom Juan|Don Juan]]'' was withdrawn and never restaged by Molière. [https://books.google.com/books?id=8qMTPAPFGXUC&amp;pg=PA757]  His hard work in so many theatrical capacities took its toll on his health and, by 1667, he was forced to take a break from the stage. In 1673, during a production of his final play, ''The Imaginary Invalid'', Molière, who suffered from pulmonary [[tuberculosis]], was seized by a coughing fit and a haemorrhage while playing the [[hypochondriac]] Argan. He finished the performance but collapsed again and died a few hours later.&lt;ref name = "R7567"/&gt;

==Life==
[[File:Molière - Nicolas Mignard (1658).jpg|thumb|Portrait of Molière by [[Nicolas Mignard]]]]

Molière was born in Paris, the son of Jean Poquelin and Marie Cressé, the daughter of a prosperous [[bourgeois]] family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Lives of the Most Eminent French Writers |last=Shelley |first=Mary Wollstonecraft |authorlink= |year= 1840 |publisher= Lea and Blanchard |location= Philadelphia |isbn= |page= 116 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=qjoOAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=lives+of+the+most+eminent+french+writers&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon seeing him for the first time, a maid exclaimed, "Le nez!", a reference to the infant's large nose.  Molière was called "Le Nez" by his family from that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=History of the Theatre |last=Brockett |first=Oscar |publisher=Pearson |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-205-51186-0 |location=USA |pages=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lost his mother when he was ten and he did not seem to have been particularly close to his father. After his mother's death, he lived with his father above the ''Pavillon des Singes'' on the [[rue Saint-Honoré]], an affluent area of Paris. It is likely{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} that his education commenced with studies in a Parisian elementary school; this was followed with his enrollment in the prestigious [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[Collège de Clermont]], where he completed his studies in a strict academic environment and got a first taste of life on the stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John W. |last=O'Malley |title=The Jesuits; a history from Ignatius to the present |location=London |publisher=Sheed and Ward |date=2014 |page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1631, Jean Poquelin purchased from the court of [[Louis XIII]] the posts of "{{italics correction|''valet de chambre ordinaire et tapissier du Roi''}}" ("valet of the King's chamber and keeper of carpets and upholstery"). His son assumed the same posts in 1641.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Simon, ''Molière, une vie'' (Lyon: La Manufacture, 1988), pp. 520-21.&lt;/ref&gt; The title required only three months' work and an initial cost of 1,200 livres; the title paid 300 livres a year and provided a number of lucrative contracts. Poquelin also studied as a provincial lawyer some time around 1642, probably in [[Orléans]], but it is not documented that he ever qualified. So far he had followed his father's plans, which had served him well; he had mingled with nobility at the Collège de Clermont and seemed destined for a career in office.

In June 1643, when Molière was 21, he decided to abandon his social class and pursue a career on the stage. Taking leave of his father, he joined the actress [[Madeleine Béjart]], with whom he had crossed paths before, and founded the [[Illustre Théâtre]] with 630 livres. They were later joined by Madeleine's brother and sister.

[[File:Les Contretemps.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Illustration after [[Pierre Brissart]] for the printed text of ''[[L'Étourdi ou les Contretemps]]'']]

The new theatre troupe went [[bankrupt]] in 1645. Molière had become head of the troupe, due in part, perhaps, to his acting prowess and his legal training. However, the troupe had acquired large debts, mostly for the rent of the theatre (a court for [[jeu de paume]]), for which they owed 2000 livres. Historians differ as to whether his father or the lover of a member of his troupe paid his debts; either way, after a 24-hour stint in prison he returned to the acting circuit. It was at this time that he began to use the pseudonym ''Molière'', possibly inspired by a small village of the same name in the [[South of France|Midi]] near [[Le Vigan, Lot|Le Vigan]]. It was also likely that he changed his name to spare his father the shame of having an actor in the family (actors, although no longer vilified by the state under Louis XIV, were still not allowed to be buried in sacred ground).

After his imprisonment, he and Madeleine began a theatrical circuit of the provinces with a new [[Troupe de Molière|theatre troupe]]; this life was to last about twelve years, during which he initially played in the company of [[Charles Dufresne (actor)|Charles Dufresne]], and subsequently created a company of his own, which had sufficient success and obtained the patronage of [[Philippe I, Duke of Orléans]]. Few plays survive from this period. The most noteworthy are ''[[L'Étourdi ou les Contretemps]]'' ''(The Bungler)'' and ''[[Le Docteur Amoureux]]'' ''(The Doctor in Love)''; with these two plays, Molière moved away from the heavy influence of the Italian improvisational [[Commedia dell'arte]], and displayed his talent for mockery. In the course of his travels he met [[Armand, Prince of Conti]], the governor of [[Languedoc]], who became his patron, and named his company after him. This friendship later ended when Armand, having contracted [[syphilis]] from a courtesan, turned towards religion and joined Molière's enemies in the ''Parti des Dévots'' and the ''Compagnie de Saint Sacrement''.

In [[Lyon]], [[Mademoiselle Du Parc]], known as ''Marquise'', joined the company. Marquise was courted, in vain, by [[Pierre Corneille]] and later became the lover of [[Jean Racine]]. Racine offered Molière his tragedy ''[[Théagène et Chariclée]]'' (one of the first works he wrote after he had abandoned his [[theology]] studies), but Molière would not perform it, though he encouraged Racine to pursue his artistic career. It is said that soon thereafter Molière became angry with Racine when he was told that he had secretly presented his [[tragedy]] to the company of the [[Hôtel de Bourgogne (theatre)|Hôtel de Bourgogne]] as well.

===Return to Paris===
Molière was forced to reach Paris in stages, staying outside for a few weeks in order to promote himself with society gentlemen and allow his reputation to feed in to Paris. Molière reached Paris in 1658 and performed in front of the King at the [[Louvre]] (then for rent as a theatre) in Corneille's tragedy ''Nicomède'' and in the [[farce]] ''Le Docteur Amoureux'' with some success. He was awarded the title of ''Troupe de Monsieur'' ([[Monsieur]] being the honorific for the king's brother [[Philippe I, Duke of Orléans]]). With the help of Monsieur, his company was allowed to share the theatre in the large hall of the [[Petit-Bourbon]] with the famous Italian [[Commedia dell'arte]] company of [[Tiberio Fiorillo]], famous for his character of [[Scaramuccia|Scaramouche]]. (The two companies performed in the theatre on different nights.) The premiere of Molière's ''Les Précieuses Ridicules'' (''[[Les Précieuses Ridicules|The Affected Young Ladies]]'') took place at the Petit-Bourbon on 18 November 1659.

''Les Précieuses Ridicules'' was the first of Molière's many attempts to satirize certain societal mannerisms and affectations then common in France. It is widely accepted that the plot was based on [[Samuel Chappuzeau]]'s ''Le Cercle des Femmes'' of 1656. He primarily mocks the [[Académie Française]], a group created by Richelieu under a royal patent to establish the rules of the fledgling French theater. The Académie preached unity of time, action, and styles of verse. Molière is often associated with the claim that comedy ''castigat ridendo mores'' or "criticises customs through humour" (a phrase in fact coined by his contemporary Jean de Santeuil and sometimes mistaken for a classical [[List of Latin phrases|Latin proverb]]).&lt;ref&gt;Martin Barnham. "The Cambridge Guide to Theater." Cambridge Univ. Pr., 1995, p. 472.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Height of fame===
Despite his own preference for [[tragedy]], which he had tried to further with the Illustre Théâtre, Molière became famous for his [[farce]]s, which were generally in one act and performed after the tragedy. Some of these farces were only partly written, and were played in the style of Commedia dell'arte with improvisation over a [[canovaccio]] (a vague plot outline). He also wrote two comedies in verse, but these were less successful and are generally considered less significant. Later in life Molière concentrated on writing musical comedies, in which the drama is interrupted by songs and/or dances.

''Les Précieuses Ridicules'' won Molière the attention and the criticism of many, but it was not a popular success. He then asked Fiorillo to teach him the techniques of Commedia dell'arte. His 1660 play ''Sganarelle, ou Le Cocu imaginaire'' (''[[The Imaginary Cuckold]]'') seems to be a tribute both to Commedia dell'arte and to his teacher. Its theme of marital relationships dramatizes Molière's pessimistic views on the falsity inherent in human relationships. This view is also evident in his later works, and was a source of inspiration for many later authors, including (in a different field and with different effect) [[Luigi Pirandello]]. It describes a kind of round dance where two couples believe that each of their partners has been betrayed by the other's and is the first in Molière's 'Jealousy series' which includes ''Dom Garcie de Navarre'', ''L'École des maris'' and ''L'École des femmes''.
[[Image:WorksMoliere1739Vol01.jpg|thumb|300px|First volume of a 1739 translation into English of all of Molière's plays, printed by John Watts.]]

In 1660 the Petit-Bourbon was demolished to make way for the eastern expansion of the Louvre, but Molière's company was allowed to move into the abandoned [[Théâtre du Palais-Royal (rue Saint-Honoré)|theatre in the east wing of the Palais-Royal]]. After a period of refurbishment they opened there on 20 January 1661. In order to please his patron, Monsieur, who was so enthralled with entertainment and art that he was soon excluded from state affairs, Molière wrote and played ''Dom Garcie de Navarre ou Le Prince jaloux'' (''[[The Jealous Prince]]'', 4 February 1661), a heroic comedy derived from a work of Cicognini's. Two other comedies of the same year were the successful ''L'École des maris'' (''[[The School for Husbands]]'') and ''[[Les Fâcheux]]'', subtitled ''Comédie faite pour les divertissements du Roi'' (a comedy for the King's amusements) because it was performed during a series of parties that [[Nicolas Fouquet]] gave in honor of the sovereign. These entertainments led [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] to demand the arrest of Fouquet for wasting public money, and he was condemned to life imprisonment.

On 20 February 1662 Molière married [[Armande Béjart]], whom he believed to be the sister of Madeleine. (She may instead have been her illegitimate daughter with the [[Duke of Modena]].) The same year he premiered ''L'École des femmes'' (''[[The School for Wives]]''), subsequently regarded as a masterpiece. It poked fun at the limited education that was given to daughters of rich families, and reflected Molière's own marriage. Both this work and his marriage attracted much criticism. The play sparked the protest called the "Quarrel of L'École des femmes". On the artistic side he responded with two lesser-known works: ''La Critique de "L'École des femmes"'', in which he imagined the spectators of his previous work attending it. The piece mocks the people who had criticised ''L'École des femmes'' by showing them at dinner after watching the play; it addresses all the criticism raised about the piece by presenting the critics' arguments and then dismissing them. This was the so-called ''Guerre comique'' (''War of Comedy''), in which the opposite side was taken by writers like [[Donneau de Visé]], [[Edmé Boursault]], and [[Antoine Jacob|Montfleury]].

But more serious opposition was brewing, focusing on Molière's politics and his personal life. A so-called ''parti des Dévots'' arose in French high society, who protested against Molière's excessive "[[Literary realism|realism]]" and irreverence, which were causing some embarrassment. These people accused Molière of having married his daughter. The Prince of Conti, once Molière's friend, joined them. Molière had other enemies, too, among them the [[Jansenist]]s and some traditional authors. However, the king expressed support for the author, granting him a [[pension]] and agreeing to be the godfather of Molière's first son. [[Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux|Boileau]] also supported him through statements that he included in his ''Art poétique''.

Molière's friendship with [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]] influenced him towards writing his ''Le Mariage forcé'' and ''La Princesse d'Élide'' (subtitled as ''Comédie galante mêlée de musique et d'entrées de ballet''), written for royal "''divertissements''" at the [[Palace of Versailles]].

''[[Tartuffe]], ou L'Imposteur'' was also performed at Versailles, in 1664, and created the greatest [[scandal]] of Molière's artistic career. Its depiction of the hypocrisy of the dominant classes was taken as an outrage and violently contested. It also aroused the wrath of the Jansenists and the play was banned.

Molière was always careful not to attack the institution of monarchy. He earned a position as one of the king's favourites and enjoyed his protection from the attacks of the court. The king allegedly suggested that Molière suspend performances of ''Tartuffe'', and the author rapidly wrote ''[[Dom Juan|Dom Juan ou le Festin de Pierre]]'' to replace it. It was a strange work, derived from a work by [[Tirso de Molina]] and rendered in a [[prose]] that still seems modern today. It describes the story of an atheist who becomes a religious hypocrite and for this is punished by God. This work too was quickly suspended. The king, demonstrating his protection once again, became the new official sponsor of Molière's troupe.

With music by [[Jean-Baptiste Lully|Lully]], Molière presented ''[[L'Amour médecin]]'' (''Love Doctor'' or ''Medical Love''). Subtitles on this occasion reported that the work was given "par ordre du Roi" (by order of the king) and this work was received much more warmly than its predecessors.

In 1666, ''[[Le Misanthrope]]'' was produced. It is now widely regarded as Molière's most refined masterpiece, the one with the highest moral content, but it was little appreciated at its time. It caused the "conversion" of Donneau de Visé, who became fond of his theatre. But it was a commercial flop, forcing Molière to immediately write ''[[Le médecin malgré lui]]'' (''The Doctor Despite Himself''), a satire against the official sciences. This was a success despite a moral treatise by the Prince of Conti, criticizing the theater in general and Molière's in particular. In several of his plays, Molière depicted the physicians of his day as pompous individuals who speak (poor) Latin to impress others with false erudition, and know only [[clyster]]s and [[bleeding]]s as (ineffective) remedies.

After the ''Mélicerte'' and the ''Pastorale comique'', he tried again to perform a revised ''Tartuffe'' in 1667, this time with the name of ''Panulphe'' or ''L'Imposteur''. As soon as the King left Paris for a tour, [[Guillaume de Lamoignon|Lamoignon]] and the archbishop banned the play. The King finally imposed respect for ''Tartuffe'' a few years later, after he had gained more power over the clergy.

Molière, now ill, wrote less. ''Le Sicilien ou L'Amour peintre'' was written for festivities at the [[castle of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], and was followed in 1668 by ''[[Amphitryon (Molière)|Amphitryon]]'', inspired both by [[Plautus]]' work of the same name and Jean Rotrou's successful reconfiguration of the drama. With some conjecture, Molière's play can be seen to allude to the love affairs of Louis XIV, then king of France. ''[[George Dandin ou le Mari confondu|George Dandin, ou Le mari confondu]]'' (''The Confounded Husband'') was little appreciated, but success returned with ''L'Avare'' (''[[The Miser]]''), now very well known.

With Lully he again used music for ''Monsieur de Pourceaugnac'', for ''Les Amants magnifiques'', and finally for ''[[Le Bourgeois gentilhomme]]'' (''The Middle Class Gentleman''), another of his masterpieces. It is claimed to be particularly directed against Colbert, the minister who had condemned his old patron Fouquet. The collaboration with Lully ended with a ''tragédie et ballet'', ''[[Psyché (play)|Psyché]]'', written in collaboration with [[Pierre Corneille]] and [[Philippe Quinault]].

In 1672, Madeleine Béjart died, and Molière suffered from this loss and from the worsening of his own illness. Nevertheless, he wrote a successful ''[[Les Fourberies de Scapin]]'' ("Scapin's Deceits"), a farce and a comedy in five acts. His following play, ''La Comtesse d'Escarbagnas'', is considered one of his lesser works.

''Les Femmes savantes'' (''[[The Learned Ladies]]'') of 1672 is considered another of Molière's masterpieces. It was born from the termination of the legal use of music in theater, since Lully had patented the [[opera]] in France (and taken most of the best available singers for his own performances), so Molière had to go back to his traditional genre. It was a great success, and it led to his last work (see below), which is still held in high esteem.

In his 14 years in Paris, Molière singlehandedly wrote 31 of the 85 plays performed on his stage.

===Les Comédies-Ballets===
In 1661, Molière introduced the ''[[comédies-ballets]]'' in conjunction with ''Les Fâcheux''.  These ballets were a transitional form of dance performance between the [[court ballets of Louis XIV]] and the art of professional theatre which was developing in the advent of the use of the [[proscenium stage]].&lt;ref name="Au 2002 23"&gt;{{cite book|last=Au|first=Susan|title=Ballet and Modern Dance - Second Edition|year=2002|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson LTD|location=London|isbn=978-0-500-20352-1|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The ''comédies-ballets'' developed accidentally when Molière was enlisted to mount both a play and a ballet in the honor of Louis XIV and found that he did not have a big enough cast to meet these demands.  Molière therefore decided to combine the ballet and the play so that his goal could be met while the performers catch their breath and change costume.&lt;ref name="Au 2002 23"/&gt;  The risky move paid off and Molière was asked to produce twelve more ''comédies-ballets'' before his death.&lt;ref name="Au 2002 23"/&gt;  During the ''comédies-ballets'', Molière collaborated with [[Pierre Beauchamp]].&lt;ref name="Au 2002 23"/&gt; Beauchamp codified the five balletic positions of the feet and arms and was partly responsible for the creation of the [[Beauchamp-Feuillet dance notation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Au|first=Susan|title=Ballet and Modern Dance - Second Edition|year=2002|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson LTD|location=London|isbn=978-0-500-20352-1|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Molière also collaborated with Jean-Baptiste Lully.&lt;ref name="Au 2002 23"/&gt;  Lully was a dancer, choreographer, and composer, whose dominant reign at the [[Paris Opéra]] lasted fifteen years.  Under his command, ballet and opera rightly became professional arts unto themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Au|first=Susan|title=Ballet and Modern Dance - Second Edition|year=2002|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson LTD|location=London|isbn=978-0-500-20352-1|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''comédies-ballets'' closely integrated dance with music and the action of the play and the style of continuity distinctly separated these performances from the court ballets of the time;&lt;ref name="Au 2002 24"&gt;{{cite book|last=Au|first=Susan|title=Ballet and Modern Dance - Second Edition|year=2002|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson LTD|location=London|isbn=978-0-500-20352-1|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  additionally, the ''comédies-ballets'' demanded that both the dancers and the actors play an important role in advancing the story.  Similar to the court ballets, both professionally trained dancers and courtiers socialized together at the ''comédies-ballets'' - Louis XIV even played the part of an Egyptian in Molière's ''Le Mariage forcé'' (1664) and also appeared as [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] and [[Apollo]] in his retirement performance of ''Les Amants magnifiques'' (1670).&lt;ref name="Au 2002 24"/&gt;

==Death==
[[Image:Perelachaise-Moliere-p1000403.jpg|thumb|Molière's tomb at the [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]]. [[Jean de La Fontaine|La Fontaine]]'s is visible just beyond.]]
Molière suffered from pulmonary [[tuberculosis]], possibly contracted when he was imprisoned for debt as a young man. One of the most famous moments in Molière's life was his last, which became legend: he collapsed on stage in a fit of [[Hemoptysis|coughing and haemorrhaging]] while performing in the last play he had written, which had lavish ballets performed to the music of [[Marc-Antoine Charpentier]] and which ironically was entitled ''[[Le Malade imaginaire]]'' (''The Imaginary Invalid''). Molière insisted on completing his performance. Afterwards he collapsed again with another, larger haemorrhage before being taken home, where he died a few hours later, without receiving the [[last rites]] because two priests refused to visit him while a third arrived too late. The superstition that green brings [[superstition|bad luck]] to actors is said to originate from the colour of the clothing he was wearing at the time of his death.

Under French law at the time, actors were not allowed to be [[Actor#History|buried in the sacred ground]] of a cemetery. However, Molière's widow, Armande, asked the King if her spouse could be granted a normal funeral at night. The King agreed and Molière's body was buried in the part of the cemetery reserved for unbaptised infants.

In 1792 his remains were brought to the museum of French monuments and in 1817 transferred to [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]] in Paris, close to those of [[Jean de La Fontaine|La Fontaine]].

==Reception of his works==
[[Image:Moliere-Rue de Richelieu.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Molière statue on the [[Fontaine Molière]], corner of [[Rue de Richelieu]] and Rue Molière in Paris]]

Though conventional thinkers, religious leaders, and medical professionals in Molière's time criticised his work, their ideas did not really diminish his widespread success with the public. Other playwrights and companies began to emulate his dramatic style in England and in France. Molière's works continued to garner positive feedback in 18th-century England, but they were not so warmly welcomed in France at this time. However, during the French Restoration of the 19th century, Molière's comedies became popular with both the French public and the critics. Romanticists admired his plays for the unconventional individualism they portrayed. 20th-century scholars have carried on this interest in Molière and his plays and have continued to study a wide array of issues relating to this playwright. Many critics now are shifting their attention from the philosophical, religious, and moral implications in his comedies to the more objective study of his comic technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/drama-criticism/moliere |title="Molière: Introduction" '&amp;#39;Drama Criticism'&amp;#39;.

Molière's works were translated into English prose by [[John Ozell]] in 1714,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nWpBAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Curtis%20Hidden%20Page&amp;pg=PR43#v=onepage&amp;q=Curtis%20Hidden%20Page&amp;f=false |title="Bibliography" in Curtis Hidden Page, trans., ''French Classics for English Readers: Molière'' New York &amp; London, G.P.

In his memoir ''A Terrible Liar'', actor [[Hume Cronyn]] writes that, in 1962, celebrated actor [[Laurence Olivier]] criticized Molière in a conversation with him. According to Cronyn, he mentioned to Olivier that he (Cronyn) was about to play the title role in ''The Miser'', and that Olivier then responded, "Molière? Funny as a baby's open grave." Cronyn comments on the incident: "You may imagine how that made me feel. Fortunately, he was dead wrong."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1hjeBNsCkOgC&amp;q=%22Funny+as+a+baby%27s+open+grave%22&amp;dq=%22Funny+as+a+baby%27s+open+grave%22|title=Hume Cronyn, ''A Terrible Liar: A Memoir'', New York: Morrow, 1991, p. 275.

Author Martha Bellinger points out that:

{{quote|[Molière] has been accused of not having a consistent, organic style, of using faulty grammar, of mixing his metaphors, and of using unnecessary words for the purpose of filling out his lines. All these things are occasionally true, but they are trifles in comparison to the wealth of character he portrayed, to his brilliancy of wit, and to the resourcefulness of his technique. He was wary of sensibility or pathos; but in place of pathos he had "melancholy—a puissant and searching melancholy, which strangely sustains his inexhaustible mirth and his triumphant gaiety".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theatredatabase.com/17th_century/moliere_001.html |title=Bellinger, Martha Fletcher (1927) '&amp;#39;A Short History of the Drama'&amp;#39; New York: Henry Holt &amp; Company. pp. 178-81.

==Influence on French culture==
Molière is considered the creator of modern French comedy. Many words or phrases used in Molière's plays are still used in current French:
*A ''[[tartuffe]]'' is a hypocrite, especially a hypocrite displaying affected morality or religious piety.
*A ''[[harpagon]]'', named after the main character of ''[[The Miser]]'', is an obsessively greedy and cheap man.
*The statue of the Commander (''statue du Commandeur'') from Don Juan is used as a model of implacable rigidity (''raide comme la statue du Commandeur'').
*In ''[[Les Fourberies de Scapin]]'', Act II, scene 7, Géronte is asked for ransom money for his son, allegedly held in a [[galley]]. He repeats, "What the deuce did he want to go in that galley for?" ("Que diable allait-il faire dans cette galère?") The phrase "to go on that galley" is used to describe unnecessary difficulties a person has sought.
*In ''[[Le médecin malgré lui]]'', forced to impersonate a doctor, the chancer Sganarelle examines a young woman who is faking muteness in order to delay an arranged marriage.  He then delivers to her father a "[[diagnosis]]" which consists of strings of gobbledygook, [[dog latin]] and recursive explanations which conclude with an authoritative "and so that is why your daughter is mute" ("Et voilà pourquoi votre fille est muette").  The phrase is used wholesale to mock an unsatisfactory explanation.

==Portrayals of Molière==
{{French literature}}
Molière plays a small part in [[Alexandre Dumas]]'s novel ''[[The Vicomte of Bragelonne]]'', in which he is seen taking inspiration from the muskeeter [[Porthos]] for his central character in ''[[Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme]]''.

Russian writer [[Mikhail Bulgakov]] wrote a semi-fictitious biography-tribute to Molière, titled ''Life of Mr. de Molière''. Written 1932–1933, first published 1962.

The French 1978 film simply titled ''[[Molière (1978 film)|Molière]]'' directed by [[Ariane Mnouchkine]] and starring [[Philippe Caubère]] presents his complete biography. It was in competition for the [[Palme d'Or]] at Cannes in 1978.

He is portrayed among other writers in ''[[The Blasphemers' Banquet]]'' (1989).

The 2000 film ''[[Le Roi Danse]]'' (''The King Dances''), in which Molière is played by [[Tchéky Karyo]], shows his collaborations with [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]], as well as his illness and on-stage death.
The 2007 French film ''[[Molière (2007 film)|Molière]]'' was more loosely based on the life of Molière, starring [[Romain Duris]], [[Fabrice Luchini]] and [[Ludivine Sagnier]].

Born and raised in the Austrian Empire, Tesla received an advanced education in engineering and physics in the 1870s and gained practical experience in the early 1880s working in [[telephony]] and at Continental Edison in the new [[electric power industry]]. He emigrated to the United States in 1884, where he would become a naturalized citizen. He worked for a short time at the [[Edison Machine Works]] in New York City before he struck out on his own. With the help of partners to finance and market his ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices. His [[alternating current]] (AC) [[induction motor]] and related [[Polyphase system|polyphase]] AC patents, licensed by [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation|Westinghouse Electric]] in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system which that company would eventually market.

Attempting to develop inventions he could patent and market, Tesla conducted a range of experiments with mechanical oscillators/generators, electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging. He also built a wireless-controlled boat, one of the first ever exhibited. Tesla became well known as an inventor and would demonstrate his achievements to celebrities and wealthy patrons at his lab, and was noted for his showmanship at public lectures. Throughout the 1890s, Tesla pursued his ideas for wireless lighting and worldwide wireless electric power distribution in his high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments in New York and [[Colorado Springs]]. In 1893, he made pronouncements on the possibility of [[wireless communication]] with his devices. Tesla tried to put these ideas to practical use in his unfinished [[Wardenclyffe Tower]] project, an intercontinental wireless communication and power transmitter, but ran out of funding before he could complete it.&lt;ref name="tsteslatower"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tesla Tower in Shoreham, Suffolk County (Long Island), 1901–17) meant to be the "World Wireless" Broadcasting system|url=http://www.teslasociety.com/teslatower.htm|publisher=Tesla Memorial Society of New York|accessdate=3 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Wardenclyffe, Tesla experimented with a series of inventions in the 1910s and 1920s with varying degrees of success. Having spent most of his money, Tesla lived in a series of New York hotels, leaving behind unpaid bills. He died in New York City in January 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Shei|first=Tim|title=Marconi and Tesla: Pioneers of Radio Communication|year=2008|publisher=MyReportLinks.com Books|isbn=978-1-59845-076-7|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tesla's work fell into relative obscurity following his death, until 1960, when the [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] named the [[SI unit]] of [[magnetic flux density]] the [[tesla (unit)|tesla]] in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcome to the Tesla Memorial Society of New York Website|url=http://www.teslasociety.com/mri_digest.htm |publisher=Tesla Memorial Society of New York|accessdate=3 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been a resurgence in popular interest in Tesla since the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Van Riper|2011|p=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nikola Tesla birth certificate.png|thumb|upright|Tesla's baptismal record, 28 June 1856]]

Nikola Tesla was born an ethnic [[Serbs|Serb]] in the village [[Smiljan]], [[Lika]] county, in the [[Austrian Empire]] (present day Croatia), on {{OldStyleDateNY|10 July|28 June}} 1856.{{sfn|Cheney|Uth|Glenn|1999|p=143}}{{sfn|O'Neill|2007|pp=9, 12}} His father, Milutin Tesla (1819–1879),{{sfn|Carlson|2013|p=14}} was an [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] priest.{{sfn|Dommermuth-Costa|1994|p=12|loc="Milutin, Nikola's father, was a well-educated priest of the Serbian Orthodox Church."}}{{sfn|Cheney|2011|p=25|loc="The tiny house in which he was born stood next to the Serbian Orthodox Church presided over by his father, the Reverend Milutin Tesla, who sometimes wrote articles under the nom-de-plume 'Man of Justice'"}}{{sfn|Carlson|2013|p=14|loc="Following a reprimand at school for not keeping his brass buttons polished, he quit and instead chose to become a priest in the Serbian Orthodox Church"}}{{sfn|Burgan|2009|p=17|loc="Nikola's father, Milutin was a Serbian Orthodox priest and had been sent to Smiljan by his church."}} Tesla's mother, Đuka Tesla (née Mandić; 1822–1892), whose father was also an Orthodox priest,{{sfn|O'Neill|1944|p=10}} had a talent for making home craft tools and mechanical appliances and the ability to memorize [[Serbian epic poetry|Serbian epic poems]]. Đuka had never received a formal education. Tesla credited his [[eidetic memory]] and creative abilities to his mother's genetics and influence.{{sfn|Cheney|2001}}{{sfn|Seifer|2001|p=7}} Tesla's progenitors were from western Serbia, near Montenegro.{{sfn|O'Neill|1944|p=12}}

Tesla was the fourth of five children. He had three sisters, Milka, Angelina and Marica, and an older brother named Dane, who was killed in a horse riding accident when Tesla was aged five.{{sfn|Carlson|2013|p=21}} In 1861, Tesla attended primary school in [[Smiljan]] where he studied German, arithmetic, and religion.&lt;ref name="teslatimeline"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nikola Tesla Timeline from Tesla Universe|url=https://teslauniverse.com/nikola-tesla/timeline|website=Tesla Universe|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1862, the Tesla family moved to the nearby [[Gospić]], [[Lika]] where Tesla's father worked as parish priest. Nikola completed primary school, followed by middle school.&lt;ref name="teslatimeline"/&gt;

In 1870, Tesla moved far north to [[Karlovac]]&lt;ref name="tesla1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tesla|first1=Nikola|title=My inventions: the autobiography of Nikola Tesla|date=2011|publisher=Martino Fine Books|location=Eastford|isbn=978-1-61427-084-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; to attend high school at the [[Gymnasium Karlovac|Higher Real Gymnasium]]. The classes were held in German, as it was a school within the Austro-Hungarian [[Military Frontier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tesla|first1=Nikola|last2=Marinčić|first2=Aleksandar|title=From Colorado Springs to Long Island: research notes |date=2008|publisher=Nikola Tesla Museum|location=Belgrade|isbn=978-86-81243-44-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Milutin Tesla.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Tesla's father, Milutin, was an [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] priest in the village of [[Smiljan]]]]

Tesla would later write that he became interested in demonstrations of electricity by his physics professor.&lt;ref&gt;Tesla does not mention which professor this was by name, but some sources point conclude this was Prof [[Martin Sekulić]].&lt;/ref&gt; Tesla noted that these demonstrations of this "mysterious phenomena" made him want "to know more of this wonderful force".{{sfn|Carlson|2013|p=32}} Tesla was able to perform [[integral|integral calculus]] in his head, which prompted his teachers to believe that he was cheating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tesla Life and Legacy&amp;nbsp;– Tesla's Early Years|url=https://www.pbs.org/tesla/ll/ll_early.html|publisher=PBS|accessdate=8 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished a four-year term in three years, graduating in 1873.{{sfn|O'Neill|1944|p=33}}

In 1873, Tesla returned to Smiljan. Shortly after he arrived, he contracted [[cholera]], was bedridden for nine months and was near death multiple times. Tesla's father, in a moment of despair, (who had originally wanted him to enter the priesthood)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Glenn|first=edited by Jim|title=The complete patents of Nikola Tesla|year=1994|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble Books|location=New York|isbn=1-56619-266-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; promised to send him to the best engineering school if he recovered from the illness.&lt;ref name="tesla1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="teslatimeline" /&gt;

In 1874, Tesla evaded [[conscription]] into the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] in Smiljan{{sfn|Seifer|2001}} by running away southeast of Lika to [[Tomingaj]], near [[Gračac]]. There he explored the mountains wearing hunter's garb. Tesla said that this contact with nature made him stronger, both physically and mentally.&lt;ref name="teslatimeline"/&gt; He read many books while in Tomingaj and later said that [[Mark Twain]]'s works had helped him to miraculously recover from his earlier illness.&lt;ref name="tesla1" /&gt;

In 1875, Tesla enrolled at [[Graz University of Technology|Austrian Polytechnic]] in [[Graz]], [[Austria]], on a Military Frontier scholarship. During his first year, Tesla never missed a lecture, earned the highest grades possible, passed nine exams&lt;ref name="tesla1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="teslatimeline" /&gt; (nearly twice as many as required{{sfn|O'Neill|1944|p=?}}), started a Serb cultural club,&lt;ref name="teslatimeline"/&gt; and even received a letter of commendation from the dean of the technical faculty to his father, which stated, "Your son is a star of first rank."{{sfn|O'Neill|1944|p=?}} During his second year, Tesla came into conflict with Professor Poeschl over the [[Gramme machine|Gramme dynamo]], when Tesla suggested that commutators were not necessary.

Tesla claimed that he worked from 3&amp;nbsp;a.m. to 11&amp;nbsp;p.m., no Sundays or holidays excepted.&lt;ref name="tesla1"/&gt; He was "mortified when [his] father made light of [those] hard won honors." After his father's death in 1879,{{sfn|Seifer|2001}} Tesla found a package of letters from his professors to his father, warning that unless he were removed from the school, Tesla would die through overwork. At the end of his second year, Tesla lost his scholarship and became addicted to gambling.&lt;ref name="tesla1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="teslatimeline"/&gt; During his third year, Tesla gambled away his allowance and his tuition money, later gambling back his initial losses and returning the balance to his family. Tesla said that he "conquered [his] passion then and there," but later in the U.S. he was again known to play [[billiards]]. When examination time came, Tesla was unprepared and asked for an extension to study, but was denied. He did not receive grades for the last semester of the third year and he never graduated from the university.{{sfn|Seifer|2001}}

[[File:Tesla 1879 teslauniverse.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Tesla aged 23, {{circa|1879}}]]

In December 1878, Tesla left [[Graz]] and severed all relations with his family to hide the fact that he dropped out of school.{{sfn|Seifer|2001}} His friends thought that he had drowned in the nearby [[Mur River]].{{sfn|Seifer|2001|p=18}} Tesla moved to [[Maribor]], where he worked as a draftsman for 60 florins per month. He spent his spare time playing cards with local men on the streets.{{sfn|Seifer|2001}}

In March 1879, Tesla's father went to Maribor to beg his son to return home, but he refused.&lt;ref name="teslatimeline" /&gt; Nikola suffered a [[nervous breakdown]] around the same time.{{sfn|Seifer|2001|p=18}} On 24 March 1879, Tesla was returned to Gospić under police guard for not having a residence permit.

On 17 April 1879, Milutin Tesla died at the age of 60 after contracting an unspecified illness.&lt;ref name="teslatimeline" /&gt; Some sources say that he died of a stroke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Timeline of Nikola Tesla|url=http://www.teslasociety.org/timeline.html|publisher=Tesla Memorial Society of NY|accessdate=1 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508181221/http://www.teslasociety.org/timeline.html|archivedate=8 May 2012}} {{better source|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During that year, Tesla taught a large class of students in his old school in Gospić.&lt;ref name="teslatimeline" /&gt;

In January 1880, two of Tesla's uncles put together enough money to help him leave Gospić for [[Prague]], where he was to study. He arrived too late to enroll at [[Charles University in Prague|Charles-Ferdinand University]]; he had never studied Greek, a required subject; and he was illiterate in [[Czech (language)|Czech]], another required subject. Tesla did, however, attend lectures in philosophy at the university as an auditor but he did not receive grades for the courses.&lt;ref name="teslatimeline" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mrkich|first=D.|title=Nikola Tesla: The European Years|year=2003|publisher=Commoner's Publishing|location=Ottawa|isbn=0-88970-113-X|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NYHOTEL|url=http://www.teslasociety.com/nyhotel.htm|publisher=Tesla Society of NY|accessdate=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===  Working at Budapest Telephone Exchange ===

In 1881, Tesla moved to [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]], to work under [[Tivadar Puskás]] at a [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] company, the Budapest Telephone Exchange. Upon arrival, Tesla realized that the company, then under construction, was not functional, so he worked as a draftsman in the Central Telegraph Office instead. Within a few months, the Budapest Telephone Exchange became functional, and Tesla was allocated the chief electrician position.&lt;ref name="teslatimeline" /&gt; During his employment, Tesla made many improvements to the Central Station equipment and claimed to have perfected a telephone [[repeater]] or [[amplifier]], which was never patented nor publicly described.&lt;ref name="tesla1" /&gt;

== Working at Edison ==

In 1882, Tivadar Puskás got Tesla another job in [[Paris]] with the Continental Edison Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/nikola-tesla-the-genius/ |title=Nikola Tesla: The Genius Who Lit the World |publisher=Top Documentary Films}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tesla began working in what was then a brand new industry, installing indoor incandescent lighting citywide in the form of an electric power [[utility]]. The company had several subdivisions and Tesla worked at the Société Electrique Edison, the division in the [[Ivry-sur-Seine]] suburb of Paris in charge of installing the lighting system. There he gained a great deal of practical experience in electrical engineering. Management took notice of his advanced knowledge in engineering and physics and soon had him designing and building improved versions of generating [[dynamo]]s and motors.{{sfn|Carlson|2013|pp=63–64}} They also sent him on to troubleshoot engineering problems at other Edison utilities being built around France and in Germany.

===A move to the US===
[[File:Edison machine works goerck street new york 1881.png|thumb|Edison Machine Works on Goerck Street, New York. Tesla found the change from cosmopolitan Europe to working at this shop, located amongst the [[tenement]]s on Manhattan's lower east side, a "painful surprise".{{sfn|Carlson|2013|p=70}}]]

In 1884, Edison manager [[Charles Batchelor]], who had been overseeing the Paris installation, was brought back to the US to manage the [[Edison Machine Works]], a manufacturing division situated in [[New York City]], and asked that Tesla be brought to the US as well.{{sfn|Carlson|2013|p=69}} In June 1884, Tesla emigrated to the United States.{{sfn|O'Neill|1944|pp=57–60}} He began working almost immediately at the Machine Works on [[Manhattan]]'s [[Lower East Side]], an overcrowded shop with a workforce of several hundred machinists, laborers, managing staff, and 20 "field engineers" struggling with the task of building the large electric utility in that city.&lt;ref name="edison.rutgers.edu tesla"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edison.rutgers.edu/tesla.htm|title=Edison &amp; Tesla - The Edison Papers|website=edison.rutgers.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; As in Paris, Tesla was working on troubleshooting installations and improving generators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=American inventors, entrepreneurs &amp; business visionaries |last=Carey |first=Charles W. |year=1989 |publisher=Infobase Publishing |isbn=0-8160-4559-3 |page=337 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=XKiGgl36bkgC |accessdate=27 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian W. Bernard Carlson notes Tesla may have met company founder [[Thomas Alva Edison]] only a couple of times.&lt;ref name="edison.rutgers.edu tesla"/&gt; One of those times was noted in Tesla's [[autobiography]] where, after staying up all night repairing the damaged dynamos on the ocean liner [[SS Oregon (1883)|SS ''Oregon'']], he ran into Batchelor and Edison, who made a quip about their "Parisian" being out all night. After Tesla told them he had been up all night fixing the ''Oregon'' Edison commented to Batchelor that "this is a damned good man."{{sfn|Carlson|2013|p=70}} One of the projects given to Tesla was to develop an [[arc lamp]]-based street lighting system.{{sfn|Carlson|2013|pp=71–73}}&lt;ref name="Notebook"&gt;[https://teslauniverse.com/nikola-tesla/books/nikola-tesla-notebook-edison-machine-works-1884-1885 Radmilo Ivanković' Dragan Petrović, review of the reprinted "Nikola Tesla: Notebook from the Edison Machine Works 1884–1885"] {{ISBN|868124311X}}, teslauniverse.com&lt;/ref&gt; Arc lighting was the most popular type of street lighting but it required high voltages and was incompatible with the Edison low-voltage incandescent system, causing the company to lose contracts in cities that wanted street lighting as well. Tesla's designs were never put into production, possibly because of technical improvements in incandescent street lighting or because of an installation deal that Edison cut with an arc lighting company.{{sfn|Carlson|2013|pp=72–73}}

Tesla had been working at the Machine Works for a total of six months when he quit.&lt;ref name="edison.rutgers.edu tesla"/&gt; What event precipitated his leaving is unclear. It may have been over a bonus he did not receive, either for redesigning generators or for the arc lighting system that was shelved.{{sfn|Carlson|2013|pp=71–73}} Tesla had previous run-ins with the Edison company over unpaid bonuses he believed he had earned.{{sfn|Seifer|1996|pp=25, 34}}{{sfn|Carlson|2013|pp=69–73}} In his own biography, Tesla stated the manager of the Edison Machine Works offered a $50,000 bonus to design "twenty-four different types of standard machines" "but it turned out to be a practical joke".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tfcbooks.com/e-books/my_inventions.pdf Nikola Tesla, ''My Inventions: The Autobiography of Nikola Tesla'', originally published: 1919, page 19]&lt;/ref&gt; Later versions of this story have Thomas Edison himself offering and then reneging on the deal, quipping "Tesla, you don't understand our American humor."{{sfn|O'Neill|1944|p=64}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pickover|1999|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The size of the bonus in either story has been noted as odd since Machine Works manager Batchelor was stingy with pay&lt;ref&gt;Tesla's contemporaries remembered that on a previous occasion Machine Works manager Batchelor had been unwilling to give Tesla a $7 a week pay raise (Seifer – ''Wizard: The Life and Times of Nikola Tesla'', page 38)&lt;/ref&gt; and the company did not have that amount of cash (equivalent to $12 million today) on hand.{{sfn|Jonnes|2004|pp=109–10}}{{sfn|Seifer|1996|p=38}} Tesla's diary contains just one comment on what happened at the end of his employment, a note he scrawled across the two pages covering 7 December 1884, to 4 January 1885, saying "Good by to the Edison Machine Works".{{sfn|Carlson|2013|p=73}}&lt;ref name="Notebook"/&gt;

==Tesla Electric Light &amp; Manufacturing==
Soon after leaving the Edison company, Tesla was working on patenting an arc lighting system,{{sfn|Jonnes|2004|pp=110–111}} possibly the same one he had developed at Edison.&lt;ref name="edison.rutgers.edu tesla"/&gt; In March 1885, he met with patent attorney Lemuel W. Serrell, the same attorney used by Edison, to obtain help with submitting the patents.{{sfn|Jonnes|2004|pp=110–111}} Serrell introduced Tesla to two businessmen, Robert Lane and Benjamin Vail, who agreed to finance an arc lighting manufacturing and utility company in Tesla's name, the [[Tesla Electric Light &amp; Manufacturing]].{{sfn|Seifer|1998|p=41}} Tesla worked for the rest of the year obtaining the patents that included an improved DC generator, the first patents issued to Tesla in the US, and building and installing the system in [[Rahway, New Jersey]]{{sfn|Jonnes|2004|p=111}} Tesla's new system gained notice in the technical press, which commented on its advanced features.

The investors showed little interest in Tesla's ideas for new types of [[alternating current]] motors and electrical transmission equipment. After the utility was up and running in 1886, they decided that the manufacturing side of the business was too competitive and opted to simply run an electric utility.{{sfn|Carlson|2013|p=75}} They formed a new utility company, abandoning Tesla's company and leaving the inventor penniless.{{sfn|Carlson|2013|p=75}} Tesla even lost control of the patents he had generated, since he had assigned them to the company in exchange for stock.{{sfn|Carlson|2013|p=75}} He had to work at various electrical repair jobs and as a ditch digger for $2 per day. Later in life Tesla would recount that part of 1886 as a time of hardship, writing "My high education in various branches of science, mechanics and literature seemed to me like a mockery".&lt;ref&gt;Account comes from a letter Tesla sent in 1938 on the occasion of receiving an award from the National Institute of Immigrant Welfare – John Ratzlaff, Tesla Said, Tesla Book Co., p. 280&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Carlson|2013|p=75}}

==AC and the induction motor==
[[File:RMFpatent.PNG|thumb|right|upright|Drawing from {{US patent|381,968}}, illustrating principle of Tesla's alternating current induction motor]]
In late 1886, Tesla met Alfred S. Brown, a [[Western Union]] superintendent, and New York attorney Charles F. Peck. The two men were experienced in setting up companies and promoting inventions and patents for financial gain.{{sfn|Carlson|2013|p=80}} Based on Tesla's new ideas for electrical equipment, including a [[thermo-magnetic motor]] idea,{{sfn|Carlson|2013|pp=76–78}} they agreed to back the inventor financially and handle his patents. Together they formed the Tesla Electric Company in April 1887, with an agreement that profits from generated patents would go 1/3 to Tesla, 1/3 to Peck and Brown, and 1/3 to fund development.{{sfn|Carlson|2013|p=80}} They set up a laboratory for Tesla at 89 Liberty Street in Manhattan, where he worked on improving and developing new types of electric motors, generators, and other devices.

In 1887, Tesla developed an [[induction motor]] that ran on [[alternating current]] (AC), a power system format that was rapidly expanding in Europe and the United States because of its advantages in long-distance, [[high-voltage]] transmission. The motor used [[Polyphase system|polyphase]] current, which generated a [[rotating magnetic field]] to turn the motor (a principle that Tesla claimed to have conceived in 1882).&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite book |title=Networks of Power: Electrification in Western Society, 1880–1930 |publisher=JHU Press |page=117 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g07Q9M4agp4C&amp;pg=PA117}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Parke Hughes, ''Networks of Power: Electrification in Western Society, 1880–1930'', pp. 115–118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1AsFdUxOwu8C&amp;pg=PA204 |title=Robert Bud, Instruments of Science: An Historical Encyclopedia |page=204 |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This innovative electric motor, patented in May 1888, was a simple self-starting design that did not need a [[Commutator (electric)|commutator]], thus avoiding sparking and the high maintenance of constantly servicing and replacing mechanical brushes.{{sfn|Jonnes|2004|p=161}}&lt;ref&gt;Henry G. Prout, ''A Life of George Westinghouse'', p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with getting the motor patented, Peck and Brown arranged to get the motor publicized, starting with independent testing to verify it was a functional improvement, followed by press releases sent to technical publications for articles to run concurrent with the issue of the patent.{{sfn|Carlson|2013|p=105-106}} Physicist [[William Arnold Anthony]] (who tested the motor) and ''Electrical World'' magazine editor [[Thomas Commerford Martin]] arranged for Tesla to demonstrate his AC motor on 16 May 1888 at the American Institute of Electrical Engineers.{{sfn|Carlson|2013|p=105-106}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8j5bJ5OkGpgC&amp;pg=PA36 |author=Fritz E. Froehlich, [[Allen Kent]] |title=The Froehlich/Kent Encyclopedia of Telecommunications: Volume 17, |page=36 |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=10 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Engineers working for the [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation|Westinghouse Electric &amp; Manufacturing Company]] reported to [[George Westinghouse]] that Tesla had a viable AC motor and related power system – something Westinghouse needed for the alternating current system he was already marketing. Westinghouse looked into getting a patent on a similar commutator-less, rotating magnetic field-based induction motor developed in 1885 and presented in a paper in March 1888 by Italian physicist [[Galileo Ferraris]], but decided that Tesla's patent would probably control the market.{{sfn|Jonnes|2004|p=160–162}}{{sfn|Carlson|2013|pp=108–111}}

[[File:US390721.png|thumb|left|upright|Nikola Tesla's AC dynamo-electric machine (AC [[Electric generator]]) in an 1888 {{US patent|390721}}]]
In July 1888, Brown and Peck negotiated a licensing deal with George Westinghouse for Tesla's polyphase induction motor and transformer designs for $60,000 in cash and stock and a royalty of $2.50 per AC horsepower produced by each motor. Westinghouse also hired Tesla for one year for the large fee of $2,000 (${{Inflation|US|2000|1888|r=-2|fmt=c}} in today's dollars{{Inflation-fn|US}}) per month to be a consultant at the Westinghouse Electric &amp; Manufacturing Company's [[Pittsburgh]] labs.{{sfn|Klooster|2009|p=305}}

During that year, Tesla worked in Pittsburgh, helping to create an alternating current system to power the city's streetcars. He found it a frustrating period because of conflicts with the other Westinghouse engineers over how best to implement AC power. Between them, they settled on a 60-cycle AC system that Tesla proposed (to match the working frequency of Tesla's motor), but they soon found that it would not work for streetcars, since Tesla's induction motor could run only at a constant speed. They ended up using a DC [[traction motor]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harris|first=William|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/nikola-tesla2.htm|title=William Harris, How did Nikola Tesla change the way we use energy?|page=3|publisher=Science.howstuffworks.com|date=14 July 2008|accessdate=10 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Munson&gt;{{cite book|title=From Edison to Enron: The Business of Power and What It Means for the Future of Electricity|publisher=Praeger|author=Munson, Richard|year=2005|pages=24–42|location=Westport, CT|isbn=978-0-275-98740-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Market turmoil===
Tesla's demonstration of his induction motor and Westinghouse's subsequent licensing of the patent, both in 1888, came at the time of extreme competition between electric companies.&lt;ref&gt;Quentin R. Skrabec, ''George Westinghouse: Gentle Genius'', Algora Publishing – 2007, pages 119–121&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. Bradley, Jr., ''Edison to Enron: Energy Markets and Political Strategies'', John Wiley &amp; Sons – 2011, pages 55–58&lt;/ref&gt; The three big firms, Westinghouse, Edison, and [[Thomson-Houston Electric Company|Thomson-Houston]], were trying to grow in a capital-intensive business while financially undercutting each other. There was even a "[[War of Currents]]" propaganda campaign going on with Edison Electric trying to claim their [[direct current]] system was better and safer than the Westinghouse alternating current system.&lt;ref&gt;Quentin R. Skrabec, George Westinghouse: Gentle Genius, Algora Publishing – 2007, pages 118–120&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Seifer|1998|p=47}} Competing in this market meant Westinghouse would not have the cash or engineering resources to develop Tesla's motor and the related polyphase system right away.&lt;ref name="gentlegenius"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Skrabec|first1=Quentin R.|title=George Westinghouse : gentle genius|date=2007|publisher=Algora Pub.|location=New York|isbn=0-87586-506-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years after signing the Tesla contract, Westinghouse Electric was in trouble. The near collapse of [[Barings Bank]] in London triggered the [[Panic of 1890|financial panic of 1890]], causing investors to call in their loans to W.E.{{sfn|Carlson|2013|p=130}} The sudden cash shortage forced the company to refinance its debts. The new lenders demanded that Westinghouse cut back on what looked like excessive spending on acquisition of other companies, research, and patents, including the per motor royalty in the Tesla contract.{{sfn|Carlson|2013|p=131}}{{sfn|Jonnes|2004|p=29}} At that point, the Tesla induction motor had been unsuccessful and was stuck in development.{{sfn|Carlson|2013|p=130}}&lt;ref name="gentlegenius"/&gt; Westinghouse was paying a $15,000-a-year guaranteed royalty&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Parke Hughes, ''Networks of Power: Electrification in Western Society, 1880–1930'' (1983), p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; even though operating examples of the motor were rare and polyphase power systems needed to run it were even rarer.{{sfn|Carlson|2013|p=130}}{{sfn|Jonnes|2004|p=161}} In early 1891, George Westinghouse explained his financial difficulties to Tesla in stark terms, saying that, if he did not meet the demands of his lenders, he would no longer be in control of Westinghouse Electric and Tesla would have to "deal with the bankers" to try to collect future royalties.{{sfn|Jonnes|2004|p=228}} The advantages of having Westinghouse continue to champion the motor probably seemed obvious to Tesla and he agreed to release the company from the royalty payment clause in the contract.{{sfn|Jonnes|2004|p=228}}{{sfn|Carlson|2013|pp=130–131}} Six years later Westinghouse would purchase Tesla's patent for a [[lump sum]] payment of $216,000 as part of a patent-sharing agreement signed with [[General Electric]] (a company created from the 1892 merger of Edison and Thomson-Houston).{{sfn|Cheney|2001|pp=48–49}}&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Cooper, ''The Truth About Tesla: The Myth of the Lone Genius in the History of Innovation'', Race Point Publishing – 2015, page 109&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Electricity, a Popular Electrical Journal, Volume 13, No. 4, 4 August 1897, Electricity Newspaper Company −1898, page 50 [https://books.google.com/books?id=nNA9AQAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=PA50&amp;ots=qUFv9wjuIk&amp;dq=tesla%20patent%201897%20%22patent%20pool%22&amp;pg=PA50#v=onepage&amp;q=tesla%20patent%201897%20%22patent%20pool%22&amp;f=false Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

The money Tesla made from licensing his AC patents made him independently wealthy and gave him the time and funds to pursue his own interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://teslauniverse.com/nikola-tesla/articles/nikola-tesla-scientific-savant|title=Nikola Tesla: Scientific Savant from the Tesla Universe Article Collection|date=23 December 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1889, Tesla moved out of the Liberty Street shop Peck and Brown had rented and for the next dozen years would work out of a series of workshop/laboratory spaces in [[Manhattan]]. These included a lab at 175 Grand Street (1889–1892), the fourth floor of 33–35 South [[Fifth Avenue (Manhattan)|Fifth Avenue]] (1892–1895), and sixth and seventh floors of 46 &amp; 48 East [[Houston Street (Manhattan)|Houston Street]] (1895–1902).&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, W.

===Tesla coil===
{{Main|Tesla coil}}

In the summer of 1889, Tesla traveled to the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|1889 Exposition Universelle]] in Paris and learned of [[Heinrich Hertz]]' 1886–88 experiments that proved the existence of [[electromagnetic radiation]], including [[radio wave]]s.{{sfn|Carlson|2013|p=120}} Tesla found this new discovery "refreshing" and decided to explore it more fully. In repeating, and then expanding on, these experiments, Tesla tried powering a [[Ruhmkorff coil]] with a high speed [[alternator]] he had been developing as part of an improved [[Arc lamp|arc lighting]] system but found that the high frequency current overheated the iron core and melted the insulation between the primary and secondary windings in the coil. To fix this problem Tesla came up with his [[Tesla coil]] with an air gap instead of insulating material between the primary and secondary windings and an iron core that could be moved to different positions in or out of the coil.{{sfn|Carlson|2013|p=122}}

===Steam-powered oscillating generator===
{{Main|Tesla's oscillator}}

Trying to come up with a better way to generate alternating current, Tesla developed a [[Tesla's oscillator|steam powered reciprocating electricity generator]]. He patented it in 1893 and introduced it at the Chicago World's Columbian Exposition that year. Steam would be forced into the oscillator and rush out through a series of ports, pushing a piston up and down that was attached to an armature. The magnetic armature vibrated up and down at high speed, producing an alternating [[magnetic field]]. This [[electromagnetic induction|induced]] alternating electric current in the wire coils located adjacent. It did away with the complicated parts of a steam engine/generator, but never caught on as a feasible engineering solution to generate electricity.{{sfn|Carlson|2013|pp=181–185}}&lt;ref&gt;Reciprocating Engine, {{US patent|514169}}, 6 February 1894.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:TeslaPOLYPHASEColumbianEXPO1893rwLIPACKownerA.pdf|thumbnail|A Westinghouse display of the "Tesla Polyphase System" at Chicago's 1893 Columbian Exposition]]
At the beginning of 1893, Westinghouse engineer [[Benjamin Lamme]] had made great progress developing an efficient version of Tesla's induction motor, and Westinghouse Electric started branding their complete [[Polyphase system|polyphase]] AC system as the "Tesla Polyphase System". They believed that Tesla's patents gave them [[Priority right|patent priority]] over other AC systems.{{sfn|Carlson|2013|p=167}}

Westinghouse Electric asked Tesla to participate in the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago where the company had a large space in a building devoted to electrical exhibits. Westinghouse Electric won the bid to light the Exposition with alternating current and it was a key event in the history of AC power, as the company demonstrated to the American public the safety, reliability, and efficiency of a fully integrated alternating current system.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Moran, Executioner's Current: Thomas Edison, George Westinghouse, and the Invention of the Electric Chair, Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group – 2007, page 222&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''America at the Fair: Chicago's 1893 World's Columbian Exposition'' (Google eBook) Chaim M.

Neumeister|last-author-amp=yes|pages=xxi|publisher=Books.google.com|accessdate=10 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tesla showed a series of electrical effects related to alternating current as well as his wireless lighting system, using a demonstration he had previously performed throughout America and Europe;{{sfn|Cheney|2001|p=76}} these included using high-voltage, high-frequency alternating current to light a wireless [[gas-discharge lamp]].{{sfn|Cheney|2001|p=79}}

An observer noted:

{{quote|Within the room were suspended two hard-rubber plates covered with tin foil. These were about fifteen feet apart, and served as terminals of the wires leading from the transformers. When the current was turned on, the lamps or tubes, which had no wires connected to them, but lay on a table between the suspended plates, or which might be held in the hand in almost any part of the room, were made luminous. These were the same experiments and the same apparatus shown by Tesla in London about two years previous, "where they produced so much wonder and astonishment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Electricity at the Columbian Exposition; Including an Account of the Exhibits in the Electricity Building, the Power Plant in Machinery Hall |last=Barrett |first=John Patrick |year=1894 |isbn= |pages=268–269 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=CLtIAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=29 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Tesla also explained the principles of the rotating magnetic field in an induction motor by demonstrating how to make a copper egg stand on end, using a device that he constructed known as the ''[[Tesla's Egg of Columbus|Egg of Columbus]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tesla's Egg of Columbus How Tesla Performed the Feat of Columbus Without Cracking the Egg|url=https://teslauniverse.com/nikola-tesla-article-teslas-egg-of-columbus|publisher=Tesla Universe|accessdate=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and introduced his new steam powered oscillator AC generator.

===Consulting on Niagara===

In 1893, [[Edward Dean Adams]], who headed up the [[Niagara Falls]] [[Cataract Construction Company]], sought Tesla's opinion on what system would be best to transmit power generated at the falls. Over several years, there had been a series of proposals and open competitions on how best to use power generated by the falls. Among the systems proposed by several US and European companies were two-phase and three-phase AC, high-voltage DC, and compressed air. Adams pumped Tesla for information about the current state of all the competing systems. Tesla advised Adams that a two-phased system would be the most reliable, and that there was a Westinghouse system to light incandescent bulbs using two-phase alternating current. The company awarded a contract to Westinghouse Electric for building a two-phase AC generating system at the Niagara Falls, based on Tesla's advice and Westinghouse's demonstration at the Columbian Exposition that they could build a complete AC system. At the same time, a further contract was awarded to General Electric to build the AC distribution system.{{sfn|Carlson|2013|pp=167–73}}

===The Nikola Tesla Company===
In 1895, Edward Dean Adams, impressed with what he saw when he toured Tesla's lab, agreed to help found the Nikola Tesla Company, set up to fund, develop, and market a variety of previous Tesla patents and inventions as well as new ones. Alfred Brown signed on, bringing along patents developed under Peck and Brown. The board was filled out with William Birch Rankine and Charles F. Coaney.{{sfn|Carlson|2013|pp=205–206}} It found few investors; the mid-1890s was a tough time financially, and the wireless lighting and oscillators patents it was set up to market never panned out. The company would handle Tesla's patents for decades to come.

===Lab fire===

In the early morning hours of 13 March 1895, the South Fifth Avenue building that housed Tesla's lab caught fire. It started in the basement of the building and was so intense Tesla's 4th floor lab burned and collapsed into the second floor. The fire not only set back Tesla's ongoing projects, it destroyed a collection of early notes and research material, models, and demonstration pieces, including many that had been exhibited at the 1893 Worlds Colombian Exposition. Tesla told ''[[The New York Times]]'' "I am in too much grief to talk. What can I say?"&lt;ref name="teslatimeline"/&gt; After the fire Tesla moved to 46 &amp; 48 East Houston Street and rebuilt his lab on the 6th and 7th floors.

=== X-ray experimentation ===
[[File:Рэнтгенаўскі здымак рукі Тэслы.jpeg|thumb|left|upright|X-ray of a hand, taken by Tesla]]

Starting in 1894, Tesla began investigating what he referred to as radiant energy of "invisible" kinds after he had noticed damaged film in his laboratory in previous experiments&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tesla|first1=Nikola|title=X-ray vision: Nikola Tesla on Roentgen rays|date=2007|publisher=Wiilder Publications|location=Radford, VA|isbn=978-1-934451-92-2|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; (later identified as "''Roentgen rays''" or "[[X-Rays]]"). His early experiments were with [[Crookes tube]]s, a [[cold cathode]] electrical discharge tube. Tesla may have inadvertently captured an X-ray image—predating, by a few weeks, [[Wilhelm Röntgen]]'s December 1895 announcement of the discovery of X-rays when he tried to photograph Mark Twain illuminated by a [[Geissler tube]], an earlier type of gas discharge tube. The only thing captured in the image was the metal locking screw on the camera lens.{{sfn|Cheney|2001|p=134}}

In March 1896, after hearing of [[Wilhelm Röntgen]]'s discovery of X-ray and X-ray imaging ([[radiography]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=South|first=Nanette|url=http://anengineersaspect.blogspot.com/2011/07/nikola-tesla-radiography-experiments.html|title=Nikola Tesla&amp;nbsp;– Radiography Experiments&amp;nbsp;– Clips from "The Constitution, Atlanta, Georgia, pg. 9. Friday, 13 March 1896"|publisher=Anengineersaspect.blogspot.com|date=23 July 2011|accessdate=10 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tesla proceeded to do his own experiments in X-ray imaging, developing a high energy single terminal [[vacuum tube]] of his own design that had no target electrode and that worked from the output of the Tesla Coil (the modern term for the phenomenon produced by this device is ''[[bremsstrahlung]]'' or ''braking radiation''). In his research, Tesla devised several experimental setups to produce X-rays. Tesla held that, with his circuits, the "instrument will&amp;nbsp;... enable one to generate Roentgen rays of much greater power than obtainable with ordinary apparatus."&lt;ref&gt;N. Tesla, [http://www.tfcbooks.com/tesla/1898-11-17.htm "High Frequency Oscillators for Electro-Therapeutic and Other Purposes"], in ''Proceedings of the American Electro-Therapeutic Association'', American Electro-Therapeutic Association. p.&amp;nbsp;25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tesla noted the hazards of working with his circuit and single-node X-ray-producing devices. In his many notes on the early investigation of this phenomenon, he attributed the skin damage to various causes. He believed early on that damage to the skin was not caused by the Roentgen rays, but by the [[ozone]] generated in contact with the skin, and to a lesser extent, by [[nitrous acid]]. Tesla incorrectly believed that X-rays were longitudinal waves, such as those produced in [[waves in plasmas]]. These plasma waves can occur in [[force-free magnetic field]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, David J. ''Introduction to Electrodynamics'', {{ISBN|0-13-805326-X}} and Jackson, John D.

On 11 July 1934, the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' published an article on Tesla, in which he recalled an event that would occasionally take place while experimenting with his single-electrode vacuum tubes; a minute particle would break off the cathode, pass out of the tube, and physically strike him:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Tesla said he could feel a sharp stinging pain where it entered his body, and again at the place where it passed out. In comparing these particles with the bits of metal projected by his "electric gun," Tesla said, "The particles in the beam of force&amp;nbsp;... will travel much faster than such particles&amp;nbsp;... and they will travel in concentrations."&lt;ref name=Anderson&gt;{{cite book |last=Anderson |first=Leland, |title=Nikola Tesla's teleforce &amp; telegeodynamics proposals |year=1998 |publisher=21st Century Books |location=Breckenridge, Colo. |isbn=0-9636012-8-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Radio remote control===

In 1898, Tesla demonstrated a boat that used a [[coherer]]-based [[radio control]]—which he dubbed "telautomaton"—to the public during an electrical exhibition at [[Madison Square Garden (1890)|Madison Square Garden]].{{sfn|Jonnes|2004}} The crowd that witnessed the demonstration made outrageous claims about the workings of the boat, such as magic, telepathy, and being piloted by a trained monkey hidden inside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://suite.io/christopher-eger/6vk27m | last =Eger| first= Christopher | date= n.d. | title=The Robot Boat of Nikola Tesla | publisher= Self-published| accessdate=22 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150622232342/https://suite.io/christopher-eger/6vk27m |archivedate=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tesla tried to sell his idea to the U.S. military as a type of radio-controlled [[torpedo]], but they showed little interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6aStP3Du5cgC&amp;pg=PT50&amp;lpg=PT50 |first=P.

==Wireless power==
{{See|Wireless power transfer#Tesla}}

[[File:Teslathinker.jpg|thumb|Tesla sitting in front of a spiral coil used in his wireless power experiments at his East Houston St. laboratory]]

From the 1890s through 1906, Tesla spent a great deal of his time and fortune on a series of projects trying to develop [[Wireless power transfer|the transmission of electrical power without wires]]. It was an expansion of his idea of using coils to transmit power that he had been demonstrating in wireless lighting. He saw this as not only a way to transmit large amounts of power around the world but also, as he had pointed out in his earlier lectures, a way to transmit worldwide communications.

At the time Tesla was formulating his ideas, there was no feasible way to wirelessly transmit communication signals over long distances, let alone large amounts of power. Tesla had studied radio waves early on, and came to the conclusion that part of existing study on them, by Hertz, was incorrect.{{sfn|Carlson|2013|p=127}}&lt;ref name="earlyradiohistory.us"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://earlyradiohistory.us/tesla.htm|title=Nikola Tesla: The Guy Who DIDN'T "Invent Radio"|website=earlyradiohistory.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tesla's own experiments led him to erroneously believe Hertz had miss identified a form of conduction instead of a new form of electromagnetic radiation, an incorrect assumption that Tesla would hold on to for a couple of decades.(Carlson, pp-127-128)(White, Nikola Tesla: The Guy Who DIDN'T "Invent Radio")&lt;/ref&gt; Also, this new form of radiation was widely considered at the time to be a short-distance phenomenon that seemed to die out in less than a mile.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Regal, Radio: The Life Story of a Technology, page 22&lt;/ref&gt; Tesla noted that, even if theories on radio waves were true, they were totally worthless for his intended purposes since this form of "invisible light" would diminish over distance just like any other radiation and would travel in straight lines right out into space, becoming "hopelessly lost".{{sfn|Carlson|2013|p=209}}

By the mid 1890s, Tesla was working on the idea that he might be able to conduct electricity long distance through the Earth or the atmosphere, and began working on experiments to test this idea including setting up a large resonance transformer [[magnifying transmitter]] in his East Houston Street lab.&lt;ref name="My Inventions"&gt;&lt;u&gt;My Inventions: The Autobiography of Nikola Tesla&lt;/u&gt;, Hart Brothers, 1982, Ch. 5, {{ISBN|0-910077-00-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Tesla on Electricity Without Wires," &lt;u&gt;Electrical Engineer&lt;/u&gt; – N.

To further study the conductive nature of low pressure air, Tesla set up an [[Tesla Experimental Station|experimental station]] at high altitude in Colorado Springs during 1899.{{sfn|Uth|1999|p=92}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/tesla/ll/ll_colspr.html|title=PBS: Tesla - Master of Lightning: Colorado Springs|website=www.pbs.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Carlson|2013|p=264}}&lt;ref name="Wireless Telegraphy 2002, p. 109"&gt;''Nikola Tesla On His Work With Alternating Currents and Their Application to Wireless Telegraphy, Telephony, and Transmission of Power'', Leland I.

During his time at his laboratory, Tesla observed unusual signals from his receiver which he speculated to be communications from another planet. He mentioned them in a letter to a reporter in December 1899&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Blair Stewart (1999). ''Tesla: The Modern Sorcerer'', Frog Book. p. 372&lt;/ref&gt; and to the [[Red Cross Society]] in December 1900.{{sfn|Carlson|2013|p=315}}{{sfn|Seifer|1998|pp=220–223}} Reporters treated it as a sensational story and jumped to the conclusion Tesla was hearing signals from [[Mars]].{{sfn|Carlson|2013|p=315}} He expanded on the signals he heard in a 9 February 1901 ''Collier's Weekly'' article "Talking With Planets" where he said it had not been immediately apparent to him that he was hearing "intelligently controlled signals" and that the signals could come from Mars, [[Venus]], or other planets.{{sfn|Seifer|1998|pp=220–223}} It has been hypothesized that he may have intercepted [[Guglielmo Marconi]]'s European experiments in July 1899—Marconi may have transmitted the letter S (dot/dot/dot) in a naval demonstration, the same three impulses that Tesla hinted at hearing in Colorado{{sfn|Seifer|1998|pp=220–223}}—or signals from another experimenter in wireless transmission.&lt;ref name="seifer2006"&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=July 2014}}{{cite web |last=Seifer |first=Marc |title=Nikola Tesla: The Lost Wizard |url=http://teslatech.info/ttmagazine/v4n1/seifer.htm |publisher=ExtraOrdinary Technology (Volume 4, Issue 1; Jan/Feb/March 2006) |accessdate=14 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tesla had an agreement with the editor of ''[[The Century Magazine]]'' to produce an article on his findings. The magazine sent a photographer to Colorado to photograph the work being done there. The article, titled "The Problem of Increasing Human Energy", appeared in the June 1900 edition of the magazine. He explained the superiority of the wireless system he envisioned but the article was more of a lengthy philosophical treatise than an understandable scientific description of his work,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teslamemorialsociety.org/info/Research%20of%20Nikola%20Tesla%20in%20Long%20Island%20Laboratory.htm|title=Aleksandar Marinčić, Ph.D, Research of Nikola Tesla in Long Island Laboratory, teslamemorialsociety.org|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; illustrated with what were to become iconic images of Tesla and his Colorado Springs experiments.

===Wardenclyffe===
{{Main|Wardenclyffe Tower}}
[[File:Tesla Broadcast Tower 1904.jpeg|thumb|upright|Tesla's Wardenclyffe plant on Long Island in 1904. From this facility, Tesla hoped to demonstrate wireless transmission of electrical energy across the Atlantic.]]

Tesla made the rounds in New York trying to find investors for what he thought would be a viable system of wireless transmission, wining and dining them at the [[Waldorf-Astoria]]'s Palm Garden (the hotel where he was living at the time), [[The Players (New York City)|The Players Club]], and [[Delmonico's]].&lt;ref name="teslascience.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teslascience.org/pages/dream.htm|title=Tesla Wardenclyffe Project Update &amp;ndash; An Introduction to the Issues|website=www.teslascience.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1901, he obtained $150,000 (${{Inflation|US|150000|1900|r=-2|fmt=c}} in today's dollars{{Inflation-fn|US}}) from [[J. Pierpont Morgan]] in return for a 51% share of any generated wireless patents, and began planning the [[Wardenclyffe Tower]] facility to be built in [[Shoreham, New York]], {{convert|100|mi|km|0}} east of the city on the North Shore of Long Island.&lt;ref name="broad1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Broad |first=William J |title=A Battle to Preserve a Visionary's Bold Failure |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/05/science/05tesla.html |accessdate=20 May 2013 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=4 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By July 1901, Tesla had expanded his plans to build a more powerful transmitter to leap ahead of Marconi's radio based system, which Tesla thought was a copy of his own system.{{sfn|Carlson|2013|p=315}} He approached Morgan to ask for more money to build the larger system but Morgan refused to supply any further funds.&lt;ref name="teslatech.info"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://teslatech.info/ttmagazine/v4n1/seifer.htm|title=ExtraOrdinary Technology  -  Vol 4 No 1 -  Nikola Tesla: The Lost Wizard|website=teslatech.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1901, Marconi successfully transmitted the letter S from England to [[Newfoundland and Labrador#colony|Newfoundland]], defeating Tesla in the race to be first to complete such a transmission. A month after Marconi's success, Tesla tried to get Morgan to back an even larger plan to transmit messages and power by controlling "vibrations throughout the globe".{{sfn|Carlson|2013|p=315}} Over the next five years, Tesla wrote more than 50 letters to Morgan, pleading for and demanding additional funding to complete the construction of Wardenclyffe. Tesla continued the project for another nine months into 1902. The tower was erected to its full {{convert|187|ft|m|0}}.&lt;ref name="seifer2006" /&gt; In June 1902, Tesla moved his lab operations from Houston Street to Wardenclyffe.&lt;ref name="broad1" /&gt;

Investors on Wall Street were putting their money into Marconi's system, and some in the press began turning against Tesla's project, claiming it was a hoax.&lt;ref&gt;Malanowski, Gregory, &lt;u&gt;The Race for Wireless&lt;/u&gt;, AuthorHouse, page 35&lt;/ref&gt; The project came to a halt in 1905, and in 1906, the financial problems and other events may have led to what Tesla biographer [[Marc J. Seifer]] suspects was a nervous breakdown on Tesla's part.&lt;ref&gt;David Hatcher Childress, The Fantastic Inventions of Nikola Tesla, page 255&lt;/ref&gt; Tesla mortgaged the Wardenclyffe property to cover his debts at the [[Waldorf-Astoria]], which eventually mounted to $20,000 (${{Inflation|US|20000|1914|r=-2|fmt=c}} in today's dollars{{Inflation-fn|US}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KRg9HWakBmQC&amp;pg=PA185&amp;lpg=PA185&amp;dq=tesla+1908+Wardenclyffe+foreclosed&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0ThH1BbZAu&amp;sig=HkWRPUcJ0uVoGbfZthBcxVuI4j0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CqDWU7jhJ4uWyASPl4LICQ&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=tesla+1908+Wardenclyffe+foreclosed&amp;f=false|title=Nikola Tesla on His Work with Alternating Currents and Their Application to Wireless Telegraphy, Telephony, and Transmission of Power: An Extended Interview|first=Nikola|last=Tesla|date=8 December 2017|publisher=21st Century Books|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lost the property in foreclosure in 1915, and in 1917 the Tower was demolished by the new owner to make the land a more viable real estate asset.

==Later years==

After Wardencyiffe closed, Tesla continued to write to Morgan; after "the great man" died, Tesla wrote to Morgan's son Jack, trying to get further funding for the project. In 1906, Tesla opened offices at 165 Broadway in Manhattan, trying to raise further funds by developing and marketing his patents. He went on to have offices at the [[Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower|Metropolitan Life Tower]] from 1910 to 1914; rented for a few months at the [[Woolworth Building]], moving out because he could not afford the rent; and then to office space at 8 West 40th Street from 1915 to 1925. After moving to 8 West 40th Street, he was effectively bankrupt. Most of his patents had run out and he was having trouble with the new inventions he was trying to develop.{{sfn|Carlson|2013|p=373–375}}

===Bladeless turbine===
[[File:TeslaTurbineOriginal.png|thumb|Tesla's bladeless turbine design]]

On his 50th birthday, in 1906, Tesla demonstrated a {{convert|200|hp|kW|abbr=off}} 16,000&amp;nbsp;rpm [[Tesla turbine|bladeless turbine]]. During 1910–1911 at the ''Waterside Power Station'' in New York, several of his bladeless turbine engines were tested at 100–5,000&amp;nbsp;hp.{{sfn|Carlson|2013|p=371}} Tesla worked with several companies including the period 1919–1922 working in [[Milwaukee]] for [[Allis-Chalmers]].{{sfn|Seifer|2001|p=398}}{{sfn|Carlson|2013|p=373}} He spent most of his time trying to perfect the Tesla turbine with Hans Dahlstrand, the head engineer at the company, but engineering difficulties meant it was never made into a practical device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rastko.rs/istorija/tesla/oniell-tesla.html|title=[Projekat Rastko] John J. O'Neill: Prodigal Genius - The Life of Nikola Tesla (1944)|website=www.rastko.rs}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tesla did license the idea to a precision instrument company and it found use in the form of luxury car [[speedometer]]s and other instruments.{{sfn|Cheney|Uth|Glenn|1999|p=115}}

===Wireless lawsuits===

When [[World War I]] broke out, the British cut the transatlantic telegraph cable linking the US to [[Germany]] in order to control the flow of information between the two countries. They also tried to shut off German wireless communication to and from the US by having the US Marconi Company sue the German radio company [[Telefunken]] for patent infringement.{{sfn|Carlson|2013|p=377}} Telefunken brought in the physicists [[Jonathan Zenneck]] and [[Karl Ferdinand Braun]] for their defense, and hired Tesla as a witness for two years for $1,000 a month. The case stalled and then went moot when the US entered the war against Germany in 1917.{{sfn|Carlson|2013|p=377}}{{sfn|Seifer|2001|p=373}}

In 1915, Tesla attempted to sue the [[Marconi Company]] for infringement of his wireless tuning patents. Marconi's initial radio patent had been awarded in the US in 1897, but his 1900 patent submission covering improvements to radio transmission had been rejected several times, before it was finally approved in 1904, on the grounds that it infringed on other existing patents including two 1897 Tesla wireless power tuning patents.&lt;ref&gt;Howard B. Rockman, Intellectual Property Law for Engineers and Scientists, John Wiley &amp; Sons – 2004, page 198&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="earlyradiohistory.us"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/320/1/case.html|title=Marconi Wireless Tel.

===Nobel Prize rumors===

On 6 November 1915, a [[Reuters]] news agency report from London had the 1915 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] awarded to Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla; however, on 15 November, a Reuters story from Stockholm stated the prize that year was being awarded to [[Sir William Henry Bragg]] and [[William Lawrence Bragg]] "for their services in the analysis of crystal structure by means of X-rays."{{sfn|Cheney|2001|p=245}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1915 |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1915/ |publisher=nobelprize.org |accessdate=29 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cheney|Uth|Glenn|1999|p=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were unsubstantiated rumors at the time that either Tesla or Edison had refused the prize.{{sfn|Cheney|2001|p=245}} The Nobel Foundation said, "Any rumor that a person has not been given a Nobel Prize because he has made known his intention to refuse the reward is ridiculous"; a recipient could decline a Nobel Prize only after he is announced a winner.{{sfn|Cheney|2001|p=245}}

There have been subsequent claims by Tesla biographers that Edison and Tesla were the original recipients and that neither was given the award because of their animosity toward each other; that each sought to minimize the other's achievements and right to win the award; that both refused ever to accept the award if the other received it first; that both rejected any possibility of sharing it; and even that a wealthy Edison refused it to keep Tesla from getting the $20,000 prize money.{{sfn|Cheney|2001|p=245}}{{sfn|Seifer|2001|p=7}}

In the years after these rumors, neither Tesla nor Edison won the prize (although Edison did receive one of 38 possible bids in 1915 and Tesla did receive one of 38 possible bids in 1937).{{sfn|Seifer|2001|pp=378–380}}

[[File:Second banquet meeting of the Institute of Radio Engineers.jpg|thumb|left|Second banquet meeting of the Institute of Radio Engineers, 23 April 1915. Tesla seen standing in the center.]]

Tesla attempted to market several devices based on the production of [[ozone]]. These included his 1900 Tesla Ozone Company selling an 1896 patented device based on his Tesla Coil, used to bubble ozone through different types of oils to make a therapeutic gel.&lt;ref&gt;Anand Kumar Sethi, The European Edisons: Volta, Tesla, and Tigerstedt, Springer - 2016, pages 53-54&lt;/ref&gt; He also tried to develop a variation of this a few years later as a room sanitizer for hospitals.{{sfn|Carlson|2013|p=353}}

Tesla theorized that the application of electricity to the brain enhanced intelligence. In 1912, he crafted "a plan to make dull students bright by saturating them unconsciously with electricity," wiring the walls of a schoolroom and, "saturating [the schoolroom] with infinitesimal electric waves vibrating at high frequency. The whole room will thus, Mr. Tesla claims, be converted into a health-giving and stimulating electromagnetic field or 'bath.'"&lt;ref name="Gilliams"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gilliams |first1=E. Leslie |title=Tesla's Plan of Electrically Treating Schoolchildren |url=http://www.teslacollection.com/tesla_articles/1912/popular_electricity_magazine/e_leslie_gilliams/tesla_s_plan_of_electrically_treating_school_children |website=teslacollection.com/ |publisher=Popular Electricity Magazine (1912) |accessdate=19 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan was, at least provisionally, approved by then superintendent of New York City schools, William H. Maxwell.&lt;ref name="Gilliams" /&gt;

Before [[World War I]], Tesla sought overseas investors. After the war started, Tesla lost the funding he was receiving from his patents in European countries.

In the August 1917 edition of the magazine ''[[Electrical Experimenter]]'', Tesla postulated that electricity could be used to locate submarines via using the reflection of an "electric ray" of "tremendous frequency," with the signal being viewed on a fluorescent screen (a system that has been noted to have a superficial resemblance to modern [[radar]]).&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Cheney, Robert Uth, Jim Glenn, ''Tesla, Master of Lightning,'' pp. 128–129&lt;/ref&gt; Tesla was incorrect in his assumption that high frequency radio waves would penetrate water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W1JAeg1PiWIC&amp;pg=PA154|title=Lewis Coe (2006). ''Wireless Radio: A History''. McFarland. p. 154|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Émile Girardeau]], who helped develop France's first radar system in the 1930s, noted in 1953 that Tesla's general speculation that a very strong high-frequency signal would be needed was correct. Girardeau said, "(Tesla) was prophesying or dreaming, since he had at his disposal no means of carrying them out, but one must add that if he was dreaming, at least he was dreaming correctly."{{sfn|Cheney|2001|p=266}}

In 1928, Tesla received {{US patent|1,655,114}}, for a [[biplane]] capable of taking off vertically ([[vertical take-off and landing|VTOL]] aircraft) and then of being "''gradually tilted through manipulation of the elevator devices''" in flight until it was flying like a conventional plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Tesla |first=Nikola |title=TESLA PATENT 1,655,114 APPARATUS FOR AERIAL TRANSPORTATION. |url=https://teslauniverse.com/nikola-tesla-patents-1,655,114-aerial-transportation |publisher=U.S. Patent Office|accessdate=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tesla thought the plane would sell for less than $1,000,{{sfn|Cheney|2001|p=251}} although the aircraft has been described as impractical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.airspacemag.com/history-of-flight/OldandOdd-AS06.html |title=A.J.S. RAYL Air &amp; Space magazine, September 2006, reprint at History of Flight |publisher=airspacemag.com |accessdate=10 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would be his last patent and at this time Tesla closed his last office at 350 Madison Ave., which he had moved into two years earlier.

===Living circumstances ===

Since 1900, Tesla had been living at the Waldorf Astoria in New York running up a large bill.{{sfn|Cheney|Uth|Glenn|1999|p=125}} In 1922, he moved to [[St. Regis New York|St. Regis Hotel]] and would follow a pattern from then on of moving to a new hotel every few years leaving behind unpaid bills.{{sfn|Carlson|2013|p=467-468}}&lt;ref name=ONeill359&gt;O'Neill (1944), p. 359&lt;/ref&gt;

Tesla would walk to the park every day to feed the pigeons. He took to feeding them at the window of his hotel room and bringing the injured ones in to nurse back to health.&lt;ref name=ONeill359/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Nikola Tesla |url=http://www.teslasociety.org/about.html |publisher=Tesla Memorial Society of NY |accessdate=5 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525133151/http://www.teslasociety.org/about.html |archivedate=25 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tesla Life and Legacy&amp;nbsp;– Poet and Visionary |url=https://www.pbs.org/tesla/ll/ll_poevis.html |publisher=PBS |accessdate=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that he had been visited by a specific injured white pigeon daily. Tesla spent over $2,000, including building a device that comfortably supported her so her bones could heal, to fix her broken wing and leg.{{sfn|Seifer|2001}} Tesla stated:

{{quote|I have been feeding pigeons, thousands of them for years. But there was one, a beautiful bird, pure white with light grey tips on its wings; that one was different. It was a female. I had only to wish and call her and she would come flying to me. I loved that pigeon as a man loves a woman, and she loved me. As long as I had her, there was a purpose to my life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Nikola Tesla |url=http://www.teslasociety.org/about.html |publisher=Tesla Society of USA and Canada |accessdate=5 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525133151/http://www.teslasociety.org/about.html |archivedate=25 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Tesla's unpaid bills, and complaints about the mess from his pigeon-feeding, forced him to leave the St. Regis in 1923, the [[Hotel Pennsylvania]] in 1930, and the [[Hotel Governor Clinton]] in 1934.&lt;ref name=ONeill359/&gt; At one point, he also took rooms at the [[Hotel Marguery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://teslauniverse.com/nikola-tesla/timeline/1917-teslas-wardenclyffe-tower-destroyed#goto-310|title=1917|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, Tesla moved to the [[Hotel New Yorker]], and Westinghouse Electric &amp; Manufacturing Company began paying him $125 per month as well as paying his rent, expenses the Company would pay for the rest of Tesla's life. Accounts of how this came about vary. Several sources say Westinghouse was worried (or warned) about potential bad publicity surrounding the impoverished conditions under which their former star inventor was living.{{sfn|Jonnes|2004|p=365}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cheney|Uth|Glenn|1999|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Seifer435"&gt;{{harvnb|Seifer|2001|p=435}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Carlson|2013|p=379}} The payment has been described as being couched as a "consulting fee" to get around Tesla's aversion to accept charity, or by one biographer (Marc Seifer) as a type of unspecified settlement.&lt;ref name="Seifer435"/&gt;

In 1931, Kenneth Swezey, a young writer who had been associated with Tesla for some time, organized a celebration for the inventor's 75th birthday. Tesla received congratulatory letters from more than 70 pioneers in science and engineering, including [[Albert Einstein]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teslasociety.com/time.jpg|title=Time front cover, Vol XVIII, No. 3|date=20 July 1931|accessdate=10 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he was also featured on the cover of [[Time magazine|''Time'' magazine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nikola Tesla {{!}} 20 July 1931|url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19310720,00.html|work=Time|accessdate=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cover caption "All the world's his power house" noted his contribution to [[Electricity generation|electrical power generation]]. The party went so well that Tesla made it an annual event, an occasion where he would put out a large spread of food and drink (featuring dishes of his own creation) and invite the press to see his inventions and hear stories about past exploits, views on current events, or sometimes odd or baffling claims.{{sfn|Cheney|2001|p=151}}{{sfn|Carlson|2013|pp=380–382}}

[[File:Teslathoughtcamera.jpeg|thumb|Newspaper representation of the thought camera Tesla described at his 1933 birthday party]]
At the 1932 occasion, Tesla claimed he had invented a motor that would run on [[cosmic ray]]s.{{sfn|Carlson|2013|pp=380–382}} In 1933, at age 77, Tesla told reporters that, after thirty-five years of work, he was on the verge of producing proof of a new form of energy. He claimed it was a theory of energy that was "violently opposed" to Einsteinian physics, and could be tapped with an apparatus that would be cheap to run and last 500 years. He also told reporters he was working on a way to transmit individualized private radio wavelengths, working on breakthroughs in metallurgy, and developing a way to photograph the retina to record thought.&lt;ref&gt;Tesla Predicts New Source of Power in Year, New York Herald Tribune, 9 July 1933&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 1934 party, Tesla told reporters he had designed a superweapon he claimed would end all war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tesla's Ray |work=Time |date=23 July 1934}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="seifer1"&gt;{{cite web |last=Seifer |first=Marc |title=Tesla's "Death Ray" Machine |url=http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/tesla/esp_tesla_2.htm |publisher=bibliotecapleyades.net |accessdate=4 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would call it "[[teleforce]]", but was usually referred to as his [[death ray]].&lt;ref&gt;Cheney, Margaret &amp; Uth, Robert (2001). Tesla: Master of Lightning. Barnes &amp; Noble Books. p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; Tesla described it as a defensive weapon that would be put up along the border of a country to be used against attacking ground-based infantry or aircraft. Tesla never revealed detailed plans of how the weapon worked during his lifetime, but in 1984, they surfaced at the [[Nikola Tesla Museum]] archive in [[Belgrade]].{{sfn|Carlson|2013|p=382}} The treatise, ''The New Art of Projecting Concentrated Non-dispersive Energy through the Natural Media'', described an open-ended vacuum tube with a gas jet seal that allows particles to exit, a method of charging slugs of tungsten or mercury to millions of volts, and directing them in streams (through [[electrostatic]] repulsion).{{sfn|Seifer|1998|p=454}}{{sfn|Carlson|2013|pp=380–382}} Tesla tried to interest the [[United States Department of Defense|US War Department]],&lt;ref&gt;"Aerial Defense 'Death-Beam' Offered to U.S. By Tesla" 12 July 1940&lt;/ref&gt; the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia in the device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Seifer |first=Marc J. |title=Tesla's "death ray" machine |url=http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/tesla/esp_tesla_2.htm |accessdate=5 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, at his 79th birthday party, Tesla covered many topics. He claimed to have discovered the cosmic ray in 1896 and invented a way to produce direct current by induction, and made many claims about his [[Tesla's oscillator|mechanical oscillator]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Earl Sparling, NIKOLA TESLA, AT 79, USES EARTH TO TRANSMIT SIGNALS: EXPECTS TO HAVE $100,000,000 WITHIN TWO YEARS, New York World-Telegram, 11 July 1935&lt;/ref&gt; Describing the device (which he expected would earn him $100 million within two years) he told reporters that a version of his oscillator had caused an earthquake in his 46 East Houston Street lab and neighboring streets in downtown New York City in 1898.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; He went on to tell reporters his oscillator could destroy the [[Empire State Building]] with 5 lbs of air pressure.{{sfn|Carlson|2013|p=380}} He also explained a new technique he developed using his oscillators he called "[[Telegeodynamics]]", using it to transmit vibrations into the ground that he claimed would work over any distance to be used for communication or locating underground mineral deposits.&lt;ref name=Anderson/&gt;

At his 1937 celebration in the Grand Ballroom of Hotel New Yorker, Tesla received the "Order of the White Lion" from the Czechoslovakia ambassador and a medal from the Yugoslavian ambassador.{{sfn|Carlson|2013|pp=380–382}} On questions concerning the death ray, Tesla stated, "But it is not an experiment&amp;nbsp;... I have built, demonstrated and used it. Only a little time will pass before I can give it to the world."

In the fall of 1937, after midnight one night, Tesla left the Hotel New Yorker to make his regular commute to the cathedral and the library to feed the pigeons. While crossing a street a couple of blocks from the hotel, Tesla was unable to dodge a moving taxicab and was thrown to the ground. His back was severely wrenched and three of his ribs were broken in the accident. The full extent of his injuries were never known; Tesla refused to consult a doctor, an almost lifelong custom, and never fully recovered.{{sfn|O'Neill|1944|p=?}}{{sfn|Carlson|2013|p=389}}

== Death ==
[[File:Urn with Teslas ashes.jpg|thumb|Gilded urn with Tesla's ashes, in his favorite geometrical object, a [[sphere]] ([[Nikola Tesla Museum]], Belgrade)]]
On 7 January 1943, at the age of 86, Tesla died alone in Room 3327 of the [[New Yorker Hotel]]. His body was later found by maid Alice Monaghan after she had entered Tesla's room, ignoring the "do not disturb" sign that Tesla had placed on his door two days earlier. Assistant medical examiner H.W. Wembley examined the body and ruled that the cause of death had been [[coronary thrombosis]].&lt;ref name="teslatimeline"/&gt;

Two days later the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] ordered the [[Alien Property Custodian]] to seize Tesla's belongings.&lt;ref name="teslatimeline" /&gt; [[John G. Trump]], a professor at [[MIT|M.I.T.]] and a well-known electrical engineer serving as a technical aide to the [[National Defense Research Committee]], was called in to analyze the Tesla items, which were being held in custody.&lt;ref name="teslatimeline" /&gt; After a three-day investigation, Trump's report concluded that there was nothing which would constitute a hazard in unfriendly hands, stating:

{{quote|[Tesla's] thoughts and efforts during at least the past 15 years were primarily of a speculative, philosophical, and somewhat promotional character often concerned with the production and wireless transmission of power; but did not include new, sound, workable principles or methods for realizing such results.&lt;ref name="autogeneratedll"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Missing Papers |url=https://www.pbs.org/tesla/ll/ll_mispapers.html |publisher=PBS |accessdate=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a box purported to contain a part of Tesla's "death ray", Trump found a 45-year-old [[Decade Box|multidecade resistance box]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Childress|1993|p=249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 January 1943, New York City mayor [[Fiorello La Guardia]] read a eulogy written by Slovene-American author [[Louis Adamic]] live over the [[WNYC]] radio while violin pieces "Ave Maria" and "[[Tamo daleko]]" were played in the background.&lt;ref name="teslatimeline" /&gt; On 12 January, two thousand people attended a state funeral for Tesla at the [[Cathedral of Saint John the Divine]]. After the funeral, Tesla's body was taken to the [[Ferncliff Cemetery]] in Ardsley, New York, where it was later cremated. The following day, a second service was conducted by prominent priests in the Trinity Chapel (today's [[Trinity Chapel Complex|Serbian Orthodox Cathedral of Saint Sava]]) in New York City.&lt;ref name="teslatimeline" /&gt;

=== Estate ===
In 1952, following pressure from Tesla's nephew, Sava Kosanović, Tesla's entire estate was shipped to Belgrade in 80 trunks marked N.T.&lt;ref name="teslatimeline" /&gt; In 1957, Kosanović's secretary Charlotte Muzar transported Tesla's ashes from the United States to Belgrade.&lt;ref name="teslatimeline" /&gt; The ashes are displayed in a gold-plated sphere on a marble pedestal in the [[Nikola Tesla Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Urn with Tesla's ashes |url=http://www.tesla-museum.org/meni_en/muzej/3.htm |publisher=Tesla Museum |accessdate=16 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120825230422/http://www.tesla-museum.org/meni_en/muzej/3.htm |archivedate=25 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Patents ==
{{Main|List of Nikola Tesla patents}}

Tesla obtained around 300 patents worldwide for his inventions.&lt;ref name="sarboh"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tesla-symp06.org/papers/Tesla-Symp06_Sarboh.pdf |title=Nikola Tesla's Patents |first=Snežana |last=Šarboh |date=18–20 October 2006 |work=Sixth International Symposium Nikola Tesla |location=Belgrade, Serbia |page=6 |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030134331/http://www.tesla-symp06.org/papers/Tesla-Symp06_Sarboh.pdf |archivedate=30 October 2007 |accessdate=8 October 2010 |ref=sarbo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Tesla's patents are not accounted for, and various sources have discovered some that have lain hidden in patent archives. There are a minimum of 278 known patents&lt;ref name="sarboh" /&gt; issued to Tesla in 26 countries. Many of Tesla's patents were in the United States, [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], and [[Canada]], but many other patents were approved in countries around the globe.{{sfn|Cheney|2001|p=62}} Many inventions developed by Tesla were not put into patent protection.

== Personal life ==
Tesla worked every day from 9:00{{nbsp}}a.m. until 6:00{{nbsp}}p.m. or later, with dinner from exactly 8:10&amp;nbsp;p.m., at [[Delmonico's]] restaurant and later the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]]. Tesla would telephone his dinner order to the headwaiter, who also could be the only one to serve him. "The meal was required to be ready at eight o'clock&amp;nbsp;... He dined alone, except on the rare occasions when he would give a dinner to a group to meet his social obligations. Tesla would then resume his work, often until 3:00{{nbsp}}a.m."{{sfn|O'Neill|1944|pp=283, 286}}

For exercise, Tesla walked between {{convert|8|and|10|mi|km|0}} per day. He curled his toes one hundred times for each foot every night, saying that it stimulated his brain cells.{{sfn|Seifer|2001|p=413}}

In an interview with newspaper editor [[Arthur Brisbane]], Tesla said that he did not believe in telepathy, stating, "Suppose I made up my mind to murder you," he said, "In a second you would know it. Now, isn't that wonderful? By what process does the mind get at all this?" In the same interview, Tesla said that he believed that all fundamental laws could be reduced to one.&lt;ref name="brisbane1"&gt;{{cite news |last=Brisbane |first=Arthur |title=OUR FOREMOST ELECTRICIAN. |newspaper=''The World'' |date=22 July 1894}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tesla became a vegetarian in his later years, living on only milk, bread, honey, and vegetable juices.&lt;ref name="seifer1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=GITELMAN |first=LISA |title=Reconciling the Visionary with the Inventor Wizard: The Life and Times of Nikola Tesla |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/business/11619/ |publisher=technology review (MIT) |accessdate=3 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Appearance ===
[[File:Tesla circa 1890.jpeg|alt=head-and-shoulder shot of slender man with dark hair and moustache, dark suit and white-collar shirt|thumb|right|Tesla, aged 34, circa 1890. Photo by [[Napoleon Sarony]]]]

Tesla was {{convert|6|ft|2|in}} tall and weighed {{convert|142|lb|kg}}, with almost no weight variance from 1888 to about 1926. His appearance was described by newspaper editor [[Arthur Brisbane]] as "almost the tallest, almost the thinnest and certainly the most serious man who goes to Delmonico's regularly".&lt;ref name="brisbane1"/&gt;{{sfn|O'Neill|1944|p=292}} He was an elegant, stylish figure in New York City, meticulous in his grooming, clothing, and regimented in his daily activities, an appearance he maintained as to further his business relationships.{{sfn|O'Neill|1944|p=289}} He was also described as having light eyes, "very big hands", and "remarkably big" thumbs.&lt;ref name="brisbane1"/&gt;

===Eidetic memory===
&lt;!-- "Early years (1856–1885)" section of THIS article links here. Please fix link if changing section title --&gt;
Tesla read many works, memorizing complete books, and supposedly possessed a [[photographic memory]].{{sfn|Cheney|2001|p=33}} He was a [[Polyglot (person)|polyglot]], speaking eight languages: [[Serbo-Croatian]], [[Czech language|Czech]], English, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, and [[Latin]].{{sfn|O'Neill|1944|p=282}} Tesla related in his autobiography that he experienced detailed moments of inspiration. During his early life, Tesla was repeatedly stricken with illness. He suffered a peculiar affliction in which blinding flashes of light would appear before his eyes, often accompanied by visions.{{sfn|Cheney|2001|p=33}} Often, the visions were linked to a word or idea he might have come across; at other times they would provide the solution to a particular problem he had encountered. Just by hearing the name of an item, he would be able to envision it in realistic detail.{{sfn|Cheney|2001|p=33}} Tesla would visualize an invention in his mind with extreme precision, including all dimensions, before moving to the construction stage, a technique sometimes known as [[picture thinking]]. He typically did not make drawings by hand but worked from memory. Beginning in his childhood, Tesla had frequent flashbacks to events that had happened previously in his life.{{sfn|Cheney|2001|p=33}}

===Sleep habits===
Tesla claimed never to sleep more than two hours per night.{{sfn|O'Neill|1944|p=46}} However, he did admit to "dozing" from time to time "to recharge his batteries."{{sfn|Seifer|2001|p=413}} During his second year of study at Graz, Tesla developed a passionate proficiency for billiards, [[chess]], and [[card game|card-playing]], sometimes spending more than 48 hours in a stretch at a gaming table.{{sfn|O'Neill|1944|pp=43, 301}} On one occasion at his laboratory, Tesla worked for a period of 84 hours without rest.{{sfn|O'Neill|1944|p=208}} Kenneth Swezey, a journalist whom Tesla had befriended, confirmed that Tesla rarely slept. Swezey recalled one morning when Tesla called him at 3 a.m.: "I was sleeping in my room like one dead&amp;nbsp;... Suddenly, the telephone ring awakened me&amp;nbsp;... [Tesla] spoke animatedly, with pauses, [as he]&amp;nbsp;... work[ed] out a problem, comparing one theory to another, commenting; and when he felt he had arrived at the solution, he suddenly closed the telephone."{{sfn|Seifer|2001|p=413}}

===Relationships===

Tesla never married, explaining that his chastity was very helpful to his scientific abilities.{{sfn|Cheney|2001|p=33}} He once said in earlier years that he felt he could never be worthy enough for a woman, considering women superior in every way. His opinion had started to sway in later years when he felt that women were trying to outdo men and make themselves more dominant. This "new woman" was met with much indignation from Tesla, who felt that women were losing their femininity by trying to be in power. In an interview with the ''Galveston Daily News'' on 10 August 1924 he stated, "In place of the soft voiced, gentle woman of my reverent worship, has come the woman who thinks that her chief success in life lies in making herself as much as possible like man—in dress, voice and actions, in sports and achievements of every kind&amp;nbsp;... The tendency of women to push aside man, supplanting the old spirit of cooperation with him in all the affairs of life, is very disappointing to me".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nikola Tesla-"Mr Tesla Explains Why He Will Never Marry"|url=http://anengineersaspect.blogspot.com/2011/07/nikola-tesla-mr-tesla-explains-why-he.html|website=An Engineer's Aspect|accessdate=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he told a reporter in later years that he sometimes felt that by not marrying, he had made too great a sacrifice to his work,{{sfn|Seifer|2001}} Tesla chose to never pursue or engage in any known relationships, instead finding all the stimulation he needed in his work.

Tesla was asocial and prone to seclude himself with his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Race for Wireless: How Radio was Invented (or Discovered?)|year=2011|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=978-1-4634-3750-3|page=36|first=Gregory|last=Malanowski|quote=Tesla was definitely asocial, a loner. Although in his younger years he was immensely popular and admired by many rich, socialite women, there were no women in his life.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Cheney|Uth|Glenn|1999|loc=Preface}}{{sfn|Jonnes|2004}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=AC/DC: The Savage Tale of the First Standards War|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-04702-6|pages=163–64|first=Tom|last=McNichol|quote=Tesla's peculiar nature made him a solitary man, a loner in a field that was becoming so complex that it demanded collaboration.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when he did engage in a social life, many people spoke very positively and admiringly of Tesla. [[Robert Underwood Johnson]] described him as attaining a "distinguished sweetness, sincerity, modesty, refinement, generosity, and force."{{sfn|Seifer|2001}} His secretary, Dorothy Skerrit, wrote: "his genial smile and nobility of bearing always denoted the gentlemanly characteristics that were so ingrained in his soul."{{sfn|O'Neill|1944|p=?}} Tesla's friend, [[Julian Hawthorne]], wrote, "seldom did one meet a scientist or engineer who was also a poet, a philosopher, an appreciator of fine music, a linguist, and a connoisseur of food and drink."{{sfn|Cheney|2001|p=80}}

Tesla was a good friend of [[Francis Marion Crawford]], Robert Underwood Johnson,&lt;ref name="teslasociety1"/&gt; [[Stanford White]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stanford White|url=http://www.teslasociety.com/stanford.htm|publisher=Tesla Memorial Society of NY|accessdate=4 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fritz Lowenstein, George Scherff, and Kenneth Swezey.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Kenneth M.|last=Swezey|title=Papers 1891–1982|volume=47|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/archives/d8047.htm|publisher=National Museum of American History|accessdate=4 July 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505004025/http://americanhistory.si.edu/archives/d8047.htm|archivedate=5 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tribute to Nikola Tesla|url=http://www.teslasociety.com/posterbook.htm|publisher=Tesla Memorial Society of NY|accessdate=4 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nikola Tesla at Wardenclyffe|url=http://www.teslasociety.com/warden.htm|publisher=Tesla Memorial Society of NY |accessdate=4 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In middle age, Tesla became a close friend of [[Mark Twain]]; they spent a lot of time together in his lab and elsewhere.&lt;ref name="teslasociety1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Famous Friends|url=http://www.teslasociety.com/famousfriends.htm |publisher=Tesla Memorial Society of NY|accessdate=4 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twain notably described Tesla's [[induction motor]] invention as "the most valuable patent since the telephone."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nikola Tesla: The patron saint of geeks?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-19503846|work=News Magazine|publisher=BBC|accessdate=10 September 2012|date=10 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1920s, Tesla befriended [[George Sylvester Viereck]], a poet, writer, mystic, and later, a [[Nazi]] propagandist. Tesla occasionally attended dinner parties held by Viereck and his wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Cheney, Margaret|author2=Uth, Robert|lastauthoramp=yes|date=2001|title=Tesla: Master of Lightning|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble Books|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Neil M.|title=George Sylvester Viereck: Poet and Propagandist|publisher=Neil M. Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tesla could be harsh at times and openly expressed disgust for overweight people, such as when he fired a secretary because of her weight.{{sfn|Cheney|2001|p=110}} He was quick to criticize clothing; on several occasions, Tesla directed a subordinate to go home and change her dress.{{sfn|Cheney|2001|p=33}} When [[Thomas Edison]] died, in 1931, Tesla contributed the only negative opinion to ''[[The New York Times]]'', buried in an extensive coverage of Edison's life:

{{quote|He had no hobby, cared for no sort of amusement of any kind and lived in utter disregard of the most elementary rules of hygiene&amp;nbsp;... His method was inefficient in the extreme, for an immense ground had to be covered to get anything at all unless blind chance intervened and, at first, I was almost a sorry witness of his doings, knowing that just a little theory and calculation would have saved him 90 percent of the labor. But he had a veritable contempt for book learning and mathematical knowledge, trusting himself entirely to his inventor's instinct and practical American sense.&lt;ref name="lifeEdison"&gt;{{cite book |title=Thomas Edison: Life of an Electrifying Man |last=Biographiq |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-59986-216-3 |page=23 |publisher=Filiquarian Publishing, LLC.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Beliefs ===

==== On experimental and theoretical physics ====
Tesla disagreed with the theory of atoms being composed of smaller [[subatomic particle]]s, stating there was no such thing as an [[electron]] creating an electric charge. He believed that if electrons existed at all, they were some fourth state of matter or "sub-atom" that could exist only in an experimental vacuum and that they had nothing to do with electricity.{{sfn|O'Neill|1944|p=249}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tCcDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA171&amp;lpg=PA171 |title="The Prophet of Science Looks Into The Future," Popular Science November 1928, p. 171 |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tesla believed that atoms are immutable—they could not change state or be split in any way. He was a believer in the 19th-century concept of an all-pervasive "[[Ether (classical element)|ether]]" that transmitted electrical energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Seifer|2001|p=1745}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tesla was generally antagonistic towards theories about the conversion of matter into energy.{{sfn|O'Neill|1944|p=247}} He was also critical of Einstein's [[theory of relativity]], saying:

{{quote|I hold that space cannot be curved, for the simple reason that it can have no properties. It might as well be said that God has properties. He has not, but only attributes and these are of our own making. Of properties we can only speak when dealing with matter filling the space. To say that in the presence of large bodies space becomes curved is equivalent to stating that something can act upon nothing. I, for one, refuse to subscribe to such a view.&lt;ref&gt;''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', 11 September 1932&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Tesla claimed to have developed his own physical principle regarding matter and energy that he started working on in 1892,{{sfn|O'Neill|1944|p=?}} and in 1937, at age 81, claimed in a letter to have completed a "dynamic theory of gravity" that ''"[would] put an end to idle speculations and false conceptions, as that of curved space."'' He stated that the theory was "worked out in all details" and that he hoped to soon give it to the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tesla.hu/tesla/articles/19370710.doc Prepared Statement by Nikola Tesla] downloadable from http://www.tesla.hu&lt;/ref&gt; Further elucidation of his theory was never found in his writings.{{sfn|Cheney|2001|p=309}}

==== On society ====
[[File:Nikola Tesla by Sarony c1885-crop.png|thumb|right|Tesla circa 1885]]

Tesla is widely considered by his biographers to have been a [[Humanism|humanist]] in philosophical outlook on top of his gifts as a technological [[scientist]].{{sfn|Jonnes|2004|p=154}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Innovation: The Lessons of Nikola Tesla |year=2008 |publisher=Blue Eagle |isbn=978-987-651-009-7 |page=43 |first1=Peter |last1=Belohlavek |first2=John W |last2=Wagner |quote=This was Tesla: a scientist, philosopher, humanist, and ethical man of the world in the truest sense.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Wizard: the life and times of Nikola Tesla: biography of a genius |year=1996 |publisher=Citadel Press |isbn=978-0-8065-1960-9 |page=506 |first=Marc J |last=Seifer |quote=Frank Jenkins, "Nikola Tesla: The Man, Engineer, Inventor, Humanist and Innovator," in Nikola Tesla: Life and Work of a Genius (Belgrade: Yugoslav Society for the Promotion of Scientific Knowledge, 1976), pp. 10–21.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This did not preclude Tesla, like many of his era, becoming a proponent of an imposed [[selective breeding]] version of [[eugenics]].

Tesla expressed the belief that human "pity" had come to interfere with the natural "ruthless workings of nature." Though his argumentation did not depend on a concept of a "master race" or the inherent superiority of one person over another, he advocated for eugenics. In a 1937 interview he stated:

{{quote|...&amp;nbsp;man's new sense of pity began to interfere with the ruthless workings of nature. The only method compatible with our notions of civilization and the race is to prevent the breeding of the unfit by sterilization and the deliberate guidance of the mating instinct&amp;nbsp;... The trend of opinion among eugenists is that we must make marriage more difficult. Certainly no one who is not a desirable parent should be permitted to produce progeny. A century from now it will no more occur to a normal person to mate with a person eugenically unfit than to marry a habitual criminal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/tesla/res/res_art11.html |title=A Machine to End War |date=February 1937 |publisher=Public Broadcasting Service |accessdate=23 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1926, Tesla commented on the ills of the social subservience of women and the struggle of women toward [[gender equality]], and indicated that humanity's future would be run by "[[Queen bee (sociology)|Queen Bee]]s."

Tesla made predictions about the relevant issues of a post-World War I environment in a printed article, "Science and Discovery are the great Forces which will lead to the Consummation of the War" (20 December 1914).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Tesla |first=Nikola |title=Science and Discovery are the great Forces which will lead to the Consummation of the War |url=http://www.rastko.rs/rastko/delo/10832 |publisher=Rastko |accessdate=17 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tesla believed that the [[League of Nations]] was not a remedy for the times and issues.&lt;ref name=tesla1 /&gt;

==== On religion ====
Tesla was raised an [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]]. Later in life he did not consider himself to be a "believer in the orthodox sense," said he opposed [[religious fanaticism]], and said "Buddhism and Christianity are the greatest religions both in number of disciples and in importance".&lt;ref name="Viereck1937"&gt;{{cite web |title=A Machine to End War |url=https://www.pbs.org/tesla/res/res_art11.html |publisher=PBS.org |accessdate=27 July 2012 |last=Tesla |first=Nikola |editor=George Sylvester Viereck |date=February 1937}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also said "To me, the universe is simply a great machine which never came into being and never will end" and "what we call 'soul' or 'spirit,' is nothing more than the sum of the functionings of the body. When this functioning ceases, the 'soul' or the 'spirit' ceases likewise".&lt;ref name="Viereck1937" /&gt;

'''Otis Taylor''' (born August 11, 1942) is a former American [[college football|college]] and professional [[American football]] player, for [[Prairie View A&amp;M University]] and the [[American Football League]]'s [[Kansas City Chiefs]]. Standing 6-foot-3 and weighing 215 pounds, Taylor possessed sure hands during his career and served as a devastating downfield blocker, springing Chiefs running backs for many long runs.

==Professional career==
Taylor was selected in the [[1965 American Football League draft|1965 AFL draft]] (Chiefs) and the [[1965 NFL draft|NFL draft]], by the [[1965 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]].  After a famous "baby-sitting" incident, in which Taylor "escaped" from NFL scouts, he was signed for the Chiefs by their legendary scout [[Lloyd C.A. Wells|Lloyd Wells]].&lt;ref name=mkbthot&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BeshAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=K5sEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7181%2C3825005 |newspaper=Tuscaloosa News |agency=NEA |last=Olderman |first=Murray |title=Mama knows best, thinks Otis Taylor |date=December 18, 1966 |page=21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bdwrstep&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nZscAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=0mUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6489%2C5963371 |newspaper=Sarasota Herald-Tribune |location=Florida |agency=Associated Press |title='Back door' was right step for Chiefs' Otis Taylor |date=November 24, 1966 |page=28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taylor caught five touchdown passes during his rookie year, and followed that up in [[1966 Kansas City Chiefs season|1966]] by leading the [[American Football League|AFL]] with a 22.4 yd/catch average and finishing second in receiving yards (1,297).  At season's end, he was voted First-team All-AFL and was selected for the [[1966 AFL season|1966]] [[American Football League All-Star games|AFL All-Star]] team.  Taylor led the AFL in receiving touchdowns in 1967 with 11 and led the NFL in receiving yards in 1971 with 1,110. He made the AFC-NFC Pro Bowl twice and in 1971 was named Consensus [[1971 All-Pro Team|All-Pro]] by the [[Associated Press]] (AP), the [[Newspaper Enterprise Association]] (NEA), the [[Pro Football Writers Association]] (PFWA) and [[Pro Football Weekly]]. The PFWA also named him First-team [[1972 All-Pro Team|All-Pro]] for the 1972 season. Taylor ranks second on the  Chiefs' all-time list in receptions (410), receiving yards (7,306), receiving touchdowns (57) and 100-yard games (20).

Taylor combined with running back [[Robert Holmes (American football player)|Robert Holmes]] for what was at the time the longest reception in Chiefs history in [[1969 Kansas City Chiefs season|1969]] when he caught a pass from quarterback Mike Livingston for 79 yards, then lateraled to Holmes, who carried it another 14 yards for a touchdown. However, Taylor's most memorable highlight from that season came in the fourth and final [[Professional American football championship games|AFL-NFL World Championship Game]] on January 11, 1970, when he caught a short pass, turned downfield and stiff-armed his way to a 46-yard touchdown in the Chiefs 23-7 upset victory over the NFL's  champion, the [[1969 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]], who, before [[Super Bowl IV]], had been dubbed by some as "the greatest team in pro football history".

"Otis made my job easy," former Chiefs quarterback and [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[Len Dawson]] said. "If you got the pass to Otis, you knew he'd catch it."

The [[Professional  Football Researchers Association]] named Taylor to the PRFA Hall of Very Good Class of 2006 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.profootballresearchers.com/hall-of-very-good-2006.htm |title=Hall of Very Good Class of 2006 | accessdate=November 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ben Davidson incident===
On November 1, [[1970 Kansas City Chiefs season|1970]], the Chiefs led the [[1970 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]] 17–14 late in the fourth quarter, and a long run for a first-down run by Dawson apparently sealed victory for the Chiefs in the final minute when Dawson, as he lay on the ground, was speared by Raiders' cheap-shot artist defensive end [[Ben Davidson]], who dove into Dawson with his helmet, provoking Taylor to attack Davidson.&lt;ref name=rkkcibe&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=j1gyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=b-YFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7172%2C97394 |newspaper=Lawrence Journal-World |location=Kansas |agency=Associated Press |title=Raiders knot KC in bizarre ending |date=November 2, 1970 |page=15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbfgtg&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GQBYAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=DPcDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3409%2C5652917 |newspaper=The Bulletin |location=Bend, Oregon |agency=UPI |title=Blanda boots field goal to give Raiders tie with Chiefs |date=November 2, 1970 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a bench-clearing brawl, offsetting penalties were called, nullifying the first down under the rules in effect at that time. The Chiefs were obliged to punt, and the Raiders tied the game on a [[George Blanda]] field goal with eight seconds to play.&lt;ref name=rkkcibe/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbfgtg/&gt; Davidson's hit against Dawson not only cost the Chiefs a win, but helped Oakland win the [[AFC West]]  with a season record of 8–4–2, while defending world champion Kansas City finished 7–5–2 and out of the [[1970–71 NFL playoffs|playoffs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kcchiefs.com/history/70s/ KC Chiefs website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609052751/http://www.kcchiefs.com/history/70s/ |date=2008-06-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The very next season, the rule for offsetting personal foul penalties was changed to separate penalties during the play, and penalties after the play. The rule change was largely due to this play.

===Jack Del Rio incident===
After his time as a player had come to a close, Taylor became a scout for the Kansas City Chiefs. During the 1987 NFL Player's strike, Taylor was arriving at [[Arrowhead Stadium]] and was assaulted by [[Jack Del Rio]], who was a new player to the organization in 1987 and was striking with his teammates. Del Rio mistook Taylor for a replacement player and was told Taylor was actually a Chief's legend and retired player by fans who had come upon the assault. He later pressed charges against Del Rio and the two settled out of court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| URL=http://fox4kc.com/2017/09/27/30-years-ago-this-week-kansas-city-chiefs-players-were-center-stage-for-nfl-drama/| accessdate=November 15, 2017| website=fox4kc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pat Roy Mooney''', for more than thirty years, has worked with civil society organisations on international trade and development issues related to [[agriculture]], [[biodiversity]] and new technologies. 
Mooney has lived most of his life on the Canadian prairies. 
The author or co-author of several books on the politics of biotechnology and biodiversity, Pat Mooney received the [[Right Livelihood Award]] with [[Cary Fowler]] in the Swedish Parliament in 1985. In 1998 Mooney received the [[Pearson Medal of Peace]] from Canada’s Governor General. He also received the American "Giraffe Award" given to people "who stick their necks out". Pat Mooney has no university training, but is widely regarded as an authority on agricultural biodiversity and new technology issues.

Together with Cary Fowler and Hope Shand, Pat Mooney began working on the "seeds" issue in 1977. In 1984, the three co-founded RAFI (Rural Advancement Foundation International), whose name was changed to [[ETC Group (AGETC)|ETC Group]] (pronounced "etcetera" group) in 2001. ETC Group is a small international [[Civil Society Organization|CSO]] addressing the impact of new technologies on vulnerable communities. Mooney’s more recent work has focused on [[climate engineering|geoengineering]], [[nanotechnology]], [[synthetic biology]] and global governance of these technologies as well as corporate involvement in their development.  ETC has offices in Canada, the United States, and Mexico; and works closely with CSO partners around the world.

'''''Phaedon''''' ({{lang-de|Phädon oder über die Unsterblichkeit der Seele}}), published in 1767, is a book by the Jewish [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosopher [[Moses Mendelssohn]], in which Mendelssohn offers a defense of [[immortality]].&lt;ref name="Goodman"&gt;{{cite book |author=Goodman, Lenn E. |editor=Honderich, Ted |title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=2005 |isbn=0-19-926479-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
{{cleanup section||reason=Section is currently based on secondary sources discussing the work. It should be based principally on the book itself|date=June 2018}}
''Phaedon'' is a defense of the simplicity and immortality of the soul.&lt;ref name="Goodman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Popkind"&gt;{{cite book |author=Popkin, Richard H. |editor=Audi, Robert |title=The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |year=1999 |isbn=0-521-63722-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a series of three dialogues, revisiting the Platonic dialogue [[Phaedo]], in which [[Socrates]] argues for the immortality of the soul, in preparation for his own death. Many philosophers, including [[Plotinus]], [[Descartes]], and [[Leibniz]], argue that the soul is simple, and that because simples cannot decompose they must be immortal. In the ''Phaedon'', Mendelssohn addresses gaps in earlier versions of this argument (an argument that [[Kant]] calls ''the Achilles of Rationalist Psychology''). The Phaedon contains an original argument for the simplicity of the soul, and also an original argument that simples cannot suddenly disappear. It contains further original arguments that the soul must retain its rational capacities as long as it exists.

==Reception==
Materialistic views were at the time rampant and fashionable, and faith in immortality was at a low ebb. At this favourable juncture appeared Phädon oder über die Unsterblichkeit der Seele (Phaedo or On the Immortality of Souls; 1767). Modelled on [[Plato]]'s dialogue of the same name, Mendelssohn's work possessed some of the charm of its Greek exemplar and impressed the German world with its beauty and lucidity of style. The Phaedon was an immediate success, and besides being one of the most widely read books of its time in German it was speedily translated into several European languages, including English. The author was hailed as the "German Plato," or the "German Socrates"; royal and other aristocratic friends showered attentions on him, and it was said that "no stranger who came to Berlin failed to pay his personal respects to the German Socrates."

[[Immanuel Kant]] criticized Mendelssohn's argument for immortality in the second edition of the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' (1787), at B413–15. Commentators disagree over whether Kant's criticism is successful. Mendelssohn's arguments have been largely overlooked by contemporary analytic philosophers, but philosophers including [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[E.J. Lowe]] have offered arguments for the simplicity of the soul.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14917">'''Potassium spatial buffering''' is a mechanism for the regulation of extracellular [[potassium]] concentration by [[astrocyte]]s. Other mechanisms for astrocytic potassium clearance are carrier-operated or channel-operated potassium chloride uptake.&lt;ref&gt;Walz W (2000): Role of astrocytes in the clearance of excess extracellular potassium. Neurochemistry International&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[repolarization]] of [[neuron]]s tends to raise potassium concentration in the extracellular fluid.  If a significant rise occurs, it will interfere with neuronal signaling by depolarizing neurons. Astrocytes have large numbers of potassium ion channels facilitating removal of potassium ions from the extracellular fluid. They are taken up at one region of the astrocyte and then distributed throughout the [[cytoplasm]] of the cell, and further to its neighbors via [[gap junction]]s. This keeps extracellular potassium at levels that prevent interference with normal propagation of an [[action potential]].

==Potassium spatial buffering==
Glial cells, once believed to have a passive role in CNS, are active regulators of numerous functions in the brain, including clearance of the neurotransmitter from the synapses, guidance during neuronal migration, control of neuronal synaptic transmission, and maintaining ideal ionic environment for active communications between neurons in central nervous system.&lt;ref&gt;Kozoriz, M. G., D. C. Bates, et al. (2006). "Passing potassium with and without gap junctions." Journal of Neuroscience 26(31): 8023-8024.&lt;/ref&gt;

Neurons are surrounded by extracellular fluid rich in sodium ions and poor in potassium ions. The concentrations of these ions are reversed inside the cells. Due to the difference in concentration, there is a chemical gradient across the cell membrane, which leads to sodium influx and potassium efflux. When the action potential takes place, a considerable change in extracellular potassium concentration occurs due to the limited volume of the CNS extracellular space. The change in potassium concentration in the extracellular space impacts a variety of neuronal processes, such as maintenance of membrane potential, activation and inactivation of voltage gated channels, synaptic transmission, and electrogenic transport of neurotransmitter. Change of extracellular potassium concentration of from 3mM can affect neural activity. Therefore, there are diverse cellular mechanisms for tight control of potassium ions, the most widely accepted mechanisms being K+ spatial buffering mechanism. Orkand and his colleagues who first theorized spatial buffering stated “if a Glial cell becomes depolarized by K+ that has accumulated in the clefts, the resulting current carries K+ inward in the high [K+] region and out again, through electrically coupled Glial cells in low [K+] regions” 
In the model presented by Orkand and his colleagues, glial cells intake and traverse potassium ions from region of high concentrations to region of low concentration maintaining potassium concentration to be low in extracellular space. Glial cells are well suited for transportation of potassium ions since it has unusually high permeability to potassium ions and traverse long distance by its elongated shape or by being coupled to one another.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, K. C. and C. Nicholson (2000). "Spatial buffering of potassium ions in brain extracellular space." Biophysical Journal 78(6): 2776-2797.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Xiong, Z. Q. and F. L. Stringer (2000). "Sodium pump activity, not glial spatial buffering, clears potassium after epileptiform activity induced in the dentate gyrus." Journal of Neurophysiology 83(3): 1443-1451.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Potassium regulatory mechanisms===
Potassium buffering can be broadly categorized into two categories: Potassium uptake and Potassium spatial buffering. For potassium uptake, excess potassium ions are temporarily taken into glial cells through transporters, or potassium channels. In order to preserve electroneutrality, potassium influxes into glial cells are accompanied by influx of chlorine or efflux of sodium. It is expected that when potassium accumulates within glial cells, water influx and swelling occurs. For potassium spatial buffering, functionally coupled glial cells with high potassium permeability transfer potassium ions from regions of elevated potassium concentration to regions of lower potassium concentration. The potassium current is driven by the difference in glial syncytium membrane potential and local potassium equilibrium potential. When one region of potassium concentration increases, there is a net driving force causing potassium to flow into the glial cells. The entry of potassium causes a local depolarization that propagates electrotonically through the glial cell network which causes net driving force of potassium out of the glial cells. This process causes dispersion of local potassium with little net gain of potassium ions within the glial cells, which in turn prevents swelling. Glial cell depolarization caused by neuronal activity releases potassium onto blood stream, which was once widely hypothesized to be cause of vessel relaxation, was found to have little affect on neurovascular coupling.&lt;ref&gt;Metea, M. R., P. Kofuji, et al. (2007). "Neurovascular coupling is not mediated by potassium siphoning from glial cells." Journal of Neuroscience 27(10): 2468-2471.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the efficiency of potassium spatial buffering mechanisms, in certain regions of CNS, potassium buffering seems more dependent on active uptake mechanisms rather than spatial buffering. Therefore, the exact role of glial potassium spatial buffering in the various regions of our brain still remains uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;Kofuji, P. and E. A. Newman (2004). "Potassium buffering in the central nervous system." Neuroscience 129(4): 1045-1056. 
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kir channel===
The high permeability of glial cell membranes to potassium ions is a result of expression of high densities of potassium-selective channels with high open-probability at [[resting potential| resting membrane potentials]]. Kir channels, [[inward-rectifier potassium ion channel| potassium inward-rectifying channels]], allow passage of potassium ions inward much more readily than outward. They also display a variable conductance that positively correlates with extracellular potassium concentration: the higher the potassium concentration outside the cell, the higher the conductance. 

Kir channels are categorized into seven major subfamilies, Kir1 to Kir7, with a variety of gating mechanisms. Kir3 and Kir6 are primarily activated by intracellular [[G-protein]]s. Because they have a relatively low open-probability compared to the other families, they have little impact on potassium buffering. Kir1 and Kir7 are mainly expressed in [[epithelial cell]]s, such as those in kidney, choroid plexus, or retinal pigment epithelium, and have no impact on spatial buffering. Kir2, however, are expressed in brain neurons and glial cells. Kir4 and Kir5 are, along with Kir2, located in [[Muller glia]] and play important roles in potassium siphoning. There are some discrepancies among studies on expression of these channels in the stated locations.&lt;ref&gt;Kofuji, P. and N. C. Connors (2003). "Molecular substrates of potassium spatial buffering in glial cells." Molecular Neurobiology 28(2): 195-208.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Solessio, E., K. Rapp, et al. (2001). "Spermine mediates inward rectification in potassium channels of turtle retinal Muller cells." Journal of Neurophysiology 85(4): 1357-1367.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Panglial syncytium===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Panglial Syncytium.jpg|thumbnail|right]] --&gt;
The panglial syncytium is a large network of interconnected glial cells, which are extensively linked by gap junctions. The panglial syncytium spreads through central nervous system where it provides metabolic and osmotic support, as well as ionic regulation of myelinated axons in white matter tracts. The three types of macroglial cells within network of panglial syncytium are [[astrocytes]], [[oligodendrocytes]], and ependymocytes. Originally it was believed that there was homologous gap junction between oligodendrocytes. It was later found through untrastructural analysis that gap junctions do not directly link adjacent oligodendrocytes, rather it gap junctions with adjacent astrocytes, providing secondary pathway to nearby oligodendrocytes. With direct gap junction between myelin sheaths to surrounding astrocytes, excess potassium and osmotic water directly enters astrocyte syncytium, where it downstream to astrocyte endfeet at capillaries and the [[glia limitans]].

==Potassium siphoning==

Potassium spatial buffering that occurs in the retina is called potassium siphoning, where the [[Muller cell]] is the principal glial cell type. Muller cells have important role in retinal physiology. It maintains retinal cell metabolism and are critical in maintaining potassium homeostasis in extracellular space during neuronal activity. Like cells responsible for spatial buffering, Muller cells are distinctively permeable to potassium ions through Kir channels. Like other glial cells, the high selectivity of Muller cell membranes to potassium ions is due to the high density of Kir channels. Potassium conductance is unevenly distributed in Muller cells.&lt;ref&gt;Brew, H. and D. Attwell (1985). "Is the Potassium Channel Distribution in Glial-Cells Optimal for Spatial Buffering of Potassium." Biophysical Journal 48(5): 843-847.&lt;/ref&gt; By focally increasing potassium ions along amphibian Muller cells and recording the resulting depolarization, the observed potassium conductance was concentrated in the endfoot process of 94% of the total potassium conductance localized to the small subcellular domain. The observation lead to hypothesis that excess potassium in extracellular space is “siphoned” by the Muller cells to the vitreous humor. Potassium siphoning is a specialized form of spatial buffering mechanisms where large reservoir of potassium ions is emptied into vitreous humor. Similar distribution pattern of Kir channels could be found in amphibians.&lt;ref&gt;Karwoski, C. J., H. K. Lu, et al. (1989). "Spatial Buffering of Light-Evoked Potassium Increases by Retinal Muller (Glial) Cells." Science 244(4904): 578-580.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newman, E. A., D. A. Frambach, et al. (1984). "Control of Extracellular Potassium Levels by Retinal Glial-Cell K+ Siphoning." Science 225(4667): 1174-1175.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Winter, M., W. Eberhardt, et al. (2000). "Failure of potassium siphoning by Muller cells: A new hypothesis of perfluorocarbon liquid-induced retinopathy." Investigative Ophthalmology &amp; Visual Science 41(1): 256-261.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Existence of potassium siphoning was first reported in 1966 study by Orkand et al. In the study, optic nerve of [[Necturus]] was dissected to document the long-distance movement of potassium after the nerve stimulation. Following the low frequency stimulation of .5&amp;nbsp;Hz at the retinal end of the dissected optic nerve, depolarization 1-2mV was measured at astrocytes at the opposite end of the nerve bundle, which was up to several millimeters from the electrode. With higher frequency stimulation, higher plateau of depolarization was observed. Therefore, they hypothesized that the potassium released to extracellular compartment during axonal activity entered and depolarized nearby astrocytes, where it was transported away by unfamiliar mechanism, which caused depolarization on astrocytes distant from site of stimulation. The proposed model was actually inappropriate since at the time neither gap junctions nor syncytium among glial cells were known, and optic nerve of Necturus are unmyelinated, which means that potassium efflux occurred directly into the periaxonal extracellular space, where potassium ions in extracellular space would be directly absorbed into the abundant astrocytes around axons.&lt;ref&gt;Kofuji, P. and E. A. Newman (2004). "Potassium buffering in the central nervous system." Neuroscience 129(4): 1045-1056.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diseases==
In patients with [[Tuberous Sclerosis Complex]] (TSC), abnormalities occur in astrocyte, which leads to pathogenesis of neurological dysfunction in this disease. TSC is a multisystem genetic disease with mutation in either [[TSC1]] or [[TSC2]] gene. It results in disabling neurological symptoms such as mental retardation, autism, and seizures. Glial cells have important physiological roles of regulating neuronal excitability and preventing epilepsy. Astrocytes maintain homeostasis of excitatory substances, such as extracellular potassium, by immediate uptake through specific [[potassium channels]] and sodium potassium pumps. It is also regulated by potassium spatial buffering via astrocyte networks where astrocytes are coupled through gap junctions. Mutations in TSC1 or TSC2 gene often results in decreased expression of the astrocytic connexin protein, [[Cx43]].&lt;ref&gt;Xu, L., L. H. Zeng, et al. (2009). "Impaired astrocytic gap junction coupling and potassium buffering in a mouse model of tuberous sclerosis complex." Neurobiology of Disease 34(2): 291-299.&lt;/ref&gt; With impairment in gap junction coupling between astrocytes, myriad of abnormalities in potassium buffering occurs which results in increased extracellular potassium concentration and may predispose to neuronal hyperexcitability and seizures. According to a study done on animal model, connexin43-deficient mice showed decreased threshold for the generation of epileptiform events. The study also demonstrated role of gap junction in accelerating potassium clearance, limiting potassium accumulation during neuronal firing, and relocating potassium concentrations.&lt;ref&gt;Wallraff, A., R. Kohling, et al. (2006). "The impact of astrocytic gap junctional coupling on potassium buffering in the hippocampus." Journal of Neuroscience 26(20): 5438-5447.&lt;/ref&gt;

Demyelinating Diseases of the central nervous system, such as Neuromyelitis Optica, often leads to molecular components of the panglial syncytium being compromised, which leads to blocking of potassium spatial buffering. Without mechanism of potassium buffering, potassium induced osmotic swelling of myelin occurs where myelins are destroyed and axonal salutatory conduction ceases.&lt;ref&gt;Rash, J. E. (2010). "Molecular Disruptions of the Panglial Syncytium Block Potassium Siphoning and Axonal Saltatory Conduction: Pertinence to Neuromyelitis Optica and Other Demyelinating Diseases of the Central Nervous System." Neuroscience 168(4): 982-1008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discovery ==

Repressilators were first reported in a paper&lt;ref name="repressilator"&gt;A Synthetic Oscillatory Network of Transcriptional Regulators; [[Michael Elowitz]] and [[Stanislas Leibler]]; Nature. 2000 Jan 20;403(6767):335-8.&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Michael Elowitz]] and [[Stanislas Leibler]] in 2000. This network was designed from scratch to exhibit a stable oscillation which is reported via the expression of [[green fluorescent protein]], and hence acts like an electrical oscillator system with fixed time periods. The network was implemented in ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' using standard molecular biology methods and observations were performed that verify that the engineered colonies do indeed exhibit the desired oscillatory behavior.

The repressilator consists of three genes connected in a [[Feedback|feedback loop]], such that each gene represses the next gene in the loop, and is repressed by the previous gene. In addition, [[green fluorescent protein]] is used as a reporter so that the behavior of the network can be observed using [[fluorescence microscopy]].

[[Image:repressilator GRN.png|frame|center|600px|The repressilator genetic regulatory network.]]

The design of the repressilator was guided by two simple mathematical models, one continuous and deterministic and the other discrete and stochastic.

[[Image:continuous-repressilator.jpg|frame|333x333px|A continuous simulation of the repressilator.|left]]

[[Image:repressilator simulations.png|frame|411x411px|A discrete and stochastic simulation of the repressilator.]]

These models were analyzed to determine the values for the various rates which would yield a sustained oscillation. It was found that these oscillations were favoured by strong [[promotor (biology)|promoter]]s coupled to efficient ribosome binding sites, tight transcriptional repression (low 'leakiness'), cooperative repression characteristics, and comparable protein and mRNA decay rates.

This analysis motivated two design features which were engineered into the genes:

First, to decrease leakiness the [[promotor (biology)|promoter]] regions were replaced with a tighter hybrid [[promotor (biology)|promoter]] which combined the λ P&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; [[promotor (biology)|promoter]] with LacL and TetR operator sequences.

Second, to reduce the disparity between the lifetimes of the repressor proteins and the mRNAs, a carboxy terminal tag based on the ssRA RNA sequence was added at the 3' end of each repressor gene. This tag is recognized by proteases which target the protein for degradation

The design was implemented using a low copy [[plasmid]] encoding the repressilator, and the higher copy reporter, which were used to transform a culture of ''[[Escherichia coli]]''.

[[Image:repressilator plasmid.png|frame|center|309x309px|The plasmids used to implement the repressilator in ''Escherichia coli''.]]

== Impact ==
The repressilator is a milestone of [[synthetic biology]] which shows that [[genetic regulatory networks]] which perform a novel desired function can be designed and implemented. Further, the initial experiment&lt;ref name="repressilator" /&gt; gives new appreciation to the [[circadian clock]] found in many organisms, as they perform much more robustly than the repressilator. More recent investigations at the [[RIKEN Quantitative Biology Center]] have found that a single protein molecule could form a temperature independent, self-sustainable oscillator when it takes chemical modifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Design Principle for a Posttranslational Biochemical Oscillator|url = http://www.cell.com/article/S2211124712002872/abstract|journal = Cell Reports|issn = 2211-1247|pmid = 23084745|pages = 938-950|volume = 2|issue = 4|doi = 10.1016/j.celrep.2012.09.006|language = English|first = Craig C.|last = Jolley|first2 = Koji L.|last2 = Ode|first3 = Hiroki R.|last3 = Ueda}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Repressilators in adapted mathematical could potentially aid research in fields ranging from circadian biology to endocrinology. They are increasingly able to demonstrate the synchronization inherent in natural biological systems and the factors that affect them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Modeling a synthetic multicellular clock: Repressilators coupled by quorum sensing|url = http://www.pnas.org/content/101/30/10955|journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date = 2004-07-27|issn = 0027-8424|pmc = 503725|pmid = 15256602|pages = 10955–10960|volume = 101|issue = 30|doi = 10.1073/pnas.0307095101|first = Jordi|last = Garcia-Ojalvo|first2 = Michael B.|last2 = Elowitz|first3 = Steven H.|last3 = Strogatz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SS ''Java''''' was a British and French [[ocean liner]] built in 1865 at [[Glasgow]] by J. G. Thompson &amp; Co. It served for the [[Cunard Line]]. 1877 it was re-engined with compound engines by Fawcett, Preston &amp; Co, Liverpool and chartered to [[Warren Line]], until it had been sold to [[Red Star Line]] one year later and renamed to '''SS ''Zeeland'''''. 

In its later years it was sold to French owners in 1889 and British owners again in 1892.
In 1895 it went missing on its way from San Francisco to New York.

The '''''shi''''' ({{zh|c=尸|p=''shī''|w=''sh'ih''|l=corpse}}) was a ceremonial "personator" who represented a dead relative during ancient [[Ancestor Veneration in China|Chinese ancestral sacrifices]]. In a ''shi'' ceremony, the ancestral spirit supposedly would enter the descendant "corpse" personator, who would eat and drink sacrificial offerings and convey messages from the spirit. [[James Legge]] (1895 IV:135), an early translator of the Chinese classics, described ''shi'' personation ceremonies as "grand family reunions where the dead and the living met, eating and drinking together, where the living worshipped the dead, and the dead blessed the living." In modern terms, this ancient Chinese ''shi'' practice would be described as [[necromancy]], [[mediumship]], or [[spirit possession]].

==Word==
[[File:尸-oracle.svg|thumb|150px|[[Oracle bone script]] for ''shi'' 尸]]
[[File:尸-bronze.svg|thumb|150px|[[Bronze script]] for ''shi'' 尸]]
[[File:尸-seal.svg|thumb|150px|[[Seal script]] for ''shi'' 尸]]

The word ''shi'' 尸 "corpse; personator; inactive; lay out; manage; spirit tablet" can be discussed in terms of [[Chinese character]] evolution, [[Historical Chinese phonology|historical phonology]], [[semantics]], and English translations.

===Characters===
The modern character [[Wikt:尸|尸]] for ''shi'' "corpse; personator" is a graphic simplification of ancient [[pictograph]]s showing a person with a bent back and dangling legs. The first records of ''shi'' are on [[oracle bones]] dating from the late [[Shang Dynasty]] (ca. 1600–ca. 1046 BCE). The [[oracle bone script]] for ''shi'' 尸 "corpse" was used interchangeably for ''yi'' [[Wikt:夷|夷]] "barbarian; non-Chinese people (esp. eastern, see ''[[Dongyi]]''); at ease; level". The [[bronze script]] for ''shi'' 尸, found in [[Chinese bronze inscriptions]] dating from the Shang and [[Zhou Dynasty]] (ca. 1045 BCE-ca. 256 BCE), had a more curved back and legs. The graphically reduced [[seal script]] for ''shi'', standardized during the [[Qin Dynasty]] (221-207 BCE), resembles the [[regular script]] 尸.

Today, ''shi'' 尸 is more commonly used as the [[Radical 44|"corpse/body radical"]] in [[Chinese characters]] (number 44 in the [[List of Kangxi radicals]]) than to write the original word "corpse". Many characters written with this radical involve the body (e.g., ''niao'' [[Wikt:尿|尿]] "urine" with 水 "water"), but not all (e.g., ''wu'' [[Wikt:屋|屋]] "house; room" with 至 "go to"). 

''Shi'' 尸 "corpse; cadaver" has a [[variant Chinese character]] [[Wikt:屍|屍]] that combines the "corpse radical" 尸 with ''si'' [[Wikt:死|死]] "dead" (e.g., ''[[jiang shi]]'' 僵屍 "stiff corpse") Michael Carr (2007:358) explains, "This semantically redundant ''shi'' 屍 'dead-corpse' graphically distinguishes the original 'corpse' meaning of ''shi'' 尸from its various other meanings such as 'personator'."

===Meanings===
[[Chinese classics]] used the word ''shi'' 尸 in six meanings: 
*(1) "corpse; body of a dead person"
*(2) "personator of a dead ancestor"
*(3) "motionless; inactive"
*(4) "lay out; arrange; expose"
*(5) "manage; direct; spirit tablet"
*(6) "proper names (of a place, family, and bird)"
Carr (2007:362) outlines the semantic connections among these ''shi'' meanings. The basic meaning (1) "corpse" was semantically extended into both (2) "act on behalf of a corpse" or "personator of a dead ancestor" and (3) "act like a corpse" or "motionless; inactive; doing nothing". Meaning (4) "lay out, arrange; display" generalizes "lay out a corpse." Meaning (5) "manage; direct; ancestral tablet" links the representative ''shi'' (2) "personator" with the metaphorical replacement "ancestral tablet". Meaning (6) uses ''shi'' to transcribe proper names.

Meaning (1) is the core sense of "corpse; dead body; cadaver; carcass". Early ritual texts, notably the ''[[Liji]]'' "Classic of Rites", ''[[Zhouli]]'' "Rites of Zhou", and ''[[Etiquette and Rites|Yili]]'' "Etiquette and Rites", frequently use ''shi'' "corpse" in [[mortuary]] and [[funeral]] contexts. Here is an example ''Liji'' passage:
&lt;blockquote&gt;As soon as death took place, the corpse was transferred to the couch, and covered with a large sheet. The clothes in which the deceased had died were removed. A servant plugged the mouth open with the spoon of horn; and to keep the feet from contracting, an easy stool was employed. These observances were the same for a ruler, a great officer, and an ordinary officer. (22, tr. Legge 1885 28:181)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Shi'' meaning (2) "personator; sacrificial representative of a dead person's spirit" is discussed below.

Meaning (3) figuratively expands ''shi'' to "corpse-like", which can contextually mean either "motionless; calm; quiescent" or "inactive; negligent; remiss". A ''Shijing'' ode (245, tr. Karlgren 1950:214) laments that, "the good men sit motionless and silent". Karlgren explains, "'The good men act the corpse,' play the part of a representative of the dead at a sacrifice, who sits still and silent during the whole ceremony; here then, remain inactive, do nothing to help." The ''[[Lunyu]]'' ("Confucian Analects") uses ''shi'' to praise [[Confucius]] (tr. Legge 1895 I:235), "In bed, he did not lie like a corpse." Commentators disagree whether this means "sleep with the arms and legs sprawled out" or "sleep facing the north (the land of the dead)".

Meaning (4) is defined as Chinese ''chen'' [[Wikt:陳|陳]] "lay out; set forth, array; arrange; display". Examples in classic texts range from specifically "lay out (a corpse)" to generally "lay out; set out; arrange". The ''Liji'' distinguishes between ''shi'' 尸 "uncoffined corpse" and ''jiu'' [[Wikt:柩|柩]] (with the "wood radical" and a ''jiu'' 匛 "long; enduring" phonetic) "coffined corpse" (tr. Legge 1885 27:117): "(The corpse) on the couch is called [''shi''] (the laid out); when it is put into the coffin, that is called [''jiu''] (being in the long home)." A ''[[Shijing]]'' poem (185, tr. Karlgren 1950) refers to men called off to war, "There are mothers who set forth the (sacrificial) dishes."

Meaning (5) of ''shi'' is defined as ''zhu'' [[Wikt:主|主]] "master; manage, preside; spirit tablet, ancestral tablet". The ''[[Chuci]]'' (tr. Hawkes 1959:55) uses ''shi'' asking about [[King Wu of Zhou]], whose father [[King Wen of Zhou]] did not live to see the conquering of the previous dynasty, Shang-Yin: "When Wu set out to kill Yin, why was he so grieved? He went into the battle carrying the 'corpse.' Why was he in such haste?" Commentators disagree whether this ''shi'' means ''zhu'', specifically ''muzhu'' 木主 "wooden spirit/ancestral tablet" or ''jiu'' "corpse in a coffin". Hawkes justifies translating "corpse": "According to some accounts it was the 'spirit tablet' of his dead father [King Wen] which King Wu carried in his chariot to battle. But I think the poet understood him to have taken the actual corpse, and was surprised that he had not waited to bury it."

The sinologists Eduard Erkes and Bernhard Karlgren debated this ''Chuci'' usage of ''shi'' "corpse; spirit tablet". Erkes (1928) proposed that the ''zhu'' was a wooden ancestral tablet shaped in the image of the deceased. Karlgren (1930) disagreed and argued that the ''zhu'' was phallic shaped:
&lt;blockquote&gt;He seems to think that the substitution of [muzhu] 'wooden tablet' for the corpse (if really a corpse is intended; the word shi is ambiguous) proves the [muzhu] to have been an image of the corpse, and therefore he translates [muzhu] by 'wooden statue.' Nothing could be more arbitrary. The [muzhu], wooden ancestral tablet, was the resting place of the ancestor's spirit, once his body was dead and decomposed. In this sense it was a substitute for his body, his spiritual force had entered it, and therefore it was carried into battle, bringing this mental force of his into play on the side of his descendant. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Erkes (1931) countered Karlgren by citing other texts describing a human-shaped ''muzhu'' "wooden lord". For instance, the ''[[Shiji]]'' ("Record of History", tr. Erkes) records this King Wu story with ''muzhu'' instead of ''shi'': "He (viz. Wu-Wang) made a wooden image of Wen-Wang and took it with [him] on his carriage into the battle." Erkes further suggested, "very probably the custom of carrying a [muzhu] into battle had developed from an earlier one of taking the body itself, and that therefore the [muzhu] was something representing the corpse, i.e., an image of the deceased."

Meaning (6) includes some semantically unrelated usages of ''shi''. ''Shi'' 尸 is an ancient place name (in [[Henan]]); a surname (e.g., the [[Syncretism (Chinese philosophy)|Syncretist]] philosopher [[Shizi (book)|Shizi]] 尸子, ca. 390–330 BCE); and a variant of ''shi'' [[Wikt:鳲|鳲]] (which is used in bird names like ''shijiu'' 鳲鳩 "cuckoo; turtledove").

===Pronunciations and etymologies===
The [[Standard Chinese]] ''shī'' pronunciation of 尸 phonologically descends from (ca. 6th century CE) [[Middle Chinese]] and (ca. 6th century BCE) [[Old Chinese]]. Compare these Middle and Old Chinese reconstructions of ''shi'' 尸 "corpse" and ''yi'' 夷 "barbarian" (which anciently had interchangeable characters): ''śi'' &lt; *''śjər'' 尸and ''i'' &lt; *''djər'' 夷 ([[Bernhard Karlgren]] 1957), ''syij'' &lt; *''hljij'' 尸and ''yij'' &lt; *''ljɨj'' 夷 (William Baxter 1992), and ''śi'' &lt; *''lhi'' 尸 and ''ji'' &lt; *''ləi'' 夷 (Axel Schuessler 2009).

There are several hypothetical [[etymologies]] for ''shi'' "corpse". Karlgren proposed that ''si'' &lt; *''sjər'' 死 "die, dead" and ''shi'' &lt; *''śjər'' 尸 "the dead, corpse" were etymologically [[cognate]]. Paul K. Benedict (1972) suggested possible [[Proto-Sino-Tibetan]] roots for ''shi'': either *''(s-)raw'' "corpse; carcass" or *''siy'' "die". Schuessler (2007) hypothesizes a semantic development from *''li'' 夷 "extend; expose; display; set out; spread out" to *''lhi'' 尸 "to spread out; lie down flat (in order to sleep); motionless; to set forth (sacrificial dishes)", to "personator of a dead ancestor", to "corpse". He rejects Karlgren's assumption that ''shi'' "corpse" is cognate to ''si'' "to die", "because the MC [Middle Chinese] initial ''ś-'' (&lt; *''lh-'', *''nh-'', *''hj-'') never derives from an *''s-'', except when they share an initial *''l'' or *''n''."

===Translations===
English translations of the ceremonial ''shi'' 尸 include ''[[personator]]'', ''[[impersonator]]'', ''[[:wikt:representative|representative]]'', ''[[Mediumship|medium]]'', and ''[[shaman]]''. Carr reviews the choices.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Obviously, rendering this into English is problematic because there is no Western analogy for the ceremonial ''shi'' 'corpse.' ''Personator'' is chosen as the nearest English translation. ''Impersonator'' would be possible, but this word implies falsehood, which was not originally associated with the ''shi''. ''Representative'' is too general in meaning, and does not usually have a sense of spirituality, unless modified by ''of the dead/ancestor''. Paper [1995] suggests ''Incorporator of the Dead'', which has a parallel 'one who embodies' etymology, but the derivate words ''incorporate'' and ''incorporation'' commonly have other meanings. ''Medium'' and ''shaman'' are similar with ''shi'' in meaning and are part of Chinese traditions; however, the descriptions of a dignified personator are unlike the spirit-possession of either. Another translational tactic would be to coin a [[nonce word]], such as Waley's [1937] "the Dead One," Eberhard's [1968] "death boy," or Wilhelm's [1967] "corpse boy," but the sense of such a coinage is not always clear. Therefore, in the absence of a better English word, ''personator'' will translate this meaning of ''shi''. (2007:364-365) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Early descriptions==
Zhou Dynasty classic texts (c. 11th-3rd centuries BCE) use the word ''shi'' 尸 hundreds of times. Lothar von Falkenhausen contrasts the frequently recorded ''shi'' "personator" with the rarely noted [[Wu (shaman)|''wu'']] [[Wikt:巫|巫]] "shaman; spirit medium". 
&lt;blockquote&gt;At ancestral sacrifices, the ancestral spirits descend into individuals designated from among their descendants, the "Impersonators" (''shi'' 尸). Occupying their ritual rôle by virtue of their kinship position vis-à-vis the ancestor that is sacrificed to, the Impersonators are not trained religious specialists like the Spirit Mediums. Although it has been speculated that the actions of the ''shi'' may have originally involved trance and possession, the surviving source materials — none earlier than the Western Zhou period — show them as staid and passive, acting with the utmost demeanor and dignity. (1995) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some early ''shi'' meanings are contextually ambiguous. For instance, the ''[[Yijing]]'' ("Book of Changes") uses ''yu shi'' [[Wikt:輿|輿]]尸 "carry corpses; corpse carrier" twice for [[I Ching hexagrams#Hexagram 7|Hexagram 7]] (tr. Wilhelm 1967:34-35): "Perchance the army carries corpses in the wagon. Misfortune … Let the eldest lead the army. The younger transports corpses. Then perseverance brings misfortune." [[Richard Wilhelm (sinologist)|Richard Wilhelm]] summarizes the ''Yijing'' commentaries.
&lt;blockquote&gt; Here we have a choice of two explanations. One points to defeat because someone other than the chosen leader interferes with the command; the other is similar in its general meaning, but the expression, "carries corpses in the wagon," is interpreted differently. At burials and at sacrifices to the dead it was customary in China for the deceased to whom the sacrifice was made to be represented by a boy of the family, who sat in the dead man's place and was honored as his representative. On the basis of this custom the text is interpreted as meaning that a "corpse boy" is sitting in the wagon, or, in other words, that authority is not being exercised by the proper leaders but has been usurped by others. (1967:34) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Marshall (2002:77) concludes this hexagram refers to carrying a corpse, and compares the "Israelites carrying the Ark of the Covenant into battle against the Philistines".

===Shijing===
The ''[[Shijing]]'' ("Classic of Poetry", ca. 11th-6th centuries BCE) contains early and detailed descriptions of personation ceremonies, in the following themes.
&lt;blockquote&gt;There is an abundance of sacrificial wine and food (odes 166, 209, 210, and 248) shared by both the ancestral spirits (through the personator) and their descendants. Drunkenness is frequently mentioned: 209/5 "The spirits [note: 'souls' not 'liquor'] are all drunk," 209/6 "all are happy; they are drunk," 247/1, 2 "We are drunk with wine," and 248/5 "the representative of the (dead) princes comes and feasts and is befumed (by the spirits); the good wine makes you merry." Most significantly, the ancestral spirits speak directly through the intoxicated personators (166, 210, and 247), approve of the sacrificial offerings, and bless their descendants (166, 209, 210, 247, and 248). (Carr 2007:369) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Shi'' "personator" occurs fourteen times in two pairs of consecutive ''Shijing'' odes (209–210 and 247–248, tr. Karlgren 1950:203-204). Ode 209 says "we make (the representative of the dead) sit at ease, we (assist him =) encourage him to eat" and "The august representative of the dead then rises, the drums and bells (by their sound) escort away the representative." The following ode 210 describes sacrificial wine and food, "he presents them  to our representative of the dead and to our guests."

''Shijing'' odes 247 and 248, which portray ancestral feasts to the Zhou royal house, exclusively use the term ''gongshi'' 公尸 with the modifier ''gong'' [[Wikt:公|公]] "prince; duke; public; palace; effort". Compare these ''gongshi'' translations: "representative of the (dead) princes" (Karlgren), "personators of your ancestors" (Legge, admitting 1895 IV:447, "The expression 公尸, 'ducal personators,' is somewhat difficult to account for"), "impersonator of the Ancient", "ducal Dead", or "Dead One" (Waley, noting 1937:215, "Impersonator of a former Duke or ruler"). Ode 247 (''Jizui'' 既醉 "Already Drunk") describes a sacrificial feast for ancestral spirits, and says "the representative of the (dead) princes makes a happy announcement".

Ode 248 (''Fuyi'' 鳧鷖 "Wild Ducks") describes another feast, which commentators say was held on the following day to reward the personator, and details sacrificial offerings and ancestral blessings.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The wild ducks are on the [Jing] (river); the representative of the (dead) princes comes and feasts and is at peace; your wine is clear, your viands are fragrant; the representative feasts and drinks; felicity and blessings come and (achieve, complete you =) make you perfect. &lt;br&gt;
The wild ducks are on the sands; the representative of the (dead) princes comes and feasts and (approves =) finds it good; your wine is plentiful, your viands are fine; the representative feasts and drinks; felicity and blessings come and (act for =) favor you. &lt;br&gt;
The wild ducks are on the island; the representative of the (dead) prices comes and feasts and reposes; your wine is strained, your viands are sliced; the representative feasts and drinks; felicity and blessings come and descend on you. &lt;br&gt;
The wild ducks are at the junction of the river; the representative of the (dead) princes comes and feasts and is (treated in temple-fashion =) revered; the feast is in the temple, that is where felicity and blessings descend; the representative feasts and drinks; felicity and blessings come and are piled up (heavily =) amply on you. &lt;br&gt;
The wild ducks are in the gorge; the representative of the (dead) princes comes and feasts and is befumed (by the spirits); the good wine makes you merry; the roast and broiled things are fragrant; the representative feasts and drinks; there will be no after trouble. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Besides the ''Shijing'', other texts refer to ''shi'' frequently drinking sacrificial [[Chinese alcoholic beverages|''jiu'']] 酒 "alcoholic beverage; liquor", which Paper (1995:113) interprets as a ritual means to induce hallucinations of ancestral spirits. Based upon a ''Liji'' ceremony (tr. Legge 1885 28:246) describing a ''shi'' personator drinking nine cups of ''jiu'', with an estimated alcohol content from 5% to 8%, and volume measurements of Zhou bronze sacrificial cups, Paper (1995:114) calculates a "conservative estimate is that the ''shi'' consumed between 2.4 and 3.9 ounces of pure alcohol (equivalent to between 5 and 8 bar shots of eighty-proof liquor)."

===Child personators===
Several texts refer to a Chinese custom that a personator should be a child of the same sex as the dead ancestor, preferably either a legitimate grandson or his wife. However, personation by younger relatives, who were of lower [[social status]] than their elders, created an exception to traditional Chinese culture. The earliest textual reference comes from the ''[[Mencius (book)|Mengzi]]'' ("Book of Mencius") questioning the status shown to a younger brother during the personation ceremony.
&lt;blockquote&gt;You should ask him, "Which do you respect most, — your uncle, or your younger brother?" He will answer, "My uncle." Ask him again, "If your younger brother be personating a dead ancestor, to which do you show the greater respect, — to him or to your uncle?" He will say, "To my younger brother." You can go on, "But where is the respect due, as you said, to your uncle?" He will reply to this, "I show the respect to my younger brother because of the position which he occupies." (6, tr. Legge 1895 IV:400). &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The ''Liji'' reiterates that personation contradicted the established social hierarchy (18, tr. Legge 1895 28:88): "Thus it is that there are two among his subjects whom the ruler does not treat as subjects. When one is personating (his ancestor) he does not treat him as such, nor does he treat his master as such." Another ''Liji'' passage (7, tr. Legge 1895 27:337-338) explains: "A rule of propriety says, 'A superior man may carry his grandson in his arms, but not his son.' This tells us that a grandson may be the personator of his deceased grandfather (at sacrifices), but a son cannot be so of his father." When a grandson personated his grandfather's spirit, it reversed the normal family hierarchy and a father would have to worship his own son. 

Scholars have differing hypotheses explaining why a grandchild would make the most suitable personator. [[Marcel Granet]] (1930:337–338) said the basic reason was a predominance of uterine over agnatic [[primogeniture]]; the grandfather is the closest of the uterine relatives, and thus closer to his grandson than the father is. [[Wolfram Eberhard]] (1968:338) explained that a child makes the best personator owing to the ancient Chinese believed that a soul is small. [[Julian Jaynes]] (1976:344–345) mentions a Greek parallel; the philosopher [[Iamblichus]] wrote that "young and simple persons" make the most suitable mediums. Stephen Bokenkamp mentions examples besides ''shi'' rituals.
&lt;blockquote&gt;In China, possessions by spirits that occurred outside of this ritual scenario often involved younger members of the family as well. As in instances of mediumism around the world, the youthful and illiterate were regarded as more reliable conduits to the dead, since they could hardly be suspected of having fabricated their utterances and writings themselves. This fact brings to the fore questions of power. Women and junior male members of a family frequently found that mediumism was a way to bring attention to their own, otherwise easily ignored, concerns. (2007:40) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Female personators===
Two ritual texts mention female personators. The ''Liji'' (15, tr. Legge 1885 28:75) describes a wife personating her husband's dead grandmother: "A wife, on festive occasions, even though it were on receiving a gift from the ruler, (only) made a curtsy. When seated as a personatrix (of the deceased grandmother of her husband), she did not bow with her head to her hands, but made the curtsy." The ''Yili'' (14, tr. Steele 1917:119.) euphemistically says a female personator should preferably not be the wife of a concubine's grandson; "A man personates a dead man, and a woman a woman. In the latter case a woman of a different surname is chosen, and as such not one of inferior standing."

===Historical changes in personation===
Several early texts and commentaries reiterate a traditional history of personation beginning in the second millennium BCE as a sacred communion with ancestral spirits, but ending as a drinking party in the late 1st millennium BCE. When the personation ceremony supposedly originated during the [[Xia Dynasty]] (ca. 2100-ca. 1600 BCE), a personator would make contact with the dead ancestral spirit before sitting down to eat and drink. During the Yin or Shang Dynasty (ca. 1600-1046 BCE), a personator would sometimes sit down without having contacted the spirit, and by the late Zhou Dynasty (1045-256 BCE), a personation ceremony became a revelry with several personators repeatedly making toasts and drinking sacrificial wines.

Two ''Liji'' chapters describe how personation rituals changed during the Zhou period.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Under the [Zhou] dynasty the representatives of the dead sat. Their monitors and cup-suppliers observed no regular rules. The usages were the same (as those of Yin [Shang]), and the underlying principle was one. Under the [Xia] dynasty, the personators had stood till the sacrifice was ended (whereas) under the Yin [Shang] they sat. Under [Zhou], when the cup went round among all, there were six personators. [Zengzi] said, "The usages of [Zhou] might be compared to a subscription club." (10, tr. Legge 1885 27:405-406) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;(When the representative of the departed) had made the libation with the [jia] cup, or the horn, (the sacrificer) was told (to bow to him) to put him at ease. Anciently, the representative stood when nothing was being done; when anything was being done, he sat. He personated the spirit. The officer of prayer was the medium of communication between him and the sacrificer. (11, tr. Legge 1885 27:446) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Later sources repeat this legendary history of personation. For example, He Xiu 何休's 2nd-century commentary to the ''[[Spring and Autumn Annals|Chunqiu]]'' ("Spring and Autumn Annals") ''[[Gongyang Zhuan]]'' says (tr. Carr 2007:371), "The Xia had standing personators, the Shang [Yin] had sitting personators, and the Zhou had six personators who would make serial toasts." Granet (1930:337) mentions the Zhou personation parties: "It was not long before this archaic custom was criticized by the ritualists. When the sacrifices were offered simultaneously to several ancestors each of whom was represented, the ceremony was found indeed to assume a displeasing likeness to a picnic."

===Doubts about personation===
The above ''Liji'' description of Zhou "subscription club" personation ceremonies quotes [[Confucius]]'s student and compiler [[Zengzi]] (505-436 BCE). The ''Liji'' contains three passages where Zengzi questions his teacher about whether personators were needed for ancestral rituals. For instance:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[Zengzi] asked, "Is it necessary that there should be a representative of the dead in sacrifices? Or may he be dispensed with as when the satisfying offerings are made to the dead?" Confucius said, "In sacrificing to a full-grown man for whom there have been the funeral rites, there must be such a representative, who should be a grandson; and if the grandson is too young, someone must be employed to carry him in his arms. If there be no grandson, some one of the same surname should be selected for the occasion. In sacrificing to the one who had died prematurely, there are (only) the satisfying offerings, for he was not full-grown. To sacrifice to a full-grown man, for whom there have been the funeral rites without a representative, would be to treat him as if he had died prematurely." (7, tr. Legge 1885 27:337-338) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Hypothetical origins ==
Chinese scholars have long disagreed about when and how ''shi'' personation originated. Henri Doré (1914 1:99-102) summarizes the four principal opinions, which are worth quoting in full.

The first opinion is that personation was a bygone superstition. The [[Tang Dynasty]] historian [[Du You]] criticizes the ''shi'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;The ancients employed a personator. This rite deserves censure, and has been abolished by our great Worthies. One vied with the other in practicing it. Now that an era of progress has set in, and these silly customs have disappeared, it is important not to revive them; common sense bids to refrain from them. Some half-baked literati of our days would fain re-establish this ceremony of the personator. This is quite absurd. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The second opinion is that the personator was not the agent of the departed, but merely its metaphorical representative or ''shenxiang'' 神象 "image of the spirit". The [[Han Dynasty]] historian [[Ban Gu]] explains:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The personator is found in the ceremony wherein sacrifice is offered to ancestors, because the soul emitting no perceptible sounds and having no visible form, the loving sentiment of filial piety finds no means of displaying itself, hence a personator has been chosen to whom meats are offered, after which he breaks the bowls, quite rejoiced, as if his own father had eaten plenty. The personator, drinking abundantly, imparts the illusion that it is the soul which is satiated. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Carr (2007:386) notes, "This passage sounds as though Ban had personally observed a personation ceremony."    
   
Some [[Qing Dynasty]] scholars held a third opinion, namely, that the personator was bearer of the ancestral tablet. The ''Jishuo quanzhen'' 集說詮真 "Collected Sayings Explaining Truth" says, "The filial son chooses a personator to carry the tablet, but not to be the resting place of the soul of the dead person. His intention is therefore manifest." The ''Yuzhou dayiyi'' 宇宙大疑議 "Discussion of Universal Great Doubts" says: "The personator is employed during sacrifices to the dead, in order to carry the ancestral tablet … hence there is no need of having such a one immediately after death, as the tablet is not yet erected."

The fourth opinion refutes the first three condemnations of personators as mere representatives or tablet-holders for the dead, and contends that a personator was temporarily the seat of a dead ancestor's soul. Two leading [[Neo-Confucianist]] philosophers held this judgment.
[[Cheng Yi (philosopher)|Cheng Yi]] writes: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The ancients, when sacrificing to the dead, employed the personator, because the soul and the vital force of the dead person after being separated from the body, seek an agent of the same nature. Now, men being all of the same kind, the father and the children being all of one family and of the same stock, the soul of the departed person is requested to come and establish its seat in one of them as in an agent. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
His follower [[Zhu Xi]] concurs:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In ancient times all employed a personator when sacrificing to the dead. Since the descendants continue the life of their ancestors, the personator shares, therefore, in the life of the departed person, and the ancestor's soul descends undoubtedly upon his descendants, and reposes therein to enjoy the sacrifice offered. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Carr (2007:387-388) offers a contemporary explanation for ''shi'' "corpse" personation: [[Julian Jaynes]]'s psychological [[Bicameralism (psychology)|bicameralism]] hypothesis. Jaynes proposed that human "[[consciousness]]", meaning [[self-awareness]] and [[cognition]], began evolving around 1000 BCE. Prior to that, ancient people had "bicameral mentality" in which one part of the brain "spoke" (often in an [[authority figure]]'s voice) while another part listened and obeyed. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;According to the theory of the bicameral mind, hallucinations of a person in some authority could continue after death as an everyday matter. And hence the almost universal custom of feeding the corpses after death, and burying them with the appurtenances of life. (Jaynes 1976:290) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
If the original personators were bicameral, they could have directly hallucinated voices from a ''shi'' "corpse". Carr notes the historical correspondence between Jaynes's first millennium BCE timeline for the breakdown of the bicameral mind in other parts of the world and the 11th-3rd centuries BCE personation practices in China.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Several early sources give variations of the same chronicle about the personation ceremony. It began during the Xia Dynasty, when personators would communicate on behalf of the dead; continued during the Shang and Western Zhou Dynasties; but was criticized and discontinued after the Eastern Zhou Dynasty when personators were no longer able to speak for the dead. (2007:387) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:SanXingDui ZongMuMianJu.jpg|thumb|[[Sanxingdui]] bronze mask]]
Wearing [[Ritual mask#Ritual masks|ritual masks]] is a recent hypothesis about ''shi''. Paper (1995:82) suggested the possibility that Shang and Zhou ''shi'' wore bronze masks "symbolizing the spirit of the dead to whom the sacrifices were offered". Liu believes the phantasmagoric bronze masks discovered at [[Sanxingdui]], dating from c. 12th-11th centuries BCE, might have been ritually worn by ''shi'' 尸.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The ''shi'' was generally a close, young relative who wore a costume (possibly including a mask) reproducing the features of the dead person. The ''shi'' was an impersonator, that is, a person serving as a reminder of the ancestor to whom sacrifice was being offered. During such a ceremony, the impersonator was much more than an actor in a drama. Although the exact meaning may have been different, the group of Sanxingdui masked figures in bronze all have the character of an impersonator. It is likely the masks were used to impersonate and identify with certain supernatural beings in order to effect some communal good. (2000:37) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Social protection''', as defined by the [[United Nations Research Institute For Social Development]], is concerned with preventing, managing, and overcoming situations that adversely affect people’s [[well being]].&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Research Institute for Social Development (UNRISD). 2010.  Combating [[Poverty]] and Inequality: Structural Change, Social Policy and Politics.&lt;/ref&gt;  Social protection consists of policies and programs designed to reduce [[poverty]] and vulnerability by promoting efficient [[labour market]]s, diminishing people's exposure to risks, and enhancing their capacity to manage economic and social risks, such as [[unemployment]], [[social exclusion|exclusion]], sickness, [[disability]] and old age.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank. 2001. Social Protection Sector Strategy Paper: From Safety Net to Springboard. Washington DC, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common types of social protection:

*'''Labor market interventions''' are policies and programs designed to promote employment, the efficient operation of labor markets and the protection of workers.
*'''[[Social insurance]]''' mitigates risks associated with unemployment, ill health, disability, work-related injury and old age, such as health insurance or unemployment insurance.
*'''[[Social safety net|Social assistance]]''' is when resources, either cash or in-kind, are transferred to vulnerable individuals or households with no other means of adequate support, including single parents, the homeless, or the physically or mentally challenged.

==History of social protection==
Traditionally, social protection has been used in the [[European welfare state]] and other parts of the developed world to maintain a certain living standard, and address transient poverty.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Research Institute for Social Development (UNRISD). 2010.  Combati
ng Poverty and Inequality: Structural Change, Social Policy and Politics.&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the first examples of state-provided social protection can be tracked to the Roman Emperor [[Trajan]], who expanded a program for free grain to include more poor citizens of the empire. In addition, he instituted public funds to support poor children.&lt;ref&gt;Hammond, Mason.  “Trajan”. Encyclopædia Britannica.  http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/602150/Trajan#tab=active~checked%2Citems~checked&amp;title=Trajan%20--%20Britannica%20Online%20Encyclopedia.&lt;/ref&gt; Organized [[welfare]] was not common until the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  It was during this period that in both Germany and Great Britain, welfare systems were established to target the working classes (see [[National Insurance]]).&lt;ref&gt;“The Liberal reforms 1906-1914”.  BBC. http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/history/mwh/britain/liberalreformsrev2.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; The United States followed several years later, during the [[Great Depression]], with emergency relief for those struck the hardest.  However, modern social protection has grown to envelop a much broader range of issues and purposes; it is now being used as a policy approach in developing nations, to address issues of persistent poverty and target structural causes.  Moreover, it is designed to lift recipients out of poverty, rather than exclusively providing passive protection against contingencies .&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;United Nations Research Institute for Social Development (UNRISD). 2010.  Combating Poverty and Inequality: Structural Change, Social Policy and Politics.&lt;/ref&gt; social protection has rapidly been used in trying to reduce and ultimately eliminate poverty and suffering in developing countries (mostly in Africa), so to enhance and promote economic and social growth.

==Types of social protection==

===Labor market Interventions===
Labor market interventions, consisting of both active and passive policies, provide protection for the poor who are capable of gaining employment. Passive programs, such as unemployment insurance, income support and changes in labor legislation, allieviate the financial needs of the unemployed but are not designed to improve their employability.&lt;ref&gt;Governance and Social Development Resource Centre. [Date accessed October 31, 2010]  (http://www.gsdrc.org/go/topic-guides/social-protection/types-of-social-protection)&lt;/ref&gt; A European Union-funded research as part of the DRIVERS project revealed a linear
relationship between investments in national active labour market policies (specifically those directed towards integrating vulnerable groups into employment) and quality of work. It found that European countries with more active labour market policies seem to have healthier, less stressed workplaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://health-gradient.eu/lower-education-leads-to-a-more-stressful-working-life-labour-market-policies-can-mitigate-this/|title=Health Gradient - EuroHealthNet|website=health-gradient.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, active programs focus on directly increasing the access of unemployed workers.&lt;ref&gt;Asian Development Bank. Labor. [Date accessed October 31, 2010]   (http://www.adb.org/SocialProtection/labor.asp)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Active labour market policies]] (ALMPs) are used to reduce the risk of unemployment and to increase the earnings capacity of workers.  ALMPs have two basic objectives: (1) economic, by increasing the ability of the unemployed to find jobs, and increase productivity and earnings; and (2) social, by improving the inclusion and participation of productive employment. These programs have the ability to increase employment opportunities and address the social problems that often accompany high unemployment.  Active policies are a way of reversing the negative effects of industrial restructuring in transition economies and to help integrate vulnerable people furthest from the labor markets.&lt;ref&gt;The World Bank. Social Protection. [Date accessed October 31, 2010] (http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTSOCIALPROTECTION/
EXTLM/0,,contentMDK:20223809~menuPK:7109967~pagePK:148956~piPK:216618~theSitePK:390615,00.html)&lt;/ref&gt;  ALMPs are often targeted to the long-term unemployed, workers in poor families, and particular groups with labor market disadvantages. These programs have important social, as well as economic, objectives.  Active labor market programs include a wide range of activities to stimulate employment and productivity such as:
*'''Employment services.''' These services include counseling, placement assistance, job matching, labor exchanges, and other related services to improve the functioning of the labor market.
*'''Job Training'''. This includes training/retraining for the unemployed, workers in mass layoffs and youth to increase the quantity of work supply.
*'''Direct employment generation''' The promotion of small and medium enterprises (e.g., public works projects, subsidies) to increase labor demand.&lt;ref&gt;Betcherman, G., Olivas, K. and Dar, A., 2004, ‘Impacts of Active Labor Market Programs: New Evidence from Evaluations with Particular Attention to Developing and Transition Countries’, Social Protection Discussion Paper Series no. 0402, World Bank, Washington&lt;/ref&gt;
A common issue in implementing successful labor market interventions is how to incorporate the informal economy, which comprises a significant portion of the workforce in developing countries.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Governance and Social Development Resource Centre. [Date accessed October 31, 2010]  (http://www.gsdrc.org/go/topic-guides/social protection/types-of-social-protection)&lt;/ref&gt; Informal employment comprises between half and three quarters of non-agricultural employment in the majority of these countries. The proportion of informal employment increases when agriculture is taken into account.&lt;ref&gt;International Labour Organization. [Date accessed October 31, 2010] (http://www.ilo.org/public/english/protection/secsoc/areas/policy/informal.htm)&lt;/ref&gt;  Most informal workers are not covered by social security schemes, occupational safety and health measures, working conditions regulations and have limited access to health services and work-related measures of social protection.  Labor market interventions work to integrate the different strategies to prevent and compensate occupational and social risks in the informal economy.  The strategies that include measures to prevent and mitigate the impact of risks are the most effective.&lt;ref&gt;Lund, F., 2009, ‘Social Protection and the Informal Economy: Linkages and Good Practices for Poverty Reduction and Empowerment’, in Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), ‘Promoting Pro-Poor Growth: Social Protection’, OECD, Paris, pp.69-88&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, public expenditure on labor market policy (LMP) interventions falls within three main categories:
*'''Labor Market Services (1)''' 
*'''Total LMP Measures (2-7)'''
training (2),
job rotation &amp; job sharing (3),
employment incentives (4),
supported employment &amp; rehabilitation (5),
direct job creation (6),
start-up incentives (7),

*'''Total LMP supports (8-9)'''
out-of-work income maintenance and support (8),
early retirement (9)

===Social insurance===
{{Main|Social insurance}}
Social insurance schemes are contributory programs that protect beneficiaries from catastrophic expenses in exchange for regular payments of premiums.   Health costs can be very high, so health insurance schemes are a popular way reducing risk in the event of shock.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; However, an individual with low income may not be able to afford insurance.  Some argue that insurance schemes should be complemented with social assistance.   Community-based health insurance allows pooling in settings where institutional capacity is too weak to organize nationwide risk-pooling, especially in low-income countries, making insurance more affordable.  In risk-sharing schemes, the insurance premium is unrelated to the likelihood that the beneficiary will fall ill and benefits are provided on the basis of need.&lt;ref&gt;Ranson, M., 2002, ‘Reduction of Catastrophic Health Care Expenditures by a Community-Based Health Insurance Scheme in Gujarat, India: Current Experiences and Challenges’, Bulletin of the World Health Organization, vol. 80, no. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social assistance===
[[Social assistance]] schemes comprise programs designed to help the most [[social vulnerability|vulnerable individuals]] ( i.e., those with no other means of support such as single parent households, victims of natural disasters or civil conflict, handicapped people, or the destitute poor), households and communities to meet a [[Social floor]] and improve living standards.  These programs consist of all forms of public action, government and non-government, that are designed to transfer resources, either cash or in-kind (e.g. food transfers), to eligible vulnerable and deprived persons.&lt;ref&gt;Howell, F., 2001, 'Social Assistance - Theoretical Background', in 'Social Protection in the Asia and Pacific', ed. I. Ortiz, Asian Development Bank, Manila, ch. 7&lt;/ref&gt;  Social assistance interventions may include:
*'''[[Welfare]] and social services''' to highly vulnerable groups such as the physically or mentally disabled, orphans, or substance abusers.
*'''Cash or in-kind transfers''' such as [[Ration stamp|food stamps]] and family allowances.
*'''Temporary subsidies''' such as life-line tariffs, housing subsidies, or support of lower prices of staple food in times of crisis.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Asian Development Bank. Social Protection. [Date accessed October 31, 2010] (http://www.adb.org/SocialProtection/default.asp)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

==Policy issues==

===Universalism vs. Targeting===
There are two main schools of thought concerning scope of social protection.  Universalism argues that each person, by merit of simply being a citizen should be entitled to benefits from social protection programs.  Such a policy would avoid [[means-testing]] and any conditionalities such as work requirements.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;   One of the greatest benefits to this policy perspective is social solidarity, since everyone contributes collaboratively to a system that everyone also benefits from.  [[Social security]] is one such example.  Moreover, economists have argued that universalism is an investment in human capital that aids the development of a nation as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Mares, I. 2007. “The economic consequences of the welfare state”.  International Social Security Review, Vol. 60, No. 2/3.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Bank]]'s 2019 [[World Development Report]] ''The Changing Nature of Work''&lt;ref&gt;[http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/816281518818814423/pdf/2019-WDR-Report.pdf World Bank World Development Report 2019: The Changing Nature of Work.]&lt;/ref&gt; considers social protection from this perspective, describing existing schemes around the world and presenting simulation data on the potential costs.
Opponents would argue that universalism is cost-ineffective and unfairly distorts individual efforts. Such an argument points toward targeting as a better solution.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Sen, Amartya. 1999. Development as Freedom. New York: Anchor Books.&lt;/ref&gt;  In such a case, the question arises of who should be the target population that receives benefits from social programs.

===Targeting income vs. capabilities===
Net income is the simplest method of determining a needy population.  Some states use a [[Guaranteed Minimum Income]] system, in which all members of a state receive sufficient income to live on, so long as they meet certain conditions.&lt;ref&gt;“History of Basic Income”.  Basic Income Earth Network. http://www.basicincome.org/bien/aboutbasicincome.html#history {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621140909/http://www.basicincome.org/bien/aboutbasicincome.html |date=2008-06-21 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, proponents of the [[capabilities approach]] argue that income is easier to misrepresent, and moreover, fails to target the root causal factors of poverty.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; Hence, they recommend targeting a minimum level of basic capabilities that will impact [[quality of life]], such as institutional improvements like health and education. Policy examples might include a [[social floor]].&lt;ref&gt;ILO Social Protection Floors Recommendation No. 202 (2012) [http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO::P12100_INSTRUMENT_ID:3065524 ILO Recommendation No. 202]&lt;/ref&gt;

Social protection is an expensive and difficult endeavor, by any means; the question remains how best to implement programs that effectively aid the people who need it the most.  Currently, there are a number of mechanisms that provide social protection in various nations. These policies and instruments vary according to country context. In some nations, governments are strongly involved in the provision of social protection, following a [[developmentalism]] model, in which social protection is seen as a tool to promote economic growth.  There are also nations which are characterized by dualism, in which there is state-provided protection for those who work in the formal sector, but little to no protection for those who work in the [[informal sector]].  Finally, there are nations in which the economy is largely agrarian, and a great majority of the population works in the informal economy.  In those countries that have only residual social protection coverage and weak state capacity,social protection is mainly provided by non-governmental means such as kin, [[NGO]]s, and individual philanthropic donations.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==National programs==

===Developmentalism===
In [[South Korea]] and [[Taiwan]], the government provides extensive support for public programs, following the [[developmentalism]] model, in which social protection is seen as a tool to promote economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;Kwon, Huck-Ju. 2009. “The reform of the developmental welfare state in East Asia”. International Journal of Social Welfare.  Volume 18, pages S12–S21, April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dualism===
In [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], and [[South Africa]], there is a dualist structure of protected formal sector workers and marginalized informal sector workers.,&lt;ref&gt;Lo Vuolo, Barbeito. 1998. Models of stratification via pension policy. The case of Argentina. LASA Conference, Nov. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ocampo, José Antonio. 2008. “The Latin American Economic Boom”Revista de Ciencia Política, Volume 28&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agrarian-Informal===
In nations such as [[India]] and [[Tanzania]], governments struggle to provide adequate social protection, and citizens must instead depend on non-state actors and informal provisioning.

==Donor approaches==
International donors and organizations have influenced social protection approaches both at the level of policy discourse and program design and implementation.&lt;ref&gt;See Brunori and O'Reilly (2011) for a review(http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/29495/)&lt;/ref&gt;  Even though The World Bank and International Labour Organization (ILO) are the major donors and the lead organizations in the field, other organizations are also concerned with social protection.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, S. and Kabeer, N., 2009, ‘Socio-economic Security over the Life Course: A Global Review of Social Protection’, Institute of Development Studies, Brighton(http://www.ids.ac.uk/publication/a-global-review-of-social-protection)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The World Bank]] is a source of financial and technical assistance for developing countries. In order to identify social risks and potential responses, The World Bank developed a tool called “[[Social Risk Management]]” (SRM).  The SRM framework includes interventions that focus on managing risks before shocks occur.  It is based on two assessments: (1) the poor are most exposed to diverse risks, and (2) the poor have the fewest tools to deal with these risks.  The main elements of the SRM framework are:
*''Risk reduction'' measures that focus on reducing risks in the labor market.
*''Risk mitigation'' measures to deal with anticipated shock.
*''Risk coping'' mechanisms to relieve the impact of risk after its occurred.&lt;ref&gt;The World Bank. Social Protection. [Date accessed October 31, 2010] (http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTSOCIALPROTECTION/EXTLM/0,,contentMDK:20223809~menuPK:7109967~pagePK:148956~piPK:216618~theSitePK:390615,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) brings 30 democratic countries together to seek answers to common problems and coordinate domestic and international policies.  The [[Development Assistance Committee]] (DAC) of the OECD is responsible for the Poverty Network (POVNET) that has become very influential on policy development.  The DAC-POVNET focuses on the following areas:
*Poverty reduction
*[http://www.oecd.org/document/1/0,3746,en_2649_34621_36573761_1_1_1_1,00.html Pro-poor growth]
*People centered development

The [[International Labour Organization]], which covers both issues of social security and labor protection, has been the [[United Nations]] agency responsible for setting norms and standards at work.  Currently the ILO focuses, amongst others, on the following strategies: 
*Extending social protection to all
*Promoting decent working conditions
*Providing programs for informal and migrant workers &lt;ref&gt;Cook, S. and Kabeer, N., 2009, ‘Socio-economic Security over the Life Course: A Global Review of Social Protection’, Institute of Development Studies, Brighton&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Anemone Fish Eggs.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The spawn (eggs) of a [[clownfish]]. The black spots are the developing eyes.]]

'''Spawn''' is the [[egg (biology)|eggs]] and [[Spermatozoa|sperm]] released or deposited into water by [[aquatic animal]]s. As a verb, ''to spawn'' refers to the process of releasing the eggs and sperm, and the act of both sexes is called '''spawning'''. Most aquatic animals, except for [[aquatic mammal]]s and [[marine reptile | reptile]]s, reproduce through the process of spawning.

Spawn consists of the reproductive cells ([[gamete]]s) of many aquatic animals, some of which will become [[fertilize]]d and produce offspring. The process of spawning typically involves females releasing [[Ovum|ova]] (unfertilized eggs) into the water, often in large quantities, while males simultaneously or sequentially release [[spermatozoa]] ([[milt]]) to fertilize the eggs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fishbase.org/Glossary/Glossary.php?q=spawn&amp;sc=is Spawn] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129110357/http://www.fishbase.org/Glossary/Glossary.php?q=spawn&amp;sc=is |date=2014-11-29 }} Fishbase Glossary.

Retrieved 3 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most fish reproduce by spawning, as do most other aquatic animals, including [[crustacean]]s such as crabs and shrimps, [[mollusc]]s such as oysters and squid, [[echinoderm]]s such as sea urchins and sea cucumbers, [[amphibian]]s such as frogs and newts, [[aquatic insect]]s such as mayflies and mosquitoes and [[coral]]s, which are actually small aquatic animals—not plants. [[Fungi]], such as mushrooms, are also said to "spawn" a white, fibrous matter that forms the matrix from which they grow.{{citation needed|reason=Some of the statements above need accurate sources. Reptiles (e.g., turtles) actually reproduce sexually|date=January 2016}}

There are many variations in the way spawning occurs, depending on sexual differences in anatomy, how the sexes relate to each other, where and how the spawn is released and whether or how the spawn is subsequently guarded.

==Overview==
[[File:Oncorhynchus nerka 2.jpg|thumb|[[Oncorhynchus|Pacific salmon]] are [[semelparous]] or "big bang" spawners, which means they die shortly after spawning]]
[[File:Mullet roe by comicpie in Taiwan.jpg|thumb|right|The pickled and dehydrated [[roe]] of [[mullet (fish)|mullet]]]]

Marine animals, and particularly [[bony fish]], commonly reproduce by ''broadcast spawning''. This is an external method of reproduction where the female releases many unfertilised eggs into the water. At the same time, a male or many males release a lot of sperm into the water which fertilises some of these eggs. The eggs contain a drop of nutrient oil to sustain the  embryo as it develops inside the egg case. The oil also provides buoyancy, so the eggs float and drift with the current. The strategy for survival of broadcast spawning is to disperse the fertilised eggs, preferably away from the coast into the relative safety of the open ocean.  There the [[larvae]] develop as they consume their fat stores, and eventually hatch from the egg capsule into miniature versions of their parents.
To survive, they must then become miniature predators themselves, feeding on plankton. Fish eventually encounter others of their own kind ([[conspecific]]s), where they form aggregations and learn to school.

Internally, the sexes of most marine animals can be determined by looking at the [[gonad]]s. For example, male [[testes]] of spawning fish are smooth and white and account for up to 12% of the mass of the fish, while female [[ovary|ovaries]] are granular and orange or yellow, accounting for up to 70% of the fish's mass. Male lampreys, hagfish and salmon discharge their sperm into the body cavity where it is expelled through pores in the abdomen. Male [[shark]]s and [[Batoidea|rays]] can pass sperm along a duct into a [[seminal vesicle]], where they store it for a while before it is expelled, while [[teleost]]s usually employ separate sperm ducts.&lt;ref name="Moyle&amp;Cech"&gt;Moyle PB and Cech JJ (2004) ''Fishes, An Introduction to Ichthyology.'' 5th Ed, Benjamin Cummings. {{ISBN|978-0-13-100847-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|141}}

Externally, many marine animals, even when spawning, show little [[sexual dimorphism]] (difference in body shape or size) or little difference in [[Animal colouration|colouration]]. Where species are dimorphic, such as sharks or [[guppy|guppies]], the males often have penis-like [[intromittent organ]]s in the form of a modified fin.&lt;ref name="Moyle&amp;Cech" /&gt;{{Rp|141}}

A species is [[semelparous]] if its individuals spawn only once in their lifetime, and [[iteroparous]] if its individuals spawn more than once. The term semelparity comes from the [[Latin]] ''semel'', once, and ''pario'', to beget, while iteroparity comes from ''itero'', to repeat, and ''pario'', to beget.

Semelparity is sometimes called "big bang" reproduction, since the single reproductive event of semelparous organisms is usually large and fatal to the spawners.&lt;ref&gt;Robert E. Ricklefs and Gary Leon Miller (1999). ''Ecology.'' Macmillan {{ISBN|0-7167-2829-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The classic example of a semelparous animal is the [[Pacific salmon]],which lives for many years in the ocean before swimming to the freshwater stream of its birth, spawning, and then dying. Other spawning animals which are semelparous include [[mayfly|mayflies]], [[squid]], [[octopus]], [[smelts|smelt]], [[capelin]] and some amphibians.&lt;ref name="Leiner"&gt;{{Cite journal

When the internal [[Ovary|ovaries]] or egg masses of fish and certain marine animals are ripe for spawning they are called [[roe]]. Roe from certain species, such as [[shrimp]], [[scallop]], [[crab]] and [[sea urchin]]s, are sought as human delicacies in many parts of the world. ''[[Caviar]]'' is a name for the processed, salted roe of non-fertilized [[sturgeon]]. The term ''soft roe'' or ''white roe'' denotes [[milt|fish milt]]. Lobster roe is called ''coral'' because it turns bright red when cooked. Roe (reproductive organs) are usually eaten either raw or briefly cooked.

"The reproductive behaviour of fishes is remarkably diversified: they may be oviparous (lay eggs), ovoviparous (retain the eggs in the body until they hatch), or viviparous (have a direct tissue connection with the developing embryos and give birth to live young). All cartilaginous fishes—the elasmobranches (e.g., sharks, rays, and skates)—employ internal fertilization and usually lay large, heavy-shelled eggs or give birth to live young. The most characteristic features of the more primitive bony fishes is the assemblage of polyandrous (many males) breeding aggregations in open water and the absence of parental care..."&lt;ref&gt;"spawning." Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica, 2011. Web. 03 Feb. 2011. &lt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/558450/spawning |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102183243/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/558450/spawning |archivedate=2012-11-02 |df= }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two main reproduction methods in fish. The first method is by laying eggs and the second by ''live-bearing'' (producing their young alive).

* In the first method, the female fish lays eggs either on the sea floor or on the leaves of an aquatic plant. A male fish fertilizes the eggs, and both then work together to protect the eggs/babies from danger until they can defend themselves.
* In the second method, the male fish uses its anal fin to transmit sperm into the female fish and fertilize the fish eggs. Later, the female gives live birth to her fry.

[[Monogamous pairing in animals|Monogamy]] occurs when one male mates with one female exclusively. This is also called ''pair spawning''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fishbase.org/Glossary/Glossary.php?q=pair+spawning&amp;language=english&amp;sc=is Pair spawning] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130621181023/http://fishbase.org/Glossary/Glossary.php?q=pair+spawning&amp;language=english&amp;sc=is |date=2013-06-21 }} Fishbase Glossary. Retrieved 3 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Most fish are not monogamous, and when they are, they often alternate with non-monogamous behaviours. Monogamy can occur when feeding and breeding grounds are small, when it is difficult for fish to find partners, or when both sexes look after the young.&lt;ref name="Berglund1997" /&gt; Many tropical [[cichlid]]s, which rear their young together in locations where they must fiercely defend against competitors and predators are monogamous.&lt;ref name="Barlow2000"&gt;Barlow GW (2000) [https://books.google.com/books?id=pVQWAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Barlow+2000+%27%27The+cichlid+fishes%22+monogamous&amp;dq=Barlow+2000+%27%27The+cichlid+fishes%22+monogamous&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=-KlUTcKEIsKdcd_MhKcF&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA ''The cichlid fishes: Nature's grand experiment in evolution''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180502161516/https://books.google.com/books?id=pVQWAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Barlow+2000+%27%27The+cichlid+fishes%22+monogamous&amp;dq=Barlow+2000+%27%27The+cichlid+fishes%22+monogamous&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=-KlUTcKEIsKdcd_MhKcF&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA |date=2018-05-02 }} Perseus Publishing, {{ISBN|0-7382-0528-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "In some [[pipefish]]es and [[seahorse]]s, development of eggs takes a long time before the female can place them in the brood pouch of a male, where they are fertilized. While the male is pregnant, the female starts a new batch of eggs, which are ready at about the same time that the male gives birth to the young from the previous mating. This close timing of development promotes monogamy, especially if the likelihood of encountering another potential mate is low."&lt;ref name="Berglund1997" /&gt;

[[Polygyny threshold model|Polygyny]] occurs when one male gets exclusive mating rights with multiple females. In polygyny a large conspicuous male usually defends females from other males or defends a breeding site.&lt;ref name="Berglund1997" /&gt; The females choose large males that are successfully defending prime breeding sites which the females find attractive. For example, [[sculpin]] males defend "caves" underneath rocks which are suitable for the incubation of embryos.

Another way males get to mate with several females is through the use of leks. [[Lek (biology)|Leks]] are places where many fish come together, and the males display to each another. Based on these displays, each female then selects the male they want to be their mate. For example, among the cichlid ''Cyrtocara eucinostomus'' in [[Lake Malawi]], up to 50,000 large and colourful males display together on a lek four kilometres long. The females, which are mouth brooders, choose which male they want to fertilize their eggs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = McKaye  | year = 1983 | title = Ecology and breeding behavior of a cichilid fish, ''Cyrtocara eucinostomus'', on a large lek in Lake Malawi, Africa | url = | journal = Environ. Biol. Fish. | volume = 8 | issue = 2| pages = 81–96 | doi = 10.1007/BF00005175 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Polyandry#Animal polyandry|Polyandry]] occurs when one female gets exclusive mating rights with multiple males. This happens among fish like [[clownfish]] that change their sex. It can also happen when males do the brooding but can cannot handle all the eggs the female produce, such as with some [[pipefish]].&lt;ref name="Moyle&amp;Cech" /&gt;{{Rp|161}}

The males in some deep sea [[anglerfish]]es are much smaller than the females. When they find a female they bite into her skin, releasing an [[enzyme]] that digests the skin of their mouth and her body and fusing the pair down to the blood-vessel level. The male then slowly [[atrophy|atrophies]], losing first his digestive organs, then his brain, heart, and eyes, ending as nothing more than a pair of [[gonads]], which release [[Spermatozoon|sperm]] in response to [[hormones]] in the female's bloodstream indicating [[ovum|egg]] release. This ensures that, when the female is ready to spawn, she has a mate immediately available.&lt;ref name="doran"&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v256/n5512/abs/256038a0.html | author = Theodore W.

[[Polygynandry]] occurs when multiple males mate indiscriminately with multiple females. This mutual promiscuity is the approach most commonly used by spawning animals, and is perhaps the "original fish mating system."&lt;ref name="Moyle&amp;Cech" /&gt;{{Rp|161}} Common examples are [[forage fish]], such as [[herring]]s, which form huge mating [[Shoaling and schooling|shoals]] in shallow water. The water becomes milky with sperm and the bottom is draped with millions of fertilized eggs.&lt;ref name="Moyle&amp;Cech" /&gt;{{Rp|161}}

===Cuckoldry===

Alternate male strategies which allow small males to engage in [[cuckoldry]] can develop in species where spawning is dominated by large and aggressive males. Cuckoldry is a variant of polyandry, and can occur with ''sneak spawners'' (sometimes called ''streak spawners''). A sneak spawner is a male that rushes in to join the spawning rush of a spawning pair.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fishbase.org/Glossary/Glossary.php?q=streak+spawning&amp;language=english&amp;sc=is Streak spawning] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210190505/http://www.fishbase.org/Glossary/Glossary.php?q=streak+spawning&amp;language=english&amp;sc=is |date=2015-02-10 }} Fishbase Glossary. Retrieved 11 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; A spawning rush occurs when a fish makes a burst of speed, usually on a near vertical incline, releasing gametes at the apex, followed by a rapid return to the lake or sea floor or fish aggregation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fishbase.org/Glossary/Glossary.php?q=spawning+rush&amp;language=english&amp;sc=is Spawning rush] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210190502/http://www.fishbase.org/Glossary/Glossary.php?q=spawning+rush&amp;language=english&amp;sc=is |date=2015-02-10 }} Fishbase Glossary. Retrieved 11 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Sneaking males do not take part in courtship. In salmon and trout, for example, ''jack males'' are common. These are small silvery males that migrate upstream along with the standard, large, hook-nosed males and that spawn by sneaking into a [[Salmon run|redd]] (spawning nest) to release sperm simultaneously with a mated pair. This behaviour is an [[evolutionarily stable strategy]] for reproduction, because it is favoured by natural selection just like the "standard" strategy of large males.&lt;ref&gt;Gross MR (1984) "[http://labs.eeb.utoronto.ca/gross/Gross1984a.pdf Sunfish, salmon, and the evolution of alternative reproductive strategies and tactics in fishes]". Pages 55–75 in GW Potts and RJ Wottoon, eds. ''Fish reproduction: Strategies and tactics''. Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cuckoldry occurs in many fish species, including [[dragonets]], [[parrotfish]]es and [[wrass]]es on tropical reefs and the [[bluegill]] sunfish in fresh water. Sneaker males that become too large to hide effectively become ''satellite males''. With bluegill sunfish, satellite males mimic the behaviour and colouration of the females. They hover over a nest containing a pair of courting sunfish, and gradually descend to reach the pair just as they spawn. Males may need to be 6 or 7 years old to function capably as parental males, but may be able to function as sneaker or satellite males when they are as young as 2 or 3 years old. The smaller satellite and sneaker males may get mauled by the more powerful parental males, but they spawn when they are younger and they do not put energy into parental care.&lt;ref name="Moyle&amp;Cech" /&gt;{{Rp|161–2}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gross MR | year = 1982 | title = Sneakers, satellites and parentals: Polymorphic mating strategies in North American sunfishes | url = | journal = Z.

===Hermaphroditism===
[[Hermaphroditism]] occurs when a given individual in a species possesses both male and female reproductive organs, or can alternate between possessing first one, and then the other. Hermaphroditism is common in invertebrates but rare in vertebrates. It can be contrasted with [[gonochorism]], where each individual in a species is either male or female, and remains that way throughout their lives. Most fish are gonochorists, but hermaphroditism is known to occur in 14 families of [[teleost]] fishes.&lt;ref name="Shapiro1984"&gt;Shapiro DY (1984) "Sex reversal and sociodemographics processes in coral reef fishes" Pages 103–116 in GW Potts and RK Wootoon, eds., ''Fish reproduction: Strategies and tactics'', Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually hermaphrodites are ''[[Sequential hermaphroditism|sequential]]'', meaning they can [[Sex change|switch sex]], usually from female to male ([[protogyny]]).

Less commonly hermaphrodites can be ''synchronous'', meaning they simultaneously possess both ovaries and testicles and can function as either sex at any one time.

Because such egg trading is advantageous to both individuals, hamlets are typically monogamous for short periods of time–an unusual situation in fishes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fischer EA, Peterson CW | year = 1987 | title = The evolution of sexuality in the seabasses | url = | journal = BioScience | volume = 37 | issue = 7| pages = 482–489 | doi = 10.2307/1310420 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sex of many fishes is not fixed, but can change with physical and social changes to the environment where the fish lives.&lt;ref&gt;Chan STH and Yeung WSB (1983) "Sex control and sex reversal in fish under natural conditions".

===Unisexuality===
[[Unisexuality]] occurs when a species is all-male or all-female. Unisexuality occurs in some fish species, and can take complex forms. ''[[Squalius alburnoides]]'', a minnow found in several river basins in Portugal and Spain, appears to be an all-male species. The existence of this species illustrates the potential complexity of mating systems in fish. The species originated as a hybrid between two species, and is [[diploid]], but not hermaphroditic. It can have [[triploid]] and [[tetraploid]] forms, including all-female forms that reproduce mainly through [[hybridogenesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Alves MJ, Collarea-Pereira MJ, Dowling TE, Coelho MM | year = 2002 | title = The genetics of maintenance of an all-male lineage in the ''Squalius alburnoides'' complex | url = | journal = J.

==Spawning strategies==
This section is patterned after a classification of the spawning behaviours of fish by Balon (1975, 1984) into reproductive [[Guild (ecology)|guilds]]. This classification is based on how the eggs are fertilized (internal or external spawners), where the eggs are deposited ([[pelagic]] or [[benthic]] spawners), and whether and how the parents look after the eggs after spawning (bearers, guarders and nonguarders).&lt;ref name="Balon"&gt;Adapted from

Open substrate spawners scatter their eggs in the environment. They usually spawn in [[Shoaling and schooling|shoals]] without complex courtship rituals, and males outnumber females.

'''Broadcast spawners''': release their gametes (sperm and eggs) into open water for external fertilisation. There is no subsequent parental care.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fishbase.org/glossary/Glossary.php?q=broadcast%20spawners Broadcast spawners] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925084237/http://www.fishbase.org/glossary/Glossary.php?q=broadcast%20spawners |date=2015-09-25 }} Fishbase Glossary. Retrieved 3 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; About 75% of coral species are broadcasters, the majority of which are hermatypic, or reef-building corals.&lt;ref name="Veron" /&gt;
* '''Pelagic spawners''': a type of broadcast spawners, spawn in the open sea, mostly near the surface. They are usually [[pelagic fish]] such as [[tuna]] and [[sardine]]s. Some [[demersal fish]] leave the bottom to spawn pelagically, particularly [[coral reef fish]] such as [[parrotfish]] and [[wrass]]es. Pelagic spawning means water currents widely disperse the young. The eggs, embryos and larvae of pelagic spawners contain oil globules or have a high water content. As a result, they are buoyant and are widely dispersed by currents. The downside is that [[Fish mortality|mortality]] is high, because they can be eaten so easily by pelagic predators or they can drift into unsuitable areas. Females compensate by spawning large numbers of eggs and extending their spawning periods. Pelagic spawners that live in or around [[coral reef]]s can spawn a small number of eggs almost daily over a period of months. These fishes have complex breeding behaviours including [[sex change]]s, [[Harem (zoology)|harems]], [[Lek (biology)|leks]] and [[territoriality]].&lt;ref name="Moyle&amp;Cech" /&gt;{{rp|143}} ''See also:'' [[Coral reef fish]]''.
* '''Benthic spawners''': deposit their spawn on or near the bottom of the sea (or lake). They are usually [[demersal fish]] such as [[cod]] and [[flatfish]]. These species typically spawn without ceremony; they do not engage in elaborate courtship rituals. Each female is usually followed by several males who fertilize the eggs as they are released. Various strategies ensure the eggs and embryos remain in place, and do not drift with the current. The eggs can adhere to other eggs or to whatever they are deposited on, or the eggs can be laid in long strings which are wrapped around plants or rocks. Some eggs take on water after they are released, so they can be dropped into cracks where they swell and wedge themselves in place.
** Egg scatterers: scatter adhesive or non-adhesive eggs to fall to the substrate, into plants, or float to the surface. These species do not look after their brood and even eat their own eggs. These are often [[Shoaling and schooling|schooling fish]] which spawn in groups or pairs, often laying a large number of small eggs. The fry hatch quickly.
** Egg depositers: deposit eggs on a substrate (tank glass, wood, rocks, plants). Egg depositors usually lay fewer eggs than egg-scatterers, although the eggs are larger. Egg depositors fall into two groups: those that care for their eggs, and those that do not. Among egg depositors that care for their eggs are [[cichlid]]s and some catfish. Egg depositors that care for their young can be divided into two groups: cavity spawners and open spawners.
** Cavity spawners: lay eggs in a cave or cavity. These fish form pairs and have advanced brood care where the eggs are defended and cleaned. The eggs take a few days to hatch, and the fry are often guarded by the parents. Various [[catfish]], [[Cyprinidae]], and [[killifish]] make up the majority. Cavity spawners can be contrasted with open (shelter) spawners, which lay their eggs on an open surface.

====Brood hiders====
Brood hiders hide their eggs but do not give parental care after they have hidden them. Brood hiders are mostly benthic spawners that bury the fertilized eggs. For example, among salmon and trout the female digs a nest with her tail in gravel.  These nests are called '''redds'''. The female then lays her eggs while the male fertilizes them, while both fish defend the redd if necessary from other members of the same species. Then the female buries the nest, and the nest site is abandoned. In North America, some [[minnow]]s build nests out of piles of stones rather than dig holes. The minnow males have [[tubercle]]s on their head and body which they use to help them defend the nest site.&lt;ref name="Moyle&amp;Cech" /&gt;{{rp|145}}

* Egg buriers - can inhabit waters that dry up at some time of the year. An example are annual [[killifish]] which lay their eggs in mud. The parents mature quickly and lay their eggs before dying when the water dries up. The eggs remain in a dormant stage until rains stimulate hatching.

[[Bitterling]]s have a remarkable reproduction strategy where parents transfer responsibility for the care of their young to [[mussel]]s. The female extends her [[ovipositor]] into the [[mantle cavity]] of the mussel and deposits her eggs between the gill filaments. The male then ejects his sperm into the mussel's inhalant water current and fertilization takes place within the gills of the host. The same female may use a number of mussels, and she deposits only one or two yellow, oval eggs into each. Early developmental stages are protected from predation within the body of the mussel. After 3 to 4 weeks larvae swim away from the host to continue life on their own.

Guarders protect their eggs and offspring after spawning by practicing ''parental care'' (also called ''brood care''). Parental care is an "investment by parents in offspring that increases the offsprings' chances of surviving (and hence reproducing). In fish, parental care can take a variety of forms including guarding, nest building, fanning, splashing, removal of dead eggs, retrieval of straying fry, external egg carrying, egg burying, moving eggs or young, ectodermal feeding, oral brooding, internal gestation, brood-pouch egg carrying, etc."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fishbase.org/Glossary/Glossary.php?q=parental+care&amp;sc=is Parental care] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160125142508/http://www.fishbase.org/Glossary/Glossary.php?q=parental+care&amp;sc=is |date=2016-01-25 }} Fishbase Glossary. Retrieved 3 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Territoriality|Territorial behaviour]] is generally necessary for guarders, and the embryos are almost always guarded by males (apart from cichlids). There is a need to be territorial because looking after embryos usually includes defending the site where they are being looked after. It also often means there is competition for the best egg-laying sites. Elaborate courtship behaviour is usual among guarders.&lt;ref name="Moyle&amp;Cech" /&gt;{{Rp|145}}

Guarding males keep the embryos safe from predators, keep oxygen levels high by fanning water currents, and keep the area free from dead embryos and debris. They protect the embryos until they hatch, and often look after the larval stages as well. The time spent guarding can range from a few days to several months.&lt;ref name="Moyle&amp;Cech" /&gt;{{Rp|145}}

====Substrate spawners====
Some guarders build nests (''nest spawners'') and some do not (''substrate spawners''), though the difference between the two groups can be small.&lt;ref name="Moyle&amp;Cech" /&gt;{{Rp|142}} Substrate spawners clean off a suitable area of surface suitable for egg laying, and look after the area, but they do not actively build a nest.

Bearers are fish that carry their embryos (and sometimes their young) around with them, either externally or internally.

====External bearers====
[[Mouthbrooder|Mouth brooders]] - carry eggs or larvae in their mouth. Mouth brooders can be [[ovophile]]s or larvophiles. Ovophile or egg-loving mouth-brooders lay their eggs in a pit, which are sucked up into the mouth of the female. The small number of large eggs hatch in the mother's mouth, and the fry remain there for a period of time. Fertilization often occurs with the help of egg-spots, which are colorful spots on the anal fin of the male. When the female sees these spots, she tries to pick up the egg-spots, but instead gets sperm that fertilizes the eggs in her mouth. Many cichlids and some labyrinth fish are ovophile mouthbrooders. Larvophile or larvae-loving mouth-brooders lay their eggs on a substrate and guard them until the eggs hatch. After hatching, the female picks up the fry and keeps them in her mouth. When the fry can fend for themselves, they are released. Some [[eartheater]]s are larvophile mouthbrooders.

====Internal bearers====

=====Facultative internal bearers=====
The beginning of the evolutionary process of livebearing starts with ''[[facultative]]'' (optional) internal bearing. The process occurs in several species of [[oviparous]] (egg-laying) [[killifish]]es which spawn in the normal way on the substrate, but in the process accidentally fertilize eggs which the female retains and does not spawn. These eggs are spawned later, usually without allowing much time for embryonic development.&lt;ref name="Moyle&amp;Cech" /&gt;{{Rp|147}}

* Livebearers
[[File:Pregnant guppy.JPG|thumb|220px|[[Guppy|Guppies]] are [[livebearers]]. This one has been pregnant for about 26 days.]]
}}

=====Obligate internal bearers=====
The next step in the evolution of livebearing is ''[[obligate]]'' (by necessity) internal bearing, where  the female retains all the embryos. "The only source of nutrition for these embryos, however, is the egg yolk, as in externally spawned eggs. This situation, also referred to as [[ovoviviparity]], is characteristic of [[Scorpaenidae|marine rock fishes]] and the Lake Baikal [[sculpin]]s. This strategy allows these fish to have fecundities approaching those of pelagic fish with external fertilization, but it also enables them to protect the young during their most vulnerable stage of development. By contrast, sharks and rays using this strategy produce a relatively small number of embryos and retain them for a few weeks to 16 months or longer. The shorter times spans are characteristic of species that eventually deposit their embryos in the environment, surrounded by a horny capsule; whereas the longer periods are characteristic of sharks that retain the embryos until they are ready to emerge as actively swimming young."&lt;ref name="Moyle&amp;Cech" /&gt;{{Rp|147}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wourms JP | year = 1981 | title = Viviparity: The Maternal-Fetal Relationship in Fishes | url = http://icb.oxfordjournals.org/content/21/2/473.abstract | journal = Integrative and Comparative Biology | volume = 21 | issue = 2 | pages = 473–515 | doi = 10.1093/icb/21.2.473 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120608045523/http://icb.oxfordjournals.org/content/21/2/473.abstract | archivedate = 2012-06-08 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Viviparous fish=====

However, some fish do not fit these categories. The livebearing largespring [[gambusia]] (''Gambusia geiseri'') was thought to be [[ovoviviparous]] until it was shown in 2001 that the embryos received nutrients from the mother.&lt;ref&gt;Marsh-Matthews E, Skierkowski P and DeMarais A (2001) [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1448091 "Direct Evidence for Mother-to-Embryo Transfer of Nutrients in the Livebearing Fish Gambusia geiseri"] ''Copeia'', '''2001''': 1(1-6).&lt;/ref&gt;

Spawning grounds are the areas of water where aquatic animals spawn, or produce their eggs. After spawning, the spawn may or may not drift to new grounds which become their nursery grounds. Many species undertake [[Fish migration|migrations]] each year, and sometimes great migrations, to reach their spawning grounds. For example, lakes and river watersheds can be major spawning grounds for [[anadromous]] fish such as [[salmon]]. These days, it is often necessary to construct [[fish ladder]]s and other bypass systems so salmon can navigate their way past hydroelectric dams or other obstructions such as weirs on their way to spawning grounds.&lt;ref&gt;Office Of Technology Assessment Washington DC (1995) [https://books.google.com/books?id=ctBsJJ0oKHEC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=%22Fish+passage+technologies%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=WPVWTaHnGtOdcZb1oe8M&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Fish passage technologies : protection at hydropower facilities''] Diana Publishing, {{ISBN|1-4289-2016-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nwp.usace.army.mil/pa/docs/pubs/salmon.pdf ''To Save the Salmon''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110518112904/https://www.nwp.usace.army.mil/pa/docs/pubs/salmon.pdf |date=2011-05-18 }} (1997) US Army Corps of Engineers.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Coastal fish]] often use [[mangrove]]s and [[estuaries]] as spawning grounds, while [[reef fish]] can find adjacent [[seagrass meadow]]s that make good spawning grounds. [[Short-finned eel]]s can travel anything up to three or four thousand kilometres to their spawning ground in deep water somewhere in the [[Coral Sea]].

[[Forage fish]] often make great migrations between their spawning, feeding and nursery grounds. Schools of a particular stock usually travel in a triangle between these grounds. For example, one stock of herrings have their spawning ground in southern [[Norway]],  their feeding ground in [[Iceland]], and their nursery ground in northern Norway. Wide triangular journeys such as these may be important because forage fish, when feeding, cannot distinguish their own offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dragesund O, Johannessen A, Ulltang Ø | year = 1997 | title = Variation in migration and abundance of Norwegian spring spawning herring ''(Clupea harengus L.)'' | url = http://www.vliz.be/imisdocs/publications/31859.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Sarsia | volume = 82 | issue =  | pages = 97–105 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110928101719/http://www.vliz.be/imisdocs/publications/31859.pdf | archivedate = 2011-09-28 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Capelin]] are a forage fish of the [[Smelt (fish)|smelt]] family found in the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Arctic Ocean|Arctic]] oceans. In summer, they graze on dense swarms of [[plankton]] at the edge of the ice shelf. Larger capelin also eat [[krill]] and other [[crustacean]]s. The capelin move inshore in large schools to spawn and migrate in spring and summer to feed in plankton rich areas between [[Iceland]], [[Greenland]], and [[Jan Mayen]]. The migration is affected by [[ocean current]]s. Around Iceland maturing capelin make large northward feeding migrations in spring and summer. The return migration takes place in September to November. The spawning migration starts north of Iceland in December or January.&lt;ref name="Vilhjalmsson"&gt;Vilhjalmsson H (2002) [http://icesjms.oxfordjournals.org/content/59/5/870.short "Capelin ''(Mallotus villosus)'' in the Iceland–East Greenland–Jan Mayen ecosystem"] ICES ''Journal of Marine Science'', '''59''': 870–883. {{doi|10.1006/jmsc.2002.1233}} available online.&lt;/ref&gt;

Referred to as "the greatest [[Shoaling and schooling|shoal]] on earth", the [[sardine run]] occurs when millions of [[sardine]]s migrate from their spawning grounds south of the southern tip of Africa northward along the Eastern Cape coastline. [[Chinook salmon]] make the longest freshwater migration of any salmon, over {{convert|3000|km}} up the [[Yukon River]] to spawning grounds upstream of [[Whitehorse, Yukon|Whitehorse]], Yukon. Some [[green sea turtle]]s swim more than {{convert|2600|km}} to reach their spawning grounds.

==Examples==

===Fish===
[[File:Frai de poissons rouges anim.gif|thumb|right|Female [[goldfish]] spawn (discharge) eggs into the water, encouraged by male goldfish who simultaneously discharge sperm which externally fertilizes the eggs]]
[[File:Goldfishfry.JPG|thumb|right|Within two or three days, the vulnerable goldfish eggs hatch into [[larva]]e, and rapidly develop into fry]]

====Goldfish====
[[Goldfish]], like all [[cyprinid]]s, are egg-layers. They usually start breeding after a significant temperature change, often in spring. Males chase females, prompting them to release their eggs by bumping and nudging them. As the female goldfish spawns her eggs, the male goldfish stays close behind fertilizing them. Their eggs are adhesive and attach to aquatic vegetation. The eggs hatch within 48 to 72 hours. Within a week or so, the fry begins to assume its final shape, although a year may pass before they develop a mature goldfish colour; until then they are a metallic brown like their wild ancestors. In their first weeks of life, the fry grow quickly—an adaptation born of the high risk of getting devoured by the adult goldfish.

====Carp====

A member of the Cyprinidae, carp spawn in times between April and August, largely dependent upon the climate and conditions they live in. Oxygen levels of the water, availability of food, size of each fish, age, number of times the fish has spawned before and water temperature are all factors known to effect when and how many eggs each carp will spawn at any one time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.carp.me.uk {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110321205019/http://www.carp.me.uk/ |date=2011-03-21 }} Carp Spawning Information&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Siamese fighting fish=====
Prior to spawning, male [[Siamese fighting fish]] build [[bubble nest]]s of varying sizes at the surface of the water. When a male becomes interested in a female, he will flare his gills, twist his body, and spread his fins. The female darkens in colour and curves her body back and forth. The act of spawning takes place in a "nuptial embrace" where the male wraps his body around the female, each embrace resulting in the release of 10-40 eggs until the female is out of eggs. The male, from his side, releases [[milt]] into the water and fertilization takes place externally. During and after spawning, the male uses his mouth to retrieve sinking eggs and deposit them in the bubble nest (during mating the female sometimes assists her partner, but more often she will simply devour all the eggs that she manages to catch). Once the female has released all of her eggs, she is chased away from the male's territory, as it is likely that she'll eat the eggs due to hunger.&lt;ref&gt;Leong, Paul (2004). {{cite web|url=http://www.cbsbettas.org/doc/articles/Tips_on_Spawning_Bettas.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302133251/http://www.cbsbettas.org/doc/articles/Tips_on_Spawning_Bettas.htm |archivedate=2009-03-02 |df= }}. Retrieved on March 13, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The eggs then remain in the male's care. He keeps them in the bubble nest, making sure none fall to the bottom and repairing the nest as needed. Incubation lasts for 24–36 hours, and the newly hatched larvae remain in the nest for the next 2–3 days, until their yolk sacs are fully absorbed. Afterwards the fry leave the nest and the free-swimming stage begins.&lt;ref&gt;Rainwate FL and Miller EJ (1967) [http://digital.library.okstate.edu/oas/oas_pdf/v47/p98_114.pdf "Courtship and reproductive behavior of the Siamese fighting fish, ''Betta splendens Regan''"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513081057/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/oas/oas_pdf/v47/p98_114.pdf |date=2013-05-13 }} ''Proceedings of the Oklahoma  Academy of Science'', Oklahoma State University.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Copepods====
[[Copepod]]s are tiny [[crustacean]]s which usually reproduce either by ''broadcast spawning'' or by ''sac spawning''. Broadcasting copepods scatter their eggs into the water, but sac spawners lay their eggs into an ovigerous sac. Sac spawners spawn few but relatively large eggs that develop slowly. By contrast, broadcast spawners spawn numerous small eggs that develop rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;Miller CB (2004) [https://books.google.com/books?id=7etkpSJuWoMC&amp;pg=PA160&amp;dq=%22sac+spawner%22|%22sac+spawners%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=0MNVTebJNYa3cOXGiIQN&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFUQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22sac%20spawner%22|%22sac%20spawners%22&amp;f=false ''Biological oceanography''] Wiley-Blackwell, {{ISBN|0-632-05536-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the shorter hatch times that result from broadcasting are not short enough to compensate for the higher mortality compared to sac spawners. To produce a given number of hatched eggs, broadcasters must spawn more eggs than sac spawners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kiorboe T, Sabatini M | year = 1995 | title = Scaling of fecundity, growth and development in marine planktonic copepods | url = | journal = Mar.

===Molluscs===
[[File:Crassostrea gigas p1040847.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pacific oyster]]]]

====Pacific oysters====
Oysters are ''broadcast spawners'', that is, eggs and sperm are released into open water where fertilisation occurs. They are [[protandric]]; during their first year they spawn as males by releasing [[sperm]] into the water. As they grow over the next two or three years and develop greater energy reserves, they spawn as females by releasing [[egg (biology)|eggs]]. Bay oysters usually spawn by the end of June. An increase in water temperature prompts a few oysters to spawn. This triggers spawning in the rest, clouding the water with millions of eggs and sperm. A single female oyster can produce up to 100 million eggs annually. The eggs become fertilized in the water and develop rapidly into [[planktonic]] [[larva]]e. which eventually find suitable sites, such as another oyster's shell, on which to settle. Attached oyster larvae are called '''spat'''. Spat are oysters less than {{convert|25|mm|in}} long.

The [[Pacific oyster]] usually has separate sexes. Their sex can be determined by examining the [[gonad]]s, and it can change from year to year, normally during the winter months. In certain environmental conditions, one sex is favoured over the other. [[Dichogamy|Protandry]] is favoured in areas of high food abundance and protogyny occurs in areas of low food abundance. In habitats with a high food supply, the [[sex ratio]] in the adult population tends to favour females, and areas with low food abundances tend to have a larger proportion of male adults. Spawning in the Pacific oyster occurs at {{convert|20|°C}}. This species is very [[Fecundity|fecund]], with females releasing about 50–200 million eggs in regular intervals (at a rate of 5–10 times a minute) in a single spawning. Once released from the [[gonad]]s, the eggs move through the suprabranchial chambers ([[gill]]s), are then pushed through the [[gill]] ostia into the mantle chamber, and are finally released in the water, forming a small cloud.  In males, the sperm is released at the opposite end of the oyster, along with the normal exhalent stream of water.&lt;ref name="quayle"&gt;Quayle, D.B (1969). ''Pacific oyster culture in British Columbia'', p. 23. First Edition. Ottawa: The Queen’s Printer.&lt;/ref&gt;  A rise in water temperature is thought to be the main cue in the initiation of spawning, as the onset of higher water temperatures in the summer results in earlier spawning in the Pacific oyster.&lt;ref name="grangere"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Grangeré | first1 = K. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2009 | title = Modelling the influence of environmental factors on the physiological status of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas in an estuarine embayment; The Baie des Veys (France) | url = | journal = Journal of Sea Research | volume = 62 | issue = | pages = 147–158 | doi=10.1016/j.seares.2009.02.002| bibcode = 2009JSR....62..147G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[larvae]] of the Pacific oyster are [[Marine larval ecology|planktotrophic]], and are about 70&amp;nbsp;µm at the [[Apex (mollusc)|prodissoconch]] 1 stage. The [[larvae]] move through the water column via the use of a larval foot to find suitable settlement locations. They can spend several weeks at this phase, which is dependent on water temperature, salinity and food supply. Over these weeks, [[larvae]] can disperse great distances by water currents before they [[Metamorphosis|metamorphose]] and settle as small [[Oyster|spat]]. Similar to other oyster [[species]], once the Pacific oyster [[larvae]] find a suitable [[habitat]], they attach to it permanently using cement secreted from a gland in their foot. After settlement, the larvae metamorphose into juvenile spat. The growth rate is very rapid in optimum environmental conditions, and market size can be achieved in 18 to 30 months.&lt;ref name="FAO"&gt;[http://www.fao.org/fishery/culturedspecies/Crassostrea_gigas/en Pacific Oyster factsheet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513033820/http://www.fao.org/fishery/culturedspecies/Crassostrea_gigas/en |date=2012-05-13 }}, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cephalopods====
[[Cephalopod]]s, such as squid and octopuses, have prominent heads and a set of arms ([[tentacle]]s) modified from the primitive foot of molluscs. All cephalopods are [[sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]]. However, they lack external sexual characteristics, so they use colour communication. A courting male approaches a likely looking mate flashing his brightest colours, often in rippling displays. If the other cephalopod is female and receptive, her skin will change colour to become pale, and mating will occur. If the other cephalopod remains brightly coloured, it is taken as a warning.&lt;ref name="Branch1981"&gt;{{cite book|author=Branch George, Branch, Margo and Bannister, Anthony |year=1981 |title=''The Living Shores of Southern Africa''|isbn=0-86977-115-9|publisher=C. Struik|location=Cape Town}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All cephalopods reproduce by spawning [[egg (biology)|egg]]s. Most cephalopods use semi-internal fertilization where the male places his gametes inside the female's [[mantle cavity]] to fertilize the [[Ovum|ova]] in the female's single [[ovary]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weichtiere.at/Mollusks/Kopffuesser/haupt.html Cephalopods.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020065950/http://www.weichtiere.at/Mollusks/Kopffuesser/haupt.html |date=2007-10-20 }} The Living World of Molluscs. Robert Nordsieck.&lt;/ref&gt; The "penis" in most male cephalopods is a long and muscular end of the gonoduct used to transfer spermatophores to a modified sperm-carrying arm called a [[hectocotylus]]. That in turn is used to transfer the spermatophores to the female. In species where the hectocotylus is missing, the "penis" is long and able to extend beyond the mantle cavity and transfers the spermatophores directly to the female. In many cephalopods, mating occurs head to head and the male may simply transfer sperm to the female. Others may detach the sperm-carrying arm and leave it attached to the female. Deep water squid have the greatest known penis length relative to body size of all mobile animals, second in the entire animal kingdom only to certain sessile [[barnacle]]s. Penis elongation in the [[greater hooked squid]] may result in a penis that is as long as the mantle, head and arms combined.&lt;ref name="penis"&gt;Arkhipkin, A.I. &amp; V.V. Laptikhovsky 2010.

[[Echinoderm]]s are marine animals, widespread in all oceans, but not found in fresh water. Just below their skin is an [[endoskeleton]] composed of [[calcareous]] plates or [[ossicle]]s.

====Sea urchins====
[[Sea urchin]]s are spiky echinoderms with spherical bodies which usually contain five [[gonad]]s. They move slowly, feed mostly on [[seaweed]], and are important for the diet of [[sea otter]]s. Sea urchins are [[dioecious]], having separate male and female sexes, although there is generally no easy way to distinguish the two. The gonads are lined with muscles underneath the [[peritoneum]], and these allow the animal to squeeze its [[gamete]]s through the duct and into the surrounding sea water, where fertilization takes place.&lt;ref name=IZ&gt;{{cite book |last=Barnes |first=Robert D. |year=1982 |title= Invertebrate Zoology |publisher= Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 961–981|isbn= 0-03-056747-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their [[roe]] (male and female gonads) is soft and melting, with a colour ranging from orange to pale yellow, and is sought after as a human delicacy in many parts of the world.

====Sea cucumbers====
[[Sea cucumber]]s are leathery echinoderms with elongated bodies which contain a single, branched gonad. They are found on the sea floor worldwide, and occur in great numbers on the deep sea floor where they often make up the majority of the animal [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://jrscience.wcp.muohio.edu/fieldcourses05/PapersMarineEcologyArticles/SeaCucumbers.html | title = Sea Cucumbers | last = Miller | first = Nat | accessdate = 2007-10-03 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071014115420/http://jrscience.wcp.muohio.edu/fieldcourses05/PapersMarineEcologyArticles/SeaCucumbers.html | archivedate = 2007-10-14 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; They feed on [[plankton]] and decaying organic debris found at the sea bottom, catching food that flows by with their open tentacles or sifting through bottom [[sediment]]s. Like sea urchins, most sea cucumbers reproduce by releasing [[sperm]] and [[Ovum|ova]] into the ocean water. Depending on conditions, one organism can produce thousands of [[gamete]]s.

[[File:Espardenya (animal).jpg|thumb|left|[[Sea cucumber]]s have one gonad]]

Sea cucumbers are typically [[dioecious]], with separate male and female individuals. The reproductive system consists of a single [[gonad]], consisting of a cluster of tubules emptying into a single duct that opens on the upper surface of the animal, close to the tentacles.&lt;ref name=IZ/&gt; Many species fertilise their eggs internally. The fertilised egg develops in a pouch on the adult's body and eventually hatches as a juvenile sea cucumber.&lt;ref&gt;Branch GM, Griffiths CL, Branch ML and Beckley LE (2005) ''Two Oceans'' {{ISBN|0-86486-672-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few species brood their young inside the body cavity, giving birth through a small rupture in the body wall close to the anus. The remaining species develop their eggs into a free-swimming [[larva]], usually after about three days of development. This larva swims by means of a long band of [[cilia]] wrapped around its body. As the larva grows it transforms into a barrel-shaped body with three to five separate rings of cilia. The tentacles are usually the first adult features to appear, before the regular tube feet.&lt;ref name=IZ/&gt;

| quote = Amphibians have successfully solved most of the problems associated with exposure to air. But their reproductive system was and is linked to water, and it remains very fishlike. Almost all amphibians spawn in water and lay a great number of small eggs that hatch quickly into swimming larvae. The eggs do not need any complex protection against drying, because if the environment dries, the larvae are doomed as well as the eggs. Thus selection has acted to encourage the selection of suitable sites for laying eggs, rather than suitable devices for protecting eggs. Both fishes and amphibians may migrate long distances for spawning, and favoured sites are often disputed vigorously.| source = Richard Cowen&lt;ref name="Cowen"&gt;Cowen, Richard (2005) [https://books.google.com/books?id=Z-Tam4XuXLkC&amp;pg=PA117&amp;dq=Amphibian+spawning&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=smlHTcHBEJTovQPokqTyBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Amphibian%20spawning&amp;f=false ''History of life''] John Wiley and Sons, {{ISBN|1-4051-1756-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|117–8}}

[[Amphibian]]s are found in and around fresh water lakes and ponds, but not in marine environments. Examples are frogs and toads, [[salamander]]s, [[newt]]s and [[caecilian]]s (which resemble snakes). They are cold-blooded animals that [[Metamorphosis|metamorphose]] from a juvenile water-breathing form, usually to an adult air-breathing form, though [[mudpuppies]] retain juvenile gills in adulthood.

====Frogs and toads====
Female frogs and toads usually spawn gelatinous egg masses containing thousands of eggs in water. Different species lay eggs in distinctive and identifiable ways. For example, the [[American toad]] lays long strings of eggs. The eggs are highly vulnerable to [[predation]], so frogs have evolved many techniques to ensure the survival of the next generation. In colder areas the embryo is black to absorb more heat from the sun, which speeds up development. Most commonly, this involves [[synchronous reproduction]]. Many individuals will breed at the same time, overwhelming the actions of predators; the majority of the offspring will still die due to predation, but there is a greater chance some will survive. Another way in which some species avoid predators and the pathogens eggs are exposed to in ponds is to lay eggs on leaves above the pond, with a gelatinous coating designed to retain moisture. In these species the tadpoles drop into the water upon hatching. The eggs of some species laid out of water can detect vibrations of nearby predatory wasps or snakes, and will hatch early to avoid being eaten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Warkentin| first=K.M.| year=1995| title=Adaptive plasticity in hatching age: a response to predation risk trade-offs| journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences| volume=92| pages=3507–3510| doi=10.1073/pnas.92.8.3507| pmid=| issue=8|bibcode = 1995PNAS...92.3507W | pmc=42196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the length of the egg stage depends on the species and environmental conditions, aquatic eggs generally hatch within one week. Unlike salamanders and newts, frogs and toads never become sexually mature while still in their larval stage. The hatched eggs continue life as [[tadpole]]s, which typically have oval bodies and long, vertically flattened tails. As a general rule, free living larvae are fully aquatic. They lack  eyelids and have a cartilaginous skeleton, a [[lateral line system]], gills for respiration (external gills at first, internal gills later) and tails with dorsal and ventral folds of skin for swimming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-40603/Anura |title=Anura :: From tadpole to adult - Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=2008-11-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BUNYRjh4?url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/29023/Anura |archivedate=2012-10-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They quickly develop a gill pouch that covers the gills and the front legs; the lungs are also developed at an early stage as an accessory breathing organ. Some species which go through the metamorphosis inside the egg and hatch to small frogs never develop gills; instead there are specialised areas of skin that take care of respiration. Tadpoles also lack true teeth, but the jaws in most species usually have two elongate, parallel rows of small [[keratin]]ized structures called keradonts in the upper jaw while the lower jaw has three rows of keradonts, surrounded by a [[keratin|horny]] beak, but the number of rows can be lower (sometimes zero), or much higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.answers.com/topic/larvae |title=Larvae: Information from |publisher=Answers.com |accessdate=2010-03-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608224846/http://www.answers.com/topic/larvae |archivedate=2010-06-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tadpoles feed on [[alga]]e, including [[diatom]]s filtered from the water through the [[gill]]s. Some species are carnivorous at the tadpole stage, eating insects, smaller tadpoles, and fish. [[Cannibalism]] has been observed among tadpoles. Early developers who gain legs may be eaten by the others, so the late bloomers survive longer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marinebiology.co.uk/frogs.htm Frogs Found in the U.K.].

[[Sea turtle]]s are amphibious reptiles, but they are not [[amphibian]]s. Reptiles belong to the class [[Reptilia]] while amphibians belong to the class [[Amphibia]]. These are two distinct taxonomic groups. Reptiles have scales and leathery skins, while the skins of amphibians are smooth and porous. Unlike frogs, sea turtle eggs have tough, leathery shells which allow them to survive on land without drying out.

Some sea turtles migrate long distances between feeding and spawning grounds. [[Green turtle]]s have feeding grounds along the Brazilian coast. Each year, thousands of these turtles migrate about {{convert|2300|km}} to their spawning ground, [[Ascension Island]] in the Atlantic, an island only {{convert|11|km}} across. Each year the returning turtles dig between 6,000 and 15,000 nests, often returning to the same beach from where they hatched. Females usually mate every two to four years. Males on the other hand visit the breeding areas every year, attempting to mate.&lt;ref name="AuThreatenedSpecies"&gt;{{cite press release|title=Australian Threatened Species: Green turtle (''Chelonia mydas'') |publisher=Government of Australia |year=2006 |url=http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/threatened/publications/pubs/tsd06green-turtle.pdf |accessdate=2007-08-15 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911072001/http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/threatened/publications/pubs/tsd06green-turtle.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Green sea turtles' mating is similar to other marine turtles.

At around 45 to 75 days, the eggs hatch during the night and the hatchlings [[instinct]]ively head directly into the water. This is the most dangerous time in a turtle's life.

===Aquatic insects===
[[Aquatic insect]]s also spawn. [[Mayfly|Mayflies]] "are famed for their short adult life. Some species have under an hour to mate and lay their eggs before they die. Their pre-adult stage, known as the subimago, may be even shorter - perhaps lasting just a few minutes before they moult into their adult form. Therefore a mayfly spends most of its life as a nymph, hidden from view under the water."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/life/Mayfly Mayfly] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110206120308/http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/life/Mayfly |date=2011-02-06 }} BBC.

===Corals===
[[File:Coral Life Cycles ZP.svg|thumb|400px|Life cycles of broadcasters and brooders]]

Corals can be both [[Gonochorism|gonochoristic]] (unisexual) and [[Hermaphroditism|hermaphroditic]], each of which can reproduce sexually and asexually. Reproduction also allows corals to settle new areas.

Corals predominantly reproduce [[sexual reproduction|sexually]]. 25% of [[hermatypic coral]]s (stony corals) form single sex ([[gonochoristic]]) colonies, while the rest are [[hermaphroditic]].&lt;ref name="Veron"&gt;{{cite book

Planulae exhibit positive ''[[phototaxis]]'', swimming towards light to reach surface waters where they drift and grow before descending to seek a hard surface to which they can attach and establish a new colony. They also exhibit positive ''sonotaxis'', moving towards sounds that emanate from the reef and away from open water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Reproductive synchrony|Synchronous spawning]] is very typical on the coral reef and often, even when multiple [[species]] are present, all corals spawn on the same night. This synchrony is essential so that male and female gametes can meet. Corals must rely on environmental cues, varying from species to species, to determine the proper time to release gametes into the water. The cues involve lunar changes, sunset time, and possibly chemical signalling.&lt;ref name="Veron" /&gt; Synchronous spawning may form hybrids and is perhaps involved in coral [[speciation]].&lt;ref name=Hatta&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some places the spawn can be visually dramatic, clouding the usually clear water with gametes, typically at night.

Corals use two methods for sexual reproduction, which differ in whether the female gametes are released:

*'''Broadcasters''', the majority of which mass spawn, rely heavily on environmental cues, because they release both sperm and eggs into the water. The corals use long-term cues such as [[day length]], water temperature, and/or rate of temperature change. The short-term cue is most often the [[Lunar phase|lunar cycle]], with sunset cuing the release.&lt;ref name="Veron" /&gt; About 75% of coral species are broadcasters, the majority of which are hermatypic, or reef-building corals.&lt;ref name="Veron" /&gt; The positively buoyant gametes float towards the surface where fertilization produces [[planula]] larvae. The larvae swim towards the surface light to enter into currents, where they usually remain for two days, but sometimes up to three weeks, and in one known case two months,&lt;ref name=Jones /&gt; after which they settle and metamorphose into polyps and form colonies.
*'''Brooders''' are most often ahermatypic (non-reef building) in areas of high current or wave action. Brooders release only sperm, which is negatively buoyant, and can harbor unfertilized eggs for weeks, lowering the need for mass synchronous spawning events, which do sometimes occur.&lt;ref name="Veron" /&gt; After fertilization the corals release [[planula]] larvae which are ready to settle.&lt;ref name=MilneBay&gt;

[[Fungus|Fungi]] are not plants, and require different conditions for optimal growth. Plants develop through [[photosynthesis]], a process that converts atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]] into [[carbohydrate]]s, especially [[cellulose]]. While sunlight provides an energy source for plants, mushrooms derive all of their energy and growth materials from their [[growth medium]], through biochemical [[decomposition]] processes. This does not mean that light is an unnecessary requirement, since some fungi use light as a signal to induce fruiting. However, all the materials for growth must already be present in the growth medium. Instead of seeds, mushrooms reproduce sexually during underground growth, and asexually through [[spore]]s. Either of these can be contaminated with airborne microorganisms, which will interfere with mushroom growth and prevent a healthy crop. [[Mycelium]], or actively growing mushroom culture, is placed on growth substrate to seed or introduce mushrooms to grow on a [[substrate (biology)|substrate]]. This is also known as inoculation, spawning or adding spawn. Its main advantages are to reduce chances of contamination while giving mushrooms a firm beginning.&lt;ref name="r10"&gt;

==Synopsis==
Given that the film is [[experimental film|experimental]], there is no proper narrative; rather, there is a guideline governing its development. The masked silhouettes climb stairs, and engage in various meetings on each level. This is a spiritual quest that doubles as a research on [[optical illusion]]s, Bokanowski recreating all the objectives of his cameras. This is a [[feature film]], which is rare for artisanal [[animation]] and [[experimental film|experimental]] films.

In the booklet that accompanies the [[DVD]] which contains Bokanowski's sole two documentaries (''La Part du Hasard'', [[1984 in film|1984]], on the painter Henri Dimier; and ''Le Rêve éveillé'', [[2003 in film|2003]]; dialogues between the psychotherapist Colette Aboulker-Muscat and her patients), editor Pip Chodorov wrote: "The search for the overrunning of perception, and thereby oneself, is an expression of the spirituality present in the lives of these two figures: inspiration that we also found in Bokanowski's films, which are also searches into abstraction in the real, mysterious blanks that recover the daily. In his film ''The Angel'', characters search for light, and rise in spirals towards beacons of white and pure light, the librarian-researchers conduct a fierce intellectual quest, hoping for an illuminating response buried under mountains of books. Light plays a central role for the filmmaker, just like it does for the painter and therapist, as a peak of dramatic pleasure. We are pulled forward, upward, through these leaks in the twilight towards the light."&lt;ref&gt;Kira B.M. Films et Re:Voir Vidéo, [[2008 in film|2008]], p. 6. {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A CD album containing the soundtrack accompanying the film, composed by [[Michèle Bokanowski]], the director's wife, was released during 2003 by the label trAace under the title ''L'Ange''.

==Report on the animation==
According to [[Raphaël Bassan]], in his article «''L'Ange'': Un météore dans le ciel de l'animation,» [[Patrick Bokanowski]]'s film, along with Piotr Kamler's film ''[[Chronopolis (film)|Chronopolis]]'', both having premiered in [[1982 in film|1982]] at the [[1982 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]], can be considered the beginnings of contemporary [[animation]]. This remark is based on the technical means and the visual or philosophical sense employed by [[Patrick Bokanowski]]. The masks erase all human personality in the characters. [[Patrick Bokanowski]] would thus have total control over the "matter" of the image and its optical composition. This is especially noticeable throughout the film, with images taken through distorted objectives or a plastic work on the sets and costumes, for example in the scene of the designer.

==The ascent towards light==
Again according to [[Raphaël Bassan]], ''The Angel'' can be seen as a spiritual ascension. [[Patrick Bokanowski]] creates his own universe and obeys his own aesthetic logic. It takes us through a series of distorted areas, obscure visions, metamorphoses, and synthetic objects. Indeed, in the film, the human may be viewed as a fetish object (for example, the doll hanging by a thread), with reference to [[Franz Kafka#"Kafkaesque"|Kafkaesque]] and [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] theories on [[automaton|automata]] and the fear of man faced with something as complex as him. The ascent of the stairs would be the liberation of the ideas of death, culture, and sex that makes us reach the emblematic figure of the angel.

==Creating a plastic universe==
For Jacques Kermabon, ''The Angel'' is a variation of [[optics]], as control and manipulation of light, as attested by the integration of plastic optical devices. Similarly, the effects on perspective diagrams emphasizes the relativity of this representation process. In the same gesture, the aesthetics of ''The Angel'', which opens up an infinity of possibilities, announces a cinema that would be before any movement, rhythm, rhyme, form, or work on the color and material: a cinema where the meaning is dissolved and effect predominates. In a way, [[Patrick Bokanowski]] brilliantly realized what some artists-filmmakers envisioned in the 1920s: an aesthetic for creations to come – the ''[[Cinéma pur]]'' and the [[French impressionist cinema|first avant-garde]].

{{nihongo|'''''The Mobile Cop Jiban'''''|機動刑事ジバン|Kidō Keiji Jiban}} is a Japanese [[tokusatsu]] television series which serves as the 8th entry in the ''[[Metal Hero Series]]'' [[Metaseries|franchise]], and the first series to have toy commercials that were filmed on Videotape. Produced by [[Toei Company|Toei]] and aired by [[TV Asahi]] in Japan from January 29, 1989 to January 28, 1990, it ran for 52 episodes and a feature movie aired on July 17, 1989. According to Toei's International Sales &amp; Promotion Department, the series' English title can be referred to as ''Jiban''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvarc.toei.co.jp/tv/library/series-title.html|title=Title Lists: TV Series|accessdate=2009-03-08|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520220943/http://tvarc.toei.co.jp/tv/library/series-title.html|archivedate=2011-05-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Created by Keita Amemiya, the premise for the series combines elements from the American film ''[[RoboCop]]'' and the 1970s tokusatsu ''[[Robot Detective]]''.

The opening catchphrase of the series is: {{nihongo|"This is the drama of a girl's and a young man's hearts which love people and protect justice."|これは人を愛し、正義を守る若者と少女の心のドラマである。|Kore wa Hito o Aishi, Seigi o Mamoru Wakamono to Shōjo no Kokoro no Dorama de aru.}}

==Plot==
Naoto Tamura, a new detective in Central City, is killed by a Bionoid Monster in the line of duty. Doctor Kenzo Igarashi, a man whose experiments had been responsible for the Bioron [[Crime syndicate|syndicate]]'s existence, brought the man back to life as a cyborg detective, Jiban. Eventually Madogarbo and Rhinonoid killed Jiban, who returned to life again as '''Perfect Jiban''' (basically the same design as the original, but with a blue-colored metal body and three new weapons). In the finale, Biolon destroyed Jiban's base and transformed Madogarbo into false Jiban. Jiban defeated his duplicate and ultimately Gibanoid, the true form of Biolon's leader Doctor Giba. The victorious Jiban then learned that Mayumi Igarashi, the one civilian that knew his secret, had been his missing younger sister all along.

==Characters==
[[Image:Jiban (The Mobile Cop Jiban).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Mobile Cop Jiban, holding up his badge.]]
* Naoto Tamura/Mobile Cop Jiban: A human revived as a [[cyborg]] by Doctor Igarashi to fight Biolon. He is capable of reverting to his human identity at will. He holds the rank of police commissioner (as a robot) and detective (as human). Jiban's programming enables him to follow these [[RoboCop#The Prime Directives|directives]]:
# Arrest criminals in any circumstance without a warrant.
# Punish criminals on his own judgment if they happen to be members of Bioron.
# Use lethal force depending on the circumstances.
In human form, Naoto often plays the fool and is looked on down by Yoko and Kiyoshiro for this, but Yoko begins to warm up to him after realizing he could be Jiban. In the Filipino Dubbing Version, His name was Marco Tamura. 
* Mayumi Igarashi: The only civilian who knew Jiban's secret identity. She lost her memory in battle, after falling from a waterfall, because, Madogarbo gave her a Bomb Ring. If Jiban approaches her, the bomb will burst. She called Naoto her 'big brother,' only to find that she was really his lost sister in the finale.
* Shun'ichi and Shizue Igarashi: Mayumi's (adoptive) parents. Shunichi is the son of Doctor Kenzou Igarashi but is not a scientist. Relocated as witnesses to Biolon, they resumed their life as Mayumi's foster parents in the finale.
* Doctor Kenzo Igarashi: Started the Jiban's project to counter Bioron, the results of his biological experimentation. He died when Jiban was built.
* Yoko Katagiri: A female detective of Central City. Naoto's senior. Manly sharpshooter who could not figure out that Naoto was Jiban. She is also known in the Filipino Dubbed Version as Lori.
* Kiyoshiro Muramatsu: Elite detective of Central City with a liking for Youko.
* Seiichi Yanagida: The head of the Police Department. He cooperated with Doctor Igarashi in the Jiban Project two years earlier. He collaborated with Jiban after Igarashi's death. He died when Jiban's base was destroyed.
* Section Chief Takeko Bando: The Central City Section Chief of Detectives. Got headaches trying to keep the peace in jurisdictions where strange events occurred, no thanks to Biolon.
* Michiyo Matsumoto: A tea server of the Detectives' Section of Central City Police Department. She is always cheerful and encouraging.
* Boy/Harry Boy: Jiban's robotic assistant. He stays at his secret base. Originally he was simply Boy, an immobile camera-like robot who had to give instructions to Mayumi to operate the control center, but then his computer was transferred to panda-like "Harry" (a robot devised by another student of Doctor Igarashi's) and began substituting for the amnesiac Mayumi. He died when Jiban's base was destroyed.
* Ryo Hayakawa: A drifter who takes in Mayumi after she loses her memory, mistaking her for his dead sister, Midori. He initially refers to her by that name but later refers to her by her own name Mayumi after reading a missing person's notice, although Mayumi does not tell him her true origins (since her memory is faulty). In the scuffle, Mayumi goes away, unable to remember what just happened. He died in Episode 46, when Jiban removed the Bomb Ring from Mayumi's finger with a very precise shot, without hurting her. Ryou took the ring and ran, to throw it out, but was killed in the resulting explosion. He is played by Ryouhei Kobayashi Who would later play Fumiya Hoshikawa / Five Black in the 1990 sentai series [[Chikyuu Sentai Fiveman]].

==Equipment==
* Jiban's Badge: It can be used as a communicator to contact Harry Boy, Seiichi and Mayumi in Jiban's Base or used to summon any of his vehicles, as well as to control their armaments electronically.

===Articles===

Every episode, when Jiban faces his Bionoid enemy, he ejects his badge from his waist and shows it to the monster, reading a code of articles and laws that served as his directives (much like the CPU Directives in ''[[RoboCop]]'', but giving him a greater freedom instead of restraining it):

*{{nihongo|(1st Article) Mobile Cop Jiban, under any circumstances, can arrest the criminal without a warrant.|（第一条）機動刑事ジバンは、いかなる場合でも令状なしに犯人を逮捕することができる。|(Daiichijō) Kidō Keiji Jiban wa, ikanaru baai demo reijō nashi ni hannin o taiho suru koto ga dekiru.}}
*{{nihongo|(2nd Article) Mobile Cop Jiban, in case the enemy is recognized as Biolon, can apply the punishment by his own judgement.|（第二条）機動刑事ジバンは、相手がバイオロンと認めた場合、自らの判断で犯人を処罰することができる。|(Dainijō) Kidō Keiji Jiban wa, aite ga Baioron to mitometa baai, mizukara no handan de hannin o shobatsu suru koto ga dekiru.}}

===Super Police Vehicles===
* Super Police Machine Reson: Jiban's patrol car, a modified [mitsubishi starion (third generation)|P] with a sixth generation computer and hence a will of its own, and it was destroyed by Gibanoid.
* Super Police Bike Vaican: Jiban's [[Suzuki]] motorcycle with a sixth generation computer and hence a will of its own, and it was destroyed by Gibanoid. In the Philippine Version, it is known as Mecha Panther.

===Weapons===
* Spikes: It is hidden in Jiban's upper arms to puncture and break a hold or to shoot.
* Jiban Hyper Beam: It is hidden in Jiban's upper arms to shoot into areas that cannot be accessed through physical means (example: doors). Jiban used it in the movie.
* Maximillian Type 3: Jiban's personal [[jutte]]-like weapon. Concealed in a collapsible holster located on his right leg, it can transform into either Pistol, Stun Gun, or Sword Mode.

The Maximillian Type 3 can also perform the following moves and techniques:

# Disclose Shock: It is used in stun gun mode, essentially a stun gun.

* Autoderringer: Jiban's personal rifle. He acquired it after being resurrected as Perfect Jiban. It has a machine gun mode and a bazooka mode. The machine gun mode is used to stun and set up the enemy; after an "Energy Charge" in which the bazooka is charged, it fires a powerful shot to finish off the enemy.

==Criminal Syndicate Bioron==
An armed force organized by the mysterious scientist Doctor Giba intending to take over Japan by means of narrow attacks rather than large-scale destruction. Their theme/weapon is [[biochemistry]].
* Doctor Giba: The bearded brown-haired [[White people|caucasian]] human-looking leader and founder of Bioron. His real identity is Gibanoid, a bio-monster born by accident from the chemical waste of Doctor Igarashi's National Science Academy Bio Laboratory. As a result, Giba is filled with malice for humans. He assumed his true form in the series finale, using Mayumi as a shield to escape in his ship. He died while fighting Jiban on his ship as it crashed into the mountainside.
* Marsha and Karsha: The first bio-lifeforms created by Kiba, his secretaries and intermediaries between him and his Bionoid agents. They can transform into small spiders (for spying on people), and assume their inhuman "Battle" forms (Battle Marsha and Battle Karsha), armed with energy whips. They were killed in the series finale by Doctor Giba for failing to kill Jiban.
* Bubi and Muku (Pugui and Muguie in the Brazilian dub)&lt;br&gt; The cute and not so-cute creatures living in Bioron's base. Muku was one of Jiban's foes in early chapters, in giant size, but only as a distraction. The 4 critters had a tendency to annoy Marsha and Karsha with their Commentary of what the 2 recently did during that episode. Sometimes just showing up once to be used as target practice by the Bionoids demonstrating their powers. The four became friends with Mayumi when she told them about a mother's love and she tried to defend them from Marsha and Karsha who attacked the critters for saving Mayumi's life by Defusing the bomb in Fake Momnoid. They hung out with Mayumi in the finale.
* Madogarbo (17-51): A Jiban Cyborg Killer created by Doctor Giba as a counter to Jiban. Using power from Queen Cosmos, she and Rhinonoid are able to kill Jiban in Episode 34, but he is resurrected as Perfect Jiban. She later assumes his total appearance to attack him by having his Reson, Spylas and Vaican attack Jiban making them believe Jiban was Madogarbo. She even got as far as damaging Jiban so badly that he went Blind but Mayumi's Despair at seeing her brother about to be killed caused what energy of Queen Cosmos was left to gather and blast Fake Jiban turning her back into regular Madogarbo she was then killed by Jiban.
*Kuro Kiba: Madogarbo's motorcycle with rhino horn and sidecar with machine guns.
* Queen Cosmos (28-46): A lunar life form resembling a human woman (but actually a floating rock like starfish with a long tail) intent on conquering Earth to establish an all-woman empire. She appeared in episode 28 but did not reveal her name till episode 34. In her own words, she is made of space garbage and came from a place that was cold and ugly, lacking anything beautiful, thus her obsession with having everything beautiful and being called beautiful herself. She is more powerful than the other Biorons (except Doctor Giba himself); she allies with them to destroy Jiban. Her jewelry turns into parasite creatures: Earring into a skull patterned ladybug that would infuse into Jiban distorting his circuitry and her Brooch would turn into a spider creature blasting Jiban with tiny powerful balls of light. Her bracelet was able to transform into a snake creature wrapping around one's neck to control their mind. In Episode 46, she was defeated by Jiban.
* Golem Cosmos (37): An offshoot of Queen Cosmos herself, this entity was created to be her champion from a piece of herself. The creature was extremely powerful, armed with a crescent sword and shield, she very nearly defeated Jiban Until he grabbed her sword wrist with Powerbreaker, twisting her wrist and impaling her with Needricker. She then turned back into her clay statue state and dissolved. Weapons: A long silvery sword, shield, energy blasts from sword and laser blasts from eyes.
* Masques: The mass-produced grunt human-like life forms armed with knives, guns, machine guns and bazooka. They can disguise themselves as humans and regenerate lost limbs. A determined human (usually Yoko and sometimes Kiyoshiro) can take them out by shooting them in the head or chest or by physically choking them out.

'''''The Mothman Prophecies''''' is a 2002 U.S. [[supernatural horror]]-[[mystery film]] directed by [[Mark Pellington]], and starring [[Richard Gere]] and [[Laura Linney]]. Based on the 1975 [[The Mothman Prophecies|book of the same name]] by [[parapsychology|parapsychologist]] and [[Charles Fort|Fortean]] author [[John Keel]], the screenplay was written by [[Richard Hatem]]. 

The story follows John Klein (Gere), a reporter who researches the legend of the [[Mothman]]. After a lengthy detour he has no memory of, he finds himself in [[Point Pleasant, West Virginia]], where there have been sightings of an unusual creature and other unexplained phenomena. Many of the sightings remind him of his dead wife. As he becomes increasingly drawn into mysterious forces at work, he hopes they can reconnect him to his wife, while the local sheriff (Linney) becomes concerned about his obsessions.

The film claims to be based on actual events that occurred between November 1966 and December 1967 in Point Pleasant, as described by Keel. It was shot in  [[Pittsburgh]] and [[Kittanning, Pennsylvania]] and was released to mixed reviews.

==Plot==
''[[Washington Post]]'' columnist John Klein and his wife Mary are involved in an accident when Mary swerves to avoid a black, flying figure. John survives the crash unscathed, but Mary is hospitalized. After Mary dies of an unrelated brain tumor, John discovers mysterious drawings of the creature that she had created prior to the night of the accident.

Two years later, John becomes lost in [[West Virginia]] and inexplicably finds himself in [[Point Pleasant, West Virginia|Point Pleasant]], hundreds of miles off his route. Driving in the middle of the night, his car breaks down; and he walks to a nearby house to get help. The owner, Gordon Smallwood, reacts violently to John's appearance and holds him at gunpoint. Local police officer Connie Mills defuses the situation while Gordon explains that this is the third consecutive night John has knocked on his door asking to use a phone, much to John's confusion. John stays at a local motel and considers how he ended up so far from his original destination.

Officer Mills mentions to John that many strange things have been occurring in the past few weeks and that people report seeing a large winged creature like a giant [[moth]] with red eyes. She also tells John about a strange dream she had, in which the words "Wake up, Number 37" were spoken to her. While conversing with Gordon one day, it is revealed to John that he had heard voices from his sink telling him that, in [[Denver]], "99 will die". While discussing the day's events at a local diner, John notices that the news is showing a story on an airplane crash in Denver that killed all 99 passengers aboard. The next night, Gordon frantically explains that he had met the voices in his head, a being named Indrid Cold.

Later that night, Gordon calls John and says that he is standing with someone named Indrid Cold. While John keeps Cold on the line, Officer Mills checks on Gordon. Cold answers John's questions, including ones he could not possibly know the answers to, convincing John that Cold is a supernatural being. This episode starts a string of supernatural calls to John's motel room. One tells him that there will be a great tragedy on the [[Ohio River]]. Later, John receives a call from Gordon and rushes to his home to check on him. He finds Gordon outside, dead from [[Hypothermia|exposure]].

John becomes obsessed with the being, dubbed the Mothman. He meets an expert on the subject, Alexander Leek, who explains its nature and discourages John from becoming further involved. However, when John learns the [[Governor of West Virginia|Governor]] plans to tour a chemical plant located on the Ohio River the following day, he becomes convinced the tragedy will occur there. Officer Mills and the governor ignore his warnings, and nothing happens during the tour. Soon afterwards, John receives a mysterious message that instructs him to await a call from his deceased wife Mary back in [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]], and he returns home.

On [[Christmas Eve]], Officer Mills calls and convinces him to ignore the phone call from "Mary", return to Point Pleasant, and join her. Though anguished, John agrees. As John reaches the [[Silver Bridge]], a malfunctioning traffic light causes traffic congestion. As John walks onto the bridge to investigate, the bolts and supports of the bridge strain. The bridge comes apart, and John realizes that the prophesied tragedy on the Ohio River was about the bridge. As the bridge collapses, Officer Mills' car falls into the water. John jumps in after her and pulls her from the river and up to safety. As the two sit on the back of an ambulance, they see that 36 people have been killed, making Connie the "number 37" from her dream. The cause of the bridge collapse was never fully determined. Although the Mothman has been sighted in other parts of the world, it was never seen again in Point Pleasant.

==Themes and interpretations==
[[File:Mothman2.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Writers analyzed the film's portrayal of [[Mothman]] as demonic.]]
Writer Paul Meehan judged the film's explanation of the Mothman to be a "confused mish-mosh of [[science fiction]] and [[demonology]]" and likened it to the television series ''[[The X-Files]]'', though preserving Keel's "breathless hysteria".{{sfn|Meehan|2009|p=130}} Meehan remarked that "Aliens spouting prophetic utterances are rare in UFO literature".{{sfn|Meehan|2009|p=130}}

In contrast to Meehan, author [[Jason Horsley]] declared ''The Mothman Prophecies'' "probably the most effective depiction of demonic forces at work" in U.S. cinema.{{sfn|Horsley|2009|p=197}} Horsley assessed its approach to the Mothman legend as depicting a "schizophrenic nature of reality", fulfilling a "revelation" purpose in [[horror film]], as it "strips away the comfortable veneer of consensus reality to reveal the seething abyss of irrationality".{{sfn|Horsley|2009|p=197}} Horsley argued the film's Mothman arrives from a foreign dimension, but being without "physical existence", it is also a product of the minds of Point Pleasant's citizens, based on "formless and impersonal energy".{{sfn|Horsley|2009|p=198}} The Mothman, identified by Horsley as "emissary of the [[Id, ego and super-ego|Id]]", is depicted in the film as being as natural as electricity or gravity.{{sfn|Horsley|2009|p=198}}

==Production==

In reality, 46 people died in the collapse of the [[Silver Bridge]], not 36 as depicted in the film. The motion picture's claim at the end credits of the collapse of the Silver Bridge never being explained is false; the incident was found to be caused by the failure of an [[Eyebar|eye-bar]] in a suspension chain in 1971, well before the publication of the book on which the film is based, let alone the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.ca/newspapers?id=cJ1eAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=MVMNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4537,3056163|newspaper=The Portsmouth Times|date=28 May 1976|page=12|title=Claims In Disaster Denied}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wvculture.org/history/wvhs1504.html |title=The Collapse of the Silver Bridge-by Chris LeRose |publisher=Wvculture.org |date= |accessdate=2009-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130830051225/http://www.wvculture.org/history/wvhs1504.html |archivedate=2013-08-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
[[Image:Kittanning Citizen's Bridge.JPG|thumb|200px|Kittanning Citizens Bridge]]
Aside from a few opening scenes filmed in [[Washington, D.C.]], most of the motion picture was filmed in the areas of [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] and [[Kittanning, Pennsylvania|Kittanning]] in [[Pennsylvania]]. The scenes of Gere sitting on a park bench are on the [[University of Pittsburgh]] campus.{{sfn|Tiech|2014|p=72}} Road montages were filmed on [[Pennsylvania Route 28]], and the [[Chicago]] scenes are completely shot in downtown Pittsburgh’s [[Mellon Square]] and Trinity Churchyard environs as well as the entrance to the Duquesne Club. The "Chemical Plant" featured in the movie is actually a power station owned by Reliant Energy in Elrama, Pennsylvania. The Avalon Motor Inn is in [[Eighty Four, Pennsylvania]], though scenes set indoors were built as separate sets, as the inn's atmosphere could not accommodate production.{{sfn|Tiech|2014|p=73}} Point Pleasant scenes were shot in [[Kittanning, Pennsylvania]].  The hospital scenes were filmed at St. Frances Medical Center which is now the site of Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. 
The collapse of the [[Silver Bridge]] was actually filmed at the [[Kittanning Citizens Bridge]] in downtown Kittanning. Scenes shot at Gordon Smallwood’s house were filmed in Washington County on [[Pennsylvania Route 917]]. Pittsburgh’s [[Allegheny County Airport]] serves as backdrop for the airfield scenes. Despite this relocation, several police officers from Point Pleasant appeared as extras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Spiderweb 2000 Solutions |url=http://www.mothmanmuseum.com/MothmanLives/mothmanmovie/register/pointpleasantregister1.html |title=Point Pleasant Register – Mothman |publisher=Mothmanmuseum.com |date= |accessdate=2009-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090717004446/http://www.mothmanmuseum.com/MothmanLives/mothmanmovie/register/pointpleasantregister1.html |archivedate=2009-07-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave it two stars out of four, calling it unfocused, but praised the direction by Mark Pellington "whose command of camera, pacing and the overall effect is so good, it deserves a better screenplay."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-mothman-prophecies-2002 |title=The Mothman Prophecies |work=Rogerebert.com |last=Ebert |first=Roger |date=January 25, 2002 |accessdate=August 23, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' critic Elvis Mitchell judged it "hushed and smooth" but "little more than an adequate shard of winter-doldrums genre fare".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9502E1DC1F3BF936A15752C0A9649C8B63&amp;mcubz=3 |title=FILM REVIEW; Mysteries Multiply In Spooky Adventures |work=[[The New York Times]] |last=Mitchell |first=Elvis |date=January 25, 2002 |accessdate=August 23, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Washington Post]]''{{'}}s Stephen Hunter dismissed it as "all buzz: It's camerawork on the verge of a meltdown and weird music in search of a composer", and joked seeing it "is like getting mugged in an alley by an especially thuggish crew of [[Method actor]]s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/2002/01/25/mothman-gere-in-overdrive/3b81d989-63b4-47ad-88ea-0d6e3dc612a7/ |title='Mothman': Gere in Overdrive |work=[[The Washington Post]] |last=Hunter |first=Stephen |date=January 25, 2002 |accessdate=August 23, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', Robert Koehler claimed it "wanders away from its sustained atmospherics into silly expository detours".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://variety.com/2002/film/reviews/the-mothman-prophecies-1200551819/ |title=Review: 'The Mothman Prophecies' |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |last=Koehler |first=Robert |date=January 18, 2002 |accessdate=August 23, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For ''[[The Guardian]]'', Bob Rickard defended it as "an intelligent and creative exploration of the slippery, dream-like world of those who 'get too close'".&lt;ref name="Rickard"/&gt;

He is mostly known for promulgating the [[Codex Theodosianus|Theodosian law code]], and for the construction of the [[Walls of Constantinople#Theodosian Walls|Theodosian Walls]] of [[Constantinople]]. He also presided over the outbreak of two great [[Christology|Christological controversies]], [[Nestorianism]] and [[Eutychianism]].

==Life==
[[File:Theodosius_II_solidus_Constantinople_439_450_gold_4480mg.jpg|thumb|[[Solidus (coin)|Solidus]] of Theodosius II, 439-450]]
Theodosius was born in 401 as the only son of Emperor [[Arcadius]] and his Frankish-born wife [[Aelia Eudoxia]]. Already in January 402 he was proclaimed co-Augustus by his father, thus becoming the youngest person ever to bear this title in Roman history.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.roman-empire.net/constant/theodosius-II.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 408, his father died and the seven-year-old boy became Emperor of the Eastern half of the Roman Empire.

According to [[Procopius]], the [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] king [[Yazdegerd I]] (399-420) was appointed by Arcadius as the guardian of Theodosius, whom Yazdegerd treated as his own child, sending a tutor to raise him and warning that enmity toward him would be taken as enmity toward Persia.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alireza Shapour Shahbazi]], [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/byzantine-iranian-relations "Byzantine-Iranian relations"], ''[[Encyclopaedia Iranica]]'', 15 December 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

Government was at first by the [[Praetorian prefecture of the East|Praetorian Prefect]] [[Anthemius (praetorian prefect)|Anthemius]], under whose supervision the [[Walls of Constantinople#Theodosian Walls|Theodosian land walls]] of Constantinople were constructed.

In 414, Theodosius' older sister [[Pulcheria]] was proclaimed Augusta and assumed the regency. By 416 Theodosius was declared Augustus in his own right and the regency ended, but his sister remained a strong influence on him. In June 421, Theodosius married [[Aelia Eudocia]], a woman of [[Greek people|Greek]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Duncan, Alistair |title= The noble heritage: Jerusalem and Christianity, a portrait of the Church of the Resurrection |publisher= Longman |year= 1974|page= 28|isbn= 0-582-78039-X |quote= In 438 the Empress Eudocia, wife of Theodosius II, visited Jerusalem.

A separation ultimately occurred between the imperial couple, with Eudocia's establishment in Jerusalem where she favoured monastic [[Monophysitism]] and Pulcheria reassuming an influential role with the support of the eunuch [[Chrysaphius]].

Theodosius' increasing interest in Christianity, fuelled by the influence of Pulcheria, led him to go to [[Roman-Sassanid War (421-422)|war against the Sassanids]] (421–422), who were persecuting Christians; the war ended in a stalemate, when the Romans were forced to accept peace as the Huns menaced [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref&gt;Warren T.

In 423, the Western Emperor [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]], Theodosius' uncle, died and the ''[[primicerius notariorum]]'' [[Joannes]] was proclaimed Emperor. Honorius' sister [[Galla Placidia]] and her young son [[Valentinian III|Valentinian]] fled to Constantinople to seek Eastern assistance and after some deliberation in 424 Theodosius opened the war against Joannes. On 23 October 425, Valentinian III was installed as Emperor of the West with the assistance of the [[Magister Officiorum|''magister officiorum'']] [[Helion (magister officiorum)|Helion]], with his mother acting as regent. To strengthen the ties between the two parts of the Empire, Theodosius' daughter [[Licinia Eudoxia]] was betrothed to Valentinian.

===University and Law Code===
In 425, Theodosius founded the [[University of Constantinople]] with 31 chairs (15 in Latin and 16 in Greek). Among subjects were law, philosophy, medicine, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, music and rhetoric.

In 429, Theodosius appointed a commission to collect all of the laws since the reign of [[Constantine I]], and create a fully formalized system of law. This plan was left unfinished, but the work of a second commission that met in Constantinople, assigned to collect all of the general legislations and bring them up to date was completed, and their collection published as the ''[[Codex Theodosianus]]'' in 438. The law code of Theodosius II, summarizing edicts promulgated since Constantine, formed a basis for the law code of Emperor [[Justinian I]], the ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]'', in the following century.

===Wars with the Huns, Vandals, and Persians===
The [[Roman–Sassanid War (421–422)|war with Persia]] proved indecisive, and a peace was arranged in 422 without changes to the ''status quo''. The later wars of Theodosius were generally less successful.

The Eastern Empire was plagued by raids by the [[Huns]]. Early in Theodosius II's reign Romans used internal Hun discord to overcome [[Uldin]]'s invasion of the Balkans. The Romans strengthened their fortifications and in 424 agreed to pay 350 pounds of gold to encourage the Huns to remain at peace with the Romans. In 433 with the rise of [[Attila]] and [[Bleda]] to unify the Huns, the payment was doubled to 700 pounds.

When Roman Africa [[Battle of Carthage (439)|fell]] to the [[Vandals]] in 439, both Eastern and Western Emperors sent forces to [[Sicily]], intending to launch an attack on the Vandals at Carthage, but this project failed. Seeing the Imperial borders without significant forces, the [[Huns]] and [[Sassanid Persia]] both attacked and the expeditionary force had to be recalled. During 443 two Roman armies were defeated and destroyed by the Huns. [[Anatolius (consul)|Anatolius]] negotiated a peace agreement; the Huns withdrew in exchange for humiliating concessions, including an annual tribute of 2,100 Roman pounds (ca. 687&amp;nbsp;kg) of gold.&lt;ref&gt;Bury, J.B., ''History of the Later Roman Empire'' vol. 1, Dover, New York, 1958, p. 271f&lt;/ref&gt; In 447 the [[Huns]] went through the Balkans, destroying among others the city of [[Serdica]] ([[Sofia]]) and reaching Athyra ([[Büyükçekmece]]) on the outskirts of Constantinople.

===Theological disputes===

During a visit to [[Syria (region)|Syria]], Theodosius met the monk [[Nestorius]], who was a renowned preacher. He appointed Nestorius [[Archbishop of Constantinople]] in 428. Nestorius quickly became involved in the disputes of two theological factions, which differed in their [[Christology]]. Nestorius tried to find a middle ground between those who, emphasizing the fact that in Christ God had been born as a man, insisted on calling [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|the Virgin Mary]] ''Theotokos'' ("birth-giver of God"), and those who rejected that title because God, as an eternal being, could not have been born. Nestorius suggested the title ''Christotokos'' ("birth-giver of Christ") as a compromise, but it did not find acceptance with either faction. He was accused of separating Christ's divine and human natures, resulting in "two Christs", a heresy later called [[Nestorianism]]. Though initially supported by the emperor, Nestorius found a forceful opponent in Archbishop [[Cyril of Alexandria]]. At the request of Nestorius, the emperor called a [[First Council of Ephesus|council]], which convened in Ephesus in 431. This council affirmed the title ''Theotokos'' and condemned Nestorius, who returned to his monastery in Syria and was eventually exiled to a remote monastery in Egypt.

Almost twenty years later, the theological dispute broke out again, this time caused by the Constantinopolitan abbot [[Eutyches]], whose Christology was understood by some to mingle Christ's divine and human nature into one. Eutyches was condemned by Archbishop [[Flavian of Constantinople]] but found a powerful friend in Cyril's successor [[Dioscurus of Alexandria]]. [[Second Council of Ephesus|Another council]] was convoked in Ephesus in 449, later deemed a "robber synod" by [[Pope Leo I]] because of its tumultuous circumstances. This council restored Eutyches and deposed Flavian, who was mistreated and died shortly afterwards. Leo of Rome and many other bishops protested against the outcome, but the emperor supported it. Only after his death in 450 would the decisions be reversed at the [[Council of Chalcedon]].

===Death===
Theodosius died in 450 as the result of a riding accident. In the ensuing power struggle, his sister [[Pulcheria]], who had recently returned to court, won out against the [[eunuch]] [[Chrysaphius]]. She married the general [[Marcian]], thereby making him Emperor.

[[File:BpThomasCoke.png|thumb|right|200px|Bishop Coke.]]
'''Thomas Coke''' (9 September 1747 &amp;ndash; 2 May 1814) was the first [[Methodist]] [[bishop]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Coke, Thomas |volume=6 |page=655}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is known as the Father of Methodist Missions.

Born in [[Brecon]], South [[Wales]], his father, Barthomolew, was a well-to-do [[apothecary]]. Coke, who was only 5 foot and 1&amp;nbsp;inch tall and prone to being overweight, read Jurisprudence at [[Jesus College, Oxford|Jesus College]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], which has a strong Welsh tradition, graduating [[Bachelor of Arts]], then [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge)|Master of Arts]] in 1770, and [[Doctor of Civil Law]] in 1775. On returning to Brecon he served as [[mayor]] in 1772.

==Ordination==
In the same year as his mayoralty he was ordained in the [[Church of England]] and served a [[curacy]] at [[South Petherton]] in [[Somerset]]. He had already allied himself with the Methodist movement, and this made for trouble when a new [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] arrived in the [[Parish (Church of England)|parish]]. Coke had begun to hold cottage services and [[Open-air preaching|open services]] of the sort promoted by [[John Wesley]]. He was dismissed from his post on [[Easter Sunday]] 1777, and his parishioners celebrated at the [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector's]] behest by ringing the church bells and opening a [[hogshead]] of cider. He returned to Petherton in 1807 and preached to a crowd of 2,000.

==Meeting with John Wesley==
He met John Wesley in August 1776, becoming one of his closest assistants. Wesley called Coke "the flea" because he seemed always to be hopping around on his missions.

He was appointed Superintendent of the London District in 1780 and President of the [[Methodist Church in Ireland]] in 1782 - a function he was to serve many times in the coming decades.

==Early plans for Methodist missions==
In January 1784, Thomas Parker, "a barrister and able local preacher from [[York]]", joined Coke in issuing a "Plan of the Society for the Establishment of Missions among the Heathens" (Coke 2013:48; Vickers 2013:133-135)&lt;ref name="Vickers2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Vickers|first=John A. |title=Thomas Coke: Apostle of Methodism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dbVNAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR9|year=2013|publisher=Wipf and Stock|isbn=978-1-62032-975-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Voyage to America==

Following the [[American Revolution]], most of the [[Anglican]] clergy who had been in America came back to England. Wesley asked the [[Bishop of London]] to ordain some ministers for the [[New World]], but he declined. At this point Wesley still considered only a canonically consecrated bishop capable of conferring [[Holy Orders]]. However, in September 1784, in [[Bristol]], Wesley consecrated Coke as Superintendent, a title replaced in 1787 in America by that of Bishop (Greek ''episkopos'') in spite of Wesley's strong disapproval ("superintendent" is etymologically equivalent to ''episkopos'').  Since Coke was already a [[priest]] (Greek ''presbuteros'') or [[presbyter]] in the Church of England, some interpret this consecration as the equivalent of episcopal consecration. Wesley's action took place two months before the consecration in [[Aberdeen]] of [[Samuel Seabury (bishop)|Samuel Seabury]] as bishop of the Protestant Episcopal Church of the USA. Coke set sail for New York; during the voyage he read [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine's]] ''Confessions'', [[Virgil]]'s ''Georgics'', biographies of [[Francis Xavier]] ([[Jesuit]] missionary to India) and [[David Brainerd]] ([[Puritan]] missionary to North American aboriginals), and a treatise on episcopacy. A conference of Methodist preachers was held at [[Baltimore]], starting on Christmas Day 1784, at which Coke and [[Francis Asbury]] were elected superintendents, and the Church was constituted as an independent body under the name of the Methodist Episcopal Church. On 27 December Coke ordained deacons and presbyters and consecrated Asbury as Superintendent; Coke and Asbury are regarded as having been jointly the first superintendents of the Methodist Church in America (the American Methodist Conference formally endorsed the title of Bishop in 1787).

==Other voyages==
Coke returned to England in June 1785 and made eight further visits to America, his final visit being in 1803. While in America he spoke out against [[slavery in the United States|slavery]] and wrote a letter on the subject to [[George Washington]]. Washington met Coke twice and even invited him to preach before [[United States Congress|Congress]]. After spending some months travelling throughout [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]], Coke made his first mission to the [[West Indies]] in 1786, making further visits in 1788-89, 1790, and 1792-93.

==Death of Wesley==
Following Wesley's death in 1791 Coke became Secretary to the British Conference, having been widely supposed to be Wesley's desired successor. He was [[List of Presidents of the Methodist Conference|President of the Conference]] in 1797 and 1805, on both occasions trying to persuade the Conference to confer on him the official title of Bishop.

==More voyages==
In the same year he went to [[Paris]] and preached in French. He established a mission in [[Gibraltar]] in 1803 and then spent five years travelling in the cause of Methodist missions, including visiting [[Sierra Leone]]. He promoted others in setting up missions in [[Canada]] and [[Scotland]].

==Marriages==
On 1 April 1805, at the age of 58, Coke married Penelope Goulding Smith, a wealthy woman who happily spent her personal fortune furthering the missions. She travelled with him until her death on 25 January 1811. That same year in December he married for a second time, to Anne Loxdale, and his wife died the following year, 5 December 1812.&lt;ref&gt;"Adventures of Asbury" by Eric Jennings, ''The Historical Trail'' 1997: Yearbook of Conference Historical Society and Commission on Archives and History, Southern New Jersey Conference, The United Methodist Church (issue 34, 1997), p. 31 footnote 43&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death of Coke==
He hoped to open Methodist missions in the [[East Indies]] and at his own expense he set sail for [[Ceylon]] on 30 December 1813. He had in fact tried to persuade the Prime Minister, [[Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|Lord Liverpool]], to appoint him to an Indian bishopric in the Church of England (the [[appointment of Church of England bishops]] being then, as now, a prerogative exercised by the Prime Minister on behalf of the Sovereign). However, Coke died after four months at sea on the way to Ceylon (Sri Lanka).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

  | encyclopedia = The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition
  | publisher = Columbia University Press
  | year = 2007 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought he died of a "fit of apoplexy," or possibly a [[stroke]]. He died aboard ship, located 2 degrees, 29 minutes south latitude, and 59 degrees, 29 minutes east longitude, in the [[Indian Ocean]], where he was also laid to rest.

Asbury described Coke as "a gentleman, a scholar, a bishop to us; and as a minister of Christ, in zeal, in labours, in services, the greatest man in the last century."

==Publications==
Coke's publications included:

'''Tod Slaughter''' (born '''Norman Carter Slaughter''', 19 March 1885 – 19 February 1956) was an English actor, best known for playing over-the-top maniacs in [[macabre]] film adaptations of [[Victorian literature|Victorian]] [[melodrama]]s.

== Early life ==
Slaughter was born in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], where he attended the [[Royal Grammar School, Newcastle|Royal Grammar School]]. The eldest surviving son of 12 children, he made his way onto the stage in 1905 at [[West Hartlepool]]. In 1913, he became a lessee of the [[Hippodrome]] theatres at [[Richmond, London|Richmond]] and [[Croydon]]. After a brief interruption to serve during [[World War I]] in the [[Royal Flying Corps]], Slaughter resumed his career and returned to the stage.

== Stage success ==
During this period, his stage name was ''N. Carter Slaughter'' and he primarily played the conventional leading man or character roles—seldom the [[villain]]. After the war, he ran the [[Chatham, Kent|Theatre Royal, Chatham]] before taking over the [[Elephant and Castle]] Theatre in [[South London]] for a memorable few years from 1924 onwards that have since passed into British theatrical legend. Slaughter's company revived Victorian "blood-and-thunder" melodramas such as ''[[Maria Marten]]'', ''[[Sweeney Todd]]'', ''[[Jack Sheppard]]'' and ''[[The Silver King (play)|The Silver King]]'' to enthusiastic audiences—not just locals but also sophisticated theatregoers from the [[West End theatre|West End]] who might have initially come for a cheap laugh but ended up enthralled by the power of the fare on offer. Slaughter also staged other types of production such as the annual [[Christmas]] pantomime where he would cast prominent local personalities in bit-parts for audience recognition. Despite a local protest, the Elephant and Castle Theatre was closed down in 1927, Slaughter's company vacating it several months before the end.

It was in 1925 that he adopted the stage name ''Tod Slaughter'', but his primary roles were still character and heroic leads—not the evil-doers. He played the young hero in ''[[The Face at the Window (1897 play)|The Face at the Window]]'', the poacher [[Tom Robinson]] in "[[It's Never Too Late To Mend]]", and the village idiot Tim Winterbottom in ''[[Maria Marten]]''. He also played the title character in ''[[Sherlock Holmes]]'' and [[D'Artagnan]] in ''[[The Three Musketeers]].'' [[Silent film|Silent]] footage exists of Slaughter acting on stage at the Elephant and Castle in the military melodrama "The Flag Lieutenant" in a documentary entitled "London After Dark".&lt;ref&gt;It is available on YOUTUBE at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi2tTPPUNL0#.&lt;/ref&gt; It is said he briefly retired from acting to become a chicken farmer at the start of the 1930s, but it proved a short-lived venture and he was soon back managing his company touring the provinces and outlying London theatres with a repertoire of Victorian melodramas.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

In 1931 at the [[Noël Coward Theatre|New Theatre, London]] he played [[Long John Silver]] in ''[[Treasure Island]]'' during the day and the body snatcher [[William Hare (murderer)|William Hare]] in ''The Crimes Of Burke And Hare'' at night. Publicised as 'Mr Murder', he lapped up his new-found notoriety by boasting he committed 15 murders each day for the duration of the run. Shortly afterwards, he played ''Sweeney Todd, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street'' for the first of 2,000 times on stage. Actor and role had found each other much in the same way as [[Bela Lugosi|Béla Lugosi]] and ''[[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]]'' and the seal was set on Slaughter's subsequent career.

== Film career ==
In 1934 aged 49, he began in films. Usually cast as a villain, his first film was ''[[Maria Marten or Murder in the Red Barn]]'' ([[1935 in film|1935]]) a Victorian melodrama filmed cheaply with Slaughter as the obvious evil-doer, and identified as such at the beginning of the play. In the old melodramatic style, each main member of the cast is introduced before the play begins and has his role explained. When Slaughter comes on, he favours the audience with a cold, evil grin as the on-stage announcer says "Squire Corder, Lord of the Manor...and a villain! Whose blood may be blue—but whose heart is black as night!". This set the general tone for the whole film series, although the introduction format was not used again.

Slaughter’s next film role was as [[Sweeney Todd]] in ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (1936 film)|Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street]]'' (1936), directed and produced by [[George King (film director)|George King]], whose partnership with Slaughter was continued in the subsequent shockers: ''[[The Crimes of Stephen Hawke]]'' (1936); ''[[It's Never Too Late To Mend]]'' (1937); ''[[The Ticket of Leave Man]]'' (1938); ''[[The Face at the Window (1939 film)|The Face at the Window]]'' (1939) and ''[[Crimes at the Dark House]]'' (1940). Most of these films were '[[quota quickies]]', films made quickly and cheaply to fulfil a government requirement that a certain portion of all films distributed by British studios had to be British made. Many such were forgettable, low-quality films, but the lack of studio interest paradoxically made for quality in one way: it gave the maker, by default, artistic control over the final product. Slaughter made the films, for the most part, exactly as he liked, with all the over-the-top melodramatic acting of a bygone age, just as he did on stage. The result was often a fascinating record of once-popular Victorian sensational fiction (''[[Sweeney Todd]]'', Hawkshaw the Detective in ''[[The Ticket-of-Leave Man (play)|The Ticket-of-Leave Man]]'') and sensational factual cases (Maria Martin, victim of ''[[Murder in the Red Barn]]''), done in the style that the original audiences would have expected, but which no other modern filmmaker would have done. If the Victorians could have made feature films, they might well have looked like the works of Tod Slaughter.

There were, however, some non-melodramatic roles in his career. He was a supporting player in ''The Song of the Road'' (1937) and ''[[Darby and Joan]]'' (1937). In ''[[Sexton Blake and the Hooded Terror]]'' (1938), he played the head of an international gang of [[super-villains]].

Slaughter was busy on stage during [[World War II]], performing ''[[Jack the Ripper]], [[Landru]]'' and ''[[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]''. There were also one-act sketches such as ''The Touch of a Child''.

After the war, Slaughter resumed melodramatic roles on screen and starred in ''[[The Curse of the Wraydons]]'' (1946), in which [[Bruce Seton]] played the legendary Victorian bogeyman [[Spring-heeled Jack|Spring-Heeled Jack]], and ''[[The Greed of William Hart]]'' (1948) based on the murderous career of [[Burke and Hare]]. These were produced by Ambassador Films at [[Bushey|Bushey Studios]], who had made a healthy profit rereleasing Tod's 1930s films during the war years.

== Later years ==
During the early 1950s, Slaughter appeared as the villain in two crime films ''[[King of the Underworld (1952 film)|King of the Underworld]]'' (1952) and ''[[Murder at Scotland Yard]]'' (1953) and he was still regularly touring the provinces and London suburbs. However, the public's appetite for melodrama seemed to have abated somewhat by this stage and he was declared bankrupt in 1953&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/catalogue/displaycataloguedetails.asp?CATLN=6&amp;CATID=4600519&amp;SearchInit=4&amp;CATREF=BT+226%2F5647 BT226/5647, National Archives]&lt;/ref&gt; owing to a downturn in his touring income. He continued to act in stage productions, however, such as Molière's ''The Gay Invalid'' opposite future horror star [[Peter Cushing]], and acting as the Master of Ceremonies at an evening of old-fashioned [[music hall]].

His last two films were each three episodes of the television series ''Inspector Morley'' cobbled together for theatrical release. A version of ''Spring-Heeled Jack'' starring Tod was one of the first live TV plays mounted by the BBC after the war.

Still performing on the stage almost to the very end, Slaughter died of coronary thrombosis. After his death following a performance of ''Maria Marten'' in [[Derby]], his work slipped almost completely into obscurity.

== Critical revival ==
Film historians have revived interest in Slaughter's cycle of melodramatic films, placing them in a tradition of "cinema of excess" which also includes the [[Gainsborough Melodramas]] and [[Hammer Horror]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Richards pp.139&amp;ndash;159&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Beatty Rochester''' (January 29, 1789 [[Hagerstown, Maryland|Hagerstown]], [[Washington County, Maryland]] – June 14, 1838) was an American lawyer and politician from [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref name="WBRbioguide"&gt;{{cite web|title=ROCHESTER, William Beatty - Biographical Information|url=https://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=R000360|website=bioguide.congress.gov|publisher=[[Biographical Directory of the United States Congress]]|accessdate=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Rochester was the first child of Col. [[Nathaniel Rochester]] (1752–1831), founder of the City of [[Rochester, New York]], and Sophia ([[née]] Beatty) Rochester (1768–1845).&lt;ref name="rochester"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rochester, William Beatty {{!}} RBSCP|url=http://rbscp.lib.rochester.edu/1111|website=rbscp.lib.rochester.edu|publisher=[[University of Rochester|University of Rochester Libraries]]|accessdate=5 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mayor [[Thomas H.

He attended the public schools and graduated from [[Charlotte Hall Military Academy]].&lt;ref name="WBRbioguide"/&gt;

==Career==
During the [[War of 1812]], Rochester was an [[aide-de-camp]] to Gen. George McClure.
