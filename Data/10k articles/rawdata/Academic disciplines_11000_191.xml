'''Amsterdam University College''' (AUC) is a public [[liberal arts college]] in the [[Netherlands]] with an enrolment of about 900 students from more than 60 countries.&lt;ref name="qr2013" /&gt; All teaching is in English.&lt;ref&gt;Amsterdam University College. (2013). AUC Informational Sheet 2013-2015. Retrieved January 13, 2013 from [http://www.auc.nl/binaries/content/assets/projectsites/amsterdam-university-college/study-abroad/auc-information-sheet-2014-2015.pdf AUC.nl]&lt;/ref&gt;

The college was founded in 2009 as a joint initiative of the [[University of Amsterdam]] and the [[VU University Amsterdam]] with a particular focus on the natural sciences. Although AUC has its own campus, students can also use facilities of both parent universities. The college is part of a recent wave of [[University college#Netherlands|university colleges in the Netherlands]] which have introduced liberal arts education to the country.&lt;ref&gt;Redden, E.

Retrieved January 13, 2014 from [http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/02/08/netherlands-growth-liberal-arts-colleges-has-influenced-higher-ed-sector-whole insidehighered.com].&lt;/ref&gt;

AUC offers [[Bachelor of Arts]] degrees in the social sciences and humanities and a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in science, which are pursued by about 50%, 15%, and 33% of the student body, respectively.&lt;ref name="qr2013" /&gt; The curriculum is strongly interdisciplinary; within each field, students have to pursue at least two disciplines. AUC further emphasizes its 'academic core', which makes up a large part of the curriculum.&lt;ref name="core"&gt;Amsterdam University College. (2012). Academic Core. Retrieved January 13, 2014 from [http://www.auc.nl/academic-programme/programme-structure/academic-core/academic-core.html auc.nl].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The foundation of AUC goes back to an initiative of the two large universities in Amsterdam, [[University of Amsterdam]] (UvA) and [[Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam]] (VU), as well as the municipality. It is part of an initiative to make Amsterdam a hub for research and development in the natural sciences{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}.

AUC was officially founded in 2008, and took up operation with its founding class in 2009. The first dean of the college is Prof. Dr. [[Marijk van der Wende]], Professor of Higher Education at the VU. The first class of graduates received their diplomas in 2012. In 2016, van der Wende was succeeded as AUC dean by Prof. [[Murray Pratt]].

==Academics==

===Reputation===
In the 2016 Keuzegids Universiteiten, AUC earned a designation as top-rated programme based on student ratings and evaluations by the Accreditation Organisation of the Netherlands and Flanders (NVAO).&lt;ref&gt;Amsterdam University College. (2015, November 3). [http://www.auc.nl/news-events/auc-news/news-and-media/news-and-media/content/folder-5/11/auc-top-rated-programme-2016.html?page=2&amp;pageSize=20 AUC earns Top Rated Programme designation for 2016]. ''AUC.nl''. Retrieved June 16, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2015 Nationale Studentenquête, AUC received a high rating of 4.3 out of 5, placing it among the best programmes at the University of Amsterdam and in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Nationale Studentenenquête. (n.d.). [https://www.studiekeuze123.nl/opleidingen/liberal-arts-and-sciences-joint-degree-universiteit-van-amsterdam-wo-bachelor Universiteit van Amsterdam: Liberal Arts and Sciences]. ''Studiekeuze123''. Retrieved June 16, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Students at Amsterdam University College receive a joint degree from the University of Amsterdam and the VU University. The University of Amsterdam regularly ranks among the best 100 universities in the world (2015/16 [[QS World University Rankings]]: 56).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.topuniversities.com/universities/university-amsterdam University of Amsterdam]. Topuniversities. Retrieved June 16, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Academic programme===
AUC offers a three-year honours degree in three very broad majors in science, social sciences, and humanities. During the academic year 2013/14, students could choose between approximately 200 courses across eight fields in the sciences, nine in the social sciences, seven in the humanities, as well as the academic core.&lt;ref name="major"&gt;Amsterdam University College. (2013). Your major. ''AUC.nl''. Retrieved January 13, 2014 from [http://www.auc.nl/academic-programme/programme-structure/your-major/your-major.html auc.nl].&lt;/ref&gt; As part of AUC's interdisciplinary orientation, students have to pursue 'tracks' in at least two fields within their major. Interdisciplinarity is also emphasized by AUC's themes, which link fields across majors.&lt;ref name="major" /&gt;

The college emphasizes a strong academic core, which includes academic writing and basic calculus or statistics, but also more unusual courses such as logic or 'identity and diversity', which are compulsory for students of all majors. Furthermore, students are required to take two to three language courses; in 2013/14, the languages offered were Arabic, Dutch, French, German, and Spanish.

AUC has branded itself as a 'science college', and places particular emphasis on the natural sciences. In 2013/14, courses were offered in eight 'tracks': information sciences, mathematics, physics, earth and environmental sciences, chemistry, biology, biomedical sciences, and health.  Although during the first years less than 35% of students were majoring in the sciences, this number is expected to rise to 50% in the future.&lt;ref name="qr2013"&gt;Amsterdam University College. (2013). Quality Report 2012-2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

While teachers for many core and introductory courses are employed by AUC directly, the college draws on its parent institutions for most of its lecturers.

Graduates receive a joint degree from the University of Amsterdam and VU University; a Bachelor of Arts in the social sciences or humanities or a Bachelor of Science in science. Students graduation with a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or higher receive an honours degree. Cum laude degrees are awarded for graduation with a GPA of 3.5 or higher, and summa cum laude degrees for a 3.9 or higher.

====Study abroad====

Around a third of all students spend a semester abroad during their studies at AUC.&lt;ref name="qr2013" /&gt; The college has a number of partners on its own, but students can also apply to the exchange partners of UvA and VU on all continents.

===Admissions===
In 2010, AUC admitted 200 of about 900 applicants for its class of 2013. The maximum number of admissions per year is 300.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.auc.nl/admissions-aid/policy-on-admissions/policy-on-admissions.html|title=AUC's policy on admissions|last=Amsterdam University College|first=|date=23 December 2016|website=AUC.nl|access-date=10 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average grade of admitted students in the [[Grade (education)#Netherlands|Dutch system]] was 7.6, the highest of all Dutch university colleges that publish such information. Unusually for a European public university, AUC's application procedure includes an individual essay, motivation letter, and interview. In a country where access to most courses of study is unrestricted, this gives the college unusual freedoms to select its students. AUC in particular takes into account international experience.&lt;ref&gt;Amsterdam University College. (2013). AUC's admission requirements.

==Tuition and scholarships==
As of the academic year of 2012/13, the tuition fee amounts to 3,901 Euro for Dutch and EU/[[European Economic Area|EEA]] students and 11,491 Euro for all other international students.&lt;ref name="feesandcosts"&gt;Amsterdam University College.

The AUC Scholarship Fund is supported by VU, UvA, and the [[Amsterdam University College Student Association]]; as well as a range of corporate sponsors. The latter include [[Rabobank]], [[Royal Dutch Shell]], [[Schiphol Group]], [[Akzo Nobel]], [[KLM]], and [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]].&lt;ref name="scholarship" /&gt;

==Accreditation==
The AUC programme is a fully accredited joint bachelor programme of the VU University Amsterdam and the University of Amsterdam (UvA). The Dutch government allocates responsibility for accreditation to the NVAO (the Accreditation Organisation of the Netherlands and Flanders). The AUC programme was accredited by the NVAO on 2 September 2008. Upon successful completion of the programme students receive a joint Bachelor honours degree from the VU University Amsterdam and University of Amsterdam (UvA) and the title Bachelor of Arts (BA) or Bachelor of Science (BSc).

AUC has been awarded the "Distinctive feature of small-scale and intensive education" by the Dutch-Flemish Accreditation Council (NVAO), which is required from Dutch institutes of higher education for raising tuition fees beyond the national standard.&lt;ref name="feesandcosts" /&gt;

==Campus and location==
[[File:Amsterdam university college.jpg|{{largethumb}}|The AUC building at Amsterdam Science Park.]]
[[File:Amsterdam University College - level 2.jpg|{{largethumb}}|Inside the building.]]
AUC is a residential college with a campus in the Science Park. It is located in the borough of [[Amsterdam-Oost]], in what was formerly the borough of [[Watergraafsmeer]]. The campus houses an academic building, completed in 2012, and student residences managed by the student housing cooperation DUWO.

===Academic building===
AUC has a main academic building in [[Science Park Amsterdam]], where most classes are taught. In line with AUC's promise of small classes, the building does not have an auditorium; larger events take place in its common room area. Lecture rooms and study areas are spread over four levels, and teacher's rooms are notably located in areas accessible to students.&lt;ref name="dereuver"&gt;de Reuver, P. (2012). [http://www.parool.nl/parool/nl/1424/STADSGEZICHTEN/article/detail/3319541/2012/09/20/Stadsgezichten-Amsterdam-University-College.dhtml Stadsgezichten: Amsterdam University College]. [[Het Parool]]. Retrieved September 28, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The AUC academic building, opened in 2012, was designed by [[Mecanoo]] architects. Its exterior appearance is dominated by a façade of rust-coloured steel plates. The interior design received praise in the media for its "open character".&lt;ref name="dereuver" /&gt; The building won the 2013 Amsterdam Architecture Prize, for "the simplicity of its shape [and] its surprising interior. A variety of different types of space with a range of educational functions meet, connect and merge under one substantial roof, which is spectacular and yet unobtrusive."&lt;ref&gt;ARCAM. (2013). [http://www.arcam.nl/algemeen/770_nl.html Amsterdam University College Winnaar Gouden A.A.P. 2013] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513180428/http://www.arcam.nl/algemeen/770_nl.html |date=May 13, 2013 }}. Retrieved April 22, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The architecture of the academic building emphasises environmental sustainability. The roof is planted with grass, increasing insulation and acting as a water storeroom. In combination with a geothermal heat pump, this serves to minimise energy loss and consumption.&lt;ref name="dereuver" /&gt;

Before moving to its current location, for the first three years of its existence AUC had a temporary academic building in the [[Plantage (Amsterdam)|Plantage]] quarter, associated with the Roeterseiland location of the University of Amsterdam and opposite of the city's zoo, [[Natura Artis Magistra|Artis]].

===Student residences===

Students are required to maintain residence on campus for the whole duration of their studies. The student dorms are located on the Science Park campus in close proximity to AUC's academic building. The dorm buildings are administered by Dutch student housing specialist [[DUWO]].

===Science Park===
The Science Park Amsterdam was initiated in 1996 as the location for a cluster of university buildings, research institutes and businesses.&lt;ref name="dereuver" /&gt; Next to AUC, the area also houses the University of Amsterdam Faculty of Sciences and several research institutes for physics, computer science, and mathematics. With two [[colocation centre|colocations]] of the [[Amsterdam Internet Exchange]] at the institutes [[Stichting Academisch Rekencentrum Amsterdam|SARA]] and [[NIKHEF]], the Science Park Amsterdam is one of the major Internet hubs in Europe.

The [[Amsterdam Science Park railway station]] connects the area to [[Amsterdam Centraal|Amsterdam Central Station]] and [[Schiphol Airport]] in one direction and [[Almere]] in the other. A bus line connects the Science Park to [[Amsterdam Muiderpoort railway station|Muiderpoort]] and [[Amsterdam Amstel railway station|Amstel]] railway stations.

==Student life==

As a small residential college, AUC has a close-knit student community. Parts of campus life are organised by student committees, although many activities take place in an informal framework. In particular Dutch students of AUC also participate in student organisations off campus, including fraternities at the University of Amsterdam and the traditional student rowing clubs, [[Nereus Rowing Club|Nereus]] and [[Skøll]].

===Student body===

AUC annually admits 300 students, most of whom join for the fall semester; though spring admission is possible.&lt;ref name="300students"&gt;Amsterdam University College. (2012). [https://archive.is/20130222153236/http://www.auc.nl/news-events/news-and-media/news-and-media/news-and-media/content/folder/08/auc-welcomes-class-of-2015.html AUC Welcomes Class of 2015]. AUC.nl. Retrieved December 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of the year of 2013/14, enrollment was at about 750 students.

About 40% of student at Amsterdam University College come from abroad, roughly as many as come from the Netherlands (minority and foreign-educated Dutch students excluded). International students hail from more than 60 countries, though most are citizens of the European Union. In addition, in 2012/13, 12% of AUC students had a Dutch minority background. AUC has stated its aim to raise the minority population to 20% by means of scholarships and increased outreach to high schools.&lt;ref&gt;Amsterdam University College. (2013).

Retrieved September 27, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clubs and organisations===

Student activities at AUC are organised under the umbrella of the Amsterdam University College Student Association. The Student Association derives its budget from an annual membership fee collected via tuition payments. Funds are used to support independently run student committees. In 2013-14, there were 22 recognised student committees.&lt;ref&gt;AUCSA. (2012). [http://myauc.nl/committees/ Committees]. MyAUC. Retrieved December 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Student politics===

Until the academic year 2012/13, students were represented by the elected five-member Student Council responsible for administrative matters, as well as three non-elected student members (alongside three faculty members) on the Board of Studies, with an advisory function on academic matters. As of 2012/13, Student Council and Board of Studies have undergone an experimental merger, forming a College Council with five representatives of student body and faculty each.&lt;ref&gt;Amsterdam University College.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="739">'''Anatomical variability''' is the differences between [[Anatomy|anatomical]] structures of the [[animal]]s from the same [[species]]. This variability is mainly caused by [[Genetics|genetical effects]] and it may vary considerably between different [[population]]s. Rate of variability considerably differ between single [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s. Therefore, the state that occurs with biggest probability is considered as a norm. It is necessary to distinguish between pathological conditions that are not considered as an anatomical variation.

{{distinguish|text=[[dislocation (syntax)|dislocation]]s, an apposition-like structure whose elements are not placed side by side|opposition (disambiguation)}}

'''Apposition''' is a [[grammatical]] construction in which two elements, normally [[noun phrase]]s, are placed side by side, with one element serving to identify the other in a different way; the two elements are said to be ''in apposition''. One of the elements is called the '''appositive''', although its identification requires consideration of how the elements are used in a sentence.

For example, in the two sentences below, the phrases ''Alice Smith'' and ''my sister'' are in apposition, with the appositive identified with italics:
* My sister, ''Alice Smith'', likes jelly beans.
* Alice Smith, ''my sister'', likes jelly beans.

Traditionally, appositions were called by their [[Latin language|Latin]] name ''appositio'', although the English form is now more commonly used. It is derived from Latin: ''ad'' ("near") and ''positio'' ("placement").

Apposition is a figure of speech of the [[scheme (linguistics)|scheme]] type, and often results when the verbs (particularly verbs of being) in supporting clauses are eliminated to produce shorter descriptive phrases. This makes them often function as [[hyperbaton]]s, or figures of disorder, because they can disrupt the flow of a sentence. For example, in the phrase: "My wife, a nurse by training, ...", it is necessary to pause before the parenthetical modification "a nurse by training".

==Restrictive versus non-restrictive==

&lt;!-- linked from redirect [[Restrictive appositive]] --&gt;

A '''restrictive appositive''' provides information essential to identifying the phrase in apposition.
It limits or clarifies that phrase in some crucial way, and the meaning of the sentence would change if the appositive were removed.
In English, restrictive appositives are not set off by [[comma (punctuation)|comma]]s.
The sentences below use restrictive appositives. Here and elsewhere in this section, the relevant phrases are marked as the ''appositive phrase''&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt; or the ''phrase in apposition''&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt;.
* ''My friend''&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt; ''Alice Smith''&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt; likes jelly beans. &lt;small&gt;– I have many friends, but I am restricting my statement to the one named Alice Smith.&lt;/small&gt;
* He likes ''the television show''&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt; ''The Simpsons''&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;small&gt;– There are many television shows, and he likes that particular one.&lt;/small&gt;

A '''non-restrictive appositive''' provides information not critical to identifying the phrase in apposition.
It provides non-essential information, and the essential meaning of the sentence would not change if the appositive were removed.
In English, non-restrictive appositives are typically set off by commas.&lt;ref name=WritingPU&gt;
[http://www.princeton.edu/writing/center/resources/commas.pdf "Commas: Some Common Problems"]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Princeton Writing Program, [[Princeton University]], 1999, ''princeton.edu/writing/center/resources/''.&lt;/ref&gt;
The sentences below use non-restrictive appositives.
* ''Alice Smith''&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt;, ''my friend''&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;, likes jelly beans. &lt;small&gt;– The fact that Alice is my friend was not necessary to identify her.&lt;/small&gt;
* I visited ''Canada''&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt;, ''a beautiful country''&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;small&gt;– The appositive is not needed to identify Canada.&lt;/small&gt;
* ''The first to arrive at the house''&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;, ''she''&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt; unlocked the front door.

The same phrase can be a restrictive appositive in one context and a non-restrictive appositive in another:
* ''My brother''&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt; ''Nathan''&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt; is here. &lt;small&gt;– Restrictive: I have many brothers, and the one named Nathan is here.&lt;/small&gt;
* ''My brother''&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt;, ''Nathan''&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;, is here. &lt;small&gt;– Non-restrictive: I have only one brother and, as an aside, his name is Nathan.&lt;/small&gt;
If there is any doubt that the appositive is non-restrictive, it is safer to use the restrictive form.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}
In the example above, the restrictive first sentence is still correct even if there is only one brother.

A [[restrictiveness|relative clause]] is not always an appositive.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}
* ''My sister''&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt;, ''Alice Smith''&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;, likes jelly beans. &lt;small&gt;– The appositive is the noun phrase ''Alice Smith''.&lt;/small&gt;
* ''My sister''&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt;, ''a doctor whose name is Alice Smith''&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;, likes jelly beans. &lt;small&gt;– The appositive is the noun phrase with dependent relative clause ''a doctor whose name is Alice Smith''.&lt;/small&gt;
* My sister, whose name is Alice Smith, likes jelly beans. &lt;small&gt;– There is no appositive. There is a relative clause: ''whose name is Alice Smith''.&lt;/small&gt;

==Examples==
In the following examples, the appositive phrases are shown in italics:

* I was born in Finland, ''the land of a thousand lakes''. &lt;small&gt;– Appositives are not limited to describing people.&lt;/small&gt;
* Barry Goldwater, ''the junior senator from Arizona'', received the Republican nomination in 1964.
* John and Bob, ''both friends of mine'', are starting a band.
* Alexander the Great, ''the Macedonian conqueror of Persia'', was one of the most successful military commanders of the ancient world.
* Dean Martin, ''a very popular singer'', will be performing at the Sands Hotel.
* You are better than anyone, ''anyone I've ever met''.
* ''A staunch supporter of democracy'', Rob campaigned against the king's authoritarian rule.

A kind of appositive is the [[false title]], a restrictive phrase, as in "''Noted biologist'' Jane Smith has arrived.", where the phrase ''Noted biologist'' is used as an informal title. The use of false titles is [[False title#Controversy|controversial]].

Appositive phrases can also serve as definitions:
* No one – ''not a single person'' – should ever suffer that way.
&lt;!-- Is the following really an appositive? "the best" is a noun phrase, "better than all the rest" is an adjective phrase --&gt;
* You're simply the best, ''better than all the rest''.

==Appositive genitive==
In several languages, the same syntax that is used to express such relations as possession can also be used appositively. Examples include:

* In English:
** "Appositive oblique", a prepositional phrase with ''of'' as in: ''the month of December'', ''the sin of pride'', or ''the city of New York''. This has also been invoked as an explanation for the [[English possessive#Double genitive|double genitive]]: ''a friend of mine''.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 5, §14.3 (pages 447–448), Rodney Huddleston, Geoffrey K. Pullum, ''The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002. {{ISBN|0-521-43146-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** The ending ''-'s'' as in "[[In Dublin's Fair City]]". This is uncommon.
* In classical Greek:
** "Genitive of explanation" as in {{lang-gr|italic=yes|ὑὸς μέγα χρῆμα}} (hyòs méga chrêma), "a monster (great affair) of a boar" ([[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories of Herodotus]], 1.36);&lt;ref&gt;§1322 (pages 317–318), [[Herbert Weir Smyth]], revised by Gordon M. Messing, ''Greek Grammar'', Cambridge, Massachusetts : Harvard University Press, 1956 [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0007&amp;query=head%3D%23366 Perseus Digital Library]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Japanese:
** Postpositive ''no'' as in: {{lang-ja|italic=yes|ふじの山|Fuji no Yama|[[Mount Fuji#Variations|the Mountain of Fuji]]}};&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.guidetojapanese.org/learn/grammar/nounparticles|title=Noun-related Particles {{!}} Learn Japanese|website=www.guidetojapanese.org|access-date=2016-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A dictionary of basic Japanese Grammar|publisher=The Japan Times|year=1986|isbn=4-7890-0454-6|location=|pages=312}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Biblical Hebrew:
**[[Hebrew grammar#Noun construct|Construct]], "genitive of association" as in: {{lang-he|גַּן עֵדֶן|Gan 'Ēden}} ''[[Garden of Eden]]''.&lt;ref&gt;§9.5.3h (p. 153), [[Bruce K. Waltke]] and [[Michael Patrick O'Connor]], ''An Introduction to Biblical Hebrew Syntax'', Winona Lake, Ind.: Eisenbrauns, 1990. {{ISBN|0-931464-31-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This '''bibliography of anthropology''' lists some notable publications in the field of [[anthropology]], including its various subfields. It is not comprehensive and continues to be developed. It also includes a number of works that are not by anthropologists but are relevant to the field, such as literary theory, sociology, psychology, and philosophical anthropology.

Anthropology is the study of [[human]]ity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Anthropology?|url=http://www.aaanet.org/about/WhatisAnthropology.cfm|publisher=[[American Anthropological Association]]|accessdate=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History and Mission|url=http://www.therai.org.uk/about-the-rai/|publisher=[[Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland]]|accessdate=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=L'Anthropologie |url=http://www.afa.msh-paris.fr/discipline.html |publisher=Association Française des Anthropologues |accessdate=17 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109101912/http://www.afa.msh-paris.fr/discipline.html |archivedate=9 November 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Described as "the most humanistic of sciences and the most scientific of the humanities",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Anthropology?|url=http://www.discoveranthropology.org.uk/about-anthropology/what-is-anthropology.html|work=Discover Anthropology|publisher=Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland|accessdate=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is considered to bridge the [[natural science]]s, [[social science]]s and [[humanities]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shore|first=Bradd|title=Creating consilience: integrating the sciences and the humanities|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-979439-3|pages=140–158|editor=Edward Slingerland and Mark Collard|chapter=Unconsilience: Rethinking the Two-Cultures Conundrum in Anthropology}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and draws upon a wide range of related fields.

== Biological anthropology ==
[[Biological anthropology]] is traditionally conceived of as part of the North American four-field approach. In some universities, however, the subject has repositioned itself as ''human evolutionary biology''. In Europe, it is sometimes taught as an individual subject at college level or as part of the discipline of biology. Its methods are informed by evolutionary biology, hence the adjunct ''biological''. Since 1993, the Biological Anthropology Section of the [[American Anthropological Association]] has awarded the W.W. Howells Book Award in Biological Anthropology.&lt;ref name=Howells&gt;{{cite web|title=W. W.

== Archaeology ==
Archaeological anthropology is traditionally conceived of as part of the North American four-field approach. With the four-field approach being questioned for its orthodoxy, the subject has gained considerable independence in recent years and some archaeologists have rejected the label ''anthropology''. In Europe, the subject maintains closer connections to history and is simply conceived of as ''archaeology'' with a distinct research focus and methodology.

== Some points of reference in related disciplines ==
Anthropological research has exerted considerable influence on other disciplines such as [[sociology]], [[literary theory]], and [[philosophy]]. Conversely, contemporary anthropological discourse has become receptive to a wide variety of theoretical currents which in turn help to shape the cognitive identity of the subject(s). Among the key publications from related disciplines that have advanced anthropological scholarship are:

{{Buddhism}}
'''Buddhist studies''', also known as '''[[Buddhology]]''', is the [[academic]] study of [[Buddhism]]. The term Buddhology was coined in the early 20th-century by Estlin Carpenter – a Unitarian minister, to mean the "study of Buddhahood, the nature of the Buddha, and doctrines of a Buddha", but the terms Buddhology and Buddhist studies are generally synonymous in the contemporary context.&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/buddhology Buddhology], Oxford English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amos Yong (2011), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/41416537 On Doing Theology and Buddhology: A Spectrum of Christian Proposals], Buddhist-Christian Studies, Vol. 31, University of Hawai'i Press pp. 103-118&lt;/ref&gt; According to William M. Johnston, in some specific contexts, Buddhology may be viewed as a subset of Buddhist studies, with a focus on Buddhist [[hermeneutics]], [[exegesis]], [[ontology]] and Buddha's attributes.&lt;ref name=Johnston225&gt;{{cite book|author=William M. Johnston|title=Encyclopedia of Monasticism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iepJAgAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-78716-4|pages=225–226}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars of Buddhist studies focus on the [[history]], [[culture]], [[archaeology]], [[arts]], [[philology]], [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], [[theology]], [[philosophy]], practices, interreligious comparative studies and other subjects related to Buddhism.&lt;ref name=Johnston225/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Minoru Kiyota (1984), ''Modern Japanese Buddhology: Its History and Problematics, The Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies, volume 7, Number 1, pages 17–33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul David Numrich|title=North American Buddhists in Social Context|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sAy1s626lE0C&amp;pg=PA4|year=2008|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=90-04-16826-5|pages=4–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the study of [[Judaism]] or [[Christianity]], the field of Buddhist studies has been dominated by "outsiders" to Buddhist cultures and traditions. However, [[Japan]]ese universities have also made major contributions, as have Asian immigrants to Western countries, and Western converts to Buddhism.

==University programs and institutes==
The first graduate program in Buddhist studies in North America started in 1961 at the University of Wisconsin&amp;ndash;Madision.{{sfn|Lopez|1998|p=159}}&lt;!--Src doesn't explicitly state N. America, but the context indicates such.--&gt; According to Prebish, Buddhist studies in the United States prior to 1975 was dominated by the University of Wisconsin, Harvard University and the [[University of Chicago]].&lt;ref name=prebish2006/&gt; Prebish cites two surveys by Hart{{full|reason=Hart refs should be included with Prebish ref|date=January 2013}} in which the following university programs were found to have produced the most scholars with U.S. university posts: Chicago, Wisconsin, Harvard, Columbia, Yale, Virginia, Stanford, Berkeley, Princeton, Temple, Northwestern, Michigan, Washington, and Tokyo.{{sfn|Prebish|1999|p=194}}

Other regionally-accredited U.S. institutions with programs in Buddhism include the [[University of the West]], [[Institute of Buddhist Studies]], [[Naropa University]], and the [[California Institute of Integral Studies]]. (A number of dharma centers offer semi-academic, unaccredited study; some of these seem likely eventually to win accreditation.)

Prominent European programs include [[Oxford University]] and [[Cambridge University]], [[School of Oriental and African Studies]], [[Humboldt University of Berlin]], [[University of Hamburg]], [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|University of Munich]], [[Heidelberg University|University of Heidelberg]], [[University of Bonn]], [[University of Vienna]], [[Ghent University]], and the [[Sorbonne]]. In Asia, [[University of Tokyo]] and [[Rissho University]] have long been a major centers for Buddhist research, and [[Nalanda University]] launched a master program at 2016.{{cn|date=January 2013}}

==Scholars and scholar-practioners==
Charles Prebish, a scholar-practitioner and Chair of Religious Studies at [[Utah State University]], states that the Buddhist studies and academics in North American universities include those who are practicing Buddhists, the latter he terms as “scholar-practitioners.”.&lt;ref name=prebish2006&gt;{{cite journal|last=Prebish |first=Charles |title=The New Panditas |journal=Buddhadharma |date=Spring 2006 |url= http://archive.thebuddhadharma.com/issues/2006/spring/scholar-practitioners.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130104104614/http://archive.thebuddhadharma.com/issues/2006/spring/scholar-practitioners.html |archivedate=January 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Butts Up''' (A.K.A. "Spread Eagle", "A-Ball", "Asses Up", "Assies' Rehab &amp; Tea", "Suey", "Balliver Shagnasty's Revenge", "Balls Deep", "Ballsies", "Beartrap"&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7WVaMZAu2PEC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=%22Butt+ball%22+game+ball&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UUIkUYjGK6TI0AHKwoGACg&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Butt%20ball%22%20game%20ball&amp;f=false Children's Folklore: A Handbook], p.75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=A2xc-rivz5oC&amp;pg=PA76&amp;dq=%22Butt+ball%22+game+ball&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UUIkUYjGK6TI0AHKwoGACg&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Butt%20ball%22%20game%20ball&amp;f=false When Play Was Play: Why Pick-Up Games Matter], p 76&lt;/ref&gt; , "Blackjack" (along with many other colloquial names)) is a North American [[elementary school]] children's [[playground]] game originating in the 1950s or earlier. It is slightly similar to the game Screen Ball. Butts Up or Booties Up began in the 1940s or 1950s as a penalty phase of various city street games. Butts Up is played with a ball (such as a [[tennis ball]], [[handball]], or [[racquetball]]) on a paved surface against a wall, with a variable number of participants—usually more than three and often likely to exceed ten. Butts Up tends to be played during [[Recess (break)|recess]], before or after school. {{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}. Popular in New England is another frequent variation of [[wallball]] that usually differs a lot from the more widely known 'Butts Up'.

Players determine the variations of the game prior to start of play. Some of the rules of the game very loosely resemble the rules of [[baseball]] and [[racquetball]].

==Object of the game==
The object of the game is to be the last player remaining in the game after all other players are out.

In some variations of the game, there is no specific object of the game. Play continues until time runs out. In this variation, when players are "out" three times, they must lean against the wall and wait to be hit by the ball ("Butts Up"). See below for more on this.

==Rules of the game==
The first player, usually the tennis ball owner, starts the game or "breaks the ice" (see terminology below) by throwing the ball against the wall with the objective of having the ball hit the wall without hitting the ground first.

After the ball makes contact with the wall and bounces off the ground at least once, any of the players, including the thrower, may then try to catch the ball. If catcher mishandles the ball and the ball touches the ground, the catcher must try to touch the wall before another player fields and throws the ball against the wall. If the ball touches the wall before the catcher, the catcher is out and must face various consequences. In some places, instead of hitting the wall you have to throw it '''at''' the catcher.

If the ball is caught before hitting the [[Road surface|pavement]], the thrower is penalized with one "out", much like baseball. Some refer to this as a "cobra", or "ace". After three outs a player leaves the game. Sometimes alternate words, such as "wall," are used instead. In some cases, such as in [[New York City]], the catcher has to "peg" the thrower, while the thrower trys to touch the wall, if the thrower misses, the throwers doesn't get an out.

If the thrower's ball bounces before hitting the wall, the thrower must run to the wall and touch the wall before an opponent can pick up the ball and throw it to the wall. If the original thrower doesn't make contact with the wall before the ball reaches the wall, the original thrower is out. If the thrower reaches for the ball, but has it bounce off his fingers and onto the pavement, this counts as missing the throw, and he must run to the wall.

In one variation of the game, a runner who does not reach the wall before the thrown ball hits must, in addition to receiving an out, stand facing the wall and allow the thrower to "peg" him or her with the ball (usually with all possible force).
[[File:Buttsup.jpg|thumbnail|In the "Blue Gooch" variation of the game, the player who is "out" must keep their legs apart, so the thrower has a chance at shooting them in the perineum.]]
In another variation, when a player is "out" three times, he or she must lean against the wall, bent over with his butt in the air—hence the name of the game—and wait for the ball to be thrown at him. Other players take turns throwing the ball until he is hit. If he doesn't look back, the thrower must lob the ball in the air, but if he does, the thrower may peg him with as hard a throw as he likes. Also, in this version, the thrower must hit the player as he is running to the wall, rather than hitting the wall, to get the runner out.

The game continues until all but one player have received three outs and left the game. This form of the game is referred to as "three–out elimination".

In [[New York City]], the game is usually called "Asses Up", and the game is played exactly the same, the only major difference is that when ever a kid is "out", or doesn't touch the wall before the ball or is hit with the ball by another player, instead of eliminated after three "outs", they get eliminated when they complete the word "Asses Up" with each "out" is a letter in the game (I.e. A-S-S-E-S-U-P). This is similar with spelling out "Horse" in [[Basketball]]. Also, the term "Reach" is used when a catcher is far away, and the ball is usually thrown at the thrower as an alternative to "pegging" (usually when smaller kids are playing).

In a variation practiced widely in [[Santa Clara County, California]] elementary schools as late as the mid-1980s, each time a player earned an out, his "butt was up," and he would stand with hands against the wall, waiting to be pegged by the player who threw him out.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} If the player is hit in the "target area," he is convicted of the out, and gets a letter (B-U-T-T, for example), and leaves the game. In this variation, at the ice breaker's discretion, play may pass by number, i.e., Player 1 breaks the ice, then Player 2 must retrieve and throw the ball, followed by Player 3, etc. In more physical games, the ball is not required to bounce after touching the wall, and aggressive players will stand near the wall, within arms' reach, pegging other players and quickly touching the wall, then retrieving the ball and throwing the other player out. Other rules included "handsies", which prohibits players from touching the ball with both hands at once (the ball could be tossed in the air and caught with the other hand, but typically a great show was made of this feat in order to avoid even the appearance of a foul). Also, a player with ball in hand must keep one foot planted at all times, or, in the interest of justice, if a player was stranded well beyond throwing or relay distance (see "Savies"), he could take one large step toward the wall. If a player realizes he has mishandled the ball and thus must "hit the wall," and deliberately "spikes" the ball to frustrate others' attempts to throw him out, his butt is automatically up; at the other players' discretion, they may each take a turn at throwing that player out. The attack does not cease simply because a pegger has successfully scored in the target area; each player throws nonetheless, usually with intent to cause injury or disfigurement.

In more recent variations of the game, a player only receives an out if he or she is actually hit by the peg, rather than receiving it for having to be on the wall. Also, if a player wins without having gotten an out, the win is called a 'lockdown'.

In New England, specifically the Tri-State Area, another version of Wall Ball was invented. In this variation two or more people line up to take turns hitting the ball. The ball must bounce first, then hit the wall, then bounce; the next person in line must hit the ball before its second bounce on the ground, then the ball must hit the wall, then bounce. This repeats for however many people there are. It is usually played with three outs, but the number could vary depending on the amount of people. There are also many variations in each school, but the overall premise is usually the same. Wall Ball in New England is usually considered a separate game from Butts Up. In some areas in Westchester county, this variant is called "Watermelon", which is named for the legal action of going completely under the ball as a hit.

In a Maryland version of wallball, the icebreaker starts the game, with all other players nearby. Players are allowed to catch the ball if it has not bounced, as well as catching other players' throws. Failing to catch the ball, taking too long to get a handle on the ball or any other type of "bobbling" is the "bobblers" cue to touch the wall. If a player is relatively far from the wall while holding the ball, other players may call "wallball" (hence the name), meaning the player with the ball has ten seconds to hit the wall, without moving or bouncing the ball off the ground. If a player is out, he must stand on the wall and get pegged by the player who got him out. If the peg is successful (player hit), play continues with the icebreaker throwing the ball first. If the peg is unsuccessful (player not hit), other players have the opportunity to get the thrower out. No penalty besides pegging occurs from an out. Fouls include kicking the ball, preventing a player from getting you out (kicking or throwing the ball after bobbling as opposed to dropping it), tampering with a throw or interfering with a peg (interference can also occur if a player running to touch the wall is obstructed by another player.) Interference is determined by the other players in the game.

Yet another playground version of the game (popular in southern Arizona) simply had all the participants apart from the first player line up against the wall, with the immediate goal of the first player to hit a participant with the ball (typically as hard as possible) and thus make that participant "it".  This version resembles dodge ball but with the wall limiting the possible dodging moves to two dimensions rather than three.  Any participant who strayed too far away from the wall during play was "punished" by a penalty shot, where the thrower would aim solely at him or her and throw the ball as hard as possible, although a hit in this case did not make the person "it".  When a player became "it" by legal means, he or she assumed the role of "thrower".  The object of this game—like many other playground games—was simply to inflict pain on classmates, and was thus often played in relatively obscure or off-limits areas of the playground.

Another version of wallball is that the ball is catchable off the wall and the catching player can move about freely as long as they throw the ball within the next few seconds. If the ball bounces very far away from the wall the other players may call "challenge" to the player with the ball. A call of challenge means the player may not move and must throw the ball and try to hit the wall. If the player chooses to drop the ball at his/her feet then the player is automatically out. The thrower, however, may choose to simply throw it at an object that would cause the ball to be hard to get before the thrower can be thrown out, possibly causing a successive number of challenges until a suitable throw has been made. If a player catches the ball they may run to the wall and place both their off hand and foot on the wall and call "bulldog." If the player does this they can freely throw the ball at whomever they wish. If they hit another player then the hit player must touch the wall before they are thrown out. "Bulldogs" are usually frowned upon by other players and considered a cheap way of getting other players out. If a player has committed a double touch another player may call the foul and is allowed a throw at the person. The offending player must be "spread eagle" as it is called, against the wall and may not move. The thrower is not allow a full force throw unless the person moves or flinches as it is usually taken from a short distance. This can either result in a peg or a double throw depending on the rules. If the thrower makes a full force throw without the offender moving then the thrower must be pegged by the original offender. In some games the thrower on "spread eagle" must touch the wall or they too will be out, unless they missed and hit the wall.

==Terminology==
*'''Black Mail or Reach''': Once the ball is caught (usually from a long distance) any player may yell "Black Mail!" The player with the ball must now throw the ball to the wall without moving feet.
*'''Break the Ice''': To start the game by making the first throw regardless of ball ownership.
* '''Savies''' or '''Taxis''': If a player feels he is too far from the wall to throw the ball and make wall contact, the thrower can throw the ball to another player and hope the receiver will wait until the thrower has run to the wall and touched it. However, savies can backfire if the catcher betrays the thrower by throwing the ball to the wall before the thrower has run and touched the wall. In some places, there is no betrayal as, if you save them they don't have to run.
*'''Chicken Drops''': An alternative to Savies. If a player is too far from the wall to make a complete pass to hit the wall, he can drop the ball at his feet and head to the wall as quickly as he can to make contact. If another player picks up the ball that player can throw the runner out by getting the ball to the wall before the runner. This technique is frowned upon by Butts Up enthusiasts.
*'''Double Touch''': The act of a player touching the ball twice, resulting in an automatic out. Typically this occurs when the ball is bobbled or tripped over.
*'''Handsies''': (Some variations) The act of a player touching the ball with both hands at once, resulting in an obligation to "hit the wall".
*'''Hit the Wall''': Alternative terminology for a player's obligation, upon committing "handsies," "chicken drops," "traveling," or other offense, failure to accomplish which before any other player has thrown the player out by causing it to hit the wall results in an out or the runner's butt being "up".
*'''Peg''': A player throws the ball at another player, usually resulting in an out for both players.
*'''Self-Out''': A player throws the ball to the wall and then catches it before the ball hits the pavement. This rule is optional and can be determined by the players prior to the start of the game.
*'''Self-Peg''': A thrower's ball bounces off the wall and hits the thrower. In this case the thrower must run to the wall and touch the wall before an opponent picks up the ball and throws it to the wall.
*'''Stripping''': In more physical iterations of the game, a player may attempt to strip the ball from the hand of another player. If successful, both players must run to the wall to avoid earning an out.
*'''Tie Goes to the Runner''': If there is a dispute among the players about whether a runner is safe or out, and the decision for and against is a 50/50 tie among players, the runner stays in the game.
*'''Traveling''': The act of a player moving both feet with ball in hand.
*'''Lockdown''': Occurs when a player wins the game without having gotten out.
*'''Poison''': When someone catches the ball without the ball hitting the ground. If they say "poison" the "poisoned" person must run to the wall before the person who caught the ball throws it to the wall.

'''Cisgenesis''' is a product designation for a category of [[Genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] plants. A variety of [[classification scheme]]s have been proposed&lt;ref name=Nielsen03&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Nielsen | first1 = K. M. | title = Transgenic organisms—time for conceptual diversification? | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 21 | issue = 3 | pages = 227–228 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12610561 | doi = 10.1038/nbt0303-227}}&lt;/ref&gt; that order [[genetically modified organism]]s based on the nature of introduced genotypical changes, rather than the process of genetic engineering.

Cisgenesis (from "same" and "beginning") is one term for organisms that have been engineered using a process in which genes are artificially transferred between organisms that could otherwise be conventionally bred.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cisgenesis.com/content/view/2/25/lang,english/ Cisgenesis definitions] cisgenesis.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schubert06&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Schubert | first1 = D.| last2 = Williams | first2 = D.| title = 'Cisgenic' as a product designation| journal = Nature Biotechnology| volume = 24| issue = 11| pages = 1327–9| year = 2006| pmid = 17093469| doi = 10.1038/nbt1106-1327}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike in [[transgenesis]], [[genes]] are only transferred between closely related organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=MacKenzie D |title=How the humble potato could feed the world |journal=New Scientist |volume= |issue=2667 |pages=30–33 |date=2 August 2008 |doi= |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19926671.600-how-the-humble-potato-could-feed-the-world.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while future technologies may allow genomes to be directly edited within an individual organism, currently nucleic acid sequences must be isolated and introduced using the same technologies that are used to produce transgenic organisms. The term was first introduced in 2000 by Henk J. Schouten and Henk Jochemsen,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Jochemsen H |year=2000|title=Toetsen en begrenzen: een ethische en politieke beoordeling van de moderne biotechnologie |isbn=9072016327}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2004 a PhD thesis by Jan Schaart of [[Wageningen University]] in 2004, discussing making [[strawberry|strawberries]] less susceptible to ''[[Botrytis cinerea]]''.

In [[Europe]], currently, this process is governed by the same laws as transgenesis but researchers at Wageningen University in the [[Netherlands]] feel that this should be changed and regulated in the same way as conventionally [[plant breeding#Classical plant breeding|bred plants]]. However, other scientists, writing in [[Nature Biotechnology]], have disagreed.&lt;ref name=Schubert06/&gt; In 2012 the [[European Food Safety Authority]] (EFSA) issued a report with their risk assessment of cisgenic and intragenic plants. They compared the hazards associated with plants produced by cisgenesis and intragenesis with those obtained either by conventional plant breeding techniques or transgenesis. The EFSA concluded that "similar hazards can be associated with cisgenic and conventionally bred plants, while novel hazards can be associated with intragenic and transgenic plants."&lt;ref&gt;Staff (2012) [https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2903/j.efsa.2012.2561 Scientific opinion addressing the safety assessment of plants developed through cisgenesis and intragenesis] EFSA Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms, Parma, Italy, Retrieved 1 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Cisgenesis has been applied to transfer of natural resistance genes to the devastating disease ''[[Phytophthora infestans]]'' in potato&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Park T-H |author2=Vleeshouwers VGAA |author3=Jacobsen E |title=Molecular breeding for resistance to ''Phytophthora infestans'' (Mont.) de Bary in potato (''Solanum tuberosum L.''): a perspective of cisgenesis |journal=Plant Breeding |volume=128 |issue=2 |pages=109–117 |year=2009 |doi=10.1111/j.1439-0523.2008.01619.x |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Apple scab|scab]] (''[[Venturia inaequalis]]'') in apple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vanblaere T, Flachowsky H, Gessler C, Broggini GA |title=Molecular characterization of cisgenic lines of apple 'Gala' carrying the Rvi6 scab resistance gene |journal=Plant Biotechnol.

Cisgenesis and transgenesis use artificial [[Horizontal gene transfer|gene transfer]], which results in less extensive change to an organism's genome than [[mutagenesis]], which was widely used before genetic engineering was developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Schouten | first1 = H.| last2 = Krens | first2 = F.| last3 = Jacobsen | first3 = E.| title = Do cisgenic plants warrant less stringent oversight?| journal = Nature Biotechnology| volume = 24| issue = 7| pages = 753| year = 2006| pmid = 16841052| doi = 10.1038/nbt0706-753}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people believe that cisgenesis should not face as much regulatory oversight as [[genetic modification]] created through transgenesis as it is possible, if not practical, to transfer alleles among closely related species even by traditional crossing. The primary biological advantage of cisgenesis is that it does not disrupt favorable heterozygous states, particularly in asexually propagated crops such as potato, which do not breed true to seed. One application of cisgenesis is to create [[potato blight|blight]] resistant potato plants by transferring known resistance loci wild genotypes into modern, high yielding varieties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Jacobsen | first1 = E.| last2 = Schouten | first2 = H.

The Dutch government has proposed to exclude cisgenic plants from the European GMO Regulation, in view of the safety of cisgenic plants compared to classically bred plants, and their contribution to durable food production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rijksoverheid.nl/ministeries/ienm/documenten-en-publicaties/brieven/2014/01/07/brief-aan-eurocommissaris-d-d-18-december-2013-over-nieuwe-veredelingstechnieken-in-de-biotechnologie.html|title=

[[File:Columbus Control Center at DLR Oberpfaffenhoffen (8182061318).jpg|thumb|Interior of the Columbus Control Centre.]]
The '''Columbus Control Centre''' is the [[Mission Control Center]] which is used to control the [[ESA|European]] [[Columbus (ISS module)|''Columbus'']] research laboratory, which is part of the [[International Space Station]] (ISS). The control centre is located at the [[German Aerospace Center]] (DLR) facility in [[Oberpfaffenhofen]] near [[Munich]], [[Germany]]. The centre is operated by the DLR, under contract from the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA).

The Columbus Control Centre entered full-time operation during the [[STS-122|STS-122 Shuttle Mission]], which delivered the [[Columbus (ISS module)|Columbus]] module to the ISS.  The module was attached to the ISS on 11 February 2008.

== Identification and call sign ==
The Columbus Control Centre is known by the acronym COL-CC.  The crew on board the [[International Space Station]] use the call sign 'Munich' when calling down to COL-CC.

== Flight Control Room positions ==
The Col-CC Flight Control Room is permanently staffed by three full times positions, COL FLIGHT, STRATOS (a merger of COL SYSTEMS and COL DMS), and GC.  These are supported by COMET during the day 7 days a week as well as EUROCOM and COSMO during crew wake times, Monday to Friday.  COL FLIGHT is responsible for real time Columbus Operations and reports to ISS FLIGHT at [[MCC-H]].  COMET (formerly COL OC (Operations Coordinator)) coordinates Payload operations and real time planning as part of the EPIC team.  STRATOS controls the onboard power, thermal and environmental subsystems plus the onboard data and video subsystems.  EUROCOM is the interface to the [[International Space Station]] crew, communicating over the space to ground loops.  COSMO (COlumbus Stowage and Maintenance Officer) is responsible for inventory management, on-orbit  maintenance and Plug in Plan.

== Support to USOCs and ATV missions ==
The Columbus Control Centre is also responsible for providing the [[Ground Segment]] Services for all European manned space flight activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.esa.int/esaHS/ESAOYJ0VMOC_iss_2.html | title = ESA Control Centres | publisher = ESA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This includes connecting the User Support Operations Centres (USOCs) with the Columbus Control Centre, and routing data for the [[Automated Transfer Vehicle]]s (ATVs) to the ATV Control Centre located in Toulouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cnes.fr/web/3679-atv-cc.php | title = ATV-CC | publisher = CNES}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[ESA]] will use the ATVs to bring supplies and future science experiments to the ISS. The Columbus Control Centre, "will supervise the ISS-based tasks of the unmanned European space transporter ATV."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dlr.de/iss/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-1417/2048_read-3535/ | title = Columbus Control Center - Europe's link to the ISS | publisher = DLR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12496">'''Computer audition''' (CA) or '''machine listening''' is general field of study of [[algorithm]]s and systems for audio understanding by machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.igi-global.com/book/machine-audition-principles-algorithms-systems/40288|title= Machine Audition: Principles, Algorithms and Systems }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://epubs.surrey.ac.uk/596085/1/Wang_Preface_MA_2010.pdf |title= Machine Audition: Principles, Algorithms and Systems}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the notion of what it means for a machine to "hear" is very broad and somewhat vague, computer audition attempts to bring together several disciplines that originally dealt with specific problems or had a concrete application in mind. The engineer Paris Smaragdis, interviewed in ''Technology Review'', talks about these systems --"software that uses sound to locate people moving through rooms, monitor machinery for impending breakdowns, or activate traffic cameras to record accidents."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/VideoPosts.aspx?id=17438 Paris Smaragdis taught computers how to play more life-like music]&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspired by models of [[Hearing (sense)|human audition]], CA deals with questions of representation, [[transduction (machine learning)|transduction]], grouping, use of musical knowledge and general sound [[semantics]] for the purpose of performing intelligent operations on audio and music signals by the computer. Technically this requires a combination of methods from the fields of [[signal processing]], [[auditory modelling]], music perception and [[cognition]], [[pattern recognition]], and [[machine learning]], as well as more traditional methods of [[artificial intelligence]] for musical knowledge representation.

== Applications ==
Like [[computer vision]] versus image processing, computer audition versus audio engineering deals with understanding of audio rather than processing. It also differs from problems of [[speech recognition|speech understanding by machine]] since it deals with general audio signals, such as natural sounds and musical recordings.

Applications of computer auditions are widely varying, and include search for sounds, [[music genre|genre]] recognition, [[acoustic monitoring]], [[music transcription]], score following, [[audio texture]], [[music improvisation]], emotion in audio and so on.

== Related disciplines ==
Computer Audition overlaps with the following disciplines:
* [[Music Information Retrieval]]: methods for search and analysis of similarity between music signals.
* Auditory Science Analysis: understanding and description of audio sources and events. 
* Machine listening: methods for extracting auditory meaningful parameters from audio signals.
* Computational [[musicology]] and mathematical music theory: use of algorithms that employ musical knowledge for analysis of music data.
* [[Computer music]]: use of computers in creative musical applications.
* Machine musicianship: audition driven interactive music systems.

== Areas of study ==

Since audio signals are interpreted by the human ear-brain system, that complex perceptual mechanism should be simulated somehow in software for "machine listening". In other words, to perform on par with humans, the computer should hear and understand audio content much as humans do. Analyzing audio accurately involves several fields: electrical engineering (spectrum analysis, filtering, and audio transforms); artificial intelligence (machine learning and sound classification);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kelly|first1=Daniel|last2=Caulfield|first2=Brian|title=Pervasive Sound Sensing: A Weakly Supervised Training Approach|journal=IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics|date=Feb 2015|doi=10.1109/TCYB.2015.2396291|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=7035063&amp;tag=1|accessdate=1 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; psychoacoustics (sound perception); cognitive sciences (neuroscience and artificial intelligence);&lt;ref&gt;Hendrik Purwins, Perfecto Herrera, Maarten Grachten, Amaury Hazan, Ricard Marxer, and Xavier Serra. Computational models of music perception and cognition I: The perceptual and cognitive processing chain. Physics of Life Reviews, vol. 5, no. 3, pp. 151-168, 2008. [http://www.mtg.upf.edu/node/938]&lt;/ref&gt; acoustics (physics of sound production); and music (harmony, rhythm, and timbre). Furthermore, audio transformations such as pitch shifting, time stretching, and sound object filtering, should be perceptually and musically meaningful. For best results, these transformations require perceptual understanding of spectral models, high-level feature extraction, and sound analysis/synthesis. Finally, structuring and coding the content of an audio file (sound and metadata) could benefit from efficient compression schemes, which discard inaudible information in the sound.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.media.mit.edu/~tristan/Classes/MAS.945/technical.html Machine Listening Course Webpage at MIT]&lt;/ref&gt; Computational models of music and sound perception and cognition can lead to a more meaningful  representation, a more intuitive digital manipulation and generation of sound and music in musical human-machine interfaces.

The study of CA could be roughly divided into the following sub-problems:
# Representation: signal and symbolic. This aspect deals with time-frequency representations, both in terms of notes and spectral models, including pattern playback and audio texture.
# Feature extraction: sound descriptors, segmentation, onset, [[Pitch detection algorithm|pitch]] and [[Envelope detector|envelope]] detection, [[Pitch class|chroma]], and auditory representations.
# Musical knowledge structures: analysis of [[tonality]], [[rhythm]], and [[harmony|harmonies]].  
# Sound similarity: methods for comparison between sounds, sound identification, novelty detection, segmentation, and clustering. 
# Sequence modeling:  matching and alignment between signals and note sequences. 
# Source separation: methods of grouping of simultaneous sounds, such as multiple pitch detection and time-frequency clustering methods.
# Auditory cognition: modeling of emotions, anticipation and familiarity, auditory surprise, and analysis of musical structure.
# Multi-modal analysis: finding correspondences between textual, visual, and audio signals.

=== Representation issues ===
Computer audition deals with audio signals that can be represented in a variety of fashions, from direct encoding of digital audio in two or more channels to symbolically represented synthesis instructions. Audio signals are usually represented in terms of [[analog recording|analogue]] or [[Digital data|digital]] recordings. Digital recordings are samples of acoustic waveform or parameters of [[Audio compression (data)|audio compression]] algorithms. One of the unique properties of musical signals is that they often combine different types of representations, such as graphical scores and sequences of performance actions that are encoded as [[MIDI]] files.

Since audio signals usually comprise multiple sound sources, then unlike speech signals that can be efficiently described in terms of specific models (such as source-filter model), it is hard to devise a [[parameter|parametric]] representation for general audio. Parametric audio representations usually use [[filter bank]]s or [[Sine wave|sinusoid]]al models to capture multiple sound parameters, sometimes increasing the representation size in order to capture internal structure in the signal. Additional types of data that are relevant for computer audition are textual descriptions of audio contents, such as annotations, reviews, and visual information in the case of audio-visual recordings.

=== Features ===
Description of contents of general audio signals usually requires extraction of features that capture specific aspects of the audio signal. Generally speaking, one could divide the features into signal or mathematical descriptors such as energy, description of spectral shape etc., statistical characterization such as change or novelty detection, special representations that are better adapted to the nature of musical signals or the auditory system, such as logarithmic growth of sensitivity ([[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]]) in frequency or [[octave]] invariance (chroma).

Since parametric models in audio usually require very many parameters, the features are used to summarize properties of multiple parameters in a more compact or salient representation.

=== Musical knowledge ===
Finding specific musical structures is possible by using musical knowledge as well as supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. Examples of this include detection of tonality according to distribution of frequencies that correspond to patterns of occurrence of notes in musical scales, distribution of note onset times for detection of beat structure, distribution of energies in different frequencies to detect musical chords and so on.

=== Sound similarity and sequence modeling ===
Comparison of sounds can be done by comparison of features with or without reference to time. In some cases an overall similarity can be assessed by close values of features between two sounds. In other cases when temporal structure is important, methods of dynamic time warping need to be applied to "correct" for different temporal scales of acoustic events. Finding repetitions and similar sub-sequences of sonic events is important for tasks such as texture synthesis and machine improvisation.

=== Source separation ===
Since one of the basic characteristics of general audio is that it comprises multiple simultaneously sounding sources, such as multiple musical instruments, people talking, machine noises or animal vocalization, the ability to identify and separate individual sources is very desirable. Unfortunately, there are no methods that can solve this problem in a [[wikt:robust|robust]] fashion. Existing methods of source separation rely sometimes on correlation between different audio channels in [[multi-channel recording]]s. The ability to separate sources from stereo signals requires different techniques than those usually applied in communications where multiple sensors are available. Other source separation methods rely on training or clustering of features in mono recording, such as tracking harmonically related partials for multiple pitch detection.

=== Auditory cognition ===
Listening to music and general audio is commonly not a task directed activity. People enjoy music for various poorly understood reasons, which are commonly referred to the emotional effect of music due to creation of expectations and their realization or violation. Animals attend to signs of danger in sounds, which could be either specific or general notions of surprising and unexpected change. Generally, this creates a situation where computer audition can not rely solely on detection of specific features or sound properties and has to come up with general methods of adapting to changing auditory environment and monitoring its structure. This consists of analysis of larger repetition and [[self-similarity]] structures in audio to detect innovation, as well as ability to predict local feature dynamics.

=== Multi-modal analysis ===
Among the available data for describing music, there are textual representations, such as liner notes, reviews and criticisms that describe the audio contents in words. In other cases human reactions such as emotional judgements or psycho-physiological measurements might provide an insight into the contents and structure of audio. Computer Audition tries to find relation between these different representations in order to provide this additional understanding of the audio contents.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1976">'''Constant air volume''' ('''CAV''') is a type of heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning ([[HVAC]]) system.  In a simple CAV system, the supply air flow rate is constant, but the supply air temperature is varied to meet the thermal loads of a space.&lt;ref&gt;Systems and Equipment volume of the ''[[ASHRAE Handbook]]'', ASHRAE, Inc., Atlanta, GA, 2004{{page needed|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most CAV systems are small, and serve a single thermal zone.  However, variations such as CAV with reheat, CAV multizone, and CAV primary-secondary systems can serve multiple zones and larger buildings.

In mid- to large-size buildings, new central CAV systems are somewhat rare.  Due to fan energy savings potential, [[variable air volume]] (VAV) systems are more common.  However, in small buildings and residences, CAV systems are often the system of choice due to their simplicity, low cost, and reliability.  Such small CAV systems often have ''on/off control'', rather than supply air temperature modulation, to vary their heating or cooling capacities.

There are two types of CAV systems that are commonly in use to modify the supply air temperature: the terminal reheat system and the mixed air system.

The terminal reheat system cools the air in the air handling unit down to the lowest possible needed temperature within its zone of spaces.  This supplies a comfortable quality to the space, but wastes energy.

The mixed air system has two air streams, typically one for the coldest and one for the hottest needed air temperature in the zone.  The two air streams are strategically combined to offset the space's load.  The mixed air system option is not as proficient at controlling the humidity, yet it does do well at controlling the temperature.&lt;ref&gt;Heating/Piping/Air Conditioning, December 1993 p.53-57{{full|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Critical thermal maximum''', in [[zoology]], is the temperature for a given species above which most individuals respond with unorganized locomotion, subjecting the animal to likely death.&lt;ref&gt;R.W. McDiarmid, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; This concept is particularly relevant in periods of [[aestivation]] or [[wikt:quiescence|quiescence]], in which circumstances an organism experiences limited mobility and lacks the ability to seek a [[microhabitat]] of reduced thermal stress.

'''DEC64''' is a [[decimal floating point]] format proposed by [[Douglas Crockford]] for storing integer and decimal numbers in a computer. Its aim is to sidestep the rounding errors common to the widespread [[IEEE 754]] format. Crockford released in 2014 a [[reference implementation]] as [[public domain software]] on [[GitHub]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/douglascrockford/DEC64/commit/ae7ae10d1501f64cc54affb74ffbecdd6a0f8af5 DEC64 reference implementation] on [[github.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example ==

In [[Javascript]] (which implements [[IEEE 754]]), the expression &lt;code&gt;0.1 + 0.2&lt;/code&gt; will have a result which is not exactly &lt;code&gt;0.3&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="javascript"&gt;
console.log(0.1 + 0.2)
/* 0.30000000000000004 */

console.log(0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3)
/* false */
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

DEC64 attempts to solve such cases while maintaining desirable properties of IEEE 754.

== Representation ==

DEC64 represents numbers as 64 bit values composed of two parts:
* the least-significant 8 bits contain the ''exponent'';
* the remaining 56 bits contain the ''coefficient''.
Both parts are [[two's complement]]s, such that the exponent will be between &lt;code&gt;-127&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;127&lt;/code&gt;, and the coefficient will be between &lt;code&gt;-36028797018963968&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;36028797018963967&lt;/code&gt;.

The value of a number is given by:

:''value = coefficient * 10&lt;sup&gt;exponent&lt;/sup&gt;''

There are 255 possible representations of zero. They are all considered to be equal.

There is a special value called '''''[[NaN]]''''' ("''not a number''") that has a coefficient of 0 and an exponent of -128. The result of division by zero is ''nan''. ''nan'' is also the result of operations that produce results that are too large to be represented. ''nan'' is equal to itself.

When an arithmetic operation has an input with an exponent of -128, the result will be ''nan''.

Integers can have an exponent of 0 as long as the coefficient is less than 36 quadrillion. One interesting property of DEC64 is that an [[Integer (computer science)|integer]] number can be easily converted to DEC64 simply by [[Bitwise operation#Bit shifts|shifting]] it left 8 bits.

== Reception ==
The proposal saw no widespread response or implementation up to now. Some argue, the benefits are too small to be worthwhile over wide-spread used floating-point formats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.aventine.se/2014/03/09/a-silly-review-of-dec64.html A silly review of dec64] by Jens Nockert on aventine.se (March 09, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="966">In [[telecommunication]], the term '''degree of start-stop distortion''' has the following meanings: 

# In [[asynchronous serial communication]] [[data transmission]], the ratio of (a) the [[absolute value]] of the maximum measured difference between the actual and theoretical intervals separating any [[significant instant]] of [[modulation]] (or [[demodulation]]) from the significant instant of the start element immediately preceding it to (b) the [[Unit interval (data transmission)|unit interval]]. 
# The highest absolute value of individual [[distortion]] affecting the significant instants of a [[start-stop modulation]]. 

The degree of distortion of a start-stop modulation (or demodulation) is usually expressed as a percentage. Distinction can be made between the degree of late (positive) distortion and the degree of early (negative) distortion.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21529">'''Eco-costs''' are the costs of the environmental burden of a product on the basis of prevention of that burden. They are the costs which should be made to reduce the [[environmental pollution]] and [[Resource depletion|materials depletion]] in our world to a level which is in line with the [[carrying capacity]] of our earth.

For example: for each 1000&amp;nbsp;kg [[Greenhouse effect|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission]], one should invest €116,- in [[Offshore wind power|offshore windmill park]]s (plus in the other CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction systems at that price or less). When this is done consequently, the total CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions in the world will be reduced by 65% compared to the emissions in 2008. As a result, global warming will stabilise. In short: "the eco-costs of 1000kg CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are € 116,-".

[[Image:Ecocosts system (new).png|center|thumb|upright=3|Fig 1: Calculation structure of the eco-costs 2012 and 2017.]]

Similar calculations can be made on the environmental burden of [[Ocean acidification|acidification]], [[eutrophication]], [[summer smog]], [[fine dust]], [[eco-toxicity]], and the use of metals, [[Rare-earth mineral|rare earth]]s, [[fossil fuel]]s, water and [[land consumption|land]] (nature).
As such, the eco-costs are '[[external costs]]', since they are not yet integrated in the real life costs of current production chains ([[Whole-life cost|Life Cycle Costs]]). The eco-costs should be regarded as hidden [[obligation]]s.

The eco-costs of a product are the sum of all eco-costs of emissions and use of resources during the life cycle "[[Cradle to Cradle Design|from cradle to cradle]]". The widely accepted method to make such a calculation is called [[life cycle assessment]] (LCA), which is basically a mass and energy balance, defined in the ISO 14040, and the ISO 14044 (for the building industry the EN 15804).

The practical use of eco-costs is to compare the [[sustainability]] of several product types with the same functionality. 
The advantage of eco-costs is that they are expressed in a standardized [[value (economics)|monetary value]] (€) which appears to be easily understood 'by instinct'. Also the calculation is transparent and relatively easy, compared to damage based models which have the disadvantage of extremely complex calculations with subjective weighting of the various aspects contributing to the overall environmental burden.&lt;ref&gt;M.

In 2007 the system has been updated, and published in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;J.G. Vogtländer; [http://www.vssd.nl/hlf/b004.htm ''EVR, LCA-based assessment of sustainability''], VSSD, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The next updates were in 2012 and 2017. It is planned to update the system every 5 years to incorporate the latest developments in science.&lt;br /&gt; 
The concept of eco-costs has been made operational with general databases of the Delft University of Technology, and is described at [http://www.ecocostsvalue.com www.ecocostsvalue.com].&lt;br /&gt; The method of the eco-costs is based on the sum of the marginal prevention costs (end of pipe as well as system integrated) for toxic emissions related to human health as well as ecosystems, emissions that cause [[global warming]], and [[resource depletion]] (metals, rare earths, fossil fuels, water, and land-use). For a visual display of the system see Figure 1.

Marginal prevention costs of toxic emissions are derived from the so-called prevention curve as depicted in Figure 2. The basic idea behind such a curve is that a country (or a group of countries, such as the European Union), must take prevention measures to reduce toxic emissions (more than one measure is required to reach the target). From the point of view of the economy, the cheapest measures (in terms of euro/kg) are taken first. At a certain point at the curve, the reduction of the emissions is sufficient to bring the concentration of the pollution below the so-called no-effect-level. The no-effect-level of {{CO2}} emissions is the level that the emissions and the natural absorption of the earth are in equilibrium again at a maximum temperature rise of 2 degrees C. The no-effect-level of a toxic emission is the level where the concentration in nature is well below the toxicity threshold (most natural toxic substances have a toxicity threshold, below which they might even have a beneficial effect), or below the natural background level. For human toxicity the '[[no-observed-adverse-effect level]]' is used.
The eco-costs are the marginal prevention costs of the last measure of the prevention curve to reach the no-effect-level. See the abovementioned references 4 and 8 for a full description of the calculation method (note that in the calculation 'classes' of emissions with the same 'midpoint' are combined, as explained below).

The classical way to calculate a 'single indicator' in LCA is based on the damage of the emissions. Pollutants are grouped in 'classes', multiplied by a 'characterisation' factor to account for their relative importance within a class, and totalised to the level of their 'midpoint' effect ([[Greenhouse effect|global warming]], [[Multi-effect Protocol|acidification]], nutrification, etc.). The classical problem is then to determine the relative importance of each midpoint effect. In damage based systems this is done by 'normalisation' (= comparison with the pollution in a country or a region) and 'weighting' (= giving each midpoint a weight, to take the relative importance into account) by an expert panel.

The calculation of the eco-costs is based on classification and characterisation tables as well (combining tables from IPCC ([http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch2s2-10-2.html]), the [[USEtox]] model ([http://usetox.org usetox.org]), tables of the [[ILCD]] ([http://lct.jrc.ec.europa.eu/pdf-directory/LCIA-CF-20-02-2013-clean.pdf]), however has a different approach to the normalisation and weighting steps. Normalisation is done by calculating the marginal prevention costs for a region (i.e. the European Union), as described above. The weighting step is not required in the eco-costs system, since the total result is the sum of  the eco-costs of all midpoints.
The advantage of such a calculation is that the marginal prevention costs are related to the cost of the most expensive [[Best Available Technology]] which is needed to meet the target, and the corresponding level of  [[Emissions trading|Tradable Emission Rights]] which is required in future. From a business point of view, the eco-costs are the costs of non-compliance with future governmental regulations. Example from the past: NOx emissions of Volkswagen diesel.

The eco-costs have been calculated for the situation in the European Union. It is expected that the situation in some states in the USA, like California and Pennsylvania, give similar results. It might be argued that the eco-costs are also an indication of the marginal prevention costs for other parts of the globe, under the condition of a [[level playing field]] for production companies.

==Eco-costs 2017==
The method of the eco-costs 2017 (version 1.3) comprises tables of over 36.000 emissions, and has been made operational by special database for SimaPro: Idematapp 2018 and Idemat2018 (based on LCIs from Ecoinvent V3.4), Agri Footprint, and a database for CES (Cambridge Engineering Selector). Over 10.000 materials and processes are covered in total. Excel look-up tables are provided at [http://www.ecocostsvalue.com www.ecocostsvalue.com].

For emissions of toxic substances, the following set of multipliers (marginal prevention costs) is used in the eco-costs 2017 system:
{|

|  acidification || 8.75 €/kg SOx equivalent

|-

|}

The characterisation ('midpoint') tables which are applied in the eco-costs 2017 system, are recommended by the ILCD:&lt;ref&gt;Characterization factors of the ILCD Recommended Life Cycle Impact Assessment methods, ILCD [http://lct.jrc.ec.europa.eu/pdf-directory/LCIA-CF-20-02-2013-clean.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
* IPPC 2013, 100 years, for greenhouse gasses
* USETOX 2, for human toxicity (carcinogens), and ecotoxicity
* ILCD, for acidification, eutrification, and photochemical oxidant formation (summer smog)
* UNEP/SETAC 2016,&lt;ref&gt;Global Guidance for Life Cycle Impact assessment Indicators Volume 1, United Nations Environment Programme, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;, for fine dust PM2.5 (for PM10 the default factors are used of the ILCD Midpoint+)

In addition to abovementioned eco-costs for emissions, there is a set of eco-costs to characterize the 'midpoints' of resource depletion:
* eco-costs of abiotic scarcity (metals, including rare earth, and fossil fuels)
* eco-costs of land-use change (based on [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]], of vascular plants and mammals, used for eco-costs of tropical hardwood)
* eco-costs of water scarcity (based on the midpoint Water Stress Indicator - WSI - of countries &lt;ref&gt;Boulay, Bulle, Bayart, Deschênes, and Margni; Regional Characterization of Freshwater Use in LCA: Modeling Direct Impacts on Human Health; Environmental Science &amp; Technology, 2011, 45, pp 8948 - 8957&lt;/ref&gt;)
* eco-costs of landfill

The abovementioned marginal prevention costs at midpoint level can be combined to 'endpoints' in three groups, plus global warming as a separate group:
{|
|-
| eco-costs of human health       ||= the sum of carcinogens, summer smog, fine dust
|-
| eco-costs of ecosystems         || = the sum of acidification, eutrophication, ecotoxicity
|-
| eco-costs of resource scarcity || = the sum of abiotic depletion, land-use, water, and land-fill
|-
| eco-costs of global warming     || = the sum of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and other greenhouse gases (the GWP 100 table) 
|-
| total eco-costs    || = the sum of human health, ecosystems, resource scarcity and global warming
|}

Since the endpoints have the same monetary unit (e.g. euro, dollar), they are added up to the total eco-costs without applying a 'subjective' weighting system. This is an advantage of the eco-costs system (see also ISO 14044 section 4.4.3.4 and 4.4.5). 
So called 'double counting' (ISO 14044 section 4.4.2.2.3) is avoided in the eco-costs system.

The eco-costs of global warming (also called eco-costs of carbon footprint) can be used as an indicator for the [[carbon footprint]]. The eco-costs of resource depletion can be regarded as an indicator for 'circularity' in the theory of the [[circular economy]]. However, it is advised to include human toxicity and eco-toxicity, and include the eco-costs of global warming in the calculations on the circular economy as well. The eco-costs of global warming are required to reveal the difference between fossil-based products and bio-based products, since biogenic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is not counted in LCA (biogenic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is part of the natural recycle loop in the biosphere).
Therefore,  total eco-costs can be regarded as a robust indicator for [[cradle-to-cradle]] calculations in LCA for products and services in the theory of the circular economy.
Since the economic viability of a business model is also an important aspect of the circular economy, the added value of a product-service system should be part of the analysis. This requires the two dimensional approach of Eco-efficient Value Creation &lt;ref&gt;Joost G. Vogtländer, A. Mestre, R. van der Helm, A. Scheepens and R. Wever; [http://www.vssd.nl/hlf/b021.htm ''Eco-efficient Value creation, sustainable design and business strategies''], VSSD, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; as described at the Wikipedia page on the model of the [[eco-costs value ratio|ecocosts/value ratio]], EVR.

The Delft University of Technology has developed a single indicator for S-LCA as well, the so-called s-eco-costs, to incorporate the sometimes appalling working conditions in production chains (e.g. production of garments, mining of metals). Aspects are the low [[List of minimum wages by country|minimum wages in developing countries]] (the "[[living wage|fair wage]] deficit"), the aspects of "[[child labour]]" and [[extreme poverty]]", the aspect of "excessive working hours", and the aspect of "OSH ([[Occupational Safety and Health]])". The s-eco-costs system has been published in the Journal of Cleaner Production.&lt;ref&gt;Natascha M. van der Velden and Joost G. Vogtländer; Monetisation of external socio-economic costs of industrial production: A social-LCA-based case of clothing production; Journal of Cleaner Production, 2017, 153, pp 320 - 330&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention costs versus damage costs==
Prevention measures will decrease the costs of the damage, related to environmental pollution. The damage costs are in most cases the same (or a bit higher) compared to the prevention costs. So the total effect of prevention measures on our society is that it results in a better environment at no extra costs.

==Discussion==
There are many 'single indicators' for LCA. Basically, they fall into three categories:
* single issue
* damage based
* prevention based

The best known 'single issue' indicator is the [[carbon footprint]]: the total emissions of kg CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, or kg CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''equivalent'' (taking methane and some other [[greenhouse gas]]ses into account as well). The advantage of a single issue indicator is, that its calculation is simple and transparent, without any complex assumptions. It is easy as well to communicate to the public. The disadvantage is that is ignores the problems caused by other pollutants and it is not suitable for cradle-to-cradle calculations (because materials depletion is not taken into account).&lt;br /&gt;
The most common single indicators are damage based. This stems from the period of the 1990s, when LCA was developed to make people aware of the damage of production and consumption. The advantage of damage based single indicators is, that they make people aware of the fact that they should consume less, and make companies aware that they should produce cleaner. The disadvantage is that these damage based systems are very complex, not transparent for others than who make the computer calculations, need many assumptions, and suffer from the subjective weighting procedure as last step at the end. Communication of the result is not easy, since the result is expressed in 'points' (attempts to express the results in money were never very successful, because of methodological flaws and uncertainties). The most recent endpoint indicators avoid the last step to a single indicator: UseTOX 2 and ReCiPe 2016, resulting in 2 respectively 3 endpoints (human health, ecosystems and resources separately).&lt;br /&gt;
Prevention based indicators, like the system of the eco-costs, are relatively new. The advantage, in comparison to the damage based systems, is that the calculations are relatively easy and transparent, and that the  results can be explained in terms of money and in measures to be taken. The system is focused on the decision taking processes of architects, business people, designers and engineers. The advantage is that it provides 1 single endpoint in euro's. The disadvantage is that the system is not focused on the fact that people should consume less.

The eco-costs are calculated for the situation of the European Union, but are applicable worldwide under the assumption of a level playing field for business, and under the precautionary principle. There are two other prevention based systems, developed after the introduction of the eco-costs, which are based on the local circumstances of a specific country:
* In the Netherlands, 'shadow prices' have been developed in 2004 by TNO/MEP on basis of a local prevention curve: it are the costs of the most expensive prevention measure required by the Dutch government for each midpoint.  It is obvious that such costs are relevant for the local companies, but such a shadow price system doesn't have any meaning outside the Netherlands, since it is not based on the no-effect-level
* In Japan, a group of universities have developed a set of data for maximum abatement costs (MAC, similar to the midpoint multipliers of the eco-costs as given in the previous section), for the Japanese conditions. The development of the MAC method started in 2002 and has been published in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Tosihiro Oka, Masanobu Ishikawa, Yoshifumi Fujii, Gjalt Huppes; Calculating Cost-effectiveness for Activities with Multiple Environmental Effects Using the Maximum Abatement Cost Method; Journal of Industrial Ecology, Volume 9, Issue 4, pages 97–103, October 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The so-called avoidable abatement cost (AAC) in this method is comparable to the eco-costs.

Emotional regulation is a complex process that involves [[Initiation|initiating]], inhibiting, or modulating one's state or [[Behavior#Psychology|behavior]] in a given situation{{spaced ndash}}for example the subjective experience (feelings), cognitive responses (thoughts), emotion-related physiological responses (for example heart rate or hormonal activity), and emotion-related behavior (bodily actions or expressions). Functionally, emotional regulation can also refer to processes such as the tendency to focus one's attention to a task and the ability to suppress inappropriate behavior under instruction. Emotional regulation is a highly significant function in human life.

Every day, people are continually exposed to a wide variety of potentially arousing [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]]. Inappropriate, extreme or unchecked emotional reactions to such stimuli could impede functional fit within society; therefore, people must engage in some form of emotion regulation almost all of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Koole, S. L. (2009). The psychology of emotion regulation: An integrative review. (23 ed., Vol. 1, pp. 4-41). Psychology Press. Retrieved from http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02699930802619031&lt;/ref&gt; Generally speaking, [[emotional dysregulation]] has been defined as difficulties in controlling the influence of emotional [[arousal]] on the organization and quality of thoughts, actions, and interactions. Individuals who are emotionally dysregulated exhibit patterns of responding in which there is a mismatch between their goals, responses, and/or modes of expression, and the demands of the [[social environment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zeman | first1 = J. | last2 = Cassano | first2 = M. | last3 = Perry-Parrish | first3 = C. | last4 = Stegall | first4 = S. | year = 2006 | title = Emotion regulation in children and adolescents | url = | journal = Journal of Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 155–168 | doi=10.1097/00004703-200604000-00014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, there is a significant association between emotion dysregulation and symptoms of [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[anxiety]], [[Eating disorder|eating pathology]], and [[substance abuse]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Aldao, A., Nolen-Hoeksema, S., &amp; Schweizer, S.

New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==

===Process model===
The process model of emotion regulation is based upon the modal model of emotion. The modal model of emotion suggests that the emotion generation process occurs in a particular sequence over time. This sequence occurs as follows:
#Situation: the sequence begins with a situation (real or imagined) that is emotionally relevant.
#[[Attention]]: attention is directed towards the emotional situation.
#[[Cognitive appraisal|Appraisal]]: the emotional situation is evaluated and interpreted.
#Response: an emotional response is generated, giving rise to loosely coordinated changes in experiential, behavioral, and physiological response systems.
Because an emotional response (4.) can cause changes to a situation (1.), this model involves a feedback loop from (4.) Response to (1.) Situation. This feedback loop suggests that the emotion generation process can occur recursively, is ongoing, and dynamic.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Gross, J. J. &amp; Thompson, R. A. (2007). Emotion regulation: Conceptual foundations. In J. J. Gross (Ed.), ''Handbook of Emotion Regulation'' (pp. 3-24). New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The process model contends that each of these four points in the emotion generation process can be subjected to regulation. From this conceptualization, the process model posits five different families of emotion regulation that correspond to the regulation of a particular point in the emotion generation process. They occur in the following order:&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gross | first1 = J. J. | year = 1998 | title = The emerging field of emotion regulation: An integrative review | url = | journal = Review of General Psychology | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 271–299 | doi=10.1037/1089-2680.2.3.271}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Situation selection
#Situation modification
#Attentional deployment
#Cognitive change
#Response modulation
The process model also divides these emotion regulation strategies into two categories: antecedent-focused and response-focused. Antecedent-focused strategies (i.e., situation selection, situation modification, attentional deployment, and cognitive change) occur before an emotional response is fully generated. Response-focused strategies (i.e., response modulation) occur after an emotional response is fully generated.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gross | first1 = J. J. | year = 1998 | title = Antecedent- and response-focused emotion regulation: Divergent consequences for experience, expression, and physiology | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 74 | issue = | pages = 224–237 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.74.1.224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategies==

===Situation selection===
Situation selection involves choosing to avoid or approach an emotionally relevant situation. If a person selects to avoid or disengage from an emotionally relevant situation, he or she is decreasing the likelihood of experiencing an emotion. Alternatively, if a person selects to approach or engage with an emotionally relevant situation, he or she is increasing the likelihood of experiencing an emotion.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Typical examples of situation selection may be seen interpersonally, such as when a parent removes his or her child from an emotionally unpleasant situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fox | first1 = N. A. | last2 = Calkins | first2 = S. D. | year = 2003 | title = The development of self-control of emotion: Intrinsic and extrinsic influences | url = | journal = Motivation and Emotion | volume = 27 | issue = 1| pages = 7–26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of situation selection may also be seen in psychopathology. For example, avoidance of social situations to regulate emotions is particularly pronounced for those with [[social anxiety disorder]]&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wells | first1 = A. | last2 = Papageorgiou | first2 = C. | year = 1998 | title = Social phobia: Effects of external attention on anxiety, negative beliefs, and perspective taking | url = | journal = Behavior Therapy | volume = 29 | issue = | pages = 357–370 | doi=10.1016/s0005-7894(98)80037-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[avoidant personality disorder]].&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Effective situation selection is not always an easy task. For instance, humans display difficulties [[Affective forecasting|predicting their emotional responses]] to future events. Therefore, they may have trouble making accurate and appropriate decisions about which emotionally relevant situations to approach or to avoid.&lt;ref&gt;Loewenstein, G. (2007). Affect regulation and affective forecasting. In J. J. Gross (Ed.), ''Handbook of Emotion Regulation ''(pp.180-203). New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Situation modification===
Situation modification involves efforts to modify a situation so as to change its emotional impact.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Situation modification refers specifically to altering one's external, physical environment. Altering one's "internal" environment to regulate emotion is called cognitive change.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Attentional deployment===
Attentional deployment involves directing one's attention towards or away from an emotional situation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

====Distraction====
[[Distraction]], an example of attentional deployment, is an early selection strategy, which involves diverting one's attention away from an emotional stimulus and towards other content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sheppes | first1 = G. | last2 = Gross | first2 = J.

====Rumination====
[[Rumination (psychology)|Rumination]], an example of attentional deployment,&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; is defined as the passive and repetitive focusing of one's attention on one's symptoms of distress and the causes and consequences of these symptoms. Rumination is generally considered to be a maladaptive emotion regulation strategy, as it tends to exacerbate emotional distress. It has also been implicated in a host of disorders including [[Major depressive disorder|major depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nolen-Hoeksema | first1 = S. | last2 = Wisco | first2 = B. E. | last3 = Lyubomirsky | first3 = S. | year = 2008 | title = Rethinking rumination | url = | journal = Perspectives on Psychological Science | volume = 3 | issue = 5| pages = 400–424 | doi=10.1111/j.1745-6924.2008.00088.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Worry====
[[Worry]], an example of attentional deployment,&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; involves directing attention to thoughts and images concerned with potentially negative events in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Borkovec | first1 = T. D. | last2 = Robinson | first2 = E. | last3 = Pruzinsky | first3 = T. | last4 = DePree | first4 = J.

D. | last2 = Inz | first2 = J. | year = 1990 | title = The nature of worry in generalized anxiety disorder: A predominance of thought activity | url = | journal = Behaviour Research and Therapy | volume = 28 | issue = 2| pages = 153–158 | doi=10.1016/0005-7967(90)90027-g}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Thought suppression====
[[Thought suppression]], an example of attentional deployment, involves efforts to redirect one's attention from specific thoughts and mental images to other content so as to modify one's emotional state.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Campbell-Sills, L. &amp; Barlow, D. H. (2007). Incorporating emotion regulation into conceptualizations and treatments of anxiety and mood disorders. In J. J. Gross (Ed.), ''Handbook of Emotion Regulation'' (pp. 542-559). New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Although thought suppression may provide temporary relief from undesirable thoughts, it may ironically end up spurring the production of even more unwanted thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wegner | first1 = D. M. | last2 = Zanakos | first2 = S. | year = 1994 | title = Chronic thought suppression | url = | journal = Journal of Personality | volume = 62 | issue = | pages = 615–640 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.1994.tb00311.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This strategy is generally considered maladaptive, being most associated with [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]].&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

===Cognitive change===
Cognitive change involves changing how one appraises a situation so as to alter its emotional meaning.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

====Reappraisal====
Reappraisal, an example of cognitive change, is a late selection strategy, which involves reinterpreting the meaning of an event so as to alter its emotional impact.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; For example, this might involve reinterpreting an event by broadening one's perspective to see "the bigger picture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schartau | first1 = P. E. | last2 = Dalgleish | first2 = T. | last3 = Dunn | first3 = B.

As opposed to distraction, individuals show a relative preference to engage in reappraisal when facing stimuli of low negative emotional intensity because these stimuli are relatively easy to appraise and process.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Reappraisal is generally considered to be an adaptive emotion-regulation strategy. Compared to suppression, which is correlated negatively with many psychological disorders,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; reappraisal can be associated with better interpersonal outcomes, and can be positively related to wellbeing.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Gross, James |author2=John, Oliver |title=Individual differences in two emotion regulation processes: Implications for affect, relationships, and well-being|pmid=12916575|url=http://doi.apa.org/journals/psp/85/2/348.pdf|year=2003|volume=85|issue=2|pages=348–62|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.85.2.348}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some researchers argue that context is important when evaluating the adaptiveness of a strategy, suggesting that in some contexts reappraisal may be maladaptive.&lt;ref name="Tamir, M. 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tamir | first1 = M | year = 2009 | title = What do people want to feel and why?

====Distancing====
Distancing, an example of cognitive change, involves taking on an independent, third-person perspective when evaluating an emotional event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ochsner | first1 = K. N. | last2 = Gross | first2 = J. J. | year = 2008 | title = Cognitive emotion regulation: Insights from social, cognitive, affective neuroscience | url = | journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 17 | issue = 2| pages = 153–158 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2008.00566.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Distancing has been shown to be an adaptive form of self-reflection, facilitating the emotional processing of negatively valenced stimuli,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ayduk | first1 = O. | last2 = Kross | first2 = E. | year = 2009 | title = Asking why from a distance facilitates emotional processing: A reanalysis of Wimalaweera and Moulds (2008) | url = | journal = Behaviour Research and Therapy | volume = 47 | issue = | pages = 88–92 | doi=10.1016/j.brat.2008.06.014}}&lt;/ref&gt; reducing emotional and cardiovascular reactivity to negative stimuli, and increasing problem-solving behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ayduk | first1 = O. | last2 = Kross | first2 = E. | year = 2010 | title = From a distance: Implications of spontaneous self-distancing for adaptive self-reflection | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 98 | issue = 5| pages = 809–829 | doi=10.1037/a0019205 | pmid=20438226 | pmc=2881638}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Humor====
[[Humor]], an example of cognitive change, has been shown to be an effective emotion regulation strategy. Specifically, positive, good-natured humor has been shown to effectively upregulate positive emotion and downregulate negative emotion. On the other hand, negative, mean-spirited humor is less effective in this regard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Samson | first1 = A. C. | last2 = Gross | first2 = J. J. | year = 2012 | title = Humour as emotion regulation: The differential consequences of negative versus positive humour | url = | journal = Cognition and Emotion | volume = 26 | issue = 2| pages = 375–384 | doi=10.1080/02699931.2011.585069}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response modulation===
Response modulation involves attempts to directly influence experiential, behavioral, and physiological response systems.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

====Expressive suppression====
[[Expressive Suppression|Expressive suppression]], an example of response modulation, involves inhibiting emotional expressions. It has been shown to effectively reduce facial expressivity, subjective feelings of positive emotion, heart rate, and [[Sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic activation]]. However, the research is mixed regarding whether this strategy is effective for downregulating negative emotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dan-Glauser | first1 = E. S. | last2 = Gross | first2 = J. J. | year = 2011 | title = The temporal dynamics of two response-focused forms of emotion regulation: Experiential, expressive, and autonomic consequences | url = | journal = Psychophysiology | volume = 48 | issue = | pages = 1309–1322 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-8986.2011.01191.x| pmc = 3136552 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has also shown that expressive suppression may have negative social consequences, correlating with reduced personal connections and greater difficulties forming relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Butler | first1 = E. A. | last2 = Egloff | first2 = B. | last3 = Wlhelm | first3 = F. H. | last4 = Smith | first4 = N. C. | last5 = Erickson | first5 = E. A. | last6 = Gross | first6 = J. J. | year = 2003 | title = The social consequences of expressive suppression | url = | journal = Emotion | volume = 3 | issue = 1| pages = 48–67 | doi = 10.1037/1528-3542.3.1.48 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Expressive suppression is generally considered to be a maladaptive emotion-regulation strategy. Compared to reappraisal, it is correlated positively with many psychological disorders,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; associated with worse interpersonal outcomes, is negatively related to wellbeing,&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; and requires the mobilization of a relatively substantial amount of cognitive resources.&lt;ref name="Richards"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Richards|first=Jane|title=The Cognitive Consequences of Concealing Feelings|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|date=August 2004|volume=13|issue=4|pages=131–134|doi=10.1111/j.0963-7214.2004.00291.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some researchers argue that context is important when evaluating the adaptiveness of a strategy, suggesting that in some contexts suppression may be adaptive.&lt;ref name="Tamir, M. 2009"/&gt;

====Drug use====
[[Drug]] use, an example of response modulation, can be a way to alter emotion-associated physiological responses. For example, [[Ethanol|alcohol]] can produce [[sedative]] and [[anxiolytic]] effects&lt;ref&gt;Sher, K. J. &amp; Grekin, E. R. (2007). Alcohol and affect regulation. In J. J. Gross (Ed.), ''Handbook of Emotion Regulation'' (pp. 560-580). New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[beta blockers]] can affect sympathetic activation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====Exercise====
[[Exercise]], an example of response modulation, can be used to downregulate the physiological and experiential effects of negative emotions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Regular physical activity has also been shown to reduce emotional distress and improve emotional control.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oaten|first=Megan|author2=Cheng, Ken|title=Longitudinal gains in self-regulation from regular physical exercise|journal=British Journal of Health Psychology|year=2006|volume=11|issue=4|pages=717–733|doi=10.1348/135910706X96481}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sleep====
[[Sleep]] plays a role in emotion regulation, although stress and worry can also interfere with sleep. Studies have shown that sleep, specifically [[REM sleep]], down-regulates reactivity of the [[amygdala]], a brain structure known to be involved in the processing of emotions, in response to previous emotional experiences.&lt;ref name="walker"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Walker |first=Matthew P. |date=March 2009 |title=The Role of Sleep in Cognition and Emotion |url=http://walkerlab.berkeley.edu/reprints/Walker_NYAS_2009.pdf |journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |volume=1156 |pages=168–197 |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04416.x |access-date=25 November 2015 |pmid=19338508}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the flip side, [[sleep deprivation]] is associated with greater emotional reactivity or overreaction to negative and stressful stimuli. This is a result of both increased amygdala activity and a disconnect between the amygdala and the [[prefrontal cortex]], which regulates the amygdala through inhibition, together resulting in an overactive emotional brain.&lt;ref name="walker"/&gt; Due to the subsequent lack of emotional control, sleep deprivation may be associated with depression, [[impulsivity]], and mood swings. Additionally, there is some evidence that sleep deprivation may reduce emotional reactivity to positive stimuli and events and impair [[emotion recognition]] in others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Beattie |first=Louise |last2=Kyle |first2=Simon D. |last3=Espie |first3=Colin A. |last4=Biello |first4=Stephany M. |date=December 2015 |title=Social interactions, emotion and sleep: A systematic review and research agenda |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1087079214001579 |journal=Sleep Medicine Reviews |volume=24 |pages=83–100 |doi=10.1016/j.smrv.2014.12.005 |access-date=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In psychotherapy==

Emotion-regulation strategies are taught, and emotion-regulation problems are treated, in a variety of approaches to [[counseling]] and [[psychotherapy]], including [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT), [[dialectical behavior therapy]] (DBT), [[emotion-focused therapy]] (EFT), and [[mindfulness-based cognitive therapy]] (MBCT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Berking |first1=Matthias |authorlink1=Matthias Berking |last2=Wupperman |first2=Peggilee |last3=Reichardt |first3=Alexander |last4=Pejic |first4=Tanja |last5=Dippel |first5=Alexandra |last6=Znoj |first6=Hansjörg |date=November 2008 |title=Emotion-regulation skills as a treatment target in psychotherapy |journal=[[Behaviour Research and Therapy]] |volume=46 |issue=11 |pages=1230–1237 |doi=10.1016/j.brat.2008.08.005 |pmid=18835479}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Kring |editor1-first=Ann M. |editor2-last=Sloan |editor2-first=Denise M. |date=2010 |title=Emotion Regulation and Psychopathology: A Transdiagnostic Approach to Etiology and Treatment |location=New York |publisher=[[Guilford Press]] |isbn=9781606234501 |oclc=319318901}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infancy===
Intrinsic emotion-regulation efforts during [[infancy]] are believed to be guided primarily by innate physiological response systems.&lt;ref&gt;Derryberr, D., &amp; Rothbart, M. K. (2001). Early temperament and emotional development. In A. F. Kalverboer &amp; A. Gramsbergen (Eds.), ''Handbook of Brain and Behavior in Human Development'' (pp. 967-988). Dordrecht, The Netherlands: Kluwer Academic.&lt;/ref&gt; These systems usually manifest as an approach towards and an avoidance of pleasant or unpleasant stimuli. At three months, infants can engage in self-soothing behaviors like sucking and can reflexively respond to and signal feelings of distress.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;Rothbart, M., Ziaie, H., &amp; O'Boyle, C. (1992). Self-regulation and emotion in infancy. In N. Eisenberg, &amp; R. Fabes (Eds.), ''Emotion and Its Regulation in Early Development'' (pp. 7-23). San Francisco: Jossey-Bass/Pfeiffer.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, infants have been observed attempting to suppress anger or sadness by knitting their brow or compressing their lips.&lt;ref name="Malatesta et. al."&gt;{{cite journal|last=Malatesta|first=C.Z.|author2=Grigoryev, P. |author3=Lamb, C. |author4=Albin, M. |author5=Culver, C. |title=Emotional socialization and expressive development in preterm and full-term infants|journal=Child Development|year=1986|volume=57|pages=316–330|doi=10.2307/1130587|pmid=3956316|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between three and six months, basic [[Motor skills|motor functioning]] and attentional mechanisms begin to play a role in emotion regulation, allowing infants to more effectively approach or avoid emotionally relevant situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kochanska | first1 = G. | last2 = Coy | first2 = K.

Extrinsic emotion-regulation efforts by caregivers, including situation selection, modification, and distraction, are particularly important for infants.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;Calkins, S. D., &amp; Hill, A. (2007). Caregiver influence on emerging emotion regulation: Biological and environmental transactions in early development. In J. J. Gross (Ed.), ''Handbook of Emotion Regulation'' (pp. 229-248). New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The emotion regulation strategies employed by caregivers to attenuate distress or to upregulate positive affect in infants can impact the infants' emotional and behavioral development, teaching them particular strategies and methods of regulation.&lt;ref&gt;Sroufe, L. A. (1996). ''Emotional development: The organization of emotional life in the early years''. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The type of [[Attachment styles|attachment style]] between caregiver and infant can therefore play a meaningful role in the regulatory strategies infants may learn to use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kochanska | first1 = G | year = 2001 | title = Emotional development in children with different attachment histories: The first three years | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 72 | issue = | pages = 474–490 | doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent evidence supports the idea that maternal singing has a positive effect on affect regulation in infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Trehub | first1 = S. E. | last2 = Ghazban | first2 = N. | last3 = Corbeil | first3 = M. | year = 2015 | title = Musical affect regulation in infancy | url = | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1337 | issue = 1| pages = 186–192 | doi=10.1111/nyas.12622 | pmid=25773634}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singing play-songs, such as "The Wheels on the Bus" or "She'll Be Comin' Round the Mountain" have a visible affect-regulatory consequence of prolonged positive affect and even alleviation of distress. In addition to proven facilitation of social bonding, when combined with movement and/or rhythmic touch, maternal singing for affect regulation has possible applications for infants in the NICU and for adult caregivers with serious personality or adjustment difficulties.

===Toddler-hood===
By the end of the first year, [[toddler]]s begin to adopt new strategies to decrease negative arousal. These strategies can include rocking themselves, chewing on objects, or moving away from things that upset them.&lt;ref name="Kopp"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kopp|first=C.B.|title=Regulation of distress and negative emotions|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=1989|volume=25|pages=343–354|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.25.3.343|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; At two years, toddlers become more capable of actively employing emotion regulation strategies.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; They can apply certain emotion regulation tactics to influence various emotional states.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Additionally, maturation of brain functioning and language and motor skills permits toddlers to manage their emotional responses and levels of arousal more effectively.&lt;ref&gt;Rueda, M. R., Posner, M. I., &amp; Rothbart, M. K. (2004). Attentional control and self-regulation. In R. F. Baumeister &amp; K. D. Vohs (Eds.),'' Handbook of self-regulation: Research, theory, and applications ''(pp. 283-300). New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Extrinsic emotion regulation remains important to emotional development in toddlerhood. Toddlers can learn ways from their caregivers to control their emotions and behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kopp | first1 = C. | year = 1989 | title = Regulation of distress and negative emotions: A developmental view | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 25 | issue = | pages = 243–254 | doi=10.1037/0012-1649.25.3.343}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, caregivers help teach self-regulation methods by distracting children from unpleasant events (like a [[vaccination]] shot) or helping them understand frightening events.&lt;ref name="Thompson, 1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thompson|first=R.A.|title=Emotional regulation: A theme in search of definition|journal=Monographs of Society for Research in Child Development|year=1994|volume=59|pages=2–3|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5834.1994.tb01276.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Childhood===
Emotion-regulation knowledge becomes more substantial during childhood. For example, children aged six to ten begin to understand [[display rules]]. They come to appreciate the contexts in which certain emotional expressions are socially most appropriate and therefore ought to be regulated. For example, children may understand that upon receiving a gift they should display a smile, irrespective of their actual feelings about the gift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harris | first1 = P. L. | year = 1983 | title = Children's understanding of the link between situation and emotion | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Child Psychology | volume = 33 | issue = | pages = 1–20 | doi=10.1016/0022-0965(83)90048-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; During childhood, there is also a trend towards the use of more cognitive emotion regulation strategies, taking the place of more basic distraction, approach, and avoidance tactics.&lt;ref&gt;Stegge, H. &amp; Terwog, M. M. (2007). Awareness and regulation of emotion in typical and atypical development. In J. J. Gross (Ed.), ''Handbook of Emotion Regulation'' (pp. 269-286). New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the development of emotion dysregulation in children, one robust finding suggests that children who are frequently exposed to negative emotion at home will be more likely to display, and have difficulties regulating, high levels of negative emotion.&lt;ref name="Caspi et. al, 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Caspi|first=A.|author2=Moffitt, T.E. |author3=Morgan, J. |author4=Rutter, M. |author5=Taylor, A. |author6=Arseneault, L. |author7=Tully, L. |author8=Jacobs, C. |author9=Kim-Cohen, J. |author10=Polo-Tomas, M. |title=Maternal expressed emotion predicts children's antisocial behaviour problems: Using monozygotic-twin differences to identify environmental effects on behavioural development|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=2004|volume=40|pages=149–161|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.40.2.149|pmid=14979757|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eisenberg, Zhou &amp; Koller, 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eisenberg|first=N.|author2=Zhou, Q. |author3=Koller, S. |title=Brazilian adolescents' prosocial moral judgement and behaviour: Relations to sympathy, perspective-taking, gender-role orientation, and demographic characteristics|journal=Child Development|year=2001|volume=72|pages=518–534|doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00294|pmid=11333082|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maughan &amp; Cicchetti"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maughan|first=A.|author2=Cicchetti, D.|title=Impact of child maltreatment and interadult violence on children's emotional regulation abilities and socioemotional adjustements|journal=Child Development|year=2002|volume=73|pages=1525–1542|doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00488|pmid=12361317|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Valiente, Eisenberg &amp; Spinrad, 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Valiente|first=C.|author2=Fabes, R.A. |author3=Eisenberg, N. |author4=Spinrad, T.L. |title=The relations of parental expressivity and support to children's coping with daily stress|journal=Journal of Family Psychology|year=2004|volume=18|pages=97–106|doi=10.1037/0893-3200.18.1.97|pmid=14992613|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adolescence===
[[Adolescence|Adolescents]] show a marked increase in their capacities to regulate their emotions, and emotion-regulation decision making becomes more complex, depending on multiple factors. In particular, the significance of interpersonal outcomes increases for adolescents. When regulating their emotions, adolescents are therefore likely to take into account their social context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zeman | first1 = J. | last2 = Cassano | first2 = M. | last3 = Perry-Parrish | first3 = C. | last4 = Stegall | first4 = S. | year = 2006 | title = Emotion regulation in children and adolescents | url = | journal = Journal of Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics | volume = 27 | issue = 2| pages = 155–168 | doi=10.1097/00004703-200604000-00014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, adolescents show a tendency to display more emotion if they expect a sympathetic response from their peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zeman | first1 = J. | last2 = Garber | first2 = J. | year = 1996 | title = Display rules for anger, sadness, and pain: it depends on who is watching | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 67 | issue = | pages = 957–973 | doi=10.2307/1131873}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, spontaneous use of cognitive emotion-regulation strategies increases during adolescence, which is evidenced both by self-report data&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Garnefski | first1 = N. | last2 = Kraaij | first2 = V. | year = 2006 | title = Relationships between cognitive emotion regulation strategies and depressive symptoms: A comparative study of five specific samples | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 40 | issue = | pages = 1659–1669 | doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2005.12.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and neural markers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Luna | first1 = B. | last2 = Padmanabhan | first2 = A. | last3 = O'Hearn | first3 = K. | year = 2010 | title = What has fMRI told us about the development of cognitive control through adolescence? | url = | journal = Brain and Cognition | volume = 72 | issue = | pages = 101–113 | doi = 10.1016/j.bandc.2009.08.005 | pmc = 2815087 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adulthood===
Social losses increase and health tends to decrease as people age. As people get older their motivation to seek emotional meaning in life through social ties tends to increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Carstensen | first1 = L. A. L. | last2 = Fung | first2 = H. | last3 = Charlse | first3 = S. | year = 2003 | title = Socioemotional selectivity theory and the regulation of emotion in the second half of life | url = | journal = Motivation and Emotion | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 103–123 | doi=10.1023/a:1024569803230}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Autonomic nervous system|Autonomic]] responsiveness decreases with age, and emotion-regulation skill tends to increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lawton | first1 = M. P. | year = 2001 | title = Emotion in later life | url = | journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 20 | issue = | pages = 120–123 | doi=10.1111/1467-8721.00130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview of perspectives==

===Neuropsychological perspective===

====Affective====
As people age, their [[affect (psychology)|affect]]{{spaced ndash}}the way they react to emotions{{spaced ndash}}changes, either positively or negatively. Studies show that positive affect increases as a person grows from adolescence to their mid 70s. Negative affect, on the other hand, decreases until the mid 70s. Studies also show that emotions differ in adulthood, particularly affect (positive or negative). Although some studies found that affect decreases{{Clarify|reason=Becomes less positive / more negative or rather becomes less extreme, i.e., less positive or less negative as applicable?|date=February 2017}} with age, some have concluded that adults in their middle age experience more positive affect and less negative affect than younger adults. Positive affect was also higher for men than women while the negative affect was higher for women than it was for men and also for single people. A reason that older people{{spaced ndash}}middle adulthood{{spaced ndash}}might have less negative affect is because they have overcome, "the trials and vicissitudes of youth, they may increasingly experience a more pleasant balance of affect, at least up until their mid-70s". Positive affect might rise during middle age but towards the later years of life{{spaced ndash}}the 70s{{spaced ndash}}it begins to decline while negative affect also does the same. This might be due to failing health, reaching the end of their lives and the death of friends and relatives.&lt;ref name="Labouvie"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Labouvie-Vief|first=Gisela|title=Dynamic Integration:Affect, Cognition and the Self in Adulthood|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|date=December 2003|volume=12|issue=6|pages=201–206|doi=10.1046/j.0963-7214.2003.01262.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to [[Reference range|baseline]] levels of positive and negative affect, studies have found individual differences in the time-course of emotional responses to [[stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]]. The [[Time|temporal]] dynamics of emotional regulation, also known as affective [[chronometry]], include two key variables in the emotional response process: rise time to peak emotional response, and recovery time to baseline levels of emotion.&lt;ref name="Davidson, R. J. 1998 pp. 307-330"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Davidson, R. J. |title= Affective Style and Affective Disorders: Perspectives from Affective Neuroscience|journal= Cognition and Emotion|volume= 12|year=1998|pages=307–330|doi=10.1080/026999398379628|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of affective chronometry typically separate positive and negative affect into distinct categories, as previous research has shown (despite some correlation) the ability of humans to experience changes in these categories independently of one another.&lt;ref&gt;Ruef, Anna Marie; Levenson, Robert W. Coan, James A. (Ed); Allen, John J. B. (Ed) "Continuous measurement of emotion: The affect rating dial" (2007). Handbook of emotion elicitation and assessment. Series in affective science., New York, NY, US: Oxford University Press, pp. 287–297.&lt;/ref&gt; Affective chronometry research has been conducted on clinical populations with [[anxiety]], [[Mood (psychology)|mood]], and [[personality disorders]], but is also utilized as a measurement to test the effectiveness of different therapeutic techniques (including [[Mindfulness (psychology)|mindfulness]] training) on [[emotional dysregulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Geschwind N.|pmid=21767001|year=2011|last2=Peeters|first2=F|last3=Drukker|first3=M|last4=Van Os|first4=J|last5=Wichers|first5=M|title=Mindfulness training increases momentary positive emotions and reward experience in adults vulnerable to depression: A randomized controlled trial|volume=79|issue=5|pages=618–28|doi=10.1037/a0024595|journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Neurological====
The development of functional [[magnetic resonance imaging|magnetic resonance]] imaging has allowed for the study of emotion regulation on a biological level. Specifically, research over the last decade strongly suggests that there is a neural basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Frank | first1 = DW | last2 = Dewitt | first2 = M | last3 = Hudgens-Haney | first3 = ME | last4 = Schaeffer | first4 = DJ | last5 = Ball | first5 = BH | last6 = Schwarz | first6 = NF | last7 = Hussein | first7 = AA | last8 = Smart | first8 = LM | last9 = Sabatinelli | first9 = D | year = 2014 | title = Emotion regulation: Quantitative meta-analysis of functional activation and deactivation | url = | journal = Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews | volume = 45 | issue = | pages = 202–211 | doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2014.06.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sufficient evidence has correlated emotion regulation to particular patterns of prefrontal activation. These regions include the [[orbit (anatomy)|orbit]]al prefrontal cortex, the ventromedial [[prefrontal cortex]], and the [[dorsolateral]] prefrontal cortex. Two additional brain structures that have been found to contribute are the amygdala and the anterior cingulate cortex. Each of these structures are involved in various facets of emotion regulation and irregularities in one or more regions and/or interconnections among them are affiliated with failures of emotion regulation. An implication to these findings is that individual differences in prefrontal activation predict the ability to perform various tasks in aspects of emotion regulation.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Davidson | first1 = R.J. | last2 = Putnam | first2 = K.M. | last3 = Larson | first3 = C.L. | year = 2000 | title = Dysfunction in the neural circuitry of emotion regulation: A possible prelude to violence | url = | journal = Science | volume = 289 | issue = | pages = 591–594 | doi=10.1126/science.289.5479.591}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sociological===
People intuitively mimic [[facial expressions]]; it is a fundamental part of healthy functioning. Similarities across cultures in regards to [[nonverbal communication]] has prompted the debate that it is in fact a [[universal language]].&lt;ref name="Elfenbein, H. A. 2002"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Elfenbein | first1 = H. A. | last2 = Ambady | first2 = N. | year = 2002 | title = On the universality and cultural specificity of emotion recognition: a meta-analysis | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 128 | issue = 2| pages = 203–235 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.128.2.203 | pmid=11931516}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be argued that emotional regulation plays a key role in the ability to emit the correct responses in social situations. Humans have control over facial expressions both [[conscious mind|consciously]] and [[unconscious mind|unconsciously]]: an intrinsic emotion program is generated as the result of a transaction with the world, which immediately results in an emotional response and usually a facial reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ekman | first1 = P. | last2 = Friesen | first2 = W. V. | last3 = Ancoli | first3 = S. | year = 1980 | title = Facial signs of emotional experience | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 39 | issue = | pages = 1125–1134 | doi=10.1037/h0077722}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a well documented [[phenomenon]] that emotions have an effect on facial expression, but recent research has provided evidence that the opposite may also be true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Izard | first1 = C. E. | year = 1990 | title = Facial expressions and the regulation of emotions | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 58 | issue = 3| pages = 487–498 | pmid = 2182826 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.58.3.487}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This notion would give rise to the belief that a person may not only control his emotion but in fact influence them as well. Emotional regulation focuses on providing the appropriate emotion in the appropriate circumstances. Some theories allude to the thought that each emotion serves a specific purpose in coordinating [[organism]]ic needs with [[Environmental psychology|environmental]] demands (cole 1994). This skill, although apparent throughout all nationalities,&lt;ref name="Elfenbein, H. A. 2002"/&gt; has been shown to vary in successful application at different age groups. In experiments done comparing younger and older adults to the same unpleasant stimuli, older adults were able to regulate their emotional reactions in a way that seemed to avoid negative confrontation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Charles | first1 = S. T. | last2 = Carstensen | first2 = L. L. | year = 2008 | title = Unpleasant situations elicit different emotional responses in younger and older adults | url = | journal = Psychology and Aging | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 495–504 | doi = 10.1037/a0013284 | pmc = 2677442 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings support the theory that with time people develop a better ability to regulate their emotions. This ability found in adults seems to better allow individuals to react in what would be considered a more appropriate manner in some social situations, permitting them to avoid adverse situations that could be seen as detrimental.

====Expressive regulation (in solitary conditions)====
In solitary conditions, emotional regulation can include a minimization-miniaturization effect, in which common outward expressive patterns are replaced with toned down versions of expression. Unlike other situations, in which physical expression (and its regulation) serve a social purpose (i.e. conforming to [[display rules]] or revealing emotion to outsiders), solitary conditions require no reason for emotions to be outwardly expressed (although intense levels of emotion can bring out noticeable expression anyway). The idea behind this is that as people get older, they learn that the purpose of outward expression (to appeal to other people), is not necessary in situations in which there is no one to appeal to.&lt;ref name="Holodynski"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holodynski|first=Manfred|title=The Miniaturization of Expression in the Development of Emotional Self-Regulation|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=2004|volume=40|issue=1|pages=16–28|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.40.1.16|pmid=14700461}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the level of emotional expression can be lower in these solitary situations.

===Stress===
According to Yu. V. Scherbatykh, emotional stress in situations like school examinations can be reduced by engaging in self-regulating activities prior to the task being performed. To study the influence of [[Self-control|self-regulation]] on mental and [[physiological]] processes under exam stress, Shcerbatykh conducted a test with an experimental group of 28 students (of both sexes) and a control group of 102 students (also of both sexes).&lt;ref name=Scherbatykh&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shcherbatykh|first=Yu. V.|title=Self-Regulation of Autonomic Homeostasis in Emotional Stress|journal=Human Physiology|year=2000|volume=26|issue=5|pages=641–642|url=http://www.no-stress.ru/stress/stress_science/emotional_stress_regulation.html|doi=10.1007/BF02760382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the moments before the examination, [[situational]] stress levels were raised in both groups from what they were in quiet states. In the experimental group, participants engaged in three self-regulating techniques (concentration on respiration, general body relaxation, and the creation of a mental image of successfully passing the examination). During the examination, the anxiety levels of the experimental group were lower than that of the control group. Also, the percent of unsatisfactory marks in the experimental group was 1.7 times less than in the control group. From this data, Scherbatykh concluded that the application of self-regulating actions before examinations helps to significantly reduce levels of emotional strain, which can help lead to better performance results.&lt;ref name=Scherbatykh /&gt;

===Decision making===
Identification of our emotional self-regulating process can facilitate in the decision making process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Miclea, M. |author2=Miu, A. |pmid=20364902|title=Emotion Regulation and Decision Making Under Risk and Uncertainty|year=2010|volume=10|issue=2|pages=257–65|doi=10.1037/a0018489|journal=Emotion (Washington, D.C.)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current literature on emotion regulation identifies that humans characteristically make efforts in controlling emotion experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gross, J. J.|pmid=12212647|url=http://sprweb.org/articles/Gross02.pdf|year=2002|title=Emotion regulation: Affective, cognitive, and social consequences|volume=39|issue=3|pages=281–91|journal=Psychophysiology|doi=10.1017/s0048577201393198}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is then a possibility that our present state emotions can be altered by emotional regulation strategies resulting in the possibility that different regulation strategies could have different decision implications.

==Effects of low self regulation==
With a failure in emotional regulation there is a rise in [[psychosocial]] and emotional dysfunctions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bandura, A. |author2=Caprara, G. V. |author3=Barbaranelli, C. |author4=Gerbino, M. |author5=Pastorelli, C. |title=Role of Affective Self-Regulatory Efficacy in Diverse Spheres of Psychosocial Functioning|pmid=12795389 |jstor=3696228|year=2003|volume=74|issue=3|pages=769–82|journal=Child Development|doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00567}}&lt;/ref&gt; caused by traumatic experiences due to an inability to regulate emotions. These traumatic experiences typically happen in grade school and are sometimes associated with [[bullying]]. Children who can't properly self-regulate express their volatile emotions in a variety of ways, including screaming if they don't have their way, lashing out with their fists, or bullying other children. Such behaviors often elicit negative reactions from the social environment, which, in turn, can exacerbate or maintain the original regulation problems over time, a process termed cumulative continuity. These children are more likely to have conflict-based relationships with their teachers and other children. This can lead to more severe problems such as an impaired ability to adjust to school and predicts school dropout many years later. Children who fail to properly self-regulate grow as teenagers with more emerging problems. Their peers begin to notice this "immaturity", and these children are often excluded from social groups and teased and harassed by their peers. This "immaturity" certainly causes some teenagers to become social outcasts in their respective social groups, causing them to lash out in angry and potentially violent ways. Being teased or being an outcast during the teenage years is especially damaging and could lead to a dysfunctional future,{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} which is why it is recommended to foster emotional self-regulation in children as early as possible.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8958">'''Erik Adigard des Gautries''' (1953) is a [[Graphic designer|communication designer]], multimedia artist and educator based in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. A co-founder of M-A-D, a [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]-based design firm. He is a former design contributor to [[Wired magazine]].

== Biography ==
Adigard was born in [[Republic of the Congo]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfmoma.org/artist/Erik_Adigard|title=Erik Adigard|website=SFMOMA|access-date=2016-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; where his father was stationed as a French foreign correspondent. His grandfather is {{ill|Jean Adigard des Gautries|fr}}, a noted historian and a Legion of Honour recipient. When Adigard was ten his family returned to Paris. He began his university studies in English Literature, Semiotics, and Fine Arts in France before coming to the United States to obtain a BFA (1987) in Graphic Design at California College of the Arts (CCA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cca.edu/|title=California College of the Arts|website=cca.edu|access-date=2017-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While a student, Adigard's first designs earned him national awards for their experimental mix of iconography and offset printing techniques. Upon graduation, with [[Patricia McShane]], he established M-A-D—also known as "madxs", a brand and communications design studio. Since creating his first digital images for Macworld magazine in 1989 he has been exploring the limits of the graphic design discipline as it continues to be redefined by shifting relationships with technology and social phenomena. His activities range from branding, print, web, video and multimedia, to consulting and exhibits—always with a concern for conceptual accuracy and creative innovation. {{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

'''Event tree analysis''' ('''ETA''') is a forward, bottom up, logical modeling technique for both success and failure that explores responses through a single initiating event and lays a path for assessing probabilities of the outcomes and overall system analysis.&lt;ref name="Clemments 1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clemens|first=P.L.|author2=Rodney J. Simmons|title=System Safety and Risk Management|journal=NIOSH Instructional Module, A guide for Engineering Educators|date=March 1998|pages=IX-3 - IX-7|publisher=National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|location=Cincinnati,OH}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This analysis technique is used to analyze the effects of functioning or failed systems given that an event has occurred.&lt;ref name="wang69"&gt;Wang, John '' et al.'' (2000). {{Google books|x4Ft7H_2Ik0C|''What Every Engineer Should Know About Risk Engineering and Management,'' p. 69.|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; ETA is a powerful tool that will identify all consequences of a system that have a probability of occurring after an initiating event that can be applied to a wide range of systems including: [[nuclear power plants]], [[spacecraft]], and chemical plants. This technique may be applied to a system early  in the design process to identify potential issues that may arise, rather than correcting the issues after they occur.&lt;ref name=Clifton /&gt; With this forward logic process, use of ETA as a tool in risk assessment can help to prevent negative outcomes from occurring, by providing a risk assessor with the probability of occurrence. ETA uses a type of modeling technique called [[event tree]], which branches events from one single event using [[Boolean logic]].

==History==

The name Event Tree was first introduced during the [[WASH-1400]] nuclear power plant safety study (circa 1974), where the [[WASH-1400]] team needed an alternate method to [[fault tree analysis]] due to the fault trees being too large. Though not using the name event tree, the UKAEA first introduced ETA in its design offices in 1968, initially to try to use whole plant risk assessment to optimize the design of a 500MW Steam Generating Heavy Water Reactor. This study showed ETA condensed the analysis into a manageable form.&lt;ref name="Clemments 1"/&gt; ETA was not initially developed during WASH-1400, this was one of the first cases in which it was thoroughly used.  The UKAEA study used the assumption that protective systems either worked or failed, with the probability of failure per demand being calculated using fault trees or similar analysis methods.  ETA identifies all sequences which follow an initiating event.  Many of these sequences can be eliminated from the analysis because their frequency or effect are too small to affect the overall result.  A paper presented at a CREST symposium in Munich, Germany, in 1971&lt;ref name="wang69"/&gt; shows how this was done.  The conclusions of the US EPA study of the Draft WASH-1400&lt;ref name=Clifton /&gt; acknowledges the role of Ref 1 and its criticism of the Maximum Credible Accident approach used by AEC. MCA sets the reliability target for the containment but those for all other safety systems are set by smaller but more frequent accidents and would be missed by MCA.

In 2009 a risk analysis was conducted on underwater tunnel excavation under the [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]] in [[Korea]] using an earth pressure balance type [[tunnel boring machine]]. ETA was used to quantify risk, by providing the probability of occurrence of an event, in the preliminary design stages of the tunnel construction to prevent any injuries or fatalities because tunnel construction in Korea has the highest injury and fatality rates within the construction category.&lt;ref name="Eun-Soo"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hong|first=Eun-Soo |author2=In-Mo Lee |author3=Hee-Soon Shin |author4=Seok-Woo Nam |author5=Jung-Sik Kong|title=Quantitative risk evaluation based on event tree analysis technique: Application to the design of shield TBM|journal=Tunneling and Underground Space Technology|year=2009|volume=24|pages=269–277|doi=10.1016/j.tust.2008.09.004|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==

Performing a [[probabilistic risk assessment]] starts with a set of initiating events that change the state or configuration of the system.&lt;ref name=Clifton /&gt;  An initiating event is an event that starts a reaction, such as the way a spark (initiating event) can start a fire that could lead to other events (intermediate events) such as a tree burning down, and then finally an outcome, for example, the burnt tree no longer provides apples for food.  Each initiating event leads to another event and continuing through this path, where each intermediate event's probability of occurrence may be calculated by using fault tree analysis, until an end state is reached (the outcome of a tree no longer providing apples for food).&lt;ref name=Clifton /&gt;  Intermediate events are commonly split into a [[binary number|binary]] (success/failure or yes/no) but may be split into more than two as long as the events are [[mutually exclusive]], meaning that they can not occur at the same time. If a spark is the initiating event there is a probability that the spark will start a fire or will not start a fire (binary yes or no) as well as the probability that the fire spreads to a tree or does not spread to a tree.  End states are classified into groups that can be successes or severity of consequences. An example of a success would be that no fire started and the tree still provided apples for food while the severity of consequence would be that a fire did start and we lose apples as a source of food. Loss end states can be any state at the end of the pathway that is a negative outcome of the initiating event. The loss end state is highly dependent upon the system, for example if you were measuring a quality process in a factory a loss or end state would be that the product has to be reworked or thrown in the trash. Some common loss end states:&lt;ref name=Clifton&gt;{{cite book|last=Ericson|first=Clifton A.|title=Hazard Analysis Techniques for System Safety|year=2005|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Loss of Life or Injury/ Illness to personnel&lt;ref name=Clifton /&gt; 
*Damage to or loss of equipment or property (including software)&lt;ref name=Clifton /&gt; 
*Unexpected or collateral damage as a result of tests
*Failure of mission&lt;ref name=Clifton /&gt; 
*Loss of system availability&lt;ref name=Clifton /&gt; 
*Damage to the environment&lt;ref name=Clifton /&gt;

[[File:Event Tree Diagram.JPG|thumbnail|right|Event tree diagram example]]

==Methodology==

The overall goal of event tree analysis is to determine the probability of possible negative outcomes that can cause harm and result from the chosen initiating event. It is necessary to use detailed information about a system to understand intermediate events, accident scenarios, and initiating events to construct the event tree diagram. The event tree begins with the initiating event where consequences of this event follow in a binary (success/failure) manner. Each event creates a path in which a series of successes or failures will occur where the overall probability of occurrence for that path can be calculated. The probabilities of failures for intermediate events can be calculated using [[fault tree analysis]] and the probability of success can be calculated from 1 = probability of success (ps) + probability of failure (pf).&lt;ref name=Clifton /&gt; For example, in the equation 1 = (ps) + (pf) if we know that pf=.1 from fault tree analysis then through simple algebra we can solve for ps where ps = (1) - (pf) then we would have ps =  (1) - (.1) and ps=.9.

The event tree diagram models all possible pathways from the initiating event. The initiating event starts at the left side as a horizontal line that branches vertically. the vertical branch is representative of the success/failure of the initiating event. At the end of the vertical branch a horizontal line is drawn on each the top and the bottom representing the success or failure of the first event where a description (usually success or failure) is written with a tag that represents the path such as 1s where s is a success and 1 is the event number similarly with 1f where 1 is the event number and f denotes a failure (see attached diagram). This process continues until the end state is reached. When the event tree diagram has reached the end state for all pathways the outcome probability equation is written.&lt;ref name="Clemments 1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Clifton /&gt;

Steps to perform an event tree analysis:&lt;ref name="Clemments 1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Clifton /&gt;

#'''Define the system:''' Define what needs to be involved or where to draw the boundaries.
#'''Identify the accident scenarios:''' Perform a system assessment to find hazards or accident scenarios within the system design.
#'''Identify the initiating events:''' Use a [[hazard analysis]] to define initiating events. 
#'''Identify intermediate events:''' Identify [[countermeasures]] associated with the specific scenario.
#'''Build the event tree diagram'''
#'''Obtain event failure probabilities:''' If the failure probability can not be obtained use [[fault tree analysis]] to calculate it.
#'''Identify the outcome risk:''' Calculate the overall probability of the event paths and determine the [[risk]]. 
#'''Evaluate the outcome risk:''' Evaluate the [[risk]] of each path and determine its acceptability.
#'''Recommend corrective action:''' If the outcome [[risk]] of a path is not acceptable develop design changes that change the [[risk]].
#'''Document the ETA:''' Document the entire process on the event tree diagrams  and update for new information as needed.

==Mathematical concepts==

1 = (probability of success) + (probability of failure)

The probability of success can be derived from the probability of failure.

Overall path probability = (probability of event 1) X (probability of event 2) X (probability of event n....)

==In risk analysis==

Event tree analysis can be used in risk assessment by determining the probability that is used to determine the risk when multiplied by the hazard of the event. Event Tree Analysis is a tool that makes easy to see what pathway is creating the greatest probability of failure for a specific system. It is common to find single point failures that do not have any intervening events between the initiating event and a failure. With Event Tree Analysis single point failure can be targeted to include an intervening step that will reduce the overall probability of failure and thus reducing the risk of the system. The idea of adding an intervening event can happen anywhere in the system for any pathway that generates too great of a risk, the added intermediate event can reduce the probability and thus reduce the risk.

==Limitations==
*Addresses only one initiating event at a time.&lt;ref name="Clemments 1" /&gt; 
*The initiating challenge must be identified by the analyst&lt;ref name="Clemments 1" /&gt; 
*Pathways must be identified by the analyst&lt;ref name="Clemments 1" /&gt;

*Success or failure probabilities are difficult to find.&lt;ref name="Clemments 1" /&gt; 
*Can overlook subtle system differences&lt;ref name=Clifton /&gt; 
*Partial successes/failures are not distinguishable&lt;ref name=Clifton /&gt; 
*Requires an analyst with practical training and experience&lt;ref name=Clifton /&gt;

==Software==
Though ETA can be relatively simple, software can be used for more complex systems to build the diagram and perform calculations more quickly with reduction of human errors in the process. There are many types of software available to assist in conducting an ETA. In nuclear industry, RiskSpectrum PSA software is widely used which has both event tree analysis and fault tree analysis. Professional-grade [[free software]] solutions are also widely available. [https://scram-pra.org SCRAM] is an example open-source tool that implements the [https://open-psa.github.io/mef Open-PSA Model Exchange Format] open standard for probabilistic safety assessment applications.

'''Execution by elephant''' was a common method of [[capital punishment]] in [[south Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]], particularly in [[India]], where [[Asian elephant]]s were used to [[Crushing (execution)|crush]], dismember or torture captives in [[public execution]]s. The animals were trained and versatile, able to kill victims immediately or to torture them slowly over a prolonged period. Most commonly employed by royalty, the elephants were used to signify both the ruler's [[absolute monarchy|absolute power]] and his ability to control wild animals.

The sight of elephants executing captives both horrified and attracted the interest of European travellers and was recorded in numerous contemporary journals and accounts of life in Asia. The practice was eventually suppressed by the [[European colonialism|European empires]] that colonised the region in the 18th and 19th centuries. While primarily confined to Asia, the practice was occasionally adopted by [[Western world|Western]] powers, such as [[Ancient Rome]] and [[Carthage]], particularly to deal with mutinous soldiers.

== Cultural aspects ==
The intelligence, domesticability and versatility of the elephant gave it considerable advantages over other wild animals such as [[lion]]s and [[bear]]s used as executioners by the Romans. Elephants are more tractable than [[horse]]s: while a horse can be trained to charge into battle, it will not willingly trample an enemy soldier, and will instead step over him. Elephants will trample their enemies, hence the popularity of [[war elephant]]s with generals such as [[Hannibal]]. Elephants can be trained to execute prisoners in a variety of ways, and can be taught to prolong the agony of the victim by inflicting a slow death by torture or to kill the condemned quickly by stepping on the head.

Historically, the elephants were under the constant control of a driver or ''[[mahout]]'', thus enabling a ruler to grant a last-minute reprieve and display merciful qualities.&lt;ref name="allsen"&gt;Allsen, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; Several such exercises of [[pardon|mercy]] are recorded in various Asian kingdoms. The kings of [[Siam]] trained their elephants to roll the convicted person "about the ground rather slowly so that he is not badly hurt". The [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] [[Emperor]] [[Akbar the Great]] is said to have "used this technique to chastise 'rebels' and then in the end the prisoners, presumably much chastened, were given their lives".&lt;ref name="allsen" /&gt; On one occasion, Akbar was recorded to have had a man thrown to the elephants to suffer five days of such treatment before pardoning him.&lt;ref name="Schimmel"&gt;Schimmel, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Elephants were occasionally used in [[trial by ordeal]] in which the condemned prisoner was released if he managed to fend off the elephant.&lt;ref name="allsen" /&gt;

The use of elephants in such fashion went beyond the common royal power to dispense life and death. Elephants have long been used as symbols of royal authority (and still are in some places, such as [[Thailand]], where [[White elephant (pachyderm)|white elephants]] are held in reverence). Their use as instruments of state power sent the message that the ruler was able to preside over very powerful creatures who were under total command. The ruler was thus seen as maintaining a moral and spiritual domination over wild beasts, adding to their authority and mystique among subjects.&lt;ref name="allsen" /&gt;

== Geographical scope ==
[[File:Execution by elephant distribution map.svg|thumb|right|350px|Geographical scope of executions by elephant]]
Execution by elephant has been done in many parts of the world, by both Western and Eastern empires. The earliest records of such executions date back to the [[Classical antiquity|classical period]]. However, the practice was already well established by that time and continued well into the 19th century. While [[African elephant]]s are significantly larger than [[Asian elephant]]s, African powers were not known to make as much use of the animals in warfare or ceremonial affairs compared to their Asian counterparts.

==== Southeast Asia ====
Elephants are widely reported to have been used to carry out executions in Southeast Asia, and were used in [[Burma]] and [[Malaysia]] from the earliest historical times&lt;ref&gt;Chevers, p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in the kingdom of [[Champa]] on the other side of the [[Indochina|Indochinese]] Peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;Schafer, Edward H. "The Golden Peaches of Samarkand: A Study of T'ang Exotics". University of California Press, 1985. p. 80. ASIN: B0000CLTET&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Siam]], elephants were trained to throw the condemned into the air before trampling them to death.&lt;ref name="allsen" /&gt; [[Alexander Hamilton (sailor)|Alexander Hamilton]] provides the following account from Siam:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hamilton|first=Alexander|pages=181–182|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2YCoCwtJd1gC&amp;pg=181|title=A new account of the East Indies|publisher=John Mosman|volume=2|year=1727|location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|For Treason and Murder, the Elephant is the Executioner. The condemned Person is made fast to a Stake driven into the Ground for the Purpose, and the Elephant is brought to view him, and goes twice or thrice round him, and when the Elephant's Keeper speaks to the monstrous Executioner, he twines his Trunk round the Person and Stake, and pulling the Stake from the Ground with great Violence, tosses the Man and the Stake into the Air, and in coming down, receives him on his Teeth, and making him off again, puts one of his fore Feet on the Carcase, and squeezes it flat.}}

The journal of [[John Crawfurd]] records another method of execution by elephant in the kingdom of [[Cochinchina]] (modern south [[Vietnam]]), where he served as a British envoy in 1821. Crawfurd recalls an event where "the criminal is tied to a stake, and [Excellency's favourite] elephant runs down upon him and crushes him to death."&lt;ref&gt;Crawfurd, John. "Journal of an Embassy from the Governor-general of India to the Courts of Siam and Cochin China". H. Colburn and R. Bentley, 1830.

===== India =====
Elephants were used as executioners of choice in India for many centuries. Hindu and Muslim rulers executed tax evaders, rebels and enemy soldiers alike "under the feet of elephants".&lt;ref name="allsen" /&gt; The Hindu ''[[Manu Smriti]]'' or Laws of Manu, written down around AD 200, prescribed execution by elephants for a number of offences. If property was stolen, for instance, "the king should have any thieves caught in connection with its disappearance executed by an elephant."&lt;ref&gt;Olivelle, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 1305, the [[Delhi Sultanate|sultan of Delhi]] turned the deaths of [[Mongol]] prisoners into public entertainment by having them crushed by elephants.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Weatherford-Genghis Khan, p.116&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] era, "it was a common mode of execution in those days to have the offender trampled underfoot by an elephant."&lt;ref&gt;Natesan, G.A. ''The Indian Review'', p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; Captain [[Alexander Hamilton (sailor)|Alexander Hamilton]], writing in 1727, described how the Mughal ruler [[Shah Jahan]] ordered an offending military commander to be carried "to the Elephant Garden, and there to be executed by an Elephant, which is reckoned to be a shameful and terrible Death".&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[List of Mughal emperors|Mughal Emperor]] [[Humayun]] ordered the crushing by elephant of an [[imam]] he mistakenly believed to be critical of his reign.&lt;ref&gt;Eraly, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Some monarchs also adopted this form of execution for their own entertainment. Another Mughal ruler, the emperor [[Jahangir]], is said to have ordered a huge number of criminals to be crushed for his amusement. The [[France|French]] traveler [[François Bernier]], who witnessed such executions, recorded his dismay at the pleasure that the emperor derived from this cruel punishment.&lt;ref name="Schimmel" /&gt; Nor was crushing the only method used by the Mughals' execution elephants; in the Mughal sultanate of [[Delhi]], elephants were trained to slice prisoners to pieces "with pointed blades fitted to their tusks".&lt;ref name="allsen" /&gt;
The Muslim traveler [[Ibn Battuta]], visiting [[Delhi]] in the 1330s, has left the following eyewitness account of this particular type of execution by elephants:&lt;ref&gt;Battuta, "[https://books.google.com/books?id=IZ5CAAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=intitle:The+intitle:travels+intitle:of+intitle:Ibn+intitle:Battuta&amp;hl=no&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8K36UOuaLImF4gTe4YDoAw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The travels of Ibn Battuta]", transl. Lee, S, London 1829, pp. 146-47&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Upon a certain day, when I myself was present, some men were brought out who had been accused of having attempted the life of the Vizier. They were ordered, accordingly, to be thrown to the elephants, which had been taught to cut their victims to pieces. Their hoofs were cased with sharp iron instruments, and the extremities of these were like knives. On such occasions the elephant-driver rode upon them: and, when a man was thrown to them, they would wrap the trunk about him and toss him up, then take him with the teeth and throw him between their fore feet upon the breast, and do just as the driver should bid them, and according to the orders of the Emperor. If the order was to cut him to pieces, the elephant would do so with his irons, and then throw the pieces among the assembled multitude: but if the order was to leave him, he would be left lying before the Emperor, until the skin should be taken off, and stuffed with hay, and the flesh given to the dogs.}}
Other Indian polities also carried out executions by elephant. The [[Maratha]] [[Chatrapati]]  [[Sambhaji]] ordered this form of death for a number of conspirators, including the Maratha official Anaji Datto in the late seventeenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Eraly, p. 479.&lt;/ref&gt; Another Maratha leader, the general [[Santaji]], inflicted the punishment for breaches in military discipline. The contemporary historian Khafi Khan reported that "for a trifling offense he [Santaji] would cast a man under the feet of an elephant."&lt;ref&gt;Eraly, p. 498&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Le Toru Du MOnde.jpg|thumbnail|[[Louis Rousselet]] described this execution in ''Le Tour du Monde'' in 1868.]]
The early 19th century writer [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] relates how the king of [[Goa]] "keeps certain elephants for the execution of malefactors. When one of these is brought forth to dispatch a criminal, if his keeper desires that the offender be destroyed speedily, this vast creature will instantly crush him to atoms under his foot; but if desired to torture him, will break his limbs successively, as men are [[breaking wheel|broken on the wheel]]."&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, p. 395.&lt;/ref&gt; The naturalist [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]] cited this flexibility of purpose as evidence that elephants were capable of "human reasoning, [rather] than a simple, natural instinct".&lt;ref&gt;Buffon, Georges Louis Leclerc. "Natural history of man, the globe, and of quadrupeds". vol. 1. Leavitt &amp; Allen, 1857. p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

Such executions were often held in public as a warning to any who may transgress. To that end, many of the elephants were especially large, often weighing in excess of nine tons. The executions were intended to be gruesome and often were. They were sometimes preceded by torture publicly inflicted by the same elephant used for the execution. An account of one such torture-and-execution at [[Baroda]] in 1814 has been preserved in ''The Percy Anecdotes'':

{{quote|The man was a slave, and two days before had murdered his master, brother to a native chieftain, called Ameer Sahib. About eleven o'clock the elephant was brought out, with only the driver on his back, surrounded by natives with bamboos in their hands. The criminal was placed three yards behind on the ground, his legs tied by three ropes, which were fastened to a ring on the right hind leg of the animal. At every step the elephant took, it jerked him forward, and every eight or ten steps must have dislocated another limb, for they were loose and broken when the elephant had proceeded five hundred yards. The man, though covered in mud, showed every sign of life, and seemed to be in the most excruciating torments. After having been tortured in this manner for about an hour, he was taken to the outside of the town, when the elephant, which is instructed for such purposes, was backed, and put his foot on the head of the criminal.&lt;ref&gt;Ryley Scott, George. "The Percy Anecdotes vol. VIII". ''The History of Torture Throughout the Ages''. Torchstream Books, 1940. pp. 116–7.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The use of elephants as executioners continued well into the latter half of the 19th century. During an expedition to central India in 1868, [[Louis Rousselet]] described the execution of a criminal by an elephant. A sketch depicting the execution showed the condemned being forced to place his head upon a pedestal, and then being held there while an elephant crushed his head underfoot. The sketch was made into a [[woodcut]] and printed in "[[Le Tour du Monde]]", a widely circulated French journal of travel and adventure, as well as foreign journals such as ''[[Harper's Weekly]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Harper's Weekly'', February 3, 1872&lt;/ref&gt;

The growing power of the [[British Empire]] led to the decline and eventual end of elephant executions in India. Writing in 1914, Eleanor Maddock noted that in [[Kashmir]], since the arrival of Europeans, "many of the old customs are disappearing – and one of these is the dreadful custom of the execution of criminals by an elephant trained for the purpose and which was known by the hereditary name of 'Gunga Rao'."&lt;ref&gt;Maddock, Eleanor. "What the Crystal Revealed". ''American Theosophist Magazine'', April to September 1914. p. 859.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Sri Lanka =====
[[File:Crushed by elephant.png|thumb|right|A condemned prisoner being dismembered by an elephant in [[Ceylon]]. Illustration from ''[[An Historical Relation of the Island Ceylon]]'' by Robert Knox (1681).]]
Elephants were widely used across the [[Indian subcontinent]] and South Asia as a method of execution. The English sailor [[Robert Knox (sailor)|Robert Knox]], writing in 1681, described a method of execution by elephant which he had witnessed while being held captive in [[Sri Lanka]]. Knox says the elephants he witnessed had their [[tusk]]s fitted with "sharp Iron with a socket with three edges". After impaling the victim's body with its tusks, the elephant would "then tear it in pieces, and throw it limb from limb".&lt;ref&gt;Knox, Robert. "[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/14346 An Historical Relation of the Island Ceylon]". London, 1681.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 19th century traveler [[James Emerson Tennent]] comments that "a Kandyan [Sri Lankan] chief, who was witness to such scenes, has assured us that the elephant never once applied his tusks, but, placing his foot on the prostrate victim, plucked off his limbs in succession by a sudden movement of his trunk."&lt;ref&gt;Tennent, p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt; Knox's book depicts exactly this method of execution in a famous drawing, ''An Execution by an Eliphant''.

Writing in 1850, the British diplomat [[Henry Charles Sirr]] described a visit to one of the elephants that had been used by [[Sri Vikrama Rajasinha]], the last king of [[Kandy]], to execute criminals. Crushing by elephant had been abolished by the British after they overthrew the Kandyan kingdom in 1815 but the king's execution elephant was still alive and evidently remembered its former duties. Sirr comments:&lt;ref&gt;Sirr, Sir Charles Henry, quoted in Barrow, George. "Ceylon: Past and Present". John Murray, 1857. pp. 135–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|During the native dynasty it was the practice to train elephants to put criminals to death by trampling upon them, the creatures being taught to prolong the agony of the wretched sufferers by crushing the limbs, avoiding the vital parts. With the last tyrant king of Candy, this was a favourite mode of execution and as one of the elephant executioners was at the former capital during our sojourn there we were particularly anxious to test the creature's sagacity and memory. The animal was mottled and of enormous size, and was quietly standing there with his keeper seated upon his neck; the noble who accompanied us desired the man to dismount and stand on one side.

The chief then gave the word of command, ordering the creature to 'slay the wretch!' The elephant raised his trunk, and twined it, as if around a human being; the creature then made motions as if he were depositing the man on the earth before him, then slowly raised his back-foot, placing it alternately upon the spots where the limbs of the sufferer would have been. This he continued to do for some minutes; then, as if satisfied that the bones must be crushed, the elephant raised his trunk high upon his head and stood motionless; the chief then ordered him to 'complete his work,' and the creature immediately placed one foot, as if upon the man's abdomen, and the other upon his head, apparently using his entire strength to crush and terminate the wretch's misery.}}

==== West Asia ====
During the [[medieval]] period, executions by elephants were used by several West Asian imperial powers, including the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]], [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]], [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq]] and [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] empires.&lt;ref name="allsen" /&gt; When the Sassanid king [[Khosrau II]], who had a harem of 3,000 wives and 12,000 female slaves, demanded as a wife Hadiqah, the daughter of the Christian Arab [[Al-Nu'man III ibn al-Mundhir|Na'aman]], Na'aman refused to permit his Christian daughter to enter the harem of a [[Zoroastrian]]; for this refusal, he was trampled to death by an elephant.

The practice appears to have been adopted in parts of the Muslim Middle East. [[Rabbi]] [[Petachiah of Ratisbon]], a twelfth-century Jewish traveler, reported an execution by this means during his stay in [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk]]-ruled northern [[Mesopotamia]] (modern [[Iraq]]):&lt;ref&gt;Benisch, A. (trans). "Travels of Petachia of Ratisbon". London, 1856.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Execution of Prisonsers Belgrade-Suleymanname.jpg|thumb|[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] miniature depicting the execution of prisoners of war in [[Belgrade|Nándorfehérvár]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Matrakci |last=Nasuh |url=http://warfare.atwebpages.com/Ottoman/Suleymanname/Execution_of_Prisonsers_Belgrade-Suleymanname.htm |title=Execution of Prisoners, Belgrade |date=1588 |work=Süleymanname, Topkapi Sarai Museum, Ms Hazine 1517}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{quote|At [[Nineveh]] there was an elephant. Its head is not protruding. It is big, eats about two wagon loads of straw at once; its mouth is in its breast, and when it wants to eat it protrudes its lip about two [[cubit]]s, takes up the straw with it, and puts it in its mouth. When the sultan condemns anyone to death, they say to the elephant, "this person is guilty." It then seizes him with its lip, casts him aloft and slays him.}}

=== Western empires ===
The [[Roman Empire|Romans]], [[Carthage|Carthaginians]] and [[ancient Macedonians]] occasionally used elephants for executions while also making use of [[war elephant]]s for military purposes, most famously in the case of [[Hannibal]]. Deserters, prisoners of war and military criminals are recorded by ancient chroniclers to have been put to death under the foot of an elephant. [[Perdiccas]], who became regent of [[Macedon]] on the death of [[Alexander the Great]] in 323 BC, had mutineers from the faction of [[Meleager (general)|Meleager]] thrown to the elephants to be crushed in the city of [[Babylon]].&lt;ref&gt;Fox, Robin Lane. "Alexander the Great". Penguin, 2004. p. 474. {{ISBN|0-14-008878-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman writer [[Quintus Curtius Rufus]] relates the story in his Historiae Alexandri Magni: "Perdiccas saw that they [the mutineers] were paralyzed and at his mercy. He withdrew from the main body some 300 men who had followed Meleager at the time when he burst from the first meeting held after Alexander's death, and before the eyes of the entire army he threw them to the elephants. All were trampled to death beneath the feet of the beasts...".&lt;ref&gt;[http://luna.cas.usf.edu/~murray/classes/aa/source22.htm Curt. 10.6-10] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060103055130/http://luna.cas.usf.edu/~murray/classes/aa/source22.htm |date=2006-01-03 }} (registration required)&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the Roman writer [[Valerius Maximus]] records how the general [[Lucius Aemilius Paulus Macedonicus]] "after King [[Perseus of Macedon|Perseus]] was vanquished [in 167 BC], for the same fault (desertion) threw men under elephants to be trampled ... And indeed military discipline needs this kind of severe and abrupt punishment, because this is how strength of arms stands firm, which, when it falls away from the right course, will be subverted."&lt;ref&gt;Futrell, Alison (Quoted by) (ed.). "A Sourcebook on the Roman Games". Blackwell Publishing, 2006. p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are fewer records of elephants being used as straightforward executioners for the civil population. One such example is mentioned by [[Josephus]] and the [[deuterocanonical books|deuterocanonical book]] of [[3 Maccabees]] in connection with the [[Egyptian Jews]], though the story is likely apocryphal. 3 Maccabees describes an attempt by [[Ptolemy IV Philopator]] (ruled 221–204 BC) to enslave and brand Egypt's Jews with the symbol of [[Dionysus]]. When the majority of the Jews resisted, the king is said to have rounded them up and ordered them to be trampled on by elephants.&lt;ref&gt;3 Maccabees 5&lt;/ref&gt; The mass execution was ultimately thwarted, supposedly by the intervention of angels, following which Ptolemy took an altogether more forgiving attitude towards his Jewish subjects.&lt;ref&gt;3 Maccabees 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collins, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Face-Negotiation Theory''' was a theory first proposed by [[Penelope Brown|Brown]] and [[Stephen Levinson|Levinson]] (1978) to understand how people from different cultures manage rapport and disagreements. The theory posits "face", or self-image, as a universal phenomenon that pervades across cultures. In conflicts, one's face is threatened; and thus the person tends to save or restore his or her face. This set of communicative behaviors, according to the theory, is called "facework".  Since people frame the situated meaning of "face" and enact "facework" differently from one culture to the next, the theory poses a cultural-general framework to examine facework negotiation.

==Background==
Face-negotiation theory is primarily based on the research of Brown and Levinson. In this theory, "face" is a metaphor for self-image, which originates from two Chinese conceptualizations: lien and mien-tzu. Lien is the internal moral face that involves shame, integrity, debasement, and honor issues. Mien-tzu, on the other hand, is the external social face that involves social recognition, position, authority, influence and power.&lt;ref&gt;Hu, 1944&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ting-1998&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ting-Toomey|last2=Kurogi|title=Facework competence in intercultural conflict: An updated face-negotiation theory|journal=International Journal of Intercultural Relations|date=1998|volume=22|issue=2|pages=187–225|doi=10.1016/s0147-1767(98)00004-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Erving Goffman]] situated [[Face (sociological concept)|"face"]] in contemporary Western research and conceptualized the terms lien and mien-tzu as identity and ego..&lt;ref&gt;Goffman, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;  He noted that face is a concern for one's projected image that is both immediate and spontaneous and is tied to the dynamics of social interaction.&lt;ref&gt;Rogan &amp; Hammer, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;  Correspondingly, "facework" denotes actions taken to maintain consistency between the self and public line. Further research by Penelope Brown and [[Stephen Levinson]] on [[Politeness theory|politeness]] suggests that the desire for face is a universal concern.&lt;ref&gt;Brown &amp; Levinson, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;West, Turner &amp; Zhao, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Brown and Levinson further suggest that face can refer to two wants of the individual- the positive face that necessitates approval by others and the negative face that requires that one's actions or thoughts are unimpeded by others. Thus participants wants are of more importance than the interaction itself in face saving view of politeness. In fact, researchers Brown and Levinson posit that face is something that "is emotionally invested, and can be lost, maintained, or enhanced, and must be constantly attended to in interaction".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.604.3117&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|title=Download Limit Exceeded|website=citeseerx.ist.psu.edu|access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ting-Toomey expands this thinking and conceptualizes face as an individual's claimed sense of favorable social self-image in a relational and network context.&lt;ref name=Ting-1988&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ting-Toomey|authorlink1=Intercultural conflict styles: A face negotiation theory|editor1-last=Kim|editor1-first=Y.Y.|editor2-last=Gudykunst|editor2-first=W.B.|title=Theories in intercultural communication|date=1988|publisher=Sage|location=Newbury Park, CA|pages=213–238}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facework is defined as clusters of communicative behaviors that are used to enact self-face and to uphold, challenge/threaten, or support the other person's face.&lt;ref name="Ting-1998"/&gt;

With these concepts and frameworks, face-negotiation theory investigates intercultural conflict styles. The perceived or actual conflict differences revolve around three issues: content, relational, and identity.&lt;ref&gt;Wilmot &amp; Hocker, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  Content conflict refers to the substantive issues external to the individual involved. Relational conflict refers to how individuals define, or would like to define, the particular relationship in that particular conflict episode. Identity-based conflict concerns issues of issues of identity confirmation-rejection, respect-disrespect, and approval-disapproval.&lt;ref name=Ting-2005&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ting-Toomey|authorlink1=The matrix of face: An updated face-negotiation theory|editor1-last=Gudykunst|editor1-first=W.B.|title=Theorizing about intercultural communication|date=2005|publisher=Sage|location=Newbury Park, CA|pages=71–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this way, identity issues are tided closely to culture-based face-orientation factors. A face-threatening episode is an identity expectancy violation episode. Thus, the face-negotiation theory views conflict, intercultural conflict in particular, as a situation that demands active facework management from the two interdependent conflict parties.

The theory has gone through multiple iterations since its creation. There is a 1988 version of seven assumptions and 12 propositions,&lt;ref name="Ting-1988"/&gt; a 1998 version of seven assumptions and 32 propositions,&lt;ref name=Ting-1998 /&gt; and most recent the 2005 version of seven assumptions and 24 propositions.&lt;ref name="Ting-2005"/&gt;

==Components==

===Assumptions===
Face and facework are universal phenomena.&lt;ref name=Ting-handbook&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ting-Toomey|authorlink1=Translating conflict face-negotiation theory into practice|editor1-last=Landis|editor1-first=Dan|editor2-last=Bennett|editor2-first=Janet M.|editor3-last=Bennett|editor3-first=Millton J.|title=Handbook of Intercultural Training|date=2004|publisher=Sage|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|pages=217–248}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Face-Negotiation Theory perspective stresses the impact of culture on the situated meaning of face and the enactment of facework. Thus, the theory assumes that:&lt;ref name=Ting-2005 /&gt;
#Communication in all cultures is based on maintaining and negotiating face.
#Face is problematic when identities are questioned.
#Differences in individualistic vs. collectivistic and small vs. large power distance cultures profoundly shape face management.
#Individualistic cultures prefer self oriented facework, and collectivistic cultures prefer other oriented facework.
#Small power distance cultures prefer an "individuals are equal" framework, whereas large power distance cultures prefer a hierarchical framework.
#Behavior is also influenced by cultural variances, individual, relational, and situational factors.
#Competence in intercultural communication is a culmination of knowledge and mindfulness.

===Taxonomies===
Face-negotiation theory primarily deals with five sets of themes: face orientation or concerns, face movements, facework interaction strategies, conflict communication styles, and face content domains.&lt;ref name=Ting-1998 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ting-1988 /&gt; In the 2005 version of theory, the five thematic clusters are referred as "core taxonomies".&lt;ref name=Ting-2005 /&gt;

====Face orientations====

The orientation of face determines the focus with which the face negotiator will direct her or his attention and energy of the conflict messages.&lt;ref name=Ting-2005 /&gt; Because of different concerns, caused by different underlying cultural values, face negotiators may orient towards self-face (one's own image), other face (the other conflict party's image) or mutual face (both parties' image and/or the image of the relationship).&lt;ref name=Ting-1988 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ting-Toomey, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, in [[Individualism|individualist]] cultures, such as the United States, Germany, and Great Britain, there is great value on personal rights, freedoms and the "do it yourself" attitude.  In [[Collectivism|collectivist]] cultures such as Japan, Saudi Arabia, and Colombia, more value is placed on "we" vs. "I".  The needs of the group outweigh the needs of the individual.  One-third of the world lives in an individualist society, while the other two thirds are identified with collectivist cultures.

Face orientation also involves the concept of [[Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory|power distance]].  People from large power distance cultures accept unequal power distributions, are reliant on established hierarchy, and understand that rewards and sanctions are based on social position.  People from small power distance cultures value equal power distributions, symmetric relations, and rewards and sanctions based on performance.  The United States is an example of a small power distance culture, while Japan embodies a large power distance culture.

Drawing on research of [[Geert Hofstede]], face-negotiation theory notes that while individualism and power distance are two separate dimensions, they are correlated. Highly individualistic cultures tend to be low in power distance, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;Hofstede, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

====Face movements====

Face movement refers to the options that a negotiator faces in choosing whether to maintain, defend and/or upgrade self-face versus other-face in a conflict episode. There are four opportunities a mediator has in regards to their concern for self-face, your personal image and other-face, the counterpart's image of themselves that define face movements:
#If there is a high level of concern for both self-face and other-face, the result is mutual-face protection.
#If there is a low level of concern for both self-face and other-face, the result is mutual-face obliteration.
#If there is a high level of concern for self-face but a low level of concern for other-face, the result is self-face defense.
#If there is a high level of concern for other-face but a low level of concern for self-face, the result is other-face defense.

Ting-Toomey asserts that several conditions must be perceived as severe in order for a negotiator to feel his face is threatened; the importance of the culturally approved facework that is violated, feelings of mistrust because of a large distance between cultures, the importance of the conflict topic, the power distance between the two parties, and the perception of the parties as outgroup members are all conditions which must be made salient for face-threatening communication to occur.&lt;ref name=Ting-2005 /&gt; Whether or not a person engages in a conflict depends on how face-threatening the situation is perceived.

In an individualistic culture, the more self-face threatening the conflict, the more likely the individual will engage in an attack.  In a collectivistic culture, where mutual-face concern is important, avoidance of conflict may prevail in order for the situation to be defused. Collectivistic communicators may also require a third-party negotiation to make progress in finding a resolution.

====Facework interaction strategies====

On a broad level, individualistic cultures operate with a more direct, low-context facework with importance placed on verbal communication and nonverbal gestures for emphasis.  Collectivistic cultures operate in a more indirect, high context facework emphasizing nonverbal subtleties.  There are three prevalent facework strategies: dominating, avoiding, and integrating.  Dominating facework is characterized by trying to maintain a credible image with the goal of winning the conflict.  Avoiding facework attempts to preserve harmony in the relationship by dealing with the conflict indirectly.  Integrating facework focuses on content resolution and maintaining the relationship.&lt;ref name=Ting-2005 /&gt;

Along the face concern/orientation dimension, facework is at play before (preventative), during, and after (restorative) the situation.  Preventative facework is an attempt to minimize face-loss before the threat occurs.  Preventative strategies include credentialing, appealing for suspended judgment, pre-disclosure, pre-apology, hedging, and disclaimers.&lt;ref name="Culpach"&gt;Culpach &amp; Metts, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;  Collectivistic cultures tend to employ more preventative strategies than individualistic cultures.  Restorative facework attempts to repair face that was lost.  Restorative strategies include excuses, justifications, direct aggression, humor, physical remediation, passive aggressiveness, avoidance, and apologies.&lt;ref name="Culpach" /&gt;  Individualistic cultures are more likely to use restorative facework than collectivistic cultures.

Facework differs from conflict styles by employing face-saving strategies which can be used prior to, during, or after a conflict episode and can be used in a variety of identity-threatening and identity-protection situations.  These strategies are focused on relational and face identity beyond conflict goal issues.  Conflict styles are specific strategies used to engage or disengage from a conflict situation.  Preventative and restorative face-work strategies are typically employed when one's face is being threatened.

====Conflict communication styles====

Conflict style consists of learned behaviors developed through socialization within one's culture.  Rahim&lt;ref&gt;Rahim, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rahim, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; based his classification of conflict styles into two dimensions.  The first dimension demonstrates the concern for self, how important it is for the individual to maintain their own face or that of their culture (this is rated on a high to low continuum) and the second is concern for others, how important is it to the individual to help them maintain their own face (also rated on a high to low continuum). The two dimensions are combined to create five styles for dealing with conflict. The individual will choose a style of handling conflict based on the importance of saving their face and that of the face of the other. 
#'''Dominating''': One person's position or goal above the other.
#'''Avoiding''': Eluding the conflict topic, the conflict party, or the conflict situation altogether.
#'''Obliging''': High concern for the other person's conflict interest above a person's own interest. 
#'''Compromising''': A give-and-take concession approach in order to reach a midpoint agreement.
#'''Integrating''': A solution closure that involves high concern for one's self and high concern for the other.

In 2000 Ting-Toomey, Oetzel, and Yee-Jung incorporated three additional conflict communication styles to the original five.&lt;ref&gt;Ting-Toomey et al., 2000&lt;/ref&gt; These three have further enhanced conflict communication across cultures.

#'''Emotional Expression'''-Articulating a persons feelings in order to deal with and control conflict.
#'''Third Party Help'''-Resolving conflicts by enlisting additional help to manage communication.
#'''Passive Aggressive'''-Reacting to conflict in a roundabout way, placing blame indirectly.

Other researchers used a different way to group the conflict tactics. Ting-Toomey (1983) grouped strategies into three categories of tactics for handling conflict; integrative, distributive and passive-indirect.

Integrative conflict tactics incorporated integrating and compromising styles and is reflective of mutual-face and the need for a solution. Those who chose this tactic work with the other person involved in the conflict to get the best possible solution for both parties. Examples of Integrative tactics may include listening to the other, respecting their feelings, and providing their own personal viewpoints in a manner that assists in the negotiation.

Distributive conflict tactics use the dominating style of handling conflict, and emphasizes the individuals own power over the other. This style reflects self-face. Passive-indirect conflict tactics are consistent with obliging and avoiding styles of handling conflict and reflects other-face.

====Face content domains====

Face content domains refer to the different topics an individual will engage in facework on. Individuals have different face wants or face needs in a diverse range of communicative situations.&lt;ref name=Ting-2005 /&gt; There are six domains that an individual will operate in:
#'''Autonomy'''-represents our need for others to acknowledge our independence, self-sufficiency, privacy, boundary, nonimposition, control issues, and our consideration of other's autonomy face needs
#'''Inclusion'''-our need to be recognized as worthy companions, likeable, agreeable, pleasant, friendly, cooperative
#'''Status'''-need for others to admire our tangible and intangible assets or resources: appearance, attractiveness, reputation, position, power, and material worth
#'''Reliability'''-need for others to realize that we are trustworthy, dependable, reliable, loyal, and consistent in words and actions
#'''Competence'''-need for others to recognize our qualities or social abilities such as intelligence, skills, expertise, leadership, team-building, networking, conflict mediation, facework, and problem-solving skills
#'''Moral'''-need for others to respect our sense of integrity, dignity, honor, propriety, and morality

===Theoretical propositions===
The heart of Face Negotiation Theories are 24 propositions.  They are based on the seven assumptions and five taxonomies that have been proven in numerous cases and studies.  They describe facework on three levels of communication: cultural, individual, and situational.

''Cultural-level propositions&lt;ref name=Ting-2005 /&gt;''

#Individualistic cultures predominantly express self-face maintenance interests than collectivistic culture members do.
#Collectivistic cultures are more concerned with other-face maintenance than members of individualistic cultures.
#Members of collectivist cultures are more concerned with mutual-face maintenance than individualistic cultures.
#Members of individualistic cultures predominantly use direct and dominating facework strategies in conflict
#Collectivistic cultures tend to use avoidance strategies more than individualistic cultures do.
#Members of collectivistic cultures use more integrative facework strategies than individualistic culture members do.
#Individualistic cultures prefer dominating/competing conflict styles more than collectivistic cultures do.
#Individualistic cultures use more emotionally expressive conflict styles than collectivistic cultures do.
#Individualistic cultures use more aggressive conflict styles than members of collectivistic cultures.
#Collectivistic cultures use more avoidance techniques than members of individualistic cultures.
#Collectivistic cultures use more obliging conflict styles than members of individualistic cultures.
#Collectivistic cultures utilize compromising styles of conflict more than members of individualistic cultures.

''Individual-level propositions&lt;ref name=Ting-2005 /&gt;''

#Independent self is positively associated with self-face concern.
#Interdependent self is positively associated with other-/mutual-face concern.
#Self-face maintenance is associated with dominating/competing conflict style.
#Other-face maintenance is associated with avoiding/obliging conflict style.
#Other-face maintenance is associated with compromising/integrating conflict style.
#Independent self–construal is associated with dominating/competing conflict style.
#Interdependent self-construal is associated with obliging/avoiding.
#Interdependent self-construal is associated with compromising/integrating.
#Bi-construal is associated with compromising/integrating.
#Ambivalent is associated with neglect/third-party.

''Situational-level propositions&lt;ref name=Ting-2005 /&gt;''

#Individualist or independent-self personalities tend to express a greater degree of self-face maintenance concerns and less other-face maintenance concern in dealing with both ingroup and outgroup conflicts situations.
#Collectivist or interdependent-self personalities express a greater degree of other-face concerns with ingroup members and a greater degree of self-face maintenance concerns with outgroup members in intergroup conflict situations.

===Intercultural facework competence===
Reflecting on the final assumption, intercultural facework competence consists of another component of face-negotiation theory. 
Facework competence is conceptualized as an optimal integration of knowledge, mindfulness and communication skills in managing self's and other's face-related concerns.&lt;ref name=Ting-1998 /&gt; To act competently in an intercultural conflict episode, the theory posits that individuals have to enhance their cultural knowledge and mindfulness in applying context-sensitive facework interaction skills.

====Knowledge dimension====

Knowledge here refers to the process of in-depth understanding of  phenomenon via a range of information gained through conscious learning and personal experiences. Building block concepts include: (1) individualism-collectivism, (2) power distance. (3) two contrastive "self/face" models, and (4) facework communication styles.&lt;ref name=Ting-1998 /&gt;

====Mindfulness dimension====

Mindfulness means attending to one's internal assumptions, cognitions and emotions and simultaneously attuning attentively to the other's assumptions, cognitions and emotions while focusing the five senses.&lt;ref&gt;Thich, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; To be mindful of intercultural facework differences, we have to learn to see the unfamiliar behavior from a fresh context.&lt;ref name=Ting-handbook /&gt; Thus, on a general level, mindfulness demands creative thinking and living.

==Applications==
As an intercultural communication theory, face-negotiation theory was first tested in and applied to the field of intercultural training and conflicts. However, researchers from other areas also find this theory applicable and relevant. Recent applications and examinations of the theory include following studies.

===Intercultural conflict training===

One direct application of face-negotiation theory is the design of intercultural conflict training frameworks. Part of the objective of face-negotiation theory, according to Ting-Toomey, is in fact to translate the theory into a viable framework for mindful intercultural conflict training.&lt;ref name=Ting-handbook /&gt;

More specifically, intercultural conflict training revolves around international business negotiation, intercultural conflict mediation, managing intercultural miscommunication, and developing intercultural conflict competencies. Adapting face-negotiation theory, and also in combination with various communication researches such as Critical Incident, Intergroup Negotiation Simulation etc., Ting-Toomey designed a detailed three-day training session. Agenda outline, along with in class activities, lecture themes, and exercises, is provided in her design as well.

===Face concerns in interpersonal conflict===

This study by the author of the theory Stella Ting-Toomey and, Department of communication and Journalism at the University of New Mexico, John G. Oetzel was done in order to discover if face was indeed a factor in determining "culture's influence on conflict behavior" (Ting-Toomey &amp; Oetzel, 2003).  There were 768 people from four different countries who partook in the study. The cultures represented were China, Germany, Japan, and the United States. China and Japan representing the collectivist countries and Germany and the United States as the individualist countries. Each contributor was given a survey in which they were to explain interpersonal conflict.&lt;ref name="Ting-Toomey"&gt;Ting-Toomey &amp; Oetzel, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
The largest findings are as follows.
#"Cultural individualism-collectivism had direct and indirect effects on conflict styles."&lt;ref name="Ting-Toomey" /&gt;
#"Independent self-construal related positively with self-face and interdependent self-construal related positively with other-face."&lt;ref name="Ting-Toomey" /&gt;
#"Self-face related positively with dominating conflict styles and other-face related positively with avoiding and integrating styles."&lt;ref name="Ting-Toomey" /&gt;
#"Face accounted for all of the total variance explained (100% of 19% total explained) in dominating, most of the total variance explained in integrating (70% of 20% total explained) when considering face concerns, cultural individualism-collectivism, and self-construals."&lt;ref name="Ting-Toomey" /&gt;

===Face and facework in conflicts with parents and siblings===

This study implemented by the author of this theory Stella Ting-Toomey, John Oetzel, Martha Idalia Chew-Sanchez, Richard Harris, Richard Wilcox, and Siegfried Stumpf observed how facework in conflict with parents and siblings is affected by culture, self-concept, and power distance. There were 449 people from four different countries and cultures that participated. Germany, Japan, Mexico, and the United States were the countries used in the study. The survey looked at 3 apprehensions of face and 11 behaviors of "facework". The results are as follows.
#"Self-construals had strong effects on face concerns and facework with independence positively associated with self-face and dominating facework and interdependence positively associated with other- and mutual-face and integrating and avoiding facework behaviors."&lt;ref name="Ting-Oetzel"&gt;Ting-Toomey, Oetzel, Chew-Sanchez, Harris, Wilcox, &amp;Stumpf, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
#"Power distance had small, positive effects on self-face, other-face, avoiding facework, and dominating facework."&lt;ref name="Ting-Oetzel" /&gt;
#"National culture had small to medium effects with individualistic, small power distance cultures having more self-face and mutual-face and using more dominating and integrating facework and less avoiding facework."&lt;ref name="Ting-Oetzel" /&gt;
#"Germans have more self-face and used defending more than U.S. Americans."&lt;ref name="Ting-Oetzel" /&gt;
#"Japanese used more expression than Mexicans."&lt;ref name="Ting-Oetzel" /&gt;
#"Individuals in conflict with parents were more likely to use respect and expression and less likely to use aggression, pretend, and third party than individuals in conflict with siblings."&lt;ref name="Ting-Oetzel" /&gt;

===Face negotiation with mothers===

Motherhood of the Construction of "Mommy Identity" – Heisler &amp; Ellis Face Negotiation Theory suggests that, "USA culture simultaneously encourages connection and autonomy among individuals."&lt;ref&gt;Heisler &amp; Ellis, 2008, pp. 448.&lt;/ref&gt; Mothers do not want to be vulnerable so there is a "face" that is developed in the culture of mothers. Heisler and Ellis did a study on the "face" and reasons for face in motherhood. The results portrayed that the main reasons for keeping "face" in a culture of mothers are:

# Acceptance and approval: There is a fear of criticism and rejection by others. There is the avoidance face which deflects others attention. Acceptance face attracts attention.
# Personal Reasons: There are many internal pressures that mothers face. These include the guilt that they do not spend enough time with their children, insecurities and values they have are not being in met, and their self-esteem is low because of the fear of judgment.
# Mentoring/helping others: Mothers put on a face in order to appear as a good mother figure to younger mothers that look up to them. There are cultural expectations that can contribute to personal expectations for how mothers should act. Women's thoughts on mothering are not their own original ideas. They take on a lot of societal pressures. An example would be, if a mother's child acts poorly in public, it makes the mother look bad.

Motherhood and "face": Results from the same study showed that mothers participate in "Mommy face work." Depending on who they are talking to or interacting with. Mothers said to put on their highest face with friends, spouses, mothers and other family members.

===Physician communication in the operating room===
Kristin Kirschbaum applied face-negotiation theory to the [[health communication]] context, and specifically in the operating room environment.&lt;ref&gt;Kirschbaum, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In the research, a survey was administered to anesthesiologists and surgeons at a teaching hospital in the southwestern United States to measure three variables commonly associated with face-negotiation theory: conflict-management style, face concern, and self-construal.
The results strongly support the theory, and significant positive correlations were found between independent self-construal and self-face concern for anesthesiologists and surgeons. Specific to this health communication context, the research shows differences between the two groups of operating-room physicians: surgeons are potentially more other-face oriented and that anesthesiologists are potentially more independently oriented. Further, both anesthesiologists and surgeons recognize the importance of collaboration as surgical team members.

The survey also finds that specific terms were contextually inappropriate for this population, e.g. the terms pride, dignity, or credibility demonstrated a need for error correlation. This suggests unique considerations of language. Along this line of thinking, the research recommends physician communication training to address both unique language considerations and different orientations to face concern and self-construal.

===Safe sex negotiation===
Gust Yep, noticing the potential vulnerability and emotional volatility of sexual interaction, applied face-negotiation theory to the safe sex negotiation context.&lt;ref&gt;Yep, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

The study integrates various components of face-negotiation theory, and eight propositions are derived from empirical testing in intimate communication scenarios including East-West romantic dyads. The research is based on preliminary observations on personal interviews with two Asian women, aiming to predict intimate communication patterns between Asian women and Euro-American men. Specifically, low-high context and individualism-collectivism frameworks are used to draw the eight propositions.

'''&lt;big&gt;Face Saving in Business Request Emails&lt;/big&gt;'''

A study conducted on the exchange of business emails between Chinese &amp; American business associates presented how the structure of email requests affected the person's face &amp; impacted how the associates viewed the request. It was observed that direct requests in an email threatened the face of the recipient &amp; sender. It resulted in loss of face because the recipient was denied autonomy and acted in a socially unacceptable manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&amp;sid=8f3e42a6-3912-425a-b23f-0ea1e50e4b18@sessionmgr4009|title=Saving Face: Reactions to Cultural Norm Violations in Business Request Emai...: EBSCOhost|website=web.a.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Face Threat &amp; Disability ===
A research was conducted to gauge how disabled persons interact with able bodied individuals with regards to protecting one’s face and self-identity. The study considered students with not only physical disability but also disabilities not visually identifiable such as heart conditions and hearing impairment. Those with disabilities were threatened by the way others treated them and hence they chose more face-saving strategies. For instance, communication apprehension was noted in students with a hearing impairment and they reported less disclosure in the conversation. In fact, the study found that disabled students viewed asking help from able bodied individuals as a face threatening act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com.proxy.library.georgetown.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&amp;sid=2994eace-95ee-4ef4-836b-8bc5e3f9b6c9@sessionmgr4010|title=Off-campus Access Login|website=web.a.ebscohost.com.proxy.library.georgetown.edu|access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Responding to Unethical Communication ===
A research in people’s reaction to unethical communication revealed that people use Face Threatening Acts in order to counter the apprehension in communication. According to Bisel et al. (2011), ‘denying unethical communication challenges both positive and negative face of the hearer”. An expression of disapproval threatens a person’s positive face which indicates the hearer’s need for approval and it impacts the person’s negative face because it affects the person’s autonomy. 

The study put forth a research question of associating politeness strategies and unethical communication. The strategies considered were don’t’ do the face threatening act, negative politeness, positive politeness and bald on strategy. The unethical communication was classified as one that was either deceptive, manipulative, exploitative, intrusive or coercive. The ideal strategic responses have been highlighted in the figure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com.proxy.library.georgetown.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&amp;sid=aa4d04da-073a-41a5-8b98-5e9a8ff68e7c@sessionmgr4009|title=Off-campus Access Login|website=web.a.ebscohost.com.proxy.library.georgetown.edu|access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Face Saving in Artwork Reviews ===
A research was conducted to study the use of face saving and face threatening acts in reviewing artwork. For the study, twelve reviews from the periodical Literatūra ir menas (Literature and Art) were randomly selected. The source for the research analysis was between 1970 -1975.

It was observed that reviewers generally had the face of the artist in mind before presenting their reviews. When presenting a negative review, reviewers threatened the positive face of the artist and hence also presented positive feedback in order to ‘save face’ of the artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com.proxy.library.georgetown.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&amp;sid=dbcd0891-58af-4084-a3ba-49718c0532fc@sessionmgr4006|title=Off-campus Access Login|website=web.a.ebscohost.com.proxy.library.georgetown.edu|access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Face Concerns and the Intent to Apologize ===
A study was conducted among 317 Chinese and American participants to determine how the cultural variation between the two affected the intention to apologize. The cultural norms were categorized as the individualistic and collectivist cultures. According to Hofstede (1980), an individualistic culture lays emphasis on the identity of the “I” while collectivist cultures place more importance on the “we” and the harmony in groups. 

Apology, according to Goffman (1971), is the “offender’s device to remedy a social breach and to re-establish social harmony”. This study also took into account culture when trying to understand the intention to apologize. 

The cultural differences were more prominent especially as the intention took into account if the member (whose face was threatened by an act and thus necessities an apology) was an in-group or an out-group member. The study thus found that Chinese participants had a greater intention to apologize especially if their act threatened the positive face of the other individual. On the other hand, the U.S participants had the intention to apologize when their act threatened the negative face of the person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com.proxy.library.georgetown.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&amp;sid=9e9b619e-dd86-400d-a1dc-0de0aa7dd4b9@sessionmgr4007|title=Off-campus Access Login|website=web.a.ebscohost.com.proxy.library.georgetown.edu|access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Faculty of Agronomic and Veterinary Science''' (FSAV) at [[Loyola University of Congo]] dates back to Agro-Veterinary Higher Institute founded by the [[Society of Jesus]] in [[Kinshasa]] in 1994. The purpose of its founding was to further ecologically sound and sustainable food development in the central African region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://7sur7.cd/new/2016/07/oeuvre-des-missionnaires-jesuites-luniversite-loyola-du-congo-lancee-a-kimwenza/|title=Œuvre des missionnaires jésuites : l’Université Loyola du Congo lancée à Kimwenza|date=2016-07-12|work=Le Plus grand site d'info en RDCongo|access-date=2017-10-17|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
With the founding of Loyola University of Congo in 2016, ISAV was one of the two initial faculties in the new university, and was given its present name. FSAV does research in agriculture, veterinary science, and sustainable development, where sustainability involves anthropological, social, and economic factors.{{fact|date=September 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3084">'''Falconer's formula''' is a mathematical [[formula]]  that is used used in [[twin studies]] to estimate the relative contribution of genetics vs. environment to variation in a particular [[trait (biology)|trait]] (that is, the [[heritability]] of the trait)  based on the difference between [[twin]] [[correlation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Weber |first1=Wendell W. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Pharmacogenetics |date=2008 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-971216-8 |pages=107–8 |edition=2nd | chapter = Chapter 5: Genetics in Pharmacology: Twin Studies | chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xvK8BKbeNWAC&amp;pg=PA107 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was first proposed by the Scottish geneticist [[Douglas Scott Falconer|Douglas Falconer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Falconer DS, Mackay TF | title = Introduction to quantitative genetics | date = 1998 | publisher = Longman Group, Ltd. | location = Essex | isbn = 978-0-582-24302-6 | edition = 4th }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The formula is

: H&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 2(r&lt;sub&gt;mz&lt;/sub&gt; - r&lt;sub&gt;dz&lt;/sub&gt;)

where H&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the broad sense heritability, r&lt;sub&gt;mz&lt;/sub&gt; is the (monozygotic, MZ) identical twin correlation, and r&lt;sub&gt;dz&lt;/sub&gt; is the (dizygotic, DZ) [[fraternal twin]] correlation. The correlation of same sex MZ twins is always higher than the DZ twin correlation with various sexes and thus all [[gender differences]] are evaluated as heritable. To avoid this error, only genetic studies comparing MZ twins with the same sex DZ twins are valid. Correlations between A = h&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (additive genetics) and C (common environment) must be included in the derivation shown below.

:''r''&lt;sub&gt;mz&lt;/sub&gt; = ''A'' + ''C'' + 2 Corr(''A'',''C'')

:''r''&lt;sub&gt;dz&lt;/sub&gt; = ½''A'' + ''C'' + 2 Corr(½''A'',''C'')

Falconer's formula is based on assumptions that have been widely criticized as flawed. For example, it only calculates narrow-sense heritability, meaning it assumes that all genetic effects are additive; this assumption does not comport with the functioning of genes in real biological systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gordon H, Trier Moller F, Andersen V, Harbord M | title = Heritability in inflammatory bowel disease: from the first twin study to genome-wide association studies | journal = Inflammatory Bowel Diseases | volume = 21 | issue = 6 | pages = 1428–34 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 25895112 | pmc = 4450891 | doi = 10.1097/mib.0000000000000393 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The formula also overestimates broad-sense heritability due to an overestimation of dominance variance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xvK8BKbeNWAC |title=Pharmacogenetics | edition = 2nd | volume = 55 | series = Oxford Monographs on Medical Genetics |last=Weber |first=Wendell | name-list-format = vanc |date=2008-04-02 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-971216-8 |pages=107–108 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[development studies]], the concept of a [[value chain]] has been used to analyse [[international trade]] in global value chains which comprises “the full range of activities that are required to bring a product from its conception, through its design, its sourced raw materials and intermediate inputs, its marketing, its distribution and its support to the final consumer”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://globalvaluechains.org/concept-tools|title=Concept &amp; Tools - Global Value Chains|website=Globalvaluechains.org|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, when activities must be coordinated across geographies, the term '''global value chain''' ('''GVC''') is used in the development literature. Simply put, the global value chain includes all of the people and activities involved in the production of a good or service and its global level supply, distribution and post sales activities (also known as the [[supply chain]]). GVC is similar to [[Value_chain#Industry-level|Industry Level Value Chain]] but encompasses operations at the global level.

== In development ==
The first references to the GVC concept date from the mid-1990s and were enthusiastic about the upgrading prospects for [[Developing country|developing countries]] that joined them. In his early work based on research on East Asian garment firms, the pioneer in value chain analysis, [[Gary Gereffi]], describes a process of almost ‘natural’ learning and upgrading for the firms that joined GVCs.&lt;ref&gt;Gereffi, G., (1994). The Organisation of Buyer-Driven Global Commodity Chains: How US Retailers Shape Overseas Production Networks. In G. Gereffi, and M. Korzeniewicz (Eds), Commodity Chains and Global Capitalism. Westport, CT: Praeger.&lt;/ref&gt; This echoed the ‘export-led’ discourse of the [[World Bank]] in the ‘[[East Asian Miracle]]’ report based on the East Asian ‘[[Four Asian Tigers|Tigers]]’ success.

This encouraged the World Bank and other leading institutions to encourage developing firms to develop their indigenous capabilities through a process of upgrading technical capabilities to meet global standards with leading multinational enterprises ([[Multinational corporation|MNE]]) playing a key role in helping local firms through transfer of new technology, skills and knowledge.

Wider adoption of [[open source hardware]] technology used for [[digital fabrication]] such as [[3D printers]] like the [[RepRap]] has the potential to partially reverse the trend towards global specialization of production systems into elements that may be geographically dispersed and closer to the end users (localization) and thus disrupt global value chains.&lt;ref&gt; André O. Laplume, Bent Petersen, Joshua M. Pearce, [https://www.academia.edu/27224636/Global_Value_Chains_from_a_3D_Printing_Perspective  Global value chains from a 3D printing perspective],  ''Journal of International Business Studies'' 47(5), 595–609 (2016). doi:10.1057/jibs.2015.47 &lt;/ref&gt;

GVC analysis views “upgrading” as a continuum starting with “process upgrading” (e.g. a producer adopts better technology to improve efficiency), then moves on to “product upgrading” where the quality or functionality of the product is upgraded by using higher quality material or a better quality management system ([[Quality management system|QMS]]), and then on to “functional upgrading” in which the firm begins to design its own product and develops marketing and branding capabilities and begins to supply to end markets/customers directly - often by targeting geographies or customers which are not served by its existing multinational clients). Subsequently, the process of upgrading might also cover inter-sectoral upgrading.&lt;ref name="Humphrey and Schmitz (2004)"&gt;Humphrey, J., and H. Schmitz. 2004. "Chain Governance and Upgrading: Taking Stock". in ''Local Enterprises in the Global Economy'', edited by H. Schmitz, 349–82. Cheltenham: Edward Elgar.&lt;/ref&gt;

This upgrading process in GVCs has been challenged by other researchers – some of whom argue that insertion in global value chains does not always lead to upgrading. Some authors&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey, J. and Schmitz, H. (2000). Governance and Upgrading: Linking Industrial Cluster and Global Value Chain. IDS Working Paper 120, Institute of Development Studies, University of Sussex, Brighton.&lt;/ref&gt; argue that the expected upgrading process might not hold for all types of upgrading. Specifically they argue upgrading into design, marketing and branding might be hindered by exporting under certain conditions because MNEs have no interest in transferring these core skills to their suppliers thus preventing them from accessing global markets (except as a supplier) for first world customer.

=== Current research on governance and its impact from a development perspective ===
There are motivations behind renewed interest in global value chains and the opportunities that they may present for countries in [[South Asia]]. A 2013 report found that looking at the production chain, rather than the individual stages of production, is more helpful. Individual donors with their own priorities and expertise cannot be expected to provide comprehensive response to the needs identified, not to mention the legal responsibilities of many specialist agencies. The research suggests they adjust their priorities and modalities to the way production chains operate, and to coordinate with other donors to cover all trade needs. It calls for donors and governments to work together to assess how aid flows may affect power relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jodie Keane|date=2014|title=''Aid for trade and Global Value Chains: Issues for South Asia''|url=http://www.sawtee.org/publications/Policy-Brief-26.pdf|format=PDF|website=Sawtee.org|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1994 paper, Gereffi identified two major types of [[governance]]. The first were buyer-driven chains, where the lead firms are final buyers such as retail chains and branded product producers such as non-durable final consumer products (e.g., clothing, footwear and food). The second governance type identified by Gereffi were producer-driven chains. Here the technological competences of the lead firms (generally upstream in the chain) defined the chain’s competitiveness.

Current research suggests that GVCs exhibit a variety of characteristics and impact communities in a variety of ways. In a paper that emerged from the deliberations of the GVC Initiative,&lt;ref&gt;Gary Gereffi, John Humphrey, and Timothy Sturgeon, “The governance of global value chains,” ''Review of International Political Economy'', vol. 12, no. 1, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; five GVC governance patterns were identified:
* '''Hierarchical''' chains represent the fully internalised operations of [[Vertical integration|vertically integrated]] firms.
* '''Quasi-hierarchical''' (or '''captive''' chains) involve suppliers or intermediate customers with low levels of capabilities, who require high levels of support and are the subject of well-developed supply chain management from lead firms (often called the chain governor).
* '''Relational''' and '''modular''' chain governance exhibit durable relations between lead firms and their suppliers and customers in the chain, but with low levels of chain governance often because the main suppliers in the chain possess their own unique competences (and/or infrastructure) and can operate independently of the lead firm.
* '''Market''' chains represent the classic arms length relationships found in many [[Commodity market|commodity markets]].

As capabilities in many low- and middle-income economies have grown, chain governance has tended to move away from quasi-hierarchical models toward modular type as this form of governance reduces the costs of supply chain management and allows chain governors to maintain a healthy level of competition in their supply chains. However, whilst it maintains short-term competition in the supply chain, it has allowed some leading intermediaries to develop considerable functional competences (e.g., design and branding). In the long term these have the potential to emerge as competitors to their original chain governor (Kaplinski, 2010).&lt;ref&gt;Kaplinsky, R. (2010), The Role of Standards in Global Value Chains and their Impact on Economic and Social Upgrading, Policy Research Paper 5396, World Bank&lt;/ref&gt;

The theoretical concepts often considered firms as operating in a single value chain (with a single customer). Whilst this was often the case in quasi-hierarchical chains (with considerable customer power) it has become apparent that some firms operate in multiple value chains (subject to multiple forms of governance) and serve both national and international markets and that this plays a role in the development of firm capabilities (Navas-Aleman, 2011;&lt;ref&gt;Navas - Aleman, L. (2011) “The Impact of Operating in Multiple Value Chains for Upgrading: The Case of the Brazilian Furniture and Footwear Industries” World Development Vol. 39(8), pp. 1386 – 1397&lt;/ref&gt; [[UNCTAD]], 2013).&lt;ref name="unctad.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/wir2013_en.pdf|format=PDF|title=World Investment Report 2013: Global Value Chains: Investment and Trade for Development|website=Unctad.org|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Summary of Unctad report: global value chains and development ===
In 2013, [[UNCTAD]] published two reports on GVCs and their contribution to development. They concluded &lt;ref name="unctad.org"/&gt; that:
* GVCs make a significant contribution to international development. Value-added trade contributes about 30% to the [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] of developing countries, significantly more than it does in developed countries (18%) furthermore the level of participation in GVCs is associated with stronger levels of [[List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita|GDP per capita growth]]. GVCs thus have a direct impact on the economy, employment and income and create opportunities for development. They can also be an important mechanism for [[Developing country|developing countries]] to enhance productive capacity, by increasing the rate of adoption of technology and through workforce skill development, thus building the foundations for long-term industrial upgrading.
* However, there are limitations to the GVC approach. Their contribution to the growth may be limited if the work done in-country is relatively low value adding (i.e. contributes only a small part of the total value added for the product or service). In addition there is no automatic process that guarantees diffusion of technology, skill-building and upgrading. Developing countries thus face the risk of operating in permanently low value-added activities. Finally, there are potential negative impacts on the environment and social conditions, including: poor workplace conditions, occupational safety and health, and job security. The relative ease with which the Value Chain Governors can relocate their production (often to lower cost countries) also create additional risks.
* Countries need to carefully assess the pros and cons of GVC participation and the costs and benefits of proactive policies to promote GVCs or GVC-led development strategies. Promoting GVC participation implies targeting specific GVC segments and GVC participation can only form one part of a country’s overall development strategy.
* Before promoting GVC participation, policymakers should evaluate their countries’ trade profiles and industrial capabilities in order to select strategic GVC development paths. Achieving upgrading opportunities through CVCs requires a structured approach that includes:
** embedding GVCs in industrial development policies (e.g. targeting GVC tasks and activities);  
** enabling GVC growth by providing the right framework conditions for trade and FDI and by putting in place the needed infrastructure; and 
** developing firm capabilities and training the local workforce.

==Gender and global value chains==
Gender plays a prominent role in global value chains, because it influences consumption patterns within the United States, and thus affects production on a larger scale. In turn, specific roles within the value chain are also determined by gender, making gender a key component in the process as well. Far more women than men are found in the informal sector, as self-employed workers or subcontractors, while specific jobs and broader fields of work differ between men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carr|first1=Marilyn|last2=Chen|first2=Martha Alter|last3=Tate|first3=Jane|title=Globalization and Home-Based  Workers|journal=Feminist Economics|date=200|volume=6|issue=3|pages=123–42|doi=10.1080/135457000750020164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women in global value chains===
Within the global value chains, it is often women who work in the weakest or most disadvantaged chains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Watson|first1=Bruce|title=Economic Inequality for Women Costs $9tn Globally, study finds|work=The Guardian|date=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sassen|first1=Saskia|title=Globalization and Its Discontents|date=1998|publisher=New Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Natsuda|first1=Kaoru|last2=Goto|first2=Kenta|last3=Thoburn|first3=John|title=Challenges To The Cambodian Garment  Industry In The Global Garment Value Chain|journal=European Journal of Development Research|date=2010|volume=22|issue=4|pages=469–493|doi=10.1057/ejdr.2010.21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barrientos|first1=Stephanie|title=Gender, Flexibility and Global Value Chain|journal=IDS Bulletin|date=22 May 2009|issue=32|pages=83–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carr et al. argue that “the vast majority of subcontract workers or industrial homeworkers, who earn some of the lowest wages worldwide, are women.”

The study of [[real estate development]] at the '''graduate school''' level has taken many forms, giving rise to various educational models in different countries. The decision for individuals pursuing higher education in this field often comes down to choosing between a traditional degree with a focus on [[real estate]] (e.g., [[MBA]] with concentration in real estate) or an interdisciplinary, comprehensive degree (e.g., [[Master of Real Estate Development]]) focused wholly on real estate studies.

Students who opt to study in a full-time Master of Real Estate program, should expect to take courses in topics such as financial analysis, market analysis, contracts and deal-making, construction, design fundamentals,  asset (property) management, construction management, building technology and design fundamentals.  Some programs offer studio, capstone, or workshop courses in which students engage actual real estate development projects. Some also provide access to internships. There is no established accreditation system in the United States in real estate development education, so students should investigate offerings in each program.

While there are many real estate ''finance'' programs available to students around the country, there are only a handful of real estate '''''development''''' graduate programs that tackle the broader educational task of engaging the full range of '''real estate development''' (e.g., Master of Real Estate Development) --from property acquisition to planning and permitting, law and finance, design and construction, and culminating in marketing, commercial leasing, property, portfolio and asset management.

==History==
Historically, graduate level coursework in real estate was limited to a major or minor in business, or training in architecture and urban planning schools. While [[Business school]] programs might emphasize the business side of real estate, MBA students typically lack adequate understanding of real estate principles and processes. Over the last several decades, the real estate industry has matured to one with great complexity and an increasingly institutional ownership structure. The increased complexity of the industry created a demand for practitioners who possessed a comprehensive knowledge of real estate beyond that of traditional MBA generalists. One and two-year graduate level real estate degree programs originated with the founding of the [[New York University]] Real Estate Institute in (1967)&lt;ref name="History and Mission of NYU Schack "&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.scps.nyu.edu/academics/departments/schack/about/history.html| title= History and Mission | publisher= New York University | accessdate=2014-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (now known as the NYU Schack Institute of Real Estate) and in 1983 with the formation of the [[MIT]] [http://mitcre.mit.edu/ Center for Real Estate]. Soon after, other schools followed with [[Harvard University]] (1983) [[Texas A&amp;M University]] (1984), [[Columbia University]] (1985), the [[University of Southern California]] (1986), [[Johns Hopkins University]] (1989), and [[Cornell University]] (1996) all forming professional graduate programs focused solely on real estate education.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

According to the [[Urban Land Institute]], during the mid-1990s strong academic interest in real estate "was never greater, whether for repositioning products, redeveloping inner cities, or developing more affordable housing. Students seemed to be acting on the notion that it's a temporary downturn and graduate school is a good place for the moment."&lt;ref&gt;Urban Land, Teaching Real Estate Today, April 1992, pg. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;  As enrollment grew, real estate programs responded by adding more course offerings to satisfy the demand..{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

In the early 2000s, prior to the [[Great Recession]], the industry again acknowledged increasing need for graduates with superior qualifications — providing the research-based expertise necessary to solve complex problems in contemporary real estate development..{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

The late 2000s saw significant expansion of real estate programs to second-tier universities such as [[George Mason University]], as well as additional coursework added by [[MBA]] programs that commonly did not have an emphasis on real estate. To deal with the complexity of the field and its far-reaching effects, today's industry professionals require advanced training to prepare them to operate in increasingly technical and interrelated areas..{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

As education needs have changed, business schools such as the [[University of Wisconsin]], [[University of Pennsylvania]], and [[University of California, Berkeley]] continue to cater to students interested in the flexibility of an MBA. Wharton's real estate program, for example, takes advantage of being housed in one of the top business schools in the United States and having some of the top real estate professionals in the world as advisers.&lt;ref&gt;Urban Land, October 1991, pg. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

==Graduate-level education rankings in the US==
Rankings for graduate level education are not specifically formal as other professional disciplines. [[MBA]] programs with concentrations in real estate may be ranked according to organizations such as ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' or ''[[Business Week]]'', but are not relative to the depth of the real estate industry studied in an MBA concentration compared with a specialized master's degree in real estate or real estate development. Real estate education has increased in recent years to fill the demand for well-educated practitioners in the industry. However, there has been a great deal of debate on what elements should be an essential part of a graduate program in order to help students succeed in the industry. Rankings have been conducted by editorial board representation of faculty members at university real estate departments, however, these results prove to be ineffective in judging the program as a whole. Many graduate programs utilize adjunct professors or guest speakers from the industry, which do not sit on editorial boards of scholarly real estate journals.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Currently there are no rankings of graduate degree programs in real estate development. The best method to evaluate the various degree programs is through due diligence by individual applicants, including a review of each program's curriculum and how it applies to the students academic and career goals. While there are no formal rankings for graduate real estate education, and programs are subject to greater locational impact factors than are MBA programs (due to regional and local policy influence).{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===ULI Hines Student Competition===

A separate metric to evaluate the success of graduate real estate programs is the review of past winners in the [[Urban Land Institute]] [[Gerald D. Hines]] Student Competition. The Urban Land Institute is a non-profit research and education organization with membership by real estate developers, urban planners, architects and allied professionals. Each year graduate-level students form their own multidisciplinary teams (from real estate, urban planning and business schools) and have two weeks to devise a comprehensive design and development program for a real, large-scale site full of challenges and opportunities. Submissions will consist of boards that include drawings, site plans, tables, and a myriad of market-feasible financial data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uli.org/programs/awards-competitions/hines-student-design-competition/about-the-competition/ |title=Gerald D. Hines Student Urban Design Competition &amp;#124; Urban Land Institute |publisher=Udcompetition.org |date=2013-10-11 |accessdate=2013-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multidisciplinary teams are not limited to including students from [[real estate development]] graduate programs. Students may also come from [[Master of Landscape Architecture]], [[Master of Architecture]], [[Master of Urban Planning]], [[Master of Urban Design]] or [[MBA]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===ARGUS Software University Challenge===
An additional measure of the reputations of graduate real estate programs is the ARGUS Software University Challenge, which has been held in 2009, 2011 and every year thereafter. In the challenge, participating teams from universities around the world are required to simulate a comprehensive real-life development analysis of a fictitious [[commercial real estate]] project by modeling the provided assumptions specifically using ARGUS software. Team submissions are judged by a panel of industry and academic professionals. The winning teams receive cash prizes.

===Kellogg Real Estate Venture Competition===

The Kellogg Real Estate Conference and Venture Competition is hosted by the Guthrie Center for Real Estate Research and the Kellogg Innovation and Entrepreneurship Initiative.  The Conference will provide industry and research updates and relevant market information.  The Venture Competition showcases MBA students, who have the opportunity to pitch to a high-profile panel of judges. The winning team not only receives $100,000 in cash and prizes, but also the opportunity to secure as much as $10,000,000 in equity funding. The primary purpose of the competition is to encourage entrepreneurial real estate ventures. The event also serves as an opportunity to promote top student talent before prominent industry professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/departments/real-estate/events-activities/real-estate-venture-competition/previous.aspx/|title=Previous Competitions - Kellogg School of Management - Northwestern University|website=www.kellogg.northwestern.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== National Real Estate Challenge ===
The National Real Estate Challenge, a 20 team invitation-only real estate case competition hosted annually by the McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas at Austin, is yet another metric to compare graduate real estate programs. The competition tests teams from universities across the United States on issues regarding real estate finance and private equity. The event is sponsored by firms such as [[JP Morgan]], [[Equity Office Properties]], and Hines. The 19 universities that competed in 2014 included: Berkeley, Carnegie Mellon, Chicago, Columbia, Cornell, Georgetown, Michigan, MIT, Northwestern, NYU, Rice, UCLA, UNC-Chapel Hill, USC, UT, Vanderbilt, Wharton, Wisconsin and Yale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/Centers/REFIC/Real-Estate-Challenge.aspx |title=National Real Estate Challenge |publisher=mccombs.utexas.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The CASE at MIT ===
Arguably the most prestigious competition to gauge the quality of graduate real estate programs in the world, the CASE&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aacre.alumgroup.mit.edu/s/1314/clubs-classes-interior.aspx?sid=1314&amp;gid=175&amp;pgid=3053 |title=The CASE - MIT Center for Real Estate Alumni Association |publisher=aacre.alumgroup.mit.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an annual real estate competition that provides current graduate student teams from the world's top universities an opportunity to compete against one another, showcase their knowledge, and learn from each other through the analysis of a complex real world development site. The CASE is organized and hosted by the Alumni Association of the MIT Center for Real Estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mitcre.mit.edu |title=MIT Center for Real Estate |publisher=mitcre.mit.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike other master's degree competitions, The CASE focuses on real estate acquisition, development programming and financial underwriting at the asset level. The competition mimics the professional circumstances and assignments that students interested in real estate finance, acquisitions and development are likely to encounter after graduation. Past finalists included: Harvard, Georgetown, Columbia, Yale, NYU, MIT, Cornell, Wharton at UPenn, London Business School, Cambridge and Hong Kong Institute of Technology.

==Undergraduate real estate education==
As with many [[MBA]] programs, undergraduate real estate education is commonly offered as a concentration, or focused area of study. Very few universities with varying academic reputation offer a bachelor's degree with a concentration in real estate (typically two courses during the senior year). An undergraduate degree in real estate is not a prerequisite for admission to a graduate real estate development program. Students from diverse backgrounds in [[geography]], [[urban planning]], business, economics, [[liberal arts]], architecture or seeking a career change are encouraged to apply.

{{See also| Undergraduate real estate programs}}

==Graduate real estate programs==
There are twenty-one multi-disciplinary real estate programs which focus on the academic study of real estate primarily, the '''Master of Real Estate Development''', while the majority of the other programs typically housed as part of a business school offer a more focused degree on finance and investment. Graduate real estate programs may award any number of degrees (e.g. [[Master of Real Estate Development]], [[Master of Science in Real Estate]], [[Master of Professional Studies in Real Estate]], Master of Design Studies in Real Estate), however, the key is to review each degree curricula independent of their respective naming conventions, as there are broad differences in their content and foci that may not necessarily be reflected in the degree's name.

Two examples of graduate real estate degree naming conventions include:

===Master in Real Estate Development (MRED or MSRED)===
The Master of Real Estate Development degree (MRED) (or sometimes called the Master of Science in Real Estate Development (MSRED)) largely focuses on specific areas within real estate rather than taking a more generalist approach. Areas of concentration may include: [[real estate development]], [[finance]] and [[investment]], [[planning]] and [[policy]], [[infrastructure]] and [[construction]], [[market analysis]], and [[real estate law]]. Students are generally exposed to the full range of functions and most real estate product types (e.g. residential, retail, office, hospitality, and industrial). MRED programs typically teach the subject matter through case studies and field experiences and by way of traditional class lectures. Whether in the context of urban redevelopment, historic preservation, or suburban growth, MRED students learn from both the investor's and developer's perspective, the importance of relevant issues in law, economics, finance, market analysis, negotiation, lease analysis, architecture, planning, and management.&lt;ref&gt;''Urban Land Magazine'' School for Developers, c, D.C.: Urban Institute, March 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Many focus on the entire spectrum of the real estate development process-from dirt-to-deal, finance to façade-and include industry topics presented by leading local and national developers, financiers, and other players in the market. Included in this is the analysis of existing real estate assets and partnership structures.

===Master of Science in Real Estate (MSRE)===
The Master of Science in Real Estate degree (MSRE) often combines learning comprehensive business management skills with the understanding of how real estate markets work. Graduate programs that award a Master of Science in Real Estate degree are sometimes the expansion of real estate courses in a [[Business school]] into a degree of increased specialty or they are organically formed real estate centers within a larger college. Students who complete Master of Science in Real Estate degrees oftentimes go on to careers as real estate "project managers, asset management advisors, analysts, planners, and others." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carey.jhu.edu/academics/master-of-science/ms-in-real-estate-infrastructure |title=Master of Science in Real Estate - Carey School of Business |publisher=carey.jhu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Master of Science in Real Estate degrees are completed in one year though two year options with the opportunity to complete a summer internship between the first and second year are available (e.g. the [[University of Washington]]) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://realestate.washington.edu/academics/masters-of-real-estate/ |title=Master of Science in Real Estate - Runstad Center for Real Estate Studies |publisher=realestate.washington.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Master of Professional Studies in Real Estate is also similarly found here, as it is simply a naming convention at [[Georgetown University]] and [[Cornell University]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===Coursework===
The course work in real estate programs varies among universities. Many programs utilize [[Harvard Business School|HBS]]-style [[case studies]] of complex real estate scenarios to heighten the student's knowledge and strategic decision-making skills. Program lengths range from 30 to 72 credit hours. Programs that have more than 33 hours will sometimes allow its students to add a concentration. A required core curriculum is typical with the core curriculum's size and makeup being largely dependent on the length and focus of the program.

Example core curriculum:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wpcarey.asu.edu/master-real-estate/academics/index.cfm |title=Academics - MRED - W. P. Carey School of Business |publisher=Wpcarey.asu.edu |date=2012-04-03 |accessdate=2013-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601131326/http://wpcarey.asu.edu/master-real-estate/academics/index.cfm |archivedate=June 1, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Real Estate Development Principles
*[[Market Segmentation]] and Analysis
*Real Estate Finance and Analysis
*Real Estate Development Project Management
*Advanced Real Estate Finance
*Real Estate Site Analysis and Design
*Public [[Entitlement]] Process

In addition to the core curriculum, most two-year programs and some one-year programs offer students the opportunity to pursue a concentration, a focus on a specialized area of interest within the real estate industry. Concentrations differ between programs and universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arch.umd.edu/real_estate_development/academics/courses.cfm?p=41 |title=Real Estate Development - Academics - Courses |publisher=arch.umd.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221010354/http://www.arch.umd.edu/real_estate_development/academics/courses.cfm?p=41 |archivedate=December 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some programs, such as the MS in Real Estate Development at [[George Mason University]],&lt;ref name="gmu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://som.gmu.edu/real-estate-development/|title=Masters in Real Estate Development Program – George Mason University|accessdate=2014-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; offer students the opportunity to combine elective coursework from several disciplines including business management, public policy and civil engineering.

=== Design education related to real estate development ===
The practice of real estate development requires practitioners to work with selecting building types and designs, determining appropriate dimensions, programming internal spaces, shaping the site, and appropriately fitting the project to surrounding contexts.  Some programs, including Harvard University's Master of Design and Columbia University's MSRED include design education in the study of real estate development.  A new program established at the University at Buffalo, State University of New York, in 2015 emphasizes a capstone studio-workshop in which a multidisciplinary group of students under faculty supervision engage an actual real estate development problem for organizations acting as clients.&lt;ref name="ap.buffalo.edu"&gt;{{cite web|title = Master of Science specializing in Real Estate Development - B/a+p|url = http://ap.buffalo.edu/real-estate-development.html|website = ap.buffalo.edu|access-date = 2016-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Executive programs in real estate==

Executive degree programs in real estate offer practicing professionals the opportunity to learn while they are working. These programs are distinguished from distance programs through their uniquely blended model of residency classroom experience, distance education modules, and executive field study courses. Classes meet at the beginning of every semester, usually from five to seven days, and then complete the coursework through synchronous webinars, asynchronous discussion boards, and video lectures. [[Executive education]] in real estate is taught at numerous accredited institutions such as [[Auburn University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mred.auburn.edu/ |title=Auburn University Executive MRED |publisher=Mred.auburn.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===List of graduate real estate programs outside the United States===

{{Main| Graduate real estate programs outside the United States}}

A number of universities around the world offer graduate degrees in real estate and related subjects. See the list in [[Graduate real estate programs outside the United States]].

==Nationally recognized research centers==
Real estate programs and alumni donors sponsor research by real estate faculty in numerous areas of real estate including the economics of property markets, the impacts of regulation, and the sources of equity and debt financing. Additional research, in the form of faculty-supervised student thesis work, contributes to a growing inventory of new information. The research program is essential to promoting new knowledge, advancing teaching techniques, and bridging the gap between theory and practice. Not all graduate real estate programs conduct research.

Professionals in real estate often hold degrees in related fields such as [[city planning]], construction management, accounting, property management, architecture or law. One of the most common programs continues to be a [[Master of City Planning]], regional planning, or urban planning degree with a real estate emphasis. Planning programs tend to emphasize land use planning, transportation or infrastructure development, land use law and policy and other planning topics; students who take a concentration in real estate development will learn how it relates to planning.

===MBA with Real Estate Concentration===
Business degrees with real estate concentrations generally provide students with the opportunity to pursue a general management degree, but to specialize in real estate development or some segment of the real estate industry through a sequence or group of electives. For a long time, those wishing to study real estate had to content themselves with primarily pursuing a [[Master of Business Administration]] degree, perhaps with the option of concentration in real estate, and usually with a focus in finance. These [[MBA]] programs typically only include one or two courses focused in real estate. Many MBA programs do not specialize in real estate.

For those weighing an MBA versus graduate real estate education, there are some issues to consider:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!
! '''MBA'''
!'''Graduate Real Estate (MSRE, MSRED, MRED, MPS/RE)'''
|-
|'''Timeframe''' || 2 years full-time || 1 or 2 years; part or full-time
|-
|'''Curriculum''' || 1st year - Business Basics; 2nd year - Specialization largely focused on finance-related areas || Real estate focus and specialization throughout
|-
|'''Specialization''' || Real Estate in MBA programs is very rare. Specialization tends to be finance focused || Broad-based real estate education in design, management, law, development, economics and significant focus on finance, e.g., real estate finance, capital markets
|-
|'''Program size''' || Typically, the programs are large with real estate students representing a relatively small (2% - 3%) percentage || Small groups, with commonly 25 to 50 students
|-
|'''Industry Commitment''' || Students pursuing an MBA may not be committed to a real estate career; therefore they are seeking a broader base || All students are committed to the real estate industry and many have real-estate related experience prior to coming to the program. An important part of the programs are the learning between students.
|-
|'''Career opportunities''' || Varied but with a heavy concentration in finance-related areas of the real estate industry || Significant representation in project management, development, finance-related areas, acquisitions, entrepreneurship and government
|-
|'''Thesis''' || Generally, not required || Typically required, usually as a professional publication or a real-life capstone competition
|-
|'''Alumni network''' || Usually extensive, but predominantly outside of the real estate industry || Alumni are involved in all facets of the industry and located throughout the world
|-
|'''Recruitment''' || Limited recruitment by real estate companies || Many students seeking employment find opportunities through peers, professors or on-site recruitment
|}

====MBA real estate concentration offerings====
A limited number of MBA programs offer courses in real estate as part of the typical study in business.

[[Image:HEAO-3 diagram.gif|thumb|Diagram of HEAO 3 Satellite]]

The last of [[NASA|NASA's]] three [[HEAO Program|High Energy Astronomy Observatories]], '''HEAO 3''' was launched 20 September 1979 on an [[Atlas-Centaur]] launch vehicle, into a nearly circular, 43.6 degree inclination [[low-Earth orbit]] with an initial perigeum of 486.4&amp;nbsp;km.
The normal operating mode was a continuous celestial scan, spinning approximately once every 20 min about the spacecraft z-axis, which was nominally pointed at the Sun.
Total mass of the observatory at launch was {{convert|2660.0|kg|lb}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/masterCatalog.do?sc=1979-082A |title=NSSDC ID:1979-082A |accessdate=2008-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HEAO 3 included three scientific instruments: the first a [[cryogenic]] high-resolution germanium [[gamma-ray]] [[spectrometer]], and two devoted to [[cosmic-ray]] observations.
The scientific objectives of the mission's three experiments were:

:(1) to study intensity, spectrum, and time behavior of X-ray and gamma-ray sources between 0.06 and 10 MeV; measure isotropy of the diffuse X-ray and gamma-ray background; and perform an exploratory search for X-and gamma-ray line emissions;

:(2) to determine the isotopic composition of the most abundant components of the cosmic-ray flux with [[atomic mass]] between 7 and 56, and the flux of each element with [[atomic number]] (Z) between Z = 4 and Z = 50;

:(3) to search for super-heavy nuclei up to [[Atomic number|Z]] = 120 and measure the composition of the nuclei with Z &gt;20.

==The Gamma-ray Line Spectrometer Experiment==
The HEAO "C-1" instrument (as it was known before launch) was a sky-survey experiment, operating in the hard X-ray and low-energy gamma-ray bands.
The [[Gamma spectroscopy#Semiconductor detectors|gamma-ray spectrometer]] was especially designed to search for the 511 keV [[gamma-ray]] line produced by the [[annihilation]] of [[positron]]s in stars, galaxies, and the [[interstellar medium]] (ISM), nuclear gamma-ray line emission expected from the interactions of [[cosmic ray]]s in the ISM, the radioactive products of cosmic [[nucleosynthesis]], and nuclear reactions due to low-energy cosmic rays.
In addition, careful study was made of the spectral and time variations of known hard X-ray sources.

The experimental package contained four cooled, p-type high-purity [[germanium|Ge]] [[Gamma spectroscopy#Semiconductor detectors|gamma-ray detectors]] with a total volume of about 100&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;math&gt;^3&lt;/math&gt;, enclosed in a thick (6.6&amp;nbsp;cm average) [[caesium]] iodide (CsI) [[scintillation counter|scintillation]] shield in active anti-coincidence&lt;ref&gt;L. E. Peterson, ''Instrumental Technique in X-Ray Astronomy'', in Annu. Rev. Astron. Astrophys. 13, 423 (1975)&lt;/ref&gt; to suppress extraneous background.
The experiment was capable of measuring gamma-ray energies falling within the energy interval from 0.045 to 10 MeV.  The Ge detector system had an initial energy resolution better than 2.5 keV at 1.33 MeV and a line sensitivity from 1.E-4 to 1.E-5 photons/sq cm-s, depending on the energy.  Key experimental parameters were (1) a geometry factor of 11.1 sq cm-sr, (2) effective area ~75&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;math&gt;^2&lt;/math&gt; at 100 keV, (3) a field of view of ~30 deg [[Full width at half maximum|FWHM]] at 45 keV, and (4) a time resolution of less than 0.1 ms for the germanium detectors and 10 s for the CsI detectors.  The gamma-ray spectrometer operated until 1 June 1980, when its [[cryogen]] was exhausted.&lt;ref&gt;Wheaton, W.A. et al., "The HEAO 3 Background: Spectrum Observed by a Large Germanium Spectrometer in Low Earth Orbit", in AIP conference Proceedings #186, ''High Energy Radiation Background in Space'',1987, Eds Rester &amp; Trombka, p. 304-322.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/heao3/heao3.html |title=The HEAO-3 Satellite |accessdate=2007-12-07 |date=2003-06-26 |publisher=NASA/GSFC }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The energy resolution of the Ge detectors was subject to degradation (roughly proportional to energy and time) due to radiation damage.&lt;ref&gt;Mahoney, W.A., Ling, J.C., and Jacobson, A.S.

They include instrument, orbit, and aspect data plus some spacecraft housekeeping information on 1600-bpi binary tapes. Some of this material has subsequently been archived on more modern media.&lt;ref&gt;For more detailed information on the data base, contact Dr. James C. Ling, Mail Stop 169-337, JPL, 4800 Oak Grove Drive, Pasadena, Ca 91109&lt;/ref&gt;
The experiment was proposed, developed, and managed by the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] of the California Institute of Technology, under the direction of Dr. Allan S. Jacobson.

==The Isotopic Composition of Primary Cosmic Rays Experiment==
The HEAO C-2 experiment measured the relative composition of the isotopes of the primary cosmic rays between beryllium and iron (Z from 4 to 26) and the elemental abundances up to tin (Z=50). Cerenkov counters and [[hodoscope]]s, together with the Earth's magnetic field, formed a spectrometer. They determined charge and mass of cosmic rays to a precision of 10% for the most abundant elements over the momentum range from 2 to 25 GeV/c (c=speed of light). Scientific direction was by Principal Investigators Prof. Bernard Peters and Dr. Lyoie Koch-Miramond.  The primary data base has been archived at the Centre Etudes Nuclearires de Saclay and the Danish Space Research Institute. Information on the data products is given by Engelman et al. 1985.&lt;ref&gt;Engelman et al. Astron. &amp; Astrophys., v. 148, pp. 12-20, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Heavy Nuclei Experiment==
The purpose of the HEAO C-3 experiment was to measure the charge spectrum of cosmic-ray nuclei over the nuclear charge (Z) range from 17 to 120, in the energy interval 0.3 to 10 GeV/nucleon; to characterize cosmic ray sources; processes of nucleosynthesis, and propagation modes. The detector consisted of a double-ended instrument of upper and lower hodoscopes and three dual-gap ion chambers. The two ends were separated by a Cerenkov radiater. The geometrical factor was 4 sq cm-sr. The ion chambers could resolve charge to 0.24 charge units at low energy and 0.39 charge units at high energy and high Z. The Cerenkov counter could resolve 0.3 to 0.4 charge units.  Binns ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;W. R. Binns, et al., Nuc. Instr. and Meth., v. 185, pp. 415-426, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; give more details.
The experiment was proposed and managed by the Space Radiation Laboratory of the [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech), under the direction of Principal Investigator Prof. [[Edward C. Stone]], Jr. of Caltech, and Dr. Martin H. Israel, and Dr. Cecil J. Waddington.

==Project==
The HEAO 3 Project was the final mission in the [[HEAO Program|High Energy Astronomy Observatory]] series, which was managed by the NASA [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] (MSFC), where the project scientist was Dr. Thomas A. Parnell, and the project manager was Dr. John F. Stone.  The [[prime contractor]] was [[TRW Inc.|TRW]].

It provided the evidence that confirmed [[George Gamow]]'s and [[Georges Lemaître]]'s "[[Big Bang]]" theory of the creation of the universe. This helped change the science of cosmology, the study of the history of the universe, from a field for unlimited theoretical speculation into a discipline of direct observation. In 1978 Penzias and Wilson received the [[Nobel Prize for Physics]] for their discovery.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Chown, "A Cosmic Relic in Three Degrees," New Scientist, September 29, 1988, pp. 51-52.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

The [[horn antenna]] at Bell Telephone Laboratories in Holmdel, New Jersey, was constructed in 1959 to support [[Project Echo]]&amp;mdash;the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]'s passive communications satellites,&lt;ref&gt;[[J.S. Hey]], ''The Evolution of Radio Astronomy'' (New York: Neale Watson Academic Publications, Inc., 1973), pp. 98-99.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Crawford" /&gt; which used large earth orbiting aluminized plastic balloons as reflectors to bounce radio signals from one point on the Earth to another.

The antenna is 50 feet (15 m) in length with a [[radiating aperture]] of 20 by 20 feet (6 by 6 m) and is constructed of [[aluminum]]. The antenna's elevation wheel, which surrounds the midsection of the horn, is 30 feet (10 m) in diameter and supports the weight of the structure by means of rollers mounted on a base frame. All axial or thrust loads are taken by a large ball bearing at the narrow apex end of the horn. The horn continues through this bearing into the equipment building or cab. The ability to locate receiver equipment at the horn apex, thus eliminating the noise contribution of a connecting line, is an important feature of the antenna. A [[radiometry|radiometer]] for measuring the intensity of radiant energy is located in the cab.

The triangular base frame of the antenna is made from structural steel. It rotates on wheels about a center [[pintle]] ball bearing on a turntable track 30 feet (10 m) in diameter. The track consists of stress-relieved, planed steel plates which are individually adjusted to produce a track which is flat to about 1/64&amp;nbsp;inch (0.4&amp;nbsp;mm). The faces of the wheels are cone-shaped to minimize contact friction. A tangential force of 100 pounds (400 N) is sufficient to start the antenna rotating on the turntable. The antenna beam can be directed to any part of the sky using the turntable for [[azimuth]] adjustments and the elevation wheel to change the [[elevation angle]] or altitude above the horizon.

With the exception of the steel base frame, which was made by a local steel company, the antenna was fabricated and assembled by the Holmdel Laboratory shops under the direction of Mr. H. W. Anderson, who also collaborated on the design. Assistance in the design was also given by Messrs. R. O'Regan and S. A. Darby. Construction of the antenna was completed under the direction of [[Arthur B. Crawford|A. B. Crawford]] from [[Freehold Borough, New Jersey|Freehold]], [[Monmouth County, New Jersey|Monmouth County]], [[New Jersey]], United States.

When not in use, the turntable azimuth [[sprocket]] drive is disengaged, allowing the structure to "weathervane" and seek a position of minimum wind resistance. The antenna was designed to withstand winds of 100 miles per hour (160&amp;nbsp;km/h) and the entire structure weighs 18 short tons (16 tonnes).

A plastic clapboarded utility shed 10 by 20 feet (3 by 6 m), with two windows, a double door and a sheet metal roof, is located on the ground next to the antenna. This structure houses equipment and controls for the antenna and is included as a part of the designation as a National Historic Landmark. The antenna has not been used for several decades.

==Technical==
This type of antenna is called a [[Horn antenna#Horn-reflector antenna|Hogg or horn-reflector antenna]], invented by Alfred C. Beck and [[Harald T. Friis]] in 1941.&lt;ref name="Beck"&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents?id=7mluAAAAEBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=2416675&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7hPwTs2FHIStiQLmypyaDg&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA   U.

A Hogg horn combines several characteristics useful for radio astronomy. It is extremely [[broadband|broad-band]], has calculable [[aperture efficiency]], and the walls of the horn shield it from radiation coming from angles outside the main beam axis. The back and [[sidelobe|side lobes]] are therefore so minimal that scarcely any thermal energy is received from the ground. Consequently, it is an ideal radio telescope for accurate measurements of low levels of weak background radiation. The antenna has a [[Antenna gain|gain]] of about 43.3 dBi and a beamwidth of about 1.5° at 2.39&amp;nbsp;GHz and an [[aperture efficiency]] of 76%.&lt;ref name="Crawford" /&gt;

The '''hydrogen line''', '''21-centimeter line''' or '''H&amp;nbsp;I line'''&lt;ref&gt;Read "H one".&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the [[electromagnetic radiation]] [[spectral line]] that is created by a change in the energy state of neutral [[hydrogen atom]]s. This electromagnetic radiation is at the precise frequency of {{val|1420405751.7667|0.0009|ul=Hz}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Proton Zemach radius from measurements of the hyperfine splitting of hydrogen and muonic hydrogen |first1=Arnaud |last1=Dupays |first2=Alberto |last2=Beswick |first3=Bruno |last3=Lepetit |first4=Carlo |last4=Rizzo |journal=Physical Review A |volume=68 |issue=5 |date=August 2003 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.68.052503 |url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/file/index/docid/561/filename/hfspra.pdf |arxiv=quant-ph/0308136|bibcode = 2003PhRvA..68e2503D }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is equivalent to the [[wavelength#in non-vacuum media|vacuum wavelength]] of {{val|21.1061140542|ul=cm}}&lt;!--...0541791±1337, so this is the appropriate precision--&gt; in [[free space]]. This wavelength falls within the [[microwave]] region of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], and it is observed frequently in [[radio astronomy]], since those [[radio wave]]s can penetrate the large clouds of interstellar [[cosmic dust]] that are [[opacity (optics)|opaque]] to [[visible light]].

The microwaves of the hydrogen line come from the atomic transition of an electron between the two [[hyperfine levels]] of the hydrogen [[principle quantum number|1]][[azimuthal quantum number|s]] [[ground state]] that have an energy difference of ~ {{val|5.87433|u=µ[[electronvolt|eV]]}}.&lt;ref name="Hyperphysics"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/quantum/h21.html |title=The Hydrogen 21-cm Line |accessdate=2008-09-20 |work=[[Hyperphysics]] |publisher=[[Georgia State University]] |date=2004-10-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is called the ''spin-flip transition''. The frequency, {{math|''ν''}}, of the [[quantum|quanta]] that are emitted by this transition between two different energy levels is given by the [[Planck–Einstein relation]] {{math|''E'' {{=}} ''hν''}}. According to that relation, the [[photon energy]] of a 1,420,405,751.7667&amp;nbsp;Hz [[photon]] is ~ 5.87433 µeV. The [[constant of proportionality]], {{math|''h''}}, is known as the [[Planck constant]].

==Cause==
{{Further information|Hyperfine structure}}
The ground state of neutral hydrogen consists of an [[electron]] bound to a [[proton]]. Both the electron and the proton have intrinsic magnetic dipole moments ascribed to their [[spin (physics)|spin]], whose interaction results in a slight increase in energy when the spins are parallel, and a decrease when antiparallel. The fact that only parallel and antiparallel states are allowed is a result of the quantum mechanical discretization of the total angular momentum of the system. When the spins are parallel, the magnetic dipole moments are antiparallel (because the electron and proton have opposite charge), thus one would expect this configuration to actually have ''lower energy'' just as two magnets will align so that the north pole of one is closest to the south pole of the other. This logic fails here because the wave functions of the electron and the proton overlap; that is, the electron is not spatially displaced from the proton, but encompasses it. The magnetic dipole moments are therefore best thought of as tiny current loops. As parallel currents attract, the parallel magnetic dipole moments (i.e., antiparallel spins) have lower energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=D. J. |last=Griffiths |title=Hyperfine Splitting in the Ground State of Hydrogen |journal=[[American Journal of Physics]] |volume=50 |issue=8 |year=1982 |pages=698–703 |doi=10.1119/1.12733 |bibcode = 1982AmJPh..50..698G }}&lt;/ref&gt; The transition has an energy difference of {{val|5.87433|u=µeV}} that when applied in the Planck equation gives:

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda = \frac {1}{\nu} \cdot c = \frac {h}{E} \cdot c = \frac {4.1357 \cdot 10^{-15}\;\text{eV}\;\text{s}}{5.874\,33 \cdot 10^{-6}\;\text{eV}} \cdot 2.9979 \cdot 10^8\;\text{m}\;\text{s}^{-1} = 0.211\,06\;\text{m} = 21.106\;\text{cm} &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''h''}}, is the [[Planck constant]] and {{math|''c''}} is the speed of light.
 
This transition is highly [[forbidden line|forbidden]] with an extremely small transition rate of {{val|2.9|e=−15|u=s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and a mean lifetime of the excited state of around 10&amp;nbsp;million years. A spontaneous occurrence of the transition is unlikely to be seen in a laboratory on Earth, but it can be artificially induced using a [[hydrogen maser]]. It is commonly observed in astronomical settings such as [[H I region|hydrogen clouds]] in our galaxy and others. Owing to its long lifetime, the line has an extremely small natural width, so most broadening is due to [[Doppler shift]]s caused by bulk motion or nonzero temperature of the emitting regions.

==Discovery==
During the 1930s, it was noticed that there was a radio 'hiss' that varied on a daily cycle and appeared to be extraterrestrial in origin. After initial suggestions that this was due to the Sun, it was observed that the radio waves seemed to propagate from the [[Galactic Center|centre of the Galaxy]]. These discoveries were published in 1940 and were noted by [[Jan Oort]] who knew that significant advances could be made in astronomy if there were [[emission line]]s in the radio part of the spectrum. He referred this to [[Hendrik van de Hulst]] who, in 1944, predicted that [[electric charge|neutral]] [[hydrogen]] could produce radiation at a [[frequency]] of 1420.4058&amp;nbsp;MHz due to two closely spaced energy levels in the [[ground state]] of the [[hydrogen atom]].

The 21&amp;nbsp;cm line (1420.4&amp;nbsp;MHz) was first detected in 1951 by [[Harold Irving Ewen|Ewen]] and [[Edward Mills Purcell|Purcell]] at [[Harvard University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ewan |first=H.

After 1952 the first maps of the neutral hydrogen in the Galaxy were made, and revealed for the first time the spiral structure of the [[Milky Way]].

==Uses==
===In radio astronomy===
The 21&amp;nbsp;cm spectral line appears within the [[radio spectrum]] (in the [[L band]] of the [[Ultra high frequency|UHF band]] of the [[microwave window]] to be exact). Electromagnetic energy in this range can easily pass through the Earth's atmosphere and be observed from the Earth with little interference.

Assuming that the hydrogen atoms are uniformly distributed throughout the galaxy, each line of sight through the galaxy will reveal a hydrogen line. The only difference between each of these lines is the doppler shift that each of these lines has. Hence, one can calculate the relative speed of each arm of our [[galaxy]]. The [[rotation curve]] of our [[galaxy]] has been calculated using the 21&amp;nbsp;cm hydrogen line. It is then possible to use the plot of the [[rotation curve]] and the [[velocity]] to determine the distance to a certain point within the galaxy.

Hydrogen line observations have also been used indirectly to calculate the mass of galaxies, to put limits on any changes over time of the universal [[gravitational constant]] and to study the dynamics of individual galaxies.

===In cosmology===
The line is of great interest in [[big bang]] [[physical cosmology|cosmology]] because it is the only known way to probe the "dark ages" from [[Recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] to [[reionization]]. Including the [[redshift]], this line will be observed at frequencies from 200&amp;nbsp;MHz to about 9&amp;nbsp;MHz on Earth. It potentially has two applications. First, by [[Intensity mapping|mapping the intensity]] of redshifted 21 centimeter radiation it can, in principle, provide a very precise picture of the [[matter power spectrum]] in the period after recombination. Second, it can provide a picture of how the universe was reionized, as neutral hydrogen which has been ionized by radiation from stars or quasars will appear as holes in the 21&amp;nbsp;cm background.

However, 21&amp;nbsp;cm observations are very difficult to make. Ground-based experiments to observe the faint signal are plagued by interference from television transmitters and the [[ionosphere]], so they must be made from very secluded sites with care taken to eliminate interference. Space based experiments, even on the far side of the Moon (where they would be sheltered from interference from terrestrial radio signals), have been proposed to compensate for this. Little is known about other effects, such as [[synchrotron radiation|synchrotron emission]] and free–free emission on the galaxy. Despite these problems, 21&amp;nbsp;cm observations, along with space-based gravity wave observations, are generally viewed as the next great frontier in observational cosmology, after the [[Cosmic microwave background radiation#Polarization|cosmic microwave background polarization]].

===Relevance to the search for non-human intelligent life===
The [[Pioneer plaque]], attached to the [[Pioneer 10]] and [[Pioneer 11]] [[spacecraft]], portrays the hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen and used the wavelength as a standard scale of measurement. For example, the height of the woman in the image is displayed as eight times 21&amp;nbsp;cm, or 168&amp;nbsp;cm. Similarly the frequency of the hydrogen spin-flip transition was used for a unit of time in a map to Earth included on the Pioneer plaques and also the [[Voyager 1]] and [[Voyager 2]] probes. On this map, the position of the Sun is portrayed relative to 14 [[pulsar]]s whose rotation period circa 1977 is given as a multiple of the frequency of the hydrogen spin-flip transition. It is theorized by the plaque's creators that an advanced civilization would then be able to use the locations of these pulsars to locate the [[Solar System]] at the time the spacecraft were launched.

The 21&amp;nbsp;cm hydrogen line is considered a favorable frequency by the [[SETI]] program in their search for signals from potential extraterrestrial civilizations. In 1959, Italian physicist [[Giuseppe Cocconi]] and American physicist [[Philip Morrison]] published "Searching for Interstellar Communications", a [[academic paper|paper]] proposing the 21&amp;nbsp;cm hydrogen line and the potential of microwaves in the search for interstellar communications. According to George Basalla, the paper by Cocconi and Morrison "provided a reasonable theoretical basis" for the then nascent SETI program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Basalla |first=George |date=2006 |title=Civilized Life in the Universe |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=0-19-517181-0 |pages=133–135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[:ru:Маковецкий, Пётр Васильевич|Pyotr Makovetsky]] proposed SETI use a frequency which is equal to either
:{{0}}{{pi}} × {{val|1420.40575177|u=MHz}} = {{val|4.46233627|u=GHz}}
or
:[[Turn (geometry)|2{{pi}}]] × {{val|1420.40575177|u=MHz}} = {{val|8.92467255|u=GHz}}
Since [[pi|{{pi}}]] is an [[irrational number]], such a frequency could not possibly be produced in a natural way as a [[harmonic]], and would clearly signify its artificial origin. Such a signal would not be overwhelmed by the H&amp;nbsp;I line itself, or by any of its harmonics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Makovetsky|first=P.|url=http://n-t.ru/ri/mk/sk109-4.htm|title=Смотри в корень|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Society for Explosive Engineers''' (ISEE) is a tax-exempt professional body founded in 1974 to advance the science and art of explosives engineering.. Headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio, it is the primary international organization for explosive engineers.

==History==
ISEE was founded in Pittsburgh in 1974, when a small group of explosive engineers came together to discuss how to advance the science and art of explosive engineering.  Since then the ISEE has grown to over 4000 members with 43 local chapters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.isee.org/who-we-are | title = About Us | publisher = International Society for Explosive Engineers | access-date = 2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
The ISEE has 2 primary peer reviewed publications, and an industry handbook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.isee.org/publications | title = The Blasters' Trifecta | publisher = International Society for Explosive Engineers | access-date = 2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Journals===

The '''''Journal of Political Ecology''''' is an annual [[open access]] [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] covering [[political ecology]]. It was established in 1994 as one of the first open access journals in the social sciences, by James B. Greenberg and Thomas K. Park ([[University of Arizona]]), to experiment with online formats and to showcase new work in the emerging field of political ecology. The current [[editors-in-chief]] are Simon P.J. Batterbury ([[Lancaster University]] and [[University of Melbourne]]) and Casey Walsh ([[University of California, Santa Barbara]]). There is an international editorial board.&lt;ref&gt;http://jpe.library.arizona.edu/Masthead.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==
Unlike the majority of academic journals it is produced free of charge for readers and authors using voluntary academic labour, and its website is hosted at the University of Arizona library. There is no journal budget and editorial work is voluntary. JPE is abstracted and indexed in [[Scopus]], and the number of articles published, and citation index, has risen substantially since 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ecologiapolitica.info/?p=3564&lt;/ref&gt; The journal publishes Eric Wolf Prize papers submitted by early career scholars to the [[Society for Applied Anthropology]] annual meetings in the United States. The journal is a founding member of the ''Free Journal Network'' &lt;ref&gt;https://freejournals.org/ Free Journal Network&lt;/ref&gt; that supports and lobbies for quality open access publishing.

==Scope==
The scope of the journal is research into the linkages between [[political economy]] and [[human impact on the environment]], particularly where there are inequalities in access to resources, or an increase in vulnerability, as a result of resource use or assertion of political power. Articles must address some aspect of this relationship, framed in political ecology, and topics have ranged from [[mining]] and [[indigenous peoples of Oceania]], to drug production in [[Lesotho]], [[marine protected area]] management in Vietnam, the [[sandalwood]] trade in [[East Timor]], environmental pollution in post-communist countries, water consumption and management in the United States West and Mexico, and the plight of [[Adivasi]] peoples living in national parks in India. Special issues are occasionally published, for example ''Ecologies of Hope'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jpe.library.arizona.edu/Volume20/Volume_20.html |title=Journal of Political Ecology |publisher=University of Arizona Library |date=2013 |accessdate=2013-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; edited by S. Ravi Rajan and Colin Duncan in 2013, ''Non-capitalist political ecologies''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jpe.library.arizona.edu/Volume21/Volume_21.html |title=Journal of Political Ecology |publisher=University of Arizona Library |date=2013 |accessdate=2013-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; edited by Brian Burke and Boone Shear and ''Degrowth, Culture and Power'' edited by Lisa Gezon and Susan Paulson in 2017.

The four most important research areas covered by the 145 articles published as of late 2014 were 1) Food and agricultural issues 2) social aspects of conservation 3) fishing issues and 4) mining and social struggles.&lt;ref&gt;Batterbury, S.P.J. 2015.

The {{nihongo|'''Kihara Institute for Biological Research'''|横浜市立大学木原生物学研究所|Yokohama Shiritsu Daigaku Kihara Seibutsugaku Kenkyūjo}} ('''KIBR''') is an ancillary establishment of [[Yokohama City University]] in [[Yokohama]], Japan. The KIBR was founded in 1942 by [[Hitoshi Kihara]] to promote [[biological research]] in Japan. The Institute maintains a store of genetic resources - about 6,000 varieties of [[wheat]] and 800 of [[capsicum]] (chili peppers).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jica.go.jp/regions/africa/ku57pq00001la1es-att/60_yokohama_city_univ_intl_management.pdf Graduate School of International Management Yokohama City University | JICA]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Although the KIBR's primary focus is [[plant biology]], research there covers a wide variety of biological fields, including [[biochemistry]], [[cell biology]], [[genetics]], [[Informatics (academic field)|informatics]], and [[biotechnology]]. The results of the research conducted at KIBR are regularly published in peer reviewed publications.

==Education==
In addition to being a [[research institute]], the KIBR functions as an institution of higher education, constituting the Graduate School of [[Nanobioscience]], Yokohama City University. The graduate school offers a five-year doctoral program and a two-year master course for university graduates.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.yokohama-cu.ac.jp/kihara/outline/kiharaenkaku.html|script-title=ja:木原生物学研究所の沿革|trans-title=History of the Kihara Institute for Biological Research|date= |work= |publisher= Yokohama City University|location= Japan|language= Japanese|accessdate= 28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Liebig's law of the minimum''', often simply called '''Liebig's law''' or the '''law of the minimum''', is a principle developed in [[agricultural science]] by [[Carl Sprengel]] (1828) and later popularized by [[Justus von Liebig]]. It states that [[wiktionary:growth|growth]] is dictated not by total [[Resource (biology)|resources]] available, but by the scarcest resource ([[limiting factor]]). The law has also been applied to biological [[population]]s and [[ecosystem model]]s for factors such as [[sunlight]] or [[macronutrient (ecology)|mineral nutrients]].

== Applications ==
This concept was originally applied to [[plant]] or [[agriculture|crop]] growth, where it was found that increasing the amount of plentiful [[nutrient]]s did not increase plant growth. Only by increasing the amount of the limiting nutrient (the one most scarce in relation to "need") was the growth of a plant or crop improved. This principle can be summed up in the aphorism, "The availability of the most abundant nutrient in the soil is only as good as the availability of the least abundant nutrient in the soil." Or, to put it more plainly, "A chain is only as strong as its weakest link."

=== Scientific applications ===
Liebig's law has been extended to biological [[population]]s (and is commonly used in [[ecosystem model|ecosystem modelling]]). For example, the growth of an organism such as a plant may be dependent on a number of different factors, such as [[sunlight]] or [[macronutrient (ecology)|mineral nutrients]] (e.g., [[nitrate]] or [[phosphate]]). The availability of these may vary, such that at any given time one is more limiting than the others. Liebig's law states that growth only occurs at the rate permitted by the most limiting factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=9619&amp;page=R1|title=Plants and Population: is there time?|publisher=National Academy of Sciences|year=1999|series=Colloquium|location=Washington DC|chapter=Limits to Crop Yield|first1=Thomas R.|last1=Sinclair|chapterurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110703111853/http://146.186.172.254/nas/Panelists/Sinclair%20Comments.html|editor=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, in the equation below, the growth of population &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; is a function of the minimum of three [[Michaelis-Menten kinetics|Michaelis-Menten]] terms representing limitation by factors &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dO}{dt} = O\left(\min \left( \frac{\mu_I I}{k_{I} + I}, \frac{\mu_N N}{k_{N} + N}, \frac{\mu_P P}{k_{P} + P} \right) -m\right) &lt;/math&gt;

The use of the equation is limited to a situation where there are steady state [[ceteris paribus]] conditions, and factor interactions are tightly controlled.

===Protein nutrition===
In [[human nutrition]], the law of the minimum was used by [[William Cumming Rose]] to determine the [[essential amino acid]]s. In 1931 he published his study "Feeding experiments with mixtures of highly refined amino acids".&lt;ref&gt;W.C. Rose (1931) [http://www.jbc.org/content/94/1/155.full.pdf Feeding Experiments], [[Journal of Biological Chemistry]] 94: 155–65&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge of the essential amino acids has enabled [[vegetarian]]s to enhance their [[protein (nutrient)|protein]] nutrition by [[protein combining]] from various vegetable sources. One practitioner was [[Nevin S. Scrimshaw]] fighting protein deficiency in India and Guatemala. [[Francis Moore Lappe]] published ''[[Diet for a Small Planet]]'' in 1971 which popularized protein combining using grains, legumes, and dairy products.

=== Other applications ===
More recently Liebig's law is starting to find an application in [[natural resource management]] where it surmises that growth in markets dependent upon [[natural resource]] inputs is restricted by the most limited input. As the [[natural capital]] upon which growth depends is limited in supply due to the [[wiktionary:finite|finite]] nature of the planet, Liebig's law encourages scientists and natural resource managers to calculate the scarcity of essential resources in order to allow for a multi-generational approach to [[resource consumption]].

Neoclassical economic theory has sought to refute the issue of resource scarcity by application of the [[substitute good|law of substitutability]] and [[technological innovation]]. The substitutability "law" states that as one resource is exhausted—and prices rise due to a lack of surplus—new markets based on alternative resources appear at certain prices in order to satisfy demand. Technological innovation implies that humans are able to use technology to fill the gaps in situations where resources are [[substitute good|imperfectly substitutable]].

A market-based theory depends on proper pricing. Where resources such as clean air and water are not accounted for, there will be a "market failure". These failures may be addressed with [[Pigovian tax]]es and subsidies, such as a carbon tax. While the theory of the law of substitutability is a useful rule of thumb, some resources may be so fundamental that there exist no substitutes. For example, [[Isaac Asimov]] noted, "We may be able to substitute nuclear power for coal power, and plastics for wood ... but for phosphorus there is neither substitute nor replacement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Asimov|first1=Issac|title=Fact and Fancy| date=1962|publisher=Doubleday|chapter-url=https://books.google.co.th/books/about/Fact_and_Fancy.html?id=FbbaAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|chapter=Life's Bottleneck}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where no substitutes exist, such as phosphorus, recycling will be necessary. This may require careful long-term planning and governmental intervention, in part to create Pigovian taxes to allow efficient market allocation of resources, in part to address other market failures such as excessive time discounting.

== Liebig's barrel ==
[[File:Minimum-Tonne.svg|thumb|Liebig's barrel]]
Dobenecks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=A.R. |last1=Whitson |first2=H.L. |last2=Walster |title=Soils and soil fertility |publisher=Webb  |location=St. Paul, MN |year=1912 |oclc=1593332 |page=73 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8SguAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=editions%3AJ2lm1K7DxBIC&amp;q=Dobenecks#search_anchor |quote=100. Illustration of Limiting Factors. The accompanying illustration devised by Dr. Dobenecks is intended to illustrate this principle of limiting factors.}}&lt;/ref&gt; used the image of a barrel—often called "Liebig's barrel"—to explain Liebig's law. Just as the capacity of a barrel with staves of unequal length is limited by the shortest stave, so a plant's growth is limited by the nutrient in shortest supply.

If a system satisfies the law of the minimum then adaptation will equalize the load of different factors because the adaptation resource will be allocated for compensation of limitation.&lt;ref name="GorbanLiebig2010"&gt;A.N. Gorban, L.I. Pokidysheva, E.V. Smirnova, T.A. Tyukina. [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/47816112_Law_of_the_Minimum_Paradoxes Law of the Minimum Paradoxes], Bull Math Biol 73(9) (2011), 2013–2044&lt;/ref&gt; Adaptation systems act as the [[wikt:cooper|cooper]] of Liebig's barrel and lengthens the shortest stave to improve barrel capacity. Indeed, in well-adapted systems the limiting factor should be compensated as far as possible. This observation follows the concept of resource competition and fitness maximization.&lt;ref&gt;D. Tilman, ''Resource Competition and Community Structure'', Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ (1982).&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the law of the minimum paradoxes, if we observe the Law of the Minimum in artificial systems, then under natural conditions adaptation will equalize the load of different factors and we can expect a violation of the law of the minimum. Inversely, if artificial systems demonstrate significant violation of the law of the minimum, then we can expect that under natural conditions adaptation will compensate this violation. In a limited system life will adjust as an [[evolution]] of what came before.&lt;ref name="GorbanLiebig2010"/&gt;

== Biotechnology ==

One example of technological innovation is in [[plant genetics]] whereby the biological characteristics of species can be changed by employing [[genetic modification]] to alter biological dependence on the most limiting resource. [[Biotechnological]] innovations are thus able to extend the limits for growth in species by an increment until a new limiting factor is established, which can then be challenged through technological innovation.

Theoretically there is no limit to the number of possible increments towards an unknown productivity limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=J.M. |last1=Reilly |first2=K.O. |last2=Fuglie |title=Future yield growth in field crops: what evidence exists? |journal=Soil and Tillage Research |volume=47 |issue=3–4 |pages=275–290 |date=6 July 1998 |doi=10.1016/S0167-1987(98)00116-0 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167198798001160}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would be either the point where the increment to be advanced is so small it cannot be justified economically or where technology meets an invulnerable natural barrier. It may be worth adding that biotechnology itself is totally dependent on external sources of [[natural capital]].

The '''Malcolm Knapp Research Forest''' is located in the [[Coast Mountains]], about 60&amp;nbsp;km from [[Vancouver]], in [[Maple Ridge, British Columbia]]. The forest is approximately 5,157 hectares and has many different types of terrain. The forest is home to some 400-year-old trees, though the vast majority of trees are 70–120 years old. It was a site of major logging from the 1800s to 1931, but was officially established as the UBC/Malcolm Knapp Research Forest in 1949 because of the major influence from the late UBC professor [[Malcolm Knapp]]. Although today it is dedicated to research and education, it is also a popular destination for trail hiking and camps. 

__TOC__

==Historic influence and UBC research==

In 1922 when the forestry program at UBC was just two years old, [[Malcolm Knapp]], a professor of forestry, had a vision to conduct research for forestry. He taught courses on logging, wood technology and forestry products. At this time, the university only had a small forest on the edge of campus for research, so his influence was immense{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=June 2015}} when the [[University of British Columbia]] took over management of the forest in 1949. His vision of having a large and vast forest became reality. This vision, along with his passion for [[salvage archaeology|salvaging]] and [[silviculture]] for the Forestry Program at UBC, was of great importance{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=June 2015}} as his 41 years of service for the university ended in 1963. After his many years of service to the forest and the university, the Research Forest officially changed its name to Malcolm Knapp/UBC Research Forest in 1988, and then he died a year later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Malcolm Knapp&amp;#124; History|url=http://www.mkrf.forestry.ubc.ca/about/history/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UBC also holds a spot at the top of one of the mountains for a [[liquid mirror telescope]] observatory (UBC LMTO). It was established in 1995 as part of development for liquid-mirror technology. The telescope overlooks the [[Fraser Valley]] and is far enough away from the city lights to provide a great{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=June 2015}} research facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UBC LMTO|url=http://www.mkrf.forestry.ubc.ca/research/liquid-mirror-telescope/|accessdate=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are currently{{When|date=June 2015}} 84 research projects going on at the forest, all related to riparian management, silviculture, wildlife, hydrology, ecology, and other applied science fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UBC Research Projects Database|url=http://www.mkrf.forestry.ubc.ca/research/research-projects-database/}}&lt;/ref&gt; UBC also releases annual reports in which one can see what is going on in the forest, what research they are conducting and any updates on projects. Staff changes, silviculture reports (including clear-cuts, thinning, etc.), along with major events for the forest are all summarized in these reports. Please see external links for archives.

==Ecology==

[[File:Old growth Douglas-fir, Malcolm Knapp Research Forest, BC, Canada.jpg|thumb]]

[[File:Blooming Skunk Cabbage.JPG|thumb]]

The forest is about {{convert|5,157|ha}}. It measures 13&amp;nbsp;km from west to east and 4&amp;nbsp;km north to south. It contains every type of terrain found on Coastal B.C which means that it has a wide variety of many plants, animals and trees. The highest elevation is in the north-east corner and is about 1000m above sea level in the [[Golden Ears (peaks)|Golden Ears Mountains]], and it spans down to sea level, touching [[Pitt Lake]]. Typically, the most precipitation that is seen at the forest is rain, which averages about 2200mm in the northern end of the forest. This end also receives snow in the winter. However, the south end is closer to sea level and receives around 3000mm of rain per year.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title=Malcolm Knapp Research Forest|url=http://www.mkrf.forestry.ubc.ca/about/location-and-ecology/|accessdate=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malcolm Knapp Research Forest is categorized in the [[Biogeoclimatic zones of British Columbia|Coast Western Hemlock Biogeoclimatic zone]], with the lower portion of the forest in the dry maritime subzone and the upper portion in the very wet maritime subzone. It has a vast collection of trees, plants and animals including [[Douglas fir]], [[western red cedar]], [[western hemlock]] and [[amabilis fir]] trees. The forest still has some patches of intact old growth forest that is over 400 years old, but since ongoing research is being done, some of the forest is as young as 40 years old, though most of the forest is covered in trees that are about 70 years old.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Some other trees and plants you can find are [[bigleaf maple]], [[vine maple]], [[Lysichiton americanus|skunk cabbage]] (yellow flower pictured beside), [[Oregon grape]], [[salmonberry]], and many ferns like [[Polystichum munitum|sword fern]] and [[Dryopteris expansa|spiny wood fern]].

==Recreation==
[[File:Trails at Malcolm Knapp.JPG|thumb]]
The maximum trail length is about 8&amp;nbsp;km; that will take the average hiker around 3 hours to walk. The trails at Malcolm Knapp are categorized as an intermediate hike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vancouver Trails &amp;#124; UBC Malcolm Knapp|url=http://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/ubc-malcolm-knapp-research-forest/|accessdate=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Malcolm Knapp hiking===
[[File:Markers.JPG|thumb]]
The south part of Malcolm Knapp Research Forest has an abundance of trails which are all colour coded into Red, Green, Yellow, and blue, with red being the easiest and blue being the hardest. Please see external links for a map of the trails.

===Loon Lake hiking===
The Loon Lake Trail is for guests of Loon Lake Research and Education Centre wishing to embark on this 6&amp;nbsp;km hike. Please see external links for a map of the trails.

====Loon Lake Research and Education Center====

On the trails at Loon Lake, there is a research and education center. Loon Lake is the largest lake in the forest, which has its own trail around the lake that will take about 6 hours to complete as it is 6&amp;nbsp;km in length. The lake opened an outdoor education camp in 2000, and now provides an area for forestry and environmental education, as well as outdoor recreation with activities such as:&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Loon Lake Lodge and Retreat Center|url=http://loonlake.ubc.ca/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Canoe &amp; Water Adventures

{{Maya civilization}}
A unique and intricate style, the tradition of '''Mayan architecture''' spans several thousands of years. Often, the buildings most dramatic and easily recognizable as Mayans are the stepped  pyramids of the
[[Terminal Pre-classic]] period and beyond. Being based on the general [[Mesoamerican architecture|Mesoamerican architectural]] traditions, these pyramids relied on intricate carved stone in order to create a stairstep design. Each pyramid was dedicated to a deity whose shrine sat at its top. During this "height" of Maya culture, the centers of their religious, commercial and bureaucratic power grew into large cities, namely [[Tikal]] and [[Uxmal]]. Through observation of the numerous consistent elements and stylistic distinctions, remnants of Maya architecture have become an important key to understanding the evolution of their ancient temples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elan.com.mx/biblioteca/Function%20and%20Meaning%20in%20Classic%20Maya%20Architecture.pdf#page=56]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Urban design==
{{see also|Maya city}}

As Maya cities spread throughout the varied geography of [[Mesoamerica]], the extent of site planning appears to have been minimal; their cities having been built somewhat haphazardly as dictated by the topography of each independent location. Maya architecture tends to integrate a great degree of natural features. For instance, some cities existing on the flat [[limestone]] plains of the northern Yucatán grew into great sprawling municipalities, while others built in the hills of [[Usumacinta]] utilized the natural loft of the topography to raise their towers and temples to impressive heights. However, some semblance of order, as required by any large city, still prevailed.
At the onset of large-scale construction, a predetermined axis was typically established in congruence with the cardinal directions. Depending upon the location and availability of natural resources such as fresh-water wells, or ''[[cenotes]]'', the city grew by connecting great plazas with the numerous platforms that created the sub-structure for nearly all Maya buildings, by means of ''[[sacbeob]]'' causeways. As more structures were added and existing structures re-built or remodeled, the great Maya cities seemed to take on an almost random identity that contrasts sharply with other great Mesoamerican cities such as [[Teotihuacan]] and its rigid grid-like construction.

[[File:Temples of the Cross Group.jpg|thumb|left|Palenque, [[Temple of the Cross Complex]]]]
At the heart of the Maya city existed the large plazas surrounded by their most valued governmental and religious buildings such as the royal [[acropolis]], great pyramid temples, and occasionally [[Mesoamerican ballgame|ballcourts]]. Though city layouts evolved as nature dictated, careful attention was placed on the directional orientation of temples and observatories so that they were constructed in accordance with Maya interpretation of the orbits of the stars. Immediately outside this ritual center were the structures of lesser nobles, smaller temples, and individual shrines: the less sacred and less important structures had a greater degree of privacy. Outside the constantly evolving urban core were the less permanent and more modest homes of the common people.

[[Mesoamerican chronology|Classic Era]] Maya urban design could easily be described as the division of space by great monuments and causeways. In this case, the open public plazas were the gathering places for the people and the focus of the urban design, while interior space was entirely secondary. Only in the Late Post-Classic era did the great Maya cities develop into more fortress-like defensive structures that lacked, for the most part, the large and numerous plazas of the Classic.

==Building process==
All evidence seems to suggest that most stone buildings existed on top of a platform sub-structure that varied in height from less than a meter, in the case of terraces and smaller structures, to 45 meters in the case of great temples and pyramids. A flight of often steep stone steps split the large stepped platforms on at least one side, contributing to the common bi-symmetrical appearance of Maya architecture. Depending on the prevalent stylistic tendencies of an area, these platforms most often were built of a stucco and cut stone exterior filled with densely packed gravel. As is the case with many other Maya reliefs, those on the platforms often were related to the intended purpose of the residing structure. Thus, as the sub-structural platforms were completed, the grand residences and temples of the Maya were constructed on the solid foundations of the platforms. As all structures were built, little attention seems to have been given to their utilitarian functionality and much to external aesthetics; however, a certain repeated aspect, the [[corbeled arch]], was often utilized to mimic the appearance and feel of the simple Maya hut. Though not an effective tool to increase interior space, as it required thick stone walls to support the high ceiling, some temples utilized repeated arches, or a [[corbelled vault]], to construct what the Maya referred to as ''[[pibnal]]'', or [[sweatbath]], such as those in the [[Temple of the Cross]] at Palenque. As structures were completed, typically extensive relief work was added, often to the covering of stucco used to smooth any imperfections; however, many [[lintel]] carvings have been discovered, as well as actual stone carvings used as a facade. Commonly, these would continue uninterrupted around an entire structure and contain a variety of artwork pertaining to the inhabitants or purpose of a building. Though not the case in all Maya locations, broad use of painted stucco has been discovered as well.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

It has been suggested that, in conjunction to the [[Maya calendar|Maya Long Count Calendar]], every fifty-two years, or cycle, temples and pyramids were remodeled and rebuilt. It appears now that the rebuilding process was often instigated by a new ruler or for political matters, as opposed to matching the calendar cycle. However, the process of rebuilding on top of old structures is indeed a common one. Most notably, the [[North Acropolis, Tikal|North Acropolis]] at Tikal seems to be the sum total of 1,500 years of architectural modifications.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

'''Building Materials                                                                                                                                                                                '''

The Mayan civilization used very simple tools for building their structures.  The most common tools use were made of stone found in surrounding areas.  Limestone was a huge part of the Mayan tool making, as limestone was geographically very abundant in most settlements.  Locations of the Mayan cities were chosen with the access to necessary stones in mind.  This allowed most quarries to be right outside the city for easy access to blocks needed for construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.courses.psu.edu/anth/anth008_cmg149/mbm.html|title=Mayan construction:  building materials|last=Moore|first=Christina|website=www.courses.psu.edu|access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Top Limestone quarries used were Palenque and Tikal.  Though Limestone was the most important material they still collected sandstone from Quiriguá and volcanic tuff from Copan. 

The Mayan people had taken advantage of mortar on most structural projects.  The Mayans used a very difficult process of limestone under large amounts of heat to create their mortar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ancient.eu/Maya_Architecture/|title=Maya Architecture|work=Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The mortar was so widely used, the Mayans even used it for sculptures, facades, and floor layers.  Their mortar was very effective on a large building lifetime, but humid climates can have a negative effect on the mortar. 

For more important construction projects the Mayans would cover the entire structures exterior with stucco, followed by bright paintings, prioritizing red, yellow, green, and blue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mayansandtikal.com/mayan-architecture/mayan-buildings-daily-life-or-architecture/#Mayan_Building_Materials|title=Mayan Buildings|website=mayansandtikal.com|access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable constructions==

===Ceremonial platforms===
These were commonly limestone platforms of typically less than four meters in height where public ceremonies and religious rites were performed. Constructed in the fashion of a typical foundation platform, these were often accented by carved figures, altars and perhaps ''[[tzompantli]]'', a stake used to display the heads of victims or defeated [[Mesoamerican ballgame]] opponents.

===Palaces===
Large and often highly decorated, the palaces usually sat close to the center of a city and housed the population's elite. Every exceedingly large royal palace, or one consisting of many chambers on different levels might be referred to as an acropolis. However, often these were one-story and consisted of small chambers and typically at least one interior courtyard; these structures appear to take into account the needed functionality required of a residence, as well as the decoration required for their inhabitants stature. Archaeologists seem to agree that many palaces are home to various tombs. At [[Copán]], beneath over four-hundred years of later remodeling, a tomb for one of the ancient rulers has been discovered and the North Acropolis at [[Tikal]] appears to have been the site of numerous burials during the Terminal Pre-classic and Early Classic periods.[[File:Sayil Palacio Plan EN.png|thumb|left|Sayil, Yucatán. Three-story palace.]][[File:Palenque - El Palacio - Rekonstruktion.jpg|thumb|right|Palenque, Palace]]

===E-groups===
"[[E-Group]]" is a classification given by [[Mayanist]]s to certain structure complexes present at a number of Maya sites located in the central and southern Maya lowlands (e.g., the [[Petén Basin|Petén region]]). Complexes of this type consist of a stepped pyramid main structure, situated on the western side of a quadrilateral plaza or platform. A raised but rather elongated structure appears along the eastern side of the plaza, running north-south; a variation has three smaller temple mounds on top of or replacing this platform, the middle of these substructures placed directly opposite the main structure. Often, two other subsidiary structures appear on the north and south sides of the plaza, respectively. The main western structure is typically terraced (i.e. has several levels), with inset stairways on each of its four sides, with only the eastern stairway, leading from the plaza, providing access to the summit. The stairways have large balustrades which protrude from the pyramid, which were decorated with large [[stucco]] masks and panels of architectural art. In other examples, believed to be of a later date, this quadripartite stairway configuration is lacking.

E-group complexes are named after their prototypical example, Structure E-VII-sub at the site of [[Uaxactun]]. They were first identified as a meaningful complex by archaeologist [[Frans Blom]] in 1924, who excavated the site under the auspices of the [[Carnegie Institution of Washington|Carnegie Institution of Washington]].

It has been theorized that these E-groups are observatories, because the eponymous group at Uaxactun contains alignments corresponding approximately to sunrises on the [[solstice]]s and [[equinox]]es. However, all other E-groups have different orientations, which pertain to widespread groups of astronomical alignments that are also embedded in a number of buildings of other types; hence the term "observatory" applied to these assemblages is hardly warranted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Šprajc |first1=Ivan |last2=Sánchez Nava |first2=Pedro Francisco |title=Astronomy and architecture in the Maya lowlands |journal=Journal of Skyscape Archaeology |date=2016 |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=189-215 |doi=10.1558/jsa.30050}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other ideas seem to stem from the possible creation story told by the relief and artwork that adorns these structures.

===Triadic Groups===
They consist of an elevated platform (either an extensive acropolis or a steep pyramid) with a monumental stairway, with a central building facing the stairs, and two lateral structures facing each other on both sides of the platform. This formal complex has been attributed to the earthly re-creation of the Celestial Hearth (modern-day constellation of Orion), or a stage for enthronement rituals.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently Triadic Groups have been interpreted as sanctuaries commemorating Maize God's resurrection upon the Flowery Mountain.&lt;ref&gt;Szymanski 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Such complexes appear during the Late Preclassic times and gradually decrease in number until their disappearance in the Early Postclassic.

===Pyramids and temples===
Often the most important temples sat atop towering Maya pyramids, some of over two-hundred feet, such as that at [[El Mirador]]. The sanctuary on top commonly was heightened by a crest or roof comb. While recent discoveries point toward the extensive use of pyramids as tombs, the temples themselves seem to rarely, if ever, contain burials. [[Image:Tikal6.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tikal]], temple pyramid with prominent roof comb]]

At Chichén Itzá there is a pyramid called [[El Castillo, Chichen Itza|El Castillo]] ('the castle'). With four stairways, each with 91 steps (with the upper platform they sum up to 365), and having other architectural elements appearing in astronomically significant numbers, it is a good example of Maya myth and astronomical cycles joined in architecture. Also referred to as the Pyramid of Kukulcán, the structure provides a remarkable display, observed by thousands of modern visitors at the equinoxes. The setting sun's rays are projected on the northern balustrade, create the illusion of a snake winding its way down the steps of the pyramid. The snake is composed of several triangle shapes giving it the appearance of a diamond back snake. At the base of the northern stairway there are massive snake head sculptures, making this effect even more persuasive. While it is a widespread belief that this light-and-shadow effect was achieved on purpose to record the equinoxes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.exploratorium.edu/ancientobs/chichen/HTML/castillo.html|title=Ancient Observatories: Chichén Itzá|author=|date=|website=www.exploratorium.edu|accessdate=7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/travel/world-heritage/chichen-itza|title=Chichen Itza -- World Heritage Site -- National Geographic|author=|date=15 November 2010|website=nationalgeographic.com|accessdate=7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the idea is highly unlikely: it has been shown that the phenomenon can be observed, without major changes, during several weeks around the equinoxes, making impossible to determine any date by observing this effect alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Šprajc |first1=Ivan |last2=Sánchez Nava |first2=Pedro Francisco |title=El Sol en Chichén Itzá y Dzibilchaltún: la supuesta importancia de los equinoccios en Mesoamérica |journal=Arqueología Mexicana |date=2018 |volume=XXV |issue=149 |pages=26-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maya architecture is vastly different from the others in Meso-American cultures. The blend of mythology and astronomical events can be found in nearly all Maya palace or pyramid structures. One will also notice the heavy influence of the Toltecs in the architecture at Chichén Itzá. The Toltecs invaded the Maya and merged their cultural traditions around the year 1000.&lt;ref name="ancient.eu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancient.eu/Chichen_Itza/|title=Chichen Itza|author=|date=|website=ancient.eu|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180114073941/https://www.ancient.eu/Chichen_Itza/|archivedate=14 January 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Observatories===
The Maya were keen astronomers and had mapped out the phases of celestial objects, especially the [[Sun]], [[Venus]] and the [[Moon]]. Many temples have doorways and other features aligning to celestial events. Round temples, often dedicated to [[Kukulcan]], are perhaps those most often described as "observatories" by modern ruin tour-guides. It is now known, however, that many buildings of different types and uses were oriented on astronomical grounds, mostly to sunrises and sunsets on specific dates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Aveni |first1=A. |last2=Hartung |first2=H. |title=Maya City Planning and the Calendar |date=1986 |publisher=American Philosophical Society |location=Philadelphia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Aveni |first1=Anthony F. |title=Skywatchers: A Revised and Updated Version of Skywatchers of Ancient Mexico |date=2001 |publisher=University of Texas Press |location=Austin}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dates recorded are concentrated in four agriculturally significant seasons and tend to be separated by multiples of elementary periods of the calendrical system (13 and 20 days), suggesting that the orientations allowed the use of observational calendars intended to facilitate a proper scheduling of agricultural and associated ceremonial activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sánchez Nava |first1=Pedro Francisco |last2=Šprajc |first2=Ivan |title=Orientaciones astronómicas en la arquitectura maya de las tierras bajas |date=2015 |publisher=Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia |location=Mexico City |isbn=978-607-484-727-7 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/297155454_Orientaciones_astronomicas_en_la_arquitectura_maya_de_las_tierras_bajas}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although most of the important Maya buildings were oriented on the basis of astronomical criteria, their primary functions were religious, residential or administrative; the label "observatory" applied to any structural type is thus hardly warranted.

===Ballcourts===
As an integral aspect of the Mesoamerican lifestyle, the courts for their ritual ballgame were constructed throughout the Maya realm, often on a grand scale. The playing alleys of ballcourts were defined by two long walls.  Courts built earlier in Maya history (as at [[Cobá]]) had sloped sides, while ones built later (as at [[Chichén Itzá]]) had vertical sides. Frequently, the ends were enclosed so as to create an [[Image:I, heavily serifed.png|10px]]-shaped court when viewed from above.[[Image:Chichen itza ballcourt.jpg|thumb|right|Great Ballcourt at Chichen Itza]]

When the Maya played games in the Ballcourts, the ball was made of solid rubber and was sometimes as much as a foot in diameter. It was passed between teams ranged on opposite ends of the court. The players could hit it only with their knees or hips, much like football or soccer today. Points could be scored when the opponents failed to return the ball correctly. In central Mexico, and in late times in Yucatán, rings of stone were set high up in the side walls of the court. It was considered a particular triumph for a player to knock the ball through the ring.&lt;ref&gt;Proskouriakoff, Tatiana. (2002). An Album of Maya Architecture. Mineola, New York: Dover Publications, Inc. p.38.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cave sites==
There are also [[cave]] sites that are important to the Maya. [[Maya cave sites]] include [[Jolja Cave]], the cave site at [[Naj Tunich]], the [[Candelaria Caves]], and the [[Cave of the Witch]]. There are also cave [[creation myth]]s among the Maya. Some cave sites are still used by the modern Maya in the [[Chiapas highlands]] in Mexico.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1121">'''Load''', in mechanics, is the external mechanical resistance against which a machine, such as a motor or engine, acts.&lt;ref&gt;[[American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]].&lt;/ref&gt; The load can often be expressed as a curve of [[force (physics)|force]] versus speed.

==Vehicle==
For instance, a given car traveling on a road of a given slope presents a load which the engine must act against. Because air resistance increases with speed, the motor must put out more [[torque]] at a higher speed in order to maintain the speed. By shifting to a higher gear, one may be able to meet the requirement with a higher torque and a lower engine speed, whereas shifting to a lower gear has the opposite effect. Accelerating increases the load, whereas decelerating decreases the load.

==Pump==
Similarly, the load on a [[pump]] depends on the [[hydrostatic head|head]] against which the pump is pumping, and on the size of the pump.

==Fan==
Similar considerations apply to a [[Mechanical fan|fan]]. See [[Affinity laws]].

The '''rise in core''' (RIC) method is an alternate reservoir wettability characterization method described by S. Ghedan and C. H. Canbaz in 2014. The method enables estimation of all [[wetting]] regions such as strongly water wet, water wet, intermediate water and oil wet, oil wet and strongly oil wet regions in relatively quick, accurate measurements in terms of [[Contact angle]] rather than wettability index.

The method is easy to use and requires no complex equipment. During the RIC experiments, core samples saturated with selected reservoir fluid are subjected to imbibition from a second reservoir fluid. RIC wettability measurements are compared with modified – [[Amott test]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last=Amott|first=E.|title=Observations related to Wettability of Porous Rock|conference=AIME|year=1959|pp=216, 156–162|url=https://www.onepetro.org/general/SPE-1167-G}}&lt;/ref&gt; and USBM measurements using core plug pairs from different heights of a thick carbonate reservoir. Results show good coherence. Ghedan and Canbaz proved and patented the RIC method as an alternate method to Amott and USBM methods and that it efficiently characterizes Reservoir Wettability.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ghedan|first=Shawket G.|last2=Canbaz|first2=Celal Hakan|date=19 January 2014|title=Theory and Experimental Setup of the New Rise in Core Reservoir Wettability Measurement Technique|journal=International Petroleum Technology Conference|language=english|doi=10.2523/iptc-17659-ms|isbn=9781613993224}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Patent|US|patent|20120136578}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cut-off values vs wettability index ==
One study used the water advancing contact angle to estimate the wettability of fifty five oil reservoirs. Deoxygenated synthetic formation brine and dead anaerobic crudes were tested on quartz and calcite crystals at reservoir temperature. Contact angles from 0 to 75 degrees were deemed water wet, 75 to 105 degrees as intermediate and 105 to 180 degrees as oil wet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Treiber|first=L.E.|last2=Owens|first2=W.W.|date=1 December 1972|title=A Laboratory Evaluation of the Wettability of Fifty Oil-Producing Reservoirs|journal=Society of Petroleum Engineers Journal|language=english|volume=12|issue=6|pages=531–540|doi=10.2118/3526-pa|issn=0197-7520}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the range of wettabilities was divided into three regions, these are arbitrary divisions. The wettability of different reservoirs can vary within the broad spectrum from strongly water-wet to strongly oil-wet. Another study described two initial conditions as reference and non-reference for calculating cut-off values by using advancing and receding contact angles and spontaneous imbibition data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ma|first=S.M.|last2=Zhang|first2=X.|last3=Morrow|first3=N.R.|last4=Zhou|first4=X.|date=1 December 1999|title=Characterization of Wettability From Spontaneous Imbibition Measurements|journal=Journal of Canadian Petroleum Technology|language=english|volume=38|issue=13|doi=10.2118/99-13-49|issn=0021-9487}}&lt;/ref&gt; Limiting value between water wet and intermediate zones was described as 62-degree. Similarly, cut-off values for advancing contact angle is described as 0 to 62 degrees for water wet region, 62 to 133 degrees for Intermediate-wet zone, and 133 to 180 degrees for Oil wet zone.
''Chilingar and Yen''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chilingar|first=George V.|last2=Yen|first2=T.

Cut-off values classified as 160 to 180 degrees for strongly oil wet, 100 to 160 degrees for oil wet, 80 to 100 degrees intermediate wet, 80 to 20 degrees water wet and 0 to 20 strongly water wet.

Rise in core uses a combination of ''Chilingar et al.''  and ''Morrow'' wettability cut-off criteria. The contact angle range 80 – 100 degrees indicate neutral-wetness, the range 100 – 133 degrees indicate slight-oil wetness, the range 133 – 160 degrees indicate oil-wetness while the range 160- 180 degrees indicate strongly oil-wetness. The range 62 – 80 degrees indicate slight water wetness, the range 20 – 62 degrees indicate, water-wetness, while the range 0 – 20 degrees indicate strong water-wetness.

== Technique ==
Rise in Core (RIC) wettability characterization technique is based on a modified form of [[Washburn's equation]] (1921). The technique enables relatively quick and accurate measurements of wettability in terms of contact angle while requiring no complex equipment. The method is applicable for any set of reservoir fluids, on any type of reservoir rock and at any heterogeneity level. It characterizes wettability across the board from strongly water to strongly oil wet conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ghedan|first=Shawkat G.|last2=Canbaz|first2=Celal Hakan|last3=Boyd|first3=Douglas A.|last4=Mani|first4=George M.|last5=Haggag|first5=Marwan Khamis|date=1 January 2010|title=Wettability Profile of a Thick Carbonate Reservoir by the New Rise in Core Wettability Characterization Method|journal=Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition and Conference|language=english|doi=10.2118/138697-ms|isbn=9781555633158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The step of deriving the modified form of Washburn equation for a rock/liquid/liquid system involves acquiring a Washburn equation for a rock/air/liquid system. The Washburn equation for a rock/air/liquid system is represented by:

&lt;math&gt;t= {\mu \over C \rho^2 \gamma \cos \theta} {m^2}&lt;/math&gt; ''&lt;small&gt;(Eq.1).&lt;/small&gt;''

Herein, "t" is the penetration rate of liquid into a porous sample, "μ" is the liquid's viscosity,  "ρ" is the liquid's density, "γ" is the liquid's surface tension, "θ" is the liquid's contact angle, "m" is the mass of the liquid that penetrates the porous sample and "C" is the constant of characterization of the porous sample. evaluating a value of "γ&lt;sub&gt;os&lt;/sub&gt;" using a young’s equation for a rock surface/water/air system (Figure 2) and a value of "γ&lt;sub&gt;ws&lt;/sub&gt;" using young’s equation for a liquid/liquid/rock system is represented as:

&lt;math&gt;\gamma_{ow} \cos \theta = \gamma_{os} \gamma_{ws} &lt;/math&gt;    ''&lt;small&gt;(Eq.2).&lt;/small&gt;''

"γ&lt;sub&gt;ow&lt;/sub&gt;" is the surface tension between the oil and water system, "γ&lt;sub&gt;os&lt;/sub&gt;" is the surface tension between oil and solid system and "γ&lt;sub&gt;ws&lt;/sub&gt;" is the surface tension between water and the solid system. Using  [[Wetting#Ideal solid surfaces|Young's equation]] for a rock surface/ water/air system and substituting in equation (2) to obtain equation 3:

&lt;math&gt;\cos\theta_{wo}= {{\gamma_o \cos \theta_o}\cdot{\gamma_w \cos \theta_w} \over {\gamma_{wo}}}&lt;/math&gt;        ''&lt;small&gt;(Eq. 3).&lt;/small&gt;''

Rearranging equation (1) to factor out γ&lt;sub&gt;LV&lt;/sub&gt; obtains equation (4), wherein γ&lt;sub&gt;LV&lt;/sub&gt; a liquid-vapor surface tension is:

&lt;math&gt;\gamma_{LV}= {\mu \over C \rho^2 \gamma \cos \theta} \cdot {m^2 \over t}&lt;/math&gt;  ''&lt;small&gt;(Eq. 4).&lt;/small&gt;''

Realizing that γ&lt;sub&gt;LV&lt;/sub&gt; (liquid–vapor surface tension) is equivalent to γ&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; (oil–air surface tension), or γ&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; (water–air-surface tension), substituting equation (4) in equation (3) and cancelling out similar terms obtains equation (5):

&lt;math&gt;\cos \theta_{wo}=   {{({{m^2 \mu_o} \over {C {\rho_o}^2  t}})-({{m^2 \mu_w} \over {C {\rho_w}^2  t}})} \over  \mu_{wo}  }    &lt;/math&gt; ''&lt;small&gt;(Eq. 5).&lt;/small&gt;''

Therein, γ&lt;sub&gt;LV&lt;/sub&gt; is liquid-vapor surface tension, γ&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;is oil-air surface tension, γ&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; is water-air surface tension, µ&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; is viscosity of oil and  µ&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; is viscosity of water. cosθ&lt;sub&gt;wo&lt;/sub&gt; is contact angle between water and oil; representing a relationship between a mass of water imbibed into the core sample and a mass of oil imbibed in the core sample with an equation (6):

&lt;math&gt;{\rho_w g V_w} = {\rho_o g V_o}&lt;/math&gt;     ''&lt;small&gt;(Eq. 6).&lt;/small&gt;''

Therein ρ&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; is density of water and V&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; is volume of water imbibed, ρ&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; is density of oil and V&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; is volume of oil imbibed, the amount of water imbibed and amount of oil imbibed under gravity are same; and air behaves as a strong non-wetting phase in both an oil–air–solid and a water–air–solid systems, thereby indicating that both oil and water behave as strong wetting phases, resulting in equal air/oil and air/water capillary forces for the same porous media and for a given pore size distribution. Thus, a mass change of a core sample due to water imbibition is equal to a mass change of a core sample due to oil imbibition, because water or oil penetration of the porous media at any time is a function of a balance between gravity and capillary forces. The mass of water imbibed into a core sample is approximately equal to a mass of oil imbibed in the core sample core samples of a same rock type and dimensions, and for equal capillary forces;

Cancelling out g in equation(6) gives equation (7):

&lt;math&gt;{\rho_w V_w} = {\rho_o V_o}&lt;/math&gt;      ''&lt;small&gt;(Eq. 7),&lt;/small&gt;''

which means

&lt;math&gt;{m_w} = {m_o}&lt;/math&gt;  ''&lt;small&gt;(Eq. 8).&lt;/small&gt;''

Therein, m&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; is mass of water and m&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; is mass of oil. Factoring out &lt;small&gt;&lt;math&gt;C {m^2 \over t} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/small&gt; from Eq. 5 to obtain Eq. 9, gives Modified Washburn Equation:

&lt;math&gt; {\cos \theta_{12}} = {{{{(\mu_1 {\rho_2}^2)}-{(\mu_2 {\rho_1}^2)}}\over {{{\rho_1}^2}  {{\rho_2}^2}  C  \mu_{L1L2}}} \cdot \left({m^2 \over t}\right)}   &lt;/math&gt;      ''&lt;small&gt;(Eq. 9).&lt;/small&gt;''

Therein θ&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; is the contact angle of liquid/liquid/rock system, μ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is a viscosity of oil phase, μ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a viscosity of water phase, ρ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is density of oil phase in g/cm³, ρ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is density of water phase in g/cm³, ''m'' is mass of fluid penetrated into a porous rock, ''t'' is time in min, γ_&lt;sub&gt;L1L2&lt;/sub&gt; is the surface tension between an oil and a water in dyne/cm, and ∁ is a characteristic constant of the porous rock.
[[File:RIC Experimental Setup.jpg|thumb|409x409px|Figure 1]]

== Experimental setup and procedure ==

Schematic view and experimental setups of the RIC wettability testing method is described in Figure 1. Core plugs are divided into 3–4 core samples, each of 3.8&amp;nbsp;cm average diameter and 1.5&amp;nbsp;cm length. The lateral area of each core sample is sealed by [[epoxy]] resin to ensure one-dimensional liquid penetration into the core by imbibition. A hook is mounted on top side of the core sample.

The RIC setup includes a beaker to host the imbibing fluid. A thin rope connects the core sample to a high-precision balance (0.001 gm accurate). A hanging core sample is positioned with the bottom part of the sample barely touching the imbibing fluid in the beaker. Relative saturation as well as mass of core samples starts to change during imbibition. A computer connected to a balance continuously monitors the core sample mass change over time. Plots of squared mass change versus time are generated.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Canbaz, C.H., Ghedan, S.G.,  "Theory and Experimental Setup of the New Rise in Core Reservoir Wettability Measurement Technique"  IPTC #17659, IPTC, Doha, Qatar, January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Determination of "C" constant ===
[[File:RIC Experimental Procedure.jpg|thumb|404x404px|Figure 2]]
The RIC experiment is first performed with a n-[[dodecane]]–air–rock system to determine the constant ∁ of the Washburn Equation. N-dodecane imbibes into one of the core samples and the imbibition curve is recorded in Figure 2. Dodecane is an [[alkane]] that has low surface energy, very strongly wetting the rock sample in the presence of air, with contact angle θ equal to zero. Constant ∁ is determined by the contact angle value for dodecane/air/rock system, determining physical properties of n-dodecane (ρ,μ,γ) and rearranging equation 1;

&lt;math&gt;C= {\mu \over \rho^2 \gamma_{LV} \cos \theta} \cdot {m^2 \over t}&lt;/math&gt;       ''&lt;small&gt;(Eq. 10)&lt;/small&gt;''

=== Experiment ===
The second step of the RIC experimental process is to saturate the neighboring core sample with crude oil and subjected the sample to water imbibition. Applying the slope of the RIC curve &lt;math&gt;({m^2 \over t})&lt;/math&gt;, fluid properties of oil/brine system (ρ,μ,γ) and the ∁ value are determined from the neighboring core sample into Eq. 9 to calculate the contact angle, θ.

The '''Second Industrial Revolution''', also known as the '''Technological Revolution''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Muntone|first=Stephanie|title=Second Industrial Revolution|url=http://www.education.com/study-help/article/us-history-glided-age-technological-revolution/|work=Education.com|publisher=The McGraw-Hill Companies|accessdate=14 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022224325/http://www.education.com/study-help/article/us-history-glided-age-technological-revolution/|archivedate=22 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a phase of rapid [[industrialization]] in the final third of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th. The [[First Industrial Revolution]], which ended in the early to mid 1800s, was punctuated by a slowdown in macroinventions{{clarify|date=January 2018}} before the Second Industrial Revolution in 1870. Though a number of its characteristic events can be traced to earlier innovations in [[manufacturing]], such as the establishment of a [[machine tool]] industry, the development of methods for manufacturing [[interchangeable parts]] and the invention of the [[Bessemer Process]] to produce [[steel]], the Second Industrial Revolution is generally dated between 1870 and 1914 (the start of [[World War I]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ushistoryscene.com/article/second-industrial-revolution/ The Second Industrial Revolution: 1870-1914]&lt;/ref&gt;

Advancements in manufacturing and production technology enabled the widespread adoption of preexisting technological systems such as [[electrical telegraph|telegraph]] and [[railroad]] networks, gas and [[water supply]], and [[sewage systems]], which had earlier been concentrated to a few select cities. The enormous expansion of rail and telegraph lines after 1870 allowed unprecedented movement of people and ideas, which culminated in a new wave of [[globalization]]. In the same time period, new technological systems were introduced, most significantly [[electrical power]] and [[telephone]]s. The Second Industrial Revolution continued into the 20th century with early factory [[electrification]] and the [[production line]], and ended at the start of [[World War I]].

==Overview==
The Second Industrial Revolution was a period of rapid industrial development, primarily in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Germany]] and the [[United States]], but also in [[France]], the [[Low Countries]], [[Italy]] and [[Japan]]. It followed on from the [[First Industrial Revolution]] that began in Britain in the late 18th century that then spread throughout Western Europe and North America. It was characterized by the build out of [[railroad]]s, large-scale iron and [[steel]] production, widespread use of [[machinery]] in manufacturing, greatly increased use of steam power, widespread use of the [[electrical telegraph|telegraph]], use of [[petroleum]] and the beginning of [[electrification]].  It also was the period during which modern organizational methods for operating large scale businesses over vast areas came into use.

The concept was introduced by [[Patrick Geddes]], ''[[Patrick Geddes#Published works|Cities in Evolution]]'' (1910), but [[David Landes]]' use of the term in a 1966 essay and in ''[[The Unbound Prometheus]]'' (1972) standardized scholarly definitions of the term, which was most intensely promoted by [[Alfred D. Chandler, Jr.|Alfred Chandler]] (1918–2007). However, some continue to express reservations about its use.&lt;ref&gt;James Hull, "The Second Industrial Revolution: The History of a Concept", ''Storia Della Storiografia,'' 1999, Issue 36, pp 81–90&lt;/ref&gt;

Landes (2003) stresses the importance of new technologies, especially, the [[internal combustion engine]] and petroleum, new materials and substances, including alloys and [[Chemical industry|chemicals]], electricity and communication technologies (such as the [[telegraph]], telephone and [[radio]]).

Vaclav Smil called the period 1867–1914 "The Age of [[Synergy]]" during which most of the great innovations were developed since the inventions and innovations were engineering and [[Applied science|science-based]].&lt;ref name ="Smil2005"&gt;{{cite book |title=Creating the Twentieth Century: Technical Innovations of 1867–1914 and Their Lasting Impact |last=Smil |first=Vaclav |authorlink=Vaclav Smil  |year=2005 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford; New York |isbn=0-19-516874-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Industry and technology ==
A synergy between iron and steel, railroads and coal developed at the beginning of the Second Industrial Revolution.  Railroads allowed cheap transportation of materials and products, which in turn led to cheap rails to build more roads.  Railroads also benefited from cheap coal for their steam locomotives.  This synergy led to the laying of 75,000 miles of track in the U.S. in the 1880s, the largest amount anywhere in world history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chandler|1993|pp=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Iron ===
The [[hot blast]] technique, in which the hot [[flue gas]] from a blast furnace is used to [[air preheater|preheat]] combustion air blown into a [[blast furnace]], was invented and patented by [[James Beaumont Neilson]] in 1828 at [[Wilsontown Ironworks]] in Scotland. Hot blast was the single most important advance in fuel efficiency of the blast furnace as it greatly reduced the fuel consumption for making pig iron, and was one of the most important technologies developed during the [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Unbound Prometheus: Technological Change and Industrial Development in Western Europe from 1750 to the Present|last=Landes|first=David.  S.|authorlink=David Landes|year=1969|publisher=Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge|location=Cambridge, New York|isbn=0-521-09418-6|pages=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Falling costs for producing [[wrought iron]] coincided with the emergence of the [[railway]] in the 1830s.

The early technique of hot blast used iron for the regenerative heating medium.  Iron caused problems with expansion and contraction, which stressed the iron and caused failure. [[Edward Alfred Cowper]] developed the Cowper stove in 1857.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Landes|year-1969|pp=256–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This stove used firebrick as a storage medium, solving the expansion and cracking problem.  The Cowper stove was also capable of producing high heat, which resulted in very high throughput of blast furnaces.  The Cowper stove is still used in today's blast furnaces.

With the greatly reduced cost of producing pig iron with [[coke (fuel)|coke]] using hot blast, demand grew dramatically and so did the size of blast furnaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Landes|year-1969|pp=218}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

=== Steel ===
[[File:ConverterB.jpg|thumb|300px|A diagram of the [[Bessemer converter]]. Air blown through holes in the converter bottom creates a violent reaction in the molten pig iron that oxidizes the excess carbon, converting the pig iron to pure iron or steel, depending on the residual carbon.]]

The [[Bessemer process]], invented by [[Sir Henry Bessemer]], allowed the [[mass-production]] of [[steel]], increasing the scale and speed of production of this vital material, and decreasing the labor requirements. The key principle was the removal of excess carbon and other impurities from [[pig iron]] by [[oxidation]] with air blown through the molten iron. The oxidation also raises the temperature of the iron mass and keeps it molten.

The "acid" Bessemer process had a serious limitation in that it required relatively scarce [[hematite]] ore&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Landes|year-1969|pp=228}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is low in phosphorus. [[Sidney Gilchrist Thomas]] developed a more sophisticated process to eliminate the [[phosphorus]] from [[iron]]. Collaborating with his cousin, [[Percy Gilchrist]] a chemist at the [[Blaenavon Ironworks]], [[Wales]], he patented his process in 1878;&lt;ref&gt;[http://yba.llgc.org.uk/en/s-THOM-GIL-1850.html ''Thomas, Sidney Gilchrist'' at Welsh Biography Online]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bolckow Vaughan]] &amp; Co. in [[Yorkshire]] was the first company to use his patented process.&lt;ref name=EB-Thom&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Thomas, Sidney Gilchrist |volume=26 |page=867}}&lt;/ref&gt; His process was especially valuable on the continent of Europe, where the proportion of phosphoric iron was much greater than in England, and both in Belgium and in Germany the name of the inventor became more widely known than in his own country. In America, although non-phosphoric iron largely predominated, an immense interest was taken in the invention.&lt;ref name=EB-Thom/&gt;

[[File:Barrow Steelworks.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Barrow Hematite Steel Company]] operated 18 Bessemer converters and owned the largest steelworks in the world at the turn of the 20th century.]]

The next great advance in steel making was the [[Siemens-Martin process]]. Sir [[Charles William Siemens]] developed his regenerative furnace in the 1850s, for which he claimed in 1857 to able to recover enough heat to save 70–80% of the fuel. The furnace operated at a high temperature by using [[Air preheater|regenerative preheating]] of fuel and air for [[combustion]]. Through this method, an open-hearth furnace can reach temperatures high enough to melt steel, but Siemens did not initially use it in that manner.

French engineer [[Pierre-Émile Martin]] was the first to take out a license for the Siemens furnace and apply it to the production of steel in 1865. The Siemens-Martin process complemented rather than replaced the [[Bessemer process]].  Its main advantages were that it did not expose the steel to excessive nitrogen (which would cause the steel to become brittle), it was easier to control, and that it permitted the melting and refining of large amounts of scrap steel, lowering steel production costs and recycling an otherwise troublesome waste material. It became the leading steel making process by the early 20th century.

The availability of cheap steel allowed building larger bridges, railroads, [[skyscraper]]s, and ships.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Birch, ''Economic History of the British Iron and Steel Industry'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Other important steel products—also made using the open hearth process—were [[steel cable]], steel rod and sheet steel which enabled large, high-pressure boilers and high-tensile strength steel for machinery which enabled much more powerful engines, gears and axles than were previously possible. With large amounts of steel it became possible to build much more powerful guns and carriages, tanks, [[armored fighting vehicle]]s and naval ships.

=== Rail ===
[[File:The rail rolling mill, Hughesovka.jpg|thumb|300px|A rail rolling mill in [[Donetsk]], 1887.]]
The increase in steel production from the 1860s meant that [[railroad]]s could finally be made from steel at a competitive cost. Being a much more durable material, steel steadily replaced iron as the standard for railway rail, and due to its greater strength, longer lengths of rails could now be rolled. [[Wrought iron]] was soft and contained flaws caused by included [[dross]].  Iron rails could also not support heavy locomotives and was damaged by [[hammer blow]]. The first to make durable [[rail profile|rails]] of steel rather than [[wrought iron]] was [[Robert Forester Mushet]] at the [[Darkhill Ironworks]], [[Gloucestershire]] in 1857.

The first of his steel rails was sent to [[Derby Midland railway station]].  They were laid at part of the station approach where the iron rails had to be renewed at least every six months, and occasionally every three. Six years later, in 1863, the rail seemed as perfect as ever, although some 700 trains had passed over it daily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rolt |first1=L.T.C |title=Victorian Engineering |year=1974 |origyear= |publisher=Pelican |location=London |isbn=  |page=183 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This provided the basis for the accelerated construction of [[railways|rail transportation]] throughout the world in the late nineteenth century.  Steel rails lasted over ten times longer than did iron,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Railroads and American Economic Growth: Essays in Econometric History |last=Fogel |first=Robert W.|authorlink= |year=1964 |publisher=The Johns Hopkins Press |location=Baltimore and London |isbn= 0801811481 |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and with the falling cost of steel, heavier weight rails were used.  This allowed the use of more powerful locomotives, which could pull longer trains, and longer rail cars, all of which greatly increased the productivity of railroads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Inside the Black Box: Technology and Economics|last= Rosenberg|first=Nathan|authorlink=|year=1982|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, New York|isbn=0-521-27367-6|pages=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rail became the dominant form of transport infrastructure throughout the industrialized world,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Grubler|first1=Arnulf|author1-link=|title=The Rise and Fall of Infrastructures|year=1990|url=http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Admin/PUB/Documents/XB-90-704.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; producing a steady decrease in the cost of shipping seen for the rest of the century.&lt;ref name ="Fogel1964"&gt;{{cite book |title=Railroads and American Economic Growth: Essays in Econometric History |last=Fogel |first=Robert W.|authorlink= |year=1964 |publisher=The Johns Hopkins Press |location=Baltimore and London |isbn= 0-8018-1148-1 |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Electrification ===
{{Main|Electrification|Electricity}}
The theoretical and practical basis for the harnessing of electric power was laid by the scientist and experimentalist [[Michael Faraday]]. Through his research on the [[electromagnetic field|magnetic field]] around a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]] carrying a [[direct current]], Faraday established the basis for the concept of the electromagnetic field in physics.&lt;ref name="EncBrit"&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Faraday, Michael |volume=10 |page=173 |first=James Clerk |last=Maxwell |authorlink=James Clerk Maxwell}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IEEUK"&gt;[http://www.theiet.org/about/libarc/archives/biographies/faraday.cfm "Archives Biographies: Michael Faraday", The Institution of Engineering and Technology.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929004417/http://www.theiet.org/about/libarc/archives/biographies/faraday.cfm |date=September 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[invention]]s of [[electric motor|electromagnetic rotary devices]] were the foundation of the practical use of electricity in technology.

In 1881, [[Sir Joseph Swan]], inventor of the first feasible [[incandescent light bulb]], supplied about 1,200 Swan incandescent lamps to the [[Savoy Theatre]] in the City of Westminster, London, which was the first theatre, and the first public building in the world, to be lit entirely by electricity.&lt;ref&gt;"The Savoy Theatre", ''[[The Times]]'', October 3, 1881&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TRE&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/carte/savoy/electric.html Description of lightbulb experiment] in ''The Times'', December 29, 1881&lt;/ref&gt; Swan's lightbulb had already been used in 1879 to light Mosley Street, in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], the first electrical street lighting installation in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.frognet.net/~ejcov/jwswan.html|title=Sir Joseph Wilson Swan|publisher=home.frognet.net|accessdate=16 October 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510005841/http://home.frognet.net/~ejcov/jwswan.html|archivedate=10 May 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rsc.org/Chemsoc/Activities/ChemicalLandmarks/UK/JosephSwan.asp |title=Sir Joseph Swan, The Literary &amp; Philosophical Society of Newcastle |date=3 February 2009 |publisher=rsc.org |accessdate=16 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This set the stage for the electrification of industry and the home.

The first modern power station in the world was built by the English [[electrical engineer]] [[Sebastian de Ferranti]] at [[Deptford]]. Built on an unprecedented scale and pioneering the use of high voltage (10,000V) [[alternating current]], it generated 800 kilowatts and supplied central London. On its completion in 1891 it supplied high-voltage [[AC power]] that was then "stepped down" with transformers for consumer use on each street. [[Electrification]] allowed the final major developments in manufacturing methods of the Second Industrial Revolution, namely the [[assembly line]] and [[mass production]].&lt;ref name ="Ford1922"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Ford|first1=Henry|author1-link=Henry Ford|author2=Crowther, Samuel |title=My Life and Work: An Autobiography of Henry Ford|year=1922|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=22786&amp;pageno=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Electrification]] was called "the most important engineering achievement of the 20th century" by the [[National Academy of Engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Century of Innovation: Twenty Engineering Achievements That Transformed Our Lives |last=Constable |first=George|authorlink= |author2=Somerville, Bob  |year=2003 |publisher=Joseph Henry Press|location=Washington, DC |isbn= 0-309-08908-5 |pages= |url=http://www.greatachievements.org/?id=2988 }} (Viewable on line)&lt;/ref&gt; Electric lighting in factories greatly improved working conditions, eliminating the heat and pollution caused by gas lighting, and reducing the fire hazard to the extent that the cost of electricity for lighting was often offset by the reduction in fire insurance premiums. [[Frank J. Sprague]] developed the first successful DC motor in 1886. By 1889 110 electric [[tram|street railways]] were either using his equipment or in planning.  The electric street railway became a major infrastructure before 1920.  The AC ([[Induction motor]]) was developed in the 1890s and soon began to be used in the [[electrification#History of electrification|electrification]] of industry.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book |title= Electrifying America: Social Meanings of a New Technology|last=Nye |first=David E.|authorlink=  |year=1990 |publisher= The MIT Press |isbn= |pages=14, 15 |url= |location= Cambridge, MA; London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Household electrification did not become common until the 1920s, and then only in cities. [[Fluorescent light]]ing was commercially introduced at the [[1939 World's Fair]].

Electrification also allowed the inexpensive production of [[Electrochemistry#19th century|electro-chemicals]], such as aluminium, chlorine, sodium hydroxide, and magnesium.&lt;ref name ="McNeil1990"&gt;{{cite book |title=An Encyclopedia of the History of Technology |last=McNeil |first=Ian|authorlink= |year=1990 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=0-415-14792-1 |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Machine tools ===
{{Main|Machine tool}}
[[File:JFIScrewThread300.png|thumb|A graphic representation of formulas for the pitches of threads of screw bolts.]]

The use of [[machine tool]]s began with the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution|First Industrial Revolution]]. The increase in [[mechanization]] required more metal parts, which were usually made of [[cast iron]] or [[wrought iron]]—and hand working lacked precision and was a slow and expensive process. One of the first machine tools was [[John Wilkinson (industrialist)|John Wilkinson]]'s boring machine, that bored a precise hole in [[James Watt]]'s first steam engine in 1774. Advances in the accuracy of machine tools can be traced to [[Henry Maudslay]] and refined by [[Joseph Whitworth]]. Standardization of screw threads began with [[Henry Maudslay]] around 1800, when the modern [[screw-cutting lathe]] made [[interchangeable parts|interchangeable]] V-thread machine screws a practical commodity.

In 1841, [[Joseph Whitworth]] created a design that, through its adoption by many British railroad companies, became the world's first national machine tool standard called [[British Standard Whitworth]].&lt;ref name="Roe1916pp9-10"&gt;{{Harvnb|Roe|1916}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=X-EJAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA9#v=onepage&amp;f=false pp. 9–10.]&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1840s through 1860s, this standard was often used in the United States and Canada as well, in addition to myriad intra- and inter-company standards.

The importance of [[machine tools]] to mass production is shown by the fact that production of the [[Ford Model T]] used 32,000 machine tools, most of which were powered by electricity.&lt;ref name ="Hounshell1984"&gt;{{Hounshell1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry Ford]] is quoted as saying that mass production would not have been possible without electricity because it allowed placement of machine tools and other equipment in the order of the work flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Edison as I Know Him |last=Ford |first=Henry |authorlink= |author2=Crowther, Samuel |year=1930 |publisher= Cosmopolitan Book Company |isbn= |pages=30 |url= |location= New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Paper making ===
{{Main|Paper machine}}
The first paper making machine was the [[Fourdrinier machine]], built by Sealy and [[Henry Fourdrinier]], stationers in [[London]]. In 1800, [[Matthias Koops]], working in London, investigated the idea of using wood to make paper, and began his printing business a year later. However, his enterprise was unsuccessful due to the prohibitive cost at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Carruthers, George. Paper in the Making. Toronto: The Garden City Press Co-Operative, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthew, H.C.G. and Brian Harrison. "Koops. Matthias." ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography: from the earliest times to the year 2000'', Vol. 32. London: Oxford University Press, 2004: 80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burger, Peter. Charles Fenerty and his Paper Invention. Toronto: Peter Burger, 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-9783318-1-8}}. pp. 30–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was in the 1840s,  that [[Charles Fenerty]] in [[Nova Scotia]] and [[Friedrich Gottlob Keller]] in [[Saxony]] both invented a successful machine which extracted the fibres from wood (as with rags) and from it, made paper. This started a new era for [[History of paper|paper making]],&lt;ref&gt;Burger, Peter. Charles Fenerty and his Paper Invention. Toronto: Peter Burger, 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-9783318-1-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, together with the invention of the [[fountain pen]] and the mass-produced [[pencil]] of the same period, and in conjunction with the advent of the steam driven rotary [[printing press]], wood based paper caused a major transformation of the 19th century economy and society in industrialized countries. With the introduction of cheaper paper, schoolbooks, fiction, non-fiction, and newspapers became gradually available by 1900. Cheap wood based paper also allowed keeping personal diaries or writing letters and so, by 1850, the [[clerk (position)|clerk]], or writer, ceased to be a high-status job. By the 1880s chemical processes for paper manufacture were in use, becoming dominant by 1900.

=== Petroleum ===
The [[petroleum industry#History|petroleum industry]], both production and [[Petroleum refinery|refining]], began in 1848 with the first oil works in Scotland. The chemist [[James Young (Scottish chemist)|James Young]] set up a small business refining the crude oil in 1848. Young found that by slow distillation he could obtain a number of useful liquids from it, one of which he named "paraffine oil" because at low temperatures it congealed into a substance resembling paraffin wax.&lt;ref name=russell&gt;{{cite book | last = Russell | first = Loris S. | authorlink = | title = A Heritage of Light: Lamps and Lighting in the Early Canadian Home | publisher = University of Toronto Press | year = 2003 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-8020-3765-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1850 Young built the first truly commercial oil-works and oil refinery in the world at [[Bathgate]], using oil extracted from locally mined [[torbanite]], shale, and bituminous coal to manufacture [[naphtha]] and lubricating oils; paraffin for fuel use and solid paraffin were not sold till 1856.

[[Drilling rig#Cable tool drilling|Cable tool drilling]] was developed in ancient China and was used for drilling brine wells.  The salt domes also held natural gas, which some wells produced and which was used for evaporation of the brine.  Chinese well drilling technology was introduced to Europe in 1828.&lt;ref&gt;

Although there were many efforts in the mid-19th century to drill for oil [[Edwin Drake]]'s 1859 well near Titusville, Pennsylvania, is considered the first "modern oil well".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vArc08DO9ykC&amp;pg=PA13 M.

S.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Temple|1986|pp=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first primary product was kerosene for lamps and heaters.&lt;ref name ="McNeil1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name = Yergin&gt;{{cite book|title=The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money &amp; Power|last=Yergin|first=Daniel|authorlink=|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar developments around [[Petroleum industry in Azerbaijan|Baku]] fed the European market.

Kerosene lighting was much more efficient and less expensive than vegetable oils, tallow and whale oil.  Although town gas lighting was available in some cities, kerosene produced a brighter light until the invention of the [[gas mantle]]. Both were replaced by electricity for street lighting following the 1890s and for households during the 1920s. [[Gasoline]] was an unwanted byproduct of oil refining until automobiles were mass-produced after 1914, and gasoline shortages appeared during World War I. The invention of the [[Burton process]] for [[cracking (chemistry)|thermal cracking]] doubled the yield of gasoline, which helped alleviate the shortages.&lt;ref name = Yergin/&gt;

=== Chemical ===
[[File:BASF Werk Ludwigshafen 1881.JPG|thumb|The [[BASF]]-chemical factories in [[Ludwigshafen]], Germany, 1881]]
[[Synthetic dye]] was discovered by English chemist [[William Henry Perkin]] in 1856. At the time, chemistry was still in a quite primitive state; it was still a difficult proposition to determine the arrangement of the elements in compounds and chemical industry was still in its infancy. Perkin's accidental discovery was that [[aniline]] could be partly transformed into a crude mixture which when extracted with alcohol produced a substance with an intense purple colour. He scaled up production of the new "[[mauveine]]", and commercialized it as the world's first synthetic dye.&lt;ref name="chemistry.msu.edu"&gt;Michigan State University, Department of Chemistry website.{{cite web |url=http://www.chemistry.msu.edu/Portraits/PortraitsHH_Detail.asp?HH_LName=Perkin |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030202902/http://www.chemistry.msu.edu/Portraits/PortraitsHH_Detail.asp?HH_LName=Perkin |archivedate=2007-10-30 |df= }} Accessed 18 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the discovery of mauveine, many new [[aniline dye]]s appeared (some discovered by Perkin himself), and factories producing them were constructed across Europe.
Towards the end of the century, Perkin and other British companies found their research and development efforts increasingly eclipsed by the German chemical industry which became world dominant by 1914.

=== Maritime technology ===
[[File:Launch-of-the-SS-GB.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The launch of [[SS Great Britain|''Great Britain'']], which was advanced for her time, 1843.|alt=A crowd of people watch a large black and red ship with one funnel and six masts adorned with flags]]
This era saw the birth of the modern ship as disparate technological advances came together.

The [[propeller (marine)|screw propeller]] was introduced in 1835 by [[Francis Pettit Smith]] who discovered a new way of building propellers by accident. Up to that time, propellers were literally screws, of considerable length. But during the testing of a boat propelled by one, the screw snapped off, leaving a fragment shaped much like a modern boat propeller. The boat moved faster with the broken propeller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boatbuilding.com/article.php/designofpropellers1 |title=History and Design of Propellers: Part 1 |publisher=the boatbuilding.community |accessdate=2007-09-03 |date=2004-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070811200813/http://www.boatbuilding.com/article.php/designofpropellers1 |archivedate=2007-08-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The superiority of screw against paddles was taken up by navies. Trials with Smith's [[SS Archimedes|SS ''Archimedes'']], the first steam driven screw, led to the famous tug-of-war competition in 1845 between the screw-driven {{HMS|Rattler|1843|6}} and the paddle steamer {{HMS|Alecto|1839|6}}; the former pulling the latter backward at 2.5 knots (4.6&amp;nbsp;km/h).

The first seagoing iron steamboat was built by [[Horseley Ironworks]] and named the ''[[Aaron Manby]]''. It also used an innovative oscillating engine for power. The boat was built at Tipton using temporary bolts, disassembled for transportation to London, and reassembled on the Thames in 1822, this time using permanent rivets.

Other technological developments followed, including the invention of the [[surface condenser]], which allowed boilers to run on purified water rather than salt water, eliminating the need to stop to clean them on long sea journeys. The ''[[SS Great Western|Great Western]]''&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan (2006), pp. 57–59&lt;/ref&gt;
,&lt;ref name="Beckett 2006, pp. 171–173"&gt;Beckett (2006), pp. 171–173&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dumpleton and Miller (2002), pp. 34–46&lt;/ref&gt; built by engineer [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]], was the longest ship in the world at {{convert|236|ft|m|abbr=on}} with a {{convert|250|ft|m|adj=on}} [[keel]] and was the first to prove that transatlantic steamship services were viable. The ship was constructed mainly from wood, but Brunel added bolts and iron diagonal reinforcements to maintain the keel's strength. In addition to its steam-powered [[paddle wheel]]s, the ship carried four masts for sails.

Brunel followed this up with the [[SS Great Britain|''Great Britain'']], launched in 1843 and considered the first modern ship built of metal rather than wood, powered by an engine rather than wind or oars, and driven by propeller rather than paddle wheel.&lt;ref&gt;Lienhard, John H (2003). ''The Engines of Our Ingenuity''. [[Oxford University Press]] (US). {{ISBN|978-0-19-516731-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Brunel's vision and engineering innovations made the building of large-scale, propeller-driven, all-metal steamships a practical reality, but the prevailing economic and industrial conditions meant that it would be several decades before transoceanic steamship travel emerged as a viable industry.

Highly efficient [[Steam engine#Multiple expansion engines|multiple expansion steam engines]] began being used on ships, allowing them to carry less coal than freight.&lt;ref name="Wells1890"/&gt; [[Marine steam engine#Oscillating|The oscillating engine]] was first built by [[Aaron Manby (ironmaster)|Aaron Manby]] and Joseph Maudslay in the 1820s as a type of direct-acting engine that was designed to achieve further reductions in engine size and weight. Oscillating engines had the piston rods connected directly to the crankshaft, dispensing with the need for connecting rods. In order to achieve this aim, the engine cylinders were not immobile as in most engines, but secured in the middle by trunnions which allowed the cylinders themselves to pivot back and forth as the crankshaft rotated, hence the term ''oscillating''.

It was [[John Penn (engineer)|John Penn]], engineer for the [[Royal Navy]] who perfected the oscillating engine. One of his earliest engines was the [[grasshopper beam engine]]. In 1844 he replaced the engines of the [[Admiralty]] yacht, {{HMS|Black Eagle}} with oscillating engines of double the power, without increasing either the weight or space occupied, an achievement which broke the naval supply dominance of [[Boulton &amp; Watt]] and [[Henry Maudslay|Maudslay, Son &amp; Field]]. Penn also introduced the [[marine steam engine#Trunk|trunk engine]] for driving screw propellers in vessels of war. {{HMS|Encounter|1846|6}} (1846) and {{HMS|Arrogant|1848|6}} (1848) were the first ships to be fitted with such engines and such was their efficacy that by the time of Penn's death in 1878, the engines had been fitted in 230 ships and were the first mass-produced, high-pressure and high-revolution marine engines.&lt;ref&gt;Osbon, G. A., 1965, The Crimean War gunboats. Part. 1. The Mariner's Mirror, The Journal of the Society of Nautical Research. 51, 103–116 &amp; Preston, A., &amp; Major, 1965, J., Send a gunboat. Longmans, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

The revolution in naval design led to the first modern [[battleship]]s in the 1870s, evolved from the [[ironclad]] design of the 1860s. The [[Devastation-class ironclad|''Devastation''-class]] [[turret ship]]s were built for the British [[Royal Navy]] as the first class of ocean-going [[capital ship]] that did not carry [[sail]]s, and the first whose entire main armament was mounted on top of the hull rather than inside it.

===Rubber===
The [[vulcanization]] of [[rubber]], by American [[Charles Goodyear]] and Englishman [[Thomas Hancock (inventor)|Thomas Hancock]] in the 1840s paved the way for a growing rubber industry, especially the manufacture of [[Tyres|rubber tyre]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=1493: Uncovering the New World Columbus Created|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Veu9u0brhrcC&amp;pg=PA245 |pages=244–245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Boyd Dunlop]] developed the first practical [[pneumatic]] tyre in 1887 in South Belfast. [[Willie Hume]] demonstrated the supremacy of Dunlop's newly invented pneumatic tyres in 1889, winning the tyre's first ever races in Ireland and then England.&lt;ref name="Gold Hume"&gt;[http://www.thepedalclub.org/archives/goldenbook/u-z/WilliamHume.html The Golden Book of Cycling - William Hume, 1938.

&lt;ref name="Dunlop time"&gt;[http://www.dunlop.eu/dunlop_uk/what_sets_dunlop_apart/history/ Dunlop, What sets Dunlop apart, History, 1889]&lt;/ref&gt; Dunlop's development of the pneumatic tyre arrived at a crucial time in the development of [[road transport]] and commercial production began in late 1890.

===Bicycles===
The modern bicycle was designed by the English engineer [[Harry John Lawson]] in 1876, although it was [[John Kemp Starley]] who produced the first commercially successful safety bicycle a few years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.makingthemodernworld.org.uk/icons_of_invention/technology/1880-1939/IC.025/|title=Icons of Invention: Rover safety bicycle, 1885|publisher=The Science Museum.|accessdate=2010-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its popularity soon grew, causing the [[bike boom]] of the 1890s.

Road networks improved greatly in the period, using the [[Macadam]] method pioneered by Scottish engineer [[John Loudon McAdam]], and hard surfaced roads were built around the time of the bicycle craze of the 1890s. Modern [[Tarmacadam|tarmac]] was patented by British civil engineer [[Edgar Purnell Hooley]] in 1901.&lt;ref name=Morton2002&gt;{{citation |year=2002 |author=Ralph Morton|title=Construction UK: Introduction to the Industry| place=Oxford |publisher=Blackwell Science|page=51 |isbn=0-632-05852-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cW4CRawd1TgC&amp;pg=PA51 |accessdate=22 June 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Automobile===
German inventor [[Karl Benz]] patented the world's [[Benz Patent Motorwagen|first automobile]] in 1886. It featured wire wheels (unlike carriages' wooden ones)&lt;ref&gt;[[G.N. Georgano]] ''Cars: Early and Vintage, 1886-1930''. (London: Grange-Universal, 1985)&lt;/ref&gt; with a four-stroke engine of his own design between the rear wheels, with a very advanced coil ignition &lt;ref name="Georgano"&gt;[[G.N. Georgano]]&lt;/ref&gt; and evaporative cooling rather than a radiator.&lt;ref name="Georgano"/&gt; Power was transmitted by means of two [[roller chain]]s to the rear axle. It was the first [[automobile]] entirely designed as such to generate its own power, not simply a motorized-stage coach or horse carriage.

Benz began to sell the vehicle (advertising it as the Benz Patent Motorwagen) in the late summer of 1888, making it the first commercially available automobile in history.

[[Henry Ford]] built his first car in 1896 and worked as a pioneer in the industry, with others who would eventually form their own companies, until the founding of Ford Motor Company in 1903.&lt;ref name="Ford1922" /&gt; Ford and others at the company struggled with ways to scale up production in keeping with Henry Ford's vision of a car designed and manufactured on a scale so as to be affordable by the average worker.&lt;ref name="Ford1922" /&gt; The solution that Ford Motor developed was a completely redesigned factory with [[machine tools]] and special purpose machines that were systematically positioned in the work sequence. All unnecessary human motions were eliminated by placing all work and tools within easy reach, and where practical on conveyors, forming the [[assembly line]], the complete process being called [[mass production]]. This was the first time in history when a large, complex product consisting of 5000 parts had been produced on a scale of hundreds of thousands per year.&lt;ref name ="Ford1922" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hounshell1984" /&gt; The savings from [[mass production]] methods allowed the price of the [[Model T]] to decline from $780 in 1910 to $360 in 1916. In 1924 2 million T-Fords were produced and retailed $290 each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mass Production, the Stock Market Crash and the Great Depression |last=Beaudreau |first=Bernard C. |authorlink= |year=1996 |publisher=Authors Choice Press|location=New York, Lincoln, Shanghi |isbn= |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Applied science===
[[Applied science]] opened many opportunities. By the middle of the 19th century there was a scientific understanding of chemistry and a fundamental understanding of [[thermodynamics]] and by the last quarter of the century both of these sciences were near their present-day basic form. Thermodynamic principles were used in the development of [[physical chemistry]]. Understanding chemistry greatly aided the development of basic inorganic chemical manufacturing and the aniline dye industries.

The science of [[metallurgy]] was advanced through the work of [[Henry Clifton Sorby]] and others. Sorby pioneered the study of [[iron]] and [[steel]] under [[microscope]], which paved the way for a scientific understanding of metal and the mass-production of steel. In 1863 he used etching with acid to study the microscopic structure of metals and was the first to understand that a small but precise quantity of carbon gave steel its strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography of Henry Clifton Sorby|url=http://www.sorby.org.uk/hcsorby.shtml|accessdate=22 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205211758/http://www.sorby.org.uk/hcsorby.shtml|archivedate=5 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This paved the way for [[Henry Bessemer]] and [[Robert Forester Mushet]] to develop the method for mass-producing steel.

Other processes were developed for purifying various elements such as [[chromium]], [[molybdenum]], [[titanium]], [[vanadium]] and [[nickel]] which could be used for making alloys with special properties, especially with steel. [[Vanadium steel]], for example, is strong and fatigue resistant, and was used in half the automotive steel.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Watts, ''The People's Tycoon: Henry Ford and the American Century'' (2006) p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;  Alloy steels were used for ball bearings which were used in large scale bicycle production in the 1880s.  Ball and roller bearings also began being used in machinery.  Other important alloys are used in high temperatures, such as steam turbine blades, and stainless steels for corrosion resistance.

The work of [[Justus von Liebig]] and [[August Wilhelm von Hofmann]] laid the groundwork for modern industrial chemistry. Liebig is considered the "father of the fertilizer industry" for his discovery of [[nitrogen]] as an essential plant nutrient and went on to establish [[Liebig's Extract of Meat Company]] which produced the [[Oxo (food)|Oxo]] [[meat extract]]. Hofmann headed a school of practical chemistry in London, under the style of the [[Royal College of Chemistry]], introduced modern conventions for [[molecular modeling]] and taught Perkin who discovered the first synthetic dye.

The science of [[thermodynamics]] was developed into its modern form by [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]], [[William Rankine]], [[Rudolf Clausius]], [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]], [[James Clerk Maxwell]], [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] and [[J. Willard Gibbs]]. These scientific principles were applied to a variety of industrial concerns, including improving the efficiency of boilers and [[steam turbine]]s. The work of [[Michael Faraday]] and others was pivotal in laying the foundations of the modern scientific understanding of [[electricity]].

Scottish scientist [[James Clerk Maxwell]] was particularly influential—his discoveries ushered in the era of [[modern physics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/HistTopics/Knots_and_physics.html |title=Topology and Scottish mathematical physics |publisher=University of St Andrews |accessdate=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His most prominent achievement was to formulate a [[Maxwell's equations|set of equations]] that described [[electricity]], [[magnetism]], and [[optics]] as manifestations of the same [[phenomenon]], namely the [[electromagnetic field]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=James Clerk Maxwell |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/James_Clerk_Maxwell |accessdate=25 March 2013 |publisher=IEEE Global History Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unification of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of [[radio waves]] and was the basis for the future development of radio technology by [[David Edward Hughes|Hughes]], [[Guglielmo Marconi|Marconi]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Maxwell |first=James Clerk |title=A dynamical theory of the electromagnetic field |url=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/A_Dynamical_Theory_of_the_Electromagnetic_Field.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London |volume=155 |pages=459–512 |year=1865 |bibcode=1865RSPT..155..459C |doi=10.1098/rstl.1865.0008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maxwell himself developed the first durable [[Color photography|colour photograph]] in 1861 and published the first scientific treatment of [[control theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Maxwell, James Clerk |year=1868 |title=On Governors |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London |volume=16 |pages=270–283 |doi=10.1098/rspl.1867.0055 |jstor=112510}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mayr |first=Otto | author-link= Otto Mayr | title=Maxwell and the Origins of Cybernetics |journal=Isis |volume=62 |issue=4 |year=1971 |pages=424–444 |doi=10.1086/350788}}&lt;/ref&gt; Control theory is the basis for [[process control]], which is widely used in [[automation]], particularly for [[process industries]], and for controlling ships and airplanes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Control Engineering 1800–1930 |last=Benett|first= Stuart|authorlink=|year=1986|publisher =Institution of Engineering and Technology

These governors came into use in the late 18th century on wind and water mills to correctly position the gap between mill stones, and were adapted to steam engines by [[James Watt]].  Improved versions were used to stabilize automatic tracking mechanisms of telescopes and to control speed of ship propellers and rudders.  However, those governors were sluggish and oscillated about the [[Setpoint (control system)|set point]]. [[James Clerk Maxwell]] wrote a paper mathematically analyzing the actions of governors, which marked the beginning of the formal development of control theory.  The science was continually improved and evolved into an engineering discipline.

===Fertilizer===
[[Justus von Liebig]] was the first to understand the importance of [[ammonia]] as [[fertilizer]], and promoted the importance of inorganic minerals to [[plant nutrition]]. In England, he attempted to implement his theories commercially through a fertilizer created by treating [[phosphate of lime]] in bone meal with [[sulfuric acid]]. Another pioneer was [[John Bennet Lawes]] who began to experiment on the effects of various manures on plants growing in pots in 1837, leading to a manure formed by treating phosphates with sulphuric acid; this was to be the first product of the nascent artificial manure industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Lawes, Sir John Bennet |volume=16 |page=300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovery of [[Coprolite#Coprolite mining|coprolites]] in commercial quantities in [[East Anglia]], led Fisons and [[Edward Packard (businessman, born 1819)|Edward Packard]] to develop one of the first large-scale commercial fertilizer plants at [[Bramford]], and [[Snape, Suffolk|Snape]] in the 1850s. By the 1870s [[superphosphate]]s produced in those factories, were being shipped around the world from the port at [[Ipswich]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yara.com/en/about/history/stories/fisons_inter.html History of Fisons at Yara.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060520151251/http://www.yara.com/en/about/history/stories/fisons_inter.html |date=2006-05-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/templates/article.jsp?articleid=50172&amp;back=|title=Oxford DNB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Birkeland–Eyde process]] was developed by Norwegian industrialist and scientist [[Kristian Birkeland]] along with his business partner [[Sam Eyde]] in 1903,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The development of modern chemistry|author=Aaron John Ihde|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|year=1984|isbn=0486642356|page=678}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was soon replaced by the much more efficient [[Haber process]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A short history of twentieth-century technology c. 1900-c. 1950|author1=Trevor Illtyd Williams|author2=Thomas Kingston Derry|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1982|isbn=0198581599|pages=134–135}}&lt;/ref&gt;
developed by the [[Nobel prize]]-winning chemists [[Carl Bosch]] of [[IG Farben]] and [[Fritz Haber]] in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/haberbosch.html Haber &amp; Bosch ''Most influential persons of the 20th century''], by [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]]&lt;/ref&gt; The process utilized molecular nitrogen (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) gas in an economically sustainable synthesis of [[ammonia]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). The ammonia produced in the Haber process is the main raw material for production of [[nitric acid]].

===Engines and turbines===
The [[steam turbine]] was developed by Sir [[Charles Algernon Parsons|Charles Parsons]] in 1884. His first model was connected to a [[dynamo]] that generated 7.5&amp;nbsp;kW (10&amp;nbsp;hp) of electricity.&lt;ref name="birrcastle.com"&gt;[http://www.birrcastle.com/steamTurbineAndElectricity.asp ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510152751/http://www.birrcastle.com/steamTurbineAndElectricity.asp |date=May 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The invention of Parson's steam turbine made cheap and plentiful electricity possible and revolutionized [[Turbinia|marine transport and naval warfare]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universityscience.ie/pages/scientists/sci_charles_parsons.php ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080110063209/http://www.universityscience.ie/pages/scientists/sci_charles_parsons.php |date=January 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of Parson's death, his turbine had been adopted for all major world power stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike earlier steam engines, the turbine produced rotary power rather than reciprocating power which required a crank and heavy flywheel. The large number of stages of the turbine allowed for high efficiency and reduced size by 90%. The turbine's first application was in shipping followed by electric generation in 1903.

The first widely used [[internal combustion engine]] was the [[Otto engine|Otto type]] of 1876. From the 1880s until electrification it was successful in small shops because small steam engines were inefficient and required too much operator attention.&lt;ref name="Smil2005" /&gt; The Otto engine soon began being used to power automobiles, and remains as today's common gasoline engine.

The [[diesel engine]] was independently designed by [[Rudolf Diesel]] and [[Herbert Akroyd Stuart]] in the 1890s using thermodynamic principles with the specific intention of being highly efficient. It took several years to perfect and become popular, but found application in shipping before powering locomotives. It remains the world's most efficient prime mover.&lt;ref name="Smil2005" /&gt;

===Telecommunications===
[[File:1891 Telegraph Lines.jpg|thumb|400px|Major telegraph lines in 1891.]]
The first commercial [[telegraph]] system was installed by Sir [[William Fothergill Cooke]] and [[Charles Wheatstone]] in May 1837 between [[Euston railway station]] and [[Camden Town]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.connected-earth.com/journeys/Firstgenerationtechnologies/Thetelegraph/Thetelegraphicagedawns/index.htm The telegraphic age dawns]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6EKr7FUkw?url=http://www.connected-earth.com/journeys/Firstgenerationtechnologies/Thetelegraph/Thetelegraphicagedawns/index.htm |date=2013-02-10 }} BT Group Connected Earth Online Museum.

The rapid expansion of telegraph networks took place throughout the century, with the first [[undersea cable]] being built by [[John Watkins Brett]] between [[France]] and [[England]].
The [[Atlantic Telegraph Company]] was formed in [[London]] in 1856 to undertake to construct a commercial telegraph cable across the Atlantic Ocean. This was successfully completed on 18 July 1866 by the ship [[SS Great Eastern|SS ''Great Eastern'']], captained by [[Sir James Anderson]] after many mishaps along the away.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Arthur (1994). The Living Rock: The Story of Metals Since Earliest Times and Their Impact on Civilization. p. 203. Woodhead Publishing. {{ISBN|978-1-85573-301-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1850s until 1911, British submarine cable systems dominated the world system. This was set out as a formal strategic goal, which became known as the [[All Red Line]].&lt;ref name="kennedy197110"&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=563928| title=Imperial Cable Communications and Strategy, 1870-1914 | author=Kennedy, P.

The [[telephone]] was patented in 1876 by [[Alexander Graham Bell]], and like the early telegraph, it was used mainly to speed business transactions.&lt;ref&gt;Richard John, ''Network Nation: Inventing American Telecommunications''  (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

As mentioned above, one of the most important scientific advancements in all of history was the unification of light, electricity and magnetism through [[Maxwell's equations|Maxwell's electromagnetic theory]]. A scientific understanding of electricity was necessary for the development of efficient electric generators, motors and transformers. [[David Edward Hughes]] and [[Heinrich Hertz]] both demonstrated and confirmed the phenomenon of electromagnetic waves that had been predicted by Maxwell.&lt;ref name="Smil2005" /&gt;

It was Italian inventor [[Guglielmo Marconi]] who successfully commercialized radio at the turn of the century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Amit|last=Roy|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1081208/jsp/nation/story_10221833.jsp|work=The Telegraph|location=[[Kolkota]]|title=Cambridge 'pioneer' honour for Bose|date=8 December 2008|accessdate=10 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He founded [[Marconi Company|The Wireless Telegraph &amp; Signal Company]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] in 1897&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Icons of invention: the makers of the modern world from Gutenberg to Gates|publisher=ABC-CLIO|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WKuG-VIwID8C&amp;pg=PA161|accessdate=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ingenious Ireland: A County-by-County Exploration of the Mysteries and Marvels of the Ingenious Irish|publisher=Simon and Schuster|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=exics12jmtwC&amp;pg=PA313|accessdate=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the same year transmitted [[Morse code]] across [[Salisbury Plain]], sent the first ever wireless communication over open sea&lt;ref&gt;BBC Wales, [https://web.archive.org/web/20070120163444/http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/historyhunters/locations/pages/3_1_flatholm.shtml Marconi's Waves]&lt;/ref&gt; and made the first transatlantic transmission in 1901 from [[Poldhu]], [[Cornwall]] to [[Signal Hill (Newfoundland and Labrador)|Signal Hill]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]. Marconi built high-powered stations on both sides of the Atlantic and began a commercial service to transmit nightly news summaries to subscribing ships in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Clifden Station of the Marconi Wireless Telegraph System|journal=Scientific American|date=23 November 1907}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The key development of the [[vacuum tube]] by Sir [[John Ambrose Fleming]] in 1904 underpinned the development of modern electronics and radio broadcasting. [[Lee De Forest]]'s subsequent invention of the [[triode]] allowed the amplification of electronic signals, which paved the way for radio broadcasting in the 1920s.

===Modern business management===
Railroads are credited with creating the modern [[business enterprise]] by scholars such as Alfred Chandler.  Previously, the management of most businesses had consisted of individual owners or groups of partners, some of whom often had little daily hands-on operations involvement.  Centralized expertise in the home office was not enough.  A railroad required expertise available across the whole length of its trackage, to deal with daily crises, breakdowns and bad weather.    A collision in Massachusetts in 1841 led to a call for safety reform.  This led to the reorganization of railroads into different departments with clear lines of management authority.  When the telegraph became available, companies built telegraph lines  along the railroads to keep track of trains.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Railroads involved complex operations and employed extremely large amounts of capital and ran a more complicated business compared to anything previous.  Consequently, they needed better ways to track costs.  For example, to calculate rates they needed to know the cost of a ton-mile of freight.  They also needed to keep track of cars, which could go missing for months at a time.  This led to what was called "railroad accounting", which was later adopted by steel and other industries, and eventually became modern accounting.&lt;ref&gt;Compare: {{cite book |last= Chandler Jr. |first= Alfred |date= 1993 |title= The Visible Hand|publisher= Harvard University Press|page= 115 |isbn= 0674417682 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=lAI3AwAAQBAJ | access-date = 2017-06-29 | quote = [...] American railroad accounting overstated operating costs and understated capital consumption.[...] The basic innovations in financial and capital accounting appeared in the 1850s in response to specific needs and were perfected in the years after the Civil War.

&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Later in the Second Industrial Revolution, [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]] and others in America developed the concept of [[scientific management]] or [[Taylorism]]. Scientific management initially concentrated on reducing the steps taken in performing work (such as bricklaying or shoveling) by using analysis such as [[time and motion study|time-and-motion studies]], but the concepts evolved into fields such as [[industrial engineering]], [[manufacturing engineering]], and [[business management]] that helped to completely restructure{{cn|date=June 2017}} the operations of factories, and later entire segments of the economy.

Taylor's core principles included:{{cn|date=June 2017}}

* replacing rule-of-thumb work methods with methods based on a scientific study of the tasks
* scientifically selecting, training, and developing each employee rather than passively leaving them to train themselves
* providing "detailed instruction and supervision of each worker in the performance of that worker's discrete task"
* dividing work nearly equally between managers and workers, such that the managers apply scientific-management principles to planning the work and the workers actually perform the tasks

==Socio-economic impacts==
The period from 1870 to 1890 saw the greatest increase in economic growth in such a short period as ever in previous history. Living standards improved significantly in the newly industrialized countries as the prices of goods fell dramatically due to the increases in [[Productivity improving technologies (historical)|productivity]].  This caused [[unemployment]] and great upheavals in commerce and industry, with many laborers being displaced by machines and many factories, ships and other forms of fixed capital becoming obsolete in a very short time span.&lt;ref name="Wells1890"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The economic changes that have occurred during the last quarter of a century -or during the present generation of living men- have unquestionably been more important and more varied than during any period of the world's history".&lt;ref name ="Wells1890"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Crop failures no longer resulted in starvation in areas connected to large markets through transport infrastructure.&lt;ref name="Wells1890"/&gt;

Massive improvements in public health and sanitation resulted from [[public health]] initiatives, such as the construction of the [[London sewerage system]] in the 1860s and the passage of laws that regulated filtered water supplies—(the [[Metropolis Water Act 1852|Metropolis Water Act]] introduced regulation of the water supply companies in [[London]], including minimum standards of water quality for the first time in 1852). This greatly reduced the infection and death rates from many diseases.

By 1870 the work done by steam engines exceeded that done by animal and human power.  Horses and mules remained important in agriculture until the development of the internal combustion tractor near the end of the Second Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Ayres|last2=Warr|first1=Robert U.|first2 = Benjamin|author1-link =|title=Accounting for Growth: The Role of Physical Work|year=2004|url=http://www.iea.org/work/2004/eewp/Ayres-paper1.pdf|postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Improvements in steam efficiency, like [[triple-expansion steam engine]]s, allowed ships to carry much more freight than coal, resulting in greatly increased volumes of international trade.  Higher steam engine efficiency caused the number of steam engines to increase several fold, leading to an increase in coal usage, the phenomenon being called the [[Jevons paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

By 1890 there was an international telegraph network allowing orders to be placed by merchants in England or the US to suppliers in India and China for goods to be transported in efficient new steamships.  This, plus the opening of the [[Suez Canal]], led to the decline of the great warehousing districts in London and elsewhere, and the elimination of many middlemen.&lt;ref name="Wells1890"/&gt;

The tremendous growth in productivity, transportation networks, industrial production and agricultural output lowered the prices of almost all goods.  This led to many business failures and periods that were called ''depressions'' that occurred as the world economy actually grew.&lt;ref name="Wells1890"/&gt;  See also: [[Long depression]]

The factory system centralized production in separate buildings funded and directed by specialists (as opposed to work at home). The division of labor made both unskilled and skilled labor more productive, and led to a rapid growth of population in industrial centers. The shift away from agriculture toward industry had occurred in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] by the 1730s, when the percentage of the working population engaged in agriculture fell below 50%, a development that would only happen elsewhere (the [[Low Countries]]) in the 1830s and '40s. By 1890, the figure had fallen to under 10% percent and the vast majority of the British population was [[urbanization|urbanized]]. This milestone was reached by the [[Low Countries]] and the US in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=David Grigg|title=Agriculture in the World Economy: an Historical Geography of Decline|journal=|jstor=40572192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the first industrial revolution, the second supported population growth and saw most governments protect their national economies with tariffs. Britain retained its belief in [[free trade]] throughout this period.  The wide-ranging social impact of both revolutions included the remaking of the working class as new technologies appeared. The changes resulted in the creation of a larger, increasingly professional, middle class, the decline of child labor and the dramatic growth of a consumer-based, material culture.&lt;ref&gt;Hull (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1900, the leaders in industrial production was Britain with 24% of the world total, followed by the US (19%), Germany (13%), Russia (9%) and France (7%). Europe together accounted for 62%.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kennedy, ''The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers'' (1987) p. 149, based on Paul Bairoch, "International Industrialization Levels from 1750 to 1980," ''Journal of European Economic History'' (1982) v. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

The great inventions and innovations of the Second Industrial Revolution are part of our modern life.  They continued to be drivers of the economy until after WWII.  Only a few major innovations occurred in the post-war era, some of which are: computers, semiconductors, the fiber optic network and the Internet, cellular telephones, [[combustion turbine]]s (jet engines) and the [[Green Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Century of Innovation: Twenty Engineering Achievements That Transformed Our Lives|last=Constable|first=George|authorlink=|author2=Somerville, Bob|year=2003|publisher=Joseph Henry Press|location=Washington, DC|isbn=0-309-08908-5|pages=|url=http://www.greatachievements.org/id=2988}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}This link is to entire on line book.&lt;/ref&gt; Although commercial aviation existed before WWII, it became a major industry after the war.

&lt;/ref&gt;]]
New products and services were introduced which greatly increased international trade. Improvements in [[steam engine]] design and the wide availability of cheap steel meant that slow, sailing ships were replaced with faster steamship, which could handle more trade with smaller crews. The [[history of chemical engineering|chemical]] industries also moved to the forefront. Britain invested less in technological research than the U.S. and Germany, which caught up.

The development of more intricate and efficient machines along with [[mass production]] techniques (after 1910) greatly expanded output and lowered production costs. As a result, production often exceeded domestic demand. Among the new conditions, more markedly evident in Britain, the forerunner of Europe's industrial states, were the long-term effects of the severe [[Long Depression]] of 1873–1896, which had followed fifteen years of great economic instability. Businesses in practically every industry suffered from lengthy periods of low &amp;mdash; and falling &amp;mdash; profit rates and price deflation after 1873.

==United States==
The U.S. had its highest economic growth rate in the last two decades of the Second Industrial Revolution;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Vatter | last2 = Walker| last3 =Alperovitz| first1 = Harold G.| first2 = John F.| first3 =Gar| author1-link =| title = The onset and persistence of secular stagnation in the U.S. economy: 1910–1990, Journal of Economic Issues| date = June 1995| url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa5437/is_n2_v29/ai_n28658086/| postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, population growth slowed while productivity growth peaked around the mid 20th century.  The [[Gilded Age]] in America was based on heavy industry such as factories, railroads and [[coal mining]].  The iconic event was the opening of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]] in 1869, providing six-day service between the East Coast and San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen E. Ambrose, ''Nothing Like It In The World; The men who built the Transcontinental Railroad 1863–1869'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Gilded Age, American railroad mileage tripled between 1860 and 1880, and tripled again by 1920, opening new areas to commercial farming, creating a truly national marketplace and inspiring a boom in coal mining and steel production. The voracious appetite for capital of the great trunk railroads facilitated the consolidation of the nation's financial market in [[Wall Street]]. By 1900, the process of economic concentration had extended into most branches of industry&amp;mdash;a few large corporations, some organized as "trusts" (e.g. Standard Oil), dominated in steel, oil, sugar, meatpacking, and the manufacture of agriculture machinery. Other major components of this infrastructure were the new methods for manufacturing steel, especially the [[Bessemer process]]. The first billion-dollar corporation was [[United States Steel]], formed by financier [[J. P. Morgan]] in 1901, who purchased and consolidated steel firms built by [[Andrew Carnegie]] and others.&lt;ref name="Edward C. Kirkland 1961"&gt;Edward C. Kirkland, ''Industry Comes of Age, Business, Labor, and Public Policy 1860–1897'' (1961)&lt;/ref&gt;

Increased mechanization of industry and improvements to worker efficiency, increased the productivity of factories while undercutting the need for skilled labor. Mechanical innovations such as batch and continuous processing began to become much more prominent in factories. This mechanization made some factories an assemblage of unskilled laborers performing simple and repetitive tasks under the direction of skilled foremen and engineers. In some cases, the advancement of such mechanization substituted for low-skilled workers altogether. Both the number of unskilled and skilled workers increased, as their wage rates grew&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Hovey Calhoun, ''The American Civil Engineer: Origins and Conflicts'' (1960)&lt;/ref&gt; Engineering colleges were established to feed the enormous demand for expertise. Together with rapid growth of small business, a new middle class was rapidly growing, especially in northern cities.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Licht, ''Working for the Railroad: The Organization of Work in the Nineteenth Century'' (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Employment distribution ===
In the early 1900s there was a disparity between the levels of employment seen in the northern and southern United States. On average, states in the North had both a higher population, and a higher rate of employment than states in the South. The higher rate of employment is easily seen by considering the 1909 rates of employment compared to the populations of each state in the 1910 census. This difference was most notable in the states with the largest populations, such as New York and Pennsylvania. Each of these states had roughly 5 percent more of the total US workforce than would be expected given their populations. Conversely, the states in the South with the best actual rates of employment, North Carolina and Georgia, had roughly 2 percent less of the workforce than one would expect from their population. When the averages of all southern states and all northern states are taken, the trend holds with the North over-performing by about 2 percent, and the South under-performing by about 1 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Steuart, William M. Abstract of the Census of Manufactures, 1914 .. Washington: Govt. Print. Off., 1917.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Germany==
The [[German Empire]] came to rival Britain as Europe's primary industrial nation during this period. Since Germany industrialized later, it was able to model its factories after those of Britain, thus making more efficient use of its capital and avoiding legacy methods in its leap to the envelope of technology. Germany invested more heavily than the British in research, especially in chemistry, motors and electricity. The German [[Concern (business)|concern]] system (known as ''Konzerne''), being significantly concentrated, was able to make more efficient use of capital.  Germany was not weighted down with an expensive worldwide empire that needed defense. Following Germany's annexation of [[Alsace-Lorraine]] in 1871, it absorbed parts of what had been France's industrial base.&lt;ref&gt;Broadberry and O'Rourke (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1900 the German chemical industry dominated the world market for [[Dye|synthetic dyes]]. The three major firms [[BASF]], [[Bayer]] and [[Hoechst AG|Hoechst]] produced several hundred different dyes, along with the five smaller firms. In 1913 these eight firms produced almost 90 percent of the world supply of dyestuffs, and sold about 80 percent of their production abroad.  The three major firms had also integrated upstream into the production of essential raw materials and they began to expand into other areas of chemistry such as [[Drug|pharmaceuticals]], [[photographic film]], [[Agrochemical|agricultural chemicals]] and [[Electrochemistry|electrochemical]]. Top-level decision-making was in the hands of professional salaried managers, leading Chandler to call the German dye companies "the world's first truly managerial industrial enterprises".&lt;ref&gt;Chandler (1990) p 474-5&lt;/ref&gt;  There were many spin offs from research—such as the pharmaceutical industry, which emerged from chemical research.&lt;ref&gt;Carsten Burhop, "Pharmaceutical Research in Wilhelmine Germany: the Case of E. Merck," ''Business History Review''. Volume: 83. Issue: 3. 2009. pp 475+. in [[ProQuest]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Belgium==
[[History of Belgium|Belgium]] during the [[Belle Époque]] showed the value of the [[History of rail transport|railways]] for speeding the Second Industrial Revolution. After 1830, when it [[Belgian Revolution|broke away from the Netherlands]] and became a new nation, it decided to stimulate industry. It planned and funded a simple cruciform system that connected major cities, ports and mining areas, and linked to neighboring countries. Belgium thus became the railway center of the region. [[History of rail transport in Belgium|The system]] was soundly built along British lines, so that profits were low but the infrastructure necessary for rapid industrial growth was put in place.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick O’Brien, ''Railways and the Economic Development of Western Europe, 1830–1914'' (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative uses==
There have been other times that have been called "second industrial revolution". Industrial revolutions may be renumbered by taking earlier developments, such as the rise of [[medieval technology]] in the 12th century, or of ancient Chinese technology during the [[Tang Dynasty]], or of [[ancient Roman technology]], as first. "Second industrial revolution" has been used in the popular press and by technologists or industrialists to refer to the changes following the spread of new technology after [[World War I]].

Excitement and debate over the dangers and benefits of the [[Atomic Age]] were more intense and lasting than those over the [[Space age]] but both were predicted to lead to another industrial revolution. At the start of the [[21st century]]&lt;ref&gt;google.com&lt;/ref&gt; the term "second industrial revolution" has been used to describe the anticipated effects of hypothetical [[molecular nanotechnology]] systems upon society. In this more recent scenario, they would render the majority of today's modern manufacturing processes obsolete, transforming all facets of the modern economy.

The '''Slovak National Museum''' ({{lang-sk|Slovenské národné múzeum}}) is the most important institution focusing on [[scientific research]] and cultural [[education]] in the field of [[museology]] in [[Slovakia]]. Its beginnings "are connected with the endeavour of the [[Slovaks|Slovak nation]] for national emancipation and self-determination".&lt;ref name = "SNM"&gt;{{cite web | publisher = City of Bratislava | url = http://www.snm.sk/?lang=eng&amp;org=0&amp;section=home&amp;show | title = Slovak national museum - Museum | date = n.d. |accessdate = April 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is headquartered in [[Bratislava]], however, the Slovak National Museum governs 18 specialized museums, most of which are located outside the city.

==History==
The Slovak National Museum (SNM) was established in 1961. Its origins lie in the [[Matica slovenská|Matica Slovenská]] Museum and the Museum of the National House in [[Martin, Slovakia|Martin]], which developed the Slovak Museology Society. The first permanent exposition funded from a national collection was opened in Martin in 1908. The museum was building [[Archaeology|archaeological]], [[Ethnography|ethnographic]], historical, [[numismatics|numismatic]], art historical, creative art and natural science collections. The Slovak National Geographic and History Museum was established in Bratislava in 1924 by the Slovak National Geographic and History Museum Society. The [[Agriculture|Agricultural]] Museum, a department of the [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] Agricultural Museum in [[Prague]], was established in Bratislava the same year. In 1940, the Slovak National Geographic and History Museum and the Agricultural Museum were merged into the Slovak Museum. In 1961, the Slovak Museum and the [[Slovak National Museum in Martin]] were merged into the Slovak National Museum, based in Bratislava.&lt;ref name = "SNM"/&gt;

On March 11, 2012, the Krásna Hôrka Castle (part of the SNM), was damaged by a fire started when two children were lighting cigarettes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2113802/Kosice-Slovakia-Children-burn-14th-century-castle-cigarette.html |title=14th century castle gutted in blaze sparked by two young boys who had sneaked into grounds to smoke their first cigarette |newspaper=Daily Mail |date=12 March 2012 |author=Tom Gardner |accessdate=3 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fire destroyed the roof but most of the historic collections were undamaged. The castle is expected to reopen in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spectator.sme.sk/c/20056484/burned-krasna-horka-castle-should-open-in-2018.html |title=Burned Krásna Hôrka Castle should open in 2018 |newspaper=The Spectator, Slovakia |date=10 March 2015 |accessdate=3 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The museum today==
[[Image:BA-riverfront-06.jpg|thumb|right|Slovak National Museum building in Bratislava, viewed from the right bank of the [[Danube]]]]
The Slovak National Museum is the most important scientific research and cultural education institution, with the largest and best collections in the museological field in Slovakia. The museum is also dedicated to scientific research tasks and [[publishing]] activities. Moreover, the SNM is "a coordination, methodological, professional advisory, statistical, educational and information centre for the whole field of museology in the Slovak Republic."&lt;ref name = "SNM"/&gt;

===Building===
The Slovak National Museum's headquarters are located on Vajanské nábrežie (a river front street in [[Old Town, Bratislava|Bratislava's Old Town]]), along with the Natural History Museum. The construction of the building, designed by architect M. M. Harminec, began in July 1925 and was completed in 1928. The museum opened on May 4, 1930.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5655">In [[biostatistics]],  '''spectrum bias''' refers to the phenomenon that the performance of a [[diagnostic test]] may vary in different clinical settings because each setting has a different mix of patients.&lt;ref name="pmid692598"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ransohoff DF, Feinstein AR |title=Problems of spectrum and bias in evaluating the efficacy of diagnostic tests |journal=N.

Mathematically, the spectrum bias is a [[sampling bias]] and not a traditional [[Bias (statistics)|statistical bias]]; this has led some authors to refer to the phenomenon as ''spectrum effects'',&lt;ref name="pmid12353947"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mulherin SA, Miller WC |title=Spectrum bias or spectrum effect?

However, other performance measures such as the [[Likelihood ratios in diagnostic testing|likelihood ratio]]s may also be affected by spectrum bias.&lt;ref name = "pmid18765409"/&gt;

Generally spectrum bias is considered to have three causes.&lt;ref name = "pmid18765409"/&gt; The first is due to a change in the case-mix of those patients with the target disorder (disease) and this affects the [[sensitivity (tests)|sensitivity]]. The second is due to a change in the case-mix of those without the target disorder (disease-free) and this affects the [[specificity (tests)|specificity]]. The third is due to a change in the prevalence, and this affects both the [[sensitivity (tests)|sensitivity]] and [[specificity (tests)|specificity]].&lt;ref name="pmid22307105" &gt;{{cite journal |last=Willis |first=BH |title=Evidence that disease prevalence may affect the performance of diagnostic tests with an implicit threshold: a cross sectional study |journal=[[BMJ Open]] |year=2012 |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=e000746 |pmid=22307105 |url=http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/2/1/e000746.full.pdf |doi=10.1136/bmjopen-2011-000746 |pmc=3274715}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; This final cause is not widely appreciated, but there is mounting [[empirical evidence]]&lt;ref name="pmid22307105"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="pmid18778913" &gt;Leeflang MM, Bossuyt PM, Irwig L., Diagnostic test accuracy may vary with prevalence: implications for evidence-based diagnosis, J Clin Epidemiol. 2009 Jan;62(1) 5-12.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as theoretical arguments&lt;ref name="pmid14695644"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Goehring C, Perrier A, Morabia A |title=Spectrum bias: a quantitative and graphical analysis of the variability of medical diagnostic test performance |journal=Statistics in Medicine |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=125–35 |year=2004 |pmid=14695644 |doi=10.1002/sim.1591}}&lt;/ref&gt; which suggest that it does indeed affect a test's performance.

Examples where the [[sensitivity (tests)|sensitivity]] and [[specificity (tests)|specificity]] change between different sub-groups of patients may be found with the [[carcinoembryonic antigen]] test&lt;ref name="pmid3510056"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fletcher RH |title=Carcinoembryonic antigen |journal=Ann.

Diagnostic test performances reported by some studies may be artificially overestimated if it is a case-control design where a healthy population ('fittest of the fit') is compared with a population with advanced disease ('sickest of the sick'); that is two extreme populations are compared, rather than typical healthy and diseased populations.&lt;ref&gt;Rutjes AWS, Reitsma JB, Vandenbroucke JP, Glas AS, Bossuyt PMM, Case-control and two-gate designs in diagnostic accuracy studies, Clin Chem 2005;51(8):1335-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

If properly analyzed, recognition of [[Homogeneity (statistics)|heterogeneity]] of subgroups can lead to insights about the test's performance in varying populations.&lt;ref name="pmid12353947" /&gt;

{{cleanup|reason=essay, original research, no definition of statistical stability, no examples, possibly a hoax article|date=September 2018}}
The phenomenon of '''statistical stability''', one of the most surprising physical phenomena, is the weakness of the dependence of [[statistics]] (i.e., functions of the sample) on the sample size, if this size is large.  This effect is typical, for example, for [[relative frequency|relative frequencies]] ([[empirical probability|empirical probabilities]]) of mass events and averages. This phenomenon is widespread and so can be regarded as a fundamental natural phenomenon.

The physical nature of the statistical stability phenomenon is revealed by observing the mass events.

Currently two theories are known that describe this phenomenon. They are the classical [[probability theory]], which has a long history of development, and the theory of hyper-random phenomena, created in recent decades.

== History ==

The first to draw attention to the phenomenon of statistical stability was the cloth merchant [[John Graunt|J.

Information about research on statistical stability is fragmentary for the period from the end of the seventeenth century to the end of the nineteenth century, e.g., by [[Jacob Bernoulli]] (1654–1705), [[Simeon Denis Poisson]] (1781–1840), [[Irenee-Jules Bienayme]] (1796–1878), [[Antoine Augustin Cournot]] (1801–1877), [[Adolphe Quetelet]] (1796–1874), [[John Venn]] (1834–1923), etc.&lt;ref&gt;Scheinin, O.B.: Teoriya Veroyatnostey.

Centre for System Research, Institute of the History of Nature and Technique of the RAS, Moscow (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

Systematic study of statistical stability began at the end of the nineteenth century. In 1879, the German statistician [[Wilhelm Lexis]] (1837–1914) made the first attempt to link the concept of statistical stability of the relative frequency with the dispersion. At the turn of the century and in the early twentieth century, statistical stability was studied by [[Karl Pearson]] (1857–1936), [[Alexander Alexandrovich Chuprov]] (1874–1926), [[Ladislaus Bortkiewicz]] (1868–1931), [[Andrey Markov]] (1856–1922), [[Richard von Mises]] (1883–1953), and others.

A new stage of experimental research began in the late twentieth century. Additional studies became necessary due to the new applied tasks and the detection of a number of phenomena that cannot be satisfactorily explained and described within the framework of the classical probability theory. The new tasks are, in particular, the ultra-precise measurement of physical quantities and ultra-precise forecasting of developments over large intervals of observation. The relatively new phenomena are, for instance, an ''unpredictable'' measurement [[Observational error|progressive (drift) error]],&lt;ref&gt;Sergeev, A.G., Krokhin, V.V.: Metrologiya (Metrology). Logos, Moscow (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elyasberg, P.S.: Izmeritelnaya Informatsiya. Skolko ee Nuzhno? (Measuring Information. How Much Is Needed?). Nauka, Moscow (1983)&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a [[flicker noise]],&lt;ref&gt;Zhigalskiy, G.P.: Nonequilibrium γ noise in conducting films and contacts. Physics–Uspekhy. 46, 449–471 (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; which is detected everywhere and cannot be suppressed by averaging the data.

== Statistical stability of the relative frequencies of events ==

Many well–known scientists led experimental investigations of the statistical stability phenomenon. It is known, for example, that coin-tossing experiments were studied by [[Pierre-Simon Laplace|P.S. de Laplace]] (1749–1827), [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]] (1707–1788), [[Karl Pearson]], Nobel Prize Laureate [[Richard Feynman]] (1918–1988), [[Augustus de Morgan]] (1806–1871), [[William Stanley Jevons]] (1835–1882), [[Vsevolod Ivanovich Romanovsky]] (1879–1954), [[William Feller]] (1906–1970), and others. The trivial–at–first–glance task did not seem trivial for them. 
Table 1 presents some of the results of their experiments.&lt;ref&gt;Gnedenko, B. V.: Kurs Teorii Veroyatnostey (Course on Probability Theory).

Reading, Massachusetts–London (1961)&lt;/ref&gt; of ten runs of the same experiment in which each run consists of 1,000 tosses. The tables demonstrate that, for a large number of tosses, the relative frequency of heads or tails is close to 0.5.

[[File:Table-1tif.tif|thumb|Table 1. Results of coin-tossing experiments carried out by different scientists]]

[[File:Table 2. Results of coin-tossing experiments described in the book (Mosteller et al. 1961).tiff|thumb|Table 2. Results of coin-tossing experiments described in the book ([[Frederick Mosteller|Mosteller]] et al. 1961)]]

Experimental studies of other real physical events show that for a high number of experiments the relative frequencies of events are stabilized; that shows the fundamental nature of the phenomenon of statistical stability.

== Stability of statistics ==

The phenomenon of statistical stability is manifested not only in the stability of the relative frequency of mass events, but also in the stability of the average of the process, or its sample mean. The phenomenon of statistical stability is manifested in the case of averaging of fluctuations that are of different types, in particular, of the stochastic, determinate, and actual physical processes.

''Example 1. '' In Fig. 1a and Fig. 1c the realization of noise with a uniform power spectral density ([[white noise]]) and a determinate period process are presented. In Fig. 1b and Fig. 1d the dependencies of the averages on the averaging interval are shown. As can be seen from Fig. 1b and Fig. 1d, when the averaging interval increases, fluctuations in the sample mean decrease and the average value gradually stabilizes.

[[File:Fig. 1. Realization of white Gaussian noise (a) and harmonic oscillation (c), together with the dependencies of the corresponding sample mean on the average interval (b, d).tiff|thumb|Fig. 1. Realization of white Gaussian noise (a) and harmonic oscillation (c), together with the dependencies of the corresponding sample mean on the averaging interval (b, d)]]

''Example 2. '' Fig. 2a and Fig. 2b show how the mains voltage in a city fluctuates quickly, while the average changes slowly. As the averaging interval increases from zero to one hour, the average voltage stabilizes (Fig. 2 b).

[[File:Fig. 2. Dependence of the mains voltage (a) and the corresponding average (b) on time over 1.8 hours.tiff|thumb|Fig. 2. Dependence of the mains voltage (a) and the corresponding average (b) on time over 1.8 hours]]

The phenomenon of statistical stability is observed in the calculation also other statistics, in particular, sample [[Moment (mathematics)|moments]].

== Properties of statistical stability ==

=== Emergence ===

The statistical stability of the relative frequency is a property of mass (multiple) events. This property is not inherent in a single event, but is inherent in their collection. Similarly, the statistical stability of statistics is a property inherent to the set of samples. Therefore, the statistical stability of relative frequency or statistical stability of statistics can be regarded as an [[Emergence|emergent property]].

=== Hypothesis of perfect statistical stability ===

At first glance, it seems quite plausible that the sequence of relative frequencies &lt;math&gt; p_1(A), p_2(A), \ldots&lt;/math&gt; of any real event &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; should tend to a certain value &lt;math&gt;P(A)&lt;/math&gt; (probability), and the sequence of the sample averages &lt;math&gt;y_1,y_2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt; of discrete samples of any real process should have a limit &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, viz. &lt;math&gt; \lim_{n \to \infty}p_n=P(A) &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; \lim_{n \to \infty} y_n=m &lt;/math&gt;. This is the hypothesis of perfect (ideal) statistical stability. Probability theory is based on this hypothesis.{{dubious|date=November 2018}}

=== Criticism of the hypothesis of perfect statistical stability ===

For many years, the hypothesis of ideal statistical stability was not in doubt, although some scholars (even [[Andrey Kolmogorov]] (1903–1987)
&lt;ref&gt;Kolmogorov, A. N.: Teoriya veroyatnostey (Probability theory). In: Matematika, ee Metody i Znachenie (Mathematics, its Methods and Importance) 2, pp. 252–284 (1956)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Kolmogorov, A. N. Osnovnye Ponyatiya Teorii Veroyatnostey (Fundamentals of Probability Theory). ONTI, Moscow (1974)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Kolmogorov, A. N.: O logicheskikh osnovaniyakh teorii veroyatnostey (about logical foundations of probability theory). In: Teoriya veroyatnostey i matematicheskaya statistika (Probability theory and mathematical statistics), pp. 467–471. Nauka, Moskow (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; and such famous scientists as 
[[Andrey Markov]],&lt;ref&gt;Markov, A. A.: Ischislenie Veroyatnostey (Calculus of Probability). Moscow (1924)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Anatoliy Skorokhod]] (1930–2011),&lt;ref&gt;Ivanenko, V. I., Labkovsky, V. A.: Problema Neopredelennosty v Zadachakh Prinyatiya Resheniya (Uncertainty Problem in the Tasks of Decision Making). Naukova dumka, Kiev (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Émile Borel]] (1871–1956),&lt;ref&gt;Borel, E.: Probabilité et Certitude. Presses Universitaires de France, Paris (1956)&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Тутубалин, Валерий Николаевич|V. N. Tutubalin]] &lt;ref&gt;Tutubalin, V. N.: Teoriya Veroyatnostey (Probability Theory). Moskovskiy universitet, Moscow (1972)&lt;/ref&gt;), and others) noticed that, in the real world, this hypothesis is valid only with certain reservations.

=== The hypothesis of imperfect statistical stability ===

The possibility of adequate description of relative frequencies of actual events and sample averages of actual discrete samples by the expressions &lt;math&gt; \lim_{n \to \infty}p_n=P(A) &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; \lim_{n \to \infty}y_n=m &lt;/math&gt; is only a hypothesis. It does not follow from any experiments and any logical inferences. It is easy to demonstrate that not all processes, even oscillatory type, have the property of perfect statistical stability.

''Example 3. '' In Fig. 3a and Fig. 3c two determinate oscillations are presented and in Fig. 3b and Fig. 3d are shown according to their averages. It is clear from Fig. 3b and Fig. 3d that in both cases, the average does not have a limit, i.e., both processes are statistically unstable.

[[File:Fig. 3. Statistically unstable oscillations (a, c) and corresponding averages (b, d).tif|thumb|Fig. 3. Statistically unstable oscillations (a, c) and corresponding averages (''b'', ''d'')]]

Experimental studies of various processes of different physical nature over broad observation intervals show that the ''hypothesis of perfect statistical stability is not confirmed'''. The real world is continuously changing, and changes occur at all levels, including the statistical level. Statistical assessments formed on the basis of relatively small observation intervals are relatively stable. Their stability is manifested through a decrease in the fluctuation of statistical estimators when the volume of statistical data grows. This creates an illusion of perfect statistical stability. However, beyond a certain critical volume, the level of fluctuations remains practically unchanged (and sometimes even grows) when the amount of the data is increased. This indicates that the statistical stability is not perfect.

''Example 4. '' Non-perfect statistical stability is illustrated Fig. 4
,&lt;ref&gt;Gorban, I.I.: Phenomenon of statistical stability. Technical Physics 59(3), 333–340 (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; which presents mains voltage fluctuations over 2.5 days. Note the fluctuation in Fig. 2a shows beginning part of the fluctuation presented in Fig 4a. As can be seen from Fig. 4b, the sample average does not stabilize, even for very long averaging intervals.

[[File:Fig. 4. Dependence of the mains voltage (a) and the corresponding average (b) on time over 60 hours.tif|thumb|Fig. 4. Dependence of the mains voltage (a) and the corresponding average (b) on time over 60 hours]]

== Description of the phenomenon of statistical stability ==

=== Hilbert’s sixth problem ===

Until the end of the nineteenth century probability theory was regarded as a ''physical discipline''.
At the Second International Congress of mathematicians (1900) [[David Hilbert]] (1862–1943) gave a speech entitled ‘Mathematical problems’.&lt;ref&gt;Aleksandrov, P.S. (ed.): Problemy Hilberta (Hilbert’s Problems). Nauka, Moscow (1969)&lt;/ref&gt; Here he formulated what he considered to be the twenty three most important [[Hilbert's problems|problems]] whose study could significantly stimulate the further development of science. The sixth problem was the mathematical description of the axioms of physics. 
In the part of his presentation relating to this problem, Hilbert noted that, in parallel with research on the foundations of geometry, one could approach the problem of an axiomatic construction, along the same lines, of the ''physical sciences in which mathematics played an exclusive role, and in particular, probability theory'' and mechanics.

Many scientists have responded to Hilbert’s appeal. It was among them [[Richard von Mises]], considered the problem from the standpoint of natural science, and [[Andrey Kolmogorov]], proposed in 1929 the solution based on the set theory and measure theory. The axiomatic approach proposed by A. N. Kolmogorov &lt;ref&gt;Kolmogorov, A. N. Osnovnye Ponyatiya Teorii Veroyatnostey (Fundamentals of Probability Theory). ONTI, Moscow (1974)&lt;/ref&gt;
is now favoured in probability theory. This approach has even been elevated to the rank of a standard.&lt;ref&gt;ISO 3534–1: Statistics. Vocabulary and symbols. Part I: General statistical terms and terms used in probability (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Description of the phenomenon of statistical stability in the framework of the probability theory ===

Kolmogorov’s [[probability theory]] is a typical mathematical discipline. In it, the subject matter is an abstract probability space and the scope of research is the mathematical relationships between its elements. The physical phenomenon of the statistical stability of the relative frequency of events which constitutes the foundation of this discipline formally would not then appear to play any role. This phenomenon is taken into account in an idealized form by accepting the axiom of countable additivity, which is equivalent to acceptance of the hypothesis of perfect statistical stability.

=== Description of the phenomenon of statistical stability in the framework of the theory of hyper-random phenomena ===

In contrast to the classical mathematical probability theory, the [[theory of hyper-random phenomena]] is ''physical-mathematical'' one. Its subject matter is phenomenon of statistical stability and the scope of research is adequate description of it by so-called ''hyper-random models'' (''hyper-random phenomena'') taking into account the violation of statistical stability.&lt;ref&gt;Gorban, I.I.  The Statistical Stability Phenomenon — Springer, 2017. — 361 p. — {{ISBN|978-3-319-43584-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory of hyper-random phenomena does not erase the achievements of probability theory and classical mathematical statistics, but complements them, extending the statements of these disciplines to a sphere in which they had not yet been considered where there is no convergence of statistics.

== Parameters of statistical stability ==
{{expand section|date=March 2017}}

There are a number of parameters characterizing the statistical stability, in particular, the parameters of statistical instability with respect to the average, the parameters of statistical instability with respect to the standard deviation, intervals of statistical stability with respect to the average, standard deviation, and other statistics, and so forth. The mathematically correct determination of these parameters and the development of a methodology for their estimation in case of unlimited and limited sample sizes are studied within the framework of the theory of hyper-random phenomena.

== The areas of effective use of various approaches for description of the statistical stability phenomenon ==

The main parameters defining the bounds of the effective using of classical probability theory and the theory of hyper-random phenomena are intervals of statistical stability with respect to various statistics. Within these intervals the violations of statistical stability are negligible and therefore the use of probability theory is possible and reasonable. Outside these intervals the violations of statistical stability are essential and therefore it is necessary to use the methods that take into account these violations, in particular, the methods of the theory of hyper-random phenomena.

The limitations of statistical stability become apparent for large sample sizes and in the passage to the limit. Sample sizes are often small and therefore many practical tasks can be solved with acceptable accuracy using random (stochastic) models. Such models are usually simpler than the hyper-random models, so ''are preferred'' for not very large sample sizes.
However, the hyper-random models have obvious advantages over the stochastic and other simpler models in cases when the limited statistical character of statistical stability becomes apparent, usually for ''long observation intervals and large sample sizes''.

Therefore, the primary application of the hyper-random models is to statistical analysis of various physical processes (electrical, magnetic, electromagnetic, acoustic, hydroacoustic, seismic-acoustic, meteorological, and others) of long duration, as well as high precision measurements of various physical quantities and the forecasting of physical processes by statistical processing of large data sets.

Twenty first century research shows that hyper-random models can be useful for solving other tasks too, for instance, in designing of radio electronic equipment.&lt;ref&gt;Uvarov, B.M.: Methods for representing the characteristics of radioelectronic equipment on the basis of the hyper-random phenomena theory. Radioelectronics and Communications Systems 53(10), 542–549 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zinkovskiy, Yu.F., Uvarov, B.M.: Hyper-randomness of algorithms for simulation of current radio electronic equipment. Radioelectronics and Communications Systems 54(3), 147–154 (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute''' ({{lang-sv|'''Sveriges meteorologiska och hydrologiska institut'''}}, abbreviated '''SMHI''') is a [[Government agencies in Sweden|Government agency in Sweden]] and operates under the [[Ministry of the Environment (Sweden)|Ministry of the Environment]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smhi.se/en/about-smhi About SMHI]&lt;/ref&gt; SMHI has expertise within the areas of [[meteorology]], [[hydrology]] and [[oceanography]], and has extensive service and business operations within these areas.

Established in 1945, SMHI's head office is located in [[Norrköping]]. Prior to 1975 it was located in [[Stockholm]] but after a decision taken in the [[Riksdag]] in 1971 it was relocated to Norrköping in 1975. SMHI also has offices in [[Gothenburg]], [[Malmö]], [[Sundsvall]] and [[Upplands Väsby]]. 
To the Swedish public SMHI is mostly known for the [[weather forecast]]s in the public-service radio provided by [[Sveriges Radio]]. Many of the other major media companies in Sweden also buy weather forecasts from SMHI.

==Staff and organisation==
SMHI has about 650 employees. The research staff includes some 100 scientists at the Research Unit, where the Rossby Centre is part of. The research division is divided into six units:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smhi.se/en/Research Research on SMHI website]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Meteorological prediction and analysis
* Air quality
* Oceanography
* Hydrology
* Rossby Centre (Regional and Global Climate Modelling)
* Atmospheric Remote Sensing

The regional and global climate modelling is at the Rossby Centre, which was established at SMHI in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smhi.se/en/Research/Research-departments/climate-research-rossby-centre2-552/about-rossby-centre-1.8341 About the Rossby Centre at SMHI website]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Environmental research spans all six research units. There is also a project for providing contributions to the HIRLAM (High Resolution Limited Area Model) project.

The main goal of the research division is to support the Institute and the society with research and development. The scientists participate in many national and international research projects.

==Air quality research==
The air quality research unit of SMHI has 10 scientists, all of whom have expertise in air quality, atmospheric pollution transport, and [[atmospheric pollution dispersion modelling]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smhi.se/sgn0106/if/FoUl/en/staff/staff.html Air quality research staff] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060419135727/http://www.smhi.se/sgn0106/if/FoUl/en/staff/staff.html |date=2006-04-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Battle for God: Fundamentalism in Judaism, Christianity and Islam''''' is a book by best-selling author [[Karen Armstrong]] published in 2000 by [[Alfred A. Knopf|Knopf]]/[[HarperCollins]] which the ''[[New York Times]]'' described as "one of the most penetrating, readable, and prescient accounts to date of the rise of the fundamentalist movements in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/26/books/holy-wars.html|date=Mar 26, 2000|title=Holy Wars|author=Chris Hedges|newspaper=New York Times|accessdate=2010-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Battle for God'' traces the history of the rise of [[fundamentalism]] in the three major [[monotheistic]] faiths. Armstrong's analysis starts with developments in [[Jewish fundamentalism|Judaism]] and traces it through the creation of fundamentalism in [[Fundamentalist Christianity|Christianity]] to adoption of a similar approach to modernity in [[Islamic fundamentalism|Islam]].

==Synopsis==
Armstrong's central case rests on the confusion between ''mythos'' and ''logos'', using these in the technical sense suggested by [[Johannes Slok]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Johannes Slok|title=Devotional Language. Translated by Henrik Mossin.|publisher= Danbury: Walter De Gruyter Incorporated|year= 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Myth concerns "what was thought to be timeless and constant in our existence... Myth was not concerned with practical matters but with meaning".&lt;ref&gt;[[Karen Armstrong]]. ''The Battle for God''; page xiv&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast "Logos was the rational, pragmatic and scientific thought that enabled men and women to function well in the world". In religion, logos appears in legal systems and practical action. By the eighteenth century, "people in Europe and America began to think that ''logos'' was the only means to truth and began to discount ''mythos'' as false and superstitious." Armstrong suggests that fundamentalists have turned their mythos into logos using the mindset of the modern scientific age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianethicstoday.com/Issue/029/The%20Battle%20For%20God%20%20By%20Karen%20Armstrong_029_29_.htm|author=Darrel Morgan|title=The Battle for God|date=Aug 2000|accessdate=2010-02-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805015838/http://www.christianethicstoday.com/Issue/029/The%20Battle%20For%20God%20%20By%20Karen%20Armstrong_029_29_.htm|archivedate=2009-08-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first part of the book, "The Old World and the New", compares the progression of the three monotheistic faiths between 1492, when [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] discovered [[Americas|America]], and 1870, when "The Franco-Prussian War had revealed the hideous effects of modern weaponry, and there was a dawning realisation that science might also have a malignant dimension."&lt;ref&gt;Karen Armstrong. ''The Battle for God''; page 136&lt;/ref&gt; It traces the way Jews and Muslims modernized during this period.

This leads to the modern period described in part two, “Fundamentalism”, when there was a growing adoption of a [[Biblical literalism|literalist]] interpretation of scripture in the United States, which eventually gave rise to ''[[The Fundamentals]]'', a series of 12 volumes refuting modern ideas published shortly before and during the [[World War I]], of which 3 million copies  were distributed to every pastor, professor and theological student across America by the largesse of oil millionaires. Though this led to a distinctive ideology, it was not till the 1980s that it emerged as a political force.

In Judaism, the growth of [[Zionism]] was given its biggest boost by the [[Holocaust]] which led to the establishment of the [[State of Israel]] in 1948. Although many traditional Jews migrated there, the most conservative rejected the secular interpretation of Zionism and it wasn't until the emergence of [[Gush Emunim]] after the [[Yom Kippur War]] in 1974 that fundamentalism emerged in Israel as a political force.

In Islam, fundamentalism did not emerge until modernization had taken hold, first in [[Egypt]] with the creation of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] by [[Hasan al-Banna]]. Armstrong traces the development of [[Sunni]] fundamentalism under [[Sayyid Qutb]] and [[Shia]] fundamentalism under [[Ayatollah Khomeini]].

==Response==
After [[September 11 attacks|9/11]], Karen Armstrong became one of the best selling authors in the US, as people attempted to understand the culture of men capable of carrying out such acts. One reviewer points out that "9-11 holds a fresh irony. While Osama and Co. wouldn't exist without the hegemony of Western secularism to rally against, their most effective attack on the Great Satan has breathed new life into our own fundamentalist tendencies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=C.

An '''urban thermal plume''' describes rising air in the lower altitudes of the Earth's atmosphere caused by urban areas being warmer than surrounding areas. Over the past thirty years there has been increasing interest in what have been called [[urban heat island]] (UHI),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hsu Sheng-I |title=The urban heat island effect : a case study of metropolitan Phoenix area |publisher=Chinese University of Hong Kong |year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is only since 2007 that thought has been given to the rising columns of warm air, or ‘thermal plumes’ that they produce.  We are all familiar with [[Sea breeze|on-shore]] breezes at the seaside on a warm day, and [[Land breeze|off-shore]] breezes at night.  These are caused by the land heating up faster on a sunny day and cooling faster after sunset, respectively.  Our personal experience of on-shore breezes shows us that the thermals, or warm airs, that rise from the land and sea respectively have a sensible effect on the local  [[microscale meteorology]]; and perhaps at times on the [[mesometeorology]].{{Or|date=October 2009}}  Urban thermal plumes have as powerful although less localized an effect.

[[London]] is generally 3 to 9 Celsius hotter than the [[Home counties|Home Counties]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Tony John |last1=Chandler |title=The Climate of London |publisher=Hutchinson |location=London |year=1965 |isbn=0-582-48558-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mike Davies; ''Implications of UHI Issues for Urban Planning: a London Perspective''; Office of the Mayor of London, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  [[London|London’s]] meteorological aberrations were first studied by [[Luke Howard|Luke Howard, FRS]] in the 1810s,&lt;ref&gt;Luke Howard, ''The climate of London, deduced from Meteorological observations, made at different places in the neighbourhood of the metropolis'', 2 vol., London, 1818-20&lt;/ref&gt; but the notion that this large warm area would produce a significant urban thermal plume was not seriously proposed until very recently.

Microscale thermal plumes, whose diameters may be measured in tens of metres, such as those produced by industrial chimney stacks, have been extensively investigated, but largely from the point of view of the plumes dispersal by local micrometeorology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=A. |last1=Belghith |first2=A.

==Climate change==
Decreasing Arctic sea ice cover is one of the most visible manifestations of climate change, often linked to rising global temperatures. However, there are several reports that shrinking polar ice is due more to changes in ambient wind direction than to increasing environmental temperatures ''per se''.&lt;ref name=NASA071001&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2007/oct/HQ_07216_Sea_Ice.html |title=NASA - NASA Examines Arctic Sea Ice Changes Leading to Record Low In 2007 |work=NASA News Release |date=1 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006-07, a team led by Son Nghiem of NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, [[Pasadena, California]], studied trends in Arctic perennial ice cover by combining data from NASA's [[QuikSCAT]] satellite, which can identify and map different classes of sea ice, including older, thicker perennial ice and younger, thinner seasonal ice.  The scientists observed that the Arctic Ocean was dominated by thinner seasonal ice that melts faster. This ice is more easily compressed and responds more quickly to being pushed out of the Arctic by winds. Those thinner seasonal ice conditions facilitated the ice loss, leading to this 2007’s record low amount of total Arctic sea ice.  Nghiem concluded that the rapid decline in winter perennial ice the past two years was caused by unusual wind patterns that compressed the sea ice, loaded it into the [[Transpolar Drift Stream]] and then sped its flow out of the Arctic, where it rapidly melted in the warmer waters at lower latitudes.&lt;ref name=NASA071001/&gt;

It has been severally reported that in a stratified atmosphere cross-stream exchange occurs above the [[Planetary boundary layer]] when there is a vertical motion of significant moment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=T Oke |title=Boundary layer climates |publisher=Methuen |location=London |year=1987 |isbn=0-416-04422-0 |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;   While recognising that the steady lessening of vertical motion towards the edges of urban thermal plumes will have an ameliorating effect, Rail proposed that such urban thermal plumes play a critical part in producing the changes in ambient wind direction over the Arctic and have had a direct impact on Arctic shrink.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Rail (2007); ''op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt;  The impact of urban thermal plumes will vary depending on a large variety of factors including the diameter and temperature gradient of the [[Urban heat island]], the latitude, the thermal stability of the stratiform, the [[Synoptic scale meteorology|synoptic wind]], &amp;c.  Thus, for example, urban thermal plumes will have far greater impact at higher latitudes (above 40°N and above 40°S), where the Earth-atmosphere system undergoes net ''cooling'' by radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=John E |last1=Walsh |title=Global Climate Model Performance over Alaska and Greenland |journal=J.

'''Water splitting''' is the [[chemical reaction]] in which [[water]] is broken down into [[oxygen]] and [[hydrogen]]:
:2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O  →  2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Efficient and economical photochemical water splitting would be a technological breakthrough that could underpin a [[hydrogen economy]].  A version of water splitting occurs in [[photosynthesis]], but hydrogen is not produced. No practical version of water splitting has been demonstrated, but the two component reactions (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production) are well known.  The reverse of water splitting is the basis of the [[hydrogen fuel cell]].

== Electrolysis ==
{{Main article|Electrolysis of water}}
[[File:Electrolyser, front, B.jpg|thumb|Electrolyser front with electrical panel in foreground]]
[[Electrolysis of water]] is the decomposition of [[water]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) into [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[hydrogen]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) due to an [[electricity|electric current]] being passed through the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Hauch, A.; Ebbesen, S. D.; Jensen, S. H.; Mogensen, M.|title=Highly Efficient high temperature electrolysis|journal=J. Mater. Chem.|year=2008|volume=18|pages=2331–2340|doi=10.1039/b718822f}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:[[File:Vion radiant energy US Patent 28793.png|thumb|upright|[[Atmospheric electricity]] utilization for the chemical reaction in which water is separated into oxygen and hydrogen. (Image via: Vion, US patent 28793. June 1860.)]]
* Vion, {{US patent|28793}}, "Improved method of using atmospheric electricity", June 1860.

In [[power to gas]] production schemes, the excess power or off peak power created by wind generators or solar arrays is used for load balancing of the energy grid by storing and later injecting the hydrogen into the natural gas grid.

[[File:Hydrogen-challenger hg.jpg|thumb|''|Electrolysis of water ship [[Hydrogen Challenger]]'']]
Production of hydrogen from water is energy intensive. Potential electrical energy supplies include hydropower, wind turbines, or photovoltaic cells. Usually, the electricity consumed is more valuable than the hydrogen produced so this method has not been widely used. In contrast with low-temperature electrolysis, [[high-temperature electrolysis]] (HTE) of water converts more of the initial [[heat]] energy into chemical energy (hydrogen), potentially doubling [[fuel efficiency|efficiency]] to about 50%. Because some of the energy in HTE is supplied in the form of heat, less of the energy must be converted twice (from heat to electricity, and then to chemical form), and so the process is more efficient.

==Water splitting in photosynthesis ==
A version of water splitting occurs in [[photosynthesis]], but the electrons are shunted, not to protons, but to the electron transport chain in [[photosystem II]].  The electrons are used to convert carbon dioxide into sugars.

When photosystem I gets photo-excited, electron transfer reactions gets initiated, which results in reduction of a series of electron acceptors, eventually reducing NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to NADPH and PS I is oxidized. The oxidized photosystem I captures electrons from photosystem II through a series of steps involving agents like plastoquinone, cytochromes and plastocyanine. The photosystem II then brings about water oxidation resulting in evolution of oxygen, the reaction being catalyzed by CaMn&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; clusters embedded in complex protein environment; the complex is known as oxygen evolving complex (OEC).&lt;ref&gt;Yano, J.; Kern, J.; Sauer, K.; Latimer, M. J.; Pushkar, Y.; Biesiadka, J.; Loll, B.; Saenger, W.; Messinger, J.; Zouni, A.; Yachandra, V. K., Where Water Is Oxidized to Dioxygen: Structure of the Photosynthetic Mn(4)Ca Cluster.

[[File:Algae hydrogen production.jpg|frame|An [[algae bioreactor]] for hydrogen production.]]
In [[Biological hydrogen production (Algae)|biological hydrogen production]], the electrons produced by the photosystem are shunted not to a chemical synthesis apparatus but to [[hydrogenase]]s, resulting in formation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  This biohydrogen is produced in an [[bioreactor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/pdfs/progress08/ii_f_2_melis.pdf DOE 2008 Report 25 %]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Photoelectrochemical water splitting==
{{Main article|photoelectrochemical cell|artificial photosynthesis}}
Using electricity produced by [[photovoltaic]] systems potentially offers the cleanest way to produce hydrogen, other than nuclear, wind, geothermal, and hydroelectric.  Again, water is broken down into hydrogen and oxygen by electrolysis, but the electrical energy is obtained by a [[photoelectrochemical cell]] (PEC) process.  The system is also named [[artificial photosynthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn14441-electrode-lights-the-way-to-artificial-photosynthesis.html Electrode lights the way to artificial photosynthesis]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.technologyreview.com/Energy/21155/?a=f Solar-Power Breakthrough: Researchers have found a cheap and easy way to store the energy made by solar power]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://swegene.com/pechouse-a-proposed-cell-solar-hydrogen.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= del Valle |first= F. |last2= Ishikawa |first2= A. |last3= Domen |first3= K. |date=May 2009|last4= Villoria De La Mano |first4= J.A.|last5= Sánchez-Sánchez|first5= M.C.|last6= González|first6= I.D.|last7= Herreras|first7= S.|last8= Mota|first8= N.|last9= Rivas|first9= M.E. |title= Influence of Zn concentration in the activity of Cd1-xZnxS solid solutions for water splitting under visible light |journal= Catalysis Today |volume= 143 |issue= 1–2 |pages= 51–59 |publisher= |issn= |pmid= |pmc= |doi= 10.1016/j.cattod.2008.09.024 |bibcode= |ref=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Photocatalytic water splitting==
{{Main article|Photocatalytic water splitting}}
The conversion of solar energy to hydrogen by means of water splitting process is one of the most interesting ways to achieve clean and renewable energy. However, if this process is assisted by photocatalysts suspended directly in water rather than a photovoltaic or an electrolytic system, the reaction takes place in one step, it therefore can be more efficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= del Valle |first= F. |date=Jun 2009|last2= Álvarez Galván |first2= M.

==Thermal decomposition of water==
{{Main article|Thermochemical cycle}}
In [[thermolysis]], water molecules split into their atomic components [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]]. For example, at 2200&amp;nbsp;°C about three percent of all H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O are dissociated into various combinations of hydrogen and oxygen atoms, mostly H, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, O, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and OH. Other reaction products like H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; remain minor. At the very high temperature of 3000&amp;nbsp;°C more than half of the water molecules are decomposed, but at ambient temperatures only one molecule in 100 trillion dissociates by the effect of heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Int J Hydrogen Energy |volume=26 |year=2001 |pages=185pp |title=Thermochemical hydrogen production: past and present |doi=10.1016/S0360-3199(00)00062-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The high temperatures and material constraints have limited the applications of this approach.

===Nuclear-thermal===
{{see also|NGNP}}
Some prototype [[Generation IV reactor]]s, such as the [[High-temperature engineering test reactor]], operate at 850 to 1000 [[degrees Celsius]], considerably hotter than existing commercial [[nuclear power]] plants. [[General Atomics]] predicts that hydrogen produced in a High Temperature Gas Cooled Reactor ([[HTGR]]) would cost $1.53/[[kilogram|kg]]. In 2003, steam reforming of natural gas yielded hydrogen at $1.40/kg. At {{As of|2005|alt=2005}} gas prices, hydrogen cost $2.70/kg.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}  Hence, just within the United States, a savings of tens of billions of dollars per year is possible with a nuclear-powered supply. Much of this savings would translate into reduced oil and natural gas imports.

One side benefit of a nuclear reactor that produces both [[electricity]] and hydrogen is that it can shift production between the two. For instance, the plant might produce electricity during the day and hydrogen at night, matching its electrical generation profile to the daily variation in demand. If the hydrogen can be produced economically, this scheme would compete favorably with existing [[grid energy storage]] schemes. What is more, there is sufficient hydrogen demand in the [[United States]] that all daily peak generation could be handled by such plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dis.anl.gov/ceeesa/documents/NuclearHydrogen_ANL0530Final.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927075457/http://www.dis.anl.gov/ceeesa/documents/NuclearHydrogen_ANL0530Final.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hybrid thermoelectric [[Copper-chlorine cycle]] is a [[cogeneration]] system using the [[waste heat]] from nuclear reactors, specifically the [[CANDU reactor|CANDU]] [[supercritical water reactor]].&lt;ref name=Naterer&gt;{{cite journal |last=Naterer |first=G. F. |title=Recent Canadian Advances in Nuclear-Based Hydrogen Production and the Thermochemical Cu-Cl Cycle |journal=International Journal of Hydrogen Energy |volume=34 |issue=7 |pages=2901–2917 |year=2009 |doi=10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.01.090 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solar-thermal===

The high temperatures necessary to split water can be achieved through the use of [[concentrating solar power]].  [[Hydrosol-2]] is a 100-kilowatt pilot plant at the [[Plataforma Solar de Almería]] in [[Spain]] which uses sunlight to obtain the required 800 to 1,200&amp;nbsp;°C to split water. Hydrosol II has been in operation since 2008. The design of this 100-kilowatt pilot plant is based on a modular concept. As a result, it may be possible that this technology could be readily scaled up to megawatt range by multiplying the available reactor units and by connecting the plant to [[heliostat]] fields (fields of sun-tracking mirrors) of a suitable size.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dlr.de/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-1/86_read-14380/&lt;/ref&gt;

Material constraints due to the required high temperatures are reduced by the design of a membrane reactor with simultaneous extraction of hydrogen and oxygen that exploits a defined thermal gradient and the fast diffusion of hydrogen. With concentrated sunlight as heat source and only water in the reaction chamber, the produced gases are very clean with the only possible contaminant being water. A "Solar Water Cracker" with a concentrator of about 100 m² can produce almost one kilogram of hydrogen per sunshine hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://h2powersystems.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The S-I cycle consists of three [[chemical reaction]]s whose net reactant is water and whose net products are [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]]. All other chemicals are recycled. The S-I process requires an efficient source of heat.

More than 352 [[thermochemistry|thermochemical]] cycles have been described for water splitting or [[thermolysis]].,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/pdfs/review06/pd_10_weimer.pdf 353 Thermochemical cycles]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://shgr.unlv.edu/stchNew/source/login.asp UNLV Thermochemical cycle automated scoring database (public)]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; These cycles promise to produce hydrogen  oxygen from water and heat without using electricity.&lt;ref name="Developmentof"&gt;[http://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/pdfs/review05/pd28_weimer.pdf Development of solar-powered thermochemical production of hydrogen from water]&lt;/ref&gt; Since all the input energy for such processes is heat, they can be more efficient than high-temperature electrolysis. This is because the efficiency of electricity production is inherently limited. Thermochemical production of hydrogen using chemical energy from coal or natural gas is generally not considered, because the direct chemical path is more efficient.

For all the thermochemical processes, the summary reaction is that of the decomposition of water:
:&lt;chem&gt; 2H2O &lt;=&gt;[\stackrel{}\ce{Heat}] {2H2} + O2&lt;/chem&gt;
All other reagents are recycled. None of the thermochemical hydrogen production processes have been demonstrated at production levels, although several have been demonstrated in laboratories.

There is also research into the viability of nanoparticles and catalysts to lower the temperature at which water splits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nanoptek.com/ Naoptek]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.treehugger.com/files/2008/07/hydrogen-production-breakthrough-from-mit-a-giant-leap.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently [[Metal-Organic Framework]] (MOF)-based materials have been shown to be a highly promising candidate for water splitting with cheap, first row transition metals.;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Das | display-authors = etal   | year = 2013 | title = | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.201301327/abstract | journal = Angew.

'''West Stow Anglo-Saxon Village''' is an [[archaeological site]] and an [[archaeological open-air museum|open-air museum]] located near to [[West Stow]] in [[Suffolk]], eastern [[England]]. Evidence for intermittent human habitation at the site stretches from the [[Mesolithic]] through the [[Neolithic]], [[Bronze Age]], [[Iron Age]] and [[Roman Britain|Romano-British period]], but it is best known for the small village that existed on the site between the mid-5th century and the early 7th century [[Common Era|CE]], during the early [[Anglo-Saxon]] period. During this time, around 70 sunken-featured buildings were constructed on the site, along with 8 halls and a number of other features. Subsequently abandoned, the area became farmland in the Late Medieval period.

[[Antiquarianism|Antiquarian]] interest in the site began in 1849, when a nearby Anglo-Saxon cemetery was discovered. Subsequent excavations of Romano-British pottery kilns took place in the late 19th and mid-20th centuries, before the Anglo-Saxon settlement was revealed. The site was excavated between 1956 and 1972 by an archaeological team from the [[Ministry of Works (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Public Buildings and Works]] (MOPBW), led first by Vera Evison and then by Stanley West. Following the culmination of excavation, it was decided to reconstruct the village on the site, an [[experimental archaeology|experimental archaeological]] project which has been ongoing since 1974. In 1999, the site was opened to the public with a new visitor's centre, museum and cafe.

==Location==
[[File:West Stow Anglo-Saxon village.jpg|thumb|right|Panorama of the reconstructed village, on the sloping hill, with the 19th century pines in the background.]]
West Stow Anglo-Saxon Village is located on the north bank of the [[River Lark]], adjacent to the village of West Stow in the western part of Suffolk.&lt;ref name="West 2001 i"/&gt; Situated on a small hill {{Convert|15|ft|m}} in height, it would have been noticeably prominent in the surrounding landscape; this hill formed a "core" for a sand dune that developed around from wind-carried sand during the early 14th century and which sharply drops on the leeward side while gradually sloping on the windward side. The steep southern slope is accentuated by a ditch at its base, which marks the edge of the river's [[flood plain]].&lt;ref name="West1985 9"/&gt;

The surrounding landscape as it appears today is radically different from the landscape that would have surrounded the area in the Iron Age and Early Medieval periods.&lt;ref name="West1985 10"&gt;[[#Wes85|West 1985]]. p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; The land to the north and east of the West Stow Anglo-Saxon village has been heavily modified during the construction of the Bury sewage farms, with the north-east corner of the site having been partly destroyed by a gravel pit in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="West1985 9"/&gt; By the mid-1980s, the rubbish dumps that surrounded the site had been converted into a Country Park, with the landscape being regenerated with [[sedge]], grass, birch and oak.&lt;ref name="West1985 9"/&gt; The site of the settlement is also bisected by a row of pine trees that had been planted in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="West1985 10"/&gt;

The solid geology of the Lark Valley is [[chalk]], with patches of [[boulder clay]] that forms a high plateau capped with sands and gravels in West Stow and [[Icklingham]].&lt;ref name="West1985 3"&gt;[[#Wes85|West 1985]]. p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The site is seven miles west from the town of [[Bury St. Edmunds]].&lt;ref name="West 2001 i"&gt;[[#Wes01|West 2001]]. p. i.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prehistoric settlement==
The site at West Stow has shown evidence of human habitation throughout British prehistory. Indeed, the wider Lark Valley contains the greatest known concentration of prehistoric settlements in the region of [[East Anglia]].&lt;ref name="West1985 3"/&gt;

===Mesolithic===
Excavation at West Stow has discovered evidence for [[hunter-gatherer]]s living in the area during the Mesolithic, or "Middle Stone Age" period. Temporarily camping on the knoll, they left behind them five or six dense concentrations of [[Sauveterrian]]-style waste [[Stone tool|lithic]] flakes, blades, cores and other stone implements. Similar scatters of Mesolithic worked flints have been found across the valley area.&lt;ref name="West1985 3-4"&gt;[[#Wes85|West 1985]]. pp. 3&amp;ndash;4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neolithic and Bronze Ages===
Grooved ware and [[Tranchet flake|''petit tranchet''-style]] arrowheads dating from the Neolithic Age have been found in a field adjacent to the West Stow site.&lt;ref name="West1985 4"&gt;[[#Wes85|West 1985]]. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iron Age and Romano-British periods===

==Anglo-Saxon settlement==
During the early Anglo-Saxon period, West Stow was the site of a small village made up of timber buildings. Archaeological excavation of the site unearthed evidence for a variety of different constructions and areas at West Stow: 69 [[Pit-house|sunken-featured buildings]] (SFBs), alongside 7 post-hole buildings interpreted as halls, traces of several lesser structures, a reserve area for clay, 2 large hollows or animal pens, pits, various unassociated post holes and several 7th century boundary ditches.&lt;ref name="West 2001 7"&gt;[[#Wes01|West 2001]]. p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The Anglo-Saxon village showed no signs of the development of property boundaries until the last phase of occupation.&lt;ref name="West 2001 7"/&gt; There was no evidence that the settlement was defended by fortifications.&lt;ref name="West 2001 7"/&gt;

=== Sunken-featured buildings ===
{{Expand section|date=July 2012}}
The majority of structures built at West Stow belonged to a category of what the excavators called "sunken-featured buildings", a term first coined by Professor [[Philip Rahtz]]. In previous decades, buildings in this style had been known as "[[Pit-house|pit houses]]", "sunken houses" or "grubenhauser" (German ''Grubenhäuser''), but site director Stanley West noted that Rahtz's terminology had been adopted because it was "less contentious" and provided "a non-functional description."&lt;ref name="West 2001 7"/&gt;&lt;ref name="West 1985 14"/&gt; Seventy such sunken-featured buildings, or SFBs, were recorded at the site.&lt;ref name="West 1985 14"/&gt;

=== Halls ===
[[File:West Stow Hall Interior.jpg|thumb|right|130px|The interior of the reconstructed Hall, constructed in 2005.]]
The other category of building uncovered at West Stow consisted of seven larger structures held up by wooden posts which left behind [[posthole]]s; the excavators interpreted these as halls.&lt;ref name="West1985 10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="West 2001 7"/&gt; Five of these buildings were located along the central spine of the hill, with the other two being positioned on the north side and south side respectively. All of the buildings were roughly positioned east to west, although the hall on the north slope was instead orientated north-west to south-east.&lt;ref name="West1985 10"/&gt;

Four of the halls are simple, rectangular areas which are defined by their single row of post holes.&lt;ref name="West1985 10"/&gt; Another, Hall No. 2, was more complex than the others, having an internal division and double post-holes along the length.&lt;ref name="West1985 10"/&gt; No. 7 was also different because it was built from a sleeper beam and larger post holes, while Hall No. 5 cannot be clearly defined because it lay in area that had seen multiple features rebuilt on top of it.&lt;ref name="West1985 10"/&gt;

Hall 1 was located on the eastern end of the site, and survived as the most clearly defined of the post-built structures. 26&amp;nbsp;ft (7.9m) in length and 13&amp;nbsp;ft 6in (4.1m) in breadth, there are gaps in the south and east side walls, suggesting the existence of two doorways. No hearth was found, although a patch of burnt sand, 2&amp;nbsp;ft (0.6m) in diameter, was found in the centre of the hall. No objects were found within the building, although four were uncovered from the post-holes: a Roman bronze coin from the era of Emperor [[Valens]], a flat iron strip, a flat palette and a fragment of a pottery spindle-whorl.&lt;ref name="West1985 10"/&gt;

Hall 2, which was probably the largest of the structures, was located on the crest of the hill, surrounded by SFBs. 32&amp;nbsp;ft (9.75m) in length and 14&amp;nbsp;ft (4.27m) in width, there was a partition down the eastern side of the building, creating a chamber 8&amp;nbsp;ft (2.44m) wide. East of the hall's centre was a patch of burnt sand, marking the position of a hearth. The position of the doorway is not entirely clear, although excavators believed that it was most likely on the south side, close to the partitioning wall. Items discovered in Hall 2 included a Roman bronze coin from the era of the Emperor [[Victorinus]], bronze and iron strips, a bone pin, fragments of both glass and a loomweight, as well as a variety of iron objects, including a knife, nail, plate and key.&lt;ref name="West 1985 11"&gt;[[#Wes85|West 1985]]. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:West Stow Hall 1.jpg|thumb|left|The reconstruction of the Hall, constructed in 2005.]]
The incomplete Hall 3, on the same axis as Halls 1 and 2, was akin in shape and size to the former, but much of its south side had been obliterated by the subsequent construction of other buildings on that site. Fifteen items were found in the interior of the Hall, including three bronze Roman objects; a coin from the era of Emperor [[Constantine I]], a ligula and a dolphin brooch, as well as fragments of glass, a spindlewhorl, and a series of iron objects.&lt;ref name="West 1985 11"/&gt; Also on this axis was Hall 4, which was also heavily obscured by later building, but it appeared to cover an area at least 22&amp;nbsp;ft (6.7m) long and 16&amp;nbsp;ft (4.9m) wide. Only three finds were discovered from within it; a Roman bronze coin from the era of Emperor [[Crispus]], a Roman glass fragment and a triangular bone comb.&lt;ref name="West 1985 11"/&gt;

Hall 5 was located on the south-eastern corner of the settlement, on the lowest slope of the hill. Like with several other of the halls, its plan has been obscured by subsequent buildings constructed on the site, although a large number of postholes and three hearths were uncovered; this has led excavators to believe that there had been two halls on that site, one known as 5A and the other as 5B. Finds from the buildings included a number of items made out of bronze, iron and bone.&lt;ref name="West 1985 11-12"&gt;[[#Wes85|West 1985]]. pp. 11&amp;ndash;12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hall 6 was at the far western end of the hill, along as the same east-to-west axis as Halls 1, 2, 3 and 4. At least 25&amp;nbsp;ft (7.6m) long and 12&amp;nbsp;ft (3.7m) wide, the structure was apparently relatively weak in design, and within it was discovered a Roman bronze spoon, and two iron objects, one of which was possibly a small chisel.&lt;ref name="West 1985 12"&gt;[[#Wes85|West 1985]]. p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Hall 7 contained a dark layer of material at the occupation layer, with finds including a variety of stones, bones and sherds, along with much burnt daub, unburnt clay mixed with chalk and a broken Anglo-Saxon pot. It has been interpreted as being 37&amp;nbsp;ft 6in in length and 25&amp;nbsp;ft 9in in diameter, making it the largest of the halls at West Stow. It was subject to various possible interpretations, although represented the most sophisticated building at West Stow, involving a more advanced technique than that shown for many of the other constructions. Artefacts found at the site included a number of Roman bronze coins, and a variety of bronze, iron, glass and bone artefacts.&lt;ref name="West 1985 12-13"&gt;[[#Wes85|West 1985]]. pp. 12&amp;ndash;13.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other features ===
A number of post-built structures were uncovered at the West Stow Anglo-Saxon settlement which were too small to be interpreted as Halls. These postholes tended to be clustered together, suggesting the possibility that they may have been used to repair small structures. No evidence of fencing was found on any of these structures, which were labelled Buildings 8 through to 14 by the excavators.&lt;ref name="West 1985 14"&gt;[[#Wes85|West 1985]]. p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the site, four large areas of grey, disturbed soil were uncovered, three of which were in the eastern side of the settlement. Stratigraphically dated to the Anglo-Saxon period, they all contained a number of small potsherds, with Hollows 1 and 4 also containing a number of bronze and iron objects. The purpose of these Hollows is unknown, although chief excavator Stanley West speculated that they may have represented animal pens which were once surrounded by a form of hurdling or light fencing, traces of which have not survived.&lt;ref name="West 1985 53-54"&gt;[[#Wes85|West 1985]]. pp. 53&amp;ndash;54.&lt;/ref&gt;

79 pits at the site were also dated to the Anglo-Saxon period, with a further 20 possibles also being identified. This latter group included 12 pits forming a separate group, each of which was rectangular in shape, vertically sided, flat bottomed, and containing a buff sand filling. Their purposes remain unknown.&lt;ref name="West 1985 55-57"&gt;[[#Wes85|West 1985]]. pp. 55&amp;ndash;57.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the final phase of settlement at the site, it is evident that several ditches were dug, often containing fragments of [[Ipswich ware]] and other artefacts. Those ditches dug on the village's western sector appeared to have been used to define certain areas of the settlement, while those on the eastern side serve no apparent functional purpose.&lt;ref name="West 1985 54-55"&gt;[[#Wes85|West 1985]]. pp. 54&amp;ndash;55.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern history==

===Excavation: 1849&amp;ndash;1976===
The first excavations to take place in the vicinity of the West Stow village were undertaken in 1849, when an Anglo-Saxon cemetery was accidentally discovered on the nearby heath, and "skeletons and numerous urns" were found.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tym53|Tymms 1853]]. pp. 315&amp;ndash;328.&lt;/ref&gt; Finds discovered at the cemetery would be collected by a number of locals until 1852. These included John Gwilt of Icklingham, Reverend S. Banks of [[Dullingham]] and the Reverend E.R. Benyon of [[Culford]], who at the time was the proprietor of the heath. None of them ever seem to have publicly suggested that there may have been an Anglo-Saxon settlement nearby.&lt;ref name="West1985 9"&gt;[[#Wes85|West 1985]]. p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1879, and then again in the 1890s, a local amateur archaeologist named Henry Prigg of Icklingham identified and excavated several Romano-British pottery kilns on the heat, although no accurate records from this excavation have survived.&lt;ref name="West1985 9"/&gt; In 1940, the archaeologist [[Basil Brown]] (1888&amp;ndash;1977), best known for having excavated the Anglo-Saxon ship burial at [[Sutton Hoo]] in the 1930s, discovered two further Romano-British pottery kilns at the site. He proceeded to excavate them in 1947, and they were sampled for archaeo-magnetic purposes by Dr John Belshé of the Department of Geodosy and Geophysics at the [[University of Cambridge]].&lt;ref name="West1985 9"/&gt;

[[File:Stanley West.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Stone relief depiction of Stanley West holding an archaeological trowel at West Stow.]]
The man responsible for initiating the archaeological investigation of the Anglo-Saxon village was Stanley West, who had first become interested in Anglo-Saxon England when working as an assistant at the [[Ipswich Museum]]. In 1947, he joined the West Stow excavation being run by Brown that unearthed two Romano-British pottery kilns. During this investigation, it became clear to the excavators that there had also been a later Anglo-Saxon settlement on the site, evidenced by the finding of early Anglo-Saxon potsherds in [[rabbit]]-[[burrow]] scrapes over the area and then the discovery of the section of a hut in the site's north-eastern corner. Proceeding to publish his findings on the kilns in 1952, West went on to excavate Anglo-Saxon areas of Ipswich for the MOPBW alongside studying archaeology in an academic capacity at the University of Cambridge. In April 1958, he attended a conference on early Anglo-Saxon pottery in [[Norwich]] that was organised by the [[Council for British Archaeology]]. Here, he met Professor Vera Evison of [[Birkbeck College]], [[London]], and posed the question to her as to why archaeologists had so far focused on the excavation of Anglo-Saxon cemeteries rather than settlements; she replied that the latter were far harder to detect than the former. In response, West informed her about the Anglo-Saxon potsherds that had emerged at West Stow, and intrigued, she soon began excavating at the site for the [[Ministry of Works (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Public Building and Works]] (MOPBW).&lt;ref name="West1985 9"/&gt;&lt;ref name="West 2001 1"&gt;[[#Wes01|West 2001]]. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, inspired by [[Mary Leakey]]'s discoveries in [[Olduvai Gorge]], West traveled to Eastern Africa to excavate at the [[Tanganyika]]n city of [[Dar Es Salaam]], only returning to England five years later, in 1965. Here, Evison and John Hurst, Inspector of the MOPBW asked him to take charge of the West Stow excavation, which he agreed to. Over the next 7 years he opened up an area of approximately ¾ of an [[acre]] each season. Funded by the MOPBW, West hoped to excavate as much of the site as possible, but ultimately, the excavation remained restrained to the settlement site, not exploring the surrounding field systems, an idea proposed by Dr. Van Es, Head of the Dutch Archaeological Service.&lt;ref name="West1985 9"/&gt;&lt;ref name="West 2001 1"/&gt; The excavation was undertaken by a team of site supervisors and six builders' labourers, aided by roughly 30 volunteers drawn from both universities and the local area.&lt;ref name="West 2001 3"&gt;[[#Wes01|West 2001]]. p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The top stratigraphic layer on the site, a sediment of blown sand known as Layer 1, was removed by [[backhoe]], exposing the old ground surface (Layer 2) beneath it. Evidence of late medieval ridge-and-furrow ploughing was found in this layer, and dated through the discovery of 13th century pottery. Layer 2 consisted largely of a very dark soil that was removed primarily by backhoe. Below this was revealed the layers in which the Anglo-Saxon village had been constructed.&lt;ref name="West 2001 2"&gt;[[#Wes01|West 2001]]. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of the final season, the excavators at West Stow made use of the pioneering system of retrieving seeds and plant remains by [[flotation (archaeology)|flotation]], which had just been developed by archaeologists at the University of Cambridge.&lt;ref name="West 2001 2-3"&gt;[[#Wes01|West 2001]]. pp. 2&amp;ndash;3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The St Edmundsbury District Council planned to turn the area into a rubbish dump servicing the city of [[Bury St. Edmunds]] following the culmination of excavation, a decision that was reviewed annually.&lt;ref name="West 2001 1"/&gt; Eventually they decided against this decision, forming the West Stow Saxon Village Trust, an [[experimental archaeology|experimental archaeological]] group, in order to reconstruct some of the Anglo-Saxon buildings in the hope of learning more about Anglo-Saxon building techniques and architecture. The work was undertaken by a group of [[undergraduate]] students from Cambridge University who called themselves the West Stow Environmental Archaeology Group.&lt;ref name="West1985 9"/&gt; These experimental reconstructions ensured that they only made use of woodworking techniques and technologies that would have been available in Anglo-Saxon England.&lt;ref name="West 2001 77"/&gt;

One of the halls excavated at West Stow also provided the basis for a reconstruction erected at the Bishops Wood Environmental Centre near [[Stourport-on-Severn]] in [[Worcestershire]]; known as "Saxon Hall", it took four years to build, and was used to teach local schoolchildren about life in the Early Medieval. It burned down in 2008 when an ember from a cooking fire set the building alight; John Rhymer, Head of Bishops Wood Centre, told press that he and his team were "devastated". However, the Hall was rebuilt over the following two years at a cost of £34,000. At its official reopening on 21 January 2011, the Anglo-Saxonist [[Stephen Pollington]] gave a speech in [[Old English]] while a historical reenactor, Paul Mortimer, appeared in character as [[Raedwald]], King of East Anglia. Other attendees included Terry Herbert, who had discovered the [[Staffordshire Hoard]] in 2009, members of the [[Kidderminster|Kidderminster Art Society]] and children on a [[school trip]] from [[North Leigh|Northleigh Manor School]] in [[Oxfordshire]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#BBC10|BBC News 2010]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wor10|Worcestershire County Council 2010]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mei11|Meierhans 2011]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The fan-made short film ''[[Born of Hope]]'' (2009), a prequel to the [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]-based inspired movie trilogy ''[[The Lord of the Rings]],'' was largely filmed in West Stow Anglo-Saxon Village.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}
