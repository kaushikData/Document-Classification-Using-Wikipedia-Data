On December 2, 1980, four Catholic missionaries from the United States working in [[El Salvador]] were raped and murdered by five members of the [[National Guard (El Salvador)|El Salvador National Guard]]. They were [[Maryknoll Sister]]s [[Maura Clarke]] and [[Ita Ford]], [[Ursulines|Ursuline]] [[Dorothy Kazel]], and [[Catholic laity|lay]] missionary [[Jean Donovan]].

==Historical background==
The [[Salvadoran Civil War]] began after a 1979 military coup brought the [[Revolutionary Government Junta of El Salvador|Revolutionary Government Junta]] to power. Catholic activists protested against the junta's oppression of impoverished citizens.  [[Óscar Romero]], the [[Archbishop of San Salvador]], was assassinated on March 24, 1980, while performing Mass. The four murdered Americans were involved in an international humanitarian aid mission which was suspected by the régime of fomenting political opposition.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==Murders==
Kazel and Donovan, who were based in [[La Libertad, La Libertad|La Libertad]], drove to [[El Salvador International Airport]] on the afternoon of December 2 to pick up two Maryknoll Sisters returning from a Maryknoll conference in [[Managua]], [[Nicaragua]]. Kazel and Donovan were under surveillance by a National Guardsman at the time, who phoned his commander.  Acting on orders from the commander, five National Guardsmen changed out of uniform and continued to stake out the airport. Donovan and Kazel returned to pick up Clarke and Ford, who were returning from the same conference, on a flight due at 7:00 pm, which landed at  9:11 pm.&lt;ref name="Noone"&gt;Judith Noone, ''The Same Fate as the Poor'', Orbis Books (1995) pp. 1-2. ({{ISBN|1570750319}})&lt;/ref&gt;   The five Guardsmen stopped the four women's vehicle after they left the airport. They were taken to a relatively isolated spot where they were beaten, raped and murdered by the soldiers.&lt;ref name="Noone"/&gt;

Peasants living nearby had seen the women's white van drive to an isolated spot at about 10 p.m. on December 2 and then heard [[machine gun]] fire followed by single shots, three hours after the flight was due. They saw five men flee the scene in the white van, with the lights on and the radio blaring. The van would be found later that night on fire at the side of the airport road. Later, their bodies were found knifed in a ditch.&lt;ref name="Noone"/&gt;

Early the next morning, December 3, they found the bodies of the four women and were told by local authorities — a judge, three members of the National Guard, and two commanders — to bury them in a common grave in a nearby field. The peasants did so, but informed their [[parish priest]] and the news reached Óscar Romero's successor [[Arturo Rivera y Damas]] and the [[United States Ambassador to El Salvador]], [[Robert White (ambassador)|Robert White]].&lt;ref name="Noone"/&gt;

Their shallow grave was exhumed the next day, December 4, in front of 15 reporters, Sisters Alexander and Dorsey and several missioners, and Ambassador White. Donovan's body was the first exhumed; then Kazel's; then Clarke's; and last, that of Ita Ford. On December 5, a Mass of the Resurrection was said by Bishop [[Arturo Rivera y Damas]]; and on December 6, the bodies of Jean Donovan and Dorothy Kazel were flown out for burial. Donovan's body was returned to her parents in [[Sarasota, Florida]], while Kazel's was taken back to her hometown of Cleveland, where she was buried in All Souls Cemetery in [[Chardon, Ohio]]. The bodies of the Maryknoll sisters, Clarke and Ford, were buried in [[Chalatenango, Chalatenango|Chalatenango, El Salvador]],&lt;ref name="Noone"/&gt; in keeping with Maryknoll practice.

==Subsequent history==
As news of the murders was made public in the United States, public outrage forced the U.S. government to pressure the [[Salvadoran]] regime to investigate. U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]] suspended aid to El Salvador, but he later reinstated it. The earliest investigations were condemned as whitewash attempts by the later ones, and in time, a [[Commission on the Truth for El Salvador]] was appointed by the [[United Nations]] to investigate who gave the orders, who knew about it, and who covered it up. Several low-level guardsman were convicted, and two generals were [[Lawsuit|sued]] by the women's families in the [[United States federal courts|U.S. federal courts]] for their [[command responsibility]] for the incident.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Unlike President Carter, succeeding U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] favored the Salvadoran military regime; he authorized increased military aid and sent more U.S. [[military adviser]]s to the country to aid the government in quelling the civil/guerrilla war. In ''El Salvador's Decade of Terror: Human Rights Since the Assassination of Archbishop Romero'', [[Human Rights Watch]] reports:
{{quote|During the Reagan years in particular, not only did the United States fail to press for improvements … but, in an effort to maintain backing for U.S. policy, it misrepresented the record of the Salvadoran government, and smeared critics who challenged that record. In so doing, the Administration needlessly polarized the debate in the United States, and did a grave injustice to the thousands of civilian victims of government terror in El Salvador. [23] Despite the [[El Mozote Massacre]] that year, Reagan continued certifying (per the 1974 amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act) that the Salvadoran government was progressing in respecting and guaranteeing the human rights of its people, and in reducing National Guard abuses against them.}}

In 1984, four national guardsmen—Daniel Canales Ramirez, Carlos Joaquin Contreras Palacios, Francisco Orlando Contreras Recinos and Jose Roberto Moreno Canjura—were convicted of murdering the four women and were sentenced to 30 years in prison.&lt;ref name=casaguards&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/03/world/4-salvadorans-say-they-killed-us-nuns-on-orders-of-military.html?pagewanted=1|title=4 Salvadorans Say They Killed U.S. Nuns on Orders of Military|author=Larry Rother|work=New York Times|page=1|date=April 3, 1998|accessdate=June 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their superior, sub-sergeant Luis Antonio Colindres Aleman, was also convicted for the murders.&lt;ref name=casaguards/&gt;

According to the [[Maryknoll]] Sisters: &lt;blockquote&gt;The &lt;nowiki&gt;[1993]&lt;/nowiki&gt; U.N.-sponsored &lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090604104517/http://www.usip.org/library/tc/doc/reports/el_salvador/tc_es_03151993_intro.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Report of the '''Commission on the Truth for El Salvador''' concluded that the abductions were planned in advance and the men responsible had carried out the murders on orders from above. It further stated that the head of the National Guard and two officers assigned to investigate the case had concealed the facts to harm the judicial process. The murder of the women, along with attempts by the Salvadoran military and some American officials to cover it up, generated a grass-roots opposition in the U.S., as well as ignited intense debate over the Administration’s policy in El Salvador.
In 1984, the defendants were found guilty and sentenced to 30 years in prison. The Truth Commission noted that this was the first time in Salvadoran history that a judge had found a member of the military guilty of assassination. In 1998, three of the soldiers were released for good behavior. Two of the men remain in prison and have petitioned the Salvadoran government for pardons.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.maryknoll.org/MARYKNOLL/SISTERS/ms_marty4ani.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The head of the National Guard, General [[Carlos Eugenio Vides Casanova]], went on to become Salvadoran Minister of Defense in the government of [[José Napoleón Duarte]].&lt;ref name="IRTF"&gt;[http://www.irtfcleveland.org/Churchwomen_Biographies.htm Biography] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705140539/http://www.irtfcleveland.org/Churchwomen_Biographies.htm |date=July 5, 2008 }} InterReligious Task Force of Cleveland; accessed October 7, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, the four assassins confessed to abducting, raping and murdering the four churchwomen and claimed that they did so because Aleman had informed them that they had to act on orders from high-level military officers.&lt;ref name=casaguards /&gt; Some were then released from prison after detailing how Vides and his cousin Col.

Ita Ford's brother, attorney [[William P. Ford]], spent more than 25 years using the U.S. court system to try to obtain justice for his sister and the other three murdered women.  He worked closely with [[Human Rights First]] (formerly the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights) on federal lawsuits to try to bring Salvadoran generals to answer for the murder of the women, and, in other cases, for the torture and murder of members of the Salvadoran poor.&lt;ref name="HRF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/about_us/award_dinners/2003_dinner/bios_speakers.htm |title=Human Rights First 25th Anniversary: Bios |accessdate=2016-02-27 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629145037/http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/about_us/award_dinners/2003_dinner/bios_speakers.htm |archivedate=2007-06-29 |df= }} biography of [[William P.

The case is styled ''Ford v. Garcia''. The defense won the case. On 24 February 2012, however, a Federal immigration judge cleared the way for the deportation of Vides Casanova after the General was held liable for various [[war crime]]s which occurred under his command.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/24/us/salvadoran-may-be-deported-from-us-for-80-murders-of-americans.html?src=recg |work=The New York Times |first=Julia |last=Preston |title=Salvadoran May Be Deported From U.S. for '80 Murders of Americans |date=February 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 11, 2015, the [[Board of Immigration Appeals]] dismissed General Vides Casanova's appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Board of Immigration Appeals |title=Matter of Carlos Eugenio VIDES CASANOVA, Respondent |url=http://www.justice.gov/eoir/vll/intdec/vol26/3827.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=Executive Office for Immigration Review |accessdate=11 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150312015447/http://www.justice.gov/eoir/vll/intdec/vol26/3827.pdf |archivedate=12 March 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/13/us/general-in-el-salvador-torture-and-killings-can-be-deported-immigration-court-rules.html |work=The New York Times |first=Julia |last=Preston |title=General in El Salvador Killings in ’80s Can Be Deported, Court Rules |date=March 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vides Casanova was then deported back to El Salvador on April 8, 2015.&lt;ref name=videsdeported/&gt;

==Cultural depictions==
''Roses in December'' is a 1982 documentary the murders, focusing on Jean Donovan.&lt;ref name="AFSC"&gt;[http://www.afsc.org/newengland/bigcat/ttl.php?FID=229 "Roses in December" details] at [[American Friends Service Committee]] lending library; accessed online December 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; This documentary won the Interfilm Award at the 1982 [[International Filmfestival Mannheim-Heidelberg]].

The dramatization ''[[Choices of the Heart]]'' won the 1984 [[Humanitas Prize]] in the 90-minute [[television movie]] category, although it was criticized for lacking clarity about the political context of the women's killings. Clarke, Ford, Kazel and Donovan were played by [[Mary McCusker]], [[Mari Gorman]], [[Pamela Bellwood]], and [[Melissa Gilbert]] respectively. [[Helen Hunt]], [[Martin Sheen]], and [[Mike Farrell]] co-starred.

The murders were also depicted in ''[[Salvador (film)|Salvador]]'', [[Oliver Stone]]'s 1986 film about an American reporter trying to cover the overall conflict. In this film, actress [[Cynthia Gibb]] portrayed Cathy Moore, a character based on Jean Donovan. Moore is shown in several scenes interacting with the main character.

''Points of Arrival: a Jean Donovan journey'' is a 1996 play written by Paul Amandes, developed by and starring Lisa Wagner and her Still Point Theater Collective, supported by [[Call to Action]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archive.thetablet.co.uk/article/16th-november-1996/11/a-love-story|title=Notebook; A Love Story|date=16 November 1996|work=The Tablet|page=11|accessdate=29 February 2016}}; {{cite news|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1998-10-23/features/1998296001_1_donovan-lisa-wagner-el-salvador|title=Making a case for standing up to oppression Review: At Theatre Project, 'Points of Arrival' argues in unconventional -- and not always successful -- ways for goodness and enduring faith|last=Rousuck|first=J.

{{Campaignbox Basque conflict}}The '''Sabadell attack''' was a [[car bomb]]ing carried out by the armed [[Basque nationalism|Basque]] separatist group [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] in [[Sabadell]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]] on 8 December 1990.

The target was a convoy carrying eight members of the [[National Police Corps|National Police]] force on the way to police a [[Association football|football]] game between [[CE Sabadell FC|Sabadell]] and [[Málaga CF]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://elpais.com/diario/2005/12/09/catalunya/1134094046_850215.html Sabadell recuerda a los seis policías que murieron en un atentado terrorista en 1990], El Pais, 9 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Six of the police officers were killed, with the other two injured. Several civilians were also injured in the attack, which was ETA's deadliest of 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elpais.com/especial/eta/victimas.html Listado de asesinados por ETA facilitado por la Fundación Víctimas del Terrorismo] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512035345/http://www.elpais.com/especial/eta/victimas.html |date=May 12, 2012 }}, El Pais, accessed 3 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In the early 1990s, ETA had stepped up its attacks in Catalonia in an attempt to gain worldwide publicity and secure political concessions by threatening disruption to the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in [[Barcelona]].&lt;ref&gt;Securing and Sustaining the Olympic City, Pete Fussey, Ashgate Publishing, 2011, p48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vj5-Srq3ki4C&amp;pg=PA189&amp;lpg=PA189&amp;dq=eta+barcelona+olympics&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6PEUfxUrE3&amp;sig=Rn9K2mhZ1BWJqoz6xXBOR2rzSSU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=NPMyUdWeIMKF4gSv5YHIDw&amp;ved=0CGEQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=eta&amp;f=false Historical Dictionary of Modern Olympic Movement], John E. Findling &amp; Kimberly D. Pelle, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1996, p189&lt;/ref&gt; Police had obtained documents revealing these plans in the week before the attack.&lt;ref name="EP"&gt;[http://elpais.com/diario/1990/12/09/espana/660697212_850215.html Seis policías muertos y varios heridos en Sabadell en un atentado de ETA con coche bomba], El Pais, 9 December 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

Two weeks earlier, on 23 November, ETA had attacked the [[Guardia Civil]] barracks in [[Sant Carles de la Ràpita]] in Catalonia,&lt;ref&gt;[http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1990/11/24/pagina-1/33459564/pdf.html La Vanguardia], 24 November 1990, p1&lt;/ref&gt; though no one had been injured.

==The attack==
At approximately 1345 on the day of the attack, ETA placed the car bomb on the junction of Josep Aparici and Ribot i Serra streets, where vehicles would normally have to slow down to pass.&lt;ref name="LV1"&gt;[http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1990/12/09/pagina-15/33466996/pdf.html La Vanguardia], 9 December 1990, p15&lt;/ref&gt; The car bomb, located some 500 metres from the main police station, was detonated remotely from the nearby Gran Via,&lt;ref name="LV1"/&gt; the main thoroughfare in the town, from which there was easy access to the [[Autovía A-7|A7 motorway]], allowing the perpetrators to escape. The bomb caused a large explosion, mostly destroying the second of the two vehicles of the police convoy and caused extensive damage to nearby buildings, with shrapnel found up to 400 metres away.&lt;ref name="EP"/&gt; Five of the eight police officers in that vehicle were killed instantly, with a sixth dying shortly afterwards. The other two policemen were seriously injured. A further eight passersby also sustained injuries in the attack.&lt;ref name="EP"/&gt;

==Participants==
Police sources attributed the attack to ETA's Barcelona Commando Unit. They immediately identified Joan Carles Monteagudo and Juan Félix Erezuma, the two suspected leaders of the cell, as participants in the attack.&lt;ref name="EP"/&gt; On 30 May 1991, the day after a [[1991 Vic bombing|bomb attack in Vic]] had killed nine people, Monteagudo and Erezuma were killed in a gunfight with police in [[Lliçà d'Amunt]], near Barcelona.&lt;ref&gt;[http://elpais.com/diario/1991/05/31/espana/675640823_850215.html Los dos jefes del 'comando Barcelona' mueren en un tiroteo un día después del atentado de Vic], El Pais, 31 May 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''2007 [[Osama bin Laden]] video''' originally appeared in a [[Web banner|banner ad]] on an Islamic militant website regularly used by [[al-Qaeda]] on September 6, 2007. The ad carried a picture of bin Laden and the logo of al-Qaeda's media production company [[As-Sahab]]. An accompanying translated message read: "Soon, with the permission of God, a new visual tape, the Sheikh, the Lion, Osama bin Laden. May God protect him."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Ross |first=Brian |title=Al Qaeda Announces New Bin Laden Video |url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/theblotter/2007/09/al-qaeda-announ.html |accessdate=September 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The timing of the video's release coincided with the 6th anniversary of the [[September 11 attacks]] on the United States. bin Laden's [[2004 Osama bin Laden video|previous appearance]] in a video was in 2004.

By September 7, 2007, United States authorities had obtained a copy of the video, even though it hadn't been officially released.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=US studies Bin Laden video, CIA warns of Al-Qaeda plots |url=http://archives.californiaaviation.org/airport/msg42227.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, the [[Reuters]] [[news agency]] released a 1-minute excerpt of the tape, which it had obtained from [[BNO News]].

==Contents==
''Note: The following description was compiled after consideration of the video and transcript as hosted by [http://counterterrorismblog.org/2007/09/obl_transcript.php#025752 The Counterterrorism Blog]''

In the video, [[Osama bin Laden|bin Laden]] is seated at a table wearing a white robe, turban, and beige cloak. His beard is shorter than in his [[2004 Osama bin Laden video|2004 video]] and it's black, leading some to speculate that it had been dyed. The video's title "The Solution" appears in the top left corner of the video frame. The video running time is approximately 26&amp;nbsp;minutes.

Bin Laden addresses the "People of America" directly in the video, but he makes no direct threats to the United States. He criticizes perceived flaws in American society and US foreign policy, contrasting these with the perceived virtues of Islam. The [[September 11 attacks]] are mentioned several times, as is the [[Iraq War]]. The video concludes with a suggestion that Americans should convert to Islam.

Other events and themes in the video include:

* The 62nd anniversary of the US [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]
* The influence of the [[110th United States Congress|Democratically-controlled congress]]
* The influence of [[multinational corporations|major corporations]]
* [[Global warming]] and the [[Kyoto Accord]]
* The [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|war in Afghanistan]]
* The [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union]]
* The [[Kennedy Assassination]]
* The [[Vietnam war]]
* The extermination of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American Indians]]
* The [[Spanish Inquisition]]
* The Capitalist / Communist governments who "take their people for fools"

Individuals mentioned in the video include:

* Former UK Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]]
* Former UK Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]]
* Former French President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]]
* Author and political activist [[Noam Chomsky]]
* Author and former CIA analyst [[Michael Scheuer]]

He suggests that the viewer read ''the European thinker who anticipated the fall of the Soviet Union''. Although not named, Bin Laden is believed to be referring to [[Emmanuel Todd]] and his book ''[[After the Empire: The Breakdown of the American Order]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Weinberger |first=Sharon |title=Osama's Book Club: Michael Scheuer, Emmanuel Todd|url=http://blog.wired.com/defense/2007/09/osamas-reading-.html|accessdate=September 19, 2007 |work=Wired |date=September 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=22e_1190554540  – Michael Scheuer We Shouldn't Be The Sole Supporter Of Israel][[Liveleak]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZNfuIvtLos YouTube – Michael Scheuer Mentioned in Bin Laden Tape FOX News]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aqm4XVylLLc YouTube – Michael Scheuer on the Sept 2007 bin laden message]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTtoHx-ia8A YouTube – Michael Scheuer on "Inside 9/11"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bin Laden suggests that notice should be taken of comments made by a US soldier serving in Iraq named Joshua:

: ''It would benefit you to listen to the poignant messages of your soldiers in Iraq, who are paying – with their blood, nerves and scattered limbs....Among them is the eloquent message of Joshua which he sent by way of the media, in which he wipes the tears from his eyes and describes American politicians in harsh terms and invites them to join him there for a few days''.

The soldier's comments were made in an [[ABC News]] story dated July 16, 2007, and although Bin Laden attributes the remarks to Corporal Joshua Lake who appears in the story.&lt;ref&gt;ABC News [http://abcnews.go.com/images/Politics/transcript2.pdf transcript of video.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Questions concerning authenticity==
Several peculiarities in the video raise questions regarding its authenticity:

* Osama bin Laden sports the trimmer, blacker beard and the same clothing he wore in the October 2004 video.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Krawetz |first=Neal |title=Secure Computing: Sec-C |url=http://www.hackerfactor.com/blog/ |accessdate=September 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com/8301-10784_3-9777136-7.html Researcher: Bin Laden's beard is real, video is not | Tech news blog – CNET News.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
* All references to current events, such as the 62nd anniversary of the US atomic bombing of Japan, and Sarkozy and Brown being the leaders of France and the UK, respectively, occur when the video is frozen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Maschke |first=George |title=Latest Bin Laden Video Is a Forgery: All References to Current Events Are Made During Video Freeze |url=http://www.boomantribune.com/?op=displaystory;sid=2007/9/9/61032/95401 |accessdate=September 12, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070912013154/http://www.boomantribune.com/?op=displaystory%3Bsid%3D2007%2F9%2F9%2F61032%2F95401 |archive-date=September 12, 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction to the video==
President [[George W. Bush]] speaking from the [[APEC Australia 2007|APEC Summit]] in Sydney, Australia:

: ''The tape is a reminder of the dangerous world in which we live and it is a reminder that we must work together to protect our people''.

: In the same speech:

: ''I found it interesting that on the tape Iraq was mentioned, which is a reminder that Iraq is part of the war against extremists. If Al-Qaeda bothers to mention Iraq, it's because they want to achieve their objectives in Iraq, which is to drive us out''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Wolfson |first=Paula |title=Bush Reacts to Bin Laden Video |url=http://www.voanews.com/english/2007-09-08-voa2.cfm |accessdate=September 12, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070909135703/http://www.voanews.com/english/2007-09-08-voa2.cfm |archive-date=September 9, 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homeland Security Advisor [[Frances Townsend]] speaking to [[Fox News Sunday]]:

: ''Remember, the last audiotape was in June of '06. The last video was just before the election in October of '04. This is about the best he can do. This is a man on the run, from a cave, who is virtually impotent other than these tapes''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Transcript: Fran Townsend on 'FOX News Sunday' |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,296202,00.html | work=Fox News | date=September 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Expert on Islamic issues Sliman Abu Rahman (based in [[Amman]], Jordan) speaking to [[Al Jazeera]]:

: ''In his earlier speeches he offered them a truce and now he is asking them to convert. I think this is very far from reality and no political organizing with realistic political objectives can have such an unacceptable political discourse''.&lt;ref&gt;''Al Jazeera'' coverage, September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Former CIA analyst [[Michael Scheuer]] speaking to [[Wolf Blitzer]], anchor of [[CNN]]'s [[The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer|''The Situation Room'']]:

: ''Inherent in his request for us to convert (to Islam) is a very explicit threat that he is going to attack us in a very hard way. The prophet told Muslims before you attack anyone you warn them, offer them a chance to convert and offer them truces''.&lt;ref&gt;CNN: ''The Situation Room'', September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scheuer also provided a more detailed analysis at the [[Jamestown Foundation]] site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&amp;tx_ttnews%5Bswords%5D=8fd5893941d69d0be3f378576261ae3e&amp;tx_ttnews%5Bany_of_the_words%5D=scheuer&amp;tx_ttnews%5Bpointer%5D=2&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=4395&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=7&amp;cHash=99a6c12a28 The Jamestown Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt;

Security analyst M.J. Gohel of the Asia-Pacific Foundation speaking to the ''[[Washington Post]]'':

: ''This has the language and hallmarks of [[Adam Gadahn]] and is very reminiscent of his own messages in terms of style and content''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Whitlock |first=Craig |title=Converts To Islam Move Up In Cells|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/14/AR2007091402265.html?hpid=topnews |accessdate=September 15, 2007 | work=The Washington Post | date=September 15, 2007}}{{fails verification|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second video==
{{Main|September 11, 2007 Osama bin Laden video}}
On September 11, 2007, a second video appeared, purportedly featuring a eulogy by Osama bin Laden for 9/11 hijacker [[Waleed al-Shehri]]. In the video, a voice identified as bin Laden's delivers a 14-minute introduction. The voice is heard over a still picture of bin Laden, dressed and groomed as he appears in the September 7, 2007 video. The 33-minute balance of the recording is a video will read by al-Shehri.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Nasr |first=Octavia |title= New bin Laden video surfaces |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/meast/09/11/binladen.video/index.html |accessdate=September 12, 2007 | work=CNN | date=September 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abby Leach''' (1855–1918) was a Professor of Greek and Latin at [[Vassar College]] in [[Poughkeepsie, New York]] from 1883 until her death.

She was one of the first female students at [[Harvard University]], enrolling in a "Plan for Private Collegiate Instruction of Women" upon its establishment in 1879 at her behest. The "Plan" led to the later establishment of [[Radcliffe College]]. Because Harvard at that time did not grant degrees to women, Vassar College granted her bachelor's and master's degrees after they appointed her to the Vassar faculty.&lt;ref name="Briggs"&gt;{{cite book |last=Briggs |first=Ward|title= Abby Leach (1855-1918)|date=|publisher= The Classical World, Vol. 90, No. 2/3 (Nov 1996 – Feb 1997), Six Women Classicists, pp. 97–105 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was a member of the Greek Conference of the [[Committee of Ten]] called by the [[National Education Association]] in 1894, the only female member of any conference of the Committee of Ten.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Report of the Committee of Ten on Secondary School Studies: With the Reports of the Conferences Arranged by the Committee|author=National Education Association of the United States.

In 1899, she became the first female [[List of Presidents of the American Philological Association|president of the American Philological Association]].&lt;ref name="Briggs"/&gt; From 1899 to 1901, Leach was president of the [[Association of Collegiate Alumnae]] which later became the [[American Association of University Women]].

'''Abel Hendy Jones Greenidge''' (22 December 1865 &amp;nbsp;– 11 March 1906) was a writer on ancient history and law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB12|wstitle=Greenidge, Abel Hendy Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family background==
Greenidge was born on 22 December 1865 at Belle Farm Estate, [[Barbados]], the second son of the Rev. Nathaniel Heath Greenidge, vicar of Boscobel Parish, [[Saint Peter, Barbados|St Peter]] and his wife Elizabeth Cragg Kellman. His father was for many years a headmaster of various schools (Parry School, St Michael’s Parochial School and Christ Church Foundation School) and enjoyed a high reputation as a teacher. 

His brother, Samuel Wilberforce, won a Barbados Scholarship in 1882 and went up to [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John’s College]], [[Cambridge]], was 25th [[Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|wrangler]] in the [[Cambridge mathematical tripos]] of 1886 and the following year attained second-class honours in the Law [[Tripos]]. He was McMahon Law Student in 1888 and called to the [[Bar (law)|Bar]] at [[Gray’s Inn]] in 1889 but died in 1890. 

The Greenidge family trace their ancestry in Barbados to John of [[Greenwich]], who left London on 2 May 1635 on the ship ''Alexander''. Within one generation the [[etymon]], meaning ''Green Port'' or ''Trading Place'' (cf [[Norwich]], [[Harwich]] and [[Ipswich]] in [[England]]) of the surname had assumed the distinctly West Indian [[orthography|orthographic]] format of Greenidge, while maintaining a very similar [[phenomic]] identity.

==Life==
Abel Hendy Jones was educated at [[Harrison College (Barbados)|Harrison College]], Barbados, winning in 1884 the Barbados Scholarship (first established when Abel and his brother Samuel were at school, providing £175 per annum for four consecutive years) and in the same year (15 October) matriculating at [[Balliol College]], [[Oxford]]. Elected to an exhibition the following year, he was placed in the first class, both in [[Classical Moderations]] in 1886 and in the final classical school in 1888. He graduated [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in the same year and proceeded [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|MA]] in 1891 and [[D. Litt]] in 1904. On 5 December 1889 he was elected, after examination, [[fellow]] of [[Hertford College]]. There he became a lecturer in 1892 and tutor in 1902 and he retained these offices until his death in 1906. He was also lecturer in ancient history at [[Brasenose College]] from 1892 to 1905. He vacated his fellowship at Hertford on his marriage in 1895 and on 29 June 1905 was elected to an official fellowship at [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John’s College]]. He examined in the final classical school in 1895-6-7-8.

Abel Hendy Jones was married on 29 June 1895 to Edith Elizabeth, youngest daughter of William Lucy of Headington, [[Oxford]], who owned the Lucy Ironworks, previously known as the [[Eagle Ironworks, Oxford|Eagle Ironworks]], in that town and they had two sons, John Waterman and [[Terence Lucy Greenidge|Terence Lucy]]. It was Terence who introduced [[Evelyn Waugh]] to the Hypocrites Club while they were at [[Oxford University]] together and between John, Terence and Waugh, they staged the ''Scarlet Woman, An Ecclesiastical Melodrama'',[https://web.archive.org/web/20080723210751/http://www.abbotshill.freeserve.co.uk/EWN3-2rtf.rtf] which was an early cinematic production.

He died suddenly at his residence in Oxford of an affection of the heart on 11 March 1906 and was buried in [[Holywell Cemetery]], Oxford. On 29 March 1907 a civil pension of £75 was granted to his widow "in consideration of his services to the study of Roman Law and History" but she too died on 9 July 1907, of a lonely heart.

==Contributions to scholarship==
In spite of his early death, Abel Hendy Jones was constantly employed in academic teaching and his literary works are noted for their quality and quantity. Shortly after graduating, he contributed many articles to a new edition of ''Smith’s Dictionary of Antiquities 1890/1''. He had graduated two years earlier, yet his prestige was such that he was invited to contribute to this authoritative work. His first book ''Infamia, its place in Roman Public and Private Law'' was published at Oxford in 1894. Infamia is the term for loss of civil honour, and Abel made an interesting contribution to the knowledge of Roman legal practice by demonstrating that its legal aspect was quite secondary to its moral and social significance. 

There followed a ''Handbook of Greek Constitutional History'' (1896),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review of ''A Handbook of Greek Constitutional History'' by A. H. J. Greenidge|journal=Saturday Review of Politics, Literature, Science and Art|date=16 January 1897|volume=83|issue=2151|pages=73–74|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=iau.31858016628186;view=1up;seq=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he gave a narrative of the main lines of development of Greek Public Law, ''Roman Public Life'' (1901)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review of ''Roman Public Life'' by A. H. J. Greenidge|journal=Saturday Review of Politics, Literature, Science and Art|date=18 January 1902|volume=93|issue=2412|pages=81–82|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=iau.31858016628285;view=1up;seq=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he traced the growth of the Roman constitution and showed the political genius of Romans in dealing with all the problems of administration they had to face, and ''The Legal Procedure in Cicero’s Time'', Oxford (1901), a systematic and historical treatment of civil and criminal procedure, which was the most important of Abel Hendy Jones’ completed works. He also revised Sir William Smith’s ''History of Rome'' (1897), (down to the death of Justinian) of the ''Student’s Gibbon'' (1899). In 1903, in cooperation with [[Agnes Muriel Clay]], he produced ''Sources of Roman History BC 133-70'' (Oxford), designed to prepare the way for a new [[History of Rome]]. In 1904, he contributed an historical introduction to the 4th edition of Poste’s ''Institutes of Gaius''.

In the same year, appeared the first volume of ''A History of Rome during the Later Republic and Early Principate'' covering the years 133 to 104 B.C. This work was designed to extend to the accession of [[Vespasian]] and to fill six volumes, indeed a ''magnum opus'', but no second volume (which was to end with the first consulship of [[Pompey]] and [[Crassus]]) was issued. The third volume was intended to be up to the death of [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]], the fourth was to cover the Civil War and the rule of [[Augustus]], while the fifth and sixth were to deal with the Emperors up to [[Vespasian]]. Much of Abel Hendy Jones’s most interesting work is to be found in scattered articles, more particularly in the ''Classical Review''. His merit as an historian lies in his "accurate accumulation of detail, combined with critical insight and power of exposition which was not unmixed with occasional paradox".&lt;sup&gt;''[[The Dictionary of National Biography]]'', ed. Dr R. W. Lee.&lt;/sup&gt;

Abel Hendy Jones was without doubt the greatest Classical scholar that the island of [[Barbados]] has ever produced, since Latin and Greek are no longer taught on the island, and has done more to give the island and the West Indies a position of honour in the world of scholarship and learning. ''[[The Times]]'' was moved to write a tribute: "His death will be regarded as a great loss to classical scholarship; in his own department of ancient history he was an acknowledged authority, and what he had already given to the world gave further promise of the future." ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', not to be outdone, declared that "Abel Greenidge had tapped sources of Roman Law that English scholars did not even know about". It can be said that Abel Greenidge was fully qualified to carry on where the great German scholar [[Theodor Mommsen|Mommsen]] had left off.

[[File:Cloître Saint-Trophime Anchor Plate 1.jpg|thumbnail|A stylized anchor plate in the cloister of the [[Church of St. Trophime, Arles]] (France)]]
An '''anchor plate''', '''floor plate'''&lt;ref name= "Oxford Dictionary 2013"/&gt; or '''wall washer''' is a large plate or [[washer (hardware)|washer]] connected to a [[tie rod]] or [[Screw|bolt]]. Anchor plates are used on exterior walls of [[masonry]] buildings, for structural reinforcement. Being visible, many anchor plates are made in a style that is decorative.&lt;ref name="Bucher1996"&gt;{{cite book |title=Dictionary of Building Preservation
|last=Bucher
|first=Ward
|year=1996
|publisher=Preservation Press
|pages=576}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One popular style is the ''star anchor'' — an anchor plate cast or wrought in the shape of a five-pointed star. Other names and styles of anchor plate include '''earthquake washer''', '''triangular washer''', '''S-iron''', and '''T-head'''.&lt;ref name="Bucher1996"/&gt; In the United Kingdom, '''pattress plate''' is the term for circular restraints,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stainless-uk.co.uk/product.asp?id=4 Pattress plate example] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090726130250/http://www.stainless-uk.co.uk/product.asp?id=4 |date=2009-07-26 }} ''stainless-uk.co.uk''&lt;/ref&gt; '''tie bar''' being an alternate term for rectangular restraints.

Anchor plates are made of [[cast iron]], sometimes [[wrought iron]] or [[steel]], and are often used on brick or other masonry-based buildings. They are commonly found in many older cities towns and villages in [[Europe]] and in more recent cities with substantial legacies of 18th- and 19th-century brick construction, such as [[New York City|New York]], [[Philadelphia]], [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], [[Cincinnati]] and [[Charleston, South Carolina]], and in older [[earthquake]] prone cities such as [[San Francisco]], as well as across all of Europe. The tie-rod-and-plate assembly braces the masonry wall against lateral bowing.

==Definition==
According to the ''Oxford Dictionary of Construction, Surveying and Civil Engineering'', an anchor plate "is a plate attached to a component that enables other components to be connected to it."&lt;ref name= "Oxford Dictionary 2013"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Gorse |first1= Christopher |last2= Johnston |first2= David |last3=Pritchard |first3=Martin |date= 2013 |title= Oxford Dictionary of Construction, Surveying and Civil Engineering |url= http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199534463.001.0001/acref-9780199534463-e-0276?rskey=TvqLAq&amp;result=276 |location= |publisher= Oxford University Press |page=20 |isbn= 9780199534463 |author-link=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there are many types of anchors or anchorages, according to the ''Dictionary of Architecture and Construction'', an anchor plate specifically is a "wrought-iron clamp, of [[Flanders|Flemish]] origin, on the exterior side of a brick building wall that is connected to the opposite wall by a steel tie-rod to prevent the two walls from spreading apart; these clamps were often in the shape of numerals indicating the year of construction, or letters representing the owner's initials, or were simply fanciful designs." &lt;ref name="Dictionary of Architecture and Construction"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Harris |first1= Cyril M. |date= 2000 |title= Dictionary of Architecture and Construction, Third Edition |publisher= McGraw Hill |pages= 31–32 |isbn= 0-07-135178-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While most types of anchors are made of only steel, anchor plates might also contain malleable or cast iron. The exterior wall washer is most often made of a cast-iron star or a flat steel plate.&lt;ref name= "Architect and Builder's Pocketbook"&gt;{{cite book |last= Kidder |first=Frank E. |date= 1913 |title= The Architect's and Builder's Handbook |url= https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433087552133;view=1up;seq=7 |publisher= John Wiley &amp; Sons |page= 553}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of use and studies==
In [[Roman technology]], wooden tie-beams (or [[tie rod]]s) were used between arches to negate the outward horizontal forces between them.&lt;ref name= "Engineering Structures, Vol. 124, 2016"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Pisani |first1= Marco Andrea |date= October 1, 2016
 |title= Theoretical approach to the evaluation of the load-carrying capacity of the tie rod anchor system in a masonry wall
 |url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141029616302863?via%3Dihub#b0005
 |journal= Engineering Structures |volume= 124 |issue= |pages= 85–95
 |doi= 10.1016/j.engstruct.2016.06.015 |access-date= November 15, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the modern era, tie-rods are made of iron or steel, and serve to reinforce vaults, arches, and in general masonry structures. [[Reinforced masonry]] walls are strengthened through a tie-rod that connects between parallel walls at the floor-level, which creates a horizontal compression state, thereby increasing the wall's shear strength.&lt;ref name= "Concrete Panels"&gt;Ibid&lt;/ref&gt; While the current literature is very poor, some studies have been done on analysis of anchor plates and tie-rods, for example one study dealing with concrete panels, which, although a thin veneer, may also need anchor plates to help stabilize the wall.&lt;ref name= "Engineering Structures, Vol. 106, 2016"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Shin |first1= Jiuk|last2= Kim |first2= JunHee |last3= Chang |first3= Hak-Jong
 |date= January 1, 2016
 |title= Anchor plate effect on the breakout capacity in tension for thin-walled concrete panels

 |doi= 10.1016/j.engstruct.2015.10.028 |access-date= November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pressure that an anchor plate provides is constantly stiff; however, there appears to be a limit of useful anchor plate widths. That is, a study found that widths greater than {{convert|100|mm}} the advantage of having a wider plate decreased, meaning that there is a threshold for optimal function of the anchor plate.&lt;ref name= "Concrete Panels" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4749">'''Ancient''' and '''modern''' are terms used in [[heraldry]] to differentiate two different coats of arms used at different periods by a family or other bearer. Reasons for changing arms have been numerous, the most famous being the change in the [[Royal arms of France|French royal arms]] to show three fleurs-de-lis instead of ''semee de lis'', possibly to symbolize the Holy [[Trinity]]. The reasons for other changes were more prosaic, for example where a court of chivalry ordered a change or [[Difference (heraldry)|differencing]] where two families claimed the same arms, as in the famous case of [[Scrope v Grosvenor]]. The resulting two versions of arms are referred to as "France ancient" and "France modern",  "Grosvenor ancient" and "Grosvenor modern".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15664">[[File:DiyarbakirWalls.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The black basalt Roman walls of Amid (Diyarbakir)]]
The '''Diocese of Amid''' ([[Diyarbakir]]) was a [[diocese]] or [[archdiocese]] of the [[Chaldean Church]] from the sixteenth to the twentieth century. From at least the 13th century the city of Amid had been part of the Diocese of [[Maiperqat]] of the [[Church of the East]]; following the schism of 1552 it became the seat of its own diocese in the Chaldean Church.

The archdiocese lapsed in 1929 on the death of the bishop Shlemun Mushe al-Sabbagh. The title of Amid was revived by the Chaldean church in 1966 as the [[Chaldean Catholic Archeparchy of Amida]]. The Archeparchy is now the sole remaining Chaldean diocese in [[Turkey]], so in effect has jurisdiction over all of Turkeys Chaldeans. They maintain 2 churches in Diyarbakir and the bishop resides in [[Istanbul]].

==Background==
The [[East Syriac Rite|East Syriac]] Diocese of Amid was a comparatively late foundation. The city of Amid ([[Diyarbakir]]) was predominantly an [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian]] and [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syriac Orthodox]] centre; there is little evidence for a presence of the [[Church of the East]] in the earlier period. Amid was part of the Church of the East Diocese of [[Maiperqat]] in 1257, when the bishop Yohannan 'of Maiperqat and Amid' was present at the consecration of the patriarch [[Mar Makkikha II|Makkikha II]].&lt;ref&gt;Sliba, 120 (Arabic)&lt;/ref&gt; Some years later the bishop Isho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}dnah of 'Maiperqat, Amid and [[Mardin]]' was present at the consecrations of the patriarchs [[Mar Denha I|Denha I]] in 1265 and [[Mar Yaballaha III|Yahballaha III]] in 1281.&lt;ref&gt;Sliba, 121–2 and 124 (Arabic)&lt;/ref&gt; The diocese of Maiperqat is attested as early as 1018, and given the prominence of Maiperqat in the titles of these two bishops, Amid and Mardin were probably administered by the East Syriac bishops of Maiperqat in the thirteenth century.
 
A manuscript in the [[Berlin]] collection lists seven purported fourteenth- and fifteenth-century bishops of Amid:  Marutha, Sliba-zkha, Gabriel, Shem{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}on, Nathaniel, Israel and Shubhalmaran.&lt;ref&gt;MS Berlin Syr 14&lt;/ref&gt; As with a similar list of bishops of Mardin, it is difficult to accept this list as genuine. Towards the end of the fifteenth century Amid appears to have been under the authority of the metropolitan Eliya of Nisibis, who is mentioned in the dating formulas of a number of [[manuscripts]] copied between 1477 and 1483.

The [[colophon (publishing)|colophon]] of a manuscript copied in [[Mardin]] in 1502 mentions a [[Metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] named Eliya. He is possibly to be identified with the above-mentioned metropolitan Eliya of Nisibis but more probably with the metropolitan Eliya of Gazarta, mentioned in the colophon of a manuscript of 1504.

==Chaldean bishops of Amid==
The Chaldean diocese of Amid seems to have been founded by [[Yohannan Sulaqa]] shortly after the schism of 1552 that divided the [[Church of the East]] into the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] and the [[Chaldean Church]]. The monk Hormizd Habib, of the Asmar family of Amid, was consecrated [[Metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] of Amid by Sulaqa on 19 November 1553, taking the name Eliya. He was sent to [[India]] with Sulaqa's brother Joseph in 1555 by the second Chaldean patriarch [[Abdisho IV Maron|{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Abdisho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}} IV Maron]], and appears to have returned to [[Mesopotamia]] early in 1561. Thereafter he is mentioned as metropolitan of Amid, associated with the patriarchs {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Abdisho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}} IV and [[Eliya VII]], in a series of manuscripts from 1562 to 1579. He was able to convert the patriarch Shem{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}on IX Denha to [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]], was created procurator by a synod of East Syriac bishops in 1580, and was sent on a mission to [[Rome]] to seek his confirmation by the [[Holy See|Vatican]]. He died in [[Lebanon]] in 1582, on his return from Rome. 

An archbishop of Amid named Joseph Eliya is mentioned by Leonard Abel in 1583, and is also included in his list of ''the more lettered Nestorians'' in 1587.  

The metropolitan Eliya Bar Tappe, dependent on the patriarch Eliya VIII, is mentioned under a variety of titles in the dating formulas or colophons of several manuscripts between 1599 and 1618. He is listed in the reports of 1607 and 1610 as metropolitan of Amid, and a bishop Isho‘yahb of [[Seert]] is separately listed. He was one of a number of bishops addressed by Peter Strozza in a letter of 1614. In 1616 he was present at the synod of Amid as metropolitan of Seert, but up to 1612 seems to have been responsible for the diocese of Amid as well. 

In 1615, after his return from Rome, the archdeacon Rabban Adam was consecrated metropolitan of Amid.  He took the name Timothy, after the disciple of the apostle Paul, in compliment to [[pope Paul V]]. He was present at the synod of Amid in 1616, and signed its acts as 'metropolitan of [[Jerusalem]] and Amid'.  He signed the profession of faith of Eliya IX in 1617 as 'archbishop of Jerusalem'. He is mentioned in the dating formula of a manuscript of 1619,  and is said to have died of plague in 1621 or 1622.  The note recording his death styled him 'metropolitan of Amid, [[Nisibis]], [[Mardin]], Hesna and Jerusalem'.
 
After Timothy's death Isho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}yahb, nephew of Eliya Bar Tappe and metropolitan of Seert since 1619, seems to have been responsible for Amid also until his death in 1628. A metropolitan named Joseph Isho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}yahb, probably the same man, is mentioned together with the patriarch Eliya in the dating formula of a manuscript copied at [[Aleppo]] in 1626, suggesting that Aleppo was under the jurisdiction of the metropolitans of Amid at this period. 

Thereafter the diocese of Amid seems to have been vacant for ten years until it was filled by the metropolitan Shem{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}on, who was the scribe of manuscripts of 1637 and 1638 and is mentioned in the dating formulas of a number of manuscripts between 1651 and 1657. He is associated in these manuscripts with the [[Assyrian Church of the East|Qochanes patriarch]] Shem{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}on XI, a known supporter of the union with Rome, probably because of his Catholic sympathies.

A metropolitan of Amid named {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Abdisho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}} was one of the signatories of a letter of 22 November 1669 from the patriarch Eliya X to [[pope Clement IX]].  

He was succeeded very soon afterwards by [[Joseph I (Chaldean Patriarch)|Joseph]], the future Amid patriarch, who was also dependent on the Eliya line. In 1672, not long after his consecration, Joseph became a Catholic, and was recognised as an independent archbishop of Amid and Mardin by the Turkish authorities in the face of strenuous opposition from the Nestorian patriarch Eliya X. Not all Amid's East Syriac Christians followed him, however, and a group loyal to Eliya X put forward one of their number, a man named David, who was consecrated by the Nestorian patriarch in opposition to Joseph in 1673. David seems to have resided in Amid for only four years, and on Joseph’s return from Rome in 1677 'fled to [[Egypt]], where he has not been heard of since'. 

Joseph I became patriarch of the Amid Chaldeans in 1681. His health began to deteriorate soon afterwards, and he chose as his successor the Catholic poet [[Joseph II (Chaldean Patriarch)|Sliba Ma{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}ruf]] of [[Tel Keppe|Telkepe]], whom he ordained as a priest in 1689, giving him the name Joseph, and metropolitan of Amid in 1691. He left Amid again in August 1694 for a second visit to Rome, where he remained until his death in 1707. In 1696 the metropolitan Joseph was recognised by the Vatican as the Amid patriarch Joseph II. 

[[Joseph III (Chaldean Patriarch)|Timothy Maroge]] of [[Baghdad]], the future Amid patriarch Joseph III, was consecrated metropolitan of Amid by Joseph II ''c.''1705. He had been a metropolitan for three years and was ministering to the Chaldeans of Mardin when he was recalled to Amid on the outbreak of the plague of 1708. According to the narrative of the Syrian Catholic priest Eliya ibn al-Qsir, he was the only Chaldean bishop to have survived the plague. He was elected patriarch in 1713, a few months after the death of Joseph II in 1712. 

Between 1717 and 1728 the metropolitan of Amid was {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Abd al-Ahad, son of Garabet, of {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Aïn Tannur, author of a ''Life'' of Joseph I, who took the name Basil. He was consecrated by Timothy III in the village of {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Aïn Tannur on Sunday, 5 November 1717. He died on 3 January 1728. His Catholic profession of faith is given by [[Giuseppe Luigi Assemani|Assemani]]. 

He was succeeded by Timothy Masaji, who was consecrated by Joseph III, and seems to have been metropolitan of Amid for nearly thirty years.  According to one source, he died on 31 December 1756,  but Tfinkdji states that he died on 1 January 1757, 'poisoned by the heretics, it is said'.

According to Cardinal Tamburini, Joseph III consecrated a 23- or 25-year-old priest named Antony Gallo as his coadjutor on 20 November 1754, with the intention that he would eventually succeed him as Amid patriarch. Following protests by the Catholics of Amid his election as coadjutor was disallowed by the Vatican, and he died shortly afterwards, on 11 January 1757. Tisserant has suggested that Antony was also metropolitan of Amid from 1754 onwards, but it seems more likely that Timothy Masaji remained metropolitan of Amid until his death. 

Timothy Masaji was succeeded in 1757 by [[Joseph IV (Chaldean Patriarch)|La{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}zar Hindi]], who had been educated at the [[Propaganda Fide|Propaganda]].  La{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}zar Hindi, who also took the name Timothy, was consecrated on 8 February 1757 by Basil, bishop of Mardin, shortly after the death of Joseph III in January 1757. He succeeded Joseph III as the fourth Amid patriarch shortly afterwards, and his transfer from the see of Amid and appointment as patriarch was confirmed by the Vatican on 25 March 1759.

He was succeeded by Yohannan al-Akkari (1760–77), who is mentioned in the dating formula of a manuscript of 1766/7,  and then by [[Augustine Hindi]] (1777–1804).  

Basil Asmar of [[Tel Keppe|Telkepe]], a monk of the monastery of [[Rabban Hormizd Monastery|Rabban Hormizd]] and metropolitan of [[Amadiya|{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Amadiya]] since 1824, fled to Amid in 1827 after being expelled from Telkepe by [[Yohannan Hormizd]], and was consecrated metropolitan of Amid after the death of Augustine Hindi. On his death in 1842 he was succeeded by Giwargis Peter di Natale, the coadjutor of the patriarch Yohannan VIII Hormizd, who died in 1867. 

Peter Timothy {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Attar was metropolitan of Amid from 1870 to 1873. He was succeeded in 1874 by {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Abdisho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}} Giwargis Khayyat, previously metropolitan of {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Amadiya, who became patriarch in 1894.

The last Chaldean bishop of Amid was Shlemun Mushe al-Sabbagh, who succeeded Giwargis {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Abdisho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}} Khayyat in 1897. He left his diocese in 1915, during the massacres of Christians in the region. According to his epitaph in the Chaldean church of Mar Pethion in Amid, in which his name is given as Shlemun Bar Sr{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}a, he was born in [[Mosul]] in April 1865, became a priest in April 1888, was consecrated metropolitan of Amid and Maiperqat in September 1897, and died in June 1929. 

The title of Amid, often now known as the [[Archeparchy of Diyarbakir]], was revived by the Chaldean church in 1966 for the sole remaining Chaldean diocese in Turkey, whose bishop resided in Istanbul.

== Population statistics ==
[[Image:Amid_Map.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Amid (Diyarbakr) and its environs]]
A number of statistics are available for the Chaldean diocese of Amid. In 1757 it contained 3 churches and 5,000 believers (Hindi). In 1818 only three [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Jacobite]] villages, two [[Armenians|Armenian]] villages, and the Chaldean village of Sharukhiya remained in the immediate vicinity of the city of Amid (Campanile). 

In 1850 the diocese consisted of Amid itself and the villages of Sharukhiya and 'Ali Pasha' ({{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Aïn Tannur), with two churches, four priests, and 150 Chaldean families (Badger).  In 1867 it had 2 villages, 6 priests and 2,000 believers (Martin).

In 1896 the diocese of Amid had 3,000 Chaldeans, with parishes for Sharukhiya and Maiperqat, and stations in the villages of Boshat and Bakos (Chabot). The diocese had 3 churches, with a chapel at {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Aïn Tannur. 
 
The diocese of Amid contained 9 villages, 12 priests and 4,180 believers in 1913 (Tfinkdji).  By then it also included the villages of 'Navdacht', 'Zéré' and 'Attche' (Hattakh near Maiperqat), which lay in the plain between the Tigris and Sasun rivers, and had been recently converted from the [[Assyrian Church of the East]].

'''''Christopher Columbus and the Participation of the Jews in the Spanish and Portuguese Discoveries''''' is a scholarly work by [[Meyer Kayserling]], translated into English and published in 1894. In it, Keyserling reports on an extensive search of [[List_of_archives_in_Spain|Spanish archives]] including those at [[Alcalá de Henares]], [[Barcelona]], [[Madrid]], and [[Seville]]. His research showed that [[Marranos]], who attempted to shield themselves and their families from the [[anti-Semitic]] violence of the [[Spanish Inquisition]] by outwardly professing Christianity, were an integral part of the [[European_colonization_of_the_Americas|European colonization of the Americas]]. Keyserling's discovery of evidence that [[Luis de Torres]], who sailed with Columbus in 1492, was a Marrano is memorialized in the naming of [[Luis de Torres Synagogue]] in [[the Bahamas]].

'''Cornelis Kiliaan''' (1528, [[Duffel]] &amp;ndash; 1607, [[Antwerp]]), was a 16th-century lexicographer, linguist, translator and poet of the Southern Netherlands.

==Biography==
He was born in Duffel between 1528 and 1530. His parents, Anna and Hendrick van Kiele Rechtstraets, were wealthy citizens of Duffel. His father died when he was still a child. 
In 1548, he went to study Latin, Greek and Hebrew at University of Louvain, where he later taught law. After his studies, he found a job in the printshop recently founded by [[Christophe Plantin]], which grew to become the largest in Europe of that period. He started at the bottom as a typographer and printer, but he was promoted to first assistant in 1558. Plantin was clearly confident in the quality of Kiliaan because in 1565, he was appointed proofreader, a function reserved for scholars. Perhaps it helped that after his mother died in 1564, the whole of the family wealth passed into Kiliaan's hands, leaving him free of financial worries and allowing him to pursue his studies on language and the Bible. During his print career he worked on several translations, even translating documents seized from the Spanish enemy for the local authorities during the [[Dutch Revolt]]. In 1574 he published a Dutch-Latin dictionary ''Dictionarium Teutonico-Latinum'', with 12,000 entries, which was innovative because he indicated forms close to other related languages. He was thus the first in Europe to implement linguistic comparison. In 1588, Kiliaan completed a second edition of his dictionary that was almost three times as large. This time he used not only other dictionaries as a source, but also delved into other published works. Another novelty is that he indicated a number of words in the region in which they were used. Finally, in 1599 he published his magnum opus, the etymology. This book is mentioned as one of the 1000 most important texts of the Dutch language in the [[Canon of Dutch Literature]].

At age 50, he married Maria Bosmans who gave him three daughters: Catharina, Maria and Anna. In 1604, he resigned from the Plantin printshop due to illness. He died 15 April 1607 and was buried at the Cathedral of Our Lady in Antwerp.

{{confused|alternate history}}

'''Counterfactual history''', also sometimes referred to as '''virtual history''', is a form of [[historiography]] that attempts to answer "[[wikt:what if|what if]]" questions known as [[counterfactuals]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin Bunzl, "Counterfactual History: A User's Guide," ''American Historical Review'' (2004) 109#3 pp. 845–858 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/530560 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Black and MacRaild provide this definition: "It is, at the very root, the idea of conjecturing on what did not happen, or what might have happened, in order to understand what did happen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jeremy Black|author2=Donald M. MacRaild|title=Studying History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pQZeAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA125|year=2007|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|page=125|isbn=9780230364929}}&lt;/ref&gt; The method seeks to explore history and historical incidents by means of extrapolating a timeline in which certain key historical events did not happen or had an outcome which was different from that which did in fact occur. It has produced a [[literary genre]] which is variously called [[alternate history|alternative history]], [[speculative fiction|speculative history]], or hypothetical history.&lt;ref name = "Arnold" /&gt;

One goal is to estimate the relative importance of a specific event, incident or person. For instance, to the counterfactual claim "What would have happened had [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] drunk [[coffee]] instead of [[tea]] on the afternoon he committed suicide?", the timeline would have remained unchanged—Hitler in all likelihood still would have committed suicide on April 30, 1945, regardless of what he had to drink that afternoon. However, to the counterfactual "What would have happened had Hitler died in the [[20 July plot|July 1944 assassination attempt]]?", all sorts of possibilities become readily apparent, starting with the assumption that the German generals, had they been able to consolidate power over remaining Nazi functionaries such as [[Joseph Goebbels|Goebbels]] and [[Heinrich Himmler|Himmler]], would probably have sued for peace, bringing an early end to [[World War II]]. (Historians generally feel popular support for the Party was still very strong in July 1944, and the party apparatus of Himmler, Goebbels, [[Albert Speer|Speer]], [[Martin Bormann|Bormann]], [[Hermann Göring|Göring]] etc. would survive even an assassination of Hitler.) Thus, the counterfactual brings into sharp relief the question of how important Hitler was as an individual and how his personal fate shaped the course of the war and, ultimately, of world history.

==Development==
Although there are [[Victorian era|Victorian]] examples of counterfactual history, it was not until the very late 20th century that the exploration of counterfactuals in history was to begin in earnest.

An early example is ''[[If It Had Happened Otherwise]]'' (1931) which features a contribution by [[Winston Churchill]] who examined what would have happened had [[Robert E. Lee]] won at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.winstonchurchill.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=674 |title=If Lee Had Not Won the Battle of Gettysburg |first=Winston |last=Churchill |authorlink=Winston Churchill |publisher=The Churchill Centre |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105132718/http://www.winstonchurchill.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=674 |archivedate=January 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this volume is notable for featuring imagined histories by serious historians, the histories are presented in narrative form (in most cases with a fairly whimsical tone) without any analysis of the reasoning behind these scenarios, so they fall short of modern standards for serious counterfactual history and are closer to the fictional [[alternate history]] genre.

A significant foray into treating counterfactual scenarios seriously was made by the economic historian [[Robert Fogel]]. In his 1964 book ''[[Railroads and American Economic Growth: Essays in Econometric History]]'', Fogel tried to use quantitative methods to imagine what the U.S. economy would have been like in 1890 had there been no railroads.&lt;ref name="eh.net"&gt;[http://eh.net/bookreviews/library/davis.shtml Railroads and American Economic Growth: Essays in Econometric History – Book Reviews ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060228010214/http://eh.net/bookreviews/library/davis.shtml |date=2006-02-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fogel hypothesizes that, in the absence of the railroad, America’s large canal system would have been expanded and its roads would have been improved through pavement; both of these improvements would take away from the social impact of the railroad. He estimates that “the level of per capita income achieved by January 1, 1890 would have been reached by March 31, 1890, if railroads had never been invented.”&lt;ref name="eh.net"/&gt;

Few further attempts to bring counterfactual history into the world of academia were made until the 1991 publication of ''[[Plausible Worlds|Plausible Worlds: Possibility and Understanding in History and the Social Sciences]]'' by the Cambridge sociologist [[Geoffrey Hawthorn]], who carefully explored three different counterfactual scenarios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Frederic |last=Smoler |title=Past Tense |url=http://www.americanheritage.com/content/past-tense |journal=American Heritage |date=September 1999 |volume=50 |number=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work helped inspire ''[[Virtual History: Alternatives and Counterfactuals]]'' (1997), a collection of essays exploring different scenarios by a number of historians, edited by the historian [[Niall Ferguson]]. Ferguson has become a significant advocate of counterfactual history, using counterfactual scenarios to illustrate his objections to deterministic theories of history such as [[Marxism]], and to put forward a case for the importance of contingency in history, theorizing that a few key changes could result in a significantly different modern world. A series of [[What If? (essays)|"What If?"]] books edited by [[Robert Cowley]] presented dozens of essays by historians or prominent writers about "how a slight turn of fate at a decisive moment could have changed the very annals of time."&lt;ref name = "Arnold"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/21/books/making-books-the-what-ifs-that-fascinate.html?src=pm|title=Making books: The 'What Ifs' that fascinate|last=Arnold|first=Martin|date=December 21, 2000|work=New York Times|accessdate=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars argue that a counterfactual is not as much a matter of what happened in the past but it is the disagreement about which past events were most significant. For example, William Thompson employs a sequence of counterfactuals for eight lead economies that have driven [[globalization]] processes for almost a thousand years. From [[Song dynasty]] in China to [[Genoa]], [[Venice]], [[Portugal]], the [[Netherlands]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and the [[United States]], and claims that each actor in succession played an unusually critical role in creating a structure of leadership that became increasingly global in scope across time.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson. W. The Lead Economy Sequence in World Politics (From Sung China to the United States): Selected Counterfactuals. Journal of Globalization Studies. Vol. 1, num. 1. 2010. pp. 6–28 [http://www.socionauki.ru/journal/articles/126971/]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Differences from alternate history===
Counterfactual history is neither [[historical revisionism]] nor [[alternate history]].

Counterfactual history distinguishes itself through its interest in the very incident that is being negated by the counterfactual, thus seeking to evaluate the event's relative historical importance. Such historians reason arguments for each change, outlining changes in broad terms only, as befits a mere byproduct of the exercise.

An alternate history writer, on the other hand, is interested precisely in the hypothetical scenarios that flow from the negated incident or event. A fiction writer is thus free to invent very specific events and characters in the imagined history.

The line is sometimes blurred as historians may invent more detailed timelines as illustrations of their ideas about the types of changes that might have occurred. But it is usually clear what general types of consequences the author thinks are reasonable to suppose would have been likely to occur, and what specific details are included in an imagined timeline only for illustrative purposes.

The line is further blurred by novelists such as [[Kim Stanley Robinson]], whose alternate-history novel ''[[The Years of Rice and Salt]]'' has a character talking of historians' use of counterfactuals, within the novel's alternate history. He dismisses this as "a useless exercise".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infinityplus.co.uk/nonfiction/riceandsalt.htm|title=Kim Stanley Robinson: The Years of Rice and Salt – an infinity plus review|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Most historians regard counterfactual history as perhaps entertaining, but not meeting the standards of mainstream historical research due to its speculative nature. Advocates of counterfactual history often respond that all statements about [[causality]] in history contain implicit counterfactual claims—for example, the claim that a certain military decision helped a country win a war presumes that if that decision had not been made, the war would have been less likely to be won, or would have been longer.

Since counterfactual history is such a recent development, a serious, systematic critique of its uses and methodologies has yet to be made, as the movement itself is still working out those methods and frameworks.

Aviezer Tucker has offered a range of criticism of this approach to the study of the past both in his review of Ferguson's ''Virtual History in History and Theory''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/0018-2656.00090 |title=Historiographical Counterfactuals and Historical Contingency |journal=History and Theory |volume=38 |number=2 |pages=264–276 |date=May 1999 |last=Tucker |first=Aviezer}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in his book ''Our Knowledge of the Past: A Philosophy of Historiography'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.cambridge.org/gb/knowledge/isbn/item1171466/?site_locale=en_GB |title=Our Knowledge of the Past: A Philosophy of Historiography |last=Tucker |first=Aviezer |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-521-83415-5 |doi=10.2277/0521834155}}&lt;/ref&gt; as has [[Richard J.

'''Ernest Louis Georges Will''' (25 April 1913  – 24 September 1997) was a 20th-century French archaeologist and University professor, a member of the [[Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aibl.fr/membres/academiciens-depuis-1663/#W Liste des académiciens, site de l'Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
After he finished his secondary studies at the [[Jean Sturm Gymnasium]] and passed a licence de lettres at the [[Strasbourg University]], Ernest Will joined the [[École Normale Supérieure]] in 1933 and obtained an [[Agrégation in France|Aggregation classique]] in 1936. He was a student of the [[French School at Athens]] from 1937 to 1939 and led excavations on the sites of [[Thasos]], [[Delos]] and [[Delphi]]. When he was mobilized at the approach of World War II, he was affected in [[Beirut]] to the staff of [[Maxime Weygand|general Weygand]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Malou Schneider]], « Du Rhin à l'Euphrate. Archéologues alsaciens au Levant », ''Subartu'' XVII, 2006, (p.&amp;nbsp;1–6).&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Armistice of 22 June 1940]], he returned to France where he was now a teacher at the lycée Thiers in Marseille from 1940 to 1943, an assistant to dean [[Charles Dugas]] at the Faculty of Arts of Lyon,&lt;ref&gt;Mélanges offerts à Ernest Will, ''Revue du Nord'',LXVI, n°260, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; then he taught at the [[Collège-lycée Ampère]] in Lyon (1945).

On 1 October 1946, he became, with [[Jean Starcky]], one of the first residents of the [[Institut français du Proche-Orient|French Institute for Archaeology]] in Beirut, which has founded the same year by [[Henri Seyrig]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/syria_0039-7946_2005_num_82_1_8696 Mathilde Gelin, L’Institut français d’archéologie de Beyrouth, 1946-1977], ''Syria'', 2005/82, (p.&amp;nbsp;279–329) (p.&amp;nbsp;285).&lt;/ref&gt; and specialized in research on the Hellenized Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maurice Sartre]], « Ernest Will 1913-1997 », ''Encyclopaedia universalis''&lt;/ref&gt;

On his return to France in 1951, he was an assistant in Greek language at the University of Lille (1951–1953). He defended a [[Doctorate#France|thèse d'État]] ès lettres in 1953, entitled ''Le relief cultuel gréco-romain : contribution à l'histoire de l'art de l'Empire romain'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sudoc.fr/051232561 Thèse d'État, notice Sudoc], read online&lt;/ref&gt; and was recruited as a university professor in Lille (1953–1963). He was Director of Historic Antiquities of North-Picardie (1953–1968). He joined the Faculté des lettres de Paris as Greek language and literature professor (1963–1970) and then became a professor of art history and archeology at the Institute of Art and Archaeology of the [[Pantheon-Sorbonne University]] (1970-1973).

He returned to Beirut as Director of the Institut français d’archéologie du Proche-Orient (IFAPO) (1973-1980), and in this context,  engaged into considerable activity during the [[Lebanese Civil War]], to protect the interests of the Institute and "give it a new impetus," including by opening branches in [[Amman]] (Jordan) and [[Damascus]] (Syria)&lt;ref&gt;[[Maurice Sartre]], notice in the l'''Encyclopaedia Universalis''&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2003, the IFAPO is a component of the current [[Institut français du Proche-Orient]] (IFPO).

After his mission was accomplished, he resumed his position at the Institut d'art et d'archéologie then took his academic retirement in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.mae.u-paris10.fr/index.php/ernest-will-arch-ologie-du-proche-orient-hell-nistique-et-romain Fonds EW - Ernest Will.

For 19 years he directed the [[academic journal]] ''[[Syria (journal)|Syria]]'' dedicated to archaeology published by the Institut Français du Proche-Orient (1978–1997).

He was appointed member of the Scientific Council of the [[École française d'Extrême-Orient]] in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do;jsessionid=3A57D8577FA654F9857086F5F8027E1B.tpdila16v_3?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000345628&amp;dateTexte=&amp;oldAction=rechJO&amp;categorieLien=id&amp;idJO=JORFCONT000000003852 Arrêté du 2 juin 1992, JORF n°130, 5 June 1992  (p.&amp;nbsp;7483)].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Estat Català''' ({{IPA-ca|əsˈtat kətəˈla|ec}}, literally "Catalan State") is a [[Catalan independentism|pro-independence]] nationalist historical [[political party]] of [[Catalonia]] ([[Spain]]).

==History==
[[File:Estelada blava.svg|left|thumb|Blue ''Estelada'' (independentist flag of Catalonia) used systematically for the first time by Estat Català]]
Estat Català was founded by [[Francesc Macià]] in 1922 on its origins as a political and paramilitary organisation whose purpose was to bring about the independence of Catalonia from Spain. During the 1920s, the party was active in the fight against [[Primo de Rivera|General Primo de Rivera]]'s regime and the monarchy. Their actions included a failed assassination attempt against the [[King of Spain]] [[Alfonso XIII]] in an operation of its secret paramilitary unit named [[Santa Germandat Catalana de la Bandera Negra]] (Holy Catalan Brotherhood of the Black Flag) that was known as the [[Complot de Garraf]] (Conspiracy of [[Garraf]]). Estat Català also raised a small army named [[Exèrcit Català]] (Catalan Army) led by [[Francesc Macià]] to take control over the [[Principality of Catalonia|Principality]] from [[Prats-de-Mollo-la-Preste]], in [[France|French]] [[Northern Catalonia]].
[[Image:Monument Macià.jpg|thumb|Monument to [[Francesc Macià]] in [[Plaça Catalunya, Barcelona|Plaça Catalunya]] ([[Barcelona]]).]]

When the government of [[Primo de Rivera]] banned separatist movements, the party became clandestine and [[Francesc Macià]] went into [[exile]]. Nonetheless, Estat Català was one of the parties promoting the "[[San Sebastian (Spain)|San Sebastian]] pact" with [[Basque nationalism]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galician]] nationalists and [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish republicans]] they agreed to push for a [[Democracy|democratic]] process in the Spanish monarchy.

During a conference held on the 17 and 19 of March 1931 at ''Cros'' street in the ''Sants'' district of Barcelona, Estat Català joined the [[Partit Republicà Català]] and the political group [[L'Opinió]] to form [[Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya]]. Nevertheless, inside [[Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya]], the organizational autonomy of Estat Català was preserved and it controlled the influential youth section of the party (known as [[Joventuts d'Esquerra Republicana-Estat Català]] and, across [[Francesc Macià]], his controlled the leadership of the new party.

In April 1931, [[Francesc Macià]] proclaimed the [[Catalan Republic (1931)|Catalan Republic]] in Barcelona, and established the [[Generalitat de Catalunya]]. [[Francesc Macià]], with the support of a wide majority of the [[Catalan people]],{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} was the first president of the re-established Generalitat. After Francesc Macià's death (December, 1933) Estat Català tried to retain control of [[Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya]], competing with the successor of Macià, the regionalist (rather than independentist) [[Lluís Companys]] (whose political background was in the [[Partit Republicà Català]]). The leadership of Estat Català fell to [[Josep Dencàs i Puigdollers]] and Estat Català took control of the Council of Interior and the policial forces of Catalonia. After the failure of the armed insurrection of October 1934, that pitted the autonomous government of Catalunya and its police with the Spanish government and the Spanish Army, Estat Català, after accusing [[Lluís Companys]] of perfidity, left [[Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya]] and once again became an independent party. The youth section of [[Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya]], traditionally strongly paramilitary, also left the party and adhered to Estat Català. In 1936 the [[Spanish Civil War]] began.

Estat Català fought actively on the war fronts, creating its own corps of volunteers, the most important military units of Estat Català being the [[Pyrenees|Pyrenaic]] mountain militias named [[Regiment Pirinenc de Catalunya]], the [[Columna Macià-Companys]] and the expeditionary corp that fought in [[Majorca]] named [[Columna Volant Catalana]] (later [[132 Brigada Mixta]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

Estat Català were opposed to the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|revolutionary process]] in Catalonia during the war and to president [[Lluís Companys]]'s delivery of power to anarchist syndicates. Relations between Estat Català and [[Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya]] became very bad. Estat Català planned a conspiracy to take control of the Autonomous government of Catalonia using its military units and the police of [[Catalonia]] for re-lead the situation using the force to be able to proclaim Catalonia's independence. The conspiracy to be discovered in September 1936 and the principal leaders of Estat Català were forced to flee to France.  

From 1939, having lost the war, many of the combatants of the party were executed or died in [[exile]]. Also, some militants in exile in France were captured by the [[Vichy France|French government]], handed to the [[nazis|German nazis]] and deported to the extermination camps of [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp|Mauthausen]] and [[Gusen concentration camp|Gusen]]. Those who stayed free joined the [[French Resistance]] and had worked intensely to help allied airmen and Jews to escape from occupied [[France]] and against the [[Francoist State]] up to his death.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

Estat Català also gave [[Catalan nationalism]] a globalised vision of the [[Catalan nation]]:{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} as early as in 1942, the party published the first map of the so-called "[[Catalan Countries]]" which included the [[Principality of Catalonia|Principality]] (with [[Northern Catalonia]] included), the [[Valencian Community]], the [[Balearic Islands]], the coterminous area of [[Catalonia]] with [[Aragón]] (known as [[La Franja]] or ''The Stripe'') and the ancient Catalan town of Alghero in [[Sardinia]].

In 1975, after the death of [[Francisco Franco|Franco]], Spain started a process of democratisation. In 1976, after decades of secrecy, Estat Català claimed again its legalization under the direction of historical members of the party such as Josep Planchart i Martori, Ramon Rius, Xavier Balagueró i Ràfols, Jaume Ros i Serra, Martí Torrent i Blanchart, etc. Supporter of the independence movement of the Catalan Countries were declared, and interclass-conscious and they received the adhesion of historical militants of the years of the foundation of the party like [[Ventura Gassol i Rovira]]. By the time the Spanish general elections of 1977 were held Estat Català yet had not been legalized and had to form a coalition with other parties in the same situation (like [[Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya]]). Estat Català achieved legalization that same year and, on 16 September 1977 was finally registered in the Registry of Political Parties of the Ministerio del Interior. Later it spoke against the approval of the [[Spanish Constitution]] of 1978 and the [[Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia of 1979|regional political autonomy]], since it considered them tools contrary to the full freedoms of the Catalans, like this like continuation of the Spanish State of the ''[[Caudillo]]'' Franco. According to the positioning of Estat Català, sustained already during the [[Spanish State]] on considering the possibility of a claim future of Statute, a Statute like that of 1979 remained subordinated to a Constitution on he denying the inalienable national rights and imposing a Borbonic monarchy which was the heir of that of 1714 and of Francoist Spain.

Estat Català has contested Spanish general elections, but it did not initially stand in the Catalan regional elections, in order to not reduce the vote of the other nationalist parties. In the [[Spanish general election, 1979|Spanish general elections of 1979]] it obtained 6,328 votes, which was 0.29% of the total. At the municipal level Estat Català use the name [[Acció Municipal Democràtica]] has been presented repeatedly in the elections or in proper noun or lamb through its coalition.

== Recent history ==
Estat Català has contested several elections but has never attained a result better than 0.6% of the vote in [[Catalonia]]. At municipal level, through its municipal coalition [[Acció Municipal Democràtica]] it has achieved a variable number of town councilors depending on the electoral contest and also the government of some towns (45 town councilors 1979, 9 town councilors and two mayor's offices 2007, etc...)

Regarding the recent results Estat Català contested the elections to the [[Catalonian parliamentary election, 1999|Parliament of Catalonia in 1999]], obtaining 1,174 votes (0.06%).

'''Eugène Paul Louis Schueller''' (20 March 1881 – 23 August 1957) was a French pharmacist and entrepreneur who was the founder of [[L'Oréal]], the world's leading company in [[cosmetics]] and [[beauty]]. He was one of the founders of modern [[advertising]].

== Career with L'Oréal ==
As a young [[French people|French]] [[chemist]] of Alsatian paternal origin, Eugène Schueller graduated in 1904 from the Institut de Chimie Appliquée de Paris (now [[Chimie ParisTech]]). Schueller developed in 1907 an innovative hair-color formula, which he called '''Oréale'''. He formulated and manufactured his own products, and sold them to [[Paris]]ian hairdressers.

In 1909, he registered his company, the ''Société Française de Teintures Inoffensives pour Cheveux'', the future [[L'Oréal]]. The guiding principles of the company that would become L'Oréal were put into place from the start: research and innovation in the interest of beauty.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

==  Support for fascism ==
During the early twentieth century, Schueller provided financial support and held meetings for [[La Cagoule]] at L'Oréal headquarters. La Cagoule was a violent French [[fascist]]-leaning, [[Anti-Semitism|antisemitic]] and anti-[[communist]] group whose leader formed a political party [[Mouvement Social Révolutionnaire]] (MSR, Social Revolutionary Movement) which in Occupied France supported the Vichy collaboration with the conquerors from [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gladwell.com/2011/2011_03_28_a_color_of_money.html |title=The Color of Money |date=March 28, 2011 |publisher=[[The New Yorker]] |author=Malcolm Gladwell |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505045702/http://gladwell.com/2011/2011_03_28_a_color_of_money.html |archivedate=May 5, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

L'Oréal hired several members of the group as executives after [[World War II]], such as [[Jacques Corrèze]], who served as [[CEO]] of the [[United States|U.S.]] operation. This involvement was extensively researched by [[Michael Bar-Zohar]] in his book, ''[[Bitter Scent]]''.

== Family ==
Schueller's daughter, [[Liliane Bettencourt]], was the widow of [[André Bettencourt]] with whom she had one daughter, [[Françoise Bettencourt Meyers]], a member of L'Oréal's [[board of directors]]. Françoise Meyers is married to Jean-Pierre Meyers, whose rabbi grandfather died in the Nazi concentration camp at [[Auschwitz]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/21/world/europe/liliane-bettencourt-dead-loreal.html&lt;/ref&gt; At one time, Liliane Bettencourt was the wealthiest woman in the world, with holdings estimated at US$36.4 billion.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/profile/liliane-bettencourt/?list=billionaires. Accessed 2 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The head office of L'Oréal in [[Clichy, Hauts-de-Seine]] is named ''Centre Eugène Schueller''.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.loreal.com/_en/_ww/html/our-company/world-presence.aspx World Presence]." [[L'Oréal]]. Retrieved on 14 July 2010. "Centre Eugène Schueller 41, rue Martre 92117 CLICHY"&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Henriette-Bathily Women's Museum''' (in [[French language|French]]: ''Musée de la Femme Henriette-Bathily'') is a [[museum]] which was located on [[Gorée]], an island on the coast of [[Senegal]], across from the [[House of Slaves (Gorée)]]. Since May 2015, it is now located in Dakar, at the Place du Souvenir Africain et de la Diaspora (Corniche Ouest).
A project conceived in 1987 by the filmmaker [[Ousmane William Mbaye]], it was opened in 1994 under the direction of [[Annette Mbaye d'Erneville]].

==Collections==

There were two levels within this colonial residence, built in 1777 during the [[French colonial]] period, having belonged to a wealthy [[signare]], [[Victoria Albis]]. Until 1962, it was the property of the Angrand family, notably [[Armand-Pierre Angrand]], a descendant of the signare, writer, a mayor of Gorée and the first mayor of colour of [[Dakar]] in 1936.

Museum exhibits include common objects from the colonial period, farming tools, musical instruments, pottery, basketry, as well as photographs allowing a better understanding of the daily life of women in the country. The prominent figures of Senegalese women's emancipation are celebrated, for example the novelist [[Aminata Sow Fall]]. The building was also previously a [[courthouse]], then the Museum of the [[Institut fondamental d'Afrique noire]] which was succeeded in 1966 by [[Institut Français d'Afrique Noire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Musée de la Femme "Henriette Bathily" in Goree, Senegal|url=http://www.museevirtuel-virtualmuseum.ca/edu/ViewLoitLo.do;jsessionid=C108770831568A1190E59E30AB465852?method=preview&amp;lang=EN&amp;id=11233|publisher=Canadian Heritage Information Network|accessdate=August 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
[[Image:VictoriaAlbisHouse.jpg|thumb|upright|The former home of [[Victoria Albis]].]]
Workshops were organized there and women of the island gather there to work together, to follow literacy courses, or to receive artisanal training (cloth [[dyeing]], [[batik]], [[weaving]], [[glass painting]], or traditional [[embroidery]]).

Specific projects are aimed at [[disabled]] women.

==Influence==
The museum has a number of facilities in addition to the artifact displays. It includes an audiovisual room; a boutique; a garden cafe, and an "Espace Culturel et Artisanat" (cultural and artisan space) enabling groups of women from all regions and ethnic backgrounds of Senegal to work at the museum and demonstrate their wide knowledge to visitors. It also provides women with education and training in literacy, civil education, environmental conservation and health education provides training in handicraft techniques. There is a documentation and specialized library service to provide a public databank and research centre. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Henriette Bathily Museum|url=http://www.museevirtuel-virtualmuseum.ca/edu/ViewLoitDa.do?method=preview&amp;lang=EN&amp;id=11236|publisher=Canadian Heritage Information Network|accessdate=October 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of Panama}}

==The 1964 riots==
Public demonstrations and riots arising from popular resentment over United States policies and the overwhelming presence of United States citizens and institutions had not been uncommon, but the [[rioting that occurred in January 1964]] was uncommonly serious. The incident began with a symbolic dispute over the flying of the [[Panamanian flag]] in the [[Panama Canal Zone|Canal Zone]].

For some time the dispute had been seriously complicated by differences of opinion on that issue between the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] and the [[Department of State]]. On the one hand, the military opposed accepting a Panamanian flag, emphasizing the strategic importance of unimpaired United States control in the Canal Zone and the dangerous precedent that appeasement of the rioters' demands would set for future United States-Panamanian relations. The Department of State, on the other hand, supported the flag proposal as a reasonable concession to Panamanian demands and a method of avoiding major international embarrassment. Diplomatic officials also feared that the stability of Panamanian political institutions themselves might be threatened by extensive violence and mob action over the flag issue.

The United States finally agreed to raise the Panamanian and United States flags side by side at one location. The special ceremony on September 21, 1960 at the [[Shaler Triangle]] was attended by the new governor of the zone, Major General [[William A. Carter]], along with all high United States military and diplomatic officers and the entire Panamanian cabinet. Even this incident, however, which marked official recognition of Panama's "titular" sovereignty, was marred when the United States rejected former president [[Ernesto de la Guardia]]'s request to allow him to raise the flag personally. De la Guardia, as a retaliatory measure, refused to attend the ceremony and extended invitations to the presidential reception after the ceremony only to the United States ambassador and his senior diplomatic aides; United States Canal Zone and military officials were excluded.

Panamanians remained dissatisfied as their flag appeared at only one location in the Canal Zone, while the United States flag flew alone at numerous other sites. An agreement was finally reached that at several points in the Canal Zone the United States and Panamanian flags would be flown side by side. United States citizens residing in the Canal Zone were reluctant to abide by this agreement, however, and the students of an American high school, with adult encouragement, on two consecutive days hoisted the American flag alone in front of their school.

Word of the gesture soon spread across the border, and on the evening of the second day, January 9, 1964, nearly 200 Panamanian students marched into the Canal Zone with their flag. A struggle ensued, and the Panamanian flag was torn. After that provocation, thousands of Panamanians stormed the border fence. The rioting lasted 3 days, and resulted in 21 deaths, serious injuries to several hundred persons, and more than US$2 million of property damage.

At the outbreak of the fighting, Panama charged the United States with aggression. Panama severed relations with the United States and appealed to the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS) and the [[United Nations]] (UN). On January 10 the OAS referred the case to the [[Inter-American Peace Committee]]. When the UN Security Council met, United States ambassador [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]]  noted that the Inter-American Peace Committee had already scheduled an on-the-spot investigation and urged that the problem be considered in the regional forum. A proposal by the [[Brazil]]ian delegate that the [[president of the Security Council]] address an appeal to the two parties to exercise restraint was agreed on, and the UN took no further action.

The United States had hoped to confine the controversy to the Inter-American Peace Committee. But when negotiations broke down, Panama insisted that the [[Organ of Consultation]] under the 1947 [[Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance]] (the so-called Rio Treaty) be [[convoked]]. The OAS Council, acting provisionally as the Organ of Consultation, appointed an investigating committee consisting of all the members of the Council except the two disputants. A joint declaration recommended by the Committee was signed by the two countries in April, and diplomatic relations were restored. The controversy smoldered for almost a year, however, until US President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] announced that plans for a new canal would be drawn up and that an entirely new treaty would be negotiated.

Negotiations were carried on throughout the first half of the presidency of [[Roberto Chiari]]'s successor, [[Marcos Aurelio Robles]]. When the terms of three draft treaties—concerning the existing lock canal, a possible sea-level canal, and defense matters—were revealed in 1967, Panamanian public reaction was adverse. The new treaties would have abolished the resented "in perpetuity" clause in favor of an expiration date of December 13, 1999, or the date of the completion of a new sea-level canal if that were earlier. Furthermore, they would have compensated the Panamanian government on the basis of tonnage shipped through the canal, an arrangement that could have increased the annuity to more than US$20 million.

The intensity of Panamanian nationalism, however, was such that many contended that the United States should abandon involvement in Panama altogether. Proposals for the continued United States military bases in the Canal Zone, for the right of the United States to deploy troops and armaments anywhere in the republic, and for a joint board of nine governors for the zone, five of which were to be appointed by the United States, were particularly unpopular. Robles initially attempted to defend the terms of the drafts. When he failed to obtain treaty ratification and he learned that his own coalition would be at a disadvantage in the upcoming elections, he declared that further negotiations would be necessary.

==The oligarchy under fire==
In the mid-1960s, the [[oligarchy]] was still tenuously in charge of Panama's political system. Members of the middle class, consisting largely of teachers and government workers, occasionally gained political prominence. Aspiring to upper-class stations, they failed to unite with the lower classes to displace the oligarchy. Students were the most vocal element of the middle class and the group most disposed to speak for the inarticulate poor; as graduates, however, they were generally coopted by the system.

A great chasm separated the rural section from the urban population of the two major cities. Only the rural wageworkers, concentrated in the provinces of [[Bocas del Toro Province|Bocas del Toro]] and [[Chiriquí Province|Chiriquí]], appeared to follow events in the capital and to express themselves on issues of national policy. Among the urban lower classes, antagonism between the Spanish speakers and the English- and French-speaking blacks inhibited organization in pursuit of common interests.

Literacy was high—about 77 percent—despite the scarcity of secondary schools in the rural areas. Voter turnout also tended to be high, despite the unreliability of vote counts. (A popular saying is "He who counts the votes elects.") Concentration on the sins of the United States had served as a safety valve, diverting attention from the injustices of the domestic system.

The [[multi-party system]] that existed until the ''[[coup d'état]]'' of 1968 served to regulate competition for political power among the leading families. Individual parties characteristically served as the personal machines of leaders, whose clients (supporters or dependents) anticipated jobs or other advantages if their candidate were successful. Of the major parties competing in the 1960s, only the highly factionalized [[National Liberal Party (Panama)|National Liberal Party]] (''Partido Liberal Nacional'', PLN) had a history of more than two decades. The only parties that had developed clearly identifiable programs were the small [[Socialist Party]] and the [[People's Party (Panama)|Christian Democratic Party]] (''Partido Demócrato Cristiano'', PDC). The only party with a mass base was the [[Panameñista Party]] (''Partido Panameñista'', PP), the electoral vehicle of the erratic former president, [[Arnulfo Arias]]. The Panameñista Party appealed to the frustrated, but lacked a clearly recognizable ideology or program.

Seven candidates competed in the 1964 presidential elections, although only three were serious contenders. Robles, who had served as minister of the presidency in Chiari's cabinet, was the candidate of the [[National Opposition Union]], comprising the PLN and seven smaller parties. After lengthy backstage maneuvers, Robles was endorsed by the outgoing president. [[Juan de Arco Galindo]], a former member of the [[National Assembly]] and [[public works]] minister and brother-in-law of former President de la Guardia, was the candidate of the [[National Opposition Alliance]] (''Alianza Nacional de Oposición'') coalition, comprising seven parties headed by the CPN. Arnulfo Arias was supported by the PP, already the largest single party in the country.

As usual, the status of the canal was a principal issue in the campaign. Both the liberal and the CPN coalitions cultivated nationalist sentiment by denouncing the United States. Arias, abandoning his earlier nationalistic theme, assumed a cooperative and conciliatory stance toward the United States. Arias attracted lower-class support by denouncing the oligarchy. The [[Electoral Tribunal]] announced that Robles had defeated Arias by a margin of more than 10,000 votes of the 317,312 votes cast. The CPN coalition trailed far behind the top two contenders. Arias supporters, who had won a majority of the National Assembly seats, attributed Robles's victory to the "miracle of [[Los Santos Province|Los Santos]]"; they claimed that enough corpses voted for Robles in that province to enable him to carry the election.

The problems confronting Robles were not unlike those of his predecessors but were aggravated by the consequences of the 1964 riots. In addition to the hardships and resentments resulting from the losses of life and property, the riots had the effect of dramatically increasing the already serious unemployment in the metropolitan areas. Despite his nationalistic rhetoric during the campaign, the new president was dependent on United States economic and technical assistance to develop projects that Chiari's government, also with United States assistance, had initiated. Chiari emphasized building schools and low-cost housing. He endorsed a limited agrarian-reform program. Like his predecessor, Robles sought to increase the efficiency of tax collection rather than raise taxes.

By 1967 the coalitions were being reshuffled in preparation for the 1968 elections. By the time Arias announced his candidacy, he had split both the coalitions that had participated in the 1964 elections and had secured the support of several factions in a coalition headed by the Panameñista Party. Robles's endorsement went to [[David Samudio]] of the PLN. A civil engineer and architect of middle-class background, Samudio had served as an assemblyman and had held several cabinet posts, including that of finance minister under Robles. In addition to the PLN, he was supported by the [[Labor and Agrarian Party]] (''Partido Laborista Agrario'', PALA) and other splinter groups. (Party labels are deceptive; the PALA, for example, had neither an agrarian base nor organized labor support.) A PDC candidate, Antonio González Revilla, also entered the race.

Because many of Arias's supporters believed that the 1964 election had been rigged, the principal issue in the 1968 campaign became the prospective validity of the election itself. The credibility crisis became acute in February 1968 when the president of the Electoral Tribunal, a Samudio supporter, closed the central registration office in a dispute with the other two members of the tribunal, Arias supporters, over electoral procedures. The government brought suit before the [[Supreme court|Supreme Court]] for their dismissal, on the grounds that each man had a son who was a candidate for elective office. Thereupon [[González Revilla]], with the backing of Arias, petitioned the National Assembly to begin impeachment proceedings against Robles for illegal interferences in electoral matters. Among other issues, Robles was accused of diverting public funds to Samudio's campaign.

The [[National Assembly]] met in special session and appointed a commission to gather evidence. Robles, in turn, obtained a judgment from a municipal court that the assembly was acting unconstitutionally. The National Assembly chose to ignore a stay order issued by the municipal court pending the reconvening of the Supreme Court on April 1, and on March 14 it voted for impeachment. On March 24, the National Assembly found Robles guilty and declared him deposed. Robles and the National Guard ignored the proceedings, maintaining that they would abide by the decision of the Supreme Court when it reconvened.

The Supreme Court, with only one dissenting vote, ruled the impeachment proceedings unconstitutional. The Electoral Tribunal subsequently ruled that thirty of the parliamentary deputies involved in the impeachment proceedings were ineligible for reelection. Robles, with the support of the National Guard, retained the presidency.

The election took place on May 12, 1968, as scheduled, and tension mounted over the succeeding eighteen days as the Election Board and the Electoral Tribunal delayed announcing the results. Finally the Election Board declared that Arias had carried the election by 175,432 votes to 133,887 for Samudio and 11,371 for González Revilla. The Electoral Tribunal, senior to the Board and still loyal to Robles, protested, but the commander of the National Guard, Brigadier General [[Bolívar Vallarino]], despite past animosity toward Arias, supported the conclusion of the Board.

Arias took office on October 1, demanding the immediate return of the Canal Zone to Panamanian jurisdiction and announcing a change in the leadership of the National Guard. He attempted to remove the two most senior officers, Vallarino and Colonel [[José María Pinilla]], and appoint Colonel [[Bolívar Urrutia]] to command the force. On October 11 the Guard, for the third time, removed Arias from the presidency. With seven of his eight ministers and twenty-four members of the National Assembly, Arias took refuge in the Canal Zone.

==The government of Torrijos and the National Guard==
The overthrow of Arias provoked student demonstrations and rioting in some of the slum areas of Panama City. The peasants in Chiriquí Province battled guardsmen sporadically for several months, but the Guard retained control. Urrutia was initially arrested but was later persuaded to join in the two-man provisional junta headed by Pinilla. Vallarino remained in retirement. The original cabinet appointed by the junta was rather broad-based and included several Samudio supporters and one Arias supporter. After the first three months, however, five civilian cabinet members resigned, accusing the new government of dictatorial practices.

The provisional junta moved swiftly to consolidate government control. Several hundred actual or potential political leaders were arrested on charges of corruption or subversion. Others went into voluntary or imposed [[exile]], and property owners were threatened with [[Confiscation|expropriation]]. The National Assembly and all political parties were disbanded, and the [[University of Panama]] was closed for several months while its faculty and student body were purged. The communications media were brought under control through censorship, intervention in management, or expropriation.

Pinilla, who assumed the title of president, had declared that his government was provisional and that free elections were to be scheduled. In January 1969, however, power actually rested in the hands of [[Omar Torrijos]] and [[Boris Martínez]], commander and chief of staff, respectively, of the Guard. In early March, a speech by Martinez promising agrarian reform and other measures radical enough to alarm landowners and entrepreneurs provoked a coup within the coup. Torrijos assumed full control, and Martinez and three of his supporters in the military government were exiled.

Torrijos stated that "there would be less impulsiveness" in government without Martinez. Torrijos did not denounce the proposed reforms, but he assured Panamanian and United States investors that their interests were not threatened.

Torrijos, now a brigadier general, became even more firmly entrenched in power after thwarting a coup attempted by Colonels [[Amado Sanjur]], [[Luis Q. Nentzen Franco]], and [[Ramiro Silvera]] in December 1969. While Torrijos was in Mexico, the three colonels declared him deposed. Torrijos rushed back to Panama, gathered supporters at the garrison in [[David]], and marched triumphantly into the capital. The colonels followed earlier competitors of Torrijos into exile. Because the governing junta (Colonel Pinilla and his deputy, Colonel Urrutia) had not opposed the abortive coup, Torrijos replaced them with two civilians, [[Demetrio B. Lakas]], an engineer well liked among businessmen, and [[Arturo Sucre]], a lawyer and former director of the national lottery. Lakas was designated "provisional president", and Sucre was appointed his deputy.

In late 1969 a close associate of Torrijos announced the formation of the [[New Panama Movement]]. This movement was originally intended to organize peasants, workers, and other social groups and was patterned after that of [[Mexico]]'s [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]]. No organizational structure was established, however, and by 1971 the idea had been abandoned. The government party was revived under a different name, the [[Democratic Revolutionary Party]] (''Partido Revolucionario Democrático'', PRD) in the late 1970s.

A sweeping cabinet reorganization and comments of high-ranking officials in 1971 portended a shift in domestic policy. Torrijos expressed admiration for the socialist trends in the military governments of [[Peru]] and [[Bolivia]]. He also established a mutually supportive relationship with [[Cuba]]'s [[Fidel Castro]]. Torrijos carefully distanced himself from the Panamanian [[Marxist]] left. The political label he appeared to wear most comfortably was "[[populism|populist]]". In 1970 he declared, "Having finished with the oligarchy, the Panamanian has his own worth with no importance to his origin, his cradle, or where he was born."

Torrijos worked on building a popular base for his government, forming an alliance among the National Guard and the various sectors of society that had been the objects of social injustice at the hands of the oligarchy, particularly the long-neglected ''[[peasant|campesinos]]''. He regularly traveled by helicopter to villages throughout the interior to hear their problems and to explain his new programs.

In addition to the National Guard and the ''campesinos'', the populist alliance that Torrijos formed as a power base included students, the [[People's Party (Panama)|People's Party]] (''Partido del Pueblo'', PdP), and portions of the working classes. Support for Torrijos varied among interest groups and over time. The alliance contained groups, most notably the Guard and students, that were traditionally antagonistic toward one another and groups that traditionally had little concern with national politics, e.g., the rural sector. Nationalism, in the form of support of the efforts of the Torrijos regime to obtain control over the canal through a new treaty with the United States, provided the glue for maintaining political consensus.

In the early 1970s, the strength of the alliance was impressive. Disloyal or potentially disloyal elements within the National Guard and student groups were purged; increased salaries, [[perquisites]], and positions of political power were offered to the loyal majority. The adherence of the middle classes was procured partly through more jobs. In return for its support, the PdP was allowed to operate openly when all other political parties were outlawed.

The Torrijos effort to secure political support in the rural sector was an innovation in Panamanian politics. With the exception of militant banana workers in the western provinces of Chiriquí and Bocas del Toro, the ''campesinos'' traditionally have had little concern with national political issues. Unlike much of Latin America, in Panama the elite is almost totally urban based, rather than being a landed aristocracy.

No elections were held under the military government until April 1970, when the town of San Miguelito, incorporated as the country's sixty-fourth municipal district, was allowed to elect a mayor, treasurer, and municipal council. Candidates nominated by trade groups and other nonpartisan bodies were elected indirectly by a council that had been elected by neighborhood councils. Subsequently, the new system was extended throughout the country, and in 1972 the 505-member [[National Assembly of Municipal Representatives]] met in Panama City to confirm Torrijos's role as head of government and to approve a [[new constitution]]. The new document greatly expanded governmental powers at the expense of civil liberties. The state also was empowered to "oversee the rational distribution of land" and, in general, to regulate or initiate economic activities. In a reference to the Canal Zone, the Constitution also declared the ceding of national territory to any foreign country to be illegal. {{Or|date=September 2010}}

The governmental initiatives in the economy, legitimated by the new Constitution, were already underway. The government had announced in early 1969 its intention to implement 1962 legislation by distributing 700,000 hectares of land within 3 years to 61,300 families. Acquisition and distribution progressed much more slowly than anticipated, however.

Nevertheless, major programs were undertaken. Primary attention and government assistance went to farmers grouped in organizations that were initially described as cooperatives but were in fact commercial farming operations by state-owned firms. The government also established companies to operate banana plantations—partly because a substantial amount of the land obtained under the land-reform laws was most suited to banana cultivation and had belonged to international fruit companies.

Educational reforms instituted by Torrijos emphasized vocational and technica training at the expense of law, liberal arts, and the humanities. The programs introduced on an experimental basis in some elementary and secondary schools resembled the [[Cuban system of "basic schools in the countryside"]]. New schools were established in rural areas in which half the student's time was devoted to instruction in farming. Agricultural methods and other practical skills were taught to urban students as well, and ultimately the new curriculum was to become obligatory even in private schools. Although the changes were being instituted gradually, they met strong resistance from the upper-middle classes and particularly from teachers.

Far-reaching reforms were also undertaken in health care. A program of integrated medical care became available to the extended family of anyone who had been employed for the minimal period required to qualify for [[social security]]. A wide range of services was available not only to the worker's spouse and children, but to parents, aunts, uncles, cousins—to any dependent relative. Whereas in the past medical facilities had been limited almost entirely to Panama City, under Torrijos hospitals were built in several provincial cities. Clinics were established throughout the countryside. Medical-school graduates were required to spend at least two years in a rural internship servicing the scattered clinics.

Torrijos also undertook an ambitious program of [[public works]]. The construction of new roads and bridges contributed particularly to greater prosperity in the rural areas. Although Torrijos showed greater interest in rural development than in urban problems, he also promoted urban housing and office construction in Panama City. These projects were funded, in part, by both increased personal and corporate taxes and increased efficiency in tax collection. The 1972 enactment of a new labor code attempted to fuse the urban working class into the populist alliance. Among other things the code provided obligatory [[collective agreements]], obligatory payroll deduction of union fees, the establishment of a superior labor tribunal, and the incorporation of some 15,000 additional workers, including street vendors and peddlers, into labor unions. At the same time, the government attempted unsuccessfully to unite the nation's three major labor confederations into a single, government-sponsored organization.

Meanwhile, Torrijos lured foreign investment by offering tax incentives and provisions for the unlimited [[repatriation of capital]]. In particular, international banking was encouraged to locate in Panama, to make the country a regional financial center. A law adopted in 1970 facilitated offshore banking. Numerous banks, largely foreign owned, were licensed to operate in Panama; some were authorized solely for external transactions. Funds borrowed abroad could be loaned to foreign borrowers without being taxed by Panama.

Most of the reforms benefiting workers and peasants were undertaken between 1971 and 1973. Economic problems beginning in 1973 led to some backtracking on social programs. A new labor law passed in 1976, for example, withdrew much of the protection provided by the 1972 labor code, including compulsory collective bargaining. The causes of these economic difficulties included such external factors as the decline in world trade, and thus canal traffic. Domestic problems included a decline in agricultural production that many analysts attributed to the failure of the economic measures of the Torrijos government. The combination of a steady decline in per capita [[gross national product]], inflation, unemployment, and massive foreign debts adversely affected all sectors of society and contributed heavily to the gradual erosion of the populist alliance that had firmly supported Torrijos in the early 1970s.

Increasingly, corruption in governing circles and within the National Guard also had become an issue in both national and international arenas. Torrijos's opponents were quick to note that his relatives appeared in large numbers on the public payroll.

==The treaty negotiations==
During the first two years after the overthrow of Arias, while the Guard consolidated its control of the government and Torrijos rooted out his competitors within the Guard, the canal issue was downplayed and generally held in abeyance. By 1971, however, the negotiation of new treaties had reemerged as the primary goal of the Torrijos regime.

In the 1970s, about 5 percent of world trade, by volume, some 20 to 30 ships daily, were passing through the canal. Tolls had been kept artificially low, averaging a little more than US$10,000 for the 8- to 10-hour passage, and thus entailing a United States government subsidy. Nevertheless, canal use was declining in the 1970s, because of alternate routes, vessels being too large to transit the canal, and the decline in world trade.

The canal, nevertheless, was clearly vital to Panama's economy. Some 30 percent of Panama's foreign trade passed through the canal. About 25 percent of the country's foreign exchange earnings and 13 percent of its GNP were associated with canal activities. The level of traffic and the revenue thereby generated were key factors in the country's economic life.

Under the 1903 treaty, the governor of the Canal Zone was appointed by the president of the United States and reported to the secretary of war. The governor also served as president of the [[Canal Zone Company]], and reported to a board of directors appointed by the secretary of war. United States jurisdiction in the zone was complete, and residence was restricted to United States government employees and their families. On the eve of the adoption of new treaties in 1977, residents of the Canal Zone included some 40,000 United States citizens, two-thirds of whom were military personnel and their dependents, and about 7,500 Panamanians. The Canal Zone was, in effect, a United States military outpost with its attendant prosperous economy, which stood in stark contrast to the poverty on the other side of its fences.

By the 1960s military activities in the zone were under the direction of the [[United States Southern Command]] (SOUTHCOM). The primary mission of SOUTHCOM was defending the canal. In addition, SOUTHCOM served as the nerve center for a wide range of military activities in Latin America, including communications, training Latin American military personnel, overseeing United States military assistance advisory groups, and conducting joint military exercises with Latin American armed forces.

Negotiations for a new set of treaties were resumed in June 1971, but little was accomplished until March 1973 when, at the urging of Panama, the [[UN Security Council]] called a special meeting in Panama City. A resolution calling on the United States to negotiate a "just and equitable" treaty was vetoed by the United States on the grounds that the disposition of the canal was a bilateral matter. Panama had succeeded, however, in dramatizing the issue and gaining international support.

The United States signaled renewed interest in the negotiations in late 1973, when Ambassador [[Ellsworth Bunker]] was dispatched to Panama as a special envoy. In early 1974, Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]] and Panamanian foreign minister [[Juan Antonio Tack]] announced their agreement on eight principles to serve as a guide in negotiating a "just and equitable treaty eliminating once and for all the causes of conflict between the two countries." The principles included recognition of Panamanian sovereignty in the Canal Zone; immediate enhancement of economic benefits to Panama; a fixed expiration date for United States control of the canal; increased Panamanian participation in the operation and defense of the canal; and continuation of United States participation in defending the canal.

American attention was distracted later in 1974 by the [[Watergate scandal]], impeachment proceedings, and ultimately the resignation of President [[Richard M. Nixon]]. Negotiations with Panama were accelerated by President [[Gerald R. Ford]] in mid-1975 but became deadlocked on four central issues: the duration of the treaty; the amount of canal revenues to go to Panama; the amount of territory United States military bases would occupy during the life of the treaty; and the United States demand for a renewable forty- or fifty-year lease of bases to defend the canal. Panama was particularly concerned with the open-ended presence of United States military bases and held that the emerging United States position retained the bitterly opposed "perpetuity" provision of the 1903 treaty and thus violated the spirit of the 1974 Kissinger-Tack principles. The sensitivity of the issue during negotiations was illustrated in September 1975 when Kissinger's public declaration that "the United States must maintain the right, unilaterally, to defend the Panama Canal for an indefinite future" provoked a furor in Panama. A group of some 600 angry students stoned the United States embassy.

Negotiations remained stalled during the United States election campaign of 1976 when the canal issue, particularly the question of how the United States could continue to guarantee its security under new treaty arrangements, became a major topic of debate. Torrijos replaced Foreign Minister Tack with [[Aquilino Boyd]] in April 1976, and early the next year Boyd was replaced by [[Nicolás González Revilla]]. [[Rómulo Escobar Bethancourt]], meanwhile, became Panama's chief negotiator. Panama's growing economic difficulties made the conclusion of a new treaty, accompanied by increased economic benefits, increasingly vital.

The new Panamanian negotiating team was thus encouraged by the high priority that President [[Jimmy Carter]] placed on rapidly concluding a new treaty. Carter added [[Sol Linowitz]], former ambassador to the OAS, to the United States negotiating team shortly after taking office in January 1977. Carter held that United States interests would be protected by possessing "an assured capacity or capability" to guarantee that the canal would remain open and neutral after Panama assumed control. This view contrasted with previous United States demands for an ongoing physical military presence and led to the negotiation of two separate treaties. This changed point of view, together with United States willingness to provide a considerable amount of bilateral development aid in addition to the revenues associated with Panama's participation in the operation of the canal, were central to the August 10, 1977 announcement that agreement had been reached on two new treaties.

[[Public library|Public libraries]] in the [[Thirteen Colonies|American Colonies]] can be traced back to 1656, when a [[Boston]] merchant named Captain [[Robert Keayne]] willed his collection of books to the town.&lt;ref name="Harris, H. M. 1999"&gt;Harris, H. M. (1999). ''History of libraries in the western world'' (4th ed.). Lanham, MD: Scarecrow Press, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Church collections of books used by the public served as early versions of libraries in [[New England]] around the 18th century.  One such example is the [[Kings Chapel]] Library in Boston, which was founded in 1698 with book donations from the [[Bishop of London]].&lt;ref name="Harris, H. M. 1999"/&gt;

Reverend [[Thomas Bray]] was instrumental in the establishment of libraries for public use.  This [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] clergyman had sponsored several parish libraries in England, and from 1695-1704 he managed to establish 70 libraries in the [[American Colonies]].  These included five provincial libraries located in the major cities of time, 39 parochial libraries at Anglican parishes, and 35 [[Lending library|layman libraries]] where ministers were allowed to loan the materials to their local residents.  Bray's provincial libraries in [[Maryland]] and [[South Carolina]] were both the beneficiaries of the first laws passed by the local legislation to secure and maintain the libraries in their provinces.&lt;ref name="Harris, H. M. 1999"/&gt;

In 1731, [[Benjamin Franklin]] and his fellow members of the [[Junto (club)|Junto]] established the [[Library Company of Philadelphia]].&lt;ref&gt;Battles, M. (2003). ''Library: an unquiet history''. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;  This type of [[subscription library]] brought access to books for the residents who paid to become a member.  It also served as a model and inspiration for many other libraries that began to spring up throughout the colonies.  Other types of libraries included [[subscription library|commercial circulating libraries]], [[Boston Athenæum|athenaeums]], and school-district libraries.  The start of the development of the American library as we know it today, however, began in full force between 1850 and 1900.

== Early history, prior to 1900 ==
In the 1600s, British colonists brought their love of books to [[United States|America]], with the deceased often leaving their collections to the public. For example, [[Robert Keayne]] left his collection to his community, Boston Town Hall, which was considered a "subscription" or "society" library.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Stuart A.P.(2009) The Library: An Illustrated History&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Top Floor Thomas Jefferson Building Library of Congress.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Library of Congress Thomas Jefferson Building| The top level of the Thomas Jefferson Building, part of the Library of Congress, Washington, DC, USA.]]The destruction of the [[Library of Congress]] by the British in the [[War of 1812]] was devastating. However, the purchase of [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s personal library, which contained materials of broader interests, influenced future public library content.&lt;ref name="Murray, Stuart A. P. 2009"&gt;Murray, Stuart A. P. (2009) The Library: An Illustrated History&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public library advocates ===
In 1833, The [[New York State]] school district raised taxes for [[public libraries]]. That same year, Reverend Abiel Abbot urged the citizens of [[Peterborough, New Hampshire]], to establish a public library, which would be free to citizens and paid for by taxes.&lt;ref name="peterboroughtownlibrary.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Peterborough Town Library|url=http://peterboroughtownlibrary.org/about/history/|website=Peterborough Town Library|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1841 in [[Boston]], French ventriloquist and philanthropist [[Alexandre Vattemare]] promoted the development of a public library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alexandre Vattemare Papers|url=http://archives.nypl.org/mss/3149|website=New York Public Library|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Library Association]] was formed in 1876 and continues to act as a fundamental entity for the continued [[Public Library Advocacy|advocacy]] and political involvement of public libraries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ala.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Women's organizations were instrumental in advocating for the importance of public libraries and shaping their role in the community.
Caroline M. Hewing, librarian and library advocate, was the first children's library associate.

Since revenue from [[property taxes]] and federal funding alone do not support [[public libraries]], [[Public Library Advocacy|advocates]] seek new ways for obtaining money, such as through private donations from [[Public Library Advocacy|library advocates]] like [[Andrew Carnegie]], whose vast donations set precedent for the vital participation of future philanthropists.&lt;ref name="Murray, Stuart A. P. 2009" /&gt;
[https://web.archive.org/web/20121012112446/http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Pages/home.aspx Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation] provide [[internet access]] and computer-related [[grants]]. However, there is much controversy involved in whether private donations can hurt the integrity of libraries.

===Public libraries emerge===
The [[Boston Public Library]] opened in 1854 thanks to the efforts of [[Edward Everett]] and [[George Ticknor]], local leading figures who wrote the Report in 1852.&lt;ref name="Harris, H. M. 1999"/&gt;  This document identified the historical importance of the written word and libraries and included passionate arguments for the necessity of a library in [[Boston]].

[[File:Town Library, Peterborough, NH.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Peterborough Town Library 1906| Peterborough Town Library, the first completely tax supported public library in the United States, 1906, Peterborough, New Hampshire.]][[Boston Public Library]], however, was not the first library supported by [[Taxation in the United States|local taxes]] and available for all citizens. The first public library supported by taxes was the Peterborough Town Library in [[Peterborough, New Hampshire]], which made books available to the public in 1833.&lt;ref name="peterboroughtownlibrary.org"/&gt; [[New Hampshire]] was one of the first to use new state laws to its advantage, which entitled local government units to levy [[tax]]es.  [[New Hampshire]] then founded the first completely tax-supported local [[public library]] in the United States under the model of "open to all and free of charge".&lt;ref name="Murray, S. A. P. 2009"&gt;Murray, S. A. P. (2009). ''The library: an illustrated history''. New York: Skyhorse Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;  This was the beginning of the modern library movement.  Civic leaders identified [[tax]]es as an excellent primary means of [[Public Library Advocacy|support for libraries]].&lt;br /&gt;
New York made the decision to open libraries to the public, supported by [[tax]] money raised by the local school districts.&lt;ref name="Murray, S. A. P. 2009" /&gt; While this concept ultimately failed, it served as a foundation for current [[public library]] system.

===Formation of library associations===
1853 was the year of the first Librarians' Convention.  It was held in New York City and attended by 80 men.&lt;ref name="ala.org"&gt;American Library Association. Retrieved September 28, 2010 from http://ala.org/ala/aboutala/missionhistory/history/index.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;  For three days, the men discussed issues critical to the institutions, such as cataloging, collection development, and communication.
&lt;br /&gt;
The [[American Library Association]] was formed out of the [[American Library Association|Convention of Librarians]] held in [[Philadelphia]] in 1876. At the first meeting, [[Melvil Dewey]] was in attendance along with 102 other men and 13 women.  It was an agreed philosophy among those present that the importance of reading contributed directly to social progress.  The aim of the [[American Library Association|Association]], in that resolution, was "to enable librarians to do their present work more easily and at less expense."&lt;ref name="ala.org"/&gt;

[[File:MelvilDewey ALA.png|thumb|right|alt=Melvil Dewey (December 10, 1851 – December 26, 1931)| Melvil Dewey (December 10, 1851 – December 26, 1931), inventor of the Dewey Decimal System and editor of the Library Journal was an advocate for public libraries.]]The same year also saw the establishment of ''[[Library Journal]]'', which was edited by [[Melvil Dewey]].  The publication is still the most respected within the profession.&lt;ref&gt;Library Journal. Retrieved October 10, 2010 from {{cite web|url=http://www.libraryjournal.com/csp/cms/sites/LJ/info/aboutus.csp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101113015350/http://www.libraryjournal.com/csp/cms/sites/LJ/info/aboutus.csp |archivedate=2010-11-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The field of library science===
[[Melvil Dewey|Dewey]] was also instrumental at the [[New York State Library]] as he developed a part of the library collection specifically for children, created the job of a librarian dedicated solely to reference materials, and spearheaded traveling libraries to serve communities without access to [[public libraries]].  Dewey stated, "that state libraries were the best agencies for supporting the development of public and school libraries."&lt;ref name="Murray, S. A. P. 2009"/&gt;

Nearly every large city could boast of a [[public library]] by the 1870s.  [[Caroline Hewins]] became the first librarian of the [[Hartford Public Library]] and was active in the [[American Library Association]].&lt;ref name="Murray, S. A. P. 2009"/&gt;  [[Caroline Hewins|Hewins]] led the way in a new era of women as librarians and a general rise in librarianship in the late 19th century and early 20th century.  [[Melvil Dewey|Dewey]] founded the [[Library science|Columbia School of Library Economy]] in New York City, which later became the New York State Library School, with the majority of the students being women.

===Philanthropy as advocacy===
[[File:Andrew Carnegie 1.png|thumb|left|Andrew Carnegie 1|Andrew Carnegie (25 November 1835 – 11 August 1919) was an American businessman, philanthropist, and major supporter of public libraries.]][[benefactor (law)|Benefactor]]s also played a large role in [[Public Library Advocacy|advocating]] for [[public libraries]] by providing money for construction.  [[Andrew Carnegie]] began his legacy in 1881 by presenting his workers in [[Pittsburgh]] with a [[Carnegie library|library]].  "I choose free libraries as the best agencies for improving the masses of the people," said Carnegie.&lt;ref name="Harris, H. M. 1999"/&gt;  2,500 [[Carnegie library|libraries]] were constructed as a result of his philanthropy.

== 1900 - 1935 ==

=== Public library advocacy and women ===

The start of the 20th century continued to see rapid growth in the establishment of [[public libraries]].  During the late 19th century, the [[General Federation of Women's Clubs|General Federation of Women's Clubs (GFWC)]] was formed.  This national organization became one of the main advocates for free public libraries in the United States.  In 1904, Mrs. Charles A. Perkins wrote, in the Federation Bulletin (the official organ of the GFWC), that "clubs had established 474 free public libraries."&lt;ref name="Watson"&gt;Watson, P.D. (July., 1994). Founding Mothers: The contribution of women's organizations to public library development in the United States. ''The Library Quarterly'', 64(3), pp. 233-269&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to start these libraries, clubwomen would advocate for various forms of legislation.  Laws were needed to enable municipalities to provide tax support to libraries.  The lobbying for this legislation created state commissions.  Clubwomen would also raise money by utilizing their own skills through bake sales, entertainments, and other small-scale fund-raising events.  Books were collected through donations or purchased from the funds earned by the clubs.&lt;ref name="Watson" /&gt;

In 1914, the executive secretary of the [[American Library Association]], G.B. Utley, stated that "fully one half the libraries in the country had been established through the influence of American women."&lt;ref name="Watson" /&gt;

=== Public library advocacy and World War I ===

During [[World War I]], the [[American Library Association]] established its [http://wikis.ala.org/professionaltips/index.php/Library_War_Service Library War Service].  Librarians expanded their services by work on the home front and overseas.  Because of the success of libraries during the war, the development of library services were encouraged and promoted for all Americans.

=== Public libraries and education ===

During the 1920s, the role of public libraries began to shift.  As [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] support for libraries expanded, the idea of promoting [[adult education]] became the focus in public libraries.  In 1924, "the report to the [[Carnegie Corporation]], ''The American Public Library and the Diffusion of Knowledge'', included the observation that 'the free public library is already an accepted and cherished figure in American intellectual life...'"&lt;ref name="McCook"/&gt;

In 1926, the ALA study, ''Libraries and Adult Education'', was published, and the Board on Library and Adult Education (later the Adult Education Board) was established.  The concept of libraries being connected with education quickly spread throughout the United States.  "During the 1920s and 1930s ALA embraced the idea of libraries as a means to provide adult educational opportunities and combined this idea with many efforts to extend library service to unserved areas."&lt;ref name="McCook"/&gt;

== 1935 - 1960 ==
In 1934, the [[American Library Association]] Executive Board developed a National Plan through its National Planning Committee. This was designed to "examine the inequity of tax-support for public libraries and sought provision of financial support so that library materials might be available throughout the nation."&lt;ref name="McCook"&gt;McCook de la Pena, Kathleen. (2004). "Introduction to Public Librarianship. New York: Neal-Schuman Publishers."&lt;/ref&gt; The National Plan was approved by the [[American Library Association]] in 1935.

The Public Library Association division of the [[American Library Association]] was founded in 1944. It was developed to enhance the development and effectiveness of public library staff and services. It is a member-driven organization that provides a diverse program of publication, advocacy, continuing education, and programming for its members and others interested in the advancement of public library service. Among the Public Library Association's priority concerns are adequate funding for public libraries and improved access to library resources.&lt;ref&gt;Public Library Association. Retrieved October 17, 2010 from http://www.ala.org/ala/mgrps/divs/pla/plaabout/plafaq/index.cfm#faq1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[American Library Association]] published "A National Plan for Public Library Service" in 1948. This proposed "a nation-wide minimum standard of service and support below which no library should fall."&lt;ref&gt;Joeckel, Carelton B., and Amy Winslow.(1948)"A National Plan for Public Library Service." Chicago: American Library Association.&lt;/ref&gt; The plan advocated for equalization of financial support, pointing out the inequalities among states in per capita spending for public libraries.

In 1945, the [[American Library Association]] opened a Washington, DC office to strengthen their ties with the Office of Education and with Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Thomis, Dennis. (1978). "A History of the American Library Association, 1876-1972." Chicago: American Library Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1947 and 1952, the [[American Library Association]] hosted a study called "Public Library Inquiry." It was multipart study "to define legitimate library activity by adapting the traditional educational purposes of libraries to new social conditions and the public's willingness to pay for such services."&lt;ref&gt;Raber, Douglas. (1997). "Librarianship and Legitimacy: The Ideology of the Public Library Inquiry." Wesport, CT: Greenwood Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Through a concerted effort by the [[American Library Association]]'s division of American Library Trustee Association, the Library Services Act was passed in 1956, currently called the [[Library Services and Technology Act]]. John E. Fogarty, worked with Senator Lister Hill to establish the LSA. The history of this effort is highlighted in James Healey's monograph: ''John E. Fogarty: Political Leadership for Library Development.'' &lt;ref&gt;Healey, James S., ''John E. Fogarty: Political Leadership for Library Development'' Metuchen, N.J.: Scarecrow Press, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; Congressman Fogerty was impressed by the pioneer work of Rhode Island state librarian, Elizabeth Myer, and went on to champion extension of library service.&lt;ref&gt;McCook, Kathleen de la Peña, ''Introduction to Public Librarianship, 2nd ed.'' Neal-Schuman, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

 Before receiving federal aid, the Library Service Act required that&lt;br /&gt; each state submit a plan for library development in underserved areas,&lt;br /&gt; especially in rural areas.&lt;ref name="McCook"/&gt;

== 1960 - 1985 ==
&lt;br /&gt;The 1960s brought about turmoil in libraries across the southern United States.  African-Americans attempted to access white libraries across the American South.  One of the most famous examples included the 1960 sit-in at [[Greenville, South Carolina]].  Eight African-American students refused to leave the Greenville Public Library and were arrested but soon released.  A mere two months later the Greenville Public Library opened as an integrated facility.&lt;ref&gt;Eby, J. (2010, July 11). "Greenville 8 Together 50 Years After Segregation." Retrieved from http://www.wyff4.com/r/24218364/detail.html&lt;/ref&gt; There was also the instance where two African-American ministers were attacked at the Anniston Public library when they attempted to integrate.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dp.la/exhibitions/exhibits/show/history-us-public-libraries/segregated-libraries/desegregation|title=A History of US Public Libraries: Desegregation|last=|first=|date=|website=Digital Public Library of America|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the deep-rooted feelings between African-Americans and Whites, most southern cities were more willing to integrate the public libraries over other public facilities.  According to Michael Fultz, "Of seventy-six southern cities with a population of fifty thousand or more in 1963, seventy-one had integrated main library facilities; sixteen of the twenty-one largest Deep South cities had integrated main libraries, although only two had integrated schools"&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgibbons, S. A. (2000). School and Public Library Relationships: Essential Ingredients in Implementing Educational Reforms and Improving Student Learning. "School Library Media Research, 3".&lt;/ref&gt;   However, the significance of [[public library]] African-American integration in this decade should not be downplayed.

As libraries began to grow, so too did the discrimination regarding who could make use of the facilities. In some places, state and local governments were in support of segregation and in 1896 the Supreme Court upheld ''Plessy v. Ferguson ''which allowed the segregation of public places. Later, around 1902 Carnegie would fund the building of a public library in Atlanta which W.E.B. DuBois would speak out against as a place where “a full third of Atlanta’s population” would not be able to visit. Although, DuBois did not change the rulings of the law, his protests would bring about funding for “colored branches to the attention of philanthropists like Carnegie.” There were other libraries open for African Americans before 1921, but the first African American library to open in Atlanta would not be until July 25, 1921. The library included many notable librarians including Annie McPheeters who developed the non-circulating “Negro History Collection.” The city, in 1949, built a second branch to accommodate the rise in population and migration to the west side. Other areas in which libraries were built for the African American community include school libraries in Memphis, Tennessee (1903), Galveston, Texas (1904), and Jacksonville, Florida (1905) The overall development of African American libraries was slow to develop. In fact, it would not be until the “Civil Rights Movement of the 1950’s and 1960’s that segregated public libraries would be challenged through coordinated, non-violent protest action” (Digital Public Library of America).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the 1970s and 1980s, [[public libraries]] began to understand the importance of working with American youth to promote education.  According to Shirley A. Fitzgibbons, "More [[public libraries]] began to offer programs and services for [[preschoolers]] at younger ages, including toddlers and babies along with parents and caretakers, in recognition of this educational role to facilitate language and literacy development of the young child.&lt;ref&gt;Fultz, M. (2006). Black Public Libraries in the South in the Era of De Jure Segregation. "Libraries and Culture,  41" (3),  337-359.&lt;/ref&gt;"   This concept has proven to be instrumental in the development of childhood literacy into the current decade.

== 1985 - present ==

In 1985 – there was a volunteer that worked in a public library that played an important role in her community by taking books every week to the elderly and handicapped people in their community.  She also took her own time to help out the elderly by helping the read tax and other forms that they needed to fill out.&lt;ref&gt;Author Unknown.

In 1986, Nancy Herman, who works for American Library Association's office for Intellectual Freedom, said that 2 different schools in Illinois was challenging [[Mark Twain|Mark Twain's]] book Huck Finn because the schools were saying that the book was racist.  The book was not banned due to the NAACP saying that the "book should not be banned, but should be explained"&lt;ref&gt;Rothenburg, Fred. "Kentucky New Era - Google News Archive Search."

In May 1988, a library in [[New Haven, Connecticut]] decided to take all of their materials that were getting really old, brittle, falling apart of even deteriorating like books, maps, manuscripts and other materials to be transferred to microfilm, so that the materials could be saved.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels, Lee A. "The News-Journal - Google News Archive Search." Google News. 26 May 1988.

March 13, 1991 – around sixty librarians and trustees got together to find ways to be able to get more funding for libraries "from the state and municipalities and to press for country aid."&lt;ref&gt;Author Unknown. "The Pittsburgh Press - Google News Archive Search." Google News. 13 Mar. 1991. Web. 01 Nov. 2010. &lt;https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gIQcAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=8mMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3141,6331901&amp;dq=history of public library advocacy timeline&amp;hl=en&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; They feel like they need more funding and support especially for the younger generation to get the skills and information that they need or get from the library.  They are also going to try to get libraries to get advocacy groups to help with funding libraries as well.

On August 31, 1995 – There is a public school library that is banning books from their classrooms because of the content of some of the books.  "The liberal advocacy group said that there were 338 attempts to remove or restrict access to a book and 169 attempts were successful.  Most of the books that were being challenged are due to the fact that they have profanity, violence or sexual scenes."&lt;ref&gt;Author Unknown.

Aug of 1998, "The [[National Multiple Sclerosis Society]] has a library that they lend library materials that they send home with postage paid return envelope.  They also have materials for people that are visually impaired."&lt;ref&gt;Author Unknown. "The Cedartown Standard - Google News Archive Search." Google News. 6 Aug. 1998.

In 2003, public libraries American bookstores are required by the Patriot Act' Section 215 to surrender to the FBI lists of books or other materials the customers has accessed.  The ALA's code Ethics says to "resist all efforts to censor library materials and to protect each library user's right to privacy and confidentiality with respect to information sought or received and resources consulted, borrowed, acquired or transmitted."&lt;ref&gt;Price, David H. "David Price: Librarians as FBI Extension Agents." CounterPunch: Tells the Facts, Names the Names. 5 Mar. 2003. Web. 01 Nov. 2010. &lt;http://www.counterpunch.org/price03062003.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; (David H. Price)

In 2005 and 2006, The American Baseball League and ALA have joined together to get fans of all "different ages to participate in their contest about online baseball trivia competition."  This competition of baseball trivia is to being awareness to "the 21st Century literacy skills such as using computers and other media and knowing how to find evaluate and use information."&lt;ref&gt;Author Unknown. "American Library Association and Major League Baseball Make Trip to World Series Possible. | Goliath Business News." Goliath: Business Knowledge On Demand. 23 May 2005.

In 2008, [[The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation|The Gates Foundation]] gave 6.9 Million dollars to help libraries that are struggling to have internet or faster internet to their patrons.  This money will be split in two by "6.1 Million going to a non-profit broadband advocacy group and the rest of the money going to ALA's office for Technology Policy."&lt;ref&gt;Chartier, David. "Gates Foundation to Help Libraries Be Better Free 'net Cafes." Ars Technica. 18 Dec. 2008. Web. 01 Nov. 2010. &lt;https://arstechnica.com/old/content/2008/12/gates-foundation-to-help-libraries-be-better-free-net-cafes.ars&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; (David Chartier)  This extra money that these businesses get from the Gates Foundation will help out tremendously with the huge increase in patrons using the libraries use of free internet access.

In 2009, Friends of Libraries U.S.A. (FOLUSA) and the Association for Library Trustees and Advocates (ALTA) join to become an expanded division of [[American Library Association|ALA]] known as [http://www.ala.org/ala/mgrps/divs/altaff/index.cfm ALTAFF], the Association of Library Trustees, Advocates, Friends and Foundations.
[[Friends of Libraries|Friends of the Library]] provide support through raising the budget of libraries by book sales and outreach.  ALTAFF continues to fight for library and user rights, tackling such issues as youth access to internet content and [[censorship]], such as with the sponsorship of [[Banned Book Week]]: Celebrating the Freedom to Read.
[[Public libraries|Public Libraries]] continue to use a variety of innovative ways to [[advertise]] and [[Public Library Advocacy|advocate]] the importance of their services for the community through Twitter, blogs, and Facebook and by offering services such as internet/wireless access to the availability of different forms of media.

In 2010, schools, filmmakers, and others are able to get the technology that they need to be able to help the people that are deaf or visually impaired and others to be able to see or hear movies, books or other materials. Just like the public libraries are able to provide some materials with other companies doing this will help people that are visually impaired or blind not to feel like they can't do anything since no other company provides the technology that they need besides libraries.  Also e-readers will have an option to have the book or material on the e-reader read out loud to the person.&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, Beverly.

'''Kōkoku''' (興国) was a [[Japanese era name|Japanese era]] of the Southern Court during the [[Nanboku-cho|Era of Northern and Southern Courts]] after [[Engen]] and before [[Shōhei]], lasting from April 1340 to December 1346.&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2005). "''Kōkoku''" in [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC&amp;pg=PA549&amp;dq=  ''Japan encyclopedia,'' p. 549;] n.b., Louis-Frédéric is pseudonym of Louis-Frédéric Nussbaum, ''see'' [http://dispatch.opac.ddb.de/DB=4.1/PPN?PPN=128842709 Deutsche Nationalbibliothek Authority File] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120524174828/http://dispatch.opac.ddb.de/DB=4.1/PPN?PPN=128842709 |date=2012-05-24 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The emperor in Kyoto was {{nihongo|[[Emperor Kōmyō]]|光明天皇|''Kōmyō-tennō''}}.&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, Isaac. (1834). ''Annales des empereurs du japon,'' pp. 294-297; Nussbaum, p. 541.&lt;/ref&gt; Go-Kōgon's [[Southern Court]] rival in Yoshino during this time-frame was {{nihongo|[[Emperor Go-Murakami]]|後村上天皇|''Go-Murakami-tennō''}}.

==Nanboku-chō overview==
[[File:Nanbokucho-capitals.svg|thumb|140px|The Imperial seats during the ''Nanboku-chō'' period were in relatively close proximity, but geographically distinct. They were conventionally identified as: {{unordered list|Northern capital : [[Kyoto]] |Southern capital : [[Yoshino, Nara|Yoshino]].}}]]
During the [[Meiji period]], an Imperial decree dated March 3, 1911 established that the legitimate reigning monarchs of this period were the direct descendants of [[Emperor Go-Daigo]] through [[Emperor Go-Murakami]], whose {{nihongo|Southern Court|南朝|''nanchō''}} had been established in exile in [[Yoshino District|Yoshino]], near Nara.&lt;ref name="concise"&gt;Thomas, Julia Adeney. (2001).

(1997). ''History and the State in Nineteenth-Century Japan.'' p. 140-147.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the end of the [[Edo period]], the militarily superior pretender-Emperors supported by the [[Ashikaga shogunate]] had been mistakenly incorporated in Imperial chronologies despite the undisputed fact that the [[Imperial Regalia of Japan|Imperial Regalia]] were not in their possession.&lt;ref name="concise"/&gt;

This illegitimate {{nihongo|[[Northern Court]]|北朝|''hokuchō''}} had been established in [[Kyoto]] by [[Ashikaga Takauji]].&lt;ref name="concise"/&gt;

At times Punt is referred to as ''Ta netjer'' (''[[wikt:tꜣ-nṯr#Egyptian|tꜣ nṯr]]''), the "Land of the God".&lt;ref&gt;Breasted, John Henry (1906–1907), Ancient Records of Egypt: Historical Documents from the Earliest Times to the Persian Conquest, collected, edited, and translated, with Commentary, p.433, vol.1&lt;/ref&gt; The exact [[Land of Punt#Location|location]] of Punt is still debated by historians. Most scholars today believe Punt was situated to the southeast of Egypt, most likely in the coastal region of modern [[Djibouti]], [[Eritrea]], northeast [[Ethiopia]], [[Somalia]], and the [[Red Sea]] littoral of [[Sudan]].&lt;ref&gt;Simson Najovits, ''Egypt, trunk of the tree, Volume 2'', (Algora Publishing: 2004), p.258.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible that the territory covered both the [[Horn of Africa]] and [[Southern Arabia]]. &lt;ref name="Meeks" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Where Is Punt? Nova. http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ancient/egypt-punt.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Puntland]], the Somali administrative region situated at the extremity of the Horn of Africa, is named in reference to the Land of Punt.&lt;ref&gt;Puntland profile, BBC News. https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-14114727&lt;/ref&gt;

==Egyptian expeditions to Punt==
The earliest recorded ancient Egyptian expedition to Punt was organized by [[Pharaoh]] [[Sahure]] of the [[Fifth Dynasty of Egypt|Fifth Dynasty]] (25th century BC). However, gold from Punt is recorded as having been in Egypt as early as the time of Pharaoh [[Khufu]] of the [[Fourth Dynasty of Egypt|Fourth Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Breasted|1906–07|p=161|Ref=none}}, vol. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, there were more expeditions to Punt in the [[Sixth Dynasty of Egypt|Sixth]], [[Eleventh Dynasty of Egypt|Eleventh]], [[Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt|Twelfth]] and [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth]] dynasties of Egypt. In the Twelfth Dynasty, trade with Punt was celebrated in popular literature in the ''[[Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor]]''.

In the reign of [[Mentuhotep III]] (11th dynasty, ca. 2000 BC), an officer named [[Hannu]] organized one or more voyages to Punt, but it is uncertain whether he personally traveled on these expeditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Breasted|1906–07|pp=427–433|Ref=none}}, vol. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Trading missions of the 12th dynasty pharaohs [[Senusret I]], [[Amenemhat II]] and [[Amenemhat IV]] had also successfully navigated their way to and from the mysterious land of Punt.&lt;ref name=p145&gt;Joyce Tyldesley, Hatchepsut: The Female Pharaoh, Penguin Books, 1996 hardback, p.145&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;El-Sayed Mahfouz: ''Amenemhat IV at Wadi Gawasis'', Bulletin de l'Institut français d'archéologie orientale A. (BIFAO) 2010, vol. 110, [165-173, 485, 491 [11 p.], {{ISBN|978-2-7247-0583-6}}, see also [http://www.refdoc.fr/Detailnotice?idarticle=54917997]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt]], [[Hatshepsut]] built a [[Red Sea]] fleet to facilitate trade between the head of the [[Gulf of Aqaba]] and points south as far as Punt to bring mortuary goods to [[Karnak]] in exchange for Nubian gold. Hatshepsut personally made the most famous ancient Egyptian expedition that sailed to Punt. During the reign of [[Hatshepsut|Queen Hatshepsut]] in the 15th century BC, ships regularly crossed the Red Sea in order to obtain [[bitumen]], copper, carved amulets, [[naptha]] and other goods transported overland and down the Dead Sea to Elat at the head of the gulf of Aqaba where they were joined with [[frankincense]] and [[myrrh]] coming north both by sea and overland along trade routes through the mountains running north along the east coast of the Red Sea.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Muhammed Abdul Nayeem, (1990).

A report of that five-ship voyage survives on [[relief]]s in Hatshepsut's mortuary [[temple]] at [[Deir el-Bahri]].&lt;ref name=p149&gt;Tyldesley, Hatchepsut, p.149&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the temple texts, Hatshepsut "maintains the fiction that her envoy" Chancellor [[Nehsi]], who is mentioned as the head of the expedition, had travelled to Punt "in order to extract tribute from the natives" who admit their allegiance to the Egyptian pharaoh.&lt;ref name="Tyldesley, Hatchepsut, p.147"&gt;Tyldesley, Hatchepsut, p.147&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, Nehsi's expedition was a simple trading mission to a land, Punt, which was by this time a well-established trading post.&lt;ref name="Tyldesley, Hatchepsut, p.147"/&gt; Moreover, Nehsi's visit to Punt was not inordinately brave since he was "accompanied by at least five shiploads of [Egyptian] marines" and greeted warmly by the chief of Punt and his immediate family.&lt;ref name=p149/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tyldesley, Hatchepsut, p.147"/&gt; The Puntites "traded not only in their own produce of incense, ebony and short-horned cattle, but [also] in goods from other African states including gold, ivory and animal skins."&lt;ref name="Tyldesley, Hatchepsut, p.147"/&gt; According to the temple reliefs, the Land of Punt was ruled at that time by King Parahu and Queen Ati.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Breasted|1906–07|pp=246–295|Ref=none}}, vol. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; This well illustrated expedition of Hatshepsut occurred in Year 9 of the female pharaoh's reign with the blessing of the god [[Amun]]:
{{quote|Said by Amen, the Lord of the Thrones of the Two Land: 'Come, come in peace my daughter, the graceful, who art in my heart, King Maatkare [ie. Hatshepsut]...I will give thee Punt, the whole of it...I will lead your soldiers by land and by water, on mysterious shores, which join the harbours of incense...They will take incense as much as they like. They will load their ships to the satisfaction of their hearts with trees of green [i.e., fresh] incense, and all the good things of the land.'&lt;ref&gt;E. Naville, The Life and Monuments of the Queen in T.M. Davis (ed.), ''the tomb of Hatshopsitu'', London: 1906. pp.28–29&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While the Egyptians "were not particularly well versed in the hazards of sea travel, and the long voyage to Punt, must have seemed something akin to a journey to the moon for present-day explorers...the rewards of [obtaining frankincense, ebony and myrrh] clearly outweighed the risks."&lt;ref name=p145/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tyldesley, Hatchepsut, p.148&lt;/ref&gt; Hatshepsut's 18th dynasty successors, such as [[Thutmose III]] and [[Amenhotep III]] also continued the Egyptian tradition of trading with Punt.&lt;ref name=145-146&gt;Tyldesley, Hatchepsut, pp.145–146&lt;/ref&gt; The trade with Punt continued into the start of the 20th dynasty before terminating prior to the end of Egypt's [[New Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=145-146/&gt; [[Papyrus Harris I]], a contemporary Egyptian document that detailed events that occurred in the reign of the early 20th dynasty king [[Ramesses III]], includes an explicit description of an Egyptian expedition's return from Punt:
{{quote|They arrived safely at the desert-country of [[Coptos]]: they moored in peace, carrying the goods they had brought. They [the goods] were loaded, in travelling overland, upon [[Donkey|asses]] and upon men, being reloaded into vessels at the harbour of Coptos. They [the goods and the Puntites] were sent forward downstream, arriving in festivity, bringing tribute into the royal presence.&lt;ref&gt;K. A. Kitchen, "Punt and how to get there", ''Orientalia'' 40 (1971), 184–207:190.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After the end of the New Kingdom period, Punt became "an unreal and fabulous land of myths and legends."&lt;ref&gt;Tyldesley, ''Hatchepsut'', p.146&lt;/ref&gt; However, Egyptians continued to compose love songs about Punt, "When I hold my love close, and her arms steal around me, I'm like a man translated to Punt, or like someone out in the reedflats, when the world suddenly bursts into flower." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mysterious Lands|last=O'Connor|first=David B|publisher=Routledge|year=2003|isbn=1844720047|location=|pages=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Ta netjer''==
[[File:Punt2.JPG|thumb|This relief depicts incense and myrrh trees obtained by Hatshepsut's expedition to Punt]]At times, the [[ancient Egyptians]] called Punt ''Ta netjer'' (''[[wikt:tꜣ-nṯr#Egyptian|tꜣ nṯr]]''), meaning "God's Land".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Breasted|1906–07|p=658|Ref=none}}, vol. II.&lt;/ref&gt; This referred to the fact that it was among the regions of the [[Solar deity|Sun God]], that is, the regions located in the direction of the sunrise, to the East of Egypt. These eastern regions' resources included products used in temples, notably incense. Older literature (and current non-mainstream literature) maintained that the label "God's Land", when interpreted as "Holy Land" or "Land of the gods/ancestors", meant that the ancient Egyptians viewed the Land of Punt as their ancestral homeland. W. M. [[Flinders Petrie]] believed that the [[Dynastic Race Theory|Dynastic Race]] came from or through Punt and that "Pan, or Punt, was a district at the south end of the Red Sea, which probably embraced both the African and Arabian shores."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/historyofegypt01petr#page/n33/mode/2up 'A history of Egypt' Vol. I, p. 13] Moreover ''The Making of Egypt'' (1939) states that the Land of Punt was "sacred to the Egyptians as the source of their race."{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, [[E. A. Wallis Budge]] stated that "Egyptian tradition of the Dynastic Period held that the aboriginal home of the Egyptians was Punt...".&lt;ref&gt;Short History of the Egyptian People, by E. A. Wallis Budge. Budge stated that "Egyptian tradition of the Dynastic Period held that the aboriginal home of the Egyptians was Punt..."&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term Ta netjer was not only applied to Punt, located southeast of Egypt, but also to regions of [[Asia]] east and northeast of Egypt, such as [[Lebanon]], which was the source of wood for temples.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Breasted|1906–07|p=451,773,820,888|Ref=none}}, vol. II.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the murals of the Hatshepsut temple at Deir el-Bahri, the King and Queen of Punt are depicted along with their retinue. Due to her unusual appearance, the Queen was sometimes hypothesized to have had advanced [[steatopygia]]&lt;ref&gt;D.W. Phillipson. 2005. African archaeology, page 81 of 389 pages&lt;/ref&gt; or [[elephantiasis]].&lt;ref name="Christenson"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Christenson|first1=Bernard|title=Queen of Punt|journal=Journal of Clinical Infectious Diseases|date=May 2006|volume=42|issue=9|page=134 |doi=10.1086/503306|url=https://academic.oup.com/cid/article-pdf/42/9/1344/900616/42-9-1344a.pdf|accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, she is now clinically recognized as having likely had the Queen of Punt syndrome, a suite of conditions that include familial [[obesity]], Launois Bensaude [[lipomatosis]], [[Dercum disease]], [[neurofibromatosis]], congenital [[lipodystrophy]], [[achondroplasia]], [[X-linked hypophosphatemia]], and [[Proteus syndrome]].&lt;ref name="Christenson"/&gt;

The majority opinion places Punt in Northeastern Africa, based on the fact that the products of Punt (as depicted in the Hatshepsut illustrations) were abundantly found in the Horn of Africa but were less common or sometimes absent in Arabia. These products included gold and aromatic resins such as [[myrrh]], [[frankincense]], and [[ebony]]; the wild animals depicted in Punt included [[giraffe]]s, [[Hamadryas baboon|baboons]], [[hippotamus]]es, and [[leopard]]s. Says Richard Pankhurst: "[Punt] has been identified with territory on both the Arabian and the Horn of Africa coasts. Consideration of the articles that the Egyptians obtained from Punt, notably gold and ivory, suggests, however, that these were primarily of African origin. ... This leads us to suppose that the term Punt probably applied more to African than Arabian territory."&lt;ref name="Shaw &amp; Nicholson, p.231"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tyldesley, Hatchepsut, p.147"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=jcpQqkHr328C&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA13,M1 | title = The Ethiopians: A history | isbn = 978-0-631-22493-8 | author1 = Pankhurst | first1 = Richard | year = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=YAnTJQWWnoAC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA145,M1 Hatshepsut's Temple at Deir El Bahari By Frederick Monderson]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dimitri Meeks disagrees with this view and points to ancient inscriptions that locate Punt in the western coast of the Arabian Peninsula, from the Gulf of Aqaba to Yemen, he has written that "Texts locating Punt beyond doubt to the south are in the minority, but they are the only ones cited in the current consensus about the location of the country. Punt, we are told by the Egyptians, is situated – in relation to the Nile Valley – both to the north, in contact with the countries of the Near East of the Mediterranean area, and also to the east or south-east, while its furthest borders are far away to the south. Only the Arabian Peninsula satisfies all these indications."&lt;ref name="Meeks"&gt;Dimitri Meeks – Chapter 4 – "Locating Punt" from the book ''Mysterious Lands''", by David B. O'Connor and Stephen Quirke.&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Land of Punt.png|alt=Location of the Land of Punt for most scholars|thumb|231x231px|Location of the Land of Punt for most scholars.]]
In 2010, a genetic study was conducted on the mummified remains of [[baboon]]s that were brought back from Punt by the ancient Egyptians. Led by a research team from the [[Egyptian Museum]] and the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]], the scientists used oxygen [[isotope]] analysis to examine hairs from two baboon mummies that had been preserved in the [[British Museum]]. One of the baboons had distorted isotopic data, so the other's oxygen isotope values were compared to those of modern-day baboon specimens from regions of interest. The researchers at first found that the mummies most closely matched modern specimens seen in [[Eritrea]] and [[Ethiopia]] as opposed to those in neighboring Somalia, with the Ethiopian specimens "basically due west from Eritrea". The team did not have the opportunity to compare the mummies with baboons in [[Yemen]]. The scientists believed that such an analysis would yield similar results since, according to them, regional isotopic maps suggest that baboons in Yemen would closely resemble those in Somalia. Professor Dominy, one of the lead researchers, concluded from this that "we think Punt is a sort of circumscribed region that includes eastern Ethiopia and all of Eritrea."&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;Owen Jarus ,{{cite web|title= Baboon mummy analysis reveals Eritrea and Ethiopia as location of land of Punt |accessdate= 26 April 2010 |work= The Independent|date= 26 April 2010 |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/history/baboon-mummy-analysis-reveals-eritrea-and-ethiopia-as-location-of-land-of-punt-1954547.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the scientists conducted a follow-up study to confirm their initial findings, and concluded that "our results reveal a high likelihood match with eastern [[Somalia]] and the Eritrea-Ethiopia corridor, suggesting that this region was the source of Papio hamadryas exported to Ancient Egypt."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=NATHANIEL J.

In June 2018, Polish archaeologists who have been conducting research in The Temple of Hatshepsut since 1961 discovered the only depiction of a secretary bird (''[[Sagittarius serpentarius]]'') known from ancient Egypt in the Bas-reliefs from the Portico of Punt that depicted the great Pharaonic expedition to the Land of Punt. The secretary bird lives only in the African open grasslands and savannah, it is listed among the birds found in [[Sudan]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Eritrea]], [[Djibouti]], and [[Somalia]], the bird is not found in Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scienceinpoland.pap.pl/en/news/news%2C29964%2Cpolish-egyptologist-discovered-secretary-bird-temple-hatshepsut.html|title=Polish Egyptologist discovered a secretary bird in the Temple of Hatshepsut|last=Zdziebłowski|first=Szymon|date=June 20, 2018|website=Science in Poland|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000s===
Hester enlisted in the U.S. Army in April 2001.

In Iraq,&lt;ref name="ArmyHesterProf" /&gt; Hester's military police squad, consisting of eight men and two women in three [[Humvee]]s, were shadowing a 30-truck supply convoy when approximately 50 insurgent fighters ambushed the convoy with [[AK-47]], [[RPK|RPK machine gun]] fire, and [[rocket propelled grenade]]s (RPG). The squad moved to the side of the road, flanking the insurgents and cutting off their escape route. Hester maneuvered her fire team through the [[kill zone]] and into a flanking position, where her squad leader, Staff Sergeant [[Timothy F. Nein]], and she assaulted a trench line with [[hand grenade]]s and [[M203 grenade launcher]] rounds. Nein and Hester assaulted and cleared two trenches.  During the 25-minute firefight, Hester killed 3 insurgents.&lt;ref name="WAPO_20050626" /&gt;

When the battle was over, 27 insurgents were dead, six were wounded, and one captured.  Sergeants Nein and Hester were both awarded the [[Silver Star]].&lt;ref name="ArmyHesterProf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WAPO_20050626"&gt;{{cite news |title=Silver Stars Affirm One Unit's Mettle |author=Steve Fainaru |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/25/AR2005062501263.html |newspaper=Washington Post |date=26 June 2005 |accessdate=27 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nein's medal was later upgraded to the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Doubler |first=Michael D. |title=The National Guard and Reserve: A Reference Handbook |series=Contemporary Military, Strategic, and Security Issues |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pNHbw5H07P4C&amp;lpg=PA135&amp;ots=vJ_8pWz_Tg&amp;dq=Nein%20upgrade%20Distinguished%20Service%20Cross&amp;pg=PA135#v=onepage&amp;q=Nein%20upgrade%20Distinguished%20Service%20Cross&amp;f=false |accessdate=27 January 2013 |year=2008 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=9780275993252 |page=135 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also awarded the Silver Star in this ambush was Specialist [[Jason Mike]], a platoon [[combat medic|medic]] who took up and simultaneously fired an [[M4 carbine]] and [[M249|M249 SAW]] light machine gun in defense of his comrades.&lt;ref name="WAPO_20050626"/&gt;

Hester later transferred to the Tennessee Army National Guard.&lt;ref name="VolState"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tnmilitary.org/VolState/2012/03/1203.pdf |title=On the Cover |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=March 2012 |work=VolState Guard |publisher=Tennessee National Guard |accessdate=27 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130425130440/http://www.tnmilitary.org/VolState/2012/03/1203.pdf |archivedate=25 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hester took a brief break from the U.S. Army in 2009, and worked as an officer for a civilian law enforcement agency in a [[Nashville, Tennessee]] suburb. However, she returned to the military a short while later, in late 2010.&lt;ref name="ArmyHesterProf"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.army.mil/women/hester.html |title=Hester |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=31 August 2012 |work=Women in the U.S. Army |publisher=United States Army |accessdate=27 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NPR2011"&gt;{{cite news |title=Silver Star Recipient A Reluctant Hero |first=Rachel |last=Martin |url=https://www.npr.org/2011/02/22/133847765/silver-star-recipient-a-reluctant-hero|newspaper=[[NPR]] |date=22 February 2011 |accessdate=23 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010s===
From 2012 to 2014, she served as an instructor at the 117th Regional Training Institute Military Police School.

The '''Long steam tricycle''' appears to be one of the earliest preserved examples of a [[steam tricycle]], built by George A. Long around 1880 and patented in 1883.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.remarkablecars.com/for-sale/steam-powered-cars/p19778-1880-long-steam-tricycle.html |title=1880 Long Steam Tricycle - Pictures |publisher=Remarkablecars.com |date=2009-06-17 |accessdate=2010-07-29 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=si&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amhistory.si.edu/onthemove/collection/object_280.html |title=America on the Move &amp;#124; Long steam tricycle |publisher=Americanhistory.si.edu |date=2008-10-24 |accessdate=2014-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One example was built, which after some years of use was dismantled and the parts dispersed.  In 1946, one John H. Bateman, with assistance from the 96-year-old Long, reassembled the machine, which is now on display at the [[Smithsonian Institution]].&lt;ref name=si/&gt; The example at the Smithsonian has been noted as the "oldest completely operable self-propelled road vehicle in the museum".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Wheels and Wheeling: The Smithsonian Cycle Collection|first1=Smith Hempstone |last1=Oliver |first2=Donald H. |last2=Berkebile|publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press|year=1953|p=49|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t99OAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004–2010, the item was displayed at [[Blackhawk Museum]] in northern California.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Arts Listings: Museums-East Bay Through May 30|newspaper=[[The Berkeley Daily Planet]]|date=May 18, 2010|url=http://www.berkeleydailyplanet.com/issue/2010-05-18/article/35361}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Automobiles de collection: Long steam tricycle|work=Les voitures anciennes et histoire des marques des véhicules |url=http://www.voitures-anciennes-collection.com/1-article.php?id_site=3852|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steering the two front wheels was accomplished via two independent tillers which would have made simultaneous steering and control of the brake levers difficult for a single individual.&lt;ref name=si/&gt;

Later he devoted himself to historical study, and he died on 14 July 1907 at [[Venice]], where he had resided for over thirty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AqM8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA199 | title=The German Historians and England: A Study in Nineteenth-Century Views| isbn=9780521080637| last1=McLelland| first1=Charles E| date=1971-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Works ==
To the series ''Geschichte der europäischen Staaten'' Brosch contributed ''[[England]] 1509–1550'' (6 vols., Gotha, 1884–1899), a continuation of the work of [[Johann Martin Lappenberg|J.M. Lappenberg]] and [[Reinhold Pauli|R. Pauli]], and ''Der Kirchenstaat'' (Gotha, 1880–1882). He gave further proof of his interest in English history by writing ''[[Lord Bolingbroke]] und die [[British Whig Party|Whigs]] und [[Tories]] seiner Zeit'' (Frankfort, 1883), and ''[[Oliver Cromwell]] und die [[puritan]]ische Revolution'' (Frankfort, 1886). He also wrote ''[[Pope Julius II|Julius II.]] und die Gründung des Kirchenstaats'' (Gotha, 1878), while one of his last pieces of work was to contribute a chapter on "The height of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] power" to vol. iii of the ''[[Cambridge Modern History]]'' (1904).

was a [[List of revived languages|revival]] in the use of [[Latin]] in original, scholarly, and scientific works between {{circa}} 1375 and {{circa}} 1900. Modern scholarly and technical [[nomenclature]], such as in zoological and botanical [[taxonomy (biology)| taxonomy]] and [[international scientific vocabulary]], draws extensively from New Latin vocabulary. In such use, New Latin is often viewed{{by whom?|date=September 2018}} as still existing and subject to [[neologism|new word formation]]. As a language for full expression in [[prose]] or [[poetry]], however, it is often{{quantify|date=September 2018}} distinguished from its successor, [[Contemporary Latin]].

==Extent==
[[Classics|Classicists]] use the term "Neo-Latin" to describe the [[Latin]] that developed in [[Renaissance]] Italy as a result of renewed interest in classical civilization in the 14th and 15th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mml.cam.ac.uk/neo-latin |title=What is Neo-Latin? |access-date=2016-10-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009191707/http://www.mml.cam.ac.uk/neo-latin |archive-date=2016-10-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neo-Latin also describes the use of the Latin language for any purpose, scientific or literary, during and after the [[Renaissance]].  The beginning of the period cannot be precisely identified; however, the spread of secular education, the acceptance of [[humanities|humanistic]] literary norms, and the wide availability of Latin texts following the invention of [[printing]], mark the transition to a new era of scholarship at the end of the 15th century. The end of the New Latin period is likewise indeterminate, but Latin as a regular vehicle of communicating ideas became rare after the first few decades of the 19th century, and by 1900 it survived primarily in [[international scientific vocabulary]] and [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]]. The term "New Latin" came into widespread use towards the end of the 1890s among [[linguistics|linguists]] and [[scientist]]s.

New Latin was, at least in its early days, an international language used throughout Catholic and Protestant Europe, as well as in the colonies of the major European powers. This area consisted of most of Europe, including [[Central Europe]] and [[Scandinavia]]; its southern border was the [[Mediterranean]] Sea, with the division more or less corresponding to the modern eastern borders of [[Finland]], the [[Baltic state]]s, [[Poland]], [[Slovakia]], [[Hungary]] and [[Croatia]].

[[Russia]]'s acquisition of [[Kiev]] in the later 17th century introduced the study of Latin to Russia. Nevertheless, the use of Latin in Orthodox eastern Europe did not reach high levels due to their strong cultural links to the cultural heritage of [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Byzantium]], as well as [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Old Church Slavonic]] languages.

Though Latin and New Latin are considered extinct (having no native speakers), large parts of their vocabulary have seeped into [[English language|English]] and several Germanic languages. In the case of English, about 60% of the lexicon can trace its origin to Latin, thus many English speakers can recognize New Latin terms with relative ease as cognates are quite common.

==History==

===Beginnings===
New Latin [[Renaissance Latin|was inaugurated]] by the triumph of the [[humanities|humanist]] reform of Latin education, led by such writers as [[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus]], [[Thomas More|More]], and [[John Colet|Colet]]. [[Medieval Latin]] had been the practical working language of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], taught throughout Europe to aspiring clerics and refined in the medieval universities.  It was a flexible language, full of neologisms and often composed without reference to the grammar or style of classical (usually pre-Christian) authors. The humanist reformers sought both to purify Latin grammar and style, and to make Latin applicable to concerns beyond the ecclesiastical, creating a body of Latin literature outside the bounds of the Church. Attempts at reforming Latin use occurred sporadically throughout the period, becoming most successful in the mid-to-late 19th century.

===Height===
[[File:Europe map 1648.PNG|right|thumb|300px|[[Europe]] in 1648]]
The Protestant Reformation (1520–1580), though it removed Latin from the liturgies of the churches of Northern Europe, may have advanced the cause of the new secular Latin. The period during and after the Reformation, coinciding with the growth of printed literature, saw the growth of an immense body of New Latin literature, on all kinds of secular as well as religious subjects.

The heyday of New Latin was its first two centuries (1500–1700), when in the continuation of the Medieval Latin tradition, it served as the [[lingua franca]] of science, education, and to some degree diplomacy in Europe. Classic works such as [[Sir Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s [[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia Mathematica]] (1687) were written in the language.  Throughout this period, Latin was a universal [[education|school]] subject, and indeed, the pre-eminent subject for [[elementary education]] in most of [[Europe]] and other places of the world that shared its culture.  All [[university|universities]] required Latin proficiency (obtained in local grammar schools) to obtain admittance as a student. Latin was an official language of Poland—recognised and widely used&lt;ref&gt;Who only knows Latin can go across the whole Poland from one side to the other one just like he was at his own home, just like he was born there. So great happiness! I wish a traveler in England could travel without knowing any other language than Latin!, Daniel Defoe, 1728&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anatol Lieven, The Baltic Revolution: Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and the Path to Independence, Yale University Press, 1994, {{ISBN|0-300-06078-5}}, Google Print, p.48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kevin O'Connor, Culture And Customs of the Baltic States, Greenwood Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0-313-33125-1}}, Google Print, p.115&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karin Friedrich et al., The Other Prussia: Royal Prussia, Poland and Liberty, 1569–1772, Cambridge University Press, 2000, {{ISBN|0-521-58335-7}}, Google Print, p.88&lt;/ref&gt; between the 9th and 18th centuries, commonly used in foreign relations and popular as a second language among some of the nobility.&lt;ref name="Friedrich" &gt;Karin Friedrich et al., ''The Other Prussia: Royal Prussia, Poland and Liberty, 1569–1772'', Cambridge University

Through most of the 17th century, Latin was also supreme as an international language of diplomatic correspondence, used in negotiations between nations and the writing of treaties, e.g. the peace treaties of [[Peace of Westphalia|Osnabrück and Münster]] (1648).  As an auxiliary language to the local vernaculars, New Latin appeared in a wide variety of documents, ecclesiastical, legal, diplomatic, academic, and scientific.  While a text written in English, French, or Spanish at this time might be understood by a significant cross section of the learned, only a Latin text could be certain of finding someone to interpret it anywhere between Lisbon and Helsinki.

As late as the 1720s, Latin was still used conversationally, and was serviceable as an international auxiliary language between people of different countries who had no other language in common.  For instance, the Hanoverian king [[George I of Great Britain]] (reigned 1714–1727), who had no command of spoken English, communicated in Latin with his Prime Minister [[Robert Walpole]],&lt;ref&gt;"Before I conclude the reign of George the First, one remarkable fact must not be omitted: As the king could not readily speak English, nor Sir Robert Walpole French, the minister was obliged to deliver his sentiments in Latin; and as neither could converse in that language with readiness and propriety, Walpole was frequently heard to say, that during the reign of the first George, he governed the kingdom by means of bad latin." {{cite book |title=Memoirs of the Life and Administration of Sir Robert Walpole, Earl of Orford|last=Coxe |first=William |year=1800 |publisher=Cadell and Davies |location=London |page=465 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rVu2kU9VQJwC&amp;pg=PA465 |accessdate=June 2, 2010}}&lt;br /&gt;"It was perhaps still more remarkable, and an instance unparalleled, that Sir Robert governed George the First in Latin, the King not speaking English, and his minister no German, nor even French. It was much talked of that Sir Robert, detecting one of the Hanoverian ministers in some trick or falsehood before the King's face, had the firmness to say to the German "Mentiris impudissime!"{{cite book |title=The Letters of Horace Walpole, Earl of Orford|last=Walpole |first=Horace |year=1842 |publisher=Lea and Blanchard |location=Philadelphia |page=70 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X_IkAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA70 |accessdate=June 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; who knew neither German nor French.

===Decline===
By about 1700, the growing movement for the use of national languages (already found earlier in literature and the [[Protestant Reformation|Protestant]] religious movement) had reached academia, and an example of the transition is Newton's writing career, which began in New Latin and ended in English (e.g. ''[[Opticks]]'', 1704). A much earlier example is Galileo c. 1600, some of whose scientific writings were in Latin, some in Italian, the latter to reach a wider audience. By contrast, while German philosopher [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] (1679–1754) popularized German as a language of scholarly instruction and research, and wrote some works in German, he continued to write primarily in Latin, so that his works could more easily reach an international audience (e.g., ''Philosophia moralis,'' 1750–53).

Likewise, in the early 18th century, [[French language|French]] replaced Latin as a diplomatic language, due to the commanding presence in Europe of the France of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]. At the same time, some (like King [[Frederick William I of Prussia]]) were dismissing Latin as a useless accomplishment, unfit for a man of practical affairs. The last international treaty to be written in Latin was the [[Treaty of Vienna (1738)|Treaty of Vienna]] in 1738; after the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] (1740–48) international diplomacy was conducted predominantly in French.

A diminishing audience combined with diminishing production of Latin texts pushed Latin into a declining spiral from which it has not recovered. As it was gradually abandoned by various fields, and as less written material appeared in it, there was less of a practical reason for anyone to bother to learn Latin; as fewer people knew Latin, there was less reason for material to be written in the language.  Latin came to be viewed as esoteric, irrelevant, and too difficult.  As languages like French, German, and English became more widely known, use of a 'difficult' auxiliary language seemed unnecessary—while the argument that Latin could expand readership beyond a single nation was fatally weakened if, in fact, Latin readers did not compose a majority of the intended audience.

As the 18th century progressed, the extensive literature in Latin being produced at the beginning slowly contracted. By 1800 Latin publications were far outnumbered, and often outclassed, by writings in the modern languages.  Latin literature lasted longest in very specific fields (e.g. botany and zoology) where it had acquired a technical character, and where a literature available only to a small number of learned individuals could remain viable. By the end of the 19th century, Latin in some instances functioned less as a language than as a code capable of concise and exact expression, as for instance in physicians' prescriptions, or in a botanist's description of a specimen.  In other fields (e.g. anatomy or law) where Latin had been widely used, it survived in technical phrases and terminology. The perpetuation of [[Ecclesiastical Latin]] in the [[Roman Catholic Church]] through the 20th century can be considered a special case of the technicalizing of Latin, and the narrowing of its use to an elite class of readers.

By 1900, creative Latin composition, for purely artistic purposes, had become rare.  Authors such as [[Arthur Rimbaud]] and [[Max Beerbohm]] wrote Latin verse, but these texts were either school exercises or occasional pieces.  The last survivals of New Latin to convey non-technical information appear in the use of Latin to cloak passages and expressions deemed too indecent (in the 19th century) to be read by children, the lower classes, or (most) women.  Such passages appear in translations of foreign texts and in works on folklore, anthropology, and psychology, e.g. [[Richard Freiherr von Krafft-Ebing|Krafft-Ebing]]'s ''[[Psychopathia Sexualis (book)|Psychopathia Sexualis]]'' (1886).

===Crisis and transformation===
{{refimprove section|date=June 2014}}

Latin as a language held a place of educational pre-eminence until the second half of the 19th century. At that point its value was increasingly questioned; in the 20th century, [[philosophy of education|educational philosophies]] such as that of [[John Dewey]] dismissed its relevance.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}  At the same time, the philological study of Latin appeared to show that the traditional methods and materials for teaching Latin were dangerously out of date and ineffective.

In secular academic use, however, New Latin declined sharply and then continuously after about 1700.  Although Latin texts continued to be written throughout the 18th and into the 19th century, their number and their scope diminished over time. By 1900, very few new texts were being created in Latin for practical purposes, and the production of Latin texts had become little more than a hobby for Latin enthusiasts.

Around the beginning of the 19th century came a renewed emphasis on the study of [[Classical Latin]] as the spoken language of the Romans of the 1st centuries BC and AD. This new emphasis, similar to that of the Humanists but based on broader linguistic, historical, and critical studies of Latin literature, led to the exclusion of Neo-Latin literature from academic studies in schools and universities (except for advanced historical language studies); to the abandonment of New Latin neologisms; and to an increasing interest in the reconstructed Classical pronunciation, which displaced the several regional pronunciations in Europe in the early 20th century.

Coincident with these changes in Latin instruction, and to some degree motivating them, came a concern about lack of Latin proficiency among students.  Latin had already lost its privileged role as the core subject of elementary instruction; and as education spread to the middle and lower classes, it tended to be dropped altogether. By the mid-20th century, even the trivial acquaintance with Latin typical of the 19th-century student was a thing of the past.

===Relics===
[[Image:Sjukhusfickur (gabbe).jpg|thumb|This [[pocket watch]] made for the medical community has Latin instructions for measuring a patient's [[pulse rate]] on its dial: ''enumeras ad XX pulsus'', "you count to 20 beats".]]
[[Ecclesiastical Latin]], the form of New Latin used in the [[Roman Catholic Church]], remained in use throughout the period and after. Until the [[Second Vatican Council]] of 1962–65 all priests were expected to have competency in it, and it was studied in Catholic schools. It is today still the official language of the Church, and all Catholic priests of the [[Latin liturgical rites]] are required by canon law to have competency in the language.&lt;ref&gt;This requirement is found under canon 249 of the 1983 Code of Canon Law. See {{cite web|title=1983 Code of Canon Law|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__PW.HTM|publisher=Libreria Editrice Vaticana|year=1983|accessdate=22 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of [[Latin Mass|Latin in the Mass]], largely abandoned through the later 20th century, has recently seen a resurgence, due in large part to [[Pope Benedict XVI]]'s [[motu proprio]] [[Summorum Pontificum]] and its use by [[traditional Catholic]] priests and their organizations.

New Latin is also the source of the [[biological]] system of [[binomial nomenclature]] and classification of living organisms devised by [[Carl Linnaeus|Carolus Linnæus]], although the rules of the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature|ICZN]] allow the construction of names that deviate considerably from historical norms. (See also [[classical compound]]s.) Another continuation is the use of Latin names for the surface features of planets and planetary satellites ([[planetary nomenclature]]), originated in the mid-17th century for [[Selenography|selenographic]] toponyms.  New Latin has also contributed a vocabulary for specialized fields such as [[anatomy]] and [[law]]; some of these words have become part of the normal, non-technical vocabulary of various European languages.

==Pronunciation==
{{further information|Latin regional pronunciation}}
{{see also|Traditional English pronunciation of Latin}}

New Latin had no single pronunciation, but a host of local variants or dialects, all distinct both from each other and from the historical pronunciation of Latin at the time of the [[Roman Republic]] and [[Roman Empire]].  As a rule, the local pronunciation of Latin used sounds identical to those of the dominant local language; the result of a concurrently evolving pronunciation in the living languages and the corresponding spoken dialects of Latin. Despite this variation, there are some common characteristics to nearly all of the dialects of New Latin, for instance:
* The use of a [[sibilant]] [[fricative]] or [[affricate]] in place of a stop for the letters ''c'' and sometimes ''g'', when preceding a front vowel.
* The use of a sibilant fricative or affricate for the letter ''t'' when not at the beginning of the first syllable and preceding an unstressed ''i'' followed by a vowel.
* The use of a labiodental fricative for most instances of the letter ''v'' (or consonantal ''u''), instead of the classical labiovelar approximant {{IPAslink|w}}.
* A tendency for medial ''s'' to be voiced to {{IPAblink|z}}, especially between vowels.
* The merger of ''æ'' and ''œ'' with ''e'', and of ''y'' with ''i''.
* The loss of the distinction between short and long vowels, with such vowel distinctions as remain being dependent upon word-stress.

The regional dialects of New Latin can be grouped into families, according to the extent to which they share common traits of pronunciation.  The major division is between Western and Eastern family of New Latin. The Western family includes most Romance-speaking regions (France, Spain, Portugal, Italy) and the British Isles; the Eastern family includes Central Europe (Germany and Poland), Eastern Europe (Russia and Ukraine) and Scandinavia (Denmark, Sweden).

The Western family is characterized, ''inter alia'', by having a front variant of the letter ''g'' before the vowels ''æ, e, i, œ, y'' and also pronouncing ''j'' in the same way (except in Italy).  In the Eastern Latin family, ''j'' is always pronounced {{IPAblink|j| j }}, and ''g'' had the same sound (usually {{IPAblink|ɡ}}) in front of both front and back vowels; exceptions developed later in some Scandinavian countries.

The following table illustrates some of the variation of New Latin consonants found in various countries of Europe, compared to the Classical Latin pronunciation of the 1st centuries BC-AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Three Pronunciations of Latin |last=Fisher |first=Michael Montgomery |year=1879 |publisher=New England Publishing Company |location=Boston |pages=10–11 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-CkTAAAAYAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Eastern Europe, the pronunciation of Latin was generally similar to that shown in the table below for German, but usually with {{IPAblink|z}} for ''z'' instead of {{IPAblink|ts}}.

==Orthography==
New Latin texts are primarily found in early printed editions, which present certain features of spelling and the use of diacritics distinct from the Latin of antiquity, medieval Latin manuscript conventions, and representations of Latin in modern printed editions.

===Characters===
In spelling, New Latin, in all but the earliest texts, distinguishes the letter ''[[u]]'' from ''[[v]]'' and ''[[i]]'' from ''[[j]]''.  In older texts printed down to c. 1630, ''v'' was used in initial position (even when it represented a vowel, e.g. in ''vt'', later printed ''ut'') and ''u'' was used elsewhere, e.g. in ''nouus'', later printed ''novus''.  By the mid-17th century, the letter ''v'' was commonly used for the consonantal sound of Roman V, which in most pronunciations of Latin in the New Latin period was {{IPA|[v]}} (and not {{IPA|[w]}}), as in ''vulnus'' "wound", ''corvus'' "crow".  Where the pronunciation remained {{IPA|[w]}}, as after ''g'', ''q'' and ''s'', the spelling ''u'' continued to be used for the consonant, e.g. in ''lingua'', ''qualis'', and ''suadeo''.

The letter ''j'' generally represented a consonantal sound (pronounced in various ways in different European countries, e.g. {{IPA|[j]}}, {{IPA|[dʒ]}}, {{IPA|[ʒ]}}, {{IPA|[x]}}).  It appeared, for instance, in ''jam'' "already" or ''jubet'' "orders" (earlier spelled ''iam'' and ''iubet'').
It was also found between vowels in the words ''ejus'', ''hujus'', ''cujus'' (earlier spelled ''eius, huius, cuius''), and pronounced as a consonant; likewise in such forms as ''major'' and ''pejor''. ''J'' was also used when the last in a sequence of two or more ''i'''s, e.g. ''radij'' (now spelled ''radii'') "rays", ''alijs'' "to others", ''iij'', the Roman numeral 3; however, ''ij'' was for the most part replaced by ''ii'' by 1700.

In common with texts in other languages using the Roman alphabet, Latin texts down to c. 1800 used the letter-form ''ſ'' (the ''[[long s]]'') for ''s'' in positions other than at the end of a word; e.g. ''ipſiſſimus''.

The digraphs ''ae'' and ''oe'' were rarely so written (except when part of a word in all capitals, e.g. in titles, chapter headings, or captions) ; instead the ligatures ''æ'' and ''œ'' were used, e.g. ''Cæsar'', ''pœna''. More rarely (and usually in 16th- to early 17th-century texts) the [[e caudata]] is found substituting for either.

===Diacritics===
{{refimprove section|date=November 2015}}
Three kinds of diacritic were in common use: the acute accent ´, the grave accent `, and the circumflex accent ˆ.  These were normally only marked on vowels (e.g. í, è, â); but see below regarding ''que''.
[[Image:RenaissanceLatinHandwriting1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Handwriting in Latin from 1595]]

The acute accent marked a stressed syllable, but was usually confined to those where the stress was not in its normal position, as determined by vowel length and syllabic weight.  In practice, it was typically found on the vowel in the syllable immediately preceding a final [[clitic]], particularly ''que'' "and", ''ve'' "or" and ''ne'', a question marker; e.g. ''idémque'' "and the same (thing)". Some printers, however, put this acute accent over the ''q'' in the enclitic ''que'', e.g. ''eorumq́ue'' "and their".  The acute accent fell out of favor by the 19th century.

The grave accent had various uses, none related to pronunciation or stress.  It was always found on the preposition ''à'' (variant of ''ab'' "by" or "from") and likewise on the preposition ''è'' (variant of ''ex'' "from" or "out of").  It might also be found on the interjection ''ò'' "O". Most frequently, it was found on the last (or only) syllable of various adverbs and conjunctions, particularly those that might be confused with prepositions or with inflected forms of nouns, verbs, or adjectives.  Examples include ''certè'' "certainly", ''verò'' "but", ''primùm'' "at first", ''pòst'' "afterwards", ''cùm'' "when", ''adeò'' "so far, so much", ''unà'' "together", ''quàm'' "than".  In some texts the grave was found over the clitics such as ''que'', in which case the acute accent did not appear before them.

The circumflex accent represented metrical length (generally not distinctively pronounced in the New Latin period) and was chiefly found over an ''a'' representing an ablative singular case, e.g. ''eâdem formâ'' "with the same shape".  It might also be used to distinguish two words otherwise spelled identically, but distinct in vowel length; e.g. ''hîc'' "here" differentiated from ''hic'' "this", ''fugêre'' "they have fled" (=''fūgērunt'') distinguished from ''fugere'' "to flee", or ''senatûs'' "of the senate" distinct from ''senatus'' "the senate".  It might also be used for vowels arising from contraction, e.g. ''nôsti'' for ''novisti'' "you know", ''imperâsse'' for ''imperavisse'' "to have commanded", or ''dî'' for ''dei'' or ''dii''.

She held the positions of chief of naval education and training (CNET) (1996–98), Deputy Assistant [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] for Military Personnel Policy (1998–2001), and director of navy staff from 2001 until the time of her retirement on October 1, 2004.  At that time, she was also the all-time senior-ranking female officer in the United States military.&lt;ref&gt;Tracey held that distinction until 14 November 2008 when [[Ann E. Dunwoody]] of the [[United States Army]] became the first woman in the history of the [[Uniformed services of the United States]] to reach four-star rank ([[General (United States)|general]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Tracey was born in [[The Bronx|The Bronx, New York]].  She graduated from the [[Academy of Mount St. Ursula High School]] in 1966 and graduated from [[The College of New Rochelle]] with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[mathematics]], completed Women's Officer Candidate School, and was commissioned as an [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]] in the U.S. Navy in 1970 in what was then known as the General Unrestricted Line officer designator (110X).&lt;ref&gt;[[List of Naval Officer Designators]]&lt;/ref&gt;  She later earned a [[master's degree]], with distinction, in [[operations research]] from the [[Naval Postgraduate School]] in [[Monterey, California]].

{{History of Turkish literature}}
Roughly speaking, the '''prose of the Ottoman Empire''' can be divided along the lines of two broad periods: early Ottoman prose, written prior to the 19th century CE and exclusively [[Non-fiction|nonfictional]] in nature; and later Ottoman prose, which extended from the mid-19th century [[Tanzimat|Tanzimat period]] of reform to the final fall of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1922, and in which prose [[fiction]] was first introduced.

==Early Ottoman prose==
Early Ottoman prose, before the 19th century CE, never developed to the extent that the contemporary Divan poetry did. A large part of the reason for this was that much prose of the time was expected to adhere to the rules of ''[[seci]]'', or [[rhymed prose]], a type of writing descended from Arabic literature (''[[saj']]'') and which prescribed that between each adjective and noun in a sentence, there must be a [[rhyme]].

Nevertheless, there was a long tradition of prose in the Ottoman Empire. This tradition was, for centuries, exclusively [[Non-fiction|nonfictional]] in nature—the [[fiction]] tradition was limited to narrative poetry. A number of such nonfictional prose genres developed:
* the ''seyahâtnâme'', or [[Travel literature|travelogue]], of which the outstanding example is the 17th-century ''[[Seyahatname|Seyahâtnâme]]'' of [[Evliya Çelebi]]
* the ''sefâretnâme'', a related genre that is a sort of travelogue of the journeys and experiences of an Ottoman [[ambassador]], and which is best exemplified by the 1718–1720 ''Paris Sefâretnâmesi'' of Yirmisekiz Mehmet Çelebi Efendi, ambassador to the court of [[Louis XV of France]]
* the ''siyâsetnâme'', a kind of political treatise describing the functionings of state and offering advice for rulers, an early Seljuk example of which is the 11th-century ''[[Siyasatnama|Siyāsatnāma]]'', written in Persian by [[Nizam al-Mulk]], [[vizier]] to the Seljuk rulers [[Alp Arslan]] and [[Malik Shah I]]
* the ''tezkire'', a collection of short [[Biography|biographies]] of notable figures, some of the most notable of which were the 16th-century ''tezkiretü'ş-şuara''s, or biographies of poets, by Latîfî and [[Aşık Çelebi]]
* the ''münşeât'', a collection of writings and letters similar to the Western tradition of ''[[belles-lettres]]''
* the ''münazara'', a collection of [[debate]]s of either a religious or a philosophical nature

'''Robert Patrick Murphy''' (born 23 May 1976) is an American economist, consultant and author. He is an economist with the [[Institute for Energy Research]] (IER) specializing in climate change&lt;ref name=IERprofile&gt;[http://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/scholars/robert-p-murphy/ Robert P.

Murphy, [https://mises.org/daily/1855 But Wouldn't Warlords Take Over?], Mises Daily, July 7, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Murphy is also noteworthy, and has been criticized by economists [[Brad DeLong]] and [[Paul Krugman]] for, repeatedly predicting that the [[quantitative easing]] practiced by the [[Federal Reserve]] in the late 2000s would create double-digit inflation and economic collapse—predictions that did not come to fruition.&lt;ref name="Reason"&gt;[https://reason.com/archives/2014/11/30/whatever-happened-to-inflation/singlepage Reason]&lt;/ref&gt; Murphy is a Christian, and has written articles expressing support for a literal interpretation of the Bible and skepticism of evolutionary theory.

==Education and affiliations==
Murphy received a BA in economics at [[Hillsdale College]] in 1998 and a Ph.D. in economics at [[New York University]] in 2003.&lt;ref name="IERprofile"/&gt; As explained by the Free Market Institute (FMI) website, "In his role as a research assistant professor with the FMI, Dr. Murphy contributes original research to the Institute's ongoing research program, ''Research on the Origins of Economic Freedom and Prosperity'', and works closely with FMI graduate research assistants on their efforts to develop original research.".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;https://www.depts.ttu.edu/freemarketinstitute/people/murphy.php&lt;/ref&gt; Before to his employment at Texas Tech University, he was a visiting Assistant Professor at Hillsdale College, a visiting scholar at New York University, a Research Analyst at Laffer Associates, and a senior Fellow with the Pacific Research Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.depts.ttu.edu/freemarketinstitute/people/murphy.php|title=Free Market Institute - Our People - Robert Murphy, Ph.D. {{!}} Free Market Institute {{!}} TTU|last=University|first=State of Texas and Texas Tech|website=www.depts.ttu.edu|access-date=2016-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;   He is a Senior Economist with the [[Institute for Energy Research]] (IER) specializing in climate change&lt;ref name="IERprofile" /&gt; and a research fellow with the [[Independent Institute]],&lt;ref name="II-profile"/&gt; He is an associated scholar at the [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]],&lt;ref name="Robert P.

Murphy has also written numerous works for lay audiences, including study guides to works of [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Murray Rothbard]].&lt;ref name="IERprofile" /&gt; Murphy is author of the 2007 book  ''[[The Politically Incorrect Guide to Capitalism]]''. Murphy's Mises Institute colleague&lt;ref&gt;[https://mises.org/faculty "Senior Fellows, Faculty Members, and Staff."] Mises.org&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gene Epstein]] wrote in ''[[Barron's Magazine]]'' that "Murphy makes a compelling case for the unfettered free market, or what his intellectual antagonists would call "[[market fundamentalism|free-market fundamentalism]]", but writes Murphy is sometimes too irreverent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Epstein |first=Gene |authorlink=Gene Epstein|title=Nine Good Reasons to Hit the Beach |work=Barron's Magazine |date=9 July 2007 |url=http://online.barrons.com/article/SB118377522237259874.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Murphy's book, ''The Politically Incorrect Guide to the Great Depression and the New Deal'', published in 2009, blamed the Depression on government policies.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond J.

===Contra Krugman===
In 2015, Murphy began ''Contra Krugman'', a weekly [[podcast]], with [[New York Times Best-Seller|New York Times Best-Selling]] author and historian [[Thomas Woods]] that critiques the [[New York Times]] columns of Nobel Prize winning economist [[Paul Krugman]].  The podcasts seek to teach economics "by uncovering and dissecting the errors of Krugman."&lt;ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;https://voicesofliberty.com/2015/09/15/paul-krugman-your-worst-nightmare-is-real-and-its-coming/&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://contrakrugman.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Erroneous inflation predictions==
Murphy has been criticized by economists [[Brad DeLong]] and [[Paul Krugman]] for predicting that the [[quantitative easing]] practiced by the [[Federal Reserve]] in the late 2000s would create hyperinflation and economic ruin—predictions that did not come to fruition.&lt;ref name="Reason"/&gt;
In 2009, Murphy discussed various economic policies of the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush]] and [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama]] administrations, which he called "incredible assaults on the private sector from the central government". He stated that the policies of [[Federal Reserve]] chairman [[Ben Bernanke]] and President Obama would lead to double-digit inflation with high unemployment and could facilitate the abandonment of the US Dollar by the end of the Obama Presidency. Murphy warned that soaring prices for gasoline and imported products sold at Wal-Mart might be blamed by Obama Administration officials on "an attack on the Dollar by foreign speculators" and used by them to replace the Dollar with the Amero or some other currency "issued by a supranational organization". Murphy urged investors to purchase an "emergency stockpile" of physical gold and silver, and predicted double-digit inflation.&lt;ref name="Killing the Currency"&gt;Robert P. Murphy, [http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/killing-the-currency/ "Killing the Currency"], [[The American Conservative]], December 10, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2009, Murphy proclaimed that the economy would be "in the toilet for a decade" and predicted "20+ percent price inflation."&lt;ref name="consultingbyrpm.com"&gt;Murphy, Robert P. (January 2, 2013). [http://consultingbyrpm.com/blog/2013/01/learning-from-brad-delong-and-paul-krugman.html "Learning from Brad DeLong and Paul Krugman."]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a series of articles on his personal website, Murphy states that he agreed to a bet that there would be a year/year increase in the seasonally adjusted [[United States Consumer Price Index|Consumer Price Index]] of over 10% by 2013, and notes that he lost the bet.&lt;ref name="consultingbyrpm.com"/&gt;

In a column criticizing economists "who stick with their ideology no matter how badly it performs in practice", [[Paul Krugman]] noted that [[University of California, Berkeley]] Professor of Economics [[J. Bradford DeLong]] had attacked Murphy for "predicting double-digit inflation for years but remain[ing] absolutely committed to his framework" despite the predictions being unfulfilled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/30/is-our-austerians-learning/ | title=Is Our Austerians Learning? | work=[[New York Times]] | date=December 30, 2012 | accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2012 Krugman again addressed Murphy's failed inflation predictions, criticizing Murphy's belief that "his failed inflation forecast is OK" because it is attributable to "huge deflationary downdraft that offset the inflationary impact of Fed expansion." Krugman wrote that if that was true, "we should be hailing Ben Bernanke for preventing a catastrophic deflation."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Krugman, [https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/31/on-not-learning-continued/?_r=0 On Not Learning, Continued], New York Times, December 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Murphy replied on his blog to Krugman and DeLong's criticisms, saying "my price inflation wager has ''nothing'' to do with Austrian business cycle theory" and that Krugman was using a "macro model" which does not apply to Austrian theory which relies on "heterogeneous capital goods" and artificially low interest rates distortion of investment flows into various sectors. He admitted he was not sure why his inflation prediction was wrong.&lt;ref&gt;[http://consultingbyrpm.com/blog/2013/01/learning-from-brad-delong-and-paul-krugman.html Learning From Brad DeLong and Paul Krugman], Robert P. Murphy blog, January 2, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In a May 2013 piece published by ''[[The American Conservative]]'', Murphy wrote about Krugman's predictions regarding fiscal austerity and the [[Budget sequestration in 2013|2013 U.S. government budget sequestration]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert P. Murphy, [http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/heads-krugman-wins-tails-austerity-loses/ Heads Krugman Wins, Tails ‘Austerity’ Loses], [[The American Conservative]], May 23, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Murphy challenged Krugman to a debate and unnamed supporters of Murphy promised to donate $100,000 to a charity if Krugman would debate Murphy on economic policy issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Carney|first=John|title=Will Paul Krugman be Shamed Into Debating an Austrian Economics Wunderkind?|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/39832879|accessdate=19 April 2013|newspaper=CNBC website|date=October 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A promotional website was established for the challenge. Krugman called the proposed debate a "public circus" and stated "Why should I dignify that totally-wrong doctrine — that doctrine that's gotten everything wrong — by giving them a platform?"&lt;ref&gt;Lehrer, Brian (June 4, 2012). [http://www.wnyc.org/story/213836-paul-krugman-weighs/ "The Brian Lehrer Show: Paul Krugman Weighs In."]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.krugmandebate.com/ Krugmandebate.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foreign policy and maintaining an empire==
In addition to opposing the [[Iraq conflict (2003–present)|War in Iraq]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mises.org/library/critique-invasion-iraq&lt;/ref&gt; Murphy has been critical of [[Neoconservatism|neoconservatives]] and their [[Interventionism (politics)|interventionist]] foreign policy views,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mises.org/library/yellow-journalism-weekly-standard&lt;/ref&gt; especially their views on economics.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mises.org/library/david-frum-neoconservative-new-dealer&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 Murphy wrote in a column, in response to [[Michael Kinsley]] on libertarianism, that "we shouldn't trust the government with military affairs after the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]]."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mises.org/library/correcting-kinsley-libertarianism&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 Murphy wrote that "if Americans want a free society at home, then they must convince the U.S. government to give up its global empire." He goes on to state that the current aggressive U.S. foreign policy has been destructive to domestic liberties and concludes that "if you allow your government to maintain an empire abroad, then you can't possibly expect a free and open society at home."&lt;ref&gt;https://original.antiwar.com/robert_murphy/2014/08/29/a-free-society-must-give-up-empire/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 Murphy made the case that "a free society will be far more defensible than a state-controlled analog, and by its very nature may avoid military conflict altogether because peaceful solutions are much more efficient."&lt;ref&gt;http://libertarianpapers.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/post/2017/09/lp-9-2-3-1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Skepticism of evolution, defense of Biblical literalism==
In two [[LewRockwell.com]] articles entitled "Well, I'll be a Monkey's Nephew" and "More Monkey Business", Murphy expressed skepticism about evolution, asserting that he "can literally prove evolution is false" by pointing out that human beings act altruistically, which (in Murphy's view) cannot be explained by evolutionary motives.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Robert P (September 20, 2003). [https://web.archive.org/web/20060220204209/http://www.lewrockwell.com/murphy/murphy75.html "Well, I'll be a Monkey's Nephew."] LewRockwell.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Robert P (November 24, 2003).

'''Sentimentalism''' is a practice of being [[Sentimentality|sentimental]], and thus tending toward basing actions and reactions upon emotions and feelings, in preference{{cn|date=May 2018}} to reason.&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;"sentimentalism, n.", ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''&lt;/ref&gt; 

As a [[Mode (literature)|literary mode]], sentimentalism has been a recurring aspect of world literature. Sentimentalism includes a variety of aspects in literature, such as sentimental poetry, the sentimental novel, and the German sentimentalist music movement, [[Sensitive style|Empfindsamkeit]]. European literary sentimentalism arose during the [[Age of Enlightenment]], partly as a response to [[Moral sense theory|sentimentalism in philosophy]]. In eighteenth-century [[England]], the [[sentimental novel]] was a major literary genre.

== Philosophical influences ==


Sentimentalism in philosophy and sentimentalism in literature are sometimes hard to distinguish.{{cn|date=March 2013}} As the philosophical arguments developed, the literature soon tried to emulate by putting the philosophical into practice through narration and characters. As a result, it is common to observe both philosophical and literary movements simultaneously.

Philosophically, sentimentalism was often contrasted to [[rationalism]]. While 18th-century rationalism corresponded itself with the development of the analytic mind as the basis for acquiring truth, sentimentalism hinged upon an intrinsic human capacity to feel and how this leads to truth. For the sentimentalist this capacity was most important in morality ([[moral sense theory]]). Sentimentalists contended that where the rationalists believed morality was founded upon analytic principles (i.e. Immanuel Kant's "Categorical Imperative") these principles could not be adequately founded in the empirical nature of humans—such as observing a sad image or expressing a strong emotion physically. Therefore, one could not obtain a sound moral theory. However, by developing the moral sensibility and fine tuning the capacity to feel, a person could access a sound moral theory by building from an intrinsic human nature, which each person possessed. Sentimentalists were, thus, often seen as relating to the schools of humanism and empirical ethical intuitionism.

== Characteristics ==


Sentimentalism asserted that over-shown feeling was not a weakness but rather showed one to be a moral person.  Arising from religiously motivated empathy, it expanded to the other perceptions - for example, sensual love was no longer understood as a destructive passion ([[vanity|Vanitas]]) but rather as a basis of social institutions, as it was for [[Antoine Houdar de la Motte]].  Requited love was, as in serious opera (the [[Tragédie en musique]] or [[Opera seria]]), a symbol for a successful alliance between nations.  The "[[Lesesucht]]" re-evaluated what was permitted literature, and the novel as a type of literature as versus drama.  

Around the middle of the century, sentimentalism set "untouched" nature against (courtly) civilization, as in the works of [[Jean Jacques Rousseau]].  In addition, [[Samuel Richardson]]'s sentimental [[epistolary novel]] "[[Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded]]" (1740) had great literary influence.

The literary work often featured scenes of distress and tenderness, and the plot was arranged to advance emotions rather than action. The result was a valorization of "fine feeling," displaying the characters as a model for refined, moral and emotional effect. Sentimentalism in literature was also often used as a medium through which authors could promote their own agendas—imploring readers to empathize with the problems they are dealing with in their books.

For example, in Laurence Sterne's novel, ''[[A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy]]'', the narrator is using the sentimental character Yorick as a device to critique the obligation of morality, whether it is sentimental or rational.  
There is a scene early in the novel where Yorick meets a monk and refuses "to give him a single sous [a penny]." He feels discontent when he disregards what he senses he ought to do, even though he appears to obey "better reason" (4). Rationally, he disregards his sentimental obligation because "there is no regular reasoning upon the ebbs and flows of our humours" (6) [i.e. our emotions]. While he argues against the authority of sense, ultimately this sense creates discontent in his conscience. After the monk leaves empty handed, it is Yorick's "heart" that "smote [him] the moment [the monk] shut the door" (7). Accordingly, Yorick has "behaved very ill" (7). He has complied with his rational maxim, the justified action of his "great claims" argument (6). Yet he senses from the conscience of his sentimental nature that he has done wrong.

== ''Empfindsamkeit'' ==

In continental Europe, one aspect of sentimentalism was ''Empfindsamkeit''. The [[sensitive style]] (German: ''empfindsamer Stil'') of music, developed in Germany, aimed to express "true and natural" feelings, in contrast to the [[Baroque music|baroque]].

The origin of sentimentalism in this context was chiefly religious, with the emotionally coloured texts for the [[oratorio]]s of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] stream being typical examples.  Empfindsamkeit is also known as secularized [[pietism]] because it frequently came with moralizing content that had increasingly broken free of church and religious ties.  An important theorist of the movement was [[Jean Baptiste Dubos]].

===In Germany===
The musician and publisher [[Johann Christoph Bode]] translated [[Laurence Sterne]]'s novel, ''A sentimental Journey Through France and Italy'', into German in 1768 under the title ''Yoriks empfindsame Reise'' - the translation was a great success.  His word "empfindsam" or "sensitive" was a [[neologism]] that then became attached to [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]] and the whole literary period.

German poets who verged on sentimentalism were [[Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock]] (1724–1803), [[Christian Fürchtegott Gellert]] (1715–1769) and [[Sophie de La Roche]] (1730–1807, the author of the first [[epistolary novel]] in German) and its influence may also be seen in [[Goethe]]'s early work ''[[Die Leiden des jungen Werthers]]'' (1774), a high-point of [[Sturm und Drang]].

===Results===
Religious sentimentalism has often been considered as inspiration for [[François-René de Chateaubriand]] and his creation of [[Romanticism]], which was another literary genre that emerged late in the 18th Century. In popular literature, Empfindsamkeit was a common genre that continued into the 19th Century, and was found in serialised novels in periodicals such as ''[[Die Gartenlaube|Gartenlaube]]''.  In a theatre sense, Empfindsamkeit was succeeded by [[melodrama|rührstück]] or melodrama.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2796">'''Simon Janashia''' ({{lang-ka|სიმონ ჯანაშია}}; July 13, 1900 – November 5, 1947) was a [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] historian and public figure. He was a professor of history and one of the founding members of the [[Georgian Academy of Sciences]].

Janashia was born in 1900, in [[Makvaneti]] in the southwestern Georgian province of [[Guria]]. His father, Nikoloz Janashia (1872-1918), was an educator and ethnographer, born in [[Abkhazia]]. In 1922, Simon Janashia graduated from the [[Tbilisi State University]]. From 1924 to 1947, he served as a lecturer (1924-1930), Associate Professor (1930-1935) and Professor (1935-1947) there. In 1941, he was one of the founders of the [[Georgian Academy of Sciences]] (GAS), and from 1941 to 1947, he was Vice-President of the Academy and Director of the Institute of History of the GAS. In 1943, Janashia was elected as a member of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union (now the [[Russian Academy of Science]]). In the 1940s, he organized archaeological excavations in [[Mtskheta]] and [[Armazi]] in eastern Georgia.

Janashia's main fields of his research were the [[ethnogenesis]] of the Georgians and other [[Peoples of the Caucasus|Caucasian peoples]], the history of [[feudalism in Georgia]] and the Caucasus, the history and archaeology of ancient Georgia, the history of [[Colchis]] and [[Caucasian Iberia]], the history of [[Christianity in Georgia (country)|Christianity in Georgia]], and source studies of the history of Georgia and the Caucasus. He was an author of more than 100 scholarly works, including about 10 monographs. A full collection of Janashia's works was published in four volumes in Tbilisi between 1949 and 1968. Simon Janashia died in Tbilisi in 1947.

The Strabane Ambush was a British [[Special Air Service|SAS]] ambush against a three man [[Provisional IRA]] (PIRA or IRA) [[active service unit|unit]]. All members of the PIRA unit were killed in the ambush. &lt;ref&gt;Neville, Leigh (2016) ''The SAS 1983 - 2014'' Bloomsbury Publishing, p.15. {{ISBN|1472814053}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[Strabane]] was one the IRA's most deadly strong holds during [[The Troubles]]. Provisional IRA and [[Irish National Liberation Army]] Volunteers in Strabane carried out attack after attack against the [[British Armed Forces|British security forces]], between 1971 and 1991 no fewer than 16 attacks were launched by Irish Republicans against British troops and RUC police which resulted in the death of at least one member of the British security forces in each of those attacks, the British Army and RUC bases in Strabane were constantly attacked with sniper fire, bombings, grenades, mortar attacks and RPG attacks. Strabane was once the most bombed town in Europe in proportion to its size, and was the most bombed town in [[Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref name="communities-ni"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.communities-ni.gov.uk/sites/default/files/publications/dsd/strabane-town-centre-baseline-report.PDF|date=8 September 2010|title=Strabane town centre baseline report &amp;#124; Strabane Town Centre Regeneration Masterplan |accessdate=6 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.channel4.com/news/gay-bar-lgbt-strabane-the-central-northern-ireland-video|title=How one gay bar changed attitudes in rural N Ireland|work=Channel 4 News|access-date=2018-11-08|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few weeks earlier in December 1984 the SAS carried out two infamous ambushes against the [[Provisional IRA Derry Brigade]] which killed four IRA volunteers, in the first in the [[Kesh ambush]] [[Kieran Fleming]] and another IRA volunteer was killed, four days later Kieran's cousin [[William Fleming (Irish republican)|William Fleming]] and Danny Doherty were killed in another ambush.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite web | title = British Troops Ambush And Kill 2 I.R.A.

'''''Tantara ny Andriana eto Madagasikara''''' (''History of the Nobles in Madagascar'') is a book of the [[oral history]] of the [[Kingdom of Imerina]] in [[Madagascar]], gathered and published by Father François Callet between 1878 and 1881. This collection of oral tradition about the history of the Merina Dynasty was originally written in Malagasy and published between 1878 and 1881. Callet summarized and translated it in French under the title ''Tantara ny Andriana (Histoire des rois)'' in 1908.

Much of what is known about the [[List of Malagasy monarchs|sovereigns]] of the Kingdom of Imerina comes from Father François Callet's book.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5091">'''The Information Age: Economy, Society and Culture''' is a trilogy of books by sociologist [[Manuel Castells]]: ''The Rise of the Network Society'' (1996), ''The Power of Identity'' (1997), and ''End of Millennium'' (1998). The second edition was heavily revised; volume one is 40 per cent different from the first edition.&lt;ref&gt;Castells, Manuel; Ince, Martin. Conversations with Manuel Castells. Oxford, Polity Press (2003), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
''The Information Age'' is an account of the role of information in contemporary society.&lt;ref name="Webster pp.98-99"&gt;Webster, Frank. 2002. Theories of the information society. Abingdon: Routledge. pp.98-99&lt;/ref&gt; Manuel Castells describes the shift from an industrial society to an informational society, which started in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Castells"&gt;Castells, M., 2010. The Information Age: Economy, Society and Culture Volume 1: The Rise of the Network Society. 2nd ed. Oxford: Wiley Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; This Network Society is structured around networks instead of individual actors, and works through a constant flow of information through technology.&lt;ref name="Castells"/&gt; Castells emphasises the interrelationship  of social, economic and political features of society, and argues that the 'network' is the defining feature that marks our current epoch.&lt;ref name="webster pp.99-101"&gt;Webster, 2002. pp.99-101&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Rise of the Network Society==
In this volume Castells analyses the structural changes to the global economy that took place from the 1970s to 1990s. He describes the 'new economy', which he claims is based on 'a new mode of development, informationalism, of which networking is a critical attribute'.&lt;ref&gt;Castells, M., 2010. The Information Age: Economy, Society and Culture Volume 1: The Rise of the Network Society. 2nd ed. Oxford: Wiley Blackwell. p.162&lt;/ref&gt; In this new 'Informational Economy' a firm's competitiveness is dependent on its knowledge of technology, information, and access to networks.&lt;ref name="Castells"/&gt; The new economy is defined by a 'transformation of work and employment'. This concept implies that there is higher unemployment in countries where technology is scarce.&lt;ref name="Castells"/&gt; The uneven development of new technology leads to 'social polarization and social exclusion'. This concept describes an increase in equality across nations due to globalization and an uneven distribution of technology, and thus networking opportunities and lower competitiveness.&lt;ref name="Castells"/&gt;

This transition to an informational mode of development is enabled by the growth of information technology and changes in [[organizational structure]] based on networks. Castells examines statistical evidence of changes in work structure and labour patterns, and concludes that while the networked 'symbolic analyst' (or [[knowledge worker]]) may seek work globally, we cannot say that there is a true global labour force since the majority of workers are still geographically confined and immobile. Informationalism has not led to mass joblessness, but it has led to a structural change in the work force, that of instability: in highly developed countries, a majority of workers no longer have a traditional work pattern, but part-time and temporary employment has become the norm.

Castells then discusses new media and communication technologies based around networks, arguing that they are contributing to a fundamental change in culture. The new development is a 'culture of real virtuality', which describes a culture that is organized around electronic media.&lt;ref name="Castells"/&gt;  He says that 'the ''[[space of flows]]'' and ''timeless time'' are the material foundations of a new culture',&lt;ref&gt;Castells, M., 2010. The Information Age: Economy, Society and Culture Volume 1: The Rise of the Network Society. 2nd ed. Oxford: Wiley Blackwell. p.406.&lt;/ref&gt; that of the [[network society]]. The concept of 'timeless time' refers to the collapsing of time in global informational networks, for example automated financial transactions.

{{other people||Thomas Gordon (disambiguation)}}
[[File:Thomas Gordon.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Thomas Gordon.]]
[[Major-General]] '''Thomas Gordon''' (1788 – 20 April 1841) was a British army officer and historian. He is remembered for his role in the [[Greek War of Independence]] in the 1820s and 1830s and his ''History'' of the war published in 1833.

== Early career ==

He was born at [[Cairness House]] to Charles Gordon of Buthlaw and Cairness in Lonmay, [[Aberdeenshire]] and his wife Christian, née Forbes of Ballogie. He was educated at [[Eton College]] and [[Brasenose College]], [[Oxford]].

From 1808 to 1810 he served in the [[Scots Greys]]. In May 1810 he left service in the [[British Army]] for travel and on 26 August was well received in [[Ioannina]] by [[Ali Pasha of Ioannina|Ali Pasha]], local governor for the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Between 1810 and 1812, his travels included [[Athens]], [[Constantinople]], [[Thessaloniki]] as well as parts of [[Anatolia]], [[Persia]] and [[Barbary]].

In 1813, he served as a [[Captain (land)|captain]] on the staff of the [[Military history of Imperial Russia|Russian Army]], and in November 1813 was in the army of [[Ludwig von Wallmoden-Gimborn|Count von Walmoden]] at Pretzer in [[Mecklenburg]]. Early in 1814, he returned to his seat of [[Cairness House]] until 1815 when he went abroad again to Constantinople, where he married Barbara Kana (afterwards [[Baron]]ess de Sedaiges).

== Military service in Greece during the 1820s ==
Gordon returned to [[Greece]] in 1821 at the commencement of the [[Greek War of Independence]]. He served through the campaign of 1821 in the [[Morea]] in the [[Peloponnese]] as ''chef d’état major'' under [[Demetrios Ypsilantis]]. He took part in the siege of [[Tripolitza]]. After the capture, he strongly protested against the massacre by the Greeks of several thousand Turks there. On being ignored, he retired for a time from service.

In November 1822, the provisional Greek government at [[Ermioni|Hermione]] sent a letter asking him to return to them. He declined but joined the Greek committee in [[London]] (formed 8 March 1823) and contributed money and military supplies. He refused the committee’s invitation to go to Greece as one of three commissioners in charge of stores and funds stating that the Greeks were unwilling to submit to European discipline. As a committee member, he strongly supported the appointment of [[George Byron, 6th Baron Byron]].

Early in 1824, a Greek deputation raised a loan in London and again unsuccessfully asked Gordon to return. In 1826, renewed representations from Greece and the Greek deputies in London persuaded him to return to promote unity and military discipline. He reached [[Nafplion]] in May 1826 and found that bitter dissentions among the Greeks had quenched even their animosity against the Turks. He was well received and arrived in time to prevent the disbanding of the regular corps.

Towards the end of June, [[Central Greece|Rumeliots]] forced the government to seize $10,000 from Gordon to give to the [[Suliotes|Suliot]] ''Kapetanioi'' from [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]]. By the end of 1826, Gordon had spent all the public funds which the Greek deputies in London had entrusted to him.

In 1827, Gordon accepted the command of the expedition to [[Piraeus]], with the rank of [[brigadier]], his troops consisting of the corps of [[Ioannis Notaras]], that of [[Ioannis Makrygiannis]], the regulars, and the foreign volunteers. His aim was to relieve Athens, which was being blockaded. Gordon successfully landed his troops at [[Faliro]] “under the nose of [[Reşid Mehmed Pasha|Reshid Pasha]]”.

Having found that the Greeks besieged in the [[Acropolis]] were still able to hold out, Gordon wished to resign and only continued on condition of receiving supplies and being “entirely master of his own operations”. He remained in command of the troops at Faliro until the arrival in April of General [[Richard Church (general)|Richard Church]], who took over the supreme command.

On 16 April 1827, Church appointed Gordon [[director-general]] of the army. He probably continued to serve in this capacity until the Greek defeat of 6 May. Nevertheless, continued resistance, the success of the [[Battle of Navarino]], and the backing of [[Bourbon Restoration|France]], the [[Russian Empire]] and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] enabled the [[Kingdom of Greece]] to emerge with a northern frontier from [[Arta, Greece|Arta]] to [[Volos]], but without [[Crete]] or [[Samos Island|Samos]]. In July 1827, Gordon returned to [[Scotland]].

== Archaeological and historical interests in Greece ==

Gordon returned to Greece in 1828. While at [[Argos]] from 1828 to 1831 with his secretary James Robertson and the historian [[George Finlay]], he worked on the site of the ruined [[Heraion of Argos|Heraeum]] near [[Argos]]. Archaeological plans also included a proposal to form a joint stock company for the purchase of [[Epidaurus]]. Finlay also suggested that he might be president of the Greek national assembly, but Gordon had no such ambitions.

While at Argos, Gordon collected both written and oral material for a history of the Greek revolution. He also built a magnificent mansion which was modelled on [[Cairness House]] although smaller. He returned to Cairness in 1831 and completed his book in 1833. It was acclaimed for its detail and accuracy.

== Last military role in Greece ==
With the arrival of [[Otto of Greece|Prince Otto of Wittelsbach]] as the new [[List of Kings of Greece|King of Greece]], Gordon returned to Greece in 1833 and was commissioned [[colonel]] in the [[Hellenic Army]]. His campaigns that year included rooting out brigands in [[Aetolia]] and [[Acarnania]], who were supported by Turks across the border. Gordon spoke the [[Turkish language]] fluently, to the astonishment of local pashas, and this was of considerable value in negotiations. He was also appointed the president of the military court set up to try the rebels in the [[Messenian]] disturbances.

Due to poor health, Gordon resigned his commission in February 1839 and returned to Cairness, although he made another short visit to Greece in 1840.

== Death and controversy ==

Gordon died at Cairness and was survived by his wife. He had no issue with her and in his will left most of his estate, including a large landholding in [[Jamaica]], to an illegitimate son called Charles Wilkinson, who later took the surname Gordon. His existence seems to have been a secret from the rest of the family as he had been brought up by a tutor in [[Elgin, Moray|Elgin]]. The inheritance caused much scandal and led to a long period of litigation within the family. Thomas Gordon’s historical library and manuscripts were sold in March 1850, and his antiquities in the following June, although some items remained at Cairness House until 1938, after the last of the Gordons sold the estate.

== Honours ==

Gordon was awarded various honours, including being made Grand Commander of the [[Order of the Redeemer]] by the Greeks on his retirement.
He was a member of many learned societies including the [[Royal Society]] (1821), the [[Society of Antiquaries of Scotland]] (1828), and the [[Royal Asiatic Society]] (1834), and in Greece the Society for Natural History (1837) and the Archaeological Society (1840).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1780">A '''tree throw''' or '''tree hole''' is a bowl-shaped cavity or depression created in the [[subsoil]] by a [[tree]]. 

They are formed either by the long term presence and growth of tree roots or when a large tree is blown over or has its stump pulled out which tears out a quantity of soil along with the roots. The resultant hole will often slowly fill with organic material and can be identified during [[archaeological]] fieldwork.&lt;ref&gt;Darvill, T (ed.) (2003).

Fresh tree throws also provide a degree of shelter amongst the roots for animals. Some also contain evidence of prehistoric human activity such as flint tools suggesting that they were sometimes used by people in the distant past.

Tree throws expose [[humus]]-poor, [[mineral]]-rich soil. Over time the hole will fill with rain water, fallen leaves, animal excrement and other organic matter which over time becomes a habitat for decomposers which soon form a community on the thick [[organic material|organic]] layer and so are able to nurture certain types of organisms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://coweeta.uga.edu/publications/1394.pdf Clinton, Barton D.; Baker, Corey R. 2000.

Pits from tree throws, together with mounds from decaying fallen trees, are part of the characteristic topography of [[old growth forest]].

These are some of the key weapons of the [[Falklands War]] used by both sides.

==Anti-ship missiles==
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Exocet imapct.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Two frames from a high speed camera of an Exocet missile hitting a ship.]] --&gt;
The '''Exocet''' is probably the most famous weapon of the war, sinking two British ships and damaging a third. Operated by both sides the missile was used by the [[Argentine Navy]] either air launched from [[Dassault Super Étendard]] jets and from an improvised land launcher.
::''See main article [[Exocet]]''.
The '''Sea Skua''' was a British light anti-ship missile, fired from [[Westland Lynx|Lynx]] helicopters, its warhead is only 20&amp;nbsp;kg compared with the Exocet's 165&amp;nbsp;kg. However, hits from three Sea Skua missiles badly damaged the Argentine [[ARA Alferez Sobral]]. 
::''See main article [[Sea Skua]]''.
The '''AS.12''' was a French built light anti-ship missile, fired from [[Westland Wasp]] helicopters. Like the Sea Skua, its small 28&amp;nbsp;kg warhead meant that it could not destroy ships outright; however, it could disable smaller vessels. On 25 April 1982 it contributed towards damaging and disabling the Argentine [[Submarine]] the [[ARA Santa Fe (S-21)|ARA Santa Fe]]. A total of nine missiles were fired at the submarine trapped on the surface by anti-submarine torpedoes circling just under the hull. Of the missiles fired four hit, four missed and one failed to launch. Two of the missiles that hit the target failed to detonate on impact, instead punching a hole through the slender conning tower and exploding on the far side.
::''See main article [[AS.12]]''.

==Surface-to-air missiles==
'''[[Sea Dart missile|Sea Dart]]''' was the British naval medium-range [[surface-to-air missile]]. It proved unable to engage low-altitude targets, such as Argentine [[A4 Skyhawk]] aircraft and Exocet missiles. However, it did achieve several long-range kills.

'''[[Sea Wolf missile|Sea Wolf]]''' is a British naval short-range low-altitude surface-to-air missile, used to complement the longer-range Sea Dart. It proved capable of engaging low-flying aircraft.

'''[[Rapier missile|Rapier]]''' is a British surface-to-air missile developed for the British Army to replace their towed [[Bofors 40 mm gun|Bofors 40/L70]] anti-aircraft guns. Though not particularly effective in terms of number of 'kills' – its presence acted as a deterrent, especially after the deployment of Blind Fire systems around Port San Carlos.

'''[[Sea Cat missile|Seacat]]''' and '''Tigercat''' surface-to-air missiles were obsolete by the Falklands War; however, they were used by both sides during the conflict. The optically guided missiles were not effective; no kills can be attributed to the missiles. However, they were able to be used in [[San Carlos Water]], where radar-based systems like Sea Dart and Sea Wolf could not operate. Argentine land forces had a total of 7 Tigercat missile launchers (Ex RAF); there were several near misses, and possibly one [[BAE Sea Harrier|Sea Harrier]] had its engine damaged by shrapnel from one of the missiles.

'''[[Sea Slug missile|Sea Slug]]''', a long range, high altitude anti-aircraft missile system of the 1950s, was not used against aircraft but for bombardment of positions near Port Stanley by the Royal Navy ships equipped with it.

The '''[[Blowpipe missile|Blowpipe]]''' missile is a British built man-portable surface-to-air missile used by both sides during the conflict. It performed poorly; official British reports attributed nine kills to the missile out of 95 fired. However, independent research suggests that only a single kill can be attributed to the British use of the missile, an [[Aermacchi MB-339]] that was shot down at [[Goose Green]] on 28 May 1982. Argentine forces shot down a [[Hawker Siddeley Harrier|Harrier GR3]] on 21 May, probably with a Blowpipe missile fired by Primer Teniente S Fernandez of Commando Company 601 over Port Howard. The system's overall lack of success was probably due to the amount of operator input required to successfully hit a target.

British SAS special forces had acquired 6 American-made '''[[FIM-92 Stinger|Stinger]]''' missiles; however, the soldier trained to use the missile was killed in a helicopter crash. By luck the first missile fired managed to bring down a [[FMA IA 58 Pucará|Pucará]] on 21 May; however, the lack of training meant that a further five missiles fired that day did not hit their targets.

Argentine forces used Soviet-made '''[[SA-7 Grail]]''' man portable missiles.

[[Image:Xmim-115a.jpg|right|thumb|150px|A Roland missile being launched during American tests on the system]]
'''[[Roland (air defence)|Roland]]''' was a European short-range surface-to-air missile. Argentine forces deployed a single launcher to defend Stanley airport; it succeeded in shooting down one Sea Harrier (''XZ456'') on 1 June 1982 above 10,000 feet (3000 m). The presence of the launcher forced British aircraft to operate above its envelope – typically at 18,000 feet (5,500 m) which severely reduced the accuracy of bombs dropped on the airport. The single Roland unit was later shipped back to Britain for analysis and testing.

==Anti-aircraft guns==
Argentine forces deployed a substantial number of [[anti-aircraft gun]]s around [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]] and Goose Green airfields. These included some 15 [[Rheinmetall 20 mm]]/75 anti-aircraft guns, approximately 20 Hispania Suiza 30&amp;nbsp;mm guns, 15 '''[[Oerlikon 35 mm twin cannon|Oerlikon GDF-002 35 mm twin cannons]]''' with 6 Skyguard fire control radars, as well as one older Super Fledermaus fire control system. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britains-smallwars.com/Falklands/Argentineweapons.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aircraft and weapons==

::{{See also|Argentine air forces in the Falklands War|British air services in the Falklands War}}

The '''[[AIM-9 Sidewinder]]''' in its L form was the Harrier's air-to-air missile. It claimed 20 Argentine aircraft.

By comparison, the FAA had the French '''[[Matra R530]]''' missile

==Artillery and armour==

British forces were equipped with the 105&amp;nbsp;mm '''[[L118 light gun]]''' as their main artillery and the '''[[FV107 Scimitar|Scimitar]]''' and '''[[Scorpion tank|Scorpion]]''' armoured reconnaissance vehicles.

The [[Argentine Marines]] used [[LVTP-7]] and [[LARC-5]] vehicles in their initial amphibious assault with all of them returning to the mainland shortly after. During the subsequent reinforcement of the islands defences, the Argentine Army deployed two artillery groups with [[OTO Melara Mod 56]] 105&amp;nbsp;mm guns and later airlifted four [[CITER 155mm L33 Gun|CITER L33 Gun]]s 155&amp;nbsp;mm in order to repel the British naval gun fire. Twelve  [[Panhard AML|Panhard AML-90]] wheel vehicles were also stationed within Stanley.

Amongst the audience, seated at the far left, are Wieland and Herder, while Goethe stands before the pillar, at right.]]

'''Weimar Classicism''' ({{lang-de|Weimarer Klassik}}) was a German [[literary movement|literary]] and [[cultural movement]], whose practitioners established a new [[humanism]], from the synthesis of ideas from [[Romanticism]], [[Classicism]], and the [[Age of Enlightenment]].

The ''Weimarer Klassik'' movement lasted thirty-three years, from 1772 until 1805, and involved intellectuals such as [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]], [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], [[Friedrich Schiller]], and [[Christoph Martin Wieland]]; and then was concentrated upon Goethe and Schiller during the period 1788–1805.

== Development ==

=== Background ===
The [[Age of Enlightenment|German Enlightenment]], called "[[Neoclassicism|neo-classical]]", burgeoned in the synthesis of [[Empiricism]] and [[Rationalism]] as developed by [[Christian Thomasius]] (1655–1728) and [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] (1679–1754). This philosophy, circulated widely in many magazines and journals, profoundly directed the subsequent expansion of [[German language|German]]-speaking and [[European culture|European]] [[culture]].

The inability of this common-sense outlook convincingly to bridge "feeling" and "thought", "body" and "mind", led to [[Immanuel Kant]]'s epochal "critical" philosophy.{{Clarify|date=February 2011}} Another, though not as abstract, approach to this problem was a governing concern with the problems of aesthetics. In his ''Aesthetica'' of 1750 (vol. II; 1758)  [[Alexander Baumgarten]] (1714–62) defined "aesthetics", which he coined earlier in 1735, with its current intention as the "science" of the "lower faculties" (i.e., feeling, sensation, imagination, memory, et al.), which earlier figures of the Enlightenment had neglected&lt;!-- needs ref --&gt;. (The term, however, gave way to misunderstandings due to Baumgarten's use of the [[Latin]] in accordance with the German renditions, and consequently this has often led many to falsely undervalue his accomplishment.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Nivelle, ''Les Théories esthétiques en Allemagne de Baumgarten à Kant''. Bibliothèque de la Faculté de Philosophie et Lettres de l'Université de Liège (Paris, 1955), pp. 21 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;) It was no inquiry into taste—into positive or negative appeals—nor sensations as such but rather a way of knowledge. Baumgarten's emphasis on the need for such "sensuous" knowledge was a major abetment to the "pre-Romanticism" known as ''[[Sturm und Drang]]'' (1765), of which [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] and [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]] were notable participants for a time.

=== Cultural and historical context ===
Following Goethe's competition with and separation from Wieland and Herder, the movement Weimar Classicism is often described to have occurred only between Goethe's first stay in Rome (1786) and the death of Schiller (1805), his close friend and collaborator, underrating especially Wieland's influence on German intellectual and poetic life. Therefore, the Weimar Classicism could also be started with the arrival of Wieland (1772) and extended beyond Schiller's death until the death of Wieland (1813) or even of Goethe himself (1832).

In Italy, Goethe aimed to rediscover himself as a writer and to become an artist, through formal training in Rome, Europe's 'school of art'. While he failed as an artist, Italy appeared to have made him a better writer.

Schiller's evolution as a writer was following a similar path to Goethe's. He had begun as a writer of wild, violent, emotion-driven plays. In the late 1780s he turned to a more classical style. In 1794, Schiller and Goethe became friends and allies in a project to establish new standards for literature and the arts in Germany.

By contrast, the contemporaneous and efflorescing literary movement of [[German Romanticism]] was in opposition to Weimar and German Classicism, especially to Schiller. It is in this way both may be best understood, even to the degree in which Goethe continuously and stringently criticized it through much of his essays, such as "On Dilettantism",&lt;ref&gt;Borchmeyer, op. cit., p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; on art and literature.&lt;!-- Elaborate this particular criticism --&gt; After Schiller's death, the continuity of these objections partly elucidates the nature of Goethe's ideas in art and how they intermingled with his scientific thinking as well,&lt;ref&gt;Vaget, ''Dilettantismus und Meisterschaft. Zum Problem des Dilettantismus bei Goethe: Praxis, Theorie, Zeitkritik'' (Munich: Winkler, 1971).&lt;/ref&gt; inasmuch as it gives coherence to Goethe's work. Weimar Classicism may be seen as an attempt to reconcile—in "binary synthesis"—the vivid feeling emphasized by the ''[[Sturm und Drang]]'' movement with the clear thought emphasized by the Enlightenment, thus implying Weimar Classicism is intrinsically un-[[Platonism|Platonic]]. On this Goethe remarked:

{{Quotation|"The idea of the distinction between classical and romantic poetry [''Dichtung''&lt;ref&gt;The [[German language|German]] word has its [[English language|English]] equivalents in "poetry" and "fiction".&lt;/ref&gt;], which is now spread over the whole world, and occasions so many quarrels and divisions, came originally from Schiller and myself. I laid down the maxim of objective treatment of poetry, and would allow no other; but Schiller, who worked quite in the subjective way, deemed his own fashion the right one, and to defend himself against me, wrote the treatise upon 'Naïve and Sentimental Poetry.' He proved to me that I myself, against my will, was romantic, and that my 'Iphigenia,' through the predominance of sentiment, was by no means so classical and so much in the antique spirit as some people supposed.

"The Schlegels took up this idea, and carried it further, so that it has now been diffused over the whole world; and every one talks about classicism and romanticism—of which nobody thought fifty years ago."&lt;ref name=Eckermann&gt;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=eTfyNmEqgb8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Conversations+with+Eckermann,&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ge1R0auvNd&amp;sig=tYMp3X69HCB2HwmxHOGnjNBgnTE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=jExPTYXtNYbGlQe1xsU7&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=He%20proved%20to%20me%20that%20I%20myself%2C%20against%20my%20will%2C%20was%20romantic&amp;f=false Conversations With Eckermann (1823-1832)]''.M. Walter Dunne (1901).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Weimar movement was notable for its inclusion of female writers.  ''Die Horen'' included works by several women, including a serially published novel, ''Agnes von Lilien'', by Schiller's sister-in-law [[Caroline von Wolzogen]].  Other women published by Schiller included [[Sophie Mereau]], [[Friederike Brun]], [[Amalie von Imhoff]], [[Elisa von der Recke]], and [[Louise Brachmann]].&lt;ref&gt;Holmgren, Janet Besserer, ''The Women Writers in Schiller's ''Horen'': Patrons, Petticoats, and the Promotion of Weimar Classicism'' (Newark, Delaware: University of Delaware Press, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1786 and Schiller's death in 1805, he and Goethe worked to recruit a network of writers, philosophers, scholars and artists to their cause. This alliance later became known as 'Weimar Classicism', and it came to form a part of the foundation of 19th-century Germany's understanding of itself as a culture and the political [[unification of Germany]].

== Aesthetic and philosophical principles ==
These are essentials used by Goethe and Schiller:&lt;!-- examples of their engagement within texts, such as "Primal Words. Orphic", may be necessary; the desultory conditions of goethe's scientific ideas with his aesthetic ones are truly grown together --&gt;

# ''Gehalt'': the inexpressible "felt-thought", or "import", which is alive in the artist and the percipient that he or she finds means to express within the aesthetic form, hence ''Gehalt'' is implicit with form. A work's ''Gehalt'' is not reducible to its ''Inhalt''.
# ''Gestalt'': the aesthetic form, in which the import of the work is stratified, that emerges from the regulation of forms (these being rhetorical, grammatical, intellectual, and so on) abstracted from the world or created by the artist, with sense relationships prevailing within the employed medium.
# ''Stoff'': Schiller and Goethe reserve this (almost solely) for the forms taken from the world or that are created. In a work of art, ''Stoff'' (designated as "''Inhalt''", or "content", when observed in this context) is to be "indifferent" ("''gleichgültig''"), that is, it should not arouse undue interest, deflecting attention from the aesthetic form. Indeed, ''Stoff'' (i.e., also the medium through which the artist creates) needs to be in such a complete state of unicity with the ''Gestalt'' of the art-symbol that it cannot be abstracted except at the cost of destroying the aesthetic relations established by the artist.{{Citation needed|reason=How do we know these are "key" terms?|date=March 2016}}

Although the vociferously unrestricted, even "organic", works that were produced, such as ''Wilhelm Meister'', ''Faust'', and ''West-östlicher Divan'', where playful and turbulent ironies abound,&lt;ref&gt;Bahr, ''Die Ironie im Späwerk Goethes: "Diese sehr ernsten Scherze": Studien zum West-östlichen Divan, zu den Wanderjahren und zu Faust II'' (Berlin: Erich Schmidt Verlag, 1872).&lt;/ref&gt; may perceivably lend Weimar Classicism the double, ironic title "Weimar Romanticism",&lt;ref&gt;Borchmeyer, op. cit., p. 358.&lt;/ref&gt; it must nevertheless be understood that Goethe consistently demanded this distance via irony to be imbued within a work for precipitate aesthetic affect.&lt;ref&gt;Goethe's letter to Friedrich Zelter, 25.xii.1829. Cf. "''Spanische Romanzen, übersetzt von Beauregard Pandin''" (1823).&lt;/ref&gt; 

Schiller was very prolific during this period, writing his plays ''Wallenstein'' (1799), ''Mary Stuart'' (1800), ''The Maid of Orleans'' (1801), ''The Bride of Messina'' (1803) and ''William Tell'' (1804).

'''Zecharias Frankel''', also known as '''Zacharias Frankel''' (30 September 1801 – 13 February 1875) was a Bohemian-German [[rabbi]] and a historian who studied the historical development of Judaism. He was born in [[Prague]] and died in [[Wrocław|Breslau]]. Frankel was the founder and the most eminent member of the school of historical Judaism, which advocates freedom of research, while upholding the authority of traditional Jewish belief and practice. This school of thought was the intellectual progenitor of [[Conservative Judaism]].

Frankel was, through his father, a descendant of [[Vienna]] exiles of 1670 and of the famous [[rabbi]]nical Spira family, while on his mother's side he descended from the Fischel family, which has given to the community of Prague a number of distinguished [[Talmud]]ists. He received his early Jewish education at the [[yeshiva]] of [[Bezalel Ronsburg]] (Daniel Rosenbaum). In 1825 he went to [[Budapest]], where he prepared himself for the university, from which he graduated in 1831. In the following year he was appointed district rabbi ("Kreisrabbiner") of [[Litoměřice]] by the government, being the first rabbi in [[Bohemia]] with a modern education. He made [[Teplice]] his seat, where the congregation, the largest in the district, had elected him rabbi. He was called to [[Dresden]] in 1836 as chief rabbi, and was confirmed in this position by the Saxon government. In 1843 he was invited to the chief rabbinate at Berlin, which position had been vacant since 1800, but after a long correspondence he declined, chiefly because the Prussian government, in accordance with its fixed policy, refused to officially recognize the office. He remained in Dresden until 1854, when he was called to the presidency of the Breslau seminary, where he remained until his death.

== Religious attitude ==
Frankel held that reason based on scholarship, and not mere desire on the part of the laity, must be the justification for any reforms within Judaism. In this sense Frankel declared himself when the president of the Teplice congregation expressed the hope that the new rabbi would introduce reforms and do away with the "Missbräuche" (abuses). He stated that he knew of no abuses; and that if there were any, it was not at all the business of the laity to interfere in such matters (Brann, in his "Jahrbuch," 1899, pp.&amp;nbsp;109 et seq.).

He introduced some slight modifications in [[Jewish services|Jewish prayer services]] such as: the abrogation of some hymns, the introduction of a [[choir]] of boys, and the like. He was opposed to any innovation which was objectionable to Jewish sentiment. In this respect, his denunciation of the action of the "Landesrabbiner" Joseph Hoffmann of Saxe-Meiningen, who permitted Jewish high-school boys to write on the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]], is very significant ("Orient," iii. 398 et seq.).

His position in the [[Hamburg Temple disputes|controversy on the new Hamburg prayer book]] (1842) displeased both parties; the liberals were dissatisfied because, instead of declaring that their prayer-book was in accord with Jewish tradition, he pointed out inconsistencies from the historical and dogmatic points of view; and the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] were dissatisfied because he declared changes in the traditional ritual permissible (l.c. iii. 352-363, 377-384).

A great impression was produced by his letter of July 18, 1845, published in a [[Frankfurt-am-Main]] journal, in which he announced his secession from the rabbinical conference then in session in that city. He said that he could not cooperate with a body of rabbis who had passed a resolution declaring the [[Hebrew language]] unnecessary for public worship. This letter made Frankel one of the leaders of the conservative element. In opposition to the rabbinical conferences, he planned conventions of scholars. His principles were enunciated in his monthly ''Journal of the Religious Interests of Judaism'',&lt;ref&gt;German language name: [http://sammlungen.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/cm/periodical/titleinfo/2744856 "Zeitschrift für die Religiösen Interessen des Judenthums"]&lt;/ref&gt; which he published from 1844 onward. But Frankel's conciliatory attitude was bound to create for him enemies on both liberal and orthodox sides, and such was the case with [[Abraham Geiger]] and [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]], respectively.

== Controversy ==
Frankel was chosen president of the new [[Jüdisch-Theologisches Seminar (Fränckelscher Stiftung)|rabbinical seminary]] at [[Breslau]] (10 August 1854). Geiger, who had inspired Jonas Fränkel, the president of his congregation, to found this institution, opposed the appointment vigorously, and when the examination questions given by Frankel to the first graduating class appeared, Geiger published them in a German translation with the evident intention of ridiculing his methods of Talmudic instruction as sophistry (Geiger, "Jüd. Zeit." i. 169 et seq.).

[[Samson Raphael Hirsch]], immediately on the opening of the seminary, addressed an open letter to Frankel, demanding a statement as to the religious principles which would guide the instruction at the new institution. Frankel ignored the challenge. When the fourth volume of Grätz's history appeared Hirsch impeached the orthodoxy of the new institution (1856), and his attacks became more systematic when Frankel in 1859 published his Hebrew introduction to the [[Mishnah]]. The first attack began with the letter of {{Interlanguage link multi|Jedidiah Gottlieb Fischer|hu|3=Fischer Jedidja Gottlieb}}, rabbi of [[Székesfehérvár]], published in Hirsch's "Jeschurun", 1860. Hirsch himself began in the following year a series of articles in which he took exception to some of Frankel's statements, especially to his definition of rabbinical tradition, which he found vague; he further objected to Frankel's conception of the rabbinical controversies, which were, according to Frankel, improperly decided by certain devices common in parliamentary bodies.

It can hardly be denied that Frankel evaded the clear definition of what "tradition" meant to him. He contented himself with proving from [[Asher ben Jehiel|Rabbenu Asher]] that not everything called a "law", and reputed as given by [[Moses]] on [[Mount Sinai]], was actually of Mosaic origin.  Hirsch was seconded by various Orthodox rabbis, such as [[Ezriel Hildesheimer]], [[Solomon Klein]] of Colmar, and [[Benjamin Hirsch Auerbach]], while some of Frankel's supporters, like [[Salomon Juda Rappoport]], were half-hearted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hakirah.org/Vol%208%20Landerer.pdf Hakirah.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Frankel but once published a brief statement in his magazine, in which, however, he failed to give an outspoken exposition of his views ("Monatsschrift", 1861, pp.&amp;nbsp;159 et seq.). The general Jewish public remained indifferent to the whole controversy, and Frankel's position was gradually strengthened by the number of graduates from the seminary who earned reputations as scholars and as representatives of conservative Judaism.

== Literary activity ==
Frankel began his literary career rather late. His first independent publication was his work on the Jewish oath, ''Jewish Oaths in Theology and History''&lt;ref&gt;Translated from the German title: ''Die Eidesleistung bei den Juden in Theologischer und Historischer Beziehung''&lt;/ref&gt; (Dresden, 1840, 2d ed. 1847). This work owed its origin to a political question. The law of 16 August 1838, had improved the position of the Jews in Saxony, but still discriminated with regard to the Jewish oath, which was to be taken under conditions which seemed to involve the supposition that a Jew could not fully be trusted in his testimony before a civil court. Frankel proved that no Jewish doctrine justified such an assumption, and owing to his work, a new regulation (13 February 1840) put the Jews on the same basis as Christians as regards testimony in court.

== Biblical studies ==
His second great work was his ''Historical-Critical Studies on the Septuagint as Addition to the ''Targumim ''Contributions: Preliminary Studies for the Septuagint''&lt;ref&gt;Translated from the German title: ''Historisch-Kritische Studien zu der Septuaginta Nebst Beiträgen zu den Targumim: Vorstudien zu der Septuaginta''&lt;/ref&gt; (Leipzig, 1841).  To the same category belong three later works: ''On the Influence of Palestinian Exegesis on Alexandrian Hermeneutics''&lt;ref&gt;Translted from the German title: ''Ueber den Einfluss der Palästinensischen Exegese auf die Alexandrinische Hermeneutik''&lt;/ref&gt; (Leipzig, 1851); ''About Palestinian and Alexandrian Writing Research''&lt;ref&gt;Translated from the German title: ''Ueber Palästinensische und Alexandrinische Schriftforschung''&lt;/ref&gt; published in the program for the opening of the Breslau seminary (Breslau, 1854); and ''On the Targum of the Prophets''&lt;ref&gt;Translated from the German title: ''Zu dem Targum der Propheten''&lt;/ref&gt;  (Breslau, 1872).

In all these works it was his object to show that the exegesis of the Alexandrian Jews, and with it that of the early [[Church Fathers]], was dependent on Talmudic exegesis. In this investigation he became a pioneer, and many of his disciples followed him with similar investigations, not only of the [[Septuagint]], but also of the [[Vulgate]] and of the [[Peshitta]]. A political motive was involved in his study on legal procedure, "Der Gerichtliche Beweis nach Mosaisch-Talmudischem Rechte: Ein Beitrag zur Kenntnis des Mosaisch-Talmudischen Criminal-und Civilrechts: Nebst einer Untersuchung über die Preussische Gesetzgebung Hinsichtlich des Zeugnisses der Juden" (Berlin, 1846). The law of [[Prussia]] discriminated against the Jews insofar as the testimony of a Jew against a Christian was valid only in civil cases, and in these only when they involved a sum less than fifty thalers. It was due to Frankel's work, which was cited as an authority in the Prussian Diet, that the new law of July 23, 1847 referring to the Jews, abolished this discrimination.

== Introduction to Mishnah ==
Frankel's duties as professor of Talmudic literature showed him the necessity of modern scientific text-books on rabbinical literature and archeology. To this necessity are due his introduction to the [[Mishnah]], "Darke ha-Mishnah" (Leipzig, 1859), with a supplement and index under the title "Tosafot u-Mafteah; le-Sefer Darke ha-Mishnah" (1867).

Of the storm which this book created mention has been made already. It is one of the most valuable attempts at a systematized exposition of the history of early rabbinical literature and theology, and has largely inspired subsequent works of that kind, as those of [[Jacob Brüll]] and [[Isaac H. Weiss]]. His outline of rabbinical marriage law, "Grundlinien des Mosaisch-Talmudischen Eherechts" (Breslau, 1860), was likewise meant to serve as a text-book on that subject, as was also his attempt at a history of the post-Talmudic literature of sophistry, "Entwurf einer Geschichte der Literatur der Nachtalmudischen Responsen" (Breslau, 1865), which, however, is considered (by whom?) the weakest of his works.

Frankel's studies in the history of Talmudic literature had convinced him that the neglect of the [[Talmud|Jerusalem Talmud]] was a serious drawback in the critical investigation of the development of Talmudic law. To this field he determined to devote the remainder of his life. In 1870 he published his introduction to the Jerusalem Talmud under the title "Mebo ha-Yerushalmi" (Breslau). He afterward began a critical edition of the Jerusalem Talmud, with a commentary, but only three treatises had appeared, Berakot and Peah (Vienna, 1874) and Demai (Breslau, 1875), when his death intervened.

He wrote frequently for the two magazines which he edited, the ''[[Zeitschrift für die Religiösen Interessen des Judenthums]]'' (Leipzig, 1844–46), and the ''[[Monatsschrift für die Geschichte und Wissenschaft des Judenthums]]'', begun in 1851, and which he edited until 1868, when Grätz succeeded him as editor. Though a son of the rationalistic era which produced two of its most intense partisans, [[Peter Beer]] and [[Herz Homberg]] in his native city, Frankel developed, partly through opposition to shallow rationalism and partly through the romantic environments of the ancient city of Prague, that love and sympathy for the past that made him the typical expounder of the historical school which was known as the "Breslau school." His marriage with Rachel Meyer was childless.

== Zacharias Frankel College ==
Zacharias Frankel College in Berlin is named after him.&lt;ref&gt;http://zacharias-frankel-college.de/fileadmin/upload/News/ZSRS_Press_Release_v6.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RabbiKokin"&gt;{{cite web|author=Ryan Torok |url=http://jewishjournal.com/news/los_angeles/moving-shaking/220837/moving-shaking-wise-school-jerusalem-gold-gene-simmons/ |title=Moving &amp; Shaking: Wise School, "Jerusalem of Gold," and Gene Simmons — Jewish Journal |publisher=Jewishjournal.com |date= |accessdate=2017-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Nitzan Stein Kokin, who was German, became the first person to graduate from Zacharias Frankel College, which also made her the first Conservative rabbi to be ordained in Germany since before World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Leslee Komaiko |url=http://jewishjournal.com/news/los_angeles/219507/one-l-school-two-german-rabbis/ |title=One L.A. school: two German rabbis — Jewish Journal |publisher=Jewishjournal.com |date=2017-05-24 |accessdate=2017-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RabbiKokin"/&gt;

== Marriage ==

He married Rachel Maier of Teplice.  Through her mother, she was the great-granddaughter of Isak Landesmann of Police u Jemnice, who was remembered as a notable victim of eighteenth century anti-Semitism.&lt;ref&gt;H.
