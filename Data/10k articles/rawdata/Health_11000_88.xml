The [[2009 flu pandemic]], involving an [[outbreak]] of a new strain of [[influenza]] commonly known as [[Swine influenza|swine flu]] (usually referred as ''grippe A'' or ''grippe porcine'' in French), reached [[France]] in early May 2009.

In order to respond to flu epidemics in France, the government has a "national plan",&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.pandemie-grippale.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/PLAN_PG_2009.pdf Plan national de prevention et de lutte "Pandemie grippale"] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5jglVSV7q?url=http://www.pandemie-grippale.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/PLAN_PG_2009.pdf |date=2009-09-10 }}.

In this plan, the different phases of the flu, which are slightly different from the [[World Health Organization]] phases, are detailed.

* The ''High Council of Public Health'' (Haut Conseil de la Sante Publique - www.hcsp.fr) issues recommendations that are taken into account by the government in its decisions.
* The ''[[Institut de veille sanitaire|Institut national de veille sanitaire]]'' (National Institute for Sanitary Watch) is the body in charge of following the health situation in France. It issues a daily digest of the situation. It also issues the official French definition of cases: possible cases, probable cases, confirmed cases, excluded cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.invs.sante.fr/surveillance/grippe_dossier/index_h1n1.htm invs.sante.fr] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5jglWH35e?url=http://www.invs.sante.fr/surveillance/grippe_dossier/index_h1n1.htm |date=2009-09-10 }}.

== Government reaction to the flu ==

A governmental web site has been created&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.pandemie-grippale.gouv.fr Pandemie grippale.gouv.fr] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090509094541/http://www.pandemie-grippale.gouv.fr/ |date=2009-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to inform the population of the dangers and good practices to avoid the spread of the disease.

The French government lags behind the decision of the [[World Health Organization]] to upgrade to phase 6. It is currently in phase 5A in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.pandemie-grippale.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/GRIPPE_A_H1N1_Communique_presse_CIC_n14.pdf France keeps level 5A] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5jgkxdutT?url=http://www.pandemie-grippale.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/GRIPPE_A_H1N1_Communique_presse_CIC_n14.pdf |date=2009-09-10 }}.

In July 2010, France initially ordered 1,46 doses per inhabitant, the third largest amount among members of the [[Global Health Security Initiative]] (GHSI), behind the United Kingdom and Canada. In January, 50 million of the initial 94 million doses were cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lefigaro.fr/flash-actu/2010/01/08/01011-20100108FILWWW00610-commande-de-vaccins-h1n1-france-3e.php&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 May, the [[Robert Koch Institute]] confirmed the first case of human-to-human transmission of swine flu in [[Munich]]. A nurse who had contact with one of the infected people was infected with the virus. At approximately 10:00 she was claimed to be already healed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/mensch/0,1518,622339,00.html |title=Spiegel Online: Erste Mensch-zu-Mensch-Infektion mit Schweinegrippe in Deutschland |publisher=Spiegel Online |date=2009-05-01 |accessdate=2009-05-01 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503062737/http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/mensch/0%2C1518%2C622339%2C00.html |archivedate=3 May 2009 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At 13:00 one additional infection in [[Bavaria]] was confirmed, but the patient was also claimed to be healthy again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/mensch/0,1518,622358,00.html |title=Spiegel Online: Virologen erwarten weitere Schweinegrippe-Infektionen in Deutschland |publisher=Spiegel Online |date=2009-05-01 |accessdate=2009-05-01 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503034003/http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/mensch/0%2C1518%2C622358%2C00.html |archivedate=3 May 2009 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 May, a new human-to-human infection, in the same hospital in [[Munich]], was confirmed. The new patient, who was in the same room with the original infected German that came from Mexico, is currently being reported to show no signs of the new influenza strain anymore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/natur/0,1518,622442,00.html |title=Spiegel Online: Zweite Mensch-zu-Mensch-Infektion in Deutschland |publisher=Spiegel Online |date=2009-05-02 |accessdate=2009-05-02 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504000359/http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/natur/0%2C1518%2C622442%2C00.html |archivedate=4 May 2009 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 May, two further cases of swine flu in [[Brandenburg]] were reported.

'''Amygdalin''' (from [[Greek language|Ancient Greek]]: {{lang|grc|ἀμυγδαλή}} ''{{lang|grc-Latn|amygdálē}}'' "almond") is a naturally occurring [[chemical compound]], famous for falsely being promoted as a cancer cure. It is found in many plants, but most notably in the seeds (kernels) of [[apricot]], [[bitter almonds]], [[apple]], [[peach]], and [[plum]].

Amygdalin is classified as a [[cyanogenic glycoside]] because each amygdalin molecule includes a [[nitrile]] group, which can be released as the toxic [[cyanide]] anion by the action of a [[beta-glucosidase]]: eating amygdalin will cause it to release cyanide in the human body, and may lead to [[cyanide poisoning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/160427 |publisher=European Food Safety Authority |title=Apricot kernels pose risk of cyanide poisoning |date=27 April 2016 |quote=A naturally-occurring compound called amygdalin is present in apricot kernels and converts to hydrogen cyanide after eating.

Amygdalin is a cyanogenic glycoside derived from the aromatic amino acid [[phenylalanine]]. Amygdalin and [[prunasin]] are common among plants of the family [[Rosaceae]], particularly the genus ''[[Prunus]]'', [[Poaceae]] (grasses), [[Fabaceae]] (legumes), and in other food plants, including [[flaxseed]] and [[manioc]].  Within these plants, amygdalin and the enzymes necessary to hydrolyze them are stored in separate locations so that they will mix in response to tissue damage. This provides a natural defense system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mora CA, Halter JG, Adler C, Hund A, Anders H, Yu K, Stark WJ | title = Application of the Prunus spp. Cyanide Seed Defense System onto Wheat: Reduced Insect Feeding and Field Growth Tests | journal = Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry | volume = 64 | issue = 18 | pages = 3501–7 | date = May 2016 | pmid = 27119432 | doi = 10.1021/acs.jafc.6b00438 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amygdalin is contained in [[drupe|stone fruit]] kernels, such as [[apricot]] (1.4%), [[peach]] (0.68%), [[bitter almond]] (5%),{{cn|reason=ref cites other refs with wide range of values|date=March 2018}} and [[plum]] (0.04–1.7%), and also in the seeds of the [[apple]] (0.3%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bolarinwa IF, Orfila C, Morgan MR | title = Amygdalin content of seeds, kernels and food products commercially-available in the UK | journal = Food Chemistry | volume = 152 | pages = 133–9 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24444917 | doi = 10.1016/j.foodchem.2013.11.002 | url = http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/83873/2/Bolarinwa.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The stones are taken out of the fruit and cracked to obtain the kernels, which are dried in the sun or in ovens.

Laetrile (patented 1961) is a simpler semisynthetic version of amygdalin. Laetrile is synthesized from amygdalin by hydrolysis. The usual preferred commercial source is from apricot kernels (''[[Prunus armeniaca]]''). The name is derived from the separate words "laevarotatory" and "mandelonitrile". Laevarotatory describes the stereochemistry of the molecule, while mandelonitrile refers to the portion of the molecule from which cyanide is released by decomposition.&lt;ref name="NCIpdq"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors =  | title = Laetrile/Amygdalin (PDQ®)–Health Professional Version: General Information | date = March 15, 2017 | pmid = 26389425 | url = https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/laetrile-pdq#section/_5 | website = cancer.gov | publisher = National Cancer Institute | series = Complementary and Alternative Medicine for Health Professionals | access-date = 2017-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A 500&amp;nbsp;mg laetrile tablet may contain between 5–51&amp;nbsp;mg of hydrogen cyanide per gram.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | editor=Jerrold B. Leikin | editor2=Frank P. Paloucek | entry=Laetrile | title=Poisoning and Toxicology Handbook | edition=4th | publisher=Informa | year=2008 | page=950 | isbn=978-1-4200-4479-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like amygdalin, laetrile is hydrolyzed in the duodenum (alkaline) and in the intestine (enzymatically) to &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-[[glucuronic acid]] and &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-[[mandelonitrile]]; the latter hydrolyzes to benzaldehyde and hydrogen cyanide, that in sufficient quantities causes [[cyanide poisoning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rietjens IM, Martena MJ, Boersma MG, Spiegelenberg W, Alink GM | title = Molecular mechanisms of toxicity of important food-borne phytotoxins | journal = Molecular Nutrition &amp; Food Research | volume = 49 | issue = 2 | pages = 131–58 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 15635687 | doi = 10.1002/mnfr.200400078 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Claims for laetrile were based on three different hypotheses:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book | first = James A. | last = Duke | name-list-format = vanc | title=CRC Handbook of Medicinal Spices | publisher=CRC Press | year=2003 | isbn=978-0-8493-1279-3 | pages=261–262}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first hypothesis proposed that cancerous cells contained copious beta-glucosidases, which release HCN from laetrile via hydrolysis. Normal cells were reportedly unaffected, because they contained low concentrations of beta-glucosidases and high concentrations of [[rhodanese]], which converts HCN to the less toxic [[thiocyanate]]. Later, however, it was shown that both cancerous and normal cells contain only trace amounts of beta-glucosidases and similar amounts of rhodanese.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The second proposed that, after ingestion, amygdalin was hydrolyzed to [[mandelonitrile]], transported intact to the liver and converted to a beta-glucuronide complex, which was then carried to the cancerous cells, hydrolyzed by beta-glucuronidases to release mandelonitrile and then HCN. Mandelonitrile, however, dissociates to benzaldehyde and hydrogen cyanide, and cannot be stabilized by glycolsylation.&lt;ref name="EFSA2016"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Acute health risks related to the presence of cyanogenic glycosides in raw apricot kernels and products derived from raw apricot kernels|journal=EFSA Journal|volume=14|issue=4|year=2016|issn=18314732|doi=10.2903/j.efsa.2016.4424}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9}}

Finally, the third asserted that laetrile is the discovered vitamin B-17, and further suggests that cancer is a result of "B-17 deficiency". It postulated that regular dietary administration of this form of laetrile would, therefore, actually prevent all incidence of cancer. There is no evidence supporting this conjecture in the form of a physiologic process, nutritional requirement, or identification of any deficiency syndrome.&lt;ref name="pmid1154776"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Greenberg DM | title = The vitamin fraud in cancer quackery | journal = The Western Journal of Medicine | volume = 122 | issue = 4 | pages = 345–8 | date = April 1975 | pmid = 1154776 | pmc = 1129741 | doi =  | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=1154776 }} &lt;/ref&gt; The term "vitamin B-17" is not recognized by Committee on Nomenclature of the American Institute of Nutrition Vitamins.&lt;ref name="NCIpdq" /&gt; [[Ernst T.

=== History of laetrile ===
==== Early usage ====
Amygdalin was first isolated in 1830 from [[bitter almond]] seeds (''[[Prunus dulcis]]'') by [[Pierre-Jean Robiquet]] and [[Antoine François Boutron Charlard|Antoine Boutron-Charlard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A chronology of significant historical developments in the biological sciences |work=Botany Online Internet Hypertextbook |publisher=[[University of Hamburg]], Department of Biology |date=18 August 2002 |url=http://www.biologie.uni-hamburg.de/b-online/e01/geschichte.htm |access-date=6 August 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070820063617/http://www.biologie.uni-hamburg.de/b-online/e01/geschichte.htm |archive-date=20 August 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Justus von Liebig|Liebig]] and [[Friedrich Woehler|Wöhler]] found three [[hydrolysis]] products of amygdalin: sugar, benzaldehyde, and [[prussic acid]] (hydrogen cyanide, HCN).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Ueber die Bildung des Bittermandelöls |author1=F.

In 1845 amygdalin was used as a cancer treatment in Russia, and in the 1920s in the United States, but it was considered too poisonous.&lt;ref name=CancerInstitute/&gt; In the 1950s, a purportedly non-toxic, synthetic form was patented for use as a meat preservative,&lt;ref name=patent&gt;{{Cite patent| inventor-last = Krebs | inventor-first =Ernst T. | inventor2-last =Krebs, Jr. | inventor2-first =Ernst T. | date = 23 May 1961 | title = Hexuronic acid derivatives | url = http://www.freepatentsonline.com/2985664.html | country-code = US | patent-number = 2985664 | author =E Krebs}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later marketed as laetrile for cancer treatment.&lt;ref name=CancerInstitute/&gt;

The [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] prohibited the interstate shipment of amygdalin and laetrile in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carpenter|first=Daniel | name-list-format = vanc |title= Reputation and Power: Organizational Image and Pharmaceutical Regulation at the FDA.

==== Subsequent results ====
In a 1977 controlled, blinded trial, laetrile showed no more activity than placebo.&lt;ref name="Wade1977"/&gt;

Subsequently, laetrile was tested on 14 tumor systems without evidence of effectiveness. The [[Memorial Sloan&amp;ndash;Kettering Cancer Center]] (MSKCC) concluded that "laetrile showed no beneficial effects."&lt;ref name=Wade1977/&gt; Mistakes in an earlier MSKCC press release were highlighted by a group of laetrile proponents led by [[Ralph W.

A 2015 [[systematic review]] from the [[Cochrane Collaboration]] found: {{quotation|&lt;nowiki&gt;The claims that laetrile or amygdalin have beneficial effects for cancer patients are not currently supported by sound clinical data. There is a considerable risk of serious adverse effects from cyanide poisoning after laetrile or amygdalin, especially after oral ingestion. The risk–benefit balance of laetrile or amygdalin as a treatment for cancer is therefore unambiguously negative.&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;ref name=Milazzo2015 /&gt;|sign=|source=}}

The authors also recommended, on ethical and scientific grounds, that no further clinical research into laetrile or amygdalin be conducted.&lt;ref name=Milazzo2015 /&gt;

Given the lack of evidence, laetrile has not been approved by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] or the [[European Commission]].

The U.S. [[National Institutes of Health]] evaluated the evidence separately and concluded that clinical trials of amygdalin showed little or no effect against cancer.&lt;ref name =CancerInstitute&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/laetrile/patient/allpages#Section_20|title=Laetrile/Amygdalin|work=National Cancer Institute|date=2005-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a 1982 trial by the Mayo Clinic of 175 patients found that tumor size had increased in all but one patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancerhelp.org.uk/about-cancer/treatment/complementary-alternative/therapies/laetrile|title=Laetrile (amygdalin, vitamin B17)|work=cancerhelp.org.uk|date=2017-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors reported that "the hazards of amygdalin therapy were evidenced in several patients by symptoms of cyanide toxicity or by blood cyanide levels approaching the lethal range."

The study concluded "Patients exposed to this agent should be instructed about the danger of cyanide poisoning, and their blood cyanide levels should be carefully monitored. Amygdalin (Laetrile) is a toxic drug that is not effective as a cancer treatment".

Additionally,  "No controlled clinical trials (trials that compare groups of patients who receive the new treatment to groups who do not) of laetrile have been reported."&lt;ref name =CancerInstitute /&gt;

The side effects of laetrile treatment are the symptoms of cyanide poisoning. These symptoms include: nausea and vomiting, headache, dizziness, cherry red skin color, liver damage, abnormally low blood pressure, droopy upper eyelid, trouble walking due to damaged nerves, fever, mental confusion, coma, and death.

The [[European Food Safety Agency]]'s Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain has studied the potential toxicity of the amygdalin in [[apricot kernels]].  The Panel reported, "If consumers follow the recommendations of websites that promote consumption of apricot kernels, their exposure to cyanide will greatly exceed" the dose expected to be toxic.  The Panel also reported that acute cyanide toxicity had occurred in adults who had consumed 20 or more kernels and that in children "five or more kernels appear to be toxic".&lt;ref name="EFSA2016" /&gt;

=== Advocacy and legality of laetrile ===
Advocates for laetrile assert that there is a [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy]] between the US [[Food and Drug Administration]], the [[pharmaceutical industry]] and the medical community, including the [[American Medical Association]] and the [[American Cancer Society]], to exploit the American people, and especially cancer patients.&lt;ref name=ConsumerReports/&gt;

Advocates of the use of laetrile have also changed the rationale for its use, first as a treatment of cancer, then as a vitamin, then as part of a "holistic" nutritional regimen, or as treatment for cancer pain, among others, none of which have any significant evidence supporting its use.&lt;ref name=ConsumerReports/&gt;

Despite the lack of evidence for its use, laetrile developed a significant following due to its wide promotion as a "pain-free" treatment of cancer as an alternative to [[surgery]] and [[chemotherapy]] that have significant side effects. The use of laetrile led to a number of deaths.&lt;ref name=ConsumerReports&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Editors of Consumer Reports Books | title = Health Quackery | place = Vernon, New York | publisher = Consumers Union | year = 1980 | chapter = Laetrile: the Political Success of a Scientific Failure | pages = 16–40 | isbn = 978-0-89043-014-9  | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

In the  1970s, court cases in several states challenged the FDA's authority to restrict access to what they claimed are potentially lifesaving drugs.

The '''Association for the Wellbeing of Children in Healthcare''' is an [[Australian]]-based voluntary organisation that gives non-medical attention and support to hospitalised children and their parents. Formed in 1973, the group changed its name from Association for the Welfare of Children in Hospital to Association for the Welfare of Child Health in 1993 and then to Association for the Wellbeing of Children in Healthcare in 2007. In 2008, the association co-wrote "Standards for the Care of Children and Adolescents in Health Services," a set of guidelines for treating children and teenagers in wards that are separate from adults. As of 2007, the association was based in [[Gladesville, New South Wales]].

==History==
In 1959, the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|United Kingdom's Ministry of Health]] published the [[Platt Report 1959]], a three-year investigative account of the welfare of children in United Kingdom hospital that required hospitals to implement major changes in the non-medical care of children in hospital.&lt;ref name= "celebration"&gt;{{Citation |page=423 |work= British Journal of Nursing |publication-date=April 13, 2000 |volume=9 |issue=7 |title=A celebration of 100 years' achievement in child health |author=Ruth Davies | pages= |pmid=11111437 |doi=10.12968/bjon.2000.9.7.6322}}&lt;/ref&gt; That led to the 1961 formation of [[Peg Belson#Early work|Mother Care for Children in Hospital]] (MCCH), a group formed to increase the roles mothers had over the care of their child in hospital.&lt;ref name= "celebration"/&gt; By 1965, enough like-minded healthcare professionals joined the mother's group and the group was renamed the National Association for the Welfare of Children in Hospital (NAWCH).&lt;ref name= "celebration"/&gt; That led to the formation of similar groups in Canada (Canadian Association for Community Care) and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |page=559 |work= [[Pediatric Nursing (journal)|Pediatric Nursing]] |publication-date=November 1, 2001 |volume=27 |issue=6 |title=Involvement and fragmentation: a study of parental care of hospitalised children in Brazil |vauthors=de Lima RA, Rocha SM, Scochi CG, Callery P | pages= |pmid=12024527}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Association for the Wellbeing of Children in Healthcare (AWCH) was founded as Association for the Welfare of Children in Hospital (AWCH) on 15 February 1973 in [[Australia]] as a voluntary organisation that gives non-medical attention and support to hospitalised children and their parents.&lt;ref name= "Checkup"&gt;{{Citation |work= [[Irish Times]] |publication-date= September 1, 1997|title=Well &amp; Good Checkup |author=Lorna Kernan|accessdate= January 29, 2013 |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/health/1997/0901/97090100027.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newly formed organisation wanted to make the public aware of conditions for children in NSW's hospitals, including deficiencies in standards of care. The Association was particularly concerned whether parents were allowed to visit freely in hospitals.  Years of debate over the need to consider the emotional as well as physical needs of children in hospital lay behind the formation of the new body.  The group changed its 1973 name from Association for the Welfare of Children in Hospital to Association for the Welfare of Child Health in 1993, and then to Association for the Wellbeing of Children in Healthcare in 2007.

In 2008, the Association for the Wellbeing of Children in Healthcare and the [[Royal Australian College of General Practitioners|Royal Australian College of Physicians]] co-wrote "Standards for the Care of Children and Adolescents in Health Services," a set of guidelines for treating children and teenagers in wards that are separate from adults.&lt;ref name= "Call"&gt;{{Citation |at=sec.

'''Bread crumbs''' or '''breadcrumbs''' (regional variants: breading, crispies) are sliced residue of dry [[bread]], used for breading or crumbing foods, topping [[casserole]]s, [[stuffing]] [[poultry]], [[thickening]] [[stew]]s, adding inexpensive bulk to [[soups]], [[meatloaf|meatloaves]] and similar foods, and making a crisp and crunchy covering for fried foods, especially [[breaded cutlet]]s like [[tonkatsu]] and [[schnitzel]].  The [[Japanese cuisine|Japanese]] variety of bread crumbs is called ''panko''.

==Types==

===Dry breadcrumbs===
Dry breadcrumbs are made from dry breads which have been baked or toasted to remove most remaining moisture, and may have a sandy or even powdery texture.  Bread crumbs are most easily produced by pulverizing slices of bread in a [[food processor]], using a steel blade to make coarse crumbs, or a grating blade to make fine crumbs. A [[grater]] or similar tool will also do.

===Fresh breadcrumbs===
The breads used to make soft or fresh bread crumbs are not quite as dry, so the crumbs are larger and produce a softer coating, crust, or stuffing. The ''crumb'' of ''bread crumb'' also refers to the texture of the soft, inner part of a bread loaf, as distinguished from the crust, or "skin".

=== Panko ===
[[File:Baked panko crusted pork with pineapple sauce over udon.jpg|left|thumb|Baked ''panko'' crusted [[pork]] with [[pineapple]] sauce over [[udon]]]]
{{Nihongo|'''''Panko'''''|パン粉}} is a variety of flaky bread crumb used in [[Japanese cuisine]] as a crunchy coating for [[frying|fried]] foods, such as ''[[tonkatsu]]''. ''Panko'' is made from bread baked by electrical current, which yields a bread without a crust, and then grinding the bread to create fine slivers of crumb.&lt;ref name="UpperCrust"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCNU9TrbiRk |title=Panko Bread Crumbs: The Secrets Revealed |publisher=YouTube |date=2010-04-01 |accessdate=2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has a crisper, airier texture than most types of breading found in [[European cuisine|Western cuisine]] and resists absorbing oil or grease when fried, resulting in a lighter coating.  Outside [[Japan]], its use is becoming more popular in both Asian and non-Asian dishes: It is often used on seafood and is often available in [[Asian supermarket|Asian markets]], speciality stores, and, increasingly, in many large [[supermarket]]s.

''Panko'' is produced worldwide, particularly in Asian countries, including Japan, [[Korea]], [[Thailand]], [[China]], and [[Vietnam]].



==== Etymology ====

The Japanese first learned to make bread from the Europeans. The word ''panko'' is derived from ''pan'', the Portuguese/Spanish/Japanese word for bread, and ''-ko'', a Japanese suffix indicating "[[flour]]", "coating", "crumb", or "powder" (as in ''komeko'', "rice powder", ''sobako'', "[[buckwheat]] flour", and ''komugiko'', "[[wheat]] flour").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Marshall |first=Jo |url=http://www.heraldnews.com/lifestyle/food/x2084588983/COOKCABULARY-Panko-is-a-crumby-ingredient |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111122002748/http://www.heraldnews.com/lifestyle/food/x2084588983/COOKCABULARY-Panko-is-a-crumby-ingredient |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-11-22 |title=COOKCABULARY: Panko is a crumby ingredient - Fall River, MA |publisher=The Herald News |date=2010-10-05 |accessdate=2012-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Breading==
[[File:Breading.jpg|thumb|Cornmeal breading]]
'''Breading''' (also known as '''crumbing''') is a dry [[grain]]-derived [[food coating]] for a piece of food made from bread crumbs or a breading mixture with seasonings. Breading can also refer to the process of applying a bread-like coating to a food. Breading is well suited for [[frying]] as it lends itself to creating a crisp coating around the food. Breading mixtures can be made of breadcrumb, [[flour]], [[cornmeal]], and [[seasoning]] that the item to be breaded is dredged in before cooking. If the item to be breaded is too dry for the coating to stick, the item may first be moistened with [[buttermilk]], raw [[egg (food)|egg]], [[egg wash]] or other liquid.

Breading contrasts with [[batter (cooking)|batter]], which is a grain-based liquid coating for food that produces a smoother and finer texture, but which can be softer overall.

==In popular culture==
In the fairy tale [[Hansel and Gretel]], breadcrumbs were used by Hansel and Gretel to track their footpath. However, the bread crumbs were eventually eaten by birds, subsequently leading them to become lost in the woods. The popularity of breadcrumbs in the fairy tale lead to the inspiration the name "[[Breadcrumb (navigation)|breadcrumb]]" as a navigation element that allows users to keep track of their locations within programs or documents.&lt;ref name="Mark Levene"&gt;{{cite book|title=An Introduction to Search Engines and Web Navigation|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0470526842|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=mDI72_9-bw0C&amp;pg=PA221|author=Mark Levene|edition=2nd|page=221|date=18 October 2010|accessdate=June 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4940">'''Celibacy syndrome''' ({{lang-ja|セックスしない症候群}}, ''sekkusu shinai shōkōgun'') is a media hypothesis proposing that a growing number of Japanese adults have lost interest in [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] and have also lost interest in [[romantic love]], [[dating]] and [[marriage]].&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/20/young-people-japan-stopped-having-sex |title=Why have young people in Japan stopped having sex? |publisher=The Guardian |date=20 October 2013 |accessdate=8 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The theory has been reported by unknown members of "Japan's media" according to journalist Abigail Haworth of ''[[the Guardian]]''.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; Following the  report, the theory gained widespread attention in English media outlets in 2013,&lt;ref name="news.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/relationships/celibacy-syndrome-hits-japan-with-more-young-people-avoiding-sex/story-fnet0gt3-1226743585472 |title=Celibacy syndrome hits Japan with more young people avoiding sex |publisher=News.com.au |date=21 October 2013 |accessdate=8 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was subsequently refuted by several journalists and bloggers.&lt;ref name="yutaaoki"/&gt;&lt;ref name="yutaaoki"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yutaaoki.com/blog/top5-mistakes-journalists-make-about-sexless-japan |title=Top 5 Mistakes Journalists Make about Sexless Japan |date=28 October 2013 |accessdate=28 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="slate"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_world_/2013/10/23/are_japanese_people_really_having_less_sex_than_anyone_else.html |publisher=Slate.com |title=No, Japanese People Haven’t Given Up on Sex |date=23 October 2013 |accessdate=28 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="suckers"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ampontan.wordpress.com/2012/02/03/suckers/ |title=Suckers |date=3 February 2012 |accessdate=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="firstthings"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.firstthings.com/blogs/firstthoughts/2013/10/news-flash-yuko-and-hiro-do-not-despise-sex/ |title="Yuko and Hiro" Do Not Despise Sex |date=13 October 2013 |accessdate=28 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="washpo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://knowmore.washingtonpost.com/2013/10/23/yes-japanese-people-still-have-sex/ |title=Don’t worry.

==Reports and causes==
In addition to [[celibacy]], the theory cites declining numbers of marriages and declining birthrates in Japan.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;  According to surveys conducted by the Japan Association for Sex Education, between 2011 and 2013, the number of female college students reporting to be [[Virginity|virgins]] increased.  Additionally, surveys conducted by the Japanese Family Planning Association (JFPA) indicated a high number of Japanese women who reported that they "were not interested in or despised sexual contact".&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; Meanwhile, surveys conducted by the National Institute of Population and Social Security Research in Japan in 2008 and 2013, revealed that the number of Japanese men and women reporting to not be in any kind of romantic relationship grew by 10%.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;&lt;ref name="news.com"/&gt;

The theory attributes two possible causes for these reports:  the past two decades of economic stagnation as well as high gender inequality in Japan.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;

==Criticism==
One critic accused ''The Guardian'' and other media outlets of using "cherry-picked" data in order to make a sensational claim that appeals to Western notions of a "weird Japan".&lt;ref name="slate"/&gt; Another criticism points to contrary statistics that indicate that Japanese youth are having sex more frequently than ever.&lt;ref name="washpo"/&gt; Additionally, one of the surveys on which the theory is based has been criticized as having a statistically invalid [[Sample size determination|sample size]]. In that survey, only 60 respondents (aged 16 to 19) claimed an aversion to sex, and merely 126 respondents were used to represent the young Japanese population (aged 16 to 19),&lt;ref name="suckers"/&gt; which was nearly 6 million in 2014.&lt;ref name="pop_stats"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stat.go.jp/english/data/jinsui/tsuki/ |title=Population Estimates by Age (5-Year Age Group) and Sex |date=1 July 2014 |accessdate=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another criticism points out that, while the theory conflates sexlessness with low birthrate, these have been demonstrated by others to be uncorrelated.&lt;ref name="yutaaoki"/&gt;

'''The Children's Cancer Center of Lebanon''' is a non-profit medical institution dedicated to the comprehensive treatment of pediatric cancer.  The center is affiliated with [[St. Jude Children's Research Hospital]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], founded by Lebanese U.S. comedian and actor [[Danny Thomas]]. He had a dream to open a similar medical institute in his ancestral home of [[Lebanon]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Danny Thomas's children [[Marlo Thomas|Marlo]] and [[Tony Thomas (producer)|Tony Thomas]] pursued his dream until the center opened in [[Beirut]] on April 12, 2002.  The center, which is located on 56 [[Rue Clémenceau]], works in association with the nearby [[American University of Beirut]] Medical Center (AUBMC). The mission of the center is to save children's lives using the protocols of [[St. Jude]].  The center depends completely on donations and fundraising programs. 

On April 12, 2002, the late Prime Minister of Lebanon, [[Rafik Hariri]], several ministers of the [[Lebanese government]] and members of the [[Lebanese Parliament]], as well as major officials from the [[American University of Beirut]], joined a delegation from  the [[American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities]] and [[St. Jude Children's Research Hospital]] and the board of the ''Children's Cancer Center of Lebanon'' for the inauguration ceremony of the center. Additionally, parents and families of Lebanese children treated at St. Jude's in Memphis also attended the opening ceremony.

[[Malay titles|Dato']] '''Chua Jui Meng''' ({{zh|s=蔡锐明|t=蔡銳明|p=Cài Ruì Míng}}; born 22 October 1943) is a [[Malaysian people|Malaysian]] politician. He was the [[Dewan Rakyat|Member of the Parliament]] of [[Malaysia]] for the [[Bakri, Johor|Bakri]] constituency in the [[States and federal territories of Malaysia|State]] of [[Johor]] for five terms from 1986 to 2008. He was the country's longest serving [[Ministry of Health (Malaysia)|Minister of Health]], holding that position from 1995 to 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=It’s A Ministerial Jinx For MCA |url=https://www.malaysia-today.net/its-a-ministerial-jinx-for-mca/ |last1= |first1= |date=3 January 2008 |work=The Sun|publisher=MALAYSIA TODAY |accessdate=4 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chua is a lawyer called to the British Bar as a [[Barrister|Barrister-at-law]] at the [[Inner Temple]] before entering politics through his involvement with the [[Malaysian Chinese Association]] (MCA). After 35 years with the party, he quit to join [[Parti Keadilan Rakyat]] (PKR) in 2009.

==Political career==
Prior to entering full-time politics, Chua was a student activist in the 1970s. He was president of the Malaysian and Singaporean Law Society in the United Kingdom and Ireland as well as Editor in Chief of the Federation of UK and Ireland Malaysian and Singaporean Student Associations.&lt;ref name="track record"&gt;{{citation|title=Track Record of Dato' Chua Jui Meng |url=http://chuajuimeng.com/english/trackrecord.html |accessdate=5 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505051441/http://www.chuajuimeng.com/english/trackrecord.html |archivedate=5 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malaysian Chinese Association===
Chua began his political career in 1976 when he became a member of the [[Malaysian Chinese Association]], a component of the ruling [[Barisan Nasional]] coalition. In the [[Malaysian general election, 1986|1986 general election]], he was elected as [[Dewan Rakyat|Member of Parliament]] for [[Bakri (federal constituency)|Bakri]], a seat he retained for five consecutive terms.

His speech in Parliament in 1988 on the "Malaysian Chinese dilemma" as a result of the "deviations and misimplementation" of the [[New Economic Policy]] (NEP) sparked the formation of the National Economic Consultative Council (NECC). The NECC formulated the [[National Development Policy]] (1990–2000), which Chua credited as key to liberalising the economy, education and culture and turning Chinese voter in favour of Barisan Nasional from the 1990s to 2004.&lt;ref name="track record"/&gt;

In 1989, Chua was appointed parliamentary secretary for the [[Ministry of Health (Malaysia)|Ministry of Health]]. He was elected as a vice-president of the MCA in 1990 and became the Deputy Minister of International Trade and Industry following the [[Malaysian general election, 1990|1990 general election]]. During this period, he worked on developing [[small and medium enterprises]] and promoting trade with [[People's Republic of China|China]].&lt;ref name="track record"/&gt;

After the [[Malaysian general election, 1995|1995 general election]], Chua was appointed Minister of Health. During his tenure, Chua led the government's fight against the [[Coxsackievirus]] outbreak in 1997, the [[Henipavirus|Nipah virus]] outbreak in 1999, the [[Japanese encephalitis]] outbreak in 2000 and the global [[SARS]] epidemic in 2003.&lt;ref name="track record"/&gt;

MCA fell into crisis in 2001, when factional infighting between "Teams A" and "B" became public. Chua aligned himself to the [[Lim Ah Lek]]-led Team B during the ''[[Nanyang Siang Pau]]'' takeover crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Nanyang Takeover Crisis |url=http://www.aliran.com/oldsite/monthly/2001/5b.html |last1=Loh |first1=Francis |publisher=Aliran |accessdate=8 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090906062608/http://www.aliran.com/oldsite/monthly/2001/5b.html |archivedate=6 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2002 party elections were cancelled, and Chua retained his vice presidency under the MCA "peace plan" of 2003, which saw [[Ong Ka Ting]] assume the presidency. However, he was dropped from the Cabinet after the [[Malaysian general election, 2004|2004 general election]] as he was not recommended to the prime minister by the new party leader.&lt;ref name="tussle"&gt;{{cite news |title=Tussle between MCA top two – Redux |url=http://english.cpiasia.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1766:tussle-between-mca-top-two-redux-&amp;Itemid=169 |last1=Chin |first1=James |date=29 October 2009 |publisher=Centre for Policy Initiatives |accessdate=5 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721120401/http://english.cpiasia.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1766%3Atussle-between-mca-top-two-redux-&amp;Itemid=169 |archivedate=21 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following year's party elections, Chua challenged Ong for the presidency. He performed above expectations, garnering more than a third of the delegates' votes, but was unable to topple the heavily favoured Ong.&lt;ref name="tussle"/&gt; He made another long-shot attempt at the presidency in 2008, but lost out to [[Ong Tee Keat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tee Keat wins, Soi Lek is MCA No. 2 |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/10/18/nation/20081018214845&amp;sec=nation |date=18 October 2008 |publisher=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did not contest the [[Malaysian general election, 2008|2008 general election]] and [[Malaysian general election, 2013|2013]] as his former seat of [[Bakri (federal constituency)|Bakri]] fell to the opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

===Parti Keadilan Rakyat===
In July 2009, Chua quit the MCA to join the opposition [[Parti Keadilan Rakyat]] (PKR), citing the need to preserve the two-party system that emerged after the 2008 elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2009/7/18/nation/20090718163926&amp;sec=nation| title=Chua Jui Meng quits MCA, joins PKR|publisher=[[The Star (Malaysia)]] |date=18 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2010, the Sultan of Johor, [[Ibrahim Ismail of Johor|Sultan Ibrahim Ismail]] revoked the state awards (carrying the titles Dato' and Dato' Seri) conferred to Chua by the previous Sultan. Chua accused Barisan Nasional of instigating the move as payback for joining the opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jui Meng stripped of Datukship, blames Johor Umno |url=http://freemalaysiatoday.com/fmt-english/politics/pakatan-rakyat/6622-jui-meng-stripped-of-datukship-blames-johor-umno |publisher=[[Free Malaysia Today]] |date=10 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He still retains the Dato' title since he was conferred other state titles by the Sultans of Selangor and Pahang.

He was PKR's chief in [[Johor]], which is regarded as a Barisan Nasional stronghold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=PKR to name Jui Meng Johor chief |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/pkr-to-name-jui-meng-johor-chief/ |last1=Yow |first1=Hong Chieh |date=5 July 2010 |publisher=[[The Malaysian Insider]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Chua appointed PKR Johor chief |url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/fmt-english/politics/pakatan-rakyat/7731-chua-appointed-pkr-johor-chief |date=8 July 2010 |author=Syed Jaymal Zahiid |publisher=[[Free Malaysia Today]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013, an open verbal conflict erupted between Johor DAP chairman [[Boo Cheng Hau]] and Chua Jui Meng, prompting calls from both DAP and PKR party heavyweights to weigh in for their party stalwarts. This as a result of accusations from either side accusing each other of splitting [[Pakatan Rakyat]] in the state of Johor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pakatan top brass weigh in on feud between Boo and Chua |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2013/2/20/nation/12733683&amp;sec=nation |last1=Lee &amp; Gasper |first1=Regina &amp; Desiree Tresa |date=20 February 2013 |publisher=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gasper &amp; Wong|first=Desiree Tresa &amp; Pek Mei|title=Johor DAP-PKR spat gets serious|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2013/2/22/nation/12743069&amp;sec=nation|accessdate=22 February 2013|newspaper=The Star (Malaysia)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conflict was resolved after talks and mediation by the central leadership of both parties. One of the sign of reconciliation between Chua and Johor DAP was demonstrated when Chua received unconditional support from the DAP chief in the Segamat constituency which he was chosen to contest at the [[Malaysian general election, 2013|2013 election]]. The seat was traditionally contested by DAP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pragalath|first=K|title=DAP, PKR join forces for Battle Segamat|url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2013/04/11/dap-pkr-join-forces-for-battle-segamat|accessdate=12 April 2013|newspaper=Free Malaysia Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chua was defeated in the election by the incumbent member Dr. [[Subramaniam Sathasivam|S. Subramaniam]], a federal minister.

A '''collective trauma''' is a traumatic psychological effect shared by a group of people of any size, up to and including an entire society. Traumatic events witnessed by an entire society can stir up collective sentiment, often resulting in a shift in that society's culture and mass actions.&lt;ref&gt;Lisa  Gale Garrigues, "[http://www.yesmagazine.org/issues/love-and-the-apocalypse/free-yourself-from-the-past Slave and Slave Holders Break Free of History's Trauma]" Yes Magazine, August 2, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18729704 Updegraff, Silvler, Holman, "Searching for and Finding Meaning in Collective Trauma, Journal of Personal and Social  Psychology, September 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

Well known collective traumas include: The [[Holocaust]],&lt;ref&gt;Kellermann, N. (2009) Holocaust trauma. New York: iUniverse.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Armenian Genocide]], [[Slavery in the United States]],&lt;ref&gt;Joy De Gruy, Post-Traumatic Slave Syndrome, Uptone Press; 1st edition (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]],&lt;ref&gt;Saito, H. (2006). Reiterated Commemoration: Hiroshima as National Trauma*. Sociological Theory, 24(4), 353-376.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Trail of Tears]],&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, C. (2008), Trails of Tears, and Hope, Harvard Magazine, 110(4)&lt;/ref&gt;, the [[MS Estonia]] in [[Sweden]], the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] in the United States, and various others.

Collective traumas have been shown to play a key role in group [[identity formation]] (see: [[Gestalt psychology|Law of Common Fate]]). During [[World War II]], a US submarine, the [[USS Puffer (SS-268)]], came under several hours of [[depth charge]] attack by a Japanese surface vessel until the ship became convinced the submarine had somehow escaped. Psychological studies later showed that crewmen transferred to the submarine after the event were never accepted as part of the [[team]]. Later, US naval policy was changed so that after events of such psychological trauma, the crew would be dispersed to new assignments.

Rehabilitation of survivors becomes extremely difficult when entire nation has experienced such severe traumas as war, genocide, torture, massacre, etc. Treatment is hardly effective when everybody is traumatized. Trauma remains chronic and would reproduce itself as long as social causes are not addressed and perpetrators continue to enjoy impunity. The whole society may suffer from an everlasting culture of pain. (1)

During the [[Algerian War]], [[Frantz Omar Fanon]] found his practice of treatment of native Algerians ineffective due to the continuation of the horror of a colonial war. He emphasized about the social origin of traumas, joined the liberation movement and urged oppressed people to purge themselves of their degrading traumas through their collective liberation struggle. He made the following remarks in his letter of resignation, as the Head of the Psychiatry Department at the Blida-Joinville Hospital in Algeria:&lt;blockquote&gt;"If psychiatry is the medical technique that aims to enable man no longer to be a stranger to his environment, I owe it to myself to affirm that the Arab, permanently an alien in his own country, lives in a state of absolute depersonalization." (2) Inculcation of horror and anxiety, through widespread torture, massacre, genocide and similar coercive measures has happened frequently in human history. There are plenty of examples in our modern history. Tyrants have always used their technique of "psychological artillery" in an attempt to cause havoc and confusion in the minds of people and hypnotize them with intimidation and cynicism. The result is a collective trauma that will [[Transgenerational trauma|pass through generations]]. There is no magic formula of rehabilitation. Collective trauma can be alleviated through cohesive and collective efforts such as recognition, remembrance, solidarity, communal therapy and massive cooperation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7073">'''Commissioning support units''' were established in April 2013 from the remains of the [[Primary Care Trust]]s and [[Strategic Health Authority|Strategic Health Authorities]] as part of the reorganisation of the National Health Service in England following the [[Health and Social Care Act 2012]].

Twenty five regional commissioning support units submitted outline business plans in 2012 to NHS England which hosted them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Commissioning support: Key facts|url=http://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/csu-facts.pdf|publisher=NHS England|accessdate=31 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commissioning support units were largely staffed by former employees of [[primary care trust]]s.  They were intended to provide support to [[clinical commissioning group]]s by providing business intelligence, health and clinical procurement services and other back-office administrative functions, including contract management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Commissioning support unit structures and how they will operate|url=http://www.kingsfund.org.uk/publications/articles/commissioning-support-unit-structures-and-how-they-will-operate|publisher=Kings Fund|accessdate=25 May 2014|date=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan was to introduce competition into this market by making them independent businesses from 2016.  By May 2014 there had been a number of amalgamations as some clinical commissioning groups brought their commissioning support services in-house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=North west London CCGs to bring services in-house|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/news/commissioning/north-west-london-ccgs-to-bring-services-in-house/5070706.article|accessdate=25 May 2014|newspaper=Health Service Journal|date=14 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greater East Midlands Commissioning Support Unit was criticised by [[Liz Kendall]] MP who said it should no longer run NHS [[continuing healthcare]] services for patients with complex needs and that it only had one part-time person monitoring the quality of all its home care providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Failing' East Midlands NHS body should be 'sacked'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-27312152|accessdate=31 May 2014|newspaper=BBC News|date=8 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It announced plans for a merger with NHS Arden CSU in November 2014.  Between them they provide specialist support to 37 [[Clinical commissioning group]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Midlands CSUs merge|url=http://www.ehi.co.uk/news/primary-care/9759/midlands-csus-merge|accessdate=24 November 2014|publisher=E Health Insider|date=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

North of England Commissioning Support Unit has expanded some of their services to other areas of the country such as their business intelligence tool [http://www.raidr.co.uk/ RAIDR], which is now deployed in over [http://www.computerworlduk.com/news/public-sector/3581077/nhs-to-expand-analytics-tool-from-850-to-1500-gp-practices/ 20% of GP Practices In England]. 

The South, South West and Central Southern Commissioning Support Units announced in January 2015 that they planned to merge into a new organisation to be called South, Central and West Commissioning Support which will span Sussex, Cornwall, Gloucestershire and Oxfordshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Three southern CSUs to formally merge|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/news/commissioning/three-southern-csus-to-formally-merge/5077990.article#.VLJ7uiusUk4|accessdate=11 January 2015|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The CSUs in the North West and in Yorkshire were not admitted to the NHS procurement framework in February 2015 and NHS England announced that they had no future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Region’s NHS faces further upheaval as unit loses contract|url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/main-topics/general-news/region-s-nhs-faces-further-upheaval-as-unit-loses-contract-1-7104070|accessdate=5 March 2015|publisher=Yorkshire Post|date=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Services in Greater Manchester were transferred to Greater Manchester Shared Services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=£6m spent on redundancies at closed CSUs|url=https://www.hsj.co.uk/topics/workforce/revealed-6m-spent-on-redundancies-at-closed-csus/7010095.article|accessdate=29 October 2016|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 April 2017, NHS South East CSU formed a partnership with NHS North and East London CSU (NEL CSU). 

Eight organisations were accredited to provide CCGs with support:
*[http://www.necsu.nhs.uk/ NHS North of England CSU];
*[https://www.ardengemcsu.nhs.uk/ NHS Arden and Greater East Midlands CSU];
*[http://midlandsandlancashirecsu.nhs.uk/ NHS Midlands and Lancashire CSU];
*[http://www.nelcsu.nhs.uk/ NEL CSU];
*[http://www.scwcsu.nhs.uk/ NHS South, Central and West CSU];
*[[Capita]];
*[[Optum]]; 
* [https://embedhealth.co.uk/ eMBED] - a consortium of [[Mouchel]], [[BDO International]], Engine and [[Dr Foster]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Revealed: winners and losers of CCG support framework|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/news/commissioning/revealed-winners-and-losers-of-ccg-support-framework/5081784.article#.VPjHnvmsVyU|accessdate=5 March 2015|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=5 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which took 300 staff from the Yorkshire CSU.

in 2013/4 NHS England paid £125m for services from the 19 CSUs operational in that year. £602m of their income came from [[clinical commissioning group]]s, and £80m from “other sources” such as provider trusts and local councils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NHS England spending on CSU services|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/news/finance/revealed-nhs-england-spending-on-csu-services/5074376.article#.VCnM1BLGBJ0|accessdate=29 September 2014|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A tendering exercise for the services supplied by the Yorkshire and Humber commissioning support unit was delayed in September 2015 because of lack of interest by potential suppliers in the contract, valued at £20 million pa.  It appeared that the CCGs were planning to take a lot of the work in house, as the existing contract amounted to £85 million pa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lack of interest delays support service procurement|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/news/commissioning/exclusive-lack-of-interest-delays-support-service-procurement/5090487.article#.VjZL4kr611A|accessdate=1 November 2015|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The North of England Commissioning Support Unit is to be converted into a [[community interest company]]  owned by the 11 [[clinical commissioning group]]s covering the North East and Cumbria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Leading CSU paves way to becoming CCG-owned company|url=https://www.hsj.co.uk/7018322.article?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiWXpCaU1UQXdPR0prTkdWaSIsInQiOiJXU2xEYU8xaDVBMXR2cVpxdkZcL2NucThnc0VBR3BaQ0xBQ0xXR2VHWDQzNG5IUVVaWnkySzg2b25ORVB2bVdjRE5kK1hBV1hUWDhlcTdta1NYTzVlWDFnaWh3dkx4VVZIbVdXOGhWNFwvTVpqbFF2dUxyZnNQcWZra0xhRE5Qd2s2In0%3D|accessdate=30 May 2017|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=30 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cosmetic surgery, also referred to as aesthetic surgery, is a surgical procedure which endeavours to improve the physical aspects of one's appearance to become more aesthetically pleasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = cosmetic surgery|url = http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/cosmetic+surgery|accessdate = 2015-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The continuously growing field of cosmetic surgery is closely linked with [[plastic surgery]], the difference being, cosmetic surgery is an elective surgery with the sole purpose to enhance the physical features of one's appearance. Plastic surgery is performed in order to rectify defects to reinstate normality to function and appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Cosmetic Surgery vs. Plastic Surgery {{!}}American Board of Cosmetic Surgery|url = http://www.americanboardcosmeticsurgery.org/patient-resources/cosmetic-surgery-vs-plastic-surgery/|accessdate = 2015-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cosmetic surgical procedures are generally performed on healthy functioning body parts, with the procedure being optional not medically necessary. The inevitable aim of cosmetic surgery is to enhance one's image, encompassing reducing the signs of [[Ageing|aging]] and/or correction of a believed deviation on one's body in turn it is surrounded by [[controversy]]. Although the implementation of cosmetic surgery within Australian society is growing, the trade has struggled to find its place within the [[Culture of Australia|Australian culture]].

== Etymology ==
The word "cosmetic", originates from the [[Greek language|Greek]] term Kosmetike, meaning the "art of beautifying".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Online Etymology Dictionary|url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=Cosmetic+surgery|website = www.etymonline.com|accessdate = 2015-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:A girl suffering from secondary Syphilis to the face Wellcome L0038266.jpg|thumb|Ill shaped nose of a young girl suffering from syphilis.]]The history of cosmetic surgery can be linked back to that of plastic surgery, as the debate persists, around the blurred lines of the two.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = About Plastic Surgery – Australian Society of Plastic Surgeons|url = http://www.plasticsurgery.org.au/about-us/about-plastic-surgery/|website = www.plasticsurgery.org.au|accessdate = 2015-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plastic surgery originated in 600 BC when [[Hindu]] surgeons performed [[rhinoplasty]] with the use of segments of [[Cheek|cheek tissue]].

At the end of the fifteenth century when [[syphilis]] was prevalent, came the introduction of debatable [[reconstructive surgery]] to rectify the ill shaped nose, a prominent feature of Syphilis sufferers. The sixteenth century saw an Italian by the name of [[Gaspare Tagliacozzi]] adopt the method of using upper arm tissue to reconstruct the nose during rhinoplasty, granting him the nickname 'the father of plastic surgery'. Although Tagliacozzi's approach left patients required to have their arm raised to their nose for several months, requiring numerous surgeries, with excessive [[Scar]]ing.

England was exposed to the Hindu techniques of rhinoplasty by a practitioner in 1815, who clearly defined the use for the surgery, limited to those who were physically affected by the horrors of [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Towards the end of the century in the 1880s John Orlando Roe, a New York surgeon, developed a technique which prevented scarring by operating from inside the nostrils.

[[World War I]] was the most costly war to Australia in regards to [[Death|fatality]]. The brutality sparked the generation of plastic surgery within Australia introduced by a man by the name of [[Harold Gillies]]. Gillies oversaw the development of the first unit to treat the returned battle scared [[veterans]] of the war. This led to the relocation of the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]] to the Queen Mary Hospital in [[Sidcup]], England. The Queen Mary Hospital opened in 1917 was a six hundred bed hospital which focused solely on plastic surgery. It was here that Gillies trained not only Australian plastic surgeons but surgeons from all over the globe. The return of these surgeons to their home countries such as Australia, saw the spread of the plastic surgery trade across the globe.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The war gave the dishonoured trade a respected name through the treatment and resurrection of returned war veterans, with shattered physical traits. The century gave rise to [[Anesthetic|anaesthetics]] and [[Antiseptic]]s prompting an increase in the number of surgeries being performed. But with this heroic status and development of techniques came the taboo ideology cast upon cosmetic surgery as the trade filtered into the population, with civilians un-pleased with their aesthetic appearance undergoing surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Before &amp; After {{!}} American History Lives at American Heritage|url = http://www.americanheritage.com/content/after?page=3|website = www.americanheritage.com|accessdate = 2015-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In turn the need for secrecy arose as people felt the need to hide the truth about their surgical endeavours. From here a surgeon by the name of Henry Junius Schireson, acquired his license to practice throughout multiple states of [[United States|America]], who became known in 1923 when he performed rhinoplasty on a [[Jewish]] actress [[Fanny Brice]] in her New York apartment,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A chronologic history of cosmetic surgery.|journal = Bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine|date = 1 March 1971|issn = 0028-7091|pmc = 1749866|pmid = 5276837|pages = 265–302|volume = 47|issue = 3|first = B O|last = Rogers}}&lt;/ref&gt; giving birth to the booming trade of cosmetic surgery for everyday civilians.

Benjamin Rank was an Australian trained by Gillies himself who in the 1940s governed the [[Royal Melbourne Hospital]] which was the first plastic surgery unit within Australia. It was in 1956 that plastic surgery was acknowledged by the Royal Australia College of Surgeons as a separate specialty trade of plastic surgery.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Today, the Australian Society of Plastic Surgeons Inc. founded in 1917, commonly known as ASPS, was founded in 1970 with the aim to uphold the integrity of the plastic surgery field (inclusive of cosmetic and reconstructive surgery) within Australia. Today, the deliverance of the highest quality surgeries is at the forefront of their work. They govern the AMC accredited Surgical Education and Training (SET) Program within Australia.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Development of modern techniques ==

=== Non-invasive treatments ===
The development of different techniques within the field of cosmetic surgery has led to the [[innovation]] of [[Non-invasive (medical)|non-invasive methods]]. Nine percent of the Australian population have undergone a non-invasive form of cosmetic surgery.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Skin The Essential Australian Guide|last = Segal|first = David|publisher = Fairfax Media Publications Pty Limited|year = 2009|isbn = 978-1-921486-20-3|location = Pyrmont, NSW|pages = 89–90}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous surgeries are now performed using these techniques as opposed to open surgery methods which have been used in the past. This adaptation has led to a reduction in cost, time, scarring and pain involved with these procedures. Through the development of aiding surgical instruments such as a viewing scope or [[Laser]]s (see below), this shift has been made possible, reducing the incision site resulting in a faster recovery time for patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Cosmetic Surgery Options|url = http://www.webmd.com/beauty/treatments/cosmetic-procedures-cosmetic-surgery-options-basics?page=1|accessdate = 2015-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of non-invasive surgeries are as muscle relaxants, such as [[Botox]] or [[Botulinum toxin|Dysport]].

==== IPL ====
Another form of laser treatment is [[intense pulsed light]] (IPL). IPL differs from laser treatment as unlike laser treatments, IPL will perform multiple treatments at once but only a few are capable of doing so with the same potency as a laser.  IPL is predominantly used for mild skin issues in comparison to laser being used for the more extreme cases.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Types of cosmetic surgery available ==

=== Augmentation mammaplasty ===
Also known as breast augmentation, [[Breast augmentation|Augmentation Mammaplasty]] involves the use of [[breast implants]] or the transfer of [[Adipose tissue|fat tissue]] to restore and create volume or improve symmetry of the breast.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Cosmetic Surgery Procedures {{!}} American Society of Plastic Surgeons|url = http://www.plasticsurgery.org/cosmetic-procedures.html|website = www.plasticsurgery.org|accessdate = 2015-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implants used are most commonly composed of [[silicone]] which are inserted underneath the skin/muscle through a small incision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Beauty Quotient Formula|last = Robert|first = M|publisher = Hay House Australia Pty Ltd|year = 2010|isbn = 978-1-4019-2452-2|location = |pages = 219–224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Breast Augmentation frequently is performed in conjunction with [[mastopexy]].

=== Mastopexy ===
Mastopexy common known as a breast lift, involves the reshaping of the surrounding skin and tissue of the breast to produce a more youthful looking breast in appearance. The removal of excess skin along with tightening of tissue results in enhancing the shape of the breast, raising the breast to sit higher. The causes of loss of skin elasticity are vast being a result of [[Breastfeeding|breast feeding]], pregnancy, aging, [[gravity]], [[genetics]] and fluctuation in weight. The [[areola]] of the [[breast]], (pigmented ring of skin which sits around the nipple), may stretch over a life span, which can be reduced during mastopexy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Reduction mammaplasty ===
Also known as a [[breast reduction]], is the removal of breast fat, glandular tissue and skin, resulting in a reduction in the size and weight of the breasts. This type of surgery is frequently used by women who experience discomfort such as [[back pain]] due to the in-proportion between body size and breast size and shape.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Brachioplasty ===
A common term for [[brachioplasty]] is an arm lift. This is the reshaping of the dorsal portion of the arm spanning from the upper arm to the elbow. This procedure will reduce the downward sagging of the skin around the area of the triceps, tightening the skin. The supportive tissue which emphasises the shape of the arm is remodelled, tightening and smoothing its appearance via the removal of pockets of fat.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Lipoplasty ===
Lipoplasty also referred to as [[liposuction]] is the removal of deposits of fat around specific areas of the body with the goal to enhance the physical contours of the body. Fat can be removed from selected area reducing prominent sections in which the patient finds unpleasing. Areas which are commonly focused on by patients are the [[Thigh]]s, [[Hip]]s, arms, [[abdomen]], [[buttocks]], inner knee, back, calves, face and chest. This form of surgery is commonly performed alongside other surgical procedures such as [[abdominoplasty]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;[[Abdominoplasty|.]]

=== Body contouring ===
[[Body contouring]] is a common procedure in both men and women. The surgery is prominent in those who have undergone significant [[weight loss]] resulting in excess sagging skin being present around areas of the body. Patients who have lost a large portion of excess weight may experience issues with elasticity of the skin once the fat has been lost. The skin losses [[elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] (a condition called elastosis&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Fast Living Slow Ageing: How to age less, look great, live longer, get more|last = Marie|first = K|publisher = Health Inform Pty Ltd|year = 2013|isbn = 978-0-9806339-2-4|location = Strawberry Hills, Australia|pages = 229–311|last2 = Thomas|first2 = Prof M.C|chapter = 33|edition = 4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;) once it has been stretched past capacity and is unable to recoil back to its standard position against the body and also with age. Body contouring is the removal of this excess skin and fat from numerous areas of the body, restoring the appearance of skin elasticity of the remaining skin, enhancing the contouring an tone of the body.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Abdominoplasty ===
Also known as a [[Abdominoplasty|tummy tuck]], this form of surgery removes the excess skin and fat from the abdominal area. Commonly the surgery will also restore the muscles which have been weakened and/or separated by carrying excess weight for long periods of time.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Sclerotherapy ===
Common in women due to the [[hairless]] trend within society, numerous women seek medical treatment to remove visible '[[Telangiectasia|spider veins]]' (Telangiectasia), which appear on the surface of the skin. The small blood vessels spread across the skin which are cause by stress to the vessel itself. They can vary in colour, red, blue or purple and also vary in size. They are common on the legs, thighs and ankles. These veins can be caused by prolonged sitting, pregnancy, [[Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia|hereditary]], changes in weigh and also due to [[Hormone|hormone fluctuation.]] The vessel is injected with a solution via a needle which causes the vein to collapse and begin to fade, becoming less prominent in colour on the skin.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Gluteal augmentation ===
[[File:Dr. Placik Buttock Lift.jpg|thumb|Gluteal augmentation, commonly referred to as buttock lift.]]
[[Buttock augmentation]] increases the size and prominence of the [[Buttocks|buttock muscles]]. This look it created using either the grafting of fat, implants or both, to boost the appearance of the muscles. This fills the buttock giving it a rounded smooth appearance and is also said to help improve [[Posture (psychology)|posture]] and balance.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Gynecomastia surgery ===
[[Gynecomastia|Gynecomastia surgery]] is a breast reduction surgery for men. The condition Gynecomastia has numerous causes to the growth of breasts in men including [[obesity]], a hormone imbalance, genetic dispositions or the side effect of a medication. This condition is not painful although some suggest there are mental side effects of the condition, hence the availability of surgical correction.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Dermal fillers ===
Dermal fillers are injected below the skin to give a more fuller, youthful appearance of a feature or section of the face. These fillers deplete signs of aging such as wrinkles by filling and stretching the skin. One type of dermal filler is [[Hyaluronic acid]]. Hyaluronic acid is naturally found throughout the human body. It plays a vital role in moving [[Nutrient]]s to the cells of the skin from the blood. It is also commonly used in patients suffering from [[Arthritis]] as it acts like a cushion to the bones which have depleted the [[Hyaline cartilage|articular cartilage]] casing. Development within this field has occurred over time with synthetic forms of hyaluronic acid is being created, playing roles in other forms of cosmetic surgery such as facial augmentation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Rhinoplasty ===
[[File:Rhinoplasty morozov.jpg|thumb|Before and after images of a patient who has undergone Rhinoplasty.]]
[[Rhinoplasty]] is surgery of the nose, reshaping the structure of the facial feature. This surgery can be used by people for improving the look of their nose or by people who suffer from [[Dyspnea|breathing problems]] as a result of the structure of their nose obscuring the airways. Frequent changes people desire are to the shape of the [[Nostril]]s, size of the bridge, correction of a [[Nasal septum deviation|deviated septum]], width or length of the nose, facial symmetry, depression or prominent bumps of the nose.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Facial implants ===
Implants can be used in order to enhance features of the face. They are used to perfect symmetry and make the appearance of features more prominent such as the cheek, chin and jaw.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Rhytidectomy ===
A common form of cosmetic surgery is [[Rhytidectomy]] which is known as a face lift. Patients undergo a face lift to reduce the signs of aging. Sagging skin, wrinkles and loss of skin tones are a few main signs of aging which a face lift can rectify. Numerous factors can enhance the speed of aging such as exposure to the sun, hereditary, gravitational pull and medical conditions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Micropigmentation ===
[[Permanent makeup|Micropigmentation]] is the creation of permanent makeup using natural pigments to places such as the eyes to create the effect of eye shadow, lips creating lipstick and cheek bones to create a blush like look. The pigment is inserted beneath the skin using a machine which injects a small needle at a very fast rate carrying pigment into the skin, creating a lasting colouration of the desired area.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Otoplasty ===
[[Otorhinolaryngology|Ear Surgery]] is performed in order to improve the look of the ear. Common reasons one feels they require the surgery can be due to dis-figuration caused by injury, [[Congenital disorder|birth defects]], irregular shape, prominent position of the ear, irregular size being either too small or too large (oversized ears is a condition known as [[macrotia]]) in proportion with the head.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Mentoplasty ===
Mentolasty is surgery to the chin. This can involve either enhancing or reducing the size of the chin. Enhancements are achieved with the use of facial implants. Reduction of the chin involved reducing the size of the chin bone.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Risk factors ==
Due to cosmetic surgery being an elective surgical procedure it is of common assumption that the risk factors around these surgeries are lower than that of other surgeries. The invasive procedures have numerous risk factors as it is still a medical procedure, all of which come with a level of risk. The non-invasive treatments also come with a level of risk although lower than invasive methods. This common impression can be linked to the controversies surrounding the trade as critics struggle to see the link between the benefits and the risk facts. Surgeries are generally linked to, although not restricted to, risk factors effecting the area in which the surgery is performed. Some of the common risks are the development of a [[hematoma]], organ damage, [[deep vein thrombosis]], [[seroma]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The 10 Most Common Plastic Surgery Complications|url = http://www.healthline.com/health/most-common-plastic-surgery-complications|accessdate = 2015-09-04|date = 2015-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; excessive bleeding, swelling, bruising, [[ectropion]] (optical), blindness (optical), obstruction of airways (nasal), loss of sensation, excessive scarring (including of [[Keloid|keloid scars]]), a shift in position of hair line effecting symmetry and nerve damage.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Preconditions and Risks of Cosmetic Surgery – Gorgeous Getaways|url = http://gorgeousgetaways.com/risks-of-surgery/?gclid=CL6T4PaP3McCFVWSvQodoWcCxg|website = Gorgeous Getaways|accessdate = 2015-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Smoking ===
Most surgeons will suggest to patients electing to undergo cosmetic surgery to cease smoking for a period before and after their alterations. Generally a period of four weeks pre-operative and post operative, to aid in the recovery time and the healing of the wound. Just like other surgeries, cosmetic surgery may require incisions to be made to the skin, in one or more places of the body. These wounds will be required to heal post operation, therefore leaving the patient at risk of poor wound healing which may be due to numerous causes such as infection requiring [[antibiotics]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Medical conditions ===
Medical conditions can impact on the level of risk involved with cosmetic surgery as there can be underlying effects caused by different medications. For example, blood thinning medication can cause excessive bleeding due to the bloods ability to clot being lowered by the medication. All medications prescribed to a patient are noted and discussed by the surgeons to reduce the chance of issues arising.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Psychological impacts ==
The most common reason behind one's choice to undergo cosmetic surgery is due to dissatisfaction with their body image. Body image issues are commonly allied with lower levels of [[Self-esteem|self esteem]] and [[Psychological well-being|psychological well being]].&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Healthy body image: Tips for guiding girls – Mayo Clinic|url = http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/tween-and-teen-health/in-depth/healthy-body-image/art-20044668|website = www.mayoclinic.org|accessdate = 2015-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; These issues are the cause of many women turning to cosmetic surgery. In today's world viewers are flooded with images and advertisements, showing generally, naturally unobtainable faces and bodies. There is a growing trend of reality television shows broadcasting makeovers of ordinary civilians undergoing cosmetic surgery to enhance their aesthetic image. Viewpoints grow around the link between the climbing figures of cosmetic surgery and the constantly changing world of media. There is a constant stream of connection developed via social media outlets such as Facebook and [[Instagram]] which hold a high level of importance within people lives. Other viewpoints circle the growth of public awareness of the topic is increasing becoming a direct link to this growth spurt in popularity of surgery. Many of the patients who undergo cosmetic surgery have been found to have low levels of self-esteem and use cosmetic surgery to rectify the issues they have with their body image. Numerous studies have focused on the final outcome of cosmetic procedures and the level of satisfaction which patients have with their results showing a large portion of patients look for additional surgeries to rectify the issue. Cosmetic surgery in a lot of cases will enhances the problems patients have with their self-esteem issues instead of depressing them as first desired.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Studies show that patients who undergo cosmetic surgery who have been made aware of the risks involved along with the technical side of the procedure, have higher levels of satisfaction with their outcome post-surgery.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Psychiatric Issues in Cosmetic Plastic Surgery|journal = Psychiatric Quarterly|date = 18 January 2012|issn = 0033-2720|pages = 343–352|volume = 83|issue = 3|doi = 10.1007/s11126-012-9204-8|pmid = 22252848|first = William Leif|last = Ericksen|first2 = Stephen Bates|last2 = Billick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Body dysmorphic disorder ===
[[Body dysmorphic disorder]] (BDD) is a condition of which people find their own image immensely flawed. It effects both men and women equally, with the average onset age of thirteen years of age. The condition is treatable although there is an alarmingly high rate of suicide within BDD sufferers, one in every three hundred and thirty diagnosed will end their own lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BDD {{!}} Home {{!}} Body Dysmorphic Disorder|url = http://bddfoundation.org/|website = bddfoundation.org|accessdate = 2015-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patients of BDD will commonly turn to cosmetic surgery to rectify these flaws resulting in unsatisfactory results due to their condition.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Histrionic personality disorder ===
[[Histrionic personality disorder]] can be categorised as a person who thrives on being the center of attention in all social settings. They show signs of [[Attention seeking|attention seeking behaviour]] along with instability emotionally. Immense discomfort is felt by the individual when they do not feel they are the epicenter of a group or one on one environment and often struggle when it comes to relationships with others, being both on a level of friendship and sexual relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Histrionic Personality Disorder Symptoms|url = http://psychcentral.com/disorders/histrionic-personality-disorder-symptoms/|accessdate = 2015-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suggestions have been made in regards to the need for screening before cosmetic surgeries are performed on patients who suffer from disorders such as histrionic personality disorder as the level of satisfaction which is felt by individuals post-surgery is low, triggering the desire for additional treatments. The surgery impacts on their self-esteem leaving them higher levels of distressed post-op.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Controversies ==

The controversies surrounding cosmetic surgery are plentiful. The stigma that exists around the practice has been evident since its introduction into the [[modern history|modern world]]. The taboo stigma around these types of surgery is beginning to fade as we see the trend of cosmetic surgery growing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[File:Breast implants in hand 01.jpg|thumb|Silicone breast implant.]]

=== Age limitations ===
The age limitations around cosmetic surgery within Australia is eighteen years of age until one is eligible to opt to undergo cosmetic surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Enhance Plastic Surgery: With Dr Andrew Broadhurst|url = http://enhance-plastic-surgery.com.au/faq/is-there-an-age-limit-for-cosmetic-surgery/|website = enhance-plastic-surgery.com.au|accessdate = 2015-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is numerous discussions occurring around the use of cosmetic surgery within children which have undergone extensive [[Trauma surgery|trauma]] due to a catastrophic life event or birth defects, in turn patients seek cosmetic surgery to rectify the issue. The debate around whether this is ethically correct exists with the viewpoint that this is unethical and the surgeries are for the purpose of vanity. Other sides of the debate argue for the lasting impacts on the children during adolescent years due to the dis-figuration causing prejudice and view the surgical procedures will attribute to the child's mental health in later years.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Regulating cosmetic surgery: a scalpel where it is needed|journal = British Journal of Nursing|date = 8 February 2012|issn = 0966-0461|pages = 190–191|volume = 21|issue = 3|doi = 10.12968/bjon.2012.21.3.190|pmid = 22584662|first = Jean V|last = McHale}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Faulty breast implants ===
In 2011, concerns were expressed as information arose in regards to the quality of the material being used in silicone breast implants. Industrial grade silicone was being used in the replacement of medical grade supplies by a French firm by the name of [[Poly Implant Prothèse|Poly Implant Prothese]] (PIP). The silicone being used was found to be suitable for uses within the production of mattresses.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 2011, it was reported that in twelve years of production, more than 300,000 PIP implants were sold globally.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In the case of rupture the dispute around safety risks arose with parties debating the increase cancer risks due to the poor grade materials. To date there has been no scientific evidence proving the implants should cause safety concerns linking to toxicity or cancer. The debate surrounds whether the removal of the implants is required due to safety concerns around rupture and toxicity.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|title = Implants: France recommends removal but UK does not – BBC News|url = https://www.bbc.com/news/health-16311763|accessdate = 2015-09-01|work = BBC News|date = 2011-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Laser Tattoo Removal Alice Pien MD AMAskincare.jpg|thumb|Laser being used within the field of tattoo removal.]]

=== Laser and IPL regulation ===
Concerns are sparked within Australia around the level of regulation which exists around the implementation of laser and IPL treatments. The practice has little federal regulated with inconsistencies existing between the states within Australia. It is largely debated around the level of regulation in comparison to the heavy controls placed around the use of [[Drug prohibition law|schedule 4 drugs]] such as Botox or Dysport. Many rally for the investigation into the uses of these techniques, claiming long term damage can be a result of mistreatment. The authority involved in the monitoring these regulations within Australia is the [[Department of Health (Australia)|Department of Health]], the [[Therapeutic Goods Administration]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Plastic surgery for pets ===
[[File:2014 Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show (12451566673).jpg|thumb|Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show]]
A growing trend all over the world is the implementation of cosmetic surgery within the field of veterinary science. Pet owners are spending thousands on rectifying issues which are present in their pets appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A facelift for Fido and Botox for Buster: How pet owners are spending over $10,000 on cosmetic surgery for DOGS|url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2357023/A-facelift-Fido-Botox-Buster-How-pet-owners-spending-10-000-cosmetic-surgery-DOGS.html|accessdate = 2015-09-04|date = 2013-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the surgical procedures being performed are teeth straightening methods, face lifts to reduce wrinkles, eyebrow corrections, botox, implants (facial and testicular) and excess skin removal from specific parts of the body. Many of these treatments although not life-threatening are seen to some as enhancing the animals quality of life, therefore warrant surgical correction. In the realms of animal showing such as [[Show dog]]s, cosmetic correction is common to ensure the animal conform to the strict guidelines of breed specific characteristics. Those who support the use of cosmetic surgery within pets argue the corrections enhance the pets self-esteem thus quality of life. Those that oppose the trade argue the surgical correction for aesthetics is in line with animal cruelty and it is for the benefit of the owners vanity in opposition to the animals welfare. Only a select few veterinary surgeons will perform these types of procedures if a direct enhancement to the pets quality of life is not evident.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Can I Get My Dog Plastic Surgery?|url = http://canigivemydog.com/plastic-surgery|website = canigivemydog.com|accessdate = 2015-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cultural Competency Training''' is an instruction to achieve cultural competence and the ability to appreciate and interpret accurately other [[culture]]s.

==Cultural competence==
[[Cultural competence]] refers to an ability to interact effectively with people of different cultures. Cultural competence comprises four components: (a) awareness of one's own cultural worldview, (b) attitude towards cultural differences, (c) knowledge of different cultural practices and worldviews, and (d) cross-cultural skills. Developing cultural competence results in an ability to understand, communicate with, and effectively interact with people across cultures and leads to a 15% decrease in miscommunication.&lt;ref name=Forest&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.culturalcandor.com/| title=Cultural Candor Inc. Cultural Competency Training| accessdate=12 November 2015| publisher=Cultural Candor Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural Competency has a fundamental importance in every aspect of a work field and that includes school and government setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nasponline.org/research-and-policy/advocacy-tools-and-resources/communications-strategies-and-resources/school-climate%E2%80%94connectthedots/the-importance-of-cultural-competence|title=The Importance of Cultural Competence|website=www.nasponline.org|language=en|access-date=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the amalgamation of different cultures in American society, it has become imperative for teachers and government employees to have some form of cultural competency training.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nea.org/home/39783.htm|title=Why Cultural Competence?|work=NEA|access-date=2017-05-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
To cater to an increasingly globalized society, many hospitals, organizations, and employers may choose to implement forms of cultural competency training methods to enhance transparency between language, values, beliefs, and cultural differences.  Training in cultural competence often includes careful consideration of how best to approach people's various forms of diversity.  This new found awareness oftentimes allows military members, educators, medical practitioners, workers, and common citizens to establish equity in their environments and enhances interrelationships between one another for increased productivity levels.  There have been numerous developed theories as to how best to conduct cultural competency training, which oftentimes is dependent on the specific environment and type of work.

== Cultural Competence Training &amp; Identity ==

When defining the ideas that surround cultural competence training, defining what culture is can help to understand the ideas that shape the concept. [[Culture]] is defined as the set of shared attitudes, values, goals, and practices that characterizes an institution or organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of CULTURE|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/culture|website=www.merriam-webster.com|accessdate=1 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; When looking at culture in terms of cultural competence training, certain groups of individuals should be focused on because of their relevance to society. There are many groups that are marginalized and underrepresented; however, four specific areas to look at are:

=== LGBTQIAP ===
[[LGBT|LGBTQIAP]] community, race, and religion. These areas, along with others, represent concepts that make up one’s identity. The approach to identity helps to shape the ideas and themes that go into cultural competence training.
The acronym LGBTQIAP stands for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transsexual, Transgender, Queer, Questioning, Intersex, Asexual, Ally, and Pansexual. This particular group of individuals has faced numerous obstacles and has historical events to highlight the inequalities they face such as the Stonewall riots. The [[Stonewall riots]] became a symbol for the gay liberation movement when police attempted a raid at the Stonewall Inn bar to arrest the gay and lesbian patrons and the gay community fought back. Numerous systemic oppressions historically and currently target LGBT individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leyva|first1=Valerie L.|last2=Breshears|first2=Elizabeth M.|last3=Ringstad|first3=Robin|title=Assessing the Efficacy of LGBT Cultural Competency Training for Aging Services Providers in California’s Central Valley|journal=Journal of Gerontological Social Work|volume=57|issue=2-4|pages=335–348|doi=10.1080/01634372.2013.872215}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural competence training helps professionals develop knowledge and skills on how to address issues and be more aware on the type of language that is politically correct.

=== Race ===
Race is a sensitive aspect of cultural competency training that requires professionals to be able to identify, acknowledge and value cultural differences. Training on this aspect of cultural competence teaches professionals that to ignore racial differences, is a form of microaggression that can help exacerbate racial inequalities.  In order to begin to understand intercultural communications one must understand the historical and social context under which different cultural groups operate.  For example, the history related to the cultural genocide of indigenous peoples in North America, understanding the said group’s value system, their ways of learning, and logic is essential in being able to understand how certain aspects of their culture may be similar or different from our own. Such distinction must be approached with respect and without ascribing superiority or inferiority to the difference.

=== Religion ===
Religious differences can play a role in how professionals interact and communicate with others. [[Religiosity]] refers to the nature and extent of public and private religious activity, including belief in God, prayer, and place of worship attendance. Religiosity is usually linked to formal religious traditions (such as [[Christianity]]), institutions (such as mosques), sacred texts (such as [[Book of Mormon|The Book of Mormon]]), and a definitive moral code (such as the Decalogue). Spirituality can be an important part of religion but can also exist independent of extant faith traditions, involving a variety of more individual subjective beliefs and activities related to the sacred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whitley|first1=Rob|last2=Jarvis|first2=Eric G.|title=Religious Understanding as Cultural Competence: Issues for Clinicians|journal=Psychiatric Times|date=June 2015|pages=1–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this aspect of cultural competence training professionals should learn how to have religious competence. Religious competence refers to skills, practices, and orientations that recognize, explore, and harness patient religiosity to facilitate diagnosis, recovery, and healing. Religious competence involves the learning and deployment of generic competencies, including active listening and a nonjudgmental stance. It is also an overarching orientation, providing a safe place for discussion of religious issues and identities received in a humble, respectful, and empathetic manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whitley|first1=Rob|last2=Jarvis|first2=Eric G.|title=Religious Understanding as Cultural Competence: Issues for Clinicians|journal=Psychiatric Times|date=June 2015|pages=1–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nationality ===
in terms of nationality, particularly for people who are immigrants, the recent increase in global migration make them an increasingly common demographic everywhere. Though they will have varying cultures as well. In this aspect, it is important for those who are trained to understand both similarities and differences between them, and the individual they are helping. With this knowledge, it makes the process of aiding the individual more efficient, and successful. &lt;ref&gt;Schouler-Ocak, Graef-Calliess, Tarricone, Qureshi, Kastrup, &amp; Bhugra. (2015). EPA guidance on cultural competence training. ''European Psychiatry,'' ''30''(3), 431-440.&lt;/ref&gt; Both the past Nation the individual has come from, and their journey of immigration as an experience, can shape their mentality. To have specialists with specific nationalities help explain some differences is a helpful strategy. &lt;ref&gt;Bhugra, D. (2017). Cultural competence training and mental health care in refugees and asylum seekers. ''European Psychiatry,'' ''41''(SS), S35.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural Competence Training in School ==
School is considered to be the second learning home for kids. Every year a large number of people come to the United States. These groups of people are often families, including small children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics|title=Immigration Data &amp; Statistics {{!}} Homeland Security|website=www.dhs.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In today’s world, cultural competency plays a very vital role in shaping the kids future. In the United States, there is an underlying difference among parents as to how a kid should be raised, but it is clear that cultural competency should be taught at a young age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://fee.org/articles/cultural-competence-and-your-child/|title=Cultural Competence and Your Child {{!}} Wendy McElroy|last=McElroy|first=Wendy|date=2007-09-01|access-date=2017-05-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States is not the front runner in cultural competency training amongst children, as Canada and Australia are seemingly far more progressive in this sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wehearyou.acecqa.gov.au/2014/07/10/what-does-it-mean-to-be-culturally-competent/|title=What does it mean to be culturally competent?|last=ACECQA|first=Author|date=2014-07-10|website=We Hear You|access-date=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural competency training can be a huge help for the families who are thinking of adopting a foster child, specifically, if that child was born outside of United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.socialworkers.org/pressroom/features/issue/diversity.asp|title=Diversity &amp; Cultural Competence|website=www.socialworkers.org|access-date=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; A school is a mixture of different races and cultures and as an educator, one must be sensitive to everyone’s needs. Different cultures act uniquely to the different situations, and as an educator, one has to not only value diversity, but also have a strategy for everyone to feel welcomed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nea.org/tools/30402.htm|title=Diversity Toolkit: Cultural Competence for Educators|work=NEA|access-date=2017-05-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural Competence Training in the Workforce ==
Over the years, there have been new developed ways of practicing cultural competency in the workforce. There are many different methods that would allow assistance in cultural competency such as: Global leadership programs, international team building exercises and specific cross-cultural skills training for special executive positions. Having a good grasp on the many different cultures that exist is increasingly becoming a major principle in the workforce. The techniques for cultural competency training must be practiced more than just in class room lecture. Trainers must be extremely educated in this matter to be able to sufficiently train people.  They must take notice of their own biases perspective and about the different types cultures that receive discrimination.

== Cultural Competence Training for Medical Students and Physicians ==
{{see also|Cultural competence in health care}}
In the medical setting, effective communication between clinicians, patients, families and other health care providers is fundamental.

[[Health disparities]] refer to gaps in the quality of health and health care across racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups. Studies have demonstrated the multiple factors that contribute to health disparities.

Cultural Competence Online for Medical Practice (CCOMP) is an attempt in the United States to address one of the factors - the patient-doctor interaction.  The CCOMP project is funded by a grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) through the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI).  CCOMP offers a clinician's guide to reduce cardiovascular disparities, intended to create effective cross-cultural approaches to care for African-American patients with [[cardiovascular disease]], especially [[hypertension]]. Videos with real patient scenarios and case-based modules are aimed at developing this increased awareness.

The '''doctor–patient relationship''' is a central part of health care and the practice of medicine. The [[physician|doctor]]–[[patient]] relationship forms one of the foundations of contemporary [[medical ethics]].

==Importance==
[[File:Doctor explains x-ray to patient.jpg|thumb|A [[medical officer]] explains an [[x-ray]] to the patient.]]
[[File:Doctor advises patient.jpg|thumb|The doctor is providing [[medical advice]] to this patient.]]
[[File:Doctor examines patient.jpg|thumb|A physician performs a standard [[physical examination]] on his patient.]]
A patient must have confidence in the competence of their physician and must feel that they can confide in him or her. For most physicians, the establishment of good [[rapport]] with a patient is important.  Some medical specialties, such as [[psychiatry]] and [[family medicine]], emphasize the physician–patient relationship more than others, such as [[pathology]] or [[radiology]], which have very little contact with patients.

The quality of the patient–physician relationship is important to both parties. The doctor and patient's values and perspectives about disease, life, and time available play a role in building up this relationship. A strong relationship between the doctor and patient will lead to frequent, quality information about the patient's disease and better health care for the patient and their family. Enhancing the accuracy of the diagnosis and increasing the patient's knowledge about the disease all come with a good relationship between the doctor and the patient. Where such a relationship is poor the physician's ability to make a full assessment is compromised and the patient is more likely to distrust the diagnosis and proposed treatment, causing decreased [[Compliance (medicine)|compliance]] to actually follow the medical advice which results in bad health outcomes. In these circumstances and also in cases where there is genuine divergence of medical opinions, a ''[[second opinion (medicine)|second opinion]]'' from another physician may be sought or the patient may choose to go to another physician that they trust more. Additionally, the benefits of any [[Placebo Effect|placebo effect]] are also based upon the patient's subjective assessment (conscious or unconscious) of the physician's credibility and skills.

[[Michael Balint|Michael]] and [[Enid Balint]] together pioneered the study of the physician patient relationship in the UK. Michael Balint's "The Doctor, His Patient and the Illness" (1957) outlined several case histories in detail and became a seminal text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Curran|first=James|date=1 November 2007|title=The Doctor, his Patient and the Illness|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/335/7626/941.2|journal=BMJ|language=en|volume=335|issue=7626|pages=941–941|doi=10.1136/bmj.39384.467928.94|issn=0959-8138|pmc=2048858}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their work is continued by the [[Balint Society]], The International Balint Federation&lt;ref name=enid&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.balintinternational.com/downloads/Balint_in_a_Nutshell.pdf |title=Balint in a nutshell |publisher=International Balint Federation |date=February 2007 |accessdate=6 December 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304042333/http://www.balintinternational.com/downloads/Balint_in_a_Nutshell.pdf |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and other national Balint societies in other countries. It is one of the most influential works on the topic of doctor-patient relationships. In addition, a Canadian physician known as [[Sir William Osler]] was known as one of the "Big Four" professors at the time that the Johns Hopkins Hospital was first founded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oslersymposia.org/about-Sir-William-Osler.html|title=About Sir William Osler, his inspirational words, and the Osler Symposia for physicians|website=www.oslersymposia.org|access-date=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the Johns Hopkins Hospital, Osler had invented the world's first [[Residency (medicine)|medical residency]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/ps/retrieve/Narrative/GF/p-nid/363|title=The William Osler Papers: "Father of Modern Medicine": The Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, 1889-1905|website=profiles.nlm.nih.gov|access-date=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of [[efficacy]] (i.e. the outcome of treatment), the doctor–patient relationship seems to have a "small, but statistically significant impact on healthcare outcomes".&lt;ref name="Kelley-2014" /&gt; However, due to a relatively small sample size and a minimally effective test, researchers concluded additional research on this topic is necessary.&lt;ref name="Kelley-2014"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kelley JM, Kraft-Todd G, Schapira L, Kossowsky J, Riess H |title=The influence of the patient-clinician relationship on healthcare outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials |journal=PLOS ONE |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=e94207 |year=2014 |pmid=24718585 |pmc=3981763 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0094207 |url=http://www.plosone.org/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0094207&amp;representation=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recognizing that patients receive the best care when they work in partnership with doctors, the UK [[General Medical Council]] issued guidance for patients "What to expect from your doctor" in April 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gmc-uk.org/guidance/patients.asp |title=What to expect from your doctor: a guide for patients |publisher=[[General Medical Council]] |accessdate=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gmc-uk.org/news/21839.asp |title=Press release: GMC publishes first guide for patients on what to expect from their doctor |publisher=General Medical Council |date=22 April 2013 |accessdate=9 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130612023116/http://www.gmc-uk.org/news/21839.asp |archivedate=12 June 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aspects of relationship==
The following aspects of the doctor–patient relationship are the subject of commentary and discussion.

===Informed consent===
{{main|Informed consent}}
The default medical practice for showing respect to patients and their families is for the doctor to be truthful in informing the patient of their health and to be direct in asking for the patient's consent before giving treatment. Historically in many cultures there has been a shift from [[paternalism]], the view that the "doctor always knows best," to the idea that patients must have a choice in the provision of their care and be given the right to provide [[informed consent]] to medical procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Restructuring Informed Consent: Legal Therapy for the Doctor-Patient Relationship | journal = The Yale Law Journal | volume = 79 | issue = 8 | doi = 10.2307/795271 | pages = 1533–1576 | year = 1970 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; There can be issues with how to handle informed consent in a doctor–patient relationship;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Selinger|first=Christine P.|title=The right to consent: Is it absolute?|journal=British Journal of Medical Practice|year=2009|volume=2|series=2|pages=50–54|url=http://www.bjmp.org/content/right-consent-it-absolute|accessdate=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; for instance, with patients who do not want to know the truth about their condition. Furthermore, there are ethical concerns regarding the use of [[placebo]]. Does giving a sugar pill lead to an undermining of trust between doctor and patient? Is deceiving a patient for his or her own good compatible with a respectful and consent-based doctor–patient relationship?&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lichtenberg | first1 = P. | last2 = Heresco-Levy | first2 = U. | last3 = Nitzan | first3 = U. | doi = 10.1136/jme.2002.002832 | title = The ethics of the placebo in clinical practice | journal = Journal of Medical Ethics | volume = 30 | issue = 6 | pages = 551–554 | year = 2004 | pmid =  15574442| pmc =1733989 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These types of questions come up frequently in the healthcare system and the answers to all of these questions are usually far from clear but should be informed by [[medical ethics]].

===Shared decision making===
[[File:Choosing Wisely antibiotics poster small English.pdf|thumb|right|[[Health advocacy]] messages such as this one encourage patients to talk with their doctors about their healthcare.]]
{{main|Shared decision making}}
Shared decision making is the idea that as a patient gives informed consent to treatment, that patient also is given an opportunity to choose among the treatment options provided by the physician that is responsible for their healthcare. This means the doctor does not recommend what the patient should do, rather the patient's autonomy is respected and they choose what medical treatment they want to have done. A practice which is an alternative to this is for the doctor to make a person's health decisions without considering that person's treatment goals or having that person's input into the decision-making process is grossly unethical and against the idea of personal autonomy and freedom.

The spectrum of a physician’s inclusion of a patient into treatment decisions is well represented in [[Ulrich Beck|Ulrich Beck’s]] ''World at Risk''. At one end of this spectrum is Beck’s Negotiated Approach to risk communication, in which the communicator maintains an open dialogue with the patient and settles on a compromise on which both patient and physician agree. A majority of physicians employ a variation of this communication model to some degree, as it is only with this technique that a doctor can maintain the open cooperation of his or her patient. At the opposite end of this spectrum is the Technocratic Approach to risk communication, in which the physician exerts authoritarian control over the patient’s treatment and pushes the patient to accept the treatment plan with which they are presented in a paternalistic manner. This communication model places the physician in a position of omniscience and omnipotence over the patient and leaves little room for patient contribution to a treatment plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beck|first1=Ulrich|title=World at Risk|pages=81–180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physician superiority===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}

The physician may be viewed as superior to the patient simply because physicians tend to use big words and concepts to put him or herself in a position above the patient. The physician–patient relationship is also complicated by the patient's suffering (''patient'' derives from the Latin ''patior'', "suffer") and limited ability to relieve it on his or her own, potentially resulting in a state of desperation and dependency on the physician. A physician should be aware of these disparities in order to establish a good [[rapport]] and optimize communication with the patient. Additionally, having a clear perception of these disparities can go a long way to helping the patient in the future treatment. It may be further beneficial for the doctor–patient relationship to have a form of [[shared care]] with [[patient empowerment]] to take a major degree of responsibility for her or his care.

Those who go to a doctor typically do not know exact medical reasons of why they are there, which is why they go to a doctor in the first place. For a patient to not be able to understand what is going on with their body, because they can’t understand lab results or their doctor isn’t sharing or explaining them, can be a frightening and frustrating situation to be in. An in depth discussion of lab results and the certainty that the patient can understand them may lead to the patient feeling reassured, and with that may bring positive outcomes in the physician-patient relationship.

===Benefiting or pleasing===
A dilemma may arise in situations where determining the most efficient treatment, or encountering avoidance of treatment, creates a disagreement between the physician and the patient, for any number of reasons. In such cases, the physician needs strategies for presenting unfavorable treatment options or unwelcome information in a way that minimizes strain on the doctor–patient relationship while benefiting the patient's overall physical health and best interests. When the patient either can not or will not do what the physician knows is the correct course of treatment, the patient becomes non-adherent. [[Adherence management coaching]] becomes necessary to provide positive reinforcement of unpleasant options.

For example, according to a Scottish study,&lt;ref name=McKinstry&gt;{{cite journal |author=McKinstry B |title=Should general practitioners call patients by their first names? |journal=BMJ |volume=301 |issue=6755 |pages=795–6 |date=October 1990 |pmid=2224269 |pmc=1663948 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.301.6755.795|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; patients want to be addressed by their first name more often than is currently the case. In this study, most of the patients either liked (223) or did not mind (175) being called by their first names. Only 77 individuals disliked being called by their first name, most of whom were aged over 65.&lt;ref name=McKinstry/&gt; On the other hand, most patients do not want to call the doctor by his or her first name.&lt;ref name=McKinstry/&gt;

Some familiarity with the doctor generally makes it easier for patients to talk about intimate issues such as sexual subjects, but for some patients, a very high degree of familiarity may make the patient reluctant to reveal such intimate issues.&lt;ref name=Quilliam2011&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Quilliam |first1=Susan |date=April 2011 |title=‘The Cringe Report’: why patients don't dare ask questions, and what we can do about that |journal=J Fam Plann Reprod Health Care |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=110–112 |pmid=21454267 |doi=10.1136/jfprhc.2011.0060 |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/743689_3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transitional care===
[[Transitional care|Transitions]] of patients between health care practitioners may decrease the quality of care in the time it takes to reestablish proper doctor–patient relationships. Generally, the doctor–patient relationship is facilitated by [[health care continuity|continuity of care]] in regard to attending personnel. Special strategies of [[integrated care]] may be required where multiple health care providers are involved, including ''[[horizontal integration]]'' (linking similar levels of care, e.g. multiprofessional teams) and ''vertical integration'' (linking different levels of care, e.g. primary, secondary and tertiary care).&lt;ref name="Grone"&gt;Gröne, O &amp; Garcia-Barbero, M (2002): Trends in Integrated Care – Reflections on Conceptual Issues. World Health Organization, Copenhagen, 2002, EUR/02/5037864&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Turn-taking and conversational dominance ===
The process of [[turn-taking]] between health care professionals and the patients has a profound impact on the relationship between them. In most scenarios, a doctor will walk into the room in which the patient is being held and will ask a variety of questions involving the patient's history, examination, and [[Medical diagnosis|diagnosis]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/understanding-and-applying-medical-anthropology/oclc/37442599|title=Understanding and applying medical anthropology|last=Brown|first=Peter J|date=1 January 1998|publisher=Mayfield Pub. Co.|isbn=1559347236|location=Mountain View, Calif.|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are often the foundation of the relationship between the doctor and the patient as this interaction tends to be the first they have together. This can go a long way into impacting the future of the relationship throughout the patient's care. All [[speech act]]s between individuals seek to accomplish the same goal, sharing and exchanging information and meeting each participants conversational goals.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Research carried out in medical scenarios analyzed 188 situations in which an interruption occurred between a physician and a patient. Of these 188 analyzed situations, research found that the doctor is much more likely (67% of the time, 126 occasions) as compared to the patient (33% of the time, 62 occasions).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This shows that physicians are practicing a form of conversational dominance in which they see themselves as far superior to the patient in terms of importance and knowledge and therefore dominate all aspects of the conversation. A question that comes to mind considering this is if interruptions hinder or improve the condition of the patient. Constant interruptions from the patient whilst the doctor is discussing treatment options and diagnoses can be detrimental or lead to less effective efforts in patient treatment. This is extremely important to take note of as it is something that can be addressed in quite a simple manner. This research conducted on doctor-patient interruptions also indicates that males are much more likely to interject out of turn in a conversation then women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This can also lead to problems if a female physician is trying to convey messages as females statistically tend to interrupt in conversations less often than their male counterparts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Other involved individuals===
An example of where other people present in a doctor–patient encounter may influence their communication is one or more parents present at a [[Minor (law)|minor]]'s visit to a doctor. These may provide psychological support for the patient, but in some cases it may compromise the [[Physician–patient privilege|doctor–patient confidentiality]] and inhibit the patient from disclosing uncomfortable or intimate subjects.

When visiting a health provider about sexual issues, having both partners of a couple present is often necessary, and is typically a good thing, but may also prevent the disclosure of certain subjects, and, according to one report, increases the stress level.&lt;ref name=Quilliam2011/&gt;

Having family around when dealing with difficult medical circumstances or treatments can also lead to complications. Family members, in addition to the patient needing treatment may disagree on the treatment needing to be done. This can lead to tension and discomfort for the patient and the doctor, putting further strain on the relationship.

==Bedside manner==
[[File:Blood test (1).jpg|thumb|The medical doctor, with a [[nurse]] by his side, is performing a [[Blood testing|blood test]] at a hospital in 1980.]]
A good bedside manner is typically one that reassures and comforts the patient while remaining honest about a diagnosis. Vocal tones, [[body language]], openness, presence, honesty, and concealment of attitude may all affect bedside manner. Poor bedside manner leaves the patient feeling unsatisfied, worried, frightened, or alone. Bedside manner becomes difficult when a healthcare professional must explain an unfavorable diagnosis to the patient, while keeping the patient from being alarmed.

Dr. Rita Charon launched the narrative medicine movement in 2001 with an article in the Journal of the American Medical Association.  In the article she claimed that better understanding the patient's narrative could lead to better medical care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Talan|first1=Jamie|title=Storytelling for Doctors' Medical Schools Try Teaching Compassion by Having Students Write About Patients|agency=Newsday|date=27 May 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers and Ph.D.s in a ''BMC Medical Education'' journal conducted a recent study that resulted in five key conclusions about the needs of patients from their health care providers. First, patients want their providers to provide reassurance. Second, patients feel anxious asking their providers questions; they want their providers to tell them it’s ok to ask questions. Third, patients want to see their lab results and for the doctor to explain what they mean. Fourth,  patients simply do not want to feel judged by their providers. And fifth, patients want to be participants in medical decision-making; they want providers to ask them what they want.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bmcmededuc.biomedcentral.com/|title=BMC Medical Education|website=BMC Medical Education|language=en|access-date=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of how body language affects patient perception of care is that the time spent with the patient in the [[emergency department]] is perceived as longer if the doctor sits down during the encounter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/743875?src=mp&amp;spon=25 Simple Tips to Improve Patient Satisfaction] By Michael Pulia. American Academy of Emergency Medicine. 2011;18(1):18–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples in fiction===
{{refimprove section|date=July 2017}}
* [[Greg House|Dr. Gregory House]] (of the show ''[[House (TV Series)|House]]'') has an acerbic, insensitive bedside manner. However, this is an extension of his normal personality.
* In ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'', [[Preston Burke|Dr. Burke]] compliments [[George O'Malley|Dr. George O'Malley]]'s ability to care for Dr. Bailey's baby by saying "it speaks to a good bedside manner."
* Doc Martin from the ''[[Doc Martin]]'' British TV series is a good example of a physician with a bad bedside manner.
* [[Characters of Casualty#Lily Chao|Dr Lily Chao]] from the British TV series ''[[Casualty (TV series)|Casualty]]'' is another example of a Foundation Doctor with a poor bedside manner, whereas her colleague, [[characters of casualty#Ethan Hardy|Dr Ethan Hardy]] has a better one.
* In ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'', [[Hugo "Hurley" Reyes|Hurley]] tells [[Jack Shephard]]  that his bedside manner "sucks". Later in the episode, Jack is told by his father to put more hope into his sayings, which he does when operating on his future wife. The comments continue in other episodes of the series with [[Benjamin Linus]] sarcastically telling Jack that his "bedside manner leaves something to be desired" after Jack gives him a harsh negative diagnosis.
* In ''[[Closer (play)|Closer]]'', Larry, the physician tells Anna when they first meet that he is famed for his bedside manner.
* In ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'', [[J.D. (Scrubs)|J.D]] is presented as an example of a physician with great bedside manner, while [[Elliot Reid]] is a physician with bad or non-existent bedside manner at first, until she evolves during her tenure at Sacred Heart. [[Dr. Cox]] is an interesting subversion, in that his manner is brash and undiplomatic while still inspiring patients to do their own best to aid in the healing process, akin to a drill sergeant. This show also comically remarked that the most amount of time that a doctor needs to be in the presence of the patient before he finds out everything he needs to know is approximately 15 seconds.
* In ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'', [[Doctor (Star Trek)|the Doctor]] often compliments himself on the charming bedside manner he developed with the help of [[Kes (Star Trek)|Kes]].
* In ''[[M*A*S*H]]'', [[Hawkeye Pierce]], [[Trapper John McIntyre]], [[B.J. Hunnicutt]], and [[Sherman Potter]] all possess a caring and humorous bedside manner meant to help patients cope with traumatic injuries. [[Charles Winchester]] initially possesses no real bedside manner, acting with detached professionalism, until the rigors of his job help him develop a sense of compassion for his patients. [[Frank Burns (M*A*S*H character)|Frank Burns]] has a poor bedside manner, constantly minimizing the seriousness of his patients' injuries, accusing them of cowardice and goading them to return to the front lines.

==Patient behavior==
The behavior of the patient affects the doctor–patient relationship.  Rude or aggressive behavior from patients or their family members can also distract healthcare professionals and cause them to be less effective or to make mistakes during a medical procedure. When dealing with situations in any healthcare setting, there is stress on the medical staff to do their job effectively. Whilst many factors can affect how their job gets done, rude patients and unappealing attitudes can play a big role. Research carried out by Dr. Pete Hamburger, associate dean for research at [[Tel Aviv University]], evidences this fact. His research showed that rude and harsh attitudes shown toward the medical staff reduced their ability to effectively carry out some of their simpler and more procedural tasks. This is important because if the medical staff are not performing sufficiently in what should be simple tasks, their ability to work effectively in [[critical condition]]s will also be impaired.While it is completely understandable that patients are going through an extremely tough time compounded by stress from other external and internal factors, it is important for the doctors and medical staff to be wary of the rude attitudes that may come their way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/27/well/family/what-happens-when-parents-are-rude-in-the-hospital.html|title=What Happens When Parents Are Rude in the Hospital|last=Klass|first=Perri|date=27 February 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=2 March 2017|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Riskin|first=Arieh|last2=Erez|first2=Amir|last3=Foulk|first3=Trevor A.|last4=Riskin-Geuz|first4=Kinneret S.|last5=Ziv|first5=Amitai|last6=Sela|first6=Rina|last7=Pessach-Gelblum|first7=Liat|last8=Bamberger|first8=Peter A.|date=1 February 2017|title=Rudeness and Medical Team Performance|journal=Pediatrics|volume=139|issue=2|doi=10.1542/peds.2016-2305|issn=1098-4275|pmid=28073958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goosby&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and has previously served as the [[Global AIDS Coordinator (U.S.)|United States Global AIDS Coordinator]] from 2009 until mid-November 2013. As US Global AIDS coordinator, Goosby directed the U.S. strategy for addressing HIV around the world and led President Obama's implementation of the [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief]] (PEPFAR). Goosby was sworn in &lt;!-- not a mistake--&gt;in June 2009 and resigned in November 2013, taking a position as a professor at UCSF, where he directs the UCSF-UC Berkeley Institute of Global Health Delivery &amp; Diplomacy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pepfar.gov/press/releases/2009/125246.htm Dr. Eric Goosby Assumes the Role of U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://globalhealthsciences.ucsf.edu/research/global-health-delivery-and-diplomacy Global Health Delivery and Diplomacy | Global Health Sciences&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Goosby received his [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] (1978) from the [[University of California, San Francisco]], where he also completed his residency (1981). Goosby then completed a two-year Kaiser Fellowship at UCSF in General Internal Medicine with a subspecialty in Infectious Diseases.(1983).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucsfhealth.org/adult/cgi-bin/prd.cgi?action=DISPLAYDOCTOR&amp;doctorid=38814 Eric Goosby Educational History]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
Goosby has over 25 years experience working in the field of [[HIV/AIDS]]. Goosby treated patients at San Francisco General Hospital when HIV/AIDS first began to emerge and take its toll in the early 1980s. In 1986, he served as the AIDS activity division attending physician, and in 1987 was appointed associate medical director of San Francisco General Hospital's AIDS Clinic. During his time at San Francisco General, he helped develop effective models for HIV/AIDS clinical care for intravenous drug users, establishing three medical facilities located in methadone treatment centers.&lt;ref name="state.gov"&gt;[https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/biog/125483.htm We're sorry, that page can't be found&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government service==
[[File:Dr. Eric Goosby, U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator, UN Geneva Press Conference.jpg|thumb|right|Goosby at a Press Conference at the United Nations Office in Geneva, December 11, 2009]]
In 1991, Goosby began his government career as director of HIV Services at the [[Health Resources and Services Administration]], in the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]]. In this position, he administered the newly authorized [[Ryan White Care Act]], overseeing the distribution of federal funds and the planning of services in 25 AIDS epicenters, as well as in all 50 states and U.S. territories. In 1994, Goosby became director of the Office of HIV/AIDS Policy in the Department of Health and Human Services where he advised on the federal HIV/AIDS budget and worked with Congress on all AIDS-related issues.

In 1995, Goosby created and convened the DHHS Panel on Clinical Practices for the Treatment of HIV Infections. This panel defined how to use protease inhibitors in conjunction with already existing antiretrovirals, later expanding its work to address standards of care for antiretroviral use for pediatric patients and pregnant women. Dr. Goosby has remained actively involved in this panel, now known the DHHS Panel on Antiretroviral Guidelines for Adults and Adolescents, which is widely recognized as defining the standard of care for HIV/AIDS treatment in the United States.

In 1997, Goosby also served as interim director of the National AIDS Policy Office at the White House, reporting directly to the President as his senior advisor on HIV-related issues.  In 1998, he helped to foster and orchestrate the dialogue on racial disparities in HIV/AIDS that led to the Minority AIDS Initiative.  Dr. Goosby's office was responsible for guiding the implementation of this initiative at HHS over the next three years.  Dr. Goosby's office also coordinated scientific reviews of needle exchange as a public health intervention. In 2000, Goosby served as acting deputy director of the National AIDS Policy Office in the White House, while continuing to work as director of HIV/AIDS policy at the Department of Health and Human Services.&lt;ref name="state.gov"/&gt;

==International work==
After leaving government service, Goosby was CEO and Chief Medical Officer of Pangaea Global AIDS Foundation from 2001 to 2009.  He was also a Professor of Clinical Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco and a clinical provider for the 360 Men of Color Program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://positivehealth.ucsf.edu/about/bios/goosby.aspx 360 Men of Color, Eric Goosby]&lt;/ref&gt;

While with Pangaea, Dr. Goosby played a key role in the development and/or implementation of HIV/AIDS national treatment scale-up plans in Rwanda, South Africa, China, and Ukraine. During this time, Dr. Goosby developed extensive international experience in the development of treatment guidelines for use of antiretroviral therapies, clinical mentoring and training of health professionals, and the design and implementation of local models of care for HIV/AIDS, focusing his expertise on the scale-up of sustainable HIV/AIDS treatment capacity, including the delivery of HIV antiretroviral drugs, within existing healthcare systems.&lt;ref name="state.gov"/&gt;

On January 20, 2015, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon appointed Eric Goosby of the United States as his new Special Envoy on Tuberculosis (TB). In this capacity, Dr. Goosby will work towards boosting the profile of the fight against TB and promoting the adoption, financing and implementation of the UN World Health Organization’s (WHO) global End TB Strategy after 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.un.org/press/en/2015/sga1540.doc.htm|title = Secretary-General Appoints Eric Goosby of United States as United Nations Special Envoy on Tuberculosis |publisher=[[United Nations]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, he will push for the achievement of the Strategy’s “ambitious international targets” for tuberculosis prevention, care and control while also pursuing the TB 2015 targets described in the Millennium Development Goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UN News Centre|website=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=49857#.VME_WsaRK9s|accessdate=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goosby has served on the board of directors of the [[Clinton Foundation]] since 2013.&lt;ref name="clintonfoundationboard"&gt;{{cite web|title=Board of Directors|url=https://www.clintonfoundation.org/about/board-directors#CherylSaban|website=Clinton Foundation|accessdate=October 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==PEPFAR==
On June 23, 2009, Goosby was sworn in as the United States Global AIDS Coordinator, heading up the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). At the time of his swearing in, Goosby stated that his top priorities included:&lt;ref&gt;[http://today.ucsf.edu/stories/global-aids-chief-goosby-talks-goals-challenges-policy-changes/ UCSF’s Goosby Discusses Priorities and Challenges as New Global AIDS Chief]&lt;/ref&gt;

==About ESMO==

The '''European Society for Medical Oncology''' ('''ESMO''') is the leading professional organisation for medical oncology. With 20,000 members representing oncology professionals from over 150 countries worldwide, ESMO is the society of reference for oncology education and information. ESMO is committed to offer the best care to people with cancer, through fostering integrated cancer care, supporting oncologists in their professional development, and advocating for sustainable cancer care worldwide.

Founded in 1975, ESMO has European roots with a global reach. Home for all oncology stakeholders, ESMO connects professionals with diverse expertise and experience. Its education and information resources support an integrated multi-professional approach to cancer care, from a medical oncology perspective. ESMO seeks to erase boundaries in cancer care, whether between countries or specialities, and pursue its mission across oncology, worldwide.

==ESMO's Mission==
The mission of the Society is to:
*'''improve the quality''' of prevention, diagnosis, treatment, supportive and palliative care, as well as the follow-up of patients with malignant disorders
*'''advance''' the art, science, recognition, and practice of '''oncology'''
*'''disseminate knowledge''' in oncology to cancer patients and the public
*'''educate and train''' persons involved in clinical cancer care and research
*'''promote education''' in oncology in order to ensure a high standard of qualification of medical oncologists within the multidisciplinary team
*'''facilitate equal access''' to optimal cancer care for all cancer patients
*'''maintain liaisons''' with other oncology specialties, cancer leagues, universities, patient groups and, where appropriate, the pharmaceutical industry

==Annals of Oncology==

Founded in 1990, ESMO’s flagship scientific journal, [[Annals of Oncology]], publishes articles addressing medical oncology, surgery, radiotherapy, pediatric oncology, basic research and the comprehensive management of patients with malignant diseases. [[Annals of Oncology]] is the official journal of ESMO and from 2008 of the Japanese Society for Medical Oncology (JSMO)

==ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines==

The ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) are intended to provide oncology professionals with a set of recommendations for the best standards of cancer care, based on the findings of evidence-based medicine. Each Clinical Practice Guideline includes information on the incidence of the malignancy, diagnostic criteria, staging of disease and risk assessment, treatment plans and follow-up designed to help oncologists deliver an appropriate quality of care to their patients.

The '''Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain''' ('''FASFC''') is an authority tasked with ensuring the [[Food quality|quality]] and [[Food safety|safety of foodstuffs]] in [[Belgium]], and safeguarding [[Plant health|plant]], [[animal health|animal]] and [[human health]] this way. It controls and inspects all processes in the [[food industry]] "from farm to fork", meaning all food production, [[food processing]], [[food distribution]] and [[food service]]. With food safety in mind, the agency is also responsible for combating animal and [[Plant pathology|plant diseases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.favv.be/thematischepublicaties/_documents/2016-01-21_AFSCA_service_public_nl_versie6.pdf|format=pdf|title=Het FAVV tot uw dienst|language=Dutch|trans-title=The FASFC at your service|date=January 2018|access-date=25 July 2018|publisher=Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organisation ==
The agency is an 'organism of public interest' ([[public body|parastatal body]]) type A according to Belgian [[public law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/eli/wet/2000/02/04/2000022108/justel|title=Wet van 4 februari 2000 houdende oprichting van het federaal Agentschap voor de Veiligheid van de voedselketen|language=Dutch|trans-title=Law of 4 February 2000 concerning the establishment of the federal Agency for the Safety of the food chain|date=18 February 2000|access-date=25 July 2018|publisher=[[Belgian official journal|Belgian Official Journal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded after the [[dioxin affair]] rocked Belgium in 1999, which was caused by the use of [[animal feed]] contaminated with [[polychlorinated biphenyl]]s. Through the [[food chain]], the toxic contamination made its way to [[supermarket]]s and consumers, inciting a nationwide scandal when it was discovered. At its foundation, the agency inherited all [[inspection|inspection tasks]] related to food safety from the relevant services of the federal Ministry of Social Affairs, Public Health and Environment, and of the federal Ministry of Agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.afsca.be/jaarverslagen/_documents/jaarverslag2000.pdf|format=pdf|title=Federaal Agentschap voor de Veiligheid van de Voedselketen (FAVV) – Jaarverslag 2000 aan het Parlement|language=Dutch|trans-title=Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain (FASFC) – Annual report 2000 to Parliament|date=31 July 2001|access-date=25 July 2018|publisher=Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain|author=Luc Beernaert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anno 2018, the agency operates under the authority of the [[Minister of Agriculture (Belgium)|Belgian federal minister of Agriculture]].

'''''Ganoderma tsugae''''', also known as '''Hemlock varnish shelf''', is a flat [[polypore]] mushroom of the genus ''[[Ganoderma]]''. 

==Habit==
In contrast to ''[[Lingzhi_mushroom|Ganoderma lucidum]]'', to which it is closely related and which it closely resembles, ''G. tsugae'' tends to grow on [[conifer]]s, especially [[tsuga|hemlock]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Kuo, M., MushroomExpert.Com, [http://www.mushroomexpert.com/ganoderma_tsugae.html ''Ganoderma tsugae'']. (2004, February). Retrieved June 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Properties==
Like ''G. lucidum'', ''G. tsugae'' is said to have medicinal properties including use for dressing a skin wound.&lt;ref&gt;Ching-Hua Su1, et al., [[Taipei Medical University]], [http://knowledge.biotec.or.th/doc_upload/200412115910.doc Sacchachitin, a Skin Wound Dressing Material from ''Ganoderma tsugae''], 2004. Retrieved June 16, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Phylogenetic analysis]] has begun to better differentiate between many closely related species of ''Ganoderma'';&lt;ref&gt;Soon Gyu Hong, Hack Sung Jung, [http://www.mycologia.org/cgi/content/full/96/4/742 Phylogenetic analysis of ''Ganoderma'' based on nearly complete mitochondrial small-subunit ribosomal DNA sequences], ''Mycologia'' July/August 2004 vol. 96 no. 4 742&amp;ndash;55.&lt;/ref&gt; however, there is still disagreement as to which have the most medicinal properties. In addition, variations within the same species as well as the growth substrate and environmental conditions all the way through to preparation can have a substantial effect on the medicinal value of the product{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}.

==Edibility==
Like ''G. lucidum'', ''G. tsugae'' is non-poisonous but generally considered inedible, because of its solid woody nature; however, teas and extracts made from its fruiting bodies allow medicinal use of the compounds it contains. A hot water extraction or tea can be very effective for extracting the [[polysaccharide]]s; however, an alcohol or alcohol/glycerin extraction method is more effective for the [[triterpenoid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Emberger, [[Messiah College]], [http://www.messiah.edu/Oakes/fungi_on_wood/poroid%20fungi/species%20pages/Ganoderma%20tsugae.htm ''Ganoderma tsugae''], 2006. Retrieved June 16, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medicinal use==
Studies in mice has shown that ''G. tsugae'' shows several potential medicinal benefits including anti-tumor activity through some of the active polysaccharides found in ''G. tsugae''&lt;ref&gt;Mizuno T, Wang G, Zhang J et al: Reishi, Ganoderma lucidum and Ganoderma tsugae: bioactive substances and medicinal effects. Food Rev Intl 1995; 11(1):151-166&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mayuzumi I, Okamoto H &amp; Li J: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7765245 Antitumor active protein-containing glycans from the Chinese mushroom songshan lingzhi, Ganoderma tsugae mycelium]. Biosci Biotechnol Biochem 1994; 58(7):1202-1205.&lt;/ref&gt;
''G. tsugae'' has also been shown to significantly promote wound healing in mice as well as significantly increase the proliferation and migration of [[fibroblast cells]] in culture.&lt;ref&gt;Su CH, Sun CS, Juan SW et al: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9916772 Development of fungal mycelia as skin substitutes: effects on wound healing and fibroblast]. Biomaterials 1999; 20(1):61-68.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''HeRAMS''' ('''Health Resources Availability Mapping System''') is an electronic system for monitoring medical resources. It is a [[World Health Organization|WHO]] tool for standardizing and assessing the availability of medical services in different countries. It is mostly used for emergency response.&lt;ref name="ВООЗ_заг"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/hac/herams/en/ |title=Health Resources Availability Monitoring System (HeRAMS) |trans-title= |date= |author1= |authorlink1= |publisher=[[World Health Organization|WHO]] |editor= |pages= |language= |accessdate=January 4, 2018 |archiveurl= |archivedate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== General information ==
When conducting programs using HeRAMS, information is collected from health facilities in a specific area. Then the analysis of the received data is carried out.

The system collects information on four major contingencies related to emergencies:
* health care establishments (number, type ...);
* resources for the provision of services (water supply, [[cold chain]] ...);
* availability of medical services in certain spheres (emergency medicine at the pre-hospital and hospital stages, trauma care...);
* the reasons for the lack of medical services (lack of medical staff, poor training ...).

Based on the findings, WHO, in collaboration with local health ministries, makes analytical reports and develops possible measures to improve the situation.&lt;ref name="ВООЗ_заг"/&gt;

== Individual projects ==
WHO pays the greatest attention to countries with destroyed infrastructure, including medical ones.The evaluation was conducted in [[Sudan]],&lt;ref name="Судан"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emro.who.int/images/stories/sudan/documents/special_reports/herams_annual_2013.pdf?ua=1 |title=HeRAMS Sudan: Annual report 2013 |trans-title= |date= |author1= |authorlink1= |publisher=[[World Health Organization|WHO]] |editor= |pages= |language= |access-date=31 December 2017 |archiveurl= |archivedate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ОЧА_Дарфур"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/sudan-health-resources-availability-mapping-system-herams |title=Sudan: Health Resources Availability Mapping System (HeRAMS) |trans-title=|date=July 4, 2010 |author1= |authorlink1= |publisher=[[United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs|OCHA]] |editor= |pages= |language= |accessdate=January 4, 2018 |archiveurl= |archivedate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mali]],&lt;ref name="ВООЗ_Малі"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/hac/crises/mli/executive_summary_herams_mali_18december2013.pdf |title=HeRAMS Mali – executive summary |trans-title= |date=December 2013 |author1= |authorlink1= |publisher=[[World Health Organization|WHO]] |editor= |pages= |language= |accessdate=January 4, 2018 |archiveurl= |archivedate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philippines]],&lt;ref name="ВООЗ_Філ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wpro.who.int/philippines/mediacentre/features/typhoon_yolanda_one_year_on_main/en/ |title=Typhoon Yolanda: One Year On photo story |trans-title= |date= |author1= |authorlink1= |publisher=[[World Health Organization|WHO]] |editor= |pages= |language= |accessdate=January 4, 2018 |archiveurl= |archivedate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Central African Republic]],&lt;ref name="ОЧА_ЦАР"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.humanitarianresponse.info/en/operations/central-african-republic/document/rca-health-resources-availability-monitoring-system |title=RCA-WHO- Rapport de l'enquête HeRAMS 2016 |trans-title= |date= |author1= |authorlink1= |publisher=[[United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs|OCHA]] |editor= |pages= |language= |access-date=January 4, 2018 |archiveurl= |archivedate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ОЧА_ЦАР2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://reliefweb.int/report/central-african-republic/central-african-republic-special-information-brief-9-months-after-l3 |title=Central African Republic Special Information Brief 9 Months after L3 Declaration - 15 September 2014 |trans-title= |date=September 15, 2017 |author1= |authorlink1= |publisher=[[United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs|OCHA]] |editor= |pages= |language= |access-date=January 4, 2018 |archiveurl= |archivedate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Syria]],&lt;ref name="Сирія"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emro.who.int/syr/herams/index.html |title=Syrian Arab Republic.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40636">The discovery of [[disease]]-causing [[pathogen]]s is an important activity in the field of medical science.  Many [[virus]]es, [[bacteria]], [[protozoa]], [[fungi]], [[helminthes]] and [[prion]]s are identified as a confirmed or potential pathogen. In the United States, a [[Centers for Disease Control]] program, begun in 1995, identified over a hundred patients with life-threatening illnesses that were considered to be of an [[Infection|infectious]] cause, but that could not be linked to a known pathogen.&lt;ref name="DAY_1997"/&gt;  The association of pathogens with disease can be a complex and controversial process, in some cases requiring decades or even centuries to achieve.

==Factors impairing identification of pathogens==
Factors which have been identified as impeding the identification of pathogens include the following:

:'''1. Lack of animal models''': Experimental infection in animals has been used as a criterion to demonstrate a disease-causing ability, but for some pathogens (such as ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'', which cause disease only in humans) animal models do not exist. In cases where animal models were not available, scientists have sometimes infected themselves or others to determine an organism's disease causing ability.&lt;ref name=autobiography&gt;{{cite web  | last =Barry   | first =Marshall  | title =Autobiography  | publisher =[[Nobel Foundation]]  | year =2005  | url =http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2005/marshall-autobio.html  | accessdate = 2007-01-28 | authorlink = Barry Marshall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:'''2. Pre-existing theories of disease''': Before a pathogen is well-recognized, scientists may attribute the symptoms of infection to other causes, such as [[Toxicology|toxicological]], [[Psychosomatic illness|psychological]], or [[Genetics|genetic]] causes. Once a pathogen has been associated with an illness, researchers have reported difficulty displacing these pre-existing theories.&lt;ref name="MARSHALL_2002"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Marshall  | first = Barry  | title = Helicobacter Pioneers: Firsthand Accounts from the Scientists who Discovered Helicobacters, 1892-1982  | publisher = Blackwell Publishing Limited  | date = May 1, 2002  | isbn = 978-0-86793-035-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BENT_1995"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bentivoglio M, Pacini P |title=Filippo Pacini: a determined observer |journal=Brain Res.

===''Vibrio cholera'' (1849-1884)===

Vibrio cholera bacteria are transmitted through contaminated water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=WHO|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs107/en/ | title=WOrld Health Organisation factsheet}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once ingested, the bacteria colonizes the intestinal tract of the host and produces a toxin which causes body fluids to flow across the lining of the intestine. Death can result in 2–3 hours from dehydration if no treatment is provided.&lt;ref name="RYAN_2004"&gt;{{cite book | last=Ryan | first=KJ | title=Sherris Medical Microbiology, 4th ed | publisher=McGraw Hill | year=2004 | pages=276–7 | isbn=978-0-8385-8529-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the discovery of an infectious cause, the symptoms of [[cholera]] were thought to be caused by an excess of bile in the patient;&lt;ref name="CHAPIN_2006"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = Shapin  | first = S  | title = Sick City:Maps and Morbidity in the Time of CHolera  | journal = New Yorker  | date = 2006-11-06  | url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/11/06/061106crbo_books  }}&lt;/ref&gt; the disease cholera gets its name from the Greek word ''[[choler]]'' meaning bile. This theory was consistent with [[humorism]], and led to such medical practices as [[bloodletting]].&lt;ref name="CHAPIN_2006" /&gt; The bacterium was first reported in 1849 by [[Gabriel Pouchet]], who discovered it in [[human faeces|stools]] from patients with cholera, but he did not appreciate the significance of this presence.&lt;ref name="BULLOCH_1979"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Bulloch  | first = William   | title = The History of Bacteriology  | journal = Nature   | volume = 142   | issue = 3600   | year=1979  | pages=771-773  | isbn=978-0-486-23761-9| bibcode = 1938Natur.142..771D   | doi = 10.1038/142771a0   }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first scientist to understand the significance of ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'' was the Italian anatomist [[Filippo Pacini]], who published detailed drawings of the organism in "Microscopical observations and pathological deductions on cholera" in 1854.&lt;ref name="BENT_1995" /&gt; He published further papers in 1866, 1871, 1876 and 1880, which were ignored by the scientific community.&lt;ref name="BENT_1995" /&gt;  He correctly described how the bacteria caused diarrhea, and developed treatments that were found to be effective.&lt;ref name="BENT_1995" /&gt; Whilst [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]]'s edpidemiology maps were well recognised, and led to the removal of the Broad Street pump handle, e.g. [[1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak]]. In 1874, scientific representatives from 21 countries voted unanimously to resolve that cholera was caused by environmental toxins from ''[[Miasma theory of disease|miasmatas]]'', or clouds of unhealthy substances which float in the air.&lt;ref name="HOWARD-JONES_1984"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Howard-Jones N |title=Robert Koch and the cholera vibrio: a centenary |journal=British Medical Journal (Clinical Research Ed.) |volume=288 |issue=6414 |pages=379–81 |year=1984 |pmid=6419937 |doi=10.1136/bmj.288.6414.379 |pmc=1444283}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1884, [[Robert Koch]] re-discovered ''Vibrio cholerae'' as a causal element in [[cholera]]. Some scientists opposed the new theory, and even drank cholera cultures to disprove it:

{{"
|Koch announced his discovery of the cholera vibrio in 1884. His conclusions were based upon the constant finding of the peculiar "comma bacillus" in the stools of cholera patients, and the failure to demonstrate this organism in the feces of other persons. It was not possible to reproduce typical cholera in laboratory animals. At the time the "germ theory" of disease had not yet obtained general acceptance, and Koch's announcement was received with considerable skepticism, particularly after it was found that similar "comma bacilli" could be found at times in the feces of persons not suffering from cholera, and often in all sorts of other environments - well and river waters, cheese, etc. We now know that these were saprotrophic species of Vibrio, which may be differentiated from the cholera vibrio by cultural and immunological methods. But the correctness of Koch's opinion was dramatically demonstrated by von Pettenkofer and Emmerich who, doubting the etiological relationship of Koch's organisms, deliberately drank cultures of it. Von Pettenkofer developed merely a transient diarrhea, but Emmerich suffered from a typical and severe attack of cholera. 
|by A. T. Henrici, ''The Biology of Bacteria'', DC Heath and Company, 1939. ASIN B00085GABK, 
}}

Von Pettenkofer considered his experience proof that ''Vibrio cholerae'' was harmless, as he did not develop cholera from consuming the culture.  Between 1849 when Pouchet discovered ''Vibrio cholerae'' and 1891, over a million people died in cholera epidemics in Europe and Russia.&lt;ref name="STITT_1922"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Stitt  | first = Edward  | title = The Diagnosis and Treatment of Tropical Diseases  | publisher = P. Blakiston's Son, Philadelphia| year = 1922 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1995, researchers published a study in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' explaining why some persons are able to be infected with cholera without symptoms, possibly explaining why Pettenkofer did not get sick.&lt;ref name="GABE_1994" /&gt;  The study showed that a series of genetic mutations in some people provide resistance to cholera toxin; but these mutations come at a price. If too many of them occur in a person, they will develop [[cystic fibrosis]], an incurable and often fatal genetic disorder.

==20th-century discoveries==

===''Giardia lamblia'' (1681-1975)===

Giardiasis is a disease caused by infection with the protozoan ''[[Giardia lamblia]]''.  Infection with ''[[Giardia]]'' can produce diarrhea, gas, and abdominal pain in some people. If untreated, infection can be chronic. In children, chronic ''[[Giardia]]'' infection can cause [[Stunted growth|stunting]] (stunted growth) and lowered intelligence,&lt;ref name="ALI_2003"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ali SA, Hill DR |title=Giardia intestinalis |journal=Curr.

Since 2002, ''[[Giardia]]'' cases must be reported to the [[Center for Disease Control]], according to the CDC’s Reportable Disease Spreadsheet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/labs/aboutlabs/lpd/gastrointestinalParasitesSection/nash.htm Gastrointestinal Parasites Lab] studies ''[[Giardia]]'' almost exclusively.

However, ''[[Giardia]]'' experienced an extraordinarily long term of emergence, from its discovery in 1681, until the 1970s when it was fully accepted that infection with ''[[Giardia]]'' was a treatable cause of chronic diarrhea:

{{"
|''Giardia lamblia'' was first discovered by Leeuwenhoeck (1681) who found the parasite in his own {diarrheal} stools. It was long considered to be a harmless commensal organism, but in recent years has been recognized as a cause of intestinal disease often acquired by travelers to foreign countries, persons drinking contaminated water in this country, children in day care nurseries and homosexual males. It is the most common pathogenic intestinal parasite in the United States, being found in 4% of stool specimens submitted to state public health laboratories for parasite examination. Attesting to its increasing importance in the United States, a symposium on Giardiasis, sponsored by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]], was held in the fall of 1978.&lt;ref name="SMITH_1980" /&gt;
|by JW Smith, ''Giardiasis'', 1980
}}

Some of the first evidence in modern times of ''Giardia's'' pathogenicity came during [[World War II]] when soldiers were treated for [[malaria]] with the antiprotozoal [[Quinacrine]], and their diarrhea disappeared, as did the ''[[Giardia]]'' from their stool samples.

===''Helicobacter pylori'' (1892-1982)===

Infection with the bacteria ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'' is the cause of most stomach ulcers. The discovery is generally credited to Australian gastroenterologists Dr. [[Barry Marshall]] and Dr. J Robin Warren, who published their findings in 1983. The pair received the Nobel Prize in 2005 for their work. Before this, nobody really knew what caused stomach ulcers, though a popular belief was that the "stress" played a role. Some researchers suggested that ulcers were a [[psychosomatic]] illness.&lt;ref name="PAULLEY_1975"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Paulley JW |title=Cultural influences on the incidence and pattern of disease |journal=Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=2–11 |year=1975 |pmid=1178798 |doi=10.1159/000286889}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KELLNER_1975"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kellner R |title=Psychotherapy in psychosomatic disorders |journal=Arch.

In ''H Pylori Pioneers'', Dr. Marshall noted that other physicians had produced evidence of ''[[H. pylori]]'' infection as early as 1892.&lt;ref name="MARSHALL_2002" /&gt; Marshall writes that earlier reports were disregarded because they conflicted with existing belief. The first description of ''H. Pylori'' came in 1892 from Giulio Bizzozero, who identified acid-tolerant bacteria living in a dog’s stomach. Later, a theory would be developed that no bacteria could live in the stomach.&lt;ref name="MARSHALL_2002" /&gt; Although the theory has no scientific basis, it would become a stumbling block for scientists, discouraging them for searching for infective causes of stomach ulcers. In 1940, two physicians, Dr. A. Stone Freeberg and Dr. Louis E. Barron published a paper describing a spiral bacteria found in about half of their gastroenterology patients who had stomach ulcers. Dr. [[John Lykoudis]], a Greek physician, was one of the first physicians to treat stomach ulcers as an infectious disease. Between 1960 and 1970, he treated over 10,000 ulcer patients in Athens with antibiotics.&lt;ref name="RIGAS_1999"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rigas B, Feretis C, Papavassiliou ED |title=John Lykoudis: an unappreciated discoverer of the cause and treatment of peptic ulcer disease |journal=Lancet |volume=354 |issue=9190 |pages=1634–5 |year=1999 |pmid=10560691 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(99)06034-1|last2=Feretis |last3=Papavassiliou }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lykoudis tried to publish a paper on his findings, but they conflicted with traditional theory, and his work was never published.&lt;ref name="MARSHALL_2002" /&gt;  Lykoudis' experience was followed in 1975 by a further publication in Gut magazine that included spiral bacteria living on the borders of duodonal ulcers.&lt;ref name="STEER_1975"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Steer HW, Colin-Jones DG |title=Mucosal changes in gastric ulceration and their response to carbenoxolone sodium |journal=Gut |volume=16 |issue=8 |pages=590–7 |year=1975 |pmid=810394 |doi=10.1136/gut.16.8.590 |pmc=1411007|last2=Colin-Jones }}&lt;/ref&gt; The medical significance of Steer’s findings was disregarded, but he “continued to publish papers on ''[[H. Pylori]]'', mostly as a hobby."&lt;ref name="MARSHALL_2002" /&gt;

''[[H. pylori]]'' can infect the stomach of some people without causing stomach ulcers. In investigating asymptomatic carriers of ''[[H. pylori]]'', researchers identified a genetic trait called Interleuik-1 beta-31 which causes increased production of stomach acid, resulting in ulcers if patients become infected with ''[[H. pylori]]''. Patients without the trait do not develop stomach ulcers in response to ''[[H. pylori]]'' infection, but instead have increased risk from stomach cancer if they become infected.&lt;ref name="EL-OMAR_2000" /&gt; Investigation into other gastrointestinal infections has also shown that the symptoms are the result of interaction between the infection and specific genetic mutations in the host.

===Pathogenic variants of ''Escherichia coli'' (1947-1983)===

There are different types of ''[[E. coli]]'', some of which are found in humans and are harmless.  [[Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli]] (ETEC) is a type found to cause illness in humans, possessing [[gene]] that allows it to manufacture a substance toxic to humans. Cattle are immune to its effects but when people eat food contaminated with cattle feces, the organism can cause disease. Reports of pathogenic ''E. coli'' appear in medical literature as early as 1947.&lt;ref name="RUCHMAN_1947"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ruchman I, Dodd K |title=The Isolation of a Strain of Escherichia coli Pathogenic for the Rabbit's Eye from a Patient with Diarrhea |journal=J.

===Human immunodeficiency virus (1959-1984)===

AIDS was first reported June 5, 1981, when the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] recorded a cluster of [[Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP)|''Pneumocystis carinii'' pneumonia]] (now still classified as PCP but known to be caused by [[Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP)|''Pneumocystis jirovecii'']]) in five homosexual men in [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name=MMWR2&gt;{{cite web

However, HIV existed long before the 1981 CDC report. Three of the earliest known instances of HIV infection are as follows:

Two species of HIV infect humans: [[HIV-1]] and [[HIV-2]]. HIV-1 is more virulent and more easily transmitted. HIV-1 is the source of the majority of HIV infections throughout the world, while HIV-2 is not as easily transmitted and is largely confined to [[West Africa]].&lt;ref name=Reeves&gt;{{cite journal

===''Cyclospora'' (1995)===

[[Cyclospora]] is a gastrointestinal pathogen that causes fever, diarrhea, vomiting, and severe weight loss.

Mr. Rajah was trying to discover why local residents and visitors were becoming ill every summer.&lt;ref name="GOLEMAN_1995" /&gt; He identified an unusual looking organism in stool samples from patients who were sick. But when the clinic sent slides of the organism to the [[Center for Disease Control]], it was identified as blue-green algae, which is harmless. Many pathologists had seen the same thing before, but dismissed it as irrelevant to the patient's disease.&lt;ref name="GOLEMAN_1995" /&gt; Later, the organism would be identified as a special kind of parasite, and treatment would be developed to help patients with the infection. In the United States, [[Cyclospora]] infection must be reported to the [[Center for Disease Control]] according to the [https://www.cdc.gov/epo/dphsi/phs/infdis2007r.htm CDC's Reportable Disease Chart]

==Present day discoveries==

The process of identifying new infectious agents continues.

The '''Hospital Insurance and Diagnostic Services Act''' (HIDS) is a [[statute]] passed by the [[Parliament of Canada]] in 1957 that reimbursed one-half of provincial and territorial costs for hospital and diagnostic services administered under provincial and territorial health insurance programs.&lt;ref name="Health Canada"&gt;Health Canada (2012). [http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hcs-sss/pubs/system-regime/2011-hcs-sss/index-eng.php Canada's Health Care System].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Archives Canada"&gt;Archives Canada. [http://www.archivescanada.ca/english/search/ItemDisplay.asp?sessionKey=999999999_142&amp;l=0&amp;lvl=1&amp;v=0&amp;coll=0&amp;itm=257649&amp;rt=1&amp;bill=1 Royal Commission on Health Services fonds].&lt;/ref&gt; Originally implemented on July 1, 1958, with five participating provinces, by January 1, 1961, all 10 provinces were enlisted.&lt;ref name="Archives Canada" /&gt; The federal funding was coupled with terms and conditions borrowed from the Saskatchewan Hospital Services Plan, introduced in 1947 as the first universal hospital insurance program in [[North America]].  In order to receive funding, services had to be universal, comprehensive, accessible and portable. This stipulation was dropped in 1977 with the [[Established Programs Financing|Established Programs Financing Act]] and then reinstated in 1984 in the [[Canada Health Act]]. Widely acknowledged as the foundation for future developments in the [[Health care in Canada|Canadian health care system]], the HIDS Act was a landmark example of federal-provincial cooperation in post-war Canada.&lt;ref name = "Taylor"&gt;Taylor, Malcolm G. (1978). ''[http://mqup.mcgill.ca/book.php?bookid=2351 Health Insurance and Canadian Public Policy]'', McGill-Queen's University Press, Montreal.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Prior to [[World War II]], health care in Canada was privately funded and delivered, with the exception of services provided to the sick poor that were financed by local governments.  The experience of the 1930s left many Canadians in challenging financial situations.  As personal financial situations deteriorated, the municipal governments were overwhelmed.  Though the provinces provided relief payments for food, clothing, and shelter, additional medical costs were beyond the capacity of most of the provincial budgets.  Many Canadians were not receiving adequate medical care, and those that did were overwhelmed with the associated costs. As such, preventable diseases and deaths were still common occurrences.&lt;ref name = "Taylor" /&gt;

Ten years of [[Great Depression|depression]], followed by six years of war, formed the social context of the ambitious federal Green Book Proposals.  In a bid for unprecedented cooperation between the federal and provincial governments, these initiatives formed the foundations of a national program for social security, including provisions for health insurance.  However, the failure to come to a consensus on the required allocation of tax resources at the [[First Ministers' conference|Dominion-Provincial Conference]] in August 1945 precluded adoption and delayed subsequent action.&lt;ref name = "Taylor" /&gt;  Although the Green Book Proposals were not adopted, they effectively created an appetite for government-funded health services.&lt;ref name="Civilization"&gt;Canadian Museum of Civilization (2010). [http://www.civilization.ca/cmc/exhibitions/hist/medicare/medic-5h02e.shtml Making Medicare: The history of health care in Canada, 1914–2007].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flag-Billboard-Forward with CCF, 1944.jpg|thumb|left|Cooperative Commonwealth Federation Party banner]]
Despite a lack of commitment for federal funding, [[Saskatchewan]] proceeded with a plan for provincial hospital insurance.  From the collective efforts of the "wheat economy" came a cooperative movement towards efficient agencies to deliver services to Saskatchewan’s sparse population.  Strong local engagement contributed to creation of the union hospital system and municipal hospital care plans. However, a solution to the problem of providing medical and hospital services to a population reeling from the devastating effects of the depression required greater provincial contribution.  The [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] won their first majority government in 1944.  Continuing the Liberal health insurance platform that introduced "A Bill Respecting Health Insurance," [[Tommy Douglas]], as the new premier, signaled his commitment to the provision of health services by assuming the role of [[Minister of Health (Canada)|Health Minister]] as well.  By 1947, Saskatchewan introduced the first universal hospital insurance program in North America.&lt;ref name = "Taylor" /&gt;

Saskatchewan’s decision to launch the Saskatchewan Hospital Services Plan accelerated and influenced the development of other provincial insurance plans.  The British Columbia Hospital Insurance Service was passed in early 1948, and followed soon after by the [[Alberta]] insurance system.  The success of these provincial plans combined with the volume of illness and associated costs, in addition to provincial disparities in health coverage, fuelled debate on the topic of a federally funded health service.  There was much disagreement as to the appropriate scope, funding allocation, and administration of such a plan.&lt;ref name = "Taylor" /&gt;

After several years of debate between the stakeholders, including Canadian medical professional associations and the provincial governments, the federal government made an offer to fund approximately one half of the national cost of diagnostic services and in-patient hospital care for provinces that implemented insurance plans.  Five provinces, namely [[British Columbia]], [[Alberta]], [[Saskatchewan]], [[Ontario]], and [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], accepted the proposal, laying the groundwork for a Canadian health insurance plan.&lt;ref name = "Taylor" /&gt;

==Overview==

On May 1, 1957, the HIDS Act was formally legislated in Canada in response to the increasing pressures for national comprehensive health insurance.&lt;ref name = "Taylor" /&gt;  Under the Act, the federal government agreed to fund approximately 50% of the costs of provincial or territorial insurance plans for hospital and diagnostic services.&lt;ref name="Turner"&gt;Turner, J. Gilbert (1958). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1829926/ The Hospital Insurance and Diagnostic Services Act: Its impact on hospital administration],  ''Canadian Medical Association Journal'', 78(10), 768-770.&lt;/ref&gt;  Formally, federal funding comprised 25% of the per capita costs for hospital services in Canada plus 25% of the per capita costs for hospital services in the province or territory multiplied by the number of insured persons in that jurisdiction.&lt;ref name = "Taylor" /&gt;  Funding was made available to any province or territory that agreed to make insured hospital services available to the region under uniform provisions.&lt;ref name="Manga"&gt;Manga, Pran, Broyles Robert W., &amp; Angus, Douglas E. (1987). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3695668 The determinants of hospital utilization under a universal public insurance program in Canada],  ''Medical Care'', 25(7), 658-670.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Provisions===

Participating provinces and territories were obligated to satisfy four funding conditions as follows:&lt;ref name="Manga" /&gt;

*Comprehensiveness:  All-encompassing in-patient and out-patient hospital services as well as diagnostic services were to be made available under the insurance plan.
*Universality: Services were to be made available to all residents of the province or territory.
*Accessibility: Services were to be made reasonably accessible to insured persons in a manner that did not preclude or impede access either directly or indirectly.
*Portability: Provincial plans were to provide coverage for out-of-province Canadian residents who were insured by home provincial or territorial plans.

Provinces and Territories were also obligated to limit co-payments and other "deterrent" fees to ensure that patients were not placed under financial burden at the point of care.&lt;ref name = "Taylor" /&gt;  Though there was no other explicit provision preventing provinces and territories from demanding financial contribution for services from patients, such charges would have reduced the federal contribution since, under the cost-sharing arrangement, federal funding was proportional to provincial and territorial contributions.&lt;ref name="Parliament"&gt;Parliament of Canada. [http://www.parl.gc.ca/Content/SEN/Committee/371/soci/rep/repintmar01part1-e.htm The health of Canadians – The federal role]. Retrieved December 7, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, the Act intrinsically deterred provinces and territories from charging patients for services.

===Coverage===

Provincial and territorial insurance plans were to cover acute, convalescent, and chronic care of patients, including diagnostic services and in-patient drug administration in hospital facilities.&lt;ref name="Manga" /&gt;  However, coverage was not provided for hospitals for [[tuberculosis]], [[Psychiatric hospital|mental hospitals]], [[nursing home]]s, capital expenditures, or administrative costs.&lt;ref name="Turner" /&gt;

===Funding===

Each province and territory was to be responsible for administering its own plan; therefore, each had the right to decide how to raise its proportion of funding for the insurance program, either through insurance premiums or taxation.&lt;ref name="Turner" /&gt;

===Delivery===

Under the Act, insured services could only be delivered by hospitals, most of which were private entities.  Hospital employees including physicians, laboratory technicians, and radiologists were to be paid via a [[fee-for-service]] model negotiated with the provincial or territorial administrative body.&lt;ref name = "Taylor" /&gt;

The passage of the HIDS Act was the first milestone in the evolution of national health insurance in Canada and provided the foundation for all future Canadian Health legislation.&lt;ref name="Manga" /&gt;

==Outcomes==

By 1961, almost all Canadians were entitled to comprehensive hospital care benefits, protecting them from large hospital bills.  The HIDS act enabled hospital operations that were not previously feasible and facilitated access to care for who could not otherwise afford it.&lt;ref name="Archives Canada" /&gt;

[[File:Lester B. Pearson with a pencil.jpg|thumb|right|Lester B. Pearson]]
The HIDS Act laid the foundation for other notable developments in the Canadian health care system.  One of the criticisms of the Act was that it did not cover medical services, which in 1955 comprised approximately 40% of national healthcare costs.&lt;ref name = "Taylor" /&gt; Following the adoption of the HIDS Act, then, extending health insurance to cover additional medical services was next on the federal agenda.  At the [[First Ministers' conference|Federal-Provincial Conference]] in July, 1965, the decision for [[Medicare (Canada)|Medicare]] was made. Then, on July 1, 1967, the governing Liberals under [[Lester B. Pearson]] introduced the Medical Care Act, covering 50% of physician costs outside of a hospital.&lt;ref name = "Taylor" /&gt;
 
Together, the HIDS Act and Medical Care Act brought hospital and physician services to all Canadians, regardless of their ability to pay. Though criticized for imposing federal priorities on provincial jurisdiction, provincial governments were left with no option other than to meet the federal provisions or forgo supplementary funding altogether.&lt;ref name = "Taylor" /&gt;  To address these concerns, the [[Established Programs Financing|Established Programs Financing Act]] was passed in 1977, transferring the responsibility of the program to the provinces by decoupling the amount of the federal transfer from the provisions.  Some provinces levied user charges and authorized extra-billing, which threatened universal and free access to healthcare.&lt;ref name="Madore"&gt;Madore, Odette (2005).[http://www.parl.gc.ca/Content/LOP/ResearchPublications/944-e.htm The Canada Health Act: Overview and options].&lt;/ref&gt; The federal government, then, enacted the [[Canada Health Act]] in 1984 to re-instate the provisions of the HIDS Act and the Medical Care Act.

'''Hugo Sigman''' is the founder, CEO and –jointly with his wife, Biochemist Silvia Gold— the only shareholder of [[Grupo Insud]], a business conglomerate with an active presence in the fields of pharmaceuticals, agroforestry, culture, nature and design.

==Biographical data and experience==

Hugo Sigman was born in Buenos Aires, [[Argentina]], in 1944. He completed his primary and secondary schooling in public schools.
In 1969, he earned his Medical Doctor degree from [[Universidad de Buenos Aires]], and in the same year, he graduated from the Social Psychology School led by [[Enrique Pichon-Rivière|Dr. Pichon Riviére]].

In 1970, he joined as Resident the Psychiatry Service of Policlínico Lanús, directed by Professor Mauricio Goldenberg. He continued his career, first as Chief of Residents, and then as founder and director of the Psychiatric Emergency Unit at the same hospital. In 1976, he moved to [[Spain]], where he worked at the Psychiatry Service of Hospital Clínico de Barcelona.

At that time, encouraged by his father-in-law Roberto Gold, Hugo Sigman started his entrepreneurial career and got involved in the pharmaceutical industry.
In 1978, with his wife, Silvia Gold –his partner in love and work for 45 years-, he founded Chemo, a chemical-pharmaceutical company, and the first company of Grupo Insud.
Their goal was to create a company to produce high-quality medicines at affordable prices.
In the 1980s, Hugo and Silvia returned to Argentina to continue the path they had started in Europe.

==Life Sciences==

At present, Grupo Insud comprises three companies in the life sciences industry: Chemo, a company that sells active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and finished dosage forms (FDFs) to 1,200 pharmaceutical companies around the world, has 15 manufacturing sites and 9 R&amp;D centers; Exeltis, a company that sells branded products in more than 40 countries, and mAbxience, a biotech company created in 2008, with 3 manufacturing sites, the first monoclonal antibody plant in Latin America –pharmADN- and the first vaccine and biotech production plant in Argentina, Sinergium Biotech.

Chemo signed an agreement with the [[World Health Organization]] and [[Utrecht University]] to produce the Palivizumab [[monoclonal antibody]] and facilitate access to this medicine for premature children, as it is estimated that 250,000 premature children die every year around the world without treatment due to its high cost.&lt;ref&gt;[http://press.uu.nl/cooperation-between-utrecht-university-and-who-for-affordable-medicines-in-developing-countries/ Utrecht University. Cooperation for affordable medicines in developing countries]&lt;/ref&gt;

Jointly with renowned Argentine companies, in 2011 Hugo Sigman founded the Argentine Chamber of Biotechnology, Cámara Argentina de Biotecnología, which he currently chairs. The goal of CAB is to strengthen the public-private collaboration policy in biotechnology and encourage its development in the region.
In Argentina’s veterinary industry, he is a partner of Biogénesis Bagó, which runs a world-class facility for foot-and-mouth disease vaccine production, the only one that has been authorized by the government of China to build a plant in that country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telam.com.ar/notas/201310/35611-la-planta-de-biogenesis-bago-en-china-sera-la-primera-firma-extranjera-dedicada-a-producir-vacunas-en-china.html Primera firma extranjera dedicada a producir vacunas en china]&lt;/ref&gt;

For 20 years, Hugo and Silvia have led the Public-Private Consortium for Research and Development of Innovative Oncology Therapies, which developed the first therapeutic vaccine against lung cancer, [[Racotumomab]] (Vaxira),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cacciavillano | first1 = W | last2 = Sampor | first2 = C | last3 = Venier | first3 = C | last4 = Gabri | first4 = MR | last5 = de Dávila | first5 = MT | last6 = Galluzzo | first6 = ML | last7 = Guthmann | first7 = MD | last8 = Fainboim | first8 = L | last9 = Alonso | first9 = DF | last10 = Chantada | first10 = GL | date = Jul 2015 | title = A phase I study of the anti-idiotype vaccine racotumomab in neuroblastoma and other pediatric refractory malignancies | url = | journal = Pediatr Blood Cancer | volume =  62| issue = | pages =  2120–4| doi = 10.1002/pbc.25631 | pmid = 26154941 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reichert | first1 = JM | year = 2015 | title = Antibodies to watch in 2015 | journal = MAbs. | volume = 7 | issue = 1| pages = 1–8 | doi = 10.4161/19420862.2015.988944 | pmid = 25484055 | pmc=4622967}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hernández | first1 = AM | last2 = Vázquez | first2 = AM | date = Jan 2015 | title = Racotumomab-alum vaccine for the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer | url = | journal = Expert Rev Vaccines | volume = 14 | issue = 1| pages = 9–20 | doi = 10.1586/14760584.2015.984691 | pmid = 25420897 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gajdosik | first1 = Z | date = Apr 2014 | title = Racotumomab - a novel anti-idiotype monoclonal antibody vaccine for the treatment of cancer | url = | journal = Drugs Today (Barc). | volume = 50 | issue = 4| pages = 301–7 | doi = 10.1358/dot.2014.50.4.2116670 | pmid = 24918647 }}&lt;/ref&gt; introduced in 2013, and which currently has five new products in research.

In this framework, Hugo Sigman strongly supports public-private partnerships, which he views as a positive paradigm to be promoted with ethics and transparency. He understands that public research centers should give back to society by contributing their knowledge and developments, and the private sector should recognize that contribution by compensating them accordingly. Inspired in that model, he has built partnerships with prestigious institutions including Universidad de Buenos Aires, [[Universidad Nacional de Quilmes]], [[Universidad Nacional de San Martín]], Roffo and [[Garrahan]] Hospitals, [[:es:Academia Nacional de Medicina (Argentina)|Academia Nacional de Medicina]], and several foreign universities.

Approximately 250 researchers work at the partnerships supported by the Group, doing basic and applied research; 100 of them are dedicated to the development of products for treating cancer.

==Agribusiness==

His entrepreneurial spirit and interest in biology have led Hugo Sigman beyond the frontiers of the pharmaceutical industry. In 1998, he started agricultural and forestry activities in different locations of Argentina, focused on genetic improvement and sustainable production, with companies Garruchos, devoted to farming and cattle-raising; Pomera, ranked as the top Argentine-capital forestry company; and Cabaña Los Murmullos, a leading cattle breeding ranch.
Sigman is also a shareholder of Bioceres, an Argentine [[biotechnology]] company focused on agricultural production. This young company developed a gene that enables the production of wheat, corn and soybean resistant to draughts and soil salinity, and has licensed its products to the USA, France and India.

==Communication and Art==

Hugo Sigman encourages the exchange of ideas through publishing company Capital intellectual, which includes a line of publications in Spain under the publishing brand Clave Intellectual, the Southern Cone edition of Le Monde Diplomatique, and the Latin American version of prestigious The New York Review of Books.
In 2005, Hugo Sigman partnered with [[Oscar Kramer]] and established filmmaking company Kramer&amp;Sigman Films (K&amp;S), which has grown to be a thriving production company, with several box-office successes, including ''[[Kamchatka (film)|Kamchatka]]'', ''[[El perro]]'', ''The Last Elvis'', ''Seventh Floor'', ''[[Wild Tales (film)|Wild Tales]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/goingoutguide/movies/satirical-wild-tales-stands-out-among-oscars-foreign-language-nominees/2015/02/25/37cdfdc4-b880-11e4-9423-f3d0a1ec335c_story.html Satirical ‘Wild Tales’ stands out among Oscar’s foreign language nominees] [[Washington Post]].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8959">'''Insulated shipping containers''' are a type of [[packaging]] used to ship temperature sensitive products such as [[food]]s, [[pharmaceutical]]s, [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]], [[blood]], biologic materials, and [[chemical]]s.  They are used as part of a [[cold chain]] to help maintain product freshness and efficacy. The term can also refer to [[Thermal insulation|insulated]] [[intermodal container]]s or insulated [[Swap body|swap bodies]].

==Construction==

}}&lt;/ref&gt; An insulated [[shipping container]] might be constructed of:
# a [[vacuum flask]], similar to a "thermos" bottle
# fabricated thermal blankets or liners
# molded expanded [[polystyrene]] foam (EPS, [[expanded polystyrene foam|styrofoam]]), similar to a [[cooler]]
# other molded foams such as [[polyurethane]], [[polyethylene]]
# sheets of foamed plastics
# [[Vacuum insulated panel|Vacuum Insulated Panels]] (VIPs)
# reflective materials: ([[metallised film]])
# [[bubble wrap]] or other gas filled panels
# other packaging materials and structures

Some are designed for single use while others are returnable for [[reuse]]. Some insulated containers are decommissioned refrigeration units.  Some empty containers are sent to the shipper disassembled or “knocked down”, assembled and used, then knocked down again for easier return shipment.

Shipping containers are available for maintaining cryogenic temperatures, with the use of liquid nitrogen.  Some carriers have these as a specialized service&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ups.com/us/en/services/healthcare/healthcare-products/temperature-true-cryo.page&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
[[File:Using Insulated Shipping Containers and Validated Packing Protocols technical-3.theora.ogv|thumbnail|left|[[United States Army Medical Materiel Agency]] video showing how containers are packed to maintain constant cold temperatures.]]
Insulated shipping containers are part of a comprehensive cold chain which controls and documents the temperature of a product through its entire distribution cycle. The containers may be used with a refrigerant or coolant such as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Matsunaga |first= K|authorlink= |author2=Burgess, Lockhart |date=March 2007 |title=Two methods for calculating the amount of refrigerant required for cyclic temperature testing of insulated packages |journal=Packaging Technology and Science |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=113–123 |doi=10.1002/pts.747 |url= |accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* block or cube [[ice]], [[slurry ice]]
* [[dry ice]]
* Gel or [[ice pack]]s (often formulated for specific temperature ranges)
* [[Phase-change material|Phase change materials]] (PCMs)
* Some products (such as frozen meat) have sufficient thermal mass to contribute to the temperature control and no excess coolant is required

A digital [[Temperature data logger]] or a [[time temperature indicator]] is often enclosed to monitor the temperature inside the container for its entire shipment.

[[Label]]s and appropriate documentation (internal and external) are usually required.

Personnel throughout the cold chain need to be aware of the special handling and documentation required for some controlled shipments.  With some regulated products, complete documentation is required.

==Design and Evaluation==
The use of  “off the shelf” insulated shipping containers does not necessarily guarantee proper performance.  Several factors need to be considered:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Choi |first= Seung-Jin|authorlink= |author2=Burgess |date=November 2007 |title=Practical mathematical model to predict the performance of insulating packages|journal=Packaging Technology and Science |volume=20 |issue=6 |pages=369–380 |doi=10.1002/pts.762 |url= |accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* the sensitivity of the product to temperatures (high and low) and to time at temperatures
* the specific distribution system being used: the expected (and worst case) time and temperatures
* regulatory requirements
* the specific combination of packaging components and materials being used

In specifying an insulated shipping container, the two primary characteristics of the material are its [[thermal conductivity]] or [[R-value (insulation)|R-value]], and its thickness. These two attributes will help determine the resistance to heat transfer from the ambient environment into the payload space. The coolant material load temperature, quantity, [[latent heat]], and [[sensible heat]] will help determine the amount of heat the parcel can absorb while maintaining the desired control temperature. Combining the attributes from the insulator and coolant will allow analysis of expected duration of the insulated shipping container system.

It is wise (and sometimes mandatory) to have formal [[Verification and validation|verification]] of the performance of the insulated shipping container.  Laboratory [[package testing]] might include [[ASTM]] D3103-07, Standard Test Method for Thermal Insulation Performance of Packages, ISTA Guide 5B: Focused Simulation Guide for Thermal Performance Testing of Temperature Controlled Transport Packaging, and others.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[Verification and Validation|validation]] of field performance (performance qualification) is extremely useful.

Specialists in design and testing of packaging for temperature sensitive products are often needed.  These may be consultants, independent laboratories, universities, or reputable vendors.  Many laboratories have certifications and accreditations: [[ISO 9000]]s, [[ISO/IEC 17025]], etc.

== Environmental Impact ==
Parcel to pallet sized insulated shipping containers have historically been single-use products due to the low-cost material composition of EPS and water-based gel packs. The insulation material typically finds its way into landfill streams as it is not readily recyclable in the United States.

The development of reusable high-performance shipping containers have been shown to reduce packing waste by 95% while also contributing significant savings to other environmental pollutants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goellner|first=Kai N.|last2=Sparrow|first2=Eph|date=2013-11-26|title=An environmental impact comparison of single-use and reusable thermally controlled shipping containers|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11367-013-0668-z|journal=The International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment|language=en|volume=19|issue=3|pages=611–619|doi=10.1007/s11367-013-0668-z|issn=0948-3349}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation and operation==
{{further|Water supply and sanitation in the Republic of Ireland}}
[[Water supply and sanitation in the Republic of Ireland|Water supplies in Ireland]] are governed by the Water Services Acts of 2007 to 2014. Until 2015, this legislation provided for the provision of water and wastewater services by [[Local government in the Republic of Ireland|local authorities]], with domestic usage funded through central taxation, and non-domestic usage funded via local authority [[Rates (tax)|rates]]. Under terms of a 2010 [[Economic Adjustment Programme for Ireland|Economic Adjustment (Bailout) Programme]], the then government agreed to change this arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/government-forced-by-troika-to-set-up-irish-water-too-early-1.1668688 |publisher= Irish Times |title= Government ‘forced by Troika’ to set up Irish Water too early |date= 26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2015, legislation came into force such that a new utility company, Irish Water, became responsible for providing water and wastewater services, with the intention that the company would be funded through direct billing. The new company was set up as a subsidiary of an existing semi-state corporation, [[Ervia|Bord Gáis (Ervia)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/irish-water-timeline-1.2300157 | publisher= Irish Times |date= 29 July 2015 |title= Irish Water timeline – A chronological look at the utility from setup to Eurostat ruling}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newly created company effectively took on the existing local authority employees and water management facilities, pipes and infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.thejournal.ie/irish-water-local-authority-staff-1863780-Jan2015/ | publisher= TheJournal.ie |title=Irish Water insists it WILL be reducing local authority staff numbers |date= 4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Operationally, Irish Water delegates some work, for example water meter installation and customer support, to sub-contractors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/mick-wallace-obrien-buying-siteserv-very-questionable-290751.html |publisher= Irish Examiner |title=Mick Wallace: O'Brien buying Siteserv very questionable |date= 10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.rte.ie/news/2015/0308/685479-water-meters/ | title=Meter installers ask Irish Water for extra money |date=8 March 2015 |publisher= RTÉ News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.independent.ie/business/jobs/irish-water-abtran-hires-350-temporary-staff-ahead-of-billing-31033635.html |publisher=Irish Independent |title=Irish Water: Abtran hires 350 temporary staff ahead of billing |date= 2 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Litigation and criticism==
Irish Water has been the subject of several civil cases, including one taken by Crohn's Disease sufferer Elizabeth Hourihane,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/courts/woman-takes-legal-challenge-against-establishment-of-irish-water-1.1946906 |title= Woman takes legal challenge against establishment of Irish Water | publisher= Irish Times |date= 30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one taken by the [[Environmental Protection Agency (Ireland)|Environmental Protection Agency]] which initiated proceedings over the standard of water in County Donegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.irishtimes.com/news/environment/epa-suing-irish-water-and-council-over-water-standard-in-letterkenny-1.1950143 | publisher=Irish Times |title=EPA suing Irish Water and council over water standard in Letterkenny |date=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 and 2015, local protests were encouraged by residents across the country, and supported by [[Sinn Féin]], [[Socialist Party]], [[Socialist Workers Party (Ireland)|Socialist Workers Party]], [[Eirigi]], [[Republican Sinn Féin]], [[32 County Sovereignty Movement]], [[Communist Party of Ireland]], [[Workers' Party of Ireland|Workers' Party]], [[Workers Solidarity Movement]], [[Direct Democracy Ireland]] along with trade unionists and other civil society organisations. Those opposed to the plans physically blocked the installation of water meters and demonstrated against the introduction of water charges. A demonstration that took place in [[Dublin]] on 11 October 2014 involved approximately 130,000 (4% of Ireland's population).{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} The ''[[Irish Times]]'' newspaper conducted a poll the week before which found that 33% of people intended to boycott water charges. Also on 11 October, [[Paul Murphy (Irish politician)|Paul Murphy]], an anti-austerity candidate, won the Dublin-West by-election. This resulted in journalist [[Fintan O'Toole]] to describe 11 October 2014 as the 'Water Rebellion'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irishcentral.com/opinion/cahirodoherty/120000-Irish-protest-as-the-good-boys-of-Europe-turn-bad.html |title=120,000 Irish protest as the good boys of Europe turn bad |publisher=IrishCentral.com |date=2014-11-02 |accessdate=2015-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/20/opinion/fintan-otoole-the-irish-rebellion-over-water.html?_r=0 |title=The Irish Rebellion Over Water | publisher=New York Times |date= 19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further demonstrations took place in key provincial towns and cities in November 2014, and on 10 December 2014 approximately 100,000 people protested in Dublin against water charges, with the [[Gardaí]] (police) setting up barricades to establish a seclusion zone around government buildings. In response protestors blockaded roads and bridges in the city centre, postponing bus services, until the early hours of the next morning. Community groups set up to oppose water meters also reportedly physically removed water meters in the days after the protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/dublin-brought-to-standstill-by-water-protest-1.2032874 |title=Dublin brought to standstill by water protest |publisher=Irishtimes.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/environment/traffic-eases-after-tens-of-thousands-protest-against-water-charges-1.2032524 |title=Traffic eases after tens of thousands protest against water charges |publisher=Irishtimes.com |date=2014-12-10 |accessdate=2015-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The utility and associated charges were also a feature in the [[Irish general election, 2016|2016 general election]], with a number of parties and candidates campaigning specifically on the issue.&lt;ref name="electionOne"/&gt;&lt;ref name="electionTwo"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.independent.ie/breaking-news/irish-news/election-candidates-join-thousands-in-dublin-protest-against-water-charges-34470717.html | publisher =Independent News &amp; Media |date= 20 February 2016 | title= Election candidates join thousands in Dublin protest against water charges }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Water charges were suspended in the months following the election,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/oireachtas/billing-of-water-charges-to-be-suspended-next-week-1.2698891 | publisher= Irish Times |date= 24 June 2016 | title= Billing of water charges to be suspended next week }}&lt;/ref&gt; and an 'expert commission on the funding of water services' established to assess the issue. The commission published a report on 29 November 2016 which recommended that normal household water usage should be paid for by the State, with excessive usage paid for by the consumer in a "polluter pays" model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.rte.ie/news/2016/1130/835595-european-commission-water/ | publisher = RTÉ News| date= 30 November 2016 | title= EC to 'evaluate' expert report on water charges }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:J.A. Carrel.tiff|thumb|upright|Jean-Antoine Carrel]]
'''Jean-Antoine Carrel''' (1829 – August 1891) was an Italian [[mountain climber]] and [[mountain guide|guide]]. He had made climbs with [[Edward Whymper]] and was his rival when he attempted to climb the [[Matterhorn]] for the first time. Whymper ultimately succeeded in making the mountain's [[First ascent of the Matterhorn|first ascent]] in July 1865 while Carrel led the party that achieved the [[second ascent of the Matterhorn|second ascent]] three days later. Carrel was in the group that became the first Europeans to reach the summit of [[Chimborazo (volcano)|Chimborazo]] in 1880.&lt;ref name="Gos"/&gt; He died from exhaustion when guiding a party on the south side of the Matterhorn.

==Early life==
Carrel was born on 16 January 1829 in [[Valtournenche]], in the [[Aosta Valley]], an [[Arpitan]]-speaking village of [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] (now [[Italy]]) which lies at the foot of the [[Matterhorn]].&lt;ref name=boyslife&gt;{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=02YEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA30|title=Whymper allowed a beginner to join his climbing party. He should have known better.|work=[[Boys' Life]]|date=December 1988|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served in the [[Bersaglieri]], a [[light infantry]] unit of the Piedmontese army. He resigned from the Bersaglieri to work as a hunter and [[mountain guide]], but was recalled to duty in 1859 to defend Italy against Austria in the [[Second Italian War of Independence]], for which he won a French medal for the Italian campaign.&lt;ref name=hansen&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eep1B-8JZRkC&amp;pg=PT188|pages=188–189|title=The Summits of Modern Man|last=Hansen|first=Peter H.|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|year=2013|isbn=9780674074552}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ascent of the Matterhorn==
{{Main article|Second ascent of the Matterhorn}}
Carrel first attempted to climb the Matterhorn's Lion Ridge in 1857—by which time the mountain was the tallest unclimbed peak in the Alps—with his uncle and [[Amé Gorret]]. In the early 1860s, Carrel made numerous attempts to climb the Matterhorn, often in the same party as [[Edward Whymper]] and [[John Tyndall]], and at other times competing against them to reach the summit first.&lt;ref name=hansen/&gt; Carrel had agreed to accompany Whymper on his ascent of the Swiss side in 1865, but withdrew at the last minute when he was recruited by [[Felice Giordano]] on behalf of the [[Italian Alpine Club]] to lead an Italian party up the Italian side at the same time. Ultimately, Whymper's party outclimbed the Italians and reached the summit on 14 July 1865, marking the [[first ascent of the Matterhorn]].&lt;ref name=boyslife/&gt; Carrel and his Italian party successfully summited the Matterhorn three days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Thin Ice: Unlocking the Secrets of Climate in the World's Highest Mountains|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HGIcabCZHVUC&amp;pg=PA84|first=Mark|last=Bowen|page=84|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]]|year=2006|isbn=9781429932707}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Carrel died in August 1891 while guiding a party on the south side of the Matterhorn.&lt;ref name="Gos"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gos|first=Charles|title=Alpine Tragedy|chapter=Carrel the Great|others=Trans.

After Carrel's death, Whymper wrote that Carrel was "a man who was possessed with a pure and genuine love of mountains; a man of originality and resource, courage and determination, who delighted in exploration ... The manner of his death strikes a chord in hearts he never knew."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Scrambles Amongst the Alps: In the Years 1860&amp;ndash;69|first=Edward|last=Whymper|page=418|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k6uScEubYogC&amp;pg=PA418|publisher=Courier Dover Publication|year=1996|isbn=9780486289724}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Causes --&gt;
Laryngitis is categorised as [[acute (medicine)|acute]] if it lasts less than three weeks and [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] if symptoms last more than three weeks.&lt;ref name=BMJ2014/&gt; Acute cases usually occur as part of a [[viral upper respiratory tract infection]].&lt;ref name=BMJ2014/&gt; Other infections and trauma such as from coughing are other causes.&lt;ref name=BMJ2014/&gt; Chronic cases may occur due to [[smoking]], [[tuberculosis]], [[allergies]], [[acid reflux]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]], or [[sarcoidosis]].&lt;ref name=BMJ2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dworkin2008&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dworkin|first1=James Paul|title=Laryngitis: Types, Causes, and Treatments|journal=Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America|date=April 2008|volume=41|issue=2|pages=419–436|doi=10.1016/j.otc.2007.11.011|pmid=18328379}}&lt;/ref&gt; The underlying mechanism involves irritation of the [[vocal folds|vocal cords]].&lt;ref name=PubMed2016/&gt;

The primary symptom of laryngitis is a hoarse voice.&lt;ref name=":07"/&gt;{{rp|108}} Because laryngitis can have various causes, other signs and symptoms may vary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Classification Manual of Voice Disorders-I.|last=|first=|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum|year=2006|isbn=|editor-last=Verdolini|editor-first=Katherine|series=American Speech-Language-Hearing Association|location=Mahwah, N.J|pages=|quote=|editor-last2=Rosen|editor-first2=Clark A.|editor-last3=Branksi|editor-first3=Ryan C.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can include
* Dry or sore throat
* Coughing (both a causal factor and a symptom of laryngitis)
* Frequent throat clearing
* Increased saliva production
* [[Dysphagia]]&amp;nbsp;(difficulty swallowing)
* Sensation of swelling in the area of the&amp;nbsp;[[larynx]] (discomfort in the front of the neck)
* [[Globus pharyngis|Globus pharyngeus]] (feeling like there is a lump in the throat)
* Cold or&amp;nbsp;[[flu-like symptoms]]&amp;nbsp;(which, like a cough, may also be a causal factor for laryngitis)
* Swollen&amp;nbsp;[[lymph node]]s&amp;nbsp;in the throat, chest, or face
* Fever
* General muscle pain ([[myalgia]])
* [[Dyspnea|Shortness of breath]], predominantly in children

=== Voice quality ===
Aside from a hoarse-sounding voice, changes to pitch and volume may occur with laryngitis. Speakers may experience a lower or higher pitch than normal, depending on whether their vocal folds are swollen or stiff.&lt;ref name=BMJ2014/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Takahashi|first=H.|last2=Koike|first2=Y.|date=1976|title=Some perceptual dimensions and acoustical correlates of pathologic voices|journal=Acta Oto-Laryngologica Supplementum|volume=|issue=338|pages=1–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may also have breathier voices, as more air flows through the space between the vocal folds (the [[glottis]]), quieter volume&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shipp|first=Thomas|last2=Huntington|first2=Dorothy A.|date=1965-11-01|title=Some Acoustic and Perceptual Factors in Acute-Laryngitic Hoarseness|url=http://jshd.pubs.asha.org/article.aspx?doi=10.1044/jshd.3004.350|journal=Journal of Speech and Hearing Disorders|volume=30|issue=4|doi=10.1044/jshd.3004.350|pmid=5835492|issn=0022-4677|pages=350}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a reduced range.&lt;ref name="BMJ2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BMJ2014"/&gt;

==Causes==
[[File:Laryngitis.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Laryngitis]]
Laryngitis can be infectious as well as noninfectious in origin. The resulting inflammation of the vocal folds results in a distortion of the sound produced there.&lt;ref name="BMJ2014"/&gt; It normally develops in response to either an infection, trauma to the vocal folds, or allergies.&lt;ref name="Dworkin2008"/&gt; Chronic laryngitis may also be caused by more severe problems, such as nerve damage, sores, polyps, or hard and thick lumps ([[Vocal fold nodule|nodules]]) on the vocal cords.[[Laryngitis#cite note-4|&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

=== Acute ===

==== Viral ====
* Most acute cases of laryngitis are caused by viral infections,&lt;ref name="BMJ2014"/&gt; the most common of which tend to be [[rhinovirus]], [[influenza virus]], [[Human parainfluenza viruses|parainfluenza virus]], [[adenovirus]],  [[coronavirus]], and [[Respiratory syncytial virus|RSV]]. In patients who have a compromised immune system, other viruses such as herpes, HIV and [[coxsackievirus]] may also be potential causes.

==== Bacterial ====
* This is another major cause of acute laryngitis, and may develop in conjunction with or due to a viral infection.&lt;ref name="BMJ2014" /&gt; Common bacterial strains are; [[group A streptococcus]], ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'', ''[[C. diphtheriae]]'', ''[[M. catarrhalis]]'', ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'', ''[[Bordetella pertussis]]'', ''[[Bacillus anthracis]]'', and ''[[M. tuberculosis]]''. In developing countries, more unusual bacterial causes may occur such as [[Mycobacterium|mycobacterial]] and [[Syphilis|syphilitic]], though these may occur in developed nations as well.&lt;ref name="BMJ2014" /&gt;

==== Fungal ====
* Laryngitis caused by fungal infection is common but not frequently diagnosed according to a review by BMJ and can account for up to 10% of acute laryngitis cases.&lt;ref name="BMJ2014" /&gt; Patients with both functioning and impaired immune systems can develop fungal laryngitis, which may develop as a result of recent antibiotic or inhaled corticosteroids use.&lt;ref name="BMJ2014" /&gt; Certain strains of fungi that may cause laryngitis include; ''[[Histoplasma]]'', ''[[Blastomyces]]'', [[Candida (fungus)|''Candida'']] (especially in immunocompromised persons), and ''[[Cryptococcus]]'' and ''[[Coccidioides]]''.

==== Trauma ====
* Often due to excessive use of the vocal folds such as excessive yelling, screaming, or singing. Though this often results in damage to the outer layers of the vocal folds, the subsequent healing may lead to changes in the physiology of the folds.&lt;ref name="BMJ2014" /&gt; Another potential cause of inflammation may be [[Vocal loading|overuse]] of the vocal cords.[[Laryngitis#cite note-5|&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt;]] [[Laryngitis#cite note-6|&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt;]] [[Laryngitis#cite note-7|&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt;]] [[Laryngitis#cite note-8|&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt;]] [[Laryngitis#cite note-9|&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt;]] Laryngeal trauma, including [[iatrogenic]] (caused by [[endotracheal intubation]]), can also result in inflammation of the vocal cords.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rieger|first=A.|last2=Hass|first2=I.|last3=Gross|first3=M.|last4=Gramm|first4=HJ|last5=Eyrich|first5=K.|year=1996|title=Intubation trauma of the larynx--a literature review with special reference to arytenoid cartilage dislocation|journal=Anasthesiol Intensivmed Notfallmed Schmerzther.|volume=31|issue=5|pmid=8767240|doi=10.1055/s-2007-995921|pages=281–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chronic ===

==== Allergies ====
* Findings are unclear as to whether asthma may cause symptoms commonly associated with laryngitis.&lt;ref name="BMJ2014" /&gt; Some researchers have posited that allergic causes of laryngitis are often misdiagnosed as being the result of acid reflux.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brook|first=Christopher|last2=Platt|first2=Michael|last3=Reese|first3=Stephen|last4=Noordzij|first4=Pieter|date=January 2016|title=Utility of Allergy Testing in Patients with Chronic Laryngopharyngeal Symptoms: Is It Allergic Laryngitis?|journal=Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery|publisher=|volume= 154| issue =  1 |doi=10.1177/0194599815607850|pages=41–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Reflux ====
* One possible explanation of chronic laryngitis is that inflammation is caused by gastro-oesophageal reflux which causes subsequent irritation of the vocal folds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Joniau|first=Sander|last2=Bradshaw|first2=Anthony|last3=Esterman|first3=Adrian|last4=Carney|first4=A. Simon|date=May 2007|title=Reflux and laryngitis: A systematic review|doi=10.1016/j.otohns.2006.12.004|pmid=17478199|journal=Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery|volume= 136| issue = 5|pages=686–692}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Autoimmune disorders ====
* Approximately between 30-75% of persons with rheumatoid arthritis report symptoms of laryngitis.&lt;ref name="BMJ2014" /&gt;
* Symptoms of laryngitis are present in only 0.5-5% of people that have sarcoidosis.&lt;ref name="BMJ2014" /&gt; According to a meta-analysis by Silva et al. (2007), this disease is often an uncommon cause of laryngeal symptoms and is frequently misdiagnosed as another voice disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Silva|first=Leonardo|last2=Damrose|first2=Edward|last3=Bairao|first3=Fernanda|last4=Nina|first4=Mayra|last5=Junior|first5=James|last6=Costa|first6=Henrique|date=June 2008|title=Infectious granulomatous laryngitis: a retrospective study of 24 cases|journal=European Archives of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology|publisher=|volume= 265| issue = 6|doi=10.1007/s00405-007-0533-4|pages=675–680}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis of different forms of acute laryngitis
* Laryngitis following trauma: This form of laryngitis is usually identified by obtaining a case history providing information on previous phono traumatic experiences, internal trauma caused by recent procedures as well as any previous neck injuries.&lt;ref name="BMJ2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=House |first=SA |date=December 2017 |title=Hoarseness in Adults |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=11 |issue=11 |pages=720–728 |pmid=29431404 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Acute viral laryngitis: This form of laryngitis is characterized by lower [[vocal pitch]] as well as [[Hoarse voice|hoarseness]].&lt;ref name="BMJ2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The symptoms in this form of laryngitis are usually present for less than one week, however they can persist for 3-4 weeks.&lt;ref name="BMJ2014" /&gt; This form of laryngitis might also be accompanied by upper respiratory tract symptoms such as: sore throat, [[odynophagia]], [[rhinorrhea]], [[dyspnea]], postnasal discharge, and congestion.&lt;ref name="BMJ2014" /&gt;

* Fungal laryngitis: A [[biopsy]] and culture of abnormal lesion may help confirm fungal laryngitis.&lt;ref name="BMJ2014" /&gt;

=== Visual diagnosis ===
The larynx itself will often show [[erythema]] (reddening) and&amp;nbsp;[[edema]]&amp;nbsp;(swelling). This can be seen with [[laryngoscopy]] or [[Stroboscope|stroboscopy]] (method depends on the type of laryngitis).&lt;ref name=":07"/&gt;{{rp|108}} Other features of the laryngeal tissues may include
* Redness of the laryngeal tissues (acute)
* Dilated blood vessels (acute)
* Thick, yet dry laryngal tissue (chronic)
* Stiff vocal folds
* Sticky secretions between the vocal folds and nearby structures (the interarytenoid region)

=== Referral ===
Some signs and symptoms indicate the need for early referral.&lt;ref name=BMJ2014/&gt; These include
* Difficulty swallowing
* Vocal [[stridor]]
* Ear pain
* Recent weight loss
* History of smoking
* Current or recent radiotherapy treatment (in the neck region)
* Recent neck surgery or surgery involving [[Tracheal tube|endotracheal tubing]]
* Person is a professional voice user (teacher, singer, actor, call center worker, and so on)

===Differential diagnosis===
*Acute epiglottitis: This is more likely in those with [[stridor]], drooling, and painful or trouble swollowing.&lt;ref name="BMJ2014" /&gt;
*Granulomatous laryngitis
*Pseudomyxomatous laryngitis
* [[Croup]]: This presents with a barking cough, [[Hoarse voice|hoarseness]] of voice, and [[Stridor|inspiratory stridor]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Treatment==
Treatment is often supportive in nature, and depends on the severity and type of laryngitis (acute or chronic).&lt;ref name="BMJ2014"/&gt; General measures to relieve symptoms of laryngitis include behaviour modification, hydration and humidification.&lt;ref name="BMJ2014"/&gt;

Vocal hygiene (care of the voice) is very important to relieve symptoms of laryngitis.  Vocal hygiene involves measures such as: resting the voice, drinking sufficient water, reducing caffeine and alcohol intake, stopping smoking and limiting throat clearing.&lt;ref name="BMJ2014"/&gt;

=== Acute laryngitis ===
In general, acute laryngitis treatment involves vocal hygiene, painkillers ([[analgesic]]s), humidification, and antibiotics.&lt;ref name="BMJ2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rev2015/&gt;

==== Viral ====
The suggested treatment for viral laryngitis involves vocal rest, [[Analgesic|pain medication]], and mucolytics for frequent coughing.&lt;ref name=":07"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Understanding Voice Problems|last=Colton|first=Raymond H.|last2=Casper|first2=Janina K.|last3=Leonard|first3=Rebecca|last4=|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|year=2011|isbn=978-1-60913-874-5|edition=4th|location=Baltimore, MD|pages=308–309|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Home remedies such as tea and honey may also be helpful.&lt;ref name="BMJ2014"/&gt; Antibiotics are not used for treatment of viral laryngitis.&lt;ref name="BMJ2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dominguez, L. M.|last2=Simpson, C. B.|date=December 2015|title=Viral laryngitis|journal=Current Opinion in Otolaryngology &amp; Head and Neck Surgery|volume=23|issue=6|pages=454–458.|doi=10.1097/moo.0000000000000203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Bacterial ====
[[Antibiotics]] may be prescribed for bacterial laryngitis, especially when symptoms of upper respiratory infection are present.&lt;ref name=":07"/&gt; However, the use of antibiotics is highly debated for acute laryngitis.  This relates to issues of effectiveness, side effects, cost, and possibility of antibiotic resistance patterns.  Overall, antibiotics do not appear to be very effective in the treatment of acute laryngitis.&lt;ref name=Rev2015/&gt;

In severe cases of bacterial laryngitis, such as supraglottitis or epiglottitis, there is a higher risk of the airway becoming blocked.&lt;ref name=":07"/&gt; An urgent referral should be made to manage the airway.&lt;ref name="BMJ2014"/&gt; Treatment may involve humidification, [[corticosteroid]]s, intravenous antibiotics, and nebulised adrenaline.&lt;ref name=":07"/&gt;

==== Fungal ====
Fungal laryngitis can be treated with oral antifungal tablets and antifungal solutions.&lt;ref name="BMJ2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":07"/&gt;  These are typically used for up to three weeks and treatment may need to be repeated if the fungal infection returns.&lt;ref name=":07"/&gt;

====Trauma====
Laryngitis caused by excessive use or misuse of the voice can be managed though vocal hygiene measures.

=== Chronic laryngitis ===

==== Reflux ====
[[Laryngopharyngeal reflux]] treatment primarily involves behavioural management and medication.&lt;ref name="BMJ2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":07"/&gt; Behavioural management involves aspects such as
* Wearing loose clothing
* Eating smaller, more frequent meals
* Avoiding certain foods (e.g. caffeine, alcohol, spicy foods)&lt;ref name=":07"/&gt;
Anti-reflux medications may be prescribed for patients with signs of chronic laryngitis and hoarse voice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schwartz|first=Seth R.|last2=Cohen|first2=Seth M.|last3=Dailey|first3=Seth H.|last4=Rosenfeld|first4=Richard M.|last5=Deutsch|first5=Ellen S.|last6=Gillespie|first6=M. Boyd|last7=Granieri|first7=Evelyn|last8=Hapner|first8=Edie R.|last9=Kimball|first9=C. Eve|date=2009-09-01|title=Clinical Practice Guideline Hoarseness (Dysphonia)|url=http://oto.sagepub.com/content/141/3_suppl/S1|journal=Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery|language=en|volume=141|issue=3 suppl|pages=S1–S31|doi=10.1016/j.otohns.2009.06.744|issn=0194-5998|pmid=19729111|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150709154054/http://oto.sagepub.com/content/141/3_suppl/S1|archivedate=2015-07-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If anti-reflux treatment does not result in a decrease of symptoms, other possible causes should be examined.&lt;ref name="BMJ2014"/&gt;  Over-the-counter medications for neutralizing acids ([[antacid]]s) and acid suppressants ([[H2 blockers|H-2 blockers]]) may be used.&lt;ref name=":07"/&gt;  Antacids are often short-acting and may not be sufficient for treatment.&lt;ref name=":07"/&gt; [[Proton-pump inhibitor|Proton pump inhibitors]] are an effective type of medication.&lt;ref name=":07"/&gt;  These should only be prescribed for a set period of time, after which the symptoms should be reviewed.&lt;ref name="BMJ2014"/&gt; Proton pump inhibitors do not work for everyone. A physical reflux barrier (e.g. Gaviscon Liquid) may be more appropriate for some.&lt;ref name="BMJ2014"/&gt; Antisecretory medications can have several side-effects.&lt;ref name="BMJ2014"/&gt;

When appropriate, anti-reflux surgery may benefit some individuals.&lt;ref name="BMJ2014"/&gt;

==== Inflammatory ====
When treating allergic laryngitis, topical nasal steroids and [[immunotherapy]] have been found to be effective for [[allergic rhinitis]].&lt;ref name=":07"/&gt;  [[Antihistamine]]s may also be helpful, but can create a dryness in the larynx.&lt;ref name=":07" /&gt; Inhaled steroids that are used for a long period can lead to problems with the larynx and voice.&lt;ref name=":07" /&gt;

==== Autoimmune ====
[[Mucous membrane pemphigoid]] may be managed with medication ([[cyclophosphamide]] and [[prednisolone]]).&lt;ref name="BMJ2014"/&gt;

==== Granulomatous ====
[[Sarcoidosis]] is typically treated with [[systemic corticosteroids]]. Less frequently used treatments include intralesional injections or laser resection.&lt;ref name="BMJ2014"/&gt;

==Prognosis==

=== Acute ===
Acute laryngitis may persist, but will typically resolve on its own within two weeks.&lt;ref name="BMJ2014"/&gt; Recovery is likely to be quick if the patient follows the treatment plan.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jonas|first=Nico|year=2007|title=Laryngitis Management|journal=Journal of Modern Pharmacy|volume=14|issue=5|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; In viral laryngitis, symptoms can persist for an extended amount of time, even when upper respiratory tract inflammation has been resolved.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt;

=== Chronic ===
Laryngitis that continues for more than three weeks is considered [[chronic condition|chronic]].&lt;ref name="BMJ2014"/&gt; If laryngeal symptoms last for more than three weeks, a referral should be made for further examination, including direct [[laryngoscopy]].&lt;ref name="BMJ2014" /&gt; The prognosis for chronic laryngitis varies depending on the cause of the laryngitis.&lt;ref name=":42"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11293">Major contributions to the science of [[microbiology]] (as a [[scientific discipline|discipline]] in its modern sense) have spanned the time from the mid-17th century to the present day. The following is a list of prominent [[microbiologist]]s who have made significant contributions to the study of [[microorganisms]]. Many of those listed have received a [[Nobel prize]] for their contributions to the field of microbiology. The others are typically considered historical figures whose work in microbiology had a notable impact in the field. Those microbiologists who currently work in the field have been excluded unless they have received recognition beyond that of being on the faculty in a college or university.

== Proto-microbiologists (pre-1670s) ==
* [[Marcus Terentius Varro]] 
* [[Avicenna]] 
* [[Girolamo Fracastoro]]
* [[Marcello Malpighi]]
* [[Athanasius Kircher]]

[[File:John Paul II Medal of Freedom 2004.jpg|thumb|[[Pope John Paul II]] was the subject of three premature obituaries.]]
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;!-- See [[Wikipedia talk:Featured lists]] for an explanation of this and other inclusion tags below --&gt;
A '''premature obituary''' is an [[obituary]] published whose subject is not actually deceased at the time of publication. Examples of premature obituaries include that of inventor, businessman, and chemist  [[Alfred Nobel]], whose premature obituary condemning him as a "merchant of death" may have caused him to create the [[Nobel Prize]];&lt;ref name="TIME20001016"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and actor [[Abe Vigoda]], who was the subject of so many premature obituaries that a website was created to state whether he was alive or dead.

This article lists the recipients of incorrect death reports (not just formal [[obituary|obituaries]]) from publications, media organisations, official bodies, and widely used information sources such as the [[Internet Movie Database]]; but not mere rumours of deaths, nor reports from sites which feature automated death hoax stories designed to draw in page clicks from specific web searches. People who were presumed (though not categorically declared) to be dead, and joke death reports that were widely believed, are also included.&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

==Causes==
Premature obituaries may be published for reasons such as the following:
* '''Accidental publication''': accidental release of a pre-written obituary, usually on a news web site, as a result of technical or human error. The most egregious example was when, in 2003, [[#The CNN.com incident|CNN accidentally released]] draft obituaries for seven major world figures.
* '''Brush with death''': when the subject unexpectedly survives a serious life-threatening illness or accident which made the person appear to be dead or certain to die, or, in some cases, is hours or days from their actual death due to such an illness or accident but has not actually died at the time of publication of the premature obituary.
* '''Clerical errors''': due to clerical errors, almost 500 living people in the United States are inadvertently considered dead each month by the [[Social Security Administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/08/10/489318279/social-security-data-errors-can-turn-people-into-the-living-dead|title=Social Security Data Errors Can Turn People Into The Living Dead|newspaper=NPR.org|access-date=January 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Faked death]]''': when the subject fakes their own death in order to evade legal, financial, or marital difficulties and start a new life.
* '''Fraud victim''': many people from [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[India]] have been registered dead by officials who are bribed by relatives who want to steal the victim's land. The ensuing legal disputes often continue for many years, with victims growing elderly and sometimes dying in reality before they are resolved (see [[Association of Dead People]]).
*'''[[Death hoax|Hoax]]''': when a death is falsely reported, generally as a prank. Some websites (notably mediamass.net)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wafflesatnoon.com/mediamass-fake-news/|title=Mediamass.net: Fake News That Fooled Real News}}&lt;/ref&gt; publish both celebrity death hoaxes and refutations of actual celebrity deaths as a form of [[clickbait]].
*'''[[Impostor]]''': when an ordinary person who for years has passed himself off to family and friends as a retired minor celebrity dies, it can prompt an erroneous obituary for the real (but still living) celebrity.
* '''Misidentified body''': when a corpse is misidentified as someone else, often someone who was involved in the same incident or who happened to go missing at the same time.
*'''[[Missing in action]]''': soldiers who go missing in war are sometimes incorrectly declared dead if no body is found. In particular, a number of [[Japanese holdout|Japanese soldiers]] thought to have died in World War II in fact survived – typically hiding in a remote jungle for years or even decades, believing that the war had not ended.
* '''Misunderstandings''': such as when a [[Sky News]] employee thought that a rehearsal for the future death of the [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Queen Mother]] was real. 
* '''Name confusion''': where someone with an identical or similar name has died. Usually the subject of the obituary is famous but the deceased person is not.

After obituaries of the Iraqi general, politician and first-cousin of [[Saddam Hussein]] were published in many newspapers, reports then circulated that he had escaped by boat, and subsequently been seen joking with staff in a hospital in [[Baghdad]]. Al-Majid was captured several months later, and sentenced to death in 2007 for war crimes.&lt;ref name="Telegraph20030821"&gt;{{Cite news

*'''[[John Allen (murderer)|John Allen]]''', a serial criminal, faked his own suicide by drowning off [[Beachy Head]] (Britain's most notorious suicide spot) in 1966 to escape prosecution for [[theft]], presumably resulting in his being declared dead. He in fact swam around the coast, retrieved dry clothes that he had hidden, and took up a new identity. However, his crimes continued, including further thefts and [[bigamy]]. In 2002 he was jailed for life for having murdered his wife and children in 1975. He died in 2015.&lt;ref name="Independent20021217"&gt;{{Cite news

He had been reported killed in action. On his return home, Yokoi was treated as a national hero for his extreme tenacity and loyalty. However, he felt he had not served the Emperor and army adequately, saying "It is with much embarrassment that I have returned alive" – which instantly became a popular saying in Japan. Yokoi's experiences enabled him to become a television commentator on survival skills.

Multiple premature obituaries came to light on April 16, 2003, when it was discovered that pre-written draft memorials to several world figures were available on the development area of the [[CNN]] website without requiring a password (and may have been accessible for some time before).

Some of these obituaries contained fragments taken from others, particularly from [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother]]'s obituary, which had apparently been used as a template. Dick Cheney for example was described as the "UK's favorite grandmother", the site noted the Pope's 'love of racing', and described Castro as "lifeguard, athlete, movie star" (a reference to Ronald Reagan). Although the Queen Mother was already dead, in an unrelated incident she had [[#E|previously received a premature obituary of her own]].

==Premature obituaries in fiction==

Upon the discovery of her apparent death, she is laid to rest in her family crypt. Romeo, believing that Juliet has actually died, then kills himself by drinking poison. Juliet soon awakens and, finding Romeo dead, stabs herself to death with Romeo's dagger.

{{Infobox manganese}}
'''Manganese''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Mn''' and [[atomic number]] 25. It is not found as a [[free element]] in nature; it is often found in [[mineral]]s in combination with [[iron]]. Manganese is a metal with important industrial metal [[alloy]] uses, particularly in [[stainless steel]]s.

Historically, manganese is named for [[pyrolusite]] and other black minerals from the region of [[Magnesia (regional unit)|Magnesia]] in Greece, which also gave its name to [[magnesium]] and the [[iron]] ore [[magnetite]]. By the mid-18th century, [[Sweden|Swedish-]][[Germanic peoples|German]] [[chemist]] [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]] had used pyrolusite to produce [[chlorine]]. Scheele and others were aware that pyrolusite (now known to be [[manganese dioxide]]) contained a new element, but they were unable to isolate it. [[Johan Gottlieb Gahn]] was the first to isolate an impure sample of manganese metal in 1774, which he did by [[reduction-oxidation|reducing]] the dioxide with [[carbon]].

[[Phosphate conversion coating|Manganese phosphating]] is used for rust and corrosion prevention on [[steel]]. Ionized manganese is used industrially as [[pigment]]s of various colors, which depend on the oxidation state of the ions. The [[permanganate]]s of [[alkali metal|alkali]] and [[alkaline earth metal]]s are powerful oxidizers. Manganese dioxide is used as the [[cathode]] (electron acceptor) material in [[Zinc-carbon battery|zinc-carbon]] and [[Alkaline battery|alkaline batteries]].

In biology, manganese(II) ions function as [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]] for a large variety of [[enzymes]] with many functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roth |first1=Jerome |last2=Ponzoni |first2=Silvia |last3=Aschner |first3=Michael|editor1-first=Lucia |editor1-last=Banci |series=Metal Ions in Life Sciences |volume=12|chapter=Chapter 6 Manganese Homeostasis and Transport|title=Metallomics and the Cell |date=2013 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-94-007-5560-4|doi=10.1007/978-94-007-5561-1_6}} electronic-book {{ISBN|978-94-007-5561-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manganese enzymes are particularly essential in detoxification of [[superoxide]] free radicals in organisms that must deal with elemental [[oxygen]]. Manganese also functions in the oxygen-evolving complex of photosynthetic [[plants]]. While the element is a required trace mineral for all known living organisms, it also acts as a [[neurotoxin]] in larger amounts. Especially through inhalation, it can cause [[manganism]], a condition in mammals leading to neurological damage that is sometimes irreversible.

Manganese is a silvery-gray [[metal]] that resembles iron. It is hard and very brittle, difficult to fuse, but easy to oxidize.&lt;ref name="Holl"&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|date=1985|edition=91–100 |pages=1110–1117|isbn=978-3-11-007511-3|title=Lehrbuch der Anorganischen Chemie|first=Arnold F.|last=Holleman|author2=Wiberg, Egon|author3=Wiberg, Nils|language=German|chapter=Mangan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manganese metal and its common ions are [[paramagnetic]].&lt;ref name=magnet&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www-d0.fnal.gov/hardware/cal/lvps_info/engineering/elementmagn.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303222309/http://www-d0.fnal.gov/hardware/cal/lvps_info/engineering/elementmagn.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-03-03|title=Magnetic susceptibility of the elements and inorganic compounds, in Handbook of Chemistry and Physics |publisher=CRC press |isbn=978-0-8493-0485-9|first=David R. |last=Lide|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manganese tarnishes slowly in air and oxidizes ("rusts") like iron in water containing dissolved oxygen.

===Isotopes===
{{Main|Isotopes of manganese}}
Naturally occurring manganese is composed of one stable [[isotope]], &lt;sup&gt;55&lt;/sup&gt;Mn. Eighteen [[radioisotope]]s have been isolated and described, ranging in [[atomic weight]] from 46 [[atomic mass unit|u]] (&lt;sup&gt;46&lt;/sup&gt;Mn) to 65 u (&lt;sup&gt;65&lt;/sup&gt;Mn). The most stable are &lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt;Mn with a [[half-life]] of 3.7 million years, &lt;sup&gt;54&lt;/sup&gt;Mn with a half-life of 312.3 days, and &lt;sup&gt;52&lt;/sup&gt;Mn with a half-life of 5.591 days. All of the remaining [[radioactive]] isotopes have half-lives of less than three hours, and the majority of less than one minute. The primary [[decay mode]] before the most abundant stable isotope, &lt;sup&gt;55&lt;/sup&gt;Mn, is [[electron capture]] and the primary mode after is [[beta decay]].&lt;ref name="Audi" /&gt; Manganese also has three [[meta state]]s.&lt;ref name="Audi"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Audi|first=Georges|title=The NUBASE Evaluation of Nuclear and Decay Properties|journal=Nuclear Physics A|volume=729|issue=1|pages=3–128 |date=2003 |doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001|bibcode=2003NuPhA.729....3A |last2=Bersillon |first2=O. |last3=Blachot |first3=J. |last4=Wapstra |first4=A. H.|url=http://hal.in2p3.fr/in2p3-00014184|citeseerx=10.1.1.692.8504}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manganese is part of the [[iron]] group of elements, which are thought to be synthesized in large [[star]]s shortly before the [[supernova]] explosion. &lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt;Mn decays to &lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt;[[chromium|Cr]] with a [[half-life]] of 3.7 million years. Because of its relatively short half-life, &lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt;Mn is relatively rare, produced by [[cosmic rays]] impact on [[iron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schaefer |first=Jeorg|last2=Faestermann |first2=Thomas |title=Terrestrial manganese-53 – A new monitor of Earth surface processes |journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|volume=251|issue=3–4 |pages=334–345|date=2006 |doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2006.09.016 |bibcode=2006E&amp;PSL.251..334S |last3=Herzog |first3=Gregory F. |last4=Knie |first4=Klaus |last5=Korschinek |first5=Gunther |last6=Masarik |first6=Jozef |last7=Meier |first7=Astrid |last8=Poutivtsev |first8=Michail |last9=Rugel |first9=Georg |last10=Schlüchter |first10=Christian |last11=Serifiddin |first11=Feride |last12=Winckler |first12=Gisela}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manganese isotopic contents are typically combined with [[chromium]] isotopic contents and have found application in [[isotope geology]] and [[radiometric dating]].

The most common [[oxidation state]]s of manganese are +2, +3, +4, +6, and +7, though all oxidation states from −3 to +7 have been observed. Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; often competes with Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in biological systems. Manganese compounds where manganese is in oxidation state +7, which are mostly restricted to the unstable oxide Mn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;, compounds of the intensely purple permanganate anion MnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, and a few oxyhalides (MnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F and MnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl), are powerful [[oxidation|oxidizing agents]].&lt;ref name="Holl"/&gt; Compounds with oxidation states +5 (blue) and +6 (green) are strong oxidizing agents and are vulnerable to [[disproportionation]].

The most stable oxidation state for manganese is +2, which has a pale pink color, and many manganese(II) compounds are known, such as [[manganese(II) sulfate]] (MnSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[manganese(II) chloride]] (MnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). This oxidation state is also seen in the mineral rhodochrosite ([[manganese(II) carbonate]]). Manganese(II) most commonly exists with a high spin, S = 5/2 ground state because of the high pairing energy for manganese(II). However, there are a few examples of low-spin, S =1/2 manganese(II).&lt;ref name="Saha 1703–1708"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Saha|first=Amrita|last2=Majumdar|first2=Partha|last3=Goswami|first3=Sreebrata|title=Low-spin manganese(II) and cobalt(III) complexes of N-aryl-2-pyridylazophenylamines: new tridentate N,N,N-donors derived from cobalt mediated aromatic ring amination of 2-(phenylazo)pyridine.

The +3 oxidation state is known in compounds like [[manganese(III) acetate]], but these are quite powerful [[Redox|oxidizing agents]] and also prone to [[disproportionation]] in solution, forming manganese(II) and manganese(IV). Solid compounds of manganese(III) are characterized by its strong purple-red color and a preference for distorted octahedral coordination resulting from the [[Jahn-Teller effect]].

The oxidation state +5 can be produced by dissolving manganese dioxide in molten [[sodium nitrite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=R. B. |last=Temple|author2=Thickett, G.

==History==
The origin of the name manganese is complex. In ancient times, two black minerals from [[Magnesia (regional unit)|Magnesia]] (located within modern Greece) were both called ''magnes'' from their place of origin, but were thought to differ in gender. The male ''magnes'' attracted iron, and was the iron ore now known as [[lodestone]] or [[magnetite]], and which probably gave us the term [[magnet]]. The female ''magnes'' ore did not attract iron, but was used to decolorize glass. This feminine ''magnes'' was later called ''magnesia'', known now in modern times as [[pyrolusite]] or [[manganese dioxide]]. Neither this mineral nor elemental manganese is magnetic. In the 16th century, manganese dioxide was called ''manganesum'' (note the two Ns instead of one) by glassmakers, possibly as a corruption and concatenation of two words, since alchemists and glassmakers eventually had to differentiate a ''magnesia negra'' (the black ore) from ''magnesia alba'' (a white ore, also from Magnesia, also useful in glassmaking). [[Michele Mercati]] called magnesia negra ''manganesa'', and finally the metal isolated from it became known as ''manganese'' (German: ''Mangan''). The name ''magnesia'' eventually was then used to refer only to the white [[magnesia alba]] (magnesium oxide), which provided the name [[magnesium]] for the free element when it was isolated much later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Calvert|first=J.

Several colorful oxides of manganese, for example [[Manganese(IV) oxide|manganese dioxide]], are abundant in nature and have been used as pigments since the [[Stone Age]].

Manganese compounds were used by Egyptian and Roman glassmakers, either to add to, or remove color from glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.133.3467.1824|date=1961|last=Sayre|first=E.

[[File:Gahn Johan Gottlieb.jpg|thumb|Credit for first isolating manganese is usually given to [[Johan Gottlieb Gahn]].]]

Because it was used in glassmaking, [[Manganese(IV) oxide|manganese dioxide]] was available for experiments by alchemists, the first chemists. [[Ignatius Gottfried Kaim]] (1770) and [[Johann Glauber]] (17th century) discovered that manganese dioxide could be converted to [[permanganate]], a useful laboratory reagent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Centaurus|volume=19|issue=4|title=The Discovery of an Element|first=E.|last=Rancke-Madsen|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0498.1975.tb00329.x|pages=299–313|date=1975|bibcode=1975Cent...19..299R}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-18th century, the Swedish chemist [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]] used manganese dioxide to produce [[chlorine]]. First, [[hydrochloric acid]], or a mixture of dilute [[sulfuric acid]] and [[sodium chloride]] was made to react with manganese dioxide, later hydrochloric acid from the [[Leblanc process]] was used and the manganese dioxide was recycled by the [[Weldon process]]. The production of chlorine and [[hypochlorite]] [[bleach]]ing agents was a large consumer of manganese ores.

Scheele and other chemists were aware that manganese dioxide contained a new element, but they were not able to isolate it. [[Johan Gottlieb Gahn]] was the first to isolate an impure sample of manganese metal in 1774, by [[reduction-oxidation|reducing]] the dioxide with [[carbon]].

The manganese content of some iron ores used in Greece led to speculations that steel produced from that ore contains additional manganese, making the [[Sparta]]n steel exceptionally hard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/ajim.20524|date=2007|title=From lead to manganese through mercury: mythology, science, and lessons for prevention|volume=50|issue=11|pages=779–787 |journal=American Journal of Industrial Medicine|pmid=17918211|last1=Alessio|first1=L.|last2=Campagna|first2=M.|last3=Lucchini|first3=R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the beginning of the 19th century, manganese was used in steelmaking and several patents were granted. In 1816, it was documented that iron alloyed with manganese was harder but not more brittle. In 1837, British academic [[James Couper (academic)|James Couper]] noted an association between miners' heavy exposure to manganese with a form of [[Parkinson's disease]].&lt;ref name="Couper 1837 41–42"/&gt; In 1912, United States patents were granted for protecting firearms against rust and corrosion with manganese phosphate electrochemical conversion coatings, and the process has seen widespread use ever since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Production of Manganese Ferroalloys|publisher=Tapir Academic Press |date=2007|isbn=978-82-519-2191-6|chapter=History of omanganese|pages=11–12|author=Olsen, Sverre E.|author2=Tangstad, Merete |author3=Lindstad, Tor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The invention of the [[Leclanché cell]] in 1866 and the subsequent improvement of batteries containing manganese dioxide as cathodic [[depolarizer]] increased the demand for manganese dioxide. Until the development of batteries with [[nickel-cadmium battery|nickel-cadmium]] and lithium, most batteries contained manganese. The [[zinc-carbon battery]] and the [[alkaline battery]] normally use industrially produced manganese dioxide because naturally occurring manganese dioxide contains impurities. In the 20th century, [[manganese(IV) oxide|manganese dioxide]] was widely used as the cathodic for commercial disposable dry batteries of both the standard (zinc-carbon) and alkaline types.&lt;ref name="ChiuZMnO2"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/ciuz.19800140502|title=Moderne Verfahren der Großchemie: Braunstein |date=1980|last=Preisler|first=Eberhard|journal=Chemie in Unserer Zeit|language=German|volume=14|pages=137–148|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more progressive extraction process involves directly reducing manganese ore in a heap leach. This is done by percolating natural gas through the bottom of the heap; the natural gas provides the heat (needs to be at least 850&amp;nbsp;°C) and the reducing agent (carbon monoxide). This reduces all of the manganese ore to manganese oxide (MnO), which is a leachable form. The ore then travels through a grinding circuit to reduce the particle size of the ore to between 150–250 μm, increasing the surface area to aid leaching. The ore is then added to a leach tank of [[sulfuric acid]] and ferrous iron (Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) in a 1.6:1 ratio. The iron reacts with the manganese dioxide to form [[iron hydroxide]] and elemental manganese. This process yields approximately 92% recovery of the manganese.

In 1972 the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]'s [[Project Azorian]], through billionaire [[Howard Hughes]], commissioned the ship ''[[Hughes Glomar Explorer]]'' with the cover story of harvesting manganese nodules from the sea floor. That triggered a rush of activity to collect manganese nodules, which was not actually practical. The real mission of ''Hughes Glomar Explorer'' was to raise a sunken [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Soviet]] submarine, the [[Soviet submarine K-129 (1960)|K-129]], with the goal of retrieving Soviet code books.&lt;ref name="azorian"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/nukevault/ebb305/index.htm |title=Project Azorian: The CIA's Declassified History of the Glomar Explorer |publisher=National Security Archive at George Washington University |date=2010-02-12 |accessdate=2013-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Manganese has no satisfactory substitute in its major applications in metallurgy.&lt;ref name=USGSMCS2009/&gt; In minor applications, (e.g., manganese phosphating), [[zinc]] and sometimes [[vanadium]] are viable substitutes.

===Steel===
[[File:M1917helmet.jpg|thumb|U.S. M1917 [[combat helmet]], a variant of [[Brodie helmet]], made from [[Hadfield steel]] manganese alloy.]]
Manganese is essential to iron and [[steelmaking|steel production]] by virtue of its sulfur-fixing, [[deoxidized steel|deoxidizing]], and [[alloying]] properties, as first recognized by the British metallurgist [[Robert Forester Mushet]] (1811–1891) who, in 1856, introduced the element, in the form of [[Spiegeleisen]], into steel for the specific purpose of removing excess dissolved oxygen, sulfur, and phosphorus in order to improve its malleability. [[Steelmaking]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=978-0-87170-858-8|pages=56–57|first=John D. |last=Verhoeven|date=2007|publisher=ASM International|location=Materials Park, Ohio|title=Steel metallurgy for the non-metallurgist}}&lt;/ref&gt; including its ironmaking component, has accounted for most manganese demand, presently in the range of 85% to 90% of the total demand.&lt;ref name="hydrometI"/&gt; Manganese is a key component of low-cost [[stainless steel]].&lt;ref name="MangUSGS2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF02648339|title=Mechanism of work hardening in Hadfield manganese steel|date=1981|last=Dastur|first=Y.

C.|issue=5|bibcode=1981MTA....12..749D}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often [[ferromanganese]] (usually about 80% manganese) is the intermediate in modern processes.

Small amounts of manganese improve the workability of steel at high temperatures by forming a high-melting sulfide and preventing the formation of a liquid [[iron sulfide]] at the grain boundaries. If the manganese content reaches 4%, the embrittlement of the steel becomes a dominant feature. The embrittlement decreases at higher manganese concentrations and reaches an acceptable level at 8%. Steel containing 8 to 15% of manganese has a high [[tensile strength]] of up to 863&amp;nbsp;MPa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=978-1-4086-2616-0 |pages=351–352|title=Iron and Steel|first=John Henry|last=Stansbie|publisher=Read Books|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FyogLqUxW1cC&amp;pg=PA351|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=978-0-07-136076-0|pages=585–587|last=Brady|first=George S.|author2=Clauser, Henry R. |author3=Vaccari.

===Aluminium alloys===
{{Main|Aluminium alloy}}
The second largest application for manganese is in aluminium alloys. Aluminium with roughly 1.5% manganese has increased resistance to corrosion through grains that absorb impurities which would lead to [[galvanic corrosion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.suppliersonline.com/propertypages/2024.asp|title=Chemical properties of 2024 aluminum allow|accessdate=2009-04-30 |publisher=Metal Suppliers Online, LLC.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The corrosion-resistant [[aluminium alloy]]s 3004 and 3104 (0.8 to 1.5% manganese) are used for most [[beverage can]]s.&lt;ref name="Al3004"&gt;{{cite book |title=Introduction to aluminum alloys and tempers|first=John Gilbert |last=Kaufman|publisher=ASM International|date=2000|isbn=978-0-87170-689-8|chapter=Applications for Aluminium Alloys and Tempers |pages=93–94|url=https://books.google.com/?id=idmZIDcwCykC&amp;pg=PA93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before 2000, more than 1.6 million [[tonne]]s of those alloys were used; at 1% manganese, this consumed 16,000 tonnes of manganese.{{failed verification|date=September 2018}}&lt;ref name="Al3004" /&gt;

===Other uses===
[[Methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl]] is used as an additive in [[unleaded gasoline]] to boost [[octane rating]] and reduce [[engine knocking]]. The manganese in this unusual organometallic compound is in the +1 oxidation state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Leigh A. Graham|author2=Alison R. Fout|author3=Karl R. Kuehne|author4=Jennifer L.

[[Manganese(IV) oxide]] (manganese dioxide, MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is used as a reagent in [[organic chemistry]] for the [[oxidation]] of benzylic [[alcohol]]s (where the [[hydroxyl]] group is adjacent to an [[aromatic ring]]). Manganese dioxide has been used since antiquity to oxidize and neutralize the greenish tinge in glass from trace amounts of iron contamination.&lt;ref name="ItGlass"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11837-998-0024-0|title=Glassmaking in renaissance Italy: The innovation of venetian cristallo|date=1998|last=Mccray |first=W.

In some preparations, it is a brown [[pigment]] for [[paint]] and is a constituent of natural [[umber]].

[[Manganese(IV) oxide]] was used in the original type of dry cell [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] as an electron acceptor from zinc, and is the blackish material in carbon–zinc type flashlight cells. The manganese dioxide is reduced to the manganese oxide-hydroxide MnO(OH) during discharging, preventing the formation of hydrogen at the anode of the battery.&lt;ref name="BattHist"/&gt;

The same material also functions in newer [[Alkaline battery|alkaline batteries]] (usually battery cells), which use the same basic reaction, but a different electrolyte mixture. In 2002, more than 230,000&amp;nbsp;tons of manganese dioxide was used for this purpose.&lt;ref name="ChiuZMnO2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BattHist"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00722-0|title=Batteries fifty years of materials development|date=2000|last=Dell|first=R.

The metal is occasionally used in coins; until 2000, the only United States coin to use manganese was the [[Jefferson nickel#1938–1945: Early minting; World War II changes|"wartime" nickel]] from 1942 to 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Western Journal of Medicine |date=2001|volume=175|issue=2|pages=112–114|first=Raymond T.|last=Kuwahara|author2=Skinner III, Robert B. |author3=Skinner Jr., Robert B. |title=Nickel coinage in the United States|doi=10.1136/ewjm.175.2.112|pmid=11483555|pmc=1071501}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alloy of 75% copper and 25% nickel was traditionally used for the production of nickel coins. However, because of shortage of nickel metal during the war, it was substituted by more available silver and manganese, thus resulting in an alloy of 56% copper, 35% silver and 9% manganese. Since 2000, [[Dollar (United States coin)|dollar coins]], for example the [[Sacagawea dollar]] and the [[Presidential $1 Coin Program|Presidential $1 coins]], are made from a brass containing 7% of manganese with a pure copper core.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.usmint.gov/mint_programs/golden_dollar_coin/index.cfm?action=sacDesign|title=Design of the Sacagawea dollar|publisher=United States Mint |accessdate=2009-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases of nickel and dollar, the use of manganese in the coin was to duplicate the electromagnetic properties of a previous identically sized and valued coin in the mechanisms of vending machines. In the case of the later U.S. dollar coins, the manganese alloy was intended to duplicate the properties of the copper/nickel alloy used in the previous [[Susan B. Anthony dollar]]. &lt;!--The EU uses manganese in 1 and 2 Euro coins, due to greater and cheaper availability.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}--&gt;

Manganese compounds have been used as pigments and for the coloring of ceramics and glass. The brown color of ceramic is sometimes the result of manganese compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ceramics for the Archaeologist|first=Anna Osler|last=Shepard|publisher=Carnegie Institution of Washington|date=1956|pages=40–42|isbn=978-0-87279-620-1|chapter=Manganese and Iron–Manganese Paints}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the glass industry, manganese compounds are used for two effects. Manganese(III) reacts with iron(II) to induce a strong green color in glass by forming less-colored iron(III) and slightly pink manganese(II), compensating for the residual color of the iron(III).&lt;ref name="ItGlass" /&gt; Larger quantities of manganese are used to produce pink colored glass.

==Biological role==
[[File:Arginase.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.3|Reactive center of arginase with boronic acid [[Enzyme inhibitor|inhibitor]] – the manganese atoms are shown in yellow.]]
Manganese is an important element for human health, essential for development, metabolism, and the antioxidant system. Nevertheless, excessive exposure or intake may lead to a condition known as [[manganism]], a [[Neurodegeneration|neurodegenerative]] disorder that causes dopaminergic neuronal death and symptoms similar to [[Parkinson's disease]].&lt;ref name="Emsley2001" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Daiana|last1=Silva Avila|first2=Robson|last2=Luiz Puntel|first3=Michael|last3=Aschner|editor=Astrid Sigel|editor2=Helmut Sigel |editor3=Roland K.

The [[reverse transcriptase]]s of many [[retrovirus]]es (though not [[lentivirus]]es such as [[HIV]]) contain manganese. The best-known manganese-containing [[polypeptides]] may be [[arginase]], the [[diphtheria toxin]], and Mn-containing [[superoxide dismutase]] ([[Mn-SOD]]).&lt;ref name="Mnzym"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0898-8838(08)60152-X|title=Manganese Redox Enzymes and Model Systems: Properties, Structures, and Reactivity|date=1998|last=Law|first=N.|volume=46|page=305|last2=Caudle|first2=M.|last3=Pecoraro|first3=V.|series=Advances in Inorganic Chemistry|isbn=9780120236466}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mn-SOD is the type of SOD present in eukaryotic [[mitochondria]], and also in most bacteria (this fact is in keeping with the bacterial-origin theory of mitochondria). The Mn-SOD enzyme is probably one of the most ancient, for nearly all organisms living in the presence of oxygen use it to deal with the toxic effects of [[superoxide]] ({{chem|O|2|-}}), formed from the 1-electron reduction of dioxygen. The exceptions, which are all bacteria, include ''[[Lactobacillus plantarum]]'' and related [[lactobacillus|lactobacilli]], which use a different nonenzymatic mechanism with manganese (Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) ions complexed with polyphosphate, suggesting a path of evolution for this function in aerobic life.

The human body contains about 12&amp;nbsp;mg of manganese, mostly in the bones. The soft tissue remainder is concentrated in the liver and kidneys.&lt;ref name="Emsley2001"/&gt; In the human brain, the manganese is bound to manganese [[metalloprotein]]s, most notably [[glutamine synthetase]] in [[astrocyte]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0165-0173(02)00234-5|title=Manganese action in brain function|date=2003 |last=Takeda |first=A.|journal=Brain Research Reviews|volume=41|issue=1|pmid=12505649|pages=79–87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manganese is also important in photosynthetic [[oxygen evolution]] in [[chloroplast]]s in plants.

The U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) updated Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for minerals in 2001. For manganese there was not sufficient information to set EARs and RDAs, so needs are described as estimates for [[Adequate Intake]]s (AIs). As for safety, the IOM sets [[Tolerable upper intake level]]s (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of manganese the adult UL is set at 11&amp;nbsp;mg/day. Collectively the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs are referred to as [[Dietary Reference Intake]]s (DRIs).&lt;ref name=MnDRI&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Manganese|url=https://www.nap.edu/read/10026/chapter/12 |title=Dietary Reference Intakes for Vitamin A, Vitamin K, Arsenic, Boron, Chromium, Chromium, Iodine, Iron, Manganese, Molybdenum, Nickel, Silicon, Vanadium, and Chromium|publisher= National Academy Press|year= 2001|pages=394–419|pmid=25057538|isbn=978-0-309-07279-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manganese deficiency is rare.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' {{cite web|url=http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/minerals/manganese |title=Manganese|work=Micronutrient Information Center|publisher=[[Oregon State University]] [[Linus Pauling Institute]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manganese compounds are less toxic than those of other widespread metals, such as [[nickel]] and [[copper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=31 |title=Manganese|first=Heather|last=Hasan|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|date=2008|isbn=978-1-4042-1408-8 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=nRmpEaudmTYC&amp;pg=PA31}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, exposure to manganese dusts and fumes should not exceed the ceiling value of 5&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; even for short periods because of its toxicity level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environmentwriter.org/resources/backissues/chemicals/manganese.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060828211701/http://www.environmentwriter.org/resources/backissues/chemicals/manganese.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=28 August 2006 |title=Manganese Chemical Background |accessdate=2008-04-30 |publisher=Metcalf Institute for Marine and Environmental Reporting University of Rhode Island |date=April 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--Manganese poses a particular risk for children due to its propensity to bind to CH-7 receptors.{{Clarify|date=September 2011}}--&gt; Manganese poisoning has been linked to impaired motor skills and cognitive disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rais.ornl.gov/tox/profiles/mn.html|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|title=Risk Assessment Information System Toxicity Summary for Manganese|accessdate=2008-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The permanganate exhibits a higher toxicity than the manganese(II) compounds. The fatal dose is about 10&amp;nbsp;g, and several fatal intoxications have occurred. The strong oxidative effect leads to [[necrosis]] of the [[mucous membrane]]. For example, the [[esophagus]] is affected if the permanganate is swallowed. Only a limited amount is absorbed by the intestines, but this small amount shows severe effects on the kidneys and on the liver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1136/emj.14.1.43|title=Potassium permanganate poisoning – a rare cause of fatal self poisoning|date=1997|last=Ong|first=K.

Manganese exposure in [[United States]] is regulated by the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA).&lt;ref name="osha.gov"&gt;{{cite web|title=Safety and Health Topics: Manganese Compounds (as Mn)|url=https://www.osha.gov/dts/chemicalsampling/data/CH_250190.html|publisher=U.S. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; People can be exposed to manganese in the workplace by breathing it in or swallowing it. OSHA has set the legal limit ([[permissible exposure limit]]) for manganese exposure in the workplace as 5&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; over an 8-hour workday. The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) has set a [[recommended exposure limit]] (REL) of 1&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; over an 8-hour workday and a short term limit of 3&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

Generally, exposure to ambient Mn air concentrations in excess of 5 μg Mn/m3 can lead to Mn-induced symptoms. Increased [[ferroportin]] protein expression in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells is associated with decreased intracellular Mn concentration and attenuated [[cytotoxicity]], characterized by the reversal of Mn-reduced [[glutamate]] uptake and diminished [[lactate dehydrogenase]] leakage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=20002294|last1=Yin|first1=Z.|date=2010|pages=1190–8|issue=5|volume=112|last2=Jiang|first2=H.|journal=Journal of Neurochemistry|last3=Lee|first3=E.

===Manganese in gasoline===
[[File:Methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl.tif|thumb|Molecular model of [[methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl]] (MMT)]]
[[Methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl]] (MMT) is a [[gasoline]] additive used to replace lead compounds for unleaded gasolines to improve the [[octane rating]] of low octane petroleum distillates. It reduces [[Engine knocking|engine knock]] agent through the action of the [[Carbonyl|carbonyl groups]]. Fuels containing manganese tend to form manganese carbides, which damage [[exhaust valve]]s. Compared to 1953, levels of manganese in air have dropped.&lt;ref&gt;Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (2012) [http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp151-c6.pdf 6. Potential for human exposure], in [http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/ToxProfiles/tp.asp?id=102&amp;tid=23 ''Toxicological Profile for Manganese''], Atlanta, GA: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.&lt;/ref&gt; Many racing competitions specifically ban manganese compounds in racing fuel for carts and minibikes. MMT contains 24.4–25.2% manganese. Elevated atmospheric manganese concentrations are strongly correlated with automobile traffic density. The Level of manganese emitted by MMT fuels has been found to be safe for the general population and vulnerable groups such as infants and the elderly by the EPA and European and Canadian environmental agencies.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

==Role in neurological disorders==

===Manganism===
{{Main|Manganism}}
Manganese overexposure is most frequently associated with [[manganism]], a rare neurological disorder associated with excessive manganese ingestion or inhalation. Historically, persons employed in the production or processing of manganese alloys&lt;ref&gt;Baselt, R. (2008) ''Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man'', 8th edition, Biomedical Publications, Foster City, CA, pp. 883–886, {{ISBN|0-9626523-7-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1023/A:1021970120965|date=2002|author=Normandin, Louise|journal=Metabolic Brain Disease |volume=17|pages=375–87|pmid=12602514|last2=Hazell|first2=A. S.|title=Manganese neurotoxicity: an update of pathophysiologic mechanisms |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been at risk for developing manganism; however, current health and safety regulations protect workers in developed nations.&lt;ref name="osha.gov" /&gt; The disorder was first described in 1837 by British academic John Couper, who studied two patients who were manganese grinders.&lt;ref name="Couper 1837 41–42"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Couper|first=John|title=On the effects of black oxide of manganese when inhaled into the lungs|journal=Br. Ann. Med. Pharm. Vital. Stat. Gen. Sci.|date=1837|volume=1 |pages=41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manganism is a biphasic disorder. In its early stages, an intoxicated person may experience depression, mood swings, compulsive behaviors, and psychosis. Early neurological symptoms give way to late-stage manganism, which resembles [[Parkinson's disease]]. Symptoms include weakness, monotone and slowed speech, an expressionless face, tremor, forward-leaning gait, inability to walk backwards without falling, rigidity, and general problems with dexterity, gait and balance.&lt;ref name="Couper 1837 41–42"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cersosimo 2007 340–346"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cersosimo|first=M.

Animal experiments have given the opportunity to examine the consequences of manganese overexposure under controlled conditions. In (non-aggressive) rats, manganese induces mouse-killing behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lazrishvili et al.|first1=I.|title=Manganese loading induces mouse-killing behaviour in nonaggressive rats|journal=J.

===Childhood developmental disorders===
Several recent studies attempt to examine the effects of chronic low-dose manganese overexposure on [[child development]]. The earliest study was conducted in the Chinese province of Shanxi. Drinking water there had been contaminated through improper sewage irrigation and contained 240–350&amp;nbsp;µg Mn/L. Although Mn concentrations at or below 300&amp;nbsp;µg Mn/L were considered safe at the time of the study by the US EPA and 400&amp;nbsp;µg Mn/L by the [[World Health Organization]], the 92 children sampled (between 11 and 13 years of age) from this province displayed lower performance on tests of manual dexterity and rapidity, short-term memory, and visual identification, compared to children from an uncontaminated area. More recently, a study of 10-year-old children in Bangladesh showed a relationship between Mn concentration in well water and diminished IQ scores. A third study conducted in Quebec examined school children between the ages of 6 and 15 living in homes that received water from a well containing 610&amp;nbsp;µg Mn/L; controls lived in homes that received water from a 160&amp;nbsp;µg Mn/L well. Children in the experimental group showed increased hyperactive and oppositional behavior.&lt;ref name="Bouchard 138–143" /&gt;

The current maximum safe concentration under EPA rules is 50&amp;nbsp;µg Mn/L.&lt;ref name="EPA drinking water"&gt;{{cite web|title=Drinking Water Contaminants|url=http://water.epa.gov/drink/contaminants/index.cfm|publisher=US EPA|accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neurodegenerative diseases===
A protein called [[DMT1]] is the major transporter in manganese absorption from the intestine, and may be the major transporter of manganese across the [[blood–brain barrier]]. [[DMT1]] also transports inhaled manganese across the nasal epithelium. The proposed mechanism for manganese toxicity is that dysregulation leads to oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, glutamate-mediated excitoxicity, and aggregation of proteins{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}.

''' Maude C. Davison''' (27 March 1885 – 11 June 1956) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]]-born, American nurse. After a career in Canada, she moved to the United States. She served as the Chief Nurse of the [[United States Army Nurse Corps]] in the Philippines during [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]]. She received numerous awards for her military service in borth [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]] and World War&amp;nbsp;II. In 2001, she posthumously was granted a [[Distinguished Service Medal]] for her leadership of the [[Angels of Bataan]], the first and largest group of American military women taken as [[Prisoners of War]]. 

==Early life==
Maude Campbell was born on 27 March 1885 in [[Cannington, Ontario]], Canada to Janet (or Jeannette) Campbell.{{sfn|Norman|2000|p=66}} In 1894, her mother, who had immigrated from Scotland, married Abraham Sidders.{{sfn|Boarder Crossings|1914|p=1150}}{{sfn|Ontario Deaths|1920|p=1166}}{{sfn|Ontario Marriages|1894|p=833}} She graduated in 1909 from the [[Ontario Agricultural College]] with a certificate from the MacDonald School of Home Economics.{{sfn|Norman|2000|p=67}} 

==Career==
Campbell began her career as a [[dietitian]] at the [[Brandon University|Baptist College]] in [[Brandon, Manitoba]].{{sfn|Norman|2000|p=67}}{{sfn|Norman|1999|p=98}} Immigrating to the United States in 1909, she took employment in [[South Bend, Indiana]] at the Epworth Hospital as a dietitian and instructor in domestic science and remained until 1911.{{sfn|Norman|2000|p=67}}{{sfn|Boarder Crossings|1914|p=1150}} She returned from Canada in 1914{{sfn|Boarder Crossings|1914|p=1150}} and entered the Pasadena Hospital Training School for Nurses. In 1917, she graduated having earned her [[Registered nurse|RN]] designation. The following year, she joined the Nurse Reserves of the [[United States Army Nurse Corps]] and began working as a staff nurse at the base hospital of [[Camp Fremont]] in [[Palo Alto, California]]. After serving at [[Letterman General Hospital]], in San Francisco, she was sent to [[Fort Leavenworth, Kansas]] in 1920, to take up a post at the hospital for the [[United States Disciplinary Barracks]]. With this move, she became an American citizen and was transferred as a second lieutenant to the Regular Army of the Nurse Corps. Between 1921 and 1922, she was deployed to [[Coblenz]], Germany, serving with the [[Allied occupation of the Rhineland|Allied Occupation Forces]] assisting with [[Russian famine of 1921–22|Russian famine]] refugees, [[1918 flu pandemic|influenza victims]] and war casualties. Returning to the United States, in 1924, she was promoted to first lieutenant after passing the Chief Nursing Examination.{{sfn|Norman|2000|p=67}} 

Davison entered Columbia University in 1926 and earned a bachelor’s degree in home economics in 1928. Upon completion of her education, she returned to service as a nurse and dietician at several Army hospitals throughout the US. In 1939, she was deployed during [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]] to [[Fort Mills|Fort Mills Station Hospital]] on [[Corregidor|Corregidor Island]] in the [[Philippines]].{{sfn|Norman|2000|p=67}} She was promoted to captain in 1941 and placed as chief nurse of the nursing corps of the [[Philippine Department]].{{sfn|Norman|2000|p=67-68}} Most of the nurses in the Far East Command were serving under Davison with her second-in-command, [[Josephine Nesbit]], at Sternberg Hospital on the south side of [[Manila Bay]].{{sfn|Norman|1999|p=4}} When the [[Philippines Campaign (1941–42)|Japanese invaded the Philippines]], on 8 December 1941, the day after the bombing of [[Pearl Harbor]], Davison organized civilian nurses to help with the casualties,{{sfn|Norman|2000|p=68}}{{sfn|Norman|1999|pp=6–7}} sending five Army nurses and fifteen local Filipino nurses to the facility at [[Fort Stotsenburg]].{{sfn|Norman|1999|p=10}} Within a week the Fort, along with other military facilities, was in ruins and the nurses were prepared for evacuation back to Sternberg.{{sfn|Norman|1999|pp=16–17}}

Before Christmas, Davison was injured in a bombing raid and turned command over to Nesbit.{{sfn|Norman|1999|p=22}} Between Christmas and New Year's Eve 1941, all the army nurses were evacuated from Manila and sent to [[Bataan]].{{sfn|Norman|1999|p=24}} Davison left with the last of the American troops for Corregidor to coordinate the nursing activities{{sfn|Norman|2000|p=68}} in establishing two jungle hospitals, known simply as Hospital #1 and Hospital #2. From these field hospitals, the nurses carried out battlefield nursing.{{sfn|Norman|1999|p=47}} Simultaneously, she directed nurses in setting up the hospital where the troops on Corregidor had been sent in the [[Malinta Tunnel]]. The underground hospital had one central hallway that was one-hundred-yards long and eight wards established in lateral corridors.{{sfn|Norman|1999|p=97}} In April 1942, as Bataan fell, the nurses, including the Filipino civilians, were evacuated to Corregidor and the tunnel hospital.{{sfn|Norman|1999|pp=85–87}} At the end of the month, when it became evident that Corregidor would also fall, an attempt was made to evacuate some of the nurses. Davison and Colonel Wibb Cooper, the ranking medical officer, made the selections of who would be evacuated.{{sfn|Norman|1999|pp=17, 104}} Though Davison later said the twenty evacuees were chosen randomly, the nurses saw through her ruse, noting that those who were ill, wounded or fatigued or might not withstand the pressure of imprisonment were chosen.{{sfn|Norman|1999|pp=104–105}} 

Upon the [[Battle of Corregidor|Allied surrender]] in May 1942, Davison led her 66 remaining nurses to their captivity at [[Santo Tomas Internment Camp]] in Manila.{{sfn|Norman|2000|p=68}} They joined 11 [[United States Navy Nurse Corps]] personnel under the command of Lieutenant Commander [[Laura Cobb]], who had surrendered to the Japanese the previous January.{{sfn|Norman|Eifried|1995|p=106}} In September, ten of the nurses who had been part of the April evacuation joined them as their aircraft was damaged while refueling enroute to Australia and they were captured.{{sfn|Norman|Eifried|1995|p=111}} The nurses came to be known as the [[Angels of Bataan]] and were the first and largest group of American military women taken as [[Prisoners of War]] (POWs).{{sfn|Norman|1999|p=xii}} Known as a strict disciplinarian, she required her nurses to follow her rules and army regulations to the letter, despite the fact that they were in a Japanese-run camp.{{sfn|Norman|1999|p=98}}{{sfn|Norman|Eifried|1995|p=113}} Interned as POWs, she organized the prison camp hospital and continued managing her staff. Conditions in the camp caused the death of 390 of the 3,785 inmates, but none of the nurses were among the dead.{{sfn|Norman|2000|p=68}}  

After three years, on 3 February 1945, the camp was liberated and Davison was hospitalized because of her poor health.{{sfn|Norman|2000|p=68}} When the nurses arrived in the United States at the end of the month, Davison, who normally weighed {{convert|135|lbs}} weighed only {{convert|80|lbs}}.{{sfn|''The Ottawa Journal''|1945|p=2}} Her nurses credited Davison with their survival and though she was nominated for the Distinguished Service Medal, the War Decorations Board denied the honor, based upon a determination that she did not act independently but under the advice of the physicians and military commanders with whom she served. She was awarded the [[Legion of Merit]] and medically retired on 31 January 1946.{{sfn|Norman|2000|p=68}} In 1947, Davison married the Reverend Charles W. Jackson, who had served as dean of Long Beach City College.{{sfn|Norman|2000|p=68}}{{sfn|''The Hartford Courant''|1956|p=8}} The two had met many years earlier when she was working at the Baptist College and she had rented a room from his family, which had immigrated to the United States, during her nursing studies in [[Pasadena, California]].{{sfn|Norman|1999|pp=233–234}} Jackson, a widower, had two grown sons from a prior marriage who found "Davy", as they called Davison, distant and formal.{{sfn|Norman|1999|p=234}} After her marriage, she rarely had contact with her former staff,{{sfn|Norman|2000|p=68}} but in 1955 she participated in a [[Veterans Day]] parade in [[Los Angeles]], where she received a special citation of merit.{{sfn|''The Los Angeles Times''|1955|p=12}}

==Death and legacy==
Jackson died on 11 June 1956 at the Veterans Hospital in [[Long Beach, California]] following a lengthy illness.{{sfn|''The Hartford Courant''|1956|p=8}} She was buried near her mother in the Cedar Vale Cemetery, Cannington, Ontario, Canada.{{sfn|Ontario Deaths|1920|p=1166}}{{sfn|Riegler|2000}} In 2001, she was posthumously recognized with the [[Distinguished Service Medal]] due to the efforts of the surviving "Angels" such as Brigadier General [[Connie L. Slewitzke]], Senator [[Daniel Inouye]], and many others.{{sfn|Riegler|2000}}

In dentistry, '''maximum intercuspation''' refers to the [[Commonly used terms of relationship and comparison in dentistry|occlusal]] position of the [[human mandible|mandible]] in which the [[cusp (dentistry)|cusps]] of the teeth of both arches fully interpose themselves with the cusps of the teeth of the opposing arch.  This position used to be referred to as ''centric occlusion''.

This is an important jaw position, as it defines both the anterior-posterior and lateral relationships of the mandible and the [[maxilla]], as well as the superior-inferior relationship known as the '''[[vertical dimension of occlusion]]'''.  These are important considerations when evaluating a patient [[orthodontics|orthodontically]], as well as restoring them [[prosthodontics|prosthodontically]].

The '''Minister of Health''', formerly styled '''Minister of Public Health''', is a [[minister (government)|minister]] in the government of New Zealand with responsibility for the [[New Zealand Ministry of Health]] and the [[District Health Board (New Zealand)|District Health Board]]s.

The present Minister is [[David Clark (New Zealand politician)|David Clark]], a member of the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]].

==History==
The first Minister of Public Health was appointed in 1900, during the premiership of [[Richard Seddon]]. The word "Public" was dropped from the title when Sir [[Māui Pōmare]] took over the portfolio from 27 June 1923, as simply "Minister of Health".

In the health system reforms of the 1980s, the Department of Health lost responsibility for both the provision and funding of healthcare &amp;mdash; these roles were transferred to separate Crown Health Enterprises (the precursors to today's [[District Health Board (New Zealand)|District Health Board]]s) and the [[Health Funding Authority]], respectively. The only function remaining was policy-making (resulting in the Department being renamed a Ministry). For a time, there was a separate Minister in Charge of Crown Health Enterprises, who was not necessarily the same as the Minister of Health. Further reforms have changed this, however &amp;mdash; the Health Funding Authority has been re-absorbed into the Ministry of Health, and the modern District Health Boards, while not part of the Ministry, are considered a responsibility of the Minister of Health.

'''Occlusion''', in a dental context, means simply the contact between teeth. More technically, it is the relationship between the [[maxilla]]ry (upper) and [[human mandible|mandibular]] (lower) teeth when they approach each other, as occurs during chewing or at rest.

'''[[Malocclusion]]''' is the misalignment of teeth and jaws, or more simply, a "bad bite". Malocclusion can cause a number of health and dental problems. Malocclusion occurs as a result of disturbances in normal occlusal development.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dental anatomy, physiology, and occlusion|last=1921-2007.|first=Ash, Major M.,|date=2003|publisher=W.B. Saunders|others=Nelson, Stanley J., Ash, Major M., 1921-2007.|isbn=978-0721693828|edition= 8th|location=Philadelphia|oclc=50684436}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Static occlusion''' refers to contact between teeth when the jaw is closed and stationary, while '''dynamic occlusion''' refers to occlusal contacts made when the jaw is moving. Dynamic occlusion is also termed as articulation. During chewing, there is no tooth contact between the teeth on the chewing side of the mouth.

'''Centric occlusion''' is a relationship between upper and lower teeth when they come together, teeth do not need to be in centric relation in order to be in centric occlusion, i.e. the condyle may be anywhere within the glenoid fossa when the teeth are in centric occlusion. Centric occlusion is the first tooth contact and may or may not coincide with [[maximum intercuspation]]. It is also referred to as a person's habitual bite, bite of convenience, or intercuspation position (ICP).  ''Centric relation'', not to be confused with ''centric occlusion'', is a relationship between the [[maxilla]] and [[mandible]].

==Concepts of occlusion==

Occlusion is defined as the act of opening and closing, while in [[dentistry]] its definition is broader and includes the contact of the teeth in the functional and parafunctional movements.{{sfn|Nelson|2015|p=267}} In addition, it includes the development and function of the masticatory system.{{sfn|Nelson|2015|p=267}} Over the course of history there have been several occlusion concepts, which tend to vary based on the specialty of dentistry.{{sfn|Nelson|2015|p=267}} Initially the concepts were based on complete dentures.{{sfn|Nelson|2015|p=267}}

Centric occlusion (CO) is the occlusion, or position, of opposing teeth when the mandible is in centric relation.{{sfn|Aschheim|2015|p=440-1}} Centric relation (CR) is the relationship between the maxilla and the mandible with regards to the position of the mandibular condyle articulating with the thinnest avascular portion of the respective disks in the anterior-superior position.{{sfn|Aschheim|2015|p=440-1}} This position does not require the teeth to be in contact, but it is possible.{{sfn|Aschheim|2015|p=440-1}} Maximal intercuspation (maximal intercuspal position or MIP) is the full intercuspation of the opposing teeth in the dental arches regardless of condylar position.{{sfn|Aschheim|2015|p=440-1}}

The concept of ideal occlusion varies based on a case by case basis, the goal of the dentist is to choose a model that reduces vertical and horizontal stresses, provides MIP during CR.{{sfn|Garg|2010|p=163-72}}

===Balanced occlusion===
Balanced Occlusion is defined as the bilateral, simultaneous, anterior, and posterior occlusal contact of teeth in centric and eccentric positions. Balanced occlusion in complete dentures is unique, as it does not occur with natural teeth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rangarajan|first=V.|last2=Gajapathi|first2=B.|last3=Yogesh|first3=P. B.|last4=Ibrahim|first4=M. Mohamed|last5=Kumar|first5=R. Ganesh|last6=Karthik|first6=Prasanna|date=July 2015|title=Concepts of occlusion in prosthodontics: A literature review, part I|journal=Journal of Indian Prosthodontic Society|volume=15|issue=3|pages=200–205|doi=10.4103/0972-4052.165172|issn=0972-4052|pmc=4762337|pmid=26929513}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This concept of occlusion is based on the efforts of [[Curve of Spee]] and Monson's spherical theory and is known also as "fully balanced occlusion" or "bilateral balanced occlusion."{{sfn|Garg|2010|p=163-72}} This occlusion concept requires that all the teeth be in contact during both maximum intercuspation and eccentric mandibular movements.{{sfn|Garg|2010|p=163-72}} During masticatory movements, there are no vertical forces, just horizontal ones.{{sfn|Garg|2010|p=163-72}} The lateral forces that are produced get directed upon the [[periodontal ligament]]s and are distributed through the contact area created through the occlusion scheme.{{sfn|Garg|2010|p=163-72}}

The concept is ideal for those receiving dentures, but is difficult to obtain on those with normal dentition.{{sfn|Garg|2010|p=163-72}} If this occlusal scheme is found in a patient it typically indicates that there is advanced wear on the dentition.{{sfn|Garg|2010|p=163-72}} An “ideal” dentition is based on the end goals of restorations involved with orthodontics, dentures and for some, full mouth rehabilitation. The occlusion is therefore not static. It is a continuous functional relationship between the maxillary (upper) and mandibular (lower) teeth. Any disturbances to the masticatory (chewing) system can be due to malocclusion, occlusal dysfunction and conditions such as bruxism (teeth grinding). Patients with bruxism may be treated with preventative therapy including stabilisation with an occlusal bite plane splint.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; At present, there is not enough evidence to suggest that non-surgical therapy is effective in patients experiencing teeth during [[Bruxism|sleep bruxism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Macedo|first=Cristiane R|date=2014-10-23|doi=10.1002/14651858.cd005578.pub2|pmid=25338726|last2=Macedo|first2=Elizeu C|last3=Torloni|first3=Maria R|last4=Silva|first4=Ademir B|last5=Prado|first5=Gilmar F|issue=10|pages=CD005578|title=Pharmacotherapy for sleep bruxism|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unilateral balanced occlusion is a type of occlusion seen on occlusal surfaces of teeth on one side when they occlude simultaneously with a smooth, uninterrupted glide. This is not followed during complete denture preparation. It is more pertained to fixed partial dentures.

Bilateral balanced occlusion is a type of occlusion that is seen when a simultaneous contract occurs on both sides in centric and eccentric positions. Bilateral balanced occlusion helps to distribute the occlusal load evenly across the arch and therefore helps to improve the stability of the denture &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lemos|first=C. a. A.|last2=Verri|first2=F. R.|last3=Gomes|first3=J. M. L.|last4=Santiago Júnior|first4=J. F.|last5=Moraes|first5=S. L. D.|last6=Pellizzer|first6=E. P.|date=April 2018|title=Bilateral balanced occlusion compared to other occlusal schemes in complete dentures: A systematic review|journal=Journal of Oral Rehabilitation|volume=45|issue=4|pages=344–354|doi=10.1111/joor.12607|issn=1365-2842|pmid=29314199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mutually protected occlusion===

The occlusal scheme was established in 1974 by Dawson that used data study in 1960 revealed a set of patients whose molars did not contact in eccentric movements, while the anterior teeth did not contact in maximum intercuspation.{{sfn|Garg|2010|p=163-72}} In order to classify as mutually protected occlusion the following criteria must be met:{{sfn|Garg|2010|p=163-72}}
{|
|-
|  style="vertical-align:top; width:25%;"|
*There must be stable stops on all when in centric relation
*Anterior guidance
*Posteior teeth do not conctact in protrusive movements or the balancing side
*No working interferences on the posterior teeth with lateroanterior guidance or border movements of the condyles
|}

In protrusive movements, the canine and the posterior teeth are protected by the incisors, while in a lateral movement the incisors and posteriors are protected by the canines.{{sfn|Garg|2010|p=163-72}} The posterior teeth protect the anteriors in a centric position , which reduces the load onto the temporomandibular joint.{{sfn|Garg|2010|p=163-72}}

Mutually protected occlusion is thought to be the best scheme for natural dentition as the cusp-to-fossa relationship provides maximum support for centric relation.{{sfn|Garg|2010|p=163-72}} Another reason is that the forces are directed almost completely along the long axis of the tooth.{{sfn|Garg|2010|p=163-72}} The scheme is not recommended in patients with compromised periodontium or or if the patient has a horizontal masitcatory cycle.{{sfn|Garg|2010|p=163-72}}

== Occlusal Development ==
As the teeth start to erupt at six months, the maxillary (upper) and mandibular (lower) primary (baby) teeth aim to occlude with two teeth of the opposing jaw. The two exceptions to this are the upper left and right central incisor and the lower left and right second molar. Normal alignment and occlusion of the two arches should be achieved after 2 years of age, with the full formation of the roots by the time the child has reached 3 years. The jaws develop in such a way that after one year, a diastema (interdental space) has formed between some teeth. This is more prominent in the anterior teeth as the jaws and permanent teeth grow.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Assessing Occlusion&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Advanced Operative Dentistry: A Practical Approach|last=|first=|publisher=David Ricketts, David Bartlett.|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=69–86}}&lt;/ref&gt; ==
Extra-oral Assessment
* Check for facial asymmetry and skeletal discrepancies
* Measure Lower Face Height
Loss of teeth and occlusal stops can result in over-closure causing a reduced face height. Over-closure is unlikely for patients with tooth wear due to dento-alveolar compensation. Over-eruption may occur for patients due to dento-alveolar development in absence of tooth wear which may result in increased face height.
* Temporomandibular Joints
The maximum extent the patient can open is measured between the incisal edges of the upper and lower incisors. Deviation of mandible on opening or closing should be described. Clicking, crepitus and tenderness of the jaw should be noted as well.

Intra-Oral Assessment
* Intercuspal Position (ICP) / Centric Position
ICP is defined as position of the jaws when there is maximum intercuspation of the maxillary and mandibular teeth. Stability of occlusion in ICP is essential or further dental work will be complicated.
* Retruded Contact Position (RCP) / Terminal Hinge Axis Position
RCP refers to the most comfortable posterior location of the mandible when it is bilaterally manipulated backwards and upwards into a retrusive position. Terminal hinge axis refers to an imaginary axis drawn through the center of the head of both condyles when the mandible opens and closes on an arc of curvature. When the mandible closes in the Terminal Hinge Axis, the first tooth contact refers to RCP. 
* Excursive Movements of the Mandible
Protrusion

Condyles move from the glenoid fossa in a forward and downward movement onto the articular eminence when the mandible moves into protrusion. Condylar inclination refers to the angle protrusion makes when the horizontal when the patient is sitting upright

In protrusion, contact between the teeth is governed by incisor relationship and guidance. For instance, the mandibular movement of patients with Class I incisors relationships would be inferiorly resulting in separation of the posterior teeth. This is to overcome the natural overbite of the Class I relationship for the mandible to make a protrusive movement.

Lateral Excursion

The side to which the mandible moves is called the working side and the opposite side is the non-working side. Bennett Movement refers to the lateral movement of the working side condyle when the mandible moves laterally. Bennett’s Angle is measured at the non-working condyle when it moves forward and medially during lateral excursion

Lateral excursion of the mandible is usually governed by Canine guidance or Group Function at the working side. In some cases, teeth at the non-working side can also be in contact when the condylar inclination is shallow or if the tooth guidance on the working side is shallow.

== Occlusal problems ==

[[Malocclusion]] is the result of the body trying to optimize its function in a dysfunctional environment. For example, the maxilla (upper jaw) can be placed too far anteriorly compared to the mandible (lower jaw). This would be called a Class II Malocclusion. If the mandible is placed too far posterior compared to the maxilla, it would be a Class III malocclusion. Malocclusion can can also be associated with a number of problems:
* Misaligned ('crooked') teeth
* Gum problems
* The [[temporomandibular joint]] (TMJ and jaw muscles. 
Malocclusion can cause teeth, fillings, and crowns to wear, break, or loosen, and teeth may be tender or ache. 
Receding gums can be exacerbated by a faulty bite.
If the jaw is mispositioned, jaw muscles may have to work harder, which can lead to fatigue and or muscle spasms. This in turn can lead to headaches or migraines, eye or sinus pain, and pain in the neck, shoulder, or even back. 
Malocclusion can be a contributing factor to sleep disordered breathing which may include snoring, upper airway resistance syndrome, and / or sleep apnea (apnea means without breath). Untreated damaging malocclusion can lead to [[occlusal trauma]].

&lt;big&gt;&lt;u&gt;Treatment for occlusal problems&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
Some of the treatments for different occlusal problems include protecting the teeth with dental splints (orthotics), tooth adjustments, replacement of teeth, medication (usually temporary), a diet of softer foods, TENS to relax tensed muscles, and relaxation therapy for stress-related clenching. Removable dental appliances may be used to alter the development of the jaws. Fixed appliances such as braces may be used to move the teeth in the jaws. Jaw surgery is also used to correct malocclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| url=https://chandlerdental.com.au/sleep-dentistry/sedation-dentistry-in-detail/| title=The History of Sleep Dentistry | journal= Sleep Dentistry | date=2016-12-06 }} Sunday, 15 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Portable water purification''' devices are self-contained, easily transported units used to [[water purification|purify water]] from [[unimproved water source|untreated sources]] (such as rivers, lakes, and [[groundwater|wells]]) for [[drinking water|drinking]] purposes.  Their main function is to eliminate [[pathogen]]s, and often also of suspended solids and some unpalatable or [[toxic compound]]s.

These units provide an [[self-supply of water and sanitation|autonomous supply of drinking water]] to people without access to clean [[water supply]] services, including inhabitants of [[developing countries]] and disaster areas, military personnel, [[camping|campers]], [[hiking|hikers]], and workers in [[wilderness]], and [[survivalism|survivalists]].  They are also called '''point-of-use''' ('''POU''') '''water treatment systems''' and '''field water disinfection''' techniques.

Techniques include heat (including boiling), filtration, activated charcoal adsorption, chemical disinfection (e.g. [[Water chlorination|chlorination]], iodine, [[ozone|ozonation]], etc.), ultraviolet purification (including [[Solar water disinfection|SODIS]]), distillation (including solar distillation), and [[flocculation]]. Often these are used in combination.

==Drinking water hazards==
Untreated water may contain potentially pathogenic agents, including  [[protozoa]], bacteria, viruses, and some larvae of higher-order parasites such as liver flukes and roundworms. Chemical pollutants such as [[pesticide]]s, heavy metals and synthetic organics may be present. Other components may affect taste, odour and general aesthetic qualities, including [[turbidity]] from soil or clay, colour from [[humic acid]] or microscopic algae, odours from certain type of bacteria, particularly [[Actinomycetes]] which produce [[geosmin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Problem Organisms in Water: Identification and Treatment, 3rd Ed. (M7)|publisher=Amewrican Waterworks Associan|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and saltiness from brackish or sea water.

Common metallic contaminants such as [[copper]] and [[lead]] can be treated by increasing the pH using soda ash or lime, which precipitates such metals. Careful decanting of the clear water after settlement  or the use of filtration provides acceptably low levels of metals. Water contaminated by [[aluminium]] or [[zinc]] cannot be treated in this way using a strong alkali as higher pHs re-dissolve the metal salts. Salt is difficult to remove  except by reverse osmosis or [[distillation]].

Most portable treatment processes focus on mitigating human pathogens for safety and removing particulates matter, tastes and odours. Significant pathogens commonly present in the developed world include ''[[Giardia]]'', ''[[Cryptosporidium]]'', ''[[Shigella]]'', [[hepatitis A virus]], ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', and [[enterovirus]].&lt;ref&gt;Geldreich E. Drinking water microbiology—new directions toward water quality enhancement. Int J Food Microbiol 1989;9:295-312.&lt;/ref&gt; In less developed countries there may be risks from [[cholera]] and [[dysentery]] organisms and a range of tropical enteroparasites.

''[[Giardia lamblia]]'' and ''[[Cryptosporidium]] spp.'', both of which cause [[diarrhea]] (see [[giardiasis]] and [[cryptosporidiosis]]) are common pathogens. In backcountry areas of the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] they are sometimes present in sufficient quantity that water treatment is justified for backpackers,&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |vauthors=Boulware DR, Forgey WW, Martin WJ | title = Medical risks of wilderness hiking | journal = The American Journal of Medicine | year = 2003 | volume = 114 | issue = 4 | pages = 288–93 | pmid = 12681456 | doi = 10.1016/S0002-9343(02)01494-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although this has created some controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | author = Welch TP | title = Risk of giardiasis from consumption of wilderness water in North America: a systematic review of epidemiologic data | journal = International Journal of Infectious Diseases | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = 100–3 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10737847 | doi = 10.1016/S1201-9712(00)90102-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[wilderness acquired diarrhea]].)  In [[Hawaii]] and other tropical areas, ''[[Leptospira]] spp.'' are another possible problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | publisher = Hawaii State Department of Health | title = What is Leptospirosis? | url = http://hawaii.gov/health/about/reports/leptobrochure.pdf | date = September 2006 | accessdate = 26 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Less commonly seen in [[developed countries]] are organisms such as ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'' which causes [[cholera]] and various strains of ''[[Salmonella]]'' which cause [[typhoid]] and para-typhoid diseases. Pathogenic [[virus]]es may also be found in water.  The larvae of [[Fasciola hepatica|flukes]] are particularly dangerous in area frequented by [[sheep]], [[deer]], or [[cattle]]. If such [[Microscope|microscopic]] larvae are ingested, they can form potentially life-threatening [[cyst]]s in the [[brain]] or [[liver]]. This risk extends to plants grown in or near water including the commonly eaten [[watercress]].

In general, more human activity up stream (i.e. the larger the stream/river) the greater the potential for contamination from [[Sewage treatment|sewage effluent]], [[surface runoff]], or industrial [[water pollution|pollutants]].  [[Groundwater pollution]] may occur from human activity (e.g. on-site [[sanitation]] systems or mining) or might be naturally occurring (e.g. from [[Arsenic contamination of groundwater|arsenic]] in some regions of India and Bangladesh).  Water collected as far upstream as possible above  all known or anticipated risks of pollution poses the lowest risk of contamination and is best suited to portable treatment methods.

==Techniques==
[[File:US Navy 060220-M-2061L-063 U.S. Marines assigned to the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) Service Support Group 31, prepares a chlorine solution for water.jpg|thumb|300px|31st Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) Service Support Group 31]]

Not all techniques by themselves will mitigate all hazards.  Although flocculation followed by filtration has been suggested as best practice&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/34/3/355/388050|title=Water Disinfection for International and Wilderness Travelers|first1=Charles D.|last1=Ericsson|first2=Robert|last2=Steffen|first3=Howard|last3=Backer|date=1 February 2002|publisher=|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|volume=34|issue=3|pages=355–364|accessdate=3 June 2018|via=cid.oxfordjournals.org|doi=10.1086/324747}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is rarely practicable without the ability to carefully control pH and settling conditions. Ill-advised used of alum as a flocculant can lead to unacceptable levels of aluminium in the water so treated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Clayton D.B:date=1989|title= Water pollution at Lowermoore North Cornwall|publisher=Lowermoore incident health advisory committee, Cornwall District Health Authority|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If water is to be stored, halogens offer extended protection.

===Heat (boiling)===
Heat kills disease-causing micro-organisms, with higher temperatures and/or duration required for some pathogens.  [[Sterilization (microbiology)|Sterilization]] of water (killing all living contaminants) is not necessary to make water safe to drink; one only needs to render enteric (intestinal) pathogens harmless.  Boiling does not remove most pollutants and does not leave any residual protection.

The [[World Health Organization|WHO]] states bringing water to rolling boil then naturally cooling is sufficient to inactivate pathogenic bacteria, viruses and protozoa.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/Boiling_water_01_15.pdf?ua=1&amp;ua=1&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] recommends a rolling boil for 1 minute.  At high elevations, though, the boiling point of water drops.  At altitudes greater than 6,562 feet (2000 meters) boiling should continue for 3 minutes.&lt;ref name="cdc"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/drinking/travel/backcountry_water_treatment.html|title=A Guide to Drinking Water Treatment and Sanitation for Backcountry &amp; Travel Use|access-date=19 March 2018|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|date=10 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All bacterial pathogens are quickly killed above 60&amp;nbsp;°C (140&amp;nbsp;°F), therefore, although boiling is not necessary to make the water safe to drink, the time taken to heat the water to boiling is usually sufficient to reduce bacterial concentrations to safe levels.&lt;ref&gt;Backer, H. Water Disinfection for International and Wilderness Traveler. Clinical Infectious Diseases. (2002) 34 (3): 355-364. Available from: http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/34/3/355.full&lt;/ref&gt; Encysted [[protozoa]]n pathogens may require higher temperatures to remove any risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodsafetywatch.org/factsheets/cryptosporidium/|title=Cryptosporidium |author =Lawley R|date = 1 January 2013|publisher = Food Safety Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boiling is not always necessary nor sometimes enough.  [[Pasteurization]] where ''enough'' pathogens are killed typically occurs at 63&amp;nbsp;°C for 30 minutes or 72&amp;nbsp;°C for 15 seconds.  Certain pathogens must be heated above boiling (e.g. botulism{{spaced ndash}}''Clostridium botulinum'' requires {{Convert|118|C}}, most [[endospores]] require {{Convert|120|C}},&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bellarmine.edu/faculty/dobbins/Secret%20Readings/Lecture%20Notes%20202/Chapter%2011WO.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and prions even higher).  Higher temperatures may be achieved with a [[Pressure cooking|pressure cooker]].  Heat combined with ultraviolet light (UV), such as [[SODIS]] method, reduces the necessary temperature + duration.

===Filtration===
Portable pump filters are commercially available with ceramic filters that filter 5,000 to 50,000 litres per cartridge, removing pathogens down to the 0.2&amp;ndash;0.3 [[Micrometre|micrometer]] (µm) range. Some also utilize activated charcoal filtering. Most filters of this kind remove most bacteria and protozoa, such as ''Cryptosporidium'' and ''Giardia lamblia,'' but not viruses except for the very largest of 0.3&amp;nbsp;µm and larger diameters, so [[Disinfectant|disinfection]] by chemicals or [[Ultraviolet|ultraviolet light]] is still required after filtration. It is worth noting that not all bacteria are removed by 0.2&amp;nbsp;µm pump filters; for example, strands of thread-like ''Leptospira spp.'' (which can cause leptospirosis) are thin enough to pass through a 0.2&amp;nbsp;µm filter. Effective chemical additives to address shortcomings in pump filters include chlorine, chlorine dioxide, iodine, and sodium hypochlorite (bleach). There have been polymer and ceramic filters on the market that incorporated iodine post-treatment in their filter elements to kill viruses and the smaller bacteria that cannot be filtered out, but most have disappeared due to the unpleasant taste imparted to the water, as well as possible adverse health effects when iodine is ingested over protracted periods.

While the filtration elements may do an excellent job of removing most bacteria and fungi contaminants from drinking water when new, the elements themselves can become colonization sites.  In recent years some filters have been enhanced by bonding silver metal nanoparticles to the ceramic element and/or to the activated charcoal to suppress growth of pathogens.

Small, hand-pumped [[reverse osmosis]] filters were originally developed for the military in the late 1980s for use as survival equipment, for example, to be included with inflatable rafts on aircraft.  Civilian versions are available.  Instead of using the static pressure of a water supply line to force the water through the filter, pressure is provided by a hand-operated pump, similar in function and appearance to a mechanic's [[Grease gun (tool)|grease gun]].  These devices can generate drinkable water from seawater.

The [[Portable Aqua Unit for Lifesaving]] (short PAUL) is a portable [[ultrafiltration]]-based membrane water filter for humanitarian aid. It allows the decentralized supply of clean water in emergency and disaster situations for about 400 persons per unit per day. The filter is designed to function with neither chemicals nor energy nor trained personnel.

===Activated charcoal adsorption===
[[File:Water purification unit.JPG|thumb|Portable water purification unit used by International Red Cross and Red Crescent.]]
Granular activated carbon filtering utilizes a form of activated carbon with a high surface area, and [[Adsorption|adsorbs]] many compounds, including many [[Toxicity|toxic]] compounds.  Water passing through activated carbon is commonly used in concert with hand pumped filters to address [[Organic compound|organic contamination]], taste, or objectionable odors.  Activated carbon filters aren't usually used as the primary purification techniques of portable water purification devices, but rather as secondary means to complement another purification technique.  It is most commonly implemented for pre- or post-filtering, in a separate step than ceramic filtering, in either case being implemented prior to the addition of chemical disinfectants used to control bacteria or viruses that filters cannot remove.  Activated charcoal can remove chlorine from treated water, removing any residual protection remaining in the water protecting against pathogens, and should not, in general, be used without careful thought after chemical disinfection treatments in portable water purification processing. Ceramic/Carbon Core filters with a 0.5&amp;nbsp;µm or smaller pore size are excellent for removing bacteria and cysts while also removing chemicals.

===Chemical disinfection with halogens===
Chemical disinfection with [[halogens]], chiefly [[chlorine]] and [[iodine]], results from [[oxidation]] of essential cellular structures and [[enzymes]]. The primary factors that determine the rate and proportion of [[microorganisms]] killed are the residual or available halogen concentration and the exposure time.&lt;ref&gt;Hoff J. Inactivation of microbial agents by chemical disinfectants. Cincinnati: US Environmental Protection Agency; 1986. EPA/600/2-86/067.&lt;/ref&gt;  Secondary factors are pathogen species, water temperature, pH, and organic contaminants. In field-water disinfection, use of concentrations of 1–16&amp;nbsp;mg/L for 10–60 min is generally effective.   Of note, Cryptosporidium oocysts, likely Cyclospora species, Ascaris eggs are extremely resistant to halogens and field inactivation may not be practical with bleach and iodine.

====Iodine====
[[Iodine]] used for water purification is commonly added to water as a solution, in crystallized form, or in tablets containing tetraglycine hydroperiodide that release 8&amp;nbsp;mg of iodine per tablet adaptation to chronic tetraglycine hydroperiodide. The iodine kills many, but not all, of the most common pathogens present in natural fresh water sources. Carrying iodine for water purification is an imperfect but lightweight solution for those in need of field purification of drinking water. Kits are available in camping stores that include an iodine pill and a second pill (vitamin C or [[ascorbic acid]]) that will remove the iodine taste from the water after it has been [[Disinfectant|disinfected]]. The addition of vitamin C, in the form of a pill or in flavored drink powders, precipitates much of the iodine out of the solution, so it should not be added until the iodine has had sufficient time to work. This time is 30 minutes in relatively clear, warm water, but is considerably longer if the water is [[turbid]] or cold. Iodine treated drinking water, treated with tablets containing tetraglycine hydroperiodide, also reduces the uptake of radioactive iodine in human subjects to only 2% of the value it would otherwise be.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |vauthors=LeMar HJ, Georgitis WJ, McDermott MT | title = Thyroid adaptation to chronic tetraglycine hydroperiodide water purification tablet use | journal = Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism | year = 1995 | volume = 80 | issue = 1 | pages = 220–3 | doi = 10.1210/jcem.80.1.7829615 | pmid = 7829615 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This could be an important factor worthy of consideration for treating water in a recent post nuclear event survival situation, where radioactive iodine ingestion is a concern for internal radiotoxicity. If the iodine has precipitated out of the solution, then the drinking water has less available iodine in the solution.  Also the amount of iodine in one tablet is not sufficient to block uptake. Tetraglycine hydroperiodide maintains its effectiveness indefinitely before the container is opened; although some manufacturers suggest not using the tablets more than three months after the container has initially been opened, the shelf life is in fact very long provided that the container is resealed immediately after each time it is opened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.equipped.com/parepack.htm|title=EQUIPPED TO SURVIVE (tm) - Repackaging Potable Aqua|website=www.equipped.com|accessdate=3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iodine should be allowed at least 30 minutes to kill Giardia.

====Iodine crystals====
A potentially lower cost alternative to using iodine-based water purification tablets is the use of iodine crystals although there are serious risks of acute iodine toxicity if preparation and dilution and not measured with some accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |vauthors=Kahn FH, Visscher BR | title = Water Disinfection in the Wilderness -- a simple, effective method of iodination | journal = Western Journal of Medicine | year = 1975 | volume = 122 | issue = 5 | pages = 450–3 | pmid = 165639 | pmc = 1129772 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |vauthors=Zemlyn S, Wilson WW, Hellweg PA | title = A caution on iodine water purification | journal = Western Journal of Medicine | year = 1981 | volume = 135 | issue = 2 | pages = 166–7 | pmid = 7281653 | pmc = 1273058 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This method may not be adequate in killing Giardia cysts in cold water.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |author1=Jarroll EL Jr. |author2=Bingham AK |author3=Meyer EA | title = Inability of an iodination method to destroy completely Giardia cysts in cold water | journal = Western Journal of Medicine | year = 1980 | volume = 132 | issue = 6 | pages = 567–9 | pmid = 7405206 | pmc = 1272173 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  An advantage of using iodine crystals is that only a small amount of iodine is dissolved from the iodine crystals at each use, giving this method of treating water a capability for treating very large volumes of water. Unlike tetraglycine hydroperiodide tablets, iodine crystals have  an unlimited shelf life as long as they are not exposed to air for long periods of time or are kept under water. Iodine crystals will [[Sublimation (chemistry)|sublimate]] if exposed to air for long periods of time.  The large quantity of water that can be purified with iodine crystals at low cost makes this technique especially cost effective for point of use or emergency water purification methods intended for use longer than the shelf life of tetraglycine hydroperiodide.

====Halazone tablets====
Chlorine-based [[halazone]] tablets were formerly popularly used for portable water purification.  Chlorine in water is more than three times more effective as a disinfectant against ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' than iodine.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |vauthors=Koski TA, Stuart LS, Ortenzio LF | title = Comparison of Chlorine, Bromine, and Iodine as Disinfectants for Swimming Pool Water | journal = Applied Microbiology | year = 1966 | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | pages = 276–9 | pmid = 4959984 | pmc = 546668 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Halazone tablets were thus commonly used during [[World War II]] by U.S. soldiers for portable water purification, even being included in accessory packs for [[C-ration]]s until 1945.

[[Sodium dichloroisocyanurate]] (NaDCC) has largely displaced halazone tablets for the few remaining chlorine-based water purification tablets available today.&lt;!--Is the following about Halazone or NaDCC?--&gt;It is compressed with effervescent salts, usually [[adipic acid]] and [[sodium bicarbonate]], to form rapidly dissolving tablets, diluted to 10 parts per million available chlorine (ppm av.cl) when drinking water is mildly contaminated and 20ppm when visibly contaminated.

Chlorine bleach tablets give a more stable platform for disinfecting the water than liquid [[bleach]] ([[sodium hypochlorite]]) as the liquid version tends to degrade with age and give unregulated results unless assays are carried out{{spaced ndash}}not practical on the spot. Still, despite chlorine-based halazone tablets falling from favor for portable water purification, chlorine-based bleach may nonetheless safely be used for short-term emergency water disinfection.  Two drops of unscented 5% bleach can be added per liter or quart of clear water, then allowed to stand covered for 30 to 60 minutes. After this treatment, the water may be left open to reduce the chlorine smell and taste. Guidelines are available online for effective emergency use of bleach to render unsafe water [[potable]].{{Ref|1 EPA}}{{Ref|2 BC Health}}

The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control &amp; Prevention]] (CDC) and [[Population Services International]] (PSI) promote a similar product (a 0.5% - 1.5% sodium hypochlorite solution) as part of their Safe Water System (SWS) strategy.  The product is sold in [[developing countries]] under local brand names specifically for the purpose of disinfecting drinking water.&lt;ref name="cdc"/&gt;

====Bleach====
Common [[bleach]] including [[calcium hypochlorite]] (Ca[OCl]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[sodium hypochlorite]] (NaOCl) are common, well-researched, low-cost oxidizers.

The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] recommends two drops of 8.25% sodium hypochlorite solution (regular, unscented chlorine bleach) mixed per one quart/liter of water and let stand 30 minutes. Two drops of 5% solution also suffices.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Double the amount of bleach if the water is cloudy, colored, or very cold. Afterwards, the water should have a slight chlorine odor. If not repeat the dosage and let stand for another 15 minutes before use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://water.epa.gov/drink/emerprep/emergencydisinfection.cfm#method|title=Ground Water and Drinking Water - US EPA|first=US|last=EPA,OW|website=US EPA|accessdate=3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither chlorine (e.g., bleach) nor iodine alone is considered completely effective against ''[[Cryptosporidium]]'', although they are partially effective against ''[[Giardia]]''. Chlorine is considered slightly better against the latter. A more complete field solution that includes chemical disinfectants is to first filter the water, using a 0.2&amp;nbsp;µm ceramic cartridge pumped filter, followed by treatment with iodine or chlorine, thereby filtering out cryptosporidium, Giardia, and most bacteria, along with the larger viruses, while also using chemical disinfectant to address smaller viruses and bacteria that the filter cannot remove. This combination is also potentially more effective in some cases than even using portable electronic disinfection based on [[UV]] treatment.

====Chlorine dioxide====
Chlorine dioxide can come from tablets or be created by mixing two chemicals together. It is more effective than iodine or chlorine against giardia, and although it has only low to moderate effectiveness against cryptosporidium, iodine and chlorine are ineffective against this protozoan.&lt;ref name="cdc"/&gt; The cost of chlorine dioxide treatment is higher than the cost of iodine treatment. {{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

====Mixed oxidant (MiOx)====
A simple brine {salt + water} solution in an electrolytic reaction produces a powerful mixed oxidant disinfectant (mostly chlorine in the form of hypochlorous acid (HOCl) and some peroxide, ozone, chlorine dioxide)&lt;ref&gt;http://phc.amedd.army.mil/PHC%20Resource%20Library/Electrochemically%20Generated%20Oxidant%20Disinfection%20in%20the%20Use%20of%20Individual%20Water%20Purification%20Devices.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; to inactivate viruses, bacteria, Giardia and Cryptosporidium killing 99.9% of all organisms without the need to filter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.potableaqua.com/products/pa-pure-electrolytic-water-purifier/|title=PA PURE Electrolytic Water Purifier: Potable Aqua|publisher=|accessdate=3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  MiOx is considered stronger than chlorine.

==== Chlorine tablets (NaDCC) ====
[[Sodium dichloroisocyanurate]] or Troclosene Sodium more commonly shortened as NaDCC, is a form of chlorine used for disinfection. It is used by all major NGO's such as UNICEF&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.unicef.org/wash/files/JMP2013final_en.pdf|title = UNICEF - Progress on Drinking Water and Sanitation|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; to treat water in emergencies, and widely by social marketing organisations for household water treatment where household sources of water may not be safe.

NaDCC tablets are available in a range of concentrations to treat differing volumes of water&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.oasiswaterpurification.com/brand/oasis-water-purification-tablets/|title = Water Purification Tablets|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; to give the World Health Organization's recommended 5ppm&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/2011/dwq_guidelines/en/|title = WHO - Guidelines for drinking-water quality, fourth edition|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; available chlorine. They are effervescent tablets allowing the tablet to dissolve in a matter of minutes.

===Other chemical disinfection additives===

====Silver ion tablets====
An alternative to iodine-based preparations in some usage scenarios are [[silver]] ion/[[chlorine dioxide]]-based tablets or droplets. These solutions may disinfect water more effectively than iodine-based techniques while leaving hardly any noticeable taste in the water in some usage scenarios.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} Silver ion/chlorine dioxide-based disinfecting agents will kill ''Cryptosporidium'' and ''Giardia'', if utilized correctly. The primary disadvantage of silver ion/chlorine dioxide-based techniques is the long purification times (generally 30 minutes to 4 hours, depending on the formulation used).  Another concern is the possible deposition and accumulation of silver compounds in various body tissues leading to a rare condition called [[argyria]] that results in a permanent, disfiguring, bluish-gray pigmentation of the skin, eyes, and mucous membranes.

====Hydrogen peroxide====
One recent study has found that the wild Salmonella which would reproduce quickly during subsequent dark storage of solar-disinfected water could be controlled by the addition of just 10 parts per million of hydrogen peroxide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Dramatic enhancement of solar disinfection (SODIS) of wild Salmonella sp. in PET bottles by H(2)O(2) addition on natural water of Burkina Faso containing dissolved iron |vauthors=Sciacca F, Rengifo-Herrera JA, Wéthé J, Pulgarin C |journal=Chemosphere |date=2010-01-08 |format=epub ahead of print |pmid=20060566 |volume=78 |issue=9 |pages=1186–91 |doi=10.1016/j.chemosphere.2009.12.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ultraviolet purification===
{{Main|Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation}}
[[Ultraviolet]] (UV) light induces the formation of covalent linkages on [[DNA]] and thereby prevents microbes from reproducing. Without reproduction, the microbes become far less dangerous. Germicidal UV-C light in the short wavelength range of 100&amp;ndash;280&amp;nbsp;nm acts on [[thymine]], one of the four base [[nucleotide]]s in DNA. When a germicidal UV [[photon]] is absorbed by a thymine molecule that is adjacent to another thymine within the DNA strand, a [[covalent bond]] or [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimer]] between the molecules is created. This thymine dimer prevents [[enzyme]]s from "reading" the DNA and copying it, thus neutering the microbe. Prolonged exposure to ionizing radiation can cause single and double-stranded breaks in DNA, oxidation of membrane lipids, and denaturation of proteins, all of which are toxic to cells. Still, there are limits to this technology.  Water turbidity (i.e., the amount of suspended &amp; colloidal solids contained in the water to be treated) must be low, such that the water is clear, for UV purification to work well - thus a pre-filter step might be necessary.

A concern with UV portable water purification is that some pathogens are hundreds of times less sensitive to UV light than others.  Protozoan cysts were once believed to be among the least sensitive, however recent studies have proved otherwise, demonstrating that both Cryptosporidium and Giardia are deactivated by a UV dose of just 6 mJ/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;ref&gt;USEPA, Ultraviolet Disinfection Guidance Manual for the final LT2ESWTR, Nov 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  However, EPA regulations and other studies show that it is viruses that are the limiting factor of UV treatment, requiring a 10-30 times greater dose of UV light than ''Giardia'' or ''Cryptosporidium''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ Cite journal | title = National Primary Drinking Water Regulations: Long Term 2 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule | journal = Federal Register | volume = 71 | issue = 3 | pages = 783 | publisher = U.S. Environmental Protection Agency | date = 5 Jan 2006 | url = http://www.epa.gov/fedrgstr/EPA-WATER/2006/January/Day-05/w04c.htm | accessdate = 17 Apr 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ Cite journal |vauthors=Mofidi AA, Meyer EA, Wallis PM, Chou CL, Meyer BP, Ramalinham S, Coffey BM | title = The effect of UV light on the inactivation of ''Giardia lamblia'' and ''Giardia muris'' cysts as determined by animal infectivity assay (P-2951-01) | journal = Water Research | year = 2002 | volume = 36 | issue = 8 | pages = 2098–108 | doi = 10.1016/S0043-1354(01)00412-2 | pmid = 12092585 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Water treated with UV still has the microbes present in the water, only with their means for reproduction turned "off".  In the event that such UV-treated water containing neutered microbes is exposed to visible light (specifically, wavelengths of light over 330-500&amp;nbsp;nm)  for any significant period of time, a process known as [[photolyase|photo reactivation]] can take place, where the possibility for repairing the damage in the bacteria's reproduction DNA arises, potentially rendering them once more capable of reproducing and causing disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Qiu X, Sundin GW, Chai B, Tiedje JM |title=Survival of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 after UV Radiation Exposure |journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology |volume=70 |issue=11 |pages=6435–43 |date=November 2004 |pmid=15528503 |pmc=525172|doi=10.1128/AEM.70.11.6435-6443.2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  UV-treated water must therefore not be exposed to visible light for any significant period of time after UV treatment, before consumption, to avoid ingesting reactivated and dangerous microbes.

Recent developments in semiconductor technology allows for the development of UV-C [[Light-emitting diode|Light Emitting Diodes]] (LEDs). UV-C LED systems address disadvantages of mercury-based technology, namely: power-cycling penalties, high power needs, fragility, warm-up time, and mercury content.

===Ozone water disinfection===
{{Main|Ozone}}
In ozone water disinfection, microbes are destroyed by ozone gas (O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) provided by an ozone generator. Common in Europe, ozone gas is now becoming widely adopted in the United States. It is emerging across a wide array of industries; from municipal water treatment plants, to food processing plants, to healthcare organizations. It is being adopted due to its ability to sanitize water and surfaces without wasting water, and because there are no by-products. When its job is done, ozone gas quickly degrades into oxygen. Ozone is more effective than chlorine in destroying viruses and bacteria.

In 1990, the Organic Foods Production Act (OFPA) identified aqueous ozone as a substance that is allowed for use in organic crop and livestock production. In 1997, it was approved by the FDA as an antimicrobial agent for use on food. In 2002, the FDA approved ozone for use on food contact areas and directly on food with its Generally Regarded as Safe (“GRAS”) designation.

Ozone is most commonly created by a process called “corona discharge”, which causes oxygen molecules (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) to temporarily re-combine into ozone (O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). This gas is very unstable, and the 3rd oxygen molecule reacts with pathogens by penetrating the cell walls of bacteria and viruses. This destroys the organisms.

Ozone is effective against pollutants for the same reason; it will react with long-chain carbon (organic) molecules, and break them down into less complex (and typically less harmful) molecules through oxidation.

Advances in ozone generation techniques, coupled with filtration, make this a viable new portable water purification method.

===Solar water disinfection===
{{Main|SODIS}}
In solar water disinfection ([[SODIS]]), microbes are destroyed by temperature and [[Ultraviolet#Explanation|UVA]] radiation provided by the [[sun]].  Water is placed in a transparent plastic [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]]  bottle or plastic bag, oxygenated by shaking partially filled capped bottles prior to filling the bottles all the way, and left in the sun for 6–24 hours atop a reflective surface.

===Solar distillation===
{{Main|Solar still}}
Solar distillation relies on sunlight to warm and evaporate the water to be purified which then condenses and trickles into a container.  In theory, a solar (condensation) still removes all pathogens, salts, metals, and most chemicals but in field practice the lack of clean components, easy contact with dirt, improvised construction, and disturbances result in cleaner, yet contaminated water.

===Homemade water filters===
Water filters can be made on-site using local materials such as sand and [[charcoal]] (e.g. from firewood burned in a special way). These filters are sometimes used by soldiers and outdoor enthusiasts. Due to their low cost they can be made and used by anyone. The reliability of such systems is highly variable. Such filters can do little, if anything, to mitigate [[germ theory of disease|germs]] and other harmful constituents and can give a false sense of security that the water so produced is potable.  Water processed through an improvised filter should undergo secondary processing such as boiling to render it safe for consumption.

==Prevention of water contamination==
Human [[Waterborne diseases|water-borne diseases]] usually come from other humans, thus human-derived materials ([[Human feces|feces]], medical waste, wash water, lawn chemicals, gasoline engines, garbage, etc.) should be kept far away from water sources.  For example, [[human excreta]] should be buried well away (&gt;60 meters/200 feet) from water sources to reduce contamination.&lt;ref name="cdc"/&gt;  In some wilderness areas it is recommended that all waste be packed up and carted out to a properly designated disposal point.

'''Proteolix, Inc.''', was a private [[biotechnology]] company with headquarters in [[South San Francisco]], [[California]].  Proteolix was founded in 2003 based on technology developed by co-founders [[Craig M. Crews|Dr. Craig Crews]] (Yale University) and Dr. Raymond J. Deshaies (California Institute of Technology). Drs. Susan Molineaux and Phil Whitcome (deceased) joined Drs. Crews and Deshaies as co-founders. Proteolix was launched based on an $18.2 million A round comprising investments by Latterell Venture Partners, US Venture Partners, Advanced Technology Ventures, and The Vertical Group. Proteolix focused primarily on the [[proteasome]] as a therapeutic target.  Its lead product candidate, [[carfilzomib]] (PR-171), is a [[tetrapeptide]] [[epoxyketone]].  At the time of its sale (see below), the company had two earlier-stage programs, an orally-bioavailable proteasome inhibitor for oncology (PR-047), and an agent preferentially targeting the immuno form of the proteasome (PR-957), with potential utility in areas such as rheumatoid arthritis.  At the time of sale, Carfilzomib's route of administration was [[intravenous]], and the company was exploring its potential utility in [[multiple myeloma]], [[Non-Hodgkin lymphoma]] (NHL) and other cancers.  

Proteolix was acquired by [[Onyx Pharmaceuticals]] in 2009 for $810 million (nominal value).  Onyx renamed PR-047 to "[https://web.archive.org/web/20110523065128/http://www.onyx-pharm.com/clinical-development/onx-091 ONX 0912]" and PR-957 to "[https://web.archive.org/web/20110523065128/http://www.onyx-pharm.com/clinical-development/onx-091 ONX 0914]".

The '''Sardeh Band Dam''' ({{lang-ps|د سردې بند برېښناکوټ}}) is located near [[Sardeh Band]] town, in the eastern part of [[Andar District]] of [[Ghazni Province]] of [[Afghanistan]]. It was constructed in 1967 (1346 in the [[Islamic calendar]]) by the [[Soviet Union]] and Afghanistan during the reign of [[Mohammed Zahir Shah]] prior to the [[Soviet–Afghan War]]. The dam provided irrigation water for more than 67,000 [[jeribs]] of land after completion. Currently only 2,000 jeribs of land is under cultivation. Maximum capacity of the reservoir is 259 million cubic meters of water, and the reservoir holds about 164 million gallons at present.

The dam system contains an earth dam, intake, spillway, one main canal (which is divides into two branches (the 21.5-kilometer Right Canal with 6 sub-canals and the 30-kilometer Left Canal with 16 sub-canals) and administration buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNADG475.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027031700/http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNADG475.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sardeh Dam Reservoir is fed by the [[Jilga River]] which flows north–south from [[Paktika Province]] and [[Paktiya Province]].  The river is also labeled as the [[Gardez River]] north of the dam and the [[Sardeh River]] south of the dam (by the National Atlas of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, page 13-14).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNADG475.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027031700/http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNADG475.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==
The dam is an indication of the presence of aid from the USSR in Afghanistan prior to the invasion and subsequent occupation from 1979–1989. According to C.J. Chivers of the ''New York Times'': "Moscow built schools, roads, airports and dams, and sponsored ministries, too. Soviet officials recruited students and bureaucrats for all manner of training, and invited the country’s elite and its officer-, civil-service and intellectual classes to long periods of study in the Soviet Union. Education, development and modernization—like this dam, which still influences both flood control and irrigation downstream—played no small part in the Kremlin’s Afghan policy, which ultimately failed."&lt;ref&gt;http://atwar.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/21/reporters-notebook-in-afghanistan-glimpses-of-the-soviet-try/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Band E Sardeh Dam was built during the same period as the [[Aswan Dam|High Dam]] in Aswan, Egypt, indicating a larger Soviet strategy for the development of third world nations it sought to bring under its sphere of influence. Large lettered Russian writing is still present on the down-stream face of the dam (visible from over 500 meters away) commemorating its completion in Russian and Pashto script. On the left it reads: "сарде 1967" and on the right: دسرده بند۱۳۴۶

==Rehabilitation==
According to USAID's [http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNACY283.pdf Ghazni Infrastructure Needs Assessment: September 14–18, 2003] The Deputy Governor and other provincial officials agreed that the top priority for irrigation infrastructure rehabilitation in Ghazni province is the Sardeh Band Dam. The Director of the dam, as well as the local farmers, is extremely disappointed in the progress of the donor community on the dam. The Director reported that 14 NGOs, both national and international, have been asked to conduct assessments on the dam and surveys for funding the rehabilitation of the dam. Of these 14 NGOs, only four have conducted the assessments, and none have received funding for work to date. The NGOs who have conducted assessments on the dam are: International Engineering Consultancy Company, ACLU, LERCC and ARA (local NGO).

On 2 February 2010 members of Ghazni [[Provincial Reconstruction Team]] and [[Central Asia Development Group]] met with key leaders from Andar district to enlist support for a massive irrigation project concerning the repair of the irrigation canals fed by the Band E Sardeh Dam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isaf.nato.int/article/isaf-releases/ghazni-prt-members-meet-with-afghans-to-discuss-irrigation-project.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130308154642/http://www.isaf.nato.int/article/isaf-releases/ghazni-prt-members-meet-with-afghans-to-discuss-irrigation-project.html |archivedate=2013-03-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; "The [[Chardewal]] irrigation system was built to distribute water from the Bandee Sardi Dam throughout much of Andar, but due to neglect the canals have fallen into disrepair. Currently, water flows at only 50 percent capacity, limiting the ability of local farmers of the Kahnjoor farming zone to make a living. The reconstructed canal would be a one-kilometer cobblestone irrigation channel along the village with a curb separating the roadway from the canal. Chardewal, a village located in the middle of Andar, has suffered from drought and poor water management. With mentoring from the PRT, cooperation from the district sub-governor and village elders, the CADG will rebuild the village canal. It is the first stage of a long term [[cash-for-work program]] aimed at restoring the irrigation system and rehabilitating the Kahnjoor farming zone. Capacity building in this unstable district is considered the most critical mission for the development, reconstruction and stabilization efforts being made in Andar. 'Our problems are our water (supply) and our roads,' said Niaz Mohammad, an elder from Chardewal. 'We do not have enough water, wells or roads.' The project hopes to provide cash-for-work for deprived households in a [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] dominated area. The project could improve the agricultural potential for more than 2,000 people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isaf.nato.int/article/isaf-releases/ghazni-prt-members-meet-with-afghans-to-discuss-irrigation-project.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130308154642/http://www.isaf.nato.int/article/isaf-releases/ghazni-prt-members-meet-with-afghans-to-discuss-irrigation-project.html |archivedate=2013-03-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 7 August 2011 plenary session of the Meshrano Jirga (MJ) Senators invited the Emergency Response Committee to hear about their preparations for emergencies.  When discussing current drought conditions, Alhaj Allah Dad (Ghazni Senator)said: "The Bandi Sardi dam is full of mud. If cleared, it could irrigate thousands of acres of agricultural land."&lt;ref&gt;11 August 2011, Vol. 6, No. 03 USAID Legislative Newsletter&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military activity==
The Band E Sardeh Dam was the home of a Soviet garrison during their occupation of Afghanistan during the 1980s and currently garrisons an Afghan National Army Battalion.&lt;ref&gt;http://ntm-a.com/archives/5782 {{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearby the Band E Sardeh Dam is the abandoned [[Sardeh Band Airport]] which was used during the Soviet occupation but now no longer exists.  The wrecked hulls of Soviet tanks, armored personnel carriers, and other heavy equipment are still present as of 2012.   Both the Afghan and U.S. militaries at Bande Sardeh have used the base as a gathering place for locals and elders to discuss local security and military developments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clarksvilleonline.com/2010/12/26/nds-task-force-iron-rakkasan-gather-bande-sardeh-elders-sign-security-pact/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303235328/http://www.clarksvilleonline.com/2010/12/26/nds-task-force-iron-rakkasan-gather-bande-sardeh-elders-sign-security-pact/ |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 June 2002 a Lockheed MC-130H Hercules was participating in a night exfiltration mission to remove U.S. Army Special Forces troops from the area when it tried to take off from an improved [[Sardeh Band Airport|airstrip at Sardeh Band]]. The plane impacted the ground and [[List of accidents and incidents involving the Lockheed C-130 Hercules|crashed]] in a barren area, 2.5 nautical miles from the airstrip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20020612-0 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207044352/http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20020612-0 |archivedate=2006-02-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;usaf.aib.law.af.mil/MC-130H_Afghanistan_12Jun02.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soviet expeditionary dam construction==
[[File:Band E Sardeh Dam of Andar, Ghazni, Afghanistan March 2012.jpg|right|thumb|Band E Sardeh Dam]]The Soviet Union built many other dams in other countries as it sought to extend its sphere of influence.  Many of these projects were undertaken by a Russian firm called [[Hydroproject]] (Russian: Институт «Гидропроект», Gidroproekt).  It is unclear if Hydroproject was involved in the design or construction of Band E Sardeh Dam.  Other expeditionary projects undertaken by Hydroproject include:
* [[Aswan High Dam]] in [[Egypt]]
* [[Jenpeg Dam]], the first stage of [[Nelson River Hydroelectric Project]] in [[Manitoba]], [[Canada]]
* [[Paraná Medio]], [[Argentina]] (proposed)
* [[Sanmenxia Dam]], [[China]]

A '''semen analysis''' (plural: semen analyses), also called "''seminogram''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lozano GM, Bejarano I, Espino J, González D, Ortiz A, García JF, Rodríguez AB, Pariente JA | year = 2009 | title = Density gradient capacitation is the most suitable method to improve fertilization and to reduce DNA fragmentation positive spermatozoa of infertile men | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259983025_Density_gradient_capacitation_is_the_most_suitable_method_to_improve_fertilization_and_to_reduce_DNA_fragmentation_positive_spermatozoa_of_infertile_men | journal = Anatolian Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology | volume = 3 | issue = 1| pages = 1–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; evaluates certain characteristics of a male's [[semen]] and the [[spermatozoon|sperm]] contained therein.  It is done to help evaluate male [[fertility]], whether for those seeking [[pregnancy]] or verifying the success of [[vasectomy]].  Depending on the measurement method, just a few characteristics may be evaluated (such as with a home kit) or many characteristics may be evaluated (generally by a diagnostic laboratory).  Collection techniques and precise measurement method may influence results.

==Reasons for testing==
The most common reasons for laboratory semen analysis in humans are as part of a couple's [[infertility]] investigation and after a [[vasectomy]] to verify that the procedure was successful. It is also commonly used for testing human donors for [[sperm donation]], and for animals semen analysis is commonly used in [[stud farming]] and farm [[animal breeding]].

Occasionally a man will have a semen analysis done as part of routine pre-pregnancy testing.  At the laboratory level this is rare, as most healthcare providers will not test the semen and sperm unless specifically requested or there is a strong suspicion of a pathology in one of these areas discovered during the medical history or during the physical examination. Such testing is very expensive and time-consuming, and in the U.S. is unlikely to be covered by insurance. In other countries, such as Germany, the testing is covered by all insurances.

==Relation to fertility==
The characteristics measured by semen analysis are only some of the factors in [[semen quality]].  One source states that 30% of men with a normal semen analysis actually have abnormal sperm function.&lt;!--
 --&gt;&lt;ref name="stonybrook"&gt;{{cite web|title=Understanding Semen Analysis |publisher=Stonybrook, State University of New York |year=1999 |url=http://www.uhmc.sunysb.edu/urology/male_infertility/SEMEN_ANALYSIS.html |accessdate=2007-08-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017033415/http://www.uhmc.sunysb.edu/urology/male_infertility/SEMEN_ANALYSIS.html |archivedate=October 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Conversely, men with poor semen analysis results may go on to father children.&lt;!--

 --&gt; In [[NICE guidelines]], ''mild male factor infertility'' is defined as when 2 or more semen analyses have 1 or more variables below the 5th [[percentile]], and confers a chance of pregnancy occurring
naturally through vaginal intercourse within 2 years similar to people with mild [[endometriosis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG156 Fertility: assessment and treatment for people with fertility problems]. [[NICE guidelines|NICE clinical guideline]] CG156 - Issued: February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collection methods==
{{Main|Semen collection}}
Different methods used for semen collection are [[masturbation]], condom collection and [[Epididymis|epididymal]] extraction, etc. The sample should never be obtained through coitus interruptus for several reasons: Some part of ejaculation could be lost, bacterial contamination could happen and the acid vaginal pH could be detrimental for sperm motility. 
The optimal sexual abstinence for semen sample obtaining is from 2–7 days. The most common way to obtain a semen sample is through masturbation and the best place to obtain it is in the clinic where the analysis will take place in order to avoid temperature changes during the transport that can be lethal for some spermatozoa.
Once the sample is obtained, it must be put directly in a sterile plastic recipient (never in a conventional preservative since they have chemical substances as lubricants or spermicides that could damage the sample) and be handed in the clinic for it to be studied within the following hour.

==Parameters==
Examples of parameters measured in a semen analysis are: sperm count, motility, morphology, volume, fructose level and pH.

===Sperm count===
[[Image:Success rates by amount of sperm.svg|thumb|right|250px|Approximate [[pregnancy rate]] varies with amount of sperm used in an artificial insemination cycle. Values are for intrauterine insemination, with sperm number in ''total sperm count'', which may be approximately twice the ''total motile sperm count''.]]

Sperm count, or ''sperm concentration'' to avoid confusion with ''total sperm count'', measures the concentration of sperm in a man's ejaculate, distinguished from ''total sperm count'', which is the sperm count multiplied with volume. Over 15 million sperm per milliliter is considered normal, according to the WHO in 2010.&lt;ref name="who2010"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cooper TG, Noonan E, von Eckardstein S, Auger J, Baker HW, Behre HM, Haugen TB, Kruger T, Wang C, Mbizvo MT, Vogelsong KM | title = World Health Organization reference values for human semen characteristics. | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 231–45 | date = May–Jun 2010 | pmid = 19934213 | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmp048 | url = http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/infertility/cooper_et_al_hru.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Older definitions state 20 million.&lt;ref name="stonybrook" /&gt;&lt;ref name="webmd" /&gt; A lower sperm count is considered [[oligospermia|oligozoospermia]]. A vasectomy is considered successful if the sample is [[Azoospermia|azoospermic]] (zero sperm of any kind found). Some define success as when rare/occasional non-motile sperm are observed (fewer than 100,000 per millilitre).&lt;!--
 --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rajmil O, Fernández M, Rojas-Cruz C, Sevilla C, Musquera M, Ruiz-Castañe E | title = Azoospermia should not be given as the result of vasectomy | language = Spanish | journal = Arch. Esp. Urol. | volume = 60 | issue = 1 | pages = 55–8 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17408173 }}&lt;br&gt;
{{cite journal |vauthors=Dhar NB, Bhatt A, Jones JS | title = Determining the success of vasectomy | journal = BJU Int. | volume = 97 | issue = 4 | pages = 773–6 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16536771 | doi = 10.1111/j.1464-410X.2006.06107.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others advocate obtaining a second semen analysis to verify the counts are not increasing (as can happen with re-canalization) and others still may perform a repeat vasectomy for this situation.

Chips for home use are emerging that can give an accurate estimation of sperm count after three samples taken on different days. Such a chip may measure the concentration of sperm in a semen sample against a control liquid filled with polystyrene beads.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2010-01/counting-chip-provides-cheap-home-sperm-counting  New Chip Provides Cheap At-Home Sperm Counting] By Stuart Fox Posted 01.26.2010 in Popular Science&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=December 2017}}

===Motility===

The [[World Health Organization]] has a value of 50% and this must be measured within 60 minutes of collection. WHO also has a parameter of ''vitality'', with a lower [[reference limit]] of 60% live spermatozoa.&lt;ref name="who2010"/&gt; A man can have a total number of sperm far over the limit of 20 million sperm cells per milliliter, but still have bad quality because too few of them are motile. However, if the sperm count is very high, then a low motility (for example, less than 60%) might not matter, because the fraction might still be more than 8 million per millilitre. The other way around, a man can have a sperm count far less than 20 million sperm cells per millilitre and still have good motility, if more than 60% of those observed sperm cells show good forward movement - which is beneficial because nature favours quality over quantity.

A more specified measure is ''motility grade'', where the motility of sperm are divided into four different grades:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sharedjourney.com/define/semen2.html|title=Fertility Testing and Semen Analysis|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Grade a''': Sperm with progressive motility. These are the strongest and swim fast in a straight line. Sometimes it is also denoted motility '''IV'''.
* '''Grade b''': (non-linear motility): These also move forward but tend to travel in a curved or crooked motion. Sometimes also denoted motility '''III'''.
* '''Grade c''': These have non-progressive motility because they do not move forward despite the fact that they move their tails. Sometimes also denoted motility '''II'''.
* '''Grade d''': These are immotile and fail to move at all. Sometimes also denoted motility '''I'''.

[[File:Abnormalsperm.svg|thumb]]

===Morphology===
Regarding sperm [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]], the WHO criteria as described in 2010 state that a sample is normal (samples from men whose partners had a pregnancy in the last 12 months) if 4% (or 5th centile) or more of the observed sperm have normal morphology.&lt;ref name="who2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rothmann&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rothmann SA, Bort AM, Quigley J, Pillow R | title = Sperm morphology classification: a rational method for schemes adopted by the world health organization. | journal = Methods in Molecular Biology | volume = 927 | pages = 27–37 | year = 2013 | pmid = 22992901 | doi = 10.1007/978-1-62703-038-0_4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morphology is a predictor of success in fertilizing oocytes during [[in vitro fertilization]].

Up to 10% of all spermatozoa have observable defects and as such are disadvantaged in terms of fertilising an oocyte.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sadler|first=T.|title=Langman's medical embryology.|year=2010|publisher=Lippincott William &amp; Wilkins|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-7817-9069-7|pages=30|edition=11th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, sperm cells with tail-tip swelling patterns generally have lower frequency of [[aneuploidy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pang MG, You YA, Park YJ, Oh SA, Kim DS, Kim YJ | title = Numerical chromosome abnormalities are associated with sperm tail swelling patterns | journal = Fertil. Steril. | volume = 94 | issue = 3 | pages = 1012–1020 | date = June 2009 | pmid = 19505688 | doi = 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2009.04.043 | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|MSOME}}
A ''motile sperm organelle morphology examination'' (MSOME) is a particular morphologic investigation wherein an inverted [[light microscope]] equipped with high-power optics and enhanced by digital imaging is used to achieve a magnification above x6000, which is much higher than the magnification used habitually by embryologists in spermatozoa selection for [[intracytoplasmic sperm injection]] (x200 to x400).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Oliveira JB, Massaro FC, Mauri AL, Petersen CG, Nicoletti AP, Baruffi RL, Franco JG | title = Motile sperm organelle morphology examination is stricter than Tygerberg criteria | journal = Reproductive biomedicine online | volume = 18 | issue = 3 | pages = 320–326 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19298729 | doi = 10.1016/S1472-6483(10)60088-0 }} [http://www.crh.com.br/45.pdf]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; A potential finding on MSOME is the presence of sperm vacuoles, which are associated with sperm chromatin immaturity, particularly in the case of large vacuoles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Perdrix A, Rives N | title = Motile sperm organelle morphology examination (MSOME) and sperm head vacuoles: State of the art in 2013 | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 19 | issue = 5 | pages = 527–541 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23825157 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmt021 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Volume===
According to one lab test manual semen volumes between 2.0&amp;nbsp;[[milliliters|mL]] and 5&amp;nbsp;mL are normal;&lt;ref name="webmd" /&gt; WHO regards 1.5 ml as the lower [[reference limit]].&lt;ref name="who2010" /&gt; Low volume may indicate partial or complete blockage of the [[seminal vesicle]]s, or that the man was born without seminal vesicles.&lt;ref name="stonybrook" /&gt; In clinical practice, a volume of less than 2 mL in the setting of infertility and absent sperm should prompt an evaluation for obstructive [[azoospermia]].  A caveat to this is be sure it has been at least 48 hours since the last ejaculation to time of sample collection.

The human ejaculate is mostly composed of water. 96 to 98% of semen is water. One way of ensuring that a man produces more ejaculate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to increase your ejaculate|url=http://www.yellowsemen.com/how-to-cum-more/|accessdate=8 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is to drink more liquids. Men also produce more seminal fluid after lengthy [[sexual stimulation]] and arousal. Reducing the frequency of sex and [[masturbation]] helps increase semen volume. [[Sexually-Transmitted Diseases|Sexually transmitted diseases]] also affect the production of semen. Men who are infected&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Semen alterations in HIV-1 infected men|url=https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article/17/8/2112/603024/Semen-alterations-in-HIV-1-infected-men}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[Human Immunodeficiency Virus|human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV) produce lower semen volume.

===Color===
Semen normally has a whitish-gray color. It tends to get a yellowish tint as a man ages. Semen color is also influenced by the food we eat: foods that are high in sulfur, such as [[garlic]], may result in a man producing yellow semen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yellowsemen.com/causes-of-yellow-semen-and-yellow-sperm/|title=Causes of Yellow Semen and Yellow Sperm: What Color is Sperm?|date=12 April 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Presence of blood in semen ([[hematospermia]]) leads to a brownish or red colored ejaculate. Hematospermia is a rare condition.

Semen that has a deep yellow color or is greenish in appearance may be due to medication. Brown semen is mainly a result of infection and inflammation of the prostate gland, [[urethra]], epididymis and seminal vesicles.{{Citation needed|reason=Original source does not contain this claim|date=March 2017}} Other causes of unusual semen color include sexually transmitted infections such as [[gonorrhea]] and [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]], genital surgery and injury to the male sex organs.

===Fructose level===
[[Fructose]] level in the semen may be analysed to determine the amount of energy available to the semen for moving.&lt;ref name="webmd" /&gt;  WHO specifies a normal level of 13&amp;nbsp;μ[[Mole (unit)|mol]] per sample.  Absence of fructose may indicate a problem with the seminal vesicles.&lt;ref name="stonybrook" /&gt;

===pH===
According to one lab test manual normal [[pH]] range is 7.1-8.0;&lt;ref name="webmd" /&gt; WHO criteria specify normal as 7.2-7.8.&lt;ref name="stonybrook" /&gt;  Acidic ejaculate (lower pH value) may indicate one or both of the seminal vesicles are blocked.  A basic ejaculate (higher pH value) may indicate an [[infection]].&lt;ref name="stonybrook" /&gt;  A pH value outside of the normal range is harmful to sperm and affect their ability to penetrate the egg.&lt;ref name="webmd" /&gt;

===Liquefaction===
The [[Liquification|liquefaction]] is the process when the gel formed by proteins from the seminal vesicles is broken up and the semen becomes more liquid. It normally takes less than 20 minutes for the sample to change from a thick [[gel]] into a [[liquid]]. In the [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence|NICE]] guidelines, a liquefaction time within 60 minutes is regarded as within normal ranges.&lt;ref name=nice&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/CG011publicinfoenglish.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5rhjtxNOs?url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/CG011publicinfoenglish.pdf |archivedate=2010-08-03 |df= }} {{cite book |title=Fertility: Assessment and Treatment for People with Fertility Problems |publisher=RCOG Press |location=London |year=2004 |pages= |isbn=1-900364-97-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MOT===
MOT is a measure of how many million sperm cells per ml are highly motile,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dk.cryosinternational.com/resources/questions-answers#3219|title=Frequently asked questions|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is, approximately of grade a (&gt;25 micrometer per 5 sek. at room temperature) and grade b (&gt;25 micrometer per 25 sek. at room temperature). Thus, it is a combination of sperm count and motility.

With a straw &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dk.cryosinternational.com/resources/questions-answers#3270|title=Frequently asked questions|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a vial volume of 0.5 milliliter, the general guideline is that, for [[intracervical insemination]] (ICI), straws or vials making a total of 20 million motile spermatozoa in total is recommended. This is equal to 8 straws or vials 0.5 ml with MOT5, or 2 straws or vials of MOT20. For [[intrauterine insemination]] (IUI), 1-2 MOT5 straws or vials is regarded sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dk.cryosinternational.com/resources/questions-answers#3212|title=Frequently asked questions|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In WHO terms, it is thus recommended to use approximately 20 million grade a+b sperm in ICI, and 2 million grade a+b in IUI.

===DNA damage===
DNA damage in sperm cells that is related to infertility can be probed by analysis of DNA susceptibility to denaturation in response to heat or acid treatment &lt;ref&gt;Evenson DP, Darzynkiewicz Z, Melamed MR. (1980) Relation of mammalian sperm chromatin heterogeneity to fertility. Science 210:1131-1133; {{PMID|7444440}}&lt;/ref&gt; and/or by detection of [[DNA fragmentation]] revealed by the presence of double-strand breaks detected by the [[TUNEL assay]].&lt;ref&gt;Gorczyca W, Traganos F, Jesionowska H, Darzynkiewicz Z. (1993) Presence of DNA strand breaks and increased sensitivity of DNA in situ to denaturation in abnormal human sperm cells. Analogy to apoptosis of somatic cells. Exp Cell Res 207:202-205; {{PMID|8391465}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Evenson DP.

Sep;6(Suppl 4):S495-S500. doi 10.21037/tau.2017.07.20. {{PMID|29082168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Total motile spermatozoa===
''Total motile spermatozoa'' (TMS)&lt;ref name=merviel&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Merviel P, Heraud MH, Grenier N, Lourdel E, Sanguinet P, Copin H | title = Predictive factors for pregnancy after intrauterine insemination (IUI): An analysis of 1038 cycles and a review of the literature | journal = Fertil. Steril. | volume = 93 | issue = 1 | pages = 79–88 | date = November 2008 | pmid = 18996517 | doi = 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2008.09.058 | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''total motile sperm count'' (TMSC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pasqualotto EB, Daitch JA, Hendin BN, Falcone T, Thomas AJ, Nelson DR, Agarwal A | title = Relationship of total motile sperm count and percentage motile sperm to successful pregnancy rates following intrauterine insemination | journal = J. Assist. Reprod. Genet. | volume = 16 | issue = 9 | pages = 476–82 | date = October 1999 | pmid = 10530401 | pmc = 3455631 | doi = 10.1023/A:1020598916080 | url = http://www.kluweronline.com/art.pdf?issn=1058-0468&amp;volume=16&amp;page=476 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a combination of sperm count, motility and volume, measuring how many million sperm cells in an entire ejaculate are motile.

Use of approximately 20 million sperm of motility grade c or d in ICI, and 5 million ones in IUI may be an approximate recommendation.

===Others===
The NICE guidelines also include testing ''vitality'', with normal ranges defined as more than 75% of sperm cells alive.&lt;ref name=nice/&gt;

The sample may also be tested for [[white blood cell]]s.  A high level of white blood cells in semen is called {{visible anchor|leucospermia}} and may indicate an infection.&lt;ref name="stonybrook" /&gt; [[Cutoff (reference value)|Cutoff]]s may vary, but an example cutoff is over 1 million white blood cells per milliliter of semen.&lt;ref name="stonybrook" /&gt;

==Abnormalities==
* [[Aspermia]]: absence of semen
* [[Azoospermia]]: absence of sperm
* [[Hypospermia]]: low semen volume
* [[Hyperspermia]]: high semen volume
* [[Oligozoospermia]]: Very low sperm count
* [[Asthenozoospermia]]: poor sperm motility
* [[Teratozoospermia]]: sperm carry more morphological defects than usual
* [[Necrozoospermia]]: all sperm in the ejaculate are dead
* ''Leucospermia'': a high level of white blood cells in semens

==Factors that influence results==
Apart from the [[semen quality]] itself, there are various methodological factors that may influence the results, giving rise to [[inter-method variation]].

Compared to samples obtained from masturbation, semen samples from collection condoms have higher total sperm counts, sperm motility, and percentage of sperm with normal morphology {{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}. For this reason, they are believed to give more accurate results when used for semen analysis.

If the results from a man's first sample are subfertile, they must be verified with at least two more analyses.  At least 2 to 4 weeks must be allowed between each analysis.{{mcn|date=December 2017}}  Results for a single man may have a large amount of natural variation over time, meaning a single sample may not be representative of a man's average semen characteristics.&lt;!--
 --&gt;{{mcn|date=December 2017}}  In addition, sperm physiologist Joanna Ellington believes that the stress of producing an ejaculate sample for examination, often in an unfamiliar setting and without any lubrication (most lubricants are somewhat harmful to sperm), may explain why men's first samples often show poor results while later samples show normal results.{{mcn|date=December 2017}}
 
A man may prefer to produce his sample at home rather than at the clinic.  The site of semen collection does ''not'' affect the results of a semen analysis.&lt;!--
 --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Licht RS, Handel L, Sigman M | title = Site of semen collection and its effect on semen analysis parameters | journal = Fertil. Steril. | volume = 89 | issue = 2 | pages = 395–7 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17482174 | doi = 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2007.02.033 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement methods==
Volume can be determined by measuring the weight of the sample container, knowing the mass of the empty container. Sperm count and morphology can be calculated by microscopy. Sperm count can also be estimated by kits that measure the amount of a sperm-associated protein, and are suitable for home use.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120723092112/http://www.dailyprogress.com/cdp/news/local/article/charlottesville_company_sends_out_its_home_male_sterility_tests/40086/ dailyprogress.com &amp;gt; Charlottesville company sends out its home male sterility tests] By Brian McNeill. Published: May 14, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=December 2017}}

'''''Computer Assisted Semen Analysis''''' (CASA) is a catch-all phrase for automatic or semi-automatic semen analysis techniques. Most systems are based on [[image analysis]], but alternative methods exist such as tracking cell movement on a [[digitizing tablet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mortimer ST | title = CASA--practical aspects | journal = J.

'''Smoking in Ireland''' is [[smoking ban|banned]] fully in the [[employment|general workplace]], enclosed [[public space|public places]], restaurants, bars, [[education|education facilities]], [[hospital|healthcare facilities]] and public transport. However, it is permitted in designated [[hotel|hotel rooms]] and there is no ban in [[residential care]], prisons and in outdoor areas.&lt;ref name="Tobacco overview"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ec.europa.eu/health/tobacco/docs/tobacco_overview2011_en.pdf | title=Overview of smoke-free legislation in the EU | publisher=European Commission | date=May 2011 | accessdate=27 August 2013 | pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public opinion is in favour of the bans on smoking imposed in Ireland.&lt;ref name="Flash Eurobarometer poll"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ec.europa.eu/health/archive/ph_determinants/life_style/tobacco/documents/eb_253_en.pdf | title=Survey on Tobacco Analytical report | publisher=European Commission | work=Gallup | date=March 2009 | accessdate=27 August 2013 | pages=56, 58, 60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Currently, the Irish law prohibits smoking fully in the [[employment|general workplace]], enclosed [[public space|public places]], restaurants, bars, [[education|education facilities]], [[hospital|healthcare facilities]] and public transport. Smoking rooms are permitted in hotels.&lt;ref name="Tobacco overview" /&gt;

As of July 2009, it is prohibited to advertise cigarettes and sell 10-packs of cigarettes in retail outlets. Additionally, as of February 2013, any tobacco product placed on the market must have graphic warnings.&lt;ref name="Graphic photos" /&gt; There is legislation being made to introduce [[plain tobacco packaging]] and make Ireland the second country to do so, after Australia.&lt;ref name="Plain cigarette packets"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/health/plain-cigarette-packets-to-be-introduced-1.1408747 | title=Plain cigarette packets to be introduced | work=The Irish Times | date=28 May 2013 | accessdate=28 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bans on smoking===
Smoking in workplaces in Ireland was banned on 29 March 2004, making Ireland the first country in the world to institute an outright ban on smoking in workplaces. From that date onwards, under the ''Public Health (Tobacco) Acts'', it has been illegal to smoke in all enclosed workplaces. The ban is strictly enforced and includes bars, restaurants, clubs, offices, public buildings, company cars, trucks, taxis and vans. A private residence is considered a workplace when tradespeople, such as plumbers or electricians, are working there.
€3,000 is the maximum fine on the spot, while a prison sentence can also be given at a later time for violators. The law exempts dwellings, prisons, nursing homes, psychiatric wards, hotel rooms charitable accommodation  and college dorm rooms. Certain buildings such as some hospitals forbid smoking anywhere in the grounds.

Before the 2004 law, smoking was already outlawed in public buildings, hospitals, schools, restaurant kitchens, cinemas, public pharmacies, public hairdressing premises, public banking halls, and on public transport aircraft and buses and some trains (Intercity trains provided smokers' carriages).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eu2004.ie/templates/standard.asp?sNavlocator=3,242,455 EU 2004 – "Smoking ban is first in world"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080105210140/http://www.eu2004.ie/templates/standard.asp?sNavlocator=3%2C242%2C455 |date= 5 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Premises must display a sign to inform patrons of the ban (in Irish or English), and the contact person for any complaints. A workplace can be given a fine of €3,000 for each person that is found smoking (this means €15,000 for 5 people in violation). Smoking rooms are not allowed. Any shelter can not have more than 50 percent coverage of walls. There is also a ''Compliance Line'' set up by the Office of Tobacco Control, that people can call to report people smoking in a workplace or retail outlets selling tobacco to under-18s. 

On 18 July 2008, Irish [[Fine Gael]] MEP [[Avril Doyle]] proposed in a committee in the European Parliament, that she would like to see an EU-wide ban on cigarettes and cigars by 2025.&lt;ref&gt;EUObserver [http://euobserver.com/9/26515 MEP calls for EU ban on cigarettes by 2025] 18 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cigarette packaging and advertising regulations ===
On 1 July 2009, Ireland banned in-store tobacco advertising and [[Tobacco display ban|displays of tobacco products]] at retail outlets and new controls on tobacco vending machines (limiting them to being token-operated in registered bars and clubs only) were also introduced. At the same time a ban on the sale of packets of 10 cigarettes was introduced. Tobacco advertising had already been banned from radio, television and on billboards beforehand. The changes now mean that tobacco products must now be stored out of sight in closed containers behind the counter (accessible by retail staff only) and customers can be shown a card showing all available brands in a pictorial list if they wish to purchase cigarettes. Signs must also be shown informing customers that tobacco is sold at the premises. Ireland was the first country in the EU and third in the world (after Canada and Iceland) to introduce such measures, which are punishable with a fine of €3,000 and/or a six-month prison sentence. However, specialist tobacco shops (of which there are fewer than six) are exempt from the new rules; all retailers selling tobacco must register with the [[Health Service Executive]] and the new laws will be enforced by environmental health officers.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

As of 1 February 2013, any tobacco product placed on the market must have graphic warnings.&lt;ref name="Graphic photos"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newstalk.ie/If-tobacco-were-discovered-today-it-would-not-be-a-legal-product | title=New graphic photos on Irish tobacco products from today | publisher=Newstalk | date=1 February 2013 | accessdate=28 August 2013 | author=Roche, Sandra}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Minister for Health (Ireland)|Minister for Health]], [[James Reilly (Irish politician)|Dr. James Reilly]]'s proposal to introduce [[plain tobacco packaging]] was approved by the [[Government of Ireland|Cabinet]] and expected legislation will be in place by early 2014.&lt;ref name="Plain cigarette packets"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/health/plain-cigarette-packets-to-be-introduced-1.1408747 | title=Plain cigarette packets to be introduced | work=The Irish Times | date=28 May 2013 | accessdate=28 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of September 2017 all cigarettes must remove all logos and feature plain packaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maynard|first=Olivia M.|last2=Brooks|first2=Jonathan C.

==Public opinion==
The public, according to a Flash Eurobarometer poll conducted by the Gallup Organisation in 2008 for the [[European Commission]], is in favour of a full ban on smoking in restaurants, bars, pubs, clubs, offices and other indoor workplaces.&lt;ref name="Flash Eurobarometer poll"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ec.europa.eu/health/archive/ph_determinants/life_style/tobacco/documents/eb_253_en.pdf | title=Survey on Tobacco Analytical report | publisher=European Commission | work=Gallup | date=March 2009 | accessdate=27 August 2013 | pages=56, 58, 60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the above poll there is a majority of people who support the ban on smoking introduced in 2004.

==Ban on smoking in private vehicles==
Since 2009, Irish anti-smoking campaigners and scientists had been urging the government to introduce such a ban.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ash.ie/News/Latest_News/ASH_launch_campaign.html ASH Ireland] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504133925/http://www.ash.ie/News/Latest_News/ASH_launch_campaign.html |date= 4 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishhealth.com/article.html?id=15119 Irish Health]&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2011 the Minister for Health said that he was considering a ban where children are present in the car.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2011/0727/breaking17.html?via=mr Children on board? Smoking in cars may be banned]&lt;/ref&gt; On January 1st 2016, regulations make it an offence for a person to smoke in a private vehicle when there is more than one person present and there is a person under the age of 18 present. The offence would fall on the person smoking regardless of their age.&lt;ref&gt;[https://health.gov.ie/healthy-ireland/tobacco/smoking-in-cars-with-children-present/?via=mr Smoking banned in private vehicles with children onboard]&lt;/ref&gt;

The senator and oncologist [[John Crown]] put a bill before parliament in 2012 to ban smoking in a car with children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/picture-a-car-filled-with-secondhand-smoke-and-child-in-the-seat-3081119.html | work=Irish Independent | title=Picture a car filled with second-hand smoke and child in the seat | date=2 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oireachtas.ie/viewdoc.asp?DocID=20997&amp;&amp;CatID=59]&lt;/ref&gt; This bill was passed into law in December 2014 with an expectation that enforcement by Gardaí would commence in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oireachtas.ie/documents/bills28/acts/2014/a4014.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Subjective well-being''' ('''SWB''') is a self-reported measure of [[well-being]], typically obtained by questionnaire.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.oecd.org/site/worldforum06/38331839.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160107223341/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/well-being/publications/measuring-subjective-well-being-in-the-uk.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ed Diener]] developed a tripartite model of subjective well-being in 1984, which describes how people experience the [[quality of life|quality of their lives]] and includes both [[emotion]]al reactions and [[cognitive]] judgments.&lt;ref name="Diener1984"&gt;{{cite journal|last= Diener|first=Ed| title= Subjective well-being|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year= 1984|volume= 95|pages=542–575|url= http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/bul/95/3/542/|issue=3|doi= 10.1037/0033-2909.95.3.542|pmid= 6399758}}&lt;/ref&gt; It posits "three distinct but often related components of wellbeing: frequent positive [[affect (psychology)|affect]], infrequent negative [[affect (psychology)|affect]], and cognitive evaluations such as [[life satisfaction]]."&lt;ref&gt;Tov &amp; Diener (2013), ''Subjective Well-Being''. Research Collection School of Social Sciences. Paper 1395. http://ink.library.sju.edu.sg/soss_research/1395&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/49658154_A_Review_of_the_Tripartite_Structure_of_Subjective_Well-Being_Implications_for_Conceptualization_Operationalization_Analysis_and_Synthesis&lt;/ref&gt;

SWB therefore encompasses [[mood (psychology)|moods]] and emotions as well as evaluations of one's satisfaction with general and specific areas of one's life.&lt;ref name=Diener1999&gt;{{cite journal|last= Diener|first=Ed |author2=Suh, E.M. |author3=Lucas, R.E. |author4=Smith, H.L|title=Subjective well-being: Three Decades of Progress|journal= Psychological Bulletin |year=1999|volume=125|pages=276–302|url =http://stat.psych.uiuc.edu/~ediener/Documents/Diener-Suh-Lucas-Smith_1999.pdf|doi= 10.1037/0033-2909.125.2.276|issue= 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concepts encompassed by SWB include [[happiness]]. 

SWB tends to be stable over time&lt;ref name=Diener1999/&gt; and is strongly related to [[personality psychology|personality traits]].&lt;ref name=Steel&gt;{{cite journal|last= Steel|first=Piers |author2=Schmidt, Joseph |author3=Shultz, Jonas|title=Refining the relationship between personality and Subjective well-being|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=2008|volume=134|pages=138–161|url=http://www.subjectpool.com/ed_teach/y4person/3_happiness/Steel2008_5FM_and_happiness_psych_bull.pdf|doi= 10.1037/0033-2909.134.1.138|pmid= 18193998|issue= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that health and SWB may mutually influence each other, as good health tends to be associated with greater happiness,&lt;ref name=Okunmeta-analysis/&gt; and a number of studies have found that positive emotions and [[optimism]] can have a beneficial influence on health.&lt;ref name=Dienerhealth/&gt;

==Construction of SWB==
[[Ed Diener|Diener]] et al.  argued that the various components of SWB represent distinct constructs that need to be understood separately, even though they are closely related. Hence, SWB may be considered "a general area of scientific interest rather than a single specific construct".&lt;ref name=Diener1999/&gt; Due to the specific focus on the ''subjective'' aspects of well-being, definitions of SWB typically exclude ''objective'' conditions such as material conditions or [[health]], although these can influence ratings of SWB.&lt;ref name=Diener1984/&gt; Definitions of SWB therefore focus on how a person evaluates his/her own life, including emotional experiences of [[pleasure]] versus [[suffering|pain]] in response to specific events and cognitive evaluations of what a person considers a [[Eudaimonia|good life]].&lt;ref name=Diener2000/&gt; Components of SWB relating to [[Affect (psychology)|affect]] include positive affect (experiencing pleasant emotions and moods) and low negative affect (experiencing unpleasant, distressing emotions and moods), as well as "overall affect" or "[[valence (psychology)|hedonic]] balance", defined as the overall equilibrium  between positive and negative affect, and usually measured as the difference between the two.&lt;ref name=Steel/&gt;  High positive affect and low negative affect are often highly correlated, but not always.&lt;ref name=Diener2000/&gt;

==Components of SWB==
There are two components of SWB. One is [[affect (psychology)|Affective Balance]] and the other is Life Satisfaction. An individual's scores on the two measures are summed to produce a total SWB score. In some cases, these scores are kept separate.&lt;ref name="Diener &amp; Biswas-Diener" /&gt;
* Affective balance
Affective balance refers to the emotions, moods, and feelings a person has. These can be all positive, all negative, or a combination of both positive and negative.&lt;ref name="Diener &amp; Biswas-Diener" /&gt; Some research shows also that feelings of reward are separate from positive and negative affect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = White | first1 = M | last2 = Dolan | first2 = P | year = 2009 | title = Accounting for the richness of our daily activities | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2009.02392.x | pmid = 19549079 | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 20 | issue = 8| pages = 1000–1008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Life satisfaction
[[Life satisfaction]] (global judgments of one's life) and satisfaction with specific life domains (e.g. work satisfaction) are considered cognitive components of SWB.&lt;ref name=Diener2000/&gt; The term "[[happiness]]" is also commonly used in regards to SWB and has been defined variously as "satisfaction of desires and goals" (therefore related to life satisfaction), as a "preponderance of positive over negative affect" (therefore related to emotional components of SWB),&lt;ref name=Diener1984/&gt; as "contentment",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graham|first1=Michael C.|title=Facts of Life: ten issues of contentment|date=2014|publisher=Outskirts Press|isbn=978-1-4787-2259-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a "consistent, [[optimistic]] mood state"&lt;ref name=Steel/&gt; and may imply an affective evaluation of one's life as a whole.&lt;ref name=deneve&amp;cooper&gt;{{cite journal|last=DeNeve|first=Kristina M.|author2=Cooper, Harris |title=The Happy Personality: A Meta-Analysis of 137 Personality Traits and Subjective Well-Being|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=1998|volume=124|pages=197–229|url=http://www.subjectpool.com/ed_teach/y5_ID/personality/wellbeing/1998_Deneve_cooper_psych_bull.pdf|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.124.2.197|pmid=9747186|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Life satisfaction can also be known as the "stable" component in one's life.&lt;ref name=Diener1984/&gt;  Affective concepts of SWB can be considered in terms of momentary emotional states as well as in terms of longer-term moods and tendencies (i.e. how much positive and/or negative affect a person generally experiences over any given period of time).&lt;ref name=Diener1999/&gt; Life satisfaction and in some research happiness are typically considered over long durations, up to one's lifetime.&lt;ref name=Steel/&gt; "[[Quality of life]]" has also been studied as a conceptualization of SWB. Although its exact definition varies, it is usually measured as an aggregation of well-being across several life domains and may include both subjective and objective components.&lt;ref name=Steel/&gt;

===Measurement of SWB components===

Life satisfaction and Affect balance are generally measured separately and independently.&lt;ref name=Albuquerque /&gt;  
* Life satisfaction is generally measured using a self-report method. A common measurement for life satisfaction is questionnaires. 
* Affective balance is also generally measured using a self-report method. An example of a measurement of affective balance is the [[Positive and Negative Affect Schedule|PANAS]] (Positive Affect Negative Affect Schedule).&lt;ref name=Albuquerque /&gt;  
Sometimes a single SWB question attempts to capture an overall picture.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. "''The most basic way of measuring it involves asking individuals how they feel about their lives - known as subjective well being. A typical question is, "Taking all things together, how happy are you?" - with possible answers from 0 (extremely unhappy) to 10 (extremely happy).''" Can Happiness be Measured?, http://www.actionforhappiness.org/why-happiness&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue with the such measurements of life satisfaction and affective balance is that they are self-reports. The problem with self-reports is that the participants may be lying or at least not telling the whole truth on the questionnaires. Participants may be lying or holding back from revealing certain things because they are either embarrassed or they may be filling in what they believe the researcher wants to see in the results. To gain more accurate results, other methods of measurement have been used to determine one’s SWB. 

Another way to corroborate or confirm that the self-report results are accurate is through informant reports.&lt;ref name=Albuquerque /&gt;  Informant reports are given to the participant’s closest friends and family and they are asked to fill out either a survey or a form asking about the participants mood, emotions, and overall lifestyle. The participant may write in the self-report that they are very happy, however that participant’s friends and family record that he/she is always depressed. This would obviously be a contradiction in results which would ultimately lead to inaccurate results. 

Another method of gaining a better understanding of the true results is through ESM, or the Experience Sampling Method.&lt;ref name=Albuquerque /&gt;  In this measure, participants are given a beeper/pager that will randomly ring throughout the day. Whenever the beeper/pager sounds, the participant will stop what he/she is doing and record the activity they are currently engaged in and their current mood and feelings. Tracking this over a period of a week or a month will give researchers a better understanding of the true emotions, moods, and feelings the participant is experiencing, and how these factors interact with other thoughts and behaviors.&lt;ref name= HGIN&gt;{{cite journal |author1=van der Krieke et al., L. | year = 2015 | title = HowNutsAreTheDutch (HoeGekIsNL): A crowdsourcing study of mental symptoms and strengths | journal = International Journal of Methods in Psychiatric Research | volume = 25| issue = 2| pages = 123–44| doi=10.1002/mpr.1495 | pmid=26395198}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third measurement to ensure validity is the Day Reconstruction Method.&lt;ref name=Albuquerque /&gt;  In this measure, participants fill out a diary of the previous days’ activities. The participant is then asked to describe each activity and provide a report of how they were feeling, what mood they were experiencing, and any emotions that surfaced. Thus to ensure valid results, a researcher may tend to use self-reports along with another form of measurement mentioned above. Someone with a high level of life satisfaction and a positive affective balance is said to have a high level of SWB.&lt;ref name=Albuquerque /&gt;

==Theories==
Theories of the causes of SWB tend to emphasise either top-down or bottom-up influences.&lt;ref name="Diener1984"/&gt;

===Top-down perspective===

In the top-down view, global features of personality influence the way a person perceives events. Individuals may therefore have a global tendency to perceive life in a consistently positive or negative manner, depending on their stable personality traits.&lt;ref name=deneve1999&gt;{{cite journal|last=DeNeve|first=Kristina M. |title=Happy as an Extraverted Clam? The Role of Personality for Subjective Well-Being

Set Point theory implies that a person's baseline or equilibrium level of SWB is a consequence of hereditary characteristics and therefore, almost entirely predetermined at birth.&lt;ref name="Happiness Is a Stochastic Phenomenon"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lykken|author2=Tellegen |title=Happiness Is a Stochastic Phenomenon|journal=Psychological Science|year=1996|volume=7|issue=3|doi= 10.1111/j.1467-9280.1996.tb00355.x |url=http://www.theiahe.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Happiness-is-a-Stochastic-Phenomenon.-by-David-Lykken-and-Auke-Tellegen.-APS.-May-1996.pdf|first1=David|pages=186–189 |citeseerx=10.1.1.613.4004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Evidence for this genetic predisposition derives from behavior-genetic studies that have found that positive and negative affectivity each have high [[heritability]] (40% and 55% respectively in one study).&lt;ref name=Diener1999/&gt; Numerous twin studies confirm the notion of set point theory, however, they do not rule out the possibility that is it possible for individuals to experience long term changes in SWB.&lt;ref name="Happiness Is a Stochastic Phenomenon"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first = Matt |last=McGue |author2=Bacon, Steve |author3=Lykken, David|title=Personality stability and change in early adulthood: A behavioral genetic analysis|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=1993|volume=29|issue=1|pages=96–109 |url =  http://psych.colorado.edu/~carey/pdfFiles/Personality_McGue01.pdf|doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.29.1.96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diener et al. note that heritability studies are limited in that they describe long-term SWB in a sample of people in a modern [[western society]] but may not be applicable to more extreme environments that might influence SWB and do not provide absolute indicators of genetic effects. Additionally, heritability estimates are inconsistent across studies.

Further evidence for a genetically influenced predisposition to SWB comes from findings that personality has a large influence on long-term SWB. This has led to the ''dynamic equilibrium model'' of SWB. This model proposes that personality provides a baseline for emotional responses. External events may move people away from the baseline, sometimes dramatically, but these movements tend to be of limited duration, with most people returning to their baseline eventually.&lt;ref name=Diener1999/&gt;

===Bottom-up perspective===

From a bottom-up perspective, happiness represents an accumulation of happy experiences. Bottom-up influences include external events, and broad situational and demographic factors, including health and marital status. Bottom-up approaches are based on the idea that there are universal [[basic human needs]] and that happiness results from their fulfilment. In support of this view, there is evidence that daily pleasurable events are associated with increased positive affect, and daily unpleasant events or hassles are associated with increased negative affect.

However, research suggests that external events account for a much smaller proportion of the variance in self-reports of SWB than top-down factors, such as personality.&lt;ref name=Diener1999/&gt; A theory proposed to explain the limited impact of external events on SWB is hedonic adaptation.&lt;ref name=Diener2000/&gt; Based originally on the concept of a "[[hedonic treadmill]]", this theory proposes that positive or negative external events temporarily increase or decrease feelings of SWB, but as time passes people tend to become habituated to their circumstances and have a tendency to return to a personal SWB "setpoint" or baseline level.

The hedonic treadmill theory originally proposed that most people return to a neutral level of SWB (i.e. neither happy nor unhappy) as they habituate to events. However, subsequent research has shown that for most people, the baseline level of SWB is at least mildly positive, as most people tend to report being at least somewhat happy in general and tend to experience positive mood when no adverse events are occurring. Additional refinements to this theory have shown that people do not adapt to all life events equally, as people tend to adapt rapidly to some events (e.g. imprisonment), slowly to others (e.g. the death of a loved one), and not at all to others (e.g. noise and sex).&lt;ref name=Diener2000/&gt;

==Factors affecting SWB==

===Personality and genetics===
A number of studies have found that SWB constructs are strongly associated with a range of personality traits, including those in the [[five factor model]].&lt;ref name=Steel/&gt; Findings from numerous personality studies show that genetics account for 20-48% of the variance in Five-Factor Model and the variance in subjective well-being is also heritable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Bouchard | first = Thomas J., Jr. |author2=Loehlin, J.C.  | year = 2001 | title = Genes, evolution, and personality | journal = Behavior Genetics | volume = 31 | pages = 243–273 | doi =  10.1023/A:1012294324713 | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/qt0138g23w8720j1/ | issue = 3 | pmid = 11699599}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, [[neuroticism]] predicts poorer subjective well-being whilst [[extraversion]], [[agreeableness]], [[conscientiousness]] and [[openness to experience]] tend to predict higher subjective well-being. A [[meta-analysis]] found that neuroticism, extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness were significantly related to all facets of SWB examined (positive, negative, and overall affect; happiness; life satisfaction; and quality of life). Neuroticism was the strongest predictor of overall SWB and is the strongest predictor of negative affect.&lt;ref name=Steel/&gt;

A large number of personality traits are related to SWB constructs, although [[intelligence]] has negligible relationships.&lt;ref name=deneve&amp;cooper/&gt; Positive affect is most strongly predicted by extraversion, to a lesser extent agreeableness, and more weakly by openness to experience. Happiness was most strongly predicted by extraversion, and also strongly predicted by neuroticism, and to a lesser extent by the other three factors. Life satisfaction was significantly predicted by neuroticism, extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. Quality of life was very strongly predicted by neuroticism, and also strongly predicted by extraversion and conscientiousness, and to a modest extent by agreeableness and openness to experience.&lt;ref name=Steel/&gt;   One study found that subjective well-being was genetically indistinct from personality traits, especially those that reflected emotional stability (low Neuroticism), and social and physical activity (high Extraversion), and constraint (high Conscientiousness).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Weiss | first = A. |author2=Bates, T.

DeNeve (1999) argued that there are three trends in the relationship between personality and SWB. Firstly, SWB is closely tied to traits associated with emotional tendencies ([[neuroticism#Emotional stability|emotional stability]], positive affectivity, and tension). Secondly, relationship enhancing traits (e.g. [[trust (social sciences)|trust]], affiliation) are important for subjective well-being. Happy people tend to have strong relationships and be good at fostering them. Thirdly, the way people think about and explain events is important for subjective well-being. Appraising events in an [[optimistic]] fashion, having a sense of control, and making active coping efforts facilitates subjective well-being. Trust, a trait substantially related to SWB, as opposed to cynicism involves making positive rather than negative attributions about others. Making positive, optimistic attributions rather than negative pessimistic ones facilitates subjective well-being.&lt;ref name=deneve1999/&gt;

The related trait of [[eudaimonia]] or [[psychological well-being]], is also heritable. Evidence from one study supports 5 independent genetic mechanisms underlying the Ryff facets of psychological well-being, leading to a genetic construct of eudaimonia in terms of general [[self-control]], and four subsidiary biological mechanisms enabling the psychological capabilities of purpose, agency, growth, and positive social relations&lt;ref name=Archontaki2012&gt;D.

===Social influences===
{{expand section|date=December 2012}}
A person's level of subjective well-being is determined by many different factors and social influences prove to be a strong one. Results from the famous [[Framingham Heart Study]] indicate that friends three [[degrees of separation]] away (that is, friends of friends of friends) can affect a person's happiness. From abstract: "A friend who lives within a mile (about 1.6 km) and who becomes happy increases the probability that a person is happy by 25%."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fowler|first=J. H|author2=Christakis, N.

===Wealth===
Research indicates that wealth is related to many positive outcomes in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Furnham &amp; Argyle|title=The psychology of money|year=1998|publisher=Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such outcomes include: improved health and mental health,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Langner &amp; Michael|title=Life stress and mental health: The Midtown Manhattan study|year=1963|publisher=Free Press of Glencoe  (New York)}}&lt;/ref&gt; greater longevity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilkinson|title=Unhealthy societies: the afflictions of inequality|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; lower rates of infant mortality,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith |author2=Eikeseth |author3=Klevstrand |author4=Lovaas |title=Intensive behavioral treatment for preschoolers with severe mental retardation and pervasive developmental disorder|journal=American Journal on Mental Retardation|year=1997|volume=102|issue=3|pages=238–249|doi=10.1352/0895-8017(1997)102&lt;0238:IBTFPW&gt;2.0.CO;2|pmid=9394133|first1=T}}&lt;/ref&gt; experience fewer stressful life events,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilson | first1 = RM | last2 = Runciman | first2 = WB | last3 = Gibberd | first3 = RW | last4 = Harrison | first4 = BT | last5 = Newby | first5 = L | last6 = Hamilton | first6 = JD.  | year = 1995 | title = The quality in Australian health care study | url = | journal = Med J Aust | volume = 163 | issue = | pages = 458–471 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and less frequently the victims of violent crimes&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, J.

New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; However, research suggests that wealth has a smaller impact on SWB than people generally think, even though higher incomes do correlate substantially with life satisfaction reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aknin|author2=Norton, Dunn |title=From wealth to well-being? Money matters, but less than people think|journal=The Journal of Positive Psychology|year=2009|volume=4|issue=6|pages=523–527|doi=10.1080/17439760903271421|first1=Lara B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relative influence of [[wealth]] together with other material components on overall subjective [[well-being]] of a person is being studied through new researches. The Well-being Project at Human Science Lab investigates how material [[well-being]] and [[perceptual]] well-being works as relative determinants in conditioning our [[mind]] for positive [[emotion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://humansciencelab.org.uk| title=Understanding Positive Emotions |publisher=Human Science Lab | access-date=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study done by Aknin, Norton, &amp; Dunn (2009), researchers asked participants from across the income spectrum to report their own happiness and to predict the happiness of others and themselves at different income levels.  In study 1, predicted happiness ranged between 2.4-7.9 and actual happiness ranged between 5.2-7.7.  In study 2, predicted happiness ranged between 15-80 and actual happiness ranged between 50-80.  These findings show that people believe that money does more for happiness than it really does.&lt;ref&gt;Norton, M.I., Dunn, E.W., &amp; *Aknin, L.B. (2009). From wealth to well-being: Spending money on others promotes happiness. Invited talk at the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Tampa, FL&lt;/ref&gt; However, some research indicates that while [[socioeconomic]] measures of status do not correspond to greater happiness, measures of [[sociometric status]] (status compared to people encountered face-to-face on a daily basis) do correlate to increased subjective well-being, above and beyond the effects of extroversion and other factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=C.|author2=Kraus, M. W. |author3=Galinsky, A. D. |author4= Keltner, D. |title=The Local-Ladder Effect: Social Status and Subjective Well-Being|journal=Psychological Science|date=31 May 2012|volume=23|issue=7|pages=764–771|doi=10.1177/0956797611434537 |pmid=22653798}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Easterlin Paradox also suggests that there is no connection between a society's [[economic]] development and its average level of [[happiness]].   Through time, the Easterlin has looked at the relationship between [[happiness]] and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) across countries and within countries.  There are three different phenomena to look at when examining the connection between money and Subjective well-being; rising GDP within a country, relative income within a country, and differences in GDP between countries.&lt;ref&gt;Easterlin,  Richard  A.,  1973,  Does  Money  Buy  Happiness?  The  Public  Interest,  30  (Winter),  3-10&lt;/ref&gt;

More specifically, when making comparisons between countries, a principle called the Diminishing Marginal Utility of Income (DMUI) stands strong.  Veenhoven (1991) said, "[W]e not only see a clear positive relationship [between happiness and GNP per capita], but also a curvilinear pattern; which suggest that wealth is subject to a law of diminishing happiness returns."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Veenhoven | first1 = Ruut | year = 1991 | title = Is Happiness Relative? | url = http://repub.eur.nl/pub/16148| journal = Social Indicators Research | volume = 24 | issue = 1| pages = 1–34 | doi=10.1007/bf00292648| format = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Meaning a $1,000 increase in real income, becomes progressively smaller the higher the initial level of income, having less of an impact on subjective well-being. Easterlin (1995) proved that the DMUI is true when comparing countries, but not when looking at rising gross domestic product within countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Easterlin | first1 = Richard A. | year = 1995 | title = Will Raising the Incomes of All Increase the Happiness of All? | url = | journal = Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization | volume = 27 | issue = 1| pages = 35–48 | doi=10.1016/0167-2681(95)00003-b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health===
There are substantial positive associations between [[health]] and SWB so that people who rate their general health as "good" or "excellent" tend to experience better SWB compared to those who rate their health as "fair" or "poor". A meta-analysis found that self-ratings of general health were more strongly related to SWB than physician ratings of health.&lt;ref name=Okunmeta-analysis&gt;

A review of longitudinal studies found&lt;ref name="Diener &amp; Biswas-Diener" /&gt; that measures of baseline subjective well-being constructs such as [[optimism]] and positive affect predicted longer-term health status and mortality. Conversely, a number of studies found that baseline [[depression (mood)|depression]] predicted poorer longer-term health status and mortality. Baseline health may well have a causal influence on subjective well-being so causality is difficult to establish.
A number of studies found that positive emotions and optimism had a beneficial impact on cardiovascular health and on immune functioning. Changes in mood are also known to be associated with changes in immune and cardiovascular response.
There is evidence that interventions that are successful in improving subjective well-being can have beneficial effects on aspects of health. For example, [[meditation]] and [[relaxation training]] have been found to increase positive affect and to reduce blood pressure. The effect of specific types of subjective well-being is not entirely clear. For example, how durable the effects of mood and emotions on health are  remains unclear. Whether some types of subjective well-being predict health independently of others is also unclear.&lt;ref name=Dienerhealth/&gt; Meditation has the power to increase happiness because it can improve self-confidence and reduces anxiety, which increases your well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Howard|title=The Pursuit of Happiness|year=1953|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultivating personal strengths and resources, like humour, social/animal company, and daily occupations, also appears to help people preserve acceptable levels of SWB despite the presence of symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress.&lt;ref name="BosPrSWB" /&gt;

Research suggests that probing a patient's happiness is one of the most important things a doctor can do to predict that patient's health and longevity.&lt;ref name="Diener &amp; Biswas-Diener" /&gt;  In health-conscious modern societies, most people overlook the emotions as a vital component of one's health, while over focusing on diet and exercise. According to Diener &amp; Biswas-Diener, people who are happy become less sick than people who are unhappy. There are three types of health: morbidity, survival, and longevity.&lt;ref name="Diener &amp; Biswas-Diener" /&gt;  Evidence suggests that all three can be improved through happiness:

# Morbidity, simply put, is whether or not someone develops a serious illness, such as the flu or cancer.&lt;ref name="Diener &amp; Biswas-Diener" /&gt;  In a 30-year longitudinal study, participants who were high in positive emotions were found to have lower rates of many health problems. Some of these illnesses/problems include lower death rates from heart disease, suicide, accidents, homicides, mental illnesses, drug dependency, and liver disease related to alcoholism.  Additionally, results showed that depressed participants were more likely to have heart attacks and recurrences of heart attacks when compared to happy people.
# Survival is the term used for what happens to a person after he/she has already developed or contracted a serious illness.&lt;ref name="Diener &amp; Biswas-Diener" /&gt;  Although happiness has been shown to increase health, with survival, this may not be the case. Survival may be the only area of health that evidence suggests happiness may actually be sometimes detrimental. It is unclear why exactly research results suggest this is the case, however Diener &amp; Biswas-Diener offer an explanation. It is possible that happy people fail to report symptoms of the illness, which can ultimately lead to no treatment or inadequate treatment. Another possible reason may be that happy people tend to be optimistic, leading them to take their symptoms too lightly, seek treatment too late, and/or follow the doctor’s instructions half-heartedly. And lastly, Diener &amp; Biswas-Diener suggest that people with serious illnesses may be more likely to choose to live out the rest of their days without painful or invasive treatments.&lt;ref name="Diener &amp; Biswas-Diener" /&gt;
# Longevity, the third area of health, is measured by an individual's age of death.&lt;ref name="Diener &amp; Biswas-Diener" /&gt;  Head researcher Deborah Danner of the University of Kentucky researched links between an individual's happiness and that individual's longevity. Danner recruited 180 Catholic nuns from a nearby convent as the participants of her study. She chose nuns because they live very similar lives. This eliminates many confounding variables that might be present in other samples, which can lead to inaccurate results. Such confounding variables could include drug use, alcohol abuse, diet, and sexual risk-taking. Since there are few differences among the nuns as far as the confounding variables, this sample offered the best option to match a controlled laboratory setting. Results showed that nuns who were considered{{by whom|date=September 2014}} happy or positive in their manner and language on average lived 10 years longer than the nuns who were considered unhappy or negative in their manner and language. A follow-up study by health researcher Sarah Pressman examined 96 famous psychologists to determine if similar results from the nun research would be seen as well. Pressman's results showed that the positive or happy psychologists lived, on average, 6 years longer. The psychologists who were considered{{by whom|date=September 2014}} negative or unhappy lived, on average, 5 years less.&lt;ref name="Diener &amp; Biswas-Diener" /&gt;

===Physical characteristics===
A positive relationship has been found between the volume of gray matter in the right [[precuneus]] area of the brain, and the subject's subjective happiness score.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=http://www.nature.com/articles/srep16891 | doi=10.1038/srep16891| pmid=26586449| pmc=4653620| title=The structural neural substrate of subjective happiness| journal=Scientific Reports| volume=5| pages=16891| year=2015| last1=Sato| first1=Wataru| last2=Kochiyama| first2=Takanori| last3=Uono| first3=Shota| last4=Kubota| first4=Yasutaka| last5=Sawada| first5=Reiko| last6=Yoshimura| first6=Sayaka| last7=Toichi| first7=Motomi}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 6 week [[mindfulness]] based intervention was found to correlate with a significant gray matter increase within the precuneus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 4306280 | pmid=25632405 | doi=10.17140/NOJ-1-106 | volume=1 | issue=1 | title=Brain Gray Matter Changes Associated with Mindfulness Meditation in Older Adults: An Exploratory Pilot Study using Voxel-based Morphometry | year=2014 | journal=Neuro | pages=23–26 | last1 = Kurth | first1 = F | last2 = Luders | first2 = E | last3 = Wu | first3 = B | last4 = Black | first4 = DS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leisure===
There are a number of domains that are thought to contribute to subjective well-being. In a study by Hribernik and Mussap (2010), leisure satisfaction was found to predict unique variance in life satisfaction, supporting its inclusion as a distinct life domain contributing to subjective well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hribernik | first1 = J. | last2 = Mussap | first2 = A. J. | year = 2010 | title = Research note: Leisure satisfaction and subjective well-being | url = | journal = Annals of Leisure Research | volume = 13 | issue = 4| pages = 701–708 | doi=10.1080/11745398.2010.9686871}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, relationship status interacted with age group and gender on differences in leisure satisfaction. The relationship between leisure satisfaction and life satisfaction, however, was reduced when considering the impact of core affect (underlying mood state). This suggests that leisure satisfaction may primarily be influenced by an individual's subjective well-being level as represented by core affect. This has implications for possible limitations in the extent to which leisure satisfaction may be improved beyond pre-existing levels of well-being and mood in individuals.

===Cultural variations===

Although all cultures seem to value happiness, cultures vary in how they define happiness. There is also evidence that people in more individualistic cultures tend to rate themselves as higher in subjective well-being compared to people in more collectivistic cultures.&lt;ref name=science&gt;
{{cite book

| chapter = Comparing subjective well-being across cultures and nations: the "what" and "why" questions}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Western culture]]s, predictors of happiness include elements that support personal independence, a sense of personal agency, and self-expression. In [[Eastern culture]]s, predictors of happiness focus on an interdependent self that is inseparable from significant others. Compared to people in individualistic cultures, people in collectivistic cultures are more likely to base their judgments of life satisfaction on how significant others appraise their life than on the balance of inner emotions experienced as pleasant versus unpleasant. Pleasant emotional experiences have a stronger social component in East Asian cultures compared to Western ones. For example, people in Japan are more likely to associate happiness with interpersonally engaging emotions (such as friendly feelings), whereas people in the United States are more likely to associate happiness with interpersonally disengaging emotions (pride, for example).&lt;ref name=science/&gt; There are also cultural differences in motives and goals associated with happiness. For example, Asian Americans tend to experience greater happiness after achieving goals that are pleasing to or approved of by significant others compared to European Americans. There is also evidence that high self-esteem, a sense of personal control and a consistent sense of identity relate more strongly to SWB in Western cultures than they do in Eastern ones. However, this is not to say that these things are unimportant to SWB in Eastern cultures. Research has found that even within Eastern cultures, people with high self-esteem and a more consistent sense of identity are somewhat happier than those who are low in these characteristics. There is no evidence that low self-esteem and so on{{vague|date=September 2014}} are actually beneficial to SWB in any known culture.&lt;ref name=science/&gt;

A large body of research evidence has confirmed that people in individualistic societies report higher levels of happiness than people in collectivistic ones and that socioeconomic factors alone are insufficient to explain this difference.&lt;ref name=science/&gt; In addition to political and economic differences, individualistic versus collectivistic nations reliably differ in a variety of psychological characteristics that are related to SWB, such as emotion norms and attitudes to the expression of individual needs. Collectivistic cultures are based around the belief that the individual exists for the benefit of the larger social unit, whereas more individualistic cultures assume the opposite. Collectivistic cultures emphasise maintaining social order and harmony and therefore expect members to suppress their personal desires when necessary in order to promote collective interests. Such cultures therefore consider self-regulation more important than self-expression or than individual rights. Individualistic cultures by contrast emphasise the inalienable value of each person and expect individuals to become self-directive and self-sufficient. Although people in collectivistic cultures may gain happiness from the social approval they receive from suppressing self-interest, research seems to suggest that self-expression produces a greater happiness "payoff" compared to seeking approval outside oneself.&lt;ref name=science/&gt;

P.|citeseerx=10.1.1.183.6660 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers in positive psychology have pointed out that in almost every [[culture]] studied the pursuit of happiness is regarded as one of the most valued goals in life. Understanding [[individual differences psychology|individual differences]] in SWB is of key interest in positive psychology, particularly the issue of why some people are happier than others. Some people continue to be happy in the face of adversity whereas others are chronically unhappy at the best of times.&lt;ref name=BosPrSWB&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bos, E.H.|author2=Snippe, E.|author3=de Jonge, P.|author4=Jeronimus, B.F.| year = 2016 | title = Preserving Subjective Wellbeing in the Face of Psychopathology: Buffering Effects of Personal Strengths and Resources | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 11| issue = 3| pages = e0150867| doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0150867 | pmid=26963923|pmc=4786317}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Positive psychology has investigated how people might improve their level of SWB and maintain these improvements over the longer term, rather than returning to baseline.&lt;ref name="Sonja"/&gt; [[Sonja Lyubomirsky|Lyubomirsky]] (2001) argued that SWB is influenced by a combination of personality/genetics (studies have found that genetic influences usually account for 35-50% of the variance in happiness measures), external circumstances, and activities that affect SWB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Røysamb | first1 = E. | last2 = Harris | first2 = J. | last3 = Magnus | first3 = P. | last4 = Vittersø | first4 = J. | last5 = Tambs | first5 = K. | year = 2002 | title = Subjective well-being.

'''The Health Lottery''' is a [[lottery]] that operates on behalf of 12 local society lotteries across Great Britain. It was launched in October 2011 and runs 5 weekly draws on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays. Each week a different [[Community Interest Company]] raises the funds for their respective area, with 20% of ticket sales being awarded to local health-related causes. It is operated by [[Northern and Shell]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15070628 Media group launches commercial lottery]&lt;/ref&gt;.

== History ==
The origins of the Health Lottery predate the [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]], to the failed [[National Health Service Lottery]] which had an abortive launch in 1988, before being declared illegal. The assets of the NHS Lottery were purchased in 2007 by Altala Group Ltd, a company run by Ian Milligan, a former employee of [[Camelot Group]], the operators of the UK National Lottery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bridge Business Recovery appointed to find buyer for The Health Lottery|url=http://businessmoneynews.net/index.asp?ItemID=260&amp;pcid=69&amp;cid=75&amp;archive=yes|work=Business Money News}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Altala went into administration in 2009, shortly before it was due to be granted its gambling licence, and was purchased by Health Lottery Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Buyer Found for Health Lottery|url=http://www.ccrmagazine.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2517|work=CCR Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; After winning the licence, the Health Lottery was sold in February 2011 to [[Richard Desmond]]'s [[Northern &amp; Shell]] group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Richard Desmond unveils the Health Lottery|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/feb/28/richard-desmond-health-lottery|work=The Guardian | location=London|first=Josh|last=Halliday|date=28 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Health Lottery launched in September 2011.

==Broadcasting==
From launch, draws for the Health Lottery were broadcast live on the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network during an advertisement break of ''[[The X Factor (UK)|The X Factor]]'', paid for by [[Northern &amp; Shell|Northern and Shell]], and shortly after on [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]]. Draws are currently broadcast at around 9.55pm on [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.channel5.com/shows/the-health-lottery-draw/articles/health-lottery-results-on-channel-5|title = Watch The Health Lottery Draw on Channel 5|date = |accessdate = 2014-05-28|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially planned to be hosted by [[Eamonn Holmes]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketingmagazine.co.uk/news/rss/1093269/Health-Lottery-kick-off-next-week-screened-5/ Health Lottery to kick off next week and be screened on 5]&lt;/ref&gt; but as Holmes was employed by [[Sky News]], he was dropped due to a possible conflict of interest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forums.digitalspy.co.uk/showthread.php?p=53300972 Eamonn Holmes Quits Health Lottery]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Melinda Messenger]] was confirmed as the host on 5 October 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/view/214336/Melinda-Messenger-to-host-telly-health-Lotto-draw/ Melinda Messenger to Host Telly Health Lotto Draw]&lt;/ref&gt;

To celebrate the first anniversary of the Health Lottery, a new Wednesday night draw called "Win Wednesday" was launched.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldlottery.net/news/health-lottery-launch-wednesday-draw.asp Wednesday Night Health Lottery Launches]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 August 2015, it was announced that the Health Lottery would be extended to five nights a week, with previous National Lottery presenter [[Anthea Turner]] taking over as host of the new-look draws from 13 August.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/596380/Health-Lottery-Anthea-turner Everyone's a winner says Anthea Turner, the new face of the Health Lottery]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
{{Update section|date=February 2017}}
The game has been criticised for donating only 20.3% of the ticket price to causes, compared with 28% donated by the National Lottery. Spokespersons for The Health Lottery argue that the game will grow the market.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/sep/27/richard-desmond-health-lottery-charity?CMP=twt_fd/ Guardian 27/9/2011, Richard Desmond's health lottery branded a 'disgrace']&lt;/ref&gt; Some attention was also given to the possibility that favourable coverage of the lottery in Desmond's ''[[Daily Express]]'' and the ''[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]'' amounted to disguised advertising,&lt;ref&gt;[http://fullfact.org/blog/daily_express_northern_shell_health_lotter_advertising_standards_authority-3007/ Full Fact 29/09/2011, Will the ASA take the Express to task over Health Lottery coverage?]&lt;/ref&gt; which was reported to the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]], who found the issue to be outside their remit.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asa.org.uk/ASA-action/Adjudications/2012/4/The-Health-Lottery-Ltd/SHP_ADJ_173270.aspx ASA Adjudication on The Health Lottery&lt;/ref&gt; The Culture Secretary [[Jeremy Hunt (politician)|Jeremy Hunt]] announced in October 2011 that the [[Gambling Commission]] would investigate the legality of the Health Lottery, after questions were raised about the way the lottery was being run and the cost to smaller lotteries nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/oct/27/richard-desmond-health-lottery-scrutinised/ Guardian 27/10/2011 Richard Desmond's Health Lottery under scrutiny by watchdog]&lt;/ref&gt;

Camelot Group attempted to take high court legal action to have The Health Lottery’s gambling licence revoked in 2012, claiming that they had not received adequate protection from The Gambling Commission. Camelot lost the case, a verdict described by Richard Desmond as “a complete vindication of all the hard work that has gone into launching The Health Lottery…if Camelot had succeeded in this case, they would have shut down lifeline funding to hundreds of health projects and charities.  The charity sector would have lost out badly."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/aug/22/camelot-richard-desmond-health-lottery&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
To circumvent the requirements of the [[Gambling Act 2005|Gambling Act]], the Health Lottery is not structured as a national lottery, but rather as 12 different society lotteries, each one representing at least one [[local authority]] area within England, Scotland and Wales&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Health Lottery - Terms and Conditions|url=https://www.healthlottery.co.uk/terms}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Each society lottery is licensed by the [[Gambling Commission]] and operates as an individual [[Community Interest Company]], or CIC. Different CICs take turns in participating in a weekly draw so each week different CICs are represented and every region gets a share of the pot. Money is then donated to support health-related causes within their respective local areas. The Health Lottery ELM Ltd operates as an external lottery manager to oversee the society lotteries. The ELM charges a management fee of 0.5p in every pound, which provides the profit for the lottery owners. The allocation of funds to causes raised by the Health Lottery is determined by the relevant CICs and their partner charity, the People’s Health Trust, and not by The Health Lottery ELM Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Health Lottery - Terms and Conditions|url=https://www.healthlottery.co.uk/terms}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 this complicated structure was judged by the [[Gambling Commission]] regulatory panel to be "close to the line in respect of section 99 of the [Gambling] Act" and that while the structure was "capable of being compliant with the Act" it was "finely balanced". Concern was expressed that the individual lotteries were not to be combined into one de facto national lottery, as to do so would be a breach of the Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/90142/response/228239/attach/html/4/Health%20Lottery%20decision%20sheet.pdf.html|title=Decision of the Gambling Commission Regulatory Panel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Natural History of Alcoholism Revisited''''' (1995) is a book by [[psychiatrist]] [[George Eman Vaillant|George E. Vaillant]] that describes two multi-decade studies of the lives of 600 American males, non-alcoholics at the outset, focusing on their lifelong drinking behaviours. By following the men from youth to old age it was possible to chart their drinking patterns and what factors may have contributed to [[alcoholism]]. Another study followed 100 severe alcoholics from a clinic eight years after their [[Alcohol detoxification|detoxification]]. ''The National Review'' hailed the first edition (1983) as "a genuine revolution in the field of alcoholism research" and said that "Vaillant has combined clinical experience with an unprecedented amount of empirical data to produce what may ultimately come to be viewed as the single most important contribution to the literature of alcoholism since the first edition of [[Alcoholics Anonymous|AA]]'s [[AA Big Book|Big Book]]."&lt;ref&gt;Teachout, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the main conclusions of Vaillant’s book are:
* That alcoholism is as much a social as a medical condition. "Alcoholism can simultaneously reflect both a [[Classical conditioning|conditioned habit]] and a [[disease]]."&lt;ref&gt;Vaillant 1995, p 376.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Factors predicting alcoholism were related to ethnic culture, alcoholism in relatives, and a personality that is [[Antisocial personality disorder|antisocial]] and [[Extraversion vs Introversion|extroverted]]. An unhappy childhood predicted mental illness but not alcoholism—unless the family problems were ''due'' to alcoholism.
* That alcoholism was generally the ''cause'' of co-occurring [[Clinical depression|depression]], [[anxiety]], and [[Psychopathy|sociopathic]] ([[:wikt:delinquent|delinquent]]) behaviour, not the result.
* That even though alcoholism is not solely a medical condition, it is therapeutically effective to explain it as a disease to patients. The disease concept encourages patients to take responsibility for their [[Drunkenness|drinking]], without debilitating guilt.
* That for most alcoholics, attempts at controlled drinking in the long term end in either abstinence or a return to alcoholism.
* That there is as yet no cure for alcoholism, and that medical treatment can only provide short-term crisis intervention.
* Achieving long-term sobriety usually involves (1) a less harmful, substitute dependency; (2) new relationships; (3) sources of inspiration and hope; and (4) experiencing negative consequences of drinking.&lt;ref&gt;Vaillant 1995, p 241-244&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===Study Samples===
'''Core City''': In 1940, Sheldon and Eleanour Glueck of Harvard began a major study of [[juvenile delinquency]] in teens from Boston — mostly poor kids in tenements, half without a bathtub in their homes.&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin 1984&lt;/ref&gt; The control group for the study comprised 456 boys who were assessed as non-delinquent. In 1974 this control group, which Vaillant referred to as the Core City sample, was turned over to him to continue research. The Core City group had a mean IQ of 95, and 48% graduated from high school.

'''College''': In 1976 Vaillant inherited another study of more than 200 Harvard sophomores started in 1938—the College sample. The sophomores were white males, selected because they were high achievers and had no known medical or psychological problems. The College sample had a mean IQ of 130, and 76% attended graduate school. Their 1976 mean income was three times that of the Core City group.&lt;ref&gt;Vaillant 2003, p 1044.&lt;/ref&gt;

The research eventually showed that for the Core City sample at age 60, 36% had abused alcohol at some time in their lives; for the College sample at age 70, the figure was 22%.&lt;ref&gt;Vaillant 1995, p 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

The samples were narrow ("male, white, American, and born between 1919 and 1932."&lt;ref&gt;Vaillant 1995, p 317&lt;/ref&gt;) but were followed for a long period. As critics and Vaillant himself pointed out, the samples did not include important segments of the population such as African-Americans and women.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, 1884.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="genderbias"&gt;Note that in this article alcoholics will be referred to as male to reflect the bias of the samples.&lt;/ref&gt; Both samples likely excluded those who began abusing alcohol in early adolescence.&lt;ref&gt;Vaillant 1995, p 312&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Clinic''' sample was a group of 100 severe alcoholics who were detoxified at clinic in an urban, municipal hospital (Cambridge Hospital) in Massachusetts during the winter of 1971-1972.&lt;ref&gt;Vaillant 1995, p 188&lt;/ref&gt; The treatment was carried out under what was known as the CASPAR program—Cambridge-Somerville Program for Alcohol Rehabilitation. This group was followed for 8 years to measure the effectiveness of the treatment.

===Timeline===

*1921: mean birth date of College sample
*1929: mean birth date of Core City sample
*1938: study on the College sample begins at Harvard
*1940: Gluecks begin the Core City study
*1971-2: Clinic study begins
*1972-4: Vaillant takes over the College and Core City samples.
*1983: Vaillant publishes ''The Natural History of Alcoholism: causes, patterns and paths to recovery''.
*1995: Vaillant publishes a new edition entitled ''The Natural History of Alcoholism Revisited'', which includes the entire text of the 1983 edition plus new material marked "Revisited."
*1996: The 1995 edition is summarized in a paper by Vaillant and Hiller-Sturmhofel entitled “The Natural History of Alcoholism”.&lt;ref&gt;Vaillant 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;
*2003: Vaillant brings the studies to a close and summarizes results in a 2003 paper entitled "A 60-year follow-up of alcoholic men".&lt;ref&gt;Vaillant 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

===Definitions===
In the 1983 edition of his book, Vaillant required four positive answers to questions on his Problem Drinking Scale (PDS) to indicate ''alcohol abuse''. To diagnose full-blown alcoholism—i.e. ''alcohol [[Physical dependence|dependence]]''—he used [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]] III, which requires either [[Drug tolerance|physical tolerance]] or physiological [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]].&lt;ref&gt;Vaillant 1995, p 29 &amp; 32.&lt;/ref&gt; For the 1995 edition he abandoned the PDS and used the DSM definitions of both ''abuse'' and ''alcoholism''.

===Longitudinal study===
A [[longitudinal study]] is one that follows test subjects over a long period of time — as opposed to a [[Cross-sectional data|cross-sectional]] study, which gives a 'snap-shot' of a group at one point in time. Longitudinal studies tend to examine smaller groups in greater detail, whereas cross-sectional studies are often based on a more representative segment of the population over a short time. The longitudinal method was useful in identifying factors in alcoholism, for instance by investigating whether delinquent behaviour started before or after drinking.

===Prospective study===
A prospective study is forward-looking and includes subjects who did not originally have symptoms of the disease being studied. Many retrospective, or backward-looking, studies might take a group of alcoholics and try to determine what common traits might have caused their alcoholism. A prospective study takes a group of healthy individuals and tries to predict which ones would become alcoholic based on their histories—a much broader technique that often yields surprising results.&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin 1894.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Techniques for research on alcoholics===
Alcoholics present special challenges for researchers because they are good at concealing their drunkenness.&lt;ref name="Vaillant 1995, p 362"&gt;Vaillant 1995, p 362&lt;/ref&gt;  Vaillant asserts that "Alcoholics are expert forgetters,"&lt;ref&gt;Vaillant 1995, p 240.&lt;/ref&gt; have inaccurate memories,&lt;ref&gt;Vaillant 1995, p 24.&lt;/ref&gt; and give persuasive denials&lt;ref name="Vaillant 1995, p 362"/&gt; that manifest "an extraordinary ability to deny the consequences of their drinking."&lt;ref&gt;Vaillant 1995, p 292&lt;/ref&gt; For effective interviews, the subject should first be relatively sober. The interviewer should ask non-threatening, non-judgmental questions that do not challenge the alcoholic's right to drink&lt;ref&gt;Vaillant 1995, p 33.&lt;/ref&gt; and that minimise guilt.&lt;ref&gt;Vaillant 1995, p 364&lt;/ref&gt; (Failure to observe these guidelines by medical professionals has likely contributed to alcoholics’ reputation for denial.&lt;ref&gt;Vaillant 1995, p 33&lt;/ref&gt;) Interviewers should ask for objective evidence. For example, if an alcoholic claims that his divorce led to him drinking, the interviewer could ask if the alcoholic's spouse ever complained of his drinking ''before'' they split.&lt;ref&gt;Vaillant 1995, p 77.&lt;/ref&gt; Interviews and questionnaires should always be backed up with interviews with the subject's family, with consultation of medical records, and with searches in public records for evidence of legal problems associated with drinking.

==Book summary==

===Medical or behavioural disorder?===
A major focus in the book was a comparison of the various definitions of alcoholism:
*the medical model, which focuses on the individual's physical addiction and on symptoms such as ulcers or [[cirrhosis]] of the liver;
*the [[Behavior|behavioural]] model, which focuses on alcoholism as an individual choice that may be influenced by environmental factors;
*the sociological model, which focuses on the problems the subject creates in society, such as abuse to family members or arrests for drunk driving; and
*common sense concepts such as "a person is likely an alcoholic if they admit it and have been diagnosed in a clinic."&lt;ref&gt;Vaillant 1995, p 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first interesting observation was that there is no sharp dividing line between alcoholics and non-alcoholics. The number of drinking problems is spread out along a scale, just like IQ and blood pressure; there is not a cluster of alcoholics at the top end of the scale.&lt;ref&gt;Vaillant 1995, p 35-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vaillant compiled indicators of alcoholism from many sources, medical and sociological, and applied them to the Core City drinkers. Possible criteria included&lt;ref&gt;Vaillant 1995, p 31.&lt;/ref&gt;
*frequency of intoxication;
*[[binge drinking]];
*complaints from spouses, friends, bosses, or police;
*accidents and legal problems;
*attempts at “going on the wagon”;
*clinical diagnosis;
*admits problems;
*the ‘[[Delirium tremens|morning shakes]]’; and
*health problems.
Statistical techniques were used to determine which, if any, of the criteria were the best indicators of alcoholism.&lt;ref&gt;Vaillant 1995, p 39-40.&lt;/ref&gt; Surprisingly, the answer was that all criteria were of roughly equal importance.&lt;ref&gt;Vaillant 1995, p 36.&lt;/ref&gt; No particular indicator or cluster of indicators predominated: it was the ''number'' and ''frequency'' of problems that best defined alcoholism. More importantly, the medical, sociological, and behavioural criteria were equally reliable (i.e. highly [[Correlation|correlated]]).&lt;ref&gt;Vaillant 1995, p 37-39.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, it was equally valid to call alcoholism a medical or a behavioural disorder—evidence that doctors and sociologists are indeed talking about the same “unitary disorder”.

There are some grounds, Vaillant argues, for considering alcoholism a medical disease in the most severe cases. As the disorder worsens, conscious choice becomes less and less important and the alcoholic needs medical assistance to detoxify without risk to life (unlike, for example, heroin, which poses less physical danger to addicts going ‘[[cold turkey]]’).&lt;ref&gt;Vaillant 1995, p 19&lt;/ref&gt; In this respect, alcoholism resembles [[coronary heart disease]], which starts as ‘voluntary’, unhealthy behaviours such as poor diet and lack of exercise, but ends in a life-threatening medical condition.

===Causes of alcoholism===

Public opinion has it that alcoholics drink because they have underlying anxiety, unhappy childhoods, and lack of self-control.&lt;ref&gt;O.Reilly 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; However Vaillant’s results indicated that some "obvious" causes of alcoholism such as anxiety or '''unhappy childhoods''', were not significant&lt;ref&gt;Vaillant 1995, p 47&lt;/ref&gt; and that the alcoholic personality—self-centered, immature, dependent, resentful, and irresponsible—was not evident until ''after'' the subjects had started to abuse alcohol&lt;ref&gt;Vaillant 1995, p 51 and 76.&lt;/ref&gt; The type of personality found most likely to become alcoholic was [[Antisocial personality disorder|antisocial]] and [[Extraversion vs Introversion|extroverted]], although most antisocial behaviour observed was a result of alcoholism. The presence or absence of childhood environmental strengths predicted which of the College men would take tranquilizers or require medicine for physical complaints, but did not predict alcoholism.&lt;ref&gt;Vaillant 1995, p 58 and 73&lt;/ref&gt; Unhappy family environments caused alcoholism only if the unhappy environments were the ''result'' of alcoholism in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;Vaillant 1995, p 84, 86-88, and 96-98.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''ethnic [[Drinking culture|culture]]''' of each man was important. Among the Core City subjects, 61% of whose parents were born in foreign countries,&lt;ref&gt;Vaillant 1995, p 60&lt;/ref&gt; alcoholics were seven times more likely to have Irish than Italian backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;Vaillant 1995, p61.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, more alcoholics came from countries such as Ireland that prohibited drinking among children but condoned adult drunkenness. Fewer alcoholics came from countries such as Italy that allowed children to drink, especially at meals, and looked down on adult drunkenness.&lt;ref&gt;Vaillant 1995, p 63&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alcoholism in ancestors''' was a factor. Men with several alcohol-abusing ancestors (i.e. not members of immediate family) were twice as likely to become alcoholics as those with none.&lt;ref name="Vaillant 1995, p 67"&gt;Vaillant 1995, p 67.&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of an alcoholic parent increased the risk of alcoholism by three times, although it was not clear from the data if the factors were genetic or environmental.&lt;ref name="Vaillant 1995, p 67"/&gt;

Other miscellaneous factors leading to alcohol dependence &lt;ref&gt;Vaillant 1995, p 110 - 112.&lt;/ref&gt; included the rapidity with which the alcohol reaches the brain ("gives a high"); jobs such as journalism that encourage drinking because they have no daily structure; drinking behaviour in one's social group; legal availability of alcohol; cost of alcohol; and social stability—in other words medical, environmental, social, and economic factors.&lt;ref&gt;Vaillant 1995, p 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Depression''', clinically so often found to occur with alcoholism,&lt;ref&gt;Vaillant 1995, p 84&lt;/ref&gt; was likewise found to be a ''result'' of alcoholism. Evidence such as this indicated that alcoholism is not merely a symptom of an underlying disorder, but is an independent disorder in itself.

===Natural history of alcoholism===

Contrary to popular conception, alcoholism does not start with the first drink, but usually has a gradual onset over 5 to 15 years of continuous alcohol abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Vaillant 1995, p 119 and 156&lt;/ref&gt; One surprise to Vaillant was the number of men who were able to abuse alcohol for decades without becoming dependent.&lt;ref&gt;Vaillant 2003, p 1047.&lt;/ref&gt; Of 29 alcohol abusers in the College sample, seven men were able to drink heavily for a mean of three decades without showing symptoms of dependence.

The average age of onset of alcohol abuse was 29 years for the Core City men and 41 years for the College men. Full blown alcoholism, where it appeared, usually lasted a decade or two before sobriety was attained. The number of alcoholics increased steadily until age 40 and then began to decline&lt;ref&gt;Vaillant 1996, p 157-158&lt;/ref&gt; at a rate of stable remission of 2 to 3% per year. Older alcoholics are relatively rare because of the rate of remission and a higher mortality rate.

Seventy-two alcoholics in the Core City sample were successfully followed to age 70. By this age 54% had died, 32% were abstinent, 1% were controlled drinkers, and 12% were still abusing alcohol.

By comparison 19 alcoholics in the College sample were successfully followed to age 70. By this age 58% had died, 21% were abstinent, 10.5% were controlled drinkers, and 10.5% were still abusing alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;Vaillant 2003, p 1043.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the topic of whether '''controlled drinking''' is advisable as a therapeutic goal, Vaillant concluded that “training alcohol-dependent individuals to achieve stable return to controlled drinking is a mirage.”&lt;ref name="Vaillant 1996, p 383"&gt;Vaillant 1996, p 383.&lt;/ref&gt; Successful return to controlled drinking is possible, just a rare and unstable outcome that in the long term usually ends in relapse or abstinence, especially for the more severe cases.&lt;ref&gt;Vaillant 1996, p 167, 170, 233, and 297.&lt;/ref&gt; Vaillant tracked two samples within his study group: 21 alcohol abusers who had attained stable abstinence, and 22 who had returned to a stable pattern of controlled drinking. At the end of 15 years of follow-up, in 1995, one of the 21 abstainers had returned to controlled drinking, and one had relapsed. In contrast, of the 22 controlled drinkers 3 became abstinent and 7 relapsed.&lt;ref&gt;Vaillant 1996, p 294.&lt;/ref&gt; For the less severe cases, Vaillant concluded that controlled drinking ''is'' a worthwhile and valid goal, but “by the time an alcoholic is ill enough to require clinic treatment, return to asymptomatic drinking is the exception not the rule.”&lt;ref name="Vaillant 1996, p 383"/&gt;

===Clinical Treatment===

In the Clinic sample, 100 severe alcoholics treated at the clinic were followed for 8 years. The clinic’s methods were multi-modal: detoxification and hospital treatment followed by referral to AA. At the end of the 8 years, 34% of subjects had achieved stable abstinence, 29% had died, and 26% were still abusing alcohol,&lt;ref&gt;Vaillant 1996, p 158.&lt;/ref&gt; and the evidence was that other clinical studies had reported similar lack of success.&lt;ref&gt;Vaillant 1995, p 352.&lt;/ref&gt; Subjects who had a stable social environment or who frequently went to AA meetings had the highest rates of abstinence. Overall, however, treatment other than AA did not significantly improve the subjects’ outcome.&lt;ref&gt;Vaillant 1996, p 158&lt;/ref&gt; In fact Vaillant reports the dismal fact that fully 95% of the Clinic sample had relapsed at some time during the 8-year study period.&lt;ref&gt;Vaillant 1995, p 350.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note that the figure of 95%—the number of clinical patients who relapsed at any time during the 8 year study—has been quoted on some personal websites as evidence that AA is ineffective.[http://www.orange-papers.org/orange-effectiveness.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Vaillant noted that clinical treatment helped only in the short term, as crisis intervention and detox. There was one indicator, a financial one, of short-term success: clinical intervention had significantly reduced the cost of future health care for the alcoholics.&lt;ref&gt;Vaillant 1995, p 360-361.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vaillant’s conclusion was that “There is compelling evidence that the results of our treatment were no better than the natural history of the disease.”&lt;ref&gt;Vaillant 1996, p 350.&lt;/ref&gt; If clinical treatment had failed to improve on the long-term recovery rates of alcoholics, then what would be the most hopeful route to sobriety?

===Paths to recovery===

Research by Vaillant and others found that there were no obvious factors or personality differences to distinguish alcoholics from abstainers; “To a large extent, relapse to and remission from alcoholism remains a mystery.”&lt;ref&gt;Vaillant 1996, p 252 and 371.&lt;/ref&gt; As was observed in the 1940s in patients with tuberculosis—at that time incurable—recovery depended largely on the patient’s own resistance and morale. The same applies to alcoholism, which at present still has no known ‘cure’. As with diabetes, professional help is in training to prevent a relapse&lt;ref&gt;Vaillant 1996, p 252 and 385.&lt;/ref&gt; and in crisis intervention until patients are strong enough to heal themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Vaillant 1996, p 384.&lt;/ref&gt; If natural forces are dominant in the healing process, then treatment should aim to strengthen and support these natural forces, Vaillant argued. The alcoholic needs support in making the required personality change. Thus, achieving long-term sobriety usually involves 
# finding a substitute dependency, such as group attendance;
# experiencing negative consequences of drinking, such as legal problems or a painful ulcer;
# new, close relationships and social support;
# a source of inspiration and hope such as a religious group.

Vaillant argues that an important contribution health professionals can make is to explain alcoholism to patients as a ''disease'',&lt;ref&gt;Vaillant 1996, p 366 and 378.&lt;/ref&gt; which encourages the patient to take responsibility for their problem without debilitating guilt, in the same way that a diabetic becomes responsible for proper self care when they become aware of their condition.&lt;ref&gt;Vaillant 1996, p 385.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alcoholics Anonymous===

Vaillant, who is a non-alcoholic Trustee of [[Alcoholics Anonymous|AA]], made the effectiveness of AA one of the key questions to be investigated in his research.&lt;ref&gt;Vaillant 1996, p 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Vaillant argues that AA and other similar groups effectively harness the above four factors of healing and that many alcoholics achieve sobriety through AA attendance. However, he also notes that the “effectiveness of AA has not been adequately assessed”&lt;ref&gt;Vaillant 1995, p 255.&lt;/ref&gt; and that “direct evidence for the efficacy of AA… remains as elusive as ever.&lt;ref&gt;Vaillant 1995, p 265.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if an alcoholic achieves sobriety during AA attendance, who is to say if AA helped or if he merely went to AA when he was ready to heal?&lt;ref name="genderbias" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vaillant 1995, p 253. Vaillant 1996, p 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Clinic sample, 48% of the 29 alcoholics who achieved sobriety eventually attended 300 or more AA meetings,&lt;ref&gt;Vaillant 1995, p 257.&lt;/ref&gt; and AA attendance was associated with good outcomes in patients who otherwise would have been predicted not to remit.&lt;ref&gt;Vaillant 1995, p 268.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Core City sample the more severe alcoholics attended AA, possibly because all other avenues had failed—after all, AA meetings are rarely attended for hedonistic reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Vaillant 1996, p 262-263.&lt;/ref&gt; The implication from all three samples was simply that many alcoholics find help through AA.&lt;ref&gt;Vaillant 1995, p 388.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Book reviews==

Vaillant’s academic peers saw ''The Natural History of Alcoholism'' as “objective, scholarly, and factual,”&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; “wise” and “comprehensive”,&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; an “outstanding and highly recommended text”,&lt;ref&gt;Mendelson, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; and “one of the few [longitudinal studies] and by far the most thorough and scientific.”&lt;ref name="Royce, 1983"&gt;Royce, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; James Royce wrote that Vaillant "cites innumerable studies and examines opposing viewpoints on every issue," but that this objectivity made the book harder to read for the general reader since the conclusions were difficult to extract.&lt;ref name="Royce, 1983"/&gt;

There were varying opinions on the book’s readability. According to David N. Saunders “The book is hard to follow because so much research material is included.”&lt;ref name="Saunders, 1984"&gt;Saunders, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New York Times'' advised that the casual reader should skip over most of the technical discussion,&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann-Haupt, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas ''The National Review'' noted only an “occasional thicket of psycho-statistical jargon.”&lt;ref&gt;Teachout, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

Royce wrote that Vaillant failed to summarize new (in 1983) research findings on alcohol’s interaction with the brain, and that Vaillant had not quoted some notable researchers who have argued for the disease model of alcoholism.&lt;ref&gt;Royce 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; Saunders held that more discussion of the treatment issues was needed and noted that many of the measurements made before Vaillant took over the studies were very crude.&lt;ref name="Saunders, 1984"/&gt;

Perhaps the sharpest critic of Vaillant’s work was controlled drinking proponent [[Stanton Peele]]. In a 1983 review in ''The New York Times'', Peele wrote that "The results of this research do not provide ready support for the disease theory of alcoholism. ... [For example, Vaillant] finds strong evidence in the inner city group for sociocultural causality in alcoholism."&lt;ref&gt;Peele, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;  In his book ''Diseasing of America'' Peele claimed that "Vaillant emphatically endorses the disease model... He sees alcoholism as a primary disease... However, Vaillant's claims are not supported by his own data."&lt;ref&gt;Peele 1989,  p68.&lt;/ref&gt; Other reviewers held the opposite, that Vaillant did ''not'' see alcoholism as a disease. Addiction researcher James E. Royce wrote that "Vaillant avoids a simplistic medical model of alcoholism, pointing up instead its complexity as a socio-psycho-biological illness."&lt;ref&gt;Royce, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; David N. Saunders of the School of Social Work, Virginia Commonwealth University, wrote that Vaillant "maintains that alcoholism is both a disease and a behaviour disorder."&lt;ref&gt;Saunders 1983&lt;/ref&gt; In his summary at the end of the book, Vaillant in fact wrote that "Alcoholism can simultaneously reflect both a conditioned habit and a disease; and the disease of alcoholism can be as well defined by a sociological model as by a medical model."&lt;ref&gt;Vaillant 1995, p 376 [original, 1983 text]&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
|&lt;1911||Healthcare in United Kingdom is generally available only to the wealthy, unless one is able to obtain free treatment through charity or teaching hospitals.&lt;ref name="The UK Health Care System" /&gt;
|-
|1911-1946||A National Insurance Act is introduced in which a small amount is deducted from an employee’s wage and in return they are entitled to free healthcare. However this scheme only benefits employed individuals.&lt;ref name="The UK Health Care System" /&gt;
|-
|1946 onwards||Following the [[Second World War]], major social reforms aim at a universal healthcare system as main purpose. A respective [[National Health Service]] (NHS) is established for England ([[NHS England]]), Scotland ([[NHS Scotland]]), and Wales ([[NHS Wales]]) as independent institutions. [[Health and Social Care in Northern Ireland]] is also established. 
|-
|Present time||Today, the healthcare system in the United Kingdom is still fragmented, with [[England]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]] each having their own systems of [[publicly funded healthcare]], funded by and accountable to separate governments and parliaments, together with smaller private sector and voluntary provision. In a 2014 report ranking developed-country healthcare systems, the overall healthcare system of the [[United Kingdom]] was ranked the best in the world in the following categories: Quality of Care (i.e. effective, safe, coordinated, patient-oriented), Access to Care, Efficiency, and Equity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How the U.S. Health Care System Compares Internationally|url=http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/fund-reports/2014/jun/mirror-mirror|accessdate=23 November 2016|website=[[The Commonwealth Fund]]|date=16 June 2014|last1=Davis|first1=Karen|last2=Stremikis|first2=Kristof|last3=Squires|first3=David|last4=Schoen|first4=Cathy|author-link1=Karen Davis (economist)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Traditional Cambodian medicine''' ([[Khmer language|Khmer]]:វេជ្ជសាស្រ្តបូរាណខ្មែរ) comprise several [[traditional medicine]] systems in [[Cambodia]].

Healers and herbalists of Cambodian traditional medicine are collectively referred to as ''Kru Khmer'' ([[Khmer language|Khmer]]:គ្រូខ្មែរ). There are many regional variations of the practice and herbal knowledge of traditional medicine within Cambodia. Traditional Cambodian medical practices are widely used in Cambodia.

Even though health is among the Cambodian governments five most important issues, the healthcare system in the country is inadequate and people in more remote villages in the provinces have difficulty obtaining health care. This situation is reflected in many [[developing countries]] and, in part for this reason, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) is promoting the use of and preservation of knowledge of several traditional medicines in many of these areas across the globe, including Cambodia.&lt;ref&gt;See "''[http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/en/d/Js7916e/ National Policy on Traditional Medicine and Regulation of Herbal Medicines - Report of a WHO Global Survey]''"&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the ethnic Chinese and ethnic Vietnamese populations of Cambodia, [[traditional Chinese medicine]] and [[traditional Vietnamese medicine]] are also practiced and represented in the country.

== Techniques and culture ==
Practitioners of traditional Cambodian medicine are called ''Kru Khmer'' (or alternately ''kru khmae'') (គ្រូខ្មែរ) meaning "Khmer teachers", and the teacher-student aspect between practitioner and patient is of central importance to the consultation. Kru Khmers specialise in several categories, such as bone setting, herbalism or [[divining]]. Various animal parts, minerals and tattoos are sometimes involved.&lt;ref name=MI&gt;See ''Kru Khmer'' (p.52 f) in ''Medical Identities''.&lt;/ref&gt; In the framework of traditional Cambodian medicine, the supernatural world can both cure and cause illness and therefore the definitions between what is medicinal and what is spiritual is often blurred.&lt;ref name=TRAFFIC&gt;See the TRAFFIC report.&lt;/ref&gt;

Khmer traditional medicine share with [[Chinese traditional medicine]] three explanatory models of disease: supernaturalistic theory, naturalistic theory, and maintenance of a hot-cold ([[yin-yang]]) balance. Four forms of therapy are delivered by medical and para-medical personnel: spirit offerings, [[dermabrasion]], maintaining hot-cold balance, and herbal medicines.&lt;ref&gt;See "''Traditional Cambodian Medicine''"&lt;/ref&gt;

The knowledge of Khmer traditional medicine is mediated from teacher to teacher. Each ''Kru Khmer'' answers to his individual teacher, called ''Kru Khom'', through a spiritual connection, even after the death of his ''Kru Khom''. There are intricate rules and rituals involved in this relationship.&lt;ref name=MI/&gt;

Khmer traditional medicine used to rely on written texts, [[Khmer sastras]] or palm-leaf manuscripts, since the 9th century, stored and studied at the many temples across the former [[Khmer Empire]]. However, during the [[Cambodian civil war]] and the following [[Khmer rouge]] regime, virtually all historic scholarly texts and philosophical literature in Cambodia were destroyed, including many Khmer medical manuscripts.&lt;ref name=MI/&gt;

To understand the profession and practice of the ''Kru Khmer'' in more detail, the profession may be divided into a number of sub-classifications, each tied to a specific method, affliction of attention and/or service provided.&lt;ref&gt;See "''Cambodians and Their Doctors''", p. 134-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Kru thnam'' (or ''kru phsom thnam'') ([[Khmer language|Khmer]]:គ្រូថ្នាំ ឬ គ្រូផ្សំថ្នាំ) means "medicine combiner" and comprise traditional herbalists.
* ''Kru bakbeg'' (or ''kru to chhang'') ([[Khmer language|Khmer]]:គ្រូបាក់បែក ឬ គ្រូតឆ្អឹង) means "broken" (or "bone connector"). These are bone-setters using various herbal concoctions in bandages.
* ''Kru teay'' ([[Khmer language|Khmer]]:គ្រូទាយ) are [[Divination|diviner]]s and [[fortune telling|fortune-tellers]]. Methods range from astrological charts and mantras to herbs and blowing (''sdoh phlom'').
* ''Kru sneh'' ([[Khmer language|Khmer]]:គ្រូស្នេហ៍) means "charmer" and these ''kru khmer''s makes "love medicine" or [[Spell (paranormal)|charms]] to be used for general luck.
* ''Kru son thith'' ([[Khmer language|Khmer]]:គ្រូសណ្ឋិត) are diviners with permanent access to some special spirits. They are supposed to divine the course of certain diseases and sometimes use herbs too.  
* ''Kru thmup'' ([[Khmer language|Khmer]]:គ្រូធ្មប់) are sorcerers said to cause illness or inflict evil upon people. Broadly despised and feared in traditional Cambodian culture and viewed as evil themselves, no ''kru khmer'' would admit to be or practise ''thmup''. To cure evil inflicted by ''thmup'' one would need the help from a ''kru teay'', ''kru son thith'', ''kru chol rup'' or a Buddhist monk.
* ''Kru chol rup'' (or ''kru boramey'') ([[Khmer language|Khmer]]:គ្រូចូលរូប ឬ គ្រូបារមី) meaning "body enterer", are possessed spirit mediums, often female. They are able to perform diagnosis or [[exorcism]]s. 
* Buddhist monks plays a role in the practice of traditional Cambodian medicine, as they perform exorcisms, mostly preventive exorcisms.
* ''Chhmob boran'' ([[Khmer language|Khmer]]:ឆ្មបបូរាណ) are [[midwives]] who, under the guidance of a personal spirit, performs nursing and ritual assistance for mother and child during and after delivery.

Individual ''Kru Khmer'' healers may perform several roles altogether.

== History ==
[[File:Neak pean 2009 1.jpg|thumb|Neak Poan is believed to be the central temple for traditional Khmer medicine during the Angkorian period. The image shows the central sanctuary of Neak Poan.]]
The exact origins of traditional Khmer medicine (TKM) remains unclear, but it is believed to have been founded and formalised from the Nokor Phnom period (Funan era) to the 9th century, during the Angkorian period.&lt;ref name=Chan&gt;"''History of medicine''", by Prof. Iv Chan, p.70-76, published in 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; It is influenced by [[Ayurveda]] (traditional Indian medicine) and [[traditional Chinese medicine]]. These foreign frameworks and practices were mixed with local beliefs and superstitions to create the foundations of TKM. The temple of [[Neak Poan]] is believed to have been the central temple for Khmer medicine during the Angkorian era. [[Jayavarman VII]], who reigned c.1181–1218, ordered the construction of 102 hospitals (‘halls devoid of disease’ or ''arogyasala'') throughout his realm.

Khmer inscriptions investigated by French archeological researcher [[George Cœdès]] in the early 20th century, confirmed the existence of 15 hospitals (out of Jayavarman VII's 102 hospitals) across the kingdom. Those 15 hospitals are :

Inscriptions in these hospitals describe the number of medical staff and their different roles such as hospital managers, drug combiner staff, water boiler staff, drug grinders and drug distributors. An inscription in Sai Fong has become the most renowned quote of King Jayavarman VII: ''"Diseases of the people make him more painful than his own illness."''&lt;ref&gt;''King Jayavarman VII'' National Museum of Cambodia, Phnom Penh&lt;/ref&gt;

Prasat Chrey ([[Khmer language|Khmer]]: ប្រាសាទជ្រៃ) and Prasat Lek 8 (Number 8 temple) ([[Khmer language|Khmer]]: ប្រាសាទលេខ៨) are temples in [[Sambor Prei Kuk]] that were previous hospital chapels during the [[Chenla]] era. Inside the hospital chapels, ground or smashed traditional herbal medicines extracted from plant trunks, roots and leaves were mixed with purified water. The drug liquid was then poured over a [[Shiva]] [[Linga]] to enhance the effectiveness, after which it flowed from the Linga base through the outside part of the chapels via a drainpipe connected to the north side of the buildings. Here, patients, who were waiting outside the hospital, finally received the drug liquid.&lt;ref name=Chan /&gt;

[[File:JYVMN7.JPG|thumb|left|Jayavarman VII ordered a total of 102 'halls of diseaselessness' across the Angkorian Empire in the 12th century, serving the general population.]]
The knowledge and practice of TKM was written down on [[palm-leaf manuscripts]], written in the [[pali]] language, and stored in temples all over the empire. Most of these original [[Khmer sastra|Khmer medicinal manuscripts]] are thought to have been destroyed in the Cambodian civil war, but some still exists and they represent some of the most reliable sources to the origins of TKM.&lt;ref name=TRAFFIC/&gt;&lt;ref name=NIAS&gt;See "''Cambodians and Their Doctors''", p.129-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Surviving ancient Khmer medical texts shows a considerable systematization of medical knowledge, but an institutionalized Khmer medical system with associated doctrine-based practices, did not survive into the modern age in Cambodia. Scholars and historians have long wondered what happened to this grand medical tradition and the 13th century is considered a crucial tipping point in the history of traditional Khmer medicine. The gradual decline of the [[Angkorian Empire]] and the religious shifts to Theravada Buddhism appears to have affected the original medical culture greatly. The Siamese conquest of Angkor is not thought to have destroyed the medical traditions, but rather appropriated the medical knowledge and preserved it as [[Culture of Thailand|Thai]] instead of Khmer. The French colonial era is also thought to have affected and prevented the rise of the ancient Khmer medical tradition. Unlike India for example, where dialogue and knowledge exchange between initial colonialists and Indian doctors took place, the colonial presence beginning with the 18th century in Cambodia was almost instantaneous and the French demanded and relied upon Western medicine from the very start, abolishing the local Cambodian medical traditions altogether. The following independence and warring upheaval of Cambodia during the civil war, the Khmer Rouge regime and the Vietnamese occupation, all continued this suppression of medical traditions, in particular the spiritual aspects. This centuries long pressure have resulted in fragmenting the Khmer medical tradition, sometimes with local reinventions emerging.&lt;ref name=NIAS/&gt;

Historically, three sub-categorizations of the ''Kru Khmer'' profession have been noted: ''kru pet'' ([[Khmer language|Khmer]]:គ្រូពេទ្យ), ''kru thnam'' and ''tmup''. ''Kru pet'' were the most revered and theoretically educated. They studied the palm-leaf manuscripts in temples and were mostly found around the royalty's residences and temples, less so among the general population. ''Kru thnam'', who were herbalists without much interest in religious aspects, were much more numerous and to be found throughout the country. ''Tmup'' were [[Magician (paranormal)|sorcerers]].&lt;ref&gt;Described by [[Adhémar Leclère]] in 1894. See "''Cambodians and Their Doctors''", p.133.&lt;/ref&gt; These general categorizations are still in use in Cambodia today, but the ''kru pet'' class is nonexistent.

=== Notable Kru Khmers ===
''Kru pet'' hermits have always been glorified and venerated in the Khmer culture for their kindness of saving human and animal lives. Statues were made to pay respect to ''kru pet'', like the hermit sculpture on [[Phnom Santuk]] mountain, and hermitages or temples dedicated to ''kru pet'' were built such as Maha Rusey ([[Khmer language|Khmer]]: មហាឫសី) hermitage on [[Phnom Da]] mountain.

Semahatata ([[Khmer language|Khmer]]: ''សឹម្ហទត្ត'') was a royal doctor of King [[Rodravarman]] and [[Jayavarman I]] during [[Chenla]] period. In addition, he was the royal official of King [[Bhavavarman I]] and [[Mahendravarman (Chenla)|Mahendravarman]]. At that time, he was the mayor of [[Vyadhapura]] also.&lt;ref&gt;"''History of medicine''", by Prof. Iv Chan, p.70, published in 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yajnavaraha]] was a religious ''Kru Khmer'' and royal physician of the [[Khmer Empire]] in the 10th century. Along with Khmer traditional medicine he also practiced [[Ayurveda]], an Indian traditional medicine system.

== Centers and organizations ==
A [[Traditional Medicine Research Center (Cambodia)|Traditional Medicine Research Center]] was opened in Cambodia in 1982. In 1983, production of selected medicines began at the research center and a number of books on healing plants have been published. Specialists in Cambodian traditional medicine have been brought to the Faculty of Medicine for conferences and one of the faculty's goals is to introduce traditional medicine in all curricula at primary, secondary, and university levels.&lt;ref name=HCCambodia&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.culturalsurvival.org/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/cambodia/health-care-cambodia|title=Health Care in Cambodia|publisher=Cultural Survival|date=1990|accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the [[National School of Traditional Medicine (Cambodia)|National School of Traditional Medicine]] opened in [[Phnom Penh]]. The school teaches and collects knowledge of traditional medicine in Cambodia, usually referred to as [[Khmer people|Khmer]] traditional medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nippon-foundation.or.jp/en/who/message/speeches/2009/7.html|title=Opening of School for Khmer Traditional Medicine|publisher=The Nippon Foundation|date=29 April 2009|accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=http://www.phnompenhpost.com/lift/who-needs-modern-medicine|title=Who needs modern medicine?|newspaper=The Phnom Penh Post|author=Keo Kounila|date=10 November 2010|accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school has a special educational focus on [[hygiene]] and [[anatomy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/07/04/cambodia-khmer-healers-get-schooled-in-ancient-art.html|title=Cambodia's Khmer healers get schooled in ancient art|publisher=AFP|website=Fox News World|date=4 July 2013|accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Laws and regulations ==
Regulation of [[herbal medicines]] in Cambodia was introduced in 1998. Herbal medicines are regulated as over the counter medicines and for self medication only. By law, no claims may be made about herbal medicines.&lt;ref name= WHO&gt;{{cite paper|url=http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/en/d/Js7916e/9.6.html#Js7916e.9.6|title=National Policy on Traditional Medicine and Regulation of Herbal Medicines - Report of a WHO Global Survey|publisher=WHO|date=2005|accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The regulatory requirements for manufacturing or safety assessment, and the control mechanisms established to ensure compliance, come under the [[Ministry of Health (Cambodia)|Department of Drugs and Food]]. As of 2005, there are 48 registered herbal medicines in Cambodia; however, none of them are included on a national essential drug list.&lt;ref name=WHO/&gt;

Herbal medicines in Cambodia are sold in pharmacies as over the counter medicines, in special outlets, by licensed practitioners and without restriction.&lt;ref name=WHO/&gt;

'''Step 3''' is the final exam in the [[USMLE]] series of examinations.  It is part of the licensing requirements for [[Doctor of Medicine|Doctors of Medicine]] (M.D.) and [[international medical graduate]]s to practice [[medicine]] in the [[United States]]. The USMLE Step 3 exam is considered the final step in the series of medical licensure examinations.  Generally, it is a pre-requisite of the majority of the state licensing boards.

USMLE Step 3 tests several concepts that are often required to provide general health care to a patient. USMLE Step 3 is a mandatory exam that must be passed in order to obtain license as a practicing physician. Some International Medical Graduates are required to pass USMLE Step 3 in order to obtain an H1 Visa.

Most of the USMLE Step 3 exam (75 percent) consists of multiple choice questions, while the remaining 25 percent are clinical case simulations.  A full description of the content of the exam can be found on the USMLE website.&lt;ref name="urlUSMLE® : Test Content &amp; Practice Materials"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usmle.org/examinations/step3/step3.html |title=USMLE® : Test Content &amp; Practice Materials |work= |accessdate=21 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; USMLE Step 3 exams are delivered online and are available throughout the year to the examinees. The examinee needs to register via a state licensing board for this exam.

Since 2014 USMLE Step 3 can be taken on two non-consecutive days, instead of two consecutive days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://medicalopedia.org/2648/usmle-new-changes-2014-step-3-going-to-be-divided-into-two-parts/ |title=USMLE New Changes 2014: Step 3 Going To Be Divided Into Two Parts |publisher=Medicalopedia |date=2012-04-12 |accessdate=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examination content==
USMLE Step 3 examination tests on general topics that are required to understand and practice concepts of general medicine/ [[family medicine]].

The following components are tested:

Normal conditions and [[disease]] categories (normal growth and development, basic concepts, and general principles)

Clinical encounter frame (initial work up, continuing care, urgent intervention)

Physician task (applying scientific concepts, formulating a diagnosis based on history, physical exam, and lab findings, and managing the patient).

Clinical encounter frames are common clinical scenarios physicians may encounter. They range from nonemergency problems, to the continuity of care, to life-threatening emergency situations encountered in emergency departments, clinics, offices, care facilities, inpatient settings, and on the telephone. Each test item, in an encounter frame, represents one of the six physician tasks. For example, initial care encounters emphasize taking a history and performing a physical examination. In contrast, continued care encounters emphasize decisions regarding prognosis and management.

Day 1 (Foundations of Independent Practice [FIP]) will continue to be divided into six 60-minute blocks. Each FIP block will have 38 to 40 multiple-choice questions (MCQs). The total number of MCQs on the FIP portion of the examination will be 233. The total testing day will be approximately 7 hours.

Day 2 (Advanced Clinical Medicine [ACM]) will continue to be divided into six 45-minute blocks of MCQs, and 13 computer-based case simulations (CCS). Each ACM MCQ block will have 30 items. The total number of MCQ items on the ACM portion of the examination will be 180. The second half of day 2 will contain the 13 CCS cases. 
&lt;ref&gt;[http://usmle.org/announcements/?ContentId=166] from usmle.org, January 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eligibility for USMLE Step 3==
To be eligible to take the USMLE Step 3 exam, the physician must hold a medical degree, and pass the [[USMLE Step 1]] and [[USMLE Step 2 Clinical Knowledge|Step 2 Clinical Knowledge exams]]. International medical graduates (IMGs) must obtain certification by the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates (ECFMG). (Prior to December 2009, one could alternatively complete a "Fifth Pathway" program.)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ecfmg.org/2017ib/fifth-pathway.html&lt;/ref&gt; The [[USMLE Step 2 Clinical Skills|Step 2 CS]] may also be required. Canadian M.D. graduates are not considered IMGs.

Starting November 2014, fulfillment of specific requirements from individual medical licensing authorities will not be needed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usmle.org/pdfs/Changes_to_USMLE_2014-2015_handout_FINAL.pdf Changes to USMLE 2014 – 2015] from usmle.org, November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparation strategies for USMLE Step 3==

Typically, worldwide examinees require two to three months(citation needed) to prepare for this exam, although in the US, examinees who are American medical school graduates commonly prepare for only a few days to a few weeks.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Physicians in post-graduate training that plan for fellowships or additional training often are advised to consider more detailed preparation.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} An examinee is tested on clinical skills, diagnostic acumen, decision making, treatment guidelines and follow up care. Most recently, some changes have been made to USMLE Step 3 multiple choice questions including increased emphasis placed on biostatistics, epidemiology, and population health, literature interpretation, medical ethics, and patient safety.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Since the USMLE Step 3 exam is typically taken after matching into a residency, it does not require a physician to obtain a competitive score and only need to pass to obtain their medical license. However, a competitive score may be needed if they want to apply for a fellowship.

==Scoring==
