The '''Action for Change (AC)''' ({{lang-fr|Action pour le changement}}) was a [[political party]] in [[Mauritania]]. The party was led by Messaoud Ould Belkheir, and campaigned for greater rights for Mauritania's [[Haratin]] and black populations. The party was banned in January 2002.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;

==History==

===Electoral history===
The first election contested by the AC was the [[Mauritanian parliamentary election, 1996|1996 parliamentary election]], with the party coming third, with 5.3% of the vote and 1 seat in parliament.

The party also went on to contest the [[Mauritanian parliamentary election, 2001|2001 parliamentary election]], winning 5.5% of the popular vote and 4 out of 81 seats.

===Dissolution===
The party was banned in January 2002 following accusations by the government that the party threatened Mauritanian national unity and was threatening Mauritania's relations with Senegal. Communications Minister Chyakh Ould Ely accused the party of being racist and violent. The party was allowed to keep its four parliamentary seats.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;

Messaoud Ould Belkheir, the leader of the AC strongly denied the allegations made against the party, and claimed that the party was instead being banned as part of a crackdown in dissent by the government, and also because of the parties recent electoral gains.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/1740098.stm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''All India Kisan Sabha''' ('''Akhil Bharatiya Kisan Sabha''') (AIKS), is the peasants front of [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]], and works for farmers rights and anti-feudal movement in India,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduonnet.com/businessline/blnus/07141250.htm AP agri body seeks aid to tenant farmers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224191532/http://www.hinduonnet.com/businessline/blnus/07141250.htm |date=24 February 2009 }} ''[[The Hindu]]'', 14 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; which traces its origin to [[All India Kisan Sabha]] founded in 1936.

It is sometimes referred to as All India Kisan Sabha (36 Canning Lane), to distinguish it from the AIKS of [[Communist Party of India]]. Both the Kisan federations are derived from the [[All India Kisan Sabha]] started by [[Swami Sahajanand Saraswati]] in 1936. The AIKS of CPI is sometimes called [[All India Kisan Sabha (Ajoy Bhavan)|AIKS (Ajoy Bhavan)]].

==History==
[[File:Kerala2006 (19).JPG|thumb|Kerala Karshaka Sangam, the [[Kerala]] regional body of AIKS, mural in [[Allepey]]]]
The Kisan Sabha movement started in [[Bihar]] under the leadership of [[Swami Sahajanand Saraswati]] who had formed in 1929 the [[Bihar Provincial Kisan Sabha]] (BPKS) in order to mobilise peasant grievances against the zamindari attacks on their occupancy rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 | isbn = 978-81-250-2596-2
 | pages = 523 (at p 406)
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gradually the peasant movement intensified and spread across the rest of [[India]]. All these radical developments on the peasant front culminated in the formation of the [[All India Kisan Sabha]] (AIKS) at the [[Lucknow]] session of the [[Indian National Congress]] in April 1936 with [[Swami Sahajanand Saraswati]] elected as its first President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The other prominent members of this Sabha were [[N.G. Ranga]], [[Ram Manohar Lohia]], [[Jayaprakash Narayan]], [[Acharya Narendra Dev]] and Bankim Mukerji.

The main aim of the sabha were:-
1)To save the peasants from exploitation by any section of the society.
2)Abolition of [[zamindari]] and [[jagirdari]] system
3)To save the peasants from economic exploitation
4)Ownership of land by the peasants
5)Reduction in the rates of land revenue
6)Waiving of debts
7)Better arrangements of irrigation
8)To give recognition to Kisan Sabhas

The Kisan Sabha started agitations against the landlords. In the 1937-38, they started a movement for the ownership of the lands by the peasants who worked on it and to bring about the end of forced labour. The farmers revolted against the Jagirdars who did not give them any rights on the land.As a result, the conflict between the peasants and the landlords became more intense. The government arrested 600 Kisan demonstrators and suppressed the movement.

In 1939, when the second world war began, the Government enforced the Defence of India Rules strictly to crush the peasant movement. But the Kisan union continued struggle forcefully.

==Organisation==
The address of AIKS is 36, Canning Lane, [[New Delhi]].

'''American imperialism''' is a policy aimed at extending the political, economic, and cultural control of the United States government over areas beyond its boundaries. It can be accomplished in any number of ways: by military conquest, by [[treaty]], by [[subsidization]], by economic penetration through private companies followed by [[Interventionism (politics)|intervention]] when  those interests are threatened, or by [[regime change]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/uhic/ReferenceDetailsPage/ReferenceDetailsWindow?failOverType=&amp;query=&amp;prodId=UHIC&amp;windowstate=normal&amp;contentModules=&amp;display-query=&amp;mode=view&amp;displayGroupName=Reference&amp;dviSelectedPage=&amp;limiter=&amp;currPage=&amp;disableHighlighting=false&amp;displayGroups=&amp;sortBy=&amp;zid=&amp;search_within_results=&amp;p=UHIC&amp;action=e&amp;catId=&amp;activityType=&amp;scanId=&amp;documentId=GALE%7CCX3611000416&amp;source=Bookmark&amp;u=wale31173&amp;jsid=998307cb26570bbb35c57f6ee059cff9 "History in Context: Imperialism" ''Gale Encyclopedia of U.S. Economic History'', 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of expanding territorial control was popularized in the 19th century as the doctrine of [[Manifest Destiny]] and was realized through conquests such as the [[Mexican–American War]] of 1846, which resulted in the [[Mexican Cession|annexation of 525,000 square miles of Mexican territory]].&lt;ref name="lens"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lens|first1=Sidney|authorlink1=Sidney Lens|last2=Zinn|first2=Howard |title=The Forging of the American Empire|publisher=Pluto Press|location=London|year=2003|origyear=1971 |isbn=0-7453-2100-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qvLfIHqkOOAC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Field 644–668"&gt;{{cite journal |title=American Imperialism: The Worst Chapter i Almost Any Book |last=Field |first=James A., Jr. |journal=The American Historical Review |volume=83 |issue=3 |date=June 1978 |pages=644–668 |doi=10.2307/1861842 |jstor=1861842}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the US government does not refer to itself as an empire, the continuing phenomenon has been acknowledged by mainstream [[Western culture|Western]] writers including [[Max Boot]], [[Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.|Arthur Schlesinger]], and [[Niall Ferguson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/american-empire-not-if-but-what-kind/|title=American Empire, Not ‘If’ but ‘What Kind’|first=Ivo H.

A national drive for territorial acquisition across the continent was popularized in the 19th century as the ideology of [[Manifest Destiny]]. It came to be realized with the [[Mexican–American War]] of 1846, which resulted in the [[Mexican Cession|annexation of 525,000 square miles of Mexican territory]], stretching up to the Pacific coast.&lt;ref name="lens"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Field 644–668"/&gt;

President James Monroe presented his famous [[Monroe Doctrine|doctrine for the western hemisphere]] in 1823. Historians have observed that while the Monroe Doctrine contained a commitment to resist colonialism from Europe, it had some aggressive implications for American policy, since there were no limitations on the US's own actions mentioned within it. Scholar Jay Sexton notes that the tactics used to implement the doctrine were "modeled after those employed by [[British Empire|British imperialists]]" in their territorial competition with Spain and France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tmp4DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT35&amp;dq=outside+in.+lord+canning&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjtu7irlYXZAhVvluAKHTawBMYQ6AEILzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Modeled%20after%20British%20imperialists&amp;f=false|title=Outside In: The Transnational Circuitry of US History|last=Preston|first=Andrew|last2=Rossinow|first2=Doug|date=2016-11-15|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780190459871|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eminent historian [[William Appleman Williams]] dryly described it as "imperial anti-colonialism." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u4GVKXN8SWYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=imperial+anti-colonialism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjwh9D97fbYAhUFTd8KHTcuC2MQ6AEIKjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=imperial%20anti-colonialism&amp;f=false|title=The Monroe Doctrine: Empire and Nation in Nineteenth-Century America|last=Sexton|first=Jay|date=2011-03-15|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|year=|isbn=9781429929288|location=|pages=2–9|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Indian Wars|Indian Wars]] against the indigenous population began in the British era. Their escalation under the federal republic allowed the US to dominate North America and carve out the 48 [[Contiguous United States|continental states]]. This is now understood to be an explicitly colonial process, as the Native American nations were usually recognized as sovereign entities prior to annexation. Their sovereignty was systematically undermined by US state policy (usually involving unequal or [[List of United States treaties|broken treaties]]) and [[Settler colonialism|white settler-colonialism.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=Walter L.|date=1980|title=United States Indian Policy and the Debate over Philippine Annexation: Implications for the Origins of American Imperialism|jstor=1887638|journal=The Journal of American History|volume=66|issue=4|pages=810–831|doi=10.2307/1887638}}&lt;/ref&gt; The climax of this process was the [[California Genocide|California genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300181364/american-genocide|title=American Genocide {{!}} Yale University Press|website=yalebooks.yale.edu|access-date=2018-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2016/08/26/california-native-americans-genocide-490824.html|title=California's state-sanctioned genocide of Native Americans|date=2016-08-17|work=Newsweek|access-date=2018-01-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of factors converged during the "[[New Imperialism]]" of the late 19th century, when the United States and the other [[great powers]] rapidly expanded their overseas territorial possessions. Some of these are explained, or used as examples for the various forms of New Imperialism.
* The prevalence of overt racism, notably [[John Fiske (philosopher)|John Fiske]]'s conception of [[British people|Anglo-Saxon]] racial superiority, and [[Josiah Strong]]'s call to "civilize and Christianize"—all manifestations of a growing [[Social Darwinism]] and racism in some schools of American political thought.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Friedman, "The Lexus and the Olive Tree", p. 381, and Manfred Steger, "Globalism: The New Market Ideology," and Jeff Faux, "Flat Note from the Pied Piper of Globalization," Dissent, Fall 2005, pp. 64–67.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Early in his career, as Assistant Secretary of the Navy, [[Theodore Roosevelt]] was instrumental in preparing the Navy for the [[Spanish–American War]]&lt;ref&gt;[[H. W. Brands|Brands, Henry William]]. (1997). ''T.R.: The Last Romantic.'' New York: Basic Books.

Roosevelt claimed that he rejected imperialism, but he embraced the near-identical doctrine of [[expansionism]]. When Rudyard Kipling wrote the imperialist poem "[[The White Man's Burden]]" for Roosevelt, the politician told colleagues that it was “rather poor poetry, but good sense from the expansion point of view." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5478/|title="The White Man's Burden": Kipling's Hymn to U.S. Imperialism|website=historymatters.gmu.edu|access-date=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roosevelt was so committed to dominating Spain's former colonies that he proclaimed his own [[Roosevelt Corollary|corollary to the Monroe Doctrine]] as justification,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.americanforeignrelations.com/E-N/Imperialism-The-roosevelt-corollary.html|title=The roosevelt corollary - Imperialism|website=www.americanforeignrelations.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; although his ambitions extended even further, into the Far East. Scholars have documented the resemblance and collaboration between US and British military activities in the Pacific at this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K_Lx0KCui5IC&amp;pg=PA509&amp;dq=walter+l.+philippine&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiR9Nn21fPYAhVjZN8KHU82DwAQ6AEIQDAF#v=snippet&amp;q=Genocidal&amp;f=false|title=The Blood of Government: Race, Empire, the United States, and the Philippines|last=Kramer|first=Paul A.|date=2006-12-13|publisher=Univ of North Carolina Press|isbn=9780807877173|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Industry and trade are two of the most prevalent motivations of imperialism. [[Banana Wars|American intervention in both Latin America and Hawaii]] resulted in multiple industrial investments, including the popular industry of [[Dole Food Company|Dole]] bananas. If the United States was able to annex a territory, in turn they were granted access to the trade and capital of those territories. In 1898, Senator [[Albert Beveridge]] proclaimed that an expansion of markets was absolutely necessary, "American factories are making more than the American people can use; American soil is producing more than they can consume. Fate has written our policy for us; the trade of the world must and shall be ours."&lt;ref&gt;Zinn, Howard. ''A People's History of the United States: 1492–2001''. New York: HarperCollins, 2003.

American rule of ceded Spanish territory was not uncontested. The [[Philippine Revolution]] had begun in August 1896 against Spain, and after the defeat of Spain in the [[Battle of Manila Bay]], began again in earnest, culminating in the [[Philippine Declaration of Independence]] and the establishment of the [[First Philippine Republic]]. The [[Philippine–American War]] ensued, with extensive damage and death, ultimately resulting in the defeat of the Philippine Republic.{{sfn|Schirmer|Shalom|1987|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=TXE73VWcsEEC&amp;pg=PA18 18], [https://books.google.com/books?id=TXE73VWcsEEC&amp;pg=PA40-41 40–41]}}&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Secretary Root's Record:"Marked Severities" in Philippine Warfare|Secretary Root's Record: "Marked Severities" in Philippine Warfare]], Wikisource (multiple mentions)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zinn|first=Howard|title= A PEOPLE's HISTORY of the UNITED STATES 1492—PRESENT|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V_h2BAAAQBAJ|year=2014|publisher=Time Apt.

The Philippines is sometimes cited as an example. After Philippine independence, the US continued to direct the country through Central Intelligence Agency operatives like [[Edward Lansdale]]. As [[Raymond Bonner]] and other historians note, Lansdale controlled the career of President [[Ramon Magsaysay]], going so far as to physically beat him when the Philippine leader attempted to reject a speech the CIA had written for him. American agents also drugged sitting President [[Elpidio Quirino]] and prepared to assassinate Senator [[Claro M.

The U.S. retained dozens of military bases, including a few major ones. In addition, Philippine independence was qualified by legislation passed by the [[U.S. Congress]]. For example, the [[Bell Trade Act]] provided a mechanism whereby U.S. import quotas might be established on Philippine articles which "are coming, or are likely to come, into substantial competition with like articles the product of the United States". It further required U.S. citizens and corporations be granted equal access to Philippine minerals, forests, and other natural resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chanrobles.com/commonwealthactno733.htm#.Uf5I7dI_vz4|title=Commonwealth Act No. 733|date=April 30, 1946|publisher=Chan Robles Law Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; In hearings before the Senate Committee on Finance, Assistant Secretary of State for Economic Affairs [[William L.

[[American exceptionalism]] is the notion that the United States occupies a special niche among the nations of the world&lt;ref name="sagehistory.net"&gt;Frederick Jackson Turner, {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080521064528/http://www.sagehistory.net/gildedage/documents/TurnerFT.html |date=May 21, 2008 |title=Significance of the Frontier }}, sagehistory.net (archived from [http://www.sagehistory.net/gildedage/documents/TurnerFT.html the original] on May 21, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; in terms of its national [[credo]], historical evolution, and political and religious institutions and origins.

Philosopher [[Douglas Kellner]] traces the identification of American exceptionalism as a distinct phenomenon back to 19th century French observer [[Alexis de Tocqueville]], who concluded by agreeing that the U.S., uniquely, was "proceeding along a path to which no limit can be perceived".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Kellner, Douglas | url=http://www.gseis.ucla.edu/courses/ed253a/american-exceptionalism.htm | title=American Exceptionalism | date=April 25, 2003 | accessdate=February 20, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060217113947/http://www.gseis.ucla.edu/courses/ed253a/american-exceptionalism.htm |archivedate = February 17, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Donald Trump]] has once said that he does not "like the term" ''American exceptionalism'' because he thinks it is "insulting the world". He told tea party activists in Texas that "If you're German, or you're from Japan, or you're from China, you don't want to have people saying that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McManus |first=Doyle |date=8 February 2017 |title=The Trumpist Future: A World Without Exceptional America |url= http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-mcmanus-american-exceptionalism-20170208-story.html |work=LA Times |access-date=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a ''[[Monthly Review]]'' editorial opines on the phenomenon, "in Britain, empire was justified as a benevolent [[The White Man's Burden|'white man's burden']]. And in the United States, empire does not even exist; 'we' are merely protecting the causes of freedom, democracy and justice worldwide."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first =Harry| last =Magdoff|author2=John Bellamy Foster|date=November 2001 | title =After the Attack ...

== Wilsonian intervention ==
[[File:American troops in Vladivostok 1918 HD-SN-99-02013.JPEG|thumb|American troops marching in [[Vladivostok]] during the [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War]], August 1918]]
When [[World War I]] broke out in Europe, President [[Woodrow Wilson]] promised American neutrality throughout the war. This promise was broken when the United States entered the war after the [[Zimmermann Telegram]]. This was "a war for empire" to control vast raw materials in Africa and other colonized areas according to the contemporary historian and civil rights leader [[W. E. B. Du Bois]].&lt;ref&gt;Zinn, Howard. ''A People's History of the United States''. New York: HarperCollins, 2003. p. 363&lt;/ref&gt; More recently historian [[Howard Zinn]] argues that Wilson entered the war in order to open international markets to surplus US production. He quotes Wilson's own declaration that
&lt;blockquote&gt;Concessions obtained by financiers must be safeguarded by ministers of state, even if the sovereignty of unwilling nations be outraged in the process... the doors of the nations which are closed must be battered down.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a memo to Secretary of State Bryan, the president described his aim as "an [[Open Door Policy|open door]] to the world".&lt;ref&gt;Zinn, pp. 359–376&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lloyd Gardner]] notes that Wilson's original avoidance of world war was not motivated by anti-imperialism; his fear was that "[[White supremacy|white civilization and its domination in the world]]" were threatened by "the great white nations" destroying each other in endless battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k6x0DgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT194&amp;dq=%22the+first+cold+war%22.+1917&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj9pYuutOXYAhXMlOAKHZy2CMcQ6AEIVDAI#v=onepage&amp;q=White%20civilization,%20domination&amp;f=false|title=Beyond 1917: The United States and the Global Legacies of the Great War|last=Zeiler|first=Thomas W.|last2=Ekbladh|first2=David K.|last3=Garder|first3=Lloyd C.|date=2017-03-27|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=9780190604035|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite President Wilson's official doctrine of [[moral diplomacy]] seeking to "make the world safe for democracy", some of his [[United States occupation of Haiti|activities at the time]] can be viewed as imperialism to stop the advance of [[democracy]] in countries such as [[Haiti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OReUQ13x4rIC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;lpg=PA31&amp;dq=wilsonian+imperialism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nQeCZqH0ta&amp;sig=wRQKuZgX7ZSlJvUHTMzCb0yxeRU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjL4rOr3efYAhUNn1MKHeSuC2cQ6AEwDXoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=wilsonian%20imperialism&amp;f=false|title=Wilsonian Idealism in America|last=Steigerwald|first=David|date=1994|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=|isbn=0801429366|location=|pages=30–42|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States invaded [[Haiti]] in July 1915 after having made landfall eight times previously. American rule in Haiti continued through 1942, but was initiated during World War I. The historian Mary Renda in her book, ''Taking Haiti'', talks about the American invasion of Haiti to bring about political stability through U.S. control. The American government did not believe Haiti was ready for self-government or democracy, according to Renda. In order to bring about political stability in Haiti, the United States secured control and integrated the country into the international capitalist economy, while preventing Haiti from practicing self-governance or democracy. While Haiti had been running their own government for many years before American intervention, the U.S. government regarded Haiti as unfit for self-rule. In order to convince the American public of the justice in intervening, the United States government used [[paternalism|paternalist]] propaganda, depicting the Haitian political process as uncivilized. The Haitian government would come to agree to U.S. terms, including American overseeing of the Haitian economy. This direct supervision of the Haitian economy would reinforce U.S. propaganda and further entrench the perception of Haitians being incompetent of self-governance.&lt;ref&gt;Renda, "Introduction," in ''Taking Haiti: Military Occupation &amp; the Culture of U.S. Imperialism, 1915–1940'', pp. 10–22, 29–34&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[World War I]], the US, Britain, and Russia had been allies for seven months, from April 1917 until the [[Bolshevik]]s seized power in Russia in November. Active distrust surfaced immediately, as even before the [[October Revolution]], British officers had been involved in the [[Kornilov Affair]] which sought to crush the Russian anti-war movement and the independent soviets.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wbxwAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA285&amp;lpg=PA285&amp;dq=general+buchanan,+moscow,+kornilov&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=T2fRfbn0qd&amp;sig=rSD01en5KTp5dY3VOgAMnrZ5FF4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiM4PPY0qjXAhWN2YMKHcLsBXIQ6AEIKTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=general%20buchanan%2C%20moscow%2C%20kornilov&amp;f=false Keith Neilson, ''Strategy and Supply (RLE The First World War): The Anglo-Russian Alliance'' (Routledge, 2014), p. 282-290]&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, once the Bolsheviks took Moscow, the British began talks to try and keep them in the war effort. British diplomat [[R. H. Bruce Lockhart|Bruce Lockhart]] cultivated a relationship with several Soviet officials, including [[Leon Trotsky]], and the latter approved the initial Allied military mission to secure the [[Eastern Front of World War I|Eastern Front]], which was collapsing in the revolutionary upheaval. Ultimately, Soviet head of state [[V.I. Lenin]] decided the Bolsheviks would settle peacefully with the [[Central Powers]] at the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]]. This separate peace led to Allied disdain for the Soviets, since it left the [[Allies of World War I|Western Allies]] to fight Germany without a strong Eastern partner. The [[British SIS]], supported by US diplomat [[Dewitt C. Poole]], sponsored an attempted coup in Moscow involving Bruce Lockhart and [[Sidney Reilly]], which involved an attempted assassination of Lenin. The Bolsheviks proceeded to shut down the British and US embassies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9X5a1fgKqewC&amp;pg=PT113&amp;dq=savinkov,+reilly%5C&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjY6Ym9iKnXAhVLSSYKHTfwCsw4HhC7BQgoMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=preparations%20began%20for%20an%20anti-Bolshevik%20coup%20in%20Moscow&amp;f=false Jeffery T.

Tensions between Russia (including its allies) and the West turned intensely ideological. Horrified by mass executions of White forces, land expropriations, and widespread repression, the Allied military expedition now [[North Russia Campaign|assisted]] the anti-Bolshevik Whites in the [[Russian Civil War]], with the British and French giving armed support to the brutal [[Kolchak, Alexander|General Alexander Kolchak]]. [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|Over 30,000 Western troops]] were deployed in Russia overall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/firstworldwar/spotlights/allies.htm "Allied Intervention in Russia, 1918-1919," The National Archives]&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first event which made Russian–American relations a matter of major, long-term concern to the leaders in each country. Some historians, including [[William Appleman Williams]] and [[Ronald Powaski]], trace the origins of the [[Cold War]] to this conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Powaski, "The United States and the Bolshevik Revolution, 1917–1933", in ''The Cold War: The United States and the Soviet Union, 1917–1991'', pp. 5–34&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views of American imperialism==

Journalist Ashley Smith divides theories of the U.S. imperialism into 5 broad categories: (1) "liberal" theories, (2) "social-democratic" theories, (3) "Leninist" theories, (4) theories of "[[super-imperialism]]", and (5) "[[Empire (Hardt and Negri book)|Hardt-and-Negri]]" theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | first = Ashley | last = Smith | title = The Classical Marxist Theory of Imperialism | conference = Socialism 2006 | date = June 24, 2006 | location = Columbia University}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=March 2017}}

There is also a conservative, anti-interventionist view as expressed by American journalist [[John T. Flynn]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The enemy aggressor is always pursuing a course of larceny, murder, rapine and barbarism. We are always moving forward with high mission, a destiny imposed by the [[Deity]] to regenerate our victims, while incidentally capturing their markets; to civilise savage and senile and paranoid peoples, while blundering accidentally into their oil wells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mises.org/books/aswegomarching.pdf|title=Books|work=Mises Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:1899BalanceCartoon.jpg|thumb|left|upright|In 1899, Uncle Sam balances his new possessions which are depicted as savage children. The figures are [[Puerto Rico]], [[Hawaii]], [[Cuba]], [[Philippines]] and "Ladrone Island" (Guam, largest of the [[Mariana Islands]], which were formerly known as the Ladrones Islands).]]

A "[[social-democratic]]" theory says that imperialistic U.S. policies are the products of the excessive influence of certain sectors of U.S. business and government—the [[arms industry]] in alliance with military and political bureaucracies and sometimes other industries such as oil and finance, a combination often referred to as the "[[military–industrial complex]]". The complex is said to benefit from [[war profiteering]] and the looting of [[natural resource]]s, often at the expense of the public interest.&lt;ref&gt;[[C. Wright Mills]], ''The Causes of World War Three'', Simon and Schuster, 1958, pp. 52, 111&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed solution is typically unceasing popular vigilance in order to apply counter-pressure.&lt;ref&gt;Flynn, John T. (1944) ''As We Go Marching.''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chalmers Johnson]] holds a version of this view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=Chalmers |title=The sorrows of empire: Militarism, secrecy, and the end of the republic |location=New York |publisher=Metropolitan Books |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alfred Thayer Mahan]], who served as an officer in the [[U.S. Navy]] during the late 19th century, supported the notion of American imperialism in his 1890 book titled ''[[The Influence of Sea Power upon History]]''. Mahan argued that modern industrial nations must secure foreign markets for the purpose of exchanging goods and, consequently, they must maintain a maritime force that is capable of protecting these [[trade routes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ws|{{cite book |year=1890 |first=Alfred Thayer |last=Mahan |title=[[s:The Influence of Sea Power upon History|The Influence of Sea Power upon History, 1660–1783]] |location=Boston, MA |publisher=Little, Brown, and Company |oclc=2553178 |at=[[s:The Influence of Sea Power upon History/Chapter I|Chapter I: Discussion of the Elements of Sea Power]]}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Jon Tetsuro |last=Sumida |title=Geography, technology, and British naval strategy in the ''dreadnought'' era |journal=Naval War College Review |volume=59 |issue=3 |date=Summer 2006 |pages=89–102 |issn=0028-1484 |url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a573630.pdf |access-date=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A theory of "super-imperialism" argues that imperialistic U.S. policies are not driven solely by the interests of American businesses, but also by the interests of a larger apparatus of a global alliance among the economic elite in developed countries. The argument asserts that [[capitalism]] in the [[North–South divide|Global North]] (Europe, the U.S., Japan, among others) has become too entangled to permit military or geopolitical conflict between these countries, and the central conflict in modern imperialism is between the Global North (also referred to as the [[core countries|global core]]) and the Global South (also referred to as the [[Third World|global periphery]]) rather than between the imperialist powers.

Following the [[United States invasion of Afghanistan|invasion of Afghanistan in 2001]], the idea of American imperialism was reexamined. In November 2001, jubilant marines hoisted an American flag over Kandahar and in a stage display referred to the moment as the third after those on [[Battle of San Juan Hill|San Juan Hill]] and [[Battle of Iwo Jima|Iwo Jima]]. All moments, writes [[Neil Smith (geographer)|Neil Smith]], express US global ambition. "Labelled a war on terrorism, the new war represents an unprecedented quickening of the American Empire, a third chance at global power."&lt;ref&gt;Neil Smith, ''American Empire: Roosevelt's Geographer and the Prelude to Globalization'', (Berkeley &amp; Los Angeles &amp; London: University of California Press, 2003), p XI-XII.&lt;/ref&gt;

Classics professor and war historian [[Victor Davis Hanson]] dismisses the notion of an American Empire altogether, with a mocking comparison to historical empires: "We do not send out proconsuls to reside over client states, which in turn impose taxes on coerced subjects to pay for the legions. Instead, American bases are predicated on contractual obligations&amp;nbsp;— costly to us and profitable to their hosts. We do not see any profits in Korea, but instead accept the risk of losing almost 40,000 of our youth to ensure that Kias can flood our shores and that shaggy students can protest outside our embassy in Seoul."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorhanson.com/articles/hanson112702.html |title=www.victorhanson.com/articles/hanson112702.html |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120713200815/http://victorhanson.com/articles//hanson112702.html |archivedate=2012-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of "proconsuls", however, has been recognized by many since the early Cold War. In 1957, French Historian, [[Amaury de Riencourt]], associated the American "proconsul" with "the Roman of our time".&lt;ref&gt;Cited in [[Geir Lundestad]], ''The United States and Western Europe since 1945: From 'Empire' by Invitation to Transatlantic Drift'', (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), p 112.&lt;/ref&gt; Expert on recent American history, [[Arthur M. Schlesinger]] detected several contemporary imperial features, including "proconsuls": Washington does not directly run many parts of the world. Rather, its "informal empire" was one "richly equipped with imperial paraphernalia: troops, ships, planes, bases, proconsuls, local collaborators, all spread wide around the luckless planet."&lt;ref&gt;''The Cycles of American History'', (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1986), p 141.&lt;/ref&gt; "The [[Supreme Allied Commander]], always an American, was an appropriate title for the American proconsul whose reputation and influence outweighed those of European premiers, presidents, and chancellors."&lt;ref&gt;[[Lawrence Kaplan]], "Western Europe in 'The American Century{{'"}}, ''Diplomatic History'', 6/2, (1982): p 115.&lt;/ref&gt; US "combatant commanders&amp;nbsp;... have served as its proconsuls. Their standing in their regions has usually dwarfed that of ambassadors and assistant secretaries of state."&lt;ref&gt;[[Eliot A. Cohen]], "History and the Hyperpower", ''Foreign Affairs'', 83/4, (2004): p 60-61.&lt;/ref&gt; Harvard Historian [[Niall Ferguson]] calls [[Unified Combatant Command|the regional combatant commanders]], among whom the whole globe is divided, the "pro-consuls" of this "imperium".&lt;ref&gt;''Colossus: The Rise and Fall of the American Empire'', (New York: Penguin Books, 2005), p 17.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Günter Bischof]] calls them "the all powerful proconsuls of the new American empire. Like the proconsuls of Rome they were supposed to bring order and law to the unruly and anarchical world".&lt;ref&gt;Günter Bischof, "Empire Discourses: The 'American Empire' in Decline?" ''Kurswechsel'', 2, (2009): p 18, http://www.beigewum.at/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009_2_014-23.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2000, ''Washington Post'' reporter [[Dana Priest]] published a series of articles whose central premise was Combatant Commanders' inordinate amount of political influence within the countries in their areas of responsibility. They "had evolved into the modern-day equivalent of the Roman Empire’s proconsuls—well-funded, semi-autonomous, unconventional centers of US foreign policy".&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Andrew Feickert, "The Unified Command Plan and Combatant Commands: Background and Issues for Congress", (Congressional Research Service, Washington: White House, 2013), p 59, https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/R42077.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans often preferred to exercise power through friendly client regimes, rather than direct rule: "until Jay Garner and L. Paul Bremer became US proconsuls in Baghdad, that was the American method too".&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Freedland]], "Bush's Amazing Achievement", ''The New York Review of Books'', (June 14, 2007), http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2007/06/14/bushs-amazing-achievement/&lt;/ref&gt;

Another distinction of [[Victor Davis Hanson]]—that US bases, contrary to the legions, are costly to America and profitable for their hosts—expresses the American view. The hosts express a diametrically opposite view. Japan pays for 25,000 Japanese working on US bases. 20% of those workers provide entertainment: a list drawn up by the Japanese Ministry of Defense included 76 bartenders, 48 vending machine personnel, 47 golf course maintenance personnel, 25 club managers, 20 commercial artists, 9 leisure-boat operators, 6 theater directors, 5 cake decorators, 4 bowling alley clerks, 3 tour guides and 1 animal caretaker. Shu Watanabe of the [[Democratic Party of Japan]] asks: "Why does Japan need to pay the costs for US service members' entertainment on their holidays?"&lt;ref&gt;Cited in George R. Packard, "The United States-Japan Security Treaty at 50", ''Foreign Affairs'', 89/2, (2010): pp. 98–99.&lt;/ref&gt; One research on host nations support concludes:
{{Quote|
At an alliance-level analysis, case studies of South Korea and Japan present that the necessity of the alliance relationship with the US and their relative capabilities to achieve security purposes lead them to increase the size of direct economic investment to support the US forces stationed in their territories, as well as to facilitate the US global defense posture. In addition, these two countries have increased their political and economic contribution to the US-led military operations beyond the geographic scope of the alliance in the post-Cold War period&amp;nbsp;... Behavioral changes among the US allies in response to demands for sharing alliance burdens directly indicate the changed nature of unipolar alliances. In order to maintain its power preponderance and primacy, the unipole has imposed greater pressure on its allies to devote much of their resources and energy to contributing to its global defense posture&amp;nbsp;... [It] is expected that the systemic properties of unipolarity–non-structural threat and a power preponderance of the unipole–gradually increase the political and economic burdens of the allies in need of maintaining alliance relationships with the unipole.&lt;ref&gt;Sung Woo Kim, "System Polarities and Alliance Politics", (PhD thesis, University of Iowa, 2012), pp. 149–151, http://ir.uiowa.edu/etd/3482&lt;/ref&gt;}}

"When writing about American foreign policy for a lay audience, however, Hanson himself chose to castigate Roman imperialism in order to portray the modern United States as different from—and superior to—the Roman state."&lt;ref&gt;Eric Adler, "Post-9/11 Views of Rome and the Nature of 'Defensive Imperialism{{'"}}, ''International Journal of the Classical Tradition'', 15/4, (2008): p. 593.&lt;/ref&gt; As a supporter of a hawkish unilateral American foreign policy, Hanson's "distinctly negative view of Roman imperialism is particularly noteworthy, since it demonstrates the importance a contemporary supporter of a hawkish American foreign policy places on criticizing Rome".&lt;ref&gt;Eric Adler 2008, p 593.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Annexation]] is a crucial instrument in the expansion of a nation, due to the fact that once a territory is annexed it must act within the confines of its superior counterpart. The United States Congress' ability to annex a foreign territory is explained in a report from the Congressional Committee on Foreign Relations, "If, in the judgment of Congress, such a measure is supported by a safe and wise policy, or is based upon a natural duty that we owe to the people of Hawaii, or is necessary for our national development and security, that is enough to justify annexation, with the consent of the recognized government of the country to be annexed."&lt;ref&gt;United States. Cong. Senate. Committee on Foreign Relations. Annexation of Hawaii. Comp. Davis. 55th Cong., 2nd sess. S. Rept. 681. Washington, D.C.: G.P.O., 1898. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to annexing a territory, the American government still held immense power through the various legislations passed in the late 1800s. The Platt Amendment was utilized to prevent Cuba from entering into any agreements with foreign nations, and also granted the Americans the right to build naval stations on their soil.&lt;ref name="Pérez, Louis A 1998"&gt;Pérez, Louis A. ''The War of 1898: The United States and Cuba in History and Historiography''. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina, 1998.

When asked on April 28, 2003, on [[Al Jazeera]] whether the United States was "empire building", Secretary of Defense [[Donald Rumsfeld]] replied, "We don't seek empires, we're not imperialistic.

However, historian [[Donald W.

The U.S. policies towards the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] he said were "designed to remold them into a people more appropriately conformed to imperial desires".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Meinig |first= Donald W. |authorlink= Donald W.

Writers and academics of the early 20th century, like [[Charles A. Beard]], in support of [[non-interventionism]] (sometimes referred to as "[[American isolationism|isolationism]]"), discussed American policy as being driven by self-interested expansionism going back as far as the writing of the Constitution. Some politicians today do not agree. [[Pat Buchanan]] claims that the modern United States' drive to empire is "far removed from what the Founding Fathers had intended the young Republic to become."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Buchanan, Pat |authorlink=Pat Buchanan| title=[[A Republic, Not an Empire: Reclaiming America's Destiny]]| publisher=Regnery Publishing|location=Washington, DC | year=1999 | isbn=0-89526-272-X}} p.

Since 2001,&lt;ref&gt;Emmanuel Todd, ''After the Empire. The Breakdown of the American Order'', 2001, (tr. Delogu, C.

Instead, the USA is going to become just one of the major regional powers along with European Union, China, Russia, etc. Reviewing Todd's ''[[After the Empire]]'', [[G.

=== Cultural imperialism ===
[[File:McDonalds in St Petersburg 2004.JPG|thumb|McDonald's in [[Saint Petersburg]], Russia]]
Some critics of imperialism argue that military and [[cultural imperialism]] are interdependent. American [[Edward Said]], one of the founders of [[post-colonialism|post-colonial theory]], said that,

{{quote|...&amp;nbsp;so influential has been the discourse insisting on American specialness, altruism and opportunity, that imperialism in the United States as a word or ideology has turned up only rarely and recently in accounts of the United States culture, politics and history. But the connection between imperial politics and culture in [[North America]], and in particular in the United States, is astonishingly direct.&lt;ref name="Said"&gt;Said, Edward. {{cite web|url=http://www.zmag.org/zmag/articles/barsaid.htm |title=Culture and Imperialism, speech at York University, Toronto, February&amp;nbsp;10,&amp;nbsp;1993. |accessdate=2006-02-23 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20010917140537/http://www.zmag.org/zmag/articles/barsaid.htm |archivedate=2001-09-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

International relations scholar David Rothkopf disagrees and argues that cultural imperialism is the innocent result of [[globalization]], which allows access to numerous U.S. and Western ideas and products that many non-U.S. and non-Western consumers across the world voluntarily choose to consume.&lt;ref&gt;Rothkopf, David [http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/protected/rothkopf.html In Praise of Cultural Imperialism?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119145355/http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/protected/rothkopf.html |date=2012-01-19 }} Foreign Policy, Number 107, Summer 1997, pp. 38–53&lt;/ref&gt; [[Matthew Fraser (journalist)|Matthew Fraser]] has a similar analysis, but argues further that the global cultural influence of the U.S. is a good thing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Fraser, Matthew | title=Weapons of Mass Distraction: [[Soft Power]] and American Empire | year=2005 | publisher=St. Martin's Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nationalism]] is the main process through which the government is able to shape public opinion. [[Propaganda]] in the media is strategically placed in order to promote a common attitude among the people. Louis A. Perez Jr. provides an example of propaganda used during the war of 1898, "We are coming, Cuba, coming; we are bound to set you free! We are coming from the mountains, from the plains and inland sea! We are coming with the wrath of God to make the Spaniards flee! We are coming, Cuba, coming; coming now!"&lt;ref name="Pérez, Louis A 1998" /&gt;

[[Progressivism in the United States|American progressives]] have been accused of engaging in cultural imperialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/417556/new-cultural-imperialism-josh-craddock|title=The New Cultural Imperialism|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/the-missionary-zeal-of-the-new-progressive-imperialism-140064/|title=The Missionary Zeal of the New Progressive Imperialism|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, many other countries with American brands have incorporated themselves into their own local culture. An example of this would be the self-styled "Maccas", an Australian derivation of "McDonald's" with a tinge of Australian culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mcdonalds.com.au/about-maccas/maccas-story|title=Our Story {{!}} About Macca's {{!}} McDonald's AU|website=mcdonalds.com.au|access-date=2016-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While territories such as [[Guam]], the [[United States Virgin Islands]], the [[Northern Mariana Islands]], [[American Samoa]] and [[Puerto Rico]] remain under U.S. control, the U.S. allowed many of its overseas territories or occupations to gain independence after [[World War II]].

[[File:Roosevelt monroe Doctrine cartoon.jpg|thumb|upright|Political cartoon depicting [[Theodore Roosevelt]] using the [[Monroe Doctrine]] to keep European powers out of the [[Dominican Republic]].]]
One of the earliest historians of American Empire, [[William Appleman Williams]], wrote, "The routine lust for land, markets or security became justifications for noble rhetoric about prosperity, liberty and security."&lt;ref&gt;William Appleman Williams, "Empire as a Way of Life: An Essay on the Causes and Character of America's Present Predicament Along with a Few Thoughts About an Alternative" (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1996), S1.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Max Boot]] defends U.S. imperialism by claiming: "U.S. imperialism has been the greatest force for good in the world during the past century. It has defeated communism and Nazism and has intervened against the Taliban and Serbian ethnic cleansing."&lt;ref name="maxboot_2003-05-06"&gt;{{cite news |author=Max Boot |url=http://www.cfr.org/iraq/american-imperialism-no-need-run-away-label/p5934 |title=American Imperialism?

It is also made by some liberal [[War Hawk|hawks]], such as political scientist [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]] and [[Michael Ignatieff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Heer, Jeet | title=Operation Anglosphere |work=Boston Globe | url=http://www.jeetheer.com/politics/anglosphere.htm | date=March 23, 2003 | accessdate=October 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British historian [[Niall Ferguson]] argues that the United States is an empire and believes that this is a good thing: "What is not allowed is to say that the United States is an empire and that this might not be wholly bad."&lt;ref&gt;"The Unconscious Colossus: Limits of (Alternatives to) American Empire", ''Daedalus'', 134/2, (2005): p 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Ferguson has drawn parallels between the [[British Empire]] and the imperial role of the United States in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, though he describes the United States' political and social structures as more like those of the [[Roman Empire]] than of the British. Ferguson argues that all of these empires have had both positive and negative aspects, but that the positive aspects of the U.S. empire will, if it learns from history and its mistakes, greatly outweigh its negative aspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Ferguson, Niall | title=Colossus: The Rise and Fall of the American Empire | publisher=Penguin | isbn=0-14-101700-7 | date=June 2, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2011|reason=page numbers need to be listed; article suffers from excessive [[WP:OR]]—what page says this?}}

Another point of view implies that United States expansion overseas has indeed been imperialistic, but that this [[imperialism]] is only a temporary phenomenon; a corruption of American ideals or the relic of a past historical era. Historian Samuel Flagg Bemis argues that [[Spanish–American War]] expansionism was a short-lived imperialistic impulse and "a great aberration in American history", a very different form of territorial growth than that of earlier American history.&lt;ref name="miller"&gt;{{cite book | last=Miller |first=Stuart Creighton | title="Benevolent Assimilation" The American Conquest of the Philippines, 1899–1903 | publisher=Yale University Press | year=1982 | isbn=0-300-02697-8 | url=http://www.livejournal.com/users/bailey83221/4300.html#miller |ref=harv}} p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  Historian [[Walter LaFeber]] sees the Spanish–American War expansionism not as an aberration, but as a culmination of United States expansion westward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Lafeber, Walter| title =The New Empire: An Interpretation of American Expansion, 1860–1898 | publisher=Cornell University Press| isbn =0-8014-9048-0| year = 1975 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Victor Davis Hanson]] argues that the U.S. does not pursue [[Hegemony|world domination]], but maintains worldwide influence by a system of mutually beneficial exchanges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Hanson, Victor Davis |date=November 2002 | title = A Funny Sort of Empire | journal=National Review | url = http://www.nationalreview.com/hanson/hanson112702.asp | accessdate =October 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, a Filipino revolutionary General [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] felt as though the American involvement in the Philippines was destructive, "the Filipinos fighting for Liberty, the American people fighting them to give them liberty. The two peoples are fighting on parallel lines for the same object."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Aguinaldo, Emilio |date=September 1899 | title=Aguinaldo's Case Against the United States | journal=North American Review | url= http://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/pds/gilded/empire/text9/filipino.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; American influence worldwide and the effects it has on other nations have multiple interpretations according to whose perspective is being taken into account.

[[Neoliberalism in international relations|Liberal internationalists]] argue that even though the present world order is dominated by the United States, the form taken by that dominance is not imperial. International relations scholar [[John Ikenberry]] argues that international institutions have taken the place of empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Ikenberry, G. John | date=March–April 2004 | title=Illusions of Empire: Defining the New American Order | journal=Foreign Affairs | url=http://fullaccess.foreignaffairs.org/20040301fareviewessay83212a/g-john-ikenberry/illusions-of-empire-defining-the-new-american-order.html | access-date=2006-03-06 | archive-url=https://archive.is/20120709181732/http://fullaccess.foreignaffairs.org/20040301fareviewessay83212a/g-john-ikenberry/illusions-of-empire-defining-the-new-american-order.html | archive-date=2012-07-09 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[International relations]] scholar [[Joseph Nye]] argues that U.S. power is more and more based on "[[soft power]]", which comes from [[cultural hegemony]] rather than raw military or economic force.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Joseph Nye|Nye, Joseph Jr.]] (2005). ''Soft Power: The Means to Success in World Politics''. Public Affairs. 208 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; This includes such factors as the widespread desire to emigrate to the United States, the prestige and corresponding high proportion of foreign students at U.S. universities, and the spread of U.S. styles of popular music and cinema. Mass immigration into America may justify this theory, but it is hard to know for sure whether the United States would still maintain its prestige without its military and economic superiority.

The party was founded on 13 January 2014 and registered with the [[Union Election Commission|election commission]] on 6 March 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moi.gov.mm/Moi:Eg/announcement/7/03/2014/id-1159 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140415231404/http://www.moi.gov.mm/Moi:Eg/announcement/7/03/2014/id-1159 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=15 April 2014 |title=Rakhine National Party allowed as political party &amp;#124; Ministry Of Information |publisher=Moi.gov.mm |date=6 March 2014 |accessdate=14 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moi.gov.mm/Moi:Eg/announcement/7/03/2014/id-1160 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140415231237/http://www.moi.gov.mm/Moi:Eg/announcement/7/03/2014/id-1160 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=15 April 2014 |title=Formation of Rakhine National Party approved &amp;#124; Ministry Of Information |publisher=Moi.gov.mm |date= |accessdate=14 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="irrawaddy1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/burma/arakanese-political-parties-merge-form-anp.html |title=Arakanese Political Parties Merge to Form ANP. |publisher=Irrawaddy.org |date= |accessdate=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chairman of the ANP is Dr. [[Aye Maung]].

==History==
The [[Rakhine Nationalities Development Party]] (RNDP), led by Dr. Aye Maung, and the [[Arakan League for Democracy]] (ALD), led by [[Aye Thar Aung]], signed an agreement on 17 June 2013 to merge into a single party under the name "Arakan National Party" after more than eight months of negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Naw Say Phaw Waa|title=Rakhine parties formalise merger|url=http://www.mmtimes.com/index.php/national-news/7194-rakhine-parties-formalise-merger.html|accessdate=22 June 2013|newspaper=The Myanmar Times|date=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Myanmar general election, 2015|2015 general election]], the party contested 63 seats in [[Rakhine State]], [[Chin State]], [[Ayeyarwady Region]], and [[Yangon Region]]. The party won 10 seats in the [[Amyotha Hluttaw]], 12 in the [[Pyithu Hluttaw]], 22 in the [[Rakhine State Hluttaw]], and one party member became an [[Ethnic Affairs Minister]].&lt;ref name="irrawaddy1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bnionline.net/index.php/news/narinjara/16835-arakan-national-party-receives-official-recognition.html |title=Arakan National Party receives official recognition |publisher=Bnionline.net |date=19 March 2014 |accessdate=14 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140414085654/http://bnionline.net/index.php/news/narinjara/16835-arakan-national-party-receives-official-recognition.html |archivedate=14 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mya |first=Nang |url=http://www.dvb.no/news/newly-formed-rakhine-national-party-appoints-leadership-burma-myanmar/33197 |title=Newly formed Rakhine National Party appoints leadership &amp;#124; DVB Multimedia Group |publisher=Dvb.no |date=8 October 2013 |accessdate=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvb.no/interview/arakan-alliance-burma-myanmar/38244 |title=Arakan alliance &amp;#124; DVB Multimedia Group |publisher=Dvb.no |date=9 March 2014 |accessdate=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bnionline.net/index.php/news/narinjara/16854-sittwe-to-host-arakan-national-partys-important-meeting.html |title=Sittwe to host Arakan National Party’s important meeting |publisher=Bnionline.net |date=24 March 2014 |accessdate=14 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140414085641/http://bnionline.net/index.php/news/narinjara/16854-sittwe-to-host-arakan-national-partys-important-meeting.html |archivedate=14 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former leaders of the ALD announced on 8 January 2017 that they were splitting from the ANP and were re-registering with the Union Election Commission for the [[Myanmar general election, 2020|2020 elections]], citing internal issues and RNDP dominance in the ANP as the reasons for the split.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mon|first1=Ye|title=Eyeing 2020 comeback, Rakhine's ALD party regroups|url=http://www.mmtimes.com/index.php/national-news/24472-former-ald-prepares-to-restart-the-party.html|accessdate=11 January 2017|work=[[Myanmar Times]]|date=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ALD Members Re-Establish Party Under Same Name|last1=Myint|first1=Moe|url=http://www.irrawaddy.com/news/burma/ald-members-re-establish-party-under-same-name.html|accessdate=11 January 2017|work=[[The Irrawaddy]]|date=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 November 2017, Dr. Aye Maung tendered his resignation from the party as chairman and member, citing persistent conflicts within the top ranks of the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://frontiermyanmar.net/en/dr-aye-maung-shakes-up-rakhine-politics-again|title=Dr Aye Maung shakes up Rakhine politics, again|last=Thu|first=Mratt Kyaw|work=Frontier Myanmar|access-date=2017-12-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christian CND''' ('''CCND''') is a 'Specialist Section' of [[CND]], the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and has existed since 1960. CCND is made up of individual [[Christians]] of various denominations who oppose nuclear weapons and who campaign for peace. The organisation has an elected executive of ten members, has an office in London and publishes a journal called 'Ploughshare' four times a year. Its symbol combines the original CND sign (commonly referred to as the 'Peace' sign) with images of a cross and a dove holding an olive branch.

NOTE. College CND also used the abbreviation CCND.

==History==
Founded in 1960, chaired by [[Sidney Hinkes]] from 1964.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5094">'''[[Conflict of interest]] in the [[health care industry]]''' occurs when the primary goal of protecting and increasing the [[health]] of [[patients]] comes into conflict with any other secondary goal, especially personal gain to healthcare professionals, and increasing [[revenue]] to a healthcare organization from selling [[health care]] products and services. The public and private sectors of the [[medical-industrial complex]] have various conflicts of interest which are specific to these entities.

==Trends==
There is a lack of [[empirical evidence]] to describe the impact of conflict of interest in the health care industry.&lt;ref name="MalinaRosenbaum2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Malina|first1=Debra|last2=Rosenbaum|first2=Lisa|title=Understanding Bias — The Case for Careful Study|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=372|issue=20|year=2015|pages=1959–1963|issn=0028-4793|doi=10.1056/NEJMms1502497|pmid=25970055}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Business interests influence the direction of cancer research and the adoption of new practices in therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Friedberg|first1=M|last2=Saffran|first2=B|last3=Stinson|first3=TJ|last4=Nelson|first4=W|last5=Bennett|first5=CL|title=Evaluation of conflict of interest in economic analyses of new drugs used in oncology.|journal=JAMA|date=20 October 1999|volume=282|issue=15|pages=1453–7|pmid=10535436|doi=10.1001/jama.282.15.1453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

University projects which receive industry funding are more likely to produce research outcomes which favor their funders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blumenthal|first1=D|last2=Gluck|first2=M|last3=Louis|first3=KS|last4=Stoto|first4=MA|last5=Wise|first5=D|title=University-industry research relationships in biotechnology: implications for the university.|journal=Science|date=13 June 1986|volume=232|issue=4756|pages=1361–6|pmid=3715452|doi=10.1126/science.3715452}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017  [[systematic review]] by the [[Cochrane Collaboration]] found that pharmaceutical and medical device industry sponsored studies are more often favorable to the sponsor's product compared with studies with other sources of sponsorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lundh|first1=A|last2=Lexchin|first2=J|last3=Mintzes|first3=B|last4=Schroll|first4=JB|last5=Bero|first5=L|title=Industry sponsorship and research outcome.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=16 February 2017|volume=2|pages=MR000033|doi=10.1002/14651858.MR000033.pub3|pmid=28207928}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trend toward treating [[clinical research]] as a business has coincided with a range of problems which are likely the result of business connections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rettig|first1=RA|title=The industrialization of clinical research.|journal=Health Affairs (Project Hope)|date=2000|volume=19|issue=2|pages=129–46|pmid=10718027|doi=10.1377/hlthaff.19.2.129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Funders seek and court scientists to author papers and lend their person reputations to add credibility to research findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sponsorship, Authorship, and Accountability|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=345|issue=11|year=2001|pages=825–827|issn=0028-4793|doi=10.1056/NEJMed010093|pmc=1071574}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Physician Payments Sunshine Act]] of 2010 requires that financial relationships of physicians and teaching hospitals with manufacturers be reported and made publicly available via the [https://openpaymentsdata.cms.gov/ Open Payments Program website].

Using this Open Payments database, it was found that about 64% of US-based physician-editors of highly-cited [[medical journal]]s received industry-associated payments (i.e., payments from medical drug and device companies) during a period spanning August 1, 2013 to December 31, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wong|first1=VSS|last2=Avalos|first2=LN|last3=Callaham|first3=ML|title=Industry payments to physician journal editors|journal=PeerJ Preprints|date=October 20, 2017|volume=5|page=e3359v1|url=https://peerj.com/preprints/3359v1/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1733">'''Cumann na Saoirse''' (''The League for Freedom'') was an [[Irish republican]] women's organisation formed in [[Dublin]] in 1922, following a split in [[Cumann na mBan]]. 

==History==
On 7 January 1922 the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] was approved by the [[Second Dáil]] by a close vote of 64–57. On 5 February a convention was held to discuss this, and 419 Cumann na mBan members voted against as opposed to 63 in favour. The Pro-Treaty women, headed by [[Jenny Wyse Power]] set up Cumann na Saoirse to replace Cumann na mBan in March 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Field Day Anthology of Irish Writing vol. 5, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; Some of those who supported the Treaty changed the name of their branches to Cumann na Saoirse, while others retained their name but gave allegiance to the Free State Government.&lt;ref&gt;Conlon, pp. 268–270&lt;/ref&gt;

DIMAR was a minority party supporting the [[Cabinet of Antonis Samaras|Samaras cabinet]] from 21 June 2012 to 21 June 2013.

==History==

===Foundation===
DIMAR was founded on 27 June 2010 when the Renewal Wing platform of the left-wing party [[Synaspismos|Synaspismós]], a component of the [[Syriza|Coalition of the Radical Left]] (Syriza)—among them MPs [[Fotis Kouvelis]], [[Thanasis Leventis]], [[Nikos Tsoukalis]], and [[Grigoris Psarianos]]—exited Synaspismós at its 6th congress. They were joined by more than 550 individuals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_politics_2_10/06/2010_117580 "Syriza split creates new party"], Kathimerini English Edition, 10 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; At a subsequent national conference of the Renewal Wing, 170 members were elected to national policy committee of the new party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enet.gr/?i=issue.el.home&amp;date=28/06/2010&amp;id=177787|title="Δημοκρατική Αριστερά" με κριτική προς όλους - Έντυπη Έκδοση - Έντυπη Έκδοση Ελευθεροτυπίας|website=www.enet.gr|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first conference of DIMAR was held on 31 March – 3 April 2011. It elected [[Fotis Kouvelis]] as the party's leader with 97.31% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.kathimerini.gr/4dcgi/_w_articles_kathbreak_2_03/04/2011_386043 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120722015905/http://portal.kathimerini.gr/4dcgi/_w_articles_kathbreak_2_03/04/2011_386043 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=22 July 2012 |title=Εκλογή Κουβέλη στην προεδρία της Δημοκρατικής Αριστεράς  (Kouvelis elected president of Democratic Left) |date=3 April 2011 |publisher=''[[Kathimerini]]'' |language=Greek }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 March 2012, six MPs from the [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]] (PASOK) joined the party,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-typos.com/Post.aspx?id=10543&amp;title=%25CE%25A3%25CF%2584%25CE%25B7%2520%25CE%2594%25CE%2597%25CE%259C%25CE%2591%25CE%25A1%252C%25206%2520%25CF%2580%25CF%2581%25CF%258E%25CE%25B7%25CE%25BD%2520%25CE%25B2%25CE%25BF%25CF%2585%25CE%25BB%25CE%25B5%25CF%2585%25CF%2584%25CE%25AD%25CF%2582%2520%25CF%2584%25CE%25BF%25CF%2585%2520%25CE%25A0%25CE%2591%25CE%25A3%25CE%259F%25CE%259A%2520|title=Στη ΔΗΜΑΡ, 6 πρώην βουλευτές του ΠΑΣΟΚ  (6 ex-PASOK MP's to DIMAR)|date=20 March 2012|publisher=''[[Eleftheros Typos]]''|language=Greek}}&lt;/ref&gt; which raised the number of Democratic Left MPs to 10, the party was eligible to form a parliamentary group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_22/03/2012_434248|title=Arrival of new MPs gives Democratic Left parliamentary group|date=22 March 2012|publisher=''[[Kathimerini]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The minor party [[Free Citizens]] also joined the Democratic Left on 22 March 2012.

===2012 elections and governing coalition===
In the [[Greek legislative election, May 2012|May 2012 legislative election]] DIMAR received 386,116 votes (6.1%) and elected 19 MPs in the Greek Parliament, making it the seventh biggest party in the Hellenic Parliament. In the [[Greek legislative election, June 2012|June 2012 legislative election]], the DIMAR won 6.3% of the vote and 17 seats, making it the sixth largest party by seat count. It joined the Samaras cabinet with [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] (ND) and PASOK.

In November 2012, the party decided to vote abstained/present to the labor market reform and "Midterm fiscal plan 2013-16" as part of the [[sixth austerity package (Greece)|sixth austerity package]] negotiated with the Troika,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_08/11/2012_468997|title=Greek Parliament passes new austerity package with tiny majority |publisher=Kathimerini (English edition)|date=8 November 2012|accessdate=8 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kathimerini.gr/4dcgi/_w_articles_kathremote_1_08/11/2012_468974|script-title=el:"Ναι" στο πολυνομοσχέδιο από τη Βουλή|language=Greek |publisher=Kathimerini|date=8 November 2012|accessdate=8 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; while they cast a supportive vote for the "Fiscal budget 2013".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_12/11/2012_469548|title=Greek coalition wins budget vote comfortably, waits for loan tranche |publisher=Kathimerini (English edition)|date=12 November 2012|accessdate=12 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the party did not vote directly against the crucial reforms, it was afterwords possible to continue being a part of the three-party coalition government with New Democracy and PASOK. Following this political line however came at the price. Three of its MPs voted against the party line on the reforms, and consequently were asked to leave the party, thus reducing the party's number of MPs from 17 to 14. Democratic Left’s political charter has no paragraphs enabling for the exclusion of MPs from the party, but the three MPs being asked to leave were expected to follow the request, as they fundamentally disagreed with the party's political line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.athens24.com/news-article.html?news_id=2014|title=Democratic Left MP leaves party, goes independent |publisher=Athens24.com|date=23 October 2012|accessdate=12 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_08/11/2012_469185|title=Upheaval in coalition parties after departures|publisher=Kathimerini (English edition)|date=8 November 2012|accessdate=10 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2013, two former Democratic Left MPs, [[Odysseas Voudouris]] and [[Paris Moutsinas]], were expelled from DIMAR's parliamentary group after having voted against the coalition government's [[seventh austerity package (Greece)|seventh austerity package]].&lt;ref name="smallmaj"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.athensnews.gr/portal/8/58735|title=Small majority for austerity raises big doubts (in English)|publisher=[[Athens News]]|date=24 March 2013|accessdate=24 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130125051055/http://www.athensnews.gr/portal/8/58735|archivedate=25 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They announced to form a new party, stating in a letter to party leader [[Fotis Kouvelis]] that their former party had "mutated" into a centrist one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enetenglish.gr/?i=news.en.politics&amp;id=488|title=Former Democratic Left MPs announce new movement|publisher=enetenglish.gr|date=1 April 2013|accessdate=17 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Back in opposition===
On 21 June 2013, DIMAR left the governing coalition with ND and PASOK in protest of the unilateral closure of the state broadcasting corporation, [[Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation]] (ERT) which was opposed by both DIMAR and PASOK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/21/democratic-left-withdraws-greek-coalition|title=Democratic  Left withdraws from Greek coalition government|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=21 June 2013|accessdate=23 June 2013|location=London|first=Helena|last=Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt; The withdrawal left Samaras with a tiny majority with 153 New Democracy/PASOK MPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_21/06/2013_505319|title=Greece coalition partner pulls out ministers in wake of ERT debacle [update] - Kathimerini|publisher=|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (Greece)|2014 European elections]] on 25 May 2014, DIMAR's vote collapsed, with the party receiving less than one fifth of the popular support it had in the national elections two years before (1.20%, down from 6.25%) and failing to win any seats in the [[European Parliament]].

===2015 legislative elections===
On 4 January 2015 DIMAR announced it would contest the upcoming election in cooperation with the [[Greens (Greece)|Greens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.efsyn.gr/arthro/prasinoi-dimokratiki-aristera-psifodeltio-tis-dimar |title="Πράσινοι - Δημοκρατική Αριστερά" το ψηφοδέλτιο της ΔΗΜΑΡ |author= |date=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Greek legislative election, January 2015|25 January 2015 legislative election]], the joint electoral list received a mere 0.49% of the vote, thus failing to return any DIMAR MPs to the [[Hellenic Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ekloges.ypes.gr/current/v/public/index.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150126122621/http://ekloges.ypes.gr/current/v/public/index.htm |archivedate=2015-01-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 August 2015, ahead of the forthcoming September snap election, PASOK announced an electoral pact with DIMAR, named the [[Democratic Coalition (Greece, 2015)|Democratic Coalition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/201034/article/ekathimerini/news/pasok-seals-vote-pact-with-dimar|title=PASOK seals vote pact with DIMAR - Kathimerini|publisher=|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greece.greekreporter.com/2015/08/30/pasok-and-dimar-cooperation-in-greek-elections/|title=PASOK and DIMAR Cooperation in Greek Elections - GreekReporter.com|website=greece.greekreporter.com|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Greek legislative election, September 2015|September 2015 legislative election]] on 20 September 2015, the PASOK–DIMAR list received 6.3% of the vote, and returned 17 seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greece.greekreporter.com/2015/09/21/greek-elections-official-final-results/|title=Greek Elections: Official Final Results - GreekReporter.com|website=greece.greekreporter.com|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eduardo Chivambo Mondlane''' (20 June 1920&amp;nbsp;– 3 February 1969) served as the founding President of the [[Mozambican Liberation Front]] ([[FRELIMO]]) from 1962, the year that FRELIMO was founded in [[Tanzania]], until his assassination in 1969. He was an anthropologist by profession but worked as a history and sociology professor at Syracuse University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/people/eduardo-mondlane-0 |title=Eduardo Mondlane &amp;#124; South African History Online |publisher=Sahistory.org.za |date= |accessdate=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
The fourth of 16 sons of a [[tribe|tribal]] chief of the [[Bantu languages|Bantu]]-speaking [[Tsonga people|Tsonga]], Mondlane was born in "N'wajahani", district of [[Manjacaze|Mandlakazi]] in the province of [[Gaza Province|Gaza]],"&lt;ref&gt;Cossa, Jose. 2012. "Reviving the Memory of Eduardo Mondlane in Syracuse: Links between Syracuse and a Mozambican Liberation Leader," ''Peace Newsletter'' #819 (November–December), pp. 11–12. Syracuse Peace Council.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Portuguese East Africa]] ([[Mozambique]]) in 1920. He worked as a shepherd until the age of 12. He attended several different primary schools before enrolling in a Swiss–[[Presbyterian]] school near Manjacaze. However, he ended his secondary education in the same organisation's church school at [[Lemana College]] at {{Proper name|Njhakanjhaka}} Village above Elim Hospital in the [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]], South Africa. He also worked for a while as a teacher at nearby Shirley Primary School at Shirley Village near the township of [[Waterval]], above Elim Hospital. He then spent one year at the [[Jan H. Hofmeyr School of Social Work]] before enrolling in [[Witwatersrand University]] in [[Johannesburg]] but was expelled from South Africa after only a year, in 1949, following the rise of the [[Apartheid]] government. In June 1950 Mondlane entered the [[University of Lisbon]], at [[Lisbon]], the capital of Portugal. By Mondlane's request he was transferred to the United States, where he entered [[Oberlin College]] in Ohio at the age of 31, under a Phelps Stokes scholarship. Mondlane enrolled at Oberlin College in [[Oberlin, Ohio]], in 1951, starting as a junior, and in 1953 he obtained a degree in anthropology and sociology. He continued his studies at [[Northwestern University]] in Evanston, Illinois. Mondlane earned an MA and a PhD from Northwestern University and married [[Janet Mondlane|Janet Rae Johnson]], a white American woman from [[Indiana]] who then lived in the Chicago suburbs.&lt;ref name="oberlin1" /&gt;

==Anthropology career==
Mondlane began working in 1957 as research officer in the Trusteeship Department of the United Nations which enabled him to travel to Africa.&lt;ref name="oberlin1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oberlin.edu/alummag/oampast/oam_spring98/Alum_n_n/eduardo.html |title=Eduardo Chivambo Mondlane '53 |publisher=Oberlin.edu |date= |accessdate=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned from his post that year to be allowed to participate in political activism which his UN post did not allow. He became an Assistant Professor of Anthropology at Syracuse University and helped develop the East African Studies Program there. In 1963, he resigned from his post at Syracuse to move to Tanzania to fully engage in the liberation struggle.&lt;ref name="oberlin1"/&gt;

==Political activism==
After graduation, Eduardo Mondlane became a United Nations official. One of [[António de Oliveira Salazar]]'s most important advisers, [[Adriano Moreira]], a political science professor who had been appointed to the post of Portugal's Minister of the Overseas (''Ministro do Ultramar''), met Mondlane at the United Nations when both were working there and, recognising his qualities, tried to bring him to the Portuguese side by offering to him a post in [[Portuguese Mozambique]]'s administration. However, Mondlane showed little interest in the offer and later joined the Mozambican pro-independence movements in Tanzania, who lacked a credible leader.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Maxwell, ''The Making of Portuguese Democracy'', Cambridge University Press, 1995, {{ISBN|0-521-58596-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-58596-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962 Mondlane was elected president of the newly formed [[FRELIMO|Mozambican Liberation Front]] (''Frente de Libertação de Moçambique'' or FRELIMO), which was composed of elements from smaller [[Independence|independentist]] groups. In 1963 he settled FRELIMO headquarters outside of Mozambique in [[Dar-es-Salaam]], Tanzania. Supported both by several Western countries and the [[USSR]], as well as by many African states, FRELIMO began a [[guerrilla war]] in 1964 to obtain Mozambique's independence from Portugal. In FRELIMO's early years, its leadership was divided: the faction led by Mondlane wanted not merely to fight for independence but also for a change to a socialist society; [[Marcelino dos Santos|dos Santos]], [[Samora Machel|Machel]] and [[Joaquim Chissano|Chissano]] and a majority of the Party's Central Committee shared this view. Their opponents, prominent among whom were [[Lazaro Nkavandame|Nkavandame]] and [[Uria Simango|Simango]], wanted independence, but not a fundamental change in social relations: essentially the substitution of a black elite for the white elite. The socialist position was approved by the Second Party Congress, held in July 1968; Mondlane was re-elected party President, and a strategy of protracted war based on support among the peasantry (as opposed to a quick ''[[coup d'état|coup]]'' attempt) was adopted.

==Death==
In 1969, a bomb was planted in a book sent to him at the FRELIMO Headquarters in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. It exploded when he opened the package in the house of an American friend, Betty King, killing him.&lt;ref&gt;João Vaz de Almada, [http://www.verdade.co.mz/component/content/article/66-especial-eduardo-mondlane/510-mocambique-tem-de-descobrir-eduardo-mondlane "Moçambique tem de descobrir Eduardo Mondlane"], ''Verdade'', 31 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The assassination remains unsolved.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://networks.h-net.org/node/28443/discussions/184680/h-diplo-article-review-707-%E2%80%9C-assassination-eduardo-mondlane|title=H-Diplo Article Review 707 on "The Assassination of Eduardo Mondlane: FRELIMO, Tanzania, and the Politics of Exile in Dar es Salaam." {{!}} H-Diplo {{!}} H-Net|website=networks.h-net.org|language=en|access-date=2017-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theories have been proposed that implicate "Mondlane’s rivals inside FRELIMO, Tanzanian politicians, international actors and the Portuguese secret service, especially [[Aginter Press]], a clandestine Portuguese anti-Communist organization."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Former PIDE Agent Oscar Cardoso claims that PIDE Agente [[Casimiro Monteiro]] planted the bomb that killed Eduardo Mondlane.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==Legacy and homages==
{{main|Mozambican Liberation Front|Mozambican War of Independence|Mozambican Civil War}}
Mondlane's death was mourned at a funeral in 1969 which was officiated by his [[Oberlin college|Oberlin]] classmate and friend the Reverend Edward Hawley, who said during the ceremonies that Mondlane "...laid down his life for the truth that man was made for dignity and self-determination."

By the early 1970s FRELIMO's 7,000-strong guerrilla force had wrested control of some countryside areas of the central and northern parts of Mozambique from the Portuguese authorities. The independentist guerrilla was engaging a Portuguese force of approximately 60,000 military, which was almost all concentrated in the area of [[Cahora Bassa]] where the Portuguese administration were finalising the construction of a major [[hydroelectric dam]], one of many facilities and improvements that the Portuguese provincial administration's development commission were rapidly developing since the 1960s. The 1974 overthrow of the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Portuguese ruling regime]] after [[Carnation Revolution|a leftist military coup]] in Lisbon, brought a dramatic change of direction in Portugal's policy regarding its overseas provinces, and on 25 June 1975, Portugal handed over power to FRELIMO and Mozambique became an independent nation.

===Eduardo Mondlane University===
In 1975, the ''Universidade de Lourenço Marques'' founded by the Portuguese and given the name of the capital of Portugal's [[Overseas Province of Mozambique]], Lourenço Marques (now [[Maputo]], Mozambique), was renamed ''[[Universidade Eduardo Mondlane]]'', or Eduardo Mondlane University.  It is still located in the capital city of independent Mozambique.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uem.mz/index.php/en/]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508233400/http://www.uem.mz/index.php/en/ |date=8 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It operates as a  [[Transnational political party|transnational party]] at a European level ([[European political party]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/parliament/expert/staticDisplay.do?language=EN&amp;id=43 |title=Political parties at European level |publisher=Europarl.europa.eu |date=29 March 2004 |accessdate=2011-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to [[Regulation (European Union)|Regulation]] (EC) No 2004/2003.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:2003R2004:20071227:EN:PDF&lt;/ref&gt; It incorporates members from both the centre-left and the centre-right of the [[political spectrum]].

The party was set up under Danish law on 7 November 2005 and founded as a European Party in [[Brussels]] on 8 November 2005. Its first congress was held on 24 February 2006. Former Danish [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]] [[Jens-Peter Bonde]] and [[Hanne Dahl]] inspired the EUD’s creation and first years. In January 2009, Swedish economist and former MEP [[Sören Wibe]] succeeded Bonde as President of the EUD. Following Wibe's sudden death in December 2010, former Irish Green MEP [[Patricia McKenna]] was named president of the EUD and [[Lave Knud Broch]] from [[People's Movement against the EU]] as vice president.

The EUD’s platform is not concerned with matters of right or left wing ideology because it believes that such issues are best considered by national and regional parliaments under their citizens’ democratic control. It is committed to enhancing transparency, subsidiarity, diversity and most importantly budget control in the European Union.

In 2009, four of its affiliated MEPs were members of the [[Independence/Democracy|Independence and Democracy group]] in the [[European Parliament]]. Also, two affiliated MEPs - [[Roger Helmer]] and [[Daniel Hannan]], both British Conservatives - sat as independents.  Hannan left EUD in October 2009 to join the newly formed [[Alliance of European Conservatives and Reformists]], while Helmer defected from the British Conservatives to British party UKIP. From 2010 to 2014 EUD had one member in the European Parliament: [[Rina Ronja Kari]] (replaced [[Søren Søndergaard (politician)|Søren Søndergaard]] 5 February 2014), who sits as an associate member of the [[European United Left/Nordic Green Left]] Group. In the 2014 European Parliament elections two EUD members [[Rina Ronja Kari]] and [[Iveta Grigule]] were elected.

Ten members of national and regional parliaments from ten countries are also members of the EUD.(2014)

== Political platform ==

The political aim of the EUDemocrats is to reform the present structures of the European Union. According to its political platform,&lt;ref&gt;EUD Political Platform http://www.eudemocrats.org/eud/content.php?id=18&lt;/ref&gt; the EUD believes that decisions should be made at the lowest possible level ([[subsidiarity]]), thus giving an effective voice to the citizens of member states, regions and national minorities. It aims to unite those who are critical of the EU for its undemocratic development and its ever-more centralising political features.

The EUD is opposed to the [[centralisation]] of political power in EU institutions, and demands democratic scrutiny and control over EU institutional powers and actions by national and regional assemblies.

Its four political core objectives are:

*enhancing transparency on all political levels, especially in the EU by giving citizens insight into all documents and meetings;
*strengthen real subsidiarity in the EU thus taking decisions at the lowest political level possible;
*improving democracy and accountability by reforming EU institutions and structures making them function more democratically;
*defending diversity in the EU by making it possible for member states to implement politics according to their national reality and by promoting flexible cooperation instead of fixed harmonisation.

The operational aim of EUD is to act as an effective political platform and campaigning organisation which is able to influence pan-European politics towards extending democratic structures in the EU. The EUD also seeks to have candidates elected in [[European elections]] from both center-right and center-left that share its core eurorealist political ideas and thus influence politics in the European Parliament itself.

==Campaigns==

In March 2011, the EUDemocrats launched a campaign against the idea of direct-tax income for the European Union (including a tax on citizens, the banking sector, or the air traffic sector. The campaign was launched as [http://www.noeutax.com www.noeutax.com].

In an effort to bring balance to the euro debate in the Baltics, EUDemocrats has started a Latvian web information campaign at [http://www.parlatu.lv www.parlatu.lv].

'''Forced marriage''' is a marriage in which one or more of the parties is [[marriage|married]] without his or her consent or against his or her will. A forced marriage differs from an [[arranged marriage]], in which both parties presumably consent to the assistance of their parents or a third party such as a [[matchmaking|matchmaker]] in choosing a spouse. There is often a continuum of [[coercion]] used to compel a marriage, ranging from outright physical violence to subtle psychological pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sharp|first1=Nicola|title=Forced Marriage in the UK: A scoping study on the experience of women from Middle Eastern and North East African Communities|accessdate=|publisher=[[Refuge (United Kingdom charity)|Refuge]]|location=London|url=http://www.refuge.org.uk/files/1001-Forced-Marriage-Middle-East-North-East-Africa.pdf?|format=PDF|pages=6, 10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forced marriage is still practised in various cultures across the world, particularly in parts of [[South Asia]] and [[Africa]].

The [[United Nations]] views forced marriage as a form of [[human rights abuse]], since it violates the principle of the [[free will|freedom]] and autonomy of individuals. The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] states that a person's right to choose a spouse and enter freely into marriage is central to his/her life and [[dignity]], and his/her [[equality before the law|equality]] as a human being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/forcedmarriage/introduction_1.shtml |title=Ethics - Forced Marriages: Introduction |publisher=BBC |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=29 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Roman Catholic Church]] deems forced marriage grounds for granting an [[Annulment (Catholic Church)|annulment]] — for a marriage to be valid both parties must give their consent freely. The [[Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery]] also prohibits marriage without right to refuse of herself{{discuss}}&lt;!--this is very confusing--&gt; out of her parents', family's and other persons' will&lt;ref&gt;''[[Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery]]'', Article 1, (c)&lt;/ref&gt; and requires the [[marriageable age|minimum age for marriage]] to prevent this.&lt;ref&gt;''Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery'', Article 2&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, the [[Special Court for Sierra Leone]]'s (SCSL) Appeals Chamber found the abduction and confinement of women for "forced marriage" in war to be a new crime against humanity (AFRC decision).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Michael P.

In 2013, the first [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] resolution against [[child marriage|child]], early, and forced marriages was adopted; the resolution recognizes child, early, and forced marriage as involving violations of human rights which “prevents individuals from living their lives free from all forms of violence and that has adverse consequences on the enjoyment of human rights, such as the right to education, [and] the right to the highest attainable standard of health including sexual and reproductive health", and also states that "the elimination of child, early and forced marriage should be considered in the discussion of the post-2015 development agenda."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/16/india-child-marriage-un-resolution-sponsor_n_4108408.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Hunter | last=Stuart | title=Country With The Most Child Brides Won't Agree To End Forced Child Marriage | date=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reproductiverights.org/en/feature/un-takes-major-action-to-end-child-marriage|title=UN Takes Major Action to End Child Marriage|work=Center for Reproductive Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.girlsnotbrides.org/states-adopt-first-ever-resolution-on-child-marriage-at-human-rights-council/|title=States adopt first-ever resolution on child, early and forced marriage at Human Rights Council|author=Girls Not Brides|work=Girls Not Brides}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical context==
{{Further|Arranged marriage|Love marriage|Coverture|Marital power|Raptio}}
Marriages throughout history were [[arranged marriage|arranged]] between families, especially before the 18th century.&lt;ref name=jo2008&gt;Jodi O'Brien (2008), Encyclopedia of Gender and Society, Volume 1, SAGE Publications, page 40-42, {{ISBN|978-1412909167}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practices varied by culture, but usually involved the legal transfer of dependency of the woman from her father to the groom. 
The emancipation of women in the 19th and 20th centuries changed [[marriage laws]] dramatically, especially in regard to property and economic status. By the mid-20th century, many Western countries had enacted legislation establishing legal equality between spouses in [[family law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/201237/family/232344/Family-law#ref794409|title=family - kinship :: Family law|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; The period of 1975-1979 saw a major overhaul of [[family law]]s in countries such as Italy,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/note/join/2014/493052/IPOL-FEMM_NT%282014%29493052_EN.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Human Rights Council |title=United Nations, General Assembly |url=https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session20/A-HRC-20-16-Add2_en.pdf |website=www.ohchr.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An arranged marriage is not the same as a forced marriage: in the former, the spouse has the possibility to reject the offer; in the latter, they do not. The line between arranged and forced marriage is however often difficult to draw, due to the implied familial and social pressure to accept the marriage and obey one's parents in all respects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.karmanirvana.org.uk/faqs/|title=FAQ’s|work=Karma Nirvana|access-date=10 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810110150/http://www.karmanirvana.org.uk/faqs/|archive-date=10 August 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Leyla Çinibulak |title=Partner choice, arranged and forced marriages |url=https://www.huiselijkgeweld.nl/doc/publicaties/Partner%20choice_arranged_and_forced_marriages_cinibulak_2011.pdf |website=www.huiselijkgeweld.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, during the late 18th century and early 19th century, the literary and intellectual movement of [[romanticism]] presented new and progressive ideas about [[love marriage]], which started to gain acceptance in society. In the 19th century, marriage practices varied across Europe, but in general, arranged marriages were more common among the upper class. Arranged marriages were the norm in Russia before early 20th century, most of which were [[endogamous]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hutton |first=M. J. |year=2001 |title=Russian and West European Women, 1860–1939: Dreams, Struggles, and Nightmares |location= |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |isbn=0-7425-1043-3 }}; see Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; [[Child marriage]]s were common historically, but began to be questioned in the 19th and 20th century. Child marriages are often considered to be forced marriages, because children (especially young ones) are not able to make a [[informed consent|fully informed choice]] whether or not to marry, and are often influenced by their families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forwarduk.org.uk/key-issues/child-marriage|title=Eradicating child marriage in Africa - FORWARD UK|work=FORWARD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Western countries, during the past decades, the nature of marriage—especially with regard to the importance of marital procreation and the ease of [[divorce]]—has changed dramatically, which has led to less social and familial pressure to get married, providing more freedom of choice in regard to choosing a spouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/366152/marriage|title=marriage|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, forced marriage was also used to require a captive ([[slave]] or [[prisoner of war]]) to integrate with the host community, and accept his or her fate. One example is the English blacksmith [[John R. Jewitt]], who spent three years as a captive of the [[Nuu-chah-nulth people|Nootka]] people on the Pacific Northwest Coast in 1802–1805. He was ordered to marry, because the council of chiefs thought that a wife and family would reconcile him to staying with his captors for life. Jewitt was given a choice between forced marriage for himself and [[capital punishment]] for both him and his "father" (a fellow captive). "Reduced to this sad extremity, with death on the one side, and matrimony on the other, I thought proper to choose what appeared to me the least of the two evils" (p154).&lt;ref&gt;''A Narrative of the Adventures and Sufferings of John R. Jewitt, only survivor of the crew of the ship Boston, during a captivity of nearly three years among the savages of Nootka Sound: with an account of the manners, mode of living, and religious opinions of the natives.''[http://www.canadiana.org/ECO/mtq?id=328920feff&amp;doc=90038 digital full text here]&lt;/ref&gt;

Forced marriage was also practiced by authoritarian governments as a way to meet population targets. The [[Khmer Rouge]] regime in Cambodia systematically forced people into marriages, in order to increase the population and continue the revolution.&lt;ref name="Anderson_HB"&gt;{{cite book | last = Anderson | first = Natalae | chapter = Historical background | title = Memorandum: Charging forced marriage as a crime against humanity | chapterurl =http://www.d.dccam.org/Abouts/Intern/Natalae_Forced_marriage.pdf | pages = 1&amp;ndash;3 | publisher = Documentation Center of Cambodia | date = 22 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;These marriage ceremonies consisted of no fewer than three couples and could be as large as 160 couples. Generally, the village chief or a senior leader of the community would approach both parties and inform them that they were to be married and the time and place the marriage would occur. Often, the marriage ceremony would be the first time the future spouses would meet. Parents and other family members were not allowed to participate in selecting the spouse or to attend the marriage ceremony. The Khmer Rouge maintained that parental authority was unnecessary because it “w[as] to be everyone’s ‘mother and father.’”&lt;ref name="Anderson_HB" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Raptio]] is a [[Latin]] term referring to the ''large scale abduction of women'', ([[kidnapping]]) either for marriage or [[enslavement]] (particularly [[sexual slavery]]). The practice is surmised to have been common since anthropological antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenhauer, U., ''Kulturwandel und Innovationsprozess: Die fünf grossen 'W' und die Verbreitung des Mittelneolithikums in Südwestdeutschland.'' Archäologische Informationen 22, 1999,
215-239; an alternative interpretation is the focus of [[abduction of children]] rather than women, a suggestion also made for the mass grave excavated at [[Thalheim, Saxony|Thalheim]]. See E Biermann, ''Überlegungen zur Bevölkerungsgrösse in Siedlungen der Bandkeramik'' (2001) {{cite web

In the 21st century, forced marriages have come to attention in European countries, within the context of [[immigration]] from cultures in which they are common. The [[Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence|Istanbul Convention]] prohibits forced marriages. (see Article 37).&lt;ref name="coe.int"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Treaties/Html/210.htm|title=Council of Europe - Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence (CETS No. 210)|work=coe.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery==
The 1956 [[Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade, and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery]] defines "institutions and practices similar to slavery" to include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/SupplementaryConventionAbolitionOfSlavery.aspx |title=Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery |publisher=Ohchr.org |date= |accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

c) Any institution or practice whereby:
*(i) A woman, without the right to refuse, is promised or given in marriage on payment of a consideration in money or in kind to her parents, guardian, family or any other person or group; or
*(ii) The husband of a woman, his family, or his clan, has the right to transfer her to another person for value received or otherwise; or
*(iii) A woman on the death of her husband is liable to be inherited by another person;

==Istanbul Convention==
The [[Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence]], also known as the Istanbul Convention, states:&lt;ref name="coe.int"/&gt;

'''Article 32''' – Civil consequences of forced marriages

Parties shall take the necessary legislative or other measures to ensure that marriages concluded under force may be voidable, annulled or dissolved without undue financial or administrative burden placed on the victim.

'''Article 37''' – Forced marriage

1   Parties shall take the necessary legislative or other measures to ensure that the intentional conduct of forcing an adult or a child to enter into a marriage is criminalised.

2   Parties shall take the necessary legislative or other measures to ensure that the intentional conduct of luring an adult or a child to the territory of a Party or State other than the one she or he resides in with the purpose of forcing this adult or child to enter into a marriage is criminalised.

==Causes of forced marriages==
There are numerous factors which can lead to a culture which accepts and encourages forced marriages. Reasons for performing forced marriages include: strengthening extended family links; controlling unwanted behavior and sexuality; preventing 'unsuitable' relationships; protecting and abiding by perceived cultural or religious norms; keeping the wealth in the extended family; dealing with the consequences of pregnancy out of wedlock; considering the contracting of a marriage as the duty of the parents; obtaining a guarantee against poverty; aiding immigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/forcedmarriage/motives_1.shtml|title=BBC - Ethics - Forced Marriages: Motives and methods|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Reasons"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/rp-pr/cj-jp/fv-vf/fm-mf/p2.html|title=Reasons for forced marriage - Analysis of Data Collected from Field Workers - Report on the Practice of Forced Marriage in Canada: Interviews with Frontline Workers: Exploratory Research Conducted in Montreal and Toronto in 2008|work=justice.gc.ca|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==
===For victims and society===
Early and forced marriages can contribute to girls being placed in a [[cycle of poverty]] and powerlessness. Most are likely to experience mistreatment such as violence, abuse and forced sexual relations. This means that women who marry younger in age are more likely to be dominated by their husbands. They also experience poor sexual and reproductive health. Young married girls are more likely to contract [[HIV]] and their health could be in jeopardy. Most people who are forced into a marriage lack education and are often illiterate. Young ones tend to drop out of school shortly before they get married.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=@PlanUK |url=http://www.plan-uk.org/ |title=Children's charity focused on girls' rights &amp; disaster relief |publisher=Plan UK |date= |accessdate=29 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislative consequences===
Depending by jurisdiction, a forced marriage may or may not be [[void marriage|void]] or [[voidable marriage|voidable]]. Victims may be able to seek redress through [[annulment]] or [[divorce]]. In [[England and Wales]], the [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1973]] stipulates that a forced marriage is voidable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1973/18|title=Matrimonial Causes Act 1973|work=legislation.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some jurisdictions, people who had coerced the victim into marriage may face criminal charges.&lt;ref name="legislation.gov.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2011/15/contents/enacted|title=Forced Marriage etc. (Protection and Jurisdiction) (Scotland) Act 2011|work=legislation.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-27830815|title=Forced marriage law sends 'powerful message'|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/06/16/us-britain-marriage-idUKKBN0ER1MR20140616|title=UK makes forced marriage illegal as pursues campaign of 'British values'|work=Reuters UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Violence==
{{Further|Honor killing}}
Forced marriages are often related to violence, both in regard to violence perpetrated inside the marriage ([[domestic violence]]), and in regard to violence inflicted in order to force an unwilling participant to accept the marriage, or to punish a refusal (in extreme cases women and girls who do not accept the marriage are subjected to [[honor killings]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.honordiaries.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/HD-FactSheet-HonorViolenceEast.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/honourcrimes/crimesofhonour_1.shtml|title=BBC - Ethics - Honour crimes|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/bitstream/1807/17543/1/cultureofhonour.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to dowry and bride price==
{{Further|Dowry|Bride price}}
The traditional customs of [[dowry]] and [[bride price]] contribute to the practice of forced marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/slavery/modern/modern_1.shtml#section_2|title=BBC - Ethics - Slavery: Modern slavery|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session21/A-HRC-21-41_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org.fj/pdf/unp/evaw.pdf |title=Fiji World News |work=undp.org.fj |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708174234/http://www.undp.org.fj/pdf/unp/evaw.pdf |archivedate=8 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A dowry is the property or money that a wife (or wife's family) brings to her husband upon marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dowry|title=Dowry - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary|work=merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A bride price is an amount of money or property or wealth paid by the groom (or his family) to the parents of the bride upon marriage.

==Marriage by abduction==
{{Main|Bride kidnapping|Groom kidnapping}}
Marriage by abduction, also known as bride kidnapping, is a practice in which a man abducts the woman he wishes to marry. Marriage by abduction has been practiced throughout history around the world and continues to occur in some countries today, particularly in [[Central Asia]], the [[Caucasus]] and parts of [[Africa]]. A girl or a woman is kidnapped by the groom-to-be, who is often helped by his friends. The victim is often raped by the groom-to-be, for her to lose her [[virginity]], so that the man is able to negotiate a bride price with the village elders to legitimize the marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/371944.stm | work=BBC News | title=Ethiopia: Revenge of the abducted bride | date=18 June 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report/69993/ethiopia-surviving-forced-marriage|title=IRIN Africa - ETHIOPIA: Surviving forced marriage - Ethiopia - Children - Gender Issues|work=IRINnews}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pathfinder.org/publications-tools/pdfs/Causes-and-Consequesnces-of-Early-Marriage-in-the-Amhara-Region-of-Ethiopia.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=3 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130323124732/http://www.pathfinder.org/publications-tools/pdfs/Causes-and-Consequesnces-of-Early-Marriage-in-the-Amhara-Region-of-Ethiopia.pdf |archivedate=23 March 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The future bride then has no choice in most circumstances, but to accept: if the bride goes back to her family, she (and her family) will often be ostracized by the community because the community thinks she has lost her virginity, and she is now 'impure'.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/kyrgyzstan0906webwcover.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  A different form of marital kidnapping, [[groom kidnapping]], occurs in some areas where payment of a [[dowry]] is generally expected.

==Forced marriage as a way of solving disputes==
{{Further|Vani (custom)}}
A forced marriage is also often the result of a dispute between families, where the dispute is 'resolved' by giving a female from one family to the other. ''Vani'' is a cultural custom found in parts of [[Pakistan]] wherein a young girl is forcibly married as part of the punishment for a crime committed by her male relatives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newspakistan.pk/2011/10/26/vani-pain-of-child-marriage-in-our-society/ Vani: Pain of child marriage in our society] Momina Khan, News Pakistan (26 October 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Vani is a form of forced [[child marriage]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nasrullah |first=M. |last2=Zakar |first2=R. |last3=Krämer |first3=A. |year=2013 |title=Effect of child marriage on use of maternal health care services in Pakistan |journal=Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology |volume=122 |issue=3 |pages=517–524 |doi=10.1097/AOG.0b013e31829b5294 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the result of punishment decided by a council of tribal elders named ''[[jirga]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4499028.stm Forced child marriage tests Pakistan law] Barbara Plett, BBC News (5 December 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bedell |first=J.

==Widow inheritance==
{{Main|Widow inheritance|Levirate marriage}}
Widow inheritance, also known as bride inheritance, is a cultural and social practice whereby a widow is required to marry a kinsman of her late husband, often his brother. It is prevalent in certain parts of Africa. The practice of wife inheritance has also been blamed for the spread of [[HIV/AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3275451.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Africa - Kenyan widows fight wife inheritance|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In armed conflict==
In conflict areas, women and girls are sometimes forced to marry men on either side of the conflict. This practice has taken place recently in countries such as [[Syria]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Uganda]] and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. Historically, this was common throughout the world, with women from the communities of the war enemy being considered "spoils of war", who could be kidnapped, raped and forced into marriage or sexual slavery.&lt;ref name="Types of Forced Marriage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fmp-acsa.ca/types-of-forced-marriage/|title=Types of Forced Marriage|work=Forced Marriage Project - Agincourt Community Services Association|access-date=11 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141111183047/http://www.fmp-acsa.ca/types-of-forced-marriage/|archive-date=11 November 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because women were regarded as property, it seemed reasonable to see them as the chattel of the war enemy, which could now be appropriated and used by the winner.&lt;ref&gt;''International Law and Sexual Violence in Armed Conflicts'', by Chile Eboe-Osuji, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forced marriage by partner==
Forced marriage can occur in the situation where in an unmarried couple, one partner forces (through violence or threats) the other partner to enter the marriage.&lt;ref name="Types of Forced Marriage"/&gt;

==Escaping a forced marriage==
Ending a forced marriage may be extremely difficult in many parts of the world. For instance, in parts of Africa, one of the main obstacles for leaving the marriage is the [[bride price]]. Once the bride price has been paid, the girl is seen as belonging to the husband and his family. If she wants to leave, the husband may demand back the bride price that he had paid to the girl's family. The girl's family often cannot or does not want to pay it back.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.equalitynow.org/sites/default/files/Protecting_the_Girl_Child.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/sites/default/files/docs/FINALChild_Protection_in_the_Somali_Region_30511.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924095119/http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/sites/default/files/docs/FINALChild_Protection_in_the_Somali_Region_30511.pdf |archivedate=24 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Stange, Mary Zeiss, and Carol K.

==Sharia law==
{{Religious text primary|section|date=September 2015}}
{{Main|Sharia|Islamic marital jurisprudence}}
{{See also|Women in Islam|Islam and domestic violence}}

Abu Hurayrah reported that the Prophet said: "A non-virgin woman may not be married without her command, and a virgin may not be married without her permission; and it is permission enough for her to remain silent (because of her natural shyness)." [Al-Bukhari:6455, Muslim &amp; Others]
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.binbaz.org.sa/noor/10848|title=حكم إجبار البنت على الزواج - الموقع الرسمي للإمام ابن باز|website=www.binbaz.org.sa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is reported in a hadith that A'ishah related that she once asked the Prophet : "In the case of a young girl whose parents marry her off, should her permission be sought or not?" He replied: "Yes, she must give her permission." She then said: "But a virgin would be shy, O Messenger of Allaah!" He replied: "Her silence is [considered as] her permission." [Al-Bukhari, Muslim, &amp; Others]

It appears that the permission of an under-age bride is indeed necessary  for her marriage to be considered valid. Despite the fact that this opinion is held only by a minority of classical scholars, the above narrations seem to clearly make the approval of the bride a condition for a valid marriage contract.

The contract of an [[Islamic marriage]] is concluded between the guardian ([[wali]]) of the bride and bridegroom, not between bridegroom and bride if she is virgin but her permission is still necessary. The guardian (wali) of the bride can only be a free [[Muslim]].&lt;ref name="Islam, New Edition p. 27"&gt;The Encyclopaedia of Islam, New Edition, Vol. VIII, p. 27, Leiden 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shotgun wedding==
{{Slavery}}
A [[shotgun wedding]] is a form of forced marriage occasioned by an [[unintended pregnancy|unplanned pregnancy]]. Some religions and cultures consider it a [[moral imperative]] to marry in such a situation, based on reasoning that [[premarital sex]] or [[Legitimacy (family law)|out-of-wedlock births]] are sinful, not sanctioned by law, or otherwise stigmatized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2013:4&amp;version=NIRV|title=Hebrews 13:4|work=Bible Gateway}}&lt;/ref&gt; Giving birth outside marriage can, in some cultures, trigger extreme reactions from the family or community, including [[honor killing]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/honourcrimes/|title=BBC - Ethics: Honour Crimes|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mrt-rrt.gov.au/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=91cf943a-3fa6-4fce-afec-4ab2c2a356fd|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501013343/http://www.mrt-rrt.gov.au/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=91cf943a-3fa6-4fce-afec-4ab2c2a356fd|dead-url=yes|archive-date=1 May 2013|title=Wayback Machine|date=1 May 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3523123.stm | work=BBC News | title=Turkey condemns 'honour killings' | date=1 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "shotgun wedding" is an [[United States|American]] [[colloquialism]], though it is also used in other parts of the world.{{fix|tex=Is the ''term'' used in other countries, or only the social situation?}} It is based on a [[hyperbole|hyperbolic]] scenario in which the pregnant (or sometimes only "deflowered") female's father resorts to [[coercion]] (such as threatening with a [[shotgun]]) to ensure that the male partner who caused the pregnancy goes through with it, sometimes even following the man to the altar to prevent his escape. The use of violent coercion to marry was never legal in the [[United States]], although many anecdotal stories and folk songs record instances of such intimidation in the 18th and 19th centuries. Purposes of the wedding include recourse from the male for the act of impregnation and to ensure that the child is raised by both parents as well as to ensure that the woman has material means of support. In some cases, a major objective was the restoring of social [[honour|honor]] to the mother.

Shotgun weddings have become less common as the stigma associated with out-of-wedlock births has gradually faded and the number of such births has increased; the increasing availability of [[birth control]] and [[abortion]], as well as material support to unwed mothers, such as [[Elterngeld]], [[child benefit]]s, [[parental leave]], and free [[kindergarten]]s have reduced the perceived need for such measures.

==By country==
===Africa===

====Madagascar====
Forced marriage is prevalent in [[Madagascar]]. Girls are married off by their families, and often led to believe that if they refuse the marriage they will be "[[curse]]d".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unfpa.org/public/home/news/pid/12347|title=Malagasy Women Wounded by Child Marriage and its Aftermath|work=unfpa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://magnificentmadagascar.weebly.com/gender-equality-and-infant-mortality.html|title=Gender Equality and Infant Mortality|work=Magnificent madagascar}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the husband is much older than his bride, and when she becomes a widow, she is discriminated and excluded by society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanium.org/en/madagascar/|title=Children of Madagascar|work=humanium.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Malawi====
According to Human Rights Watch, [[Malawi]] has "widespread child and forced marriage" and half of the girls marry before 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/03/06/malawi-end-widespread-child-marriage|title=Malawi: End Widespread Child Marriage  - Human Rights Watch|work=hrw.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of bride price, known also as [[lobolo]], is common in Malawi, and plays a major role in forced marriage. [[Wife inheritance]] is also practiced in Malawi. After marriage, wives have very limited rights and freedoms; and general preparation of young girls for marriage consists in describing their role as that of being subordinated to the husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medcol.mw/commhealth/publications/cultural_practices_report.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=20 November 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141111184006/http://www.medcol.mw/commhealth/publications/cultural_practices_report.pdf |archivedate=11 November 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forced marriage in [[Mauritania]] takes three principal forms: forced marriage to a cousin (known as ''maslaha''); forced marriage to a rich man for the purpose of financial gain; and forced  polygamous marriage to an influential man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/5035f2ea2.html|title=Refworld - Mauritania: Prevalence of forced marriage; information on legal status, including state protection; ability of women to refuse a forced marriage|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|work=Refworld}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 a law went into effect known as the Hakkaoui law because [[Bassima Hakkaoui]] drafted it; among other things it includes a ban on forced marriage.

[[Balkissa Chaibou]] is known as one of the most famous activists against forced marriage in Niger. Chaibou was 12 when she was informed by her own mother that she was to be married to her cousin, and when she was 16, she took to the courts. With little success, Chaibou was forced to a women's shelter before she was finally able to go home where she learned of her parents changed views on forced marriage, that they were now against it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Buckley |first1=Sarah |title=The girl who said 'no' to marriage |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-35464262 |website=BBC News |date=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===
====Compensation marriage====
''Compensation marriage'', known variously as '''vanni''', '''[[swara (custom)|swara]]''' and '''sang chatti''', is the traditional practice of forced marriage of women and young girls in order to resolve tribal feuds in parts of [[Pakistan]] and [[Afghanistan]]. Although illegal in Pakistan, it is still widely practiced in Pakistan's [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa]] province.

====Afghanistan====
Forced marriage is very common in Afghanistan, and sometimes women resort to suicide to escape these marriages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.de/afghan-women-escape-marriage-through-suicide/a-16750044|title=Afghan women escape marriage through suicide|work=DW.DE}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report by [[Human Rights Watch]] found that about 95% of girls and 50% of adult women imprisoned in Afghanistan were in jail on charges of the "moral crimes" of "running away" from home or [[zina]]. Obtaining a divorce without the consent of the husband is nearly impossible in Afghanistan, and women attempting a ''de facto'' separation risk being imprisoned for "running away". While it is not socially acceptable for women and girls to leave home without permission, "running away" is not defined as a criminal offense in the Afghan Penal Code. However, in 2010 and 2011, the [[Afghan Supreme Court]] issued instructions to courts to charge women with "running away" as a crime. This makes it nearly impossible for women to escape forced marriages. The Human Rights Watch report stated that
{{quote|According to the UN, as of 2008, 70 to 80 percent of marriages in Afghanistan were forced, taking place without full and free consent or under duress.

====Nepal====
As in other parts of [[South Asia]], girls in [[Nepal]] are often seen as an economic burden to the family, due to dowry. Parents often compel young girls to marry, because older and more educated men can demand a higher dowry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.icrw.org/files/publications/Child_marriage_paper%20in%20South%20Asia.2013.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141102051903/https://www.icrw.org/files/publications/Child_marriage_paper%20in%20South%20Asia.2013.pdf |archivedate=2 November 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the [[Nepal]]ese government decided to offer a cash incentive (50,000 Nepali rupees - $641) to men for marrying [[widowed]] women. Because widows often lose social status in Nepalese society, this policy was meant to 'solve' their problems. However, many widows and human rights groups protested these regulations, denouncing them as humiliating and as encouraging coerced marriages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8153193.stm|title=BBC NEWS - South Asia - Nepal widows dismiss marriage incentive|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sri Lanka====
During the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]], a 2004 report in the journal ''Reproductive Health Matters'' found that forced marriage in [[Sri Lanka]] was taking place in the context of the armed conflict, where parents forced teenage girls into marriage in order to ensure that they do not lose their chastity (considered an increased risk due to the conflict) before marriage, which would compromise their chances of finding a husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/45f1476919.html|title=Refworld - Sri Lanka: Incidence of forced marriages and protection available to women (2004-2005)|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|work=Refworld}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forced marriages can be made because of family pride, the wishes of the parents, or social obligation. For example, according to [[Ruqaiyyah Waris Maqsood]], many forced marriages in Britain within the [[British Pakistani]] community are aimed at providing [[British citizenship]] to a member of the family currently in [[Pakistan]] to whom the instigator of the forced marriage feels a sense of duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ruqaiyyah.karoo.net/articles/arrangedm.htm|title=British Council Handout - The forced-arranged marriage abuse|work=karoo.net|access-date=12 February 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929095500/http://www.ruqaiyyah.karoo.net/articles/arrangedm.htm|archive-date=29 September 2007|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the problem of forced marriages among immigrants in the UK, the [[Forced Marriage (Civil Protection) Act 2007]] (applicable in England and Wales, and in Northern Ireland) was passed, which enables the victims of forced marriage to apply for court orders for their protection. Similar legislation was passed in Scotland: the Forced Marriage etc. (Protection and Jurisdiction) (Scotland) Act 2011&lt;ref name="legislation.gov.uk"/&gt; gives courts the power to issue protection orders.

In 2008, it was estimated that about 3000 forced marriages took place each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/mar/08/religion|title=3,000 women a year forced into marriage in UK, study finds|last=Revill|first=Jo|last2=Asthana|first2=Anushka|date=2008-03-08|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mr Justice Holman said that the girl, now 17, would have to initiate proceedings herself to have the marriage nullified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/girl-aged-14-became-pregnant-after-she-was-forced-to-marry-man-24-8922017.html|title=

Forced marriage may be practised among some immigrant communities in [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salc.on.ca/SALCO%20-%20Who,%20If,%20When%20to%20Marry%20%20-The%20Incidence%20of%20Forced%20Marriage%20in%20Ontario%20%28Sep%202013%29.pdf|title=Maryum Anis, Shalini Konanur, and Deepa Mattoo, "Who - If - When to Marry: The INcidence of Forced Marriage in Ontario"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Until recently, forced marriage has not received very much attention in Canada.  That lack of attention has protected the practice from legal intervention.&lt;ref name = "Reasons"/&gt; In 2015, Parliament enacted 2 new criminal offences to address the issue.&lt;ref&gt;''Zero Tolerance for Barbaric Cultural Practices Act'', SC 2015, c 29, ss 9, 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Forcing a person to marry against their will is now a criminal offence under the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]],&lt;ref name="laws-lois.justice.gc.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-160.html#docCont |title=Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, s 293.1 |publisher=Laws-lois.justice.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=29 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as is assisting or aiding a [[child marriage]], where one of the participants is under age 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-160.html#docCont|title=Consolidated federal laws of canada, Criminal Code|first=Legislative Services|last=Branch|website=laws-lois.justice.gc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has also been the long-standing offence of solemnizing an illegal marriage, which was also modified by the 2015 legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-161.html#docCont|title=Consolidated federal laws of canada, Criminal Code|first=Legislative Services|last=Branch|website=laws-lois.justice.gc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these criminal offences, the ''[[Civil Marriage Act]]'' stipulates: ''Marriage requires the free and enlightened consent of two persons to be the spouse of each other,'' as well as setting 16 as the minimum age for marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-31.5/page-1.html |title=Civil Marriage Act, SC 2005, c 33, ss 2.1, 2.2 |publisher=Laws-lois.justice.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=29 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2363">'''Generalitat''' ({{IPA-ca|ʒənəɾəliˈtat|lang}}, literally in English 'Generality') is the name of the systems of [[government]] of two of the present [[Autonomous communities of Spain|Spanish autonomous communities]]: [[Catalonia]] and the [[Valencian Community]]. The term is also used for the government of the semi-autonomous [[Comarques of Catalonia|''comarca'']] of [[Val d'Aran]], the ''Generalitat a l'Aran''.

''Generalitat'' refers to all three [[branches of government]], not simply the [[executive (government)|executive]]. For example, the Catalan executive is, officially, the "Government of the Generality of Catalonia" (''Govern de la Generalitat de Catalunya'': cf. Government of the Kingdom of Spain, ''Gobierno del Reino de España''), while those of the community of the Valencian Country and the Val d'Aran are known as the "Council of the Valencian Generality" (''Consell de la Generalitat Valenciana'') and the ''Síndic'' respectively.

The name ''Generalitat'' dates back to the 13th century, to the medieval courts of the ancient [[Catalonia (historic territory)|Principality of Catalonia]] and the [[Kingdom of Valencia]] respectively. The term originally referred to a delegation of members of the ''[[Parliament|Corts]]'', who oversaw the implementation of the decisions of the ''Corts'' between sessions, and is derived from the [[Catalan language|Catalan]] ''Diputació del General (de Catalunya)''. The Catalan and Valencian ''Generalitats'' were both abolished by the [[Nueva Planta decrees]], signed by [[Philip V of Spain]] at the start of the eighteenth century, and only reinstated after the death of [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] in 1975, although in Catalonia it also had a brief existence during the [[Second Spanish Republic]]. The ''Generalitat a l'Aran'' was legally created by the 2006 modification of the [[Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia]], although the Val d'Aran had also enjoyed considerable autonomy within Catalonia under the 1979 Statute of Autonomy.

==History==
Since its incorporation in 1884, the [[Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania]] has been directed by a president and board of directors. Until January 1976, the president exercised complete control of doctrines, publications and activities of the Watch Tower Society and the religious denominations with which it was connected&amp;mdash;the [[Bible Student movement|Bible Students]] and Jehovah's Witnesses.&lt;ref name=cc58 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Franz| first = Raymond| title = In Search of Christian Freedom| publisher = Commentary Press| year = 2007| pages = 186, footnote| isbn = 0-914675-17-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Penton| first = M. James| title = Apocalypse Delayed: The Story of Jehovah's Witnesses| publisher = University of Toronto Press| year = 1997| pages = 162–163, 214| isbn = 0-8020-7973-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Society's second president, [[Joseph Franklin Rutherford|J. F. Rutherford]], encountered [[Watch Tower Society presidency dispute (1917)|opposition from directors in 1917]], he dismissed them. In 1925 he overruled the Watch Tower Society's editorial committee when it opposed publication of an article about disputed doctrines regarding the year 1914. In 1931, the editorial committee was dissolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Franz| first = Raymond| authorlink = Raymond Franz| title = Crisis of Conscience| publisher = Commentary Press| year = 2007| pages = 61–62| isbn = 0-914675-23-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Penton| first = M. James| title = Apocalypse Delayed: The Story of Jehovah's Witnesses| publisher = University of Toronto Press| year = 1997| page = 59| isbn = 0-8020-7973-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1943 ''[[The Watchtower]]'' described the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society as the "legal governing body" of anointed Jehovah's Witnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|date=July 15, 1943|page=216, paragraph 24|magazine=The Watchtower}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, in an article opposing the democratic election of congregation [[elder (Christianity)|elders]], the magazine said the appointment of such ones was the duty of "a visible governing body under Jehovah God and his Christ."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|date=November 1, 1944|page=328||magazine=The Watchtower|title=Theocratic Organization in Action}}&lt;/ref&gt; For several years, the role and specific identity of the governing body remained otherwise undefined. A 1955 organizational handbook stated that "the visible governing body has been closely identified with the board of directors of this corporation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Qualified to be Ministers|publisher=Watch Tower Society|year=1955|pages=381}} cited by Raymond Franz, ''Crisis of Conscience'', page 74&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to events related to their 1957 convention, a 1959 publication said "the spiritual governing body of Jehovah’s witnesses watched the developments [then] the president of the Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society [acted]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |magazine=The Watchtower|date=February 15, 1959 |title=Divine Will International Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses |page=115 |url=https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1959123 |quote=So with intense interest the spiritual governing body of Jehovah’s witnesses watched the developments... Without delay the president of the Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society closed a contract with the owners to use the Polo Grounds simultaneously with Yankee Stadium.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1970 ''Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses'' noted that the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania was the organization used to plan the activity of Jehovah's Witnesses and provide them with "spiritual food", then declared: "So really the governing body of Jehovah's Witnesses is the board of directors of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania."&lt;ref name=1970yb&gt;{{cite book|title=Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses|publisher=Watch Tower Society|year=1970|page=65|url=https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/301970000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 1, 1971, Watch Tower Society vice-president [[Frederick William Franz|Frederick Franz]] addressed the annual meeting of the Pennsylvania corporation in [[Buckingham Township, Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Buckingham, Pennsylvania]], stating that the legal corporation of the Watch Tower Society was an "agency" or "temporary instrument" used by the Governing Body on behalf of the "[[faithful and discreet slave]]".&lt;ref name=cc57&gt;{{cite book| last = Franz| first = Raymond| authorlink = Raymond Franz| title = Crisis of Conscience| publisher = Commentary Press| year = 2007| pages = 57| isbn = 0-914675-23-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three weeks later, on October 20, four additional men joined the seven members of the Society's board of directors on what became known as a separate, expanded Governing Body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Franz, Raymond|title=Crisis of Conscience|page=44}} The seven directors at October 20 were Nathan Knorr, Fred Franz, Grant Suiter, Thomas Sullivan, Milton Henschel, Lyman Swingle and John Groh. The additional four to form the Governing Body were William Jackson, Leo Greenlees, George Gangas and Raymond Franz.&lt;/ref&gt; The board of directors had until then met only sporadically, usually to discuss the purchase of property or new equipment, leaving decisions about Watch Tower Society literature to the president and vice-president, [[Nathan Homer Knorr|Nathan Knorr]] and Fred Franz.&lt;ref name=cc57 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Testimony by Fred Franz, Lord Strachan vs. Douglas Walsh Transcript, Lord Strachan vs. Douglas Walsh, 1954, as cited by Raymond Franz, ''Crisis of Conscience'', 2007, page 75-76.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Watchtower'' of December 15, 1971 was the first to unambiguously capitalize the term "Governing Body of Jehovah's witnesses" as the defined group leading the denomination, with a series of articles explaining its role and its relationship with the Watch Tower Society.&lt;ref name=GBQfR /&gt;&lt;ref name="2gbw"&gt;{{cite magazine|date=December 15, 1971|title=Theocratic Organization with Which to Move Forward Now;A Governing Body as Different from a Legal Corporation|magazine=The Watchtower|page=749-756|url=https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1971922}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The focus on the new concept of "[[theocracy|theocratic]]" leadership was accompanied by statements that the structure was not actually new: ''The Watch Tower'' declared that "a governing body made its appearance" some time after the formation of Zion's Watch Tower Society in 1884,&lt;ref name="2gbw"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; though it had not been referred to as such at the time.&lt;ref name=cc58&gt;{{cite book| last = Franz| first = Raymond| authorlink = Raymond Franz| title = Crisis of Conscience| publisher = Commentary Press| year = 2007| pages = 58| isbn = 0-914675-23-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article stated that Watch Tower Society president Charles Taze Russell had been a member of the governing body.&lt;ref name="2gbw" /&gt; The ''1972 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses'' stated that following Rutherford's death in 1942 "one of the first things that the governing body decided upon was the inauguration of the Theocratic Ministry School" and added that the "governing body" had published millions of books and Bibles in the previous thirty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses|year=1972|pages=254–257|url=https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/301972009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former member of the Governing Body, [[Raymond Franz]], stated that the actions of presidents Russell, Rutherford and Knorr in overriding and failing to consult with directors proved the Bible Students and Jehovah's Witnesses had been under a [[Monarchy|monarchical]] rule until 1976, leaving no decisions to any "governing body".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Franz| first = Raymond| authorlink = Raymond Franz| title = Crisis of Conscience| publisher = Commentary Press| year = 2007| page = 78| isbn = 0-914675-23-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, a ''Question From Readers'' article in ''The Watchtower'' further reinforced the concept of the "Governing Body"; the magazine said the term referred to an agency that administers policy and provides organizational direction, guidance and regulation and was therefore "appropriate, fitting and Scriptural."&lt;ref name="2gbw" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=November 15, 1972|title=Questions From Readers|journal=The Watchtower|pages=703|url=https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1972847}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizational changes at the highest levels of the Watch Tower Society in 1976 significantly increased the powers and authority of the Governing Body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Franz| first = Raymond| authorlink = Raymond Franz| title = Crisis of Conscience| publisher = Commentary Press| year = 2007| pages = 44–110| isbn = 0-914675-23-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The body has never had a legal corporate existence and operates through the Watch Tower Society and its board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Penton| first = M.

===Reorganization===
After its formal establishment in 1971, the Governing Body met regularly but, according to Raymond Franz, only briefly; Franz claims meetings were sometimes as short as seven minutes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Franz| first = Raymond| title = Crisis of Conscience| publisher = Commentary Press| year = 2007| page = 45| isbn = 0-914675-23-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; to make decisions about branch appointments and conduct that should be considered disfellowshipping offenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Franz| first = Raymond| title = Crisis of Conscience| publisher = Commentary Press| year = 2007| pages = 46| isbn = 0-914675-23-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Penton| first = M. James| title = Apocalypse Delayed: The Story of Jehovah's Witnesses| publisher = University of Toronto Press| year = 1997| page = 215| isbn = 0-8020-7973-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Franz claims that in 1971 and again in 1975, the Governing Body debated the extent of the authority it should be given.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Franz| first = Raymond| title = Crisis of Conscience| publisher = Commentary Press| year = 2007| pages = 81–105| isbn = 0-914675-23-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Governing Body voted in December 1975 to establish six operating committees to oversee the various administrative requirements of the organization's worldwide activities that formerly had been under the direction of the president; furthermore, each branch overseer was to be replaced by a branch committee of at least three members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Franz| first = Raymond| title = Crisis of Conscience| publisher = Commentary Press| year = 2007| pages = 80–107| isbn = 0-914675-23-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The change, which took effect on January 1, 1976, was described in the Watch Tower Society's 1993 history book, ''Jehovah's Witnesses&amp;mdash;Proclaimers of God's Kingdom'', as "one of the most significant organizational readjustments in the modern-day history of Jehovah's Witnesses."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Jehovah's Witnesses&amp;ndash;Proclaimers of God's Kingdom|publisher=Watch Tower Society|year=1993|pages=108–109|url=https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1101993010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Headquarters purge===
In 1980, dissent arose among members of the Governing Body regarding the significance of 1914 in Jehovah's Witnesses' doctrines. According to former Witnesses James Penton and Heather and [[Gary Botting]], internal dissatisfaction with official doctrines continued to grow, leading to a series of secret investigations and judicial hearings. Consequently, dissenting members were expelled from the Brooklyn headquarters staff in the same year.&lt;ref name=penton117&gt;{{cite book| last = Penton| first = M. James| title = Apocalypse Delayed: The Story of Jehovah's Witnesses| publisher = University of Toronto Press| year = 1997| pages = 117–123| isbn = 0-8020-7973-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=botting158&gt;{{cite book| last = Botting| first = Heather &amp; Gary| title = The Orwellian World of Jehovah's Witnesses| publisher = University of Toronto Press| year = 1984 | pages = 158–165| isbn = 0-8020-6545-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ostling" /&gt; Raymond Franz claimed he was forced to resign from the Governing Body, and he was later [[Jehovah's Witnesses#Disfellowshipping|disfellowshipped]] from the group.

The Watch Tower Society responded to the dissent with a more severe attitude regarding the treatment of expelled Witnesses.&lt;ref name=penton117 /&gt;&lt;ref name=botting158 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Franz|first=Raymond|title=Crisis of Conscience|publisher=Commentary Press|year=2007|chapter=11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1997 study of the denomination, Penton concluded that since Raymond Franz's expulsion in 1980, the Governing Body displayed an increased level of conservatism, sturdy resistance to changes of policy and doctrines, and an increased tendency to isolate dissidents within the organization by means of disfellowshipping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Penton| first = M. James| title = Apocalypse Delayed: The Story of Jehovah's Witnesses| publisher = University of Toronto Press| year = 1997| pages = 219, 297–302, 319| isbn = 0-8020-7973-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Helpers===
The April 15, 1992 issue of ''The Watchtower'' carried an article entitled ''Jehovah’s Provision, the “Given Ones”'' which drew a parallel between ancient non-Israelites who had been assigned temple duties (the "[[Nethinim]]" and "sons of the servants of Solomon") and Witness elders in positions of responsibility immediately under the oversight of the Governing Body who did not profess to be "anointed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |magazine=The Watchtower|date=April 15, 1992 |title=Jehovah’s Provision, the “Given Ones” |page=16-17 |url=https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1992283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both that issue of ''The Watchtower'' and the ''1993 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses'' carried the same announcement:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In view of the tremendous increase worldwide, it seems appropriate at this time to provide the Governing Body with some additional assistance. Therefore it has been decided to invite several helpers, mainly from among the great crowd, to share in the meetings of each of the Governing Body Committees, that is, the Personnel, Publishing, Service, Teaching, and Writing Committees. Thus, the number attending the meetings of each of these committees will be increased to seven or eight. Under the direction of the Governing Body committee members, these assistants will take part in discussions and will carry out various assignments given them by the committee. This new arrangement goes into effect May 1, 1992. For many years now, the number of the remnant of anointed Witnesses has been decreasing, while the number of the great crowd has increased beyond our grandest expectations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |magazine=The Watchtower|date=April 15, 1992 |title=Announcement |page=31 |url=https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1992288}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title =1993 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses|publisher=Watchtower Bible and Tract Society|year=|page=253-254|url=https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/301993018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Each of the current Governing Body members served as a committee "helper" before being appointed to the Governing Body itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |magazine=The Watchtower|date=November 1, 1994 |title=Governing Body Addition |page=29 |url=https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1994808|quote=The new member is Gerrit Lösch. ...

===2000 and beyond===
Until 2000, the directors and officers of the Watch Tower Society were members of the Governing Body. Since then, members of the ecclesiastical Governing Body have not served as directors of any of the various [[Corporations of Jehovah's Witnesses|corporations used by Jehovah's Witnesses]], and the Governing Body has delegated such administrative responsibilities to other members of the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=The Watchtower|date=15 January 2001|page=29|title=How the Governing Body Differs From a Legal Corporation|url=https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2001051}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Committees==
The Governing Body functions by means of its six committees, which carry out various administrative functions.&lt;ref name="GB2008"&gt;{{cite magazine |magazine=The Watchtower|date=May 15, 2008 |title=How the Governing Body Is Organized |page=29 |url=https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2008367}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each committee is assisted by "helpers," who do not necessarily profess to be of the "anointed". Governing Body meetings are held weekly in closed session.&lt;ref name="GB2008"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; According to Raymond Franz, decisions of the body were required to be unanimous until 1975, after which a two-thirds majority of the full body was required, regardless of the number present.&lt;ref name=ad218&gt;{{cite book| last = Penton| first = M.

* The ''Personnel Committee'' arranges for volunteers to serve in the organization's headquarters and worldwide branch offices, which are each referred to as [[Organizational structure of Jehovah's Witnesses#Branches and zones|Bethel]]. It oversees arrangements for the personal and spiritual assistance of Bethel staff, as well as the selection and invitation of new Bethel members.
* The ''Publishing Committee'' supervises the printing, publishing and shipping of literature, as well as legal matters involved in printing, such as obtaining property for printing facilities. It is responsible for overseeing factories, properties, and financial operations of corporations used by Jehovah’s Witnesses.
* The ''Service Committee'' supervises the [[Evangelism|evangelical]] activity of Jehovah's Witnesses, which includes traveling overseers, pioneers, and the activities of congregation publishers. It oversees communication between the international headquarters, branch offices, and the congregations. It examines annual reports of preaching activity from the branches.

* The ''Teaching Committee'' arranges congregation meetings, circuit assemblies, and regional and international conventions as well as various schools for elders, ministerial servants, pioneers and missionaries, such as [[Gilead school]]. It supervises preparation of material to be used in teaching, and oversees the development of new audio and video programs.
* The ''Writing Committee'' supervises the writing and translation of all material published by the [[Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania|Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society]], including scripts for [[drama]]s and talk outlines. It responds to questions about scriptural, doctrinal, and moral issues, specific problems in the congregations, and the standing of members in congregations.
* The ''Coordinator's Committee'' deals with emergencies, disaster relief and other matters, such as investigations. It comprises the coordinators, or a representative, from each of the other Governing Body committees and a secretary who is also a member of the Governing Body. It is responsible for the efficient operation of the other committees.

==Representatives==
Initially, the Governing Body directly appointed all [[Organizational structure of Jehovah's Witnesses#Elders|congregation elders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |magazine=The Watchtower|date=November 15, 1971 |title=A “Body of Elders” with Rotating Chairmanship |page=699,700 |url=https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1971844|quote=how will the “body of elders” in each congregation be selected?

Prior to 1971, various [[Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania#Directors|Watch Tower Society directors]] were informally identified as members of the "governing body".

These eleven members are indicated in italics in the list below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=The Watchtower|date=December 15, 1971|page=762|title=A Governing Body as Different from a Legal Corporation|url=https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1971923}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=1973 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses|publisher=Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania|page=257|url=https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/301973008|quote=The Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses consists of eleven brothers, all anointed of God.

The '''Hollywood Anti-Nazi League''' (later known as the '''[[American Peace Mobilization]]''') was founded in Los Angeles in 1936 by Otto Katz and others to organize members of the [[Cinema of the United States|American film industry]] to oppose [[fascism]] and [[Nazism]].  Although it was a [[communist front organization]], run by the American [[popular front]], it attracted broad support in Hollywood from both members and nonmembers of the [[Communist Party USA]] (CPUSA).  Like many such communist front groups, it ceased all anti-Nazi activities immediately upon the signing of the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] in August 1939.

== Foundation ==

In 1936 the CPUSA ordered [[Otto Katz]] to raise funds and to found the Hollywood Anti-Nazi League (HANL).&lt;ref name=hollywoodcommies&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan Casty|title=Communism in Hollywood: The Moral Paradoxes of Testimony, Silence, and Betrayal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ciaVNi6nWowC&amp;pg=PA44|accessdate=3 June 2013|date=3 August 2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-6949-3|pages=44–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To kick off his work, Katz held a hundred-dollar-a-plate fundraising dinner, which was attended by, among others, [[Irving Thalberg]], [[Jack L. Warner]], [[David O. Selznick]], and [[Samuel Goldwyn]].  [[John Joseph Cantwell]], Cardinal of Los Angeles, was on hand to bless the proceedings.&lt;ref name=judische&gt;{{cite book|author1=Raphael Gross|author2=Yfaat Weiss|title=Jüdische Geschichte Als Allgemeine Geschichte: Festschrift Füt Dan Diner Zum 60.

Katz and his cofounder, [[Hubertus, Prince of Löwenstein-Wertheim-Freudenberg|Hubertus zu Löwenstein]],&lt;ref name=hoover&gt;{{cite book|author=John Sbardellati|title=J. Edgar Hoover Goes to the Movies: The FBI and the Origins of Hollywood's Cold War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LomlK6lYOwYC&amp;pg=PA32|accessdate=3 June 2013|date=1 May 2012|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-6468-3|pages=32–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; held an organizational meeting at the [[Wilshire Ebell Theatre]] in Los Angeles.  At the meeting, screenwriter [[Donald Ogden Stewart]] and author [[Dorothy Parker]], fellow members of the [[Algonquin Round Table]],&lt;ref name="Rampell2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ed Rampell|title=Progressive Hollywood: A People's Film History of the United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0X2oeDjwcicC&amp;pg=PA47|accessdate=3 June 2013|year=2005|publisher=The Disinformation Company|isbn=978-1-932857-10-8|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; were named respectively chairman and honorary chairman by acclamation.&lt;ref name=hollywoodcommies/&gt;

The HANL was the first American anti-Nazi organization that was not overtly linked to American Jews, and served "as the focal point of the [film] industry's anti-Nazism" from 1936 through 1939.&lt;ref name=moguls&gt;{{cite book|author=David Welky|title=The Moguls and the Dictators: Hollywood and the Coming of World War II|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UGX-QZE8lAsC&amp;pg=PA34|accessdate=3 June 2013|date=8 December 2008|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-0-8018-9044-4|page=34ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There was, in fact, friction between the League and other organized Jewish groups in Los Angeles.  For instance, The Community Relations Committee, a group which served as a "political instrument of wealthy Los Angeles Jews," seemed, according to screenwriter and League activist [[Hy Kraft]], to use most of the energy it spent interacting with the League trying to convince them to change their name to the "Hollywood Anti-Nazi Anti-Communist League."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Neal Gabler|authorlink=Neal Gabler|title=An Empire of Their Own: How the Jews Invented Hollywood|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S8MMhPYLG2sC&amp;pg=PA341|accessdate=3 June 2013|date=17 November 2010|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-77371-5|page=341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Leadership and membership ==

By 1937 the board of directors of the HANL included Jack Warner and [[Carl Laemmle]], as well as the head of the Hollywood division of the CPUSA, [[John Howard Lawson]].&lt;ref name=myrna&gt;{{cite book|author=Emily W.

== Activities ==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-S34639, Joseph Goebbels und Leni Riefenstahl crop.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Leni Riefenstahl (with [[Joseph Goebbels]]) in 1937, around the time that her visit to Los Angeles was boycotted by the Hollywood Anti-Nazi League]]
{{quote box|quote=&amp;nbsp;An anti-Nazi league has established itself in Hollywood which was termed by Vittorio Mussolini returning home from his research trip a "center of political agitation against the Fascist Idea."&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;According to recent reports, for the time being they want to support needy émigrés before launching an all-out attack, increasing the film agitation against Germany.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;After all they have worked on a film in which Charlie Chaplin caricatures the Führer and hence wanted to ridicule him.|source=From film journal ''Film-Kurier'', January 30, 1939&lt;ref name=trickfilm/&gt;| bgcolor = Cornsilk| font = Times|width=30%|align=right|title=}}
The League inaugurated its founding with a huge party at the [[Shrine Auditorium]] in Los Angeles in October 1936.  In attendance were [[Irving Berlin]], and [[Gale Sondergaard]]. Los Angeles mayor [[Frank L. Shaw|Frank Shaw]] gave a speech, as did [[Eddie Cantor]] who, perhaps having had let his passion get the better of him, claimed that Nazi agents had tried to prevent his attendance.&lt;ref name=moguls/&gt;  Dorothy Parker spoke as well.&lt;ref name=myrna/&gt;

The HANL published a weekly newspaper, the ''Hollywood Anti-Nazi News'', beginning in October 1936&lt;ref name=moguls/&gt; and another journal, ''Hollywood Now''.&lt;ref name=dispossessed&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Isaac Rose|title=The Dispossessed: An Anatomy Of Exile|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S3nrqqIDREcC&amp;|accessdate=3 June 2013|year=2005|publisher=Univ of Massachusetts Press|isbn=978-1-55849-466-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|292}} By 1937 the League was running two radio programs on Los Angeles station [[KFWB]], mostly scripted by Donald Stewart and [[Herbert Biberman]].&lt;ref name=moguls/&gt; It had local sections in [[Silver Lake, Los Angeles|Silver Lake]], [[Hollywood]], [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]], and other neighborhoods around Los Angeles County.&lt;ref name=hoover/&gt;

Among these other activities, the League sponsored a variety of dinners, lectures, and rallies.&lt;ref name=spangled&gt;{{cite book|author=Bernard F. Dick|title=The Star-spangled Screen: The American World Warm II Film|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eTSMElob26QC&amp;pg=PA11|accessdate=3 June 2013|year=1996|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=978-0-8131-2821-4|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The HANL also organized boycotts of German products and picketed meetings of the Los Angeles chapter of the [[German American Bund]].&lt;ref name=carr/&gt;

The HANL also publicized visits of prominent fascists to Los Angeles in order to shame their hosts, including [[Vittorio Mussolini]], son of the Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]].&lt;ref name=carr/&gt;  Mussolini was visiting Los Angeles in order to study film-making. The morning of his arrival, September 25, 1937, the HANL ran ads in Hollywood trade papers but did not hold protests at the airport. Mussolini stayed with producer [[Hal Roach]] during his time in Hollywood.&lt;ref name=duceson&gt;{{cite news|publisher=New York Times|title=Il Duce's Son Reaches Hollywood by Plane|page=36|date=September 26, 1937}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The League also protested Nazi film-maker&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John W. De Gruchy|title=Christianity, Art and Transformation: Theological Aesthetics in the Struggle for Justice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ByyEaR0FVYgC&amp;pg=PA92|accessdate=3 June 2013|year=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-77205-1|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leni Riefenstahl]]'s visit to Hollywood at the invitation of [[Walt Disney]]&lt;ref name=carr/&gt; in November 1938.&lt;ref name=leni&gt;{{cite news|publisher=New York Times|title=Hollywood Ad Hits at Leni Reifenstahl|page=15|date=November 30, 1938}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The HANL again took out ads in Hollywood trade papers calling on the industry to "close its doors to all Nazi agents."  The admonition was somewhat successful, and Riefenstahl issued a statement about the advertisement saying that she was surprised that the League had attacked her personally and that she was not an agent of the Nazi government.&lt;ref name=leni/&gt;  Riefenstahl, interviewed in France after her three-month trip to America, said that she had "received everywhere lustrous reception except Hollywood where she was only received by Walt Disney, but was otherwise boycotted at the instigation of the Anti Nazi League."&lt;ref name=trickfilm&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rolf Giesen|author2=J.

The League also attempted to convince the studios to produce an anti-Nazi film, but they were hindered in their efforts because the [[Motion Picture Production Code]] decreed that movies should be apolitical. They also accused the studios&lt;!--more than one? wasn't the movie made by just one?  why not name it?--&gt; of changing the ending of ''[[The Road Back (film)|The Road Back]]'', a film by [[James Whale]] based on a novel of the same name by [[Erich Maria Remarque]], in order to "'glorify' Hitler."&lt;ref name=dispossessed/&gt;

==Investigations==
The HANL was one of the very first groups targeted by [[HUAC]] when it was taken over by Conservative Democratic Congressman [[Martin Dies, Jr.|Martin Dies]], who said, accurately enough, that the group was "under the control of the communists."&lt;ref name="Colacello2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bob Colacello|title=Ronnie and Nancy: Their Path to the White House--1911 to 1980|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2euWse_mWlgC&amp;pg=PT101|accessdate=3 June 2013|date=1 October 2004|publisher=Grand Central Publishing|isbn=978-0-7595-1267-2|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Summer of 1940, Los Angeles County District Attorney [[Buron Fitts]] convened a [[grand jury]] to investigate "a Communist objective to overthrow the government and assassinate leading industrialists who refuse to 'play ball.'"  A former CPUSA organizer testified to the grand jury that the party had set up the HANL in order to raise funds from wealthy members of the film industry.  He testified that "because of Hitler's anti-Semitic program, the Communist party conceived the idea of playing on the fears of the Jewish people and getting them into the Communist party by selling them on the idea that the party, being an international organization, was the only agency in position to effectually combat the influence of Hitlerism and afford protection to the Jews."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=New York Times|title=Says Reds Sought Hollywood Cash|date=August 7, 1940|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''international real estate''' describes a relatively new phenomenon, beginning in the 1980s and keeping pace with [[globalization]]. The term encompasses real property development, sales and [[lease|leasing]] transactions across [[national border]]s. International [[real estate]] could be viewed as one of the most dynamic branches of real estate although it is, by definition, influenced by fluctuating market value in various sectors between countries, as can be evidenced by the [[2008 global financial crisis|2008 global credit crisis]].

==Types==
International real estate is best subdivided into two categories: international [[commercial real estate]] and international [[residential real estate]]. Some examples of international real estate transactions are:

* a citizen of one country purchases a house in another country
* a [[corporation]] headquartered in one country purchases or leases an office building in another country
* a corporation or investment group in one country builds a hotel in another country

== International commercial real estate ==

Most international commercial real estate transactions take place between corporations and may involve, lead to, or be a consequence of legal, design, [[urban planning]], engineering, financing, and construction work. From a national government perspective, attracting foreign investment into [[real estate development]] projects can be a key priority for increasing country revenue and a key strategy for increasing the availability of national infrastructure and amenities.&lt;ref&gt;"Residential Tourism - Its role in the business and socio-economic development of the province" Jose Prado Sesena, President of the Provincial Association of the Constructors and Promoters of Malaga&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the factors leading to the growth in the international commercial real estate sector are:

* the post-war growth in [[urban development]] and [[urban infrastructure|infrastructure]] in both [[developed nation|developed]] and developing nations;&lt;ref name=seabrooke&gt;International real estate: an institutional approach By W. Seabrooke, Paul S. Kent, Hebe H. H.&lt;/ref&gt;
* business' evolution toward [[multi-national business]] operations;
* the growth in [[international investment]] practices enabling investors to look outside their own countries for above average performing investments.&lt;ref name=seabrooke/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/bizchina/2009-03/16/content_7582011.htm|title=US buying trip just hype?|author=By Hu Yuanyuan and Wu Chong|journal=China Daily|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Institutions of Globalization===

International capital market integration requires institutional help, both through the emergence of investment products catering to international investors, and through reliable information sources that make markets more transparent. 
The development of public equity and debt real estate market makes it much easier for investors to allocate significant amount of money outside their home market. 
The overall growth of the global property share market is helped by the proliferation of tax pass-through structures all over the world.
The success of the U.S. REIT market has prompted regulators in many countries to introduce similar-but different named structures. 
REITs are an important development in the internationalization of property markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Commercial Real Estate Analysis and Investment|edition=3rd |author=Geltner, Miller, Clayton and Eichholtz |isbn=978-0324305487}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International residential real estate ==
Most international residential real estate transactions are generated by individuals purchasing lots or built units (including family homes, apartments, and condominium units). These purchases form the bulk of what is sometimes referred to as the vacation/second home market or residential tourism market.

If a person wishes to initiate international real estate investment for the individual’s or the institution’s portfolio, the person or financial manager may consider multiple avenues. The indirect method of entering international real estate investment may involve passive investment in securities that are based on international real estate 
collateral or passive investment in international real estate service firms and offices. The direct method of entering international real estate investment may involve total 
acquisition or partial acquisition of the foreign property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=978-1567203752|year=2000|title=Investing In International Real Estate |author=Mary Alice Hines|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/ebookviewer/ebook/nlebk_62829_AN?sid=831281dc-3352-48ba-8c5a-2994fdc2c43f@sessionmgr14&amp;vid=6&amp;format=EB&amp;ppid=pp_90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For developed countries whose [[GDP per capita]] is above threshold level, it is calculate the value of institutional-grade real estate is 45% of national GDP, which is consistent with data gathered. However, to determine the size of institutional-grade real estate markets in developing countries adjustments are made because only the more affluent segments of the population in those countries have the wherewithal to use such real estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Real Estate Portfolio Management|title=An Institutional View of Global Real Estate Markets|doi=10.5555/repm.18.1.r768m33171022352|year=2012|volume=18|author1=Paul Fiorilla |author2=Manidipa Kapas |author3=Youguo Liang |url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=831281dc-3352-48ba-8c5a-2994fdc2c43f%40sessionmgr14&amp;vid=9&amp;hid=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the factors leading to the growth in the international residential real estate sector are:
* the rise in international [[tourism]] and travel;
* the [[baby boomer]] generation reaching retirement age and looking for more flexible retirement options;
* the increase in available information on the [[World Wide Web]] regarding property listings in countries around the world.

==Recent Increase in Chinese Real Estate Investing in the United States==
A major increase in international real estate investing has been taking place between China and the United States.  In the U.S., the Chinese are now the largest foreign buyers of homes, accounting for $28.6 billion of sales in the 12 months ended March 2015, according to the National Association of Realtors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realtor.org/reports/profile-of-international-home-buying-activity |year= 2015|title=International Profile of International Home Buying Activity|publisher=National Association of Realtors}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three major reasons why Chinese are investing in the US real estate market: investment diversification, overseas education of their child and immigration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.eastwestproperty.com/blog/top-three-reasons-why-chinese-are-buying-us-properties], East-West Property Advisors, July 24, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese real estate website [[Juwai.com]] estimates that Chinese real estate holdings abroad totaled $80 billion in 2015 and are expected to balloon to $220 billion by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roberts|first1=Paul|title=Is Your City Being Sold Off to Global Elites?|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/05/hedge-city-vancouver-chinese-foreign-capital|website=motherjones.com|publisher=Mother Jones|accessdate=11 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese investors are interested in commercial projects, residential properties, hotels, golf courses, clubs, land, industrial warehouses, office buildings, and shopping centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2012 Chinese Investment|url=http://www.attractasianinvestors.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese investors initially were focused mostly on the major gateway cities such as [[New York City]], [[San Francisco]], [[Los Angeles]] but are now moving into other cities as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://therealdeal.com/blog/2015/11/30/chinese-buyers-moving-beyond-gateway-cities/], “The Real Deal”, November 30, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jantantrik Bahujan Samaj Party''' (Democratic Majority Society Party), splinter group of [[Bahujan Samaj Party]] (BSP) formed in 1997 when 19 BSP Members of the Legislative Assembly of [[Uttar Pradesh]] broke away. JBSP allied themselves with [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) and joined the [[National Democratic Alliance (India)|National Democratic Alliance]]. In UP they gave their support to [[Kalyan Singh]]'s government. 17 out of the JBSP MLAs were inducted as ministers in the state government. The president of JBSP was DP Yadav ([[Rajya Sabha]] MP) and the general secretary Shahidullah Khan.

JBSP became an unstable party, and suffered various splits. Four MLAs defected to [[Lok Jan Shakti Party]]. Another splinter group was [[Kisan Mazdoor Bahujan Party]].

When JBSP fell apart DP Yadav organized a new party, [[Rashtriya Parivartan Dal]].

JBSP should not be confused with another BSP splinter group, [[Loktantrik Bahujan Samaj Party]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3346">{{Politics of Fiji}}
The '''Justice and Freedom Party''' (JFP) was a minor [[political party]] in [[Fiji]].  It was formed in 2000 to promote the interests of the [[Indians in Fiji|Indo-Fijian]] community, and unsuccessfully contested the [[Fijian general election, 2001|2001]] and [[Fijian general election, 2006|2006]] elections.  It was dissolved in 2013.

In the [[Fijian general election, 2001|2001 election]] the party gained less than 0.1 percent of the popular vote and won no constituencies.  With some 76 percent of Indo-Fijians voting for the [[Fiji Labour Party]] and 22 percent for the [[National Federation Party]], the JFP was squeezed out.

In the [[Fijian general election, 2006|2006 elections]], the party intended to run candidates in all 19 [[communal constituencies]] allocated to Indo-Fijians, and on 3 April published a [[manifesto]] promising to petition the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and the [[United Nations]] to press the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Australia]] to accept responsibility for bringing [[India]]ns to Fiji during the [[British Empire|colonial]] era.  It also promised a [[Fijian dollar|F$10 million]] scholarship for Indo-Fijian students.  The party would also push for [[dual citizenship]] to be allowed for Indo-Fijians living in Australia and the United Kingdom, and for British passports to be restored to Indo-Fijians living in Fiji, JFP General Secretary [[Dildar Shah]] said.  On 7 April, however, it was announced that the JFP had decided to merge with the multiracial [[National Alliance Party of Fiji]] under the leadership of [[Ratu]] [[Epeli Ganilau]].  Some JFP members, including Shah, would contest the forthcoming election on 6–13 May for the Alliance, Ganilau said.  However, it did subsequently contest the election, gaining only 18 votes.

In 2006 the Fijian government was overthrown and the Fijian parliament dissolved in a [[2006 Fijian coup d'état|coup]].  In January 2013 the military regime promulgated new regulations governing the registration of political parties, requiring all parties to have at least 5,000 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/south-pacific/8184406/Fiji-regime-cracks-down-on-political-parties |title=Fiji regime cracks down on political parties |publisher=Stuff |author=Michael Field |date=2013-01-16 |accessdate=2013-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The JFP welcomed the new regulations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fijitimes.com/story.aspx?id=223662 |title=Political party welcomes decree |publisher=Fiji Times |author=Nanise Loanakadavu |date=2013-01-28 |accessdate=2013-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was unable to gain the required number of members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fbc.com.fj/fiji/8107/justice-and-freedom-party-fails-to-meet-deadline |title=Justice and Freedom Party fails to meet deadline |publisher=Fiji Broadcasting Corporation |date=2013-02-15 |accessdate=2013-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  it was therefore wound up and its assets forfeited to the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fijitimes.com/story.aspx?id=225235 |title=Forfeiture |publisher=Fiji Times |author=Tevita Vuibau |date=2013-02-15 |accessdate=2013-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16141">A '''kolkhoz'''{{efn|Russian plural: ''kolkhozy''; [[anglicisation|anglicized]] plural: ''kolkhozes''.}} ({{lang-rus|колхо́з|a=ru-kolkhoz.ogg|p=kɐlˈxos}}, a [[syllabic abbreviation|contraction]] of '''кол'''лективное '''хоз'''яйство, collective ownership, '''kol'''lektivnoye '''khoz'''aystvo) was a form of [[collective farm]] in the [[Soviet Union]].  Kolkhozes existed along with state farms or [[sovkhoz]]{{efn|{{lang-rus|совхо́з}}, a [[syllabic abbreviation|contraction]] of '''сов'''етское '''хоз'''яйство, soviet ownership or state ownership, '''sov'''etskoye '''khoz'''aystvo. Russian plural: ''sovkhozy''; [[anglicisation|anglicized]] plural: ''sovkhozes''.}}. These were the two components of the ''socialized farm sector'' that began to emerge in [[Agriculture in the Soviet Union|Soviet agriculture]] after the [[October Revolution]] of 1917, as an antithesis both to the [[feudalism|feudal]] structure of impoverished [[serfdom]] and [[aristocracy|aristocratic]] landlords and to individual or [[family farm]]ing.

The 1920s were characterized by spontaneous emergence of collective farms, under influence of traveling propaganda workers. Initially a collective farm resembled an updated version of the traditional Russian "[[Mir (social)|commune]]", the generic "farming association" (''zemledel’cheskaya [[artel]]’''), the [[association for joint cultivation of land]] (TOZ), and finally the kolkhoz. This gradual shift to collective farming in the first 15 years after the October Revolution was turned into a "violent stampede" during the forced [[Collectivization in the USSR|collectivization]] campaign that began in 1928 as means to countering "counterrevolutionary elements". 

==Name==
The Russian portmanteau was adopted in other languages as a Russian word, however some other languages it was adopted as part of own culture, i.e. {{Lang-uk|колгосп|translit=kolhósp}}, {{Lang-be|калгас|translit=kalhas}}, {{Lang-lt|kolūkis}}.

==Kolkhoz as a pseudo-cooperative==
As a collective farm, a ''kolkhoz'' was legally organized as a production cooperative. The Standard Charter of a kolkhoz, which since the early 1930s had the force of law in the USSR, is a model of cooperative principles in print. It speaks of the kolkhoz as a "form of agricultural production cooperative of peasants that voluntarily unite for the purpose of joint agricultural production based on [...] collective labor". It asserts that "the kolkhoz is managed according to the principles of socialist self-management, democracy, and openness, with active participation of the members in decisions concerning all aspects of internal life".&lt;ref&gt;''Standard Kolkhoz Charter'', Agropromizdat, Moscow (1989), pp. 4,37 ('''Russian''').&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, the collective farm that emerged after Stalin’s [[Collectivization in the USSR|collectivization]] campaign did not have many characteristics of a true cooperative, except for nominal joint ownership of non-land assets by the members (the land in the Soviet Union was nationalized in 1917). Importantly, remuneration had always been in proportion to labor and not from residual profits, implying that members were treated as employees and not as owners. Even the basic principle of voluntary membership was violated by the process of forced collectivization; members did not retain a right of free exit, and those who managed to leave could not take their share of assets with them (neither in kind nor in cash-equivalent form).

They imposed detailed work programs and nominated their preferred managerial candidates.&lt;ref&gt;V.I. Semchik , ''Cooperation and the Law'', Naukova Dumka, Kiev (1991) ('''Russian''').&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E.V. Serova, ''Agricultural Cooperation in the USSR'', Agropromizdat, Moscow (1991) ('''Russian''').&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the mid-1930s, the kolkhozes had been in effect  an offshoot of the state sector (although notionally they continued to be owned by their members). Nevertheless, in locations with particularly good land or if it happened to have capable management, some kolkhozes accumulated substantial sums of money in their bank accounts. Subsequently, numerous kolkhozes were formally nationalized by changing their status to ''sovkhozes''. The faint dividing lines between collective and state farms were obliterated almost totally in the late 1960s, when Khrushchev’s administration authorized a guaranteed wage to kolkhoz members, similarly to sovkhoz employees.  Essentially, his administration recognized their status as hired hands rather than authentic cooperative members. The guaranteed wage provision was incorporated in the 1969 version of the Standard Charter.

===Work organization===
====Brigade====
{{see|Brigade (Soviet collective farm)}}

The question of internal organization was important in the new kolkhozes.  The most basic measure was to divide the workforce into a number of groups, generally known as brigades, for working purposes. By July 1929 it was already normal practice for the large kolkhoz of 200-400 households to be divided into temporary or permanent work units of 15-30 households.'&lt;ref&gt;[[R W Davies]], ''The Soviet Collective Farm 1929-1930'' (Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1980), p.59.&lt;/ref&gt;  The authorities gradually came down in favour of the fixed, combined brigade, that is the brigade with its personnel, land, equipment and draught horses fixed to it for the whole period of agricultural operations, and taking responsibility for all relevant tasks during that period.  The brigade was headed by a brigade leader (''brigadir'').  This was usually a local man (a few were women).

After the kolkhoz amalgamations of 1950 the territorial successor of the old village kolkhoz was the "complex brigade" (brigade of brigades), a sub-unit of the new enlarged kolkhoz.

====Zveno====
{{see|Zveno (Soviet collective farming)}}

Brigades could be subdivided into smaller units called zvenos (links) for carrying out some or all of their tasks.

[[File:Пам.Шевченко Колхозник крупно.JPG|thumb|"Kolkhoznik"; a fragment of a [[Taras Shevchenko]] monument.]]

In a kolkhoz, a member, called a ''kolkhoznik'' ({{lang-ru |колхо́зник}}, feminine form ''kolkhoznitsa'', {{lang-ru | колхо́зница}}), received a share of the farm's product and profit according to the number of days worked, whereas a sovkhoz employed salaried workers. In practice, most kolkhozy did not pay their "members" in cash at all. In 1946, 30 percent of kolkhozy paid no cash for labor at all, 10.6 paid no grain, and 73.2 percent paid 500&amp;nbsp;grams of grain or less per day worked.&lt;ref&gt;''Exile and Discipline: The June 1948 campaign against Collective Farm shirkers'' by Jean Levesque, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; In addition the kolkhoz was required to sell its grain crop and other products to the State at fixed prices. These were set by Soviet government very low, and the difference between what the State paid the farm and what the State charged consumers represented a major source of income for the Soviet government.

In 1948 the Soviet government charged wholesalers 335 rubles for 100 kilograms of [[rye]], but paid the kolkhoz roughly 8 rubles.&lt;ref name=KarlMarx&gt;Caroline Humphrey, ''Karl Marx Collective: Economy, society and religion in a Siberian collective farm'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge (1983), p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nor did such prices change much to keep up with [[Soviet ruble|inflation]].  Prices paid by the Soviet government hardly changed at all between 1929 and 1953, meaning that the State came to pay less than one half or even one third of the cost of production.&lt;ref name=KarlMarx/&gt;

Members of kolkhozy had the right to hold a small area of private land and some animals. The size of the private plot varied over the Soviet period, but was usually about {{convert|1|acre|ha}}. Before the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] a peasant with less than {{convert|13.5|acre|ha}} was considered{{by whom|date=August 2015}} too poor to maintain a family.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard E. Hubbard, ''The Economics of Soviet Agriculture'', Macmillan, London (1939), p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the productivity of such plots is reflected in the fact that in 1938 3.9 percent of total sown land was in the form of private plots, but in 1937 those plots produced 21.5 percent of gross agriculture output.&lt;ref&gt;Roy D. Laird, ''Collective Farming in Russia: A Political Study of the Soviet Kolkhozy'', University of Kansas Publications, Lawrence, Kansas (1958), p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Kolkhozniki had to do a minimum number of days work per year both on the kolkhoz and on other government work (such as road building). In one kolkhoz the requirements were a minimum of 130 days a year for each able-bodied adult and 50 days per boy aged between 12 and 16. That was distributed around the year according to the agricultural cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Fedor Belov, ''The History of a Soviet Collective Farm'', Praeger, New York (1955), p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; If kolkhoz members did not perform the required minimum of work, the penalties could involve confiscation of the farmer's private plot, a trial in front of a People's Court that could result in three to eight months of hard labour on the kolkhoz or up to one year in a corrective [[labor camp]].&lt;ref&gt;Fedor Belov, ''op. cit.'', pp. 110-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

In both kolkhozy and sovkhozy, villagers were prevented from leaving, and especially from moving from rural areas to urban areas. In urban areas, a system of [[internal passport]]s and [[residence permit]]s existed to control the movement of population, but in the countryside the villagers did not even have the internal passports which were legally necessary for any domestic travel.

==Disappearance of the kolkhoz after 1991==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2012}}
With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in December 1991, the [[Post-Soviet states|former Soviet republics]] became target for criminal interests and pitiful unstable financial situation undermined any perspective for their development. The so-called general policy of [[Transition economy|transition]] from the Soviet [[centrally planned economy]] to a [[market economy]] de-facto failed. The number of kolkhozes and sovkhozes declined rapidly after 1992, while other corporate forms gained in prominence.

Still, field surveys conducted in CIS countries in the 1990s generally indicated that, in the opinion of the members and the managers, many of the new corporate farms behaved and functioned for all practical reasons like the old kolkhozes.&lt;ref name=AgTrans&gt;Z. Lerman, C. Csaki, and G. Feder, ''Agriculture in Transition: Land Policies and Evolving Farm Structures in Post-Soviet Countries'', Lexington Books, Lanham, MD (2004), Chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Formal re-registration only "changed the sign on the door" and did not produce radical internal restructuring of the traditional Soviet farm, although this was badly needed for improving productivity and efficiency of the former Soviet farms.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Kolkhozes have disappeared almost completely in [[Transcaucasian]] and [[Central Asia]]n states. In [[Armenia#Economy|Armenia]], [[Georgia (country)#Economy|Georgia]], and [[Economy of Azerbaijan|Azerbaijan]] the disappearance of the kolkhoz was part of an overall individualization of agriculture, with family farms displacing corporate farms in general. In Central Asian countries, some corporate farms persist, but no kolkhozes remain. Thus, in [[Turkmenistan]], a presidential decree of June 1995 summarily "reorganized" all kolkhozes into "peasant associations" ({{lang-tk|daikhan berleshik}}).&lt;ref name=AgTrans/&gt; In [[Agriculture in Tajikistan|Tajikistan]], a presidential decree of October 1995 initiated a process of conversion of kolkhozes into  share-based farms operating on leased land, agricultural production cooperatives, and dehkan (peasant) farms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/hlm/prgm/cph/experts/tajikistan/Documents/EU.Farm.organization.policy.brief.pdf Murat Aminjanov, ''How many farms are there in Tajikistan?''], Policy Brief 3, European Commission "Support for the Development, Implementation and Evaluation of Agricultural Policy in Tajikistan" Project, Dushanbe (October 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; However, contrary to the practice in all other [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] countries, one-third of the 30,000 peasant farms in Tajikistan are organized as ''collective dehkan farms'' and not family farms. These collective dehkan farms are often referred to as "kolkhozy" in the vernacular, although legally they are a different organizational form and the number of "true" kolkhozes in Tajikistan today is less than 50. Similarly in [[Agriculture in Uzbekistan|Uzbekistan]] the 1998 Land Code renamed all kolkhozes and sovkhozes ''shirkats'' ([[Uzbek language|Uzbek]] for agricultural cooperatives) and just five years later, in October 2003, the government's new strategy for land reform prescribed a sweeping reorientation from ''shirkats'' to peasant farms, which since then have virtually replaced all corporate farms.

'''Li Dazhao''' ({{zh|t=李大釗|w=Li Ta-chao}}; October 29, 1888 – April 28, 1927) was a [[China|Chinese]] intellectual who co-founded the [[Communist Party of China]] with [[Chen Duxiu]] and other early communists in 1921.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Li was born into a peasant family in [[Laoting County]], [[Hebei]] province. He started his formal modern education at Yongpingfu Middle school. From 1907 to 1913, he studied at Beiyang College of Politics and Law in Tianjin. From 1914 to 1916, Li studied political economy at [[Waseda University]] in [[Japan]] before returning to China in 1916. He did not finish his learning but was repelled by Waseda because of his long absences for his active participation into the anti-Yuan Shikai campaign in Shanghai in early 1916.

=== Librarian at Peking University ===

As a leading intellectual in the [[New Culture Movement]], Li was recruited by [[Cai Yuanpei]] to head the library at [[Peking University]]. In this position he influenced a number of students in the [[May Fourth Movement]], including [[Mao Zedong]], who worked in the library's reading room.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Stuart. The Library: An Illustrated History. New York, NY: [[Skyhorse Pub]], 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Li was among the first of the Chinese intellectuals to look to China's villages as a basis for a political movement and was among the earliest to explore the [[Bolshevik]] government in the [[Soviet Union]] as a possible model for China's reform. Even as late as 1921, however, he still maintained warm relations with other New Culture figures such as [[Hu Shi]].&lt;ref&gt;Maurice J. Meisner, ''Li Ta-Chao and the Origins of Chinese Marxism'' (Cambridge: Harvard University Press,  1967).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Co-founder of the CPC ===
By many accounts, Li was a [[Chinese nationalism|nationalist]] and believed that the [[peasantry]] in China were to play an important role in China's revolution. As with many intellectuals of his time, the roots of Li's revolutionary thinking were actually mostly in [[Kropotkin]]'s communist anarchism, but after the events of the [[May Fourth Movement]] and the failures of the anarchistic experiments of many intellectuals, like his compatriots, he turned more towards [[Marxism]]. Of course, the success of the Bolshevik Revolution was a major factor in the changing of his views. In later years, Li combined both his original nationalist and newly acquired Marxist views in order to contribute a strong political view to China (Meisner 1967, 178).

Li initiated the Peking Socialist Youth Corps in 1920 (Pringsheim 1962, p76), in advance of the first meeting of the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) in Shanghai in July, 1921. Though Li was unable to attend, he was named{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} co-founder of the CPC, along with [[Chen Duxiu]].

Under the leadership of Li and Chen, the CPC developed a close relationship with the Soviet controlled [[Comintern]]. At the direction of the Comintern, Li and Chen were inducted into the [[Kuomintang]] in 1922. Li was elected to the KMT's Central Executive Committee in 1924.

=== Death ===
Tensions between the Comintern, the KMT, and the CPC presented opportunities for political intrigue and opportunism. With the collapse of the [[United Front]] in 1927, Li was captured during a raid ordered by the [[Fengtian clique]] on the Soviet embassy in Peking ([[Beijing]]). Along with nineteen others arrested in the raid, he was executed by hanging on the orders of the warlord [[Zhang Zuolin]] on April 28, 1927.

'''Linguistic purism in the English language''' is the belief that words of native origin should be used instead of foreign-derived ones (which are mainly [[Romance languages|Latinate]] and [[Greek language|Greek]]). "Native" can mean "[[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]]" or it can be widened to include all [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] words. In its mildest form, it merely means using [[List of Germanic and Latinate equivalents in English|existing native words instead of foreign-derived ones]] (such as using ''begin'' instead of ''commence''). In a less mild form, it also involves coining new words from Germanic roots (such as ''[[wikt:wordstock|wordstock]]'' for ''vocabulary''). In a more extreme form, it also involves reviving native words that are no longer widely used (such as ''[[wikt:ettle|ettle]]'' for ''intend''). The resulting language is sometimes called '''''Anglish''''' (coined by the author and humorist [[Paul Jennings (British author)|Paul Jennings]]), or '''''Roots English''''' (referring to the idea that it is a "return to the roots" of [[English language|English]]). The mild form is often advocated as part of [[Plain English]], but the more extreme form has been and continues to be a fringe movement; the latter can also be undertaken as a form of [[constrained writing]].

English [[linguistic purism]] is discussed by [[David Crystal]] in the ''Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language''. The idea dates at least to the [[inkhorn term]] controversy of the 16th and 17th centuries. In the 19th century, writers such as [[Charles Dickens]], [[Thomas Hardy]] and [[William Barnes]] advocated linguistic purism and tried to introduce words like ''[[wikt:birdlore|birdlore]]'' for ''ornithology'' and ''[[wikt:bendsome|bendsome]]'' for ''flexible''. A notable supporter in the 20th century was [[George Orwell]], who advocated what he saw as plain Saxon words over complex Latin or Greek ones, and the idea continues to have advocates today.

==History==

===Old English and Middle English===
[[Old English]] adopted a small number of Greco-Roman loan words from an early period, especially in the context of [[Christianisation of the Anglo-Saxons|Christianity]] (''[[wikt:church|church]]'', ''[[wikt:bishop|bishop]]'', ''[[wikt:priest|priest]]''). From the 9th century ([[Danelaw]]) it borrowed a much larger number of [[Old Norse]] words, many for every-day terms (''[[wikt:skull|skull]]'', ''[[wikt:egg|egg]]'', ''[[wikt:skirt|skirt]]'').

After the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]] of 1066–71, the top level of English society was replaced by people who spoke [[Old Norman]] (a [[dialect]] of [[Old French]]). It evolved into [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] and became the language of the state. Hence, those who wished to be involved in fields such as law and governance were required to learn it (see "[[Law French]]" for example).

It was in this [[Middle English]] period that the English language borrowed a slew of Romance loan words (via Anglo-Norman) – see "[[Latin influence in English]]". However, there were a few writers who tried to withstand the overbearing influence of Anglo-Norman. Their goal was to provide literature to the English-speaking masses in their [[vernacular]] or mother tongue. This meant not only writing in English, but also taking care not to use any words of Romance origin, which would likely not be understood by the readers. Examples of this kind of literature are the ''[[Ormulum]]'', ''[[Layamon's Brut]]'', ''[[Ayenbite of Inwyt]]'', and the [[Katherine Group]] of manuscripts in the "[[AB language]]".

===Early Modern English===
{{main|Inkhorn term}}
In the 16th and 17th centuries, controversy over needless foreign borrowings from Latin and Greek (known as "[[inkhorn term]]s") was rife. Critics argued that English already had words with identical meanings. However, many of the new words gained an equal footing with the native Germanic words, and often replaced them.

Writers such as [[Thomas Elyot]] flooded their writings with foreign borrowings, whilst writers such as [[John Cheke]] sought to keep their writings "pure". Cheke wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;I am of this opinion that our own tung should be written cleane and pure, unmixt and unmangeled with borowing of other tunges; wherein if we take not heed by tiim, ever borowing and never paying, she shall be fain to keep her house as bankrupt.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In reaction, some writers tried either to resurrect older English words, such as ''[[wikt:gleeman|gleeman]]'' for musician, ''[[wikt:sicker|sicker]]'' (itself an early borrowing from Latin ''sēcūrus'') for certainly, ''[[wikt:inwit|inwit]]'' for conscience, and ''[[wikt:yblent|yblent]]'' for confused, or to make new words from Germanic roots, e.g. ''[[wikt:endsay|endsay]]'' for conclusion, ''[[wikt:yeartide|yeartide]]'' for anniversary, ''[[wikt:foresayer|foresayer]]'' for prophet. However, few of these words remain in common use.

===Modern English===
[[File:William Barnes poet.jpg|thumb|William Barnes, a noted advocate of English linguistic purism]]
A noted advocate of English linguistic purism was 19th-century English writer, poet, minister, and philologist [[William Barnes]], who sought to make scholarly English easier to understand without a classical education. Barnes lamented the "needless inbringing" of foreign words, instead using native words from his [[West Country dialects|own dialect]] and coining new ones based on Old English roots. These included ''[[wikt:speechcraft|speechcraft]]'' for ''grammar'', ''[[wikt:birdlore|birdlore]]'' for ''ornithology'', ''[[wikt:fore-elder|fore-elders]]'' for ''ancestors'' and ''[[wikt:bendsome|bendsome]]'' for ''flexible''. Another 19th-century poet who supported linguistic purism was [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]]. He wrote in 1882, "It makes one weep to think what English might have been; for in spite of all that Shakespeare and Milton have done ... no beauty in a language can make up for want of purity".&lt;ref&gt;Nils Langer, Winifred V. Davies. ''Linguistic purism in the Germanic languages''. Walter de Gruyter, 2005. p.328&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1946 essay "[[Politics and the English Language]]", [[George Orwell]] wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;Bad writers—especially scientific, political, and sociological writers—are nearly always haunted by the notion that Latin or Greek words are grander than Saxon ones.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A contemporary of Orwell, the [[Australia]]n composer [[Percy Grainger]], wrote English with only Germanic words and called it "blue-eyed English". For example, a ''composer'' became a ''tonesmith''. He also used English terms instead of the traditional Italian ones as performance markings in his scores, e.g. ''louden lots'' instead of ''{{lang|it|molto crescendo}}''.

[[Lee Hollander]]'s 1962 English translation of the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'' (a collection of [[Old Norse]] poems), written almost solely with Germanic words, would also inspire many future "Anglish" writers.

In 1966, [[Paul Jennings (British author)|Paul Jennings]] wrote three articles in ''[[Punch magazine|Punch]]'', to commemorate the 900th anniversary of the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]]. His articles, entitled '1066 and All Saxon', published on 15, 22 and 29 June, posed the question of what England would be like had it not happened. They included an example of what he called "Anglish", such as a sample of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s writing as it might have been if the conquest had failed. He gave "a bow to [[William Barnes#Linguistic purism|William Barnes]]".

In 1989, [[science fiction]] writer [[Poul Anderson]] wrote a text about basic [[atomic theory]] called ''[[Uncleftish Beholding]]''. It was written using only words of Germanic origin, and was meant to show what English scientific works might look like without foreign borrowings. In 1992, [[Douglas Hofstadter]] jokingly referred to the style as "Ander-Saxon". This term has since been used to describe any scientific writings that use only Germanic words.

Anderson used techniques including:
* extension of sense (''[[wikt:mote|motes]]'' for 'particles');
* [[calque]]s, i.e., translation of the [[morpheme]]s of the foreign word (''[[wikt:uncleft|uncleft]]'' for ''atom'', which is from Greek ''[[wikt:ἀ-|a-]]'' 'not' and ''[[wikt:τέμνειν|temnein]]'' 'to cut'; ''ymirstuff'' for 'uranium', referencing [[Ymir]], a giant in [[Norse mythology]], whose role is similar to that of [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]] in [[Greek mythology]]);
* calques from other Germanic languages like [[German language|German]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] (''[[wikt:waterstuff|waterstuff]]'' from the German ''{{lang|de|Wasserstoff}}'' / Dutch ''{{lang|nl|waterstof}}'' for 'hydrogen'; ''[[wikt:sourstuff|sourstuff]]'' from the German ''{{lang|de|Sauerstoff}}'' / Dutch ''{{lang|nl|zuurstof}}'' for 'oxygen');
* coining (''firststuff'' for 'element'; ''lightrotting'' for 'radioactive decay').

The first chapter of [[Alan Moore]]'s 1996 novel ''[[Voice of the Fire]]'' uses mostly Germanic words. 

Another approach, without a specific name-tag, can be seen in the September 2009 publication ''How We'd Talk if the English had Won in 1066'', by David Cowley (the title referencing the [[Battle of Hastings]]). This updates Old English words to today's English spelling, and seeks mainstream appeal by covering words in five&amp;nbsp;steps, from easy to "weird and wonderful", as well as giving many examples of use, drawings and tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.authorsonline.co.uk/book/798/How |title=How We'd Talk If the English Had Won in 1066 |publisher=Authors Online |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020032602/http://www.authorsonline.co.uk/book/798/How |archivedate=20 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Kingsnorth]]'s 2014 ''[[The Wake (novel)|The Wake]]'' is written in a hybrid of [[Old English]] and [[Modern English]] to account for its 1066 milieu.

Edmund Fairfax's satiric literary novel ''Outlaws'' (2017) is written in a "constructed" form of English consisting almost exclusively of words of Germanic origin, with many neologisms (e.g., ''kenkeen'' for 'curious', ''to enhold'' for 'to contain') and little-used or obsolete words transparent in meaning to the modern reader (e.g., ''to misfare'' for 'to fail', ''to overlive'' for 'to survive'), and employing alternative orthographic conventions in compounds and phrasal constructions.

'''''Listen to Me''''' is a 1989 [[United States|American]] [[drama]] film written and directed by [[Douglas Day Stewart]]. Released on May 5, 1989, it stars [[Kirk Cameron]], [[Jami Gertz]], and [[Roy Scheider]].&lt;ref name="Listen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/81491/Listen-To-Me/full-credits.html|title=Listen to Me|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]]|location=United States|access-date=August 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The film was largely shot on location in [[Malibu, California]], including the campus of [[Pepperdine University]].

==Plot summary==
''Listen to Me'' centers around a group of college students who are members of the debate team at fictional Kenmont College. The two main characters, Tucker Muldowney (Cameron) and Monica Tomanski (Gertz), come from underprivileged backgrounds, having won scholarships to Kenmont for displaying exceptional talent for debating. Both students are taken under the wing of the debate team coach, Charlie Nichols (Scheider), who was a star debater in his youth.

The team eventually wins a chance to debate the issue of [[abortion]] in front of the Supreme Court. Along the way, the students learn lessons about life, love, friendship, and politics.

==Production==
The film was originally called ''Mismatch'' and was meant to star [[James Garner]] but he had heart surgery and was replaced by Roy Scheider. Filming started in May 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=A6SmDaC8VXoC&amp;pg=PA131&amp;lpg=PA131&amp;dq=%22listen+to+me%22+%22kirk+cameron%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MsGL5xMmch&amp;sig=3p80xqHEjvP--YnpWCWeazOsF00&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiburzIqu7PAhVO5WMKHZ_2Cc44HhDoAQg9MAY#v=onepage&amp;q=%22listen%20to%20me%22%20%22kirk%20cameron%22&amp;f=false|page=131|title=Roy Scheider: A Film Biography|first=Diane C.|last= Kachmar|publisher=McFarland|date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The film was re-titled ''Talking Back'' when released on video in the US.

"It's kind of the flipside of ''[[Less Than Zero (film)|Less Than Zero]]''," said associate producer Chuck Cooperman. "These people are our future leaders. They're just as bright, concerned and just as passionate as anyone."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=OUTTAKES: Up-Rooted|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date= 17 Apr 1988|page= K21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was financed by the Weintraub Entertainment Group from [[Jerry Weintraub]].&lt;ref name="jerry"&gt;{{cite news|title=A Hot Movie Studio Gobbles Up the Cash But Produces No Hits: Jerry Weintraub Made Name As Agent and Promoter, Luring Diverse Investors Snickers Over 6 Straight Flops|last=Turner|first=Richard|newspaper= Wall Street Journal |date=14 June 1989|page= A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kirk Cameron said it "was easy for me to relate to" his character. "To begin with, it's a dramatic part. It's not a film about teenagers with half a brain running around drinking, dancing and partying. The characters are intelligent and responsible. They are genuinely concerned about the world we live in. It's much closer to reality than other teen pictures. It's time to show the other side of my generation, the deeper side."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=860&amp;dat=19890505&amp;id=1sw0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=DI8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2439,697550&amp;hl=en|title=Kirk Cameron's surprised by heartthrob role|newspaper=Ellensburg Daily Record|date=5 May 1989|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The film's marketing was going to focus on Kirk Cameron, then at the height of his popularity. However Jerry Weintraub over-rode them and insisted on ads that emphasised the fact the film dealt with a debate about [[abortion]], hoping to stir up controversy. The movie was a flop at the box office. "Fans were neither angered or disturbed, they simply stayed away," wrote the ''Wall Street Journal''.&lt;ref name="jerry"/&gt;

'''Mandela and Tambo''' was a South African law firm established by [[Nelson Mandela]] and [[Oliver Tambo]] in Johannesburg in late 1952.  It was the first "Attorney Firm" in the country to be run by black partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tambo Moot Court |publisher=University of Cape Town |access-date=9 December 2013 |url=http://www.law.uct.ac.za/about/tambo_moot_court/name/ |date=24 September 2006 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101023211220/http://www.law.uct.ac.za/about/tambo_moot_court/name/ |archivedate=23 October 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1952, Mandela had opened his own firm&lt;ref name="Mandela1"&gt;{{cite book|title=Long Walk to Freedom:  Vol. 1|last=Mandela|first=Nelson|publisher=Abacus|date=1994|isbn=0349116024}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|210}} but, after just several months, he invited Tambo to join him in the establishment of Mandela and Tambo in two small rooms at [[Chancellor House (building)|Chancellor House]], the building housing the headquarters of the African National Congress.  The firm was inundated with clients seeking redress from acts of the oppressive apartheid regime. In South Africa, "Attorney Firms" would deal with lay clients directly and draft most of the paperwork, and "instruct" an Advocate, either practising independently or in-house with the firm, to plead before the Court. Tambo would do much of the paperwork in the office whilst Mandela did most of the advocacy before the magistrates in the courts opposite.&lt;ref name="Mandela1" /&gt;{{rp|212}}

Later others joined the firm, including [[Duma Nokwe]], [[Ruth Mompati]], [[Mendi Msimang]] and Godfrey Pitje.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.brandsouthafrica.com/south-africa-fast-facts/history-facts/chancellor-house-300910|title=New life for Mandela &amp; Tambo Attorneys|website=Brand South Africa|date=1 October 2010|access-date=20 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The firm was closed down in 1960 as Mandela faced charges of treason and Tambo fled the country.  The building was later gutted by fire and was an urban slum for many years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Guardian|date=14 March 2010|last=Smith|first=David|title=Site of Nelson Mandela's historic law office faces redevelopment|access-date=20 May 2017|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/mar/14/nelson-mandela-office-redevelopment-fears}}&lt;/ref&gt; before being completely refurbished and opened as a museum and archive in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Guardian|date=4 May 2011|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/04/mandela-tambo-law-offices-museum|title=Nelson Mandela's law office reborn as museum |access-date=20 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1999 and [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]] the [[Albanian language]] has become dominant language in [[Kosovo]]{{efn|name=status}}, although equal status is given to [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and special status is given to other [[minority languages]].&lt;ref name="Assessing Minority Language Rights in Kosovo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kv.sapientia.ro/data/miremir_pres/andrea_najvirtova_lars_burema.pdf|title=Assessing Minority Language Rights in Kosovo |publisher=[[Sapientia University]] |format=PDF |accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legislative framework for the protection and promotion of minority languages follows the [[Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities]] and the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]], even country is not member of [[Council of Europe]].&lt;ref name="Assessing Minority Language Rights in Kosovo" /&gt;  However, lack of political willingness to enforce legislation from Kosovo institutions and the continued separation of [[Serbs of Kosovo|Serb]] and [[Albanians in Kosovo|Albanian communities]] impede the actual enjoyment of minority language rights.&lt;ref name="Assessing Minority Language Rights in Kosovo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="COE-Municipalities"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osce.org/kosovo/120010?download=true|title=Municipal language compliance in Kosovo, June 2014|publisher=[[Council of Europe]] |format=PDF |accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
He was born in [[Vegårshei]] as a son of Torjus Taxeraas (1859–1918) and Marie Colbjørnsen (1869–1958). He took his [[examen artium]] in [[Arendal]] before turning 18 years old,&lt;ref name=nbl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=|title=Ole Colbjørnsen|encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Reidar|last=Hirsti|authorlink=Reidar Hirsti|editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]]|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Ole_Colbj%C3%B8rnsen/utdypning|language=Norwegian|accessdate=11 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and enrolled as a student in 1915. He studies natural sciences,&lt;ref name=nsd&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsd.uib.no/polsys/index.cfm?urlname=polsys&amp;lan=&amp;MenuItem=N1_1&amp;ChildItem=&amp;State=collapse&amp;UttakNr=33&amp;person=10557|title=Ole Colbjørnsen|publisher=Norwegian Social Science Data Services (NSD)|language=Norwegian|accessdate=11 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and got work as an assistant of professors [[Carl Størmer]] and [[Lars Vegard]].&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; He also joined the [[Norwegian Labour Party]] while studying, and became involved in politics.&lt;ref name=nsd/&gt; He identified as a communist, and became interested in working for the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; From 1921 he worked in the [[State media|state]] [[news agency]] [[Russian Telegraph Agency]] (ROSTA), and from 1922 to 1928 he worked with trade and finance for the Soviet Union. Eventually he worked with organizing and preparing the [[first five-year plan]].&lt;ref name=nsd/&gt; From 1929 to 1931 he headed a shipping company based in London, working with Soviet timber exports.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

==Career in Norway==
In 1931 he returned to Norway.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; He worked as a financial journalist in the Labour Party's newspaper ''[[Dagsavisen|Arbeiderbladet]]'' from the autumn of 1932.&lt;ref name=nsd/&gt; The chief editor of ''Arbeiderbladet'', [[Martin Tranmæl]], was also a prominent party member. As Colbjørnsen broadcast new economic ideas through his articles, among others inspired by [[John Maynard Keynes]] and [[William Beveridge]], he too became more involved in the Labour Party. He was invited to the Labour Party national convention of 1933, where he showcased a number of reform proposals. In the same year he wrote the pamphlet ''Hele folket i arbeid'', which also became the party slogan. In 1934 he issued the document ''En norsk treårsplan'' together with [[Axel Sømme]]. In it, the authors laid out reforms for a three-year economic plan. Colbjørnsen has been called "Norway's first [[Planned economy|plan economist]]".&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; The Labour Party had tried a radical and revolutionary tactic ahead of the [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 1930|1930 general election]], but suffered a defeat there. Historians generally agree that from this point, the Labour Party decisively drifted away from the revolutionary rhetoric and policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=|title=Edv Bull|encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=|last=|volume=|editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]]|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Edv_Bull/utdypning|language=Norwegian|accessdate=11 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colbjørnsen and Sømme helped build a new political platform. First, they helped shift the labour movement's focus from [[Redistribution (economics)|redistribution]] to production. Second, they helped create acceptance for doing this within the framework of the state, earlier lambasted as [[bourgeois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Furre|first=Berge|authorlink=Berge Furre|title=Norsk historie 1914–2000|publisher=Samlaget|location=Oslo|year=2000|series=Volume six of ''[[Norsk historie (Samlaget)|Norsk historie]]''|page=75|isbn=82-521-5187-6|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, the Labour Party prevailed and formed a [[Cabinet Nygaardsvold|Cabinet]] led by [[Johan Nygaardsvold]]. Colbjørnsen did not become involved in this cabinet,&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; but in the same year he became a member of ''Trustlovkomiteen av 1935'' and the important ''Tiltakskommisjonen av 1935'',&lt;ref name=nsd/&gt; whose goal was to battle unemployment.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Furre, 2000: pp. 86–89&lt;/ref&gt; He was a board member of the [[Norwegian Industrial Bank]] from 1936, and chairman from 1938 to 1940. Following the [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 1936|1936 general election]] he became as a deputy representative to the [[Parliament of Norway]], representing the constituency [[Oslo]],&lt;ref name=nsd/&gt; and he met on a regular basis because [[Oscar Torp]] was a cabinet member.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; He was one of the most pro-military politicians in the Labour Party before 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lundestad|first=Svein|title=Arbeiderpartiet og forsvaret 1935&amp;ndash;1939|year=1974|publisher=University of Oslo|location=Oslo|language=Norwegian|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colbjørnsen had to leave Norway when [[Operation Weserübung|World War II reached the country]] in 1940. He worked at the [[Embassy of Norway in Washington, D.C.|Norwegian embassy]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] In 1946 he was a delegate and in 1947 an advisor in the [[United Nations General Assembly]], and in 1947 he participated in the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] assembly.&lt;ref name=nsd/&gt; He became a supporter of Norwegian membership in [[NATO]].&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

He had married Veslemøy Ihlen Larssen in 1936, and was a son-in-law of [[Olav Johan Sopp]]. He died in November 1973 in Oslo.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

'''People with Disability Australia Inc''' (PWDA) is a national [[Australia]]n [[disability]] [[rights]] and [[advocacy]] organisation founded in 1981 and based in [[Redfern, New South Wales]]. The current president of PWDA is Bonnie Millen.&lt;ref&gt;PWDA Board and [http://pwd.org.au/about-us/our-board-and-staff.html staff]&lt;/ref&gt;

PWDA is a Disabled Persons Organisation, with an elected board of people with disability, and a national membership of people with disability. PWDA is one of the funded national disability representative organisations for people with disability in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dss.gov.au/our-responsibilities/disability-and-carers/program-services/consultation-and-advocacy/national-disability-peak-bodies |title=National disability representative organisations &amp;#124; Department of Social Services, Australian Government |publisher=Dss.gov.au |date=2016-10-10 |accessdate=2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and mission==
PWDA was founded in 1981, the [[International Year of Disabled Persons]] to provide people with disabilities a voice of their own. In 2002, PWDA’s membership approved a repositioning of PWDA as a national disability rights and advocacy organisation. The organisation’s name was changed from "People with Disability New South Wales" to "People with Disability Australia"&lt;ref name="pwdahist"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pwd.org.au/about-us/our-history.html |title=PWDA - Our History |publisher=People with Disability Australia |access-date=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; to reflect this new positioning on 2 May 2003.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=https://connectonline.asic.gov.au/RegistrySearch/faces/landing/SearchRegisters.jspx?_adf.ctrl-state=1a23sef2ms_4 |title=Search: Organisation &amp; business names &gt; "People with Disability" &gt; Details View|publisher=Australian Securities and Investments Commission |access-date=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The principal reasons for the change were to position PWDA to undertake work on national policy issues.&lt;ref name="pwdahist"/&gt;

Between 2003-2006 PWDA played a valuable role in the development of the United Nations [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] (CRPD), organising national consultations and consultations with members, making submissions, hosting seminars, and supporting delegates to attend sessions of the UN Ad Hoc Committee. Through this work PWDA gained Special Consultative Status with the [[Economic and Social Council of the United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://undocs.org/E/2016/INF/5 |title=List of non-governmental organizations in consultative status with the Economic and Social Council as of 1 September 2016 (E/2016/INF/5) |publisher=United Nations - Economic and Social Council |page=88 |access-date=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2009 onwards, PWDA continues to play an ongoing role in monitoring the implementation of the CRPD in Australia, and is part of the NGO CRPD Shadow Report Project Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.daru.org.au/resource/endorse-the-shadow-report-on-the-convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities-crpd |title=Endorse the Shadow Report on the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD |publisher=Disability Advocacy Resource Unit |access-date=18 July 2017 |date=25 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Along with the organization's national work, PWDA has undertaken international development work in the Pacific since 2004.&lt;ref&gt;A sample of Asia-Pacific activity by PWDA:

&lt;/ref&gt;  This [[non-profit]], [[Non-governmental organization|non governmental]] [[peak organisation]] has been described as "the only national, cross-disability organisation representing the interests of people with all kinds of disability" (which includes [[mental illness]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.unsw.edu.au/student-notices/2014/02/internship-opportunity-hosted-people-disability-australia-pwda Internship Opportunity Hosted by the People with Disability Australia (PWDA)], [[University of New South Wales|UNSW]] Law, 4 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Craig Wallace, a former president of PWDA,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/budget-savings-should-not-be-found-at-the-expense-of-australians-will-disabilities-20140307-34bth.html Budget savings should not be found at the 'expense' of Australians will disabilities], [[Sydney Morning Herald]], 7 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt; was commended in Parliament on the occasion of his resignation in June 2016. [[Jenny Macklin]] MP credited Wallace for the organization's contribution to he development of a [[National Disability Insurance Scheme]] and for elevating "PWDA to the status of a leading disability advocacy body".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22media/summary/summary.w3p;query=Source%3A%22MINISTER%20FOR%20DISABILITY%20REFORM%22 | title = Statement on resignation of PWDA's Craig Wallace | first = Jenny | last = Macklin | author-link = Jenny Macklin | work = [[Parliament of Australia]] | date = July 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="72841">'''Politics and sports''' or '''sports diplomacy''' describes the use of sport as a means to influence diplomatic, social, and political relations. Sports diplomacy may transcend cultural differences and bring people together.

The use of sports and politics has had both positive and negative implications over history. Sports competitions or activities have had the intention to bring about change in certain cases. Nationalistic fervour is sometimes linked to victories or losses to some sport on sports fields.&lt;ref name="ipatrix"&gt;[http://www.ipatrix.com/873/separation-of-politics-and-sports/ Can sports and politics ever be separated?]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Poster-Joe-Louis.jpg|thumb|upright|right|United States [[World War II]] recruiting poster featuring boxer [[Joe Louis]].]] --&gt;

While the [[Olympics]] is often the biggest political example of using sports for diplomatic means, [[cricket]] and [[association football]], as well as other sports in the global arena, have also been used in this regard. In the case of [[Apartheid]], sport was used to isolate [[South Africa]] and bring about a major overhaul in the country's social structure. While ethnicity and race can cause division, sports can also help blend differences.&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, Stephen and Douglas Hartmann. "Ethnicity and Race: Making Identities in a Changing World." p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, numerous athletes have sought political office, some of them unsuccessfully, on either the national level or the sub-national level.

==Association football==

===International===
{{See also|Association football and politics}}
The most infamous declaration of politics and sport was the [[Football War]] between [[El Salvador]] and [[Honduras]]. Though the build-up to the war had to do with more socio-economic issues like immigration and land reform, the impetus for war was an inflammation of tensions set off by rioters during the second North American qualifying round for the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]]. Disturbances broke out during the first game in [[Tegucigalpa]], but the second leg saw the situation get considerably worse in [[San Salvador]]. Honduran fans were roughed up, the Honduran flag and national anthem were insulted, and the emotions of both nations became considerably agitated. In retaliation, violence against Salvadoran residents in Honduras, including several [[Vice Consul]]s, increased. An unknown number of Salvadorans were killed or brutalized, and tens of thousands began fleeing the country. The press of both nations contributed to a growing climate of near-hysteria, and on June 27, 1969, twelve days after the second-leg game, Honduras broke diplomatic relations with El Salvador. On July 14, 1969, the Salvadoran army launched an attack against Honduras. The [[Organization of American States]] negotiated a cease-fire which took effect on July 20, with the Salvadoran troops withdrawn in early August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onwar.com/aced/data/sierra/soccer1969.htm|title=Armed Conflict Year Index|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Israel national football team|Israel]] was one of the founding members of the [[Asian Football Confederation]] following its own independence in 1948 (prior to that it played under the banner of "Palestine/[[Eretz Yisrael]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myfootballfacts.com/Site-Map-Israel-Football-Facts-and-Stats.html|title=Site-Map-Israel-Football-Facts---Stats|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[1974 Asian Games]] in Iran (and a tense loss to Iran&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-afc.com/en/features-and-interviews/31318-bayati-recalls-irans-1968-afc-asian-cup-triumph Bayati recalls Iran's tense win over Israel]&lt;/ref&gt;), Kuwait and other Arab states refused to play them. Following this, they were expelled from the confederation and spent a few years trying to qualify from such continental bodies as the [[Oceania Football Confederation|OFC]] before joining [[UEFA]].&lt;ref name="israel"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/feb/27/worldcup2010 | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=James | last=Montague | title=Time is right for Israel to return to its Asian roots | date=February 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[2004 AFC Asian Cup]] held in China made headlines due to events that took place during the final between [[China national football team|China]] and [[Japan national football team|Japan]], apparently due to [[China-Japan relations|historical relations]] dating back to World War II (see [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] and [[Nanjing Massacre]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3541380.stm | work=BBC News | title=Chinese riot after Japan victory | date=August 7, 2004 | accessdate=May 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the Japanese national anthem was being played, the home fans expressed their [[anti-Japanese sentiment]] by drowning out the national anthem with their chants. The Chinese home fans also continually booed the players, visiting fans and officials as they watched Japan defeat China 3–1. After the match, some Chinese fans rioted outside the [[Beijing Worker's Stadium]].

Once again, on September 6, 2008, [[Armenia]] and Turkey faced each other in a [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] qualification match in [[Yerevan]]. In an unprecedented step, Turkish President [[Abdullah Gül]] was [[Armenia-Turkey relations|invited to watch]] the match, where he and his Armenia counterpart, [[Serzh Sargsyan]], sat together, albeit behind bullet-proof glass. However, the [[Turkish national anthem]] was almost drowned out by booing from 35,000 Armenian fans, showing there is still a lot of mistrust between the two countries. However, the gesture "between the presidents showed that they believed 'football diplomacy' had achieved the most important result." This was a first for the two countries divided by the legacy of the 20th century's first [[Armenian genocide|genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article4698951.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=Turkey and Armenia start to mend old emnities (''sic'') via World Cup football match | date=September 7, 2008 | accessdate=May 23, 2010 | first=Sadie | last=Gray}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1839199,00.html | work=Time | title=Can Soccer Heal Turkey-Armenia Rift? | date=September 5, 2008 | accessdate=May 23, 2010 | first=Andrew | last=Purvis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-09/07/content_9819181.htm|title=Turkey-Armenia soccer diplomacy brings opportunity to help thaw frozen ties_English_Xinhua|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&amp;link=152384 President Gül says Turkey-Armenia soccer match will generate important opportunities]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L4494093.htm|title=Humanitarian - Thomson Reuters Foundation News|author=Thomson Reuters Foundation|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, [[France national football team|France]] and the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] met in the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification play-off, where the winner of the two-legged tie progressed through to the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] in [[South Africa]]. After a 1–1 aggregate draw, the match went into extra time at France's National Stadium. The winning goal came from France's [[William Gallas]], but in the build-up, [[Thierry Henry]] twice handled the ball, before passing to Gallas to score. It was seen as a "[[Hand of Frog]]" goal, in reference to the similar "[[Argentina v England (1986 FIFA World Cup quarter-final)#.22Hand of God.22 goal|Hand of God]]" goal in the match between Argentina and England. It the became an [[international incident]] with Irish [[Taoiseach]] [[Brian Cowen]] demanding a replay and the French President telling him to "stick to politics".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/fifa-cool-on-irish-replay-calls/story-e6frf9if-1225799989020 Political stoush erupts over Hand of Frog | Herald Sun]&lt;/ref&gt; The replay was not given.

In 2010 [[Iran-Arab relations#United Arab Emirates|relations between Iran and the UAE]] took a turn for the worse when the [[Football Federation Islamic Republic of Iran]] sent a letter to the [[Asian Football Confederation|AFC]] complaining about the misuse of the ''[[Persian Gulf]]'' name. "The move was made after the UAE misrepresented the name ''[[Persian Gulf naming dispute|Persian Gulf]]'' during a match between Iran's Sepahan and the UAE's Al Ain. The Emirate television displayed various banners showing a fictitious name for the Persian Gulf during the match between Iran's Sepahan and the UAE's Al Ain. The AFC must take serious measures to deal with UAE actions of the sort", Taj added. "The UAE side must be fined for showing a fictitious name for the Persian Gulf during the live broadcast of the match."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=125379&amp;sectionid=351020101 No Operation]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to official comments from the UAE in regards to comparing the three disputed islands of [[Greater Tunb]], the [[Lesser Tunb]] and [[Abu Musa]], held by Iran, to the [[occupation of Palestine]], calls were made for a downgrade of ties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.almanar.com.lb/newssite/NewsDetails.aspx?id=135944&amp;language=en Al-ManarTV:: Iran Set to Limit Ties with UAE over “Occupation”‌ Claims 03/05/2010]&lt;/ref&gt; This also comes after the [[Islamic Solidarity Games]], to be held in Iran, were canceled over the dispute of the ''Persian Gulf'' label.

When drawing for [[UEFA European Championship|UEFA European Championships Qualification]] a special measure is put in place where by [[Gibraltar national football team|Gibraltar]] and [[Spain national football team|Spain]] cannot be drawn together because of the [[Disputed status of Gibraltar]]. The same system is in place for [[Azerbaijan national football team|Azerbaijan]] and [[Armenia national football team|Armenia]] because of the [[Armenia–Azerbaijan relations|poor relations between the two countries]]. The same measure was put in place for [[Russia national football team|Russia]] and [[Georgia national football team|Georgia]] after the [[Russo-Georgian War|2008 Russo-Georgian War]] but was however lifted for the [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying|Euro 2016]] tournament when the two agreed to play each other again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UEFA reveal Euro 2016 qualifying pots|url=http://www.fourfourtwo.com/news/uefa-reveal-euro-2016-qualifying-pots|accessdate=18 August 2014|publisher=[[FourFourTwo]]|date=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Club football===
In Germany, the occasional matchup between [[FC St. Pauli]] and [[F.C. Hansa Rostock]] is known as the "Political Derby" (German: ''Politisches Derby''). Though not a local derby, these teams' supporters represent opposite sides of Germany's political spectrum.{{which|date=July 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bundesligatalk.com/the-political-derby-radical-left-3-2-hard-right/323 |title=The Political Derby: Radical Left 3-2 Hard Right &amp;#124; World Soccer Talk &amp;#124; Page 323 |publisher=Bundesligatalk.com |date=2009-03-06 |accessdate=2013-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.derbysieg.com/hansa-rostock-und-sankt-pauli-ein-politisches-derby/ |title=Hansa Rostock und Sankt Pauli ein politisches Derby |publisher=Derbysieg |date= |accessdate=2013-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Brazil, [[Sport Club Corinthians Paulista]] is well known as a leader of a political movement called [[Corinthians Democracy]] (Portuguese: Democracia Corinthiana) and became a symbol against the military dictatorship happening at the time in the country in the 1980s. Claiming for an electoral democracy, every decision made by the club was done by voting by the squad players with the consent of the board of directors. Footballer [[Sócrates]] is considered one of the leaders of the movement,this movement is reemerging as the political party, the [[CORINTHIAN NATIONAL PARTY]] (Portuguese: Partido Nacional Corinthiano - PNC), in which its leader and President is Juan Antonio Moreno Grangeiro.

In Israel, [[Beitar Jerusalem]] are infamously known for their [[Jewish nationalism]], particularly against the first [[Arab-Israeli]] team to win the national cup, [[Bnei Sakhnin]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/ar/originals/2013/12/israel-sports-racism-soccer-beitar-jerusalem-bnei-sakhnin.html#|title=Knesset member tries to shut out Arab-Israeli soccer club - Al-Monitor: the Pulse of the Middle East|work=Al-Monitor|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; conversely [[Maccabi Haifa]] is known for its cross-community support, particularly in its support by Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/nov/26/israelandthepalestinians.sport|title=How racism is holding back Arab footballers|author=James Montague|work=the Guardian|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the women's game, [[Hapoel Petah Tikva]] have recruited Arab players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/life/sports/1.587049|title=Israeli Soccer Team Breaks New Ground: Recruits Arab Women|work=Haaretz.com|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Scotland, the [[Old Firm]] rivalry between Glasgow-based clubs [[Celtic F.C.]] and [[Rangers F.C.]] is politically tinged along sectarian lines with [[Roman Catholic]]s in Scotland and Ireland supporting the former and [[Protestant]], mainly [[Presbyterian]]s, supporting the latter. It is arguably elevated by the [[Northern Ireland conflict]].

[[Athletic Bilbao]] are famous for the ''[[cantera]]'' policy of signing only [[Basque people|Basque]] players. Along with fellow Basque side [[Real Sociedad]], Bilbao raised the still banned [[Ikurriña|Basque flag]] in a game shortly after the death of General [[Francisco Franco]].

In France, [[SC Bastia]] fans display various symbols of [[Corsican nationalism]] at [[Stade Armand Cesari]], like [[Dio vi Salvi Regina]] and the "Testa di Moro" on the club crest; during [[2015 Coupe de la Ligue Final]] held in the [[Stade de France]] 30.000 Corsicans sang chants in their own dialect, similar to Sardinian dialect. 
[[Stade Rennais]] fans of Roazhon Celtic Kop display and are inspired by [[Breton Nationalism]] : [[Bro Gozh ma Zadoù]] is played before every match.

==Bandy==
Norway declined to take part in the [[1957 Bandy World Championship]] because the Soviet Union was invited, due to the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Soviet invasion of Hungary]] the year before. The country made a similar protest for the [[1969 Bandy World Championship]] because of the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]] that year, handing over the hosting of the 1969 event to Sweden.

Ukraine declined to take part in the [[2015 Bandy World Championship]] hosted by Russia because of the [[annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|Russian annexation of Crimea]] the year before, since Ukraine still considers Crimea as part of its territory.

==Boxing==
[[List of heavyweight boxing champions|Heavyweight champion]] [[Max Schmeling]] had been lauded by the [[Nazi Party]] as a heroic symbol of German destiny and [[Aryan]] supremacy.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} A politically charged [[boxing]] match with [[Joe Louis]] was preceded nationalistic symbolism and imagery.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Schmeling defeated Louis, for the latter's first professional defeat in 1936. [[Langston Hughes]] recalled the national reaction to Louis' defeat.
{{Centered pull quote|I walked down Seventh Avenue and saw grown men weeping like children, and women sitting in the curbs with their head in their hands. All across the country that night when the news came out that Joe was knocked out, people cried. – Langston Hughes&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Langston (2002). Joseph McLaren. ed. ''Autobiography: The Collected Works of Langston Hughes'', Vol. 14. University of Missouri Press. p. 307.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Schmeling was, however, welcomed home with a jubilant reaction. Hitler sent his wife flowers with the message: "For the wonderful victory of your husband, our greatest German boxer, I must congratulate you with all my heart." Schmeling responded to the accolades saying: "At this moment I have to tell Germany, I have to report to the Führer in particular, that the thoughts of all my countrymen were with me in this fight; that the Führer and his faithful people were thinking of me. This thought gave me the strength to succeed in this fight. It gave me the courage and the endurance to win this victory for Germany's colours."&lt;ref name="bookreview"&gt;David Margolick, "Beyond Glory."&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Joe Louis vs. Max Schmeling|rematch]] was scheduled later in New York City. In the build-up to the event U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] offered his support: "Joe, we need muscles like yours to beat Germany." Schmeling's hotel was picketed by American protestors after an accompanying Nazi Party publicist declared that a black man could not defeat Schmeling and that when he won, his prize money would be used to build German tanks.&lt;ref&gt;Dettloff, William. "The Louis-Schmeling Fights: Prelude to War."&lt;/ref&gt; Louis won the rematch in a first round knock out and he became the focal point of anti-Nazi sentiment leading up to World War II. Louis later recalled the pressure on him before the fight: "I knew I had to get Schmeling good. I had my own personal reasons and the whole damned country was depending me."&lt;ref name="bookreview"/&gt;

Decades later, [[Muhammad Ali]] took up political causes in his refusal to be [[conscription|drafted]] for the [[Vietnam War]] amid the [[Civil Rights Movement]] during the presidency of [[Lyndon B. Johnson]].

After earning the championship, Clay converted his religion to Islam, which instigated conflict with his boxing career. He also abandoned his name that was given to his slave ancestors and adopted Muhammad Ali. On April 28, 1967, he refused to serve in the Army during the Vietnam War, stating religious reasons that it goes against the Qur'an's teaching.
{{Centered pull quote|I ain't got no quarrel with those Vietcong...no Vietcong ever called me nigger. - Muhammad Ali}}
He then became an icon of not only the civil rights struggle, but also the anti-Vietnam War movement.
However he was convicted of draft evasion, sentenced to five years in prison, fined $10,000 and stripped of his championship. It was not until a lawsuit in 1970 that Ali redeemed his title.
He would continue in historical boxing matches now known as [[Rumble in the Jungle]] in 1974 and [[Thrilla in Manila]] in 1975, defeating George Foreman and Joe Frazier, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biographyonline.net/sport/muhammad_ali.html|title=Muhammad Ali Biography|work=Biography Online|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chess==

[[Chess]], which is a recognized sport of the [[International Olympic Committee]], has a history of being linked to political issues.  This was particularly true of the [[World Chess Championship 1972|1972 World Championship match]] between the American [[Bobby Fischer]] and [[Boris Spassky]] of the Soviet Union. The match took place during the [[Cold War]] and the pressure was mounting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/non_fictionreviews/3669446/How-Bobby-Fischer-and-Boris-Spassky-became-pawns.html|title=How Bobby Fischer and Boris Spassky became pawns|date=22 November 2007|work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cricket==
{{further|Cricket Diplomacy}}

In 1969, the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] refused to allow [[Basil D'Oliveira]] to play for [[England cricket team|England]] against [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]] for fear of upseting the [[apartheid]] regime. D'Oliveira was a [[coloured]] born in South Africa and refused permission to play for the South African team by the government, instead he played for England. D'Oliveria was one of the more likely players to be selected following his performance against Australia in the previous year's [[The Ashes|Ashes]]. However, he was not selected; it was suspected at the time{{by whom|date=June 2012}} that this was capitulation towards the [[apartheid]] regime.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Cricket has also had a hand to play in sporting diplomacy. Following the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]], and Soviet pressure on India to deflect the tension they faced, in 1987 Pakistan's president at the time, General [[Zia ul-Haq]], attended a test match between India and Pakistan in Jaipur – a visit that apparently helped cool a flare-up in tensions. Furthermore, following a fifteen-year lull in test matches, cricket tours between India and Pakistan were revived in 2004 in the wake of diplomatic initiatives to bury half a century of mutual hostility. Both sides relaxed their tough visa regulations for each other, allowing thousands of fans to travel across the border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opinionjournal.com/la/?id=110004862|title=Life|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/03/10/business/singh.php&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt to replicate the cricket diplomacy of the past General [[Pervez Musharraf]] came to India in 2005 ostensibly for a cricket match. The trip, however, quickly took on the air of a summit as the sides were urged "to seize a historic chance to end their dispute over Kashmir."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-04/17/content_434859.htm Musharraf visits India amid cricket diplomacy]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-04/19/content_435617.htm|title=India, Pakistan cricket diplomacy no game it's real|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often this rivalry has been tinged with a religious-political bent to it. A Pakistani fan in [[Karachi]] ran onto the pitch to attack the Indian [[Captain (cricket)|captain]], and fans threw stones at the Indian players during the match in Karachi. In 2000 right-wing Hindus dug up the cricket pitch in New Delhi to protest against the Pakistani team's visit.&lt;ref name="update.unu.edu"&gt;[http://update.unu.edu/archive/issue31_2.htm UNU Update: Cricket Diplomacy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821122824/http://update.unu.edu/archive/issue31_2.htm |date=2008-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Kargil conflict]], and at various other times, there have also been calls to suspend cricketing ties between the two countries.&lt;ref name="ipatrix"/&gt;

In reference to immigrants from the Caribbean and South Asia, British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative party]] member [[Norman Tebbit]] once a "[[cricket test]]" could adjudge a persons loyalty to England by determining whether or not they supported the England and Wales cricket team ahead of those from their own countries of origin.

In 2008, the [[England and Wales Cricket Board]] cancelled [[Zimbabwe cricket team|Zimbabwe]]'s 2009 tour of England and suspended all bilateral relations between the two states in response to the situation regarding the [[Zimbabwean presidential election, 2008|2008 Zimbabwean presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=England cut Zimbabwe cricket ties |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/7471238.stm |work=BBC Sport |date=2008-06-25 |accessdate=2008-09-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  MPs [[Jack Straw]] and [[Tessa Jowell]] wrote to the [[International Cricket Council]] asking then to ban Zimbabwe from international cricket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/other_international/zimbabwe/4170262.stm | work=BBC News | title=Zimbabwe is facing new ban threat | date=August 21, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

China have also gotten in on the cricket diplomacy act. [[Cross-Strait relations]] have once again been the impetus for doing so. During the buildup to the [[2007 Cricket World Cup|2007 World Cup]], [[Antigua]] received a $55 million grant to build the [[Sir Vivian Richards Stadium]], while Jamaica received $30 million for a new [[Greenfield Stadium (Trelawny)|Trelawny]] stadium. [[St. Lucia]] have also got both a cricket and a football stadium courtesy of China. China spent a remarkable $132 million on cricket facilities in the West Indies over the past few years, a massive amount compared to the [[International Cricket Council]]'s paltry 10-year budget of $70 million to promote cricket ''globally''. It is said that the motive for China's generosity is because "Most of the remaining countries that recognize Taiwan are located in the Caribbean and Latin America." The diplomacy paid off in the end as [[Grenada]] and [[Dominica]] derecognized Taiwan as an independent country. Further, "Of the remaining 24 countries that recognize Taiwan, four are in the Caribbean and two of these play cricket." Grenada previously had a stadium built by Taiwan, but saw it flattened by a hurricane. To join the action, China quickly came in to erect another stadium. Consequently, Taiwan took Grenada to a New York City court to force the latter to return the original loan.

Put on the back foot, a beleaguered Taiwan also used the World Cup to shore up its position among its shrinking West Indian support base. It doled out $21 million to [[St. Kitts and Nevis]] and $12 million to the even smaller [[St. Vincent and the Grenadines]] for cricket grounds. China's aggressive ambitions have benefited the [[Caribbean Islands]] as "Strategic analysts say China is laying out more money than is needed to just isolate Taiwan. China, which has built large embassies in each of the islands, now has a bigger diplomatic presence in the Caribbean than the United States, the superpower next door." And that "Mainland China's long-term strategy coincides with its foreign policy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/Story?id=2980988&amp;page=1|title=China Outplays Taiwan in Cricket Diplomacy|author=ABC News|work=ABC News|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the death of [[Saeed Anwar]]'s daughter he took to a more [[Islamic fundamentalism|fundamental Islam]] and started growing a beard. He was then said to have been the turning point in the [[Islamisation]] of the Pakistani cricket team,&lt;ref name="cricinfo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/pakistan/content/story/219991.html|title=Finding Faith|work=Cricinfo|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was also a reason for [[Yousuf Youhana]]'s conversion to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://in.rediff.com/cricket/2005/sep/17youhana.htm|title=Youhana embraces Islam|date=17 September 2005|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the [[2003 Cricket World Cup|2003 World Cup]] a more visible trend of religion was seen in the Pakistan team with many players having become more devout to the point of either leading prayers or growing beards as a symbol of being a "good Muslim" (with the notable exception of [[Shoaib Akhtar]] and [[Danish Kaneria]] (the latter being the only [[Hinduism in Pakistan|Hindu]] on the team)).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pakpassion.net/ppforum/showthread.php?t=77299|title=PakPassion.net - Pakistan Cricket Forum|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even post-match interviews were preceded by Islamic salutations such as ''Bismillah ur Rehman rahim''.&lt;ref name="cricinfo"/&gt; Most famously, after the loss to [[India versus Pakistan cricket rivalry|arch-rival India]] at the 2007 [[ICC World Twenty20]] [[Shoaib Malik]] came under fire for apologising "I want to thank everyone back home in Pakistan and Muslims all over the world. Thank you very much and I’m sorry that we didn’t win, but we did give our 100 per cent" for the defeat, which was particularly ironic considering [[Irfan Pathan]], a [[Islam in India|Muslim]] was named [[Man of the Match]] for his performance in India's win,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?235722|title='Indian Media Exploited Shoaib Remark'|work=outlookindia.com/|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Shah Rukh Khan]] was in the stands cheering on India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pratyush.instablogs.com/entry/shoaibs-remark-shows-pakistani-cricket-team-a-victim-of-pan-islamic-influenza/ Instablogs - Mobile - Shoaib's remark shows Pakistani team a victim of pan-Islamic influenza]&lt;/ref&gt; Following the 2007 World Cup and the loss to Ireland (an unranked cricket team), the religious influence was criticised for taking a toll on the team. The Islamisation of such a Western sport in Pakistan was seen as symbolic of the growing influence of religion in every field.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statestimes.com/2010/2010/03/16/islamisation-of-pakistan-cricket%E2%80%8F/ Islamisation of Pakistan cricket]&lt;/ref&gt; In Pakistan, this trend was attributed to dating back to the tenure of the military government of General Zia-ul Haq where the focus of the youth was shifted from Pakistan as a nation-state and cultural-religious pluralism to Islam as a transnational [[Politics of identity|identity]], greater attention to conservative Islamic ritualism, and a perception of a global conspiracy against Muslims and admiration for militancy. A need was also seen to reorient sportsmen towards professionalism, discipline and rules and regulations. It was said that the focus of education and socialisation needed to return to a Pakistan that could not afford to be at war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2010%5C02%5C07%5Cstory_7-2-2010_pg3_2|title=DailyTimes - Your Right To Know|author=|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Politics in the Olympics}}

Going as far back as the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Olympics]], [[Adolf Hitler]] used this as a stage to promote [[Nazism and race|Aryan nationalism]] for Germany with his ideological belief of racial supremacy.&lt;ref name="Bachrach"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bachrach|first=Susan D.|title=The Nazi Olympics: Berlin 1936|isbn=978-0-316-07087-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Olympics were used as a method of hardening the German spirit and instilling unity among German youth. It was also believed that sport was a "way to weed out the weak, Jewish, and other undesirables."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/online/olympics/zcb013.htm Nazification of Sport]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, many Jews and [[Romani people|Gypsies]] were banned from participating in sporting events. While Germany did top the medal table, the [[Nazi Party|Nazi]] depiction of [[List of African ethnic groups|ethnic Africans]] as inferior was dispelled by [[Jesse Owens]]' [[gold medal]]s in the [[100 metres|100m]], [[200 metres|200m]], 4 × 100 m [[Relay race|relay]] and [[long jump]] events.&lt;ref&gt;Josephson, Judith Pinkerton.

Once again, in 1968, the global stage of the Olympics was used to show the world the plight of the [[African-American]] struggle during the [[civil rights movement]] in their home country. The famous [[Black Power]] [[1968 Olympics Black Power salute|salute]] was performed by [[Tommie Smith]] and [[John Carlos]] during the medal ceremony in [[Mexico City]]. [[Věra Čáslavská]], in protest to the 1968 Soviet-led invasion of [[Czechoslovakia]] and the controversial decision by the judges on the [[Balance Beam]] and [[Floor (gymnastics)|Floor]], turned her head down and away from the [[Soviet]] flag whilst the anthem played during the medal ceremony.

The U.S. hosted a publicity event in New York City with athletes from all three countries to campaign for its reinstatement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/video/americas/2013/05/201351643459549559.html|title=Global rivals unite to save Olympic wrestling|author=|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main| Ping Pong Diplomacy}}
In the 1970s an exchange of table tennis players from the United States and the People's Republic of China led to a thaw in [[Sino-American relations]] that eventually led to U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]]'s [[rapprochement]] with China.
It all began when the Chinese table tennis team invited their U.S. counterparts to their country on an all-expense paid trip during the [[1971 World Table Tennis Championships]] in Japan. ''[[Time magazine]]'' termed it: "The ping heard ‘round the world.'" On April 10, 1971, the team, and accompanying journalists, became the first U.S. sports delegation to enter and break the information blockade since 1949. Although the U.S. team was defeated by their hosts, in return to Premier [[Chou En-lai]]'s invitation to more U.S. journalists, the United States government announced that it would lift its 20-year embargo on trade with China.
A reporter for ''Time'' noted that table tennis was "an apt metaphor for the relations between Washington and Peking" and that both state motioned a willingness to adapt to the new initiative. However, it was not until July 15, that Nixon would finally be the first U.S. president to pay a visit to China. Thirty-six years later, a three-day "Ping-Ping Diplomacy" event was held at the [[Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum]] during the week of June 9, 2008. The original members of the U.S. and Chinese teams from 1971 were present to participate at the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/china/peopleevents/pande07.html|title=American Experience|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tennis==
In 2008, Israeil tennists [[Shahar Pe'er]], [[Tzipi Obziler]], [[Andy Ram]] and [[Yoni Erlich]] were supposed to feature in [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]] and [[Women's Tennis Association|WTA]] tournaments in Doha and Dubai, respectively, despite bans on Israeli passport holders from entering both countries.&lt;ref name="israel"/&gt; Peer was refused a visa to Dubai the following year following the [[Gaza War (2008–09)|Gaza War]] with the organisers saying "We do not wish to politicise sport but we have to be sensitive to recent events in the whole region and not alienate or put at risk the players or the many tennis fans of different nationalities that we have in the United Arab Emirates." The WTA chief executive [[Larry Scott (sports administrator)|Larry Scott]] later reacted saying some "sanctions" would be issued on Dubai. She also faced protests following the war during a tournament in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/7891164.stm | work=BBC News | title=Dubai faces censure over Peer ban | date=February 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2010 US Open (tennis)|2010 US Open]] tennis tournament India's [[Rohan Bopanna]] and Pakistan's [[Aisam-ul-Haq Qureshi]] reached the men's doubles finals, eliciting responses from political leaders in both countries. Supporters from both countries, including the respective United Nations ambassadors, sat in the stands together. Rashid Malik, Pakistan's [[Davis Cup]] coach, said "The success of their team so far has been a big encouragement for both countries, it will only have a peaceful and positive impact on their people." [[Manohar Singh Gill]], India's sports minister, asked "I have one question for everyone. If Bopanna and Qureshi can play together, why cannot India and Pakistan?"

The two were also involved in another campaign promoted by the Monaco-based ''Peace and Sport'' when they wore sweat shirts with slogans reading "Stop War, Start Tennis." They refer to themselves as the "Indo-Pak Express." Such a high-profile collaboration meant this was read as a "unique" partnership. Qureshi said "It just feels like us doing well on the bigger level is getting the message across throughout the world – if me and Rohan can get along so well there's no reason the Indians and Pakistanis can't get along with each other. If even two or three per cent of people say, 'If they can get along why can't we?' that's what we're trying to do. "They're all mixed together sitting in the crowd. You can't tell who is Pakistani and who is Indian. That's the beauty about sports. Before our pairing you would never see that in any sports, fighting for one cause. It's really good to be part of it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia/2010/09/20109920244518342.html|title=Indo-Pak pair in tennis diplomacy|author=|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After their finals defeat, Qureshi spoke to the crowd to "say something on behalf of all Pakistanis, [that] every time I come here, there's a wrong perception about the people of Pakistan. They are very friendly, very loving people. We want peace in this world as much as you guys." He then made a political appeal to the controversial "[[Ground Zero mosque]]" saying "For me, as a Muslim, that's what makes America the greatest country in the world - freedom of religion, freedom of speech. If the mosque is built, I think it's a huge gesture to all the Muslim community out there in the world. I would really appreciate it." Indian and Pakistani fans filled the stadium for the final as the two U.N. ambassadors again sat together in the President's Box. Pakistan's ambassador Abdullah Hussain Haroon said "They've proven that when Indians and Pakistanis get together we can raise fire. I think on a people-to-people basis, they're setting an example that the politicians should follow."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/more_sports/2010/09/11/2010-09-11_aisamulhaq_qureshi_delivers_message_of_peace_at_us_open_after_indopak_express_su.html | location=New York | work=Daily News | title=Aisam-Ul-Haq Qureshi delivers message of peace at U.S. Open after Indo-Pak Express suffers defeat | first=Stefan | last=Bondy | date=September 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
{{Main|Sporting boycott of South Africa}}
Most famously, the sporting boycott of [[apartheid South Africa|South Africa during Apartheid]] was said to have played a crucial role in forcing South Africa to open up their society and to end a global isolation.  South Africa was excluded from the [[1964 Summer Olympics]], and many sports' governing bodies expelled or suspended membership of South African affiliates.  It was said that the "international boycott of apartheid sport has been a powerful means for sensitising world opinion against apartheid and in mobilising millions of people for action against that despicable system." This boycott "in some cases helped change official policies."

The South African [[Table Tennis]] Board (SATTB), a body founded in contravention to the white South African table tennis board, was replaced for the latter by the [[International Table Tennis Federation]]. While the SATTB team was able to participate in the world championships held in [[Stockholm]] in 1957, team members were immediately refused passports by the government. It ruled that no black could compete internationally except through the white sports body.

Started in 1980, the United Nations "Register of Sports Contacts with South Africa" – a record of sports exchanges with South Africa and a list of sportsmen who have participated in sports events in South Africa – prove to be an effective instrument to discourage collaboration with apartheid sport.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/boycotts/indsport.html  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080802160811/http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/boycotts/indsport.html |date=August 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/aam/abdul-2.html  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706195754/http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/aam/abdul-2.html |date=July 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s South Africa was also expelled from most international sports bodies. The [[International Olympic Committee]] even adopted a declaration against "apartheid in sport" on June 21, 1988, for the total isolation of apartheid sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scnc.ukzn.ac.za/doc/SPORT/SPORTRAM.htm|title=SPORTS AND THE LIBERATION STRUGGLE|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jch.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/38/3/477|title=Hitting Apartheid for Six?

The country's hosting and winning of the [[1995 Rugby World Cup]] was a powerful boost to post-apartheid South Africa's return to the international sporting scene.&lt;ref name="update.unu.edu"/&gt; The [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] in South Africa also drew similar parallels and questions as to whether race could be overcome,&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.aljazeera.net/africa/2010/06/07/freshly-ground-south-africa-0 Freshly ground South Africa | Al Jazeera Blogs]&lt;/ref&gt; this was especially true following the death of [[Eugene Terreblanche]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8602347.stm | work=BBC News | title=South African Terreblanche killed | date=April 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fans of [[NASCAR]] are generally considered by the [[media of the United States]] to fall within the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] base as an "almost exclusively white, conservative racing crowd", the "white, middle-aged, working-class Southern men" who were coveted in the first decades of 21st century during electoral campaigns. [[Joe Gibbs]], a NASCAR [[Joe Gibbs Racing|team owner]], spoke at the [[2008 Republican National Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nascar.com/2008/news/opinion/09/26/s.e.cupp.book/index.html NASCAR.COM - Politics once again puts NASCAR fans center stage] Sept 26, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Almost 90 percent of political contributions from those affiliated with NASCAR go to Republican candidates.

A study of elections has shown that the result of sports events can affect the overall results. A study published in the [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] showed that when the home team wins the game before the election, the incumbent candidates can increase their share of the vote by 1.5 percent, while a loss had the opposite effect. The study looked at [[NCAA]] football games from 1946 to 2008. In addition, the study found that colleges with higher attendance rates had a larger effect on the results, up to 3%. The effects are increased even further if the game is an [[upset (sports)|upset]], that is, if the team expected to win does not. Other studies have confirmed these results for other sports, such as [[baseball]] and [[basketball]]. The study authors concluded that the win made voters feel better about society, boosting votes for the incumbent, while losses made voters feel worse, sending votes to the challenger. There was some speculation that the result of certain games could even decide the [[2012 United States presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Will Ohio State's Football Team Decide Who Wins the White House? |author1=Tyler Cowen |author2=Kevin Grier |work=[[Slate.com]] |date=October 24, 2012 |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/10/how_the_presidential_race_between_barack_obama_and_mitt_romney_could_be.html |accessdate=December 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States elections, 2010]], at least five former athletes ran on Republican tickets for political office. [[Chris Dudley]] took part in his first political race for [[Governor of Oregon]] after playing for the [[Portland Trail Blazers]]. He also helped persuade former [[Philadelphia Eagles]]' [[Jon Runyan]] to run for New Jersey's 3rd congressional district against a first-term Democrat [[John Adler]]. [[Shawn Bradley]] of the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] and [[Dallas Mavericks]] ran for a seat in Utah's legislature; [[Keith Fimian]], who played for the [[Cleveland Browns]], sought a House seat from Virginia; and former [[Washington Redskins]]' [[Clint Didier]] sought a Republican nomination for Senate in Washington state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-08-17/professional-athletes-become-republican-hopefuls-in-strategy-for-november.html | work=Bloomberg | title=NFL, NBA Provide Recruiting Ground for Republicans in November | date=August 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only Runyan won his election.

&lt;!--The President also throws the ceremonial first pitch every year in baseball--&gt;Baseball players union boss [[Don Fehr]] contributed to the presidential primaries for [[George W.

NFL quarterback [[Heath Shuler]] has served as a member of the House of Representatives, as well as Seattle Seahawks receiver [[Steve Largent]] and Oklahoma Sooners quarterback [[J.C. Watts]]. 
Former Buffalo Bills quarterback [[Jack Kemp]] was a nine term congressman who chaired the House Republican Leadership Conference and served as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development under President George H. W. Bush. Kemp was the 1996 Republican candidate for Vice President. 
[[Bill Bradley]], who played basketball for the New York Knicks, served three terms in the U.S. Senate representing New Jersey.

Olympic gold medalist [[Carl Lewis]] planned to run for office from [[New Jersey]], though his attempt was blocked and he awaited an appeal hearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-04-27/carl-lewis-files-federal-lawsuit-after-official-halts-bid-for-n-j-senate.html | work=Bloomberg | first1=David | last1=Voreacos | first2=Esme E. | last2=Deprez | title=Olympian Carl Lewis Sues After New Jersey Official Halts State Senate Bid | date=April 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the [[US State Department]] initiated a sports exchange programme entitled ''[[SportsUnited]]'' to encourage dialogue between children from the ages of 7–17. The programme seeks to bring together international students with their counterparts in the U.S. to establish links with American professional athletes and to expose them to American culture. Another programme encourages U.S. athletes to travel to and learn about foreign cultures and the challenges young people face in other countries. ''SportsUnited'' has partaken in 15 different sports in nearly 70 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exchanges.state.gov/sports/|title=Sports Diplomacy  - Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===North Korea===

====World Cup====

North Korea's relationships with the international community, especially [[South Korea]], have sometimes been shaped by sports diplomacy. In the [[1966 World Cup]], North Korea defeated the heavily favored Italian team.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, Jon. "Chollima Upset Italy." ESPNFC.com. ESPN, 19 July 2012. Web. 13 Apr. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kim Jong-il]] believed that successful athletics increases the strength of a country, promoted its ideology, brought a country great honor and increased its international reputation.&lt;ref name="Kim 1986"&gt;Kim, Jung Il. On Popularizing Physical Training and Sport and Developing Sporting Skills Rapidly: Talk to the Officials in the Field of Physical Training and Sport, May 19, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, this victory has become propaganda used by the North Korean regime to present a reputable country to not only their citizens, but also to the international community as a whole. Although North Korea has not had much success since this victory, North Korea participated in the [[2010 World Cup]]. In addition, North Korea was surrounded by controversy during [[2006 World Cup]] qualifying. Fan violence in Pyongyang after a match with Iran led to North Korea playing a home game in [[Thailand]] without any fans.&lt;ref&gt;"North Korea Football Violence Erupts." BBC News. BBC, 30 Mar. 2005. Web. 13 Apr. 2015.
&lt;/ref&gt;

====1988 Seoul Olympics====

The years leading up to, during, and after the [[1988 Seoul Olympics]] played a major role in the development of North Korea. In 1981, [[Seoul]] was selected as the host of the 1988 Olympics. Although at first, North Korea did not consider that Seoul being selected as Olympic host was a major issue, it quickly realized that South Korea hosting the Olympics would highlight the growing economic imbalances between North and South Korea.&lt;ref name="Armstrong, Charles K 1992"&gt;Armstrong, Charles K. ''Tyranny of the Weak: North Korea and the World, 1950–1992''. N.p.: n.p., n.d. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This realization led to a large devotion of time and effort in an attempt to convince the [[International Olympic Committee]] to split the Olympic Games between Seoul and [[Pyongyang]]. During these discussions, the IOC considered some concessions, only to be rejected by the North Korean regime. This can be seen as a great missed opportunity for North Korea to gain from the Olympic Games.&lt;ref name="Radchenko, Sergey 2012"&gt;Radchenko, Sergey. "It's Not Enough to Win: The Seoul Olympics and the Roots of North Korea's Isolation." The International Journal of the History of Sport 29.9 (2012): 1243-262. Taylor &amp; Francis Group. Web. 12 Apr. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, North Korea's major allies were China, the [[USSR]], and [[Cuba]]. While [[Fidel Castro]] and Cuba staunchly defended North Korea, both the USSR and China agreed to participate in the games. This major decision strained relationships that were vital to the North Korean economic system.&lt;ref name="Radchenko, Sergey 2012"/&gt; Throughout the history of North Korea, North Korea relied heavily on the [[foreign aid]]. The countries that gave the most aid were the USSR and China. For that reason, the strained relationships had a major effect on North Korea. This played a major role in the North Korean isolationist policies of the 1990s. In addition, as a result of the undeniable success of the Seoul Games, the growing gap between these two nations was further put on display.

As a result of the failed negotiations North Korea engaged in several acts of [[terrorism]]. In 1987, in an attempt to destabilize the Olympic Games and instill fear in the international community, a South Korean commercial flight, [[Korean Air Flight 858]] was bombed killing 115 passengers on board.&lt;ref name="Armstrong, Charles K 1992"/&gt; This event did not fulfill its intended purpose and instead further weakened North Korea's international reputation.

====World Festival of Youth and Students====

North Korea, following its unsuccessful effort to sabotage the Seoul Olympics decided to hold the [[World Festival of Youth and Students]] in 1989. Coming one year after the most successful Olympics in years, there was large pressure on the North Korean regime to hold a similarly successful event. Although this event brought in 177 countries, the greatest number in its history, it was never seen as a true alternative to the Olympics and did not gain the international visibility that the North Korean government had hoped for.&lt;ref name="Armstrong, Charles K 1992"/&gt; In addition, the cost of the event was a staggering 4 billion dollars and helped further push North Korea into the financial distress that was so prevalent during the 1990s.

====Arirang Festival====

The [[Arirang Festival]], starting in the early 2000s takes place in the [[Rungrado 1st of May Stadium]], the largest stadium in the world holding approximately 150,000 people. Participation in this event is mandatory and the performances are extravagant and impressively choreographed.&lt;ref name="Merkel, Udo 2014"&gt;Merkel, Udo. "The Politics of Sport and Identity in North Korea." The International Journal of the History of Sport 31.3 (2014): 376-90. Taylor &amp; Francis Group. Web. 12 Apr. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The Arirang Festival can be broken up into three different parts. The first is a floor show, where thousands of athletes, gymnasts and dancers demonstrate their athletic abilities. The second section uses thousands of North Koreans to create a human mosaic depicting vibrant images of North Korea and North Korean achievements. Finally, the third section is the music that links the performance.&lt;ref name="Merkel, Udo 2014"/&gt; Together, these elements present to the international community North Korea's best athletes through a mix of athletics and art. The Arirang Festival draws international tourists and journalists and intends to present a thriving economic nation to the world. Many of the acts in the festival focus on the theme of reunification. Children chant "how much longer do we have to be divided due to foreign forces". The 2014 and 2015 Arirang Festivals were canceled and it is unknown if it will return.

====Recent relations with South Korea====

North Korea and South Korea marched together for the [[2000 Sydney Olympics]], [[2004 Athens Olympics]] and [[2006 Turin Olympics]]. Plans to walk together for the [[2008 Beijing Olympics]] fell through when principles regarding selection of athletes could not be agreed upon. After the 2008 Beijing Olympics tensions have increased between these two nations.&lt;ref name="Merkel, Udo 2014"/&gt;

Many inter-Korean sporting events were held in the 2000s. These events were referred to as unification matches.&lt;ref name="Merkel, Udo 2014"/&gt;

====Internal use of sports politics====

The North Korean leaders understood the importance of sports not only in the international community, but also internally. The major ideology in North Korea, [[Juche]], has been solidified through the Communist Party's use of sports.&lt;ref name="Kim 1986"/&gt; The North Korea regime believed that by supporting the increases in sport, the North Korean people would overall be more fit. This would allow the people to be more useful in the revolutionary struggle. For this reason, it was important to start athletics young. In fact, training in physical sport was mandatory during schooling. In the 2000s, major sporting events were being broadcast throughout North Korea, and these events are still being used as propaganda tools. Sports have played a vital role in maintaining the power of the ruling class, while at the same time offering opportunities to interact with the international community.

===Brazil===
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2018}}

====Corinthian Democracy====

The most famous incident in Brazilian soccer and politics is [[Corinthians Democracy]]. In 1982, [[Sport Club Corinthians Paulista|Corinthians]], a club in [[São Paulo]], held election of the club. Unlike other club elections, the presidency of the club was considered as the “third most important position in the country, after the governorship of Sao Paulo and the presidency of the Republic.”&lt;ref&gt;Shirts, Matthew. "Playing Soccer in Brazil: Socrates, Corinthians, and Democracy." The Wilson Quarterly (1976-) 13, no. 2 (1989): 119-23. https://www.jstor.org/stable/40257497.&lt;/ref&gt;  Advertisements through televisions, radio, music etc., that added up to around 500,000 U.S. dollars were used. There were two opposing sides, “Corinthian Democracy” and “Order and Truth”, that contested for the place. “Corinthian Democracy” aimed for political liberation within the club and “Order and Truth” remained in the old system, the oligarchy. [[Sócrates]], the former soccer player, made a statement that he would stay in Corinthians if free election amendment passes. Corinthian Democracy was defeated after the free-elections campaign’s defeat and Socrates went to Florence as a result. 

====World Cup in 1970====

After Brazil won the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] in 1970, General [[Emílio Garrastazu Médici|Emílio Médici]]’s government declared a national holiday, rewarding each player with the equivalent amount of 18,500 U.S. dollars, tax-free. Medici declared “I identify this victory, achieved in the fraternity of sport, with the ascension of faith in our struggle for national development.”&lt;ref&gt;Shirts, Matthew. "Playing Soccer in Brazil: Socrates, Corinthians, and Democracy." The Wilson Quarterly (1976-) 13, no. 2 (1989): 119-23. https://www.jstor.org/stable/40257497.&lt;/ref&gt;. Opinion Poll in 1970 stated that “90 percent of Brazil’s lower classes identified soccer with the nation.”&lt;ref&gt;Shirts, Matthew. "Playing Soccer in Brazil: Socrates, Corinthians, and Democracy." The Wilson Quarterly (1976-) 13, no. 2 (1989): 119-23. https://www.jstor.org/stable/40257497.&lt;/ref&gt; However, after the victory in 1970, [[Cláudio Coutinho]] who was the manager of the national team was given a mission to modernize the Brazilian playing style. Instead of individual skills, teamwork and discipline were emphasized as Medici’s government made efforts to modernize the Brazilian economy.

====Protests over 2014 World Cup Spending====

In the summer of 2013 as Brazil prepared to host the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], protests about an increase in the cost of public transportation broke out.&lt;ref&gt;Young, James. "How Soccer Culture Made Its Way Into Brazils Political Crisis." Remezcla. 2016, Retrieved March 7 2018, http://remezcla.com/features/sports/soccer-brazil-political-crisis/.&lt;/ref&gt; Although started with a small cause, the protests soon expanded to discontents over government’s spending on social welfare. Protestors requested, “hospitals and schools abiding by FIFA standards.”&lt;ref&gt;Fellay, Sarah. “Saved by the Goalkeeper: Soccer and Elections.” Harvard International Review, vol. 36, no. 1, 2014, pp. 32–35., www.jstor.org/stable/43649245, Retrieved 6 April 2018. &lt;/ref&gt; This request was a “reference to FIFA’s high standards of stadium quality” when the country only spends 5 percent of GDP on education in comparison. However, [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo Luís Nazário de Lima]], former soccer player for Brazil, stated that “World Cups aren’t made with hospitals”&lt;ref&gt;Fellay, Sarah. “Saved by the Goalkeeper: Soccer and Elections.” Harvard International Review, vol. 36, no. 1, 2014, pp. 32–35., www.jstor.org/stable/43649245, Retrieved 6 April 2018. &lt;/ref&gt;, referring to a disconnect between soccer stadium and spending on social welfare. This tension led up to a spending of US$850 million on security for the World Cup, which was five times higher than the amount spent by South Africa. 

After the official matches began, political activities, such as protests, reduced until the semi-finals. Brazil, considered as a strong candidate to win the World Cup, lost to Germany [[Brazil v Germany (2014 FIFA World Cup)|7-1]].  As Sarah Fellay referred, huge defeat against Germany sparked “a flood of protests across the country.”&lt;ref&gt;Fellay, Sarah. “Saved by the Goalkeeper: Soccer and Elections.” Harvard International Review, vol. 36, no. 1, 2014, pp. 32–35., www.jstor.org/stable/43649245, Retrieved 6 April 2018. &lt;/ref&gt; Through social media and other online formats, Brazilians started to denounce the government publicly, referring to past protests. Não vai ter Copa (there will be no cup), which was a slogan to denounce government’s spending on the World Cup, started to recur on social media.

The '''Revolutionary Front''' ({{lang-sv|Revolutionära fronten}}) was a [[Far-left politics|far-left]] extremist political and militant movement in [[Sweden]]. The goal of the RF was to dismantle the current society through a [[revolution]] and create a [[socialist state]]. The group fought against [[fascism]], [[racism]], [[sexism]] and [[capitalism]], and campaigned through violent means.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sv.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Uppdrag_granskning&amp;oldid=43067589|title=Uppdrag granskning|date=3 June 2018|publisher=|via=Wikipedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://redice.tv/news/the-rise-of-sweden-s-far-left-militants-sweden-is-being-divided-and-conquered-by-design|title=The Rise Of Sweden’s Far-Left Militants - Sweden is being Divided and Conquered by Design|website=redice.tv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Right2Water''' is a campaign to commit the [[European Union]] and Member States to implement the human right to water and sanitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.right2water.eu/node/37/view|title=About our Campaign {{!}} Water campaign|website=www.right2water.eu|access-date=2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has three stated goals: 
# Guaranteed water and sanitation for all in Europe.
# No liberalisation of water services.
# Universal (Global) access to water and sanitation.

On the 21 March 2013, it became the first [[European Citizens' Initiative]] to collect more than a million signatures and they reached the minimum quota of signatures in seven countries on the 7 May 2013. It stopped the signature collection on the 7 September 2013, with a total of 1,857,605 signatures. The initiative was submitted to the [[European Commission]] in December 2013 and the public hearing took place on the 17 February 2014 at the [[European Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/content/20140204STO34708/html/Right-to-water-attend&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2014, the Commission has adopted the Communication in response to the Right2Water initiative.&lt;ref&gt;Communication from the Commission on the European Citizens' Initiative "Water and sanitation are a human right! Water is a public good, not a commodity!" http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/rep/1/2014/EN/1-2014-177-EN-F1-1.Pdf&lt;/ref&gt; On the 1 July 2015 the Roadmap for the evaluation of the Drinking Water Directive has been published by the European Commission.&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/smart-regulation/roadmaps/docs/2015_env_041_drinking_water_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, the European Parliament criticised the Commission for failing the meet the initiative's demands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/20150903IPR91525/right2water-citizens%E2%80%99-initiative-commission-must-act-say-meps|title=Right2water citizens’ initiative: Commission must act, say MEPs {{!}} News {{!}} European Parliament|website=News {{!}} European Parliament|language=en|access-date=2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report by [[Sinn Féin]] MEP [[Lynn Boylan]] called on the Commission "to recognise that affordable access to water is a basic human right."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/20150903IPR91525/right2water-citizens%E2%80%99-initiative-commission-must-act-say-meps|title=Right2water citizens’ initiative: Commission must act, say MEPs {{!}} News {{!}} European Parliament|website=News {{!}} European Parliament|language=en|access-date=2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3295">The '''Second Malón de la Paz''' was a protest march of [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|aboriginals]] of [[Argentine Northwest|northwestern]] [[Argentina]], demanding the restitution of their ancient lands. It started on 7 August 2006 in the province of [[Jujuy Province|Jujuy]].

''Malón'' is a word derived from [[Mapudungun]] and refers to a surprise incursion, as practised by the native tribes attacking creole settlements in the past. Therefore the expression means "Peace Incursion". The first ''[[Malón de la Paz]]'' was a 2,000&amp;nbsp;km march from Jujuy to [[Buenos Aires]] in 1946, to present land and human rights claims to President [[Juan Perón]].

The Second Malón de la Paz was triggered by the long delay and refusal of the provincial government of Jujuy to comply with a judicial order granting the indigenous communities 15,000&amp;nbsp;km² of land. An assembly of members of different communities gathered in [[Abra Pampa]], 200&amp;nbsp;km north of [[San Salvador de Jujuy]] (the same place where, 60 years before, the first Malón started). Following the resolutions of the assembly, a number of delegates from the communities scattered around the province marched from the [[Quebrada de Humahuaca]] to [[Purmamarca]] (60&amp;nbsp;km north of the provincial capital).

After a new assembly, on 8 August around 1,000 people blockaded National Routes [[National Route 16 (Argentina)|16]] and [[National Route 9 (Argentina)|9]], and demanded to be heard by governor [[Eduardo Fellner]]. The blockade is slated to last indefinitely.

==History==
The first Malón de Paz was not well received by the national government. Although the marchers got the attention and support of the people in the way, as well as formal acknowledgment by President Perón, they were soon expelled from Buenos Aires empty-handed. Only three years later, in 1949, the national government expropriated some lands to be granted to the indigenous communities, but the cession was never performed.

The [[1994 reform of the Argentine Constitution]] recognized the rights of the "originary peoples" to own their ancient lands. According to the delegates of the communities, in 1996 the national government started sending funds to Jujuy to handle the surveys and paperwork needed to make the lands property of the originary communities, but only 7 out of 123 collective property titles have been granted to them.

On 2 May 2003, justice ordered that the papers had to be delivered within no more than 15 months. The provincial government appealed the decision. The originary communities were displeased by this, and sent a letter to President [[Néstor Kirchner]]. The drastic measure of blocking national roads was called by the press "an ultimatum" to the provincial authorities.

'''Solar water disinfection''' ({{'}}'''SoDis'''{{'}}) is a type of [[portable water purification]] that uses [[solar energy]] to make biologically-contaminated (e.g. bacteria, viruses, protozoa and worms) water safe to drink. Water contaminated with non-biological agents such as toxic chemicals or heavy metals require additional steps to make the water safe to drink.

Solar water disinfection is usually accomplished using some mix of electricity generated by [[photovoltaics]] panels (solar PV), heat ([[solar thermal]]), and solar [[ultraviolet light]] collection.

Solar disinfection using the effects of electricity generated by photovoltaics typically uses an electric current to deliver electrolytic processes which disinfect water, for example by generating oxidative free radicals which kill pathogens by damaging their chemical structure. A second approach uses stored solar electricity from a battery, and operates at night or at low light levels to power an ultraviolet lamp to perform secondary solar ultraviolet water disinfection.

Solar thermal water disinfection uses heat from the Sun to heat water to 70–100&amp;nbsp;°C for a short period of time. A number of approaches exist here. Solar heat collectors can have lenses in front of them, or use reflectors. They may also use varying levels of insulation or glazing. In addition, some solar thermal water disinfection processes are batch-based, while others (through-flow solar thermal disinfection) operate almost continuously while the Sun shines. Water heated to temperatures below 100&amp;nbsp;°C is generally referred to as [[Pasteurized]] water.

The ultraviolet part of sunlight can also kill pathogens in water. The '''SODIS''' method uses a combination of UV light and increased temperature (solar thermal) for [[disinfection|disinfecting]] water using only [[sunlight]] and [[polyethylene terephthalate|PET]] plastic bottles. SODIS is a free and effective method for decentralized [[water treatment]], usually applied at the household level and is recommended by the [[World Health Organization]] as a viable method for household water treatment and safe storage.&lt;ref name="AutoSB-1" /&gt;&lt;!-- "exposing to the UV radiation in sunlight", "solar disinfection" --&gt; SODIS is already applied in numerous [[developing countries]].&lt;ref name="TrainingEN" /&gt;{{rp|55}} Educational pamphlets on the method are available in many languages,&lt;ref name="Training" /&gt; each equivalent to the English-language version.&lt;ref name="TrainingEN" /&gt;

== Principle ==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}
Exposure to sunlight has been shown to deactivate [[diarrhea]]-causing organisms in polluted [[drinking water]]. The inactivation of pathogenic organisms is attributed to: the [[Ultraviolet|UV]]-A (wavelength 320–400&amp;nbsp;nm) part of the sunlight, which reacts with oxygen dissolved in the water and produces highly reactive forms of oxygen (oxygen free radicals and [[hydrogen peroxide]]s) that damage pathogens, while it also interferes with metabolism and destroys  bacterial cell structures; and simultaneously the full band of solar energy (from [[infrared radiation|infrared]] to UV) heats the water.

At a water temperature of about {{convert|30|C|abbr=on}}, a threshold solar irradiance of at least 500&amp;nbsp;W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (all spectral light) is required for about 5 hours for SODIS to be efficient. This dose contains energy of 555&amp;nbsp;Wh/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the range of UV-A and violet light, 350–450&amp;nbsp;nm, corresponding to about 6 hours of mid-latitude (European) midday summer sunshine.

At water temperatures higher than {{convert|45|C|abbr=on}}, synergistic effects of UV radiation and temperature further enhance the disinfection efficiency. Above {{convert|50|C|abbr=on}}, the bacterial count drops three times faster.

== Process for household application ==
[[File:Pictograms SODIS.jpg|thumb|SODIS instructions for using solar water disinfection]]
Guides for the household use of SODIS describe the process.

Colourless, transparent [[polyethylene terephthalate|PET]] water or soda bottles of 2 litre or smaller size with few surface scratches are selected for use.  Glass bottles are also  suitable.  Any labels are removed and the bottles are washed before the first use. Water from possibly-contaminated sources is filled into the bottles, using the clearest water possible.  Where the [[turbidity]] is higher than 30 [[Nephelometric Turbidity Unit|NTU]] it is necessary to filter or [[flocculation|precipitate out]] [[particulates]] prior to exposure to the sunlight. 
Filters are locally made from cloth stretched over inverted bottles with the bottoms cut off. In order to improve oxygen saturation, the guides recommend that bottles be filled three-quarters, shaken for 20 seconds (with the cap on), then filled completely, recapped, and checked for clarity.

[[File:Image-Metal-reflectance.png|thumb|Aluminum reflects ultraviolet well]] 
The filled bottles are then exposed to the fullest sunlight possible. Bottles will heat faster and hotter if they are placed on a sloped Sun-facing reflective metal surface. A corrugated metal roof (as compared to thatched roof) or a slightly curved sheet of aluminum foil increases the light inside the bottle. Overhanging structures or plants that shade the bottles must be avoided, as they reduce both illumination and heating. After sufficient time, the treated water can be consumed directly from the bottle or poured into clean drinking cups. The risk of re-contamination is minimized if the water is stored in the bottles. Refilling and storage in other containers increases the risk of contamination.

The most favorable regions for application of the SODIS method are located between latitude 15°N and 35°N, and also 15°S and 35°S.&lt;ref name="TrainingEN" /&gt; These regions have high levels of solar radiation, with limited cloud cover and rainfall, and with over 90% of sunlight reaching the earth's surface as direct radiation.&lt;ref name="TrainingEN" /&gt; The second most favorable region lies between latitudes 15°N and 15°S. these regions have high levels of scattered radiation, with about 2500 hours of sunshine annually, due to high humidity and frequent cloud cover.&lt;ref name="TrainingEN" /&gt;

Local education in the use of SODIS is important to avoid confusion between PET and other bottle materials. Applying SODIS without proper assessment (or with false assessment) of existing hygienic practices &amp; diarrhea incidence may not address other routes of infection. Community trainers must themselves be trained first.&lt;ref name="TrainingEN" /&gt;

== Applications ==
SODIS is an effective method for treating water where fuel or cookers are unavailable or prohibitively expensive. Even where fuel is available, SODIS is a more economical and environmentally friendly option. The application of SODIS is limited if enough bottles are not available, or if the water is highly [[turbid]].  In fact, if the water is highly turbid, SODIS cannot be used alone;  additional filtering is then necessary.&lt;ref name="AutoSB-3" /&gt;

A basic field test to determine if the water is too turbid for the SODIS method to work properly is the newspaper test.&lt;ref name="Training" /&gt; For the newspaper test the user has to place the filled bottle upright on top of a newspaper headline and look down through the bottle opening. If the letters of the headline are readable, the water can be used for the SODIS method. If the letters are not readable then the turbidity of the water likely exceeds 30 NTU, and the water must be pretreated.

In theory, the method could be used in disaster relief or refugee camps. However, supplying bottles may be more difficult than providing equivalent disinfecting tablets containing chlorine, bromine, or iodine. In addition, in some circumstances, it may be difficult to guarantee that the water will be left in the sun for the necessary time.

Other methods for household water treatment and safe storage exist (e.g., chlorination) different filtration procedures or flocculation/disinfection. The selection of the adequate method should be based on the criteria of effectiveness, the co-occurrence of other types of pollution (turbidity, chemical pollutants), treatment costs, labor input and convenience, and the user’s preference.

When the water is highly turbid, SODIS cannot be used alone;  additional filtering or flocculation is then necessary to clarify the water prior to SODIS treatment.&lt;ref name="AutoSB-21" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Scaling" /&gt; Recent work has shown that common table salt (NaCl) is an effective flocculation agent for decreasing turbidity for the SODIS method in some types of soil.&lt;ref name="AutoSB-22" /&gt; This method could be used to increase the geographic areas for which the SODIS method could be used as regions with highly turbid water could be treated for low costs.&lt;ref&gt;B.

''Applied Clay Science'' 99:194–200 (2014). [https://www.academia.edu/8116733/Evaluating_the_geographic_viability_of_the_solar_water_disinfection_SODIS_method_by_decreasing_turbidity_with_NaCl_A_case_study_of_South_Sudan open access soon] DOI: 10.1016/j.clay.2014.06.032&lt;/ref&gt;

SODIS may alternatively be implemented using plastic bags. SODIS bags have been found to yield as much as 74% higher treatment efficiencies than SODIS bottles, which may be because the bags are able to reach elevated temperatures that cause accelerated treatment.&lt;ref name="Pierik" /&gt; SODIS bags with a water layer of approximately 1&amp;nbsp;cm to 6&amp;nbsp;cm reach higher temperatures more easily than SODIS bottles, and treat Vibrio cholerae more effectively.&lt;ref name="Pierik" /&gt;  It is assumed this is because of the improved surface area to volume ratio in SODIS bags. In remote regions plastic bottles are not locally available and need to be shipped in from urban centers which may be expensive and inefficient since bottles cannot be packed very tightly. Bags can be packed more densely than bottles, and can be shipped at lower cost, representing an economically preferable alternative to SODIS bottles in remote communities. The disadvantages of using bags are that they can give the water a plastic smell, they are more difficult to handle when filled with water, and they typically require that the water be transferred to a second container for drinking.

Another important benefit in using the SODIS bottles as opposed to the bags or other methods requiring the water to be transferred to a smaller container for consumption is that the bottles are a point-of-use household water treatment method.&lt;ref name="Mintz" /&gt; Point-of-use means that the water is treated in the same easy to handle container it will be served from, thus decreasing the risk of secondary water contamination.

== Cautions ==
[[File:U+2673 DejaVu Sans.svg|thumb|The PET recycling mark shows that a bottle is made from polyethylene terephthalate, making it suitable for solar water disinfection&lt;ref name="AutoSB-4" /&gt;]]

If the water bottles are not left in the Sun for the proper length of time, the water may not be safe to drink and could cause illness. If the sunlight is less strong, due to overcast weather or a less sunny climate, a longer exposure time in the Sun is necessary.

The following issues should also be considered:

; Bottle material: Some glass or PVC materials may prevent ultraviolet light from reaching the water.&lt;ref name="AutoSB-5" /&gt; Commercially available bottles made of [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]] are recommended. The handling is much more convenient in the case of PET bottles. [[Polycarbonate]] (resin identification code 7) blocks all UVA and UVB rays, and therefore should not be used. Bottles that are clear are to be preferred over bottles that have been colored, for example green lemon/lime soda pop bottles.
; Aging of plastic bottles: SODIS efficiency depends on the physical condition of the plastic bottles, with scratches and other signs of wear reducing the efficiency of SODIS. Heavily scratched or old, blind bottles should be replaced.
; Shape of containers: The intensity of the UV radiation decreases rapidly with increasing water depth. At a water depth of 10&amp;nbsp;cm (4&amp;nbsp;inches) and moderate turbidity of 26 NTU, UV-A radiation is reduced to 50%. PET soft drink bottles are often easily available and thus most practical for the SODIS application.
; Oxygen: Sunlight produces highly reactive forms of oxygen (oxygen free radicals and hydrogen peroxides) in the water. These reactive molecules contribute in the destruction process of the microorganisms. Under normal conditions (rivers, creeks, wells, ponds, tap) water contains sufficient oxygen (more than 3&amp;nbsp;mg/L of oxygen) and does not have to be aerated before the application of SODIS.
; Leaching of bottle material: There has been some concern over the question of whether plastic drinking containers can release chemicals or toxic components into water, a process possibly accelerated by heat. The [[Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Testing and Research]] have examined the diffusion of [[adipate]]s and [[phthalates]] (DEHA and [[DEHP]]) from new and reused PET-bottles in the water during solar exposure. The levels of concentrations found in the water after a solar exposure of 17 hours in {{convert|60|C|abbr=on|adj=on}} water were far below [[World Health Organization|WHO]] guidelines for drinking water and in the same magnitude as the concentrations of phthalate and adipate generally found in high-quality tap water. Concerns about the general use of PET-bottles were also expressed after a report published by researchers from the [[University of Heidelberg]] on the release of [[Polyethylene terephthalate#Antimony|antimony]] from PET-bottles for soft drinks and mineral water stored over several months in supermarkets. However, the antimony concentrations found in the bottles are orders of magnitude below WHO&lt;ref name="AutoSB-6" /&gt;  and national guidelines for antimony concentrations in drinking water.&lt;ref name="AutoSB-7" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoSB-8" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoSB-9" /&gt;  Furthermore, SODIS water is not stored over such extended periods in the bottles.
; Regrowth of bacteria: Once removed from sunlight, remaining bacteria may again reproduce in the dark. A 2010 study showed that adding just 10 parts per million of hydrogen peroxide is effective in preventing the regrowth of wild [[Salmonella]].&lt;ref name="AutoSB-10" /&gt;
; Toxic chemicals: Solar water disinfection does not remove [[toxic]] chemicals that may be present in the water, such as factory waste.

== Health impact, diarrhea reduction ==
[[File:Mwamongu water source.jpg|thumb|Only forty-six percent of people in Africa have safe drinking water]]

According to the [[World Health Organization]], more than two million people per year die of preventable water-borne diseases, and one billion people lack access to a source of improved drinking water.&lt;ref name="AutoSB-19" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoSB-20" /&gt;

It has been shown that the SODIS method (and other methods of household water treatment) can very effectively remove pathogenic contamination from the water. However, infectious diseases are also transmitted through other pathways, i.e. due to a general lack of sanitation and hygiene. Studies on the reduction of diarrhea among SODIS users show reduction values of 30–80%.&lt;ref name="AutoSB-11" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoSB-12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoSB-13" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoSB-14" /&gt;

==Research==
The effectiveness of the SODIS was first discovered by Aftim Acra, of the [[American University of Beirut]] in the early 1980s. Follow-up was conducted by the research groups of [[Martin Wegelin]] at the [[Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology]] (EAWAG) and [[Kevin McGuigan]] at the [[Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland]]. Clinical control trials were pioneered by Ronan Conroy of the RCSI team in collaboration with [[Michael Elmore-Meegan]].[[ICROSS]]

A joint research project on SODIS was implemented by the following institutions:
* [[Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland]] (RCSI), Ireland (coordination)
* [[University of Ulster]] (UU), [[United Kingdom]]
* CSIR Environmentek, South Africa, EAWAG, Switzerland
* The [[Institute of Water and Sanitation Development]] ([[IWSD]]), Zimbabwe
* [[Plataforma Solar de Almería]] (CIEMAT-PSA), Spain
* [[University of Leicester]] (UL), United Kingdom
* The [[International Commission for the Relief of Suffering and Starvation]] ([[ICROSS]]), Kenya
* [[University of Santiago de Compostela]] (USC), Spain
* [[Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology]] (Eawag), Switzerland

The project embarked on a multi-country study including study areas in [[Zimbabwe]], [[South Africa]] and [[Kenya]].

Other developments include the development of a continuous flow disinfection unit&lt;ref name="pmid14766599" /&gt; and solar disinfection with titanium dioxide film over glass cylinders, which prevents the bacterial regrowth of [[Coliform bacteria|coliforms]] after SODIS.&lt;ref name="pmid16949121" /&gt;

Research has shown that a number of low-cost additives are capable of accelerating SODIS and that additives might make SODIS more rapid and effective in both sunny and cloudy weather, developments that could help make the technology more effective and acceptable to users.&lt;ref name="pmid17998606" /&gt;  A 2008 study showed that powdered seeds of five natural legumes (peas, beans and lentils)—''[[cowpea|Vigna unguiculata]]'' (cowpea), ''[[urad (bean)|Phaseolus mungo]]'' (black lentil), ''[[soybean|Glycine max]]'' (soybean), ''[[pea|Pisum sativum]]'' (green pea), and ''[[Arachis hypogaea]]'' (peanut)—when evaluated as natural flocculants for the removal of turbidity, were as effective as commercial alum and even superior for clarification in that the optimum dosage was low (1&amp;nbsp;g/L), flocculation was rapid (7–25 minutes, depending on the seed used) and the water hardness and pH was essentially unaltered.&lt;ref name="pmid18348392" /&gt; Later studies have used [[chestnuts]], [[oak]] acorns, and ''[[Moringa oleifera]]'' (drumstick tree) for the same purpose.&lt;ref name="AutoSB-15" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoSB-16" /&gt;

Other research has examined the use of doped semiconductors to increase the production of oxygen radicals under solar UV-A.&lt;ref name="AutoSB-17" /&gt; Recently, researchers at the [[National Centre for Sensor Research]] and the [[Biomedical Diagnostics Institute]] at [[Dublin City University]] have developed an inexpensive printable UV dosimeter for SODIS applications that can be read using a mobile phone.&lt;ref name="AutoSB-18" /&gt; The camera of the phone is used to acquire an image of the sensor and custom software running on the phone analyses the sensor colour to provide a quantitative measurement of UV dose.

In isolated regions the effect of wood smoke increases lung disease, due to the constant need for building fires to boil water and cook. Research groups have found that boiling of water is neglected due to the difficulty of gathering wood, which is scarce in many areas. When presented with basic household water treatment options residents in isolated regions in Africa have shown a preference for the SODIS method over boiling or other basic water treatment methods.

== Promotion ==
The Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (EAWAG), through the Department of Water and Sanitation in Developing Countries (Sandec), coordinates SODIS promotion projects in 33 countries including Bhutan, Bolivia, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Cameroon, DR Congo, Ecuador, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guatemala, Guinea, Honduras, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Laos, Malawi, Mozambique, Nepal, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Perú, Philippines, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Sri Lanka, Togo, Uganda, Uzbekistan, Vietnam, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.&lt;ref name="AutoSB-23" /&gt;

SODIS projects are funded by, among others, the [[SOLAQUA Foundation]],&lt;ref name="AutoSB-24" /&gt; several [[Lions Clubs]], [[Rotary International|Rotary]] Clubs, [[Migros]], and the Michel Comte Water Foundation.

SODIS has also been applied in several communities in Brazil, one of them being [[Prainha do Canto Verde]], [[Beberibe]] west of [[Fortaleza]]. Villagers there using the SODIS method have been quite successful, since the temperature during the day can go beyond {{convert|40|C|abbr=on}} and there is a limited amount of shade.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

One of the most important things to consider for public health workers reaching out to communities in need of suitable, cost efficient, and sustainable water treatment methods is teaching the importance of water quality in the context of health promotion and disease prevention while educating about the methods themselves. Although skepticism has posed a challenge in some communities to adopt SODIS and other household water treatment methods for daily use, disseminating knowledge on the important health benefits associated with these methods will likely increase adoption rates.

The '''Society of the Sons of St. George, established at Philadelphia for the advice and assistance of Englishmen in distress''', was founded in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], on [[Saint George's Day]], April 23, 1772.&lt;ref&gt;J. Thomas Scharf and Thompson Westcott: ''History of Philadelphia, 1609-1884'', Philadelphia: L. H. Everts &amp; Co., 1884, Vol. 2, p. 1467.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HS"&gt;''An Historical Sketch of the Origin and Progress of the Society of the Sons of St. George'', Philadelphia: Alfred M. Slocum Co., Printers, 1897, 257 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;  Earlier meetings were reportedly held at [[Tun Tavern]].

The society's [[charter]] in its act of incorporation approved by the Pennsylvania assembly on April 6, 1791,&lt;ref name="SGS"&gt;St. George's Society: ''Charter and By-laws of the St. George's Society'', Philadelphia: T. S. Manning, Printer, 1814, 16 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; states: "To all to whom these presents shall come, Greeting, know ye that we whose names are hereunto subscribed, being citizens of the [[Pennsylvania|Commonwealth of Pennsylvania]], having associated for the purpose of establishing in Philadelphia, a society for the advice and assistance of Englishmen, in distress, and being desirous of acquiring and enjoying the powers, and immunities of a [[corporation]] or body politic in law, according to an act of assembly of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, passed the sixth day of April, one thousand seven hundred and ninety-one, do hereby declare, that we have associated ourselves together for the purpose aforesaid, by the name, stile, and title, and under the articles and conditions following, that is to say: Article I. That the name style and title of this corporation, shall be "The Society of the Sons of St. George, established at Philadelphia, for the advice and assistance of Englishmen in distress."
[[File:St George Dragon Philly.JPG|thumb|upright=1.4|Sculpture of St. George and the Dragon from St. George's Hall, now in [[Fairmount Park]]]]
The seal of the society was described in the act of incorporation as a shield bordered with thirteen stars, on which is depicted [[Saint George]] slaying the dragon, with the [[eye of Providence]] beaming upon him, and on a wreath above, a young [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] rising from the flames. The motto on the upper edge was "The Seal of St. George's Society, Philadelphia," around the bottom edge, "I was a stranger, and ye took me in," and over the crest "Add to brotherly love, charity."

The Society’s founding meeting was held at Byrne's Tavern, on Front Street, below [[Walnut Street (Philadelphia)|Walnut Street]].&lt;ref&gt;St. George Society of Philadelphia, http://dev.stgeorgephiladelphia.org/index.html, n.d. (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;  The first officers elected at the organizational meeting were: President, The Rev. [[Richard Peters (priest)|Richard Peters]], D.D., Rector of [[Christ Church, Philadelphia|Christ Church]]; Vice-President, Mr. [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]]; Treasurer, Mr. Daniel Rundle; Secretary, Mr. Richard Peters, Jr.; Stewards, Mr. Richard Footman, Mr. [[Thomas Foxcroft]], William Parr, Esq., Dr. John Kearsley; and Messenger, John Airey.  The society carried out its charitable mission through the [[American Revolution]] and the [[War of 1812]].

In 1876, the club bought the Philadelphia mansion of tycoon [[Matthew Newkirk]] at 13th and Arch Streets, renamed it "St. George's Hall", and used it as their headquarters until the building was torn down in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libwww.freelibrary.org/diglib/SearchItem.cfm?searchKey=8635886458&amp;ItemID=pdcc00088 Photo: St. George's Hall, Thirteenth and Arch Sts., Free Library of Philadelphia]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1900s, the society provided support to British [[war bride]]s in [[World War I]] and [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;St. George Society of Philadelphia, 2009, ''op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Society was identical to the "Society of Englishmen, and Sons of Englishmen, Established at Philadelphia, for the Advice and Assistance of Englishmen in Distress" which met at [[Carpenters' Hall]] on St. George’s Day, April 23, 1773.&lt;ref&gt;J.

'''The Organization of Amputees Republike Srpske''' ('''UDAS''') (Serbian: Организација Aмпутираца УДАС Републике Српске/ Organizacija amputiraca ”UDAS” Republike Srpske)   is registered as a [[nonprofit organization]] and [[non-governmental organization]] based in [[Banja Luka|Banja Luka, Bosnia and Herzegovina]], founded by [[Amputation|amputees]] which are mostly landmine victims in order to provides support for victims of landmines, [[Unexploded ordnance|unexploded ordnance (UXO)]], [[cluster munition]] and other persons with [[Disability|disabilities]] and their families to integrate them back into the community, thus enabling them to live normal lives. 

== Overview ==
Organization of Amputees UDAS Republike Srpske is intended to protect and promote  [[Disability rights movement|rights of disabled population]] regardless of  type and manner of acquiring disability. The UDAS provides assistance primarily to survivors and their families, as well as other people with disabilities with various types of projects and activities: [[peer support]], referrals, social and economic [[Inclusion (disability rights)|inclusion]] activities, legal advising, survivors and disability rights campaign, [[Disability in the arts|disability arts]] and [[disabled sports]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Casualties and Victim Assistance|url=http://archives.the-monitor.org/index.php/cp/display/region_profiles/theme/2466|publisher=Landmine and cluster muniction rapport|accessdate= 1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Newsletter.No3|url=http://www.rcc.int/download/docs/Final_Newsletter+No3_RHDCMNH.pdf/eb94245439d21316c9faddb9b4db3c07|publisher=Regional Corporaction Council|accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UDAS maintains partnership with numbers of local and regional organizations that are supporting people with disabilities and, or organizations which are working on landmine cleansing. In addition to that, UDAS has partnerships with the city of Banja Luka and Ministries on both levels: Republic of Srpska and Bosnia and Herzegovina. UDAS participated and,or created various numbers of projects and activities supported by local, republican and state government, as well as [[United States Agency for International Development|USAID]], EU and Norwegian Embassy in Sarajevo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EU-supported projects|url=http://europa.ba/?p=38663|publisher=Delegation of European Union to Bosnia and Herzegovina|accessdate=1  December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The International day for Mine Awareness and Assistance in Mine Action|url=http://www.norveska.ba/News_and_events/Society-and-Policy/The-Norwegian-Embassy-supports-The-International-day-for-Mine-Awareness-and-Assistance-in-Mine-Action-/#.VzWMD9J97cf|publisher=The Norwegian Embassy in Sarajevo|accessdate=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization covers the entire area of the Republic of Srpska through five regional associations in Banja Luka, Doboj, Bijeljina, Istocno Sarajevo and Trebinje. It has around 4500 members, mostly victims of the mines and cluster munitions in BiH. The leaders of the UDAS are the survivors themselves. UDAS is a member of KOMA coaliction(Coalition for marginalized groups) and [[International Campaign to Ban Landmines|ICBL]]-[[Cluster Munition Coalition|CMC]] coaliction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=members|url=http://www.stopclustermunitions.org/en-gb/about-us/who-we-are/members/icbl-cmc-members.aspx|publisher=Cluster Munition Coalition|accessdate= 1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KOMA members|url=http://koma.ba/clanice-koalicije-koma/|publisher=KOMA|accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mission and values ===

:Guided by philanthropy, values of UDAS are premised on the belief that those with disabilities are entitled to lives of opportunity, independence and dignity. Moreover, society as a whole benefits when population with disability is included and empowered.  UDAS mission is to promotes and protects the human rights of people with  disabilities and actively supports their full inclusion and participation in the community throughout their lifetimes. UDAS vision is to create a prosperous society, society without barriers and prejudices ([[ableism]]) in which everybody has equal  rights and equal opportunities.

=== Brief history ===

:In the aftermath of Yugoslav wars, disabled population in Bosnia and Herzegovina found themselves seriously disadvantaged. People with disabilities with serious lack of governmental support, faced poverty and social exclusion, unequal access to health services, prejudices and discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Osobe sa invaliditetom u BiH:Diskriminacija u zakonodavstvu i praksi|url=http://www.slobodnaevropa.org/a/25438831.html|publisher=Radio Slobodna Evropa|accessdate=28 Jun 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to meet the basic needs of amputees (civilian and military) and other people with disability, UDAS is founded in 2002. by mostly landmine victims. In the beginning, UDAS had a lot of educational support from former local non-governmental organization ‘Landmine Survivors Initiatives’ (LSI). The organization began as 'The Association of Amputees UDAS Srpske' but later became 'The Organization of Amputees UDAS of Republic of Srpska'. In 2006 due to gained achievements and support given to persons with disabilities Government of Republic of Srpska declared Udas as an organisation of public interest.

== Land mine situation ==
During the 1992–95 [[Bosnian War|Bosnian war]], an estimated two million landmines were planted. Majority of locations of the landmines were not thoroughly mapped out and documented. This lack of documentation has complicated the demining process. Beside that, Bosnia’s mountainous and densely forested territory pose a major impediment to the demining process, as the best mechanical methods for demining only work on flat land. Thus, the demining process has largely been done by hand, an assuredly slow and laborious undertaking&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shifting minefields bosnias violent legacy in the wake of the balkan floods|url=http://www.ssrresourcecentre.org/2014/05/28/shifting-minefields-bosnias-violent-legacy-in-the-wake-of-the-balkan-floods/|publisher=The SSR Resource Centre| accessdate=28 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of it Bosnia and Herzegovina is still one of the most mine contaminated countries in South Easter Europe region. Current size of mine suspected area in BiH covers 1,165 km2 or 2.3% of the total country size, with 1,417 affected communities, directly impacting the safety of about 538,500 people, or about 15% of the total country population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PRESS RELEASE|url=http://www.bhmac.org/en/stream.daenet?sta=3&amp;pid=880&amp;kat=19|publisher=bhmac|accessdate=29 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cluster munition suspect area is 8.76 km2. An estimated 120,000 mines remain, according to the Bosnia and Herzegovina Mine Action Centre(BHMAC). For the period 1992–2013, BHMAC recorded a total of 8,319 mine/[[Unexploded ordnance|UXO]] casualties: 1,833 killed, 6,039 survivors, and 447 unknown. In many cases, one or more limbs had to be amputated. Than number keeps growing every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bosnia and Herzegovina: Casualties and Victim Assistance|url=http://www.the-monitor.org/en-gb/reports/2016/bosnia-and-herzegovina/casualties-and-victim-assistance.aspx|publisher=Mine Monitor|accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ten people were involved in land mine accidents in January 2014 alone, including a ten-year-old boy who died in an explosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bosnia mines still kill 20 years later|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2014/02/bosnia-mines-still-kill-20-years-later-201425131626160304.html|publisher=Al Jazeera|accessdate=12 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2014, BiH was severely affected by the worst [[2014 Southeast Europe floods|Balkan flood]] in over a century. Almost one third of Bosnia is affected by floods with houses, roads and railway lines being submerged in the north eastern part of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Balkans: Worst floods in Century continue to cause havoc|url=http://www.ifrc.org/en/news-and-media/news-stories/international/the-balkans-worst-floods-in-century-continue-to-cause-havoc-65957/|publisher=IFRC|accessdate=18 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One million people – approximately a quarter of the population – have been affected by the floods. Around of 70 percent of the flood-affected zones were in areas contaminated by mines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bosnia and Herzegovina floods, 2014.|url=http://europa.ba/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/delegacijaEU_2014090308560389eng.pdf|publisher=Delegation of European Union to Bosnia and Herzegovina|accessdate=5 Jun 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bosnian authorities reported that the floods had moved mines, cluster munitions, and unexploded ordnance (UXO), and had damaged minefield fencing and signs. At an ammunition depot in [[Orašje, Bosnia|Orašje]], some 250 tons of ammunition were reported as being under water on 25 May 2014. Landmine Survivors Initiatives reported that more than 3,000 mine survivors were living in the flood-affected region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mine Action|url=http://archives.the-monitor.org/index.php/cp/display/region_profiles/theme/3296#_ftn6|publisher=Landmine and cluster muniction rapport|accessdate= 9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inclusion ==
The UDAS is constantly working to improve the quality of life of persons with disabilities. UDAS actively organizes and participate in a range of innovative projects and activities together with organizations that focus on inclusion of people with disabilities. These activities projects cover community life, healthcare, employment, legislation, art and healthy lifestyle.

=== Health and social welfare  ===

In cooperation with Institute for physical medicine and rehabilitation “Dr Miroslav Zotović”, UDAS provides an individual and group peer to support people with disabilities, organizes educational seminars on topic of healthcare and social welfare, psychological counseling for disabled war veterans, amputees and mine victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Socijalni radnik u timu za lječenje i rehabilitaciju angiološki bolesnika i osoba sa amputacijama|url=http://www.zotovicbl.com/2015/04/socijalni-radnik-u-timu-za-lijecenje-i-rehabilitaciju-angioloskih-bolesnika-i-osoba-sa-amputacijama/|publisher=Zavod za fizikalnu medicinu i rehabilitaciju Dr Miroslav Zotovic|accessdate=1 Jun 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peer Support and Trauma Recovery|url=http://www.jmu.edu/cisr/journal/15.1/feature/macauley/macauley.shtml|publisher=Center for International Stabilization and Recovery,by Cameron Macauley|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mirror Therapy Introduced To Bosnia|url=http://endthepainprojectupdate.blogspot.ba/2013/10/mirror-therapy-introduced-to-bosnia.html|publisher=End The Pain Project|accessdate=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; All activities are led by professional associates, doctors and specialists. Also, in co-operation with Family Medicine Service, UDAS offers referrals for [[Community-based rehabilitation|CBR centers]].

=== Financial inclusion ===
 
Landmine contamination in B&amp;H has a significant impact on its economy. In particular branch of tourism, hunting and fishing, agriculture, animal husbandry as well as a safe use of natural resources. As a result of post-war unprosperous economy, persons with disabilities on average as a group experience worse socioeconomic situation, having to face at the same time with [[Disability and poverty|unemployment]] and [[Ableism|prejudges]] especially  about their employment. People with disabilities in BiH live below the poverty threshold. As a result of it persons with disabilities are usually been perceived as charity case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Invalide niko ne zapošljava|url=http://www.nezavisne.com/novosti/bih/Invalide-niko-ne-zaposljava/17537|publisher=Nezavisne novine|accessdate=2 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to fight poverty, main economic strategy of UDAS is to increase the income of persons with disabilities, through improvement of employment and self-employment opportunities. To do so, UDAS in co-operation with relevant foundations and/or institutions provides support in [[informal employment|Informal sector]] to people with disabilities to start up or expand small businesses (primarily in breach of livestock and agriculture), which will be run by themselves or their families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Organizacija amputiraca "Udas" RS obezbijedila ekonomsku podršku članovima |url=http://dobojski.info/drustvo-i-politika/item/10881-doboj-organizacija-amputiraca-udas-rs-obezbijedila-ekonomsku-podrsku-clanovim|publisher=Dobojski info|accessdate=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beside that, UDAS organised various educational and business seminars, workshops, and consulting.

=== Legislation and public advocacy===

When it comes to various sectors of public policy, disability is an often misunderstood and stigmatized condition.For that reason, UDAS's leadership takes particular interest in  implementation of advocacy, social policies and legislation for persons with disabilities.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Javne konsultacije analize uskladjenosti zakonodavstva BiH sa UN konvenciom o pravima Osoba sa invaliditetom|url=http://ukljuci.in/bs/oprojektu-3/880-odrzane-druge-javne-konsultacije-analize-uskladenosti-bih-zakonodavstva-sa-un-konvencijom-o-pravima-osoba-sa-invaliditetom-u-oblasti-zaposljavanja.php|publisher=In.projekt|accessdate=18 Jun 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Protest UDAS zbog kvaliteta ortopedskih pomagala |url=http://lat.rtrs.tv/vijesti/vijest.php?id=176855|publisher=RTRS|accessdate=19 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Postuj moje parking mjesto|url=http://www.capital.ba/mercator-i-udas-u-akciji-%E2%80%9Epostuj-moje-mjesto-za-parking/|publisher=18 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a disability right organisation, UDAS in co-operation with Ministries and Services worked on drafting, improvement,  practical implementation and adjustment of existing laws and regulations with the [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Government of Republic of Srpska held 37th Session|url=http://www.vladars.net/eng/vlada/ic/ns/Pages/Government_of_Republic_of_Srpska_held_37th_Session.aspx|publisher=Government Republika Srpska|accessdate=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Odrzan sastanak sa Organizacijom amputiraca RS|url=https://www.zdravstvo-srpske.org/vijesti/odrzan-sastanak-sa-organizacijom-amputiraca-rs.html|publisher=Health Insurance Fund of Republika Srpska|accessdate=18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outcome of combine actions was on the creation of the Soldiers’ Rights Act, Pension and Disability Insurance Act and Social Protection Act.UDAS as well, mounted activities to train individuals with disabilities about their new rights.

UDAS offers to persons with disability a legal support in terms of legal counseling, references and writing acts to relevant institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Training on "Writing proposals and preparation of local action plans in the field of disability" held in Bijeljina|url=http://ukljuci.in/en/about-project-2/724-training-on-writing-proposals-and-preparation-of-local-action-plans-in-the-field-of-disability-held-in-bijeljina.php|publisher=Ukljuci.In|accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report on cooperation between governments and civil society organizations|url=http://www.clusterconvention.org/files/2012/04/Report-on-cooperation-between-governments-and-civil-society-organizations-in-providing-support-to-the-victims.pdf|publisher=ClusterConvention|accessdate=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Culture ===
 
Through cultural activities, primarily through disability arts UDAS want to create a network of local and regional artists to highlight the barriers faced by persons with disabilities and promote the creative potential of artists on the local, national and regional level.

UDAS organizes various cultural and creative projects and activities for persons with and without disabilities, such as: drawing school and painting for children,workshop in creative writing, graphic workshops, [[Art colony|art colonies]], individual and collective exhibitions of art works, where priority is given to persons with disabilities. All activity have a clear psycho therapeutic aspect. Main cultural activity is doing art and handcraft.

=== Sport ===

Since a healthful lifestyles is one of most important segments of rehabilitation, the UDAS encourages and supports persons with disabilities (primary amputees) to participation in sport activities, to develop confidence, independence and general health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=15th International Sitting Volleyball Tournament "Princess Diana Memorial" and The Exhibition of Artworks created at The Regional Art Colony " Arts Beyond Barriers and Boundaries"|url=http://www.bhmac.org/en/stream.daenet?sta=3&amp;pid=647&amp;kat=19|publisher=BHMAC|accessdate=16 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In keeping with that UDAS financially supports The Shooting Club of amputees ‘Borac’ Banja Luka through projects and individuals through one-off aid, so amputees could participate in [[disabled sports]]. Beside that UDAS regularly organizes sections in chess,badminton and table tennis. All sports sections are led by persons who are trained to work with disabled people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kolektivna izložba Škole crtanja i slikanja|url=http://www.ukljuci.in/bs/vijesti-3/21-lokalni/2855-kolektivna-izlozba-skole-crtanja-i-slikanja.php|publisher=Ukljuci.in|accessdate=20 Jul 2016}}{{cite web|title=Likovna radionica u Galeriji UDAS|url=http://www.ukljuci.in/bs/vijesti-3/21-lokalni/2838-likovna-radionica-u-galeriji-udas.php|publisher=Ukljuci.in|accessdate=12 July 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9158">The '''Three-Year Plan of Reconstructing the Economy''' ({{lang-pl|Trzyletni Plan Odbudowy Gospodarki}}) was a [[central planning|centralized]] [[Soviet plan|plan]] created by the [[Polish communist]] government to rebuild [[History of Poland (1945–1989)#Wartime devastation|Poland after the devastation of the Second World War]]. The plan was carried out between 1947 to 1949. It succeeded in its primary aim of largely rebuilding Poland from the devastation of the war, as well as in increasing output of Polish industry and agriculture.

==Development and goals==
Poland suffered [[World War II casualties|heavy losses during World War II]]. In addition to significant population losses,&lt;ref name="state.gov"&gt;US Department of State, Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs. [https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2875.htm Background Note: Poland] (March 2007). Retrieved on 2007-04-07&lt;/ref&gt; it suffered catastrophic damage to its [[infrastructure]] during the war; the losses in national resources and [[infrastructure]] amounted to over 30% percent of pre-war potential.&lt;ref name="Piotrowski-21"&gt;{{cite book | author =Piotrowski, Tadeusz | title = Poland's Holocaust: Ethnic Strife, Collaboration with Occupying Forces and Genocide... | year =1997 |pages =21 | publisher =McFarland &amp; Company | isbn =0-7864-0371-3| url =https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0786403713&amp;id=A4FlatJCro4C&amp;pg=PA295&amp;lpg=PA295&amp;dq=1939+Soviet+citizenship+Poland&amp;sig=qETeuFX3hbmM0VPSO13o0LmjgEc#PPA21,M1 | authorlink = Tadeusz Piotrowski (sociologist) }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rebuilding of the economy was also made more difficult by the major [[territorial changes of Poland after World War II]].&lt;ref name="IPN-MM"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.ipn.gov.pl/biuletyn/13/biuletyn02_2.html | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20050321165047/http://www.ipn.gov.pl/biuletyn/13/biuletyn02_2.html | title= MIĘDZY MODERNIZACJĄ A MARNOTRAWSTWEM | archivedate= 2005-03-21 | publisher= [[Institute of National Remembrance]] | language= Polish }} See also [http://www.niniwa2.cba.pl/komunizm_gospodarka_prl_ipn.htm other copy online] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070426011453/http://www.niniwa2.cba.pl/komunizm_gospodarka_prl_ipn.htm |date=2007-04-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Three-Year Plan was developed and monitored by the [[Central Planning Office]] (''Centralny Urząd Planowania''), a body of the government tasked with creation of [[economic policy]], and in the early years dominated by a more liberal [[Polish Socialist Party]] (PPS) faction.&lt;ref name="IPN-MM"/&gt; Among the economists involved in its development was the then CUP director, [[Czesław Bobrowski]].&lt;ref name="IPN-MM"/&gt; CUP centralized planning for the entire Polish economy was previously broken into separate bodies working on planning for separate branches.

The plan, significantly influenced by the PPS,&lt;ref name="IPN-MM"/&gt; was designed to create a balance between the [[private sector]], the [[public sector]] and the [[cooperatives]].&lt;ref name="IPN-MM"/&gt; Instead of [[ideology]], commonly stressed by later communist plans, it concentrated on the realistic problems and ways to address them.&lt;ref name="IPN-MM"/&gt;

On 21 September 1946 the [[State National Council]] (KRN), a [[Polish communist]]-dominated unelected Polish parliament accepted the plan for the [[Polish economy]] up to 1949. On 2 July 1947 the [[Polish legislative election, 1947|newly elected]] [[Sejm]] declared that: "The primary goal of the national economy in the years 1947-1949 is to raise the [[living conditions]] of working [[social class|classes]] to above the pre-war levels."

The plan as described by the above bodies was designed to develop industry and service sectors, foreign trade and ensure the supply of basic consumer items. The plan specified the size of industrial and agricultural production to be achieved in the following years. In 1949 both the industrial and agricultural productions were to be above the pre-war levels. The industrial output was also to be higher than agricultural output. The plan did not involve creation of new industrial centers, only the rebuilding of the old ones (unless they were over 50% destroyed&lt;ref name="IPN-MM"/&gt;).

==Results and assessment==
Due to the dedication of substantial resources to industrial rebuilding, and the successful adoption of the [[Stakhanovite movement]] (the [[communist propaganda]] of that time created a new "hero of the working class", [[Wincenty Pstrowski]]), where workers were encouraged to work above their quota, the expected increase in industrial output was reached ahead of schedule.&lt;ref name="IPN-MM"/&gt; However, the agricultural output did not increase as much as predicted,&lt;ref name="IPN-MM"/&gt; partially due to bad weather in 1947, partially due to inefficiencies involved in [[collectivization]] of farming and finally, partially due to side-effects of the [[battle for trade]], which damaged traditional [[supply chain]]s. In 1948 industrial production was 30% higher compared to 1939, but agricultural production was 30% lower (compared to the 1934-38 period).&lt;ref name="IPN-MM"/&gt;

The battle for trade, pushed for by [[Stalinist]] hardliners like [[Hilary Minc]], suggested that both the cooperative and private sectors should be eliminated and the public sector should be dominant,&lt;ref name="IPN-MM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PWNEnc"/&gt; assumptions contrary to the foundations of the three-year plan which stated that all three sectors are equal.&lt;ref name="IPN-MM"/&gt; The battle for trade also resulted in a decrease of the [[Handicraft|craftmanship]] sector.&lt;ref name="PWNEnc"&gt;{{pl icon}} [http://encyklopedia.pwn.pl/haslo.php?id=4575032 Polska. Gospodarka. Przemysł.]. [[Internetowa encyklopedia PWN|Encyklopedia PWN]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Already in 1949 the stress was moved from [[consumer goods]] to [[producer goods]], and [[light industry]] development was slowed. The next plan in the Polish communist economy was the [[Six-Year Plan]] (1950–1956), much more critically assessed by modern historians and economists, as by 1950 the CUP and Polish government were dominated by Stalinist hardliners, and PPS economists responsible for creation of the Three-Year Plan were no longer influencing government policy.&lt;ref name="IPN-MM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PWNEnc"/&gt; The Six-Year Plan, designed to bring the [[economy of Poland]] in line with the [[Soviet economy]], concentrated on [[heavy industry|heavy industrialization]], with projects such as [[Nowa Huta]].&lt;ref name="IPN-MM"/&gt;

Rebuilding of the Polish economy was also slowed in 1947, as Soviet influence caused the Polish government to reject the American-sponsored [[Marshall Plan]], designed to aid European economies in post-war rebuilding.&lt;ref name="IPN-MM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marshall"&gt;[[Martin A. Schain|Schain, Martin A.]] ''The Marshall Plan: fifty years after'', Palgrave, 2001, {{ISBN|0-312-22962-3}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ybAQmmyrLN8C&amp;vid=ISBN0312229623&amp;dq=Poland+Marshall+1947&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;sig=gUq-CmKAWOBGABGPxCh9QKFqySY&amp;q=Poland#PPA133,M1 Google Print, p.132]&lt;/ref&gt;

With the simultaneous rebuilding of the cities, substantial migration from rural areas to urban centers occurred, increasing [[urbanization]]. [[Warsaw]] and other ruined cities were cleared of rubble and rebuilt with great speed during those years.&lt;ref name="poloniatodayhistory"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080117214309/http://www.poloniatoday.com/history13.htm A brief history of Poland. Chapter 13: "The Post-War Years, 1945-1990."] Polonia Today Online. Retrieved on 28 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, 60% of Poles worked in agriculture and 13% in industry; in 1949, the figures were 47% and 21%, respectively.

The three-year plan is widely considered a success and the only efficient economic plan in the history of [[People's Republic of Poland]].&lt;ref name="IPN-MM"/&gt; It succeeded in its primary aim: mostly rebuilding Poland from the devastation of the war, as well as in increasing output of Polish industry and agriculture.&lt;ref name="IPN-MM"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2438">In the United Kingdom''', Trading Standards''' are the local authority departments, formerly known as ''[[Weights and Measures Acts of the United Kingdom|Weights and Measures]]'', that enforce consumer protection legislation.&lt;ref name="WMBC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Trading standards|url=https://go.walsall.gov.uk/Business/Trading_standards|website=go.walsall.gov.uk|publisher=Walsall MBC|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Sometimes, the Trading Standards enforcement functions of a local authority are performed by part of a larger department which enforces a wide range of other legislation: environmental health, health and safety, licensing and so on. These departments investigate commercial organisations that trade outside the law or in unethical ways. They attempt to remedy breaches by advice or by formal enforcement action.

==History==
They were originally labelled as Weights and Measures Departments because their primary function was to maintain the integrity of commercial weighing and measuring by routine testing of equipment and goods. Other legislation was allocated to them as time went on.

==Function==
They now deal with more diverse issues under a wide variety of Acts, Orders and Codes of Practice, as set out by central government, the [[Food Standards Agency]]. Such legislation includes the [[Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008]], the [[Consumer Protection Act 1987]], the [[Consumer Credit Act 1974]], the [[Food Safety Act 1990]], the Price Marking Order 2004 and the [[Consumer Rights Act 2015]]. Recent priorities include prevention of sales of counterfeit goods, sales of tobacco and alcohol to under-age buyers, and action to prevent exploitation of vulnerable consumers by scams and doorstep crime.  In 2017, the Trading Standards of [[Somerset]], [[Devon]] and [[Torbay]] donated 5000 items of counterfeit clothes to the charity Planet Zero after the clothes were seized and rebranded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.devonlive.com/thousands-of-fake-designer-clothes-handed-to-charity/story-30416001-detail/story.html|title=Thousands of fake designer clothes handed to charity|date=2017-06-29|work=Devon Live|access-date=2017-06-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the Ontario provincial branch of the [[United Farmers (disambiguation)|United Farmers]]&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt; movement of the early part of the 20th century.

==History==

===Foundation and rise (1914-1919)===
[[File:Ernest Drury.jpg|left|thumb|Ernest C. Drury, UFO premier and leader]]
The UFO was founded in 1914 by the union of various farmers' organizations that had been created over the previous fifteen years.&lt;ref name=ce&gt;Macpherson, Ian, [http://thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0008229 "United Farmers of Ontario"], ''The Canadian Encyclopedia''&lt;/ref&gt; [[James J. Morrison]] was the leading figure in the party, serving as its [[general secretary]] and secretary of the United Farmers Co-operative Company Ltd. (the purchasing co-operative the UFO operated on behalf of its members). The organization grew rapidly and by 1917 it had 350 local clubs and 12,000 members.&lt;ref name=nfu&gt;http://www.nfu.ca/ont-1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The UFO had a comprehensive farmer's platform that called for the nationalization of railways, [[progressive tax]]ation, and legislation that would facilitate the operation of [[co-operative]]s. In 1917, supporters of the UFO formed the Farmers' Publishing Company and purchased ''The Weekly Sun'' renaming it ''[[The Farmer's Sun]]'' to act as the organ of the UFO.

The UFO entered politics by contesting and winning a [[by-election]] in [[Manitoulin (electoral district)|Manitoulin]] in 1918, in which [[Beniah Bowman]] was elected as the party's first [[Member of the Legislative Assembly]] (MLA). In the [[Ontario general election, 1919|1919 provincial election]], with over 50,000 members,&lt;ref name=ce/&gt; the party sought to hold the [[balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]] so it could introduce legislation friendly to farmers. It co-operated with the [[Labour Party of Canada|Independent Labour Party]] with the two organizations not running candidates against each other - the UFO contested rural ridings and the ILP stood candidates in urban areas. In total there were 64 UFO candidates, 20 ILP candidates and 10 Farmer-Labour candidates in the [[Ontario general election, 1919|1919 provincial election]]. The UFO platform called for the abolition of political [[patronage]], better educational opportunities in rural areas, cheap electric power, conservation of forests, [[proportional representation]] and [[direct democracy|"direct legislation"]]. The UFO also favoured [[prohibition]] and budgetary restraint, two platform planks that were at odds with the views of urban Labour supporters.&lt;ref name=nfu/&gt; To the shock of everyone, including itself, it won 45 seats and formed a [[coalition government]] with the support of Labour MLAs in the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]] despite having no leader.

As the United Farmers began as a [[Single-issue politics|single-issue party]], Morrison opposed forming a government, believing that the party should concern itself solely with [[agricultural]] issues and that it would not be able to represent the entire province. Furthermore, he viewed the [[Labour Party of Canada|Independent Labour Party]] as inimical to farmers' interests and opposed a coalition with them to form a [[majority government]]. Morrison was offered the position of UFO caucus leader and [[Premier of Ontario]] following the election but declined as did Sir [[Adam Beck]]; the position instead went [[Ernest C. Drury]].&lt;ref name=ce/&gt;

===Forming the government (1919-1923)===
Despite Morrison's objections, the UFO joined with 10 Independent Labour Party MLAs (an 11th ILP MLA, [[Morrison MacBride]], broke with his colleagues and sat in Opposition) and one Independent to form a [[coalition government]], with Drury as [[List of Ontario premiers|Premier]] and two of the ILP MLAs in the cabinet.&lt;ref name=ndp&gt;[http://www.westernnewdemocrats.ca/?page_id=9 Labour and Farmers in Ontario 1919 - 1932], ''History of the NDP'', accessed February 13, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Morrison remained outside of the legislature and government as the general secretary of the UFO. Morrison opposed a number of the coalition's initiatives, perceiving the UFO's actions as a broad-based Progressive government rather than a "class-based" United Farmer government and believed that the party should not be in government but should hold the [[balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]] in order to force the government of the day to pass pro-farmer legislation.&lt;ref name=ndp/&gt;

Drury's Farmer-Labour government created the first Department of Welfare for the province and brought in allowances for widows and children, a [[minimum wage]] for women and standardized adoption procedures.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;"Free-trader, writer and farmer, former Premier E.C. Drury dies" Globe and Mail, February 19, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; His government also expanded [[Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario|Ontario Hydro]] and promoted rural electification, created the [[Province of Ontario Savings Office]] - a provincially owned bank that was designed to lend money to farmers at a lower rate  - began the first major reforestation program in North America, and began construction of the modern highway system. The government was also a strict enforcer of [[Temperance movement|temperance]] measures. Drury also arranged for a grant for unknown researchers [[Frederick Banting]] and [[Charles Herbert Best|Charles Best]] who later discovered [[insulin]].&lt;ref name=ce/&gt;&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; The UFO grew quickly to 1,500 clubs and 60,000 members by 1920.&lt;ref name=nfu/&gt;

The government under Drury tried to be a "people's government" rather than a "class government" and argued for a "broadening out" of the party to include labour and others, but in so doing, alienated the base of the government's support, particularly farmers. The UFO government clashed with the UFO organization (led by James J. Morrison) which eventually withdrew its support from the government.

The party's base of farmer supporters began to turn away from the party, causing the Drury government to lose the [[Ontario general election, 1923|election of 1923]]. Seventeen United Farmer and four Labour members returned to the Legislature, compared to 75 [[Ontario Progressive Conservative Party|Conservatives]]. Drury lost his own seat.

===Decline (1923-1929)===
[[File:Harry Nixon.jpg|left|thumb|[[Harry Nixon]], the last leader of the Progressives.]]
Though the United Farmers of Ontario remained the second largest party in the legislature, they were denied [[Official Opposition]] status by [[Conservative Party of Ontario|Conservative]] premier [[Howard Ferguson]]. The position was instead given to the [[Liberal Party of Ontario|Liberals]] with [[W.E.N. Sinclair]] as [[Leader of the Opposition (Ontario)|Leader of the Opposition]], despite the party having three fewer seats than the UFO. Morrison had announced that the UFO would be withdrawing from politics, which Ferguson had used as justification for the move. [[Manning Doherty]], interim leader of the UFO caucus, could do nothing aside from win a ruling from the Speaker that, as leader of a caucus of more than 15 MLAs, he was entitled to an extra salary.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver, Peter ''G. Howard Ferguson: Ontario Tory'', Toronto and Buffalo: University of Toronto Press, 1977, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

Eighteen months following the general election, [[William Raney]] was elected unanimously by his caucus as leader of what was now referred to as the "Progressive" bloc of MLAs which had begun as Farmer and Labour MLAs. [[Leslie Oke]] and [[Beniah Bowman]] refused to accept the leadership of Raney, a non-farmer, and also disagreed with the creation of a "Progressive Party" which would include non-farmers -  with the support of ''The Farmer's Sun'', they insisted on continuing to sit as UFO members rather than with the Progressive group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=PROGRESSIVE GROUP CHOOSES MR. RANEY AS HOUSE LEADER|work=The Globe|date=21 January 1925}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=PROGRESSIVE GROUP WILL LOSE SUPPORT OF FARMER MEMBER: Leslie W.

The issue which dominated Ontario politics in the mid 1920s was the [[Howard Ferguson|Ferguson]] government's proposal to repeal the ''[[Ontario Temperance Act]]'' and replace prohibition with government control of liquor. The Liberals, were split on the issue - most of their MLAs were "dry" but some were "wets" who were opposed to prohibition. The Progressives under Raney, however, were adamantly in favour of prohibition and opposed to Ferguson's proposals. This led to an estrangement with  Labour MLA [[Karl Homuth]] who supported Ferguson's proposals and would eventually join the Conservatives.

The [[Ontario general election, 1926|1926 provincial election]] reduced the farmer-labour contingent to thirteen Progressive MLAs and one Labour MLA (Homuth - who had broken with the Progressives and supported the government) while two new UFO MLAs, [[Thomas Farquhar]] and [[Farquhar Oliver]] joined Oke's faction. Several weeks after the election the UFO convention voted to cease running its own candidates though a handful of local UFO clubs continued to nominate candidates for some years.

===End of the movement (1927-1940)===
[[File:Farquhar Oliver.JPG|thumb|Farquhar Oliver, last UFO MLA in the provincial legislature.]]
Raney resigned from the legislature the next year in order to accept an appointment to the [[Supreme Court of Ontario]] and 72-year-old [[John Giles Lethbridge]] was chosen as the new leader of the Progressives. In the [[Ontario general election, 1929|1929 election]], only five Progressives, one Labour and one UFO MLA won re-election. Lethbridge, like Raney in the previous election, campaigned largely on the issue of [[prohibition]]. After Lethbridge lost his seat in the 1929 election [[Harry Nixon]], who had served as [[Provincial Secretary]] in Drury's government, became the leader of the remaining Progressives. In the early 1930s, Nixon and the Progressives agreed to an alliance with former UFO activist [[Mitchell Hepburn]] who, in 1930, became leader of the Liberal Party. A group of four [[Liberal-Progressive]] MLAs, led by Nixon, were elected in the [[Ontario general election, 1934|1934 election]], who joined Hepburn to form a government and were eventually absorbed into the Liberal Party. ''(see [[Liberal-Progressive#Ontario|Liberal-Progressives (Ontario)]] for more information)''

In 1932, leading UFO member [[Agnes Macphail]] (originally elected to the [[Progressive Party of Canada|Progressive Party]]) encouraged the UFO to affiliate with [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] (CCF) when it was formed.&lt;ref name=ce/&gt; It did so, and MacPhail became the first Chairman of the [[Ontario CCF]] in 1932, but the UFO disaffiliated from the CCF in 1934 due to allegations of [[Communism|communist]] influence in the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=C.C.F.

The UFO, like United Farmers groups in the provinces of western Canada, decided to withdraw entirely from electoral politics though Oliver and Macphail continued to run under the UFO banner until 1940. Many United Farmers joined the CCF as individuals. The UFO's newspaper, ''The Farmer's Sun'', was sold to [[Graham Spry]] and [[Alan Plaunt]] and became an organ for the [[League for Social Reconstruction]] and the Ontario CCF.

In the [[Canadian federal election, 1935|1935 federal election]], the UFO's provincial executive voted to endorse the new [[Reconstruction Party of Canada]] formed by [[H.H. Stevens]], however many local UFO groups backed the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]]&lt;ref&gt;"Liberals busy, CCF active, other factions hold fire", ''Toronto Daily Star'', July 19, 1935&lt;/ref&gt; and UFO MP Agnes MacPhail continued to work with the CCF on an informal basis. Other UFOers backed the Liberals. The Reconstruction Party won 11% of the vote in Ontario in the 1935 federal election, more than the CCF, but failed to win a seat in the province and only won one seat nationally.

In 1936, the UFO, the United Farmers’ Co-operative Ltd., and various growers and other agricultural organizations formed the Ontario Chamber of Agriculture which, in 1940, became the [[Ontario Federation of Agriculture]] (OFA), a non-partisan lobbying and marketing organization for farmers. In 1943, the UFO ceased to exist as a formal organization and its remnants were absorbed by the OFA.&lt;ref name=ce/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ofa.on.ca/uploads/userfiles/files/a%20brief%20history.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-12-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141223081340/http://www.ofa.on.ca/uploads/userfiles/files/a%20brief%20history.pdf |archive-date=2014-12-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948 the United Farmers' Co-operative became the [[United Co-operatives of Ontario]] and remains one of the largest farmer-owned [[co-operative]]s in Canada.&lt;ref name=ce/&gt;

In 1940, Oliver, the last remaining UFO member of the Legislature and a supporter of the Hepburn government since 1934, joined the Hepburn cabinet and became a Liberal. MacPhail lost her seat as the last United Farmers MP in the House of Commons in the [[Canadian federal election, 1940|1940 election]]. She turned to provincial politics and won election to the Ontario Legislature as a candidate of the CCF in the [[Ontario general election, 1943|1943 provincial election]] while Oliver became Liberal Party leader in 1945.

==United Farmers Co-operative Company Grocers==

Around 1919, the UFO hired [[Theodore Loblaw]] to help launch a chain of cooperative grocery stores, but the attempt failed and Loblaw left to start [[Loblaw Companies|his own grocery chain]].

'''Water exports''' involve [[export]]ing [[Fresh water|freshwater]] from one country to another. Large increases in human [[Population growth|population]] and [[economic growth]] throughout the world during the twentieth century placed a huge stress on the world’s freshwater resources. Combined with [[global warming|climate change]], they will place an even greater demand on water resources in this century. Water shortages have become an international concern, and freshwater has been described as “blue gold”&lt;ref name=Barlow&gt;Barlow, Maude, and Clarke, Tony, 2003, ''Blue Gold: The Battle Against Corporate Theft of the World’s Water'', James &amp; James/Earthscan, {{ISBN|1-84407-024-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and “the oil of the 21st Century.”&lt;ref name=Lawrence&gt;Lawrence, 1996, cited in Anderson, Terry L., and Landry, Clay J., ''Exporting Water To The World''[http://www.ucowr.siu.edu/updates/pdf/V118_A8.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:North America satellite orthographic.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A satellite image of North America. The Great Lakes are in the east, while the south-west clearly lacks water.]]
Canada has 7% of the world’s renewable supply of freshwater.&lt;ref name="Environment Canada"&gt;Environment Canada [http://www.ec.gc.ca/eau-water/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=2DE7B40F-1].&lt;/ref&gt; Freshwater export between Canada and the US currently takes place at a small scale, mostly as bottled water exports. The [[bottled water]] industry exports water in containers usually no larger than twenty litres.&lt;ref name="Heinmiller" /&gt; But even that can be controversial -  the multinational food giant [[Nestlé|Nestle]] was accused of attempting to “drain” the town of [[Hillsburgh, Ontario]], of its water in 2012 and 2013, during a drought.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2013/06/04/nestle-canada-water-drought_n_3385472.html?|title = Nestle Canada Water Dispute: Company Denies It Wants To Take Water During Times Of Drought|date = June 4, 2013|accessdate = March 23, 2015|website = Huffington Post Canada|publisher = |last = Tencer|first = Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1850 Americans have been diverting much of the water of the [[Chicago River]], which would naturally flow into [[Lake Michigan]], into the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] basin over [[Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal]]. In that case, though, the goal was not taking possession of the water that would otherwise end up in the Great Lakes, but directing Chicago's effluent away from Lake Michigan, Chicago's source of water.

=== Needs ===
Many states in the US have experienced water shortages in the past few decades, creating a market for freshwater that could be profitable for Canada. In the south-western US, growing populations and lifestyles that consume large amounts of water have caused most of the [[aquifer]]s and rivers in the region to be overused. The water in the [[Oglala Aquifer]], which serves much of the west-central US, was used eight times faster in 2001 than the replenishment rate. Demands for this freshwater are expected to increase as the climate warms.&lt;ref name="Schindler"&gt;Schindler, D.W., The cumulative effects of climate warming and other stresses on Canadian freshwaters in the new millennium, in Bendell-Young, Leah and Gallaugher, Patricia, 2001, ''Waters in Peril'', Springer Science, {{ISBN|0-7923-7504-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As human populations and industries grow and the climate change takes place, greater pressure will be placed on water-rich countries like Canada to export their water to countries that have a water shortage.&lt;ref name="Schindler" /&gt; In early 2014, [[Gary Doer]], Canada’s ambassador to the United States, said that by 2020 the pressure on water quality and quantity would be immense. He predicted that water debates and disputes between the two countries would make the clash over the [[Keystone XL pipeline]] “look silly” by comparison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/in-a-water-war-canada-could-get-hosed/article17139638/|title = In a water war, Canada could get hosed|date = February 28, 2014|accessdate = March 23, 2015|website = |publisher = The Globe and Mail|last = Mason|first = Gary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Proposals ===
Numerous proposals about transferring large amounts of freshwater from the [[Great Lakes Basin]] into the US have been made. This would involve [[drainage basin|inter-basin]] transport of water across the international boundary between Canada and the US using a man-made [[reservoir]]. None of these proposals have as yet been implemented, mainly due to environmental and financial obstacles.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

Schemes to export water from Canada to the US on a large scale have been proposed in the past. These schemes include:
* The [[Great Recycling and Northern Development Canal|Great Recycling and Northern Development (GRAND) Canal]] scheme to dam [[James Bay]], on the southern end of Hudson Bay, to create a freshwater reservoir and divert the water from the 20 rivers that flow into it to [[Georgian Bay]]. The water would then be flushed through the [[Great Lakes]] into pipelines to the south-western US.
* The North American Water and Power Alliance ([[NAWAPA]]) project proposed to divert the [[Yukon River|Yukon]], [[Liard]], and [[Peace River (Canada)|Peace]] rivers into the [[Rocky Mountain Trench]] to create an 800&amp;nbsp;km long reservoir that would transfer water into the US.&lt;ref name="Schindler" /&gt;
* During the 1990s, exporting water by ocean-going tankers was proposed to three Canadian provinces.&lt;ref name="Heinmiller" /&gt; In 1991, [[Sun Belt Water Inc.]] of Santa Barbara, California, in partnership with Snowcap Waters Ltd., of Fanny Bay, British Columbia, was selected by the Goleta Water District, of California, to enter a contract to supply bulk water by marine tanker but the government of British Columbia reversed its water export policy and introduced a prohibition on the issuance of water export licences leading to an arbitration claim against Canada under Chapter 11 of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] filed by [[Sun Belt Water Inc.]] in 1999. The arbitration remains unresolved.
* In 1999 Nova Group Ltd. obtained a permit from the [[Ontario]] government to export 600 millions litres of water annually from [[Lake Superior]] to Asia. Political controversy in Canada and the US caused the government to cancel the permit.&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;Anderson, Terry L., and Landry, Clay J., ''Exporting Water To The World''[http://www.ucowr.siu.edu/updates/pdf/V118_A8.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Concerns ===
In [[Canada]] there have been concerns about exporting water to the United States since the 1960s, when states in the south-western US experienced their first water shortages and began to seek water sources to augment their overstretched supplies.&lt;ref name="Heinmiller"&gt;Heinmiller, B. Timothy, Harmonization Through Emulation: Canadian Federalism and Water Export Policy [http://www.cnfs-rcef.net/education/workshop_pdfs/heinmiller_water.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;  Large-scale removal of water from lakes would negatively affect their [[ecosystem]]s, increasing pollution concentrations and harming plant and animal [[community|communities]].&lt;ref name="Schindler" /&gt;

=== Legal issues ===
Water has been classed as a commodity under the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) since the 1980s. This has increased tensions in the debate about exporting water. Although none of the NAFTA rules force Canada to begin to export its water in bulk, if Canada voluntarily decides to begin exports it would be very difficult to later halt them.&lt;ref name="Heinmiller" /&gt;

In 2002 the Federal government of Canada passed the [[International Boundary Waters Treaty Act]]. This banned the removal of more than 50 million cubic meters of water from a water basin in the Great Lakes in one day. The Boundary Waters Treaty is limited to waters on the Canadian-US border and does not apply to freshwater in other parts of Canada. This means the about 85 percent of Canada’s water is susceptible to export.&lt;ref name="Fischhendler"&gt;Fischhendler, Itay, 2003, Can Basin Management Be Successfully Ignored: The Case Of The US-Canada Transboundary Water, SOAS Water Issues Study Group [http://www.soas.ac.uk/waterissues/occasionalpapers/OCC52.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alaska ===
Since Canada has taken a strong position against water exports, some companies have shifted their focus to [[Alaska]].&lt;ref name="Anderson" /&gt; Alaska was the first jurisdiction in the world to permit the commercial export of bulk water, and has a large potential for water exports.&lt;ref name="Barlow" /&gt; One scheme proposes transporting water from Alaska to [[China]] by tanker. This water would be used to assemble [[Wafer fabrication|computer wafers]] by China’s relatively cheap labour force. Computer wafers require extremely pure freshwater. This makes the cost of [[desalination]] of saltwater prohibitively expensive, making schemes like this, that would not be profitable for domestic purposes, profitable for industrial purposes.&lt;ref name="Figueres"&gt;Figuères, Caroline M., Tortaiada, Cecilia, and Rockström, Johan, 2003, ''Rethinking Water Management: Innovative Approaches to Contemporary Issues'', James &amp; James/Earthscan, {{ISBN|1-85383-999-X}}, page 57-60.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Water exports within States in the United States==
On June 13, 2013, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] unanimously upheld lower court rulings in Tarrant Regional Water District v. Herrmann, holding that [[Oklahoma]] state water laws validly barred state entities from selling water for out-of-state use, via the Red River Compact among Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=U.S. Supreme Court Sides with Oklahoma In Dispute with Texas Water District |url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/us-supreme-court-sides-oklahoma-dispute-texas-water-district |accessdate=29 June 2013 |newspaper=The National Law Review |date=June 28, 2013 |author1=Daniel M.

==Water export in Germany==
While the [[Rhine–Main–Danube Canal]] was primarily built as a freight link across the European Main Watershed (linking North Sea and Black Sea via inland waterways), it is also used to transport water from the Danube to the less water-rich rivers of [[Franconia]] and adjacent regions. To this end several artificial lakes like the [[Großer Brombachsee]] were created.

==Water exports from Russia to Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan==
{{main|Northern river reversal}}
Arid but densely populated southern [[Kazakhstan]] and adjacent [[Central Asian]] states occupy somewhat similar position with respect to [[Russia]]'s Siberia as the south-western United States do with respect to Canada. Siberian rivers, as well as rivers of northern European Russia flow "uselessly" into the seas of the Arctic Ocean, while that water could be much more profitably used for irrigated agriculture by Russia's southern neighbors. Not surprisingly, [[Northern river reversal|proposals]] for large-scale transfer of water from the [[Ob River]] in Siberia to the [[Aral Sea]] basin in Kazakhstan and [[Uzbekistan]] have been seriously considered by the [[USSR|Soviet]] federal government already in the 1960-80s, when all republics involved were members of the USSR. While welcomed by many in Central Asian republics, the project received severe criticism from many scientists as well as prominent writers and journalists in Russia, such as [[Valentin Rasputin]] and [[Sergey Pavlovich Zalygin|Sergey Zalygin]], sometimes known collectively as the "Siberian environmental lobby"&lt;ref&gt;Ronnie D.

Both the Kazakh President [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]] and the Uzbek President [[Islam Karimov]] expressed interest in such a water transfer scheme. While the Russian federal government so far remains non-committal on the issue, the plan met enthusiastic response from Moscow mayor and Russian presidential hopeful, [[Yuri Luzhkov]].&lt;ref&gt;By Bess A.

==Alternatives to large-scale water exports==
In the short run, better allocation of resources and more efficient [[water conservation]] technology may keep demand for water in some countries under control. However, a water crisis may occur in the near future that would make bulk water export a more favourable plan.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

The canals that would have to be constructed to transfer water require huge investment and operation costs. This would make the cost for consumers of the water expensive. In contrast, the technology needed to desalinise seawater has improved dramatically and has an acceptable cost for urban markets. Whether or not pressures for large-scale water exports continues to increase depends mostly on future advances in desalination technology. If the cost of desalination drops enough, it will be cheaper to generate freshwater from saltwater than to import freshwater from another country. The cost of desalination is currently less than US$1 per cubic meter. The [[World Water Commission]] has suggested that desalination will become the favoured method of procuring drinking and industrial-use waters. However, the need for extremely pure water for particular industrial uses would still require freshwater imports.&lt;ref name=Figueres/&gt;
