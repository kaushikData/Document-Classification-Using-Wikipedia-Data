The '''Alfred Caldwell Lily Pool''', also known as '''[[Lincoln Park]] Lily Pool''', is an important example of [[Prairie School]] [[landscape architecture]] designed by [[Alfred Caldwell]] and located at 125 W. Fullerton Parkway (between Stockton and Cannon Drives) in [[Lincoln Park, Chicago|Lincoln Park]], [[Chicago, Illinois]].  Developed in 1936-38, it is one of Caldwell's most fully realized designs.&lt;ref name="NRHP Registration"/&gt; It was designated a [[Chicago Landmark]] on November 6, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webapps.cityofchicago.org/LandmarksWeb/landmarkDetail.do?lanID=1261 |title=Alfred Caldwell Lily Pool |publisher=City of Chicago Department of Planning and Development, Landmarks Division |year=2003 |accessdate=June 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613043941/http://webapps.cityofchicago.org/LandmarksWeb/landmarkDetail.do?lanID=1261 |archivedate=June 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] and as a [[National Historic Landmark]] on February 17, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=-684823132&amp;ResourceType=District |title=Lincoln Park Lily Pool |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=May 10, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080103060222/http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=-684823132&amp;ResourceType=District |archivedate=January 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
A Victorian-style artificially heated lily pool had originally been built in 1889 at the behest of Lincoln Park Commission Superintendent John Pettigrew to cultivate tropical [[Nymphaeaceae|water lilies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagoparkdistrict.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/custom.natureOasis06|archive-url=https://archive.is/20070505143718/http://www.chicagoparkdistrict.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/custom.natureOasis06|dead-url=yes|archive-date=May 5, 2007|accessdate=May 10, 2007|year=2006|publisher=Chicago Park District|title=Lincoln Park Alfred Caldwell Lily Pool}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NRHP Registration"&gt;{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=06000235}}|title=National Historic Landmark Nomination: Lincoln Park Lily Pool |publisher=[[National Park Service]]|author=Julia Sniderman Bachrach, Patty Henry, and Carolyn Pitts |date=December 2004 |accessdate=April 20, 2017 }} With {{NRHP url|id=06000235|photos=y|title=12 photos}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The lilies proved hard to cultivate and maintain in the northern climate of Illinois and the pools became unsightly and were often considered "Pettigrew's frog ponds".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Prairie in the City: Naturalism in Chicago's Parks, 1870-1940|editor-first=Rosemary|editor-last=Adams|editor2-first=Claudia|editor2-last=Lamm Wood|last1=Sniderman|first1=Julia|chapter=Bringing the Prairie Vision into Focus|publisher=Chicago Historical Society|page=129|date=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1930s the hour-glass shaped pond and its environs had fallen into ruin and disrepair. Landscape architect [[Alfred Caldwell]] was hired by the [[Works Progress Administration]] to completely redesign this area of Lincoln Park.&lt;ref name="NRHP Registration"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Rosenthal, et al., Ark in the Park (University of Illinois, 2003) p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Caldwell realized that the Lily Pool presented him with the unique opportunity to realize his poetic symbolism and design theories and philosophies.&lt;ref name=Plan /&gt;
 
In 1938 the project was nearing completion and the park district decide to cut a major expenditure for wildflower plantings.  Caldwell cashed in his $5000 life insurance policy for $250, bought thousands of plants and transported them from Sauk County, Wisconsin, and the next day planted them all around the lily pools with the help of four others.&lt;ref name= Maloney /&gt;&lt;ref name=Garden&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grano|first1=Laurie|title=The Alfed Caldwell Lily Pool at Lincoln Park|url=http://www.gardendesign.com/visit/lily-pool-revival-the-alfred-caldwell-lily-pool-at-chicagos-lincoln-park|website=gardendesign.com|publisher=Garden Design Magazine|accessdate=May 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pool area is located just north of [[Lincoln Park Zoo]] and next to the [[Lincoln Park Conservatory]].

===Features===
[[File:20100801 Alfred Caldwell Lily Pool from southsoutheast-2 cropped.jpg|thumb|Pool in 2010]]
Caldwell had worked for landscape artist [[Jens Jensen (landscape architect)|Jens Jensen]] from 1926 to 1931. Jensen's influence on Caldwell and the Lily Pool is evident in the Sun Opening or clearing, the curving walkways and meandering, stepping-stone limestone paths, and the circular benches that Jensen referred to as "the council ring" and "friendship circles" since there was no superior position to sit in.  [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]'s influence is represented in the organic architecture of the shelter and the Fullerton Parkway Gate, a prairie-style entryway into the property.&lt;ref name=Plan /&gt;

===The Rookery ===
In the early 1950s, under Zoo Director [[Marlin Perkins]],  the pool was transformed into a water exhibit featuring exotic birds and water fowl and came to be known as The Rookery. Overgrazing by zoo birds had a devastating effect on the [[Garden pond|lily pond]]. A lack of landscaping management allowing invasive plants and "weed" trees to take over the understory, heavy human foot traffic, uncontrolled erosion, the introduction of plants materials that were invasive to the existing lilies, and inappropriate repairs (eroded areas covered with [[Rip-rap|loose stones]]) all resulted in what Caldwell called (in 1990) "a dead world".&lt;ref name=Maloney&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maloney|first1=Cathy Jean|title=Chicago Gardens:The Earliest History|date=2008|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, Illinois|isbn=9780-226-502-342|pages=464|edition=first}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=oasis&gt;{{cite web|title=Neglected Oasis to gain New Life When Zoo's Rookery is Renovated|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2000-05-11/news/0005110168_1_park-district-parking-lot-frank-lloyd-wright|website=chicagotribune.com|publisher=The Chicago Tribune|accessdate=May 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renovation===
From 1998 to 2002, the 2.7 acre Lily Pool underwent a major restoration by the [[Chicago Park District]] and the Lincoln Park Conservancy.
The Friends of Lincoln Park (now called The Lincoln Park Conservancy) raised $1.2 million toward the restoration of the lily pools. A similar sum was obtained from a grant from the [[United States Forest Service|USDA Forest Service]]. Wolff Landscape Architecture was hired to complete the project.
 
Five focus groups were conducted to develop a consensus plan for restoration of the site;&lt;ref name=Plan&gt;{{cite journal|title=Concept Plan for the Rehabilitation of the Lily Pool|journal=The Lily Pool|publisher=Friends of Lincoln Park|location=Chicago, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Beacon Supergroup''' is a geological formation exposed in Antarctica and deposited from the [[Devonian]] to the [[Triassic]] ({{Ma|400|250}}).  The unit was originally described as either a formation or sandstone, and upgraded to group and supergroup as time passed. It contains a sandy member known as the Beacon heights orthoquartzite.

The location of the formation in a cold, desert environment, and the lack of nutrients or soil (due to the purity of the sandstone) has led to the beacon sandstone being considered the closest analogue on Earth to Martian conditions, therefore many studies have been performed on life's survival there, mainly focusing on the [[lichen]] communities that form the modern inhabitants.&lt;ref name=Using2008&gt;e.g. {{cite journal

Present include:

*[[Fodinichnia]]: feeding burrows, probably of marine [[polychaete]]s, featuring evidence of rhythmic defecation.&lt;ref name=Gevers1971/&gt;
**Narrow, sinuous, near-surface forms on flat bedding surfaces
**Longer, larger forms, reaching 13&amp;nbsp;cm across and 1&amp;nbsp;m in length.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Probably produced by a very different arthropod to ''B. antarcticus''.&lt;ref name=Bradshaw2007/&gt; 
**Large (~30&amp;nbsp;cm wide) trails with a scrape mark from a central tail.  Three to four footprint pits diverge from these tracks at a high angle. The feet making the footprints had spines on their rears. These may have been formed by [[eurypterids]] but aren't a perfect match to known eurypterid trails; they may also have been formed by [[Xiphosura]]ns&lt;ref name=Gevers1971/&gt;
*''[[Diplichnites]]'' trackways - double rows of fossils - previously attributed to marine trilobites.   Clearly not - so perhaps annelids / myriapods?&lt;ref name=Woolfe1990/&gt;  Here appear on metre-scale crossbeds: sub-fluvial dunes?&lt;ref name=Woolfe1990/&gt;

The presence of crawling traces in such well sorted sands is problematic.  The arthropod trackways are thought to have been formed in shallow water, and supersaturated sand has a shallow angle of repose.  Thus either a layer of organic matter, perhaps in the form of an algal slime, must have supported the sediment,&lt;ref name=Gevers1971/&gt; or the sediment must have been partially dry.  In the context of subaerial features such as raindrop marks and desiccation cracks on associated horizons, the best explanation is that the trackways were formed on bedforms produced on a river bed, but while they were exposed by a low-flow period.&lt;ref name=Woolfe1990/&gt;

*''[[Cruziana]]'' &amp; ''[[Rusophycus]]'': thought to be formed by [[trilobite]]s, whose body fossils are only found in marine assemblages. Could they also be made by other arthropods, or could the lower parts of the Beacon sandstone have been marine? They have been found in many other non-marine instances.&lt;ref name=Woolfe1990/&gt;
*''[[Skolithos]]'' - again, traditionally thought to be marine, but there are lots of examples where it isn't.&lt;ref name=Woolfe1990/&gt;

====Ichnofacies====
{{main|ichnofacies}}

*''Scoyenia'' ichnofacies implies freshwater aquatic nature.&lt;ref name=Woolfe1990/&gt;

==Depositional environment==
Sedimentological and palæontological data point to a shallow marine [[Sedimentary depositional environment|depositional environment]].&lt;ref name=Gevers1971/&gt;

The well-sorted nature of the unit suggests that it was probably deposited close to the shoreline, in a high energy environment.&lt;ref name=Angino1962/&gt;  This is backed up by the absence of clay-sized particles, and the rounded, spherical&lt;!--Both terms ARE necessary, neither redundant!--&gt; shape of quartz grains.

Features, such as the presence of [[coal bed]]s and [[desiccation crack]]s, suggest that parts of the unit were deposited subaerially.&lt;ref name=Angino1962/&gt; [[Ripple mark]]s and [[cross bedding]] show that shallow water was also commonly present.&lt;ref name=Angino1962/&gt;

==Source rock==

* Too few minerals to come from local granites and schists, unless a long period of subaerial weathering preceded deposition.&lt;ref name=Angino1962/&gt;
* Could have been transported; would have to be a long distance to produce such a clean sandstone.&lt;ref name=Angino1962/&gt;

'''Behavioral geography''' is an approach to [[human geography]] that examines human behavior using a disaggregate approach. Behavioral geographers focus on the [[cognitive process]]es underlying [[spatial reasoning]], [[decision making]], and [[behavior]]. In addition, behavioral geography is an ideology/approach in human geography that makes use of the methods and assumptions of [[behaviorism]] to determine the [[cognitive]] processes involved in an individual's perception of or response and reaction to their environment&lt;ref&gt; Hemakumara,  GPTS.  and  Rainis,  R.  2018.  Spatial  behaviour  modelling  of unauthorised housing in Colombo, Sri Lanka. KEMANUSIAAN  the  Asian  Journal  of  Humanities25(2): 91–107, https://doi.org/10.21315/kajh2018.25.2.5

Behavioral geography is that branch of human science, which deals with the study of cognitive processes with its response to its environment, through behaviorism.

==Issues==
Because of the name it is often assumed to have its roots in [[behaviorism]]. While some behavioral geographers clearly have roots in behaviorism&lt;ref name=Norton01&gt;Norton, W. (2001). Initiating an affair human geography and [[behavior analysis]]. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 2 (4), 283–290 [http://www.baojournal.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Norton02&gt;Norton, W. (2002) Explaining Landscape Change: Group Identity and Behavior. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 3 (2), 155–160 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; due to the emphasis on cognition, most can be seen as cognitively oriented. Indeed, it seems that behaviorism interest is more recent&lt;ref name=Glass07&gt;Glass, J.E. (2007). Behavior analytic grounding of sociological [[social constructionism]]. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 8 (4), 426–433 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; and growing.&lt;ref name=Norton01/&gt; This is particularly true in the area of human landscaping.

Behavioral geography draws from early behaviorist works such as [[Edward C. Tolman|Tolman]]'s concepts of "[[cognitive map]]s". More [[Cognitive geography|cognitively oriented]], behavioral geographers focus on the cognitive processes underlying spatial reasoning, decision making, and behavior. More behaviorally oriented geographers are materialists and look at the role of basic learning processes and how they influence the landscape patterns or even group identity.&lt;ref name=Norton97&gt;Norton, W. (1997). Human geography and behavior analysis: An application of behavior analysis to the evolution of human landscapes. ''The Psychological Record'', 47, 439–460&lt;/ref&gt;

The cognitive processes include environmental perception and cognition, wayfinding, the construction of cognitive maps, place attachment, the development of attitudes about space and place, decisions and behavior based on imperfect knowledge of one's environs, and numerous other topics.

The approach adopted in behavioral geography is closely related to that of [[psychology]], but draws on research findings from a multitude of other disciplines including economics, [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], [[transportation planning]], and many others.

== The Social Construction of Nature ==
[[Nature]] is the world which surrounds us, including all life (plants, animals, organisms, humans, etc.) and physical features. [[Social constructionism|Social Construction]] is the way that human beings process the world around us in our minds. According to [[Plato|Plato's]] 'Classical Theory of Categorization', humans create categories of what they see through experience and imagination.&lt;ref name=":05"&gt;Gerber, J. (1997). Beyond Dualism — the social construction of nature and the natural ''and'' social construction of human beings. Retrieved from http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.925.2585&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Social constructionism, therefore, is this characterization that makes language and [[semantics]] possible.&lt;ref name=":05"/&gt; If these experiences and imageries are not placed into categories,  then the human ability to think about it becomes limited.&lt;ref name=":05"/&gt;

The social construction of nature looks to question different truths and understandings for how people treat nature, based on when and where someone lives. In academic circles, researchers look at how truths exist ([[ontology]]) and how truths are justified ([[epistemology]]).&lt;ref name=":05"/&gt; Construction is both a process and an outcome, where people's understandings of the word nature can be both [[literal and figurative language|literal]] and [[metaphor]]ical,&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;Demerit, D. (2002). What is the 'social construction of nature'? A typology and sympathetic critique. Retrieved from https://is.muni.cz/el/1423/podzim2010/SOC165/Demeritt_2002_-_Social_Constr_of_Nature.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; such as through giving it a human quality ([[Mother Nature]]).&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;Williams, R. (1983). Keyword: A vocabulary of culture and society. New York, NY: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be used to discredit [[science]] or philosophy.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;

As a subset of behavioral geography, the social construction of nature also includes [[environmental ethics]] and [[Value (ethics)|values]], which affect how humans treat, and interact with, the [[natural environment]]. It incorporates ideas from [[environmental science]], [[ecology]], [[sociology]], [[geography]], [[biology]], [[theology]], [[philosophy]], [[psychology]], [[politics]], [[economics]], and other disciplines, to bring together the social, cultural and environmental dimensions of life. Social constructionism uses a lot of ideas from [[Western world]] thinking, but it is also incorporates truths from other [[world view]]s, such as the [[Traditional knowledge|Traditional Knowledge]] of Aboriginal groups, or more specifically [[ecofeminism]]&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;Merchant, C.

=== The Role of Linguistics ===
[[File:Raymond_Williams_At_Saffron_Walden.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Raymond_Williams_At_Saffron_Walden.jpg|thumb|Raymond Williams, author of ''Keywords: A vocabulary of culture and society (1983)''.]]
There are many ways of understanding and interpreting nature.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; According to [[Raymond Williams]], there are three ways to give meaning to (or define) nature:
# Nature as a quality, character or process&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; (e.g. human nature)
# Nature as a force&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; (e.g. weather)
# Nature as the material world&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; (e.g. the physical environment)
According to [[Raymond Williams]], language plays a role in how we understand, interpret, and give meaning to nature.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; This is how multiple truths can be valid at the same time.&lt;ref name=":05"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

=== The Role of Mental Maps ===
Humans have the ability to create images of their environments through experiences in their mind.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Lynch, D. (1960). The Image of the City. MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; These experiences allow us to create [[Mental mapping|mental maps]] where we can create memories associated to space.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; It is a two-way process where the environment provides suggestions for what should be seen, and then the observer gives meaning with those suggestions.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

These images have three parts:
# An identity&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;
# A pattern&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;
# A [[Pragmatism|practical]] or [[emotion]]al meaning&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;
According to [[Kevin A. Lynch|Kevin Lynch]], the environmental images (or mental maps) that we make can either be weak or strong, where the process is ongoing and never stops.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== The Role of Science ===
[[Science]] occurs at many [[dimension]]s and scales that do not consider culture, but can be motivated by politics, economics and ethics.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Pedynowski, D. (2003). Science(s) - which, when and whose? Probing the metanarrative of scientific knowledge in the social construction of nature. Retrieved from http://0-eds.b.ebscohost.com.mercury.concordia.ca/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&amp;sid=15017498-bcd5-409d-b7ed-3d2141dad610%40sessionmgr101&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific knowledge consists of [[concept]]s and [[analysis]], and is a way to represent nature.&lt;ref name=":53"/&gt;

According to [[Michel Foucault]], a truth does not have to be close to reality for it to be worth something or have power.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; For [[Carolyn Merchant]], science can only be given power if a truth is interpreted as having worth.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

== Schools of Thought ==

[[Relativism]] is important in the social construction of nature, as all truths are relative to the perspective they are coming from. There are two schools of thought on how the social construction of nature is relative:
# [[Critical realism (philosophy of the social sciences)|Critical Realism]] (being realistic)&lt;ref name=":53"/&gt;
# [[Pragmatism]] (being practical)&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt;
Critical realists reject the idea of relativism and rely more on natural sciences.&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt; Pragmatists have no set opinion on the matter and rely on [[social science]] and ethics, instead.&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt;

According to [[Richard Rorty]], relativism is relevant to pragmatism in three ways:
# Every belief is equally valid&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt;
# There is no criteria for what a truth can be&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt;
# That any truth can be justified by the society it comes from&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt;
According to [[Gilbert White]], pragmatism has four main assumptions:
# That human existence is based on putting labor into the land&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt;
# That the idea of owning anything is a [[wikt:conception|conception]]&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt;
# That humans learn from their experiences&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt;
# That engagement of the publics is what allows for commitments&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt;
Richard Rorty also associated three characteristics to pragmatism:
# That all theories characterize some form of truth&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt;
# That there is not difference between what can and should be done when it comes to the truth&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt;
# That knowledge is constrained by the conversations we have&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt;
Being pragmatic is the more accepted school of thought for social construction being a relative concept.&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt;

== Historical Overview ==
[[File:Rachel_Carson_w.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Rachel_Carson_w.jpg|thumb|Rachel Carson, author of ''Silent Spring (1962)''.]]

=== Recovery Narratives ===
* '''1500s''': [[Francis Bacon]] (that human intervention in nature is needed to gain back the [[Garden of Eden]] on Earth)&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt;
* '''1600s''': [[René Descartes]] (that the world is a machine we can control)&lt;ref name=":05"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;
* '''1600s''': [[John Locke]] (that [[private property]] makes humans civilized)&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;
* '''1700s''': [[Adam Smith]] (that [[capitalism]] will bring progress)&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;
* '''Present-day:''' The [[Christian mythology|Christian narrative]] and the narrative of the [[Scientific revolution|Scientific Revolution]] have merged to become the 'Recovery Narrative of Western Culture'&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

=== Transitions in Thought ===
* '''1500s-1600s''': The belief that man is responsible for environmental problems&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Lowenthal, D. (1990). Awareness of Human Impacts: Changing Attitudes and Emphases. In B.L. Turner(Ed.), ''The earth as transformed by human action: global and regional changes in the biosphere over the past 300 years'' (pp. 121-135). Cambridge: Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1700s-1800s''': The idea that progress is attained through controlling nature&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;
* '''Mid-1800s''': The realization that humans are having unintended impacts on the environment&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;
* '''1800s-1900s''': The belief that technology has all the solutions to our problems&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;
* '''1920s-1930s''': The belief that technology is destroying nature&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;
* '''1950s-1960s''': The belief that humans risk being annihilated if they do not control technological impacts&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;
* '''1960s-1970s''': The public awakening of human impacts on the environment with the publication of [[Rachel Carson]]'s ''[[Silent Spring]]''&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;
* '''1980s''': The belief that no matter the costs, unrestricted growth is needed for progress&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;
* '''1987''': The spreading of public awareness of impacts with the publication of the [[Brundtland Commission]] Report: ''[[Our Common Future]]''&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

== How Nature becomes Socially Constructed ==
[[File:Vandana_shiva_20070610.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Vandana_shiva_20070610.jpg|thumb|Vandana Shiva, author of ''Staying Alive: Women, Culture, and Development (1988)''.]]
Nature can be socially constructed by both culturally interpreting and physically shaping the environment.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Peterson, A. (1999). Environmental Ethics and the Social Construction of Nature. Retrieved from https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/54464729/Peterson.SocialConstructionNature.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1517194179&amp;Signature=VH%2F5cQL2wkJVCJqk1%2BJZTifMdIY%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DEnvironmental_Ethics_and_the_Social_Cons.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This can happen in three ways:
# Using non-human symbols to represent nature ([[Totem]]ism)&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;
# Using non-human animals to relate to nature ([[Animism]])&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;
# Viewing nature as an '[[Other (philosophy)|Other]]' ([[Naturalism (philosophy)|Naturalism]]) &lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;
Constructions can also be categorized by giving them meaning through the process of [[embodied cognition|embodiment]],&lt;ref name=":05"/&gt; which has three components:
# The '[[Habitus (sociology)|habitus]]' (the individual)&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt;
# The practice it originates from (the culture)&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt;
# An associated [[Taxon|taxonomic group]] (i.e. [[homo sapiens]])&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt;
No matter how nature becomes socially constructed, though, the process itself is limited by three dimensions:
# The physical dimension&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt;
# The mental dimension&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt;
# The social dimension&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt;
The physical dimension is limited to the human body, where the brain is responsible for creating and selecting thoughts.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt; The mental dimension is used to understand the physical dimension and is limited to human logic.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt; The social dimension needs moral and [[social order]] and is used to give meaning to both what is physically present and what is culturally constructed.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt; All three dimensions must be present and linked to be able to socially construct nature.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt;

== Criticism on the Social Construction of Nature ==
The social construction of nature has room for improvement in four main areas:
# By giving more importance to how realities are culturally constructed through social interactions&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;
# By acknowledging that all science should be analyzed by the same standard&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;
# By gaining a better understanding of the role language plays in constructionism&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;
# By giving more importance to how truths exist and how they are justified, using [[Actor–network theory|Actor-Network Theory]]&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

[[Malta]] has a [[Mediterranean climate]] according to the [[Köppen climate classification]] (''Csa''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/mt.html#Geo |title=The World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doi.gov.mt/en/islands/location.asp]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531132411/http://www.doi.gov.mt/en/islands/location.asp |date=31 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with very mild winters and warm to hot summers. Rain occurs mainly in winter, with summer being generally dry. According to the Troll-Paffen climate classification&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.tiscali.it/linnets/Troll-Paffen.jpg |title=Tiscali Webspace |publisher=Web.tiscali.it |date= |accessdate=2015-06-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004052732/http://web.tiscali.it/linnets/Troll-Paffen.jpg |archivedate=4 October 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Siegmund/Frankenberg climate classification,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=PH Heidelberg |url=http://www.ph-heidelberg.de/geographie/forschung-und-entwicklung/klimakarte-der-erde.html |title=Klimakarte der Erde: Pädagogische Hochschule Heidelberg |publisher=Ph-heidelberg.de |date= |accessdate=2015-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malta lies within the subtropical zone, being at 35ºN latitude. 
== Temperature ==
The average yearly temperature is around {{convert|23|°C|°F|abbr=on}} during the day and {{convert|16|°C|°F|abbr=on}} at night (one of the warmest temperature averages in Europe). In the coldest month&amp;nbsp;– January&amp;nbsp;– the typical maximum temperature ranges from {{convert|12|to|18|C|F}} during the day and the minimum from {{convert|6|to|12|C|F}} at night. In the warmest month&amp;nbsp;– August&amp;nbsp;– the typical maximum temperature ranges from {{convert|28|to|34|C|F}} during the day and the minimum from {{convert|20|to|24|C|F}} at night. 
[[File:Malta International Airport3.jpg|thumb|right|A winter day in Malta: mild temperatures, sometimes cloudy or rainy, green vegetation.]] 

Generally, April starts with temperatures from {{convert|17|-|22|C|F}} during the day and {{convert|10|-|14|C|F}} at night. November has temperatures from {{convert|17|-|23|C|F}} during the day and {{convert|11|-|18|C|F}} at night. However even in the remaining four months of the year (December, January, February and March) temperatures sometimes reach {{convert|20|°C|0|abbr=on}}. Amongst all capitals in the continent of Europe, Valletta—the capital of Malta—has the warmest winters, with average temperatures of around {{convert|16|°C|°F|abbr=on}} during the day and {{convert|10|°C|°F|abbr=on}} at night in the months of January and February. In March and December average temperatures are around {{convert|17|°C|°F|abbr=on}} during the day and {{convert|11|°C|°F|abbr=on}} at night.&lt;ref name="Met Office"&gt;[http://www.maltairport.com/weather/page.asp?p=17148&amp;l=1]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100906074233/http://www.maltairport.com/weather/page.asp?p=17148&amp;l=1 |date=6 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The average number of days above {{convert|32|°C|°F|1}} is 15, most of which occur during July and August.&lt;ref name = weatherbase.com /&gt; In Malta large fluctuations in temperature are rare.
Malta is one of only a handful of locations in Europe with a USDA [[hardiness zone]] of 11a.

== Daylight ==
Malta enjoys one of the most optimal arrangement of hours of daylight in Europe. Days in winter are not as short as in the northern part of the continent, the average hours of daylight in December, January and February is 10.3 hours&lt;ref name = noaa &gt;{{cite web | url = ftp://ftp.atdd.noaa.gov/pub/GCOS/WMO-Normals/RA-VI/ML/16597.TXT | title = Climate Data for Luqa | publisher = National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration | accessdate = 15 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (for comparison: [[London]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weather2travel.com/climate-guides/united-kingdom/london.php |title=London Climate and Weather Averages, UK |publisher=Weather2travel.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Moscow]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weather2travel.com/climate-guides/russia-europe/moscow.php |title=Moscow Climate and Weather Averages, Russia (Europe) |publisher=Weather2travel.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Warsaw]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weather2travel.com/climate-guides/poland/warsaw.php |title=Warsaw Climate and Weather Averages, Poland |publisher=Weather2travel.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; - about 8 hours). The shortest day of the year - 21 December - sunrise is around 7:00 and sunset is around 17:00. The longest day of the year - 21 June - sunrise is around 5:30 and sunset is around 20:30.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weathercast.co.uk/world-weather/city-weather/poi/755X16641426/malta.html |title=City weather: The weather for Maltese Islands, Malta |publisher=Weathercast.co.uk |date=2007-01-30 |accessdate=2015-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sunshine ==
As one might expect from Malta's high daylight hours, Malta enjoys around 3,000 hours of sunshine per year (also one of the highest in Europe), from an average of above 5 hours of sunshine per day in December to an average of above 12 hours of sunshine per day in July.&lt;ref name=MaltaWeather /&gt;&lt;ref name="noaa"/&gt; Thus, Malta enjoys about twice the amount of sunshine as cities in the northern half of Europe.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} For comparison, [[London]] has 1,461 hours per year;&lt;ref name=London_climate&gt;{{cite web

== Sea temperature ==
Average annual temperature of sea is {{convert|20|°C|°F|abbr=on}} (the highest annual sea temperature in Europe), from {{convert|15|-|16|C|F}} in the period from January to April to {{convert|26|°C|°F}} in August. In the 6 months from June to November, the average sea temperature exceeds {{convert|20|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. In May and December - the transition months - the average is around {{convert|18|°C|°F|abbr=on}}.

In the second half of April, which is the beginning of the summer/holiday season the average sea temperature is {{convert|17|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. The highest sea temperature is {{convert|27|°C|°F}} in the middle-3rd week of August. In late August and early September the temperature drops to {{convert|26|°C|°F}}, and in the second half of September it drops to {{convert|25|°C|°F}}. Around mid-October it drops to {{convert|24|°C|°F}}, and during the last week of October it drops to {{convert|23|°C|°F}}. By early November the temperature drops to {{convert|22|°C|°F}} (data of 2010).&lt;ref name="Met Office"/&gt;&lt;ref name="weather2travel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weather2travel.com/climate-guides/malta/valletta.php |title=Valletta Climate Guide|publisher=Weather2travel.com |accessdate=5 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Precipitation ==
Water supply poses a problem on Malta, as the summer is both rainless and the time of greatest water use, and the winter rainfall often falls as heavy showers running off to the sea rather than soaking into the ground. Malta depends on underground reserves of fresh water, drawn through a system of water tunnels called the Ta' Kandja galleries, which average about 97&amp;nbsp;m below surface and extend like the spokes of a wheel. In the galleries in Malta's porous limestone, fresh water lies in a lens upon brine. More than half the potable water of Malta is produced by [[desalination]], which creates further issues of fossil fuel use and pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McGrath |first=Matt |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6525069.stm |title=Science/Nature &amp;#124; Briny future for vulnerable Malta |publisher=News.bbc.co.uk |date=2007-04-04 |accessdate=2015-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malta has an average of 90 precipitation days a year, and experiences from a few to a dozen rainy days per month (≥ 1&amp;nbsp;mm), ranging from 0.5 of a day in July to around 15 in December. The average annual precipitation is around 600&amp;nbsp;mm, ranging from ~0.3&amp;nbsp;mm in July to ~110&amp;nbsp;mm in December.&lt;ref name=MaltaWeather /&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=October 2013}}
Despite the relative stasis of the Maltese climate, historical records present some variations. In the capital city of Valletta, meteorological officials of the time recorded a temperature of {{convert|1.2|°C|°F|abbr=on}} on 19 February 1895, which remains a record for the city.&lt;ref name=Mifsud&gt;{{Cite book |author=Dr. Charles Mifsud| title=The Climate of the Maltese Islands |publisher=Mireva Publication |year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Regarding the island as a whole, a temperature of {{convert|-1.7|°C|°F|abbr=on}} was recorded on 1 February 1962, at Ta' Qali airfield, in the centre of the island, which was accompanied by frozen precipitation ([[hail]]), and later in the day covered by snowfall that lasted through the night, though this temperature is not recognised by the Malta Met Office as it was not an official recording station and didn't use worldwide meteorological standard instruments.&lt;ref name=Mifsud /&gt; 

Snow is a very rare phenomenon, although the island recorded several snow events since 1850, being the last one in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20141231/local/updated-snowflakes-reported-in-several-parts-of-malta-met-office.550143&lt;/ref&gt; There was a big snowfall in January 1858 (widespread snowfall), March 1877 (light snow without accumulation), February 1895 (snow squalls without accumulation), January 1905 (flurries without accumulation), March 1949 (snow recorded in the interior of the island), and 31 January 1962,&lt;ref name=Mifsud /&gt; On 31 December 2014 snow was reported at various locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20141231/local/updated-snowflakes-reported-in-several-parts-of-malta-met-office-monitoring-situation.550143 |title=Updated - 'Snowflakes' reported in several parts of Malta - Met Office 'monitoring' situation |publisher=Timesofmalta.com |date=2014-12-31 |accessdate=2015-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Graupel]] was also recorded during that day. That Winter went on to be one of the coldest and stormiest ever experienced in the Maltese Islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weather.maltairport.com/en/weather-news/news/222/last-maltese-winter-one-of-the-stormiest-in-20-years.htm |title=Last Maltese winter one of the stormiest in 20 years &amp;#124; Malta Weather - Malta Airport Met Office |publisher=Weather.maltairport.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/48139/december_brought_snow_pellets_and_record_low_temperatures |title=December brought snow pellets and record low temperatures |publisher=MaltaToday.com.mt |date=2015-01-07 |accessdate=2015-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lowest temperature ever recorded at Luqa International Airport was in January 1981, with {{Convert|1.4|°C|°F|1}}, and the highest temperature was {{Convert|43.8|°C|°F|1}}&lt;ref name=NSO&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Galdies | first1 = Charles  | url = http://www.nso.gov.mt/statdoc/document_file.aspx?id=3141 | title = The Climate of Malta: statistics, trends, and analysis 1951-2010 | pages = 6–7 | year = 2011 | publisher = National Statistics Office | accessdate = 26 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; recorded in August 1999.

'''Clock Tower Square''' has a tower with four clock faces located in [[Thimphu]], capital of [[Bhutan]]. It is a famously 
known landmark in Thimphu. There are many shops, hotels and restaurants surrounding the square.

==Location==

The clock tower square is located below ''Norzin Lam'', Thimphu above the national football stadium in the heart of the capital.

==Architecture==

[[File:Clock Tower square, Norzin Lam, Thimphu.jpg|thumb|Clock Tower square, Norzin Lam, Thimphu]]

The Clock-tower has a typical Bhutanese architectural outlook with rich Bhutanese carvings and paintings. There are traditional hand crafted dragon with golden painting on all the four faces of the tower which symbolizes the county as an independent dragon kingdom. The tower has beautiful paintings and carvings of flowers which add more magnificence to the tower. The shops, restaurants and hotels in the clock tower square have a blend of fine traditional and modern architectural Bhutanese design with multi-coloured wood frontages, small arched windows, and sloping roofs. The buildings around the square are all small three storied structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bhutan: a land in frozen time|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/country_profile/54627.stm|publisher=BBC news|accessdate=2013-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other attractions==

Water fountains and traditional Bhutanese Mani Lhalhor (prayer wheels) make the place an ideal location to catch up with [[Thimphu]]. Prayer wheels are seen almost everywhere around the country which is a Bhutanese way of life and belief that turning them brings good luck.&lt;ref name="Brown, p.98"&gt;[[Thimphu#cite note-Brown.2C p. 98-15]]&lt;/ref&gt;  The square often serves as a platform for various events and activities such as fund-raising events, movie award ceremony, trade fairs, live musical shows and many more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trade Fair|url=http://www.handicraftsbhutan.org/activities.html|publisher=Handicraft Association of Bhutan}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a small play ground opposite to the tower where kids can play.  The square has even played host to the Indo-Bhutan friendship car rally.&lt;ref&gt;BHUTAN360 . (2012, May 9).

{{As of|2018}}, [[daylight saving time]] (DST) is permanently observed in [[Morocco]], previously time was advanced to [[UTC+01:00|UTC+1]] at 02:00 on the last Sunday of March, and reverted to [[UTC±0|UTC]] ([[standard time]]), defined as [[Greenwich Mean Time]] locally, at 03:00 on the last Sunday of October. This practise was continued through October 2018, after which clocks were permanently advanced. An exception was made during the month of [[Ramadan]] during which clocks reverted to UTC (standard time).&lt;ref name="TD 20130928"&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.timeanddate.com/news/time/morocco-ends-dst-2013.html| title=Morocco extends DST to October 27, 2013| publisher=timeanddate.com| date=28 September 2013| accessdate=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maroc 20130928"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maroc.ma/fr/actualites/lhoraire-dete-gmt1-maintenu-jusquau-27-octobre-2013|title=L'horaire d'été (GMT+1) maintenu jusqu'au 27 octobre 2013|date=28 September 2013|publisher=Royaume de Maroc|language=French|accessdate=October 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''2010:''' DST began on 2 May and ended on 8 August, just before [[Ramadan]], as had been the case in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.timeanddate.com/news/time/morocco-starts-dst-2010.html |title=Morocco Starts Daylight Saving Time May 2, 2010 |publisher=Timeanddate.com |date=13 April 2010 |accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''2011:''' DST began on 2 April at midnight and ended on 31 July at midnight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.map.ma/fr/sections/accueil/l_heure_legale_au_ma/view |title=L'heure légale au Maroc sera avancée de 60 mn à partir de dimanche prochain |publisher=Map.ma |date= |accessdate=2011-03-31}}{{Dead link|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''2012:''' On Thursday, 8 March 2012, the Moroccan Cabinet approved a bill for the permanent adoption of DST with predictable start and finish dates. However, before the start of DST, they changed it to advance to UTC+1 at 02:00 on the last Sunday of April, and return to UTC at 03:00 on the last Sunday of September, with the exception of the holy month of Ramadan, during which DST will not be observed.&lt;ref name=Ramadan2012&gt;{{cite web|title=Retour à l’heure légale du Royaume (GMT)|url=http://www.mmsp.gov.ma/fr/actualites.aspx?id=288|publisher=The Kingdom of Morocco, Ministry of Public Functions and Administration Modernisation|accessdate=2012-07-17|pages=1|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.maroc.ma/PortailInst/Fr/evenements/Le+Conseil+de+gouvernement.htm&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the time changes in 2012 were:

:* 20 August&amp;nbsp;– advance to UTC+1 (end of Ramadan)

* '''2013:''' DST followed the 2012 law at first:

:* 28 April&amp;nbsp;– advance to UTC+1 (DST)
:* 7 July&amp;nbsp;– return to UTC (start of Ramadan)
:* 10 August&amp;nbsp;– advance to UTC+1 (end of Ramadan)

However, on Saturday, 28 September, the government announced a change in policy, which moved the end of DST from the last Sunday in September (which was to be the next day) to the last Sunday in October (27 October). At the same time, they moved the beginning of DST back to the last Sunday in March (next 30 March 2014). As usual, advancements to DST (UTC+1) occurred at 02:00 and returns to standard time (UTC) occurred at 03:00.&lt;ref name="TD 20130928"/&gt;

Located in the South Pacific (south of French [[Tuamotus|Tuamotu Islands]] and east of [[New Zealand]]), the '''Ernest Legouve Reef''' was reported in 1902 by the unnamed captain of the French ship ''Ernest‑Legouvé''. The reef was about 100 metres long and another reef was sighted near it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=United States Hydrographic Office |title=Pacific Islands Pilot, v. 2 |publisher=Government Printing Office |location=Washington, D.C. |year=1916 |isbn= |page=56 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IHUwAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA56 |accessdate=2011-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reef was recorded in ''Paris Notice to Mariners'' 164/1122/1902, and the [[International Hydrographic Bureau]] stated it on February 9, 1957 giving an estimated position of {{coord|35|12|S|150|40|W|}}. It was searched for in 1982 and 1983 but not found, leading to it being considered a [[phantom island]]. Nevertheless, it is marked in the 2015 edition of the ''National Geographic Atlas of the World''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=National Geographic Atlas of the World |edition=10th |year=2015 |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=National Geographic |page=plate 109 |isbn=1-4262-1354-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other nearby historically reported reefs which appear to not exist include [[Wachusett Reef]], [[Jupiter Reef]] and [[Maria Theresa Reef]].

In its location and description, the Ernest Legouve Reef corresponds to the rock that was said to be all that was left of [[The Mysterious Island|Lincoln Island]] at the end of [[Jules Verne]]'s ''[[The Mysterious Island]]''.

'''Ferdinandea''' is an area of 3600 hectare in [[Serre Calabresi]] ([[Calabria]], southern [[Italy]]) included in the territories of [[Bivongi]], [[Stilo]], [[Brognaturo]], [[Mongiana]] and [[Serra San Bruno]] in the [[province of Reggio Calabria|provinces of Reggio Calabria]] and [[province of Vibo Valentia|Vibo Valentia]].

Ferdinandea is entirely covered by fir and beech woods.

The name originates from King [[Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies]], who used the area for hunting after 1832. He later turned it into a metal industry center, building here a foundry,  [[ironworks]], residential and administrative buildings and stables.

== Industrial archeology ==
The area is part of [[Ecomuseo delle ferriere e fonderie di Calabria]], a museum devoted to the research and restoration of [[industrial archaeology]] of the area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.terredelmediterraneo.org/itinerari/serre.htm Le Serre Calabresi&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[New Zealand]] (''{{lang|mi|[[Aotearoa]]}}'') is an [[island country]] located in the south-western [[Pacific Ocean]], near the centre of the [[water hemisphere]]. It is a long and narrow country and comprises [[List of islands of New Zealand|around 600 islands]]. The two main islands by size are the [[North Island]] (or ''Te Ika-a-Māui'') and the [[South Island]] (or ''Te Waipounamu''), separated by the [[Cook Strait]]; the third-largest island, [[Stewart Island]] (or ''Rakiura''), is located {{convert|30|km}} off the tip of the South Island across [[Foveaux Strait]]. Significantly smaller islands include [[Waiheke Island]], [[Chatham Island]], [[Great Barrier Island]] and more, although many are uninhabited.

New Zealand's landscape ranges from the [[fiord]]-like [[sound (geography)|sounds]] of the southwest to the sandy beaches of the far north. The South Island is dominated by the [[Southern Alps]] while a [[North Island Volcanic Plateau|volcanic plateau]] covers much of the central North Island. Temperatures rarely fall below 0&amp;nbsp;°C or rise above 30&amp;nbsp;°C and conditions vary from wet and cold on the South Island's [[West Coast, New Zealand|West Coast]] to dry and continental a short distance away across the mountains and near [[subtropical]] in the northern reaches of the North Island.

New Zealand's varied landscape has appeared in [[television show]]s, such as ''[[Xena: Warrior Princess]]''. An increasing number of feature films have also been filmed there, including the [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''Lord of the Rings'' trilogy]].

The country is situated about {{convert|2000|km}} southeast of [[Australia]] across the [[Tasman Sea]], its closest neighbours to the north being [[New Caledonia]], [[Tonga]] and [[Fiji]]. It is the southernmost nation in [[Oceania]]. The relative proximity of New Zealand north of [[Antarctica]] has made the South Island a gateway for scientific expeditions to the continent.

The [[South Island]] is the largest land mass of New Zealand, and is the [[List of islands by area|12th-largest island]] in the world. The island is divided along its length by the [[Southern Alps]]. The east side of the island has the [[Canterbury Plains]] while the [[West Coast, New Zealand|West Coast]] is famous for its rough coastlines, high rainfall, very high proportion of native [[forest|bush]], and [[glacier]]s.&lt;ref name="McSaveney"&gt;{{cite web |last1=McSaveney |first1=Eileen |title=Landscapes – overview |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/landscapes-overview |publisher=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand |accessdate=11 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Forty-Fours or Motuhara Islands.jpg|thumb|The Forty-Fours viewed from the north; the leftmost islet is the easternmost point of New Zealand.]]

The phrase "From Cape Reinga to The Bluff" is frequently used within New Zealand to refer to the extent of the whole country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bb2Q2uO-FbEC&amp;pg=PA59|title=A Land of Two Halves|last1=Bennett|first1=Joe|date=2005|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=9780743263573|page=59|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cape Reinga]] is northwesternmost tip of the [[Aupouri Peninsula]], at the northern end of the North Island. [[Bluff, New Zealand|Bluff]] is [[Invercargill]]'s port, located near the southern tip of the South Island, below the [[46th parallel south]]. However, the extreme points of New Zealand are actually located in several [[New Zealand outlying islands|outlying islands]].&lt;ref name="extreme points"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/the-extreme-points-of-new-zealand.html|title=The Extreme Points Of New Zealand|date=29 March 2018|accessdate=11 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The points that are farther north, south, east or west than any other location in New Zealand are as follows:&lt;ref name="extreme points" /&gt;

*The northernmost point is in [[Nugent Island]] in the [[Kermadec Islands]] ({{coord|-29.231667|-177.869167}}).
*The southernmost point is [[Jacquemart Island]] in the [[Campbell Island group]] ({{coord|-52.619444|169.125833}}).
*The easternmost point is situated in a group of islands within the Chatham Islands called the [[Forty-Fours]] ({{coord|-43.963306|-175.831410}}).

Parts of the [[Northland Peninsula]] oppose [[Morocco]], with [[Whangarei]] nearly coincident with [[Tangiers]]. The antipodes of the Chatham Islands lie in [[France]], just north of the city of [[Montpellier]].&lt;ref name="antipodes" /&gt; The [[Antipodes Islands]] were named for their supposed antipodal position to Britain; although they are the closest land to the true antipodes of Britain, their location 49°41′S 178°48′E is directly antipodal to a point a few kilometres to the east of [[Cherbourg]] on the north coast of France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.howderfamily.com/blog/antipodes-islands/|title=Antipodes Islands|work=Twelve Mile Circle|accessdate=6 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Zealandia-Continent map en.svg|thumb|left|Topography of [[Zealandia (continent)|Zealandia]], the submerged continent, and the two tectonic plates]]

New Zealand is part of [[Zealandia]], a [[microcontinent]] nearly half the size of Australia that gradually submerged after breaking away from the [[Gondwana]]n supercontinent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Wallis|first1=G. P.|last2=Trewick|first2=S.

It also extends towards [[Australia (continent)|Australia]] in the north-west. This submerged continent is dotted with topographic highs that sometimes form islands. Some of these, such as the main islands (North and South), Stewart Island, New Caledonia, and the Chatham Islands, are settled. Other smaller islands are eco-sanctuaries with carefully controlled access.

[[File:Lake taupo landsat.jpg|thumb|right|The scalloped bays indenting Lake Taupo's northern and western coasts are typical of large volcanic [[caldera]] margins. The caldera they surround was formed during the huge [[Oruanui eruption]].]]
The New Zealand landmass has been uplifted due to transpressional [[plate tectonics|tectonics]] between the [[Indo-Australian Plate]] and [[Pacific Plate|Pacific]] plates (these two plates are grinding together with one riding up and over the other).&lt;ref name="Keith 2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.TeAra.govt.nz/en/sea-floor-geology/2|title=Sea floor geology – Active plate boundaries|last1=Lewis|first1=Keith|last2=Nodder|first2=Scott|date=March 2009|publisher=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=14 August 2017|last3=Carter|first3=Lionel}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the cause of New Zealand's numerous earthquakes and volcanoes.

To the east of the North Island the Pacific Plate is forced under the Indo-Australian Plate. The North Island of New Zealand has widespread back-arc volcanism as a result of this [[subduction]]. There are many large volcanoes with relatively frequent eruptions. There are also several very large [[calderas]], with the most obvious forming [[Lake Taupo]]. Taupo has a history of incredibly powerful eruptions, with the [[Oruanui eruption]] approx. 26,500 years ago ejecting {{convert|1170|km3}} of material and causing the downward collapse of several hundred square kilometers to form the lake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nzgeo.com/stories/the-power-of-taupo/|title=The Power of Taupo|website=www.nzgeo.com|publisher=New Zealand Geographic|language=en-NZ|accessdate=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hatepe eruption|last eruption]] occurred {{circa|180 CE}} and ejected at least 100 cubic kilometers of material, and has been correlated with red skies seen at the time in [[Roman Empire|Rome]] and [[Han dynasty|China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilson|first=C.

The subduction direction is reversed through the South Island, with the Indo-Australian Plate forced under the Pacific Plate. The transition between these two different styles of continental collision occurs through the top of the South Island. This area has significant uplift and many [[active fault]]s; large earthquakes are frequent occurrences here. The most powerful in recent history, the M8.3 [[1855 Wairarapa earthquake|Wairarapa earthquake]], occurred in 1855. This earthquake generated more than {{convert|6|m}} of vertical uplift in places, and caused a localised tsunami. Fortunately casualties were low due to the sparse settlement of the region. In 2013, the area was rattled by the M6.5 [[Seddon earthquake]], but this caused little damage and no injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geonet.org.nz/earthquake/2013p543824|title=M 6.5 Cook Strait Sun, Jul 21 2013|publisher=GeoNet|language=en|accessdate=15 August 2017|quote=A magnitude 6.5 earthquake occurred 20 km east of Seddon, New Zealand on Sun Jul 21 2013 5:09 PM}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand's capital city, [[Wellington]], is situated in the centre of this region.

The subduction of the Indo-Australian Plate drives rapid uplift in the centre of the South Island (approx. {{convert|10|mm}} per year). This uplift forms the Southern Alps. These roughly divide the island, with a narrow wet strip to the west and wide and dry plains to the east. The resulting [[orographic]] rainfall enables the hydroelectric generation of most of the country's electricity.&lt;ref name="Meduna" /&gt; A significant amount of the movement between the two plates is accommodated by lateral sliding of the Indo-Australian Plate north relative to the Pacific Plate. The plate boundary forms the nearly {{convert|800|km}} long [[Alpine Fault]]. This fault has an estimated rupture reoccurrence interval of ~330 years, and last ruptured in 1717 along {{convert|400|km}} of its length. It passes directly under many settlements on the West Coast of the South Island and shaking from a rupture would likely affect many cities and towns throughout the country.

The rapid uplift and high erosion rates within the Southern Alps combine to expose high grade [[greenschist]] to [[amphibolite]] [[facies]] rocks, including the gemstone [[pounamu]] ([[jade]]). Geologists visiting the West Coast can easily access high-grade [[metamorphic rock]]s and [[mylonite]]s associated with the Alpine Fault, and in certain places can stand astride the fault trace of an active plate boundary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://academic.oup.com/petrology/article-abstract/13/3/457/1591862/Progressive-Metamorphism-of-Metabasic-Rocks-from?redirectedFrom=PDF|title=Progressive Metamorphism of Metabasic Rocks from the Haast Schist Group of Southern New Zealand|last1=COOPER|first1=A.

To the south of New Zealand the Indo-Australian Plate is subducting under the Pacific Plate, and this is beginning to result in [[back-arc basin|back-arc]] volcanism. The youngest (geologically speaking) volcanism in the South Island occurred in this region, forming the [[Solander Islands]] (&lt;2 million years old).&lt;ref name="HarringtonWood1958"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harrington|first1=H.

===Mountain, volcanoes and glaciers===
{{See also|List of mountains of New Zealand by height|List of volcanoes in New Zealand}}

The South Island is much more mountainous than the North, but shows fewer manifestations of recent volcanic activity. There are 18 peaks of more than {{convert|3000|m|ft|abbr=off}} in the Southern Alps, which stretch for {{convert|500|km}} down the South Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kisch|first1=Conrad|title=Destination.

The [[North Island Volcanic Plateau]] covers much of central North Island with volcanoes, [[lava plateau]]s, and [[crater lake]]s. The three highest volcanoes are [[Mount Ruapehu]] ({{convert|2,797|m}}), [[Mount Taranaki]] ({{convert|2,518|m}}) and [[Mount Ngauruhoe]] ({{convert|2,287|m}}).

===Caves===
{{main article|Caving in New Zealand|List of caves in New Zealand}}

New Zealand's cave systems have three main origins, the chemical weathering of limestone by water ([[karst]]), [[Lava cave|lava caves]] and erosion by waves ([[Sea cave|sea caves]]). Therefore the distribution of limestone, marble ([[Metamorphic rock|metamorphosed]] limestone) and volcanoes defines the location of caves in inland New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=DwOqDQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Geomorphology+of+New+Zealand&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiT7Y3k8vfeAhUBEnIKHbzQDooQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Geomorphology%20of%20New%20Zealand&amp;f=false|title=New Zealand Landscape: Behind the Scene|last=Williams|first=Paul|date=2017-05-18|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780128125656|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main regions of karst topography are the [[Waitomo District]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newzealand.com/au/waitomo-caves/|title=Things to see and do in Waitomo Caves, New Zealand|website=www.newzealand.com|publisher=Tourism New Zealand|language=en|accessdate=16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Takaka Hill]] in the [[Tasman District|Tasman district]]. Other notable locations are on the [[West Coast, New Zealand|West Coast]] ([[Punakaiki]]), the [[Hawke's Bay Region|Hawkes Bay]] and [[Fiordland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.realjourneys.co.nz/en/experiences/glowworm-caves/te-anau-glowworm-caves/|title=Te Anau Glowworm Caves: Explore Te Anau's unique glowworm caves|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Lava caves ([[lava tubes]]) usually form in [[pahoehoe]] lava flows, which are less viscus and typical formed from [[basalt]]. When an eruption occurs the outer layer of the lava flow hardens, while the interior remain liquid. The liquid lava flows out as it is insulated by the hardened crust above. These caves are found where there are relatively recent basaltic volcanoes in New Zealand, such as the [[Auckland volcanic field|Auckland Volcanic Field]] particularly on [[Rangitoto Island|Rangitoto]], [[Mount Eden|Mt Eden]] and [[Matukutururu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nzgeo.com/stories/secret-passages/|title=The lava caves hidden beneath suburban Auckland|work=New Zealand Geographic|access-date=2018-12-01|language=en-NZ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The distribution of sea caves is more sporadic, with their location and orientation being controlled by weakness in the underlying rock. As cave systems take many thousands of years to develop they can now be isolated from the water that formed them, whether through change in sea level or groundwater flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=XrtVlwEACAAJ&amp;dq=west+coast+walking&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiy8q-_9_feAhURWCsKHUtLCEAQ6AEIKjAA|title=West Coast Walking: A Naturalist's Guide|last=Wilson|first=Kerry-Jayne|date=2013|publisher=Canterbury University Press|year=|isbn=9781927145425|location=|pages=137|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; If as a cave grows it breaks through to the surface somewhere else it becomes a [[natural arch]], like those near [[Karamea]] ([[Oparara Basin Arches|Oparara Arches]]).

===Rivers and lakes===
{{main article|Rivers of New Zealand|Lakes of New Zealand}}

The proportion of New Zealand's area (excluding [[estuaries]]) covered by rivers, lakes and ponds, based on figures from the New Zealand Land Cover Database,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Historical environmental reporting|url=http://www.mfe.govt.nz/more/environmental-reporting/reporting-act/about-reporting-act|publisher=Ministry for the Environment of New Zealand|accessdate=21 November 2016|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; is (357526 + 81936) / (26821559 – 92499–26033 – 19216) = 1.6%. If estuarine open water, mangroves, and [[Herbaceous plant|herbaceous]] saline vegetation are included, the figure is 2.2%.

[[File:Lake Taupo and Waikato River aerial view.jpg|thumb|The Waikato River flowing out of Lake Taupo]]
The mountainous areas of the North Island are cut by many rivers, many of which are swift and unnavigable. The east of the South Island is marked by wide, [[braided river]]s such as the [[Wairau River|Wairau]], [[Waimakariri River|Waimakariri]] and [[Rangitata River|Rangitātā]]; formed from glaciers, they fan out into many strands on gravel plains. The [[Waikato River|Waikato]], flowing through the North Island, is the New Zealand's longest river, with a length of {{convert|425|km}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Young|first1=David|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/rivers|title=Rivers|publisher=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=16 August 2017|date=24 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand's rivers feature [[List of waterfalls of New Zealand|hundreds of waterfalls]]; the most visited set of waterfalls are the [[Huka Falls]] that drain [[Lake Taupo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/waterfalls |last1=Phillips |first1=Jock |title=Waterfalls |publisher=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand |accessdate=11 June 2018 |date=24 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lake Taupo, located near the centre of the North Island, is the largest lake by surface area in the country.

===Climate===
{{main article|Climate of New Zealand|Climate change in New Zealand}}
[[File:New Zealand snow.jpg|thumb|left|Central Plateau in winter]]
The main factors that influence New Zealand's climate are the temperate [[latitude]], with [[prevailing winds|prevailing westerly winds]]; the [[ocean]]ic environment; and the mountains, especially the Southern Alps. The climate is mostly temperate with mean temperatures ranging from {{convert|8|°C|°F|abbr=on}} in the South Island to {{convert|16|°C|°F|abbr=on}} in the North Island.&lt;ref&gt;From NIWA Science [http://www.niwascience.co.nz/edu/resources/climate/overview/ climate overview].&lt;/ref&gt; January and February are the warmest months, July the coldest. New Zealand does not have a large temperature range, apart from central Otago, but the weather can change rapidly and unexpectedly. Near [[subtropical]] conditions are experienced in [[Northland Peninsula|Northland]].

Most settled, lowland areas of the country have between 600 and 1600&amp;nbsp;mm of [[precipitation (meteorology)|rainfall]], with the most rain along the west coast of the South Island and the least on the east coast of the South Island and interior basins, predominantly on the [[Canterbury Plains]] and the Central Otago Basin (about 350&amp;nbsp;mm {{abbreviation|PA|per annum; annually}}). [[Christchurch]] is the driest city, receiving about {{convert|640|mm|in|abbr=on}} of rain per year, while [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]] is the wettest, receiving more than twice that amount at 1325&amp;nbsp;mm PA, followed closely by Auckland. The wettest area by far is the rugged Fiordland region, in the south-west of the South Island, which has between 5000 and 8000&amp;nbsp;mm of rain per year, with up to 15,000&amp;nbsp;mm in isolated valleys, amongst the highest recorded rainfalls in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.niwa.co.nz/__data/assets/file/0006/44268/rain.xls|title=Mean monthly rainfall|publisher=National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research|format=XLS|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110503221956/http://www.niwa.co.nz/__data/assets/file/0006/44268/rain.xls|archivedate=3 May 2011|accessdate=4 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[UV index]] can be very high and extreme in the hottest times of the year in the north of the North Island. This is partly due to the country's relatively little [[air pollution]] compared to many other countries and the high sunshine hours.
New Zealand has very high sunshine hours with most areas receiving over 2000 hours per year. The sunniest areas are Nelson/Marlborough and the Bay of Plenty with 2400 hours per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.niwascience.co.nz/__data/assets/file/0006/44655/sunshine.xls|title=Mean monthly sunshine hours|publisher=National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research|format=XLS|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015102420/http://www.niwascience.co.nz/__data/assets/file/0006/44655/sunshine.xls|archivedate=15 October 2008|accessdate=16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political geography===
New Zealand has no land [[border]]s.&lt;ref name="World Factbook"/&gt; However, the [[Ross Dependency]], its claim in Antarctica, nominally borders the [[Australian Antarctic Territory]] to the west and [[Marie Byrd Land|unclaimed territory]] to the east. Most other countries do not recognise [[territorial claims in Antarctica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Who owns Antarctica? |url=http://www.antarctica.gov.au/about-antarctica/people-in-antarctica/who-owns-antarctica |publisher=Australian [[Department of the Environment and Energy]] |accessdate=10 October 2018 |date=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Zealand [[wikt:proper|proper]] is subdivided into [[regions of New Zealand|sixteen regions]]: seven in the South Island and nine in the North.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Zealand – A regional profile|url=http://www.stats.govt.nz/browse_for_stats/population/migration/nz-a-regional-profile.aspx|publisher=Statistics New Zealand|accessdate=15 August 2017|language=en-nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have a geographical link with regional boundaries being based largely on [[drainage basin]]s.&lt;ref name="OECD"&gt;{{cite book|title=OECD Territorial Reviews OECD Territorial Reviews: The Metropolitan Region of Rotterdam-The Hague, Netherlands|date=2016|publisher=OECD Publishing|isbn=9789264249387|page=169|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PkR_CwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA169|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the regions, eleven are administered by regional authorities (top tier of [[local government in New Zealand|local government]]), while five are [[unitary authorities]] that combine the functions of regional authorities and those of [[territorial authorities]] (second tier).

New Zealand's peoples have been defined by their immigrant origin, the on going process of adaptation to a new land, being changed and changing those who came before. This process has lead to a distinct distribution of culture across New Zealand. Here language and religion are used as markers for the far richer concept of culture. These metrics  unfortunately exclude the political rural-urban divide&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/97283075/election-shows-ruralurban-divide-shrinking-not-growing.html|title=Election shows rural-urban divide shrinking, not growing|website=Stuff|language=en|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also the full effects of the Christchurch earthquakes on New Zealand's cultural distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/7783450/10-600-people-leave-Christchurch|title=10,600 people leave Christchurch|website=Stuff|language=en|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=Nfu9CwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=christchurch+ruptures&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjD-IH_6ffeAhUQTn0KHXHCCIgQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=christchurch%20ruptures&amp;f=false|title=Christchurch Ruptures|last=Pickles|first=Katie|date=2016-03-15|publisher=Bridget Williams Books|isbn=9780908321308|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

New Zealand's language varies spatially both within and between ethnic groups. There are many sub dialects of the [[Māori language]]—the most pronounced division being between the northern and southern tribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.radionz.co.nz/news/te-manu-korihi/250479/warning-minority-dialects-could-be-lost|title=Warning minority dialects could be lost|date=2014-07-24|work=Radio New Zealand|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; While migration (typically from north to south) was constant throughout the 16–18th centuries, the south maintained a distinct culture largely due to lack of  cultivation possible at that latitude. Māori is still spoken more commonly (3.5 percent of the New Zealand population&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/nz.html|title=Australia - Oceania :: New Zealand — The World Factbook - Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in areas with large Māori populations ([[Gisborne District|Gisborne]], [[Bay of Plenty]] and [[Northland Peninsula|Northland]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://socialreport.msd.govt.nz/cultural-identity/maori-language-speakers.html#regional-differences|title=Māori language speakers: The Social Report 2016 – Te pūrongo oranga tangata|website=socialreport.msd.govt.nz|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; English, the dominant language of New Zealand (89.8 percent), is spoken with regional [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accents]] relating to the origin of immigrants; for example Scottish and English 19th century immigration in [[Southland, New Zealand|Southland]] and [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.canterbury.ac.nz/insiders/2016/11/10/what-is-the-southland-accent/|title=What is the Southland accent? - The Insider's Guide to UC {{!}} Tūpono|date=2016-11-09|work=The Insider's Guide to UC {{!}} Tūpono|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/1966/new-zealand-speech/page-11|title=THE SOUTHLAND DIALECT|last=Hare|first=McLintock, Alexander|access-date=2018-11-28|last2=Wellington.|first2=Arnold Wall, C.B.E., B.A.(CAMB.), M.A.(LOND.), D.LITT(N.Z.), F.R.S.TAS.

=== Agricultural geography ===
{{See also|Agriculture in New Zealand}}

A relatively small proportion of New Zealand's land is [[arable land|arable]] (1.76%), and permanent crops cover 0.27% of the land. {{convert|7,210|km2}} of the land is [[irrigation|irrigated]].&lt;ref name="World Factbook"&gt;{{cite web|title=The World Factbook|date=2015|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]|isbn=9780160925535|page=537–542|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1-4ZxpxT3GAC&amp;pg=PA540|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the world's largest exporter of sheep, New Zealand's agricultural industry focuses primarily on [[pastoral farming]], particularly dairy and beef, as well as lambs. Dairy, specifically, is their top export. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newzealandnow.govt.nz/resources/working-in-dairy-farming|title=Working in Dairy Farming {{!}} Guide for Migrants {{!}} New Zealand Now|website=www.newzealandnow.govt.nz|language=en|access-date=2018-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to pastoral farming, fisherman harvest mussels, oysters and salmon, and horticulture farmers grow [[kiwifruit]], as well as peaches, nectarines, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newzealand.com/sg/article/not-just-sheep-all-about-farming-in-new-zealand/|title=Not just sheep!

As of 2007, almost 55 percent of New Zealand's total land area was being used for farming, which is standard compared to most developed countries. Three-fourths of it was pastoral land using for raising sheep, beef, deer, etc. The amount of farmland has decreased since 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.stats.govt.nz/browse_for_stats/snapshots-of-nz/Measuring-NZ-progress-sustainable-dev-%20approach/sustainable-development/land-use.aspx|title=Measuring New Zealand’s Progress Using a Sustainable Development Approach: 2008|website=archive.stats.govt.nz|language=en-nz|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Zealand's isolated location has simultaneously lead to fewer [[Pest (organism)|pests]] and an agriculture industry with a greater susceptibility to introduced diseases and pests.&lt;ref name="GoldsonBourdôt2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goldson|first1=SL|last2=Bourdôt|first2=GW|last3=Brockerhoff|first3=EG|last4=Byrom|first4=AE|last5=Clout|first5=MN|last6=McGlone|first6=MS|last7=Nelson|first7=WA|last8=Popay|first8=AJ|last9=Suckling|first9=DM|last10=Templeton|first10=MD|title=New Zealand pest management: current and future challenges|journal=Journal of the Royal Society of New Zealand|volume=45|issue=1|year=2015|pages=31–58|issn=0303-6758|doi=10.1080/03036758.2014.100034}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major concern for New Zealand farmers is the rapidly growing wild rabbit population. Wild rabbits have been an agricultural issue for a while, since their introduction to the country in the 1930s. They cause significant damage to farm lands: eating the grass, crops, and causing soil degradation. Many farmers are worried about their livelihoods and the effects that the rabbits will have on food supply and trade, as their numbers are quickly growing out of control. An illegal rabbit-killing virus called the [[rabbit haemorrhagic disease]] virus (RHDV) was released in 1997 by a group of vigilante farmers, and was very effective initially.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/environment/101797178/hopes-nationwide-release-of-k5-rabbit-virus-will-kill-more-than-40-of-the-population.html|title=Hopes nationwide release of K5 rabbit virus will kill more than 40% of the population|website=Stuff|language=en|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; After twenty years, however, the rabbits became immune to it. To help desperate farmers, a new strain of the virus was released in March 2018, a Korean form of the strain called the K5 virus, or RHDV1-K5. This virus was introduced with the goal of exterminating 40 percent of the rabbit population. The new virus works much faster than the last one, expected to kill rabbits within two to four days of exposure. The virus has become a subject of debate among animal rights activists, due to the inhumane manner in which it kills the rabbits. However, farmers unanimously seem to be very grateful for the release of the virus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-43221704|title=Why NZ is releasing a rabbit-killing virus|date=2018-02-28|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-11-13|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:New Zealand - Landscape - 8674.jpg|thumb|Rural landscape close to Mt Ruapehu]]

Almost half of New Zealand's climate change emissions are generated by greenhouse gases, mainly methane and nitrous oxide, which come from farming and agriculture. Organisms that grow inside of grazing animals' stomachs turn New Zealand's grass into methane. The increase of carbon dioxide in the air helps the plants to grow faster, but the long-term effects of climate change threaten farmers with the likelihood of more frequent and severe floods and droughts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/the-country/news/article.cfm?c_id=16&amp;objectid=11751990|title=Farmers react to climate change|last=Stowell|first=Laurel|work=NZ Herald|access-date=2018-11-13|language=en-NZ|issn=1170-0777}}&lt;/ref&gt; Growers of kiwifruit, a major export in the horticulture industry of New Zealand, have experienced difficulties as a result of climate change. The recent warm winters are not providing the adequate cool temperatures needed for the flowering of kiwifruit, and has resulted in a reduction of the yield sizes. The recent droughts are also decreasing apple production by causing sunburns and a lack of water available for irrigation. In contrast, the [[Dairy farming in New Zealand|dairy industry]] has not been affected, and has actually adjusted well to the effects of climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kenny|first=Gavin|date=September 2001|title=Climate Change: Likely Impacts on New Zealand Agriculture|url=https://www.mfe.govt.nz/sites/default/files/impacts-agriculture-sep01.pdf|journal=Ministry for the Environment|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural hazards==
Flooding is the most regular natural hazard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McSaveney|first1=Eileen|title=Floods – New Zealand’s number one hazard|url=https://www.teara.govt.nz/en/floods/page-1|publisher=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=16 August 2017|date=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Few regions have escaped winter floods. Settlements are usually close to hill-country areas which experience much higher rainfall than the lowlands due to the [[Orographic precipitation|orographic]] effect. Mountain streams which feed the major rivers rise rapidly and frequently break their banks covering farms with water and silt. Close monitoring, excellent weather forecasting, stopbanks, multiple hydropower dams, river dredging and reafforestation programmes in hill country have ameliorated the worst effects.

Is a 17th century manor or mansion, located in Moscow. Princess [[Olga Gorchakov]] resided in the estate in 1852.
In the late 19th century, it was the home of Vasily Dashkov, a philanthropist, a collector of art,
the director of Rumyantsev Museum since 1868, and the Vice - President of the Commission for the construction of
the Cathedral of Christ the Savior. The house was registered to the name of his wife, Elizaveta Dashkova,

The '''Governorate of Chiloé''' was political and military subdivision of the [[Spanish Empire]] that existed, with a [[Intendancy of Chiloé|1784–1789 interregnum]], from the 1600s to 1826. The Governorate of Chiloé depended on the [[Captaincy General of Chile]] until the late 18th century when it was made depend directly on the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]]. The administrative change was done simultaneously as the capital of the archipelago was moved from [[Castro, Chile|Castro]] to [[Ancud]] in 1768. The last Royal Governor of Chiloé, [[Antonio de Quintanilla]], depended directly on the central government in [[Madrid]].&lt;ref name=Notasurbina/&gt;

==Extent==
The Governorate of Chiloé had its ''[[de jure]]'' northern limit a [[Bueno River]] in continental Chile. There the governorate limited with the territories of [[Valdivia]]. The area ''[[de facto]]'' controlled included the Chiloé Archipelago, the seashore forts and settlements north of [[Chacao Channel]] plus the [[Mission of Nahuel Huapi]] which was nevertheless financed from Valdivia.&lt;ref name=Notasurbina/&gt;&lt;ref name=Urbina&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Urbina |first1=Ximena |last2= |first2= |year=2008 |title=The frustrated strategic mission of Nahuelhuapi, a point in Patagonia's inmensity |journal=[[Magallania]] |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=5–30 |publisher= |doi= |url=http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0718-22442008000100001&amp;lng=es&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=es |accessdate=26 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Gabriel Guarda]] do however disagree claiming the Mission of Nahuel Huapi was within the jurisdiction of [[Valdivia]].&lt;ref name=Urbina/&gt; The so-called ''juncos of Osorno'' ([[Huilliche]]s) attempted in the late 18th century to have their lands, that lied just south of Bueno River, to be removed from the Governorate of Chiloé and incorporated to Valdivia. The reason of this was their bad relation and history of warfare with the settlements of around Chacao Channel.&lt;ref name=Notasurbina/&gt;

==Royal governors==
All 17th century Royal Governors were named by the [[Royal Governor of Chile]]. In the 18th century this system changed and while still named by the Royal Governor of Chile the position were to be ratified by the [[King of Spain]]. Later in the 18th century the [[Viceroy of Peru]] took over the duties of naming governors but still with the need of ratification by the King of Spain.&lt;ref name=Notasurbina/&gt; Formally the office was granted based on merits during all of the 17th century. However, in the early 18th century "pecuniary service" begun also to be considered, which meant in practice that the office could be purchased. This practice was abolished in 1750.&lt;ref name=Notasurbina/&gt; The office of Governor of Chiloé was commonly used to booster a carrier and then access more desirable positions of power in [[Central Chile]].&lt;ref name="UrbinaRebellion1990"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Urbina |first=Rodolfo |year=1990 |title=La rebelión indígena de 1712: los tributarios de Chiloé contra la encomienda |url=http://www.memoriachilena.cl/archivos2/pdfs/MC0008625.pdf |journal=Tiempo y espacio |volume= |issue=1 |pages=73–86 |location=Chillán |publisher=El Departamento |language=Spanish |format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The position of Royal Governor of Chiloé dates to the early 17th century. Before that a succession of [[corregidor]]es existed including [[Alonso Benítez]] and [[Alonso de Góngora Marmolejo]]. Antonio Mejía who was sent by [[Alonso de Ribera]] to rule Chiloé died in a shipwreck in 1603 while approaching the archipelago.&lt;ref name=Notasurbina/&gt;

'''Hadrut''' ({{lang-hy|Հադրութ}} {{lang-az|Hadrut}}) is de facto the administrative center of [[Hadrut Province (NKR)|Hadrut Province]], [[Republic of Artsakh|Artsakh]] and de jure a town in the [[Khojavend Rayon]] of [[Azerbaijan]]. The town has been de facto part of the [[Republic of Artsakh]] (formerly the ''Nagorno-Karabakh Republic'') since the end of the 1991-94 [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]]. According to NKR statistics, the town has a population of 4,100 as of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://stat-nkr.am/files/publications/2015/LXH_tverov_2015.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
From 10 September 1939, Hadrut was the capital of the [[Hadrut District (NKAO)|Hadrut rayon]] within the [[Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast]] of the [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic]] until the abolishment of the Autonomous Oblast on 26 November 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Law of Azerbaijan Republic on Abolishment of Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast of Azerbaijan Republic {{cite web |url=http://e-qanun.az/print.php?internal=view&amp;target=1&amp;docid=6783&amp;doctype=0 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424015234/http://e-qanun.az/print.php?internal=view&amp;target=1&amp;docid=6783&amp;doctype=0 |archivedate=2012-04-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]], the town was occupied by the [[Nagorno-Karabakh Defense Army]] on 2 October 1992.

The town is home to the "Mika-Hadrut Winery" for brandy, vodka and wine.

'''ISO 3166-2:IL''' is the entry for [[Israel]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently for Israel, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for [[districts of Israel|6 districts]].

Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is {{mono|IL}}, the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code of Israel. The second part is one or two letters. The code for [[Jerusalem District|Yerushalayim/Al Quds]] ({{mono|IL-JM}}) is assigned based on its English name, Jerusalem.

==Current codes==
Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA).

[[ISO 639-1]] codes are used to represent subdivision names in the following [[official language|administrative language]]s:
* (he): [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]
* (ar): [[Arabic language|Arabic]]

[[File:Imperi de la Corona d'Aragó.png|thumb|The [[Crown of Aragon]] began its expansion in the 13th century under [[James I of Aragon]], and by the 14th-16th centuries, its territories included the [[Duchy of Neopatras]] (in actual [[Greece]]), [[Kingdom of Sicily]], [[Sardinian nationalism|Isle of Sardinia]][[Corsica|, isle of Corsica]],  [[Kingdom of Majorca|Kingdom of Mallorca]], [[Kingdom of Valencia]], [[Principality of Catalonia]] and [[Kingdom of Aragon]]. '''All these united under one Crown, the Crown of Aragon.''']]
'''[[Cartography]] throughout the 14th-16th centuries''' played a significant role in the expansion of the kingdoms of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] for a multitude of reasons. Primarily, the [[map]]s developed during this period served as [[Iberian nautical sciences, 1400–1600|navigational tools]] for maritime folk such as explorers, sailors and navigators. Mostly the expansion of the [[Crown of Aragon]] (which included the [[Kingdom of Aragon]], [[Kingdom of Valencia]] and [[Kingdom of Majorca]], together with the [[Principality of Catalonia]], all its territories with seashore on the Mediterranean Sea. The Crown of Aragon controlled the routes across the Mediterranean Sea from the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] to Europe, as part of the commercial-trade route known as the [[Silk Road]].

They were used to make the travel occurring at the time easier by eliminating the unnecessary resources spent when the most efficient route was not taken, and after things such as wind patterns and [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] began to appear on maps. they made maritime activities such as exploration or conquest less time- and resource-consuming. Maps were also used as a method to plan out landmasses by surveyors in areas that had yet to be explored or did not have many documented statistics. This often was the case in the Americas, where the Iberian empires did not start off with much documented evidence of the landmasses.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Bendall. "Introduction."
''[https://books.google.com/books?id=8eyNG0yTIuMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false To The Ends of the Earth: 100 Maps That Changed the World]''. (London, Marshall Editions: 2006) p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Fernão Vaz Dourado 1571-1.jpg|thumb|right|A pre-Mercator nautical chart of 1571, from Portuguese cartographer [[Fernão Vaz Dourado]] (c. 1520–c. 1580). It belongs to the so-called ''plane chart'' model, where observed latitudes and magnetic directions are plotted directly into the plane, with a constant scale, as if the Earth were plane (Portuguese National Archives of Torre do Tombo, Lisbon).]]
Even still, oftentimes before the availability of maps began to increase, they were used as decorative pieces that were commonly gifted to individuals of very high social status such as kings or popes. Those particular maps frequently had descriptive legends, which usually consisted of drawings being integrated into the actual map. An example of such a map would be the heavily decorated [[Catalan Atlas]], which was produced in 1375. It was used as a gift to the [[King of france|King of France]] from the King of the [[Crown of Aragon]].&lt;ref name="Edson55"&gt;Evelyn Edson. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=dhgYlhXJy_QC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The World Map, 1300–1492: The Persistence of Tradition and Transformation]'' (Maryland, Johns Hopkins University Press: 2007) p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

One other purpose behind maps was [[Cartographic propaganda|propaganda]], and in those circumstances they were used to possibly distort or falsify information. The Dutch used a particular map, which was known as the 'Christian knight map' for this purpose during their [[Dutch Revolt|struggle for independence]] against Spain. In relation to both Spain and Portugal and their influences on each other in terms of cartography, there was one very significant and fairly obvious example that began to develop in the 15th century. The Portuguese had begun to use [[Scale (map)|scales]] of latitude on their nautical charts, and once Portuguese [[cosmography|cosmographers]] were being recruited by the [[Crown of Castile]], the same lines began to appear on Spanish charts as well, which eventually developed into what is known as a [[nautical chart|plane chart]].&lt;ref&gt;Ricardo Padrón. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=GxCv8jUEIsAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Spacious World: Cartography, Literature, and Empire in Early Modern Spain]'' (Chicago, University of Chicago Press: 2004) p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution of the map-making process==
Evolutionary-wise, the specific measurements used in sea charts began to have a practical impact on world maps beginning in the early 14th century with the inclusion of latitude and longitude. Before hand, cartographic works had been developed through less rational methods than mathematical, such as theology and cosmology, but did include statements of geography and history as well. The beginning of the 14th century also introduced the first [[atlas]], which was created through a series of maps being bound together. The new innovation was not just for show, however, as it had many practical uses due to its improved portability and durability, as well as making it easier for the readers to see. Map-making technique began an alteration through geographical thought. While not every map looked the same, a pattern of features developed through the round shape and typical inclusion of some sort of paradise, and were found on many of the maps of that time.&lt;ref&gt;Evelyn Edson. ''The World Map, 1300–1492: The Persistence of Tradition and Transformation'' (Maryland, Johns Hopkins University Press: 2007) p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:TO map.gif|thumb|left|Copy (1475) of [[Isidore of Seville|St. Isidore's]] [[T and O map]] of the world.]]
To better understand the map-making process, a step back in time is required, as Claudius Ptolemaeus, better known as [[Ptolemy]], whose eight-volume work entitled ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geography]]'' played a large role in the development of cartography once it was translated into Latin in 1406. Ptolemy projected two different types of maps in his text. The first, known as a [[Map projection|conic projection]], dealt with the latitude parallels consisting of round arcs. The second, known as a pseudoconic projection, consisted of longitude lines being round.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Harwood. ''To The Ends of the Earth: 100 Maps That Changed the World.'' (London, Marshall Editions: 2006) p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; Ptolemy's work were heavily influential in Islamic science as well, whose maps were quite similar to the Portolan charts and were partly influential on the Catalan map by Abraham Cresques.&lt;ref&gt;Norman J.W. Thrower. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=cGeCNa_vookC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Maps &amp; Civilization: Cartography in Culture and Society]''. (Chicago, University of Chicago Press: 2008) p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 14th century, many of the maps were known as [[T and O map]]s, termed because of a circle representing the earth, and within the circle a T-shape to designate the division of different known land masses, which were Europe, Africa, and Asia. This particular style was representative in the well-known Spanish [[Mappa Mundi]] which was developed a few centuries beforehand, but was also the first map to actually be printed in 1472. Some of these earlier maps relied heavily on Arabic influence, which is evident in the inclusion of frequent Arabic place names. It is thought that this information could have been gathered through experiences throughout different trade routes. The T-O style of map shows a lack of information regarding the specific details of land masses, but once trade began to flourish, so did the detail in maps.&lt;ref&gt;Evelyn Edson. ''The World Map, 1300–1492: The Persistence of Tradition and Transformation''. (Maryland, Johns Hopkins University Press: 2007) p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; Following the simplicity of the [[T-O map|T-O style]], maps began to grow into a greater, fantasy-inspired style. Where beforehand, the descriptiveness was minimal, maps now included beautiful drawings of angels and mythical creatures, and oftentimes these maps were used to understand what was considered to be the history. In the 15th century, maps began to develop an idea and representation of distinctive frontiers. Where the previous maps had indulged in fantastical depictions, terminology began to show up much more frequently now, such as names for regions and provinces.&lt;ref name="Harwood32-51"&gt;Jeremy Harwood. ''To The Ends of the Earth: 100 Maps That Changed the World''. (London, Marshall Editions: 2006) p. 32–51&lt;/ref&gt;  The influence of an eastern orientation was one of the first things to change from the typical features of maps with the loss of fantastical creatures being depicted and the inclusion of more detailed landmasses, and it is possible that this was happening because Arabic influence was causing maps orientation to move away from the east and more toward the south.&lt;ref&gt;Evelyn Edson. ''The World Map, 1300–1492: The Persistence of Tradition and Transformation''. (Maryland, Johns Hopkins University Press: 2007) p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;

==Portolan charts==
[[File:Jorge Aguiar 1492 MR.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Portolan chart by Jorge de Aguiar (1492), the oldest known signed and dated chart of Portuguese origin (Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, University of Yale, New Haven, USA)]]
The term portolan is derivative from ''portolano'' which translates from Italian into 'pilot's book.' While the orientation of earlier maps was generally in the east, and then it moved southward with the Arabic influence established throughout various trade routes, Portolan charts were oriented to the north to make them easier to read.&lt;ref&gt;John R. Short. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=kV3ybVPTN3sC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The World Through Maps: A History of Cartography]''. (Canada, Firefly Books, ltd: 2003) p.62&lt;/ref&gt; [[Portolan charts]] began to surface just prior to the beginning of the 14th century, but the division of such a practical creation was very significant in the map-making world. They were specifically used to solve specific problems. Each chart was an individual, which is important in comparison to the typical map, which had to be studied often with some sort of text to accompany it. The development of Portolan charts is thought to have begun due to an increasing overseas trade empire.&lt;ref name="Harwood32-51"/&gt; Portolan charts were produced with a combination of chart and [[compass]], allowing sailors to venture out farther onto the open water without as significant of a fear of the hopelessness of getting lost. The manufacturer of the chart would draw a scaled distance along with compass bearings to create angles in order to connect the different areas. Using the chart, the sailor or navigator would set a course from one point to the next, and then use what are known as rhumb lines, which are lines of longitude that all cross the meridian at exactly the same angle, to translate the desired course onto a compass heading.&lt;ref&gt;Ricardo Padrón. ''The Spacious World: Cartography, Literature, and Empire in Early Modern Spain'' (Chicago, University of Chicago Press: 2004) p. 61–62&lt;/ref&gt;

The charts included descriptive depictions of coastlines, as well as islands, which enabled seafarers who were accustomed to using such navigational tools as the compass to find their way to said coasts and islands at sea. Included on the chart were a series of thick lines that would be used along with the compass to gather ones bearings. Oftentimes the charts did not include any information on inland structures. There were exceptions, but they were few and usually limited to library copies.&lt;ref name="Newitt7"&gt;Malyn Newitt. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Iv6L1WeiYd4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false A History of Portuguese Overseas Expansion 1400–1668]''. (Milton Park, Routledge: 2005) p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Not all maps designating information that would be most beneficial to Iberian empires were being produced in Portugal or Spain, and the same applied to the information utilized by the Portolan charts. Other maps were being produced in Italy and in Germany, both of which were incorporating not just geographical ideas, but religious and academic ideas as well. At the same time, they were using the information that Portuguese seamen had ambitiously acquired.&lt;ref&gt;Malyn Newitt. ''A History of Portuguese Overseas Expansion 1400–1668''. (Milton Park, Routledge: 2005) p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;   The charts of sailing directions expanded as new sailing routes became more prominent, such as what happened when the [[Canary Islands]] were initially discovered, followed by the discovery of other Atlantic islands. As was the case with general map-making, some of the charts began to incorporate decorative depictions in them as well. Navigational instruments like these did not just have a significant impact on the idea of space through the Iberian empires, but they also played a role in mobility as well. With the use of practical tools like the Portolan charts, people were able to more successful navigate and respectively move class-wise based upon said success.&lt;ref&gt;Evelyn Edson. ''The World Map, 1300–1492: The Persistence of Tradition and Transformation''. (Maryland, Johns Hopkins University Press: 2007) p. 53–58&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spanish oceanic and land exploration and navigation==
Unlike the maps being created in Portugal, those produced in Spain were heavily guarded with an air of secrecy. The [[Habsburg Spain|Habsburgs]] heavily guarded the maps and their advanced level of geographical knowledge because they did not want any of their rivals to be able to obtain them in any way to use against them or to use in order to expand their own empires into lands that Spain was eying. The protection of the maps from falling into undesirable hands was done by the prohibition of any of the maps to appear in print.  This prevented anybody who was not an active involved person in the business of Spain's empire to view the maps.&lt;ref&gt;Ricardo Padrón. ''The Spacious World: Cartography, Literature, and Empire in Early Modern Spain''. (Chicago, University of Chicago Press: 2004) p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; With the printing of Spanish maps not just discouraged, but entirely restricted, there are very few that have survived. Cartography was not at all absent from the [[Spanish empire]]. Quite the contrary, they were used as an imperial effort to self-represent themselves as an Atlantic or global empire. A majority of this focus was placed upon the Indies and creating a spatial representation of structures that they had yet to examine, but needed to integrate with geographical data that they had already obtained in order to develop maps.

As mentioned previously, the revolution of Ptolemy’s rational thinking was what created such a powerful period in time when it came to [[cartography]], because it was uniting transparency with yet-to-be-realized political function. Spain utilized this through its [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|American empire]]. At time, through cartography, Spanish culture has been able to elaborate on more than a two-dimensional idea of space, especially in the instances where climates are shown as a 'portion of the sphere.' That being said, outside of cartography, there is a lack of the idea of space in other aspects of the culture.&lt;ref&gt;Ricardo Padrón. ''The Spacious World: Cartography, Literature, and Empire in Early Modern Spain''. (Chicago, University of Chicago Press: 2004) p. 40–49&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Gutiérrez, the Americas, 1562.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Americae Sive Qvartae Orbis Partis Nova Et Exactissima Descriptio'', 1562]]
 
With landmass structures, opposed to the original ocean-focus, becoming more popular on maps, two things began to change when it came to Spanish cartography. First of all, space was being considered in a different light, and secondly, the way maps were drawn began to change as well. Many of these changes were happening in result of the exploration of the [[New World]]. Where previously maps had been under close guard, availability began to increase. Not only that, but the significance of cartographic depiction followed a similar trend and geographical connotations were no longer limiting the way maps were developed.&lt;ref&gt;Ricardo Padrón. ''The Spacious World: Cartography, Literature, and Empire in Early Modern Spain''. (Chicago, University of Chicago Press: 2004) p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; In order to figure the best way to establish control of sovereign land, government officials of Spain began to record, in mass detail, about the territorial land of said establishments. They did not do this without significant prompting, but it still occurred. The information obtained to fill the requirements to take record was often taken from merchants who could provide accurate information based upon experience. Utilizing the significant information allowed for the Spanish empire to develop appropriate policies to incorporate into the expanding areas.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Vaughn Scammell. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=gVGxcu9hUqMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The First imperial Age: European Overseas Expansion c. 1400-1715]''. (London, Unwin Hyman: 1989) p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; While the extreme precautions taken to keep Spanish maps hidden might allude to the fact that maps were not a part of the imperial effort that was not the case. Maps were very much a part of the self-representations of Spain, which was able to show itself as an Atlantic empire through the cartographic lens. Through their efforts and ambitions, which were visually recorded on the relatively few Spanish maps that survived, Spain was able to facilitate a persistence of cultural trends.&lt;ref&gt;Ricardo Padrón. ''The Spacious World: Cartography, Literature, and Empire in Early Modern Spain''. (Chicago, University of Chicago Press: 2004) p. 12–13&lt;/ref&gt; Delving deeper into that, a representation of it can be made through the relationship between Spain and America, which is where a geometric rationalization really began to occur through cartography in terms of space. It was in the late sixteenth century when Spain was able to represent this idea through rationalizing the American Empire, which was beginning to spread a bit too thinly.&lt;ref&gt;Ricardo Padrón. ''The Spacious World: Cartography, Literature, and Empire in Early Modern Spain''. (Chicago, University of Chicago Press: 2004) p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

As time progressed into the 16th century, the development of Spanish maps began to increase, primarily those that were depicting the [[New World]]. The actual numerical amount of the maps is unknown, but it isn't thought to have been particularly low. The thing was, however, that they only existed in a manuscript form, and still only certain people were able to get their hands on said manuscript. That is still an improvement from how strictly the Spanish were guarding their maps in earlier centuries, but there was still an air of that protectiveness. For the most part, only people who were involved in the exploration or conquest of the New World were able to obtain the maps. There were a few exceptions to that particular rule that included people who were well-versed in Latin, educational publications for the learned, or being produced for those who were not within the boundaries of the Iberian land. Average readers who wanted to look at such a map would either have to gain access to a [[black market]] version or find a [[Woodblock printing|woodcut production]].&lt;ref&gt;Ricardo Padrón. ''The Spacious World: Cartography, Literature, and Empire in Early Modern Spain''. (Chicago, University of Chicago Press: 2004) p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;

==Portuguese oceanic and land exploration and navigation==
Cartography played a large role in the establishment of the expansive Portuguese trade route, and similarly, the trade route played its role in Portuguese cartography. Maps included certain knowledge obtained solely through the connections Portugal had made through their trade routes in Africa and the East, although many of the maps unfortunately did not survive.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Harwood. ''To The Ends of the Earth: 100 Maps That Changed the World.'' (London, Marshall Editions: 2006) p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; Within the first fleets that were sent into the East by Portugal of which there were hopes to develop an economic and trade relationship between the two empires, the leaders of the expedition specifically hired pilots who would be able to gather accurate information in a geographical and navigational sense about the Indian Ocean. There was a map smuggled into Italy in 1502 of Portuguese origin that was documented evidence that the before mentioned pilots were able to gather accurate information, and with that, they created a picture of eastern Africa and western India that was both detailed and valid. As previously mentioned, not only did cartography have a cooperative relationship with the establishment of commerce, but the same applied in a reverse relationship as well. The early expeditions created the well-known [[Cantino map]], but they also were cause of the gathering of information dealing with trade within the Indian Ocean region, which was important in the establishment of Portugal's expansive trade routes.&lt;ref&gt;Malyn Newitt. ''A History of Portuguese Overseas Expansion 1400–1668''. (Milton Park, Routledge: 2005) p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
[[File:Brazil 16thc map.jpg|thumb|left|"Terra Brasilis", Miller Atlas, 1519, [[French National Library]].]]
It is important to note that not all of the information on charts and maps were limited to the seas and oceans, or even the coastlines for that matter.  That was primarily the case, but there were exceptions. There were copies of maps that did include information about land areas past the coast, though they were usually reserved for library use. An example of a map that did include land information, as well as trade information that surpassed what was typically on a map, was the [[Catalan Atlas]], which was dated 1375.&lt;ref name="Newitt7"/&gt; When the Portuguese explored coasts, for example the coast of West Africa, cartographers and navigators would carefully record progress. They were sure to include the names of the places they encountered, as well as doing their best to draw the coast. Unlike Spain, however, despite the fact that there was supposedly a policy of secrecy attached to these records, it was quite often that as soon as data from the voyages was obtained, it was almost instantly recorded for public use and knowledge. Specifically, cartographers began to include actual definition in the territorial land. Cities, rivers, and mountain ranges all began to show up on some maps, whereas others still just included the bare minimum of the outline of the coast. Building from that, maps began to take on an ornamental value. No longer were the purposes just restrained to the seeking of political and economic knowledge, but they became decorative.&lt;ref name="Edson55"/&gt; Building upon the evolution of cartography, the Portuguese went from simply incorporating the waters they traveled to incorporating land masses such as cities, mountains, and rivers. The Portuguese expanded map-making even further by the introduction of the representation of wind systems in the making of their maps.

Once they began to correctly understand the wind systems in both the Indian and Atlantic Oceans, they were able to use that knowledge in order to expand their global trade routes even further, which in turn established an even further spread out empire.  While the Portuguese were very innovative in their map-making, they still relied heavily on the cartographical knowledge of others, such as the Arabs, Japanese, and Chinese, when it came down to the actual observing and mapping of the global world. They did obtain their own information, but the maps were visibly a mixture of those observations, as well as other information that they had taken from other experts on cartography. The knowledge and the methods of obtaining information used by Portuguese cartographers drew upon the skill and knowledge of Muslim navigators. That being said, they still would conduct their own evaluations by writing down details they obtained when at port in other areas. The same applied to how they obtained some of their information of the land masses that were beginning to show up more and more in maps, opposed to the former method of just applying information regarding to the seas and oceans.&lt;ref&gt;Malyn Newitt. ''A History of Portuguese Overseas Expansion 1400–1668''. (Milton Park, Routledge: 2005) p. 265&lt;/ref&gt;

As time progressed into the late sixteenth century, Portugal’s ocean-based trade routes began to become more widely known. While their maps were not nearly as heavily guarded as those under the Hapsburg rule in Spain, they were still kept within Portugal. That began to change when those maps had started to appear abroad. Not only that, but Portuguese navigators began to take positions in other countries, which furthered the spread of the [[Portuguese Empire]] in other nations.&lt;ref&gt;Malyn Newitt. ''A History of Portuguese Overseas Expansion 1400–1668''. (Milton Park, Routledge: 2005) p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; The Portuguese also attempted to utilize cartography in order to integrate the [[indigenous people]] under colonial rule. Displacement of these indigenous populations did occur in under a cartographic lens, but despite that, a representation of imperial space was established.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Safier.

Akerman (ed.). ''The Imperial Map: Cartography and the Mastery of Empire''. (Chicago, University of Chicago Press: 2009) p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''Indian reservation''' is a legal designation for an area of [[Land tenure|land managed]] by a federally recognized [[tribe (Native American)|Native American tribe]] under the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs|U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs]] rather than the [[state governments of the United States]] in which they are physically located. Each of the 326&lt;ref name="Department of the Interior"/&gt; [[List of Indian reservations in the United States|Indian reservations in the United States]] is associated with a particular [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] nation. Not all of the country's 567&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Department of the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs|title=Indian Entities Recognized and Eligible to Receive Services From the United States Bureau of Indian Affairs|url=https://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/biaind.pdf|work=Federal Register|volume=80|issue=9|date=January 14, 2015|pages=1942–1948|id=FR Doc. 2015–00509 Filed 1–13–15; 8:45 am}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bia.gov/cs/groups/public/documents/text/idc1-030831.pdf|title=Federal Acknowledgment of the Pamunkey Indian Tribe|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[List of Native American Tribal Entities|recognized tribes]] have a reservation—some tribes have more than one reservation, while some share reservations. In addition, because of past [[Dawes Act|land allotments]], leading to some sales to non–Native Americans, some reservations are severely fragmented, with each piece of [[tribal]], [[individual]], and privately held land being a separate [[enclave]]. This jumble of private and public real estate creates significant administrative, political, and legal difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

The collective geographical area of all reservations is {{convert|56,200,000|acre|ha sqmi sqkm|lk=on}},&lt;ref name="Department of the Interior"/&gt; approximately the size of [[Idaho]]. While most reservations are small compared to U.S. states, there are 12 Indian reservations larger than the state of [[Rhode Island]]. The largest reservation, the [[Navajo Nation|Navajo Nation Reservation]], is similar in size to [[West Virginia]]. Reservations are unevenly distributed throughout the country; the majority are west of the Mississippi River and occupy lands that were first reserved by [[treaty]] or "[[Indian Land Grants|granted]]" from the public domain.&lt;ref&gt;Kinney, 1937; Sutton, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

Because tribes possess the concept of [[tribal sovereignty]], even though it is limited, laws on tribal lands vary from those of the surrounding area.&lt;ref&gt;Davies &amp; Clow; Sutton 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; These laws can permit legal [[Native American gambling enterprises|casinos]] on reservations, for example, which attract [[tourism|tourists]]. The tribal council, not the local government or the [[Federal government of the United States|United States federal government]], often has jurisdiction over reservations. Different reservations have different systems of government, which may or may not replicate the forms of government found outside the reservation. Most Native American reservations were established by the federal government; a limited number, mainly in the East, owe their origin to state recognition.&lt;ref&gt;For general data, see Tiller (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "reservation" comes from the conception of the Native American tribes as independent sovereigns at the time the U.S. Constitution was ratified.  Thus, the early peace treaties (often signed under [[duress]]) in which Native American tribes surrendered large portions of land to the U.S. also designated parcels which the tribes, as sovereigns, "[[Reservation (law)|reserved]]" to themselves, and those parcels came to be called "reservations".&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''United States v. Dion'', {{ussc|476|734|1986}}; ''Francis v. Francis'', {{ussc|203|233|1906}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The term remained in use even after the federal government began to forcibly relocate tribes to parcels of land to which they had no historical connection.

Today a majority of Native Americans and [[Alaska Natives]] live somewhere other than the reservations, often in larger western cities such as [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] and [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/hhes/www/housing/housing_patterns/pdftoc.html |title=Racial and Ethnic Residential Segregation in the United States: 1980–2000 |publisher=Census.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For Los Angeles, see Allen, J. P. and E. Turner, 2002. Text and map of the metropolitan area show the widespread urban distribution of California and other Native Americans.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, there were over 2.5 million Native Americans with about 1 million living on reservations.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/04/us-stolen-land-indian-tribes-un US should return stolen land to Indian tribes, says United Nations]".

==History==

===Colonial and early US history===
From the beginning of the [[European colonization of the Americas]], Europeans often removed native peoples from lands they wished to occupy. The means varied, including treaties made under considerable duress, forceful ejection, and violence, and in a few cases voluntary moves based on mutual agreement. The removal caused many problems such as tribes losing means of livelihood by being subjected to a defined area, farmers having inadmissible land for agriculture, and hostility between tribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ushistory.org/us/40d.asp|title=Native American reservation background |last= |first= |date= |access-date=September 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first reservation was established in [[South Jersey|southern New Jersey]] on August 29, 1758. It was called Brotherton Indian Reservation &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=This Day in Geographic History: First Indian Reservation |url=https://www.nationalgeographic.org/thisday/aug29/first-indian-reservation/ |website=National Geographic Society |publisher=National Geographic Society |accessdate=12 July 2018 |language=en |date=18 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also ''Edgepillock'' &lt;ref name="AccessibleArchives"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Thomas |first1=JD |title=The Colonies' First and New Jersey's Only Indian Reservation |url=http://www.accessible-archives.com/2013/08/colonies-first-new-jerseys-indian-reservation/ |website=Accessible Archives Inc. |accessdate=12 July 2018 |date=29 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Edgepelick'' &lt;ref name="Kepharts"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kephart |first1=Bill &amp; Mary |title=The Kepharts: Cohawkin, Raccoon Creek, Narraticon all names left by Lenni-Lenape in Gloucester County |url=https://www.nj.com/gloucester/voices/index.ssf/2010/11/the_kepharts_cohawkin_raccoon.html |website=NJ.com |accessdate=12 July 2018 |quote=In 1758, the Colonial Legislature purchased land in Burlington County for a reservation.

In 1764 the "Plan for the Future Management of Indian Affairs" was proposed by the Board of Trade.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Although never adopted formally, the plan established the imperial government's expectation that land would only be bought by colonial governments, not individuals, and that land would only be purchased at public meetings.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Additionally, this plan dictated that the Indians would be properly consulted when ascertaining and defining the boundaries of colonial settlement.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;[https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Franklin/01-13-02-0159 Remarks on the Plan for Regulating the Indian Trade, September 1766-October 1766], ''Founders Online''&lt;/ref&gt;

The private contracts that once characterized the sale of Indian land to various individuals and groups—from farmers to towns—were replaced by [[treaties]] between sovereigns.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This protocol was adopted by the United States Government after the American Revolution.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

On March 11, 1824, [[John C. Calhoun]] founded the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs|Office of Indian Affairs]] (now the Bureau of Indian Affairs) as a division of the [[United States Department of War]] (now the [[United States Department of Defense]]), to solve the land problem with 38 treaties with American Indian tribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Belko, William S. |title=John C.

== Indigenous Reservations before 1850 ==

=== Letters from the Presidents of the United State’s of America on Indigenous Reservations (1825-1837)===
The document “Indian Treaties, and Laws and Regulations Relating to Indian Affairs”’ published in 1825 in Washington City, [[United States|America]] was signed by &lt;ref&gt;Andrew Jackson, “A letter by Andrew Jackson, President of the United States of America, Indian Treaties and Laws and Regulations Relating to Indian Affairs: To Which Is Added, An Appendix. Way and Gideon, Printers,” 1826. &lt;/ref&gt; president [[Andrew Jackson]]. He states that “we have placed the land reserves in a better state for the benefit of society” with approval of Indigenous reservations prior to 1850.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Jackson, “A letter by Andrew Jackson, President of the United States of America, Indian Treaties and Laws and Regulations Relating to Indian Affairs: To Which Is Added, An Appendix. Way and Gideon, Printers,” 1826, 580. &lt;/ref&gt;The letter is signed by [[Isaac Shelby]] and the American President and discusses several regulations regarding Indigenous people of America and the approval of Indigenous segregation and the reservation system.

[[Martin Van Buren|President Martin Van Buren]] writes a Treaty with the Saginaw Tribe of Chippewas in 1837 to build a light house. The President of the United States of America was directly involved in the creation of new [[Treaty|Treaties]] regarding [[Indian reservation|Indian Reservations]] before 1850. He says Indigenous Reservations are “all their reserves of land in the state of Michigan, on the principle of said reserves being sold at the public land offices for their benefit and the actual proceeds being paid to them.”&lt;ref&gt;Martin Van Buren, President of the United States of America, ”Treaties between the United States and the Saginaw tribe of Chippewas,” 1837. &lt;/ref&gt; The agreement is for the Indigenous Tribe to sell their land, based on a Reservation to build a “lighthouse.”&lt;ref&gt;Martin Van Buren, President of the United States of America, ”Treaties between the United States and the Saginaw tribe of Chippewas,” 1837. &lt;/ref&gt; President, Martin Van Buren wants to buy Indigenous Reservation Land to build [[infrastructure]].

A Treaty signed by John Forsyth, the Secretary of State on behalf of, President Martin Van Buren of the United States of America also dictates where Indigenous peoples must live in terms of the reservation system in America between the [[Oneida people|Oneida People]] in 1838. This Treaty allows the Indigenous peoples five years on a specific reserve “the west shores of Saganaw bay.”&lt;ref&gt;John Forsyth, the Secretary of State On behalf of, President Buren, Martin Van of the United States. Martin Van Buren, “Treaty Between: The United States of America and the First Christian and Orchard Parties of the Oneida Indians,''”'' 1838.&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of reservations for Indigenous people of America could be as little as a five year approval before 1850. Article two of the Treaty claims “the reserves on the river Angrais and at Rifle river, of which said Indians are to have the usufruct and occupancy for five years.” Indigenous people had restraints pushed on them by the five year allowance. 

=== Early land sales in Virginia  (1705-1713) ===
Scholarly author Buck Woodard uses executive papers from Governor [[William H. Cabell]] in his article, “Indian Land sales and allotment in Antebellum Virginia” to discuss Indigenous reservations in America before 1705 specifically in Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;Buck Woodard, “Indian Land sales and allotment in Antebellum Virginia: trustees, tribal agency, and the Nottoway Reservation,” ''American Nineteenth Century History'' 17. no. 2 (2016): page number. 161-180.&lt;/ref&gt; He claims “the colonial government again recognized the Nottoway’s land rights by treaty in 1713, at the conclusion of the Tuscaro War.”&lt;ref&gt;Buck Woodard, “Indian Land sales and allotment in Antebellum Virginia: trustees, tribal agency, and the Nottoway Reservation,” ''American Nineteenth Century History'' 17. no. 2 (2016): page number. 161-180.&lt;/ref&gt; The Indigenous peoples of America had Land Treaty agreements as early as 1713.&lt;ref&gt;Buck Woodard, “Indian Land sales and allotment in Antebellum Virginia: trustees, tribal agency, and the Nottoway Reservation,” ''American Nineteenth Century History'' 17. no. 2 (2016): page number. 161-180.&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== The beginning of the Indigenous Reservation System in America (1763-1834) ===
The American Indigenous Reservation system started with “the Royal Proclamation of 1763, where Great Britain set aside an enormous resource for Indians in the territory of the presently United States.”&lt;ref&gt;James E Togerson "Indians against Immigrants: Old Rivals, New Rules: A Brief Review and Comparison of Indian Law in the Contiguous United States, Alaska, and Canada." ''American Indian Law Review'' 14, no. 1 (1988), 58.&lt;/ref&gt; Another act put forward by America was when “Congress passed the Indian Removal Act in 1830.”&lt;ref&gt;James E Togerson "Indians against Immigrants: Old Rivals, New Rules: A Brief Review and Comparison of Indian Law in the Contiguous United States, Alaska, and Canada." ''American Indian Law Review'' 14, no. 1 (1988), 57-103.&lt;/ref&gt; A third act pushed through was “the federal government relocated “portions of [the] ‘Five Civilized Tribes’ from the southeastern states in the Non-Intercourse Act of 1834.”&lt;ref&gt;James E Togerson "Indians against Immigrants: Old Rivals, New Rules: A Brief Review and Comparison of Indian Law in the Contiguous United States, Alaska, and Canada." ''American Indian Law Review'' 14, no. 1 (1988), 59.&lt;/ref&gt; The Indigenous Reservation system in the United States of America began in 1763 with the Royal Proclamation set by Great Britain, the “Indian Removal Act of 1830” and the “Non-Intercourse act of 1834” which all came into play in the forceful removal of Indigenous peoples into specific land Reservations.&lt;ref&gt;James E Togerson "Indians against Immigrants: Old Rivals, New Rules: A Brief Review and Comparison of Indian Law in the Contiguous United States, Alaska, and Canada." ''American Indian Law Review'' 14, no. 1 (1988), 57-103.&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Treaty between America and the Menomee Nation (1831) ===
Scholarly author James Oberly discusses the “The Treaty of 1831 between the Menominee Nation and the United States”&lt;ref&gt;James Oberly, ““Decision on Duck Creek: Two Green Bay Reservations and Their Boundaries, 1816-1996,” ''American Indian Culture &amp; Research Journal'' 24, no. 3 (2000): 39-76.&lt;/ref&gt; in his article, “Decision on Duck Creek: Two Green Bay Reservations and Their Boundaries, 1816-1996.” Another Treaty regarding Indigenous Reservations before 1850. There is a conflict between the Menomee Nation and the [[Wisconsin|State of Wisconsin]] and “the 1831 Menomee Treaty …  ran the boundary between the lands of the Oneida, known in the Treaty as the “New York Indians.”&lt;ref&gt;James Oberly, ““Decision on Duck Creek: Two Green Bay Reservations and Their Boundaries, 1816-1996,” ''American Indian Culture &amp; Research Journal'' 24, no. 3 (2000): 39-76.&lt;/ref&gt; This Treaty from 1831 is the cause of conflicts and is disputed because the land used to be good hunting grounds, but not anymore.

=== 1834 Trade and Intercourse Act (1834) ===
The Trade and Intercourse Act of 1834 says “In the 1834 Indian Trade and Intercourse Act, the United States defined the boundaries of Indian County.”&lt;ref&gt;William J Bauer, “The Rise and Fall of Indian Country, 1825-1855,” ''History: Reviews of New Books'' 36, no. 2 (Winter 2008): 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, “For Unrau, Indigenous Country is less on Indigenous homeland and more a place where the U.S. removed Indians from east of the Mississippi River and applied unique laws.”&lt;ref&gt;William J Bauer, “The Rise and Fall of Indian Country, 1825-1855,” ''History: Reviews of New Books'' 36, no. 2 (Winter 2008): 50.&lt;/ref&gt; The United States of America applied laws on Indigenous Reservations depending on where they were located like the [[Mississippi River]]. This act came too, because “the federal government began to compress Indigenous lands because it needed to send troops to Texas during the Mexican-American War and protect American immigration travelling to Oregon and California.” &lt;ref&gt;William J Bauer, “The Rise and Fall of Indian Country, 1825-1855,” ''History: Reviews of New Books'' 36, no. 2 (Winter 2008): 51.&lt;/ref&gt; The Federal Government of America had their own needs and desires for Indigenous Land Reservations. He says, “the reconnaissance of explorers and other American officials understood that Indigenous Country possessed good land, bountiful game, and potential mineral resources.”&lt;ref&gt;William J Bauer, “The Rise and Fall of Indian Country, 1825-1855,” ''History: Reviews of New Books'' 36, no. 2 (Winter 2008): 51.&lt;/ref&gt; The American Government claimed Indigenous land for their own benefits with these creations of Indigenous Land Reservations . 

=== Indigenous Reservation System in Texas (1845) ===
States such as [[Texas]] had their own policy when it came to Indian Reservations in America before 1850. Scholarly author, George D. Harmon discusses Texas’ own reservation system which “Prior to 1845, Texas had inaugurated and pursued her own Indian Policy of the U.S.”&lt;ref&gt;George D Harmon, "The United States Indian Policy in Texas, 1845-1860,” ''The Mississippi Valley Historical Review'' 17, no. 3 (1930): 379.&lt;/ref&gt; Texas was one of the States before 1850 that chose to create their own reservation system as seen in Harmon’s article, “The United States Indian Policy in Texas, 1845-1860.”&lt;ref&gt;George D Harmon, "The United States Indian Policy in Texas, 1845-1860,” ''The Mississippi Valley Historical Review'' 17, no. 3 (1930)&lt;/ref&gt;  The State of “Texas had given only a few hundred acres of land in 1840, for the purpose of colonization”.&lt;ref&gt;George D Harmon, "The United States Indian Policy in Texas, 1845-1860,” ''The Mississippi Valley Historical Review'' 17, no. 3 (1930): 379.&lt;/ref&gt; However, “In March, 1847, … [a] special agent [was sent] to Texas to manage the Indian affairs in the State until Congress should take some definite and final action.”&lt;ref&gt;George D Harmon, "The United States Indian Policy in Texas, 1845-1860,” ''The Mississippi Valley Historical Review'' 17, no. 3 (1930): 380.&lt;/ref&gt; The United States of America allowed it’s states to make up their own treaties such as this one in Texas for the purpose of colonization. 

== Rise of Indian removal policy (1830–1868) ==
{{Main|Indian removal}}
The passage of the [[Indian Removal Act]] of 1830 marked the systematization of a U.S. federal government policy of forcibly moving Native populations away from European-populated areas.

One example was the [[Five Civilized Tribes]], who were removed from their native lands in the southern United States and moved to modern-day [[Oklahoma]], in a mass migration that came to be known as the [[Trail of Tears]]. Some of the lands these tribes were given to inhabit following the removals eventually became Indian reservations.

In 1851, the [[United States Congress]] passed the [[Indian Appropriations Act]] which authorized the creation of Indian reservations in modern-day [[Oklahoma]]. Relations between settlers and natives had grown increasingly worse as the settlers encroached on territory and natural resources in the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bennett|first=Elmer|title=Federal Indian Law|year=2008|publisher=The Lawbook Exchange|isbn= 9781584777762|pages=201–203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forced assimilation (1868–1887)===
[[File:New-mexico-rez.jpg|thumb|Most Indian reservations, like the [[Laguna Indian Reservation, New Mexico|Laguna Indian reservation]] in New Mexico (pictured here in 1943), are in the western United States, often in regions suitable more for ranching than farming.]]
In 1868, President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] pursued a "Peace Policy" as an attempt to avoid violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/nativevoices/timeline/342.html|title=President Grant advances "Peace Policy" with tribes|publisher=US National Library of Medicine|accessdate=15 Nov 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy included a reorganization of the Indian Service, with the goal of relocating various tribes from their ancestral homes to parcels of lands established specifically for their inhabitation. The policy called for the replacement of government officials by religious men, nominated by churches, to oversee the Indian agencies on reservations in order to teach [[Christianity]] to the native tribes. The [[Society of Friends|Quakers]] were especially active in this policy on reservations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://millercenter.org/president/grant/essays/biography/4?ModPagespeed=noscript Miller Center, University of Virginia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408211757/http://millercenter.org/president/grant/essays/biography/4?ModPagespeed=noscript |date=2014-04-08 }}, Retrieved April 7, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The policy was controversial from the start. Reservations were generally established by [[Executive order (United States)|executive order]]. In many cases, white settlers objected to the size of land parcels, which were subsequently reduced. A report submitted to Congress in 1868 found widespread corruption among the federal Native American agencies and generally poor conditions among the relocated tribes.

Many tribes ignored the relocation orders at first and were forced onto their limited land parcels. Enforcement of the policy required the [[United States Army]] to restrict the movements of various tribes. The pursuit of tribes in order to force them back onto reservations led to a number wars with Native Americans which included some massacres. The most well-known conflict was the [[Sioux War]] on the northern [[Great Plains]], between 1876 and 1881, which included the [[Battle of Little Bighorn]]. Other famous wars in this regard included the [[Nez Perce War]].

By the late 1870s, the policy established by President Grant was regarded as a failure, primarily because it had resulted in some of the bloodiest wars between Native Americans and the United States. By 1877, President [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] began phasing out the policy, and by 1882 all religious organizations had relinquished their authority to the federal Indian agency.

===Individualized reservations (1887–1934)===
In 1887, Congress undertook a significant change in reservation policy by the passage of the [[Dawes Act]], or General Allotment (Severalty) Act. The act ended the general policy of granting land parcels to tribes as-a-whole by granting small parcels of land to individual tribe members. In some cases, for example, the [[Umatilla Indian Reservation]], after the individual parcels were granted out of reservation land, the reservation area was reduced by giving the "excess land" to white settlers. The individual allotment policy continued until 1934 when it was terminated by the [[Indian Reorganization Act]].

===Indian New Deal (1934–present)===
The [[Indian Reorganization Act]] of 1934, also known as the ''Howard-Wheeler Act'', was sometimes called the ''Indian New Deal'' and was initiated by [[John Collier (sociologist)|John Collier]]. It laid out new rights for Native Americans, reversed some of the earlier privatization of their common holdings, and encouraged [[tribal sovereignty]] and land management by tribes. The act slowed the assignment of tribal lands to individual members and reduced the assignment of "extra" holdings to nonmembers.

For the following 20 years, the U.S. government invested in infrastructure, health care, and education on the reservations. Likewise, over two million acres (8,000&amp;nbsp;km²) of land were returned to various tribes. Within a decade of Collier's retirement the government's position began to swing in the opposite direction. The new Indian Commissioners Myers and Emmons introduced the idea of the "withdrawal program" or "[[Indian termination policy|termination]]", which sought to end the government's responsibility and involvement with Indians and to force their assimilation.

The Indians would lose their lands but were to be compensated, although many were not. Even though discontent and social rejection killed the idea before it was fully implemented, five tribes were terminated—the [[Coushatta]], [[Ute Tribe|Ute]], [[Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah|Paiute]], [[Menominee]] and [[Klamath people|Klamath]]—and 114 groups in California lost their federal recognition as tribes. Many individuals were also relocated to cities, but one-third returned to their tribal reservations in the decades that followed.

==Land tenure and federal Indian law==
With the establishment of reservations, tribal territories diminished to a fraction of original areas and indigenous customary practices of land tenure sustained only for a time, and not in every instance. Instead, the federal government established regulations that subordinated tribes to the authority, first, of the military, and then of the Bureau (Office) of Indian Affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Kinney 1937&lt;/ref&gt; Under federal law, the government patented reservations to tribes, which became legal entities that at later times have operated in a corporate manner. [[Tribal tenure]] identifies jurisdiction over [[land-use planning]] and zoning, negotiating (with the close participation of the Bureau of Indian Affairs) leases for timber harvesting and mining.&lt;ref name="Tiller 1996"&gt;Tiller (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

Tribes generally have authority over other forms of economic development such as ranching, agriculture, tourism, and casinos.  Tribes hire both members, other Indians and non-Indians in varying capacities; they may run tribal stores, gas stations, and develop museums (e.g., there is a gas station and general store at Fort Hall Indian Reservation, [[Idaho]], and a museum at Foxwoods, on the Mashantucket Pequot Indian Reservation in [[Connecticut]]).&lt;ref name="Tiller 1996"/&gt;

Tribal members may utilize a number of resources held in tribal tenures such as grazing range and some cultivable lands. They may also construct homes on tribally held lands. As such, members are [[tenants-in-common]], which may be likened to communal tenure. Even if some of this pattern emanates from pre-reservation tribal custom, generally the tribe has the authority to modify tenant in-common practices.

[[File:Wagon loaded with squash - NARA - 285663.jpg|thumb|left|Wagon loaded with squash, [[Rosebud Indian Reservation]], ca. 1936]]
With the [[Dawes Act|General Allotment Act (Dawes)]], 1887, the government sought to individualize tribal lands by authorizing allotments held in [[individual tenure]].&lt;ref&gt;Getches et al, pp. 140–190.&lt;/ref&gt;  Generally, the allocation process led to grouping family holdings and, in some cases, this sustained pre-reservation clan or other patterns.  There had been a few allotment programs ahead of the Dawes Act. However, the vast fragmentation of reservations occurred from the enactment of this act up to 1934, when the Indian Reorganization Act was passed.  However, Congress authorized some allotment programs in the ensuing years, such as on the Palm Springs/Agua Caliente Indian Reservation in California.&lt;ref&gt;The Equalization Act, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt;

Allotment set in motion a number of circumstances: 
* individuals could sell (alienate) the allotment – under the Dawes Act, it was not to happen until after twenty-five years.
* individual allottees who would die intestate would encumber the land under prevailing state devisement laws, leading to complex patterns of heirship.  Congress has attempted to mollify the impact of heirship by granting tribes the capacity to acquire fragmented allotments owing to heirship by financial grants.  Tribes may also include such parcels in long-range land use planning.
* With alienation to non-Indians, their increased presence on numerous reservations has changed the demography of Indian Country.  One of many implications of this fact is that tribes can not always effectively embrace the total management of a reservation, for non-Indian owners and users of allotted lands contend that tribes have no authority over lands that fall within the tax and law-and-order  jurisdiction of local government.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, ed., 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

The demographic factor, coupled with landownership data, led, for example, to litigation between the Devils Lake Sioux and the State of North Dakota, where non-Indians owned more acreage than tribal members even though more Native Americans resided on the reservation than non-Indians. The court decision turned, in part, on the perception of ''Indian character'', contending that the tribe did not have jurisdiction over the alienated allotments. In a number of instances—e.g., the Yakama Indian Reservation—tribes have identified ''open'' and ''closed'' areas within reservations.  One finds the majority of non-Indian landownership and residence in the open areas and, contrariwise, closed areas represent exclusive tribal residence and related conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Wishart and Froehling&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Indian Country]] today consists of tripartite government—i. e., federal, state and/or local, and tribal.  Where state and local governments may exert some, but limited, law-and-order authority, tribal sovereignty is diminished.  This situation prevails in connection with Indian gaming because federal legislation makes the state a party to any contractual or [[statutory]] agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, other-occupancy on reservations may be by virtue of tribal or individual tenure. There are many churches on reservations; most would occupy tribal land by consent of the federal government or the tribe.  BIA agency offices, hospitals, schools, and other facilities usually occupy residual federal parcels within reservations. Many reservations include one or more sections (about 640 acres) of school lands, but those lands typically remain part of the reservation (e.g., Enabling Act of 1910 at Section 20&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.azleg.state.az.us/const/enabling.pdf|title=Enabling Act of 1910|accessdate=8 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;).  As a general practice, such lands may sit idle or be grazed by tribal ranchers.

==Disputes over land sovereignty==

When the Europeans discovered the "New World" in the fifteenth century, the land that was new to them had been home to Native Peoples for thousands of years. The American colonial government determined a precedent of establishing the land sovereignty of North America through treaties between countries. This precedent was upheld by the United States government. As a result, most Native American land was "purchased" by the United States government, a portion of which was designated to remain under Native sovereignty. The United States government and Native Peoples do not always agree on how land should be governed, which has resulted in a series of disputes over sovereignty.

=== Black Hills land dispute ===
{{Main|Black Hills Land Claim}}
The Federal Government and [[Lakota people|The Lakota Sioux]] tribe members have been involved in sorting out a legal claim for the [[Black Hills]] since signing the 1868 Fort Laramie Treaty,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?vid=3&amp;sid=b995b82d-9f65-4e02-9103-682093953491@sessionmgr4010&amp;hid=4108&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmU=#AN=edsgcl.417844931&amp;db=edsglt|title='It doesn't seem very fair, because we were here first': resolving the Siou...: Start Your Search!|website=eds.a.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; which created what is known today as the Great Sioux Nation covering the Black Hills and nearly half of western South Dakota.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This treaty was acknowledged and respected until 1874, when General George Custer discovered gold,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; sending a wave of settlers into the area and leading to the realization of the value of the land from United States President Grant.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; President Grant used tactical military force to remove the Sioux from the land and assisted in the development of the Congressional appropriations bill for Indian Services in 1876, a "starve or sell"&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-03-17|title=Black Hills Land Claim|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Black_Hills_Land_Claim&amp;oldid=770733121|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; treaty signed by only 10% of the 75% tribal men required based on specifications from the [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)|Fort Laramie Treaty]]&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-03-12|title=United States v.

The Black Hills are sacred to the Sioux as a place central to their spirituality and identity,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and contest of ownership of the land has been pressured in the courts by the Sioux Nation since they were allowed legal avenue in 1920.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Beginning in 1923, the Sioux made legal claim that their relinquishment from the Black Hills was illegal under the Fifth Amendment, and no amount of money can make up for the loss of their sacred land.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This claim went all the way up to the Supreme Court ''[[United States v. Sioux Nation of Indians]]'' case in 1979 after being revived by Congress, and the Sioux were awarded over $100 million as they ruled that the seizure of the Black Hills was in fact illegal. The Sioux have continually rejected the money, and since then the award has been accruing interest in trust accounts, and amounts to about $1 billion in 2015.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

During President Barack Obama's campaign he made indications that the case of the Black Hills was going to be solved with innovate solutions and consultation,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; but this was questioned when White House Counsel Leonard Garment sent a note to The Ogala people saying, "The days of treaty making with the American Indians ended in 1871; ...only Congress can rescind or change in any way statutes enacted since 1871." &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The He Sapa Reparations Alliance &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; was established after Obama's inauguration to educate the Sioux people and propose a bill to Congress that would allocate 1.3 million acres of federal land within the Black Hills to the tribe. To this day, the dispute of the Black Hills is ongoing&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; with the trust estimated to be worth nearly $1.3 billion&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/north_america-july-dec11-blackhills_08-23/|title=Why the Sioux Are Refusing $1.3 Billion|work=PBS NewsHour|access-date=2017-03-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sources believe principles of restorative justice &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; may be the best solution to addressing this century old dispute.

=== Iroquois land claims in Upstate New York ===
[[File:Fort Stanwix National Monument FTST3697.jpg|thumb|[[Fort Stanwix National Monument|Fort Stanwix]], NY]]
While 1783 Treaty of Paris that ended the American Revolution addressed land sovereignty disputes between the British Crown and the colonies, it neglected to settle hostilities between indigenous people— specifically those who fought on the side of the British, as four of the members of the Haudenosaunee did— and colonists.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In October 1784 the newly formed United States government facilitated negotiations with representatives from the Six Nations in Fort Stanwix, New York.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;[https://www.nps.gov/fost/learn/historyculture/treaty-landtransaction-1784.htm Treaty and Land Transaction of 1784], ''National Park Service''&lt;/ref&gt; The treaty produced in 1784 resulted in Indians giving up their territory within the Ohio River Valley and the U.S. guaranteeing the Haudenosaunee six million acres— about half of what is present day New York— as permanent homelands.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Unenthusiastic about the treaty's conditions, the state of New York secured a series of twenty-six "leases," many of them lasting 999 years on all native territories within its boundaries.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Led to believe that they had already lost their land to the New York Genesee Company, the Haudenosaunee agreed to land leasing which was presented by New York Governor George Clinton as a means by which the indigenous could maintain sovereignty over their land.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; On August 28, 1788, the [[Oneida people|Oneidas]] leased five million acres to the state in exchange for $2,000 in cash, $2,000 in clothing, $1,000 in provisions and $600 annual rent. The other two tribes followed with similar arrangements.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The [[Holland Land Company]] gained control over all but ten acres of the native land leased to the state on September 15, 1797.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; These 397 square miles were subsequently parceled out and subleased to whites, allegedly ending the native title to land. Despite Iroquois protests, federal authorities did virtually nothing to correct the injustice.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Certain of losing all of their land, in 1831 most of the Oneidas asked that what was left of their holdings be exchanged for 500,000 acres purchased from the [[Menominee]]s in Wisconsin.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; President Andrew Jackson, committed to [[Indian removal|Indian Removal]] west of the Mississippi, agreed.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The Treaty of Buffalo Creek, signed on January 15, 1838, directly ceded 102,069 acres of [[Seneca people|Seneca]] land to the Ogden company for $202,000, a sum that was divided evenly between the government— to hold in trust for Indians— and non-Indian individuals who wanted to buy and improve the plots.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; All that was left of the Cayuga, Oneida, Onondaga and Tuscarora holding was extinguished at a total cost of $400,000 to Ogden.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

After Indian complaints, a second Treaty of Buffalo was written in 1842 in attempts to mediate tension.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Under this treaty the Haudenosaunee were given the right to reside in New York and small areas of reservations were restored by the U.S. government.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

These agreements were largely ineffective in protecting Native American land. By 1889 eighty percent of all Iroquois reservation land in New York was leased by non-Haudenosaunees.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Navajo–Hopi land dispute ===
{{See also|Hopi#Hopi–Navajo land disputes}}
The modern-day Navajo and Hopi Indian Reservations are located in Northern Arizona, near the Four Corners area. The Hopi reservation is 2,531.773 square miles &lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2016-08-14|title=Hopi Reservation|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hopi_Reservation&amp;oldid=734495524|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; within Arizona and lies surrounded by the greater Navajo reservation which spans 27,413 square miles &lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-04-03|title=Navajo Nation|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Navajo_Nation&amp;oldid=773682443|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and extends slightly into the states of New Mexico and Utah. The Hopi, also known as the Pueblo people, made many spiritually motivated migrations throughout the Southwest before settling in present-day Northern Arizona.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dongoske|first=Kurt E.|date=1996-01-01|title=The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act: A New Beginning, Not the End, for Osteological Analysis--A Hopi Perspective|jstor=1185706|journal=American Indian Quarterly|volume=20|issue=2|pages=287–296|doi=10.2307/1185706}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Navajo people also migrated throughout western North America following spiritual commands before settling near the Grand Canyon area. The two tribes peacefully coexisted and even traded and exchanged ideas with each other; However, their way of lives were threatened when the "New people", what the Navajo called white settlers,&lt;ref&gt;DeAngelis, T. (2004). The Navajo: Weavers of the Southwest. Mankato, MN: Blue Earth Books.&lt;/ref&gt; began executing Natives across the continent and claiming their land, as a result of Andrew Jackson's Indian Removal Act. War ensued between the Navajo people, who call themselves the Diné, and new Americans. The end result was the Long Walk in the early 1860s in which the entire tribe was forced to walk roughly 400 miles from Fort Canby (present day Window Rock, Arizona) to Bosque Redondo in New Mexico. This march is similar to the well known Cherokee "Trail of Tears" and like it, many tribe did not survive the trek. The roughly 11,000 tribe members were imprisoned here in what the United States government deemed an experimental Indian reservation that failed because it became too expensive, there were too many people to feed, and they were continuously raided by other native tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Reidhead, S. (2001). Wild West.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, in 1868, the Navajo were allowed to return to their homeland after signing the [[Treaty of Bosque Redondo]]. The treaty officially established the "Navajo Indian Reservation" in Northern Arizona.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The term reservation is one which creates territorialities or claims on places. This treaty gave them the right to the land and semi-autonomous governance of it. The Hopi reservation, on the other hand, was created through an executive order by President Arthur in 1882.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

A few years after the two reservations were established, the Dawes Allotment Act was passed under which communal tribal land was divvied up and allocated to each household in attempt to enforce European-American farming styles where each family owns and works their own plot of land. This was a further act of enclosure by the US government. Each family received 640 acres or less and the remaining land was deemed "surplus" because it was more than the tribes needed. This "surplus" land was then made available for purchase by American citizens.

The land designated to the Navajo and Hopi reservation was originally considered barren and unproductive by white settlers until 1921 when prospectors scoured the land for oil. The mining companies pressured the US government to set up Native American councils on the reservations so that they could agree to contracts, specifically leases, in the name of the tribe.&lt;ref&gt;Mudd, V. (Director). (1985). Broken Rainbow [DVD]. United States: Earthworks Films.&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War II, uranium was mined from their land as well though the companies and government neglected to inform the people of the dangers of radiation exposure. Some people had even built their houses out of mine waste. The companies also failed to properly dispose of the radioactive waste which did and will continue to pollute the environment, including the natives' water sources. Many years later, these same men who worked the mines died from lung cancer and their families received no form of financial compensation.

In 1979, the Church Rock uranium mill spill was the largest release of radioactive waste in US history. The spill contaminated the Puerco River with 1,000 tons of solid radioactive waste and 93 million gallons of acidic, radioactive tailings solution which flowed downstream into the Navajo Nation. The Navajos used the water from this river for irrigation and their livestock but were not immediately informed about the contamination and its danger.&lt;ref&gt;Pasternak, J. (2010). Yellow dirt: An American story of a poisoned land and a people betrayed. New York, NY: Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war ended, the American population boomed and energy demands soared. The utility companies needed a new source of power so they began the construction of coal-fired power plants. They placed these power plants in the four corners region. In the 1960s, John Boyden, an attorney working for both Peabody Coal and the Hopi tribe, the nation's largest coal producer,  managed to gain rights to the Hopi land, including Black Mesa, a sacred location to both tribes which lay partially within the Joint Use Area of both tribes.

This case is an example of environmental racism and injustice, per the principles established by the Participants of the First National People of Color Environmental Leadership Summit,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Environmental Justice|journal = Annual Review of Environment and Resources|volume = 34|pages = 405–430|last=Mohai|first=Paul|last2=Pellow|first2=David|date=2009-10-15|language=en|doi=10.1146/annurev-environ-082508-094348|last3=Roberts|first3=J. Timmons}}&lt;/ref&gt; because the Navajo and Hopi people, which are communities of color, low income, and political alienation, were disproportionately affected by the proximity and resulting pollution of these power plants which disregard their right to clean air, their land was degraded, and because the related public policies are not based on mutual respect of all people.

The mining companies wanted more land but the joint ownership of the land made negotiations difficult. At the same time, Hopi and Navajo tribes were squabbling over land rights while Navajo livestock continuously grazed on Hopi land. Boyden took advantage of this situation, presenting it to the House Subcommittee on Indian Affairs claiming that if the government did not step in and do something, a bloody war would ensue between the tribes. Congressmen agreed to pass the Navajo-Hopi Land Settlement Act of 1974 which forced any Hopi and Navajo people living on the other's land to relocate. This affected 6,000 Navajo people and ultimately benefitted coal companies the most who could now more easily access the disputed land. Instead of using military violence to deal with those who refused to move, the government passed what became known as the Bennett Freeze to encourage the people to leave. The Bennett Freeze banned 1.5 million acres of Navajo land from any type of development, including paving roadways and even roof repair. This was meant to be a temporary incentive to push tribe negotiations but lasted over forty years until 2009 when President Obama lifted the moratorium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://congress.gov/|title=Congress.gov {{!}} Library of Congress|website=congress.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the legacy of the Bennett Freeze looms over the region as seen by the nearly third world conditions on the reservation - seventy-five per cent of people do not have access to electricity and housing situations are poor.

==Gambling==
{{Main|Native American gaming}}
In 1979, the Seminole tribe in [[Florida]] opened a high-stakes [[Bingo (US)|bingo]] operation on its reservation in Florida. The state attempted to close the operation down but was stopped in the courts. In the 1980s, the case of ''[[California v. Cabazon Band|California v. Cabazon Band of Mission Indians]]'' established the right of reservations to operate other forms of gambling operations. In 1988, Congress passed the [[Indian Gaming Regulatory Act]], which recognized the right of Native American tribes to establish gambling and gaming facilities on their reservations as long as the states in which they are located have some form of legalized gambling.

Today, many Native American casinos are used as [[tourism|tourist]] attractions, including as the basis for hotel and conference facilities, to draw visitors and revenue to reservations.  Successful gaming operations on some reservations have greatly increased the economic wealth of some tribes, enabling their investment to improve infrastructure, education and health for their people.

==Law enforcement and crime==
Serious crime on Indian reservations has historically been required (by the 1885 [[Major Crimes Act]], 18 U.S.C. §§1153, 3242, and court decisions) to be investigated by the federal government, usually the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], and prosecuted by [[United States Attorney]]s of the [[United States federal judicial district]] in which the reservation lies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usccr.gov/pubs/sac/sd0300/ch2.htm |title=Native Americans in South Dakota: An Erosion of Confidence in the Justice System |publisher=Usccr.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Department of Justice recognizes the unique legal relationship that the United States has with federally recognized tribes. As one aspect of this relationship, in much of Indian Country, the Justice Department alone has the authority to seek a conviction that carries an appropriate potential sentence when a serious crime has been committed. Our role as the primary prosecutor of serious crimes makes our responsibility to citizens in Indian Country unique and mandatory. Accordingly, public safety in tribal communities is a top priority for the Department of Justice.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Emphasis was placed on improving prosecution of crimes involving domestic violence and sexual assault.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov/dag/dag-memo-indian-country.html "MEMORANDUM FOR UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS WITH DISTRICTS CONTAINING INDIAN COUNTRY"] Memorandum by David W.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Passed in 1953, Public Law 280 (PL 280) gave jurisdiction over criminal offenses involving Indians in Indian Country to certain States and allowed other States to assume jurisdiction. Subsequent legislation allowed States to retrocede jurisdiction, which has occurred in some areas. Some PL 280 reservations have experienced jurisdictional confusion, tribal discontent, and litigation, compounded by the lack of data on crime rates and law enforcement response.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/nij/pubs-sum/209839.htm "Public Law 280 and Law Enforcement in Indian Country – Research Priorities December 2005"], accessed August 12, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Institute for Transportation and Development Policy''' ('''ITDP''') is a [[non-governmental organization|non-governmental]] [[non-profit]] organization that focuses on developing [[bus rapid transit|bus rapid transit (BRT)]] systems, promoting biking, walking, and non-motorized transport, and improving private bus operators margins.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.itdp.org/what-we-do/ ITDP: Our Program Areas]&lt;/ref&gt;  Other programs include parking reform, [[transportation demand management|traffic demand management]], and global climate and transport policy. According to its mission statement, ITDP is committed to "promoting sustainable and equitable transportation worldwide."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1999"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itdp.org |title=ITDP Website |publisher=Itdp.org |date=1999-02-22 |accessdate=2014-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to its role supporting and consulting local governmental efforts to develop more sustainable transportation, ITDP publishes the magazine ''Sustainable Transport'' annually, produces the [[BRT Standard]] and other research, and sits on the committee for the annual [[Sustainable Transport Award]]. 

==Overview==
ITDP was founded in 1985 by [[Michael Replogle]] and other [[sustainable transport]] advocates in the [[United States]] to counteract the spread of costly and [[pollution|environmentally damaging]] car-centric urban development models, and to promote biking, walking, and public transit in [[transportation planning]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.itdp.org/who-we-are/ ITDP: Who We Are]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wnyc.org/news/articles/93794/ "Former Mayor of Bogota Stumps for Congestion Pricing"] by Matthew Schuerman, ''WNYC'', Feb 18, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reiner1989"&gt;"Rethinking the auto: Blueprints for a cleaner, greener future" by Michael Reiner, ''Utne Reader'', March/April 1989&lt;/ref&gt;  

In its first ten years, ITDP worked to support and grow local bicycle industries in Haiti, Nicaragua, Mozambique, South Africa, and West Africa. By 1989, ITDP's [[Bikes Not Bombs]] campaign had shipped 10,000 second-hand bicycles to support health and education efforts in Nicaragua and used these to establish a bicycle assembly industry in that country. ITDP advocated for the redirection of lending activity by the [[World Bank]] and other [[multilateralism|multi-lateral]] institutions. Where these global institutions had an exclusive focus on road projects, ITDP worked to open up funding for multi-modal transport solutions.&lt;ref name="reiner1989"/&gt;  ITDP  advocated for sustainable transport initiatives in U.S. transportation policy, influencing the 1991 Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA). Responding to ITDP pressure, the Peace Corps put its volunteers on bicycles rather than motorcycles.

In the early nineties, ITDP helped establish the Transport Sector Task Force, an advisory panel to the [[United States Department of Treasury|US Treasury Department's]] Multi-lateral Development Bank liaison office, to comment on specific transport projects. In its 1994 study "Counting on Cars, Counting Out People" ITDP published a preliminary set of guidelines for reforming the World Bank Transport Sector economic appraisal to make it less biased in favor of motorways.  The report's key recommendation that economic impacts on non-motorized road users be included in the appraisal has been incorporated into [[World Bank]] practice.&lt;ref&gt;Hook, Walter. ''Counting on cars, counting out people: a critique of the World Bank's economic assessment procedures for the transport sector and their environmental implications,'' Institute for Transportation and Development Policy, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

ITDP has offices in seven countries, with projects and relationships in over 100 cities worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pvo.usaid.gov/usaid/pvo.asp?i=384&amp;INCVOLAG=YES&amp;INCSUM=YES&amp;VolagText= |title=USAID PVO Registry |publisher=Pvo.usaid.gov |date=1994-12-21 |accessdate=2014-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 2009, former [[Mayor of Bogotá|mayor]] of [[Bogotá]], [[Colombia]] [[Enrique Peñalosa]], who was instrumental in the establishment of that city's [[TransMilenio]] BRT system, was elected as [[Company president|President]] of the [[Board of Directors]] of ITDP.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[https://go.itdp.org/index.php/news_events/news_detail/enrique_penalosa_elected_itdp_president/ Enrique Peñalosa Elected ITDP President]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/08/magazine/08WWLN-Q4-t.html "Man With a Plan"] by Deborah Solomon, ''New York Times Magazine'', June 8, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter B. Hook]] served as the organizations [[executive director]] from 1993 to 2014. Heather Thompson is ITDP's interim CEO.

==Key areas of operation==

===Public transport===
[[File:Transjakarta Bus on Corridor 2.JPG|thumb|right|A [[TransJakarta]] bus serving Corridor 2 (Harmoni-Pulo Gadung).]]
ITDP works to encourage safe, modern, and efficient public transportation systems in cities worldwide. ITDP is currently active in a design and/or consulting capacity in the [[Bus Rapid Transit|BRT]] programs of [[Ahmedabad]], [[India]]; [[Dar es Salaam]], [[Tanzania]]; [[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]] ([[Rea Vaya]]); [[Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]] ([[TransJakarta]]); [[Guangzhou]], [[Lanzhou]], and [[Yichang]], [[China]]; [[Mexico City]], [[Mexico]], [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], and more.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.itdp.org/what-we-do/public-transport/ ITDP: Current Projects]&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2007, ITDP published the ''Bus Rapid Transit Planning Guide'' along with the [[United Nations Environment Programme]], the [[Deutsche Gesellschaft für Technische Zusammenarbeit]] (GTZ), the [[Hewlett Foundation]], and [[Viva (bus rapid transit)|Viva]]. The guide draws from the extensive [[Bus Rapid Transit|BRT]] design experience of [[Latin America]]n [[public transport planning|transit planners]], and aims to disseminate this information in the US and other countries around the world.&lt;ref name=BRTPG&gt;{{cite web|title=Bus Rapid Transit Planning Guide|url=https://go.itdp.org/display/live/Bus+Rapid+Transit+Planning+Guide|work=ITDP: Institute for Transportation and Development Policy|publisher=Institute for Transportation and Development Policy|accessdate=2014-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The guide is currently available in [[English language|English]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and [[Chinese language|Chinese]], and is free for download in [[.pdf]] format from the ITDP website.&lt;ref name="BRTPG" /&gt;

In addition, ITDP developed the [[BRT Standard]], a design guide and rating system for Bus Rapid Transit systems around the world. The Standard establishes a common definition for BRT and identifies BRT best practices, as well as functioning as a scoring system to allow BRT corridors to be evaluated and recognized for their superior design and management aspects. It uses a systematic method of evaluating BRT systems, rating their quality as "gold, silver, or bronze". Some systems that had been branded as BRT failed to meet even minimal standards distinguishing BRT from regular urban bus service. A related report on BRT in the US&lt;ref name=RGL&gt;{{cite web|title=Recapturing Global Leadership in Bus Rapid Transit: A Survey of Select U.S. Cities|url=https://go.itdp.org/display/live/Recapturing+Global+Leadership+in+Bus+Rapid+Transit%3A+A+Survey+of+Select+U.S.+Cities|work=ITDP: Institute for Transportation and Development Policy|publisher=Institute for Transportation and Development Policy|accessdate=2014-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; noted that "Some American systems reviewed had so few essential characteristics that calling them a BRT system at all does a disservice to efforts to gain broader adoption of BRT in the United States...These systems, with relatively few BRT characteristics, have helped confuse the American public about what exactly constitutes BRT."&lt;ref name="RGL" /&gt;{{rp|34}}

===Cycling and walking===
ITDP encourages urban design that prioritizes human-powered forms of transportation, such as walking, cycling, and the use of rickshaws.  Specifically, ITDP often works with cities to encourage car-free days and bike share programs, create safe streets for pedestrians and cyclists, and provide high-quality bicycles.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.itdp.org/what-we-do/cycling-and-walking/]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Projects-india rickshaw modern-lg.jpg|thumb|right|A modernized [[cycle rickshaw]] in [[Vrindavan]], [[India]]]]

In December 2013 the ITDP published the Bike-Share Planning Guide with the aim "to bridge the divide between developing and developed countries’ experiences with bike-share." The guide is expected to be useful for planning and implementing a [[bike sharing]] system regardless of the location, size, or density of the city. The guide is currently available only in [[English language|English]] and is free for download in [[.pdf]] format from the ITDP website.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.itdp.org/the-bike-share-planning-guide-2/ The Bike-Share Planning Guide, ITDP, {{en icon}}, 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt;

ITDP works with local governments on the expansion and design of bike lanes, and pedestrian networks throughout the city. In [[São Paulo]], [[Brazil]] ITDP assisted in the design of a pilot bicycle path in the neighborhood of [[Butantã (district of São Paulo)|Butantã]].  For the project, ITDP commissioned a report for a 58 kilometer [[frontage road|feeder]] network, which will lead cyclists from adjacent streets and sidewalks to the bicycle path.  The path will pass through a high-visibility corridor of the city, and if successfully implemented could be expanded to surrounding neighborhoods and throughout the city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itdp.org/index.php/projects/detail/sao_paulo_bicycle_planning/ ITDP: São Paulo Bicycle Planning] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091216093536/http://www.itdp.org/index.php/projects/detail/sao_paulo_bicycle_planning/ |date=December 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Past projects have included a redesign of [[India|India's]] traditional [[cycle rickshaw]] in collaboration with local experts, reducing the weight of the vehicles by 30% and adding a [[bicycle gearing|multi-gear]] system to increase efficiency; increasing [[Africa|Africa's]] cycling capacity while bolstering local industry through the establishment of the California Bike Coalition (CBC); and traffic impact and mitigation analysis along with outreach to local interest groups in the [[pedestrianization]] of [[Malioboro Road]] in [[Yogyakarta]], [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Institute for Transportation and Development Policy: Making Bicycling Work for Millions in the Developing World" by Ryan Morris, ''American Cyclist'', Spring 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.itdp.org/news/pedestrianization-yogyakarta-transforming-malioboro | title=Pedestrianization in Yogyakarta:  Transforming the Malioboro One Step at a Time | publisher=ITDP | date=December 1, 2005 | accessdate=2013-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itdp.org/index.php/projects/detail/india_rickshaw_modern/ India Rickshaw Modernization] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091102161820/http://www.itdp.org/index.php/projects/detail/india_rickshaw_modern/ |date=November 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itdp.org/index.php/projects/detail/california_bike/ California Bike Coalition (CBC)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091227100635/http://www.itdp.org/index.php/projects/detail/california_bike/ |date=December 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sustainable urban development===
ITDP works to integrate transport and smart urban design to help remake cities and suburbs into livable spaces that foster economic opportunities, encourage low carbon lifestyles, and attract residents.  This is done through designing environments for cycling and walking, fostering the development of pedestrian and transit based real estate development, and creating policies that help turn cultural and physical spaces into economic assets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itdp.org/index.php/our_work/detail/sustainable_urban_development/ ITDP: Making Cities Desirable Places to Live Again] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228041208/http://www.itdp.org/index.php/our_work/detail/sustainable_urban_development/ |date=December 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In November 2013 ITDP published "The TOD Standard" which elaborates in eight key principles for guiding the implementation of [[transit-oriented development]] (TOD). The guide is available for download in [[.pdf]] format from the ITDP website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TOD Standard|website=https://www.itdp.org/tod-standard/|publisher=ITDP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ITDP has initiated advised on a number of projects in cities around the world. ITDP worked with the [[Mexico City]] [[Mexico city#Elections and government|government]] to provide technical support for the [[urban renewal|revitalization]] of Mexico City's [[Historic center of Mexico City|Historic Center]].  ITDP managed the planning and implementation efforts of the revitalization, in addition to promoting street maintenance and cleanliness, supplementation of public security, and the management and controlling of parking and street vending activity in the area.  ITDP claims that this reorientation of the Historic Center towards pedestrian and transit oriented development will reverse decades of deterioration, attract tourism and investment, and improve air quality in the notoriously polluted city.  Additionally, ITDP participated as part of the team developing Mexico City’s Bicycle Master Plan to design routes that connect to the Historic Center, further integrating multi-modal development of the area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itdp.org/index.php/projects/detail/mexico_city_center/ ITDP: Mexico City Center Revitalization] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091102161840/http://www.itdp.org/index.php/projects/detail/mexico_city_center/ |date=November 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International sustainable transport policy===
ITDP co-founded the [[Partnership_on_Sustainable,_Low_Carbon_Transport|Partnership on Sustainable Low Carbon Transport]] (SLoCaT) in 2009 and through that helped secure in 2012 a $175 billion 10-year commitment from the world's largest multilateral development banks to support sustainable transport, with annual reporting and monitoring. Working with SLoCaT, ITDP helped mainstream sustainable transport strategies in the United Nations' post-2015 development agenda and in discussions of climate change mitigation strategies in the run-up to the 2015 global climate summit in Paris (COP-15). With the University of California Davis, ITDP in 2014 published, A Global High Shift Scenario: Impacts and Potential for More Public Transport, Walking, and Cycling With Lower Car Use, showing how a shift in transport funding to support alternatives to more driving could save over $100 trillion cumulatively for consumers and governments by 2050 while cutting cumulative climate change pollution from urban transport by 25% and improving equity of access to opportunities for the poor. This is available on the ITDP website. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.itdp.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/A-Global-High-Shift-Scenario_WEB.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Isla de la Convalecencia''' ({{literal translation|Island of Convalescence}}), commonly known as simply '''Isla de Convalecencia''' (also spelled ''Isla de Convalescencia'' and sometimes erroneously called ''Isla de Convalencia''), is a small narrow [[river island]] in the [[Pasig River]] in [[Manila]], the Philippines. It is the only island dividing the Pasig River in Manila located between the districts of [[San Miguel, Manila|San Miguel]] on the north bank, and [[Ermita]] and [[Paco, Manila|Paco]] on the south. The island, best known as the location of the [[Hospicio de San Jose]], is administratively part of San Miguel's Barangay 646, Zone 67.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wikimapia.org/21108190/Barangay-646-Zone-67-San-Miguel-Manila |title=Barangay 646, Zone 67, San Miguel, Manila |publisher=[[Wikimapia]] |accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has a total area of approximately {{convert|594|sqm|sqft|sp=us}} and is connected to both sides of the river by the [[Ayala Bridge]].

Although the island is primarily occupied by the orphanage, it also hosts a detachment of the [[Philippine Coast Guard]] that patrols the periphery of the [[Malacañang Palace]] located just northeast of the island on the Pasig River.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/596168/coast-guard-deploy-more-personnel-near-bahay-pangarap?nomobile=1 |title=Coast Guard to deploy more personnel near Bahay Pangarap |publisher=[[Philippine Star]] |accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also houses a small community which includes the 412 children, 64 special needs and 120 elderly residents of the Hospicio de San Jose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hospiciodesanjose.org/hospicio-in-todays-world |title=Hospicio in Today's World |publisher=[[Hospicio de San Jose]] |accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The island's name dates back to the 1830s when the ''Hospicio General'' was built and the island was used principally as a place of recuperation or [[convalescence]] for patients of the Hospital of San Juan de Dios.&lt;ref name="hospicio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philippinestudies.net/ojs/index.php/ps/article/viewFile/1114/1727 |author=Camagay, Maria Luisa T. |title=The Hospicio de San Jose: Institutional Care for Mental Patients |publisher=[[Ateneo de Manila University]] |accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was earlier called '''Isla de San Andres''' (English: Saint Andrew's Island) in honor of Don Andres Blanco Vermudez who owned the island but who later donated it to the San Juan de Dios religious order.&lt;ref name="hospicio"/&gt; Prior to the construction of the orphanage and hospital, the island was the site of two Spanish fortifications known as Bastion de San Rafael and Bastion de San Andres.&lt;ref name="diccionario"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vacNAvRQ-tcC&amp;pg=PA237&amp;lpg=PA237&amp;dq=%22isla+de+convalecencia%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=CN0dxtK9LG&amp;sig=ipwP-cF9FoQZe-a0ewBBQ9K96ng&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Np2CVIKXGuLImAWopoB4&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwBQ |author=Buzeta, Manuel |title=Diccionario Geográfico, Estadístico, Histórico de las Islas Filipinas |publisher=Madrid: Imprenta de J.C. de la Peña |accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bastion de San Rafael located on the island's eastern end had its main gate facing the river with a large wharf made of ''piedra de China'' (granite stones). This structure has since been replaced by the convent hospital built by the San Juan de Dios religious order.&lt;ref name="diccionario"/&gt; On the island's southern portion facing San Fernando de Dilao (now Paco) and Concepción (now part of Ermita) was the Bastion de San Andres. The Hospicio General was originally housed in an old ruined building called ''Petruz'' on the island's western portion. It had a small chapel, two infirmaries and several wards.&lt;ref name="diccionario"/&gt; It was later renamed to Hospicio de San Jose after [[Saint Joseph]], the orphanage's patron saint.&lt;ref name="hospicio"/&gt;

'''John Cabot''' ({{lang-it|Giovanni Caboto}}; c. 1450 – c. 1500) was an [[Italians|Italian]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Frederic C. |first= Lane|date=1978 |title=Storia di Venezia |language= Italian |location= Turin |publisher=Einaudi}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[navigator]] and [[exploration|explorer]], born in the [[Kingdom of Naples]]. His 1497 discovery of the coast of [[North America]] under the commission of [[Henry VII of England]] was the first European exploration of coastal North America since the Norse visits to [[Vinland]] in the eleventh century. 
To mark the celebration of the 500th anniversary of Cabot's expedition, both the Canadian and British governments elected [[Cape Bonavista]], [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], as representing Cabot's first landing site. However, alternative locations have also been proposed.

==Name and origins==
Cabot is known today as ''Giovanni Caboto'' in Italian, as ''Zuan Chabotto'' in [[Venetian language|Venetian]], and as ''John Cabot'' in English. The non-Italian forms are derived from how his name was recorded in related 15th-century documents. In [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] he signed his names as  "Zuan Chabotto", ''Zuan'' being a form of ''[[John (given name)|John]]'' typical to Venice.&lt;ref&gt;Edoardo Giuffrida, "New documents on Giovanni Caboto" in R. Mamoli Zorzi (ed.), ''Attraversare gli Oceani: Da Giovanni Caboto al Canada Multiculturale'' (Venice, 1999), 61. Juliana de Luna, [http://www.s-gabriel.org/names/juliana/16thcvenice.html Names from Sixteenth Century Venice] (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to use this form in England, at least among Italians. He was referred to by his Italian banker in London as 'Giovanni Chabbote', in the only known contemporary document to use this version of his first name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bristol.ac.uk/history/research/cabot.html "Cabot Project"], Bristol Website&lt;/ref&gt;

He was born in Italy, the son of Giulio Caboto and his wife; he had a brother Piero.&lt;ref name="skelton"/&gt; [[Gaeta]] (in the [[Province of Latina]]) and [[Castiglione Chiavarese]] (in the [[Province of Genoa]]) have both been proposed as birthplaces.&lt;ref name="skelton"&gt;{{cite DCB |title = Cabot, John |first= R.A. |last=Skelton |volume=1 |url = http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/cabot_john_1E.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.gianfrancobernabei.it/pdf/caboto.pdf|title=SCHEDA TECNICA DOCUMENTARIO "CABOTO": I CABOTO E IL NUOVO MONDO|language=Italian|format=PDF|access-date=3 June 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722034601/http://www.gianfrancobernabei.it/pdf/caboto.pdf|archive-date=22 July 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}} (''TECHNICAL DOCUMENTARY "CABOTO": I and Catalan origins have been proved to be without foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; The main evidence for Gaeta are records of a Caboto family residing there until the mid-15th century, but ceasing to be traceable after 1443.&lt;ref&gt;Roberto Almagiá, ''Commemorazione di Sebastiano Caboto nel IV centenario della morte'' (Venice, 1958), pp. 37–38. {{it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pedro de Ayala]], the Spanish envoy and Cabot's contemporary in London, described him in a letter to the Spanish Crown in 1498 as "another Genoese like Columbus".&lt;ref name="bris.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bris.ac.uk/Depts/History/Maritime/Sources/1498ayala.htm|title=Pedro de Ayala letter 1498 to the Spanish Crown|work=The Smugglers' City|publisher=Department of Historical Studies, University of Bristol|accessdate=20 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Cabot's son, [[Sebastian Cabot (explorer)|Sebastian]], said his father originally came from [[Genoa]]. In 1476 Cabot was made a citizen of the Republic of Venice, which required a minimum of fifteen years' residency in the city; thus he must have lived in Venice since at least 1461.&lt;ref&gt;J.A. Williamson, ''The Cabot Voyages and Bristol Discovery Under Henry VII'' (Hakluyt Society, Second Series, No. 120, CUP, 1962), pp. 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
[[File:John Cabot house (Venice).jpg|thumb|Giovanni Caboto house in [[Venice]]]]

He may have been born slightly earlier than 1450, which is the approximate date most commonly given for his birth.&lt;ref name="newadvent"/&gt; In 1471 Caboto was accepted into the religious [[confraternity]] of [[St John the Evangelist]]. Since this was one of the city's prestigious confraternities, his acceptance suggests that he was already a respected member of the community.

Following his gaining full Venetian citizenship in 1476, Caboto would have been eligible to engage in maritime trade, including the trade to the eastern Mediterranean that was the source of much of Venice's wealth. He presumably entered this trade shortly thereafter. A 1483 document refers to his selling a slave in [[Crete]] whom he had acquired while in the territories of the Sultan of Egypt, which then comprised most of what is now [[Palestine (region)|Israel,]] [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]].&lt;ref&gt;Giuffrida, "New documents on Giovanni Caboto" pp. 62–3&lt;/ref&gt; This is not sufficient to prove Cabot's later assertion that he had visited [[Mecca]], which he said in 1497 to the Milanese ambassador in London.&lt;ref name="soncino"&gt;[http://www.bris.ac.uk/Depts/History/Maritime/Sources/1497soncino.htm Primary Sources: "Raimondo de Raimondi de Soncino, Milanese Ambassador in England, to Ludovico Maria Sforza, Duke of Milan, 18 December 1497], ''The Smugglers' City'', History Dept., University of Bristol&lt;/ref&gt; In this Mediterranean trade, he may have acquired better knowledge of the origins of the oriental (West Asian) merchandise he would have been dealing in (such as spices and silks) than most Europeans at that time.

"Zuan Cabotto" (i.e. John Cabot) is mentioned in a variety of Venetian records of the 1480s. These indicate that by 1484 he was married to Mattea and already had at least two sons.&lt;ref name="family"&gt;Williamson, ''The Cabot Voyages'', pp. 93, 192–95&lt;/ref&gt; Cabot's sons are Ludovico, [[Sebastian Cabot (explorer)|Sebastian]], and Sancto.&lt;ref name="newadvent"/&gt; The Venetian sources contain references to Cabot's being involved in house building in the city. He may have relied on this experience when seeking work later in Spain as a civil engineer.&lt;ref&gt;Giuffrida, "New documents on Giovanni Caboto," pp. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cabot fugitive.png|thumb|Cabot's travels around Europe, 1488–95, following his escape from Venice]]

Cabot appears to have got into financial trouble in the late 1480s and left Venice as an insolvent debtor by 5 November 1488. He moved to [[Valencia]], Spain, where his creditors attempted to have him arrested by sending a ''lettera di raccomandazione a giustizia'' ("a letter of recommendation to justice") to the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;M. F. Tiepolo, "Documenti Veneziani su Giovanni Caboto", ''Studi Veneziani'', xv (1973), pp. 585–97&lt;/ref&gt; While in Valencia, "John Cabot Montecalunya" (as he is referred to in local documents) proposed plans for improvements to the harbour. These proposals were rejected, however.&lt;ref&gt;M. Balesteros-Gaibrois, "Juan Caboto en España: nueva luz sobre un problema viejo", ''Revista de Indias'', iv (1943), 607–27&lt;/ref&gt; Early in 1494 he moved on to [[Seville]], where he proposed, was contracted to build and, for five months, worked on the construction of a stone bridge over the [[Guadalquivir]] river. This project was abandoned following a decision of the City Council on 24 December 1494.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bris.ac.uk/Depts/History/Maritime/Sources/1494cabotseville.htm "John Cabot in Seville, 1494"], ''The Smugglers' City'', Dept. of History, University of Bristol&lt;/ref&gt; After this Cabot appears to have sought support in Seville and [[Lisbon]] for an Atlantic expedition, before moving to London to seek funding and political support.&lt;ref&gt;Evan T. Jones and Margaret M. Condon, ''[http://www.bristol.ac.uk/history/research/cabot/cabot-and-bristols-age-of-discovery/ Cabot and Bristol's Age of Discovery: The Bristol Discovery Voyages 1480–1508]'' (University of Bristol, Nov. 2016), pp. 23–27.&lt;/ref&gt; He probably reached England in mid-1495.

==Sponsorship==
Like other explorers at those times, including [[Christopher Columbus]], Cabot led an expedition on commission, in his case, England. Cabot planned to depart to the west from a northerly latitude where the longitudes are much closer together, and where, as a result, the voyage would be much shorter.&lt;ref name="virginia"&gt;{{cite web|year=2007|title=The Cabot Dilemma: John Cabot's 1497 Voyage &amp; the Limits of Historiography|publisher=[[University of Virginia]]|accessdate=9 April 2018|last=Derek Croxton|quote=&lt;!--url=http://www.essaysinhistory.com/articles/2012/87--&gt;|url=http://www.essaysinhistory.com/the-cabot-dilemma-john-cabots-1497-voyage-the-limits-of-historiography/|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He still had an expectation of finding an [[Northwest Passage|alternative route]] to China.

Historians had thought that, on arrival in England, Cabot went to Bristol, a major maritime centre, to seek financial backers.&lt;ref name="finance"&gt;[http://ehr.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/CXXI/492/778 Evan T. Jones, "The Matthew of Bristol and the financiers of John Cabot's 1497 voyage to North America", ''English Historical Review'' (2006)]&lt;/ref&gt; This was the only English city to have had a history of undertaking exploratory expeditions into the Atlantic. Cabot's royal patent (issued by the Crown in 1496) stated that all expeditions should be undertaken from Bristol, so his primary financial supporters were probably based in that city.  In any case, it also stipulated that the commerce resulting from any discoveries must be conducted with England alone.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.questia.com/read/4414094/history-of-domestic-and-foreign-commerce-of-the-united The Commercial Policy of England Toward the American Colonies: the Acts of Trade], p. 38; in Emory R. Johnson, T. W. Van Metre, G. G. Huebner, D. S. Hanchett, ''History of Domestic and Foreign Commerce of the United State''s – Vol. 1, [[Carnegie Institution for Science|Carnegie Institution of Washington]], 1915&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 20th century, British historian [[Alwyn Ruddock]] claimed to have found documentation that Cabot went first to London, where he received some financial backing from its Italian community. She suggested one patron was Father Giovanni Antonio de Carbonariis, an [[Augustinian friar]] who was also the deputy to [[Adriano Castellesi]], the papal tax collector. Ruddock suggested that Carbonariis accompanied Cabot's 1498 expedition. She also suggested that the friar, on good terms with the King, introduced the explorer to [[Henry VII of England|King Henry VII]]. Beyond this, Ruddock claimed that Cabot received a loan from an Italian banking house in London. As Ruddock ordered the destruction of all her research notes on her death in 2005, scholars have had to duplicate her research and rediscover documents.&lt;ref&gt;Evan T. Jones, [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/119408885/HTMLSTART "Alwyn Ruddock: John Cabot and the Discovery of America"], ''Historical Research'' Vol 81, Issue 212 (2008), pp. 231–34.&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.bristol.ac.uk/history/research/cabot.html The Cabot Project] was formed at the University of Bristol in 2009 to research Cabot and the Bristol expeditions. Francesco Guidi Bruscoli ([[University of Florence]]) found some of Ruddock's documentation, confirming that Cabot received money in March 1496 from the [[Bardi family]] banking firm of Florence.&lt;ref name="bruscoli"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2281.2012.00597.x | volume=85 | title=John Cabot and his Italian financiers* | year=2012 | journal=Historical Research | pages=372–393 | last1 = Guidi-Bruscoli | first1 = Francesco}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bankers located in London provided fifty ''nobles'' (£16 13s. 4d.) to support Cabot's expedition to "go and find the new land". This payment from the Florentine merchants would have represented a substantial contribution, although it was not enough to completely finance the expedition.&lt;ref name="bruscoli"/&gt;

On 5 March 1496 Henry VII gave Cabot and his three sons [[letters patent]] with the following charge for exploration:
{{quote|text= ...free authority, faculty and power to sail to all parts, regions and coasts of the eastern, western and northern sea, under our banners, flags and ensigns, with five ships or vessels of whatsoever burden and quality they may be, and with so many and with such mariners and men as they may wish to take with them in the said ships, at their own proper costs and charges, to find, discover and investigate whatsoever islands, countries, regions or provinces of heathens and infidels, in whatsoever part of the world placed, which before this time were unknown to all Christians.}}&lt;ref name="newadvent"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bris.ac.uk/Depts/History/Maritime/Sources/1496cabotpatent.htm Primary Sources: "First Letters Patent granted by Henry VII to John Cabot, 5 March 1496"], ''The Smugglers' City'', History Dept., University of Bristol&lt;/ref&gt; Those who received such patents had the right to assign them to third parties for execution.&lt;ref name="finance"/&gt; His sons are believed to have still been minors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DCB|title=Cabot, Sebastian|first=R.A.|last=Skelton|volume=1|url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/cabot_sebastian_1E.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expeditions==
[[File:JohnCabotPlaqueDingleTowerHalifaxNovaScotia.jpg|thumb|John Cabot plaque: John Cabot departing [[Bristol]], [[England]] for [[Atlantic Canada]] (1497), installed at [[Sir Sandford Fleming Park]], [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]]]]

Cabot went to [[Bristol]] to arrange preparations for his voyage. Bristol was the second-largest seaport in [[Kingdom of England|England]]. From 1480 onward it had supplied several expeditions to look for [[Brazil (mythical island)|Hy-Brazil]]. According to [[Celts|Celtic]] legend, this island lay somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, ''The Cabot Voyages'', pp. 187–9&lt;/ref&gt; There was widespread belief among merchants in the port that Bristol men had discovered the island at an earlier date but then lost track of it.&lt;ref name="alwyn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hunter"/&gt; Ruddock had contended in a private 1988 letter to a colleague, Quinn, that she had found evidence in Italian archives that Bristol men had discovered North America pre-1470. As the island was believed to be a source of [[brazilwood]] (from which a valuable red dye could be obtained), merchants had economic incentive to find it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Salazar's account of Bristol's discovery of the Island of Brasil (pre 1476)|url=http://www.bristol.ac.uk/Depts/History/Maritime/Sources/1476brasil.htm|website=The Smuggler's City|publisher=University of Bristol}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First voyage===
Cabot's first voyage was little recorded. A winter 1497/98 letter from John Day (a Bristol merchant) to an addressee believed to be [[Christopher Columbus]] refers briefly to it, but writes mostly about the second, 1497 voyage. He notes, "Since your Lordship wants information relating to the first voyage, here is what happened: he went with one ship, his crew confused him, he was short of supplies and ran into bad weather, and he decided to turn back."&lt;ref name="john day"&gt;[http://www.bris.ac.uk/Depts/History/Maritime/Sources/1497johnday.htm "John Day letter to the Lord Grand Admiral, Winter 1497/8"], ''The Smugglers' City'', Dept. of History, University of Bristol.&lt;/ref&gt; Since Cabot received his royal patent in March 1496, it is believed that he made his first voyage that summer.

===Second voyage===
Information about the 1497 voyage comes mostly from four short letters and an entry in a 1565 [[chronicle]] of the city of Bristol. &lt;!--These appear to be known, old documentation, the basis of Williamson and others' work--&gt; The chronicle entry for 1496/7 says in full:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"This year, on St. John the Baptist's Day [24 June 1497], the land of America was found by the Merchants of Bristow in a shippe of Bristowe, called the Mathew; the which said the ship departed from the port of Bristowe, the second day of May, and came home again the 6th of August next following." –
G.E. Weare, ''Cabot's Discovery of North America,'' (London, 1897), p. 116 &lt;!--Use old source, to show this quote was already in use --&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

What is known as the "John Day letter" provides considerable information about Cabot's second voyage. It was written during the winter of 1497/8 by Bristol merchant John Day (alias Hugh Say of London) to a man who is probably [[Christopher Columbus]].&lt;ref name="john day"/&gt; Day is believed to have been familiar with the key figures of the expedition and thus able to report on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The John Day Letter|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/exploration/john-day.php|publisher=Heritage Newfoundland &amp; Labrador|accessdate=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the lands Cabot had discovered lay west of the meridian laid down in the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], or if he intended to sail further west, Columbus would probably have believed that these voyages challenged his monopoly rights for westward exploration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Woodroffe|first1=Sasha|title=Breaking the Spanish Monopoly in the Caribbean|url=https://www.academia.edu/5128021/BREAKING_THE_SPANISH_MONOPOLY_IN_THE_CARIBBEAN|publisher=Academia|accessdate=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these letters, [[Alwyn Ruddock]] claimed to have found another, written on 10 August 1497 by the London-based bankers of [[Fr. Giovanni Antonio de Carbonariis]]. This letter has yet to be found. From various written comments made by Ruddock, the letter did not appear to contain a detailed account of the voyage.&lt;ref name="quinn"&gt;[http://hdl.handle.net/1983/1274 E.T. Jones, "The Quinn papers: transcripts of correspondence relating to the Bristol discovery voyages to North America in the fifteenth century", p. 16.]. Note: Based on Ruddock's letter to Quinn on 1 May 1992, she thought that the bank was Venetian; Condon and Jones found documentation in August 2010 suggesting this conclusion was incorrect and that it was Florentine.&lt;/ref&gt; Ruddock said the letter contained "new evidence supporting the claim that seamen of Bristol had already discovered land across the ocean before John Cabot's arrival in England."&lt;ref name="alwyn"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jones | first1 = Evan T. | year = | title = Alwyn Ruddock: ''John Cabot and the Discovery of America'' | url = http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/119408885/HTMLSTART | journal = Historical Research | volume = 2007 | issue = | pages = 237–40 | doi=10.1111/j.1468-2281.2007.00422.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; She contended that Bristol seamen had reached North America two decades before Cabot's expedition.&lt;ref name="hunter"&gt;[http://www.douglashunter.ca/douglashunter.ca/readings/Entries/2010/7/11_Rewriting_History__Alwyn_Ruddock_and_John_Cabot.html Douglas Hunter, "Rewriting History: Alwyn Ruddock and John Cabot"], extended July 2010 version of article by same name published in ''Canada's History'', April 2010; accessed 24 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The known sources do not concur on all aspects of the events, and none can be assumed to be entirely reliable. Cabot was described as having one "little ship",&lt;ref name="soncino"/&gt; of 50 tons burden, called the ''[[Matthew (ship)|Matthew]] of Bristol'' (according to the 1565 chronicle). It was said to be laden with sufficient supplies for "seven or eight months".&lt;ref name="john day"/&gt; The ship departed in May with a crew of 18&lt;ref name="soncino"/&gt; to 20 men.&lt;ref name="john day"/&gt; They included an unnamed Burgundian (modern- day Netherlands) and a Genoese barber,&lt;ref name="soncino"/&gt; who presumably accompanied the expedition as the ship's surgeon.

It is likely that two ranking Bristol merchants were part of the expedition.&lt;ref name="soncino"/&gt; One was probably [[William Weston (explorer)|William Weston]], who had not been identified as part of Cabot's expedition before the find of a new document in the late 20th century. His participation was confirmed by a document found in the early 21st century noting his reward from the King in January 1498 after the ship returned. More importantly, in 2009 historian Evan Jones confirmed that Weston had undertaken an independent voyage to the New Found Land in 1499, probably under Cabot's patent, as the first Englishman to lead an expedition to North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=John Cabot was not Bristol's only explorer|url=http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/john-cabot-bristol-s-explorer/story-11239202-detail/story.html|accessdate=13 September 2016|work=Bristol Post|date=28 August 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908095237/http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/John-Cabot-Bristol-s-explorer/story-11239202-detail/story.html|archivedate=8 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leaving Bristol, the expedition sailed past Ireland and across the Atlantic, making landfall somewhere on the coast of North America on 24 June 1497. The exact location of the landfall has long been disputed, with different communities vying for the honor. Historians have proposed [[Bonavista, Newfoundland|Cape Bonavista]] and [[St. John's, Newfoundland|St. John's]] (present-day [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]); [[Cape Breton Island]] (Nova Scotia);&lt;ref name="virginia"/&gt; as well as [[Labrador]] (Canada) and [[Maine]] (United States) as possibilities. Since the discovery of the "John Day letter" in the 1950s, it seems most likely that the initial landfall was either on Newfoundland or Cape Breton Island. This is because Day's letter implies that the coastline explored in 1497 lay between the latitudes of Bordeaux, France and Dursey Head in southern Ireland. The initial landfall seems to have taken place close to the southern latitude, with the expedition returning home after reaching the northern one.&lt;ref&gt;Evan T. Jones and Margaret M. Condon, ''[http://www.bristol.ac.uk/history/research/cabot/cabot-and-bristols-age-of-discovery/ Cabot and Bristol's Age of Discovery: The Bristol Discovery Voyages 1480–1508]'' (University of Bristol, 2016), pp. 43–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1497 voyage.png|thumb|Route of 1497 voyage posited by Jones and Condon.]]

For the 500th-anniversary celebrations, the governments of Canada and the United Kingdom designated [[Cape Bonavista]] in Newfoundland as the "official" landing place. Here in 1997 Queen Elizabeth II, along with members of the Italian and Canadian governments, greeted the replica ''Matthew'' of Bristol, following its celebratory crossing of the Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;[[Republic of Venice|Lion of Saint Mark]], given by [[Regione Veneto]] to the city of [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]], Nova Scotia, for the 500th year from the arrival of John Cabot: http://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Datei:Halifay_-_NS_-_Giovanni_Caboto_Gedenktafel.jpg&amp;filetimestamp=20081107221453&lt;/ref&gt;

Cabot is reported to have landed only once during the expedition and did not advance "beyond the shooting distance of a crossbow".&lt;ref name="john day"/&gt; Pasqualigo and Day both state that the expedition made no contact with any native people; crew found the remains of a fire, a human trail, nets and a wooden tool. The crew appeared to have remained on land just long enough to take on fresh water; they also raised the Venetian and Papal banners, claiming the land for the King of England and recognising the religious authority of the Roman Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;P. D'Epiro, M.D. Pinkowish, "Sprezzatura: 50 Ways Italian Genius Shaped the World" pp. 179–180&lt;/ref&gt; After this landing, Cabot spent some weeks "discovering the coast," with most "discovered after turning back."&lt;ref name="john day"/&gt;

===Final voyage===
[[File:Matthew-BristolHarbour-Aug2004.jpg|thumb|A replica of the ''[[Matthew (ship)|Matthew]]'' in [[Bristol]]]]

On return to Bristol, Cabot rode to London to report to the King. On 10 August 1497, he was given a reward of £10 – equivalent to about two years' pay for an ordinary labourer or craftsman.&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, ''The Cabot Voyages'', p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; The explorer was feted; Soncino wrote on 23 August that Cabot "is called the Great Admiral [note: as Christopher Columbus had been] and vast honour is paid to him and he goes dressed in silk, and these English run after him like mad".&lt;ref name="soncino"/&gt; Such adulation was short-lived, for over the next few months the King's attention was occupied by the [[Second Cornish Uprising of 1497]], led by [[Perkin Warbeck]]. Once Henry's throne was secure, he gave more thought to Cabot. On 26 September, just a few days after the collapse of the revolt, the King made an award of £2 to Cabot.&lt;ref&gt;Evan T. Jones, 'Bristol, Cabot and the New Found Land, 1496–1500' in P.E. Pope and S. Lewis-Simpson (eds.), [https://boydellandbrewer.com/exploring-atlantic-transitions-hb.html ''Exploring Atlantic Transitions: Archaeologies of Permanence and Transience in New Found Lands''] (Boydell and Brewer, 2013), pp. 29–30.&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1497 the explorer was awarded a pension of £20 per year. On February 3, 1498 he was given new letters patent covering the voyage&lt;ref&gt;[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/15th_century/cabot01.asp The Letters Patents of King Henry the Seventh Granted unto Iohn Cabot and his Three Sonnes, Lewis, Sebastian and Sancius for the Discouerie of New and Unknowen Lands], February 3, 1498 from [[Avalon Project]]&lt;/ref&gt; and to help him prepare a second expedition.&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, ''The Cabot Voyages'', pp. 217–19, 226–7&lt;/ref&gt; In March and April, the King also advanced a number of loans to Lancelot Thirkill of London, Thomas Bradley and John Cair, who were to accompany Cabot's new expedition.&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, ''The Cabot Voyages'', pp. 214–15&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Great Chronicle of London]]'' (1189–1512) reports that Cabot departed with a fleet of five ships from Bristol at the beginning of May 1498, one of which had been prepared by the King. Some of the ships were said to be carrying merchandise, including cloth, caps, lace points and other "trifles".&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, ''The Cabot Voyages'', pp. 220–23&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that Cabot intended to engage in trade on this expedition. The Spanish envoy in London reported in July that one of the ships had been caught in a storm and been forced to land in Ireland, but that Cabot and the other four ships had continued on.&lt;ref name="bris.ac.uk"/&gt;

For centuries no other records were found (or at least published) that relate to this expedition; it was long believed that Cabot and his fleet were lost at sea. But at least one of the men scheduled to accompany the expedition, Lancelot Thirkill of London, is recorded as living in London in 1501.&lt;ref&gt;Williamson (1962), ''The Cabot Voyages'', pp. 92–4&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not known if Cabot died during the voyage, or returned safely and died shortly after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=di Alberto Magnaghi |url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/giovanni-e-sebastiano-caboto_(Enciclopedia-Italiana)/ |title=CABOTO, Giovanni e Sebastiano in "Enciclopedia Italiana" |publisher=Treccani.it |date= |accessdate=2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:La Cosa map North Atlantic (1500).png|thumb|Juan de La Cosa's map of the North Atlantic, 1500]]

The historian [[Alwyn Ruddock]] worked on Cabot and his era for 35 years. She suggested that Cabot and his expedition successfully returned to England in the spring of 1500. She claimed their return followed an epic two-year exploration of the east coast of North America, south into the Chesapeake Bay area and perhaps as far as the Spanish territories in the Caribbean. Her evidence included the well-known world map of the Spanish cartographer [[Juan de la Cosa]]. His chart included the North American coast and seas 'discovered by the English' between 1497 and 1500.&lt;ref&gt;Evan T. Jones and Margaret M. Condon, ''[http://www.bristol.ac.uk/history/research/cabot/cabot-and-bristols-age-of-discovery/ Cabot and Bristol's Age of Discovery: The Bristol Discovery Voyages 1480–1508]'' (University of Bristol, Nov. 2016), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruddock suggested [[Fr. Giovanni Antonio de Carbonariis]] and the other friars who accompanied the 1498 expedition had stayed in Newfoundland and founded a mission. If Carbonariis founded a settlement in North America, it would have been the first Christian settlement on the continent, and may have included a church, the only medieval church to have been built there.&lt;ref name="jones"&gt;Evan T. Jones (2008), [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/119408885/HTMLSTART "Alwyn Ruddock: ''John Cabot and the Discovery of America'' "], first published online 5 April 2007, ''Historical Research'', Volume 81, Issue 212, May 2008, pp. 242–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cabot Project at the [[University of Bristol]] was organized in 2009 to search for the evidence on which Ruddock's claims rest, as well as to undertake related studies of Cabot and his expeditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bristol.ac.uk/history/research/cabot.html "The Cabot Project"], University of Bristol, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The lead researchers on the project, Evan Jones and Margaret Condon, claim to have found further evidence to support aspects of Ruddock's case, including some of the information she intended to use to argue for a successful return of the 1498 expedition to Bristol. These appear to place John Cabot in London by May 1500, albeit Jones and Condon have yet to publish their documentation.

The Project is collaborating on an archaeological excavation at the community of [[Carbonear]], Newfoundland, located at Conception Bay and believed the likely location for Carbonariis' mission settlement. The Archaeology of Historic Carbonear Project, carried out by [[Memorial University of Newfoundland]], has conducted summer fieldwork each season since 2011. So far, it has found evidence of planter habitation since the late 17th century and of trade with Spain through [[Bilbao]], including a Spanish coin minted in [[Peru]].&lt;ref name="provarch"&gt;[http://www.tcii.gov.nl.ca/pao/newsletters/pdf/Vol12-2013.pdf Peter E.

==Additional English voyages==
Ruddock claimed that [[William Weston (explorer)|William Weston]] of Bristol, a supporter of Cabot, undertook an independent expedition to North America in 1499, sailing north from Newfoundland up to the [[Hudson Strait]].&lt;ref name="jones"/&gt; If correct, this was probably the first [[North West Passage]] expedition. In 2009, Jones confirmed that William Weston (who was not previously known to have been involved) led an expedition from Bristol [with royal support] to the "[[Newfoundland|new found land]]" in 1499 or 1500, making him the first Englishman to lead exploration of North America. This find has changed the understanding of English roles in exploration of that continent.&lt;ref name="henry7"&gt;Evan T. Jones, [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/122579649/HTMLSTART "Henry VII and the Bristol expeditions to North America: the Condon documents"], ''Historical Research'', 27 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Evan T. Jones and M. M. Condon, "Weston, William (d. in or before 1505)", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography,'' Oxford University Press, May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

King Henry VII continued to support exploration from Bristol. The king granted Hugh Eliot, Robert Thorne and his son a bounty of ₤20 in January 1502 for purchasing the ''Gabriel'', a ship for an expedition voyage that summer. Later in 1502 or early 1503 he paid Eliot a reward of ₤100 for a voyage, or voyages, in "2 ships to the Isle of new finding," as Newfoundland was called. This amount was larger than any previously accounted for in royal support of the explorations.&lt;ref name="henry7"/&gt;

==Family==
Cabot married Mattea around 1470, and had issue including three sons:
* Ludovico Caboto
* [[Sebastian Cabot (explorer)|Sebastiano Caboto]] 
* Santo Caboto

==Sebastian Cabot's voyages==
{{main|Sebastian Cabot (explorer)}}
[[Sebastian Cabot (explorer)|Sebastian Cabot]], one of John's sons, also became an explorer, later making at least one voyage to North America. In 1508 he was searching for the [[Northwest Passage]]. Nearly two decades later, he sailed to South America for Spain to repeat [[Ferdinand Magellan]]'s voyage around the world. He became diverted by searching for silver along the [[Río de la Plata]] (1525–8) in Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cutler|first1=Miriam|title=Buenos Aires Street Guide|date=2011|publisher=LibrosEnRed|isbn=9781597546539|page=16|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=93hqjQsnoVcC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16#v=onepage&amp;q=Sebastian%20Cabot%20silver%20Argentina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2044">'''Julius Honorius''', also known as '''Julius Orator''', a teacher of geography during [[Late Antiquity]].

He is known only by a single work, ''Cosmographia'', which is a set of notes he had written down by one of his students while he lectured about a world map (''sphaera''), and by references to this work by later writers such as [[Cassiodorus]]. The importance of the ''Cosmographia'' is that it is one of very few geographical works of this period in which any reliance can be placed. A number of variant manuscripts exist, which have been studied by Nicolet &amp; Gautier Dalché. The only (relatively) modern print version was as one of a collection of fragmentary texts published by Riese.&lt;ref&gt;See bibliography. Riese's work employs a very complex annotation system to bring together for comparison manuscripts which may differ very significantly.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nothing else is known of his life, and even the date of the ''Cosmographia'' is not known with certainty. The reference by [[Cassiodorus]]&lt;ref&gt;''Institutiones divinarum et saecularium litterarum'', 25.&lt;/ref&gt; puts it prior to the mid 6th century. The most recent study, by [[Yves Modéran|Modéran]], suggests a late 4th century date.&lt;ref&gt;[[Yves Modéran]], ''Les Maures et l'Afrique Romaine (IVe-VIIe siècle)'', Ecole Française de Rome, 2003, pp. 85-93 ({{ISBN|2-7283-0640-0}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

An attempt to reconstruct the ''sphaera'' was made by Kubitschek.&lt;ref&gt;W. Kubitschek, "Die Erdtafel des Julius Honorius", ''Wiener Studien'' v. 7 (1885) 1-24 &amp; 278-310&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Common physical and anthropogenic causes of coastal land loss.png|thumb|Summary table of the common physical and anthropogenic causes of coastal land loss.&lt;ref name="Morton2003"/&gt;]]
'''Land loss''' is the term typically used to refer to the conversion of coastal land to open water by natural processes and human activities. The term ''land loss'' includes [[coastal erosion]]. It is much broader term than coastal erosion because land loss also includes land converted to open water around the edges of estuaries and interior bays and lakes and by subsidence of coastal plain wetlands. The most important causes of land loss in coastal plains are [[erosion]], inadequate sediment supply to [[beach]]es and [[wetland]]s, [[subsidence]], and global [[sea level rise]].The mixture of processes responsible for most of the land loss will vary occurring the specific part of a coastal plain being examined.&lt;ref name="Morton2003"&gt;Morton, R.A., 2003. [https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2003/of03-337/landloss.pdf ''An overview of coastal land loss: with emphasis on the Southeastern United States.''] ''Open-File report 03-337. US Geological Survey'', Center for Coastal and Watershed Studies, St. Petersburg, Florida. 28 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BritschOthers1990a"&gt;Britsch, L.D. and Kemp III, E.B., 1990. ''Land loss rates: Mississippi River deltaic plain. Technical Report no. WES/TR/GL-90-2''. Geotechnical Lab, Army Waterways Experiment Station, Vicksburg, Mississippi.&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of and loss does not include the loss of coastal lands to agriculture, urbanization, or other development.&lt;ref name="BarrasOthers1993"&gt;Barras, J.A., P.E. Bourgeois, and L.R. Handley. 1994. ''Land loss in coastal Louisiana 1956-90.'' ''National Biological Survey, National Wetlands Research Center Open File Report 94-01.'' 4 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although seemingly related, [[wetland]] loss, is defined differently than land loss. Commonly, '''wetland loss''' is defined as the conversion of vegetated wetlands into either uplands or drained areas; nonvegetated wetlands (e.g., mudflats); or (submerged habitats (open water). According to this, and similar definitions, wetland loss includes both land loss and [[land consumption]] as components of it. In historic times, both wetland and land loss typically are the result of a varying, often controversial mixture of natural and anthropogenic factors.&lt;ref name="BoeschOthers1994a"&gt;Boesch, D.F., Josselyn, M.N., Mehta, A.J., Morris, J.T., Nuttle, W.K., Simenstad, C.A. and Swift, D.J., 1994. ''Scientific assessment of coastal wetland loss, restoration and management in Louisiana. '' ''Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 20'', pp.1-103.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ChanOthers2007a"&gt;Chan, A.W. and Zoback, M.D., 2007. ''The role of hydrocarbon production on land subsidence and fault reactivation in the Louisiana coastal zone.'' ''Journal of Coastal Research'', 23(3) pp.771-786.&lt;/ref&gt; There are other definitions of wetland loss commonly used. For example, some researchers defined wetland loss as "the substantial removal of wetland from its ecologic role under natural conditions."&lt;ref name="CraigOthers1979a"&gt;Craig, N.J., Turner, R.E. and Day, J.W., 1979. Land loss in coastal Louisiana (USA). Environmental Management, 3(2), pp.133-144.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Land loss and deltas ==
Because of a highly variable combination of [[sea level rise]], sediment starvation, coastal erosion, wetland deterioration, various types of [[subsidence]], and various human activities, land loss within delta plains is a significant global problem.&lt;ref name="Morton2003"/&gt; The large delta plains of the world, including the [[Danube Delta|Danube]], [[Ganges Delta|Ganges]], [[Ganges Delta|Brahmaputra]], [[Indus River Delta|Indus]], [[Mahanadi River Delta|Mahanadi]], [[Mangoky River|Mangoky]], [[Mackenzie Bay, Canada|McKenzie]], [[Mississippi River Delta|Mississippi]], [[Niger Delta|Niger]], [[Nile Delta|Nile]], [[Shatt el Arab]], [[Volga Delta|Volga]], [[Yellow River|Yellow]], [[Yukon–Kuskokwim Delta|Yukon]], and [[Zambezi]] deltas, have all suffered significant land loss as the result of either coastal erosion, internal conversion of wetlands to open water, or a combination of both. For the 15 deltas studied by Coleman and others,&lt;ref name="ColemanOthers2008"&gt;Coleman, J.M., Huh, O.K. and Braud Jr, D., 2008. ''Wetland loss in world deltas.'' ''Journal of Coastal Research, '' 24(sp1), pp. 1-14.&lt;/ref&gt; these deltas experienced a total irreversible land loss of {{convert|5,104|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of wetlands between the early 1980s and 2002. During this period, the total average land loss for all of these deltas was about {{convert|41|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} per year. In case of the Mississippi River Delta, they found that in a 12-year period, some {{convert|253|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of wetlands had been converted to new open water at a rate of {{convert|21|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} per year.&lt;ref name="ColemanOthers2008"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3535">'''Leaf mold''' ('''Leaf mould''' outside of the United States) is  the product of slow decomposition of deciduous [[shrub]] and [[tree]] leaves. It is a form of [[compost]] produced primarily by fungal breakdown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://compost.css.cornell.edu/microorg.html Compost organisms]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Leaves shed in autumn tend to have a very low nitrogen content and are often dry. Their main constituents are [[cellulose]] and [[lignin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://compost.css.cornell.edu/chemistry.html|title= Compost Chemistry|publisher= Cornell University|access-date=6 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, autumn leaves break down far more slowly than most other compost ingredients with very little bacterial decomposition involved.

==Time and process==
Fungal decomposition of a heap of leaves in the open can take between one and two years to break down into a dark brown  fine powdery [[humus|humic]] matter. During the two to three years that the process takes to complete in damp temperate climates, a succession of different fungal species may be involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/ismej/journal/v7/n3/full/ismej2012116a.html|title=Fungal community on decomposing leaf litter undergoes rapid successional changes|author1=Jana Voříšková1|author2=Petr Baldrian|journal=The ISME Journal|access-date=7 October 2016|date= 11 October 2012|volume=7|issue=3|doi=10.1038/ismej.2012.116|pages=477–486|pmc=3578564}}&lt;/ref&gt; A range of micro fauna are also involved in converting the leaf material into a fine-grained humus, including many [[isopods]], [[millipede]]s, [[earthworms]], etc.

==Uses==
In the natural environment the slow decomposition of leaves provides a moist growing medium for young plants and also protects the ground from drying out during periods of low rainfall. It is a significant component of [[soil organic matter]], particularly in temperate deciduous woodland. The slow rate of decomposition allows the plant nutrients bound up in the leaves to be released slowly back into the environment where they can be re-used by plants. Autumn leaves are often collected as part of  gardening or farming and  kept in pits or containers so that the leaf mold can be used in the garden. The presence of oxygen from the air and sufficient moisture are essential for leaf decomposition. Leaf mold is not high in nutrient content, but it is excellent humic [[soil conditioner]]  because of its ability to retain moisture and provide a good growing medium for seedling roots. 
Leaves collected off roads and pavements may be contaminated by pollutants which can become more concentrated as the leaves decompose into a smaller volume &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/291575/LIT_8942_4547cc.pdf|publisher=The Environment Agency|access-date=6 October 2016|title=Leaf litter in street sweepings: investigation into collection and treatment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of China|expanded=United Front}}
[[China]], officially the People's Republic of China, is formally a [[multi-party state]] under the leadership of the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) in a [[United Front (China)|United Front]] similar to the [[popular front]]s of former [[Communist bloc|Communist-era]] [[Warsaw Pact|Eastern European countries]] such as the [[National Front (East Germany)|National Front of Democratic Germany]].

Under the [[one country, two systems]] scheme, the [[Special administrative regions of China|special administrative regions]] of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], which were previously [[European colonialism|colonies of European powers]], operate under a different political system to the rest of China. Currently, both [[List of political parties in Hong Kong|Hong Kong]] and [[List of political parties in Macau|Macau]] possess multi-party systems.&lt;ref name="Buckley"&gt;Buckley, Roger (1997). ''Hong Kong: The Road to 1997''. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-46979-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationships with the Communist Party ==
In practice, only one political party holds effective power at the national level, namely the CPC. Its dominance is such that China is effectively a [[one-party state]]. Eight minor parties are part of the United Front and also take part in the political system, but they have limited power on a national level and are almost completely subservient to the CPC as they must accept the "leading role" of the CPC as a condition of their continued existence. The Chinese political system allows for the participation of some non-CPC members and minor parties in the [[National People's Congress]] (NPC), but they are vetted by the CPC. The [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China|Constitution of China]] states in the preamble: "The system of the multi-party cooperation and political consultation led by the Communist Party of China will exist and develop for a long time to come".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npc.gov.cn/englishnpc/Constitution/2007-11/15/content_1372962.htm|title=The National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China|website=npc.gov.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although opposition parties are not formally banned in China, the CPC maintains control over the political system in several ways.

First, only the people's congresses/assemblies up to the county level (or district under a municipality) are subject to direct popular vote. Even such a lower-level direct election can be highly controlled or managed by the CPC and higher level governmental bodies. Above the county level, one people's congress appoints the members of the next higher congress. This means that although independent members can theoretically and occasionally in practice get elected to county-level people's congresses, it is impossible for them to organize to the point where they can elect members above the county level without the approval of the CPC or to exercise oversight over executive positions at the lowest level in the hierarchy. This lack of effective power also discourages outsiders from contesting the people's congress elections even at the lowest level.

Second, although [[Chinese law]] has no formal provision for banning a non-religious organization, it also has no provision which would give non-CPC political parties any corporate status. This means that a hypothetical opposition party would have no legal means to collect funds or own property in the name of the party. More importantly, Chinese law also has a wide range of offenses which can and have been used against the leaders of efforts to form an opposition party such as the [[Democracy Party of China]] and against members of organizations that the CPC sees as threatening its power.&lt;ref name="Gittings"&gt;Gittings, John. ''The Changing Face of China: From Mao to Market''. (2005).  Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-280612-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldsmith"&gt;Goldsmith, Jack L. and  Wu, Tim (2006). ''Who Controls the Internet?: Illusions of a Borderless World''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-515266-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These include the crimes of [[subversion]], [[sedition]] and revealing [[Classified information|state secrets]]. Moreover, the control that the CPC has over the legislative and judicial processes means that the party can author legislation that targets a particular group.

Third, Article 1 of the Constitution defines China as a "[[people's democratic dictatorship]]" with "the socialist system" as its "basic system". It explicitly forbids "sabotage of the socialist system by any individual or organization".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.people.cn/constitution/constitution.html|title=Constitution of China|work=People's Daily Online|accessdate=28 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Suppressed parties ===
The following parties have been and are currently suppressed in China. Due to censorship and suppression, they most likely have their headquarters outside the Chinese mainland.
* The [[Democracy Party of China]] ({{zh|s=中国民主党}}) was founded by participants of the 1978 [[Democracy Wall|Chinese Democracy Wall Movement]] and the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|1989 Democracy Movement]]. Founded in 1998, it was declared illegal that same year.&lt;ref name="Gittings"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldsmith"/&gt;
* The [[New Democracy Party of China]] ({{zh|s=中国新民党}}) was founded by [[Guo Quan]] in Nanjing at the end of 2007.&lt;ref name="Gittings"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldsmith"/&gt;
* The [[Union of Chinese Nationalists]] ({{zh|s=中国泛蓝联盟}}) aspires to the ideals of the [[Pan-Blue Coalition]] on [[Republic of China|Taiwan]]. As such, its values include establishing a [[liberal democracy]] in accordance with the [[Three Principles of the People]]. The group originated from an internet forum discussion in August 2004 and was declared to be an illegal organization in September 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chinese Pan-Blue Alliance Members Arrested|work=Epoch Times|date=18 February 2008|url=http://en.epochtimes.com/news/8-2-18/66195.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Zhi Xian Party]] ({{zh|s=至宪党}}), also known as the Chinese Constitutionalist Party in English. Founded by the supporters of [[Bo Xilai]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moore|first=Malcolm|title=Former teacher names Bo Xilai chairman of 'new political party'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/10439094/Former-teacher-names-Bo-Xilai-chairman-of-new-political-party.html|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/bo-xilai-supporters-name-disgraced-politician-chairman-for-life-of-new-political-party-in-china/article15368221/|title=Bo Xilai supporters launch new political party in China|author=Benjamin Kang Lim and Ben Blanchard|work=The Globe and Mail|location=Toronto|date=9 November 2013|accessdate=10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2013 and banned in December of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/hengshao/2013/12/17/bizarre-china-report-the-grand-wedding-power-play-smog-inspired-creativity/|title=Bizarre China Report: The Grand Wedding, Power Play &amp; Smog-Inspired Creativity|first=Heng|last=Shao|work=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/zh/北京民政局发出取缔至宪党决定/a-17296892|title=北京民政局发出取缔“至宪党”决定|date=14 December 2013|publisher=Deutsche Welle|accessdate=28 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Chinese Communist Party(Marxist-Leninist) ({{zh|s=中国共产党（马列）}})  is an [[anti-revisionist]] [[communist party]] founded on 1976 by some Rebel Faction of [[Red Guard]] leader like Chi and Hu in Wuhan, [[Hubei]]. They believed it was illegal to arrest the [[Gang of Four]] and the new leadership of [[Communist Party of China|CPC]] is revisionist and unlawful. They were suppressed after the attempts of Armed Revolt were also failed in Shanghai and Yunnan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Su |first1=Yuan |title=1978-1979: Diary |date=2017 |publisher=China Cultural Communication Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Maoist Communist Party of China]] ({{zh|s=中国毛泽东主义共产党}}) is an [[anti-revisionist]] [[communist party]] founded on 2008. The party seeks to initiate a "second [[socialist revolution]]" to re-establish the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]]. It has been subject to crackdowns by the Chinese government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/mar/20/world/la-fg-china-maoists-20120320|title=China puts a stop to Maoist revival|first=Barbara|last=Demick|date=20 March 2012|work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Chinese Proletarian Revolutionary Central Committee ({{zh|s=中国无产阶级革命中央委员会}}, abbreviated {{zh|s=中革中央}}) is an anti-revisionist communist party founded in 2010s by Zhou Qun ({{zh|s=周群}}). The party leaders were numbers of rebel faction ({{zh|s=造反派}}) during the [[Cultural Revolution]] and the committee core consisted of dozens of [[laid-off]] ({{zh|s=大下岗}}) workers in [[Jiangsu]], but it was suppressed after the police found their "provocative" online activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.zhihu.com/question/22687207/answer/173694556|title=Zhihu|website=zhihu.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sun Yat Sen together with the members of the Singapore Branch of Tongmen Hui.png|thumb|[[Sun Yat-sen]] together with the members of the Singapore branch of the [[Tongmenghui]]]]
The [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] (ROC) was founded by the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) leader Dr. [[Sun Yat-sen]] in 1912. The Kuomintang's prior revolutionary political group, the [[Revive China Society]], was founded on 24 November 1894. It later merged with various other revolutionary groups to form the [[Tongmenghui]] in 1905. In August 1911, the Tongmenghui further merged with various other political parties i]n Beijing to form the KMT. In July 1914, the KMT re-organized itself as the Chinese Revolutionary Party  in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]]. In 1919, the party officially renamed itself as [[Kuomintang]] of China, which literally translates to Chinese Nationalist Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kmt.org.tw//hc.aspx?id=27|title=- 中國國民黨全球資訊網 KMT Official Webstie|website=中國國民黨全球資訊網}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was China's first major political party.  In 1921, the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) was founded by [[Chen Duxiu]] and [[Li Dazhao]] in [[Shanghai]] as a study society and an informal network. Slowly, the CPC began to grow. These were the two major political parties in China during the time when the ROC ruled [[mainland China]] from 1911 to 1949.

During the [[Chinese Civil War]], under the leadership of the CPC the [[People's Liberation Army]] defeated the [[National Revolutionary Army]] of the Kuomintang in 1949. The Kuomintang had no choice but to leave mainland China and move to the island of [[Taiwan]] in 1945 from Japan, then fled there with the aim to retake mainland China and retained the name Republic of China even though the CPC claimed that it had ceased to exist after 1949.

A '''mixed-grass prairie''' is an [[ecotone]] located between the [[tallgrass prairie]]s and [[shortgrass prairie]]s. The mixed-grass prairie is richer in ecological diversity than either the tall- or shortgrass prairie. The mixed-grass prairie occurs in the central portion of the [[Great Plains]], varying in width from central Texas in the United States up into southeastern [[Manitoba]], [[Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan]] in [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;G.

The '''Numa Numa Trail''' is a [[trail]] on [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]] in [[Papua New Guinea]] that runs from [[Numa Numa, Papua New Guinea|Numa Numa]] on the east coast over the central mountains of Bougainville to [[Torokina]] on the western coast.

The trail was central to the Torokina [[All round defence|perimeter defence]] during the initial phases of the [[Bougainville campaign]] during [[World War II]] with a number of battles fought along the trail.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44907">A [[fishery]] is an area with an associated [[fish]] or [[Aquatic animal|aquatic]] population which is harvested for its commercial value. Fisheries can be [[Wild fisheries|wild]] or [[Fish farm|farmed]]. Most of the world's wild fisheries are in the [[ocean]]. This article is an overview of '''ocean fisheries'''.

==Statistics==
Oceans occupy 71 percent of the Earth's surface. They are divided into five major oceans, which in decreasing order of size are: the [[Pacific Ocean]], [[Atlantic Ocean]], [[Indian Ocean]], [[Southern Ocean]], and [[Arctic Ocean]]. Over 70 percent of the world catch from the sea comes from the Pacific Ocean.

| [[File:Pacific Ocean.png|right|thumb]]
The [[Pacific Ocean]] is the largest of the world's oceans, extending from the [[Arctic]] in the north to [[Antarctica]] in the south. Covering 169.2 million square kilometers, it is larger than all of the Earth's land area combined.&lt;ref name=ebc&gt;"[http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9374340/Pacific-Ocean Pacific Ocean]".  ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica|Britannica Concise]].'' 2006. Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Pacific contains 25,000 [[Pacific islands|islands]] (over half the islands in the world), most of which are south of the [[equator]].

The Pacific's greatest asset is its fish. The shoreline waters of the continents and the more temperate islands yield [[herring]], [[salmon]], [[sardine]]s, [[Lutjanidae|snapper]], [[swordfish]], and [[tuna]], as well as [[shellfish]].

The [[Celebes Sea]] has warm clear waters and harbors about 580 of the world's 793 species of reef-building [[coral]]s, which grow as some of the most bio-diverse coral reefs in the world, and an impressive array of  marine life, including [[whale]]s and [[dolphin]]s, [[sea turtle]]s, [[manta ray]]s, [[eagle ray]]s, [[barracuda]], [[marlin]] and other reef and [[pelagic]] species. [[Tuna]] and [[yellow fin tuna]] are  also abundant. The sea also yields other aquatic products like sea tang.

The [[South China Sea]] is the repository of large sediment volumes delivered by the [[Mekong River]], [[Red River (Vietnam)|Red River]] and [[Pearl River (China)|Pearl River]]. Within the sea, there are over 200 identified islands and reefs, including a 100&amp;nbsp;km wide [[seamount]] with a depth of 20 m and an area of 8,866&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. According to studies made by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, Philippines, this body of water holds one third of the all world's marine biodiversity, thereby making it a very important area for the ecosystem.

The [[Atlantic Ocean]] is the second-largest ocean covering 106.4 million square kilometres with a coastline of 111,000 kilometres. It occupies about one-fifth of the Earth's surface.

The ocean has some of the world's richest fishing resources, especially in the waters covering the shelves. The major species of fish caught are [[cod]], [[haddock]], [[hake]], [[herring]], and [[mackerel]]. The most productive areas include the [[Grand Banks]] of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], the shelf area off [[Nova Scotia]], [[Georges Bank]] off [[Cape Cod]], the Bahama Banks, the waters around Iceland, the [[Irish Sea]], the [[Dogger Bank]] of the North Sea, and the Falkland Banks. [[Eel]], [[lobster]], and [[whale]]s have also been taken in great quantities. Because of the threats to the ocean environment presented by oil spills, [[marine debris]], and the incineration of toxic wastes at sea, various international treaties exist to reduce some forms of pollution.

The [[Baltic Sea]]. Approximately 100,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of the Baltic's seafloor (a quarter of its total area) is a variable dead zone. The more saline (and therefore denser) water remains on the bottom, isolating it from surface waters and the atmosphere.  This leads to decreased oxygen concentrations within the zone.  It is mainly bacteria that grow in it, digesting organic material and releasing hydrogen sulfide.  Because of this large anaerobic zone, the seafloor ecology differs from that of the neighbouring Atlantic.
:The low salinity of the Baltic sea has led to the evolution of many slightly divergent species, such as the Baltic Sea [[herring]], which is a smaller variant of the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] herring. The [[benthos|benthic fauna]] consists mainly of ''[[Monoporeia affinis]]'', which is originally a freshwater species. The lack of [[tides]] has affected the marine species as compared with the Atlantic.

The [[Caribbean Sea]] is home to about 29% of the world's [[coral reef]]s. Currently, unusually warm Caribbean waters are endangering the Caribbean coral reefs. Coral reefs support some of the most diverse habitats in the world, but are fragile ecosystems. When tropical waters exceed 85 degrees Fahrenheit for an extended period of time, microscopic plants called [[zooxanthellae]] die off. These plant provide food for the coral and give them their color. The resultant bleaching of the coral reefs kills them, and ruins the ecosystem. Up to 42% of the coral colonies have gone completely white, while 95% have undergone at least some bleaching.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/11/03/ap/tech/mainD8DKNQH80.shtml Bleaching Threatens Caribbean Coral Reefs]. CBS News. URL accessed on April 29, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  The habitats supported by the reefs are critical to such tourist activities such as [[fishing]] and [[Underwater diving|diving]], and provide an annual economic value to Caribbean nations of $3.1-$4.6 billion. Continued destruction of the reefs could severely damage the region's economy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3679332.stm Alarm sounded for Caribbean coral]. BBC News. URL accessed on April 29, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; A ''Protocol of the Convention for the Protection and Development of the Marine Environment of the Wider Caribbean Region'' came in effect in 1986 to protect the various endangered marine life of the Caribbean through forbidding human activities that would advance the continued destruction of such marine life in various areas. Currently this protocol has been [[ratified]] by 15 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/international/spaw.htm Protocol Concerning Specially Protected Areas and Wildlife to the Convention for the Protection and Development of the Marine Environment of the Wider Caribbean Region (SPAW)] NOAA Fisheries:

The [[Gulf of Mexico]]. The outer margins of the wide continental shelves of Yucatán and Florida receive cooler, [[nutrient]]-enriched waters from the deep by a process known as [[upwelling]], which stimulates plankton growth in the [[euphotic zone]]. This attracts fish, shrimp, and squid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/rrg07 | title=GULF OF MEXICO | work=Handbook of Texas Online | publisher=Texas State Historical Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; River drainage and atmospheric fallout from industrial coastal cities also provide nutrients to the coastal zone.

:The [[Gulf Stream]], a warm Atlantic Ocean current and one of the strongest [[ocean current]]s known, originates in the gulf, as a continuation of the [[Caribbean Current]]-Yucatán Current-[[Loop Current]] system. Other circulation features include the anticyclonic [[gyre]]s which are shed by the [[Loop Current]] and travel westward where they eventually dissipate, and a permanent cyclonic [[gyre]] in the [[Bay of Campeche]]. The [[Bay of Campeche]] in Mexico constitutes a major arm of the Gulf of Mexico.  Additionally, the gulf's shoreline is fringed by numerous bays and smaller inlets. A number of rivers empty into the gulf, most notably the [[Mississippi River]] in the northern gulf, and the [[Grijalva River|Grijalva]] and [[Usumacinta]] Rivers in the southern gulf. The land that forms the gulf's coast, including many long, narrow barrier islands, is almost uniformly low-lying and is characterized by marshes and swamps as well as stretches of sandy beach.

:The Gulf of Mexico is an excellent example of a [[passive margin]].  The [[continental shelf]] is quite wide at most points along the coast, most notably at the Florida and [[Yucatán Peninsula]]s. An important commercial activity is fishing; major catches include [[Lutjanus campechanus|red snapper]], [[amberjack]], [[tilefish]], [[swordfish]], and various [[grouper]], as well as [[shrimp]] and [[crabs]].  [[Oysters]] are also harvested on a large scale from many of the bays and sounds.

| [[File:Mediterranean Relief.jpg|thumb|left]]
The [[Mediterranean Sea]]. Being nearly landlocked affects the Mediterranean Sea's properties; for instance, [[tide]]s are very limited as a result of the narrow connection with the Atlantic [[Ocean]]. [[Evaporation]] greatly exceeds [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] and river runoff in the Mediterranean, a fact that is central to the water circulation within the basin.&lt;ref&gt;Pinet, Paul R. (1996) Invitation to Oceanography, St Paul, MN: West Publishing Co., (3rd ed.), p.202&lt;/ref&gt; Evaporation is especially high in its eastern half, causing the water level to decrease and [[salinity]] to increase eastward.&lt;ref&gt;Pinet, p. 206&lt;/ref&gt; This pressure gradient pushes relatively cool, low-salinity water from the Atlantic across the basin; it warms and becomes saltier as it travels east, then sinks in the region of the [[Levant]] and circulates westward, to spill over the Strait of Gibraltar.&lt;ref&gt;Pinet, pp. 206–7&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, seawater flow is eastward in the Strait's surface waters, and westward below; once in the Atlantic, this chemically-distinct "Mediterranean Intermediate Water" can persist thousands of kilometers away from its source.&lt;ref&gt;Pinet, p. 207&lt;/ref&gt;

:The Mediterranean Sea has an average depth of 1,500 metres (4,920 ft) and the deepest recorded point is 5,267 meters (about 3.27 miles). The coastline extends for {{convert|46,000|km|mi}}.

:Invasive species originating from the Red Sea and [[introduced species|introduced]] into the Mediterranean by the construction of the [[Suez canal]] have become a major component of the Mediterranean ecosystem and have serious impacts on the Mediterranean ecology, endangering many local and [[endemism|endemic]] Mediterranean species. Up to this day, about 300 species native to the Red Sea have already been identified in the Mediterranean Sea, and there are probably others yet unidentified. In recent years, the Egyptian government's announcement of its intentions to deepen and widen the canal have raised concerns from [[marine biologist]]s, fearing that such an act will only worsen the invasion of Red Sea species into the Mediterranean, facilitating the crossing of the canal for yet additional species.&lt;ref&gt;Galil, B.S. and Zenetos, A. (2002). A sea change: exotics in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, in: Leppäkoski, E. et al. (2002). ''Invasive aquatic species of Europe: distribution, impacts and management''. pp. 325-336.
&lt;/ref&gt;

:Pollution in this region has been extremely high in recent years. The [[United Nations Environment Programme]] has estimated that 650 million tons of [[sewage]], 129,000 tons of [[mineral oil]], 60,000 tons of mercury, 3,800 tons of lead and 36,000 tons of phosphates are dumped into the Mediterranean each year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.explorecrete.com/nature/mediterranean.html&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Barcelona Convention]] aims to 'reduce pollution in the Mediterranean Sea and protect and improve the marine environment in the area, thereby contributing to its sustainable development.'&lt;ref&gt;http://europa.eu/scadplus/leg/en/lvb/l28084.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Many marine species have been almost wiped out because of the sea's pollution. The [[Mediterranean monk seal]] is considered to be among the world's most [[endangered]] [[marine mammal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.monachus-guardian.org/factfiles/medit01.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mediterranean is also plagued by [[marine debris]]. A 1994 study of the [[seabed]] using trawl nets around the coasts of Spain, France and Italy reported a particularly high mean concentration of debris; an average of 1,935 items per square kilometre. Plastic debris accounted for 76%, of which 94% was plastic bags.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unep.org/regionalseas/marinelitter/publications/docs/anl_oview.pdf |title=Marine Litter: An analytical overview |accessdate=2008-08-01 |date=2005 |publisher=United Nations Environment Programme }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Fishing in the North Sea}}
The [[North Sea]]. A large part of the European [[drainage basin]] empties into the North Sea including water from the [[Baltic Sea]]. Fishing in the North Sea is concentrated in the southern part of the coastal waters. The main method of fishing is [[trawling]]. Annual catches grew each year until the 1980s, when a high point of more than 3 million metric tons (3.3&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;S/T) was reached. Since then, the numbers have fallen back to around 2.3 million tons (2.5&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;S/T) annually with considerable differences between years. Besides the fish caught, it is estimated that 150,000&amp;nbsp;metric&amp;nbsp;tons (165,000&amp;nbsp;S/T) of unmarketable [[by-catch]] are caught and around 85,000&amp;nbsp;metric&amp;nbsp;tons (94,000&amp;nbsp;S/T) of dead and injured [[invertebrate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| [[File:Norwegian Sea map.png|thumb|left]]
The [[Norwegian Sea]]. In the Norwegian Sea and Greenland Sea, surface water descends two to three kilometres down to the bottom of the ocean, forming cold, oxygen-rich groundwater.  As a result, there is a warm surface [[ocean current|current]] and a cold depth current running along the west coast of Norway. The so-called [[East Iceland Current]] transports cold water south from the Norwegian Sea towards Iceland and then east, along the [[Arctic Circle]]. In the [[Norwegian Current]], a branch of the [[Gulf Stream]] carries warm water masses northward and contributes to the mild and moist climate in Norway.  The Norwegian Sea is the source of much of the [[North Atlantic Deep Water]]. The region remains ice-free due to the warm and [[salinity|saline]] Norwegian Atlantic Current.  It provides rich [[fishing]] grounds, with catches mostly consisting of cod, herrings, sardines and anchovies.  Nowadays, shifts and fluctuations in these currents are closely monitored, as they are thought to be indicators for an ongoing [[climate change]].

* The [[Indian Ocean]] is the third largest ocean, covering 73,556,000 square kilometres, or about twenty percent of the water on the Earth's surface. Small islands dot the continental rims.

The ocean's continental shelves are narrow, averaging {{convert|200|km|mi}} in width. An exception is found off Australia's western coast, where the shelf width exceeds {{convert|1,000|km|mi}}. The average depth of the ocean is 3,890 metres (12,760 feet).  The remaining 14% is layered with [[terrigenous]] sediments. Glacial outwash dominates the extreme southern latitudes.

The warmth of the ''Indian Ocean'' keeps [[plankton|phytoplankton]] production low, except along the northern fringes and in a few scattered spots elsewhere; life in the ocean is thus limited. [[Fishing]] is confined to subsistence levels. Its fish are of great and growing importance to the bordering countries for domestic consumption and export. Fishing fleets from [[Russia]], [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], and [[Taiwan]] also exploit the Indian Ocean, mainly for [[shrimp]] and [[tuna]]. Endangered marine species include the [[dugong]], [[seal (mammal)|seal]]s, [[turtle]]s, and [[whale]]s. Oil and ship [[pollution]] threatens the [[Arabian Sea]], [[Persian Gulf]], and [[Red Sea]].

The [[Great Australian Bight]] is a large [[bight (geography)|bight]], or open bay located off the central and western portions of the southern coastline of mainland [[Australia]].

The coast line of the Great Australian Bight is characterised by stunning cliff faces (up to 60 m high), surfing beaches and rock platforms, ideal for whale-watching. The waters of the Great Australian Bight, despite being relatively shallow, are not fertile. While most [[continental shelf|continental shelves]] are rich in sea life and make popular [[fishing]] areas, the barren [[desert]]s north of the bight have very little rainfall, and what there is mostly flows inland, to dissipate underground or in [[salt lake (geography)|salt lake]]s. In consequence, the Great Australian Bight receives very little of the runoff that fertilises most continental shelves and is essentially a marine desert. It is probably best noted for the large number of [[shark]]s that frequent its coastal waters, as well as the increasing numbers of [[Right whale|southern right whales]] that migrate within the region.

Economically, the Bight has been exploited over many years as part of the fishing, whaling and shellfish industries. [[Southern bluefin tuna|Bluefin tuna]] have been a favoured target of fishing in the Bight.

It is 2250&amp;nbsp;km long and, at its widest point, 355&amp;nbsp;km wide. It has a maximum depth of 2211 m in the central median trench and an average depth of 490 m (1,608 feet ), but there are also extensive shallow shelves, noted for their marine life and [[coral]]s. The sea is the habitat of over 1,000 [[invertebrate]] species and 200 soft and hard corals and is [[the world's most northern]] tropical sea.

The Red Sea is a rich and diverse [[ecosystem]]. More than [[Fish of the Red Sea|1100 species of fish]]&lt;ref name="fishbase"&gt;FishBase. Ed. Ranier Froese and Daniel Pauly&lt;/ref&gt; have been recorded in the Red Sea, and around 10% of these are found nowhere else.&lt;ref&gt;Siliotti, A. (2002) ''fishes of the red sea'' Verona, Geodia {{ISBN|88-87177-42-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also includes around 75 species of [[List of deep water fish of the Red Sea|deepwater fish]].&lt;ref name="fishbase"/&gt; The rich diversity is in part due to the {{convert|2000|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} of [[coral reef]] extending along its [[coastline]]; these [[fringing reef]]s are 5000–7000 years old and are largely formed of stony [[acropora]] and [[porites]] corals.

The [[Southern Ocean]] is the fourth-largest ocean, covering 20,327,000 square kilometers. It is typically between 4,000 and 5,000 meters deep with only limited areas of shallow water. The [[Antarctic continental shelf]] is narrow and unusually deep, its edge lying at up to 800 meters, compared to a global mean of 133 meters.

The [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]] moves perpetually eastward &amp;mdash; chasing and joining itself, and at 21,000 kilometers is the world's longest ocean current, transporting 130 million cubic meters per second &amp;mdash; 100 times the flow of all the world's rivers. The Antarctic ice pack fluctuates from an average minimum of 2.6 million square kilometers in March to about 18.8 million square kilometers in September.

Fauna: [[squid]], [[whale]]s, [[seal (mammal)|seals]], [[krill]], various [[fish]]

Increased solar [[ultraviolet|ultraviolet radiation]] resulting from the Antarctic [[ozone hole]] has reduced marine primary productivity ([[phytoplankton]]) by as much as 15% and has started damaging the [[DNA]] of some fish{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. Illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, especially the landing of an estimated five to six times more [[Patagonian toothfish]] than the regulated fishery, likely affects the sustainability of the stock. Long-line fishing for toothfish causes a high incidence of seabird mortality.

The [[International Whaling Commission]] prohibits commercial [[whaling]] south of [[40th parallel south|40 degrees south]] (south of [[60th parallel south|60 degrees south]] between [[50th meridian west|50 degrees]] and [[130th meridian west|130 degrees west]]). [[Japan]] does not recognize this and they carry out an annual whale-hunt which they say is for scientific research. See [[Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary]]. The [[Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals]] has limited seal-hunting. The [[Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources]] regulates fishing in the region.

The [[Ross Sea]] is a deep [[Headlands and bays|bay]] of the [[Southern Ocean]] in [[Antarctica]] between [[Victoria Land]] and [[Marie Byrd Land]].  The southern part is covered by the [[Ross Ice Shelf]]. In the west of the Ross sea, [[McMurdo Sound]] is a port which is usually free of ice during the summer.

A 10-metre (32.8&amp;nbsp;feet) long [[colossal squid]] weighing 495 kilograms (1,091&amp;nbsp;lb) was captured in the Ross Sea on 22 February 2007.

;The Ross Sea toothfish fishery
There are two main species of toothfish:
the [[Patagonian toothfish]], ''Dissostichus
eleginoides'', which occurs mainly in
Subantarctic waters, and the [[Antarctic
toothfish]], ''D. mawsoni'', which is found
only in Antarctic waters. The Antarctic
toothfish is caught from the Polar
Convergence (at about 60° S) south
to the Antarctic continent, whereas the
Patagonian toothfish is mainly caught
north of 65° S. The Ross Sea region
is unusual because between these
latitudes both species are abundant
and show considerable overlap in their
distribution. Indeed, over 90% of the
longlines set in the fishery in this area
have both species on the same line.
Both species are found down to depths
of over 2000 m

The Ross Sea toothfish fishery is the southernmost fishery
in the world. The extreme cold and ice conditions can
make fishing both difficult and dangerous. During most
of the year the Ross Sea itself is covered by ice. However,
during January and February, areas of open water (called
[[polyna]]s) allow access to the continental shelf and slope.
Longline vessels (predominantly from New Zealand,
but also from South Africa, Russia, and Uruguay) have
taken advantage of this to develop an exploratory
fishery. They start working in the deep south, and as
the season progresses they move north to stay ahead
of the freezing sea ice, and by May are restricted to
the northernmost fishing grounds. CCAMLR agrees on
annual precautionary catch limits. Since 1998, the catch
has steadily increased from about 40 t to over 1350 t in
2002 (all of these catches are well within the CCAMLR
limits). Because it is a high latitude fishery, Antarctic
toothfish has formed over 95% of the catch. Up to three
New Zealand vessels have been involved in the fishery
in any year. However, in the 2003 season up to six New
Zealand vessels are fishing in these waters.&lt;ref&gt;NZ National Institute of Water &amp; Atmospheric Research (2003) [www.niwa.cri.nz/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/29842/fau-2003-06.pdf ''Fisheries &amp; Aquaculture Update.'']  No 6. Retrieved 2 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

OrthoGraph I has several features that are unique on the market of building surveying applications. The base of a floor plan needs to be drawn first and after measurements the created floor plans will adjust based on the calculations. Diagonal measurements also allow for mathematical accuracy.

The application handles the sketched and measured building-model according to the [[Building information modeling|BIM]] (Building Information Modeling) concept. It means that it handles a hierarchical location-structure, every placed object has several properties, doors and windows have opening directions, and additionally there is the opportunity to add unique parameter fields with optional information.
The system is developed by the Hungarian Company named OrthoGraph.

==Company history==

The story of OrthoGraph goes back to 2004 when the first version of the software was launched for [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]] devices. In 2011, the iPad version of the app was released and this also meant that a new business model has been emerged.
This new version was a major breakthrough both in technological and in business aspects. The company’s gathered experience had been a good background for developing the iPad application, so from the very first moment, the OrthoGraph became one of the top professional building surveying /CAD application on the market.

In 2013, a cooperation agreement has been established between OrthoGraph and Leica, the result of this collaboration was that now several Leica laser distance meter is supported by OrthoGraph, the measurements can be transferred to the app via Bluetooth connection.

In the second half of the year, the company decided to exploit the benefits of the mobile technology and the Internet and created their own [[Cloud computing|cloud]] services. This new technology has made it possible that the first building surveying software that provides the opportunity of real teamwork was born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Laszlo|first1=Toth|title=OrthoGraph Cloud Introduced|url=http://orthograph.blogspot.hu/2013/11/orthograph-cloud-introduced-try-it-for.html|website=orthograph.blogspot.hu|publisher=OrthoGraph Blog|accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same year, the Bluetooth support of the Bosch GLM 100 C laser distance meter for OrthoGraph became available.
For 2014, the number of  OrthoGraph users reached 4,500. In August 2014, the OrthoGraph Architect App has been named the gold winner in App of the Year category and silver winner in the Most Innovative Product of the Year—SMB category in Best in Biz Awards 2014 International business awards program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Frausto-Robledo|first1=Anthony|title=OrthoGraph wins Best in Biz|url=http://architosh.com/2014/07/orthograph-wins-best-in-biz-award-for-app-of-the-year/|website=architosh.com|publisher=Architosch|accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 the main goal for OrthoGraph was to be present on Android. After one and a half year on September 2016 the multiplatform version of the app was published, which was called OrthoGraph I. The completely changed UI was simpler, the features were more advanced to allow more accurate measurements and a faster work process. After 2 months of the release, OrthoGraph I won silver qualification in the "Best New Version of the Year" category of Best in Biz Awards 2016.

'''Pozsony county''' was an administrative county ([[Comitatus (Kingdom of Hungary)|comitatus]]) of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. Its territory lies in present-day western [[Slovakia]].

Its name changed along with that of the city of [[Pressburg]] ({{lang-hu|Pozsony}}, today's [[Bratislava]]). Its names around 1900 were ''Pozsony [[vármegye]]'' in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], ''Prešpurská [[župa]]'' in [[Slovak language|Slovak]] and ''Preßburger [[Gespanschaft]]'' in German.

==Geography==
[[Image:Pozsony county map.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Pozsony county]]
The county shared borders with the [[Austria]]n land of [[Lower Austria]] and the Hungarian counties [[Nyitra county|Nyitra]], [[Komárom county|Komárom]], [[Győr (county)|Győr]] and [[Moson]]. It was situated between the river [[Morava (river)|Morava]] in the west, the river [[Danube]] in the south, and the river [[Váh]] ({{lang-hu|Vág}}) in the east. The southern part of the [[Little Carpathians]] divided the county into two. It also covered most of the island known today as [[Žitný ostrov]] (Hungarian: ''Csallóköz'') between the Danube and the [[Little Danube]]. Its area was 4,370&amp;nbsp;km² around 1910.

==Seats==
The seats of Pozsony county were the Pozsony Castle (present-day [[Bratislava Castle]]) and Somorja (present-day [[Šamorín]]), and from the 18th century onwards the town of [[Pressburg]].

==History==
A sort of predecessor to Pozsony county existed as early as the 9th century during the time of [[Great Moravia]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} After Pozsony county's territory had become part of the Kingdom of Hungary, the Hungarian comitatus was created around 1000 or even earlier. It was one of the first counties created in the Kingdom of Hungary. Its territory comprised roughly both the present-day [[Bratislava Region]] and [[Trnava Region]]. Throughout its history it was among the most prosperous territories of Hungary, and until the late 18th century it was particularly advanced and prosperous. In the 18th and 19th century, the population consisted of [[Slovaks]] (mainly in the north and in the suburbs of Pressburg{{efn|In 1900: present-day [[Lamač]], [[Dúbravka, Bratislava|Dúbravka]], [[Záhorská Bystrica]] - more than 93% of the population, present-day [[Vajnory]] (93 %) and [[Rača]] (75 %).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Moderná humánna geografia mesta Bratislava: priestorové štruktúry, siete a procesy |trans-title=Modern Human Geography of Bratislava: spatial structures, networks and processes | editor1-first = Ján | editor1-last = Buček | editor2-first = Korec | editor2-last = Pavol | pages = 60-61 | publisher = Univerzita Komenského, Prírodovedecká fakulta Katedra humánnej geografie a demografie | location = Bratislava | year = 2013 | isbn =  978-80-223-3516-4 | url = http://www.humannageografia.sk/stiahnutie/03_bleha_kol.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}, [[Hungarians]] (mainly in the south, some suburbs of Pressburg{{efn|In 1900: particularly present-day [[Podunajské Biskupice]] and [[Vrakuňa]] (cca 90 %)}}, [[Germans]] (mainly in Pressburg and larger towns) and [[Croats]] (mainly in the suburbs of Pressburg).

In the aftermath of [[World War I]], most of Pozsony county became part of newly formed Czechoslovakia, as recognized by the concerned states in 1920 by the [[Treaty of Trianon]]. As Bratislava county, it continued to exist until 1927 in [[Czechoslovakia]], but it had completely different powers and somewhat modified borders. A small part south of the river [[Danube]] remained part of Hungary and joined [[Győr_County#History|Győr-Moson-Pozsony]] county.

Following the provisions of the [[First Vienna Award]], the southeastern part of the area (Žitný ostrov, Senec, Galanta) became part of Hungary again in November 1938. The approximate Trianon borders were restored after World War II.

The '''Purling Brook Falls''' or sometimes incorrectly '''Purlingbrook Falls''', a [[Waterfall#Types|horsetail waterfall]] on the Purling Brook, is located in the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Area|World Heritage]]{{endash}}listed [[Gondwana Rainforests]] in the [[South East Queensland|South East]] region of [[Queensland]], [[Australia]].

==Location and features==
The Purling Brook Falls are situated within the central section of [[Springbrook National Park]] as part of the Shield Volcano Group, at [[Springbrook, Queensland|Springbrook]] which is part of the [[Gold Coast hinterland]], south-west of [[Surfers Paradise, Queensland|Surfers Paradise]].

After heavy rains the falling waters creates a spectacle that attracts large numbers of tourists. At these times the danger from falling rocks during [[landslide]]s can be hazardous so barricades are erected to prevent walking along tracks that pass the base of the falls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldcoast.com.au/article/2008/06/07/12187_gold-coast-feature.html|title=Walkers flirt with danger to visit falls|author= |accessdate=17 July 2009|date=7 June 2008|work=goldcoast.com.au |publisher=Gold Coast Publications }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
"Qurain" is interchangeable with "Qarn", the Arabic word which roughly corresponds to sandy, flat hillock. The second part of the name, romanized either as "Abu al-Bawl" or "Balboul", was chosen as the hill is thought to represent the shape of a traditional flat-shaped toy known as balboul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qplibrary.com/eLibrary/eLibrary.nsf/4940e2ab96c04a7443257457002b1cc5/fc197fc85f1c6aac43257575002d34a7/$FILE/ATTK5GEQ/Qatar%20Fossils.pdf|title=A fossil hunting guide to the tertiary formations of Qatar, Middle East|author=Jacques LeBlanc|date=March 2008|edition=1st|page=71|accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Shaumari Wildlife Reserve''' is a [[Jordan]]ian [[List of nature reserves in Jordan|nature reserve]] near the town of [[Azraq (Jordan)|Azraq]], approximately {{Convert|100|km|abbr=on}} east of [[Amman]].

It is a regionally important reserve created in 1975 by the [[Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature]] as a breeding center for endangered or locally extinct wildlife. The {{Convert|22|km2|adj=on}} reserve is a thriving protected environment for some of the most threatened species of animals in the Middle East. Some of the species include [[Arabian oryx]], [[Somali ostrich]]es, [[Persian onager]]s (an [[Asian wild ass]] from [[Iran]]) and [[gazelles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.jtb.com.jo/brochures/eco_shumari.html |title= Shaumari Wildlife Reserve |publisher= Jordan Tourism Board |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160303223038/http://www.jtb.com.jo/brochures/eco_shumari.html |archivedate= 2016-03-03 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sortedam Lake''' ({{lang-da|Sortedams Sø}}) is a lake at [[Copenhagen]] in [[Denmark]]. A vertical slope was added in the area in 1929. In September 2012 it was announced that there were plans to build a floating bridge on the lake, and construction material left from digging underground tunnels would be placed on the eastern part of Sortedam in the Østerbrogade (‘Lille Trianglen’) area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=

'''Sätraån''' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]]: "Stream of Sätra") is a [[stream]] in southern [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]].

Previously stretching 6&amp;nbsp;km from [[Västertorp]] and [[Segeltorp]], Sätraån is today confined to the [[Sätra Open-air Area]] and approximately a kilometre long.  The limited current discharge causes the stream to be reduced to minor temporary pools of water except during spring.  Nevertheless, the stream is considered a valuable natural environment because of the ravine it has cut though the landscape and because of its location in a forest of recreational importance to the suburb [[Sätra]].&lt;ref name="vattenprogram-31.1"&gt;Vattenprogram, p 31.1&lt;/ref&gt;

== Catchment area ==
The catchment area, once encompassing a major portion of south-west Stockholm (roughly 11–12&amp;nbsp;km²), is today insignificant and the stream is drained during most of the year.  The inflow was slightly increased in 2002 when a stormwater pipe was modified and a damm was built to treat the water.  The mouth of the stream is located near a public bathe.  Most of the surrounding area is covered by grass and forests with no settlements within the current catchment area.&lt;ref name="Satraan"&gt;Sätraån&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vattenprogram-31.2"&gt;Vattenprogram, p 31.2-3&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environmental influence ===
Notwithstanding the limited extent of the catchment area, the few samples taken in the area showed significant levels of [[phosphorus]], [[nitrogen]], and metals; a situation explained by the inflow of [[groundwater]] from an area larger than suggested by the extent of the watershed.  Samples taken in 2000 showed levels of [[lead]], [[zinc]], and [[copper]] were exceptional in the upper course.&lt;ref name="vattenprogram-31.2" /&gt;

== Flora and fauna ==
Bottom fauna includes some 53 species, typically endurable to nutrient-rich aquatic environments offering stagnant waters and low levels of oxygen - most commonly various species of [[Oligochaeta]] and ''[[Pisidium]]''. An inventory in late 1999 / early 2000 also documented larvae of [[Chironomidae]] flies and ''[[Asellus aquaticus]]'' [[crustacean]]s; A few species of [[beetle]]s and [[Trichoptera|caddisflies]], including species more typical for moist environments such as wetlands and marshes. Also species sensitive to acidification, such as ''[[Gammarus pulex]]'' and ''[[Baera pullata]]'', were recorded.  Near the mouth of the stream various species of [[Mayfly|mayflies]] common to exposed lake shores and running waters were documented.&lt;ref name="vattenprogram-31.2" /&gt;

A [[confluence]], where two or more [[bodies of water]] meet together, usually refers to the joining of tributaries.

The opposite to a tributary is a [[distributary]], a river or stream that branches off from and flows away from the main stream.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physicalgeography.net/physgeoglos/t.html "opposite to a tributary"]. PhysicalGeography.net, Michael Pidwirny &amp; Scott Jones, 2009. Viewed 17 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Distributaries are most often found in [[river delta]]s.

==Terminology==
[[File:Harpers Ferry WV aerial.jpg|right|upright=1.35|thumb|Looking downstream, the [[Shenandoah River]] (bottom right) meets the [[Potomac River]] which flows from bottom left to top right, so the Shenandoah is a right tributary of the Potomac, not a left tributary]]
&lt;!-- ]] and [[Right tributary]] redirect to this section title --&gt;

"Right tributary" and "left tributary" (or "right-bank tributary" and "left-bank tributary") are terms stating the orientation of the tributary relative to the flow of the main stem river. These terms are defined from the perspective of looking downstream (in the direction the [[Current (stream)|water current]] of the main stem is going).&lt;ref name=FS&gt;Bisson, Peter and Wondzell, Steven.

In the United States, where tributaries sometimes have the same name as the river into which they feed, they are called '''forks'''. These are typically designated by compass direction. For example, the [[American River]] receives flow from its North, Middle, and South forks. The [[Chicago River]]'s North Branch has the East, West, and Middle Fork; the South Branch has its South Fork, and used to have a West Fork as well (now filled in).

Forks are sometimes designated as right or left. Here, the "handedness" is from the point of view of an observer facing upstream. For instance, [[Steer Creek (West Virginia)|Steer Creek]] has a left tributary which is called Right Fork Steer Creek.

==Ordering and enumeration==
Tributaries are sometimes listed starting with those nearest to the [[River source|source of the river]] and ending with those nearest to the [[River delta|mouth of the river]]. The [[Strahler Stream Order]] examines the arrangement of tributaries in a [[hierarchy]] of first, second, third, and higher orders, with the first-order tributary being typically the least in size. For example, a second-order tributary would be the result of two or more first-order tributaries combining to form the second-order tributary.&lt;ref name=FS /&gt;

Another method is to list tributaries from mouth to source, in the form of a [[tree structure]], stored as a [[Tree (data structure)|tree]] [[data structure]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

A '''village development committee''' ('''VDC''') ({{lang-ne|गाउँ विकास समिति; ‘’gāun bikās samiti’’}}) in [[Nepal]] was the lower administrative part of its [[Ministry of Federal Affairs and Local Development (Nepal)|Ministry of Federal Affairs and Local Development]]. Each [[List of districts of Nepal|district]] had several VDCs, similar to [[municipality|municipalities]] but with greater public-government interaction and administration. There are currently 3,157 village development committees in Nepal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Village Development Committees (VDCs) in Nepal - list &amp; details • TechSansar.com|url = http://techsansar.com/vdc-nepal-list/|accessdate = 2015-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mofald.gov.np/page.php?id=224 Government of Nepal, Ministry of Federal Affairs and Local Development] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141102093647/http://mofald.gov.np/page.php?id=224 |date=2 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each VDC was further divided into several wards ({{lang-ne|वडा}}) depending on the population of the district; the average being nine wards.

==Purpose==
The purposes of a Munucipality are:

* to organize village people structurally at a local level 
* to create a partnership between the community and the public sector for element of control and responsibility in development 
* to ensure proper use and distribution of state funds 
* to ensure a greater interaction between government officials, [[NGO]]s and agencies&lt;ref name="VDC"&gt;[http://www.scspeb.sdnpk.org/village_development_committee.htm village development committee] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201014059/http://www.scspeb.sdnpk.org/village_development_committee.htm |date=1 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The village development committees, sanitation and income, and will monitor and record progress which is displayed in census data.&lt;ref name="VDC"/&gt;--&gt;

==Organization==
In a VDC, there is one elected chief, usually elected with over an 80% majority.&lt;ref name="VDC"/&gt; From each [[Ward (country subdivision)|ward]], a chief is elected. With these, there are four members elected or nominated.

To keep data and records, and to manage administrative works, there is one village secretary. The position is appointed by the government permanently, from whom they receive a salary. The ward members, ward chief, and VDC chiefs are not paid a salary, but they obtain money according to presence.{{Clarify|date=November 2009}}

VDC is guided from the district development committee, headquarters, and the chief of DDC is a local development officer (LDO).

Population and housing details of VDCs in Nepal are provided by the National Population and Housing Census, in [[1991 Nepal census|1991]], [[2001 Nepal census|2001]] and [[2011 Nepal census|2011]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://mofald.gov.np/userfiles/docs_208.pdf|title = National Population and Housing Census 2011|date = 2011|accessdate = November 2, 2014|website = |publisher = |last = |first = |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131228170018/http://www.mofald.gov.np/userfiles/docs_208.pdf|archive-date = 28 December 2013|dead-url = yes|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dissolution of VDC==
The Village Development Committee (VDC) was dissolved on March 10, 2017 to be replaced by [[Gaunpalika]].&lt;ref name="onlinekhabar"&gt;{{cite news|title=Government announces dissolution of VDCs, birth of village councils|url=http://english.onlinekhabar.com/2017/03/10/397069|accessdate=12 April 2017|agency=Online Khabar}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, [[Panchayat_(Nepal)|panchayat]] was dissolved and turned into VDC by the [[Constitution of Nepal#CONSTITUTION OF THE KINGDOM OF NEPAL, 1990|Constitution of Nepal 1990]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10098">''' World Surfing Reserves''' ('''WSR''') is a program launched in 2009 by the [[non-governmental organization]] Save the Waves Coalition aimed at protecting global surf habitats. The program proactively identifies, designates and enshrines international waves, [[Surfing|surf]] zones and surrounding environments, protecting them from the threat of development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.savethewaves.org/world_surfing_reserves Save The Waves Coalition Website, World Surfing Reserves Home Page]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="How Are World Surfing Reserves Created"&gt;{{cite web|title=How Are World Surfing Reserves Created?|url=http://thelens.surfstitch.com/2015/12/21/how-are-world-surfing-reserves-created/|website=The Lens|accessdate=17 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and mission==

[[File:Huanchaco.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Caballitos de totora]] in [[Huanchaco]] beach sunset]]
[[File:HumedalesHuanchaco1.JPG|thumb|250px|right|[[Swamps of Huanchaco]] is an [[ecological]] [[Chimu]] [[Lands inhabited by indigenous peoples|reserve]], about 14&amp;nbsp;km northwest of the historic center of [[Trujillo, Peru|Trujillo]] city, [[Peru]]. From this ecological reserve the ancient [[Moche (culture)|mochica]] extracted the raw material for the manufacture of the ancient [[Caballitos de totora]] used since the time of the [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] for fishing and [[surfing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year= |url = http://www.revistaveadelperu.com/archivo/2005/vea69/articulos/agonia.htm|title=(spanish) Wetlands of Huanchaco|editor =  |accessdate =29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year= |url = http://www.ambiente-ecologico.com/067-02-2000/manuelniquealvarez67.htm|title=(spanish) Wetlands of Huanchaco|editor =  |accessdate =29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The mission of the WSR program is to gain international recognition and support for wave and coastal protection around the world by creating a global network of designated surfing reserves. WSR also recognizes environmental, social, cultural and economic benefits of waves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.surfingreserves.org/world-reserves.php National Surfing Reserves, Home Page]&lt;/ref&gt;

Leaders in the international surfing, environmental and scientific communities launched WSR at the Value of Waves Roundtable&lt;ref&gt;http://www.savethewaves.org/news/view/56/&lt;/ref&gt; held in [[Half Moon Bay, California]]. WSR was created in conjunction with National Surfing Reserves Australia,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.surfingreserves.org/&lt;/ref&gt; and has established partnerships with the [[International Surfing Association]] (ISA), and Stanford University's Center for Responsible Travel (CREST).&lt;ref name="responsibletravel.org"&gt;http://www.responsibletravel.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

World Surfing Reserves is led by an international executive committee and vision council. It is the responsibility of these groups to govern the program and make the final wave selections. For a specific surf site to enter WSR, the region must have exceptional and consistent surf, along with a rich history and culture of surfing, as well as strong community support.

In August 2009, WSR called for nominations from all national surfing federations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.savethewaves.org/news/view/93 Save The Waves Coalition, World Surfing Reserves Nominations]&lt;/ref&gt; More than 150 sites were nominated from 34 countries. WSR eventually plans to induct 30-40 surf breaks around the world. The program has gained a substantial amount of positive feedback and support from the sport's leaders, including [[Kelly Slater]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.surfermag.com/industry-news/kelly-slater-joins-world-surfing-reserves-movement/ March 15, 2010, ''Surfer Magazine'', "Kelly Slater Joins WSR Movement"]&lt;/ref&gt; You can also read Drew Kampion's ''World Surfing Reserves Manifesto''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.savethewaves.org/news/view/110/&lt;/ref&gt;

==World Surfing Reserves==

There are currently nine surfing reserves across the world.&lt;ref name="World Surfing Reserves"&gt;{{cite web|title=Guarda do Embaú Approved as Next World Surfing Reserve|url=http://www.savethewaves.org/programs/world-surfing-reserves/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malibu===
In partnership with National Surfing Reserves Australia, the [[International Surfing Association]] (ISA), and Stanford University’s Center for Responsible Travel (CREST),&lt;ref name="responsibletravel.org"/&gt; Save The Waves Coalition inducted [[Malibu Lagoon State Beach|Malibu Surfrider Beach]] as the first World Surfing Reserve site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.savethewaves.org/news/malibu-world-surfing-reserve July 22, 2010, "Malibu World Surfing Reserve" World Surfing Reserves Nomination]&lt;/ref&gt; The official enshrinement ceremony took place on October 9, 2010. The date indicated the commencement of the commitment by the local and international communities to protect and preserve Malibu as an iconic surf site.

World Surfing Reserves are nominated through a selection process and there are currently dozens of proposed WSRs covering nearly every continent on the planet.

===Ericeira===
The first World Surfing Reserve in Europe, [[Ericeira]], [[Portugal]] was dedicated on October 14, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ericeira Rides to World Surfing Reserve Fame|url=http://www.worldsurfingreserves.org/ericeira-rides-world-surfing-reserve-fame|website=www.worldsurfingreserves.org|accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ericeira stretches 4&amp;nbsp;km (2.5 miles) and consists of seven separate surf spots, including popular breaks such as Ribeira d’Ilhas and Coxos. Ericeira was recognized for its high density of surf breaks, wave quality, and unique environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Portugal’s big waves are boosting the economy|url=http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/181581/how-portugals-big-waves-are-boosting-the-economy|website=inquirer.net|accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manly-Freshwater===

On 10 March 2012, the four kilometre stretch between [[Freshwater Beach]] and [[Shelly Beach (Manly)|Shelly Beach]] was declared the "Manly-Freshwater World Surfing Reserve".  The reserve was dedicated in a ceremony on [[Manly Beach]] by world surfing champion [[Kelly Slater]] accompanied by the governor of New South Wales, Australia, Professor [[Marie Bashir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.worldsurfingreserves.org/surfing-legend-kelly-slater-launches-aus-wsr| title=Kelly Slater Helps Launch Australian WSR| publisher = World Surfing Reserves |accessdate=2012-03-11 | date=2012-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Santa Cruz===
The World Surfing Reserve dedication for [[Santa Cruz, California]] took place from April 27–28, 2012, and featured a number of events, including a wetsuit fashion show and a paddle out at Pleasure Point. The official ceremony took place out front the Santa Cruz Surfing Museum, where Pat O'Neil from [[O'Neill (brand)|O'Neill wetsuits]] and local officials spoke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Santa Cruz Formally Dedicated|url=http://www.savethewaves.org/news/santa-cruz-formally-dedicated|website=www.savethewaves.org|accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Huanchaco===
[[File:Surfing en caballito de totora en Huanchaco.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Surfing]] in a [[caballito de totora]]]]

Huanchaco beach is a summer vacation spot located in the northern city of [[Trujillo, Peru]]. Huanchaco is famous for several things but particularly for being a surfer's dream spot and its [[caballitos de totora]]. The most famous food here is the [[ceviche]]. Huanchaco is nearby the very famous ruins of [[Chan Chan]]. Throughout 2008 the town underwent significant improvements with all streets being paved with decorative bricks and the main street landscaped with plants.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.munihuanchaco.gob.pe/historia.php Huanchaco history&lt;/ref&gt; Huanchaco was approved as a World Surfing Reserve by the organization Save The Waves Coalition in 2012 and officially dedicated on October 26, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |año = |url = http://www.savethewaves.org/news/world-surfing-reserve-in-peru|title = Huanchaco-World Surfing Reserve in Peru|editor = |accessdate =3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Huanchaco Dedicated as 5th WSR|url=http://www.savethewaves.org/news/huanchaco-dedicated-as-5th-wsr|website=www.savethewaves.org|accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guarda do Embaú===
Now the 9th WSR, Guarda do Embaú is home to a world-class wave that breaks consistently year-round and is known as one of the best surf spots in Brazil.&lt;ref name="World Surfing Reserves"/&gt;

==World Surfing Reserves Google Earth Plug-In==
Save the Waves Coalition also created a [[Google Earth]] WSR [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-in]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.savethewaves.org/news/view/91/&lt;/ref&gt; that allows organizations and individuals to view nominated sites around the world. The plug-in allows users to learn about a nominated wave's history, location, environmental characteristics and [[surf culture]].
