'''2MASS J00361617+1821104''' (abbreviated to '''2MASS 0036+1821''') is a [[brown dwarf]], located in 28.6 [[light-year]]s from Earth in the constellation [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]]. It was discovered in 2000 by I. Neill Reid et al.

2MASS 0036+1821 is of spectral type L3.5, the surface temperature is 1300-2000 Kelvin. As with other brown dwarfs of spectral type L, its spectrum is dominated of metal [[hydride]]s and [[alkali metal]]s. Its position shifts due to its [[proper motion]] by 0.9071 arcseconds per year.

'''Alpha Regio''' is a region of the planet [[Venus]] extending for about 1500 kilometers  centered at 22°S, 5°E. 

It was discovered and named by [[Richard Goldstein (astronomer)|Richard Goldstein]] in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;Butrica, Andrew J., ''SP-4218 To See the Unseen'', [https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4218/ch5.htm ''Chapter 5: Normal Science''], NASA, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; The name was approved by the [[International Astronomical Union]]'s Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature (IAU/WGPSN) between 1976 and 1979.&lt;ref&gt;Butrica, Andrew J., ''SP-4218 To See the Unseen'', [https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4218/ch6.htm ''Chapter 6: Pioneering on Venus and Mars''], NASA, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maxwell Montes]], Alpha Regio, and [[Beta Regio]] are the three exceptions to the rule that the surface features of Venus are to be named for [[female]]s: women or [[goddess]]es.

The surface of the region is what is known as ''Tessera'',  meaning a terrain that has been highly deformed and where the deformation strikes in multiple directions and is closely spaced. The term comes from the Greek word for “tiled” (Russian investigators analyzing [[Venera 15]] and [[Venera 16]] imagery thought this terrain looked like a parquet floor). Like all ''tessera'' regions, it sits above the surrounding terrain at an elevation of 1 to 2 kilometers, and is heavily deformed by what appears to be contractional folding. Like most ''tessera'' units, the surrounding [[volcanic plains]] appear to have flowed around Alpha's margins and thus are younger than Alpha.

An infrared map prepared by the ''[[Venus Express]]'' orbiter shows that the rocks on the Alpha Regio plateau are lighter in colour and look old compared to the majority of the planet. On Earth, such light-coloured rocks are usually [[granite]] and form continents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spacefellowship.com/2009/07/14/new-map-hints-at-venus-wet-volcanic-past/ New map hints at Venus' wet, volcanic past | International Space Fellowship&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''arsonium''' [[cation]] is a positively charged polyatomic ion with the [[chemical formula]] {{chem|AsH|4|+}}. An arsonium salt is a salt containing either the arsonium ({{chem|AsH|4|+}}) cation, such as arsonium bromide ({{chem|AsH|4|+|Br|-}}) and arsonium iodide ({{chem|AsH|4|+|I|-}}), which can be synthesized by reacting [[arsine]] with [[hydrogen bromide]] or [[hydrogen iodide]].&lt;ref&gt;Muñoz‐Hernández, M. Á. (2006). Arsenic: Inorganic Chemistry. ''Encyclopedia of Inorganic Chemistry''. pp 4. DOI: 10.1002/0470862106.ia013&lt;/ref&gt;. Or more commonly, as organic derivative such as the quaternary arsonium salts {{chem|Ph|4|As|+|Cl|-}} (CAS: [123334-18-9], hydrate form) and the zwitterionic compound [[arsenobetaine]].

He is currently a professor at the [[University of Rhode Island]] Graduate School of Oceanography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gso.uri.edu/users/spivack |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517081243/http://www.gso.uri.edu/users/spivack |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-05-17 |title=spivack &amp;#124; URI Graduate School of Oceanography |publisher=Gso.uri.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-05-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spivack’s research interest is the geochemistry of the oceans, atmosphere, and crust. He developed the use of boron isotopes for determining the pH of ancient oceans.&lt;ref&gt;Spivack A.J., C.F.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4393">'''Auditory science''' or '''hearing science''' is a field of research and education concerning the [[Hearing|perception of sounds]] by humans, animals, or machines. It is a heavily interdisciplinary field at the crossroad between [[acoustics]], [[neuroscience]], and [[psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Plack|first1=Christopher J.|title=The Oxford Handbook of Auditory Science: Hearing|date=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-923355-7|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199233557.001.0001|accessdate=10 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often related to one or many of these other fields: [[psychophysics]], [[psychoacoustics]], [[audiology]], [[physiology]], [[otorhinolaryngology]], [[speech science]], [[automatic speech recognition]], [[music psychology]], [[linguistics]], and [[psycholinguistics]].

== History ==

{{See also|Category:Auditory scientists}}

Early auditory research included the early 19th century work of [[Georg Ohm]] and [[August Seebeck]] and their experiments and arguments about [[Fourier analysis]] of sounds.  Later in the 19th century, German physicist [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] wrote ''[[Sensations of Tone]]'' describing the founding concepts of psychoacoustics, i.e. the relationship between the physical parameters of a [[sound]] and the percept that it induces.

Psychoacoutics is primarily interested in the basic workings of the ear and is, therefore, mostly studied using simple sounds like [[Musical tone#Pure tone|pure tones]]. In the 1950s, psychologists [[George Armitage Miller|George A. Miller]] and [[J. C. R. Licklider]] furthered our knowledge in psychoacoustics and speech perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Licklider|first1=J. C.

The '''[http://ridl.cfd.rit.edu/ Center for Detectors (CfD)]''' is a [[Rochester Institute of Technology]] College of Science academic research center. The CfD was founded in 2010 by [[Donald Figer|Dr. Donald Figer.]] Located in the [http://www.rit.edu/research/itc/ IT Collaboratory at RIT], the CfD designs, develops, and implements new advanced sensor technologies through collaboration with academic researchers, industry engineers, government scientists, and university students. The mission of the CfD is to enable scientific discovery, national security, better living, and commercial innovation through the design and development of advanced photon detectors and associated technology in a broad array of applications (e.g. [[astrophysics]], biomedical imaging, [[Earth system science]], and [[Interplanetary spaceflight|inter-planetary travel]]).

== Research ==
[[File:M13Final merged small CfD.jpg|left|thumb|Color image of M13, the Great Cluster in [[Hercules (constellation)|Hercules]], taken by CfD personnel using the Teledyne Hawaii 4RG SiPIN detector (HyViSI). This was the first demonstration of this device in an astronomical application.]]
The CfD uses a multi-disciplinary approach, spanning the many branches of engineering, imaging science, physics and astronomy. Some projects, such as the “Cosmic Ray Damaged Image Repair” project, incorporate astronomy and imaging science. Others, like the NASA-funded Phase II: New Infrared Detectors for Astrophysics project, unite microelectronic engineers, astronomy experts, imaging scientists, and various other professionals in science fields. The Center for Detectors benefits from employees that come from a diverse range of academic programs and professional occupations. The CfD staff includes professors, engineers, and students (undergraduate, masters, and PhD). Many student researchers apply CfD research to their current academic programs at RIT. Students pursue various degrees such as [[Microelectronics|Microelectronic]], [[Computer engineering|Computer]], and [[Electronic Engineering|Electrical Engineering]]. Many undergraduate student researchers choose to pursue master's degrees based on the research that they conduct at CfD.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rit.edu/research/srs/news/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=450:center-for-detectors&amp;catid=142:labs-equipment-and-services&amp;Itemid=229/{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rit.edu/news/athenaeum_story.php?id=48266&lt;/ref&gt;

CfD is [[Grant (money)|grant-funded]] and has been awarded more than $16M in external funding since 2006. Primary sponsors include [[NASA]], [[National Science Foundation]], and the [[Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation]]. Additional sources of funding include [[Thermo Fisher Scientific]], [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory|NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory]],  [[Exelis Inc.|ITT Excelis]], and [[Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory]].

==Outreach and Communications==
Education supplements to two of the CfD grants have funded projects involving students from local high schools. Students mapped the “Journey of a Photon,” and presented their work at venues nationwide. A second group of high school students used an RIT-developed 3D projection system dubbed the “Planeterrainium” to explore planetary surfaces in 3D.

The Center has been featured at several conferences and in press venues. CfD researcher Kim Kolb presented her MS thesis at the [http://spie.org/op SPIE Optics and Photonics Conferences]. The [http://www.rbj.net Rochester Business Journal] and [http://www.rit.edu/news/ RIT University News] have published articles summarizing the foundations of the Center for Detectors to the public, and informing the RIT community about the purpose of the facilities.

CfD has hosted a variety of distinguished speakers as well. Some presenters include Dr. Donald Hall of the [[University of Hawaii]], Dr. Chris Packham of the [[University of Florida]], Dr. Joss Bland-Hawthorn of the [[University of Sydney]], [[Bruce J. Tromberg|Bruce Tromberg]], of the University of California, Irvine, and Dr. Shouleh Nikzad, Dr. Michael Hoenk, and [[Bedabrata Pain]] of the [[California Institute of Technology|California Institute of Technology’s]] [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]].

==Equipment and Facilities==
[[File:RIT CfD Dewar System.JPG|right|thumb|The Center's detector testing system uses custom-built cylindrical vacuum cryogenic dewars.]] The Center has four research labs: the [http://ridle.cis.rit.edu Rochester Imaging Detector Laboratory]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, the [[Quantum Dot]] Detector Laboratory, the [[Cleanroom|Clean Room]] Probe Testing Laboratory, and the [[LIDAR]] Laboratory. Three test systems were designed at the CfD, which are essential to the lab’s detector-testing capabilities.

[[File:CfD Spot Projector.JPG|left|thumb|This laser spot projector is used in the Center for Detectors. The system is mounted on a 3D motorized stage that produces a small point source for measurements of intrapixel sensitivity.]] The Center also has access to other RIT facilities, including the [https://web.archive.org/web/20121203031251/http://www.rit.edu/research/srs/news/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=451%3Acenter-for-electronics-manufacturing-a-assembly&amp;catid=142%3Alabs-equipment-and-services&amp;Itemid=229 Center for Electronics Manufacturing and Assembly], which specializes in semiconductor chip packaging, printed circuit board assemblies, and electronics/[[optoelectronics]] systems, and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20121203031218/http://www.rit.edu/research/srs/news/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=453%3Abrinkman-machine-tools-and-manufacturing-laboratory&amp;catid=142%3Alabs-equipment-and-services&amp;Itemid=229 Brinkman Manufacturing Lab], which provides machining support for in-house fabrications.

'''Deep space exploration''' (or '''deep-space exploration''') is the branch of [[astronomy]], [[astronautics]] and [[space technology]] that is involved with exploring the distant regions of [[outer space]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://adc.gsfc.nasa.gov/adc/education/space_ex/exploration.html |title=Space and its Exploration: How Space is Explored |work=NASA.gov |accessdate=2009-07-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090702153058/http://adc.gsfc.nasa.gov/adc/education/space_ex/exploration.html |archivedate=2009-07-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Physical [[space exploration|exploration of space]] is conducted both by [[human spaceflight]]s (deep-space astronautics) and by [[robotic spacecraft]].

Some of the best candidates for future deep space engine technologies include [[anti-matter]], [[nuclear power]] and [[beam-powered propulsion|beamed propulsion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/space/exploration/futurespaceflight/index.shtml |title=Future Spaceflight |work=BBC |accessdate=2009-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter, beamed propulsion, appears to be the best candidate for deep space exploration presently available, since it uses known physics and known technology that is being developed for other purposes.&lt;ref name="Forward1996"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Ad Astra! |journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society |first=Robert L |last=Forward |volume=49 |pages=23–32 |date=January 1996 |bibcode = 1996JBIS...49...23F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current research==

In 2012, the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] announced the award of $500,000 to former astronaut [[Mae Jemison]] to fund a project with the goal of sending future astronauts out of the Solar System. Jemison aims to increase public interest in future deep space exploration projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Vastag |first=Brian |title=Starship dreamers launch 100-year mission with DARPA grant |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/starship-dreamers-launch-100-year-mission-with-darpa-grant/2012/05/22/gIQA2k8wiU_story.html |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=May 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon awarding the money to Jemison, a "[[100 Year Starship]]" symposium was held in [[Houston, Texas]] to discuss interstellar travel. Topics discussed include "time-distance solutions; life sciences in space exploration; destinations and habitats; becoming an interstellar civilization; space technologies enhancing life on earth; and commercial opportunities from interstellar efforts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moskowitz|first=Clara|title=Interstellar Starship Meeting Warps Into Houston This Week|url=http://www.space.com/17507-interstellar-space-travel-100-year-starship.html|work=Space.com|accessdate=November 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research in deep space is ongoing and rapidly developing. In 2011, after the retirement of the [[space shuttle]], NASA announced its intentions to invest money into developing three technologies vital to deep space exploration. The "must-have technologies" include a deep space atomic clock, a large solar sail and a more advanced laser communications system to improve communication, navigation, and propulsion in future missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wall|first=Mike|title=NASA Picks 3 Pioneering Technologies for Deep Space Travel|url=http://www.space.com/12697-nasa-space-technology-demonstration-missions.html|work=Space.com|accessdate=November 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013, NASA announced the selection of eight American astronauts that will begin to train for future deep space missions beyond low Earth orbit. NASA intends that these eight astronauts to train for future Mars or asteroid travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moskowitz|first=Clara|title=NASA Unveils New Astronaut Class for Deep-Space Exploration|url=http://www.space.com/21585-nasa-unveils-astronauts-deep-space.html|work=Space.com|accessdate=November 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Single Aperture Far-Infrared Observatory ([[SAFIR]]), a proposed cryogenic space telescope, is tentatively set to launch in 2015 with the hopes of exploring "the formation of the first stars and galaxies" in deep space. The telescope will be more than 1000 times more sensitive than two current telescope spacecrafts, the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]] and the [[Herschel Space Observatory]]. NASA hopes to use SAFIR to learn about black holes, [[galaxy formation and evolution]] and the formation of [[star system]]s in the far reaches of space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SAFIR - Single Aperture Far Infrared Observatory |url=http://safir.jpl.nasa.gov/index.shtml |publisher=NASA |accessdate=November 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ecology: From Individuals to Ecosystems''''' is a 2006 [[higher education]] [[textbook]] on general [[ecology]] written by [[Michael Begon]], [[Colin R. Townsend]] and [[John L. Harper]]. Published by [[Blackwell Publishing]], it is now in its fourth [[edition (book)|edition]]. The first three editions were published by [[Blackwell Science]] under the title ''Ecology: Individuals, Populations and Communities''. Since it first became available it has had a positive reception, and has long been one of the leading textbooks on ecology.

==Background and history==
The book is written by Michael Begon of the [[University of Liverpool]]'s School of Biosciences, Colin Townsend, from the Department of Zoology of [[New Zealand]]'s [[University of Otago]], and the [[University of Exeter]]'s [[John L. Harper]]. The first edition was published in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Smith |first=Robert H. |date=February 1986 |title=      Ecology writ large |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|volume=319 |issue= 6056|pages=809 |doi= 10.1038/319809b0 |url=  |quote=All ecology teachers and students would do well to sample this ''nouvelle cuisine''. }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed in 1990 with a second edition. The third edition became available in 1996. The most recent edition appeared in 2006 under the new [[subtitle (titling)|subtitle]] ''From Individuals to Ecosystems''.

One of the book's authors, [[John L. Harper]], is now [[deceased]]. The fourth edition cover is an image of a mural on a [[Wellington]] street created by Christopher Meech and a group of urban artists to generate thought about the topic of [[environmental degradation]]. It reads "we did not inherit the earth from our ancestors, we borrowed it from our children."

In any technical subject, words commonly used in everyday life acquire very specific [[technical terminology|technical meanings]], and confusion can arise when someone is uncertain of the intended meaning of a word. This article explains the differences in meaning between some technical terms used in [[economics]] and the corresponding terms in everyday usage.

=="Recession"==
Economists commonly use the term "[[recession]]" to mean either a period of two successive calendar quarters each having negative growth of [[real gross domestic product]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/invest//glossary/bfglosr.htm|title=Financial Check Glossary|website=bloomberg.com|year= 2000|accessdate= 19 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/recession.html|title=Definition: Recession|website=businessdictionary.com|year=2007–2008|accessdate=19 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mankiw"&gt;Mankiw, N. Gregory, ''Macroeconomics'', seventh edition, Worth Publishers, 2010; {{ISBN|1-4292-1887-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;—that is, of the total amount of goods and services produced within a country—or that provided by the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nber.org/cycles/ |publisher=National Bureau of Economic Research |title=Business Cycle Expansions and Contractions |accessdate=19 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219215409/https://www.nber.org/cycles/ |archivedate=19 February 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; (NBER):  "...a significant decline in economic activity spread across the country, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in real GDP growth, real personal income, employment (non-farm payrolls), industrial production, and wholesale-retail sales." Almost all economists and policymakers defer to the NBER's determination for the precise dates of a U.S. recession's beginning and end.&lt;ref name="Recession"/&gt;

In contrast, in non-expert, everyday usage, "recession" may refer to a period in which the [[unemployment rate]] is substantially higher than normal.

=="Unemployed"==
[[Labour economics|Labor economists]] categorize people into three groups:  "employed" - actually working at a job, even if part-time; "unemployed" - not working, but looking for work or awaiting a scheduled recall from a temporary layoff; and "not in the labor force" - neither working nor looking for work.&lt;ref name="Mankiw"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Baumol and Blinder"&gt;Baumol, William J., and Blinder, Alan S. ''Macroeconomics: Principles and Policy'', Southwestern College Publ., eleventh ed., 2008; {{ISBN|0-324-58621-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;   People not in the labor force, even if they have given up looking for a job despite wanting one, are not considered unemployed.  For this reason it is often thought, especially when a [[recession]] has persisted for a sustained period, that the [[unemployment rate]] understates the true amount of unemployment because some unemployment is [[Disguised unemployment|disguised]] by [[discouraged worker]]s having left the labor force.

The everyday usage of the word "unemployed" is usually broad enough to include disguised unemployment, and may include people with no intention of finding a job. For example, a dictionary definition is: "not engaged in a gainful occupation",&lt;ref name="unemployed"/&gt; which is broader than the economic definition.

=="Money"==
Economists use the word "money" to mean very [[Market liquidity|liquid]] assets which are held at any moment in time.&lt;ref name="Mankiw"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Baumol and Blinder"/&gt;  The units of measurement are dollars or another currency, with no time dimension, so this is a [[stocks and flows|stock]] variable.  There are several technical definitions of what is included in "money", depending on how liquid a particular type of asset has to be in order to be included.  Common measures include [[Money supply#Empirical measures|M1, M2, and M3]].

In everyday usage, "money" can refer to the very liquid assets included in the technical definition, but it usually refers to something much broader.  When someone says "She has a lot of money," the intended meaning is almost certainly that she has a lot of what economists would call [[Wealth#Economic analysis|financial wealth]], which includes not only the most liquid assets (which tend to pay low or zero returns), but also stocks, bonds and other financial investments not included in the technical definition. Non-financial assets, such as land and buildings, may also be included. For example, dictionary definitions of money include  "wealth reckoned in terms of money" and "persons or interests possessing or controlling great wealth",&lt;ref name="Money definition"/&gt; neither of which correspond to the economic definition.

A related but different everyday usage occurs in the sentence "He makes a lot of money."  This refers to a variable that economists call [[income]].  Unlike the usages mentioned above, this one has the units "dollars, or another currency, per unit of time", where the unit of time might be a week, month, or year, making it a flow variable.

=="Investment" and "capital"==
While [[financial economist]]s use the word "investment" to refer to the acquisition and holding of potentially income-generating forms of wealth such as stocks and bonds,&lt;ref&gt;Bodie, Zvi; Kane, Alex; and Marcus, Alan J.  ''Investments'', eighth edition, McGraw-Hill/Irwin, 2008; {{ISBN|0-07-338237-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[macroeconomist]]s usually use the word for the sum of [[fixed investment]]—the purchasing of a certain amount of newly produced productive equipment, buildings or other productive physical assets per unit of time—and [[inventory investment]]—the accumulation of [[inventories]] over time.&lt;ref name="Baumol and Blinder"/&gt;  This is one of the major types of expenditure in an economy, the others being consumption expenditure, government expenditure, and expenditure on a country's export goods by people outside the country.

The everyday usage of "investment" coincides with the one used by financial economists—the acquisition and holding of potentially income-generating forms of wealth such as stocks and bonds.&lt;ref name="Webster's"/&gt;

Similarly, while financial economists use the word [[financial capital|"capital"]] to refer to funds used by entrepreneurs and businesses to buy what they need to make their products or to provide their services,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brealey |first=Richard A. |last2=Myers |first2=Stewart C. |last3=Marcus |first3=Alan J. |title=Fundamentals of Corporate Finance |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=2007 |isbn=0-07-301238-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; macroeconomists and [[microeconomist]]s use the term [[capital (economics)|capital]] to mean productive equipment, buildings or other productive physical assets.&lt;ref name="Baumol and Blinder micro"/&gt;

As with the term "investment", the everyday usage of "capital" coincides with its use by financial economists.&lt;ref name="Webster's"/&gt;

=="Government spending"==
Economists distinguish between government spending on newly produced goods and services, such as paying a company to build a new highway, and government spending on [[transfer payment]]s, which are payments such as [[welfare]] payments intended to [[Income redistribution|redistribute income]].  In [[economic model]]s, transfer payments are normally treated as a negative component of "taxes net of transfers", leaving "government spending on (newly produced) goods and services" as a separate category, often referred to simply as "government spending".&lt;ref name="Mankiw"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Baumol and Blinder"/&gt;

In everyday usage, "government spending" refers to the broader concept of government spending on goods and services plus transfer payments.

=="Welfare economics"==
[[Welfare economics]] is a branch of economics that uses [[microeconomics|microeconomic]] techniques to evaluate economic well-being, especially relative to [[general equilibrium theory|competitive general equilibrium]], with a focus on [[efficiency (economics)|economic efficiency]] and [[income distribution]].&lt;ref&gt;Arrow, Kenneth J. (1951; 2nd ed. 1963). ''Social Choice and Individual Values'', Yale University Press, New Haven.&lt;/ref&gt;

In general usage, including by economists outside the above context, [[welfare]] refers to a form of [[transfer payment]].&lt;ref&gt;Nadasen, Premilla, [[Jennifer Mittelstadt]], and [[Marisa Chappell]], ''[[Welfare in the United States: A History with Documents, 1935–1996]]'', Routledge, 2009; {{ISBN|978-0-415-98979-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Efficient"==
Economists use the word [[Economic efficiency|efficient]] to mean any of several closely related things:&lt;ref name="Baumol and Blinder micro"&gt;Baumol, Willilam J., and Blinder, Alan S., ''Microeconomics: Principles and Policy, 2007 Update'', Southwestern College Publ., tenth edition, 2007; {{ISBN|0-324-53701-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* No one can be made better off without making someone else worse off ([[Pareto efficiency]]).
* More [[Output (economics)|output]] cannot be obtained without increasing the amount of [[factors of production|inputs]].
* [[Production function|Production]] proceeds at the lowest possible per-unit cost.
All of these definitions involve the idea that nothing more can be achieved given the resources available.

In popular usage, efficient often has the similar but less precise meaning "functioning effectively".&lt;ref name="Webster's"&gt;''Webster's College Dictionary'', Random House, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Cost"==
The economics term '''cost''', also known as '''economic cost''' or [[opportunity cost]], refers to the potential gain that is lost by foregoing one opportunity in order to take advantage of another.  The lost potential gain is the cost of the opportunity that is accepted.  Sometimes this cost is explicit: for example, if a firm pays $100 for a machine, its cost is $100.  Other times, however, the cost is implicit:  for example, if a firm diverts resources from producing output worth $200 into producing a different kind of output, then regardless of how much or how little of the latter output is produced, the opportunity cost of doing so is $200.

In [[accounting]], there is a different technical concept of [[Cost#Accounting vs opportunity costs|cost]], which excludes implicit opportunity costs.

In common usage, as in accounting usage, "cost" typically does not refer to implicit costs and instead only refers to direct monetary costs.

=="Demand"==
In economics, [[demand (economics)|demand]] refers to the strength of one or many consumers' willingness to purchase a good or goods at any in a range of prices.  If, for example, a rise in income causes a consumer to be willing to purchase more of a good than before contingent on each possible price, economists say that the income rise has caused the consumer's demand for the good to rise.  In contrast, if a change in market conditions leads to a decline in the price of a good resulting in a consumer's being willing to buy more of it, economists say that the consumer's '''quantity demanded''' of the good has risen.  A change in ''quantity demanded'' is represented by a movement ''along'' the [[demand curve]], while a change in ''demand'' is represented by a ''shift'' of the demand curve.&lt;ref name="Baumol and Blinder micro"/&gt;

In popular usage a change in "demand" can refer to either what economists call a change in demand or what economists call a change in quantity demanded.

=="Marginal"==

While "marginal" in common usage tends to mean "tangential", implying limited importance, in economics "[[Marginal concepts|marginal]]" means "incremental".  For example, the [[marginal propensity to consume]]  refers to the incremental tendency to spend income on consumer goods: the fraction of any additional income which is spent on additional consumption (or conversely, the fraction of any decrease in income which becomes a decrease in consumption).  Likewise, the [[marginal product of capital]] refers to the additional production of output that results from using an additional unit of physical [[Capital (economics)|capital]] (machinery, etc.).  If very small increments are being considered, so that [[calculus]] is used, then this ratio of incremental amounts is a [[derivative]] (for example, the marginal propensity to consume becomes the derivative of consumption with respect to income).

=="Significant"==

In common usage, "significant" usually means "noteworthy" or "of substantial importance".  In [[econometrics]] — the use of [[Statistics|statistical techniques]] in economics — "[[Statistical significance|significant]]" means "unlikely to have occurred by chance".  For example, suppose one wishes to find if the [[minimum wage]] rate affects firms' decisions on [[Labor market#Demand for labour and wage determination|how much labor to hire]].  If the data show, on the basis of statistical techniques, an effect of a particular non-zero magnitude, one wants to know whether that non-zero magnitude could have arisen in the data by chance when in fact the true effect is zero.  If a statistical test shows that there is less than, say, a 5% chance that one would have found this particular value if the true value were zero, then it is said that the estimate is "significant at the 5% level".  If not, then it is said that the estimate is "insignificant at the 5% level".

Note, however, that the less precise phrase "economically significant" is sometimes used by economists to mean something very similar to the common usage of "significant".  If the effect of the minimum wage on hiring decisions were found to be very small and yet the numerical result is very unlikely to have occurred only by chance, then the estimated effect is said to be statistically significant but not significant economically.

=="Biased"==

In common usage "biased" generally means "prejudiced".  In econometrics, the estimate of the effect of one thing on another (say, the estimate of the effect of the minimum wage upon employment decisions) is said to be "[[Bias (statistics)|biased]]" if the technique that was used to obtain the estimate has the effect that, ''a priori'', the [[expected value]] of the estimated effect differs from the true effect, whatever the latter may be.  In this case the technique, as well as the estimate obtained with the technique, is called "biased".  Researchers are likely to view a biased estimate with suspicion.

=="Elasticity"==

In general usage "elasticity" refers to flexibility.  In economics it refers to a quantitative measurement of the degree of flexibility of something in response to something else.  For example, the "elasticity of demand with respect to income" or the "income elasticity of demand" for a product refers to the percentage change in the quantity of the product demanded in response to a 1% change in consumers' income, or more generally to the ratio of the percentage change in quantity demanded to the percentage change in income.  The change in the denominator always [[Causality|causes]] the change in the numerator, so the elasticity can be said to be the ratio of a percentage change that is caused to the percentage change of something that is causative.

=="Rational"==

In general usage, one is said to be rational if one is sane or lucid.&lt;ref&gt;Random House, ''Webster's College Dictionary''.&lt;/ref&gt; In economics, rationality means that an economic agent specifies, or acts as if he implicitly specifies, a way to characterize his or someone's well-being, and then takes into account all relevant information in making choices so as to optimize that well-being. For example, an individual consumer is assumed to be rational in the sense that he maximizes a [[utility function]], which expresses his subjective sense of well-being as a function of the amounts of various goods he consumes; firms are assumed to maximize [[Profit (economics)|profit]] or some related goal. Economists assume that in the presence of uncertainty, an agent is rational in the sense of specifying a way of evaluating sets of possible outcomes (and associated probabilities) with some function: A consumer is assumed to choose his consumption levels of various goods so as to pick the set of possible outcomes, and associated probabilities, that maximizes this function, which is often assumed to be the expected value of a [[von Neumann-Morgenstern utility function]]; a firm is often assumed to maximize the [[expected value]] of profit.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2579">'''Euphenics''', which literally means "good appearance" or "normal appearing", is the science of making [[phenotypic]] improvements to humans after birth, generally to affect a problematic [[genetic condition]].

==Overview==
In the early 1960s, [[Joshua Lederberg]] invented the term euphenics to differentiate the practice from [[eugenics]], which was widely unpopular at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Bud, Robert. The Uses of Life: A History of Biotechnology, Cambridge University Press, 1993, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Khanna, Pragya. Essentials of Genetics, I. K. International Pvt Ltd, 2010, p. 367&lt;/ref&gt;  He emphasized that the genetic manipulation he described was intended to work on phenotype rather than genotype; he felt it was more feasible to positively change an individual's genetics rather than attempt to change the course of evolution as eugenics proposed.&lt;ref&gt;Lederberg, Joshua. "Molecular Biology, Eugenics and Euphenics", Nature 63(198), p. 428&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]], an outspoken proponent of euphenics, argued that by improving genetic conditions so that people could live normal, healthy lives, people could lessen the impact of genetic conditions, thus lowering future interest in eugenics or other kinds of genetic manipulation.&lt;ref&gt;Minkoff, Eli and Baker, Pamela. [[Biology Today: An Issues Approach]], Taylor &amp; Francis, 2000, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, considerable effort was put towards the developing field of euphenics since it was seen as a positive form of genetic engineering.&lt;ref&gt;Pai, Anna. Foundations of Genetics: A Science for Society, McGraw-Hill, 1974, p. 408&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the first publicized applications of euphenics was the use of vitamins containing [[folic acid]] during pregnancy to combat neural-tube deficiencies such as [[spina bifida]] in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Burdyuzha, Vladimir. The Future of the Universe and the Future of our Civilization, World Scientific, 2000, pp. 261−263&lt;/ref&gt; However, medical science had been using euphenic strategies years before the term itself was coined.&lt;ref&gt;Guttman, Burton. Genetics: The Code of Life, The Rosen Publishing Group, 2011, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; Euphenics is used today in the medical community to more generally refer to methods of affecting a genetic condition in a positive manner through diet, lifestyle or environment, such as the use of insulin to control diabetes or installation of a pacemaker to offset a heart defect.&lt;ref&gt;Maxson, Linda and Daugherty, Charles. Genetics: A Human Perspective, W.C.Brown, 1992, p. 391&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Foros''' is an [[impact crater]] just northeast of [[Argyre basin]] in the [[Argyre quadrangle]] of [[Mars]], located at 33.4°S and 28.87°W.  It is 24.54&amp;nbsp;km in diameter and was named after [[Foros, Ukraine|Foros]], a town in the Ukraine. The name was approved in 1979 by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) [[Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature]] (WGPSN).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature {{!}} Foros|url=http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Feature/1995|website=usgs.gov|publisher=[[International Astronomical Union]]|accessdate=October 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the naming, the place was inside the Soviet Union until 1990.

Nearby named craters include the small Flateyri to the south and [[Zilair (crater)|Zilar]] to the west-northwest. North of Foros is [[Pyrrhae Fossae]] which features a couple of troughs or trenches.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3182">The '''Granollers Museum of Natural Sciences''', in [[Granollers]]  (in [[Vallès Oriental]], Spain), covers the fields of [[palaeontology]], [[geology]], [[botany]], [[meteorology]], and, in particular, [[zoology]].&lt;ref name="Guia"&gt;"&gt;{{cite book|title= Guia del Museu més gran de Catalunya |first= |last=|publisher= Centre d'Estudis i Divulgació del Patrimoni |year=1999|ISBN=|pages=90–94|language=Catalan }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Museum is the headquarters of the Montseny Natural Park Documentation Centre (natural sciences section) and of the Catalan Butterfly Monitoring Scheme; it also manages the Granollers Meteorological Station and the Can Cabanyes Environmental Education Centre. The Granollers Museum of Natural Sciences, part of the [[Barcelona Provincial Council Local Museum Network]], was from October 2008 to May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museugranollersciencies.org |title=Museu de Ciències Naturals de Granollers |accessdate=January 27, 2012 |work= |publisher=museudegranollersciencies.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Catalan Butterfly Monitoring Scheme==
The Catalan Butterfly Monitoring Scheme is a project to monitor the [[butterfly]] populations in order to detect more precisely changes in their population based on weekly repetitions of visual census using fixed transects, to later relate said changes to the different environmental factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catalanbms.org/ca/projecte |title=Catalan Butterfly Monitoring Scheme |accessdate=January 10, 2012 |work= |publisher=catalanbms.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Granollers Meteorological Station==
The Granollers Meteorological Station has worked uninterruptedly since its creation, in 1950, by the [[Granollers Museum]], and is part of the network of the National Institute of Meteorology of the Spanish Ministry of the Environment and Rural and Marine Affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museugranollersciencies.org/ca/meteorologia/estacio/ |title=Museu de Ciències Naturals de Granollers: estació metereològica |accessdate=January 10, 2012 |publisher=museugranollersciencies.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Can Cabanyes Environmental Education Centre==
The Can Cabanyes natural area is located to the south of [[Granollers]], between the [[Montmeló]] road and the right bank of the [[Congost River]], and gets its name from the farmhouse once located on the property. Both environmental recovery and landscape improvement measures, such as riverbank recovery, the regeneration of existing woodland and the creation of artificial wetlands, have been carried out, which has led to an increase in the naturalisation and environmental diversification of the riverbank.

'''Gwyddion''' is a multiplatform modular [[free software]] for visualization and analysis of data from [[scanning probe microscopy]] (SPM) techniques (like [[atomic force microscopy|AFM]], [[magnetic force microscope|MFM]], [[scanning tunneling microscope|STM]], [[near-field scanning optical microscope|SNOM/NSOM]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Gwyddion: an open-source software for SPM data analysis |journal=Central European Journal of Physics |author=D Nečas &amp; P Klapetek |volume=10 |issue=1 |page=181 |doi=10.2478/s11534-011-0096-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project is led by its main developers David Nečas (Yeti) and Petr Klapetek who work together with several various developers across the world. The software is made available as free software under the terms of the [[GNU General Public License]].
The name “Gwyddion” is that of a prominent god of Welsh Mythology, see ''[[Gwydion]]''

It is created for the analysis of [[height field]]s and other 2D (image) data. While it is primarily intended for data originating from scanning probe microscopy techniques (like [[atomic force microscopy|AFM]], [[magnetic force microscope|MFM]], [[scanning tunneling microscope|STM]], [[near-field scanning optical microscope|SNOM/NSOM]]), it may also be used for the analysis of profilometry data, for instance.
Data is calculated and stored in the native file format (&lt;code&gt;.gwy&lt;/code&gt;) in double precision.

Gwyddion supports many different file types and performs many image-based functions. Among others it can open and save the following graphics [[file format]]s:
* [[Windows bitmap]] (&lt;code&gt;.bmp&lt;/code&gt;)
* [[JPEG|Joint Photographic Experts Group]] (&lt;code&gt;.jpeg&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.jpg&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;.jpe&lt;/code&gt;)
* [[Portable Network Graphics]] (&lt;code&gt;.png&lt;/code&gt;)
* [[Truevision TGA|TARGA]] (&lt;code&gt;.tga&lt;/code&gt;)
* [[TIFF|Tagged image file format]] (&lt;code&gt;.tiff&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.tif&lt;/code&gt;)
* [[Portable anymap|Portable aNy Map]] (&lt;code&gt;.pnm&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;ref&gt;[http://gwyddion.net/documentation/user-guide-en/file-formats.html Complete list of currently supported file formats]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technical features ==
Quote from homepage of Gwyddion: 'Gwyddion uses a fairly general physical unit system, there are no principal limitations on the types of physical quantities data (and lateral dimensions) can represent. Units of slopes, areas, volumes, and other derived quantities are correctly calculated. SI unit system is used whenever possible.

Tools and other dialogs remember their parameters, not only between tool invocations during one session, but also between sessions. Gwyddion native file format (&lt;code&gt;.gwy&lt;/code&gt;) supports saving all data specific settings: false color palette, masks, presentations, selections, associated 3D view parameters, graphs associated with that data and their settings, etc.'

Gwyddion is mainly developed on [[Linux]] platform using [[GNU]] set of compilers and utilities. Its [[graphical user interface]] is based on the popular interface toolkit ''[[GTK+]]''.

== Availability and versions ==
It is available for Linux platforms and has been ported to other unix flavors that has support the GNU Autotools or its equivalent. The [[Windows]] version is slightly incomplete due to limitations of the platform, but supports nearly all major features. The [[Mac OS]] version can be built using [[Xcode]], and some pre-built binaries are available.

Apple Darwin, or [[OpenDarwin]] is the only major platform Gwyddion has not been thoroughly tested on. Gwyddion program could also be ported to other branches of the [[BSD]] operating system.

The '''History of science''' is the study of the development of [[science]] and scientific knowledge, including both the [[natural science|natural]] and [[social science]]s. (The history of the arts and humanities is termed [[history of scholarship]].) [[Science]] is a body of [[empirical knowledge|empirical]], [[theory|theoretical]], and [[Procedural knowledge|practical]] knowledge about the [[Nature|natural world]], produced by scientists who emphasize the observation, [[scientific explanation|explanation]], and prediction of real world [[phenomenon|phenomena]]. [[Historiography of science]], in contrast, studies the methods employed by historians of science.

The English word ''scientist'' is relatively recent—first coined by [[William Whewell]] in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.kent.ac.uk/sciencecomma/2015/04/09/whewell-and-the-coining-of-scientist-in-the-quarterly-review/|title=Whewell and the coining of 'scientist' in the Quarterly Review » Science Comma|website=blogs.kent.ac.uk|access-date=2016-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, investigators of nature called themselves "[[natural philosophers]]". While [[empirical]] [[Discovery (observation)|investigations]] of the natural world have been described since [[classical antiquity]] (for example by [[Thales]] and [[Aristotle]]), and [[scientific method]] has been employed since the [[Middle Ages]] (for example, by [[Ibn al-Haytham]] and [[Roger Bacon]]), modern science began to develop in the [[early modern period]], and in particular in the [[scientific revolution]] of 16th- and 17th-century Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hendrix|first=Scott E. |title=Natural Philosophy or Science in Premodern Epistemic Regimes? The Case of the Astrology of Albert the Great and Galileo Galilei|journal=Teorie Vědy / Theory of Science |year=2011 |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=111–132 |url=http://teorievedy.flu.cas.cz/index.php/tv/issue/view/10 |accessdate=20 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, historians of science have defined science sufficiently broadly to include those earlier inquiries.&lt;ref&gt;"For our purpose, science may be defined as ordered knowledge of natural phenomena and of the relations between them." [[William Cecil Dampier|William C. Dampier-Whetham]], "Science", in ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 11th ed. (New York: 1911); "Science comprises, first, the orderly and systematic comprehension, description and/or explanation of natural phenomena and, secondly, the [mathematical and logical] tools necessary for the undertaking." [[Marshall Clagett]], ''Greek Science in Antiquity'' (New York: Collier Books, 1955); "Science is a systematic explanation of perceived or imaginary phenomena, or else is based on such an explanation.  Mathematics finds a place in science only as one of the symbolical languages in which scientific explanations may be expressed." [[David Pingree]], "Hellenophilia versus the History of Science", ''Isis'' '''83''', 559 (1982); [[Pat Munday]], entry "History of Science", ''New Dictionary of the History of Ideas'' (Charles Scribner's Sons, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 18th century through late 20th century, the history of science, especially of the physical and biological sciences, was often presented as a progressive accumulation of knowledge, in which true theories replaced false beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Golinski |first=Jan  |year=2001 |title=Making Natural Knowledge: Constructivism and the History of Science |edition= reprint |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0226302324 |page=2 | quote=When [history of science] began, during the eighteenth century, it was practiced by scientists (or "natural philosophers") with an interest in validating and defending their enterprise.  They wrote histories in which ... the science of the day was exhibited as the outcome of the progressive accumulation of human knowledge, which was an integral part of moral and cultural development.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some more recent historical interpretations, such as those of [[Thomas Kuhn]], tend to portray the history of science in terms of competing paradigms or conceptual systems in a wider matrix of intellectual, cultural, economic and political trends. These interpretations, however, have met with opposition for they also portray history of science as an incoherent system of incommensurable paradigms, not leading to any scientific progress, but only to the illusion of progress.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, T., 1962, "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions", University of Chicago Press, p. 137: "Partly by selection and partly by distortion, the scientists of earlier ages are implicitly presented as having worked upon the same set of fixed problems and in accordance with the same set of fixed canons that the most recent revolution in scientific theory and method made seem scientific."&lt;/ref&gt;

In prehistoric times, technique and knowledge were passed from generation to generation in an [[oral tradition]]. For example, the domestication of maize for agriculture has been dated to about 9,000 years ago in southern Mexico, before the development of [[writing system]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Matsuoka | first=Yoshihiro | last2=Vigouroux  | first2=Yves | last3=Goodman | first3=Major M. | last4=Sanchez G. | first4=Jesus | last5=Buckler | first5=Edward | last6=Doebley | first6=John | title=A single domestication for maize shown by multilocus microsatellite genotyping | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume=99 | issue=9 | pages=6080–6084 | date=30 April 2002 | url=http://www.pnas.org/content/99/9/6080.long | pmid=11983901 | pmc=122905 | doi=10.1073/pnas.052125199 | ref=harv | postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Many ancient civilizations systematically collected astronomical observations. Rather than speculate on the material nature of the planets and stars, the ancients charted the relative positions of celestial bodies, often inferring their influence on human society. This demonstrates how ancient investigators generally employed a holistic  intuition, assuming the interconnectedness of all things, whereas modern science rejects such conceptual leaps.

Basic facts about human physiology were known in some places, and [[alchemy]] was practiced in several civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;See Homer's ''Odyssey'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0136%3Abook%3D4%3Acard%3D219 4.227–232] '[The Egyptians] are of the race of [[Paean (god)|Paeeon]] [(physician to the gods)]'&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See, for example [[Joseph Needham]] (1974, 1976, 1980, 1983) and his co-authors, ''[[Science and Civilisation in China]]'', '''V''', Cambridge University Press, specifically:

These physicians, who could be either male or female, also dressed wounds, set limbs, and performed simple surgeries. The ancient Mesopotamians also practiced [[prophylaxis]] and took measures to prevent the spread of disease.&lt;ref name="McIntosh2005"/&gt;

The ancient Mesopotamians had extensive knowledge about the chemical properties of clay, sand, metal ore, [[bitumen]], stone, and other natural materials, and applied this knowledge to practical use in manufacturing [[pottery]], [[faience]], glass, soap, metals, [[lime plaster]], and waterproofing. [[Metallurgy]] required scientific knowledge about the properties of metals. Nonetheless, the Mesopotamians seem to have had little interest in gathering information about the natural world for the mere sake of gathering information and were far more interested in studying the manner in which the gods had ordered the universe. Biology of non-human organisms was generally only written about in the context of mainstream academic disciplines. [[Animal physiology]] was studied extensively for the purpose of [[divination]]; the anatomy of the [[liver]], which was seen as an important organ in [[haruspicy]], was studied in particularly intensive detail. [[Animal behavior]] was also studied for divinatory purposes. Most information about the training and domestication of animals was probably transmitted orally without being written down, but one text dealing with the training of horses has survived.&lt;ref name="McIntosh2005"/&gt; The Mesopotamian cuneiform tablet [[Plimpton 322]], dating to the eighteenth century BC, records a number of [[Pythagorean triple]]ts (3,4,5) (5,12,13) ...,&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Hoffman (science writer)|Paul Hoffman]], ''The man who loved only numbers: the story of Paul Erdös and the search for mathematical truth'', (New York: Hyperion), 1998, p. 187. {{ISBN|0786863625}}&lt;/ref&gt; hinting that the ancient Mesopotamians might have been aware of the [[Pythagorean theorem]] over a millennium before Pythagoras.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Burkert|first=Walter|author-link=Walter Burkert |date=1 June 1972|title=Lore and Science in Ancient Pythagoreanism|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0qqp4Vk1zG0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Pythagoreanism#v=onepage&amp;q=Pythagoreanism&amp;f=false|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0674539181 |pages=429, 462 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kahn|first=Charles H.|date=2001|title=Pythagoras and the Pythagoreans: A Brief History |url=https://books.google.com/?id=GKUtAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA72&amp;dq=Pythagoreanism#v=onepage&amp;q=Pythagoreanism&amp;f=false |location=Indianapolis, Indiana and Cambridge, England|publisher=Hackett Publishing Company |isbn=978-0872205758|page=32|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Riedweg|first=Christoph|date=2005|orig-year=2002 |title=Pythagoras: His Life, Teachings, and Influence|url=https://books.google.com/?id=A8ixyQJA7_MC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Pythagoras#v=onepage&amp;q=Pythagoras&amp;f=false|location=Ithaca, New York|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-7452-1|page=27|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SumerianClayTablet,palm-sized422BCE.jpg|thumb|[[Mesopotamian]] clay tablet, 492 BC. Writing allowed the recording of [[Astronomy|astronomical]] information.]]

In [[Babylonian astronomy]], records of the motions of the [[star]]s, [[planet]]s, and the [[moon]] are left on thousands of [[clay tablet]]s created by [[scribe]]s. Even today, astronomical periods identified by Mesopotamian proto-scientists are still widely used in Western calendars such as the [[solar year]] and the [[lunar month]]. Using these data they developed arithmetical methods to compute the changing length of daylight in the course of the year and to predict the appearances and disappearances of the Moon and planets and eclipses of the Sun and Moon.  Only a few astronomers' names are known, such as that of [[Kidinnu]], a [[Chaldean Dynasty|Chaldean]] astronomer and mathematician. Kiddinu's value for the solar year is in use for today's calendars. Babylonian astronomy was "the first and highly successful attempt at giving a refined mathematical description of astronomical phenomena." According to the historian A. Aaboe, "all subsequent varieties of scientific astronomy, in the Hellenistic world, in India, in Islam, and in the West—if not indeed all subsequent endeavour in the exact sciences—depend upon Babylonian astronomy in decisive and fundamental ways."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Scientific Astronomy in Antiquity |author=Aaboe, A. |journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]] |volume=276 |issue=1257|date=2 May 1974 |pages=21–42|ref=harv |doi=10.1098/rsta.1974.0007 |bibcode=1974RSPTA.276...21A |jstor=74272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egypt===
{{main|Egyptian astronomy|Egyptian mathematics|Egyptian medicine}}
[[Ancient Egypt]] made significant advances in astronomy, mathematics and medicine.&lt;ref name='odyssey'&gt;{{cite book |last=Homer|authorlink=Homer |title=The Odyssey |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |others=Translated by [[Walter Shewring]] |date=May 1998 |isbn= 978-0192833754 |quote=In Egypt, more than in other lands, the bounteous earth yields a wealth of drugs, healthful and baneful side by side; and every man there is a physician; the rest of the world has no such skill, for these are all of the family of Paeon. |page=40 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=rcjeZ-yxr5MC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their development of [[geometry]] was a necessary outgrowth of [[surveying]] to preserve the layout and ownership of farmland, which was flooded annually by the [[Nile river]]. The 3-4-5 [[right triangle]] and other rules of geometry were used to build rectilinear structures, and the post and lintel architecture of Egypt. Egypt was also a center of [[Alchemy#History|alchemy]] research for much of the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]]. The [[Edwin Smith papyrus]] is one of the first medical documents still extant, and perhaps the earliest document that attempts to describe and analyse the brain: it might be seen as the very beginnings of modern [[neuroscience]]. However, while [[Egyptian medicine]] had some effective practices, it was often ineffective and sometimes harmful. Medical historians believe that ancient Egyptian pharmacology, for example, was largely ineffective.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.hom.ucalgary.ca/Dayspapers2001.pdf Microsoft Word – Proceedings-2001.doc&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080407062556/http://www.hom.ucalgary.ca/Dayspapers2001.pdf |date=7 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, it applied the following components to the treatment of disease: examination, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Edwin-Smith-papyrus |title=Edwin Smith papyrus: Egyptian medical book |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which display strong parallels to the basic [[empirical method]] of science and, according to G.E.R. Lloyd,&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, G.E.R.  "The development of empirical research", in his ''Magic, Reason and Experience: Studies in the Origin and Development of Greek Science''.&lt;/ref&gt; played a significant role in the development of this methodology. The [[Ebers papyrus]] (c. 1550 BC) also contains evidence of traditional [[empiricism]].

[[File:Plato's Academy mosaic from Pompeii.jpg|thumb|left|[[Plato's Academy]]. 1st century [[mosaic]] from [[Pompeii]]]]

In [[Classical antiquity|Classical Antiquity]], the inquiry into the workings of the universe took place both in investigations aimed at such practical goals as establishing a reliable calendar or determining how to cure a variety of illnesses and in those abstract investigations known as [[natural philosophy]]. The ancient people who are considered the first ''[[scientists]]'' may have thought of themselves as ''natural philosophers'', as practitioners of a skilled profession (for example, physicians), or as followers of a religious tradition (for example, temple healers).

The earliest Greek philosophers, known as the [[pre-Socratics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sambursky|1974|pp=3,37}} called the pre-Socratics the transition from ''[[Mythology|mythos]]'' to ''[[logos]]''&lt;/ref&gt; provided competing answers to the question found in the myths of their neighbors: "How did the ordered [[cosmos]] in which we live come to be?"&lt;ref&gt;[[F.M. Cornford]], ''Principium Sapientiae: The Origins of Greek Philosophical Thought'', (Gloucester, Massachusetts, Peter Smith, 1971), p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; The pre-Socratic philosopher [[Thales]] (640–546 BC), dubbed the "father of science", was the first to postulate non-supernatural explanations for natural phenomena. For example, that land floats on water and that earthquakes are caused by the agitation of the water upon which the land floats, rather than the god Poseidon.&lt;ref&gt;Arieti, James A. ''Philosophy in the ancient world: an introduction'', p. 45 [https://books.google.com/?id=L0w6kvdKJ8QC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=thales+earthquakes&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8nb_TqSrFuGmiQKq0siMCA&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=thales%20earthquakes&amp;f=false]. Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2005. 386 pp. {{ISBN|978-0742533295}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thales' student [[Pythagoras]] of [[Samos]] founded the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean school]], which investigated mathematics for its own sake, and was the first to postulate that the Earth is spherical in shape.&lt;ref name="dicks"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dicks |first=D.R. |title=Early Greek Astronomy to Aristotle |pages=72–198 |year=1970 |isbn=978-0801405617 |publisher=Cornell University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Leucippus]] (5th century BC) introduced [[atomism]], the theory that all matter is made of indivisible, imperishable units called [[atoms]].  This was greatly expanded on by his pupil [[Democritus]] and later [[Epicurus]].

Subsequently, [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] produced the first systematic discussions of natural philosophy, which did much to shape later investigations of nature. Their development of [[deductive reasoning]] was of particular importance and usefulness to later scientific inquiry.  Plato founded the [[Platonic Academy]] in 387 BC, whose motto was "Let none unversed in geometry enter here", and turned out many notable philosophers.  Plato's student Aristotle introduced [[empiricism]] and the notion that universal truths can be arrived at via observation and induction, thereby laying the foundations of the scientific method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=De Lacy |last=O'Leary |authorlink=De Lacy O'Leary |year=1949 |title=How Greek Science Passed to the Arabs |publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul  |isbn=978-0-7100-1903-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Aristotle also produced [[Aristotle's biology|many biological writings]] that were empirical in nature, focusing on biological causation and the diversity of life. He made countless observations of nature, especially the habits and attributes of plants and animals on [[Lesbos]], classified more than 540 animal species, and dissected at least 50.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Armand Marie Leroi |last=Leroi |first=Armand Marie |title=The Lagoon: How Aristotle Invented Science |titlelink=Aristotle's Lagoon |publisher=Bloomsbury |date=2015 |isbn=978-1408836224 |page=7–}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Aristotle's writings profoundly influenced subsequent [[Science in medieval Islam|Islamic]] and [[Science in Medieval Western Europe|European]] scholarship, though they were eventually superseded in the [[Scientific Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP|url-id=aristotle-influence|title=Aristotle's Influence|date=2018|edition=Spring 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barnes |first1=Jonathan |authorlink=Jonathan Barnes |title=Aristotle: A Very Short Introduction |date=1982 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=86 |isbn=978-0192854087}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Archimedes pi.svg|thumb|upright=1.5&lt;!--fmt low-aspect image--&gt;|Archimedes used the [[method of exhaustion]] to approximate the value of [[pi|π]].]]

The important legacy of this period included substantial advances in factual knowledge, especially in [[anatomy]], [[zoology]], [[botany]], [[mineralogy]], [[geography]], [[mathematics]] and [[astronomy]]; an awareness of the importance of certain scientific problems, especially those related to the problem of change and its causes; and a recognition of the methodological importance of applying mathematics to natural phenomena and of undertaking empirical research.&lt;ref&gt;[[G.E.R. Lloyd]], ''Early Greek Science: Thales to Aristotle'', (New York: W.W. Norton, 1970), pp. 144–146.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Hellenistic age]] scholars frequently employed the principles developed in earlier Greek thought: the application of [[mathematics]] and deliberate empirical research, in their scientific investigations.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd (1973), p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, clear unbroken lines of influence lead from ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenistic philosophers]], to medieval [[Early Islamic philosophy|Muslim philosophers]] and [[Islamic science|scientists]], to the European [[Renaissance]] and [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], to the secular [[science]]s of the modern day.
Neither reason nor inquiry began with the Ancient Greeks, but the [[Socratic method]] did, along with the idea of [[Substantial form|Forms]], great advances in [[geometry]], [[logic]], and the natural sciences. According to [[Benjamin Farrington]], former Professor of [[Classics]] at [[Swansea University]]:
:"Men were weighing for thousands of years before [[Archimedes]] worked out the laws of equilibrium; they must have had practical and intuitional knowledge of the principles involved. What Archimedes did was to sort out the theoretical implications of this practical knowledge and present the resulting body of knowledge as a logically coherent system."

and again:

:"With astonishment we find ourselves on the threshold of modern science. Nor should it be supposed that by some trick of translation the extracts have been given an air of modernity. Far from it. The vocabulary of these writings and their style are the source from which our own vocabulary and style have been derived."&lt;ref&gt;''Greek Science'', many editions, such as the paperback by Penguin Books. Copyrights in 1944, 1949, 1953, 1961, 1963. The first quote above comes from Part 1, Chapter 1; the second, from Part 2, Chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Antikythera mechanism.svg|thumb|upright|Schematic of the [[Antikythera mechanism]] (150–100 BC).]]

The astronomer [[Aristarchus of Samos]] was the first known person to propose a heliocentric model of the solar system, while the geographer [[Eratosthenes]] accurately calculated the circumference of the Earth. [[Hipparchus]] (c. 190&amp;nbsp;– c. 120 BC) produced the first systematic [[Timeline of astronomical maps, catalogs, and surveys|star catalog]].  The level of achievement in Hellenistic [[astronomy]] and [[engineering]] is impressively shown by the [[Antikythera mechanism]] (150–100 BC), an [[analog computer]] for calculating the position of planets.  Technological artifacts of similar complexity did not reappear until the 14th century, when mechanical [[astronomical clock]]s appeared in Europe.&lt;ref name=insearchoflosttime&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Marchant | first1=Jo | year=2006 | title=In search of lost time | url=| journal=Nature | volume=444 | issue=7119| pages=534–538 | doi=10.1038/444534a | pmid=17136067 | bibcode=2006Natur.444..534M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[medicine]], [[Hippocrates]] (c. 460 BC&amp;nbsp;– c. 370 BC) and his followers were the first to describe many diseases and medical conditions and developed the [[Hippocratic Oath]] for physicians, still relevant and in use today. [[Herophilos]] (335–280 BC) was the first to base his conclusions on dissection of the human body and to describe the [[nervous system]]. [[Galen]] (129&amp;nbsp;– c. 200 AD) performed many audacious operations—including brain and eye [[surgery|surgeries]]— that were not tried again for almost two millennia.

In [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Hellenistic Egypt]], the mathematician [[Euclid]] laid down the foundations of [[mathematical rigor]] and introduced the concepts of definition, axiom, theorem and proof still in use today in his [[Euclid's elements|''Elements'']], considered the most influential textbook ever written.&lt;ref name="Boyer Influence of the Elements"&gt;{{cite book |last=Boyer |authorlink=Carl Benjamin Boyer |title=A History of Mathematics |year=1991|chapter=Euclid of Alexandria|page=119|quote=The ''Elements'' of Euclid not only was the earliest major Greek mathematical work to come down to us, but also the most influential textbook of all times.

[[Theophrastus]] wrote some of the earliest descriptions of plants and animals, establishing the first [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] and looking at minerals in terms of their properties such as [[hardness]]. [[Pliny the Elder]] produced what is one of the largest [[encyclopedia]]s of the natural world in 77 AD, and must be regarded as the rightful successor to Theophrastus.  For example, he accurately describes the [[octahedral]] shape of the [[diamond]], and proceeds to mention that diamond dust is used by [[engraver]]s to cut and polish other gems owing to its great hardness. His recognition of the importance of [[crystal]] shape is a precursor to modern [[crystallography]], while mention of numerous other minerals presages [[mineralogy]]. He also recognises that other minerals have characteristic crystal shapes, but in one example, confuses the [[crystal habit]] with the work of [[lapidaries]]. He was also the first to recognise that [[amber]] was a fossilized resin from pine trees because he had seen samples with trapped insects within them.

'''Mathematics:''' The earliest traces of mathematical knowledge in the Indian subcontinent appear with the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] (c. 4th millennium BC ~ c. 3rd millennium BC).  The people of this civilization made bricks whose dimensions were in the proportion 4:2:1, considered favorable for the stability of a brick structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/Projects/Pearce/Chapters/Ch3.html|title=3: Early Indian culture – Indus civilisation|work=st-and.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They also tried to standardize measurement of length to a high degree of accuracy. They designed a ruler—the ''Mohenjo-daro ruler''—whose unit of length (approximately 1.32&amp;nbsp;inches or 3.4 centimetres) was divided into ten equal parts.  Bricks manufactured in ancient Mohenjo-daro often had dimensions that were integral multiples of this unit of length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bisht |first=R.S.|year=1982|chapter=Excavations at Banawali: 1974–77|editor=Possehl, Gregory L. |title=Harappan Civilization: A Contemporary Perspective|pages=113–124 |publisher=Oxford and IBH Publishing Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian astronomer and mathematician [[Aryabhata]] (476–550), in his ''[[Aryabhatiya]]'' (499) introduced a number of [[trigonometric functions]] (including [[sine]], [[versine]], [[cosine]] and [[inverse sine]]), [[trigonometry|trigonometric]] [[Aryabhata's sine table|tables]], and techniques and [[algorithm]]s of [[algebra]].

'''Astronomy:''' The first textual mention of astronomical concepts comes from the [[Veda]]s, religious literature of India.&lt;ref name=Sarma-Ast-Ind&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last =Sarma|first = K.V.|date = 2008 |encyclopedia = Encyclopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Western Cultures|editor-last = Selin|editor-first = Helaine|doi= 10.1007/978-1-4020-4425-0_9554|publisher = Springer, Dordrecht|isbn = 978-1-4020-4425-0|pages = 317–321|chapter = Astronomy in India}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sarma (2008): "One finds in the [[Rigveda]] intelligent speculations about the genesis of the universe from nonexistence, the configuration of the universe, the [[Spherical Earth|spherical self-supporting earth]], and the year of 360 days divided into 12 equal parts of 30 days each with a periodical intercalary month.".&lt;ref name=Sarma-Ast-Ind/&gt; The first 12 chapters of the ''Siddhanta Shiromani'', written by [[Bhāskara II|Bhāskara]] in the 12th century, cover topics such as: mean longitudes of the planets; true longitudes of the planets; the three problems of diurnal rotation; syzygies; lunar eclipses; solar eclipses; latitudes of the planets; risings and settings; the moon's crescent; conjunctions of the planets with each other; conjunctions of the planets with the fixed stars; and the patas of the sun and moon. The 13 chapters of the second part cover the nature of the sphere, as well as significant astronomical and trigonometric calculations based on it.

[[Nilakantha Somayaji]]'s astronomical treatise the [[Tantrasangraha]] similar in nature to the [[Tychonic system]] proposed by [[Tycho Brahe]] had been the most accurate astronomical model until the time of [[Johannes Kepler]] in the 17th century.&lt;ref name=Joseph&gt;George G.

'''Linguistics:''' Some of the earliest linguistic activities can be found in [[Iron Age India]] (1st millennium BC) with the analysis of [[Sanskrit]] for the purpose of the correct recitation and interpretation of [[Vedas|Vedic]] texts. The most notable grammarian of [[Sanskrit]] was {{IAST|[[Pāṇini]]}} (c. 520–460 BC), whose grammar formulates close to 4,000 rules which together form a compact [[generative grammar]] of Sanskrit. Inherent in his analytic approach are the concepts of the [[phoneme]], the [[morpheme]] and the [[root]].

Its most famous text is the [[Sushruta Samhita|Suśrutasamhitā]] of [[Sushruta|Suśruta]], which is notable for describing procedures on various forms of [[surgery]], including [[rhinoplasty]], the repair of torn ear lobes, perineal [[lithotomy]], cataract surgery, and several other excisions and other surgical procedures.

'''Metallurgy:''' The [[wootz steel|wootz]], [[crucible steel|crucible]] and [[stainless steel|stainless]] [[steels]] were invented in India, and were widely exported in Classic Mediterranean world. It was known from [[Pliny the Elder]] as ''ferrum indicum''. Indian Wootz steel was held in high regard in Roman Empire, was often considered to be the best. After in Middle Age it was imported in Syria to produce with special techniques the "[[Damascus steel]]" by the year 1000.&lt;ref&gt;C.S.

[[File:Sea island survey.jpg|thumb|upright|Lui Hui's Survey of sea island]]
'''Mathematics''': From the earliest the Chinese used a positional decimal system on counting boards in order to calculate. To express 10, a single rod is placed in the second box from the right. The spoken language uses a similar system to English: e.g. four thousand two hundred seven. No symbol was used for zero. By the 1st century BC, negative numbers and decimal fractions were in use and ''[[The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art]]'' included methods for extracting higher order roots by [[Horner's method]] and solving linear equations and by [[Pythagorean theorem|Pythagoras' theorem]]. Cubic equations were solved in the [[Tang dynasty]] and solutions of equations of order higher than 3 appeared in print in 1245 AD by [[Ch'in Chiu-shao]]. [[Pascal's triangle]] for binomial coefficients was described around 1100 by [[Jia Xian]].

Although the first attempts at an axiomatisation of geometry appear in the [[Mohist]] canon in 330 BC, [[Liu Hui]] developed algebraic methods in geometry in the 3rd century AD and also calculated [[pi]] to 5 significant figures. In 480, [[Zu Chongzhi]] improved this by discovering the ratio &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{355}{113}&lt;/math&gt; which remained the most accurate value for 1200 years.

''Science and Civilization in China: Volume 3, Mathematics and the Sciences of the Heavens and the Earth''. Taipei: Caves Books Ltd. p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Astronomy''': Astronomical observations from China constitute the longest continuous sequence from any civilisation and include records of sunspots (112 records from 364 BC), supernovas (1054), lunar and solar eclipses. By the 12th century, they could reasonably accurately make predictions of eclipses, but the knowledge of this was lost during the Ming dynasty, so that the Jesuit [[Matteo Ricci]] gained much favour in 1601 by his predictions.&lt;ref&gt;Needham p422&lt;/ref&gt;
By 635 Chinese astronomers had observed that the tails of comets always point away from the sun.

From antiquity, the Chinese used an equatorial system for describing the skies and a star map from 940 was drawn using a cylindrical ([[Mercator projection|Mercator]]) projection. The use of an [[armillary sphere]] is recorded from the 4th century BC and a sphere permanently mounted in equatorial axis from 52 BC. In 125 AD [[Zhang Heng]] used water power to rotate the sphere in real time. This included rings for the meridian and ecliptic. By 1270 they had incorporated the principles of the Arab [[torquetum]].

'''Seismology''': To better prepare for calamities, Zhang Heng invented a [[seismometer]] in 132 CE which provided instant alert to authorities in the capital Luoyang that an earthquake had occurred in a location indicated by a specific [[Cardinal direction|cardinal or ordinal direction]].&lt;ref&gt;de Crespigny (2007), 1050; Morton &amp; Lewis (2005), 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Although no tremors could be felt in the capital when Zhang told the court that an earthquake had just occurred in the northwest, a message came soon afterwards that an earthquake had indeed struck 400&amp;nbsp;km (248&amp;nbsp;mi) to 500&amp;nbsp;km (310&amp;nbsp;mi) northwest of Luoyang (in what is now modern [[Gansu]]).&lt;ref&gt;Minford &amp; Lau (2002), 307; Balchin (2003), 26–27; Needham (1986a), 627; Needham (1986c), 484; Krebs (2003), 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Zhang called his device the 'instrument for measuring the seasonal winds and the movements of the Earth' (Houfeng didong yi 候风地动仪), so-named because he and others thought that earthquakes were most likely caused by the enormous compression of trapped air.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 626"&gt;Needham (1986a), 626.&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Zhang Heng#Zhang's seismometer|Zhang's seismometer]] for further details.

There are many notable contributors to the field of Chinese science throughout the ages. One of the best examples would be [[Shen Kuo]] (1031–1095), a [[polymath]] scientist and statesman who was the first to describe the [[magnetic]]-needle [[compass]] used for [[navigation]], discovered the concept of [[true north]], improved the design of the astronomical [[gnomon]], [[armillary sphere]], [[sight tube]], and [[water clock|clepsydra]], and described the use of [[drydock]]s to repair boats. After observing the natural process of the inundation of [[silt]] and the find of [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] [[fossil]]s in the [[Taihang Mountains]] (hundreds of miles from the Pacific Ocean), Shen Kuo devised a theory of land formation, or [[geomorphology]]. He also adopted a theory of gradual [[climate change]] in regions over time, after observing [[petrified]] [[bamboo]] found underground at [[Yan'an]], [[Shaanxi]] province. If not for Shen Kuo's writing,&lt;ref&gt;[[Shen Kuo]] 沈括 (1086, last supplement dated 1091), ''Meng Ch'i Pi Than (夢溪筆談, [[Dream Pool Essays]])'' as cited in {{harvnb|Needham|2004}} p. 244&lt;/ref&gt; the architectural works of [[Yu Hao]] would be little known, along with the inventor of [[movable type]] [[printing]], [[Bi Sheng]] (990–1051). Shen's contemporary [[Su Song]] (1020–1101) was also a brilliant polymath, an astronomer who created a celestial atlas of star maps, wrote a pharmaceutical treatise with related subjects of [[botany]], [[zoology]], [[mineralogy]], and [[metallurgy]], and had erected a large [[astronomical]] [[clocktower]] in [[Kaifeng]] city in 1088. To operate the crowning [[armillary sphere]], his clocktower featured an [[escapement]] mechanism and the world's oldest known use of an endless power-transmitting [[chain drive]].

The [[Jesuit China missions]] of the 16th and 17th centuries "learned to appreciate the scientific achievements of this ancient culture and made them known in Europe. Through their correspondence European scientists first learned about the Chinese science and culture."&lt;ref&gt;Agustín Udías, ''Searching the Heavens and the Earth: The History of Jesuit Observatories''. (Dordrecht, The Netherlands: Kluwer Academic Publishers, 2003). p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; Western academic thought on the history of Chinese technology and science was galvanized by the work of [[Joseph Needham]] and the Needham Research Institute. Among the technological accomplishments of China were, according to the British scholar Needham, early [[seismometer|seismological]] detectors ([[Zhang Heng]] in the 2nd century), the [[hydraulics|water-powered]] [[celestial globe]] (Zhang Heng), [[match]]es, the independent invention of the [[decimal|decimal system]], [[dry dock#Graving|dry docks]], sliding [[calipers]], the double-action [[piston pump]], [[cast iron]], the [[blast furnace]], the [[iron]] [[plough]], the multi-tube [[seed drill]], the [[wheelbarrow]], the [[suspension bridge]], the [[winnowing machine]], the [[Mechanical fan|rotary fan]], the [[parachute]], [[natural gas]] as fuel, the [[raised-relief map]], the [[propeller]], the [[crossbow]], and a solid fuel [[rocket]], the [[multistage rocket]], the [[horse collar]], along with contributions in [[logic]], [[astronomy]], [[medicine]], and other fields.

However, cultural factors prevented these Chinese achievements from developing into what we might call "modern science".  According to Needham, it may have been the religious and philosophical framework of Chinese intellectuals which made them unable to accept the ideas of laws of nature:
{{quote|It was not that there was no order in nature for the Chinese, but rather that it was not an order ordained by a rational personal being, and hence there was no conviction that rational personal beings would be able to spell out in their lesser earthly languages the divine code of laws which he had decreed aforetime. The [[Taoists]], indeed, would have scorned such an idea as being too naïve for the subtlety and complexity of the universe as they intuited it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Needham|1954}} 581.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==In the Middle Ages {{anchor|Science in the Middle Ages}}==
In the Middle Ages the classical learning continued in three major linguistic cultures and civilizations: Greek (the Byzantine Empire), Arabic (the Islamic world), and Latin (Western Europe).

Because of the collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]], the intellectual level in the western part of Europe declined [[Migration Period|in the 400s]]. In contrast, the [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern Roman]] or [[Byzantine Empire]] resisted the barbarian attacks, and preserved and improved the learning.&lt;ref&gt;Lindberg, David. (1992) ''The Beginnings of Western Science''. University of Chicago Press. p. 363.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the [[Byzantine Empire]] still held learning centers such as [[Constantinople]], Alexandria and Antioch, Western Europe's knowledge was concentrated in [[Monastery|monasteries]] until the development of [[Medieval university|medieval universities]] in the 12th centuries. The curriculum of monastic schools included the study of the few available ancient texts and of new works on practical subjects like medicine&lt;ref&gt;Linda E.

In the sixth century in the Byzantine Empire, Isidore of Miletus compiled Archimedes' mathematical works in the [[Archimedes Palimpsest]], where all Archimedes' mathematical contributions were collected and studied.

[[John Philoponus]], another Byzantine scholar, was the first to question Aristotle's teaching of physics, introducing the [[theory of impetus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=Philoponus, John|editor=Craig, Edward|year=1998|title=Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Volume 7, Nihilism-Quantum mechanics|pages=371–377, [https://books.google.com/books?id=0zPyhAxhDz8C&amp;pg=PA373 373]|isbn=978-0415187121}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Lindberg, David C. |year=2007|title=The Beginnings of Western Science: The European Scientific Tradition in Philosophical, Religious, and Institutional Context, Prehistory to A.D. 1450|edition=second|location=Chicago, Illinois|publisher=University of Chicago Press|page=307–308|isbn=978-0226482057}} Link to [https://books.google.com/books?id=dPUBAkIm2lUC&amp;pg=PA307 p. 307] from Google's copy of 2008 reprint.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of impetus was an auxiliary or secondary theory of Aristotelian dynamics, put forth initially to explain projectile motion against gravity.

The first record of separating conjoined twins took place in the [[Byzantine Empire]] in the 900s when the surgeons tried to separate a dead body of a pair of conjoined twins. The result was partly successful as the other twin managed to live for three days. The next recorded case of separating conjoined twins was several centuries later, in 1600s Germany.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.medievalists.net/2014/01/the-case-of-conjoined-twins-in-10th-century-byzantium/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://denysmontandon.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/conjoined-twins.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, a number of Greek scholars flee to North Italy in which they fueled the era later commonly known as "[[Renaissance]]” as they brought with them a great deal of classical learning including an understanding of botany, medicine, and zoology. Byzantium also gave the West important inputs: John Philoponus' criticism of Aristotelian physics, and the works of Dioscorides.&lt;ref&gt;Lindberg, David. (1992). The Beginnings of Western Science.

In the [[Middle East]], [[Greek philosophy]] was able to find some support under the newly created [[Caliphate|Arab Empire]]. With the [[spread of Islam]] in the 7th and 8th centuries, a period of [[Muslim]] scholarship, known as the [[Islamic Golden Age]], lasted until the 13th century. This scholarship was aided by several factors. The use of a single language, [[Arabic language|Arabic]], allowed communication without need of a translator. Access to [[Greek language|Greek]] texts from the [[Byzantine Empire]], along with [[History of India|Indian]] sources of learning, provided Muslim scholars a knowledge base to build upon.

[[Scientific method]] began developing in the Muslim world, where significant progress in methodology was made, beginning with the experiments of [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhazen) on [[optics]] from c. 1000, in his ''[[Book of Optics]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hZvL5eYAAAAJ&amp;hl Sameen Ahmed Khan], Arab Origins of the Discovery of the Refraction of Light; Roshdi Hifni Rashed (Picture) Awarded the 2007 King Faisal International Prize, Optics &amp; Photonics News (OPN, Logo), Vol. 18, No. 10, pp. 22–23 (October 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; The most important development of the scientific method was the use of experiments to distinguish between competing scientific theories set within a generally [[empiricism|empirical]] orientation, which began among Muslim scientists. Ibn al-Haytham is also regarded as the father of optics, especially for his empirical proof of the intromission theory of light. Some have also described Ibn al-Haytham as the "first scientist" for his development of the modern scientific method.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Al-Khalili |first=Jim |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7810846.stm |title=BBC News |publisher=BBC News |date=4 January 2009 |accessdate=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Islamic mathematics|mathematics]], the mathematician [[Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi]] (c. 780–850) gave his name to the concept of the [[algorithm]], while the term [[algebra]] is derived from ''al-jabr'', the beginning of the title of one of his publications.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerald J.

In [[Islamic astronomy|astronomy]], [[Al-Battani]] (c. 858–929) improved the measurements of [[Hipparchus]], preserved in the translation of [[Ptolemy]]'s ''Hè Megalè Syntaxis'' (''The great treatise'') translated as ''[[Almagest]]''.

[[Alchemy (Islam)|Muslim chemists and alchemists]] played an important role in the foundation of modern [[chemistry]]. Scholars such as [[Will Durant]]&lt;ref name=Durant&gt;[[Will Durant]] (1980). ''The Age of Faith ([[The Story of Civilization]], Volume 4)'', pp. 162–186. Simon &amp; Schuster. {{ISBN|0671012002}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Fielding H. Garrison]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Fielding H.

By the eleventh century, most of Europe had become Christian; stronger monarchies emerged; borders were restored; technological developments and agricultural innovations were made, increasing the food supply and population. Classical Greek texts were translated from Arabic and Greek into Latin, stimulating scientific discussion in Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Lindberg, David. (1992) ''The Beginnings of Western Science''  University of Chicago Press. p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt;

An intellectual revitalization of Western Europe started with the birth of [[Medieval university|medieval universities]] in the 12th century. Contact with the Byzantine Empire,&lt;ref name=Lindberg1992p162/&gt; and with the Islamic world during the [[Reconquista]] and the [[Crusades]], allowed Latin Europe access to scientific [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] texts, including the works of [[Aristotle]], [[Ptolemy]], [[Isidore of Miletus]], [[John Philoponus]], [[Jābir ibn Hayyān]], [[Muhammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī|al-Khwarizmi]], [[Ibn al-Haytham|Alhazen]], [[Avicenna]], and [[Averroes]]. European scholars had access to the translation programs of [[Raymond of Toledo]], who sponsored the 12th century [[Toledo School of Translators]] from Arabic to Latin. Later translators like [[Michael Scotus]] would learn Arabic in order to study these texts directly. The European universities aided materially in the [[Latin translations of the 12th century|translation and propagation of these texts]] and started a new infrastructure which was needed for scientific communities. In fact, European university put many works about the natural world and the study of nature at the center of its curriculum,&lt;ref&gt;Huff, Toby. ''Rise of early modern science'' 2nd ed. pp. 180–181&lt;/ref&gt; with the result that the "medieval university laid far greater emphasis on science than does its modern counterpart and descendent."&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Edward. "Science in the Medieval University", in James M. Kittleson and Pamela J. Transue, ed., ''Rebirth, Reform and Resilience: Universities in Transition, 1300–1700'', Ohio State University Press, 1984, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[classical antiquity]], Greek and Roman taboos had meant that dissection was usually banned, but in the Middle Ages medical teachers and students at Bologna began to open human bodies, and [[Mondino de Luzzi]] (c. 1275–1326) produced the ﬁrst known anatomy textbook based on human dissection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674057418 |last=Numbers |first=Ronald |title=Galileo Goes to Jail and Other Myths about Science and Religion|pages=45|publisher= Harvard University Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-0674033276}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2011/04/debunking-a-myth/ |title=Debunking a myth |date=7 April 2011 |publisher=Harvard University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the [[Pax Mongolica]], Europeans, such as [[Marco Polo]], began to venture further and further east. This led to the increased awareness of Indian and even Chinese culture and civilization within the European tradition. Technological advances were also made, such as the early flight of [[Eilmer of Malmesbury]] (who had studied Mathematics in 11th century England),&lt;ref name="Eilmer"&gt;[[William of Malmesbury]], ''[[Gesta Regum Anglorum]] / The history of the English kings'', ed. and trans.

At the beginning of the 13th century, there were reasonably accurate Latin translations of the main works of almost all the intellectually crucial ancient authors, allowing a sound transfer of scientific ideas via both the universities and the monasteries. By then, the natural philosophy in these texts began to be extended by [[Scholasticism|scholastics]] such as [[Robert Grosseteste]], [[Roger Bacon]], [[Albertus Magnus]] and [[Duns Scotus]]. Precursors of the modern scientific method, influenced by earlier contributions of the Islamic world, can be seen already in Grosseteste's emphasis on mathematics as a way to understand nature, and in the empirical approach admired by Bacon, particularly in his ''[[Opus Majus]]''.  [[Pierre Duhem]]'s thesis is that [[Stephen Tempier]] - the Bishop of Paris - [[Condemnation of 1277]] led to the study of medieval science as a serious discipline, "but no one in the field any longer endorses his view that modern science started in 1277".&lt;ref name="Stanford"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/condemnation/ |title=Condemnation of 1277 |author=Hans Thijssen |work=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |date=30 January 2003 |accessdate=14 September 2009 |publisher=[[University of Stanford]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many scholars agree with Duhem's view that the Middle Ages saw important scientific developments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biologos.org/blog/rediscovering-the-science-of-the-middle-ages |title=Rediscovering the Science of the Middle Ages |publisher=BioLogos}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icucourses.com/pages/023-a03-the-middle-ages-and-the-birth-of-science|title=023-A03: The Middle Ages and the Birth of Science – International Catholic University|work=International Catholic University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/news/history-a-medieval-multiverse-1.14837|title=History: A medieval multiverse|volume=507|issue=7491|pages=161–163|journal=Nature News &amp; Comment|doi=10.1038/507161a|year=2014|last1=McLeish|first1=Tom C.

The first half of the 14th century saw much important scientific work, largely within the framework of [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] commentaries on Aristotle's scientific writings.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Grant, ''The Foundations of Modern Science in the Middle Ages: Their Religious, Institutional, and Intellectual Contexts'', (Cambridge Univ.

Press, 1974), p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; and an intermediary "sensible species" is not needed to transmit an image of an object to the eye.&lt;ref&gt;David C. Lindberg, ''Theories of Vision from al-Kindi to Kepler'', (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Pr., 1976), pp. 140–142.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars such as [[Jean Buridan]] and [[Nicole Oresme]] started to reinterpret elements of Aristotle's mechanics. In particular, Buridan developed the theory that impetus was the cause of the motion of projectiles, which was a first step towards the modern concept of [[inertia]].&lt;ref&gt;Edward Grant, ''The Foundations of Modern Science in the Middle Ages: Their Religious, Institutional, and Intellectual Contexts'', (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1996), pp. 95–97.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Oxford Calculators]] began to mathematically analyze the [[kinematics]] of motion, making this analysis without considering the causes of motion.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Grant, ''The Foundations of Modern Science in the Middle Ages: Their Religious, Institutional, and Intellectual Contexts'', (Cambridge Univ. Press, 1996), pp. 100–103.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1348, the [[Black Death]] and other disasters sealed a sudden end to philosophic and scientific development. Yet, the rediscovery of ancient texts was stimulated by the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, when many [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] scholars sought refuge in the West. Meanwhile, the introduction of printing was to have great effect on European society. The facilitated dissemination of the printed word democratized learning and allowed ideas such as [[algebra]] to propagate more rapidly. These developments paved the way for the [[Scientific Revolution]], where scientific inquiry, halted at the start of the Black Death, resumed.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

The renewal of learning in Europe began with 12th century [[Scholasticism]]. The [[Northern Renaissance]] showed a decisive shift in focus from Aristoteleian natural philosophy to chemistry and the biological sciences (botany, anatomy, and medicine).&lt;ref&gt;[[Allen Debus]], ''Man and Nature in the Renaissance'', (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Pr., 1978).&lt;/ref&gt; Thus modern science in Europe was resumed in a period of great upheaval: the [[Protestant Reformation]] and [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Counter-Reformation]]; the discovery of the Americas by [[Christopher Columbus]]; the [[Fall of Constantinople]]; but also the re-discovery of Aristotle during the Scholastic period presaged large social and political changes. Thus, a suitable environment was created in which it became possible to question scientific doctrine, in much the same way that [[Martin Luther]] and [[John Calvin]] questioned religious doctrine. The works of [[Ptolemy]] (astronomy) and [[Galen]] (medicine) were found not always to match everyday observations. Work by [[Vesalius]] on human cadavers found problems with the Galenic view of anatomy.&lt;ref&gt;Precise titles of these landmark books can be found in the collections of the [[Library of Congress]]. A list of these titles can be found in {{harvnb|Bruno|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:GodfreyKneller-IsaacNewton-1689.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Isaac Newton]] initiated [[classical mechanics]] in [[physics]].]]

The willingness to question previously held truths and search for new answers resulted in a period of major scientific advancements, now known as the [[Scientific Revolution]]. The Scientific Revolution is traditionally held by most historians to have begun in 1543, when the books ''[[De humani corporis fabrica]]'' (''On the Workings of the Human Body'') by [[Andreas Vesalius]], and also ''[[De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium|De Revolutionibus]]'', by the astronomer [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], were first printed. The thesis of Copernicus' book was that the Earth moved around the Sun. The period culminated with the publication of the ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' in 1687 by [[Isaac Newton]], representative of the unprecedented growth of [[antiquarian science book|scientific publications]] throughout Europe.

Other significant scientific advances were made during this time by [[Galileo Galilei]], [[Edmond Halley]], [[Robert Hooke]], [[Christiaan Huygens]], [[Tycho Brahe]], [[Johannes Kepler]], [[Gottfried Leibniz]], and [[Blaise Pascal]]. In philosophy, major contributions were made by [[Francis Bacon (philosopher)|Francis Bacon]], Sir [[Thomas Browne]], [[René Descartes]], and [[Thomas Hobbes]]. The scientific method was also better developed as the modern way of thinking emphasized experimentation and reason over traditional considerations.

===Age of Enlightenment===

[[File:Painting of Volta by Bertini (photo).jpeg|thumb|[[Alessandro Volta]] demonstrates the first [[Electrochemical cell|electrical cell]] to [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]] in 1801.]]

The [[Age of Enlightenment]] was a European affair. The 17th century brought decisive steps towards modern science, which accelerated during the 18th century. Directly based on the works&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heilbron|2003}}, 741&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], [[Descartes]], [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]], the way was now clear to the development of modern [[mathematics]], [[physics]] and [[technology]]
by the generation of [[Benjamin Franklin]] (1706–1790), [[Leonhard Euler]] (1707–1783), [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] (1711–1765) and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] (1717–1783). [[Denis Diderot]]'s ''[[Encyclopédie]]'', published between 1751 and 1772 brought this new understanding to a wider audience. The impact of this process was not limited to science and technology, but affected [[history of philosophy|philosophy]] ([[Immanuel Kant]], [[David Hume]]), [[history of religion|religion]] (the increasingly significant impact of [[Relationship between religion and science|science upon religion]]), and society and politics in general ([[Adam Smith]], [[Voltaire]]). The [[early modern period]] is seen as a flowering of the European Renaissance, in what is often known as the [[Scientific Revolution]], viewed as a foundation of [[#Modern science|modern science]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, pp. 741–744 of {{harvnb|Heilbron|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Romanticism in science===
{{Main|Romanticism in science}}
The Romantic Movement of the early 19th century reshaped science by opening up new pursuits unexpected in the classical approaches of the Enlightenment. Major breakthroughs came in biology, especially in [[Darwinism|Darwin's theory of evolution]], as well as physics (electromagnetism), mathematics (non-Euclidean geometry, group theory) and chemistry (organic chemistry).  The decline of Romanticism occurred because a new movement, [[Positivism]], began to take hold of the ideals of the intellectuals after 1840 and lasted until about 1880.

==Modern science==
The [[scientific revolution]] established science as a source for the growth of knowledge.{{clarify|reason=a source for the growth of knowledge? It is knowledge.|date=December 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heilbron|2003}}, 741–743&lt;/ref&gt; During the 19th century, the practice of science became professionalized and institutionalized in ways that continued through the 20th century. As the role of scientific knowledge grew in society, it became incorporated with many aspects of the functioning of nation-states.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

====Physics====
{{Main|History of physics}}
[[File:Albert Einstein Head.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Albert Einstein]] ]]
[[File:James Clerk Maxwell profile.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[James Clerk Maxwell]]]]

The scientific revolution is a convenient boundary between ancient thought and classical physics. [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] revived the [[heliocentrism|heliocentric]] model of the solar system described by [[Aristarchus of Samos]]. This was followed by the first known model of planetary motion given by [[Johannes Kepler]] in the early 17th century, which proposed that the planets follow [[ellipse|elliptical]] orbits, with the Sun at one focus of the ellipse. [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] ("''Father of Modern Physics''") also made use of experiments to validate physical theories, a key element of the scientific method. [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]] did some of the earliest experiments with electricity and magnetism, establishing that the Earth itself is magnetic.

In 1687, [[Isaac Newton]] published the ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia Mathematica]]'', detailing two comprehensive and successful physical theories: [[Newton's laws of motion]], which led to classical mechanics; and [[gravity|Newton's Law of Gravitation]], which describes the fundamental force of gravity.

During the late 18th and early 19th century, the behavior of electricity and magnetism was studied by [[Luigi Galvani]], [[Giovanni Aldini]], [[Alessandro Volta]], [[Michael Faraday]], [[Georg Ohm]], and others. These studies led to the unification of the two phenomena into a single theory of [[electromagnetism]], by [[James Clerk Maxwell]] (known as [[Maxwell's equations]]).

The beginning of the 20th century brought the start of a revolution in physics. The long-held theories of Newton were shown not to be correct in all circumstances. Beginning in 1900, [[Max Planck]], [[Albert Einstein]], [[Niels Bohr]] and others developed quantum theories to explain various anomalous experimental results, by introducing discrete energy levels. Not only did quantum mechanics show that the laws of motion did not hold on small scales, but even more disturbingly, the theory of [[general relativity]], proposed by Einstein in 1915, showed that the fixed background of [[spacetime]], on which both [[Newtonian mechanics]] and [[special relativity]] depended, could not exist. In 1925, [[Werner Heisenberg]] and [[Erwin Schrödinger]] formulated [[quantum mechanics]], which explained the preceding quantum theories. The observation by [[Edwin Hubble]] in 1929 that the speed at which galaxies recede positively correlates with their distance, led to the understanding that the universe is expanding, and the formulation of the [[Big Bang]] theory by [[Georges Lemaître]].

[[File:Trinity Test Fireball 25ms.jpg|thumb|The [[atomic bomb]] ushered in "[[Big Science]]" in [[physics]].]]

In 1938 [[Otto Hahn]] and [[Fritz Strassmann]] discovered [[nuclear fission]] with radiochemical methods, and in 1939 [[Lise Meitner]] and [[Otto Robert Frisch]] wrote the first theoretical interpretation of the fission process, which was later improved by [[Niels Bohr]] and [[John A. Wheeler]]. Further developments took place during World War II, which led to the practical application of [[radar]] and the development and use of the [[atomic bomb]]. Around this time, [[Chien-Shiung Wu]] was recruited by the [[Manhattan Project]] to help develop a process for separating uranium metal into U-235 and U-238 isotopes by [[Gaseous diffusion]].&lt;ref&gt;Ronald K. Smeltzer. “Chien-Shiung Wu.” Atomic Heritage Foundation, https://www.atomicheritage.org/profile/chien-shiung-wu. Accessed 26 Oct. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; She was an expert experimentalist in beta decay and weak interaction physics.&lt;ref name="biography.com"&gt;Biography.com Editors. “Chien-Shiung Wu.” Biography.com, 2 June 2016, https://www.biography.com/people/chien-shiung-wu-053116.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garwin, Richard L., and Tsung-Dao Lee. “Chien‐Shiung Wu.” Physics Today, vol. 50, no. 10, 1997, p. 130. world, physicstoday.scitation.org, doi:10.1063/1.2806727.&lt;/ref&gt; Wu designed an experiment (see [[Wu experiment]]) that enabled theoretical physicists [[Tsung-Dao Lee]] and [[Chen-Ning Yang]] to disprove the law of parity experimentally, winning them a Nobel Prize in 1957.&lt;ref name="biography.com"/&gt;

Though the process had begun with the invention of the [[cyclotron]] by [[Ernest O. Lawrence]] in the 1930s, physics in the postwar period entered into a phase of what historians have called "[[Big Science]]", requiring massive machines, budgets, and laboratories in order to test their theories and move into new frontiers. The primary patron of physics became state governments, who recognized that the support of "basic" research could often lead to technologies useful to both military and industrial applications.

Currently, general relativity and quantum mechanics are inconsistent with each other, and efforts are underway to unify the two.

====Chemistry====
{{Main|History of chemistry}}
[[File:DIMendeleevCab.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Dmitri Mendeleev]]]]
Modern chemistry emerged from the sixteenth through the eighteenth centuries through the material practices and theories promoted by alchemy, medicine, manufacturing and mining.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |editor=Eddy, Matthew Daniel |editor2= Mauskopf, Seymour |editor3=Newman, William R. |title=Chemical Knowledge in the Early Modern World|journal= Osiris |volume= 29 |date=2014|pages=1–15|url=https://www.academia.edu/6629576|last1= Newman |first1= William R. |last2= Mauskopf |first2= Seymour H. |last3= Eddy |first3= Matthew Daniel |pmid= 26103744 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A decisive moment came when 'chemistry' was distinguished from [[alchemy]] by [[Robert Boyle]] in his work ''The Sceptical Chymist'', in 1661; although the alchemical tradition continued for some time after his work.  Other important steps included the gravimetric experimental practices of medical chemists like [[William Cullen]], [[Joseph Black]], [[Torbern Bergman]] and [[Pierre Macquer]] and through the work of [[Antoine Lavoisier]] ([[Father or mother of something|''Father of Modern Chemistry'']]) on [[oxygen]] and the law of [[conservation of mass]], which refuted [[phlogiston theory]]. The theory that all matter is made of atoms, which are the smallest constituents of matter that cannot be broken down without losing the basic chemical and physical properties of that matter, was provided by [[John Dalton]] in 1803, although the question took a hundred years to settle as proven. Dalton also formulated the law of mass relationships. In 1869, [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] composed his [[periodic table]] of elements on the basis of Dalton's discoveries.

The synthesis of [[urea]] by [[Friedrich Wöhler]] opened a new research field, [[organic chemistry]], and by the end of the 19th century, scientists were able to synthesize hundreds of organic compounds. The later part of the 19th century saw the exploitation of the Earth's petrochemicals, after the exhaustion of the oil supply from [[whaling]]. By the 20th century, systematic production of refined materials provided a ready supply of products which provided not only energy, but also synthetic materials for clothing, medicine, and everyday disposable resources. Application of the techniques of organic chemistry to living organisms resulted in [[physiological chemistry]], the precursor to [[biochemistry]]. The 20th century also saw the integration of physics and chemistry, with chemical properties explained as the result of the electronic structure of the atom. [[Linus Pauling]]'s book on ''The Nature of the Chemical Bond'' used the principles of quantum mechanics to deduce [[bond angle]]s in ever-more complicated molecules. Pauling's work culminated in the physical modelling of [[DNA]], ''the secret of life'' (in the words of [[Francis Crick]], 1953). In the same year, the [[Miller–Urey experiment]] demonstrated in a simulation of primordial processes, that basic constituents of proteins, simple [[amino acid]]s, could themselves be built up from simpler molecules.

====Geology====
{{Main|History of geology}}
Geology existed as a cloud of isolated, disconnected ideas about rocks, minerals, and landforms long before it became a coherent science. [[Theophrastus]]' work on rocks, ''Peri lithōn'', remained authoritative for millennia: its interpretation of fossils was not overturned until after the Scientific Revolution. Chinese polymath [[Shen Kua]] (1031–1095) first formulated hypotheses for the process of land formation. Based on his observation of fossils in a geological [[stratum]] in a mountain hundreds of miles from the ocean, he deduced that the land was formed by erosion of the mountains and by [[Deposition (sediment)|deposition]] of silt.

[[File:Wegener.jpg|thumb|left|[[Plate tectonics]]—[[seafloor spreading]] and [[continental drift]] illustrated on a relief globe]]

Geology did not undergo systematic restructuring during the [[Scientific Revolution]], but individual theorists made important contributions. [[Robert Hooke]], for example, formulated a theory of earthquakes, and [[Nicholas Steno]] developed the theory of [[Law of superposition|superposition]] and argued that [[fossils]] were the remains of once-living creatures. Beginning with [[Thomas Burnet]]'s ''Sacred Theory of the Earth'' in 1681, natural philosophers began to explore the idea that the Earth had changed over time. Burnet and his contemporaries interpreted Earth's past in terms of events described in the Bible, but their work laid the intellectual foundations for secular interpretations of Earth history.

[[File:Hutton James portrait Raeburn.jpg|thumb|upright|[[James Hutton]], the father of modern geology]]

Modern geology, like modern chemistry, gradually evolved during the 18th and early 19th centuries. [[Benoît de Maillet]] and the [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Comte de Buffon]] saw the Earth as much older than the 6,000 years envisioned by biblical scholars. [[Jean-Étienne Guettard]] and [[Nicolas Desmarest]] hiked central France and recorded their observations on some of the first geological maps.  Aided by chemical experimentation, naturalists such as Scotland's [[John Walker (natural historian)|John Walker]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Matthew Daniel Eddy|title=The Language of Mineralogy: John Walker, Chemistry and the Edinburgh Medical School 1750–1800|date=2008|publisher=Ashgate|url=https://www.academia.edu/1112014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweden's Torbern Bergman, and Germany's [[Abraham Werner]] created comprehensive classification systems for rocks and minerals—a collective achievement that transformed geology into a cutting edge field by the end of the eighteenth century.  These early geologists also proposed a generalized interpretations of Earth history that led [[James Hutton]], [[Georges Cuvier]] and [[Alexandre Brongniart]], following in the steps of  [[Nicolas Steno|Steno]], to argue that layers of rock could be dated by the fossils they contained: a principle first applied to the geology of the Paris Basin. The use of [[index fossil]]s became a powerful tool for making geological maps, because it allowed geologists to correlate the rocks in one locality with those of similar age in other, distant localities. Over the first half of the 19th century, geologists such as [[Charles Lyell]], [[Adam Sedgwick]], and [[Roderick Murchison]] applied the new technique to rocks throughout Europe and eastern North America, setting the stage for more detailed, government-funded mapping projects in later decades.

Midway through the 19th century, the focus of geology shifted from description and classification to attempts to understand ''how'' the surface of the Earth had changed. The first comprehensive theories of mountain building were proposed during this period, as were the first modern theories of earthquakes and volcanoes. [[Louis Agassiz]] and others established the reality of continent-covering [[ice age]]s, and "fluvialists" like [[Andrew Crombie Ramsay]] argued that river valleys were formed, over millions of years by the rivers that flow through them. After the discovery of [[radioactivity]], [[radiometric dating]] methods were developed, starting in the 20th century. [[Alfred Wegener]]'s theory of "continental drift" was widely dismissed when he proposed it in the 1910s, but new data gathered in the 1950s and 1960s led to the theory of [[plate tectonics]], which provided a plausible mechanism for it. Plate tectonics also provided a unified explanation for a wide range of seemingly unrelated geological phenomena. Since 1970 it has served as the unifying principle in geology.

Geologists' embrace of [[plate tectonics]] became part of a broadening of the field from a study of rocks into a study of the Earth as a planet. Other elements of this transformation include: geophysical studies of the interior of the Earth, the grouping of geology with [[meteorology]] and [[oceanography]] as one of the "earth sciences", and comparisons of Earth and the solar system's other rocky planets.

====Astronomy====
{{Main|History of astronomy}}
[[Aristarchus of Samos]] published [[Aristarchus On the Sizes and Distances|work]] on how to determine the sizes and distances of the Sun and the Moon, and [[Eratosthenes]] used this work to figure the size of the Earth. [[Hipparchus]] later discovered the [[precession (astronomy)|precession]] of the Earth.

Advances in astronomy and in optical systems in the 19th century resulted in the first observation of an [[asteroid]] ([[Ceres (dwarf planet)|1 Ceres]]) in 1801, and the discovery of [[Neptune]] in 1846.

In 1925, [[Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin]] determined that stars were composed mostly of Hydrogen and Helium.&lt;ref&gt;Erik Gregersen. “Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin | American Astronomer.” Encyclopædia Britannica, https://www.britannica.com/biography/Cecilia-Payne-Gaposchkin.&lt;/ref&gt; She was dissuaded by astronomer [[Henry Norris Russell]] from publishing this finding in her Ph.D.thesis because of the widely held belief that stars had the same composition as the Earth.&lt;ref name="newn.cam.ac.uk"&gt;Rachael Padman. “Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin (1900–1979).” Newnham College Biographies, 2004, http://www.newn.cam.ac.uk/about/history/biographies/.&lt;/ref&gt; However, four years later, in 1929, [[Henry Norris Russell]] came to the same conclusion through different reasoning and the discovery was eventually accepted.&lt;ref name="newn.cam.ac.uk"/&gt;

[[George Gamow]], [[Ralph Alpher]], and [[Robert Herman]] had calculated that there should be evidence for a Big Bang in the background temperature of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Alpher | first1=Ralph A. | last2=Herman | first2= Robert| year =1948 | title=Evolution of the Universe| url=| journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume=162  | issue=4124| pages=774–775 | doi=10.1038/162774b0 | bibcode=1948Natur.162..774A | ref=harv}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Gamow | first1=G. | doi=10.1038/162680a0 | title=The Evolution of the Universe | pmid=18893719 | journal=Nature | year=1948 | volume=162 | issue=4122 | pages=680–682 | bibcode=1948Natur.162..680G | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, [[Arno Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson|Robert Wilson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/physics/laureates/1978/wilson-lecture.pdf|format=PDF|title=Wilson's 1978 Nobel lecture|website=nobelprize.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; discovered a 3&amp;nbsp;Kelvin background hiss in their [[Bell Labs]] [[radiotelescope]] (the [[Holmdel Horn Antenna]]), which was evidence for this hypothesis, and formed the basis for a number of results that helped determine the [[age of the universe]].

Supernova [[SN1987A]] was observed by astronomers on Earth both visually, and in a triumph for [[neutrino astronomy]], by the solar neutrino detectors at [[Kamiokande]]. But the solar neutrino flux was [[solar neutrino problem|a fraction of its theoretically expected value]]. This discrepancy forced a change in some values in the [[standard model]] for [[particle physics]].

====Biology and medicine====

[[File:DNA replication split.svg|thumb|left|100px|Semi-conservative [[DNA replication]]]]

[[William Harvey]] published ''De Motu Cordis'' in 1628, which revealed his conclusions based on his extensive studies of vertebrate circulatory systems.  He identified the central role of the heart, arteries, and veins in producing blood movement in a circuit, and
failed to find any confirmation of Galen's pre-existing notions of heating and cooling functions.&lt;ref&gt;Power, d'Arcey. Life of Harvey.

In 1847, Hungarian physician [[Ignaz Semmelweis|Ignác Fülöp Semmelweis]] dramatically reduced the occurrency of [[puerperal fever]] by simply requiring physicians to wash their hands before attending to women in childbirth. This discovery predated the [[germ theory of disease]]. However, Semmelweis' findings were not appreciated by his contemporaries and handwashing came into use only with discoveries by British surgeon [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Joseph Lister]], who in 1865 proved the principles of [[antisepsis]]. Lister's work was based on the important findings by French biologist [[Louis Pasteur]]. Pasteur was able to link microorganisms with disease, revolutionizing medicine. He also devised one of the most important methods in [[preventive medicine]], when in 1880 he produced a [[vaccine]] against [[rabies]]. Pasteur invented the process of [[pasteurization]], to help prevent the spread of disease through milk and other foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Campbell | first1=Neil A. |author2=Brad Williamson |author3=Robin J.

Perhaps the most prominent, controversial and far-reaching theory in all of science has been the theory of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]] put forward by the British naturalist [[Charles Darwin]] in his book [[On the Origin of Species]] in 1859. Darwin proposed that the features of all living things, including humans, were shaped by natural processes over long periods of time. The theory of evolution in its current form affects almost all areas of biology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Dobzhansky | first1=Theodosius | year=1964 | title=Biology, Molecular and Organismic | url=http://people.ibest.uidaho.edu/~bree/courses/1_Dobzhansky_1964.pdf | journal=American Zoologist | volume=4 | issue=4 | pages=443–452 | doi=10.1093/icb/4.4.443 | access-date=5 February 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303220935/http://people.ibest.uidaho.edu/~bree/courses/1_Dobzhansky_1964.pdf | archive-date=3 March 2016 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Implications of evolution on fields outside of pure science have led to both [[Social effect of evolutionary theory|opposition and support]] from different parts of society, and profoundly influenced the popular understanding of "man's place in the universe". In the early 20th century, the study of heredity became a major investigation after the rediscovery in 1900 of the laws of inheritance developed by the [[Moravia]]n&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Henig |first=Robin Marantz |title=The Monk in the Garden : The Lost and Found Genius of Gregor Mendel, the Father of Genetics |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |year=2000 |isbn=978-0395977651 |oclc=43648512}}&lt;/ref&gt; monk [[Gregor Mendel]] in 1866. Mendel's laws provided the beginnings of the study of [[genetics]], which became a major field of research for both scientific and industrial research. By 1953, [[James D. Watson]], [[Francis Crick]] and [[Maurice Wilkins]] clarified the basic structure of DNA, the [[genetic material]] for expressing life in all its forms.&lt;ref&gt;James D. Watson and Francis H. Crick. "Letters to ''Nature'': Molecular structure of Nucleic Acid." ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' '''171''', 737–738 (1953).&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 20th century, the possibilities of [[genetic engineering]] became practical for the first time, and a massive international effort began in 1990 to map out an entire human [[genome]] (the [[Human Genome Project]]).

====Ecology====
{{Main|History of ecology}}
[[File:NASA-Apollo8-Dec24-Earthrise.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Earthrise]]'', the Earth from above the [[Moon]], [[Apollo 8]]. This 1968 [[NASA]] image by astronaut [[William Anders]] helped create awareness of the finiteness of Earth, and the limits of its [[natural resource]]s.]]
The discipline of [[ecology]] typically traces its origin to the synthesis of [[evolution|Darwinian evolution]] and [[Humboldtian science|Humboldtian]] [[biogeography]], in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Equally important in the rise of ecology, however, were [[microbiology]] and [[soil science]]—particularly the [[biogeochemical cycle|cycle of life]] concept, prominent in the work [[Louis Pasteur]] and [[Ferdinand Cohn]]. The word ''ecology'' was coined by [[Ernst Haeckel]], whose particularly holistic view of nature in general (and Darwin's theory in particular) was important in the spread of ecological thinking. In the 1930s, [[Arthur Tansley]] and others began developing the field of [[ecosystem ecology]], which combined experimental soil science with physiological concepts of energy and the techniques of [[natural history|field biology]].

===Social sciences===
{{Main|History of the social sciences}}
Successful use of the scientific method in the physical sciences led to the same methodology being adapted to better understand the many fields of human endeavor. From this effort the social sciences have been developed.

====Political science====
{{Main|History of political science}}
Political science is a late arrival in terms of [[social sciences]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} However, the discipline has a clear set of antecedents such as [[moral philosophy]], [[political philosophy]], [[political economy]], history, and other fields concerned with [[Norm (philosophy)|normative]] determinations of what ought to be and with [[Deductive reasoning|deducing]] the characteristics and functions of the ideal form of [[Forms of government|government]]. The roots of politics are in [[prehistory]]. In each historic period and in almost every geographic area, we can find someone studying politics and increasing political understanding.

In [[Western culture]], the study of politics is first found in [[Ancient Greece]]. The antecedents of European politics trace their roots back even earlier than [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], particularly in the works of [[Homer]], [[Hesiod]], [[Thucydides]], [[Xenophon]], and [[Euripides]]. Later, Plato analyzed political systems, abstracted their analysis from more [[literary]]- and history- oriented studies and applied an approach we would understand as closer to [[philosophy]]. Similarly, Aristotle built upon Plato's analysis to include historical empirical evidence in his analysis.

In this treatise, the behaviors and relationships of the people, the King, the State, the Government Superintendents, Courtiers, Enemies, Invaders, and Corporations are analysed and documented. [[Roger Boesche]] describes the ''Arthaśāstra'' as "a book of political realism, a book analysing how the political world does work and not very often stating how it ought to work, a book that frequently discloses to a king what calculating and sometimes brutal measures he must carry out to preserve the state and the common good."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| authorlink= Roger Boesche | last=Boesche | first=Roger | title=The First Great Political Realist: Kautilya and His Arthashastra | year=2002 | publisher=Lexington Books | isbn=978-0739104019 | page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the rule of Rome, famous historians such as [[Polybius]], [[Livy]] and [[Plutarch]] documented the rise of the [[Roman Republic]], and the organization and histories of other nations, while [[Politician|statesmen]] like [[Julius Caesar]], [[Cicero]] and others provided us with examples of the politics of the republic and Rome's empire and wars. The study of politics during this age was oriented toward understanding history, understanding methods of governing, and describing the operation of governments.

With the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]], there arose a more diffuse arena for political studies. The rise of [[monotheism]] and, particularly for the Western tradition, [[Christianity]], brought to light a new space for politics and political action.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} During the [[Middle Ages]], the study of politics was widespread in the churches and courts. Works such as [[Augustine of Hippo]]'s ''[[City of God (book)|The City of God]]'' synthesized current philosophies and political traditions with those of [[Christianity]], redefining the borders between what was religious and what was political. Most of the political questions surrounding the relationship between [[Religion and politics|Church and State]] were clarified and contested in this period.

In the Middle East and later other [[Islam]]ic areas, works such as the [[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam]] and Epic of Kings by [[Ferdowsi]] provided evidence of political analysis, while the Islamic [[Aristotelians]] such as [[Avicenna]] and later [[Maimonides]] and [[Averroes]], continued [[Aristotle]]'s tradition of analysis and [[empiricism]], writing commentaries on Aristotle's works.

During the [[Italian Renaissance]], [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] established the emphasis of modern political science on direct [[empirical]] [[observation]] of political [[institution]]s and actors. Later, the expansion of the scientific paradigm during the [[the Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] further pushed the study of politics beyond normative determinations.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} In particular, the study of [[statistics]], to study the subjects of the [[Sovereign state|state]], has been applied to [[Opinion poll|polling]] and [[voting]].

In the 20th century, the study of ideology, behaviouralism and international relations led to a multitude of 'pol-sci' subdisciplines including [[rational choice theory]], [[voting theory]], [[game theory]] (also used in economics), [[psephology]], [[political geography]]/[[geopolitics]], [[political psychology]]/[[political sociology]], [[political economy]], [[policy analysis]], [[public administration]], comparative political analysis and [[peace studies]]/conflict analysis.

====Linguistics====
{{Main|History of linguistics}}
[[Historical linguistics]] emerged as an independent field of study at the end of the 18th century. [[William Jones (philologist)|Sir William Jones]] proposed that [[Sanskrit]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Latin]], [[Gothic language|Gothic]], and [[Celtic languages]] all shared a common base. After Jones, an effort to catalog all languages of the world was made throughout the 19th century and into the 20th century. Publication of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s ''[[Cours de linguistique générale]]'' created the development of [[descriptive linguistics]]. Descriptive linguistics, and the related [[structuralism]] movement caused linguistics to focus on how language changes over time, instead of just describing the differences between languages. [[Noam Chomsky]] further diversified linguistics with the development of [[generative linguistics]] in the 1950s. His effort is based upon a mathematical model of language that allows for the description and prediction of valid [[syntax]]. Additional specialties such as [[sociolinguistics]], [[cognitive linguistics]], and [[computational linguistics]] have emerged from collaboration between linguistics and other disciplines.

====Economics====
{{Main|History of economics}}
[[File:Supply-demand-right-shift-demand.svg|thumb|right|The [[supply and demand]] model]]
[[File:AdamSmith.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Adam Smith]] wrote ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', the first modern work of economics]]
The basis for [[classical economics]] forms [[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[The Wealth of Nations|An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations]]'', published in 1776. Smith criticized [[mercantilism]], advocating a system of free trade with [[division of labour]]. He postulated an "[[invisible hand]]" that regulated economic systems made up of actors guided only by self-interest. [[Karl Marx]] developed an alternative economic theory, called [[Marxian economics]]. Marxian economics is based on the [[labor theory of value]] and assumes the value of good to be based on the amount of labor required to produce it. Under this assumption, [[capitalism]] was based on employers not paying the full value of workers labor to create profit. The [[Austrian School]] responded to Marxian economics by viewing [[entrepreneurship]] as driving force of economic development. This replaced the labor theory of value by a system of [[supply and demand]].

In the 1920s, [[John Maynard Keynes]] prompted a division between [[microeconomics]] and [[macroeconomics]]. Under [[Keynesian economics]] macroeconomic trends can overwhelm economic choices made by individuals. Governments should promote [[aggregate demand]] for goods as a means to encourage economic expansion. Following World War II, [[Milton Friedman]] created the concept of [[monetarism]]. Monetarism focuses on using the supply and demand of money as a method for controlling economic activity. In the 1970s, monetarism has adapted into [[supply-side economics]] which advocates reducing taxes as a means to increase the amount of money available for economic expansion.

Other modern schools of economic thought are [[New Classical economics]] and [[New Keynesian economics]]. New Classical economics was developed in the 1970s, emphasizing solid microeconomics as the basis for macroeconomic growth. New Keynesian economics was created partially in response to New Classical economics, and deals with how inefficiencies in the market create a need for control by a central bank or government.

The above "history of economics" reflects modern economic textbooks and this means that the last stage of a science is represented as the culmination of its history ([[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Kuhn]], 1962). The "[[invisible hand]]" mentioned in a lost page in the middle of a chapter in the middle of the "[[Wealth of Nations]]", 1776, advances as Smith's central message.{{clarify|date=July 2015}} It is played down that this "invisible hand" acts only "frequently" and that it is "no part of his [the individual's] intentions" because competition leads to lower prices by imitating "his" invention. That this "invisible hand" prefers "the support of domestic to foreign industry" is cleansed—often without indication that part of the citation is truncated.&lt;ref&gt;Compare Smith's original phrase with [[Paul Samuelson|Samuelson's]] quotation of it. In brackets what Samuelson curtailed without indication and without giving a reference:
"[As] every individual … [therefore, endeavours as much as he can, both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce maybe of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed,] neither intends to promote the general [Smith said "public"] interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. [By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry,] he intends only his own security, [and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only] his own gain; and he is in this, [as in many other cases,] led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. [Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it.] By pursuing his own interest, he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it" Samuelson, Paul A./Nordhaus, William D., 1989, [[Economics (textbook)|''Economics'']], 13th edition, New York: McGraw-Hill, p. 825; Smith, Adam, 1937, ''The Wealth of Nations'', N.Y.: Random House, p. 423&lt;/ref&gt; The opening passage of the "Wealth" containing Smith's message is never mentioned as it cannot be integrated into modern theory: "Wealth" depends on the division of labour which changes with market volume and on the proportion of productive to [[Unproductive labor]].

====Psychology====
{{Main|History of psychology}}
The end of the 19th century marks the start of psychology as a scientific enterprise. The year 1879 is commonly seen as the start of psychology as an independent field of study. In that year [[Wilhelm Wundt]] founded the first laboratory dedicated exclusively to psychological research (in [[Leipzig]]). Other important early contributors to the field include [[Hermann Ebbinghaus]] (a pioneer in memory studies), [[Ivan Pavlov]] (who discovered [[classical conditioning]]), [[William James]], and [[Sigmund Freud]]. Freud's influence has been enormous, though more as cultural icon than a force in scientific psychology.

The 20th century saw a rejection of Freud's theories as being too unscientific, and a reaction against [[Edward Titchener]]'s atomistic approach of the mind. This led to the formulation of [[behaviorism]] by [[John B. Watson]], which was popularized by [[B.F. Skinner]]. Behaviorism proposed [[epistemology|epistemologically]] limiting psychological study to overt behavior, since that could be reliably measured. Scientific knowledge of the "mind" was considered too metaphysical, hence impossible to achieve.

The final decades of the 20th century have seen the rise of a new interdisciplinary approach to studying human psychology, known collectively as [[cognitive science]]. Cognitive science again considers the mind as a subject for investigation, using the tools of [[psychology]], [[linguistics]], [[computer science]], [[philosophy]], and [[neurobiology]]. New methods of visualizing the activity of the brain, such as [[PET scan]]s and [[CAT scan]]s, began to exert their influence as well, leading some researchers to investigate the mind by investigating the brain, rather than cognition. These new forms of investigation assume that a wide understanding of the human mind is possible, and that such an understanding may be applied to other research domains, such as [[artificial intelligence]].

====Sociology====
{{Main|History of sociology}}
[[Ibn Khaldun]] can be regarded as the earliest scientific systematic sociologist.&lt;ref&gt;Muhammed Abdullah Enan, ''Ibn Khaldun: His Life and Works'', The Other Press, 2007, pp. 104–105. {{ISBN|9839541536}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The modern sociology emerged in the early 19th century as the academic response to the modernization of the world. Among many early sociologists (e.g., [[Émile Durkheim]]), the aim of sociology was in [[Structural functionalism|structuralism]], understanding the cohesion of social groups, and developing an "antidote" to social disintegration. [[Max Weber]] was concerned with the modernization of society through the concept of [[rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]], which he believed would trap individuals in an "iron cage" of rational thought. Some sociologists, including [[Georg Simmel]] and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], utilized more [[microsociology|microsociological]], qualitative analyses. This microlevel approach played an important role in American sociology, with the theories of [[George Herbert Mead]] and his student [[Herbert Blumer]] resulting in the creation of the [[symbolic interactionism]] approach to sociology.

In particular, just Auguste Comte, illustrated with his work the transition from a theological to a metaphysical stage and, from this, to a positive stage. Comte took care of the classification of the sciences as well as a transit of humanity towards a situation of progress attributable to a re-examination of nature according to the
affirmation of 'sociality' as the basis of the scientifically interpreted society (Cfr. Guglielmo Rinzivillo, ''Natura, cultura e induzione nell'età delle scienze. Fatti e idee del movimento scientifico in Francia e Inghilterra'', Roma, Nuova Cultura, 2015, pp. 79–, {{ISBN|978-8868124977}}).

American sociology in the 1940s and 1950s was dominated largely by [[Talcott Parsons]], who argued that aspects of society that promoted structural integration were therefore "functional". This [[structural functionalism]] approach was questioned in the 1960s, when sociologists came to see this approach as merely a justification for inequalities present in the status quo. In reaction, [[conflict theory]] was developed, which was based in part on the philosophies of [[Karl Marx]]. Conflict theorists saw society as an arena in which different groups compete for control over resources. Symbolic interactionism also came to be regarded as central to sociological thinking. [[Erving Goffman]] saw social interactions as a stage performance, with individuals preparing "backstage" and attempting to control their audience through [[impression management]]. While these theories are currently prominent in sociological thought, other approaches exist, including [[feminist theory]], [[post-structuralism]], [[rational choice theory]], and [[postmodernism]].

====Anthropology====
{{Main|History of anthropology}}
Anthropology can best be understood as an outgrowth of the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. It was during this period that Europeans attempted systematically to study human behaviour. Traditions of jurisprudence, history, philology and sociology developed during this time and informed the development of the social sciences of which anthropology was a part.

At the same time, the romantic reaction to the Enlightenment produced thinkers such as [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] and later [[Wilhelm Dilthey]] whose work formed the basis for the [[culture]] concept which is central to the discipline. Traditionally, much of the history of the subject was based on [[Colonialism|colonial]] encounters between Western Europe and the rest of the world, and much of 18th- and 19th-century anthropology is now classed as [[scientific racism]].

During the late 19th-century, battles over the "study of man" took place between those of an "anthropological" persuasion (relying on [[anthropometry|anthropometrical]] techniques) and those of an "[[ethnology|ethnological]]" persuasion (looking at cultures and traditions), and these distinctions became part of the later divide between [[physical anthropology]] and [[cultural anthropology]], the latter ushered in by the students of [[Franz Boas]].

In the mid-20th century, much of the methodologies of earlier anthropological and ethnographical study were reevaluated with an eye towards research ethics, while at the same time the scope of investigation has broadened far beyond the traditional study of "primitive cultures" (scientific practice itself is often an arena of anthropological study).

The emergence of [[paleoanthropology]], a scientific discipline which draws on the [[methodology|methodologies]] of [[paleontology]], [[physical anthropology]] and [[ethology]], among other disciplines, and increasing in scope and momentum from the mid-20th century, continues to yield further insights into human origins, evolution, genetic and cultural heritage, and perspectives on the contemporary human predicament as well.

===Emerging disciplines===
During the 20th century, a number of interdisciplinary scientific fields have emerged. Examples include:

[[Communication studies]] combines [[animal communication]], [[information theory]], [[marketing]], [[public relations]], [[telecommunication]]s and other forms of communication.

[[Computer science]], built upon a foundation of [[theoretical linguistics]], [[discrete mathematics]], and [[electrical engineering]], studies the nature and limits of computation. Subfields include [[Computability theory (computer science)|computability]], [[Computational complexity theory|computational complexity]], [[database]] design, [[computer networking]], [[artificial intelligence]], and the design of [[computer hardware]]. One area in which advances in computing have contributed to more general scientific development is by facilitating large-scale [[Scientific data archiving|archiving of scientific data]]. Contemporary computer science typically distinguishes
itself by emphasising mathematical 'theory' in contrast to the practical emphasis of [[software engineering]].

[[Environmental science]] is an interdisciplinary field. It draws upon the disciplines of biology, chemistry, [[earth sciences]], ecology, geography, mathematics, and physics.

[[Materials science]] has its roots in [[metallurgy]], [[mineralogy]], and [[crystallography]]. It combines chemistry, physics, and several engineering disciplines. The field studies metals, [[ceramic]]s, [[glass]], [[plastic]]s, [[semiconductor]]s, and [[composite material]]s.

[[Neuroscience]] is a multidisciplinary branch of science that combines [[Neurophysiology|physiology]], [[neuroanatomy]], [[Molecular neuroscience|molecular biology]], [[Development of the nervous system|developmental biology]], [[cellular neuroscience|cytology]], [[Theoretical neuroscience|mathematical modeling]] and [[psychology]] to understand the fundamental and emergent properties of [[neuron]]s, [[glia]], [[nervous system]]s and [[Biological neural network|neural circuits]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Principles of Neural Science, Fifth Edition|last=Kandel|first=Eric R.|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|year=2012|isbn=978-0071390118|location=|chapter=I. Overall perspective}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic study==
{{Main|History of science and technology}}
As an academic field, [[history of science and technology]] began with the publication of [[William Whewell]]'s ''History of the Inductive Sciences'' (first published in 1837). A more formal study of the history of science as an independent discipline was launched by [[George Sarton]]'s publications, ''Introduction to the History of Science'' (1927) and the [[Isis (journal)|''Isis'' journal]] (founded in 1912).  Sarton exemplified the early 20th-century view of the history of science as the history of great men and great ideas. He shared with many of his contemporaries a [[Whig history#In the history of science|Whiggish]] belief in history as a record of the advances and delays in the march of progress. The history of science was not a recognized subfield of American history in this period, and most of the work was carried out by interested scientists and physicians rather than professional historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1017/S0007087400023268 | last1=Reingold | first1=Nathan | year=1986 | title=History of Science Today, 1. Uniformity as Hidden Diversity: History of Science in the United States, 1920–1940 | url=| journal=British Journal for the History of Science | volume=19 | issue=3| pages=243–262 | ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the work of [[I. Bernard Cohen]] at Harvard, the history of science became an established subdiscipline of history after 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Dauben | first1=Joseph W. |name-list-format=vanc| last2=Gleason | first2=ML| year=2009 | last3=Smith | first3=GE | title=Seven Decades of History of Science | url=| journal=Isis | volume=100 | issue=1| pages=4–35 | pmid=19554868 | doi=10.1086/597575 | ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[history of mathematics]], [[history of technology]], and [[history of philosophy]] are distinct areas of research and are covered in other articles. Mathematics is closely related to but distinct from natural science (at least in the modern conception). Technology is likewise closely related to but clearly differs from the search for empirical truth.

History of science is an academic discipline, with an international community of specialists. Main professional organizations for this field include the [[History of Science Society]], the [[British Society for the History of Science]], and the [[European Society for the History of Science]].

===Theories and sociology of the history of science===
{{Main|Theories and sociology of the history of science}}
Much of the study of the history of science has been devoted to answering questions about what science ''is'', how it ''functions'', and whether it exhibits large-scale patterns and trends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=Dp1f03arcbYC&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=What+is+science | title=What is this thing called science? | isbn=978-0872204522 | year=1999 | publisher=Hackett Pub.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[sociology of science]] in particular has focused on the ways in which scientists work, looking closely at the ways in which they "produce" and "construct" scientific knowledge. Since the 1960s, a common trend in [[science studies]] (the study of the sociology and history of science) has been to emphasize the "human component" of scientific knowledge, and to de-emphasize the view that scientific data are self-evident, value-free, and context-free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=I_3i18x5BqcC&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=sociology+of+science |title=The Sociology of Science: Theoretical and Empirical Investigations |first1=Robert |last1=King Merton |isbn=978-0226520926 |year=1979 |publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The field of [[Science and Technology Studies]], an area that overlaps and often informs historical studies of science, focuses on the social context of science in both contemporary and historical periods.

[[Humboldtian science]] refers to the early 19th century approach of combining scientific field work with the age of [[Romanticism]] sensitivity, ethics and aesthetic ideals.&lt;ref&gt;Böhme, Hartmut: Ästhetische Wissenschaft, in: Matices, Nr. 23, 1999, S. 37–41&lt;/ref&gt; It helped to install [[natural history]] as a separate field, gave base for [[ecology]] and was based on the role model of scientist, naturalist and explorer [[Alexander von Humboldt]].&lt;ref&gt;Jardine et al., ''Cultures of Natural History'', p. 304&lt;/ref&gt; The later 19th century [[positivism]] asserted that all authentic knowledge allows verification and that all authentic knowledge assumes that the only valid knowledge is scientific.&lt;ref name="Larrain1979p197"&gt;[[Jorge Larrain]] (1979) ''The Concept of Ideology'' [https://books.google.com/?id=9ocOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA197 p. 197], quotation: {{quotation|one of the features of positivism is precisely its postulate that scientific knowledge is the paradigm of valid knowledge, a postulate that indeed is never proved nor intended to be proved.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major subject of concern and controversy in the [[philosophy of science]] has been the nature of ''theory change'' in science. [[Karl Popper]] argued that scientific knowledge is progressive and cumulative; [[Thomas Kuhn]], that scientific knowledge moves through "[[paradigm shift]]s" and is not necessarily progressive; and [[Paul Feyerabend]], that scientific knowledge is not cumulative or progressive and that there can be no [[demarcation problem|demarcation]] in terms of method between science and any other form of investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=qnwzRqh5jFMC&amp;pg=RA1-PR11&amp;dq=philosophy+of+science |title=Science Teaching: The Role of History and Philosophy of Science | first1= Michael Robert |last1=Matthews |isbn=978-0415908993 |year=1994 |publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mid 20th century saw a series of studies relying to the role of [[sociology of scientific knowledge|science in a social context]], starting from Thomas Kuhn's ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' in 1962. It opened the study of science to new disciplines by suggesting that the evolution of science was in part sociologically determined and that positivism did not explain the actual interactions and strategies of the human participants in science. As Thomas Kuhn put it, the history of science may be seen in more nuanced terms, such as that of competing paradigms or conceptual systems in a wider matrix that includes intellectual, cultural, economic and political themes outside of science. "Partly by selection and partly by distortion, the scientists of earlier ages are implicitly presented as having worked upon the same set of fixed problems and in accordance with the same set of fixed canons that the most recent revolution in scientific theory and method made seem scientific."&lt;ref name=kuhn&gt;Kuhn, T., 1962, "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions", University of Chicago Press, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;

Further studies, e.g. [[Jerome Ravetz]] 1971 ''Scientific Knowledge and its Social Problems'' referred to the role of the scientific community, as a social construct, in accepting or rejecting (objective) scientific knowledge.&lt;ref name="isbn0195197216 "&gt;{{cite book |author=Ravetz, Jerome R. |title=Scientific knowledge and its social problems |publisher=Oxford University Press  |year=1979 |pages= |isbn=978-0195197211}}{{page needed|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Science wars]] of the 1990 were about the influence of especially French philosophers, which denied the objectivity of science in general or seemed to do so. They described as well differences between the idealized model of a pure science and the actual scientific practice; while [[scientism]], a revival of the positivism approach, saw in precise measurement and rigorous calculation the basis for finally settling enduring metaphysical and moral controversies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lears|first=T.J. Jackson|title=Get Happy!!|journal=The Nation|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/177016/get-happy?page=full#|accessdate=21 December 2013|quote=...scientism is a revival of the nineteenth-century positivist faith that a reified "science" has discovered (or is about to discover) all the important truths about human life. Precise measurement and rigorous calculation, in this view, are the basis for finally settling enduring metaphysical and moral controversies—explaining consciousness and choice, replacing ambiguity with certainty.|date=2013-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Sorell | first=Thomas | title=Scientism: Philosophy and the Infatuation with Science | publisher=Routledge | year=1994 | pages=1ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, more recently some of the leading critical theorists have recognized that their postmodern deconstructions have at times been counter-productive, and are providing intellectual ammunition for reactionary interests. [[Bruno Latour]] noted that "dangerous extremists are using the very same argument of social construction to destroy hard-won evidence that could save our lives.  Was I wrong to participate in the invention of this field known as science studies? Is it enough to say that we did not really mean what we meant?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Latour | first1=B | year=2004 | title=Why Has Critique Run Out of Steam? From Matters of Fact to Matters of Concern | url=http://www.bruno-latour.fr/sites/default/files/89-CRITICAL-INQUIRY-GB.pdf| journal=[[Critical Inquiry]] | volume=30 | issue=2| pages=225–248 | doi=10.1086/421123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Plight of many scientific innovators ===
One recurring observation in the history of science involves the struggle for recognition of  first-rate scientists working on the periphery of the scientific establishment.  For instance, the great physicist  [[John William Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh|Lord Rayleigh]] looked back (cited [[John William Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh|here]]) on [[John James Waterston]]'s  seminal paper on the kinetic theory of gases.  The history of the neglect of Waterston's path-breaking article, Rayleigh felt, suggests that "a young author who believes himself capable of great things would usually do well to secure favourable recognition of the scientific world . . . before embarking upon higher flights."

[[William Harvey]]'s experiences led him to an even more pessimistic view:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Silencing Scientists and Scholars in Other Fields: Power, Paradigm Controls, Peer Review, and Scholarly Communication |last=Moran|first=Gordon |publisher=Ablex |year=1998 |isbn=978-1567503432 |pages=(cited on page) 38}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"But what remains to be said about the quantity and source of the blood which thus passes, is of so novel and unheard-of character that I not only fear injury to myself from the envy of a few, but I tremble lest I have mankind at large for my enemies, so much doth wont and custom, that become as another nature, and doctrine once sown and that hath struck deep root, and respect for antiquity, influence all men."&lt;/blockquote&gt;In more general terms, Robert K. Merton remarks that "the history of science abounds in instances of basic papers having been written by comparatively unknown scientists, only to be rejected or neglected for years."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Sociology of Science |last=Merton |first=Robert K. |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1973 |isbn= |pages=456–457}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nissani |first=Moti |date=1995|title=The Plight of the Obscure Innovator in Science: A Few Reflections on Campanario's Note |url=http://sss.sagepub.com/content/25/1/165.short|journal=Social Studies of Science |volume=25 |doi=10.1177/030631295025001008 |pages=165–183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Edward Teller After Dark 3rd July 1987.JPG|thumb|right|270px|[[Edward Teller]] participated in the panel discussions of ''Lasers'' '85, ''Lasers'' '87, and ''Lasers'' '92.]]

'''The International Conference on Lasers and Applications, Lasers 'XX''' was an annual conference organized by 
the former Society for Optical and Quantum Electronics.  The conference, known in short by ''Lasers 'XX''&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1986lase.conf.....W  ''Lasers'' '85 at Adsabs Harvard]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=32614 ''Lasers'' '91 at Refdoc France]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19950056109 ''Lasers'' '92 at NASA]&lt;/ref&gt; (where XX refers to the particular year), was held at various locations in The United States from 1978 to 2000.

The emphasis of these conferences was laser development and in particular the development of high-power lasers.&lt;ref&gt;''Laser Focus'' '''23'''(4), 203 (1987).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. W. Conrad, Progress in dye lasers, ''Applied Optics'' '''26''', 653 (1987).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;I. L. Bass ''et al.'', High average power dye laser at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, ''Applied Optics'' '''31''', 6993-7006 (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;   The papers delivered at these conferences were published in a series of hard-bound volumes known as ''Proceedings of the International Conference on Lasers 'XX'' ({{ISSN|0190-4132}}) by STS Press.  In total, more than 20 book proceedings were published.

A particular feature of these conferences was the organization of high-power panel discussions on timely topics of interest, such as the role of lasers in [[Directed-energy weapon|directed energy]] and the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] (SDI), during the presidency of [[Ronald Reagan]].&lt;ref name="P. Wang, 1986"&gt;C. P. Wang, ''Proceedings of the International Conference on Lasers '85'' (STS Press, McLean, VA, 1986).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=L87&gt;F. J. Duarte, ''Proceedings of the International Conference on Lasers '87'' (STS Press, Mc Lean, VA, 1988).&lt;/ref&gt;  Noted physicists, including [[Edward Teller]] and [[Arthur Kantrowitz]], participated in these discussions.  Towards the end of the [[Cold War]] this conference enjoyed the participation of numerous Soviet laser physicists, including prominent authors such as [[Alexander Prokhorov]] and [[Nikolay Basov]].&lt;ref name = LP&gt;[[F. J. Duarte]], [http://www.opticsjournal.com/laserphysicist.htm ''Laser Physicist'' (Optics Journal, New York, 2012).]&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each cabinet contains 96 computing nodes, in addition to six I/O nodes. Each computing node contains a single processor and 16&amp;nbsp;GB of memory. The computer's [[water cooling]] system is designed to minimize [[failure rate]] and [[Electric energy consumption|power consumption]].&lt;ref name="aics"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.riken.jp/engn/r-world/info/release/pamphlet/aics/pdf/2010_09.pdf |title=Riken Advanced Institute for Computational Science|publisher=Riken |accessdate=20 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Network===
The nodes are interconnected by Fujitsu's proprietary ''Torus fusion'' (''Tofu'') interconnect. Tofu has a six-dimensional [[Mesh topology|mesh]]/[[Torus interconnect|torus topology]], a scalability of over 100,000 nodes, and [[Duplex (telecommunications)#Full-duplex|full-duplex]] links that have a peak bandwidth of 10&amp;nbsp;GB/s (5&amp;nbsp;GB/s per direction). Each node is connected to its own ''InterConnect Controller'' (''ICC'') chip, which contains four Tofu interfaces (one for the node and three for connecting to other ICC chips) and a [[Router (computing)|router]]. Tofu's six-dimensional mesh/torus topology is abstracted by software to appear as a three-dimensional torus; and is supported by a Tofu-optimized version of the [[open-source license|open-source]] [[Open MPI]] [[Message Passing Interface]] library.&lt;ref name="aics"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Power consumption===
Although the K computer reported the highest total power consumption of any 2011 TOP500 supercomputer (9.89&amp;nbsp;[[megawatt|MW]]{{snd}} the equivalent of almost 10,000 suburban homes), it is relatively efficient, achieving 824.6 [[Performance per watt|GFlop/kW]]. This is 29.8% more efficient than [http://top500.org/system/10587 China's NUDT TH MPP] (ranked #2 in 2011), and 225.8% more efficient than [http://top500.org/system/10184 Oak Ridge's Jaguar-Cray XT5-HE] (ranked #3 in 2011). However, K's power efficiency still falls far short of the 2097.2 GFlops/kWatt supercomputer record set by [http://top500.org/system/11074 IBM's NNSA/SC Blue Gene/Q Prototype 2]. For comparison, the average power consumption of a TOP 10 system in 2011 was 4.3&amp;nbsp;MW, and the average efficiency was 463.7 GFlop/kW.&lt;ref name="top500-2011-06"/&gt;

According to TOP500 compiler [[Jack Dongarra]], professor of electrical engineering and computer science at the [[University of Tennessee]], the K computer's performance equals "one million linked desktop computers".&lt;ref name=tele20611/&gt; The computer's annual running costs are estimated at US$10&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=tele20611/&gt;

'''L1-norm principal component analysis (L1-PCA)''' is a general method for multivariate data analysis.&lt;ref name="mark2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Markopoulos|first1=Panos P.|last2=Karystinos|first2=George N.|last3=Pados|first3=Dimitris A.|title=Optimal Algorithms for L1-subspace Signal Processing|journal=IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing|date=October 2014|volume=62|issue=19|pages=5046–5058|doi=10.1109/TSP.2014.2338077|arxiv=1405.6785|bibcode=2014ITSP...62.5046M}}&lt;/ref&gt;
L1-PCA is often preferred over standard L2-norm [[Principal_component_analysis|principal component analysis]] (PCA) when the analyzed data may contain [[Outlier|outliers]] (faulty values or corruptions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barrodale|first1=I.|title=L1 Approximation and the Analysis of Data|journal=Applied Statistics|date=1968|volume=17|issue=1|pages=51|doi=10.2307/2985267|jstor=2985267}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barnett|first1=Vic|last2=Lewis|first2=Toby|title=Outliers in statistical data|date=1994|publisher=Wiley|location=Chichester [u.a.]|isbn=0471930946|edition=3.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kanade|first1=T.|last2=Ke|first2=Qifa|title=Robust L1 Norm Factorization in the Presence of Outliers and Missing Data by Alternative Convex Programming|journal=2005 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'05)|volume=1|pages=739|date=June 2005|doi=10.1109/CVPR.2005.309|publisher=IEEE|isbn=0-7695-2372-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both L1-PCA and standard PCA seek a collection of [[Orthogonality|orthogonal]] directions (principal components) that define a [[Linear subspace|subspace]] wherein data representation is maximized according to the selected criterion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jolliffe|first1=I.T.|title=Principal component analysis|date=2004|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=0387954422|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bishop|first1=Christopher M.|title=Pattern recognition and machine learning|date=2007|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-0-387-31073-2|edition=Corr. printing.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pearson|first1=Karl|title=On Lines and Planes of Closest Fit to Systems of Points in Space|journal=The London, Edinburgh, and Dublin Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science|date=8 June 2010|volume=2|issue=11|pages=559–572|doi=10.1080/14786440109462720}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Standard PCA quantifies data representation as the aggregate of the L2-norm of the data point [[Projection_(linear_algebra)|projections]] into the subspace, or equivalently the aggregate [[Euclidean_distance|Euclidean distance]] of the original points from their subspace-projected representations.
L1-PCA uses instead the aggregate of the L1-norm of the data point projections into the subspace.&lt;ref name="mark2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Markopoulos|first1=Panos P.|last2=Kundu|first2=Sandipan|last3=Chamadia|first3=Shubham|last4=Pados|first4=Dimitris A.|title=Efficient L1-Norm Principal-Component Analysis via Bit Flipping|journal=IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing|date=15 August 2017|volume=65|issue=16|pages=4252–4264|doi=10.1109/TSP.2017.2708023|arxiv=1610.01959|bibcode=2017ITSP...65.4252M}}&lt;/ref&gt; In PCA and L1-PCA, the number of principal components (PCs) is lower than the [[Rank_(linear_algebra)|rank]] of the analyzed matrix, which coincides with the dimensionality of the space defined by the original data points.
Therefore, PCA or L1-PCA are commonly employed for [[Dimensionality_reduction|dimensionality reduction]] for the purpose of data denoising or compression.
Among the advantages of standard PCA that contributed to its high popularity are [[Computational_complexity|low-cost]] computational implementation by means of [[Singular-value_decomposition|singular-value decomposition]] (SVD)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Golub|first1=Gene H.|title=Some Modified Matrix Eigenvalue Problems|journal=SIAM Review|date=April 1973|volume=15|issue=2|pages=318–334|doi=10.1137/1015032}}&lt;/ref&gt; and statistical optimality when the data set is generated by a true [[Multivariate_normal_distribution|multivariate Normal]] data source.

However, in modern big data sets, data often include corrupted, faulty points, commonly referred to as outliers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barnett|first1=Vic|last2=Lewis|first2=Toby|title=Outliers in statistical data|date=1994|publisher=Wiley|location=Chichester [u.a.]|isbn=0471930946|edition=3.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Standard PCA is known to be sensitive to outliers, even when they appear as a small fraction of the processed data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Candès|first1=Emmanuel J.|last2=Li|first2=Xiaodong|last3=Ma|first3=Yi|last4=Wright|first4=John|title=Robust principal component analysis?|journal=Journal of the ACM|date=1 May 2011|volume=58|issue=3|pages=1–37|doi=10.1145/1970392.1970395|arxiv=0912.3599}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The reason is that the L2-norm formulation of L2-PCA places squared emphasis on the magnitude of each coordinate of each data point, ultimately overemphasizing peripheral points, such as outliers. 
On the other hand, following an L1-norm formulation, L1-PCA places linear emphasis on the coordinates of each data point, effectively restraining outliers.&lt;ref name="kwak2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kwak|first1=N.|title=Principal Component Analysis Based on L1-Norm Maximization|journal=IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence|date=September 2008|volume=30|issue=9|pages=1672–1680|doi=10.1109/TPAMI.2008.114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formulation ==
Consider any [[Matrix_(mathematics)|matrix]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf X = [\mathbf x_1, \mathbf x_2, \ldots, \mathbf x_N] \in \mathbb R^{D \times N}&lt;/math&gt; consisting of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional data points. Define &lt;math&gt;r=rank(\mathbf X)&lt;/math&gt;. For integer &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;1 \leq K &lt; r&lt;/math&gt;, L1-PCA is formulated as:&lt;ref name="mark2014" /&gt;

{{NumBlk|:|
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp;\underset{\mathbf Q=[\mathbf q_1, \mathbf q_2, \ldots, \mathbf q_K] \in \mathbb R^{D \times K}}{\max}~~\| \mathbf X^\top \mathbf Q\|_1\\
&amp;\text{subject to}~~ \mathbf Q^\top \mathbf Q=\mathbf I_K.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

For &lt;math&gt;K=1&lt;/math&gt;, ({{EquationNote|1}}) simplifies to finding the L1-norm principal component (L1-PC) of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf X&lt;/math&gt; by
{{NumBlk|:|
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp;\underset{\mathbf q \in \mathbb R^{D \times 1}}{\max}~~\| \mathbf X^\top \mathbf q\|_1\\
&amp;\text{subject to}~~ \| \mathbf q\|_2 =1.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

In ({{EquationNote|1}})-({{EquationNote|2}}), [[Norm_(mathematics)|L1-norm]] &lt;math&gt;\| \cdot \|_1&lt;/math&gt; returns the sum of the absolute entries of its argument and L2-norm &lt;math&gt;\| \cdot \|_2&lt;/math&gt; returns the sum of the squared entries of its argument. If one substitutes &lt;math&gt;\| \cdot \|_1&lt;/math&gt; in ({{EquationNote|2}}) by the [[Matrix_norm#Frobenius_norm|Frobenius]]/L2-norm &lt;math&gt;\| \cdot \|_F&lt;/math&gt;, then the problem becomes standard PCA and it is solved by the matrix  &lt;math&gt;\mathbf Q&lt;/math&gt; that contains the &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; dominant singular vectors of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf X&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., the singular vectors that correspond to the &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; highest [[Singular_value|singular values]]).

The maximization metric in ({{EquationNote|2}}) can be expanded as 
{{NumBlk|:|
&lt;math&gt;\| \mathbf X^\top \mathbf Q\|_1=\sum_{k=1}^K \sum_{n=1}^N |\mathbf x^\top \mathbf q_k|.
&lt;/math&gt;
|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

== Solution ==

For any matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf A \in \mathbb R^{m \times n}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;m \geq n&lt;/math&gt;, define &lt;math&gt;\Phi(\mathbf A)&lt;/math&gt; as the nearest (in the L2-norm sense) matrix to &lt;math&gt;\mathbf A&lt;/math&gt; that has orthonormal columns. That is, define
{{NumBlk|:|
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\Phi(\mathbf A) = &amp; \underset{\mathbf Q \in \mathbb R^{m \times n}}{\text{argmin}}~~\| \mathbf A - \mathbf Q\|_F\\
&amp;\text{subject to}~~ \mathbf Q^\top \mathbf Q=\mathbf I_n.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Matrix_norm|nuclear-norm]] &lt;math&gt;\| \cdot \|_*&lt;/math&gt; in ({{EquationNote|2}}) returns the summation of the singular values of its matrix argument and can be calculated by means of standard SVD. Moreover, it holds that, given the solution to L1-PCA, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf Q_{\text{L1}}&lt;/math&gt;, the solution to BNM can be obtained as 
{{NumBlk|:|
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\mathbf B_{\text{BNM}} = \text{sgn}(\mathbf X^\top \mathbf Q_{\text{L1}}) 
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
|{{EquationRef|7}}}}
where &lt;math&gt;\text{sgn}(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; returns the &lt;math&gt;\{\pm 1\}&lt;/math&gt;-sign matrix of its matrix argument (with no loss of generality, we can consider &lt;math&gt;\text{sgn}(0)=1&lt;/math&gt;). In addition, it follows that &lt;math&gt; \| \mathbf X^\top \mathbf Q_{\text{L1}}\|_1 = \| \mathbf X \mathbf B_{\text{BNM}}\|_*&lt;/math&gt;. BNM in ({{EquationNote|5}})  is a [[Combinatorics|combinatorial]] problem over antipodal binary variables. Therefore, its exact solution can be found through exhaustive evaluation of all &lt;math&gt;2^{NK}&lt;/math&gt; elements of its feasibility set, with [[Computational_complexity|asymptotic cost]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal O(2^{NK})&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, L1-PCA can also be solved, through BNM, with cost &lt;math&gt;\mathcal O(2^{NK})&lt;/math&gt; (exponential in the product of the number of data points with the number of the sought-after components). It turns out that L1-PCA can be solved optimally (exactly) with polynomial complexity in &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; for fixed data dimension &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;'', &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}(N^{rK-K+1})&lt;/math&gt;''.&lt;ref name="mark2014" /&gt;

For the special case of &lt;math&gt;K=1&lt;/math&gt; (single L1-PC of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf X&lt;/math&gt;), BNM takes the binary-quadratic-maximization (BQM) form 
{{NumBlk|:|
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \underset{\mathbf b \in \{ \pm 1\}^{N \times 1}}{\text{max}}~~ \mathbf b^\top \mathbf X^\top \mathbf X \mathbf b.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
|{{EquationRef|8}}}}
The transition from ({{EquationNote|5}})  to ({{EquationNote|8}}) for &lt;math&gt;K=1&lt;/math&gt; holds true, since the unique singular value of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf X \mathbf b&lt;/math&gt; is equal to &lt;math&gt;\| \mathbf X \mathbf b\|_2 = \sqrt{\mathbf b^\top \mathbf X^\top \mathbf X \mathbf b}&lt;/math&gt;, for every &lt;math&gt;\mathbf b &lt;/math&gt;. Then, if  &lt;math&gt;\mathbf b_{\text{BNM}}&lt;/math&gt; is the solution to BQM in ({{EquationNote|7}}), it holds that 
{{NumBlk|:|
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\mathbf q_{\text{L1}} = \Phi(\mathbf X \mathbf b_{\text{BNM}}) = \frac{\mathbf X \mathbf b_{\text{BNM}}}{\| \mathbf X \mathbf b_{\text{BNM}}\|_2} 
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
|{{EquationRef|9}}}}
is the exact L1-PC of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf X&lt;/math&gt;, as defined in ({{EquationNote|1}}). In addition, it holds that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf b_{\text{BNM}} = \text{sgn}(\mathbf X^\top \mathbf q_{\text{L1}})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \| \mathbf X^\top \mathbf q_{\text{L1}}\|_1 = \| \mathbf X \mathbf b_{\text{BNM}}\|_2&lt;/math&gt;.

== Algorithms ==
=== Exact Solution of Exponential Complexity ===

As shown above, the exact solution to L1-PCA can be obtained by the following two-step process: 
 1. Solve the problem in ({{EquationNote|5}}) to obtain &lt;math&gt;\mathbf B_{\text{BNM}}&lt;/math&gt;.
 2. Apply SVD on &lt;math&gt;\mathbf X\mathbf B_{\text{BNM}}&lt;/math&gt; to obtain &lt;math&gt;\mathbf Q_{\text{L1}}&lt;/math&gt;.

BNM in ({{EquationNote|5}}) can be solved by exhaustive search over the domain of '''&lt;math&gt;\mathbf B&lt;/math&gt;''' with cost &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}(2^{NK})&lt;/math&gt;. 

=== Exact Solution of Polynomial Complexity ===
Also, L1-PCA can be solved optimally with cost &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}(N^{rK-K+1})&lt;/math&gt;, when &lt;math&gt;r=rank(\mathbf X)&lt;/math&gt; is constant with respect to &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; (always true for finite data dimension &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;).&lt;ref name="mark2014" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Markopoulos|first1=PP|last2=Kundu|first2=S|last3=Chamadia|first3=S|last4=Tsagkarakis|first4=N|last5=Pados|first5=DA|title=Outlier-Resistant Data Processing with L1-Norm Principal Component Analysis|journal=Advances in Principal Component Analysis|date=2018|issue=Springer, Singapore|pages=121|doi=10.1007/978-981-10-6704-4_6|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-10-6704-4_6|isbn=978-981-10-6703-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Approximate Efficient Solvers ===

In 2008, Kwak&lt;ref name="kwak2008" /&gt; proposed an iterative algorithm for the approximate solution of L1-PCA for &lt;math&gt;K=1&lt;/math&gt;. This iterative method was later generalized for &lt;math&gt;K&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; components.&lt;ref name="nie2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nie|first1=F|last2=Huang|first2=H|last3=Ding|first3=C|last4=Luo|first4=Dijun|last5=Wang|first5=H|title=Robust principal component analysis with non-greedy l1-norm maximization|journal=22nd International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence|date=July 2011|pages=1433–1438}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another approximate efficient solver was proposed by McCoy and Tropp&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCoy|first1=Michael|last2=Tropp|first2=Joel A.|date=2011|title=Two proposals for robust PCA using semidefinite programming|journal=Electronic Journal of Statistics|volume=5|pages=1123–1160|doi=10.1214/11-EJS636}}&lt;/ref&gt; by means of semi-definite programming (SDP). Most recently, L1-PCA (and BNM in ({{EquationNote|5}})) were solved efficiently by means of bit-flipping iterations (L1-BF algorithm).&lt;ref name="mark2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="markCodes" /&gt;

==== L1-BF Algorithm ====

  1  '''function''' L1BF(&lt;math&gt;\mathbf X&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;):
  2      Initialize &lt;math&gt;\mathbf B^{(0)} \in \{\pm 1\}^{N \times K}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal L \leftarrow \{1,2,\ldots, NK\}&lt;/math&gt;
  3      Set &lt;math&gt;t \leftarrow 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\omega \leftarrow \| \mathbf X \mathbf B^{(0)} \|_*&lt;/math&gt;
  4      Until termination (or &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; iterations)
  5          &lt;math&gt;\mathbf B \leftarrow \mathbf B^{(t)}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;t' \leftarrow t&lt;/math&gt;
  6          For &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathcal L&lt;/math&gt;
  7              &lt;math&gt;k \leftarrow \lceil \frac{x}{N} \rceil&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;n \leftarrow x-N(k-1)&lt;/math&gt;
  8              &lt;math&gt;[\mathbf B]_{n,k} \leftarrow - [\mathbf B]_{n,k}&lt;/math&gt;                ''// flip bit''
  9              &lt;math&gt;a(n,k) \leftarrow \| \mathbf X \mathbf B \|_*&lt;/math&gt;               ''// calculated by SVD or faster (see&lt;ref name="mark2017" /&gt;)''
 10              if &lt;math&gt;a(n,k)&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;
 11                  &lt;math&gt;\mathbf B^{(t)} \leftarrow  \mathbf B&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;t' \leftarrow t+1&lt;/math&gt;
 12                  &lt;math&gt;\omega \leftarrow  a(n,k)&lt;/math&gt;
 13              end
 14              if &lt;math&gt;t'=t&lt;/math&gt;                    ''// no bit was flipped''
 15                  if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal L = \{1,2, \ldots, NK\}&lt;/math&gt;
 16                      terminate
 17                  else
 18                      &lt;math&gt;\mathcal L \leftarrow \{1,2, \ldots, NK\}&lt;/math&gt;

The computational cost of L1-BF is &lt;math&gt;\mathcal O (ND min\{N,D\} + N^2K^2(K^2 + r))&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="mark2017"/&gt;

== Complex Data ==

L1-PCA has also been generalized to process [[Complex_number|complex]] data. For complex L1-PCA, two efficient algorithms were proposed in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tsagkarakis|first1=Nicholas|last2=Markopoulos|first2=Panos P.|last3=Sklivanitis|first3=George|last4=Pados|first4=Dimitris A.|title=L1-Norm Principal-Component Analysis of Complex Data|journal=IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing|date=15 June 2018|volume=66|issue=12|pages=3256–3267|doi=10.1109/TSP.2018.2821641|arxiv=1708.01249|bibcode=2018ITSP...66.3256T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28477">The '''light field''' is a [[vector-valued function|vector function]] that describes the amount of [[light]] flowing in every direction through every point in space. The space of all possible [[light rays]] is given by the [[Five-dimensional space|five-dimensional]] '''plenoptic function''', and the magnitude of each ray is given by the [[radiance]]. [[Michael Faraday]] was the first to propose (in an [[1846 in science|1846]] lecture entitled "Thoughts on Ray Vibrations"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Faraday|first1=Michael|title=LIV. Thoughts on ray-vibrations|journal=Philosophical Magazine |series=Series 3|date=30 April 2009|volume=28|issue=188|pages=345–350|doi=10.1080/14786444608645431|url=https://www-spof.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/wfarad1846.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130218141803/https://www-spof.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/wfarad1846.html|archivedate=2013-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;) that light should be interpreted as a field, much like the magnetic fields on which he had been working for several years. The phrase ''light field'' was coined by [[Andrey Aleksandrovich Gershun|Andrey Gershun]] in a classic paper on the radiometric properties of light in three-dimensional space (1936).

==The 5D plenoptic function==
[[Image:Plenoptic-function-a.png|right|frame|Radiance ''L'' along a ray can be thought of as the amount of light traveling along all possible straight lines through a tube whose size is determined by its solid angle and cross-sectional area.]]

If the concept is restricted to geometric [[optics]]—i.e., to [[Coherence (physics)|incoherent]] light and to objects larger than the wavelength of light—then the fundamental carrier of light is a [[ray (optics)|ray]]. The measure for the amount of light traveling along a ray is [[radiance]], denoted by ''L'' and measured in [[watt]]s ''(W)'' per [[steradian]] ''(sr)'' per meter squared ''(m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)''. The steradian is a measure of [[solid angle]], and meters squared are used here as a measure of cross-sectional area, as shown at right.

[[Image:Plenoptic function b.svg|left|frame|Parameterizing a ray in [[Three-dimensional space|3D]] space by position (''x'', ''y'', ''z'') and direction (''θ'', ''ϕ'').]]

The radiance along all such rays in a region of three-dimensional space illuminated by an unchanging arrangement of lights is called the plenoptic function (Adelson 1991). The plenoptic illumination function is an idealized function used in [[computer vision]] and [[computer graphics]] to express the image of a scene from any possible viewing position at any viewing angle at any point in time. It is never actually used in practice computationally, but is conceptually useful in understanding other concepts in vision and graphics.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} Since rays in space can be parameterized by three coordinates, ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' and two angles ''θ'' and ''ϕ'', as shown at left, it is a five-dimensional function, that is, a function over a five-dimensional [[manifold]] equivalent to the product of 3D [[Euclidean space]] and the [[2-sphere]].

[[Image:Gershun-light-field-fig17.png|right|thumb|175px|Summing the irradiance vectors '''D'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and '''D'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; arising from two light sources I&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; produces a resultant vector '''D''' having the magnitude and direction shown (Gershun, fig 17).]]

Like Adelson, Gershun defined the light field at each point in space as a 5D function. However, he treated it as an infinite collection of vectors, one per direction impinging on the point, with lengths proportional to their radiances.

Integrating these vectors over any collection of lights, or over the entire sphere of directions, produces a single scalar value—the ''total irradiance'' at that point, and a resultant direction. The figure at right, reproduced from Gershun's paper, shows this calculation for the case of two light sources. In computer graphics, this vector-valued function of [[Three-dimensional space|3D space]] is called the ''vector irradiance field'' (Arvo, 1994). The vector direction at each point in the field can be interpreted as the orientation one would face a flat surface placed at that point to most brightly illuminate it.

===Higher dimensionality===
One can consider time, [[wavelength]], and [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] angle as additional variables, yielding higher-dimensional functions.

==The 4D light field==
[[Image:Plenoptic-function-c.png|left|frame|Radiance along a ray remains constant if there are no blockers.]]

In a plenoptic function, if the region of interest contains a [[concave polygon|concave]] object (think of a cupped hand), then light leaving one point on the object may travel only a short distance before being blocked by another point on the object. No practical device could measure the function in such a region.

However, if we restrict ourselves to locations outside the [[convex hull]] (think shrink-wrap) of the object, i.e. in free space, then we can measure the plenoptic function by taking many photos using a digital camera. Moreover, in this case the function contains redundant information, because the radiance along a ray remains constant from point to point along its length, as shown at left. In fact, the redundant information is exactly one dimension, leaving us with a four-dimensional function (that is, a function of points in a particular four-dimensional [[manifold]]). [[Parry Moon]] dubbed this function the ''photic field'' (1981), while researchers in computer graphics call it the ''4D light field'' (Levoy 1996) or ''Lumigraph'' (Gortler 1996). Formally, the 4D light field is defined as radiance along rays in empty space.

The set of rays in a light field can be parameterized in a variety of ways, a few of which are shown below. Of these, the most common is the two-plane parameterization shown at right (below). While this parameterization cannot represent all rays, for example rays parallel to the two planes if the planes are parallel to each other, it has the advantage of relating closely to the analytic geometry of perspective imaging. Indeed, a simple way to think about a two-plane light field is as a collection of perspective images of the ''st'' plane (and any objects that may lie astride or beyond it), each taken from an observer position on the ''uv'' plane. A light field parameterized this way is sometimes called a ''light slab''.

[[Image:Light-field-parameterizations.png|left|frame| Some alternative parameterizations of the 4D light field, which represents the flow of light through an empty region of three-dimensional space. Left: points on a plane or curved surface and directions leaving each point. Center: pairs of points on the surface of a sphere. Right: pairs of points on two planes in general (meaning any) position.]]

===Sound analog===
The analog of the 4D light field for sound is the ''sound field'' or ''wave field,'' as in [[wave field synthesis]], and the corresponding parametrization is the Kirchhoff-Helmholtz integral, which states that, in the absence of obstacles, a sound field over time is given by the pressure on a plane. Thus this is two dimensions of information at any point in time, and over time a 3D field.

This two-dimensionality, compared with the apparent four-dimensionality of light, is because light travels in rays (0D at a point in time, 1D over time), while by [[Huygens–Fresnel principle]], a sound [[wave front]] can be modeled as spherical waves (2D at a point in time, 3D over time): light moves in a single direction (2D of information), while sound simply expands in every direction. However, light travelling in non-vacuous media may scatter in a similar fashion, and the irreversibility or information lost in the scattering is discernible in the apparent loss of a system dimension.

==Ways to create light fields==
Light fields are a fundamental representation for light. As such, there are as many ways of creating light fields as there are computer programs capable of creating images or instruments capable of capturing them.

In computer graphics, light fields are typically produced either by [[rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]] a [[3D model]] or by photographing a real scene. In either case, to produce a light field views must be obtained for a large collection of viewpoints. Depending on the parameterization employed, this collection will typically span some portion of a line, circle, plane, sphere, or other shape, although unstructured collections of viewpoints are also possible (Buehler 2001).

Devices for capturing [[light-field photography|light fields photographically]] may include a moving handheld camera or a robotically controlled camera (Levoy 2002), an arc of cameras (as in the [[bullet time]] effect used in ''[[The Matrix]]''), a dense array of cameras (Kanade 1998; Yang 2002; Wilburn 2005), handheld cameras ([[Ren Ng|Ng]] 2005; Georgiev 2006; Marwah 2013), microscopes (Levoy 2006), or other optical system (Bolles 1987).

How many images should be in a light field? The largest known light field (of [http://graphics.stanford.edu/projects/mich/lightfield-of-night/ Michelangelo's statue of Night]) contains 24,000 1.3-megapixel images. At a deeper level, the answer depends on the application. For light field rendering (see the Application section below), if you want to walk completely around an opaque object, then of course you need to photograph its back side. Less obviously, if you want to walk close to the object, and the object lies astride the ''st'' plane, then you need images taken at finely spaced positions on the ''uv'' plane (in the two-plane parameterization shown above), which is now behind you, and these images need to have high spatial resolution.

The number and arrangement of images in a light field, and the resolution of each image, are together called the "sampling" of the 4D light field. Analyses of ''light field sampling'' have been undertaken by many researchers; a good starting point is Chai (2000). Also of interest is Durand (2005) for the effects of occlusion, Ramamoorthi (2006) for the effects of lighting and reflection, and [[Ren Ng|Ng]] (2005) and Zwicker (2006) for applications to [[plenoptic camera]]s and 3D displays, respectively.

==Applications==
''Computational imaging'' refers to any image formation method that involves a digital computer. Many of these methods operate at visible wavelengths, and many of those produce light fields. As a result, listing all applications of light fields would require surveying all uses of computational imaging in art, science, engineering, and medicine. In computer graphics, some selected applications are:

[[Image:Gershun-light-field-fig24.png|right|thumb|200px| A downward-facing light source (F-F') induces a light field whose irradiance vectors curve outwards. Using calculus, Gershun could compute the irradiance falling on points (P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) on a surface. (Gershun, fig 24)]]

* '''Illumination engineering:''' Gershun's reason for studying the light field was to derive (in closed form if possible) the illumination patterns that would be observed on surfaces due to light sources of various shapes positioned above these surface. An example is shown at right. A more modern study is (Ashdown 1993).
:The branch of optics devoted to illumination engineering is [[nonimaging optics]] (Chaves 2015; Winston 2005). It extensively uses the concept of flow lines (Gershun's flux lines) and vector flux (Gershun's light vector). However, the light field (in this case the positions and directions defining the light rays) is commonly described in terms of [[phase space]] and [[Hamiltonian optics]].
* '''Light field rendering:''' By extracting appropriate 2D slices from the 4D light field of a scene, one can produce novel views of the scene (Levoy 1996; Gortler 1996). Depending on the parameterization of the light field and slices, these views might be [[Perspective projection|perspective]], [[Orthographic projection (geometry)|orthographic]], crossed-slit (Zomet 2003), general linear cameras (Yu and McMillan 2004), multi-perspective (Rademacher 1998), or another type of projection. Light field rendering is one form of [[Image-Based Modeling And Rendering|image-based rendering]].
* '''[[Synthetic aperture]] photography:''' By integrating an appropriate 4D subset of the samples in a light field, one can approximate the view that would be captured by a camera having a finite (i.e., non-pinhole) aperture. Such a view has a finite [[depth of field]]. By shearing or warping the light field before performing this integration, one can focus on different fronto-parallel (Isaksen 2000) or oblique (Vaish 2005) planes in the scene. If a digital camera was able to capture the light field ([[Ren Ng|Ng]] 2005), its photographs would allow being refocused after they are taken.
* '''3D display:''' By presenting a light field using technology that maps each sample to the appropriate ray in physical space, one obtains an [[autostereoscopy|autostereoscopic]] visual effect akin to viewing the original scene. Non-digital technologies for doing this include [[integral photography]], [[Volumetric display|parallax panoramagrams]], and [[holography]]; digital technologies include placing an array of lenslets over a high-resolution display screen, or projecting the imagery onto an array of lenslets using an array of video projectors. If the latter is combined with an array of video cameras, one can capture and display a time-varying light field. This essentially constitutes a [[3D television]] system (Javidi 2002; Matusik 2004).
* '''Brain imaging:''' Neural activity can be recorded optically by genetically encoding neurons with reversible fluorescent markers e.g. [[GCaMP]] that indicate the presence of calcium ions in real time. Since [[Light field microscopy]] captures full volume information in a single frame, it is possible to monitor neural activity in many individual neurons randomly distributed in a large volume at video framerate (Perez, 2015). A quantitative measurement of neural activity can even be done despite optical aberrations in brain tissue and without reconstructing a volume image (Pegard, 2016).

Image generation and predistortion of synthetic imagery for holographic stereograms is one of the earliest examples of computed light fields, anticipating and later motivating the geometry used in Levoy and Hanrahan's work (Halle 1991, 1994).

Modern approaches to light field display explore co-designs of optical elements and compressive computation to achieve higher resolutions, increased contrast, wider fields of view, and other benefits (Wetzstein 2012, 2011; Lanman 2011, 2010).

* '''Glare reduction:''' [[Glare (vision)|Glare]] arises due to multiple scattering of light inside the camera's body and lens optics and reduces image contrast. While glare has been analyzed in 2D image space (Talvala 2007), it is useful to identify it as a 4D ray-space phenomenon (Raskar 2008). By statistically analyzing the ray-space inside a camera, one can classify and remove glare artifacts. In ray-space, glare behaves as high frequency noise and can be reduced by outlier rejection. Such analysis can be performed by capturing the light field inside the camera, but it results in the loss of spatial resolution. Uniform and non-uniform ray sampling could be used to reduce glare without significantly compromising image resolution (Raskar 2008).

This list compares the features and functionality of [[application server]]s, grouped by the hosting environment that is offered by that particular application server.

== BASIC ==
* [[Run BASIC]] - An all-in-one BASIC scriptable application server, can automatically manage session and state

== C ==
* Lwan&lt;ref name="Lwan website"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lwan Web Server|url=https://lwan.ws/}}&lt;/ref&gt; - Small-footprint, highly-scalable web server.
* RomPager AE&lt;ref name="Allegro Software Website"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rompager AE Embedded Web Server|url=https://www.allegrosoft.com/embedded-web-server-ae/}}&lt;/ref&gt; - Engineered for IoT and Embedded Systems, Highly-scalable embedded web-server.
* [[Enduro/X]] - A middleware platform for distributed transaction processing, based on XATMI and XA standards, open source, C API

== C++ ==
* [[Tuxedo (software)|Tuxedo]] - Based on the ATMI standard, is one of the original application servers.
* [[Tntnet]] - Includes a template engine which allows embedding C++ code in HTML pages. Templates are compiled before run-time, and thus very fast. Multi-threaded, supports object lifetime via scoped variables.
* CPPSERV - C++ servlet container.
* [[Wt (web toolkit)|Wt]] - A web toolkit similar to [[Qt (software)|Qt]] permitting GUI-application-like web development with built-in [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] abilities.
* [[POCO C++ Libraries]] - A set of open source class libraries including Poco.Net.HTTPServer.html
* [[CppCMS]]
* [[uWSGI]]&lt;ref name="uWSGI doc"&gt;{{cite web |title=The uWSGI project — uWSGI documentation |url=http://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Enduro/X]] - A middleware platform for distributed transaction processing, based on XATMI and XA standards, open source

== Go ==
* [[Enduro/X]] ASG - Application server for [[Go (programming language)|Go]]. This provides XATMI and XA facilities for Golang. Go application can be built by normal Go executable files which in turn provides stateless services, which can be load balanced, clustered and reloaded on they fly with out service interruption by means of administrative work only. Framework provides distributed transaction processing facility for Go.

== Haskell ==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7103">'''Manhauling''', sometimes expressed as '''man-hauling''': is the pulling forward of sledges, trucks or other load-carrying vehicles by human power unaided by animals or machines. The term is used primarily in connection with travel over snow and ice, and was common during  [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctic]] expeditions before the days of modern motorised traction.

In the years following the end of the [[Napoleonic wars]] the British [[Royal Navy]] took up polar/cold climate exploration as its chief peacetime activity. Due to its simplicity, manhauling was adopted by the early British naval expeditions, where it quickly became the preferred even the 'traditional' technique. In time it would be hailed as inherently more noble than the sole use of dogs as practised by the native Arctic-dwelling peoples. The technique’s chief advocate was [[Sir Clements Markham]], President of the [[Royal Geographical Society]] during the latter part of the 19th century. A figure of considerable influence, he brought his prejudices to bear on the series of great British Antarctic ventures during the [[Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration]], in all of which manhauling was predominant.

Many later writers would condemn manhauling, particularly with heavily loaded sledges, as inefficient and wasteful, citing it as a direct cause of the great Antarctic tragedy of 1910&amp;ndash;12&amp;mdash;the deaths of [[Captain Scott]] and his four companions as they man-hauled their way across the [[Ross Ice Shelf]] on their return from the [[South Pole]].

==Historical perspective==

===Naval tradition===
Long before the nations of Europe and America became fascinated with polar exploration the native populations of Northern [[Canada]], [[Greenland]], [[Lapland (region)|Lapland]] and [[Siberia]] had trained dogs to draw sledges. Attempts by the early polar explorers to adopt these techniques were rarely successful&amp;mdash;the handling of “Eskimo” dogs was recognised as a specialized art;&lt;ref&gt;Berton, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the use of manhauling as a simpler alternative, when the Royal Navy began its long association with polar exploration. The first example of manhauling on a naval Arctic expedition was the journey by [[William Edward Parry]] across [[Melville Island (Northwest Territories and Nunavut)|Melville Island]] in 1820, when he and his party dragged {{convert|800|lb|kg|}} of equipment on a two-wheeled cart.&lt;ref&gt;Berton, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;  Thereafter man-hauling began to be seen as a natural, even a 'nobler' alternative to the use of dogs. [[Francis Leopold McClintock]] earned the title of "Father of Arctic Sledging" for his feats of manhauling travel during [[McClintock Arctic Expedition|one of the many expeditions]] despatched to search for the missing [[Franklin's lost expedition|Franklin expedition]].&lt;ref&gt;Berton, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;  Among McClintock’s admirers on that expedition was a 21-year-old midshipman, [[Sir Clements Markham|Clements Markham]]&lt;ref&gt;Preston, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

===Markham’s obsession===
Based on his experiences with McClintock and his love for naval traditions, Markham, future President of the [[Royal Geographical Society]], became a fervent believer in the principle that manhauling was the purest form of polar travel.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; Markham became the driving force behind British Antarctic exploration endeavours in the early 20th century, and was the mentor of [[Robert Falcon Scott]], to whom his thinking and drive were transferred. After his unhappy experiences with dogs in the Antarctic on the [[Discovery Expedition|''Discovery'' Expedition]], 1901&amp;ndash;04 Scott wrote, in his account of the expedition: "In my mind no journey ever made with dogs can approach the height of that fine conception which is realised when a party of men go forth to face hardships, dangers, and difficulties with their own unaided efforts […] Surely in this case the conquest is more nobly and splendidly won."&lt;ref&gt;Scott: Voyage of the Discovery Vol I,  p. 468.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scott and Shackleton===
An aversion to the use of dogs pervaded all the British expeditions during the [[Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration]] (including those led by [[Ernest Shackleton]]), This was baffling to the great Norwegian explorers [[Fridtjof Nansen]] and [[Roald Amundsen]]. To them manhauling was "futile toil", to be avoided at all costs.&lt;ref&gt;Huntford, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Edward Adrian Wilson|Edward Wilson]], however, on the fatal southern journey during Scott’s 1910–1913 [[Terra Nova Expedition|''Terra Nova'' Expedition]] expressed a profound relief, as the pole-bound party began its ascent of the [[Beardmore Glacier]] after the last of the ponies&lt;ref&gt;Shackleton had pioneered the use of Siberian ponies as an alternative to dogs, on his [[Nimrod Expedition|''Nimrod'' Expedition]], 1907–1909. Scott had followed suit on his [[Terra Nova Expedition|''Terra Nova'' Expedition]]. Both these expeditions however, relied very heavily on manhauling.&lt;/ref&gt; had been shot: "Thank God the horses are now done with, and we begin the heavier work ourselves", he wrote.&lt;ref&gt;Huntford, p. 432.&lt;/ref&gt; His companion [[Lawrence Oates]] thought differently but kept his counsel. Later, when the Pole had been attained and Amundsen’s prior arrival discovered,  Oates privately castigated “our wretched manhauling” as a cause of his party’s defeat.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Some conclusions===
Some chroniclers have suggested that excessive reliance on manhauling may have cost the lives of Scott’s polar party. Each man pulling a sledge was burning around 6,000 calories a day, and consuming rations producing only 4,500 calories. Max Jones concludes that they were slowly starving to death.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; Much earlier, an expedition account by James Gordon Hayes had highlighted two principal causes of Scott’s disaster: dietary deficiencies and the decision to rely on men instead of dogs.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted from Hayes’s book Antarctica (1928) by Jones, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, in another history of the expedition, Michael de-la-Noy concludes: “…the whole expedition had been founded upon a blind and very British belief in the moral superiority of human muscle power…Scott thought it more manly for men to haul the sledges themselves. Five of them died as a result”.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted from de-la-Hoy’s book Scott of the Antarctic (1997) by Jones, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3552">The '''Marxist Literary Group''' ('''MLG''') is an affiliate of the [[Modern Language Association]] centered on scholarly discussion of the contributions of Marxism and the Marxist tradition in the humanities and related disciplines. It holds an annual summer institute, holds sessions at the MLA convention, and publishes the journal ''[[Mediations Journal|Mediations]]''. It is also an affiliate of the Midwest Modern Language Association and occasionally sponsors sessions at other regional MLA conferences.

==History==
The MLG was formed in 1969 by [[Fredric Jameson]] and several of his graduate students at the University of California, San Diego.&lt;ref name=History&gt;[http://mlg.eserver.org/about/a-short-history-of-the-mlg/] A Short History of the MLG&lt;/ref&gt; The group emerged from the 1968 MLA conference in New York City. Whereas groups such as the Radical Caucus focused their energies on pedagogy and social activism, the MLG was concerned with providing a firm theoretical grounding for the New Left as well as cultivating Marxist intellectuals.&lt;ref name=Latimer&gt;Latimer, Dan. "Jameson and Postmodernism." New Left Review, no. 129 (1981), pp. 116-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The MLG quickly became the largest affiliate group in the MLA, running 14 sessions at the 1975 conference and organizing Marxist scholars nationwide. The first Institute on Culture and Society took place in St.. Cloud, Minnesota, in 1976, including speakers such as [[Fredric Jameson]], [[Stanley Aronowitz]], [[Terry Eagleton]], [[Gayatri Spivak]], Michael Ryan, Gene Holland, June Howard, and [[John Beverley (Latin Americanist)|John Beverly]]. Subsequent Institutes have dealt with a wide range of topics, including [[cultural studies]], [[postmodernism]], [[post-structuralism]], [[psychoanalysis]], [[post-colonialism|post-colonial discourse]], [[feminism]], and left politics. A newsletter was set up in the early 1970s, which evolved into the journal Mediations by 1991. These activities were instrumental in allowing Marxist theory and criticism to gain a foothold in the academy.&lt;ref name=History/&gt;

'''Muchea Tracking Station''' was an [[Earth stations in Australia|Earth station in Australia]] located close to [[Muchea, Western Australia|Muchea]] in the 
[[Shire of Chittering]], about {{Convert|60|km|abbr=on}} north of [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], Western Australia, built specifically for [[NASA]]'s [[Project Mercury]].

==History==
Muchea was established in 1960, and became operational in March 1961. It was Station No. 8 of the 14 [[Manned Space Flight Network]] sites around the world used throughout the project. The only other Australian site was Station No. 9, the [[Island Lagoon Tracking Station]] at [[Woomera, South Australia|Woomera]], South Australia. These 
stations were managed and operated by the Weapons Research Establishment of the Australian Department of Supply on behalf of NASA.&lt;ref name="honeysucklecreek"&gt;{{cite book |title=Muchea tracking station for Project Mercury |url=http://honeysucklecreek.net/images/other_stations/muchea_images/Muchea_Tracking_Station.pdf |year=1962 |publisher=Weapons Research Establishment, Department of Supply, Australian Defence Scientific Service }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muchea was equipped with a "VERy LOng Range Tracking" (VERLORT) [[S band]] radar operating between 2700 and 2900&amp;nbsp;MHz. This was an upgraded version of the [[SCR-584 radar|SCR-584]], with its range increased from {{Convert|650|km|abbr=on}} to {{Convert|4000|km|abbr=on}}, and the diameter of the dish increased from {{Convert|1.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}} to {{Convert|3|m|ftin|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.carnarvonspace.com/wiki/index.php?title=VERLORT_Radar |title=VERLORT Radar |work=carnarvonspace.com |year=2011 |first=Paul |last=Dench |accessdate=23 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also equipped with acquisition aid tracking systems, telemetry reception, and air-to-ground voice communications facilities. Because of its position, close to the [[antipodes]] of [[Cape Canaveral]], it was also selected to have a command facility. Information about the range, bearing and elevation of the spacecraft was automatically relayed to the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] by [[teleprinter]].&lt;ref name="honeysucklecreek"/&gt;

During each mission a NASA team consisting of two flight controllers and a [[flight surgeon]] were sent to Muchea. The Senior Flight Controller, usually another astronaut, acted as [[capsule communicator]] (CAPCOM).&lt;ref name="honeysucklecreek"/&gt;

Muchea Communications Technician Gerry O'Connor became the first Australian to speak with an astronaut on 20 February 1962, when he contacted [[John Glenn]] aboard ''[[Friendship 7]]'' on his first pass over the West Australian coast. A small plaque has been installed on the spot occupied by the Communications Technician's console which reads: "This plaque is to mark the spot where an Australian first spoke to a space traveller".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cdscc.nasa.gov/Pages/history.html |title=Tracking Stations Down Under |work=Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex |year=2011 |accessdate=24 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130814000732/http://www.cdscc.nasa.gov/Pages/history.html |archivedate=14 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muchea was closed in February 1964, after the end of the Mercury Project. It was replaced by the [[Carnarvon Tracking Station]] for the [[Project Gemini|Gemini]] and [[Project Apollo|Apollo]] projects. Although the Muchea Tracking Station no longer exists, the Shire of [[Chittering, Western Australia|Chittering]] has erected a small display about its history.

The following missions were supported by the Muchea Station:&lt;ref name="honeysucklecreek"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://honeysucklecreek.net/other_stations/muchea/missions.html |title=Muchea Tracking Station |first=Colin |last=Mackellar |work=honeysucklecreek.net |year=2013 |accessdate=24 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bomber 1 485.jpg|thumb|Switchblade in conventional position]]

The '''Switchblade''' was a proposed [[unmanned aerial vehicle]] developed by [[Northrop Grumman]] for the [[United States]]. The United States [[DARPA|Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA) awarded [[Northrop Grumman]] a [[United States Dollar|US$]]10.3 million contract for risk reduction and preliminary planning for an X-plane [[oblique wing|oblique flying wing]] demonstrator.&lt;ref&gt;G. Warwick - ''Flight International'', Num 5029, Vol 169, Pg 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The program aimed at producing a technology demonstrator aircraft to explore the various challenges which the radical design entails. The proposed aircraft would be a purely flying wing (an aircraft with no other auxiliary surfaces such as tails, [[canard (aeronautics)|canards]] or a [[fuselage]]) where the wing is swept with one side of the aircraft forward, and one backwards in an asymmetric fashion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darpa.mil/tto/programs/ofw.htm Oblique Flying Wing&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060421190759/http://www.darpa.mil/tto/programs/ofw.htm |date=2006-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This aircraft configuration is believed to give it a combination of high speed, long range and long endurance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aerodyn.org/Wings/ofw.html Oblique Flying Wing, Supersonic Aerodynamics&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060514154700/http://www.aerodyn.org/Wings/ofw.html |date=2006-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The program entailed two phases. Phase I explored the theory and result in a conceptual design, while Phase II would have resulted in the design, manufacture and flight test of an aircraft. The outcome of the program would have resulted in a dataset that could then be used when considering future military aircraft designs.

Flight of the Switchblade was scheduled for 2020 with its 61-meter long [[oblique wing]] perpendicular to its engines like a typical aircraft. As the aircraft increased speed, the wing begins to pivot, so that when it breaks the sound barrier, its wing has swiveled 60 degrees, with one wingtip pointing forward and the other backward. The change in [[aerodynamics]] and the general structure would have made the aircraft very difficult to control for a human being. The plane was to be totally controlled by an on-board computer controlling flight parameters. Following Phase I the aircraft concept was cancelled in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2008/10/the-pentagons-s/ Wired.com-DARPA kills Switchblade]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Both [[Messerschmitt]] and [[Blohm + Voss#Aircraft|Blohm + Voss]] aircraft companies worked on the [[asymmetric aircraft|asymmetric wing concept]] at the end of World War II.  The [[Blohm &amp; Voss P 202]] and ME  P.1109
were their initial attempts at implementing this concept.

From 1979 to 1982, [[NASA]] successfully flew the piloted [[NASA AD-1|AD-1]] demonstrator aircraft which validated the oblique wing concept.

'''Orion Lite''' was an unofficial name used in the media for a lightweight crew capsule proposed by [[Bigelow Aerospace]] in collaboration with [[Lockheed Martin]]. It was to be based on the [[Orion (spacecraft)|Orion spacecraft]] that Lockheed Martin was developing for [[NASA]]. It would be a lighter, less capable and cheaper version of the full Orion.

==Overview==
The intention of designing Orion Lite would be to provide a stripped down version of the Orion that will be available for missions to the [[International Space Station]] earlier than the more capable Orion, which is designed for longer duration missions to the [[Moon]], [[Mars]], [[Lagrange point]]s, and [[Near Earth asteroids]].&lt;ref name="MSNBCspace200908"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32418057/ns/technology_and_science-space/ |title=Company pitches 'lite' spaceship to NASA |publisher=MSNBC |first=Amy |last=Klamper |date=14 August 2009 |accessdate=7 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bigelow began working with Lockheed Martin in 2004. A few years later Bigelow signed a million-dollar contract to develop "an Orion mockup, an Orion Lite."&lt;ref name=tsr20101101&gt;
[http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1719/1 Bigelow still thinks big], ''[[The Space Review]]'', 2010-11-01, accessed 2010-11-02. "[In October 2010] Bigelow revealed that he had been working with Lockheed Martin on a capsule concept in the 2004–2005 period. 'We engaged in a million-dollar contract a couple years after that with Lockheed, and they created for us an Orion mockup, an Orion Lite.'&lt;/ref&gt;

Orion Lite's primary mission would be to transport crew to the International Space Station, or to private space stations such as the proposed [[Sundancer]] from Bigelow Aerospace. While Orion Lite would have the same exterior dimensions as the Orion, there would be no need for the deep space infrastructure present in the Orion configuration. As such, the Orion Lite will be able to support larger crews of around 7 people as the result of greater habitable interior volume and the reduced weight of equipment needed to support an exclusively low-Earth-orbit configuration.&lt;ref name=PS20090814&gt;
[http://www.popsci.com/military-aviation-amp-space/article/2009-08/space-hotel-visionary-proposes-modified-spaceship-nasa Space Hotel Visionary Proposes Modified "Orion Lite" Spaceship for NASA: Bigelow Airspace's concept is for low Earth-orbit missions only], ''[[Popular Science]]'', Jeremy Hsu, 14 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The Orion Lite is also not to be confused with the Orion Crew Return Vehicle, a scaled-down version of Orion proposed by the Obama administration. In an earlier budget proposal the Orion had been slated for cancellation altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/01/AR2010020102145.html|title=Obama budget proposal scraps NASA's back-to-the-moon program|last=Achenbach|first=Joel|date=2 February 2010|work=Washington Post|quote=Instead of continuing to develop the Ares 1 and Orion, the administration wants to invest $6 billion over five years in a commercial space taxi to carry astronauts into low Earth orbit.|accessdate=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposed collaboration between Bigelow and Lockheed Martin on the Orion Lite spacecraft has ended. Bigelow began work with [[Boeing]] on a similar capsule, the [[CST-100]], which has no Orion heritage. The CST-100 was selected under NASA's [[Commercial Crew Development]] (CCDev) program to transport crew to the International Space Station.

==Launch systems==

The Orion Lite is proposed to be compatible with multiple launchers, including the existing [[Atlas V]] rocket. A [[Human-rating certification|human-rated]] version of the Atlas V would have to be developed in conjunction with the Orion Lite. Work on this has started, funded by stimulus funds granted under NASA's [[Commercial Crew Development]] (CCDev) program. Likewise, a human-rated version of the [[SpaceX]] [[Falcon 9]] has also been suggested by Bigelow as a possible launch system.&lt;ref name=PS20090814/&gt;

==Recovery==

[[Image:Genesis retrieval.jpg|thumb|upright|A helicopter with a long hook can catch a parachuting object in mid-air, as seen here in a practice run for the planned retrieval of [[Genesis (spacecraft)|Genesis]].]]

In order to reduce the weight of Orion Lite, the more durable heat shield of the Orion would be replaced with a lighter weight heat shield designed to support the lower temperatures of Earth atmospheric re-entry from low Earth orbit. Additionally, the current proposal calls for a [[mid-air retrieval]], wherein another aircraft captures the descending Orion Lite module. To date, such a retrieval method has not been employed for manned spacecraft, although it [[Discoverer 14|has been used]] with satellites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1960-010A |title=Discoverer 14 – NSSDC ID: 1960-010A |publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

== Applications of biochemistry==
* Testing
** [[Ames test]] &amp;ndash; salmonella bacteria is exposed to a chemical under question (a food additive, for example), and changes in the way the bacteria grows are measured. This test is useful for screening chemicals to see if they mutate the structure of DNA and by extension identifying their potential to cause cancer in humans.
** [[Pregnancy test]] &amp;ndash; one uses a urine sample and the other a blood sample. Both detect the presence of the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG).This hormone is produced by the placenta shortly after implantation of the embryo into the uterine walls and accumulates.
** [[Breast cancer screening]] &amp;ndash; identification of risk by testing for mutations in two genes&amp;mdash;Breast Cancer-1 gene (BRCA1) and the Breast Cancer-2 gene (BRCA2)&amp;mdash;allow a woman to schedule increased screening tests at a more frequent rate than the general population.
** [[Prenatal genetic testing]] &amp;ndash; testing the fetus for potential genetic defects, to detect chromosomal abnormalities such as Down syndrome or birth defects such as spina bifida.
** [[Phenylketonuria#Screening and presentation|PKU test]] &amp;ndash; Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a metabolic disorder in which the individual is missing an enzyme called phenylalanine hydroxylase. Absence of this enzyme allows the buildup of phenylalanine, which can lead to mental retardation.
* [[Genetic engineering]] &amp;ndash; taking a gene from one organism and placing it into another. Biochemists inserted the gene for human insulin into bacteria.  The bacteria, travels through the process of translation, create human insulin.
* [[Cloning]] &amp;ndash; Dolly the sheep was the first mammal ever cloned from adult animal cells. The cloned sheep was, of course, genetically identical to the original adult sheep.  This clone was created by taking cells from the udder of a 6-year-old ewe and growing them in the lab.
* [[Gene therapy]] &amp;ndash; a modified or healthy gene is inserted into the organism to replace a disease-causing gene. Commonly a virus that has been altered to carry human DNA is used to deliver the healthy gene to the targeted cells of the patient. This process was first used successfully in 1990 on a 4-year-old patient who lacked an immune system due to a rare genetic disease called severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4247">'''Regional Input-Output Modeling System (RIMS II)'''&lt;br /&gt;
The Regional Input-Output Modeling System (RIMS II) is a regional economic model developed and maintained by the US Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA).

Regional input-output multipliers such as the RIMS II multipliers allow estimates of how a one-time or sustained increase in economic activity in a particular region will impact other industries located in the region - i.e., estimating local shocks on gross output, value added, earnings, and employment. RIMS II multipliers differ from macro-economic multipliers, which are used to assess the effects of fiscal stimulus on gross national product. Differences in industry-specific regional multipliers are not meaningful, nor appropriate for use in a national context.

RIMS II allows for estimates at the regional level because the multipliers are based on BEA data at the national and regional level.

RIMS II multipliers have been used by both the public and private sectors. There are numerous examples of their use:

* Federal Government agencies have used the multipliers to study the local impact of government regulation on specific industries and to assess the local economic impacts of Federal actions such as military base closings.
* State and local governments have used the multipliers to estimate the regional economic impacts of government policies and projects and of events, such as firms locating within their state, or to assess the impacts of tourism.
* Businesses and private consultants have used the multipliers to estimate the economic impacts of a wide range of projects, such as building a new sports facility or expanding an airport; of natural disasters, such as Hurricane Katrina; or of special events, such as national political conventions.

RIMS II provides six types of multipliers: final-demand multipliers for output, earnings, employment, and value added; and direct-effect multipliers for earnings and employment.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bea.gov/regional/rims/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''History'''

The BEA introduced the RIMS tool in the early 1970s; an enhancement of the framework was completed in the 1980s, introducing RIMS II, which is the current framework.&lt;ref&gt;Daley, William M., US Department of Commerce. March 1997. "Regional Mutlipliers: A User Handbook for the Regional Input-Output Modeling System (RIMS II)". Available at https://www.bea.gov/scb/pdf/regional/perinc/meth/rims2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The RIMS II framework is updated every few years with new data, depending on the resources available to the BEA. For example, after 2012, the BEA stopped releasing new updates to the multipliers. In 2015, the BEA began re-releasing the multipliers; they are generally released on an annual basis.

'''Data'''

The RIMS II framework currently encompasses multipliers for the "benchmark series". In past, the BEA also released an "annual series;" however, the annual series has been discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bea.gov/regional/rims/rimsii/|title=BEA RIMS II Online System|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://iiusa.org/blog/rims-ii-regional-multipliers-updated-time-2012/|title=RIMS II Regional Multipliers Updated for First Time Since 2012|last=Kester|first=Michael|date=February 23, 2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The RIMS II benchmark multiplier system is based national benchmark input-output data combined with regional data. Often, the national dataset is a few years behind the regional dataset.

'''Releases'''

This list currently does not go through all releases of the BEA RIMS II multipliers, but does list the last few and the associated datasets:
* 2016, December (most recent): 2007 national benchmark input-output data and 2015 regional data
* 2015, November: 2007 national benchmark input-output data and 2013 regional data
* 2012, October: 2002 national benchmark input-output data and 2010 regional data

'''Samuel Sinyangwe''' (born c. 1990) is an American [[Policy analysis|policy analyst]] and [[Racial equality|racial justice]] [[Activism|activist]]. Sinyangwe is a member of the [[Movement for Black Lives]] and a co-founder of We the Protestors, a group of digital tools that include Mapping Police Violence, a database of police killings in the [[United States]], and [[Campaign Zero]], a policy platform to end police violence. Sinyangwe is a co-host the [[Pod Save the People|''Pod Save the People'']] podcast, where he discusses the week's news with a panel of other activists.

== Early life ==
Sinyangwe was born circa 1990.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; He grew up in [[College Park (Orlando)|College Park]] neighborhood of [[Orlando, Florida]] and attended [[Winter Park High School]] in the [[International Baccalaureate|International Baccalaureat]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;e program.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cordeiro|first1=Monivette|title=How an Orlando data scientist is helping #BlackLivesMatter make the case against police violence|url=http://www.orlandoweekly.com/orlando/how-an-orlando-data-scientist-is-helping-the-blacklivesmatter-movement-make-the-case-against-police-violence/Content?oid=2478826|accessdate=11 September 2016|work=Orlando Weekly|date=March 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has discussed the influence of his upbringing in Florida, where he was a black child often surrounded by white peers, on his eventual career trajectory; he was shaken and moved to action after the 2013 [[Trial of George Zimmerman|acquittal of George Zimmerman]] in the shooting death of [[Shooting of Trayvon Martin|Trayvon Martin]] in [[Sanford, Florida]], where Sinyangwe had regularly attended soccer practice: "I was that kid. I could have been Trayvon. That’s why it hit me so personally and that’s why I realized that needed to be something that took the priority in terms of my focus."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Sinyangwe graduated from [[Stanford University]], where he studied how race intersects with American politics, economics, and class.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marusic|first1=Kristina|title=This Map Of Police Violence Aims To Create A Path To Justice|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2133351/map-police-violence/|accessdate=11 September 2016|work=MTV News|date=April 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Sinyangwe started his career at PolicyLink with the Promise Neighborhoods Institute.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dHxqDwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT476&amp;ots=ftZuIq_nxZ&amp;dq=%22Samuel%20Sinyangwe%22&amp;lr&amp;pg=PT486#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Samuel%20Sinyangwe%22&amp;f=false|title=The Routledge Handbook of Developments in Digital Journalism Studies|last=Richardson|first=Allissa V.|date=2018-09-05|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9781351982085|editor-last=Eldrige II|editor-first=Scott|location=|pages=|language=en|chapter=28.

With other activists, Sinyangwe founded We the Protestors, an organization aimed at developing a set of digital tools to support [[Black Lives Matter]] activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/3064214/meet-the-startup-building-the-digital-civil-rights-movement|title=Meet The Startup Building The Digital Civil Rights Movement|last=Peters|first=Adele|date=2016-10-03|work=Fast Company|access-date=2018-10-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; We the Protestors projects include a database of police killings, Mapping Police Violence,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hellman|first1=Jaime|title=No clear picture on how many people are killed by police|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/watch/shows/Ali-Velshi-On-Target/articles/2015/5/28/No-data-on-how-many-killed-by-police-in-America.html|accessdate=11 September 2016|work=Al Jazeera America|date=May 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a platform of policy solutions to end police violence called [[Campaign Zero]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://splinternews.com/the-latest-numbers-on-police-killings-show-the-problem-1793853657|title=The latest numbers on police killings show the problem may be worse than we thought|last=Meyerson|first=Collier|work=Splinter|access-date=2018-10-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thefader.com/2017/05/20/activist-samuel-sinyangwe-louisiana-mass-incarceration|title=Activist Samuel Sinyangwe Sheds Light On Louisiana’s Horrible Mass Incarceration Problem|last=Lawler|first=Opheli Garcia|date=May 20, 2017|work=The Fader|access-date=2018-10-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sinyangwe also serves as a data scientist for OurStates.org, a project focused on state legislatures&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.abqjournal.com/981351/black-lives-matter-activists-turn-attention-to-statehouses.html|title=Black Lives Matter activists turn attention to statehouses|last=Whack|first=Errin Haines|date=April 3, 2017|website=Albuquerque Journal|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with Mckesson and [[Brittany Packnett|Brittney Packnett]] founded the [[Resistance Manual]], an open-source project aimed at connecting anti-racist activists with activists focused on intersecting issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mediaite.com/online/deray-launches-resistance-manual-an-open-source-site-designed-to-take-on-trump/|title=DeRay and Stay Woke Activists Launch Resistance Manual, an Open-Source Site Designed To Take on Trump|last=Ellefson|first=Lindsey|date=January 17, 2017|website=Mediaite|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2016 U.S. Presidential campaign]], Sinyangwe and colleagues met with Democratic candidates [[Bernie Sanders]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Liebelson|first1=Dana|last2=Reilly|first2=Ryan J.|title=Black Lives Matter Activists Meet With Bernie Sanders To Make Sure He's On Board|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-black-lives-matter_us_55f9ca9ce4b00310edf57b02|accessdate=11 September 2016|work=The Huffington Post|date=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hillary Clinton]] on these policy issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Liebelson|first1=Dana|last2=Reilly|first2=Ryan J.|title=Inside Hillary Clinton's Meeting With Black Lives Matter|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/black-lives-matter-hillary-clinton_us_56180c44e4b0e66ad4c7d9fa|accessdate=11 September 2016|work=The Huffington Post|date=9 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been a vocal critic of the "[[Ferguson effect|Ferguson Effect]]", using data to refute the theory that policing had diminished and crime increased in face of activist scrutiny of police use of force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5nxqDwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA121&amp;ots=9KiW8OUcM_&amp;dq=%22Samuel%20Sinyangwe%22%20%22ferguson%20effect%22&amp;pg=PA120#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Samuel%20Sinyangwe%22%20%22ferguson%20effect%22&amp;f=false|title=Black Lives Matter: From a Moment to a Movement|last=Hillstrom|first=Laurie Collier|date=2018-09-07|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=|isbn=9781440865718|location=|pages=120-121|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Melissa Harris-Perry]] has compared Sinyangwe to journalist and anti-[[Lynching in the United States|lynching]] activist [[Ida B. Wells]], noting that Wells began her work by "compil[ing] the data, the social science and research about how, when and where lynchings were happening to begin to make it stop."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Sinyangwe is a co-host of Mckesson's podcast [[Pod Save the People|''Pod Save the People'']], which discusses the week's news with a panel of other activists including Mckesson, Packnett and [[Clint Smith (writer)|Clint Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/careers/getting-started/2018/09/11/activist-deray-mckesson-offers-insight-protests-civil-rights-blacks/1258521002/|title=How I became a civil rights activist: DeRay McKesson talks protesting, pursuing justice|last=Hutcheson|first=Susannah|date=September 11, 2018|work=USA Today|access-date=2018-10-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The podcast particularly focuses on race, grassroots activism, discrimination and other forms of inequality;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailycal.org/2018/07/26/5-political-podcasts-help-cope-worlds-current-chaos/|title=5 political podcasts to help you cope with the world's current chaos|last=Fadrilan|first=Katrina|date=2018-07-26|work=The Daily Californian|access-date=2018-10-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; recommending ''Pod Save The People'' in ''[[GQ]]'', June Diane Raphael of ''[[How Did This Get Made?]]'' wrote, "The stories they uplift and think critically about are the ones I'm now wondering why I've never been exposed to/exposed myself to."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gq.com/story/best-podcasts-recommendations|title=21 Fresh Podcast Recommendations from All Your Favorite Podcasters|last=Peele|first=Anna|date=2018-07-31|work=GQ|access-date=2018-10-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sinyangwe has also been featured on [[CNN]],&lt;ref name="cnn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2015/04/15/ctn-sam-singyangwe-police-violence-reports.cnn|title=Researcher: 'Police shootings are on the rise'|last=|first=|date=April 15, 2015|website=|publisher=CNN|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[MSNBC]],&lt;ref name="nbcnews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/57833246/ns/msnbc/|title='The Melissa Harris-Perry Show' for Sunday, September 6th, 2015|last=|first=|date=September 6, 2015|website=The Melissa Harris-Perry Show|publisher=MSNBC|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[BBC News]],&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-32740523|title=Why do US police keep killing unarmed black men?|last=|first=|date=May 26, 2015|work=BBC News|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[FiveThirtyEight]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/blacks-are-killed-at-a-higher-rate-in-south-carolina-and-the-u-s/|title=Blacks Are Killed By Police At A Higher Rate In South Carolina And The U.S.|last=Fischer-Baum|first=Reuben|date=2015-04-08|work=FiveThirtyEight|access-date=2018-10-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Los Angeles Times|''The Los Angeles Times'']],&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-police-campaign-zero-20150821-story.html|title=Activists come up with a plan to end police killings.

The '''Schön scandal''' concerns German [[physicist]] '''Jan Hendrik Schön''' (born August 1970 in [[Verden an der Aller]], [[Lower Saxony]], Germany) who briefly rose to prominence after a series of apparent breakthroughs with [[semiconductor]]s that were later discovered to be fraudulent.&lt;ref name="DeutscheWelle"&gt;{{cite news |publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]] |title= Scandal Rocks Scientific Community |date= 30 September 2002 |url= http://www.deutsche-welle.de/dw/article/0,2144,646321,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before he was exposed, Schön had received the [[Otto-Klung-Weberbank Prize]] for Physics and the Braunschweig Prize in 2001, as well as the Outstanding Young Investigator Award of the [[Materials Research Society]] in 2002, both of which were later rescinded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=IgnNCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA120&amp;lpg=PA120&amp;dq=Schön+had+received+the+Otto-Klung-Weberbank+Prize+for+Physics+and+the+Braunschweig+Prize+in+2001+as+well+as+the+Outstanding+Young+Investigator+Award+of+the+Materials+Research+Society+in+2002,&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Sugi8Xpfz7&amp;sig=oUykxhkgOXRVouUuUxBPdkBsN-0&amp;hl=pl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjB-q2J1vrOAhXQJSwKHTE0BpAQ6AEIGjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Sch%C3%B6n%20had%20received%20the%20Otto-Klung-Weberbank%20Prize%20for%20Physics%20and%20the%20Braunschweig%20Prize%20in%202001%20as%20well%20as%20the%20Outstanding%20Young%20Investigator%20Award%20of%20the%20Materials%20Research%20Society%20in%202002%2C&amp;f=false |title= Science and the Economic Crisis: Impact on Science, Lessons from Science |last=Labini |first= Francesco Sylos |date= 2016-03-21 |publisher= Springer |isbn= 978-3319295282 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious |reason= Three awards are mentioned, yet only two (?) rescinded |date= December 2016}}

The scandal provoked discussion in the scientific community about the degree of responsibility of coauthors and reviewers of [[scientific article]]s. The debate centered on whether [[peer review]], traditionally designed to find errors and determine relevance and originality of articles, should also be required to detect deliberate fraud.

Schön's field of research was [[condensed matter physics]] and [[nanotechnology]].&lt;ref name="Agin"&gt;{{cite book |last=Agin |first=Dan |title= Junk Science: An Overdue Indictment of Government, Industry, and Faith Groups That Twist Science for Their Own Gain |year=2007 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=VxcjOL1j8iAC |publisher= Macmillan |isbn= 978-0-312-37480-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received his PhD from the [[University of Konstanz]] in 1997. In late 1997 he was hired by [[Bell Labs]], located in [[New Jersey]], United States. There, he worked on electronics in which conventional semiconducting elements (such as [[silicon]]) were replaced by crystalline organic materials. Specific organic materials can conduct electrical currents, and in a [[field-effect transistor]] (a refined implementation of the transistor effect, which was pioneered in 1947 in the same laboratory) the conductance can be switched on or off, a basic function in the field of electronics. Schön, however, claimed spectacular on/off behavior, far beyond anything achieved thus far with organic materials. His measurements in most cases confirmed various theoretical predictions, for example that the organic materials could be made to display [[superconductivity]] or be used in [[laser]]s. The findings were published in prominent scientific publications, including the journals ''[[Science (journal) |Science]]'' and ''[[Nature (journal) |Nature]]'', and gained worldwide attention. However, no research group anywhere in the world succeeded in reproducing the results claimed by Schön.&lt;ref name="Reich"&gt;{{cite book |last= Samuel Reich |first= Eugenie |title= Plastic Fantastic: How the Biggest Fraud in Physics Shook the Scientific World  |year=2009 |isbn= 978-0-230-62384-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 he was listed as an author on an average of one newly published research paper every eight days.&lt;ref name="Agin" /&gt; In that year he announced in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' that he had produced a [[transistor]] on the molecular scale. Schön claimed to have used a thin layer of [[organic compound|organic]] dye molecules to assemble an [[electric circuit]] that, when acted on by an [[electric current]], behaved as a transistor. The implications of his work were significant. It would have been the beginning of a move away from [[silicon]]-based electronics and towards organic electronics. It would have allowed chips to continue shrinking past the point at which silicon breaks down, and therefore continue [[Moore's law]] for much longer than is currently predicted. It also would have drastically reduced the cost of electronics.

A key element in Schön's claimed successful observation of various physical phenomena in organic materials was in the transistor setup, specifically, a thin layer of [[aluminium oxide]], which Schön incorporated in the transistors using lab-facilities of the [[University of Konstanz]] in Germany. Although the equipment and materials used were commonly used by laboratories all over the world, no one succeeded in preparing aluminium oxide layers of similar quality as claimed by Schön.&lt;ref name="Reich" /&gt;

==Allegations and investigation==
As recounted by [[Dan Agin]] in his book ''[[Junk Science (book)|Junk Science]]'', soon after  Schön published his work on single-molecule semiconductors, others in the physics community alleged that his data contained anomalies. [[Lydia Sohn]], then of [[Princeton University]], noticed that two experiments carried out at very different [[temperature]]s had identical [[noise (electronics)|noise]].&lt;ref name="Agin" /&gt; When the editors of ''Nature'' pointed this out to Schön, he claimed to have accidentally submitted the same graph twice. [[Paul McEuen]] of [[Cornell University]] then found the same noise in a paper describing a third experiment. More research by McEuen, [[Lynn Loo]], and other physicists uncovered a number of examples of duplicate data in Schön's work. This triggered a series of reactions that quickly led [[Lucent Technologies]] (which ran Bell Labs) to start a formal investigation.&lt;ref name=Cassuto&gt;{{cite web |website=[[Salon.com]] |last=Cassuto |first=Leonard |title=Big trouble in the world of "Big Physics" |date=16 September 2002 |url=http://dir.salon.com/story/tech/feature/2002/09/16/physics/index.html# |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925065126/http://dir.salon.com/story/tech/feature/2002/09/16/physics/index.html |archivedate=25 September 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2002, Bell Labs set up a committee to investigate, with [[Malcolm Beasley]] from [[Stanford University]] as chair.&lt;ref name="BeasleyReport"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://media-bell-labs-com.s3.amazonaws.com/pages/20170403_1709/misconduct-revew-report-lucent.pdf|title=Report of the Investigation Committee on the possibility of Scientific Misconduct in the work of Hendrik Schon and Coauthors|last1= Beasley |first1= Malcolm R.|date=September 2002|website=|publisher=Bell Labs|format=pdf|access-date= |first2= Supriyo |last2= Datta |first3= Herwig |last3= Kogelnik|first4= Herbert |last4= Kroemer |first5= Don|last5= Monroe}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee obtained information from all of Schön's coauthors and interviewed the three principal ones ([[Zhenan Bao]], [[Bertram Batlogg]] and Christian Kloc).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.mse.ntu.edu.sg/AboutUs/Organisation/Staff/Pages/ckloc.aspx| deadurl= yes| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140524003706/http://www.mse.ntu.edu.sg/AboutUs/Organisation/Staff/Pages/ckloc.aspx| archivedate= May 24, 2014| title= Faculty Staff: Professor Christian Kloc | website= mse.ntu.edu.sg| publisher= School of Materials Science and Engineering, [[Nanyang Technological University]]| location= Singapore| access-date= August 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It examined electronic drafts of the disputed articles, which included processed numeric data. The committee requested copies of the raw data, but found that Schön had kept no laboratory notebooks. His raw-data files had been erased from his computer. According to Schön, the files were erased because his computer had limited [[Hard disk drive|hard-drive]] space. In addition, all of his experimental samples had been discarded or damaged beyond repair.&lt;ref name="Agin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BeasleyReport" /&gt;

On September 25, 2002, the committee publicly released its report.&lt;ref name="BeasleyReport" /&gt; The report contained details of 24 allegations of misconduct. They found evidence of Schön's scientific misconduct in at least 16 of them. They found that whole data sets had been reused in a number of different experiments. They also found that some of his graphs, which purportedly had been plotted from experimental data, had instead been produced using mathematical functions.&lt;ref name= "BeasleyReport" /&gt;

The report found that all of the misdeeds had been performed by Schön alone. All of the coauthors (including Bertram Batlogg, who was the head of the team) were exonerated of scientific misconduct. This sparked widespread debate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title= Cargo-cult science redux| first= Michael R.| last= Norman| work= [[Nature Physics]]| url= http://www.nature.com/nphys/journal/v5/n7/full/nphys1316.html?foxtrotcallback=true| volume= 5| pages= 451–452 | date= July 2009| doi= 10.1038/nphys1316| bibcode= 2009NatPh...5..451N}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the scientific community on how the blame for misconduct should be shared among co-authors, particularly when they share a significant part of the credit.&lt;ref name="BeasleyReport" /&gt;

==Aftermath and sanctions==
Schön acknowledged that the data were incorrect in many of these articles.&lt;ref name="BeasleyReport" /&gt; He claimed that the substitutions could have occurred by honest mistake. He omitted some data and stated that he did so to show more convincing evidence for behaviour that he observed.

Experimenters at [[Delft University of Technology]] and the [[Thomas J. Watson Research Center]] have since performed experiments similar to Schön's, without achieving similar results.&lt;ref name= "Agin" /&gt; Even before the allegations had become public, several research groups had tried to reproduce most of his spectacular results in the field of the physics of organic molecular materials without success.&lt;ref name=Cassuto /&gt;&lt;ref name=pw&gt;{{cite journal |title= The rise and fall of a physics fraudster |via= physicsworld.com |date= 1 May 2009 |work= [[Physics World]] |publisher= [[Institute of Physics]] |volume= 22 |number= 5 |page= 24}} Abridged from {{cite book| last= Reich| first= E. S. | title= Plastic Fantastic: How the Biggest Fraud in Physics Shook the Scientific World| publisher= Macmillan |year= 2009 |isbn= 978-0-230-22467-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schön returned to Germany and took a job at an engineering firm.&lt;ref name=pw/&gt;

In June 2004 the University of Konstanz issued a press release stating that Schön's doctoral degree had been revoked due to "dishonourable conduct". Department of Physics spokesman Wolfgang Dieterich called the affair the "biggest fraud in physics in the last 50 years" and said that the "credibility of science had been brought into disrepute".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |year=2004 |publisher=University of Konstanz |title=Universität Konstanz entzieht Jan Hendrik Schön den Doktortitel |url= http://www.newsatelier.de/html/km20040611.html | language= German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schön appealed the ruling, but on October 28, 2009, it was upheld by the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.spiegel.de/unispiegel/jobundberuf/0,1518,657924,00.html |work = Der Spiegel | language= German |date=2009-10-28 |title=Uni Konstanz bleibt bei Aberkennung des Doktortitels |first= Frank | last= van Bebber}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Schön sued the university and appeared in court to testify on September 23, 2010. The court overturned the university's decision on September 27, 2010. However, in November 2010 the university moved to appeal the court's ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |date= November 30, 2010 |publisher=University of Konstanz |title= Einseitig gewichtet: Die Universität Konstanz geht in Sachen Schön in Berufung | trans-title= Biased: The University of Konstanz is Appealing the Issues of Schön |url=http://www.aktuelles.uni-konstanz.de/presseinformationen/2010/163/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state court ruled in September 2011 that the university was correct in revoking his doctorate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.stuttgarter-zeitung.de/inhalt.urteil-in-mannheim-umstrittener-physiker-ist-doktortitel-los.f8d0b54e-3ce0-4755-a53f-49c06cbca594.html |title= Umstrittener Physiker ist Doktortitel los| work= [[Stuttgarter Zeitung]]| date= 14 September 2011 | language= German| access-date= August 7, 2017 | first= Johanna | last= Eberhardt | trans-title= Controversial Physicist Loses Doctorate}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Federal Administrative Court of Germany|Federal Administrative Court]] upheld the state court's decision in July 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Entziehung des redlich erworbenen Doktorgrades bei späterer Unwürdigkeit wegen Manipulation und Fälschung von Forschungsergebnissen rechtmäßig|url=http://www.bverwg.de/presse/pressemitteilungen/pressemitteilung.php?jahr=2013&amp;nr=56| work= [[Bundesverwaltungsgericht]] |accessdate=3 August 2013|date=31 July 2013|language=German| trans-title= Withdrawal of the earned doctorate degree in case of later unworthiness due to manipulation and falsification of research results}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|Federal Constitutional Court]] confirmed it in September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://blogs.nature.com/news/2014/10/schon-loses-last-appeal-against-phd-revocation.html| title= Schön loses last appeal against PhD revocation| date= October 1, 2014| first= Alison | last= Abbott| website= Newsblog ''at'' [[Nature (journal)|Nature.com]] | access-date= August 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the meantime, in October 2004, the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]] (DFG, the German Research Foundation) Joint Committee announced sanctions against him. The former DFG post-doctorate fellow was deprived of his active right to vote in DFG elections or serve on DFG committees for an eight-year period. During that period, Schön was also unable to serve as a peer reviewer or apply for DFG funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.dfg.de/download/pdf/dfg_im_profil/reden_stellungnahmen/2004/ha_jhschoen_1004_en.pdf|year=2004 |publisher=[[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]] |title=DFG Imposes Sanctions Against Jan Hendrik Schön |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sextant.jpg|thumb|A sextant]]

A '''sextant''' is a [[reflecting instrument|doubly reflecting navigation instrument]] that measures the [[angular distance]] between two visible objects. The primary use of a sextant is to measure the angle between an [[astronomical object]] and the [[horizon]] for the purposes of [[celestial navigation]]. The estimation of this angle, the altitude,  is known as ''sighting'' or ''shooting'' the object, or ''taking a sight''. The angle, and the time when it was measured, can be used to calculate a [[position line]] on a nautical or aeronautical [[nautical chart|chart]]—for example, sighting the [[Sun]] at [[solar noon|noon]] or [[Polaris]] at night (in the Northern Hemisphere) to estimate [[latitude]]. Sighting the height of a landmark can give a measure of ''distance off'' and, held horizontally, a sextant can measure angles between objects for a [[fix (position)|position on a chart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Seddon |first=J. Carl |title=Line of Position from a Horizontal Angle |journal=Journal of Navigation |date=June 1968 |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=367–369 |doi=10.1017/S0373463300024838 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S0373463300024838 |issn=1469-7785 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A sextant can also be used to measure the [[lunar distance (navigation)|lunar distance]] between the moon and another celestial object (such as a star or planet) in order to determine [[Greenwich Mean Time]] and hence [[longitude]]. The principle of the instrument was first implemented  around 1731 by [[John Hadley]] (1682–1744) and [[Thomas Godfrey (inventor)|Thomas Godfrey]] (1704–1749), but it was also found later in the unpublished writings of [[Isaac Newton]] (1643–1727). Additional links can be found to [[Bartholomew Gosnold]] (1571–1607) indicating that the use of a sextant for nautical navigation predates Hadley's implementation. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://britishheritage.com/timeline-the-world-of-1607/ |title=Timeline: The World of 1607 |website=British Heritage Travel |date=3 May 2007 |accessdate=3 May 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180503220550/https://britishheritage.com/timeline-the-world-of-1607/ |archivedate=3 May 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922, it was modified for aeronautical navigation by Portuguese navigator and naval officer {{lang|pt|[[Carlos Viegas Gago Coutinho|Gago Coutinho]]|italic=no}}.

==Navigational sextants==
[[File:Sekstant.jpg|thumb|Using a sextant]]
This section discusses navigators' sextants. Most of what is said about these specific sextants applies equally to other types of sextants. Navigators' sextants were primarily used for ocean navigation.

===Advantages===
Like the [[Davis quadrant]], the sextant allows celestial objects to be measured relative to the horizon, rather than relative to the instrument. This allows excellent precision. However, unlike the [[backstaff]], the sextant allows direct observations of stars. This permits the use of the sextant at night when a backstaff is difficult to use. For solar observations, filters allow direct observation of the sun.

Since the measurement is relative to the horizon, the measuring pointer is a beam of light that reaches to the horizon. The measurement is thus limited by the angular accuracy of the instrument and not the [[Abbe_sine_condition|sine error]] of the length of an [[alidade]], as it is in a [[mariner's astrolabe]] or similar older instrument.

A sextant does not require a completely steady aim, because it measures a relative angle. For example, when a sextant is used on a moving ship, the image of both horizon and celestial object will move around in the field of view. However, the relative position of the two images will remain steady, and as long as the user can determine when the celestial object touches the horizon, the accuracy of the measurement will remain high compared to the magnitude of the movement.

The sextant is not dependent upon electricity (unlike many forms of modern navigation) or anything human-controlled (like GPS satellites). For these reasons, it is considered an eminently practical back-up navigation tool for ships.

===Design===
The frame of a sextant is in the shape of a sector which is approximately {{Fraction|1|6}} of a circle (60°),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/302147838|title=Great Collections : treasures from Art Gallery of NSW, Australian Museum, Botanic Gardens Trust, Historic Houses Trust of NSW, Museum of Contemporary Art, Powerhouse Museum, State Library of NSW, State Records NSW.|last=A.)|first=McPhee, John (John|last2=NSW.|first2=Museums and Galleries|publisher=Museums &amp; Galleries NSW|year=|isbn=9780646496030|location=|pages=56|oclc=302147838|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; hence its name (''sextāns, -antis'' is the [[Latin]] word for "one sixth"). Both smaller and larger instruments are (or were) in use: the  [[Octant (instrument)|octant]], [[reflecting instrument#Quintant and others|quintant]] (or [[reflecting instrument#Quintant and others|pentant]]) and the (doubly reflecting) quadrant&lt;ref&gt;This article treats the doubly reflecting quadrant, not its predecessor described at [[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]].&lt;/ref&gt; span sectors of approximately {{Fraction|1|8}} of a circle (45°), {{Fraction|1|5}} of a circle (72°) and  {{Fraction|1|4}} of a circle (90°), respectively. All of these instruments may be termed "sextants".

[[File:Marine sextant.svg|thumb|Marine Sextant|300px|right]]
[[File:Using sextant swing.gif|thumb|Using the sextant to measure the [[Celestial coordinate system#Altitude|altitude]] of the Sun above the horizon|300px|right]]
Attached to the frame are the "horizon mirror",  an ''index arm''  which moves the ''index mirror'', a sighting telescope, sun shades, a graduated scale and a micrometer drum gauge for accurate measurements. The scale must be graduated so that the marked degree divisions  register twice the angle through which the index arm turns. The scales of the octant, sextant, quintant and quadrant are graduated from below zero to 90°, 120°, 140° and 180° respectively. For example, the sextant shown alongside has a scale graduated from −10° to  142°, so that is basically a quintant: the frame is a sector of a circle subtending an angle of 76° (not 72°) at the pivot of the index arm.

The necessity for the doubled scale reading follows by consideration of the relations of the fixed ray (between the mirrors), the object ray (from the sighted object) and the direction of the normal perpendicular to the index mirror. When the index arm moves by an angle, say 20°, the angle between the fixed ray and the normal also increases by 20°. But the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection so the angle between the object ray and the normal must also increase by 20°. The angle between the fixed ray and the object ray must therefore  increase by 40°. This is the case shown in the graphic alongside.

There are two types of horizon mirrors on the market today. Both types give good results.

Traditional sextants have a half-horizon mirror, which divides the field of view in two. On one side, there is a view of the horizon; on the other side, a view of the celestial object. The advantage of this type is that both the horizon and celestial object are bright and as clear as possible. This is superior at night and in haze, when the horizon can be difficult to see. However, one has to sweep the celestial object to ensure that the lowest limb of the celestial object touches the horizon.

Whole-horizon sextants use a half-silvered horizon mirror to provide a full view of the horizon. This makes it easy to see when the bottom limb of a celestial object touches the horizon. Since most sights are of the sun or moon, and haze is rare without overcast, the low-light advantages of the half-horizon mirror are rarely important in practice.

In both types, larger mirrors give a larger field of view, and thus make it easier to find a celestial object. Modern sextants often have 5&amp;nbsp;cm or larger mirrors, while 19th-century sextants rarely had a mirror larger than 2.5&amp;nbsp;cm (one inch). In large part, this is because precision flat mirrors have grown less expensive to manufacture and to [[silvering|silver]].

An artificial horizon is useful when the horizon is invisible, as occurs in fog, on moonless nights, in a calm, when sighting through a window or on land surrounded by trees or buildings. Professional sextants can mount an artificial horizon in place of the horizon-mirror assembly. An artificial horizon is usually a mirror that views a fluid-filled tube with a bubble.

Most sextants also have filters for use when viewing the sun and reducing the effects of haze. The filters usually consist of a series of progressively darker glasses that can be used singly or in combination to reduce haze and the sun's brightness. However, sextants with adjustable polarizing filters have also been manufactured, where the degree of darkness is adjusted by twisting the frame of the filter.

Most sextants mount a 1 or 3-power [[monocular]] for viewing. Many users prefer a simple sighting tube, which has a wider, brighter field of view and is easier to use at night. Some navigators mount a light-amplifying monocular to help see the horizon on moonless nights. Others prefer to use a lit artificial horizon.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Professional sextants use a click-stop degree measure and a worm adjustment that reads to a [[minute of arc|minute]], 1/60 of a [[degree (angle)|degree]]. Most sextants also include a [[vernier scale|vernier]] on the worm dial that reads to 0.1 minute. Since 1 minute of error is about a [[nautical mile]], the best possible accuracy of celestial navigation is about {{convert|0.1|nmi|m|-2}}. At sea, results within several nautical miles, well within visual range, are acceptable. A highly skilled and experienced navigator can determine position to an accuracy of about {{convert|0.25|nmi|m|-1|sing=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;''Dutton's Navigation and Piloting'', 12th edition. G.D. Dunlap and H.H. Shufeldt, eds. Naval Institute Press 1972, {{ISBN|0-87021-163-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A change in temperature can warp the arc, creating inaccuracies. Many navigators purchase weatherproof cases so that their sextant can be placed outside the cabin to come to equilibrium with outside temperatures. The standard frame designs (see illustration) are supposed to equalise differential angular error from temperature changes. The handle is separated from the arc and frame so that body heat does not warp the frame. Sextants for tropical use are often painted white to reflect sunlight and remain relatively cool. High-precision sextants have an [[invar]] (a special low-expansion steel) frame and arc. Some scientific sextants have been constructed of quartz or ceramics with even lower expansions. Many commercial sextants use low-expansion brass or aluminium. Brass is lower-expansion than aluminium, but aluminium sextants are lighter and less tiring to use. Some say they are more accurate because one's hand trembles less. Solid brass frame sextants are less susceptible to wobbling in high winds or when the vessel is working in heavy seas, but as noted are substantially heavier. Sextants with aluminum frames and brass arcs have also been manufactured. Essentially, a sextant is intensely personal to each navigator, and he or she will choose whichever model has the features which suit them best.

[[Aircraft]] sextants are now out of production, but had special features. Most had artificial horizons to permit taking a sight through a flush overhead window. Some also had mechanical averagers to make hundreds of measurements per sight for compensation of random accelerations in the artificial horizon's fluid. Older aircraft sextants had two visual paths, one standard and the other designed for use in open-cockpit aircraft that let one view from directly over the sextant in one's lap. More modern aircraft sextants were [[Periscope|periscopic]] with only a small projection above the [[fuselage]]. With these, the navigator pre-computed his sight and then noted the difference in observed versus predicted height of the body to determine his position.

===Taking a sight===
A ''sight'' (or ''measure'') of the angle between the [[sun]], a [[star]], or a [[planet]], and the [[horizon]] is done with the 'star [[telescope]]' fitted to the sextant using a visible horizon. On a [[Watercraft|vessel]] at sea even on [[mist]]y days a sight may be done from a low height above the water to give a more definite, better horizon. Navigators hold the sextant by its handle in the right hand, avoiding touching the arc with the fingers.&lt;ref name="Dixon68"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dixon|first=Conrad|title=Basic Astro Navigation|year=1968|publisher=Adlard Coles|isbn=0-229-11740-6|chapter=5.

For a sun sight, a [[Filter (optics)|filter]] is used to overcome the [[Glare (vision)|glare]] such as "shades" covering both index mirror and the horizon mirror designed to prevent eye damage. By setting the index bar to zero, the sun can be viewed through the telescope. Releasing the index bar (either by releasing a clamping screw, or on modern instruments, using the quick-release button), the image of the sun can be brought down to about the level of the horizon. It is necessary to flip back the horizon mirror shade to be able to see the horizon, and then the fine adjustment screw on the end of the index bar is turned until the bottom curve (the ''lower [[Limb darkening|limb]]'') of the sun just touches the horizon. '[[Rotation around a fixed axis|Swinging]]' the sextant about the axis of the telescope ensures that the reading is being taken with the instrument held vertically. The angle of the sight is then read from the scale on the arc, making use of the micrometer or vernier scale provided. The exact time of the sight must also be noted simultaneously, and the height of the eye above sea-level recorded.&lt;ref name="Dixon68"/&gt;

An alternative method is to estimate the current [[Horizontal coordinate system|altitude]] (angle) of the sun from navigation tables, then set the index bar to that angle on the arc, apply suitable shades only to the index mirror, and point the instrument directly at the horizon, sweeping it from side to side until a flash of the sun's rays are seen in the telescope. Fine adjustments are then made as above. This method is less likely to be successful for sighting stars and planets.&lt;ref name="Dixon68"/&gt;

Star and planet sights are normally taken during [[nautical twilight]] at [[dawn]] or [[dusk]], while both the heavenly bodies and the sea horizon are visible. There is no need to use shades or to distinguish the lower limb as the body appears as a mere [[Point source|point]] in the telescope. The [[moon]] can be sighted, but it appears to move very fast, appears to have [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|different sizes]] at different times, and sometimes only the lower or upper limb can be distinguished due to its [[Lunar phase|phase]].&lt;ref name="Dixon68"/&gt;

After a sight is taken, it is reduced to a position by looking at several mathematical procedures. The simplest [[sight reduction]] is to draw the equal-altitude circle of the sighted celestial object on a globe. The intersection of that circle with a dead-reckoning track, or another sighting, gives a more precise location.

Sextants can be used very accurately to measure other visible angles, for example between one heavenly body and another and between [[landmark]]s ashore. Used horizontally, a sextant can measure the apparent angle between two landmarks such as a [[lighthouse]] and a [[Church (building)|church]] spire, which can then be used to find the distance ''off'' or out to sea (provided the distance between the two landmarks is known). Used vertically, a measurement of the angle between the [[Lighthouse#Components|lantern]] of a lighthouse of known height and the [[sea level]] at its base can also be used for distance off.&lt;ref name="Dixon68"/&gt;

===Adjustment===
Due to the sensitivity of the instrument it is easy to knock the mirrors out of adjustment. For this reason a sextant should be checked frequently for errors and adjusted accordingly.

There are four errors that can be adjusted by the navigator and they should be removed in the following order.

;Perpendicularity error:This is when the index mirror is not perpendicular to the frame of the sextant. To test for this, place the index arm at about 60° on the arc and hold the sextant horizontally with the arc away from you at arms length and look into the index mirror. The arc of the sextant should appear to continue unbroken into the mirror. If there is an error, then the two views will appear to be broken. Adjust the mirror until the reflection and direct view of the arc appear to be continuous.
;Side error:This occurs when the horizon glass/mirror is not perpendicular to the plane of the instrument. To test for this, first zero the index arm then observe a star through the sextant. Then rotate the tangent screw back and forth so that the reflected image passes alternately above and below the direct view. If in changing from one position to another, the reflected image passes directly over the unreflected image, no side error exists. If it passes to one side, side error exists. The user can hold the sextant on its side and observe the horizon to check the sextant during the day. If there are two horizons there is side error; adjust the horizon glass/mirror until the stars merge into one image or the horizons are merged into one. Side error is generally inconsequential for observations and can be ignored or reduced to a level that is merely inconvenient.
;Collimation error:This is when the [[telescope]] or [[monocular]] is not [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to the [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]] of the sextant. To check for this you need to observe two stars 90° or more apart. Bring the two stars into coincidence either to the left or the right of the field of view. Move the sextant slightly so that the stars move to the other side of the field of view. If they separate there is [[collimation]] error. As modern sextants rarely use adjustable telescopes, they do not need to be corrected for collimation error.
;Index error:This occurs when the index and horizon mirrors are not parallel to each other when the index arm is set to zero. To test for index error, zero the index arm and observe the horizon. If the reflected and direct image of the horizon are in line there is no index error. If one is above the other adjust the index mirror until the two horizons merge. This can be done at night with a star or with the moon.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15599">Although the subject of [[sexual dimorphism]] is not in itself controversial, the measures by which it is assessed differ widely. Most of the measures are used on the assumption that a [[random variable]] is considered so that [[probability distribution]]s should be taken into account. In this review, a series of '''sexual dimorphism measures''' are discussed concerning both their definition and the probability law on which they are based. Most of them are sample functions, or [[statistics]], which account for only partial characteristics, for example the [[mean]] or [[expected value]], of the distribution involved. Further, the most widely used measure fails to incorporate an [[Inferential statistics|inferential]] support.

==Introduction==
It is widely known that [[sexual dimorphism]] is an important component of the morphological [[variance|variation]] in biological populations (see, e.g., Klein and Cruz-Uribe, 1983; Oxnard, 1987; Kelley, 1993). In higher Primates, sexual dimorphism is also related to some aspects of the social organization and behavior (Alexander ''et al.'', 1979; Clutton-Brock, 1985). Thus, it has been observed that the most dimorphic species tend to [[polygyny]] and a social organization based on male dominance, whereas in the less dimorphic species, [[monogamy]] and family groups are more common. Fleagle ''et al.'' (1980) and Kay (1982), on the other hand, have suggested that the behavior of extinct species can be inferred on the basis of sexual dimorphism and, e.g. Plavcan and van Schaick (1992) think that sex differences in size among primate species reflect processes of an ecological and social nature. Some references on sexual dimorphism regarding human populations can be seen in Lovejoy (1981), Borgognini Tarli and Repetto (1986) and Kappelman (1996).

These biological facts do not appear to be controversial. However, they are based on a series of different sexual dimorphism [[Measure (mathematics)|measures]], or indices. Sexual dimorphism, in most works, is measured on the assumption that a [[random variable]] is being taken into account. This means that there is a law which accounts for the behavior of the whole set of values that compose the domain of the random variable, a law which is called [[probability distribution|distribution function]]. Because both studies of sexual dimorphism aim at establishing differences, in some random variable, between sexes and the behavior of the random variable is accounted for by its distribution function, it follows that a sexual dimorphism study should be equivalent to a study whose main purpose is to determine to what extent the two distribution functions - one per sex - overlap (see shaded area in Fig. 1, where two [[normal distribution]]s are represented).
[[Image:Overlapnorm.jpg|thumb|Fig. 1. Two normal distributions.]]

==Measures based on sample means==
In Borgognini Tarli and Repetto (1986) an account of indices based on [[arithmetic mean|sample means]] can be seen. Perhaps, the most widely used is the quotient,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {\bar{X}_m}{\bar{X}_f} ,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\bar{X}_m&lt;/math&gt; is the sample mean of one sex (e.g., male) and &lt;math&gt;\bar{X}_f&lt;/math&gt; the corresponding mean of the other. Nonetheless, for instance,

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{log}\frac {\bar{X}_m}{\bar{X}_f} ,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;100\frac {\bar{X}_m - \bar{X}_f}{\bar{X}_f} ,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;100\frac {\bar{X}_m - \bar{X}_f}{\bar{X}_f + \bar{X}_f} ,&lt;/math&gt;

have also been proposed.

Going over the works where these indices are used, the reader misses any reference to their [[parameter|parametric]] counterpart (see reference above). In other words, if we suppose that the quotient of two sample means is considered, no work can be found where, in order to make [[Inferential statistics|inferences]], the way in which the quotient is used as a point [[estimator|estimate]] of

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {\mu_m}{\mu_f} ,&lt;/math&gt;

is discussed.

By assuming that differences between populations are the objective to analyze, when quotients of sample means are used it is important to point out that the only feature of these populations that seems to be interesting is the mean parameter. However, a population has also variance, as well as a shape which is defined by its distribution function (notice that, in general, this function depends on parameters such as means or variances).

==Measures based on something more than sample means==
Marini ''et al.'' (1999) have illustrated that it is a good idea to consider something other than sample means when sexual dimorphism is analyzed. Possibly, the main reason is that the intrasexual variability influences both the manifestation of dimorphism and its interpretation.

===Normal populations===

====Sample functions====
It is likely that, within this type of indices, the one used the most is the well-known statistic with [[Student's t-distribution|Student's ''t'' distribution]] (see, for instance, Green, 1989). Marini ''et al.'' (1999) have observed that variability among females seems to be lower than among males, so that it appears advisable to use the form of the Student's ''t'' statistic with degrees of freedom given by the Welch-Satterthwaite approximation,

:&lt;math&gt;T = \frac {\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2 - (\mu_1 - \mu_2)} {\sqrt{\frac{S^2_1}{n_1} + \frac{S^2_2}{n_2}}} : t_\nu ,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\nu = \frac {(\frac{S^2_1}{n_1} + \frac{S^2_2}{n_2})^2} {\frac{S^2_1}{n_1(n_1 - 1)} + \frac{S^2_2}{n_2(n_2 - 1)}} ,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;S^2_i, n_i, i=1,2&lt;/math&gt; are sample variances and sample sizes, respectively.

Anyway, it is important to point out the following,
*when this statistic is taken into account in sexual dimorphism studies, two normal populations are involved. From these populations two random samples are extracted, each one corresponding to a sex, and such samples are independent.
*when inferences are considered, what we are testing by using this statistic is that the difference between two mathematical expectations is a hypothesized value, say &lt;math&gt;\mu_0 = \mu_1 - \mu_2.&lt;/math&gt;

However, in sexual dimorphism analyses, it does not appear reasonably (see Ipiña and Durand, 2000) to assume that two independent random samples have been selected. Rather on the contrary, when we sample we select some random observations - making up one sample - that sometimes correspond to one sex and sometimes to the other.

====Taking parameters into account====
Chakraborty and Majumder (1982) have proposed an index of sexual dimorphism that is the overlapping area - to be precise, its complement - of two normal [[probability density function|density]] functions (see Fig. 1). Therefore, it is a function of four parameters &lt;math&gt;\mu_i,\sigma^2_i, i=1,2&lt;/math&gt; (expected values and variances, respectively), and takes the shape of the two normals into account. Inman and Bradley (1989) have discussed this overlapping area as a measure to assess the distance between two normal densities.

Regarding inferences, Chakraborty and Majumder proposed a sample function constructed by considering the Laplace-DeMoivre's theorem (an application to [[binomial distribution|binomial]] laws of the [[central limit theorem]]). According to these authors, the variance of such a statistic is,

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{var}(\widehat{D}) = \frac {\widehat{p}_m(1 - \widehat{p}_m)}{n_m} + \frac {\widehat{p}_f(1 - \widehat{p}_f)}{n_f} ,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\widehat{D}&lt;/math&gt; is the statistic, and &lt;math&gt;\widehat{p}_i, n_i, i=m,f&lt;/math&gt; (male, female) stand for the estimate of the probability of observing the measurement of an individual of the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; sex in some interval of the real line, and the sample size of the ''i'' sex, respectively. Notice that this implies that two independent random variables with binomial distributions have to be regarded. One of such variables is ''number of individuals of the f sex in a sample of size &lt;math&gt;n_f&lt;/math&gt; composed of individuals of the f sex'', which seems nonsensical.

===Mixture models===
Authors such as Josephson ''et al.'' (1996) believe that the two sexes to be analyzed form a single population with a probabilistic behavior denominated a [[mixture model|mixture of two normal populations]]. Thus, if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a random variable which is normally distributed among the females of a population and likewise this variable is normally distributed among the males of the population, then,

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \sum_{i=1}^n \pi_if_i(x), -\infty &lt; x &lt; \infty ,&lt;/math&gt;

is the density of the mixture with two normal components, where &lt;math&gt;f_i, \pi_i, i=1,2&lt;/math&gt; are the normal densities and the mixing proportions of both sexes, respectively. See an example in Fig. 2 where the thicker curve represents the mixture whereas the thinner curves are the &lt;math&gt;\pi_if_i&lt;/math&gt; functions.
[[Image:Overlapmix.jpg|thumb|Fig. 2. A mixture of two normal components.]]

It is from a population modelled like this that a random sample with individuals of both sexes can be selected. Note that on this sample tests which are based on the normal assumption cannot be applied since, in a mixture of two normal components,  &lt;math&gt;\pi_if_i&lt;/math&gt; is not a normal density.

Josephson ''et al.'' limited themselves to considering two normal mixtures with the same component variances and mixing proportions. As a consequence, their proposal to measure sexual dimorphism is the difference between the mean parameters of the two normals involved. In estimating these central parameters, the procedure used by Josephson ''et al.'' is the one of [[Method of moments (statistics)|Pearson's moments]]. Nowadays, the [[Expectation-maximization algorithm|EM expectation maximization algorithm]] (see McLachlan and Basford, 1988) and the [[Markov chain Monte Carlo|MCMC Markov chain Monte Carlo]] [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian procedure]] (see Gilks ''et al.'', 1996) are the two competitors for estimating mixture parameters.

Possibly the main difference between considering two independent normal populations and a mixture model of two normal components is in the mixing proportions, which is the same as saying that in the two independent normal population model the interaction between sexes is ignored. This, in turn implies that probabilistic properties change (see Ipiña and Durand, 2000).

====The MI measure====
Ipiña and Durand (2000, 2004) have proposed a measure of sexual dimorphism called &lt;math&gt;MI&lt;/math&gt;. This proposal computes the overlapping area between the &lt;math&gt;\pi_1f_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\pi_2f_2&lt;/math&gt; functions, which represent the contribution of each sex to the two normal components mixture (see shaded area in Fig. 2). Thus, &lt;math&gt;MI&lt;/math&gt; can be written,

:&lt;math&gt;MI = \int_R \operatorname{min}[\pi_1f_1(x), (1 - \pi_1)f_2(x)]\,dx ,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; being the real line.

The smaller the overlapping area the greater the gap between the two functions &lt;math&gt;\pi_1f_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\pi_2f_2&lt;/math&gt;, in which case the sexual dimorphism is greater. Obviously, this index is a function of the five parameters that characterize a mixture of two normal components (&lt;math&gt;\mu_i, \sigma^2_i, \pi_1, i=1,2)&lt;/math&gt;. Its range is in the interval &lt;math&gt;(0, 0.5]&lt;/math&gt;, and the interested reader can see, in the work of the authors who proposed the index, the way in which an interval estimate is constructed.

===Measures based on non-parametric methods===
Marini ''et al.'' (1999) have suggested the [[Kolmogorov-Smirnov test|Kolmogorov-Smirnov]] distance as a measure of sexual dimorphism. The authors use the following form of the statistic,

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{max}_x|F_1(x) - F_2(x)| ,&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;F_i, i=1,2&lt;/math&gt; being sample cumulative distributions corresponding to two independent random samples.

Such a distance has the advantage of being applicable whatever the form of the random variable distributions concerned, yet they should be continuous. The use of this distance assumes that two populations are involved. Further, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance is a sample function whose aim is to test that the two samples under analysis have been selected from a single distribution. If one accepts the [[null hypothesis]], then there is not sexual dimorphism; otherwise, there is.

'''Thomas Fincke''' (6 January 1561 – 24 April 1656) was a [[Denmark|Danish]]  [[mathematics|mathematician]] and [[physics|physicist]], and a professor at the [[University of Copenhagen]] for more than 60 years.

Fincke was born in [[Flensburg]], [[Schleswig]] and died in [[Copenhagen]]. His lasting achievement is found in his book ''Geometria rotundi'' (1583), in which he introduced the modern names of the [[trigonometric function]]s [[tangent (trigonometric function)|tangent]] and [[secant (trigonometry)|secant]].

The '''two-factor theory of emotion''', states that emotion is based on two factors: physiological arousal and cognitive label. The theory was created by researchers [[Stanley Schachter]] and [[Jerome E. Singer]]. According to the theory, when an emotion is felt, a physiological arousal occurs and the person uses the immediate environment to search for emotional cues to label the physiological arousal.&lt;ref name="Schachter"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schachter | first1 = S. | last2 = Singer | first2 = J. | year = 1962 | title = Cognitive, Social, and Physiological Determinants of Emotional State | url = http://faculty.uncfsu.edu/tvancantfort/Syllabi/Gresearch/Readings/A_Schachter1.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 69 | issue = | pages = 379–399 | doi=10.1037/h0046234}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can sometimes cause misinterpretations of emotions based on the body's physiological state. When the brain does not know why it feels an emotion it relies on external stimulation for cues on how to label the emotion.&lt;ref name=Pruett&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pruett|first=Chris|title=Pressed By The Dark|date=February 2011|volume=18.2|series=Game Developer|page=33|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?action=interpret&amp;id=GALE%7CA248499948&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=sunybuff_main&amp;it=r&amp;p=AONE&amp;sw=w&amp;authCount=1|accessdate=7 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Empirical support==

Stanley Schachter and Jerome E. Singer (1962) performed a study that tested how people use clues in their environment to explain physiological changes. Their hypotheses were:
* If a person experiences a state of arousal for which they have no immediate explanation, they will label this state and describe their feelings in terms of the cognitions available to them at the time. 
* If a person experiences a state of arousal for which they have an appropriate explanation (e.g.  'I feel this way because I have just received an injection of adrenaline'), then they will be unlikely to label their feelings in terms of the alternative cognitions available. 
* If a person is put in a situation, which in the past could have made them feel an emotion, they will react emotionally or experience emotions only if they are in a state of physiological arousal.

Participants were told they were being injected with a new drug called "Suproxin" to test their eyesight. The participants were actually injected with [[epinephrine]] (which causes respiration, an increase in blood pressure and heart rate) or a placebo. There were four conditions that participants were randomly placed in: epinephrine informed, epinephrine ignorant, epinephrine misinformed and a control group. The epinephrine informed group was told they may feel side effects including that their hands would start to shake, their heart will start to pound, and their face may get warm and flushed. This condition was expected to use cues to explain their physiological change.  In the epinephrine ignorant group, the experimenters did not explain to the subjects what symptoms they might feel. This group was expected to use cues to explain their physiological change. The epinephrine misinformed group was told that they would probably feel their feet go numb, and have an itching sensation over parts of their body, and a slight headache. This group was expected to use cues around them for their physiological change. The control group was injected with a placebo and was given no side effects to expect. This group was used as a control because they were not experiencing a physiological change and have no emotion of label.  After the injection, a confederate interacted with the students, who was either acting euphoric or angry.&lt;ref name=Schachter/&gt; The experimenters watched through a one way mirror and rated the participants' state on a three category scale. The participants were then given a questionnaire and their heart rate was checked.

The researchers found that the impact of the confederate was different for the participants in the different conditions. From high to low euphoria their ranking was as follows: epinephrine misinformed, epinephrine ignorant, placebo, epinephrine informed. In the anger condition the ranking was: epinephrine ignorant, placebo, epinephrine informed. Both results show that those participants who had no explanation of why their body felt as it did, were more susceptible to the confederate. These findings are considered to support the researchers' hypotheses.&lt;ref name=Schachter/&gt;

===Misattribution of arousal ===
The [[Misattribution of arousal|misattribution of arousal study]] tested Schachter and Singer's two-factor theory of emotion.  Psychologists Donald G. Dutton and Arthur P. Aron wanted to use a natural setting that would induce physiological arousal.   In this experiment, they had male participants walk across two different styles of bridges.  One bridge was a very scary (arousing) [[suspension bridge]], which was very narrow and suspended above a deep ravine.  The second bridge was much safer and more stable than the first.

At the end of each bridge an attractive female experimenter met the [male] participants.  She gave the participants a questionnaire which included an ambiguous picture to describe and her number to call if they had any further questions.  The idea of this study was to find which group of males were more likely to call the female experimenter and to measure the sexual content of the stories the men wrote after crossing one of the bridges.  They found that the men who walked across the scary bridge were more likely to call the woman to follow up on the study, and that their stories had more sexual content.&lt;ref&gt;Dutton, D. G. and Aron, A. P. Some evidence for heightened sexual attraction under conditions of high anxiety. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology", 30, 510–517.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Two-factor theory would say that this is because they had transferred (misattributed) their arousal from fear or anxiety on the suspension bridge to higher levels of sexual feeling towards the female experimenter.

===Schachter &amp; Wheeler===
In the Schachter &amp; Wheeler (1962) study the subjects were injected with epinephrine, [[chlorpromazine]], or a placebo&lt;ref&gt;Schachter, S. and Wheeler, L. (1962). Epinephrine, chlorpromazine, and amusement. Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, 65, 121-128&lt;/ref&gt; (chlorpromazine is a tranquilizer). None of the subjects had any information about the injection.  After receiving the injection, the subjects watched a short comical movie.  While watching the movie, the subjects were monitored for signs of humor.  After the movie was watched, the subjects rated how funny the movie was and if they enjoyed.  The results concluded that the epinephrine subjects demonstrated the most signs of humor.  The placebo subjects demonstrated fewer reactions of humor but more than the chlorpromazine subjects.

==Criticisms==
Criticism of the theory has come from attempted replications of the Schachter and Singer (1962) study.  Marshall and Zimbardo (1979, and Marshall 1976) tried to replicate the Schachter and Singer’s euphoria conditions.  Just as Schachter and Singer did, the subjects were injected with epinephrine or a placebo, except the administrator told the subjects that they will be experiencing non-arousal symptoms.   Then the subjects were put into four different conditions: subjects injected epinephrine and were exposed to a neutral confederate, another in which they received the placebo and were told to expect arousal symptoms, and two conditions in which the dosage of epinephrine was determined by body weight rather than being fixed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Marshall | first1 = G. D. | last2 = Zimbardo | first2 = P.G. | year = 1979 | title = Affective consequences of inadequately explained physiological arousal | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 37 | issue = | pages = 970–988 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.37.6.970}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results found that euphoria confederate had little impact on the subjects.  Also, that the euphoric confederate didn’t produce any more euphoria than the neutral confederate did.  Concluding that the subjects who were injected with epinephrine were not more susceptible to emotional manipulations than the non-aroused placebo subjects.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Maslach (1979) designed a study to try to replicate and extend on the Schachter and Singer study.  Instead of being injected with epinephrine, the administrators used hypnotic suggestions for the source of arousal.  Either the subjects were hypnotized or were used as a control (same as the placebo effect in the Schachter and Singer study).  Subjects that were hypnotized were given a suggestion to become aroused at the presentation of a cue and were instructed not to remember the source of this arousal.&lt;ref name="Cotton, J. L. 1981"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cotton | first1 = J. L. | year = 1981 | title = A review of research on Schachter's theory of emotion and the misattribution of Arousal | url = | journal = European Journal of Social Psychology | volume = 11 | issue = | pages = 365–397 | doi=10.1002/ejsp.2420110403}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Right after the subjects had been hypnotized, a confederate began acting either in a euphoric or angry condition. Later on in the study the subjects were exposed to two more euphoric confederates. One confederate was to keep aware the source of the arousal, while the other confederates told the subjects to expect different arousal symptoms.
The results found that all the subjects both on self-reports and on observation found that unexplained arousal causes negative conditions. Subjects still showed angry emotions regardless of the euphoric confederate.  Maslach concluded that when there is a lack of explanation for an arousal it will cause a negative emotion, which will evoke either anger or fear. However, Maslach did mention a limitation that there might have been more negative emotion self-reported because there are more terms referring to negative emotions than to positive ones.&lt;ref&gt;Izard, C. E. The face of emotion. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also criticisms of the two-factor theory that come from a theoretical standpoint. One of these criticisms is that the Schachter-Singer Theory centers primarily on the autonomic nervous system and provides no account of the emotional process within the central nervous system aside from signaling the role of cognitive factors. This is important considering the heavy implication of certain brain centers in mitigating emotional experience (e.g., fear and the amygdala).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=LeDoux|first=J. E.|title=Emotion: Clues From the Brain|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|year=1995|volume=46|pages=209–235|doi=10.1146/annurev.ps.46.020195.001233|pmid=7872730}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It can also be noted that Gregorio Marañon also had early studies in the development of cognitive theories of emotion and should be recognized for making contributions to this concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1177/0146167291171010| issn = 0146-1672| volume = 17| issue = 1| pages = 65–69| last = Cornelius| first = Randolph R.| title = Gregorio Marañon's Two-Factor Theory of Emotion| journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin| accessdate = 2017-05-02| date = 1991-02-01| url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0146167291171010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[theoretical physics]], the '''Udwadia–Kalaba equation''' &lt;ref name=uk1996&gt;Udwadia, F.E.; Kalaba, R.E. (1996). ''Analytical Dynamics: A New Approach.''

== Background ==
The problem of finding a simple closed form expression for mechanical systems that are subjected to equality [[Constraint (classical mechanics)|constraints]] is a central issue in [[analytical dynamics]]. It remained so since the time it was first explicitly stated by Lagrange, and it has been worked on by numerous scientists and engineers for at least 200 years.

The centrality of the problem stems for the fact that the difference between the motion of a ''set'' of particles subjected to forces and that of a ''system'' of particles is that in the latter the particles are cognizant of the motion of one another, and are therefore subjected to constraints that each particle poses on some (or all) of its neighbors. The standard method of handling this problem is through the use of [[Lagrange multiplier]]s, first introduced by [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]]. This approach however, is unsuitable when the number of degrees of freedom of a system becomes large, since the multipliers are required to be found usually through the solution of nonlinear sets of equations. Other approaches such as the [[Appell's equation of motion|Gibbs-Appell approach]], and its variants, suffer from similar difficulties. There has therefore been a quest for obtaining an explicit equation that describes the motion of a constrained mechanical system that is subjected to equality constraints.

In 1992, Udwadia and Kalaba published such an explicit equation, in a three-page paper.&lt;ref name="uk1992"/&gt; In their publications, the authors refer to the equation as the ''fundamental equation of constrained motion''. This equation is nowadays called the Udwadia-Kalaba (UK) equation.

The Udwadia–Kalaba equation has several advantages over the available (Lagrangian) approaches for describing the motion of mechanical systems, especially when dealing with [[nonlinear system]]s that have many degrees of freedom (that is, large-scale mechanical systems). The UK equation: 
# is explicit,
# is simple and elegant,
# handles constraints that are [[Holonomic constraints|holonomic]] and [[Nonholonomic system|nonholonomic]],
# handles constraints that are nonlinear in position and in velocity, which go beyond the so called Pffafian constraints handled by the theory using Lagrange multipliers, and
# is computationally efficient and simple to implement.

The Lagrangian view of analytical dynamics (motion of bodies subjected to forces) relies on the determination of the Lagrange multipliers to describe the motion of constrained mechanical systems. In contrast, Udwadia and Kalaba explain constrained motion without the notion of a Lagrange multiplier.

The physical interpretation of the equation has been of importance in areas beyond theoretical physics, such as the control of highly nonlinear general dynamical systems.

== The central problem of constrained motion ==

In the study of the dynamics of mechanical systems, the configuration of a given system ''S'' is, in general, completely described by ''n'' [[generalized coordinates]] so that its generalized coordinate ''n''-vector is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{q}:=[q_1,q_2,\ldots,q_n]^\mathrm{T}.&lt;/math&gt;

where T denotes [[matrix transpose]]. Using Newtonian or [[Lagrangian dynamics]], the unconstrained equations of motion of the system ''S'' under study can be derived as a matrix equation (see [[matrix multiplication]]):

{{Equation box 1
|title='''Udwadia–Kalaba equations of motion''' (''Unconstrained'')
|indent=: 
|equation= &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{M}(q,t)\ddot{\mathbf{q}}(t)=\mathbf{Q}(q,\dot{q},t)\,,&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding = 6 |border = 1 |border colour = black |background colour=white}}

where the dots represent [[time derivative|derivatives with respect to time]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{q}_i = \frac{dq_i}{dt}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

It is assumed that the [[initial conditions]] '''q'''(0) and &lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{q}}(0)&lt;/math&gt; are known.  We call the system ''S'' unconstrained because &lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{q}}(0)&lt;/math&gt; may be arbitrarily assigned.

The ''n''-vector '''Q''' denotes the total [[generalized force]] acted on the system by some external influence; it can be expressed as the sum of all the [[conservative force]]s as well as ''non''-conservative forces.

The ''n''-by-''n'' matrix '''M''' is [[symmetric matrix|symmetric]], and it can be [[positive definite matrix|positive definite]] &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{M} &gt; 0)&lt;/math&gt; or semi-positive definite &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{M} \geq 0)&lt;/math&gt;.  Typically, it is assumed that '''M''' is positive definite; however, it is not uncommon to derive the unconstrained equations of motion of the system ''S'' such that '''M''' is only semi-positive definite; i.e., the mass matrix may be singular (it has no [[inverse matrix]]).&lt;ref name="UdwadiaPho"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Udwadia|first1=F.E.|last2=Phohomsiri|first2=P.|date=|year=2006|title=Explicit equations of motion for constrained mechanical systems with singular mass matrices and applications to multi-body dynamics|url=http://ruk.usc.edu/bio/udwadia/papers/Explicit%20equations%20of%20motion%20singular%20mass%20matrices.pdf|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, Series A|volume=462|issue=2071|pages=2097–2117|bibcode=2006RSPSA.462.2097U|doi=10.1098/rspa.2006.1662|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UdwadiaSch"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Udwadia|first1=F.E.|last2=Schutte|first2=A.D.|date=|year=2010|title=Equations of motion for general constrained systems in Lagrangian mechanics|url=http://ruk.usc.edu/bio/udwadia/papers/ActaMechanica.pdf|journal=Acta Mechanica|volume=213|issue=1|pages=111–129|doi=10.1007/s00707-009-0272-2|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Constraints ===

We now assume that the unconstrained system ''S'' is subjected to a set of ''m'' consistent equality constraints given by
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A}(q,\dot{q},t)\ddot{\mathbf{q}} = \mathbf{b}(q,\dot{q},t), &lt;/math&gt;
where '''A''' is a known ''m''-by-''n'' matrix of rank ''r'' and '''b''' is a known ''m''-vector.  We note that this set of constraint equations encompass a very general variety of [[Holonomic constraints|holonomic]] and [[nonholonomic system|non-holonomic]] equality constraints.  For example, holonomic constraints of the form
:&lt;math&gt; \varphi(q,t) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
can be differentiated twice with respect to time while non-holonomic constraints of the form
:&lt;math&gt;\psi(q,\dot{q},t) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
can be differentiated once with respect to time to obtain the ''m''-by-''n'' matrix '''A''' and the ''m''-vector '''b'''.  In short, constraints may be specified that are

#nonlinear functions of displacement and velocity, 
#explicitly dependent on time, and 
#functionally dependent.

As a consequence of subjecting these constraints to the unconstrained system ''S'', an additional force is conceptualized to arise, namely, the force of constraint.  Therefore, the constrained system ''S&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'' becomes

{{Equation box 1
|title='''Udwadia–Kalaba equations of motion''' (''Constrained'')
|indent=: 
|equation= &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{M}\ddot{\mathbf{q}}=\mathbf{Q}+\mathbf{Q}_{c}(q,\dot{q},t),&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding = 6 |border = 1 |border colour = black |background colour=white}}

where  '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt;—the constraint force—is the additional force needed to satisfy the imposed constraints.  The central problem of constrained motion is now stated as follows:

#given the unconstrained equations of motion of the system ''S'',
#given the generalized displacement ''q''(''t'') and the generalized velocity &lt;math&gt;\dot{q}(t)&lt;/math&gt; of the constrained system ''S&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'' at time ''t'', and
#given the constraints in the form &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}\ddot{q}=\mathbf{b}&lt;/math&gt; as stated above,

find the equations of motion for the ''constrained'' system—the acceleration—at time ''t'', which is in accordance with the agreed upon principles of analytical dynamics.

== Equation of motion ==

The solution to this central problem is given by the Udwadia–Kalaba equation.  When the matrix '''M''' is positive definite, the equation of motion of the constrained system ''S&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'', at each instant of time, is&lt;ref name=uk1992/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Udwadia|first1=F.E.|last2=Kalaba|first2=R.E.|date=|year=1993|title=On motion|url=http://ruk.usc.edu/bio/udwadia/papers/On_Motion.pdf|journal=Journal of the Franklin Institute|volume=330|issue=3|pages=571–577|doi=10.1016/0016-0032(93)90099-G|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{M}\ddot{\mathbf{q}} = \mathbf{Q} + \mathbf{M}^{1/2}\left(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{M}^{-1/2}\right)^+(\mathbf{b}-\mathbf{A}\mathbf{M}^{-1}\mathbf{Q}), &lt;/math&gt;

where the '+' symbol denotes the [[Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse|pseudoinverse]] of the matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}\mathbf{M}^{-1/2}&lt;/math&gt;.  The force of constraint is thus given explicitly as

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{Q}_{c} = \mathbf{M}^{1/2}\left(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{M}^{-1/2}\right)^+(\mathbf{b}-\mathbf{A}\mathbf{M}^{-1}\mathbf{Q}), &lt;/math&gt;

and since the matrix '''M''' is positive definite the generalized acceleration of the constrained system ''S&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'' is determined explicitly by

:&lt;math&gt; \ddot{\mathbf{q}} = \mathbf{M}^{-1}\mathbf{Q} + \mathbf{M}^{-1/2}\left(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{M}^{-1/2}\right)^+(\mathbf{b}-\mathbf{A}\mathbf{M}^{-1}\mathbf{Q}). &lt;/math&gt;

In the case that the matrix '''M''' is semi-positive definite &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{M} \geq 0)&lt;/math&gt;, the above equation cannot be used directly because '''M''' may be singular.  Furthermore, the generalized accelerations may not be unique unless the (''n'' + ''m'')-by-''n'' matrix

:&lt;math&gt; \hat{\mathbf{M}} = \left[\begin{array}{c} \mathbf{M} \\ \mathbf{A} \end{array}\right] &lt;/math&gt;

has full rank (rank = ''n'').&lt;ref name=UdwadiaPho/&gt;&lt;ref name=UdwadiaSch/&gt;  But since the observed accelerations of mechanical systems in nature are always unique, this rank condition is a necessary and sufficient condition for obtaining the uniquely defined generalized accelerations of the constrained system ''S&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'' at each instant of time.  Thus, when &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{M}}&lt;/math&gt; has full rank, the equations of motion of the constrained system ''S&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'' at each instant of time are uniquely determined by (1) creating the auxiliary unconstrained system&lt;ref name=UdwadiaSch/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{M}_\mathbf{A} \ddot{\mathbf{q}}:=(\mathbf{M}+\mathbf{A}^+\mathbf{A})\ddot{\mathbf{q}} = \mathbf{Q} + \mathbf{A}^+\mathbf{b} := \mathbf{Q}_\mathbf{b}, &lt;/math&gt;

and by (2) applying the fundamental equation of constrained motion to this auxiliary unconstrained system so that the auxiliary constrained equations of motion are explicitly given by&lt;ref name=UdwadiaSch/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{M}_\mathbf{A} \ddot{\mathbf{q}} = \mathbf{Q}_\mathbf{b} + \mathbf{M}_\mathbf{A}^{1/2}(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{M}_\mathbf{A}^{-1/2})^+(\mathbf{b}-\mathbf{A}\mathbf{M}_\mathbf{A}^{-1}\mathbf{Q}_\mathbf{b}). &lt;/math&gt;

Moreover, when the matrix &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{M}}&lt;/math&gt; has full rank, the matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{M}_\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; is always positive definite.  This yields, explicitly, the generalized accelerations of the constrained system ''S&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'' as

:&lt;math&gt; \ddot{\mathbf{q}} = \mathbf{M}_\mathbf{A}^{-1}\mathbf{Q}_\mathbf{b} + \mathbf{M}_\mathbf{A}^{-1/2}(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{M}_\mathbf{A}^{-1/2})^+(\mathbf{b}-\mathbf{A}\mathbf{M}_\mathbf{A}^{-1}\mathbf{Q}_\mathbf{b}). &lt;/math&gt;

This equation is valid when the matrix '''M''' is either positive definite ''or'' positive semi-definite. Additionally, the force of constraint that causes the constrained system ''S&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''—a system that may have a singular mass matrix '''M'''—to satisfy the imposed constraints is explicitly given by

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{Q}_{c} =  \mathbf{M}_\mathbf{A}^{1/2}(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{M}_\mathbf{A}^{-1/2})^+(\mathbf{b}-\mathbf{A}\mathbf{M}_\mathbf{A}^{-1}\mathbf{Q}_\mathbf{b}). &lt;/math&gt;

== Non-ideal constraints ==

At any time during the motion we may consider perturbing the system by a [[virtual displacement]] δ'''r''' consistent with the constraints of the system.  The displacement is allowed to be either reversible or irreversible.  If the displacement is irreversible, then it performs [[virtual work]].  We may write the virtual work of the displacement as

:&lt;math&gt;W_c(t)=\mathbf{C}^{\mathrm{T}}(q,\dot{q},t)\delta\mathbf{r}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

The vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C}(q,\dot{q},t)&lt;/math&gt; describes the non-ideality of the virtual work and may be related, for example, to [[friction]] or [[Drag (physics)|drag]] forces (such forces have velocity dependence).  This is a generalized [[D'Alembert's principle]], where the usual form of the principle has vanishing virtual work with &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C}(q,\dot{q},t)=0&lt;/math&gt;.

The Udwadia–Kalaba equation is modified by an additional non-ideal constraint term to

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{M}\ddot{\mathbf{q}} = \mathbf{Q} + \mathbf{M}^{1/2}\left(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{M}^{-1/2}\right)^+(\mathbf{b}-\mathbf{A}\mathbf{M}^{-1}\mathbf{Q}) + \mathbf{M}^{1/2}\left[\mathbf{I}-\left(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{M}^{-1/2}\right)^+\mathbf{A}\mathbf{M}^{-1/2}\right]\mathbf{M}^{1/2}\mathbf{C} &lt;/math&gt;

== Examples ==

=== Inverse Kepler problem ===

The method can solve the inverse [[Kepler problem]] of determining the force law that corresponds to the orbits that are [[conic section]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zhang | first1 = Bingzhan | last2 = Zhen | first2 = Shengchao | last3 = Zhao | first3 = Han | last4 = Huang | first4 = Kang | last5 = Deng | first5 = Bin | last6 = Chen | first6 = Ye-Hwa | title = A novel study on Kepler’s law and inverse square law of gravitation | journal = Eur. J. Phys. | volume = 36 | date = 2015 | doi = 10.1088/0143-0807/36/3/035018|bibcode = 2015EJPh...36c5018Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;  We take there to be no external forces (not even gravity) and instead constrain the particle motion to follow orbits of the form

:&lt;math&gt;r=\epsilon x + l&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;r=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is the eccentricity, and ''l'' is the semi-latus rectum.  Differentiating twice with respect to time and rearranging slightly gives a constraint

:&lt;math&gt;(x-r\epsilon)\ddot{x} + y\ddot{y}  = -\frac{(x\dot{y}-y\dot{x})^2}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;

We assume the body has a simple, constant mass.  We also assume that [[angular momentum]] about the focus is conserved as

:&lt;math&gt;m(x\dot{y}-y\dot{x})=L&lt;/math&gt;

with time derivative

:&lt;math&gt;x\ddot{y}-y\ddot{x}=0&lt;/math&gt;

We can combine these two constraints into the matrix equation
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} x-r\epsilon &amp; y \\ y &amp; -x \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \ddot{x} \\ \ddot{y} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{L^2}{m^2r^2} \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The constraint matrix has inverse

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} x-r\epsilon &amp; y \\ y &amp; -x \end{pmatrix}^{-1} = \frac{1}{lr} \begin{pmatrix} x &amp; y \\ y &amp; -(x-r\epsilon) \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The force of constraint is therefore the expected, central [[inverse square law]]

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_c = m\mathbf{A}^{-1}\mathbf{b} = \frac{m}{lr} \begin{pmatrix} x &amp; y \\ y &amp; -(x-r\epsilon) \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{L^2}{m^2r^2} \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} = -\frac{L^2}{mlr^2} \begin{pmatrix} \cos{\theta} \\ \sin{\theta} \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Inclined plane with friction ===

Consider a small block of constant mass on an [[inclined plane]] at an angle &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; above horizontal.  The constraint that the block lie on the plane can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;y=x\tan{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;

After taking two time derivatives, we can put this into a standard constraint matrix equation form

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} -\tan{\alpha} &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \ddot{x} \\ \ddot{y} \end{pmatrix} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

The constraint matrix has pseudoinverse

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} -\tan{\alpha} &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}^+ = \cos^2{\alpha} \begin{pmatrix} -\tan{\alpha} \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

We allow there to be sliding friction between the block and the inclined plane.  We parameterize this force by a standard coefficient of friction multiplied by the normal force

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C}=-\mu m g \cos{\alpha} \sgn{\dot{y}} \begin{pmatrix} \cos{\alpha} \\ \sin{\alpha} \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Whereas the force of gravity is reversible, the force of friction is not.  Therefore, the virtual work associated with a virtual displacement will depend on '''C'''.  We may summarize the three forces (external, ideal constraint, and non-ideal constraint) as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_{ext}=\mathbf{Q}=-mg \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ y \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_{c,i}=-\mathbf{A}^+\mathbf{A}\mathbf{Q} = mg\cos^2{\alpha} \begin{pmatrix} -\tan{\alpha} \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} -\tan{\alpha} &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ y \end{pmatrix} = mg \begin{pmatrix} -\sin{\alpha}\cos{\alpha} \\ \cos^2{\alpha} \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_{c,ni}=(\mathbf{I}-\mathbf{A}^+\mathbf{A})\mathbf{C}=-\mu m g \cos{\alpha} \sgn{\dot{y}} \left[ \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix} - \cos^2{\alpha} \begin{pmatrix} -\tan{\alpha} \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} -\tan{\alpha} &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}\right] = -\mu m g \cos{\alpha} \sgn{\dot{y}} \begin{pmatrix} \cos^2{\alpha} \\ \sin{\alpha}\cos{\alpha} \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Combining the above, we find that the equations of motion are

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} \ddot{x} \\ \ddot{y} \end{pmatrix} = \frac{1}{m}\left( \mathbf{F}_{ext} + \mathbf{F}_{c,i} + \mathbf{F}_{c,ni} \right) = -g\left( \sin{\alpha}+\mu\cos{\alpha}\sgn{\dot{y}} \right) \begin{pmatrix} \cos{\alpha} \\ \sin{\alpha} \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

This is like a constant downward acceleration due to gravity with a slight modification.  If the block is moving up the inclined plane, then the friction increases the downward acceleration.  If the block is moving down the inclined plane, then the friction reduces the downward acceleration.

It shows how [[denotational semantics]], [[operational semantics]] and [[algebraic semantics (computer science)|algebraic semantics]] can be combined in a unified framework for the [[formal specification]], design and implementation of [[Computer program|program]]s and [[computer system]]s.

The book of this title by [[C.A.R. Hoare]] and [[He Jifeng]] was published in the [[Prentice Hall International Series in Computer Science]] in 1998 and is now freely available on the web.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hoare|first1=C. A.

==Theories==
The semantic foundation of the UTP is the [[first-order predicate calculus]], augmented with fixed point constructs from second-order logic. Following the tradition of [[Eric Hehner]], [[Predicative programming|programs are predicates]] in the UTP, and there is no distinction between programs and specifications at the semantic level. In the words of [[C.A.R. Hoare|Hoare]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A computer program is identified with the strongest predicate describing every relevant observation that can be made of the behaviour of a computer executing that program.&lt;ref&gt;[[C.A.R. Hoare]], Programming: Sorcery or science? [[IEEE Software]], 1(2): 5–16, April 1984. {{ISSN|0740-7459}}. {{doi|10.1109/MS.1984.234042}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In UTP parlance, a ''theory'' is a model of a particular programming paradigm. A UTP theory is composed of three ingredients:

* an ''alphabet'', which is a set of variable names denoting the attributes of the paradigm that can be observed by an external entity;
* a ''signature'', which is the set of programming language constructs intrinsic to the paradigm; and
* a collection of ''healthiness conditions'', which define the space of programs that fit within the paradigm. These healthiness conditions are typically expressed as [[monotonic]] [[idempotent]] [[predicate transformer semantics|predicate transformers]].

[[Program refinement]] is an important concept in the UTP. A program &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; is refined by &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; if and only if every observation that can be made of &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; is also an observation of &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt;.
The definition of refinement is common across UTP theories:

&lt;math&gt;P_1 \sqsubseteq P_2 \quad\text{if and only if}\quad \left[ P_2 \Rightarrow P_1 \right]&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\left[ X \right]&lt;/math&gt; denotes&lt;ref&gt;[[Edsger W. Dijkstra]] and [[Carel S. Scholten]]. Predicate calculus and program semantics. Texts and Monographs in Computer Science. Springer-Verlag New York, Inc., New York, NY, USA, 1990. {{ISBN|0-387-96957-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[universal closure]] of all variables in the alphabet.

==Relations==
The most basic UTP theory is the alphabetised predicate calculus, which has no alphabet restrictions or healthiness conditions. The theory of relations is slightly more specialised, since a relation's alphabet may consist of only:

* undecorated variables (&lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;), modelling an observation of the program at the start of its execution; and
* primed variables (&lt;math&gt;v'&lt;/math&gt;), modelling an observation of the program at a later stage of its execution.

Some common language constructs can be defined in the theory of relations as follows:

* The skip statement, which does not alter the program state in any way, is modelled as the relational identity:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{skip} \equiv v' = v&lt;/math&gt;

* The assignment of value &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; to a variable &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is modelled as setting &lt;math&gt;a'&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; and keeping all other variables (denoted by &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;) constant:

&lt;math&gt;a := E  \equiv  a' = E \land u' = u&lt;/math&gt;

* The [[sequential composition]] of two programs is just [[Composition of relations|relational composition]] of intermediate state:

&lt;math&gt;P_1 ; P_2  \equiv  \exists v_0 \bullet P_1 [ v_0 / v' ]  \land  P_2 [ v_0 / v ]&lt;/math&gt;

* Non-deterministic choice between programs is their greatest lower bound:

&lt;math&gt;P_1 \sqcap P_2  \equiv  P_1 \lor P_2&lt;/math&gt;

* [[Conditional (programming)|Conditional choice]] between programs is written using infix notation:

&lt;math&gt;P_1 \triangleleft C \triangleright P_2  \equiv  ( C \land P_1 ) \lor ( \lnot C \land P_2 )&lt;/math&gt;

* A semantics for [[recursion]] is given by the [[least fixed point]] &lt;math&gt;\mu \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; of a monotonic predicate transformer &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;\mu X \bullet \mathbf{F}(X)  \equiv  \sqcap \left\{ X  \mid  \mathbf{F}(X) \sqsubseteq X \right\}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Urania''' is a [[scientific society]] founded in [[Berlin]] in 1888, following an idea of [[Alexander von Humboldt]], by {{ill|Max Wilhelm Meyer|de}} and [[Wilhelm Foerster]]. Its aim is to communicate the most recent scientific findings to the broad public. With its 2000 members,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | publisher = Urania (Berlin)
  | url = http://www.urania.de/die-urania/
  | accessdate = 2008-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Urania organizes more than 1000 events per year which attract about 130 000 visitors. Since its centenary in 1988, the society has awarded the ''Urania Medaille'' annually to individuals who have supported significantly the implementation of its aims. Recipients are [[Nobel laureate]]s in natural science as well as social scientists, artists, and politicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Träger der Urania-Medaille

'''Wang Sichao''' (王思潮; 1938 or 1939 – 17 June 2016) was a Chinese [[astronomer]] and scholar.&lt;ref name="xh1"&gt;{{cite web| last =Yan| first =Yangtze| title =Pluto's demotion stirs mixed feelings| publisher =Xinhua| date =August 25, 2006| url =http://news3.xinhuanet.com/english/2006-08/25/content_5007596.htm| accessdate =2007-04-18| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20090523103317/http://news3.xinhuanet.com/english/2006-08/25/content_5007596.htm| archivedate =May 23, 2009| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pluto==
At the time of his death, Sichao was working as a researcher at [[Nanjing]]'s [[Zijinshan Astronomical Observatory]].&lt;ref name="xh1" /&gt;

In an interview with [[Xinhuanet]], Sichao commented on the [[International Astronomical Union]]'s [[2006 definition of planet|2006 vote]] over [[pluto|Pluto's]] status as a [[planet]]:
{{quote|The demotion is a scientific result and it reflects the current understanding of humankind about the [[solar system]] ... We must first get a clear definition of planets and the solar system, then we can carry out planetary probe missions in a better way.|Wang Sichao|&lt;ref name="xh1" /&gt;}}

==UFO statement==
On August 23, 2010 Sichao stated that he believed [[extraterrestrial alien]]s exist and that their [[UFO]]s have the ability to visit our earth. He also took exception to the recent view presented by British astronomer [[Stephen Hawking]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2010-04/hawking-aliens-are-out-there-and-want-our-resources Aliens Exist, and We Should Avoid Them At All Costs, Says Stephen Hawking]&lt;/ref&gt; that an encounter with between Earth's population and such aliens would be disastrous.

{{quote|If they are friendly to us, we can promote the human beings' civilization through exchange and cooperation with them. If they are not, as long as we prepared for their invasion, we can beat them back based on their weaknesses. After all, they are life entities, they would show their slips.|Wang Sichao|&lt;ref name="pd1" /&gt;}}

Sichao also provided some specific data from quantitative analysis of UFO observations. He informed that between the altitudes of 130 kilometers and 1,500 kilometers, UFOs have appeared many times. He stated that the observed UFOS could fly much slower than the "first cosmic velocity", and some as slow as 0.29 kilometers per second, and that they can fly at the altitude of 1,460 kilometers for more than 25 minutes. He concluded that these UFOs had [[anti-gravity]] abilities.&lt;ref name="pd1"&gt;{{Cite news |author= Wang Qianyuanxue |title= Academician: Aliens exist, but also have weaknesses |url= http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90782/7114409.html |work= [[People's Daily]] |date= August 23, 2010 |accessdate= August 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
