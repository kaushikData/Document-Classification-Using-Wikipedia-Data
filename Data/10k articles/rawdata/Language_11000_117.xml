Technical specification of ASiCs have been updated and standardized since April 2016 by the [[European Telecommunications Standards Institute]] in the standard ''Associated Signature Containers (ASiC)''(ETSI EN 319 162-1 V1.1.1 (2016-04),&lt;ref name="ETSI-ASIC-Part1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Electronic Signatures and Infrastructures (ESI); Associated Signature Containers (ASiC); Part 1: Building blocks and ASiC baseline containers (ETSI EN 319 162-1 V1.1.1 (2016-04)|url=http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/319100_319199/31916201/01.01.01_60/en_31916201v010101p.pdf|publisher=European Telecommunications Standards Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ETSI-ASIC-Part2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Electronic Signatures and Infrastructures (ESI); Associated Signature Containers (ASiC); Part 2: Additional ASiC containers (ETSI EN 319 162-2 V1.1.1 (2016-04)|url=http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/319100_319199/31916202/01.01.01_60/en_31916202v010101p.pdf|publisher=European Telecommunications Standards Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this updated standard is not required by the European Commission Implementing Decision.

==Structure==
The internal structure of an ASiC includes two folders:

* A root folder that stores all the container’s content, which might include folders that reflect the structure of that content.
* A “META-INF” folder that resides in the root folder and contains files that hold metadata about the content, including its associated signature and/or time assertion files.
Such an electronic signature file would contain a single [[CAdES (computing)|CAdES]] object or one or more [[XAdES]] signatures. A time assertion file would either contain a one timestamp token that will conform to IETF RFC 3161,&lt;ref name="RFC3163"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adams|first1=C.|last2=Cain|first2=P.|last3=Pinkas|first3=D.|last4=Zuccherato|first4=R.|title=Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure - Time-Stamp Protocol (TSP)|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3161|publisher=Network Working Group|accessdate=13 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas a single evidence record would conform to IETF RFC 4998&lt;ref name="RFC4998"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gondrom|first1=T.|last2=Brander|first2=R.|last3=Pordesch|first3=U.|title=Evidence Record Syntax (ERS)|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4998|publisher=Network Working Group|accessdate=13 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; or IETF RFC6283.&lt;ref name="RFC6283"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jerman Blazic|first1=A.|last2=Saljic|first2=S.|last3=Gondrom|first3=T.|title=Extensible Markup Language Evidence Record Syntax (XMLERS)|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6283|publisher=Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)|accessdate=13 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cryptomathic-ASiC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ETSI-ASIC-Part1" /&gt;

==How ASiC is used==

One of the purposes of an electronic signature is to secure the data that it is attached to it from being modified. This can be done by creating a dataset that combines the signature with its signed data or to store the detached signature to a separate resource and then utilize an external process to re-associate the signature with its data. It can be advantageous to use detached signatures because it prevents unauthorized modifications to the original data objects. However, by doing this, there is the risk that the detached signature will become separated from its associated data. If this were to happen, the association would be lost and therefore, the data would become inaccessible.&lt;ref name="Cryptomathic-ASiC" /&gt;

==Types of ASiC containers==

Using the correct tool for each job is always important. Using the correct type of ASiC container for the job at hand is also important:&lt;ref name="Cryptomathic-ASiC" /&gt;

===ASiC Simple (ASiC-S)===

With this container, a single file object is associated with a signature or time assertion file. A “mimetype” file that specifies the media type might also be included in this container. When a mimetype file is included, it is required to be the first file in the ASiC container. This container type will allow additional signatures to be added in the future to be used to sign stored file objects. When long-term time-stamp tokens are used, ASiC Archive Manifest files are used to protect long-term time-stamp tokens from tampering.&lt;ref name="ETSI-ASIC-Part1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cryptomathic-ASiC" /&gt;

===ASiC Extended (ASiC-E)===

This type of container can hold one or more signature or time assertion files. ASiC-E with [[XAdES]] deals with signature files, while ASiC-E with CAdES deals with time assertions. The files within these ASiC containers apply to their own file object sets. Each file object might have additional metadata or information that is associated with it that can also be protected by the signature. An ASiC-E container could be designed to prevent this modification or allow its inclusion without causing damage to previous signatures.

Both of these ASiC containers are capable of maintaining long-term availability and integrity when storing XAdES or CAdES signatures through the use of time-stamp tokens or evidence record manifest files that are contained within the containers. ASiC containers must comply with the ZIP specification and limitations that are applied to ZIP.&lt;ref name="ETSI-ASIC-Part1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cryptomathic-ASiC" /&gt;

===ASiC-S time assertion additional container===

This container operates under the baseline requirements of the ASiC Simple (ASiC-S) container but it also provides additional time assertion requirements. Additional elements may be within its META-INF folder and requires the use of “SignedData” variable to include certificate and revocation information.&lt;ref name="Cryptomathic-ASiC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ETSI-ASIC-Part2" /&gt;

===ASiC-E CAdES additional container===

This container has the same baselines as an ASiC-E container, but with additional restrictions.&lt;ref name="Cryptomathic-ASiC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ETSI-ASIC-Part2" /&gt;

===ASiC-E time assertion additional container===

This container complies with ASiC-E baseline requirements along with additional requirements and restrictions.&lt;ref name="Cryptomathic-ASiC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ETSI-ASIC-Part2" /&gt;

==Reduced risk of loss of electronic signature==

The use of ASiC reduces the risk of an electronic signature becoming separated from its data by combining the signature and its signed data in a container. With both elements secured within an ASiC, it is easier to distribute a signature and guarantee that the correct signature and its metadata is being used during validation. This process can also be used when associating time assertions, including evidence records or time-stamp tokens to their associated data.&lt;ref name="Cryptomathic-ASiC" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4024">The '''Child Language Data Exchange System''' ('''CHILDES''') is a [[speech corpus|corpus]] established in 1984 by [[Brian MacWhinney]] and [[Catherine E. Snow|Catherine Snow]] to serve as a central repository for first [[language acquisition]] data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to the Database|url=http://childes.psy.cmu.edu/manuals/01intro.pdf|accessdate=2015-07-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922055720/http://childes.psy.cmu.edu/manuals/01intro.pdf#|archive-date=2015-09-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its earliest transcripts date from the 1960s, and it now has contents (transcripts, audio, and video) in 26 languages from 130 different corpora, all of which are publicly available worldwide.  Recently, CHILDES has been made into a component of the larger corpus [[TalkBank]], which also includes language data from [[aphasia|aphasics]], [[second language acquisition]], [[conversation analysis]], and classroom language learning.  CHILDES is mainly used for analyzing the language of young children and the child directed speech of adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Corpus linguistics: Investigating language structure and use |first=Douglas |last=Biber |authorlink=Douglas Biber |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1998 |isbn=9780521499576}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 1990s, as computational resources capable of easily manipulating the data volumes found in CHILDES became commonly available, there was a significant increase in the number of studies of child language acquisition that made use of it.  CHILDES is currently directed and maintained by [[Brian MacWhinney]] at [[Carnegie Mellon University]].

==Database Format==
There are a variety of languages and ages represented in the CHILDES transcripts.  The majority of the transcripts are from spontaneous interactions and conversations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to the Database|url=http://childes.psy.cmu.edu/manuals/01intro.pdf|accessdate=2015-07-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922055720/http://childes.psy.cmu.edu/manuals/01intro.pdf#|archive-date=2015-09-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The transcriptions are coded in the CHAT (Codes for the Human Analysis of Transcripts) transcription format, which provides a standardized format for producing conversational transcripts. This system can be used to transcribe conversations with any type of language learner: children, second-language learners, and recovering aphasics.  In addition to discourse level transcription, the CHAT system also has options for [[phonological]] and [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] analysis.  The [[CLAN program]] was developed by Leonid Spektor and aids in transcription and analysis of the child language data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The CHILDES Project: Tools for Analyzing Talk|url=http://childes.psy.cmu.edu/manuals/chat.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220000723/http://childes.psy.cmu.edu/manuals/chat.pdf|archivedate=2009-02-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Cantonese language}}
The standard pronunciation of [[Cantonese]] is that of [[Guangzhou]], also known as Canton, the capital of [[Guangdong]] Province. [[Hong Kong Cantonese]] is related to the [[Guangzhou dialect]], and the two diverge only slightly. [[Yue dialects]] in other parts of Guangdong and [[Guangxi]] provinces, such as [[Taishanese]], may be considered divergent to a greater degree.

==Cantonese syllables==
A syllable generally corresponds to a word or character. Most syllables are etymologically associated with either standard Chinese characters or colloquial Cantonese characters. Modern linguists have discovered there are about 1,760 syllables being used in the entire Cantonese vocabulary, which cover the pronunciations of more than 10,000 Chinese characters. Therefore, the average number of homophonous characters per syllable is six.
Phonetically speaking, a Cantonese syllable has only two parts – the sound and the tone.&lt;ref&gt;While most linguists state that Syllable = Sound + Tone, a few prefer to say that Tonal Syllable = Base Syllable + Tone. For the sake of simplicity, this article chooses to use the first equation.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sounds==
A Cantonese syllable usually consists of an initial ([[Syllable onset|onset]]) and a final ([[Syllable rime|rime]]). There are about 630 syllables in the Cantonese syllabary.
 
Some of these, such as {{IPA|/ɛː˨/}} and {{IPA|/ei˨/}} ({{lang|zh|欸}}), {{IPA|/poŋ˨/}} ({{lang|zh|埲}}), {{IPA|/kʷeŋ˥/}} ({{lang|zh|扃}}) are no longer common; some, such as {{IPA|/kʷek˥/}} and {{IPA|/kʷʰek˥/}} ({{lang|zh|隙}}), or {{IPA|/kʷaːŋ˧˥/}} and {{IPA|/kɐŋ˧˥/}} ({{lang|zh|梗}}), have traditionally had two equally correct pronunciations but are beginning to be pronounced with only one particular way by its speakers (and this usually happens because the ''unused'' pronunciation is almost unique to that word alone), thus making the ''unused'' sounds effectively disappear from the language; some, such as {{IPA|/kʷʰɔːk˧/}} ({{lang|zh|擴}}), {{IPA|/pʰuːi˥/}} ({{lang|zh|胚}}), {{IPA|/tsɵi˥/}} ({{lang|zh|錐}}), {{IPA|/kaː˥/}} ({{lang|zh|痂}}), have alternative nonstandard pronunciations which have become mainstream (as {{IPA|/kʷʰɔːŋ˧/}}, {{IPA|/puːi˥/}}, {{IPA|/jɵi˥/}} and {{IPA|/kʰɛː˥/}} respectively), again making some of the sounds disappear from the everyday use of the language; and yet others, such as {{IPA|/faːk˧/}} ({{lang|zh|謋}}), {{IPA|/fɐŋ˩/}} ({{lang|zh|揈}}), {{IPA|/tɐp˥/}} ({{lang|zh|耷}}) have become popularly (but erroneously) believed to be made-up/borrowed words to represent sounds in modern vernacular Cantonese when they have in fact been retaining those sounds before these vernacular usages became popular.

On the other hand, there are new words circulating in Hong Kong which use combinations of sounds which had not appeared in Cantonese before, such as ''get&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;'' (note: this is nonstandard usage as {{IPA|/ɛːt/}} was never an accepted/valid final for sounds in Cantonese, though the final sound {{IPA|/ɛːt/}} has appeared in vernacular Cantonese before this, {{IPA|/pʰɛːt˨/}} – notably in describing the [[measure word]] of gooey or sticky substances such as mud, glue, chewing gum, etc.); the sound is borrowed from the English word ''get'' meaning "to understand".

===Initial consonants===
[[Initial (linguistics)|Initials]] (or onsets) refer to the 19 initial [[consonant]]s which may occur at the beginning of a [[sound]]. Some sounds have no initials and they are said to have [[null initial]]. The following is the inventory for Cantonese as represented in [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]:

Note the [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspiration]] contrast and the lack of [[voice (phonetics)|voicing]] contrast for [[stop consonant|stops]]. The [[affricate consonant|affricates]] are grouped with the stops for compactness in  the chart.

#Some linguists prefer to analyze {{IPA|/j/}} and {{IPA|/w/}} as part of [[final (linguistics)|finals]] to make them analogous to the {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} [[Syllable medial|medial]]s in [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]], especially in comparative phonological studies. However, since final-heads only appear with [[initial (linguistics)|null initial]], {{IPA|/k/}} or {{IPA|/kʰ/}}, analyzing them as part of the initials greatly reduces the count of finals at the cost of adding only four initials. 
#Some linguists analyze a {{IPA|/ʔ/}} ([[glottal stop]]) in place of the null initial when a [[vowel]] begins a sound.
#In casual speech, many native speakers do not distinguish between {{IPA|/n/}} and {{IPA|/l/}}, nor between {{IPA|/ŋ/}} and the null initial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Yip|Matthews|2001|pp=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually they pronounce only {{IPA|/l/}} and the null initial. See the discussion on [[Cantonese phonology#Historical change|phonological shift]] below.

The position of the [[coronal consonant|coronals]] varies from [[dental consonant|dental]] to [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]], with {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/tʰ/}} more likely to be dental. The position of the coronal [[affricate consonant|affricates]] and [[sibilant consonant|sibilants]] {{IPA|/t͡s/}}, {{IPA|/t͡sʰ/}}, {{IPA|/s/}} is alveolar and articulatory findings indicate they are not significantly palatalized by vowels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zee |first=Eric |date=1996 |title=Phonological Changes in Hong Kong Cantonese |journal=Current Issues In Language and Society |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=192-198 |doi=10.1080/13520529609615469}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lee |first=W.-S. |last2=Zee |first2=E. |date=2010 |title=Articulatory characteristics of the coronal stop, affricate, and fricative in cantonese |url=http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/journal/jcl/jcl/chin_lin/38/38_2_6.html |journal=Journal of Chinese Linguistics |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=336-372 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, there was another series of alveolo-palatal sibilants as discussed [[Cantonese phonology#Historical change|below]].

===Vowels and terminals===
{{multiple image  | align = right  | direction = vertical  | image1 = Cantonese vowel chart.svg | width1 = 250 | caption1  = Chart of monophthongs used in Cantonese, from {{Harvcoltxt|Zee|1999|p=59}}| image2  = Cantonese diphthong chart.svg | width2 = 250 | caption2  = Chart of diphthongs used in Cantonese, from {{Harvcoltxt|Zee|1999|p=59}}}}

[[Final (linguistics)|Finals]] (or rimes) are the part of the sound after the initial. A final is typically composed of a main vowel ([[Nucleus (syllable)|nucleus]]) and a terminal ([[syllable coda|coda]]).

A main vowel can be long or short, depending on [[vowel length]]. The vowels {{IPA|/aː, ɐ/}}, {{IPA|/ɛː, e/}} and {{IPA|/ɔː, o/}} are each long-short pairs with corresponding [[formant]]s on acoustic findings,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last= Zee | first=Eric | year=2003 | title=Frequency Analysis of the Vowels in Cantonese from 50 Male and 50 Female Speakers | journal=Proceedings of the 15th International Congress of Phonetic Sciences | volume= | issue= | pages=1117–1120 |url= https://www.internationalphoneticassociation.org/icphs-proceedings/ICPhS2003/papers/p15_1117.pdf |bibcode = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bauer|Benedict|1997|pp=46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the vowels {{IPA|/œː, ɵ/}} are also phonologically analysed as a long-short pair. The vowels of Cantonese are as shown:

A terminal can be a [[semivowel]], a [[nasal consonant]], or a [[stop consonant]]. The semivowel {{IPA|/i/}} is rounded after rounded vowels.&lt;ref name="Diphthong"&gt;{{citation | author=Zee, Eric | year=1999 | title=An acoustical analysis of the diphthongs in Cantonese | journal=Proceedings of the 14th International Congress of Phonetic Sciences | volume= | issue= | pages=1101–1105 |url= https://www.internationalphoneticassociation.org/icphs-proceedings/ICPhS1999/papers/p14_1101.pdf |bibcode = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nasal consonants can occur as base syllables in their own right and these are known as syllabic nasals. The stop consonants ({{IPA|/p, t, k/}}) are [[No audible release|unreleased]] ({{IPA|[p̚, t̚, k̚]}}).

#Finals {{IPA|/ɛːu/}},&lt;ref name="Diphthong"/&gt; {{IPA|/ɛːm/}}, {{IPA|/ɛːn/}}, {{IPA|/ɛːp/}}, {{IPA|/ɛːt/}} and {{IPA|/œːt/}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bauer|Benedict|1997|pp=78–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; only appear in colloquial pronunciations of characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bauer|Benedict|1997|pp=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are absent from some analyses and romanization systems.

A narrow transcription of the vowels that are conventionally transcribed {{IPA|/aː, ɐ/}} is actually {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ɐː}}, {{IPA link|ɜ}}]}}, as both are central and not fully open. The same can be said of the diphthongs {{IPA|/aːi, aːu, ɐi, ɐu/}}, as their actual phonetic realizations are {{IPA|[ɐːi, ɐːu, ɜi, ɜu]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Zee|1999|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; See the vowel charts at the right.

When the three [[checked tone]]s are separated, the stop codas {{IPA|/p, t, k/}} become [[allophone]]s of the nasal codas {{IPA|/m, n, ŋ/}} respectively, because they are in the [[complementary distribution]] in which the former three appear in the checked tones and the latter three appear in the non-checked tones.

==Tones==
[[File:Cantonese tones.svg|thumb|right|Relative fundamental-frequency contours for six Cantonese tones with examples and Jyutping/Yale tone numbers (modified from {{Harvcoltxt|Francis|2008}})]]
Like other Chinese dialects, Cantonese uses [[tone contour]]s to distinguish words, with the number of possible tones depending on the type of final. While Guangzhou Cantonese generally distinguishes between high-falling and high level tones, the two have merged in Hong Kong Cantonese and Macau Cantonese, yielding a system of six different tones in syllables ending in a semi-vowel or [[nasal stop|nasal consonant]]. (Some of these have more than one realization, but such differences are not used to distinguish words.) In finals that end in a [[stop consonant]], the number of tones is reduced to three; in Chinese descriptions, these "[[checked tone]]s" are treated separately by [[Historical linguistics|diachronic]] convention, so that Cantonese is traditionally said to have nine tones. However, phonetically these are a conflation of tone and final consonant; the number of phonemic tones is six in Hong Kong and seven in Guangzhou.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bauer|Benedict|1997|pp=119–120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For purposes of [[tone pattern|meters]] in [[Chinese poetry]], the first and fourth tones are the "flat/level tones" ({{lang|zh|平聲}}), while the rest are the "oblique tones" ({{lang|zh|仄聲}}). This follows their regular evolution from the [[Four tones (Middle Chinese)|four tones]] of [[Middle Chinese]].

The first tone can be either high level or high falling usually without affecting the meaning of the words being spoken. Most speakers are in general not consciously aware of when they use and when to use high level and high falling. In Hong Kong, most speakers have merged the high level and high falling tones. In Guangzhou, the high falling tone is disappearing as well, but is still prevalent among certain words, e.g. in [[Yale romanization of Cantonese#Tones|traditional Yale Romanization with diacritics]], ''sàam'' (high falling) means the number three {{lang|zh|三}}, whereas ''sāam'' (high level) means shirt {{lang|zh|衫}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Guan|2000|pp=474 and 530}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relative pitch of the tones varies with the speaker; consequently, descriptions vary from one sources to another. The difference between high and mid level tone (1 and 3) is about twice that between mid and low level (3 and 6): 60&amp;nbsp;Hz to 30&amp;nbsp;Hz. Low falling (4) starts at the same pitch as low level (6), but then drops; as is common with falling tones, it is shorter than the three level tones. The two rising tones, (2) and (5), both start at the level of (6), but rise to the level of (1) and (3), respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Jennie Lam Suk Yin, 2003, [http://hub.hku.hk/bitstream/10722/40646/1/FullText.pdf Confusion of tones in visually-impaired children using Cantonese braille] (Archived by WebCite® at https://www.webcitation.org/6AK0HT0Vk?url=http://hub.hku.hk/bitstream/10722/40646/1/FullText.pdf?accept%3D1&lt;/ref&gt;

The tone 3, 4, 5 and 6 are dipping in the last syllable when is an interrogative sentence or an exclamatory sentence. {{lang|zh|真係?}} "really?" is pronounced {{IPA|[tsɐn˥ hɐi˨˨˥]}}.

The numbers "394052786" when pronounced in Cantonese, will give the nine tones in order (Romanisation ([[Yale romanization of Cantonese|Yale]]) saam1, gau2, sei3, ling4, ng5, yi6, chat7, baat8, luk9), thus giving a good [[mnemonic]] for remembering the nine tones.

Like other Yue dialects, Cantonese preserves an analog to the [[Voice (phonetics)|voicing]] distinction of [[Middle Chinese]] in the manner shown in the chart below.

|}

The distinction of voiced and voiceless consonants found in Middle Chinese was preserved by the [[Tone (linguistics)#Register tones and contour tones|distinction of tones]] in Cantonese. The difference in vowel length further caused the splitting of the dark entering tone, making Cantonese (as well as other [[Yue Chinese]] branches) one of the few [[varieties of Chinese|Chinese varieties]] to have further split a tone after the voicing-related splitting of the Middle Chinese [[four tones (Chinese)|four tones]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Norman|1988|p=216}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Ting|1996|p=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cantonese is special in the way that the vowel length can affect both the rime and the tone. Some linguists{{Who|date=May 2010}} believe that the vowel length feature may have roots in the [[Old Chinese]] language.

There are also two [[changed tone]]s, which add the [[diminutive]]-like meaning "that familiar example" to a standard word.  For example, the word for "silver" ({{linktext|銀}}, ''ngan4'') in a modified tone (''ngan2'') means "coin".  They are comparable to the diminutive suffixes {{lang|zh|兒}} and {{lang|zh|子}} of Mandarin.  In addition, modified tones are used in compounds, reduplications ({{linktext|擒擒青}} ''kam4 kam4 cheng1'' &gt; ''kam4 kam2 cheng1 "in a hurry"'') and direct address to family members ({{linktext|妹妹}} ''mui6 mui6'' &gt; ''mui4 mui2'' "sister").&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Matthews|Yip|2013|loc=section 1.4.2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two modified tones are high level, like tone 1, and mid rising, like tone 2, though for some people not as high as tone 2. The high level changed tone is more common for speakers with a high falling tone; for others, mid rising (or its variant realization) is the main changed tone, in which case it only operates on those syllables with a non-high level and non-mid rising tone (i.e. only tones 3, 4, 5 and 6 in Yale and Jyutping romanizations may have changed tones).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Yu|2007|p=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in certain specific vocatives, the changed tone does indeed result in a high level tone (tone 1), including speakers without a phonemically distinct high falling tone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alan C.L. Yu|title=Tonal Mapping in Cantonese Vocative Reduplication|url=http://home.uchicago.edu/~aclyu/papers/BLS35.pdf|accessdate=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical change==
Like other languages, Cantonese is constantly undergoing [[sound change]], processes where more and more native speakers of a language change the pronunciations of certain sounds.

One shift that affected Cantonese in the past was the loss of distinction between the alveolar and the alveolo-palatal (sometimes termed as postalveolar) sibilants, which occurred during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. This distinction was documented in many Cantonese dictionaries and pronunciation guides published prior to the 1950s but is no longer distinguished in any modern Cantonese dictionary.

Publications that documented this distinction include:
*Williams, S., ''A Tonic Dictionary of the Chinese Language in the Canton Dialect'', 1856.
*Cowles, R., ''A Pocket Dictionary of Cantonese'', 1914.
*[[Meyer–Wempe|Meyer, B. and Wempe, T.]], ''The Student's Cantonese-English Dictionary'', 3rd edition, 1947.
*[[Chao Yuen Ren|Chao, Y.]] ''Cantonese Primer'', 1947.

The depalatalization of sibilants caused many words that were once distinct to sound the same.  For comparison, this distinction is still made in modern Standard Mandarin, with most alveolo-palatal sibilants in Cantonese corresponding to the [[retroflex consonant|retroflex]] sibilants in Mandarin.  For instance:

|-
|align=center|{{lang|zh|[[wiktionary:傷|傷]]}}
|{{IPA|/ɕœːŋ/}} (alveolo-palatal)
|{{IPA|/ʂɑŋ/}} (retroflex)
|}

Even though the aforementioned references observed the distinction, most of them also noted that the depalatalization phenomenon was already occurring at the time.  Williams (1856) writes:

{{quote|The initials ''ch'' and ''ts'' are constantly confounded, and some persons are absolutely unable to detect the difference, more frequently calling the words under ''ts'' as ''ch'', than contrariwise.}}

Cowles (1914) adds:

{{quote|"s" initial may be heard for "sh" initial and vice versa.}}

A vestige of this palatalization difference is sometimes reflected in the [[Hong Kong Government Cantonese Romanisation|romanization scheme used to romanize Cantonese names in Hong Kong]]. For instance, many names will be spelled with ''sh'' even though the "''sh'' sound" ({{IPA|/ɕ/}}) is no longer used to pronounce the word. Examples include the surname {{linktext|石}} ({{IPA|/sɛːk˨/}}), which is often romanized as ''Shek'', and the names of places like [[Sha Tin]] ({{linktext|沙田}}; {{IPA|/saː˥ tʰiːn˩/}}).

The alveolo-palatal sibilants occur in complementary distribution with the retroflex sibilants in Mandarin, with the alveolo-palatal sibilants only occurring before {{IPA|/i/}}, or {{IPA|/y/}}. However, Mandarin also retains the medials, where {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/y/}} can occur, as can be seen in the examples above. Cantonese had lost its medials sometime ago in its history, reducing the ability for speakers to distinguish its sibilant initials.

In modern-day Hong Kong, many younger speakers are unable to distinguish between certain phoneme pairs such as {{IPA|/n/}} vs. {{IPA|/l/}}{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} and merge one sound into another. Although that is often considered as substandard and is denounced as being "lazy sounds" ({{lang|zh|懶音}}), it is becoming more common and is influencing other Cantonese-speaking regions (see [[Hong Kong Cantonese]].){{citation needed|date=October 2014}} 肚餓 is sometimes read as [tʰoŋ13 ɔː22] not [tʰou̯13 ɔː22], 雪櫃 is sometimes read as [sɛːk33 kʷɐi̯22] not [syːt33 kʷɐi̯22] but sound change of these characters arelimit in that word.

'''Carles Riba i Bracons''' ({{IPA-ca|ˈkaɾləz ˈriβə}}; 23 September 1893 - 1959) was a [[Catalan people|Catalan]] poet, writer and translator.

He was born in [[Barcelona]] and studied Law and Philosophy at the [[University of Barcelona]]. In 1916 he married the poet [[Clementina Arderiu]]. He worked for a time in the School of Librarianship.

In 1922 he travelled to [[Munich]] to study under [[Karl Vossler]]. He completed his classical education by travelling to Italy and Greece in the 1920s. Around this time he collaborated with [[Pompeu Fabra]] on the General Dictionary of the Catalan Language (''Diccionari General de la Llengua Catalana'').

Later he worked in the Bernat Metge Foundation (''Fundació Bernat Metge''), specializing in [[classical studies]], and became lecturer in Greek at the [[Independent University of Barcelona]] in 1934.

Because of his association with [[Republicanism]] and [[Catalan nationalism]], he was compelled to flee to [[Montpellier]], France, after the victory of [[Francoist]] forces at the end of the [[Spanish Civil War]] in 1939. In 1943 he returned to Barcelona, working on translations from classical authors for the Fundació Bernat Metge, of which he eventually became director.

He wrote poetic works including ''Estances'' (1919 and 1930), ''[[Bierville Elegies]]'' (''Les Elegies de Bierville'') (1943), ''Salvatge Cor'' (1952), ''Del joc i del foc'' (1947), and ''Esbós per a tres oratoris'' (1957), as well as translations of [[Constantine Cavafy]], [[Friedrich Hölderlin]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]] and [[Franz Kafka]], and classical works including [[Homer]]´s ''[[Odyssey]]'', [[Plutarch]]´s ''[[Parallel Lives]]'', and dramas by [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]] into Catalan.

Riba's work has been translated into English by [[Joan Gili]] and [[Pearse Hutchinson]].

The famous American critic [[Harold Bloom]] included Riba's poetry in his selection of the [[Western canon]].

'''Club-level seating''' is a special section of seating in modern sports [[stadium]]s and [[arena]]s.

The club level is usually located towards the middle of the stage of seating sections, above the lower deck but below the upper deck. They are usually situated near the [[luxury box]]es, whether right above, right below, or sandwiched between two levels of luxury boxes. Club-level seating is typically considered a more exclusive class of seating than elsewhere in the venue, other than the luxury boxes.

Unlike some luxury box levels, most club levels do not wrap entirely around the venue. Some club levels stop at a certain point, giving way to an expansion of the [[Mezzanine (architecture)|mezzanine]], while others give way to lower-class luxury boxes (such as "party suites"). A notable exception to this is [[Emirates Stadium]] in [[London]], which has a complete tier of club seating.

Club levels normally provide fans several additional amenities than standard seating. Club-level seating is open to the elements, as opposed to the entirely enclosed luxury boxes, which gives more of an outdoor impression at roofless and open-roof stadiums and arenas. Club-level seating is normally bought on a contract basis to allow for maximum profit on the part of the venue.

The club level provides fans with special access to an indoor part of the venue exclusive to fans with special tickets. These areas are climate-controlled year-round and allow access to special restaurants, bars, merchandise stands, and lounge areas of the venue. Concession stands and vendors on the club level also often offer different menus than in other stands to give more of a special feel to the club. These areas are closed off to the rest of the venue, and they usually can only be accessed through the exclusive, private club entrances.

'''Digavalli Venkata Siva Rao''' ([[Telugu language|Telugu]]: దిగవల్లి వేంకటశివరావు, [[IAST]]: ''Digavalli Vēnkaṭaśivarāvu''; 14 February 1898, [[Kakinada]], [[Madras Presidency]], [[British India]] - 3 October 1992, [[Bhopal]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[India]]), or '''Digavalli Śivarāvu''', was a lawyer, historian and [[Telugu people|Telugu]] writer from [[Vijayawada]], [[Andhra Pradesh]].&lt;ref&gt;The National Biography of Indian Literature 1901-1953 Sahitya Academy, New Delhi. Volume 4, p 251, 416,417,419&lt;/ref&gt; He is the author of forty-two books and some 300 articles written between 1924 and 1987. Some of his works are available in the [[Digital Library of India|Indian Digital Library]].

He actively engaged with the [[Indian Independence Movement]] led by [[Gandhi]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;‘Nenerigina Siva Rao garu’ by Kakani Venkata Ratnam, ''Andhra Jyothi'', 10 October 1966&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;‘Two scholar Politicians’ by G. Krishna, ''Indian Express'', 22 Jan 1972&lt;/ref&gt; Siva Rao’s analyses and critiques of British colonial rule drew the attention of the rulers—some of his books and pamphlets were proscribed, and he was accused and tried for sedition in the 1930s. As a volunteer for the [[Indian National Congress]], he was in charge of publicity for [[Krishna District]]. He offered his legal services to many Congress volunteers who were arrested during the [[Salt March|Salt Satyagraha]]. After Independence, he served on various government committees for the [[Telugu language]].

Siva Rao was active in the [[Telugu literature|literary]], cultural and intellectual scene of Andhra Pradesh and formed friendships with many of his contemporaries like Veluri Sivarama Sastry, [[Basavaraju Apparao]], [[Viswanadha Satyanarayana]], [[N. Gopi]], and [[Narla Venkateswara Rao]].

Siva Rao was honoured by the Andhra Pradesh Government in 1966.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The Andhra Pradesh History Congress honoured him twice.

==Family background and education==

Digavalli Venkata Siva Rao was born on 14 February 1898 to Venkataratnam and Suryamanikyamba in [[Kakinada]], a town in what was then the British-occupation authority administered [[Madras Presidency]]. His grandfather, Digavalli Timmarazu (1794-1856), was the English Record Keeper from 1828 at the [[District Collector]]’s Office in Kakinada. He was also the [[Court of Wards (India)|Court of Wards]] Manager for [[Pithapuram]] estate and rose to the position of ''Huzur Serishtadar'' in 1850, which was the highest office a native officer was permitted by the [[East India Company]] to occupy. His administrative decisions were recorded in the Godavary District Manual. Siva Rao’s grandfather also constructed the Sri Bhimeswaraswami Temple at Kakinada in 1828.

Siva Rao lost his father at a very early age and lived with his sister, Seetha Bai, and brother-in-law, Boddapati Purnayya. He studied at [[Calicut]] and [[Bengaluru|Bangalore]] before joining, from 1910 to 1916 in [[Rajahmundry]], the Hithakarini School which was founded by [[Kandukuri Veeresalingam]] (on whom Siva Rao was to later write a book). Thereafter, he studied intermediate (F. A.) and B. A. in [[Madras Presidency College]] from 1916-1920 and obtained a B. L. degree (1920-1922) from [[Madras Law College]]. Some of the students studying in various other faculties who were his hostel-mates during his time in Madras stayed in touch with him and would also become famous: [[M. Bhaktavatsalam]], [[T. S. Avinashilingam Chettiar|Avinashilingam Chettiar]], [[Adavi Baapiraju]], [[Koka Subba Rao]], [[Yellapragada Subbarow]], Velidandla Hanumantha Rao, and [[Kanuri Lakshmana Rao]], to mention a few.

==Early literary activity==

Rajahmundry was a vibrant literary hub. Siva Rao’s literary talents were recognized early in the literary meetings he attended (along with Adavi Baapiraju) which were presided over by such luminaries as Kandukuri Veeresalingam, [[Chilakamarti Lakshmi Narasimham]], [[Chilukuri Veerabhadrarao]], and others.

During his Presidency College days in Madras, he won a Silver Medal in 1918 for his essay "Loyalty". He also received the Bourdillon Prize (including a cash reward of twenty rupees) of Presidency College for 1919-20. In 1922, he received the Powell and Morehead Prize (including a cash reward of 120 rupees) instituted by the College for his essay "Pothana-Vemanala Yugamu".&lt;ref&gt;Hendry John Allen, Principal, Presidency College, postcard dated 21 Mar 1918&lt;/ref&gt; He ran a handwritten-magazine called ''Andhra Vani'' during his Presidency College days.

==Professional, political and literary work==

1922-1930: After he receiving his law degree in March 1922, Siva Rao set up a legal practice in Vijayawada while continuing his literary work. He made a special arrangement with the local Ramamohan Library to receive consignments of books from the [[Connemara Public Library]] in Madras. His publications began in 1927 with ''Pothana-Vemanala Yugamu''. His historical study in Telugu, ''Dakshinafrika'' (''South Africa,'' 1929) was dedicated to Gandhi, who knew no Telugu. The latter wrote to him agreeing, in principle, to the dedication, "provided you do not state anywhere that the dedication is with my permission".&lt;ref&gt;M. K. Gandhi, postcard dated 26 Feb 1927&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contribution to the Freedom Movement==

Siva Rao contributed to the [[Indian Independence Movement]] as a writer and historian, as well as professionally as a lawyer. He became a [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] volunteer. He translated into Telugu several Congress circulars from the leadership. He also devised formats to collect information on the prevailing economic conditions in villages. Volunteers collected this information on their visits and gave it to Siva Rao who compiled and analyzed the information. These analyses were then published in the Congress’ periodic bulletins.

In 1933, he published ''Sahakara Vastu Nilayamu'' (''Cooperative Stores''), ''Bharatdesa Stithigatulu'' (''Comparative Statistics in India''), and ''Adhinivesha Swarajyamu'' (''Dominion Status''). The latter was widely acclaimed.&lt;ref&gt;Editorial in ''The Hindu'' dated 1933&lt;/ref&gt; These, and his other books written during this time, were intended to educate the public and Congress workers on political, economic and [[Constituent Assembly of India|Constitutional matters]].

He was in charge of publicity for the Congress division of West Krishna District, and wrote many pamphlets, booklets and books, some of which he published on his own, while some were published by the District Congress. His analyses and critiques irked the British-occupation's "government", and some of his books and booklets were [[censorship|proscribed]].&lt;ref&gt;Under the Press Regulation Ordinance, see Fort St George Gazette, 1932&lt;/ref&gt; Police searched his house and seized copies of ''Satyagraha Charitra'', ''Nirbhagya Bharatamu'', ''Satyagraha Vijayamu'', ''Daridra Narayaneeyamu'', and ''Satyagraha Bhumi''.

A [[Defence of India Act 1915|sedition]] case was filed against him in 1930, which he contested and won on the grounds that there was no permission from the [[King-in-Council#The Commonwealth|Governor in Council]] for his arrest. During the trial of his case, the circle inspector deposed in the court that Siva Rao was present in the Congress office whenever he went to arrest Congressmen and that he rendered legal advice for them and appeared as [[amicus curiae]] when they were produced in court. The second case against Siva Rao was filed in 1931 but was later withdrawn under the [[Gandhi-Irwin pact]]. He offered his legal services to many Congress volunteers who were arrested during the [[Salt Satyagraha]] and produced in court. Some of them were the Gampalagudem Zamindar (Kotagiri Venkata Krishna Rao), [[N. G. Ranga]], and Velidandla Hanumantha Rao.

He compiled Congress activities in the [[Madras Province]] and sent the information for a chapter in the book ''The rise and growth of the Congress in India'' (1938) by [[Charles Freer Andrews|C. F. Andrews]] and Girija Kanta Mookerjee. He condemned the police excesses during the civil disobedience movement and the questions raised by him were tabled in the [[Madras Legislative Assembly]] through his advocate friend from [[Mangalore]], and Member of [[Tamil Nadu Legislative Council|Legislative Council]], U. C. Bhat.

Siva Rao also worked in the [[Cooperative |Cooperative Store movement]] during this period. He was Secretary for Krishna Cooperative Stores and also Director of Andhra Cooperative Institute. He translated into Telugu the bye-laws and rules of Cooperative Society for Andhra and Gujarat which were printed and circulated. Siva Rao was also the President of Bar Association in the year 1947.

Two of his books during that period were ''English-Telugu Technical and Scientific Dictionary'' (1934). It was approved by the Government’s Textbook Committee. Three other well-noted books by him published during that period were ''British Rajyatantramu'' (1938), Enugula Veeraswamayya’s ''Kasiyatra Charitra'' (1941), and ''Kadhalu-Gadhalu'' (in four parts, 1944–47). These four books were widely acclaimed.

His edition of the travelogue ''Kasiyatra Charitra'' (the first two editions appeared in 1838 and 1860) involved considerable research and annotation of the archaic language of the original. For this, he went to the [[Connemara Public Library|Oriental Manuscripts Library]] in Madras and  studied the first two editions. His edition also incorporated a route map of the journey from Madras to [[Varanasi|Kasi]]. Hence he was given copyright to the work.

While most of his writings were in Telugu, a few articles were also published in English during this period - ''Christianization of India'' (1940),  and ''The Hindu Moslem Civilization of India'' (1941) were published in the bilingual magazine ''Amrutavani'' ("The Immortal Message").

Siva Rao was also instrumental in helping other writers to publish. He was closely associated with the [[Avadhanam|Satavadhani]] Veluri Sivarama Sastry from the early 1920s. The poet had been unable to get his books published. In 1940, Siva Rao had the poet’s ''Ekavali'' printed. Similarly, Basavaraju Apparao’s book ''Apparao Geyalu'' was published posthumously at the instance of Siva Rao.

==Writings 1950-1987==

Siva Rao’s essays appeared in numerous (mostly Telugu) magazines. ''Prajamitra'', ''Korada'', ''Amrita Sandesham'', ''Samadarsini'', ''Grandhalaya Saraswamu'', ''Vasumathi'', ''Prabhatamu'', ''Matrubhumi'', ''Vijayavani'', ''Jaminrytu'', ''Samalochana,'' and ''Andhra Law Journal'' are some of the magazines which published his articles. He often also wrote for the popular daily newspapers: ''[[Andhra Patrika]]'', ''Andhra Prabha'', ''[[Andhra Jyothi]]'', ''Andhra Bhumi'', and ''Visalandhra''.

[[Ayyadevara Kaleswara Rao]], a senior Congressman and Speaker of [[Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly]] (1956–62) was an admirer and nominated Siva Rao as a member to many committees which he constituted and chaired during his tenure as Speaker—the Glossary Committee, Editorial Committee, Translation Committee, etc. After Kaleswara Rao’s death in 1962, all those committees continued under [[P. V. Narasimha Rao]] who was the state’s Education Minister. Under his chairmanship, the Andhra Pradesh [[Sahitya Akademi]] formed a three-member committee for microfilming of manuscripts with Siva Rao as a member.

But soon Siva Rao resigned, first from Translation Committee protesting impositions of [[Hindi]] terms into Telugu. Later on he resigned from the remaining committees as well. Meanwhile, between 1983 (when he turned 85) until 1987, he published 55 articles.

==Research material for scholars==

Siva Rao had a considerable collection of documents as source material. Researchers who benefitted from the material included Kothapalli Veerabhadra Rao, Akkiraju Ramapathi Rao, Y. Vithal Rao, Bandi Gopal Reddy (Bangorey). Andhra Pradesh archives sent emissaries to Siva Rao to collect a few rare documents, some of which were on palm leaves.

Several books have been dedicated to Siva Rao. [[Viswanadha Satyanarayana|Kavisamrat Dr. Viswanadha Satynarayana]] dedicated his novel ''Pralayanayadu'' (1960) which he wrote based on Siva Rao’s study of the [[First War of Indian Independence]], ''1857 Poorvarangamulu''. The historian Bangorey dedicated his book ''Brown Jabulu'' (1973) and ''Thatachari Kadhalu'' (1975) to Siva Rao. Others who dedicated their books to Siva Rao were N. Gopi and Akkiraju Ramapathi Rao. His last book, ''Veeresalingam Velugu Needalu'' (''Veeresalingam: Light and Shadows'', 1985), was a critical biography of the social reformer Kandukuri Veeresalingam, published when Siva Rao was 87 years old.

The '''Eastern Trans-Fly''' languages are a small independent [[language family|family]] of [[Papuan languages]] in the classification of [[Malcolm Ross (linguist)|Malcolm Ross]], that constituted a branch of [[Stephen Wurm]]'s 1970 [[Trans-Fly – Bulaka River|Trans-Fly]] proposal, which he later incorporated into his 1975 expansion of the [[Trans–New Guinea languages|Trans–New Guinea]] family as part of a Trans-Fly – Bulaka River branch.

==Classification==
Wurm himself concluded that some of his purported Trans-Fly languages were not in the Trans–New Guinea family but rather heavily influenced by Trans–New Guinea languages. Ross (2005) removed the bulk of the languages, including Eastern Trans-Fly, from Wurm's Trans–New Guinea.

Timothy Usher links the four languages here, which he calls ''Oriomo Plateau'', to the [[Pahoturi languages]] and the [[Tabo language]] in an expanded Eastern Trans-Fly family.

==Languages==
;Eastern Trans-Fly 
*[[Meriam language|Meriam]] (within the national borders of [[Australia]]), [[Bine language|Bine]], [[Wipi language|Wipi]] (Gidra), [[Gizrra language|Gizrra]]

==Pronouns==

The pronouns Ross reconstructs for proto–Eastern Trans-Fly are,

:{| class=wikitable
|-
| rowspan=2| I || rowspan=2| *ka || [[Clusivity|exclusive we]] || *ki
|-
| [[Clusivity|inclusive we]] || *mi
|-
| thou || *ma || you || *we
|-
| he/she/it || *tab[[vowel|V]]; e || they || *tepi
|}

There is a possibility of a connection here to [[Trans–New Guinea languages|Trans–New Guinea]]. If the inclusive pronoun is historically a second-person form, then there would appear to be ''i-''[[ablaut]] for the plural: ''*ka~ki, **ma~mi, **tapa~tapi.'' This is similar to the ablaut reconstructed for TNG ''(*na~ni, *ga~gi).'' Although the pronouns themselves are dissimilar, ablaut is not likely to be borrowed. On the other hand, there is some formal resemblance to Austronesian pronouns (*(a)ku ''I'', *(ka)mu ''you'', *kita ''we inc.'', *(ka)mi ''we exc.'', *ia ''he/she/it''; some archeological, cultural and linguistic evidence of Austronesian contact and settlement in the area exists (David et al., 2011; McNiven  et al., 2011; McNiven et al., 2006; McNiven et al., 2004: 67-68; Mitchell 1995).

'''Eknath Easwaran''' (December 17, 1910 – October 26, 1999) was an Indian-born spiritual teacher, author, as well as a translator and interpreter of Indian religious texts such as the [[Bhagavad Gita]] and the [[Upanishads]].
 
In 1961 Easwaran founded the Blue Mountain Center of Meditation and Nilgiri Press, based in [[northern California]]. Nilgiri Press has published over thirty books that he authored.

Easwaran was influenced by [[Mahatma Gandhi]], whom he met when he was a young man.&lt;ref&gt;Gandhi's influence on Easwaran is described by Easwaran or others in a variety of publications, including ''[[Gandhi the Man]]'' (e.g., p. 6, 1978 edition), ''[[The Making of a Teacher]]'' (e.g., p. 160, 1989 edition), and ''The Compassionate Universe'' ({{ISBN|9781458778420}}, see chapter 1; chapters 2-8 are structured using Gandhi's [[Seven Blunders of the World|"Seven Social Sins"]]). See also [http://www.easwaran.org/eknath-easwaran.html the biography of Easwaran] posted at his publisher's website (accessed 1 September 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; Easwaran developed a method of [[meditation]] – silent repetition in the mind of memorized inspirational passages from the world's major religious and spiritual traditions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

From 1960 he gave classes on meditation in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. He met his wife Christine at one of these talks. Together with his wife, he  founded the Blue Mountain Center of Meditation in 1961. After a four-year stay in India, he returned to the Bay Area in 1965.

In 1970 he founded ''Ramagiri Ashram'' as a community of dedicated followers in [[Marin County]].&lt;ref name="flinders89" /&gt;

He set up a publishing activity, Nilgiri Press, which printed his first book ''[[Gandhi The Man]]'', telling the story of Gandhi as a spiritual as well as a political leader. His first major work was his 3-volume commentary on the Bhagavad Gita, the ''Bhagavad Gita for Daily Living'', the first volume of which was printed in 1975 and the last in 1984. His book ''[[Passage Meditation|Meditation]]'' on the program of meditation and allied disciplines that he developed first appeared in 1978. By 2018, his methods of spiritual practice had been the focus of two major scientific research programs that had produced thirty refereed research reports.&lt;ref name="oman18"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Oman |first1=Doug |last2=Bormann |first2=Jill E. |title=Eknath Easwaran’s Mantram and Passage Meditation as Applied Indian Psychology: Psycho-Spiritual and Health Effects |journal=[[Psychological Studies]] |volume=63 |issue=2 |pages=94–108 |date=2018 |doi=10.1007/s12646-018-0448-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Dhammapada (Easwaran translation)}}
Easwaran's translations of the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'', the ''[[Upanishads]]'', and the ''[[Dhammapada]]'' [[Dhammapada (Easwaran translation)|(see article)]] have been critically acclaimed. Religion scholar [[Huston Smith]] is cited by the publisher as writing: "No one in modern times is more qualified – no, make that 'as qualified' – to translate the epochal Classics of Indian Spirituality than Eknath Easwaran. And the reason is clear. It is impossible to get to the heart of those classics unless you live them, and he did live them. My admiration of the man and his works is boundless."&lt;ref name="smithq"&gt;Huston Smith, quoted on back cover and on page 383 of Eknath Easwaran (2007). ''[ The Upanishads]'' (2nd, rev. ed.).

{{Main|Essence of the Upanishads (book)}}
''[[Essence of the Upanishads (book)|Essence of the Upanishads]]'' [[Essence of the Upanishads (book)|(see article)]], originally entitled ''Dialogue with death: The spiritual psychology of the Katha Upanishad'', explains how the [[Katha Upanishad]] embraces the key ideas of Indian spirituality within the context of a powerful mythic quest – the story of a young hero who ventures into the land of death in search of immortality. "''Essence of the Upanishads'' is a westerner's guide to this vitally important Indian text and its modern relevance to the Indian mindset and spirituality."&lt;ref&gt;Midwest Book Review Aug-09 http://www.midwestbookreview.com/wbw/aug_09.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Essence of the Bhagavad Gita'', Easwaran places the Gita’s teachings in a modern context and comments on the Gita's view of the nature of reality, the illusion of separateness, the search for identity, the meaning of yoga, and how to heal the unconscious. The book views the key message of the Gita as how to resolve our conflicts and live in harmony with the deep unity of life, through the practice of meditation and spiritual disciplines.

In ''Essence of the Dhammapada'', Easwaran comments on the Dhammapada, sayings attributed to the Buddha himself, presenting it as a guide that gives straightforward teachings about spiritual perseverance, progress, and enlightenment.

A variety of influences of Easwaran's life and work have been documented. Easwaran's students, inspired in part by his teachings about compassion and stewardship for the [[Environmental vegetarianism|environment]], published a well-known vegetarian cookbook entitled ''[[Laurel's Kitchen]]'' (1976), later republished in revised form as ''The New Laurel's Kitchen'' (1986). The book contained extensive nutritional information from a scientific point of view, and sold more than a million copies.&lt;ref name="LKbook"&gt;Laurel Robertson, [[Carol Lee Flinders|Carol Flinders]], &amp; Brian Ruppenthal (1986). ''The new Laurel's kitchen''. Berkeley, CA: Ten Speed Press. {{ISBN|0-89815-167-8}}. The 1986 edition is dedicated to "our teacher, Eknath Easwaran" (p. 13), and the back cover states "over a million copies sold" (see link [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=TsChEsPHL5cC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=laurel%27s+kitchen+million&amp;ots=yPb-N5GaH7&amp;sig=DKnGIWeO_b5i7x9MehXl6Qs3AXA#v=snippet&amp;q=over%20a%20million%20copies%20sold&amp;f=false]). In an introduction to the 1986 edition, [[Carol Lee Flinders|Flinders]] wrote of "the collection of friends who helped produce ''Laurel's Kitchen'' ten years ago," that "we share a commitment to meditation" (p. 20).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wikt|embarrassment of riches}}

An '''embarrassment of riches''' is an [[idiom]] that means an [[:wikt:overabundance|overabundance]] of something, or too much of a good thing, that originated in 1738 as [[John Ozell]]'s translation of a French play, ''[[L'Embarras des richesses]]'' (1726), by [[Léonor Jean Christine Soulas d'Allainval]].

Example: "All four of them have their own cars but there's no room in the driveway&amp;mdash;an embarrassment of riches".

The idiom has also inspired other works and been included in their titles. This includes: ''The Embarrassment of Riches'' (1906), a play by [[Louis K. Anspacher]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0030682/otherworks Louis K. Anspacher, other works at the Imdb]&lt;/ref&gt; and a 1918 [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] of the same name based on the Anspacher play;
a [[Embarrassment of Riches (EP)|2006 music album of this name]] by [[Elephant Micah]]; the history book ''[[The Embarrassment of Riches: An Interpretation of Dutch Culture in the Golden Age]]'' by [[Simon Schama]]; and ''[[An Embarrassment of Riches]]'', a 2000 novel written by Filipino author [[Charlson Ong]].

'''Eugen Wüster''' (10 October 1898 – 29 March 1977) was an [[industrialist]] and [[terminologist]].

== Career ==
Wüster became enthusiastic about [[Esperanto]] when he was 15, soon coming to the fore as an Esperanto translator 
and as the author of various monographs and numerous articles, particularly on questions of Esperanto [[terminology]] 
and [[lexicography]]. He trained in [[electrical engineering]] and later took over his father's factory.

From mid-1918 to 1920, as a 20- to 22-year-old student, he compiled the core of the legendary encyclopedic Esperanto-German dictionary,&lt;ref&gt;[[:eo:Enciklopedia Vortaro Esperanta-Germana]]&lt;/ref&gt; which is still unmatched to this day for its detailed and faithful presentation of the early vocabulary of Esperanto and the usage of its founder, [[L.L. Zamenhof]]. The experience Wüster acquired in compiling this [[dictionary]] formed the basis for his [[Stuttgart]] [[thesis]],&lt;ref&gt;Internationale Sprachnormung in der Technik, besonders in der Elektrotechnik (International language standardization in technology, particularly in electronics), Berlin 1931&lt;/ref&gt; which is regarded as a seminal work on [[Terminology Science]] (2nd edition, Bonn 1966).

Due to his research on international technical communication, the Technical Committee for Terminology Standardization of the [[International Organization for Standardization]] ([[ISO/TC 37]]) was established in 1936.

Wüster forged the international principles of terminology standardization and contributed significantly to the foundations of the modern [[information society]]. The influence of Wüster's terminology ideas has been enormous especially in the medical field, where it has also given rise to a critical reaction.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Smith, Werner Ceusters and Rita Temmerman, “[http://ontology.buffalo.edu/medo/Wuesteria.pdf Wüsteria]”, ''Medical Informatics Europe'' (MIE 2005), Geneva, Studies in Health Technology and Informatic, 116 (2005), 647–652.&lt;/ref&gt;

He taught at the [[University of Vienna]]. The Eugen-Wüster Archives at the University of Vienna as well as at the [[Department of Planned Languages and Esperanto Museum|Esperanto Museum and Department of Planned Languages of the Austrian National Library]] are based on material that he bequeathed.

The Eugene Wüster Prize for outstanding achievements in the field of terminological research has been established under the sponsorship of the Vienna University and the City of Vienna.

== Terminology ==

Wüster collaborated in the compilation and publishing of the first edition of the ''International Electrotechnical Vocabulary'', London 1938. The latest version of this vocabulary is available online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electropedia.org/  Electropedia: The World's Online Electrotechnical Vocabulary]&lt;/ref&gt;

He also worked on problems of [[bibliography]], on reform of [[German orthography]], on the [[Universal Decimal Classification]] system, on problems in informatics. He was an expert concerning saws, edited a model standard dictionary using the example of Machine tools,&lt;ref&gt;The Machine Tool, London 1968&lt;/ref&gt; the latest version of which is available online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/563151 The machine tool: an interlingual dictionary of basic concepts; comprising an alphabetical dictionary and a classified vocabulary with definitions and illustrations. Prepared under the auspices of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe and under the direction of Eugen Wüster.]&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1971 Wüster initiated the founding of [[Infoterm]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoterm.info/ Infoterm]&lt;/ref&gt; which he pro-actively supported until his death.
He left many unpublished manuscripts on various subjects.

'''Georgian''' (ქართული ენა, &lt;small&gt;[[Romanization of Georgian|translit.:]]&lt;/small&gt; {{transl|ka|kartuli ena}}, {{IPA-ka|kʰɑrtʰuli ɛnɑ|pron}}) is a [[Kartvelian language]] spoken by [[Georgians]]. It is the [[official language]] of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].

Georgian is written in its own [[writing system]], the [[Georgian scripts|Georgian script]].

Georgian is the [[literary language]] for all regional subgroups of Georgians, including those who speak other Kartvelian languages: [[Svan people|Svans]], [[Mingrelians]] and the [[Laz people|Laz]].

==Classification==
Georgian is the most pervasive of the [[Kartvelian languages]], a family that also includes [[Svan language|Svan]] and [[Megrelian language|Megrelian]] (chiefly spoken in Northwest Georgia) and [[Laz language|Laz]] (chiefly spoken along the Black Sea coast of Turkey, from Melyat, [[Rize]], to the Georgian frontier).

==Dialects==
{{Main article|Georgian dialects}}
Dialects of Georgian are from [[Imereti]], [[Racha]]-[[Lechkhumi]], [[Guria]], [[Adjara]], [[Imerkhevi]] (in Turkey), [[Kartli]], [[Kakheti]], [[Saingilo]] (in Azerbaijan), [[Tusheti]], [[Khevsureti]], [[Khevi]], [[Pshavi]], [[Fereydan]] (in Iran), [[Mtiuleti]] and [[Meskheti]].

==History==
{{further information|Kartvelian languages|Proto-Kartvelian language}}
{{further information|Old Georgian language}}

{{Georgians}}
The history of the Georgian language can conventionally be divided into:&lt;ref name="woodard"/&gt;
* Early [[Old Georgian language|Old Georgian]]: 5th–8th centuries
* Classical Old Georgian: 9th–11th centuries
* Middle Georgian: 11th/12th–17th/18th centuries
* Modern Georgian: 17th/18th century&amp;nbsp;– present

Georgian shares an [[Proto-Kartvelian language|ancestral language]] with [[Mingrelian language|Mingrelian]]/[[Laz language|Laz]] and [[Svan language|Svan]]. Georgian as separate from the other Kartvelian languages would have emerged in the 1st millennium BC in the area known later as the [[Kingdom of Iberia]]. The earliest allusion to spoken Georgian may be a passage of the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] grammarian [[Marcus Cornelius Fronto]] in the 2nd century: Fronto imagines the Iberians addressing the emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] in their "incomprehensible tongue".&lt;ref&gt;Braund, David (1994), ''Georgia in Antiquity; a History of Colchis and Transcaucasian Iberia, 550 B.C.&amp;nbsp;– A.D. 562'', p. 216. [[Oxford University Press]], {{ISBN|0-19-814473-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The evolution of Georgian into a written language was a consequence of the conversion of the Georgian elite to Christianity in the mid-4th century. The new literary language was constructed on an already well-established cultural infrastructure, appropriating the functions, conventions, and status of [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], the literary language of pagan Georgia, and the new national religion.&lt;ref name="woodard"&gt;[[Kevin Tuite|Tuite, Kevin]], "Early Georgian", pp. 145-6, in: Woodard, Roger D. (2008), ''The Ancient Languages of Asia Minor''. [[Cambridge University Press]], {{ISBN|0-521-68496-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Georgian texts are inscriptions and [[palimpsest]]s dating to the 5th century. Georgian has a rich literary tradition. The oldest surviving literary work in Georgian is the 5th century ''[[Martyrdom of the Holy Queen Shushanik]]'' ({{lang|ka|წამებაჲ წმიდისა შუშანიკისი დედოფლისაჲ}}) by [[Iakob Tsurtaveli]].

{{anchor|Middle Georgian}}
In the 11th century,  Old Georgian gives rise to '''Middle Georgian''', the literary language of the medieval [[kingdom of Georgia]]. The Georgian national epic, [[Shota Rustaveli]]'s ''[[The Knight in the Panther's Skin]]'' ({{lang|ka|ვეფხისტყაოსანი}}), dates from the 12th century.

In 1629, ''[[Alphabetum Ibericum sive Georgianum cum Oratione]]'' and ''[[Dittionario giorgiano e italiano]]'' were the first two books printed in the Georgian language using [[movable type]] in [[Rome]] supported by the [[Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples]] of the [[Catholic Church]] for their evangelical movement in Georgian kingdoms. This marked the beginning of the modern Georgian language.

# Opinions differ on the aspiration of {{IPA|/t͡sʰ, t͡ʃʰ/}}, as it is non-contrastive.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}
# Opinions differ on how to classify {{IPA|/x/}} and {{IPA|/ɣ/}}; {{Harvcoltxt|Aronson|1990}} classifies them as post-velar, {{Harvcoltxt|Hewitt|1995}} argues that they range from velar to uvular according to context.

Former {{IPA|/qʰ/}} ({{lang|ka|ჴ}}) has merged with {{IPA|/x/}} ({{lang|ka|ხ}}), leaving only the latter.

The glottalization of the ejectives is rather light, and in many romanization systems it is not marked, for transcriptions such as ejective ''p'', ''t'', ''ts'', ''ch'', ''k'' and ''q'', against aspirated ''p‘'', ''t‘'', ''ts‘'', ''ch‘'' and ''k‘'' (as in transcriptions of Armenian).

The coronal occlusives ({{IPA|/tʰ tʼ d n/}}, not necessarily affricates) are variously described as apical dental, laminal alveolar, and "dental".&lt;ref name=ipashosted/&gt;

[[Prosody (linguistics)|Prosody]] in Georgian involves stress, intonation, and rhythm.  Stress is very weak, and linguists disagree as to where stress occurs in words.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Aronson|1990|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jun, Vicenik, and Lofstedt have proposed that Georgian stress and intonation are the result of [[pitch accent]]s on the first syllable of a word and near the end of a phrase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Jun|Vicenik|Lofstedt|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The rhythm of Georgian speech is [[Isochrony#Syllable timing|syllable-timed]].{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Georgian contains many "harmonic clusters" involving two consonants of a similar type (voiced, aspirated, or ejective) which are pronounced with only a single release; e.g. {{lang|ka|'''ბგ'''ერა}} ''bgera'' (sound), {{lang|ka|'''ცხ'''ოვრება}} ''tskhovreba'' (life), and {{lang|ka|'''წყ'''ალი}} ''ts'q'ali'' (water).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Aronson|1990|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also frequent [[consonant cluster]]s, sometimes involving more than six consonants in a row, as may be seen in words like {{lang|ka|'''გვფრცქვნ'''ი}} ''gvprtskvni'' ("You peel us") and {{lang|ka|'''მწვრთნ'''ელი}} ''mts'vrtneli'' ("trainer").

Vicenik has observed that Georgian vowels following ejective stops have [[creaky voice]] and suggests this may be one cue distinguishing ejectives from their aspirated and voiced counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Vicenik|2010|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Georgian has been written in a variety of scripts over its history. Currently the ''[[Mkhedruli]]'' or "Military" script is almost completely dominant; the others are used mostly in religious documents and architecture.

''Mkhedruli'' has 33 letters in common use; a half dozen more are obsolete in Georgian, though still used in other alphabets, like Mingrelian, Laz, and Svan. The letters of ''Mkhedruli'' correspond closely to the phonemes of the Georgian language.

According to the traditional account written down by [[Leonti Mroveli]] in the 11th century, the first Georgian script was created by the first ruler of the [[Kingdom of Iberia]], [[Pharnavaz I of Iberia|Pharnavaz]], in the 3rd century BC. However, the first examples of a Georgian script date from the 5th century AD. There are now three Georgian scripts, called ''[[Asomtavruli]]'' "capitals", ''[[Nuskhuri]]'' "small letters", and ''Mkhedruli''. The first two are used together as upper and lower case in the writings of the [[Georgian Orthodox Church]] and together are called ''Khutsuri'' "priests' [alphabet]".

In ''Mkhedruli'', there is no case. Sometimes, however, a capital-like effect, called ''Mtavruli'', "title" or "heading", is achieved by modifying the letters so that their vertical sizes are identical and they rest on the baseline with no descenders. These capital-like letters are often used in page headings, chapter titles, monumental inscriptions, and the like.

==Grammar==
{{Main article|Georgian grammar|Georgian verb paradigm}}

===Morphology===
Georgian is an [[agglutinative languages|agglutinative language]]. There are certain prefixes and suffixes that are joined together in order to build a verb. In some cases, there can be up to eight different morphemes in one verb at the same time. An example can be ''ageshenebinat'' ("you (pl) had built"). The verb can be broken down to parts: ''a-g-e-shen-eb-in-a-t''. Each morpheme here contributes to the meaning of the verb tense or the person who has performed the verb. The verb conjugation also exhibits [[polypersonalism]]; a verb may potentially include morphemes representing both the subject and the object.

====Morphophonology====
In Georgian [[morphophonology]], [[syncope (phonetics)|syncope]] is a common phenomenon. When a suffix (especially the plural suffix -''eb''-) is attached to a word which has either of the vowels ''a'' or ''e'' in the last syllable, this vowel is, in most words, lost. For example, ''megob'''a'''ri'' means "friend". To say "friends", one says, ''megob'''Ø'''r'''eb'''i'' (''megobrebi''), with the loss of ''a'' in the last syllable of the word root.

====Inflection====
Georgian has seven noun cases: [[nominative case|nominative]], [[ergative case|ergative]], [[dative case|dative]], [[genitive case|genitive]], [[instrumental case|instrumental]], [[adverbial case|adverbial]] and [[vocative case|vocative]]. An interesting feature of Georgian is that, while the subject of a sentence is generally  in the nominative case, and the object is in the [[accusative case]] (or dative), in Georgian, one can find this reversed in many situations (this depends mainly on the character of the verb). This is called the [[dative construction]]. In the past tense of the transitive verbs, and in the present tense of the verb "to know", the subject is in the ergative case.

===Syntax===
* Georgian is a [[left-branching]] language, in which adjectives precede nouns, [[Possession (linguistics)|possessors]] precede possessions, objects normally precede verbs, and [[postpositions]] are used instead of [[prepositions]].
* Each postposition (whether a suffix or a separate word) requires the modified noun to be in a specific case. (This is similar to the way prepositions govern specific cases in many [[Indo-European languages]] such as [[German language|German]], [[Latin language|Latin]], or [[Russian language|Russian]].)
* Georgian is a [[pro-drop]] language:  both subject and object pronouns are frequently omitted except for emphasis or to resolve ambiguity.
* A study by Skopeteas ''et al.'' concluded that Georgian word order tends to place the [[Focus (linguistics)|focus]] of a sentence immediately before the verb, and the [[Topic (linguistics)|topic]] before the focus.  A subject–object–verb ([[subject–object–verb|SOV]]) word order is common in idiomatic expressions and when the focus of a sentence is on the object.  A subject–verb–object ([[subject–verb–object|SVO]]) word order is common when the focus is on the subject, or in longer sentences.  Object-initial word orders ([[Object–subject–verb|OSV]] or [[Object–verb–subject|OVS]]) are also possible, but less common.  Verb-initial word orders including both subject and object ([[verb–subject–object|VSO]] or [[verb–object–subject|VOS]]) are extremely rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Skopeteas|Féry|Asatiani|2009|pp=2–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Georgian has no [[grammatical gender]]; even the pronouns are gender-neutral.
* Georgian has no [[Article (grammar)|article]]s. Therefore, for example, "guest", "a guest" and "the guest" are said in the same way. In [[relative clause]]s, however, it is possible to establish the meaning of the definite article through use of some particles.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

==Vocabulary==
Georgian has a rich [[derivation (linguistics)|word-derivation]] system. By using a root, and adding some definite prefixes and suffixes, one can derive many nouns and adjectives from the root. For example, from the root -''kartv''-, the following words can be derived: ''Kartv'''eli''''' (a Georgian person), ''Kart'''uli''''' (the Georgian language) and '''''Sa'''kartv'''elo''''' (Georgia).

Most [[Georgian surnames]] end in -''dze'' ("son") (Western Georgia), -''shvili'' ("child") (Eastern Georgia), -''ia'' (Western Georgia, [[Samegrelo]]), -''ani'' (Western Georgia, [[Svaneti]]), -''uri'' (Eastern Georgia), etc.  The ending -''eli'' is a particle of nobility, equivalent to French ''de'', German ''von'' or Polish -''ski''.

Georgian has a [[vigesimal]] numeric system like [[Basque language|Basque]] or French, based on the counting system of 20.  In order to express a number greater than 20 and less than 100, first the number of 20s in the number is stated and the remaining number is added. For example, 93 is expressed as {{lang|ka|ოთხმოცდაცამეტი}} - ''otkh-m-ots-da-tsamet'i'' (lit. four-times-twenty-and-thirteen).

One of the most important Georgian dictionaries is the ''[[Explanatory dictionary of the Georgian language]]'' (Georgian: {{lang|ka|ქართული ენის განმარტებითი ლექსიკონი}}). It consists of eight volumes and about 115,000 words. It was produced between 1950 and 1964, by a team of linguists under the direction of [[Arnold Chikobava]].

==Examples==

===Word formations===
Georgian has a word derivation system, which allows the derivation of nouns from verb roots both with prefixes and suffixes, for example:

* From the root -''ts'er''- ("write"), the words '''''ts'er'''ili'' ("letter") and ''m'''ts'er'''ali'' ("writer") are derived.
* From the root -''tsa''- ("give"), the word ''gada'''ts'''ema'' ("broadcast") is derived.
* From the root -''tsda''- ("try"), the word ''gamo'''tsd'''a'' ("exam") is derived.
* From the root -''gav''- ("resemble"), the words ''ms'''gav'''si'' ("similar") and ''ms'''gav'''seba'' ("similarity") are derived.
* From the root -''shen''- ("build"), the word '''''shen'''oba'' ("building") is derived.
* From the root -''tskh''- ("bake"), the word ''nam'''tskh'''vari'' ("cake") is derived.
* From the root -''tsiv''- ("cold"), the word ''ma'''tsiv'''ari'' ("refrigerator") is derived.
* From the root -''pr''- ("fly"), the words ''tvitm'''pr'''inavi'' ("plane") and ''a'''pr'''ena'' ("take-off") are derived.

It is also possible to derive verbs from nouns:

* From the noun -''omi''- ("war"), the verb '''''om'''ob'' ("wage war") is derived.
* From the noun -''sadili''- ("lunch"), the verb '''''sadil'''ob'' ("eat lunch") is derived.
* From the noun -''sauzme'' ("breakfast"), the verb ''ts'a'''sauzm'''eba'' ("eat a little breakfast") is derived; the preverb ''ts'a''- in Georgian could add the meaning "''VERB''ing ''a little''".
* From the noun -''sakhli''- ("home"), the verb ''gada'''sakhl'''eba'' (the infinite form of the verb "to relocate, to move") is derived.

Likewise, verbs can be derived from adjectives, for example:

* From the adjective -''ts'iteli''- ("red"), the verb ''ga'''ts'itl'''eba'' (the infinite form of both "to blush" and "to make one blush") is derived. This kind of derivation can be done with many adjectives in Georgian.
* From the adjective -''brma'' ("blind"), the verbs ''da'''brma'''veba'' (the infinite form of both "to become blind" and "to blind someone") are derived.
* From the adjective -''lamazi''- ("beautiful"), the verb ''ga'''lamaz'''eba'' (the infinite form of the verb "to become beautiful") is derived.

===Words that begin with multiple consonants===
In Georgian many nouns and adjectives begin with two or more contiguous consonants. This is because most syllables in the language begin with certain two consonants. 
*Some examples of words that begin with double consonants are:
** {{Audio|Tsqali.ogg|'''წყ'''ალი}}, ('''''ts'q''''ali''), "water"
** {{lang|ka|'''სწ'''ორი}}, ('''''sts''''ori''), "correct"
** {{lang|ka|'''რძ'''ე}}, ('''''rdz'''e''), "milk"
** {{lang|ka|'''თმ'''ა}}, ('''''tm'''a''), "hair"
** {{lang|ka|'''მთ'''ა}}, ('''''mt'''a''), "mountain"
** {{lang|ka|'''ცხ'''ენი}}, ('''''tskh'''eni''), "horse"
* There are also many words that begin with three contiguous consonants:
** {{lang|ka|'''თქვ'''ენ}}, ('''''tkv'''en''), "you (plural)"
** {{lang|ka|'''მწვ'''ანე}}, ('''''mts'v'''ane''), "green"
** {{lang|ka|'''ცხვ'''ირი}}, ('''''tskhv'''iri''), "nose"
** {{lang|ka|'''ტკბ'''ილი}}, ('''''t'k'b'''ili''), "sweet"
** {{lang|ka|'''მტკ'''ივნეული}}, ('''''mt'k''''ivneuli''), "painful"
** {{lang|ka|'''ჩრდ'''ილოეთი}}, ('''''chrd'''iloeti''), "north"
* There are also a few words in Georgian that begin with four contiguous consonants. Examples are:
** {{lang|ka|'''მკვლ'''ელი}}, ('''''mk'vl'''eli''), "murderer"
** {{lang|ka|'''მკვდ'''არი}}, ('''''mk'vd'''ari''), "dead"
** {{lang|ka|'''მთვრ'''ალი}}, ('''''mtvr'''ali''), "drunk"
** {{lang|ka|[[screeve|'''მწკრ'''ივი]]}}; ('''''mts'k'r'''ivi''), "row"
* There can also be some extreme cases in Georgian. For example, the following word begins with ''six'' contiguous consonants:
** {{lang|ka|'''მწვრთნ'''ელი}}, ('''''mts'vrtn'''eli''), "trainer"
* And the following words begin with ''eight'' consonants:
** {{lang|ka|'''გვფრცქვნ'''ი}} ('''''gvprtskvn'''i''), "you peel us"
** {{lang|ka|'''გვბრდღვნ'''ი}} ('''''gvbrdghvn'''i''), "you tear us"

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1876">A '''ginger group''' is a formal or informal group within an organisation seeking to influence its direction and activity. The term comes from the phrase "ginger up", meaning to enliven or stimulate. Ginger groups work to alter the organisation's policies, practices or office-holders, while still supporting its general goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Schur, Norman W. |year=2013 |title=British English A to Zed: A Definitive Guide to the Queen's English |location=New York |publisher=Skyhorse Publishing |page=152 |isbn=978-1-62087-577-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7945">In [[pragmatics]] (a sub-field of [[linguistics]]), a '''hedge''' is a mitigating word, sound or construction used to lessen the impact of an utterance due to constraints on the interaction between the speaker and addressee, such as politeness, softening the blow, avoiding the appearance of bragging and others. Typically, they are [[adjectives]] or [[Adverbs|adverb]]s, but can also consist of [[clauses]] such as one use of [[Tag question|tag questions]]. It could be regarded as a form of [[euphemism]]. Hedges are considered in linguistics to be tools of [[epistemic modality]]; allowing the speaker to signal his or her degree of confidence in a connected assertion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kranich|first=Svenja|date=January 2011|title=To hedge or not to hedge: the use of epistemic modal expressions in popular science in English texts, English–German translations, and German original texts|url=https://www-degruyter-com.ezproxy.uta.edu/view/j/text.2011.31.issue-1/text.2011.004/text.2011.004.xml|journal=Text &amp; Talk|volume=31|pages=77- 99|via=De Gruyter}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hedges are also used to distinguish items into multiple categories, where items can be in a certain category to an extent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fraser|first=Bruce|date=2010-08-26|title=Pragmatic Competence: The Case of Hedging|url=https://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/books/b9789004253247s003|journal=New Approaches to Hedging|language=en|pages=15–34|doi=10.1163/9789004253247_003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hedges and Their Uses ==
Hedges may take the form of many different parts of speech, for example:

#''There might just be a few '''insignificant''' problems we need to address.'' (adjective)
#''The party was '''somewhat''' spoiled by the return of the parents.'' (adverb)
#'''''I'm not an expert but''' you might want to try restarting your computer.'' (clause)
#''That's false, '''isn't it?'''''  (tag question clause)

=== Epistemic Hedges ===
In some cases'', "I don't know"'' functions as a prepositioned hedge—a forward-looking stance marker displaying that the speaker is not fully committed to what follows in their turn of talk&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weatherall|first=Ann|date=2011-10|title=I don't knowas a Prepositioned Epistemic Hedge|url=https://doi-org.ezproxy.uta.edu/10.1080/08351813.2011.619310|journal=Research on Language &amp; Social Interaction|language=en|volume=44|issue=4|pages=317–337|doi=10.1080/08351813.2011.619310|issn=0835-1813}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hedges may intentionally or unintentionally be employed in both spoken and written language since they are crucially important in [[communication]]. Hedges help speakers and writers indicate more precisely how the [[cooperative principle]] (expectations of quantity, quality, manner, and relevance) is observed in assessments{{fact|date=September 2012}}.  For example,&lt;/p&gt;

#''All I know'' is smoking is harmful to your health.
#:In (1), it can be observed that information conveyed by the speaker is limited by adding ''all I know''. By so saying, the speaker wants to inform that they are not only making an assertion but observing the maxim of quantity as well.
#''They told me that'' they are married.
#:If the speaker were to say simply ''They are married'' and did not know for sure if that were the case, they might violate the maxim of quality, since they were saying something that they do not know to be true or false. By prefacing the remark with ''They told me that'', the speaker wants to confirm that they are observing the conversational maxim of quality.
#I am not sure if all of these are clear to you, ''but this is what I know''.
#:The above example (3) shows that hedges are good indications the speakers are not only conscious of the maxim of manner, but they are also trying to observe them.
#''By the way'', you like this car?
#:By using ''by the way'', what has been said by the speakers is not relevant to the moment in which the conversation takes place. Such a hedge can be found in the middle of speakers' conversation as the speaker wants to switch to another [[Topic (linguistics)|topic]] that is different from the previous one. Therefore, ''by  the way'' functions as a hedge indicating that the speaker wants to drift into another topic or to stop the previous topic

=== Hedges in Different Languages ===
Hedges are used as a tool of communication and are found in all of the world's languages&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hennecke|first=Inga|date=June 2015|title=The impact of pragmatic markers and hedging on sentence comprehension: a case study of comme and genre|url=https://www-cambridge-org.ezproxy.uta.edu/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/DA0948E71A38436AC582AD6F350FF3AB/S0959269516000247a.pdf/impact_of_pragmatic_markers_and_hedging_on_sentence_comprehension_a_case_study_of_comme_and_genre.pdf|journal=Journal of French Language Studies|volume=27|pages=1-26|via=Cambridge Core}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Examples of hedges in languages besides English are as follow:

*''genre (''French)
**Il était'', genre,'' grand (He was, ''like,'' tall.)
*Ich weiß nicht (German)
**when this phrase has full syntactic [[Complement (linguistics)|complementation]], speakers emphasize their lack of knowledge or display reluctance to answer. However, without an object complement, speakers display uncertainty about the truth of the following proposition or about its sufficiency as an answer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Helmer|first=Henrike|last2=Reineke|first2=Silke|last3=Deppermann|first3=Arnulf|date=2016-12|title=A range of uses of negative epistemic constructions in German: ICH WEIß NICHT as a resource for dispreferred actions|url=https://doi-org.ezproxy.uta.edu/10.1016/j.pragma.2016.06.002|journal=Journal of Pragmatics|language=en|volume=106|pages=97–114|doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2016.06.002|issn=0378-2166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hedges in Fuzzy Language ===
Fuzzy language means that it is unclear or vague. Hedges can make sentences fuzzy or less fuzzy. Hedges in fuzzy language can be used to create sarcasm to make sentences more vague in written form.

#Sapphire works ''really'' hard.
#:In this sentence, the word ''really'' can make the sentence fuzzy depending on the tone of the sentence. It could be serious (where Sapphire is really hard working and deserves a raise or promotion) or sarcastic (where Sapphire is not contributing to the work).
#Alejandra ''sure'' nailed her phonetics exam.
#:In this sentence, ''sure'' is used with sarcasm to create vagueness.

=== Evasive Hedging ===
Hedging can be used as an evasive tool. This can be used when expectations are not met or people avoid answering a question. This can be shown below: 

1. 

A: What did you think of Steve? 

B: ''As far as I can tell,'' he seems like a good guy. 

2. 

A: What did you think about Erica's  presentation 

B: ''I mean,'' it wasn't the best.

=== Politeness ===
Hedges can also be used to politely give commands and requests to others.

A hospitality entertainment network enables hotels to receive voice, video and data services from a [[Multi system operator|service operator]] and distribute them to guest rooms via a [[Set-top box|set-top]] or [[Set-Back Box]] or a [[Gateway (telecommunications)|gateway]].  The same network can also be used to deliver music and on-demand video services as well as web browsing and additional interactive services such as time-shift, self-serve billing and hotel services information to hotel guests via the in-room TVs.

Historically a hospitality entertainment network used [[coaxial]] (coax) copper cables, while modern networks take advantage of IP over [[Cat 5]]/[[Cat 6|6]]/[[Cat 7 cable|7]] copper cabling or [[optical fibre]] – or a combination of both.

Hotel operators can choose a turn-key service from a service operator that will provide both the infrastructure and [[customer premises equipment]] as well as the voice, data and video services, or select a specialist systems integrator to lease the infrastructure and a separate services provider.

Companies currently offering hospitality entertainment solutions include:

*Charter Communications 
*CoxHN
*Time Warner Cable
*Quadriga

An '''interpretant''', in [[semiotics]], is the effect of a [[Sign (semiotics)|sign]] on someone who reads or comprehends it. The concept of "interpretant" is part of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]]'s "triadic" theory of the sign. For Peirce, the interpretant is an element that allows taking a ''representamen'' for the sign of an ''object'', and is also the "effect" of the process of ''semeiosis'' or signification.

Peirce delineates three types of interpretants: the immediate, the dynamical, and the final or normal.

==Immediate Interpretant==
"The Immediate Interpretant consists in the Quality of the Impression that a sign is fit to produce, not to any actual reaction." (Letter to William James, CP 8.315, 1909)

==Dynamical Interpretant==
"[The] Dynamical Interpretant consists in direct effect actually produced by a Sign upon an Interpreter of it. [---] [The] Dynamical Interpretant is that which is experienced in each act of Interpretation and is different in each from that of the other... [it] is a single actual event." (Letter to Lady Welby, SS 110-1, 1909)

==Final or Normal Interpretant==
"[The] Final Interpretant is [...] the effect the Sign would produce in any mind upon which the circumstances should permit it to work out its full effect. [---] ...[It] is the one Interpretative result to which every Interpreter is destined to come if the Sign is sufficiently considered. [---] The Final Interpretant is that toward which the actual tends." (Letter to Lady Welby, SS 110-1, 1909)

'''Italo-Australian'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culturitalia.info/ARCHIVIO/siena/97_2/rando.htm Italian Australian dialect (in Italian)]&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[italian language|Italian]] dialect developing in [[Australia]] that is spoken by [[Italian Australian|Australians of Italian descent]].&lt;ref&gt;Tullio De Mauro. "Storia Della Lingua Italiana" (p.79)&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Characteristics==

The exact number of speakers is unknown, but it is highly speculated that the language is mainly spoken by the younger generations, passed on by the elder ancestors, who created the language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coasit.org.au/Events/Who-are-we-Australian-Italian-languages-and-identity-across.aspx Identity]&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers think that can be spoken by nearly 900,000 Italian Australians in 2012.

==Origin==

The foundation of this dialect is the [[Italian Language|Modern Italian Language]], which was brought to Australia following the [[Italian diaspora]] in the post [[World War I|World War One era]]. It wasn't until the years after the second diaspora after [[World War Two]] that the dialect came into note.{{according to whom|date=April 2015}}

The language was simply created with modern Italian words being influenced by the vocabulary of the [[English language]], to create Italian/English words. Some words being of Italian spelling changing to an English only with a few character changes to make it sound Italian.&lt;ref&gt;Tullio De Mauro. "Storia Della Lingua Italiana" (p.102)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Italians|Italian]] [[linguist]] [[Tullio De Mauro]] has noted the dialect in his famous book 'Storia Della Lingua' as "developing dialect that is still enduring the modern influences of English".

De Mauro also claims the language is growing with the vocabulary being passed onto the younger generations of [[Italian Australian]]s.

==Common words==

Italian is said to be the foundation, and English is said to be the influence, according to De Mauro.

'''Gaius Julius Caesar'''{{efn|The [[Classical Latin]] spelling and [[Latin spelling and pronunciation|reconstructed Classical Latin pronunciation]] of his name is Gaius Iulius Caesar, {{IPA-la|ˈɡaː.i.ʊs ˈjuː.li.ʊs ˈkae̯.sar|lang}}. His titulary name was ''Imperator Gaius Iulius Gai(i) filius Gai(i) nepos Caesar Patris Patriae'' "Commander Gaius Julius Caesar, son of Gaius, grandson of Gaius, Father of his Country", {{IPA-la|ɪm.pɛˈraː.tɔr ˈgaː.i.ʊs ˈjuː.li.ʊs ˈgaː.i.iː ˈfiː.li.ʊs ˈgaː.i.iː ˈnɛ.poːs ˈkae̯.sar ˈpa.trɪs ˈpa.tri.ae̯|pron}} (Suetonius, ''Divus Julius'' 76.1).

There is some dispute over the year of Caesar's birth. Some scholars have made a case for 101 or 102&amp;nbsp;BC as the year of his birth, based on the dates that he held certain magistracies, but scholarly consensus favors 100&amp;nbsp;BC. Similarly, some scholars prefer 12 July, but most give 13 July. Goldsworthy, [https://books.google.com/books?id=oR-ljeBaWIcC&amp;pg=PA30 p. 30],  Ward, Heichelheim, &amp; Yeo [https://books.google.com/books?id=9Q83DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA194 p. 194]. For a source arguing for 12 July, see Badian in Griffin (ed.)

See Blackburn, B and Holford-Strevens, L. (1999 corrected 2003). ''The Oxford Companion to the Year''. Oxford University Press. p. 671. {{ISBN|978-0-19-214231-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; known by his [[Nomen (Roman name)|nomen]] and [[cognomen]] '''Julius Caesar''', was a Roman politician and military general who played a critical role in the events that led to the demise of the [[Roman Republic]] and the rise of the [[Roman Empire]]. He is also known as an author of [[Latin]] prose.

In 60 BC, Caesar, [[Marcus Licinius Crassus|Crassus]] and [[Pompey]] formed the [[First Triumvirate]], a political alliance that dominated [[Roman politics]] for several years. Their attempts to amass power as ''[[Populares]]'' were opposed by the ''[[Optimates]]'' within the [[Roman Senate]], among them [[Cato the Younger]] with the frequent support of [[Cicero]]. Caesar rose to become one of the most powerful politicians in the Roman Republic through a number of his accomplishments, notably his victories in the [[Gallic Wars]], completed by 51&amp;nbsp;BC. During this time, Caesar became the first Roman general to cross both the Channel and the Rhine, when he built a [[Caesar's Rhine bridges|bridge across the Rhine]] and crossed the Channel to [[Caesar's invasions of Britain|invade Britain]]. Caesar's wars extended Rome's territory to the [[English Channel]] and the [[Rhine]]. These achievements granted him unmatched military power and threatened to eclipse the standing of Pompey, who had realigned himself with the Senate after the [[Battle of Carrhae|death of Crassus]] in 53&amp;nbsp;BC. With the Gallic Wars concluded, the Senate ordered Caesar to step down from his military command and return to Rome. Leaving his command in Gaul meant losing his immunity from being charged as a criminal for waging unsanctioned wars. As a result, Caesar found himself with no other options but to [[Caesar's Civil War#Crossing the Rubicon|cross the Rubicon]] with the [[Legio XIII Gemina|13th Legion]], leaving his province and illegally entering [[Roman Italy]] under arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Keppie|first=Lawrence|title=The making of the Roman Army: from Republic to Empire|year=1998|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|location=Norman, OK|isbn=978-0-8061-3014-9|page=102|chapter=The approach of civil war}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Caesar's Civil War|Civil war resulted]], and Caesar's victory in the war put him in an unrivalled position of power and influence.

After assuming control of government, Caesar began a programme of social and governmental reforms, including the creation of the [[Julian calendar]]. He gave citizenship to many residents of far regions of the Roman Empire. He initiated land reform and support for veterans. He centralised the bureaucracy of the Republic and was eventually proclaimed "[[Dictator perpetuo|dictator in perpetuity]]", giving him additional authority. His populist and authoritarian reforms angered the elites, who began to conspire against him. On the [[Ides of March]] (15&amp;nbsp;March) 44&amp;nbsp;BC [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|Caesar was assassinated]] by a group of rebellious senators led by [[Gaius Cassius Longinus]], [[Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger|Marcus Junius Brutus]] and [[Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus|Decimus Junius Brutus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html|title=De vita Caesarum|last=Suetonius|first=|date=121|website=University of Chicago|page=107|trans-title=The Twelve Caesars|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120530163202/http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html|archive-date=2012-05-30|dead-url=yes|access-date=|quote=More than sixty joined the conspiracy against [Caesar], led by Gaius Cassius and Marcus and Decimus Brutus.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/plutarch/lives/caesar*.html|title=Life of Caesar|last=Plutarch|first=|date=|website=University of Chicago|page=595|access-date=|quote=...at this juncture Decimus Brutus, surnamed Albinus, who was so trusted by Caesar that he was entered in his will as his second heir, but was partner in the conspiracy of the other Brutus and Cassius, fearing that if Caesar should elude that day, their undertaking would become known, ridiculed the seers and chided Caesar for laying himself open to malicious charges on the part of the senators...}}{{dead link|date=January 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new [[Roman civil wars#Late Republic|series of civil wars]] broke out and the [[Constitution of the Roman Republic|constitutional government of the Republic]] was never fully restored. Caesar's adopted heir Octavian, later known as [[Augustus]], rose to sole power after defeating his opponents in the [[Final War of the Roman Republic|civil war]]. Octavian set about solidifying his power and the era of the [[History of the Roman Empire|Roman Empire]] began.

Much of Caesar's life is known from his own accounts of his military campaigns and from other contemporary sources, mainly the letters and speeches of Cicero and the historical writings of [[Sallust]]. The later biographies of Caesar by [[Suetonius]] and [[Plutarch]] are also major sources. Caesar is considered by many historians to be one of the greatest military commanders in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Battles That Changed History: An Encyclopedia of World Conflict|author=Tucker, Spencer|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2010|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; His cognomen was subsequently adopted as a [[synonym]] for "Emperor"; the [[Caesar (title)|title "Caesar"]] was used throughout the Roman Empire, giving rise to modern [[cognate]]s such as [[Kaiser]] or [[Tsar]]. He has [[Cultural depictions of Julius Caesar|frequently appeared in literary and artistic works]], and his political philosophy, known as ''[[Caesarism]]'' inspired politicians into the modern era.

Caesar was born into a [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] family, the ''[[gens]] [[Julia (gens)|Julia]]'', which claimed descent from [[Ascanius|Iulus]], son of the legendary [[Troy|Trojan]] prince [[Aeneas]], supposedly the son of the goddess [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Froude|first=James Anthony|authorlink=James Anthony Froude|title=Life of Caesar|publisher=Project Gutenberg e-text|year=1879|page=67|url=http://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext05/8cesr10.txt|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209113843/http://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext05/8cesr10.txt|archivedate=9 December 2007|df=dmy-all}} See also: Suetonius, ''[[Lives of the Twelve Caesars]]'': ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#6 6]; [[Velleius Paterculus]], ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2B*.html#41 2.41]; [[Virgil]], ''[[Aeneid]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The Julii were of [[Alban people|Alban]] origin, mentioned as one of the leading Alban houses, which settled in Rome after the destruction of [[Alba Longa]].&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annales'', xi. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; The Julii also existed at an early period at [[Bovillae]], evidenced by a very ancient inscription on an altar in the theatre of that town, which speaks of their offering sacrifices according to the ''lege Albana'', or Alban rites.&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius, iii. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[cognomen]]'' "Caesar" originated, according to [[Pliny the Elder]], with an ancestor who was born by [[Caesarean section]] (from the Latin verb to cut, ''caedere'', ''caes-'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder]], ''Natural History'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plin.+Nat.+7.7 7.7]. The misconception that Julius Caesar himself was born by Caesarian section dates back at least to the 10th century (''[[Suda]]'' [http://www.stoa.org/sol-bin/search.pl?db=REAL&amp;search_method=QUERY&amp;login=guest&amp;enlogin=guest&amp;user_list=LIST&amp;page_num=1&amp;field=adlerhw_gr&amp;searchstr=kappa%2C1199 kappa 1199]). Julius wasn't the first to bear the name, and in his time the procedure was only performed on dead women, while Caesar's mother [[Aurelia Cotta|Aurelia]] lived long after he was born.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Augustan History|Historia Augusta]]'' suggests three [[Etymology of the name of Julius Caesar|alternative explanations]]: that the first Caesar had a thick head of hair (Latin ''caesaries''); that he had bright grey eyes (Latin ''oculis caesiis''); or that he killed an elephant (''caesai'' in Moorish) in battle.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Augustan History|Historia Augusta]]'': ''Aelius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Aelius*.html#2 2].&lt;/ref&gt; Caesar issued coins featuring images of elephants, suggesting that he favored this interpretation of his name.

Despite their ancient pedigree, the Julii Caesares were not especially politically influential, although they had enjoyed some revival of their political fortunes in the early 1st century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Goldsworthy, [https://books.google.com/books?id=oR-ljeBaWIcC&amp;pg=PA32 p. 32].&lt;/ref&gt; Caesar's father, also called [[Gaius Julius Caesar (proconsul)|Gaius Julius Caesar]], governed the province of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]],&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#1 1]; [[Plutarch]], ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#1 1], ''Marius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Marius*.html#6 6]; Pliny the Elder, ''Natural History'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plin.+Nat.+7.54 7.54]; ''Inscriptiones Italiae'', 13.3.51–52&lt;/ref&gt; and his sister [[Julia (wife of Marius)|Julia]], Caesar's aunt, married [[Gaius Marius]], one of the most prominent figures in the Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, Marius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Marius*.html#6 6]&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, [[Aurelia Cotta]], came from an influential family. Little is recorded of Caesar's childhood.&lt;ref name="plutsuet1"&gt;Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#1 1]; Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#1 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 85 BC, Caesar's father died suddenly,&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#1 1]; Pliny the Elder, ''Natural History'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plin.+Nat.+7.54 7.54]&lt;/ref&gt; so Caesar was the head of the family at 16. His coming of age coincided with a [[Sulla's first civil war|civil war]] between his uncle Gaius Marius and his rival [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]]. Both sides carried out bloody purges of their political opponents whenever they were in the ascendancy. Marius and his ally [[Lucius Cornelius Cinna]] were in control of the city when Caesar was nominated as the new [[Flamen Dialis]] (high priest of Jupiter),&lt;ref&gt;Velleius Paterculus, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2A*.html#22 2.22]; Florus, ''Epitome of Roman History'' [[s:Epitome of Roman History/Book 2#9|2.9]]&lt;/ref&gt; and he was married to Cinna's daughter [[Cornelia (wife of Caesar)|Cornelia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsc.csu.edu.au/ancient_history/personalities/rome/caesar/caesar.html|title=Julius Caesar|work=|publisher=|accessdate=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322013940/http://hsc.csu.edu.au/ancient_history/personalities/rome/caesar/caesar.html|archivedate=22 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#1 1]; Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#1 1]; Velleius Paterculus, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2B*.html#41 2.41]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Sulla's final victory, though, Caesar's connections to the old regime made him a target for the new one. He was stripped of his inheritance, his wife's dowry, and his priesthood, but he refused to divorce Cornelia and was forced to go into hiding.&lt;ref&gt;Canfora, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; The threat against him was lifted by the intervention of his mother's family, which included supporters of Sulla, and the Vestal Virgins. Sulla gave in reluctantly and is said to have declared that he saw many a Marius in Caesar.&lt;ref name="plutsuet1" /&gt; Ironically, the loss of his priesthood had allowed him to pursue a military career, as the high priest of Jupiter was not permitted to touch a horse, sleep three nights outside his own bed or one night outside Rome, or look upon an army.&lt;ref&gt;William Smith, ''A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities'': ''[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Flamen.html Flamen]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Caesar felt that it would be much safer far away from Sulla should the Dictator change his mind, so he left Rome and joined the army, serving under [[Marcus Minucius Thermus]] in Asia and [[Servilius Isauricus]] in [[Cilicia]]. He served with distinction, winning the [[Civic Crown]] for his part in the [[Siege of Mytilene (81 BC)|Siege of Mytilene]]. He went on a mission to [[Bithynia]] to secure the assistance of [[Nicomedes IV of Bithynia|King Nicomedes]]'s fleet, but he spent so long at Nicomedes' court that rumours arose of an affair with the king, which Caesar vehemently denied for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#2 2–3]; Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#2 2–3]; [[Cassius Dio]], ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/43*.html#20 43.20]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hearing of Sulla's death in 78 BC, Caesar felt safe enough to return to Rome. He lacked means since his inheritance was confiscated, but he acquired a modest house in [[Subura]], a lower-class neighbourhood of Rome.&lt;ref name="suet46"&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#46 46]&lt;/ref&gt; He turned to legal advocacy and became known for his exceptional oratory accompanied by impassioned gestures and a high-pitched voice, and ruthless prosecution of former governors notorious for extortion and corruption.

[[File:Sulla Glyptothek Munich 309.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Dictator [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] stripped Caesar of the priesthood]]
On the way across the [[Aegean Sea]],&lt;ref&gt;Again, according to Suetonius's chronology (''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#4 4]). Plutarch (''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#1.8 1.8–2]) says this happened earlier, on his return from Nicomedes's court. Velleius Paterculus (''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2B*.html#41.3 2:41.3–42]) says merely that it happened when he was a young man.&lt;/ref&gt; Caesar was kidnapped by [[Ancient Mediterranean piracy|pirates]] and held prisoner.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Caesar'' 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#1 Plutarch, ''Caesar'']&lt;/ref&gt; He maintained an attitude of superiority throughout his captivity. The pirates demanded a ransom of 20 [[Talent (measurement)|talents]] of silver, but he insisted that they ask for 50.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Julius Caesar: Conqueror and Dictator |author=Thorne, James |publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group |year=2003 |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, 39&lt;/ref&gt; After the ransom was paid, Caesar raised a fleet, pursued and captured the pirates, and imprisoned them. He had them crucified on his own authority, as he had promised while in captivity&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, 40&lt;/ref&gt;—a promise that the pirates had taken as a joke. As a sign of leniency, he first had their throats cut. He was soon called back into military action in Asia, raising a band of [[Auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxiliaries]] to repel an incursion from the east.&lt;ref&gt;Goldsworthy, 77-78&lt;/ref&gt;

On his return to Rome, he was elected military [[tribune]], a first step in a political career. He was elected ''[[quaestor]]'' for 69 BC,&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, 51&lt;/ref&gt; and during that year he delivered the [[Laudatio Iuliae amitae|funeral oration for his aunt Julia]], and included images of her husband Marius in the funeral procession, unseen since the days of Sulla. His wife Cornelia also died that year.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, 52&lt;/ref&gt; Caesar went to serve his quaestorship in [[Hispania|Spain]] after her funeral, in the spring or early summer of 69 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Goldsworthy, 100&lt;/ref&gt; While there, he is said to have encountered a statue of [[Alexander the Great]], and realised with dissatisfaction that he was now at an age when Alexander had the world at his feet, while he had achieved comparatively little. On his return in 67 BC,&lt;ref&gt;Goldsworthy, 101&lt;/ref&gt; he married [[Pompeia (wife of Julius Caesar)|Pompeia]], a granddaughter of Sulla, whom he later divorced in 61 BC after her embroilment in the [[Publius Clodius Pulcher#Bona Dea scandal and trial for incestum|Bona Dea scandal]].&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#5 5–8]; Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#5 5]; Velleius Paterculus, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2B*.html#43 2.43]&lt;/ref&gt; In 65 BC, he was elected [[Aedile#Curule aediles|curule aedile]], and staged lavish [[Ludi|games]] that won him further attention and popular support.&lt;ref&gt;Mouritsen, Henrik, ''Plebs and Politics in the Late Roman Republic'', Cambridge, United Kingdom: Cambridge University Press, 2001, p 97. {{ISBN|0-521-79100-6}} For context, see Plutarch, ''Julius Caesar'', 5.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 63 BC, he ran for election to the post of ''[[Pontifex Maximus]]'', chief priest of the Roman state religion. He ran against two powerful senators. Accusations of bribery were made by all sides. Caesar won comfortably, despite his opponents' greater experience and standing.&lt;ref&gt;Velleius Paterculus, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2B*.html#43 2.43]; Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#7 7]; Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#13 13]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cicero]] was consul that year, and he exposed [[Catiline]]'s [[Second Catilinarian conspiracy|conspiracy to seize control of the republic]]; several senators accused Caesar of involvement in the plot.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sallust]], ''Catiline War'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Sallust/Bellum_Catilinae*.html#49 49]&lt;/ref&gt;

After serving as ''[[praetor]]'' in 62 BC, Caesar was appointed to govern [[Hispania Ulterior]] (modern south-eastern Spain) as ''[[propraetor]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kennedy |first=E.C. |year=1958 |title=Caesar de Bello Gallico |volume=III |series=Cambridge Elementary Classics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fto8AAAAIAAJ |location=Cambridge, United Kingdom |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |page=10 |isbn= |accessdate= 26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hammond |first=Mason |year=1966 |title=City-state and World State in Greek and Roman Political Theory Until Augustus |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ujHHZCYh2c0C |location= |publisher=Biblo &amp; Tannen |page=114 |isbn=9780819601766 |accessdate=26 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Suetonius |authorlink=Suetonius |year=2004 |title=Lives of the Caesars |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gs4DPMV7si0C |location= |publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble |page=258 |others=Translated by J.

He turned to [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]], one of Rome's richest men. Crassus paid some of Caesar's debts and acted as guarantor for others, in return for political support in his opposition to the interests of [[Pompey]]. Even so, to avoid becoming a private citizen and thus open to prosecution for his debts, Caesar left for his province before his praetorship had ended. In Spain, he conquered two local tribes and was hailed as ''[[imperator]]'' by his troops; he reformed the law regarding debts, and completed his governorship in high esteem.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#11 11–12]; Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#18 18.1]&lt;/ref&gt;

Caesar was acclaimed ''[[Imperator]]'' in 60 and 45 BC. In the Roman Republic, this was an honorary title assumed by certain military commanders. After an especially great victory, army troops in the field would proclaim their commander ''imperator'', an acclamation necessary for a general to apply to the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] for a [[Roman triumph|triumph]]. However, he also wanted to stand for consul, the most senior magistracy in the republic. If he were to celebrate a triumph, he would have to remain a soldier and stay outside the city until the ceremony, but to stand for election he would need to lay down his command and enter Rome as a private citizen. He could not do both in the time available. He asked the senate for permission to stand ''in absentia'', but Cato blocked the proposal. Faced with the choice between a triumph and the consulship, Caesar chose the consulship.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#13 13]; Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#18.2 18.2]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consulship and military campaigns==

[[File:Crassus (13668007863).jpg|thumb|upright|A Roman bust of [[Crassus]] in the [[Louvre]], Paris, France]]
In 60 BC, Caesar sought election as consul for 59&amp;nbsp;BC, along with two other candidates. The election was sordid – even [[Cato the Younger|Cato]], with his reputation for incorruptibility, is said to have resorted to bribery in favour of one of Caesar's opponents. Caesar won, along with conservative [[Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus|Marcus Bibulus]].&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#13 13–14]; Suetonius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#19 19]&lt;/ref&gt;

Caesar was already in [[Marcus Licinius Crassus|Crassus]]' political debt, but he also made overtures to [[Pompey]]. Pompey and Crassus had been at odds for a decade, so Caesar tried to reconcile them. The three of them had enough money and political influence to control public business. This informal alliance, known as the [[First Triumvirate]] ("rule of three men"), was cemented by the marriage of Pompey to Caesar's daughter [[Julia (daughter of Julius Caesar)|Julia]].&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Letters to Atticus'' [[s:Letters to Atticus/2.1|2.1]], [[s:Letters to Atticus/2.3|2.3]], [[s:Letters to Atticus/2.17|2.17]]; Velleius Paterculus, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2B*.html#44 2.44]; Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#13 13–14], ''Pompey'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Pompey*.html#47 47], ''Crassus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Crassus*.html#14 14]; Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#19.2 19.2]; Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/37*.html#54 37.54–58]&lt;/ref&gt; Caesar also married again, this time [[Calpurnia (wife of Caesar)|Calpurnia]], who was the daughter of another powerful senator.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#21 21]&lt;/ref&gt;

Caesar proposed a law for redistributing public lands to the poor—by force of arms, if need be—a proposal supported by Pompey and by Crassus, making the triumvirate public. Pompey filled the city with soldiers, a move which intimidated the triumvirate's opponents. Bibulus attempted to declare the omens unfavourable and thus void the new law, but he was driven from the forum by Caesar's armed supporters. His [[lictor]]s had their [[fasces]] broken, two high magistrates accompanying him were wounded, and he had a bucket of excrement thrown over him. In fear of his life, he retired to his house for the rest of the year, issuing occasional proclamations of bad omens. These attempts proved ineffective in obstructing Caesar's legislation. [[Roman satirists]] ever after referred to the year as "the consulship of Julius and Caesar."&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Letters to Atticus'' [[s:Letters to Atticus/2.15|2.15]], [[s:Letters to Atticus/2.16|2.16]], [[s:Letters to Atticus/2.17|2.17]], [[s:Letters to Atticus/2.18|2.18]], [[s:Letters to Atticus/2.19|2.19]], [[s:Letters to Atticus/2.20|2.20]], [[s:Letters to Atticus/2.21|2.21]]; Velleius Paterculus, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2B*.html#44.4 44.4]; Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#14 14], ''Pompey'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Pompey*.html#47 47–48], ''Cato the Younger'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cato_Minor*.html#32 32–33]; Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/38*.html#1 38.1–8]&lt;/ref&gt;

When Caesar was first elected, the aristocracy tried to limit his future power by allotting the woods and pastures of Italy, rather than the [[proconsul|governorship]] of a province, as his military command duty after his year in office was over.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#19.2 19.2]&lt;/ref&gt; With the help of political allies, Caesar later overturned this, and was instead appointed to govern [[Cisalpine Gaul]] (northern Italy) and [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]] (southeastern Europe), with [[Transalpine Gaul]] (southern France) later added, giving him command of four legions. The term of his governorship, and thus his immunity from prosecution, was set at five years, rather than the usual one.&lt;ref&gt;Velleius Paterculus, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2B*.html#44.4 2:44.4]; Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#14.10 14.10], ''Crassus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Crassus*.html#14.3 14.3], ''Pompey'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Pompey*.html#48 48], ''Cato the Younger'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cato_Minor*.html#33.3 33.3]; Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#22 22]; Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/38*.html#8.5 38:8.5]&lt;/ref&gt; When his consulship ended, Caesar narrowly avoided prosecution for the irregularities of his year in office, and quickly left for his province.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#23 23]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conquest of Gaul===
{{Main|Gallic Wars}}
[[File:RomanRepublic40BC.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.6|The extent of the Roman Republic in 40 BC after Caesar's conquests]]
Caesar was still deeply in debt, but there was money to be made as a governor, whether by extortion&lt;ref&gt;See Cicero's speeches [[s:Against Verres|against Verres]] for an example of a former provincial governor successfully prosecuted for illegally enriching himself at his province's expense.&lt;/ref&gt; or by military adventurism. Caesar had four legions under his command, two of his provinces bordered on unconquered territory, and parts of [[Gaul]] were known to be unstable. Some of Rome's Gallic allies had been defeated by their rivals at the [[Battle of Magetobriga]], with the help of a contingent of [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes. The Romans feared these tribes were preparing to migrate south, closer to Italy, and that they had warlike intent. Caesar raised two new legions and defeated these tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Letters to Atticus'' [[s:Letters to Atticus/1.19|1.19]]; Julius Caesar, ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico|Commentaries on the Gallic War]]'' [[s:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 1|Book 1]]; Appian, ''Gallic Wars'' [http://www.livius.org/ap-ark/appian/appian_gallic_1.html Epit. 3]; Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/38*.html#31 38.31–50]&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to Caesar's earlier activities, the tribes in the north-east began to arm themselves. Caesar treated this as an aggressive move and, after an inconclusive engagement against the united tribes, he conquered the tribes piecemeal. Meanwhile, one of his legions began the conquest of the tribes in the far north, directly opposite [[Roman Britain|Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;Julius Caesar, ''Commentaries on the Gallic War'' [[s:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 2|Book 2]]; Appian, ''Gallic Wars'' [http://www.livius.org/ap-ark/appian/appian_gallic_1.html Epit. 4]; Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/39*.html#1 39.1–5]&lt;/ref&gt; During the spring of 56&amp;nbsp;BC, the Triumvirs held a conference, as Rome was in turmoil and Caesar's political alliance was coming undone. The [[Lucca Conference]] renewed the [[First Triumvirate]] and extended Caesar's governorship for another five years.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Letters to his brother Quintus'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Cic.+Q.+fr.+2.3 2.3]; Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#24 24]; Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#21 21], ''Crassus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Crassus*.html#14 14–15], ''Pompey'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Pompey*.html#51 51]&lt;/ref&gt; The conquest of the north was soon completed, while a few pockets of resistance remained.&lt;ref&gt;Julius Caesar, ''Commentaries on the Gallic War'' [[s:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 3|Book 3]]; Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/39*.html#40 39.40–46]&lt;/ref&gt; Caesar now had a secure base from which to launch an invasion of Britain.

In 55 BC, Caesar repelled an incursion into Gaul by two Germanic tribes, and followed it up by building a bridge across the Rhine and making a show of force in Germanic territory, before returning and dismantling the bridge. Late that summer, having subdued two other tribes, he crossed into [[Great Britain|Britain]], claiming that the Britons had aided one of his enemies the previous year, possibly the [[Veneti (Gaul)|Veneti]] of [[Brittany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of the British Isles |author=Black, Jeremy |publisher=Palgrave MacMillan |year=2003 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; His intelligence information was poor, and although he gained a beachhead on the coast, he could not advance further, and returned to Gaul for the winter.&lt;ref&gt;Julius Caesar, ''Commentaries on the Gallic War'' [[s:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 4|Book 4]]; Appian, ''Gallic Wars'' [http://www.livius.org/ap-ark/appian/appian_gallic_1.html Epit. 4]; Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/39*.html#47 47–53]&lt;/ref&gt; He returned the following year, better prepared and with a larger force, and achieved more. He advanced inland, and established a few alliances. However, poor harvests led to widespread revolt in Gaul, which forced Caesar to leave Britain for the last time.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Letters to friends'' [[s:Letters to friends/7.6|7.6]], [[s:Letters to friends/7.7|7.7]], [[s:Letters to friends/7.8|7.8]], [[s:Letters to friends/7.10|7.10]], [[s:Letters to friends/7.17|7.17]]; ''Letters to his brother Quintus'' [[s:Letters to his brother Quintus/2.13|2.13]], [[s:Letters to his brother Quintus/2.15|2.15]], [[s:Letters to his brother Quintus/3.1|3.1]]; ''Letters to Atticus'' [[s:Letters to Atticus/4.15|4.15]], [[s:Letters to Atticus/4.17|4.17]], [[s:Letters to Atticus/4.18|4.18]]; Julius Caesar, ''Commentaries on the Gallic War'' [[s:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 5|Book 5–6]]; Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/40*.html#1 40.1–11]&lt;/ref&gt;

While Caesar was in Britain his daughter Julia, Pompey's wife, had died in childbirth. Caesar tried to re-secure Pompey's support by offering him his great-niece in marriage, but Pompey declined. In 53 BC Crassus was killed leading a failed [[Battle of Carrhae|invasion]] of the east. Rome was on the brink of civil war. Pompey was appointed sole consul as an emergency measure, and married the daughter of a political opponent of Caesar. The Triumvirate was dead.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#26]; Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#23.5 23.5], ''Pompey'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Pompey*.html#53 53–55], ''Crassus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Crassus*.html#16 16–33]; Velleius Paterculus, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2B*.html#46 46–47]&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the Gallic tribes were just as strong as the Romans militarily, the internal division among the Gauls guaranteed an easy victory for Caesar. [[Vercingetorix]]'s attempt in 52 BC to unite them against Roman invasion came too late.&lt;ref name="EB_The_Roman_Conquest"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/215768/France/41196/The-press |title=France: The Roman conquest |website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica (company)|Encyclopædia Britannica]] |access-date=April 6, 2015 |quote="Because of chronic internal rivalries, Gallic resistance was easily broken, though Vercingetorix's Great Rebellion of 52 bce had notable successes."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The_first_triumvirate_and_the_conquest_of_Gaul"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/88114/Julius-Caesar/9735/The-first-triumvirate-and-the-conquest-of-Gaul |title=Julius Caesar: The first triumvirate and the conquest of Gaul |website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica (company)|Encyclopædia Britannica]] |access-date=February 15, 2015 |quote="Indeed, the Gallic cavalry was probably superior to the Roman, horseman for horseman.

Pompey, despite greatly outnumbering Caesar, who only had his Thirteenth Legion with him,  did not intend to fight. Caesar pursued Pompey, hoping to capture Pompey before his legions could escape.&lt;ref name=Plu35&gt;Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#35 35.2]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pompey managed to escape before Caesar could capture him.  Heading for [[Hispania|Spain]], Caesar left Italy under the control of [[Mark Antony]]. After an astonishing 27-day route-march, Caesar defeated Pompey's lieutenants, then returned east, to challenge Pompey in Illyria, where, in July 48 BC in the [[Battle of Dyrrhachium (48 BC)|battle of Dyrrhachium]], Caesar barely avoided a catastrophic defeat. In an exceedingly short engagement later that year, he decisively defeated Pompey [[Battle of Pharsalus|at Pharsalus]], in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#42 42–45]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Rome, Caesar was appointed [[Roman dictator|dictator]],&lt;ref name=Plu37&gt;Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#37 37.2]&lt;/ref&gt; with Mark Antony as his [[Master of the Horse]] (second in command); Caesar presided over his own election to a second consulship and then, after 11 days, resigned this dictatorship.&lt;ref name=Plu37/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dictator"&gt;Martin Jehne, ''Der Staat des Dicators Caesar'', Köln/Wien 1987, p. 15-38.&lt;/ref&gt; Caesar then pursued Pompey to Egypt, arriving soon after the murder of the general. There, Caesar was presented with Pompey's severed head and seal-ring, receiving these with tears.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Pompey'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Pompey*.html#80 80.5]&lt;/ref&gt; He then had Pompey's assassins put to death.&lt;ref name=PluPom77&gt;Plutarch, ''Pompey'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Pompey*.html#77 77–79]&lt;/ref&gt;

Caesar then became involved with an Egyptian civil war between the child pharaoh and his sister, wife, and co-regent queen, [[Cleopatra]]. Perhaps as a result of the pharaoh's role in Pompey's murder, Caesar sided with Cleopatra. He withstood the [[Siege of Alexandria (47 BC)|Siege of Alexandria]] and later he defeated the pharaoh's forces at the [[Battle of the Nile (47 BC)|Battle of the Nile]] in 47&amp;nbsp;BC and installed Cleopatra as ruler. Caesar and Cleopatra celebrated their victory with a triumphal procession on the [[Nile]] in the spring of 47&amp;nbsp;BC. The royal barge was accompanied by 400 additional ships, and Caesar was introduced to the luxurious lifestyle of the Egyptian pharaohs.&lt;ref name="Salisbury 2001 52"&gt;{{cite book|last=Salisbury|first=Joyce E|title=Women in the ancient world|year=2001|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, CA|isbn=1-57607-092-1|page=52|chapter=Cleopatra VII}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caesar and Cleopatra were not married. Caesar continued his relationship with Cleopatra throughout his last marriage—in Roman eyes, this did not constitute adultery—and probably fathered a son called [[Caesarion]]. Cleopatra visited Rome on more than one occasion, residing in Caesar's villa just outside Rome across the [[Tiber]].&lt;ref name="Salisbury 2001 52"/&gt;

Late in 48 BC, Caesar was again appointed dictator, with a term of one year.&lt;ref name="Dictator"/&gt; After spending the first months of 47&amp;nbsp;BC in Egypt, Caesar went to the Middle East, where he annihilated the king of [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]]; his victory was so swift and complete that he mocked Pompey's previous victories over such poor enemies.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#35 35.2]&lt;/ref&gt; On his way to Pontus, Caesar visited [[Tarsus, Mersin|Tarsus]] from 27 to 29 May 47 BC (25–27 May&lt;sup&gt;[[Gregorian calendar|greg.]]&lt;/sup&gt;), where he met enthusiastic support, but where, according to [[Cicero]], [[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius]] was planning to kill him at this point.&lt;ref&gt;Caesar: a history of the art of war among the Romans down to the end of the Roman empire, with a detailed account of the campaigns of Caius Julius Caesar, page 791, Theodore Ayrault Dodge, Greenhill Books, 1995. {{ISBN|9781853672163}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul: The Man and the Myth, page 15, Studies on personalities of the New Testament Personalities of the New Testament Series, Calvin J.

He quickly gained a significant victory in 46&amp;nbsp;BC over Cato, who then committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#52 52–54]&lt;/ref&gt;

After this victory, he was appointed dictator for 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Jehne, ''Der Staat des Dictators Caesar'', Köln/Wien 1987, p. 15-38. Technically, Caesar was not appointed dictator with a term of 10 years, but he was appointed annual dictator for the next 10 years in advance.&lt;/ref&gt; Pompey's sons escaped to Spain; Caesar gave chase and defeated the last remnants of opposition in the [[Battle of Munda]] in March 45&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#56 56]&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Caesar was elected to his third and fourth terms as consul in 46&amp;nbsp;BC and 45&amp;nbsp;BC (this last time without a colleague).

==Dictatorship and assassination==

While he was still campaigning in Spain, the Senate began bestowing honours on Caesar. Caesar had not proscribed his enemies, instead pardoning almost all, and there was no serious public opposition to him. Great games and celebrations were held in April to honour Caesar's victory at Munda. Plutarch writes that many Romans found the triumph held following Caesar's victory to be in poor taste, as those defeated in the civil war had not been foreigners, but instead fellow Romans.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#56 56.7–56.8]&lt;/ref&gt; On Caesar's return to Italy in September 45 BC, he filed his will, naming his grandnephew [[Augustus|Gaius Octavius]] (Octavian, later known as Augustus Caesar) as his principal heir, leaving his vast estate and property including his name. Caesar also wrote that if Octavian died before Caesar did, [[Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus]] would be the next heir in succession.&lt;ref&gt;Appian, ''The Civil Wars'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Appian/Civil_Wars/2*.html#143 2:143.1]&lt;/ref&gt; In his will, he also left a substantial gift to the citizens of Rome.

During his early career, Caesar had seen how chaotic and dysfunctional the Roman Republic had become. The republican machinery had broken down under the weight of [[imperialism]], the central government had become powerless, the provinces had been transformed into independent principalities under the absolute control of their governors, and the army had replaced the constitution as the means of accomplishing political goals. With a weak central government, political corruption had spiralled out of control, and the ''status quo'' had been maintained by a corrupt aristocracy, which saw no need to change a system that had made its members rich.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Between his crossing of the Rubicon in 49 BC, and his [[Ides of March|assassination]] in 44&amp;nbsp;BC, Caesar established a new constitution, which was intended to accomplish three separate goals.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 133"&gt;Abbott, 133&lt;/ref&gt; First, he wanted to suppress all armed resistance out in the provinces, and thus bring order back to the Republic. Second, he wanted to create a strong central government in Rome. Finally, he wanted to knit together all of the provinces into a single cohesive unit.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 133" /&gt;

The first goal was accomplished when Caesar defeated Pompey and his supporters.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 133" /&gt; To accomplish the other two goals, he needed to ensure that his control over the government was undisputed,&lt;ref name="Abbott, 134"&gt;Abbott, 134&lt;/ref&gt; so he assumed these powers by increasing his own authority, and by decreasing the authority of Rome's other political institutions. Finally, he enacted a series of reforms that were meant to address several long-neglected issues, the most important of which was his reform of the calendar.&lt;ref name=Sue40 /&gt;

===Dictatorship===
[[File:Caesar-Altes-Museum-Berlin.jpg|thumb|Bronze bust of Julius Caesar, [[Roman portraiture|posthumous portrait]] of the 1st century AD, [[Altes Museum]], Berlin]]
When Caesar returned to Rome, the Senate granted him [[Roman triumph|triumphs]] for his victories, ostensibly those over Gaul, Egypt, [[Pharnaces II of Pontus|Pharnaces]], and [[Juba I of Numidia|Juba]], rather than over his Roman opponents. Not everything went Caesar's way. When [[Arsinoe IV]], Egypt's former queen, was paraded in chains, the spectators admired her dignified bearing and were moved to pity.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' 43.19.2–3; [[Appian]], ''Civil Wars'' 2.101.420&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ludi|Triumphal games]] were held, with [[Venationes|beast-hunts]] involving 400 lions, and [[Gladiator|gladiator contests]]. A [[Naumachia|naval battle]] was held on a flooded basin at the [[Campus Martius|Field of Mars]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;J.F.C. Fuller, ''Julius Caesar, Man, Soldier, Tyrant", Chapter 13&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Circus Maximus]], two armies of war captives, each of 2,000 people, 200 horses, and 20 elephants, fought to the death. Again, some bystanders complained, this time at Caesar's wasteful extravagance. A riot broke out, and only stopped when Caesar had two rioters sacrificed by the priests on the Field of Mars.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

After the triumph, Caesar set out to pass an ambitious legislative agenda.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; He ordered a census be taken, which forced a reduction in the [[grain dole]], and decreed that jurors could only come from the Senate or the equestrian ranks. He passed a [[sumptuary law]] that restricted the purchase of certain luxuries. After this, he passed a law that rewarded families for having many children, to speed up the repopulation of Italy. Then, he outlawed professional guilds, except those of ancient foundation, since many of these were subversive political clubs. He then passed a term-limit law applicable to governors. He passed a debt-restructuring law, which ultimately eliminated about a fourth of all debts owed.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The [[Forum of Caesar]], with its [[Temple of Venus Genetrix]], was then built, among many other public works.&lt;ref name="Julius Caesar, Venus Genetrix, and the Forum Iulium "&gt;{{cite AV media | url=https://class.coursera.org/romanarchitecture-001/lecture/97 | title=Julius Caesar, Venus Genetrix, and the Forum Iulium | publisher=Yale University | people=Diana E. E. Kleiner | medium=Multimedia presentation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caesar also tightly regulated the purchase of state-subsidised grain and reduced the number of recipients to a fixed number, all of whom were entered into a special register.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Ancient Rome: A Military and Political History | author=Mackay, Christopher S. | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year = 2004 | page = 254}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 47 to 44&amp;nbsp;BC, he made plans for the distribution of land to about 15,000 of his veterans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = The Roman Army, 31 BC–AD 337 | author=Campbell, J. B. | publisher=Routledge | year = 1994 | page = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important change, however, was his reform of the calendar. The calendar was then regulated by the movement of the moon, and this had left it in a mess. Caesar replaced this calendar with the Egyptian calendar, which was regulated by the sun. He set the length of the year to 365.25 days by adding an [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalary/leap day]] at the end of February every fourth year.&lt;ref name=Sue40&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#40 40]&lt;/ref&gt;

To bring the calendar into alignment with the seasons, he decreed that three extra months be inserted into 46&amp;nbsp;BC (the ordinary intercalary month at the end of February, and two extra months after November). Thus, the [[Julian calendar]] opened on 1 January 45 BC.&lt;ref name="Sue40"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; This calendar is almost identical to [[Gregorian calendar|the current Western calendar]].

Shortly before his assassination, he passed a few more reforms.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; He established a police force, appointed officials to carry out his land reforms, and ordered the rebuilding of [[Carthage]] and [[Roman Corinth|Corinth]]. He also extended Latin rights throughout the Roman world, and then abolished the tax system and reverted to the earlier version that allowed cities to collect tribute however they wanted, rather than needing Roman intermediaries. His assassination prevented further and larger schemes, which included the construction of an unprecedented temple to Mars, a huge theatre, and a library on the scale of the [[Library of Alexandria]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

He also wanted to convert [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]] to a major port, and cut a canal through the [[Isthmus of Corinth]]. Militarily, he wanted to conquer the [[Dacia]]ns and [[Parthia]]ns, and avenge the loss at [[Battle of Carrhae|Carrhae]]. Thus, he instituted a massive mobilisation. Shortly before his assassination, the Senate named him censor for life and [[Pater Patriae|Father of the Fatherland]], and the month of [[Quintilis]] was renamed July in his honour.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

He was granted further honours, which were later used to justify his assassination as a would-be divine monarch: coins were issued bearing his image and his statue was placed next to those of the kings. He was granted a golden chair in the Senate, was allowed to wear triumphal dress whenever he chose, and was offered a form of semi-official or popular [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|cult]], with Mark Antony as his [[Flamen Divi Iulii|high priest]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

====Political reforms====
{{Main|Constitutional reforms of Julius Caesar}}
[[File:La clémence de César.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|''La clémence de César'', [[Abel de Pujol]], 1808]]
The history of Caesar's political appointments is complex and uncertain. Caesar held both the [[Roman Dictator|dictatorship]] and the [[Tribune|tribunate]], but alternated between the [[Roman Consul|consulship]] and the [[proconsul]]ship.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 134" /&gt; His powers within the state seem to have rested upon these magistracies.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 134" /&gt; He was first appointed dictator in 49&amp;nbsp;BC, possibly to preside over elections, but resigned his dictatorship within 11 days. In 48&amp;nbsp;BC, he was reappointed dictator, only this time for an indefinite period, and in 46&amp;nbsp;BC, he was appointed dictator for 10 years.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 136"&gt;Abbott, 136&lt;/ref&gt;

In 48 BC, Caesar was given permanent tribunician powers,&lt;ref name="Abbott, 135"&gt;Abbott, 135&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=February 2017}} which made his person sacrosanct and allowed him to veto the Senate,&lt;ref name="Abbott, 135"/&gt; although on at least one occasion, tribunes did attempt to obstruct him. The offending tribunes in this case were brought before the Senate and divested of their office.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 135" /&gt; This was not the first time Caesar had violated a tribune's sacrosanctity. After he had first marched on Rome in 49 BC, he forcibly opened the treasury, although a tribune had the seal placed on it. After the impeachment of the two obstructive tribunes, Caesar, perhaps unsurprisingly, faced no further opposition from other members of the Tribunician College.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 135"/&gt;

When Caesar returned to Rome in 47 BC, the ranks of the Senate had been severely depleted, so he used his censorial powers to appoint many new senators, which eventually raised the Senate's membership to 900.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 137"/&gt; All the appointments were of his own partisans, which robbed the senatorial aristocracy of its prestige, and made the Senate increasingly subservient to him.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 138"&gt;Abbott, 138&lt;/ref&gt; To minimise the risk that another general might attempt to challenge him,&lt;ref name="Abbott, 136"/&gt; Caesar passed a law that subjected governors to term limits.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 136"/&gt;

In 46 BC, Caesar gave himself the title of "Prefect of the Morals", which was an office that was new only in name, as its powers were identical to those of the ''[[Roman censor|censors]]''.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 135"/&gt; Thus, he could hold censorial powers, while technically not subjecting himself to the same checks to which the ordinary censors were subject, and he used these powers to fill the Senate with his own partisans. He also set the precedent, which his imperial successors followed, of requiring the Senate to bestow various titles and honours upon him. He was, for example, given the title of "Father of the Fatherland" and "''[[imperator]]''".&lt;ref name="Abbott, 136"/&gt;

Coins bore his likeness, and he was given the right to speak first during Senate meetings.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 136"/&gt; Caesar then increased the number of magistrates who were elected each year, which created a large pool of experienced magistrates, and allowed Caesar to reward his supporters.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 137"/&gt;

Caesar even took steps to transform Italy into a province, and to link more tightly the other provinces of the empire into a single cohesive unit. This addressed the underlying problem that had caused the [[Social War (91–88 BC)|Social War]] decades earlier, where persons from outside Rome or Italy did not have citizenship. This process, of fusing the entire Roman Empire into a single unit, rather than maintaining it as a network of unequal principalities, would ultimately be completed by Caesar's successor, the Emperor Augustus.

In February 44 BC, one month before his assassination, he was appointed dictator in perpetuity. Under Caesar, a significant amount of authority was vested in his lieutenants,&lt;ref name="Abbott, 136" /&gt; mostly because Caesar was frequently out of Italy.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 136" /&gt; In October 45&amp;nbsp;BC, Caesar resigned his position as sole consul, and facilitated the election of two successors for the remainder of the year, which theoretically restored the ordinary consulship, since the constitution did not recognise a single consul without a colleague.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 137"&gt;Abbott, 137&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RSC 0004a.6.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Denarius]] (42 BC) issued by Cassius Longinus and [[Publius Cornelius Lentulus Spinther|Lentulus Spinther]], depicting the crowned head of [[Libertas|Liberty]] and on the reverse a sacrificial jug and ''[[lituus]]'', from the military mint in [[Smyrna]]]]

Near the end of his life, Caesar began to prepare for a war against the [[Parthian Empire]]. Since his absence from Rome might limit his ability to install his own consuls, he passed a law which allowed him to appoint all magistrates in 43 BC, and all consuls and tribunes in 42 BC.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 137" /&gt; This, in effect, transformed the magistrates from being representatives of the people to being representatives of the dictator.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 137"/&gt;

===Assassination===
{{See also|Assassination of Julius Caesar}}
On the [[Ides of March]] (15 March; see [[Roman calendar]]) of 44 BC, Caesar was due to appear at a session of the Senate. Several Senators had conspired to assassinate Caesar. Mark Antony, having vaguely learned of the plot the night before from a terrified ''liberator'' named [[Servilius Casca]], and fearing the worst, went to head Caesar off. The plotters, however, had anticipated this and, fearing that Antony would come to Caesar's aid, had arranged for [[Trebonius]] to intercept him just as he approached the portico of the [[Theatre of Pompey]], where the session was to be held, and detain him outside (Plutarch, however, assigns this action to delay Antony to [[Brutus Albinus]]). When he heard the commotion from the Senate chamber, Antony fled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Huzar|first=Eleanor Goltz|title=Mark Antony, a biography By Eleanor Goltz Huzar|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|location=Minneapolis, MN|year=1978|pages=79–80|isbn=978-0-8166-0863-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Plutarch]], as Caesar arrived at the Senate, [[Tillius Cimber]] presented him with a petition to recall his exiled brother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/m_brutus.html |title=Plutarch – Life of Brutus |publisher=Classics.mit.edu |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other conspirators crowded round to offer support. Both Plutarch and Suetonius say that Caesar waved him away, but Cimber grabbed his shoulders and pulled down Caesar's [[tunic]]. Caesar then cried to Cimber, "Why, this is violence!" ("''Ista quidem vis est!''").&lt;ref name = "suetonius"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/suetonius-julius.html |title=Suetonius, 'Life of the Caesars, Julius', trans.

[[File:Karl Theodor von Piloty Murder of Caesar 1865.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.35|The [[Roman Senate|senators]] encircle Caesar, a 19th-century interpretation of the event by [[Carl Theodor von Piloty]]]]
At the same time, Casca produced his dagger and made a glancing thrust at the dictator's neck. Caesar turned around quickly and caught Casca by the arm. According to Plutarch, he said in Latin, "Casca, you villain, what are you doing?"&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Life of Caesar'', ch. 66: "{{lang|grc|ὁ μεν πληγείς, Ῥωμαιστί· 'Μιαρώτατε Κάσκα, τί ποιεῖς;}}'"&lt;/ref&gt; Casca, frightened, shouted, "Help, brother!" in [[Greek language|Greek]] ("{{lang|grc|ἀδελφέ, βοήθει}}", "''adelphe, boethei''"). Within moments, the entire group, including Brutus, was striking out at the dictator. Caesar attempted to get away, but, blinded by blood, he tripped and fell; the men continued stabbing him as he lay defenceless on the lower steps of the portico. According to [[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]], around 60 men participated in the assassination. He was stabbed 23 times.&lt;ref&gt;Woolf Greg (2006), ''Et Tu Brute? – The Murder of Caesar and Political Assassination'', 199 pages – {{ISBN|1-86197-741-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Suetonius, a physician later established that only one wound, the second one to his chest, had been lethal.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'', c. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;
The dictator's last words are not known with certainty, and are a contested subject among scholars and historians alike. Suetonius reports that others have said Caesar's last words were the Greek phrase "{{lang|grc|καὶ σύ, τέκνον;}}"&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#82.2 82.2]&lt;/ref&gt; (transliterated as "''Kai su, teknon?''": "You too, child?" in English). However, Suetonius' own opinion was that Caesar said nothing.&lt;ref&gt;From the [[John Carew Rolfe|J. C. Rolfe]] translation of 1914: "...he was stabbed with three and twenty wounds, uttering not a word, but merely a groan at the first stroke, though some have written that when [[Marcus Brutus]] rushed at him, he said in Greek, 'You too, my child?".&lt;/ref&gt;

Plutarch also reports that Caesar said nothing, pulling his toga over his head when he saw Brutus among the conspirators.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#66.9 66.9]&lt;/ref&gt; The version best known in the English-speaking world is the [[Latin language|Latin]] phrase "''[[Et tu, Brute?]]''" ("And you, Brutus?", commonly rendered as "You too, Brutus?");&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Stone|first=Jon R.|title=The Routledge Dictionary of Latin Quotations|publisher=Routledge|location=London|year=2005|page=250|isbn=0-415-96909-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Morwood|first=James|title=The Pocket Oxford Latin Dictionary (Latin-English)|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|year=1994|chapter=|isbn=0-19-860283-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; best known from Shakespeare's ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'', where it actually forms the first half of a [[macaronic]] line: "''Et tu, Brute?'' Then fall, Caesar." This version was already popular when the play was written, as it appears in [[Richard Edes]]'s Latin play ''Caesar Interfectus'' of 1582 and ''The True Tragedie of Richarde Duke of Yorke &amp; etc.'' of 1595, Shakespeare's source work for other plays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Works of William Shakespeare |last=Dyce |first=Alexander |authorlink= Alexander Dyce|quote=Quoting [[Edmond Malone|Malone]] |year= 1866|publisher=Chapman and Hall |location= London|isbn= |page= 648|url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Plutarch, after the assassination, Brutus stepped forward as if to say something to his fellow senators; they, however, fled the building.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#67 67]&lt;/ref&gt; Brutus and his companions then marched to the Capitol while crying out to their beloved city: "People of Rome, we are once again free!" They were met with silence, as the citizens of Rome had locked themselves inside their houses as soon as the rumour of what had taken place had begun to spread. Caesar's dead body lay where it fell on the Senate floor for nearly three hours before other officials arrived to remove it.

{{anchor|funeral}}
Caesar's body was cremated, and on the site of his cremation, the [[Temple of Caesar]] was erected a few years later (at the east side of the main square of the [[Roman Forum]]). Only its altar now remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anamericaninrome.com/wp/2011/07/caesars-grave/ |title=Temple of Caesar |publisher=Anamericaninrome.com |accessdate=8 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A life-size wax statue of Caesar was later erected in the forum displaying the 23 stab wounds. A crowd who had gathered there started a fire, which badly damaged the forum and neighbouring buildings. In the ensuing chaos, Mark Antony, Octavian (later Augustus Caesar), and others fought a series of five civil wars, which would end in the formation of the Roman Empire.

===Aftermath of the assassination===
The result unforeseen by the assassins was that Caesar's death precipitated the end of the Roman Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Florus, ''Epitome'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Florus/Epitome/2I*.html#XVII 2.7.1]&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman [[plebs|middle and lower classes]], with whom Caesar was immensely popular and had been since before Gaul, became enraged that a small group of aristocrats had killed their champion. Antony, who had been drifting apart from Caesar, capitalised on the grief of the Roman mob and threatened to unleash them on the ''[[Optimates]]'', perhaps with the intent of taking control of Rome himself. To his surprise and chagrin, Caesar had named his grandnephew [[Augustus|Gaius Octavius]] his sole heir (hence the name Octavian), bequeathing him the immensely potent Caesar name and making him one of the wealthiest citizens in the Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#83.2 83.2]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:M Antonius.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Mark Antony]]]]
The crowd at the funeral boiled over, throwing dry branches, furniture, and even clothing on to Caesar's funeral pyre, causing the flames to spin out of control, seriously damaging the Forum. The mob then attacked the houses of Brutus and Cassius, where they were repelled only with considerable difficulty, ultimately providing the spark for the [[Liberators' civil war|civil war]], fulfilling at least in part Antony's threat against the aristocrats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ancienthistory.about.com/library/bl/bl_text_suetcaesar.htm |title=Suetonius, Life of Caesar, Chapters LXXXIII, LXXXIV, LXXXV |publisher=Ancienthistory.about.com |date=29 October 2009 |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antony did not foresee the ultimate outcome of the next series of civil wars, particularly with regard to Caesar's adopted heir. Octavian, aged only 18 when Caesar died, proved to have considerable political skills, and while Antony dealt with [[Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus|Decimus Brutus]] in the first round of the new civil wars, Octavian consolidated his tenuous position.

To combat Brutus and Cassius, who were massing an enormous army in Greece, Antony needed soldiers, the cash from Caesar's war chests, and the legitimacy that Caesar's name would provide for any action he took against them. With the passage of the ''lex Titia'' on 27 November 43 BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Caesar's Legacy: Civil War and the Emergence of the Roman Empire | author=Osgood, Josiah | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year = 2006 | page = 60}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Second Triumvirate]] was officially formed, composed of Antony, Octavian, and Caesar's loyal cavalry commander [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Lepidus]].&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Augustus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#13.1 13.1]; Florus, ''Epitome'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Florus/Epitome/2I*.html#XVI 2.6]&lt;/ref&gt; It formally [[Apotheosis|deified]] Caesar as Divus Iulius in 42 BC, and Caesar Octavian henceforth became ''Divi filius'' ("Son of the divine").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Roman Religion | author=Warrior, Valerie M. | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year = 2006 | page = 110 | isbn = 0-521-82511-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Caesar's clemency had resulted in his murder, the Second Triumvirate reinstated the practice of [[proscription]], abandoned since Sulla.&lt;ref&gt;Florus, ''Epitome'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Florus/Epitome/2I*.html#XVI 2.6.3]&lt;/ref&gt; It engaged in the legally sanctioned killing of a large number of its opponents to secure funding for its 45 legions in the second civil war against Brutus and Cassius.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Ancient Rome: An Introductory History | author=Zoch, Paul A. | publisher=University of Oklahoma Press | year = 200 | pages = 217–218| isbn = 0-8061-3287-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antony and Octavian defeated them at [[Battle of Philippi|Philippi]].&lt;ref&gt;Florus, ''Epitome'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Florus/Epitome/2I*.html#XXXIIII 2.7.11–14]; Appian, ''The Civil Wars'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Appian/Civil_Wars/5*.html 5.3]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Augustus Statue.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus]], Caesar's adopted heir]]
Afterward, Mark Antony formed an alliance with Caesar's lover, Cleopatra, intending to use the fabulously wealthy Egypt as a base to dominate Rome. A third civil war broke out between Octavian on one hand and Antony and Cleopatra on the other. This final civil war, culminating in the latter's defeat at [[Battle of Actium|Actium]] in 31 BC and [[Death of Cleopatra|suicide in Egypt]] in 30 BC, resulted in the permanent ascendancy of Octavian, who became the first Roman emperor, under the name Caesar Augustus, a name conveying religious, rather than political, authority.&lt;ref&gt;Florus, ''Epitome'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Florus/Epitome/2I*.html#XXXIIII 2.34.66]&lt;/ref&gt;

Julius Caesar had been preparing to invade [[Parthia]], the [[Caucasus]], and [[Scythia]], and then march back to [[Germania]] through Eastern Europe. These plans were thwarted by his assassination.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#58 58.6]&lt;/ref&gt; His successors did attempt the conquests of Parthia and Germania, but without lasting results.

===Deification===
{{see also|Divus Julius|Caesar's Comet}}
Julius Caesar was the first historical Roman to be officially deified. He was posthumously granted the title ''Divus Iulius'' (the divine/deified Julius) by decree of the Roman Senate on 1 January 42 BC. The [[Caesar's Comet|appearance of a comet]] during [[Ludi|games in his honour]] was taken as confirmation of his divinity. Though his temple was not dedicated until after his death, he may have received divine honours during his lifetime:&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Philippic'' ii.110: Cicero refers to the divine honours of : "...couch, image, pediment, priest" given to Caesar in the months before his assassination.&lt;/ref&gt; and shortly before his assassination, Mark Antony had been appointed as his ''[[flamen]]'' (priest).&lt;ref&gt;According to Dio Cassius, 44.6.4.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Octavian and Mark Antony promoted the cult of'' Divus Iulius''. After the death of Antony, Octavian, as the adoptive son of Caesar, assumed the title of ''Divi Filius'' (son of a god).

Based on remarks by Plutarch,&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Caesar'' 17, 45, 60; see also Suetonius, ''Julius'' 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Caesar is sometimes thought to have suffered from [[epilepsy]]. Modern scholarship is sharply divided on the subject, and some scholars believe that he was plagued by malaria, particularly during the Sullan proscriptions of the 80s.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald T. Ridley, "The Dictator's Mistake: Caesar's Escape from Sulla," ''Historia'' 49 (2000), pp. 225–226, citing doubters of epilepsy: F. Kanngiesser, "Notes on the Pathology of the Julian Dynasty," ''Glasgow Medical Journal'' 77 (1912) 428–432; T. Cawthorne, "Julius Caesar and the Falling Sickness,” ''Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine'' 51 (1957) 27–30, who prefers [[Ménière's disease]]; and O. Temkin, ''The Falling Sickness: A History of Epilepsy from the Greeks to the Beginnings of Modern Neurology'' (Baltimore 1971), p 162.&lt;/ref&gt; Several specialists in headache medicine believe that instead of epilepsy, a more accurate diagnosis would be migraine headache.&lt;ref&gt;Seymour Diamond and Mary Franklin, ''Conquering Your Migraine: The Essential Guide to Understanding and Treating Migraines for all Sufferers and Their Families'', (New York: Fireside, 2001), 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars contend his epileptic seizures were due to a [[neurocysticercosis|parasitic infection in the brain]] by a tapeworm.&lt;ref name="bruschi"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bruschi|first=Fabrizio|title=Was Julius Caesar's epilepsy due to neurocysticercosis?|journal=Trends in Parasitology|volume=27|issue=9|pages=373–374|publisher=Cell Press|year=2011|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51493212_Was_Julius_Caesar's_epilepsy_due_to_neurocysticercosis?ev=prf_pub|accessdate=2 May 2013|doi=10.1016/j.pt.2011.06.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mclachlan"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McLachlan|first=Richard S.|title=Julius Caesar's Late Onset Epilepsy: A Case of Historic Proportions|journal=Canadian Journal of Neurological Sciences|volume=37|issue=5|pages=557–561|publisher=Canadian Journal of Neurological Sciences Inc.|year=2010|url=http://apps.webofknowledge.com/full_record.do?product=WOS&amp;search_mode=GeneralSearch&amp;qid=4&amp;SID=P2Ajl5d3oe6ha3MO8EF&amp;page=1&amp;doc=2|accessdate=11 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caesar had four documented episodes of what may have been complex partial seizures. He may additionally have had [[absence seizure]]s in his youth. The earliest accounts of these seizures were made by the biographer Suetonius, who was born after Caesar died. The claim of epilepsy is countered among some medical historians by a claim of [[hypoglycemia]], which can cause epileptoid seizures.&lt;ref name="Hughes2004Caesar"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Hughes J|title=Dictator Perpetuus: Julius Caesar—did he have seizures?

In 2003, psychiatrist Harbour F. Hodder published what he termed as the "Caesar Complex" theory, arguing that Caesar was a sufferer of [[temporal lobe epilepsy]] and the debilitating symptoms of the condition were a factor in Caesar's conscious decision to forgo personal safety in the days leading up to his assassination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hodder|first=Harbour Fraser|date=September 2003|title=Epilepsy and Empire, Caveat Caesar|journal=Accredited Psychiatry &amp; Medicine|publisher=Harvard University|location=Harvard, Boston|volume=106|issue=1|page=19|url=http://www.forensic-psych.com/articles/artHarvardMagCaesar.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A line from Shakespeare has sometimes been taken to mean that he was deaf in one ear: ''Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf''.&lt;ref&gt;William Shakespeare, ''Julius Caesar'' I.ii.209.&lt;/ref&gt; No classical source mentions hearing impairment in connection with Caesar. The playwright may have been making metaphorical use of a passage in Plutarch that does not refer to deafness at all, but rather to a gesture Alexander of Macedon customarily made. By covering his ear, Alexander indicated that he had turned his attention from an accusation in order to hear the defence.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Alexander'' 42; Jeremy Paterson discussing Caesar's health in general in "Caesar the Man," ''A Companion to Julius Caesar'' (Wiley-Blackwell, 2009), p. 130 [https://books.google.com/books?id=gzOXLGbIIYwC&amp;pg=PT150#v=onepage&amp;q=julius%20caesar%20deaf online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Francesco M. Galassi and Hutan Ashrafian suggest that Caesar's behavioral manifestations—headaches, vertigo, falls (possibly caused by muscle weakness due to nerve damage), sensory deficit, giddiness and insensibility—and syncopal episodes were the results of cerebrovascular episodes, not epilepsy. Pliny the Elder reports in his Natural History that Caesar's father and forefather died without apparent cause while putting on their shoes. These events can be more readily associated with cardiovascular complications from a stroke episode or lethal heart attack. Caesar possibly had a genetic predisposition for cardiovascular disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Galassi|first1=Francesco M.|last2=Ashrafian|first2=Hutan|title=Has the diagnosis of a stroke been overlooked in the symptoms of Julius Caesar?|journal=Neurological Sciences|date=29 March 2015|volume=36|issue=8|pages=1521–1522|doi=10.1007/s10072-015-2191-4|ref=Caesar Stroke}}&lt;!--|accessdate=9 April 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Suetonius]], writing more than a century after Caesar's death, describes Caesar as "tall of stature with a fair complexion, shapely limbs, a somewhat full face, and keen black eyes".&lt;ref&gt;[[Suetonius]], ''Life of Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#45 45]: ''excelsa statura, colore candido, teretibus membris, ore paulo pleniore, nigris vegetisque oculis.''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Name and family===
====The name Gaius Julius Caesar====
{{Main|Gaius Julius Caesar (name)}}
Using the [[Latin alphabet]] of the period, which lacked the letters ''J'' and ''U'', Caesar's name would be rendered ''GAIVS IVLIVS CAESAR''; the form ''CAIVS'' is also attested, using the older Roman representation of ''G'' by ''C''. The standard abbreviation was ''C.&amp;nbsp;IVLIVS CÆSAR'', reflecting the older spelling. (The letterform ''Æ'' is a [[ligature (typography)|ligature]] of the letters ''A'' and ''E'', and is often used in Latin [[inscription]]s to save space.)

In Classical Latin, it was [[Latin spelling and pronunciation|pronounced]] {{IPA-la|ˈɡaː.i.ʊs ˈjuːl.i.ʊs ˈkae̯sar}}. In the days of the late Roman Republic, many historical writings were done in Greek, a language most educated Romans studied. Young wealthy Roman boys were often taught by Greek slaves and sometimes sent to [[Athens]] for advanced training, as was Caesar's principal assassin, [[Marcus Junius Brutus|Brutus]]. In [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], during Caesar's time, his family name was written Καίσαρ (''Kaísar''), reflecting its contemporary pronunciation. Thus, his name is pronounced in a similar way to the pronunciation of the German ''[[Kaiser]]''.

In [[Vulgar Latin]], the original [[diphthong]] {{IPA|[ae̯]}} first began to be pronounced as a simple long vowel {{IPA|[ɛː]}}. Then, the [[Stop consonant|plosive]] {{IPA|/k/}} before [[front vowel]]s began, due to [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]], to be pronounced as an [[affricate]], hence renderings like {{IPA|[ˈtʃeːsar]}} in [[Italian language|Italian]] and {{IPA|[ˈtseːzar]}} in [[German language|German]] [[Latin regional pronunciation|regional pronunciations of Latin]], as well as the title of [[Tsar]]. With the evolution of the [[Romance languages]], the affricate {{IPA|[ts]}} became a [[Fricative consonant|fricative]] {{IPA|[s]}} (thus, {{IPA|[ˈseːsar]}}) in many regional pronunciations, including the French one, from which the modern English pronunciation is derived. The original {{IPA|/k/}} is preserved in [[Norse mythology]], where he is manifested as the legendary king [[Kjárr]].&lt;ref name="carlaz"&gt;Anderson, Carl Edlund. (1999). {{cite web |url= http://www.carlaz.com/phd/cea_phd_chap2.pdf |title= ''Formation and Resolution of Ideological Contrast in the Early History of Scandinavia'' |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070307030753/http://www.carlaz.com/phd/cea_phd_chap2.pdf |archivedate= 7 March 2007 |df= dmy-all }}. PhD thesis, University of Cambridge, Department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse &amp; Celtic, p. 44.&amp;nbsp;{{small|(308&amp;nbsp;KB)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caesar's [[cognomen]] itself became a title; it was promulgated by the [[Bible]], which contains the famous verse "[[Render unto Caesar]] the things which are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's". The title became ''[[Kaiser]]'' in [[German language|German]] and [[Tsar]] or Czar in the [[Slavic languages]]. The last Tsar in nominal power was [[Simeon&amp;nbsp;II of Bulgaria]], whose reign ended in 1946. This means that for two thousand years after Julius Caesar's assassination, there was at least one head of state bearing his name.

;Children
* [[Julia (daughter of Julius Caesar)|Julia]], by Cornelia, born in 83 or 82 BC
* [[Caesarion]], by [[Cleopatra VII]], born 47 BC, and killed at age 17 by Caesar's adopted son Octavianus.
* ''Posthumously adopted'': [[Augustus|Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus]], his great-nephew by blood (grandson of [[Julia Minor (sister of Caesar)|Julia, his sister]]), who later became Emperor Augustus.

Suspected Children
* [[Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger|Marcus Junius Brutus]] (born 85 BC): The historian [[Plutarch]] notes that Caesar believed Brutus to have been his illegitimate son, as his mother [[Servilia (mother of Marcus Junius Brutus)|Servilia]] had been Caesar's lover during their youth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Brutus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Brutus*.html#5 5]&lt;/ref&gt; Caesar would have been 15 years old when Brutus was born.
* [[Junia Tertia]] (born ''ca.'' 60s BC), the daughter of Caesar's lover [[Servilia (mother of Marcus Junius Brutus)|Servilia]] was believed by [[Cicero]] among other contemporaries, to be Caesar's natural daughter.
* [[Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus]] (born ''ca.'' 85–81 BC): On several occasions Caesar expressed how he loved Decimus Brutus like a son. This Brutus was also named an heir of Caesar in case Octavius had died before the latter. [[Ronald Syme]] argued that if a Brutus was the natural son of Caesar, Decimus was more likely than [[Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger|Marcus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald Syme]], "Bastards in the Roman Aristocracy," pp. 323–327. Thomas Africa thought Syme had recanted this view; see "The Mask of an Assassin: A Psychohistorical Study of [[Marcus Junius Brutus|M. Junius Brutus]]," ''Journal of Interdisciplinary History'' 8 (1978), p. 615, note 28, referring to Syme's book ''Sallust'' (Berkeley, 1964), p. 134. This would appear to be a misreading, given Syme's fuller argument twenty years later in "No Son for Caesar?" ''Historia'' 29 (1980) 422–437, pp. 426–430 regarding the greater likelihood that Decimus would be the Brutus who was Caesar's son.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Grandchildren
* Grandson from [[Julia (daughter of Julius Caesar)|Julia]] and [[Pompey]], dead at several days, unnamed.

;Lovers
* [[Cleopatra|Cleopatra VII]], mother of [[Caesarion]]
* [[Servilia (mother of Marcus Junius Brutus)|Servilia]], mother of Brutus
* [[Eunoe (wife of Bogudes)|Eunoë]], queen of [[Mauretania]] and wife of [[Bogud]]es

;Notable relatives
* [[Gaius Marius]] (married to his paternal aunt [[Julia (wife of Marius)|Julia]])
* [[Mark Antony]] (his relative through Antony's mother [[Julia Antonia|Julia]])
* [[Lucius Julius Caesar (consul 64 BC)|Lucius Julius Caesar]] (his third-cousin)
* [[Julius Sabinus]], a [[Gaul]] of the [[Lingones]] at the time of the [[Batavian rebellion]] of AD 69, claimed to be the great-grandson of Caesar on the grounds that his great-grandmother had been Caesar's lover during the [[Gallic Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Tacitus]], ''[[Histories (Tacitus)|Histories]]'' [[s:The Histories (Tacitus)/Book 4#55|4.55]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rumors of homosexuality===
Roman society viewed the passive role during [[Sexuality in ancient Rome|sexual activity]], regardless of gender, to be a sign of submission or inferiority. Indeed, Suetonius says that in Caesar's Gallic triumph, his soldiers sang that, "Caesar may have conquered the Gauls, but Nicomedes conquered Caesar."&lt;ref name="Suet.1.49"&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#49 49]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cicero, [[Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus|Bibulus]], [[Gaius Memmius (poet)|Gaius Memmius]], and others (mainly Caesar's enemies), he had an affair with [[Nicomedes IV of Bithynia]] early in his career. The tales were repeated, referring to Caesar as the Queen of Bithynia, by some Roman politicians as a way to humiliate him. Caesar himself denied the accusations repeatedly throughout his lifetime, and according to [[Cassius Dio]], even under oath on one occasion.&lt;ref name="Suet.1.2"&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#49 49]; Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/43*.html#20 43.20]&lt;/ref&gt; This form of slander was popular during this time in the Roman Republic to demean and discredit political opponents. A favorite tactic used by the opposition was to accuse a popular political rival as living a Hellenistic lifestyle based on Greek and Eastern culture, where homosexuality and a lavish lifestyle were more acceptable than in Roman tradition.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

[[Catullus]] wrote two poems suggesting that Caesar and his engineer [[Mamurra]] were lovers,&lt;ref&gt;[[Catullus]], ''Carmina'' [http://www.vroma.org/~hwalker/VRomaCatullus/029x.html 29], [http://www.vroma.org/~hwalker/VRomaCatullus/057x.html 57]&lt;/ref&gt; but later apologised.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#73 73]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mark Antony]] charged that Octavian had earned his adoption by Caesar through sexual favors. Suetonius described Antony's accusation of an affair with Octavian as political [[slander]]. Octavian eventually became the first Roman Emperor as Augustus.&lt;ref name="Suet.2.68"&gt;Suetonius, ''Augustus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#68 68], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#71 71]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary works==
[[File:Julii Caesaris quae exstant.tif|thumb|''Julii Caesaris quae exstant'' (1678)]]
During his lifetime, Caesar was regarded as one of the best orators and prose authors in Latin—even Cicero spoke highly of Caesar's rhetoric and style.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Brutus'', 252.&lt;/ref&gt; Only Caesar's war commentaries have survived. A few sentences from other works are quoted by other authors. Among his lost works are [[Laudatio Iuliae amitae|his funeral oration]] for his paternal aunt [[Julia (aunt of Caesar and wife of Marius)|Julia]] and his ''[[Anticato]]'', a document written to defame [[Cato the Younger|Cato]] in response to Cicero's published praise. [[Poems by Julius Caesar]] are also mentioned in ancient sources.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Courtney, ''The Fragmentary Latin Poets'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1993), pp. 153–155 and 187–188.

* The ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]'', usually known in English as ''The Gallic Wars,'' seven books each covering one year of his campaigns in Gaul and southern Britain in the 50s BC, with the eighth book written by [[Aulus Hirtius]] on the last two years.
* The ''[[Commentarii de Bello Civili]]'' (''The Civil War''), events of the Civil War from Caesar's perspective, until immediately after Pompey's death in Egypt.

Other works historically have been attributed to Caesar, but their authorship is in doubt:
* ''[[De Bello Alexandrino]]'' (''On the Alexandrine War''), campaign in Alexandria;
* ''[[De Bello Africo]]'' (''On the African War''), campaigns in North Africa; and
* ''[[De Bello Hispaniensi]]'' (''On the Hispanic War''), campaigns in the [[Iberian Peninsula]].

These narratives were written and published annually during or just after the actual campaigns, as a sort of "dispatches from the front." They were important in shaping Caesar's public image and enhancing his reputation when he was away from Rome for long periods. They may have been presented as public readings.&lt;ref&gt;T.P. Wiseman, “The Publication of ''De Bello Gallico'',” ''Julius Caesar as Artful Reporter'' (Classical Press of Wales, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; As a model of clear and direct Latin style, ''The Gallic Wars'' traditionally has been studied by first- or second-year Latin students.

==Legacy==

===Historiography===
The texts written by Caesar, an autobiography of the most important events of his public life, are the most complete [[primary source]] for the reconstruction of his biography. However, Caesar wrote those texts with his political career in mind, so historians must filter the exaggerations and bias contained in it.&lt;ref&gt;Canfora, p. 10-11&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman emperor [[Augustus]] began a [[cult of personality]] of Caesar, which described Augustus as Caesar's political heir. The modern historiography is influenced by the Octavian traditions, such as when Caesar's epoch is considered a turning point in the history of the Roman Empire. Still, historians try to filter the Octavian bias.&lt;ref&gt;Canfora, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Many rulers in history became interested in the [[Roman historiography|historiography of Caesar]]. [[Napoleon III]] wrote the scholarly work ''[[Histoire de Jules César]]'', which was not finished. The second volume listed previous rulers interested in the topic. [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]] ordered a monk to prepare a translation of the ''Gallic Wars'' in 1480. [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] ordered a topographic study in France, to place in Gallic Wars in context; which created forty high-quality maps of the conflict. The contemporary Ottoman sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] catalogued the surviving editions of the ''Commentaries'', and translated them to Turkish language. [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] and [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]] of France translated the first two commentaries and the last two respectively; [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] retranslated the first one afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;Canfora, pp. 11-12&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics===
{{Main|Caesarism}}
Julius Caesar is seen as the main example of ''[[Caesarism]]'', a form of political rule led by a [[charisma]]tic [[Strongman (politics)|strongman]] whose rule is based upon a [[cult of personality]], whose rationale is the need to rule by force, establishing a violent [[social order]], and being a regime involving prominence of the [[military]] in the government.&lt;ref name="Weber, 34" &gt;{{Cite book|title=Caesarism, Charisma, and Fate: Historical Sources and Modern Resonances in the Work of Max Weber|publisher=Transaction Publishers|year=2008|ref={{harvid|Weber}}|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other people in history, such as the French [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] and the Italian [[Benito Mussolini]], have defined themselves as Caesarists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Napoleon Bonaparte, Political Prodigy |first=Howard G. |last=Brown |date=29 June 2007 |doi=10.1111/j.1478-0542.2007.00451.x |publisher=[[Wiley (publisher)|Wiley]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=James |last=Hartfield |title=Unpatriotic History of the Second World War |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=gALtBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA77 |publisher=John Hunt Publishing |date=28 September 2012 |page=77 |isbn=9781780993799}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bonaparte did not focus only on Caesar's military career but also on his relation with the masses, a predecessor to [[populism]].&lt;ref&gt;Canfora, pp. 12-13&lt;/ref&gt; The word is also used in a pejorative manner by critics of this type of political rule.

'''Kaarlo (Kalle) Alvar Päätalo''' (11 November 1919 &amp;ndash; 20 November 2000) was a Finnish [[novelist]], the most popular Finnish writer in the 20th century. His ''Iijoki'' series, comprising 26 novels, is one of the longest autobiographical works ever written.&lt;ref&gt;Miehenkuva, Jenni Janatuinen 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Kallioniemi.jpg|right|275px|thumb|The house on Kallioniemi was the childhood home of Kalle Päätalo. It was built by his father.]]
==Biography==
Päätalo was born in [[Taivalkoski]], [[Oulu (province)|Province of Oulu]], into poor circumstances. His father, a lumberjack, suffered from periodical mental disorders, and Kalle had to maintain his family from the age of 14 in his father's profession. At the same time, he dreamed about becoming a writer and read avidly, being much influenced by [[Jack London]]'s ''Martin Eden'' and [[Mika Waltari]]'s guidebook for aspiring writers. His war service in [[Winter War]] and [[Continuation War]] was cut short by being wounded. After the wars, he moved to [[Tampere]] where he studied at technical school, becoming a building contractor, and wrote short stories that were published in various magazines. He was married twice and had two daughters by the second marriage.

Päätalo debuted as a novelist in 1958 with a novel set at a building site in Tampere. In his second novel ''Our Daily Bread'', the first book in the five-volume ''Koillismaa'' series, he turned to his native region. By this time, Päätalo was able to turn a freelance writer, and from 1962 until his death he published one book each year. In 1971 he published what was to be the first volume in the 26-volume series ''Juuret Iijoen törmässä'' ('Roots in the Bank of River Ii'), probably the longest autobiographical narrative in the world (some 17 000 pages in total). The series charts Päätalo's life from his early childhood to the publication of his first novel, at the same time offering an interesting view of Finnish history over some four decades as seen from an individual's viewpoint.

Though Päätalo's first books got favourable reviews, the prevailing critical attitude to his writing soon turned negative while his popularity remained steady. Some found the slowness of his narration and its seeming sticking to trifles tedious, while his innumerable fans, mostly among his own generation, were fascinated by the very abundance of detail, a meticulous reconstruction of the past. Other strengths of Päätalo's style are his absolute sincerity to the reader - he seemed to leave nothing of his life untold, yet his writing is never merely sensational - and his skillful way with spoken [[Finnish language|Finnish]], especially his native dialect. Recently, many critics have begun to see his works in a new light and they have also attracted the attention of younger readers. As a recognition for his career, Päätalo received the Pro Finlandia medal and Professor's title in 1978 and an honorary doctorate at the [[University of Oulu]] in 1994.

Known as "the king of reprints" because of the phenomenal success of his books, Päätalo published 39 novels, two collections of short stories and one play in his lifetime, with more short stories having been published posthumously. Four of his books have been filmed, and all five volumes of the ''Koillismaa'' series have been translated into English by [[Richard Impola]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/paatalo.htm |title=Kalle Päätalo |website=Books and Writers ''(kirjasto.sci.fi)'' |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012220757/http://kirjasto.sci.fi/paatalo.htm |archivedate=12 October 2007 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo3|"kana usage/use"|仮名遣|'''Kanazukai'''}} are the [[orthography|orthographic]] rules for spelling [[Japanese language|Japanese]] in [[kana]]. All [[phonographic]] systems (of which kana is an example) attempt to account accurately the [[pronunciation]] in their [[spelling]]s. However, pronunciation and accents change over time and [[phonemic]] distinctions are often lost. Various systems of ''kanazukai'' were introduced to deal with the disparity between the [[Written language|written]] and [[spoken language|spoken]] versions of Japanese.

==Historical systems==
The former mainstream kana usage, or the ''[[Kyū-Kanazukai]]'' ({{lang|ja|旧仮名遣}}, "old ''kanazukai''"), is based on classical texts, especially [[man'yōgana]]. Created by [[Keichū]] in the early [[Edo period]], it is also known as the Keichū Kanazukai. It was the mainstream kanazukai until the ''[[Gendai Kanazukai]]'' was introduced in 1946.

There were other minor systems throughout history that are now defunct:
* ''[[Jōdai Tokushu Kanazukai]]'': a modified [[Man'yōgana]] where /e, je/ are distinct.
* ''Teika Kanazukai'': created by [[Fujiwara no Teika]], it distinguishes between /wo, o/, /i, hi, wi/, /e, we, he/, and also (to a lesser degree) /e, je/. /wo, o/ were used to express high and low accent, respectively.
* ''Gyōa Kanazukai'' (''Kanamojizukai''): created by [[Minamoto no Chikayuki]] and [[Gyōa]], which expanded on the Teika Kanazukai by distinguishing between /ho/, /wa, ha/, /u, hu/, and /mu/. /wo, o/ are still used to distinguish between high and low accent. However, the distinction between /e, je/ is obliterated.

==Gendai Kanazukai==
{{Main|Gendai Kanazukai}}
Derived from the Kyū-Kanazukai, it is a revision to better approximate modern pronunciation that is still used currently. As an adaption of the Kyū-Kanazukai, it is still not entirely phonetic, especially in respect to long vowels and [[Grammatical particle|particle]]s.

'''Khamnigan''' is a [[Mongolic language]] spoken east of [[Lake Baikal]].

The Khamnigan people, called the ''Horse [[Tungusic peoples|Tungus]]'' or ''Steppe Tungus'', are natively bilingual, speaking both a Mongolic and a [[Tungusic languages|Tungusic]] language, which are inherited from their mixed ancestry. This bilingualism appears to be several centuries old. Their Tungusic language is [[Evenki language|Evenki]] (''Khamnigan'' is the Mongol name for the Evenki), while Khamnigan Mongol is a distinct Mongolic language, not a dialect of Mongol or Buryat as traditionally classified in Mongolia or Russia. Mongol is the dominant language; the two dialects of Evenki are only used by part of the population, and then at home. 

The language has declined in Russia, with few speakers left, but both Khamnigan Mongol and Evenki bilingualism remain vigorous in China. Khamnigan Evenki, though not a distinct language from other Evenki, is heavily influenced by Mongol, especially in vocabulary. Khamnigan Mongol, on the other hand, is the most conservative Mongolic language, little different from [[Middle Mongolian]], though the system of [[vowel harmony]] has been disrupted. There is little influence from Evenki: although Khamnigan Evenki has a grammatical plural, for example, Khamnigan Mongol does not.&lt;ref&gt;[[Juha Janhunen]]. 2003. "Khamnigan Mongol". In ''The Mongolic Languages''&lt;/ref&gt;

Khamnigan in Mongolia has strongly assimilated to Khalkha Mongolian, and even though some Buryat-like and idiosynchratic features are to be found (e.g. the very particular mood system lacking in Khamnigan in China), it overall resembles a dialect of Khalkha, and it has lost its particular Tungusic lexicon.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Yu, Wonsoo. 2011. A Study of the Mongol Khamnigan spoken in Northeastern Mongolia. Seoul: Seoul National University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Konyak languages''', or '''Northern Naga''', are a small family of half a dozen [[Sino-Tibetan languages]] spoken by the [[Naga people]] in southeastern [[Arunachal Pradesh]] and northeastern [[Nagaland]] states of northeastern India. They are not particularly closely related to other Naga languages. The best known Konyak languages are [[Konyak language|Konyak]] and [[Nocte language|Nocte]].

There are a large number of divergent dialects, and villages even a few kilometers apart frequently have to rely on a separate common language.

Proto-Northern Naga, the reconstructed [[proto-language]] of the Konyak languages, has been reconstructed by Walter French (1983).

''Ethnologue'' 17 adds [[Makyam language|Makyam]] (Paungnyuan), while ''Glottolog'' adds a ''Khiamniungic'' branch within the Konyak-Chang branch. Makyam is most closely related to [[Htangan language|Leinong]] (Htangan) (Naw Sawu 2016:6).

'''Kosher wine''' ({{Hebrew Name 1|יין כשר|yayin kashér}}) is [[wine|grape wine]] produced according to [[Judaism]]'s [[Halakha|religious law]], specifically, [[Kashrut|Jewish dietary laws]] (''kashrut'').

To be considered kosher, Sabbath-observant Jews must supervise and sometimes handle the entire [[winemaking]] process, from the time the grapes are crushed until the wine is bottled and any ingredients used, including [[finings]], must be kosher.&lt;ref name="goldberg"&gt;T. Goldberg ''"[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4580443/ Picking the perfect Passover wine]"'' MSNBC, April 19th, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Wine that is described as "[[kosher for Passover]]" must have been kept free from contact with [[chametz]], examples being [[grain]], [[bread]] and [[dough]].&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 383"/&gt;

When kosher wine is produced, marketed and sold commercially, it would normally have a ''[[hechsher]]'' ("seal of approval") of a [[kosher certification agency]], or of an authoritative rabbi who is preferably also a ''[[posek]]'' ("decisor" of Jewish law), or be supervised by a ''[[beth din]]'' ("Jewish religious court of law").

In recent times, there has been an increased demand for kosher wines and a number of wine producing countries now produce a wide variety of sophisticated kosher wines under strict [[rabbi]]nical supervision, particularly in [[Israel (wine)|Israel]], the [[United States (wine)|United States]], [[France (wine)|France]], [[Germany (wine)|Germany]], [[Italy (wine)|Italy]], [[South Africa (wine)|South Africa]], [[Chilean wine|Chile]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chile produces kosher wine|url=http://www.winespectator.com/webfeature/show/id/Chile-Produces-Kosher-Wine_20233|website=Wine Spectator|accessdate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Australia (wine)|Australia]]. Two of the world's largest producers and importers of kosher wines, [[Royal Wine Company|Kedem]] and [[Manischewitz]], are both based in the [[Northeastern United States]].

==History==
{{See also|Alcohol in the Bible}}
[[File:MigdalHaemek5.jpg|right|thumb|Ancient Israelite wine press at [[Migdal HaEmek]].]]
The use of wine has a long history in Judaism, dating back to [[Alcohol in the Bible|biblical times]]. [[Archeological]] evidence shows that wine was produced throughout ancient Israel. The traditional and religious use of wine continued within the [[Jewish diaspora]] community. In the [[United States]], kosher wines came to be associated with [[sweet (wine)|sweet]] [[Concord (grape)|Concord]] wines produced by wineries founded by Jewish immigrants to [[New York (wine)|New York]]. 

Beginning in the 1980s, a trend towards producing dry, premium-quality kosher wines began with the revival of the [[Israeli wine]] industry. Today kosher wine is produced not only in Israel but throughout the world, including premium wine areas like [[Napa Valley (wine)|Napa Valley]] and the [[St-Emilion (wine)|St-Emilion]] region of [[Bordeaux (wine)|Bordeaux]].&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 383"&gt;J. Robinson (ed) ''"The Oxford Companion to Wine"'' Third Edition  pg 383 Oxford University Press 2006 {{ISBN|0-19-860990-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of wine in Jewish holidays and rituals==
{{rquote|right|It has been one of history's cruel ironies that the [Christian medieval] [[blood libel]]---accusations against Jews using the blood of murdered non-Jewish children for the making of wine and matzot---became the false pretext for numerous [[pogrom]]s. And due to the danger, those who live in a place where blood libels occur are [[Halacha|halachically]] exempted from using [kosher] red wine, lest it be seized as "evidence" against them.|Pesach: What We Eat and Why We Eat It|Project Genesis&lt;ref name=reWineBloodlibel&gt;{{cite web|last=Rutman |first=Rabbi Yisrael |title=Pesach: What We Eat and Why We Eat It |url=http://www.torah.org/features/holydays/passover/pesacheat.html |publisher=Project Genesis Inc. |accessdate=14 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509103442/http://torah.org/features/holydays/passover/pesacheat.html |archivedate= 9 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Almost all [[Jewish holiday]]s, especially the [[Passover Seder]] where all present drink four cups of wine, on [[Purim]] for the festive meal, and on the [[Shabbat]] require obligatory blessings ([[Kiddush]]) over filled cups of kosher wine that are then drunk. [[Grape juice]] is also suitable on these occasions. If no wine or grape juice is present on Shabbat, the blessing over [[challah]] suffices. At [[Jewish view of marriage|Jewish marriages]], [[Brit milah|circumcisions]], and at [[Redemption of First-born]] ceremonies, the obligatory blessing of ''Borei Pri HaGafen'' ("Blessed are you O Lord, Who created the fruit of the vine") is almost always recited over kosher wine (or grape [[juice]]).

According to the teachings of the [[Midrash]], the forbidden fruit that [[Eve]] ate and which she gave to [[Adam]] was the [[grape]] from which wine is derived, though others contest this and say that it was in fact a [[ficus|fig]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Rashi]] On Genesis 3:7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Nehemiah in the [[Babylonian Talmud]] Tractate Berachot 40a and Sanhedrin 70b&lt;/ref&gt; The capacity of wine to cause [[drunkenness]] with its consequent loosening of inhibitions is described by the ancient rabbis in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] as ''nichnas yayin, yatza sod'' ("wine enters, [and one's personal] secret[s] exit"), similar to the Latin "[[in vino veritas]]". Another similarly evocative expression relating to wine is: ''Ein Simcha Ela BeBasar Veyayin''—"There is no joy except through [eating] meat and [drinking] wine".)

==Requirements for being kosher==
{{See|Kosher foods#Wine}}

Because of wine's special role in many non-Jewish [[religions]], the ''kashrut'' laws specify that wine cannot be considered kosher if it might have been used for [[idolatry]]. These laws include ''Yayin Nesekh'' ({{lang|he|יין נסך}}), wine that has been poured to an idol, and ''Stam Yainom'', wine that has been touched by someone who believes in idolatry or produced by non-Jews. When kosher wine is ''yayin mevushal'' ({{lang|he|יין מבושל}} – "cooked" or "boiled"), it becomes unfit for idolatrous use and will keep the status of ''kosher'' wine even if subsequently touched by an idolater. 

While none of the ingredients that make up wine (alcohol, [[sugars (wine)|sugars]], [[acidity (wine)|acidity]] and [[phenols (wine)|phenols]]) is considered non-kosher, the ''kashrut'' laws involving wine are concerned more with who handles the wine and what they use to make it.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 383"/&gt; For wine to be considered kosher, only Sabbath-observant Jews may handle it, from the first time in the process when a liquid portion is separated from solid waste, until the wine is pasteurized or bottles are sealed.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} 

Wine that is described as "[[kosher for Passover]]" must have been kept free from contact with [[chametz]] and kitnios. This would include [[grain]], [[bread]], and [[dough]] as well as legumes and corn derivatives.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 383"/&gt;

===Mevushal wines===
As mentioned above, when kosher wine is ''mevushal'' ("cooked" or "boiled"), it thereby becomes unfit for idolatrous use and will keep the status of kosher wine even if subsequently touched by an idolater. It is not known whence the ancient Jewish authorities derived this claim; there are no records concerning "boiled wine" and its fitness for use in the cults of any of the religions of the peoples surrounding ancient Israel. Indeed, in [[Orthodox Christianity]], it is common to add boiling water to the [[sacramental wine]]. Another opinion holds that mevushal wine was not included in the rabbinic edict against drinking wine touched by an idolater simply because such wine was uncommon in those times.

Mevushal wine is frequently used in kosher restaurants and by kosher caterers so as to allow the wine to be handled by non-Jewish or non-observant waiters. 

The process of fully boiling a wine kills off most of the fine mold on the grapes, and greatly alters the [[tannin (wine)|tannin]]s and flavors of the wine. Therefore, great care is taken to satisfy the legal requirements while exposing the wine to as little heat as necessary. There is significant disagreement between halachic deciders as to the precise temperature a wine must reach to be considered mevushal, ranging from 165°F (74°C) to 194°F (90°C). (At this temperature, the wine is not at a rolling boil, but it is cooking, in the sense that it will evaporate much more quickly than usual.) Cooking at the minimum required temperature reduces some of the damage done to the wine, but still has a substantial effect on quality and [[aging potential (wine)|aging potential]].&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 383"/&gt;

Recently, a process called [[flash pasteurization]] has come into vogue. This method rapidly heats the wine to the desired temperature and immediately chills it back to room temperature. This process is said to have a minimal effect on flavor, at least to the casual wine drinker. 

Irrespective of the method, the pasteurization process must be overseen by ''[[Mashgiach|mashgichim]]'' to ensure the kosher status of the wine. Generally, they will attend the winery to physically tip the fruit into the crush, and operate the pasteurization equipment. Once the wine emerges from the process, it can be handled and aged in the normal fashion.

===According to Conservative Judaism===
In the 1960s, the [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards]] approved a ''[[responsum]]'' ("legal ruling") by Rabbi Israel Silverman on this subject. Silverman noted that some classical Jewish authorities believed that [[Christian]]s are not considered idolaters, and that their products cannot be considered forbidden in this regard. He also noted that most winemaking in the United States is fully automated. Based on 15th–19th century precedents in the ''[[responsa]]'' literature, he concluded that wines manufactured by this automated process may not be classified as wine "manufactured by [[gentile]]s", and thus are not prohibited by Jewish law. This ''responsum'' makes no attempt to change ''halakhah'' in any way, but rather argues that most American wine, made in an automated fashion, is already kosher by traditional halakhic standards. Some criticism was later made against this ''[[teshuvah]]'', because (a) some wines are not made by automated processes but rather, at least in some steps, by hand, and (b) on rare occasions non-kosher fining ingredients are used in wine preparation.  Silverman later retracted his position.

A later ''responsum'' on this subject was written by Rabbi [[Elliot N. Dorff]], and also accepted by the CJLS.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/sites/default/files/assets/public/halakhah/teshuvot/19861990/dorff_wines.pdf Elliot Dorff, "On the Use of All Wines" YD 123:1.1985] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091222083350/http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/teshuvot/docs/19861990/dorff_wines.pdf |date=2009-12-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dorff noted that not all wines are made by automated processes, and thus the reasoning behind Silverman's responsum was not conclusively reliable in all cases. On the other hand, Dorff points out that even if we can avoid the issue of "wine handled by a gentile", there is a separate prohibition against wine produced from wineries owned by a gentile, in which case automation is irrelevant, and all non-certified wines are prohibited. Therefore, he explored the possibility to change the halacha, arguing that the prohibition no longer applies. He cites rabbinic thought on Jewish views of Christians, also finding that most ''[[Posek|poskim]]'' refused to consign Christians to the status of idolater. Dorff then critiqued the traditional halakhic argument that avoiding such wine would prevent [[interfaith marriage|intermarriage]]. Dorff asserted, however, that those who were strict about the laws of ''kashrut'' were not likely to intermarry, and those that did not follow the laws would not care if a wine has a ''[[heksher]]'' or not. He also noted that a number of non-kosher ingredients may be used in the manufacturing process, including animal blood.

Dorff concluded a number of points including that there is no reason to believe that the production of such wines is conducted as part of [[Paganism|pagan]] (or indeed, ''any'') religious practice. Most wines have absolutely no non-kosher ingredients whatsoever. Some wines use a non-kosher ingredient as part of a fining process, but not as an ingredient in the wine as such. Dorff noted that material from this matter is not intended to infiltrate the wine product. The inclusion of any non-kosher ingredient within the wine occurs by accident, and in such minute quantities that the ingredient is nullified. All wines made in the USA and Canada may be considered kosher, regardless of whether or not their production is subject to rabbinical supervision. Many foods once considered forbidden if produced by non-Jews (such as [[wheat]] and oil products) were eventually declared kosher. Based on the above points, Dorff's responsum extends this same ruling to wine and other grape-products.

However, this teshuvah also notes that this is a lenient view. Some Conservative rabbis disagree with it, e.g. [[Isaac Klein]].  As such Dorff's teshuvah states that synagogues should hold themselves to a stricter standard so that all in the Jewish community will view the synagogue's kitchen as fully kosher.  As such, Conservative synagogues are encouraged to use only wines with a heksher, and preferably wines from Israel.

==Regional Kosher Wine Consumption==

===United States===
The United States of America contains roughly 40% of the Jewish population of the world, and most US wine stores, particularly in the northeast, have a small kosher section.

Historically, kosher wine has been associated in the US with the [[Manischewitz]] brand, which produce a sweetened wine with a distinctive taste, made of [[labrusca]] rather than vinifera grapes.  Due to the addition of [[high-fructose corn syrup]], the normal bottlings of Manischewitz are, for Ashkenazi Jews, not kosher during Passover by the rule of ''[[kitniyot]]'', and a special bottling is made available.  This cultural preference for a distinct, unique variety of wine dates back to Jewish settlements in early US history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/life/archive/2011/04/the-11th-plague-why-people-drink-sweet-wine-on-passover/73193/|title=The 11th Plague? Why People Drink Sweet Wine on Passover|author=Yoni Appelbaum|date=April 14, 2011|accessdate=April 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, there are thousands of kosher wines available in every conceivable style from virtually all of the world's wine-producing regions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1468">'''Mikael Söderberg''' (8 December 1903 – 13 January 1931) was a Swedish writer.

==Personal life==
Mikael Söderberg (b. 1903) was the youngest of the children of [[Sweden|Swedish]] writer [[Hjalmar Söderberg]] (b 1989, d. 1941) and Märta Abenius (b. 1871, d. 1932). He had two older full siblings, actress [[Dora Söderberg|Dora Söderberg-Carlsten]] (b. 1899) and Tom Söderberg (b. 1900). He married Swedish-American journalist and writer [[Eugénie Söderberg|Eugénie Riwkin Söderberg]] in 1928.

==Writing==
Works include: 
* ''Den främmande staden – berättelser'', Åhlén &amp; Åkerlund: [Bonnier], Stockholm 1928.
* ''Drömmar och dagdrömmar'', Bonniers, Stockholm 1931.

==Death==
Söderberg decided to take his own life in 1931 using a pistol. He left a few hand-written notes:
* ''Suicide. No one are to blame in any way. Only I cary the responsibility for my misspent life.''
His age of death was 27 years old.&lt;ref&gt;Mikael Söderberg, samlade skrifter. Söderbergssällskapet 2008. {{ISBN|978-91-977970-1-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''MoSCoW method''' is a prioritization technique used in management, [[business analysis]], [[project management]], and [[software development]] to reach a common understanding with [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]] on the importance they place on the delivery of each [[Requirements analysis|requirement]]; it is also known as ''MoSCoW prioritization'' or ''MoSCoW analysis''.

The term ''MoSCoW'' itself is an [[acronym]] derived from the first letter of each of four prioritization categories (''Must have'', ''Should have'', ''Could have'', and ''Won't have''), with the interstitial ''O''s added to make the word pronounceable. While the ''O''s are usually in lower-case to indicate that they do not stand for anything, the all-capitals ''MOSCOW'' is also used.

== Background ==

This prioritisation method was developed by Dai Clegg&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 |last = Clegg
 |first = Dai
 |author2=Barker, Richard
 |title = Case Method Fast-Track: A RAD Approach
 |date = 1994
 |publisher = Addison-Wesley
 |isbn = 978-0-201-62432-8
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and first used extensively with the [[Agile software development|agile]] project delivery framework [[Dynamic Systems Development Method]] (DSDM).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 |last = Bittner
 |first = Kurt
 |author2=Spence, Ian
 |title = Use Case Modeling
 |date = 2002-08-30
 |publisher = Addison-Wesley Professional
 |isbn = 978-0-201-70913-1
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MoSCoW is often used with [[timeboxing]], where a deadline is fixed so that the focus must be on the most important requirements, and as such is a technique commonly used in [[agile software development]] approaches such as [[Scrum (software development)|Scrum]], [[rapid application development]] (RAD), and DSDM.

== Prioritization of MoSCoW requirements ==

All requirements are important, but they are prioritized to deliver the greatest and most immediate business benefits early. Developers will initially try to deliver all the ''Must have'', ''Should have'' and ''Could have'' requirements but the ''Should'' and ''Could'' requirements will be the first to be removed if the delivery timescale looks threatened.

The plain English meaning of the prioritization categories has value in getting customers to better understand the impact of setting a priority, compared to alternatives like ''High'', ''Medium'' and ''Low''.

The categories are typically understood as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 |title = A Guide to the Business Analysis Body of Knowledge|year = 2009|publisher = International Institute of Business Analysis|isbn = 978-0-9811292-1-1|edition = 2|chapter = MoSCoW Analysis (6.1.5.2)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; {{anchor|MUST}}{{anchor|must}} Must have
: Requirements labeled as ''Must have'' are critical to the current delivery timebox in order for it to be a success. If even one ''Must have'' requirement is not included, the project delivery should be considered a failure (note: requirements can be downgraded from ''Must have'', by agreement with all relevant stakeholders; for example, when new requirements are deemed more important). ''MUST'' can also be considered an [[acronym]] for the Minimum Usable SubseT.

; {{anchor|SHOULD}}{{anchor|should}} Should have
: Requirements labeled as ''Should have'' are important but not necessary for delivery in the current delivery timebox. While ''Should have'' requirements can be as important as ''Must have'', they are often not as time-critical or there may be another way to satisfy the requirement, so that it can be held back until a future delivery timebox.

; {{anchor|COULD}}{{anchor|could}} Could have
: Requirements labeled as ''Could have'' are desirable but not necessary, and could improve user experience or customer satisfaction for little development cost. These will typically be included if time and resources permit.

; {{anchor|WONT}}{{anchor|wont}} Won't have (this time)
: Requirements labeled as ''Won't have'' have been agreed by stakeholders as the least-critical, lowest-payback items, or not appropriate at that time. As a result, ''Won't have'' requirements are not planned into the schedule for the next delivery timebox. ''Won't have'' requirements are either dropped or reconsidered for inclusion in a later timebox. (Note: occasionally the term ''Would like to have'' is used; however, that usage is incorrect, as this last priority is clearly stating something is outside the scope of delivery).

===Variants===
Sometimes W is used to mean Wish (or Would), i.e. still possible but unlikely to be included (and less likely than Could). This is then distinguished from X for Excluded for items which are explicitly not included.

== Use of MoSCoW in new product development ==
In [[new product development]], particularly those following agile software development approaches, there is always more to do than there is time or funding to permit (hence the need for prioritization). 

For example, should a team have too many potential epics (i.e., high-level [[User story|stories]]) for the next release of their product, they could use the ''MoSCoW method'' to select which epics are ''Must have'', which ''Should have'', and so on; the [[minimum viable product]] (or MVP) would be all those epics marked as ''Must have''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Agile Project Management for Government|last=Wernham|first=Brian|publisher=Maitland and Strong|year=2012|isbn=0957223404|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oftentimes, a team will find that, even after identifying their MVP, they have too much work for their expected capacity. In such cases, the team could then use the ''MoSCoW method'' to select which features (or stories, if that is the subset of epics in their organisation) are ''Must have'', ''Should have'', and so on; the [[Incremental funding methodology|minimum marketable features]] (or MMF) would be all those marked as ''Must have''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Agile Practices for Waterfall Projects: Shifting Processes for Competitive Advantage|last=Davis|first=Barbee|publisher=J. Ross Publishing|year=2012|isbn=1604270837|series=Project Management Professional Series|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If there is sufficient capacity after selecting the MVP or MMF, the team could then plan to include ''Should have'' and even ''Could have'' items too.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Agile Development in the Real World|last=Cline|first=Alan|publisher=Apress|year=2015|isbn=1484216792|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Criticism ==
Criticism of the MoSCoW method includes: 
* Lack of rationale around how to rank competing requirements: why something is ''must'' rather than ''should''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  
* Ambiguity over timing, especially on the ''Won't have'' category: whether it is not in this release or not ever.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wiegers|first1=Karl|last2=Beatty|first2=Joy|title=Software Requirements|date=2013|publisher=Microsoft Press|location=Washington, USA|isbn=978-0-7356-7966-5|pages=320-321}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Potential for political focus on building new features over technical improvements (such as refactoring).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hotpmo.com/blog/moscow-kano-prioritize|title=Moscow or Kano - how do you prioritize?|last=McIntyre|first=John|date=October 20, 2016|work=|newspaper=HotPMO!|access-date=October 23, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Núria Añó''' ({{IPA-ca|ˈnuɾiə əˈɲo|lang}}, {{IPA-es|ˈnuɾja aˈɲo|lang}}; born 1973 in [[Lleida]], Catalonia, Spain) studied Catalan Philology and German Language. She is a Catalan writer, a translator and a speaker at conferences and symposia, where she gives papers on literary creation or [[author]]s like [[Elfriede Jelinek]], [[Patricia Highsmith]], [[Salka Viertel]], [[Franz Werfel]], [[Karen Blixen]] or [[Alexandre Dumas, fils]].

Añó started writing tales at a young age and published her first story in 1990. After that some of her short stories have been published in anthology books. In 1996 she was awarded the 18th City of Almenara [[Joan Fuster]] Prize for Fiction. Her fiction story ''2066. Comença l'etapa de correcció'' (2066. Beginning the age of correction)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cafebabel.co.uk/article/17224/2066-beginning-the-age-of-correction.html The short story "2066. Beginning the age of correction"]. Cafebabel, June 19, 2006. {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Presage'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whenwomenwaken.org/presage-by-nuria-ano/ The short story "Presage"]. Fall 2013 Issue 3 – Grief, 2013. {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; about [[domestic violence]], both are translated into English. Also some [[article (publishing)|article]]s and [[essays]] such as ''The Mother Tongue in Foreign Lands'' or about the city of [[Shanghai]] ''A Catalyst City for Creativity'' are translated into Spanish, English, French, German, Italian, [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]] or [[Latvian language|Latvian]].

Her first novel ''Els nens de l'Elisa'' was third among the finalists for the 24th [[Ramon Llull]] Prize&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.vilaweb.cat/noticia/803429/deu-obres-passen-recta-final-premi-ramon-llull.html Deu obres passen a la recta final del Premi Ramon Llull]". [[Vilaweb]], January 28, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; for [[Catalan literature]], one of the most relevant literary awards in [[Catalan language]]. ''L'escriptora morta'' was published in 2008 and ''Núvols baixos'', in 2009. ''La mirada del fill'', published in 2012, is her most recent novel. Today, some of her novels are translated into Spanish.

==Style==

Añó's writing style is very ambitious and risky, it focuses on the psychology of her [[character (arts)|characters]], generally [[antiheroes]] avoiding [[Manichaeism]].&lt;ref&gt;"Not, A.: Critic review of the book Els nens de l'Elisa, in: Ateneu, La Mañana, September 24, 2006, page 63.&lt;/ref&gt; "The characters are the most important" in her books, "much more than the topic",&lt;ref&gt;"Sáez, A.: Interview with the author, in: [http://www.segre.com Segre], September 12, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; due to "an introspection, a reflection, not sentimental, but feminine".&lt;ref&gt;"Santa, A.: About the book ''Núvols baixos'', in the [[Public Library of Lleida]]: [http://www.segre.com Segre]", June 20, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Although her novels cover a multitude of topics, treat actual and socially relevant problems, injustices and poor communication between people. Frequently, the core of her stories remains unexplained and Núria Añó asks the reader to discover the "deeper meaning"&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.lamanyana.es/web/html/lanoticia.html?id=92285 La leridana Núria Añó narra la historia de una actriz en la madurez de su profesión]". La Mañana, June 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and to become involved in the events presented.

==Awards==

In 2016 she was distinguished by the culture association Nuoren Voiman Liitto in [[Sysmä]], [[Finland]]. Later, she won a grant at the Shanghai Writing Program, in [[Shanghai]], [[China]]. In 2017 she was distinguished by the Baltic Centre for Writers and Translators in [[Visby]], [[Sweden]]. Late in the fall, by International Writer's and Translators' Center of [[Rhodes]] in [[Greece]]. In 2018 she was selected for the residency [[Krakow]] [[UNESCO City of Literature]] in [[Poland]].

A '''player''' of a [[game]] is a participant therein. The term 'player' is used with this same meaning both in [[game theory]] and in ordinary recreational [[game]]s.

Normally, there are at least two players in a game, but one-player games exist and are collectively known as [[wikt:solitary|solitary]] games (such as the ''[[Solitaire]]'' card game and many [[video game]]s).

"To become a player, one must voluntarily accept the rules and constraints of a game." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fullerton|title=Game Design Workshop: A Playcentric Approach To Creating Innovative Games|url=http://host.conseiljedi.com/~kira/Game%20Design%20Workshop-A%20playcentric%20approach%20to%20creating%20innovative%20games-2nd%20Edition.pdf|year=2008|publisher=Elsevier|language=English|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Players in competition==
In most games, one player (or team) is declared the [[wikt:winner|winner]], the player who performed the best. Some multiplayer games can have multiple winners, but in [[Western world|Western]] societies, one player (or team) is normally considered to be the "1st place", or best, among them, and tie-breaking structures are commonly used to ensure a singular "1st place". This is not true universally, however; for example, in [[Japan]], ties are considered to be wins for both sides. Some games use multiple means of [[Score (gaming)|scoring]] or determining the conditions of victory; in these games, it may be possible for two or more players or teams to simultaneously win, which, depending on the game, may be counted as wins for both or simply a tie.

Among the players on a team, the one who plays the best in a given contest may be deemed the player or over the course of a series or season may be deemed the [[most valuable player]] for that period. They may also be identified as a [[player of the Match]], [[Player of the Week (disambiguation)|player of the week]], [[player of the month (disambiguation)|player of the month]], [[player of the year]], or even [[player of the century]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3296">A '''possessory credit''' in [[filmmaking]] is the use of a [[Motion picture credits|film credit]] which gives primary artistic recognition to a single person, usually (but not always) the film's [[film director|director]]. Examples include "A [[Stanley Kubrick]] film" (''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]''), "A film by [[Quentin Tarantino]]" (''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]''), and "[[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s Psycho" (''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''). Possessory credit is also sometimes used in [[television program]]s; for example, "[[Tyler Perry's House of Payne]]" (Tyler Perry's [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] sitcom ''House of Payne''). Occasionally another word besides "film" is used, such as "A [[Spike Lee]] Joint" or "A [[Martin Scorsese]] Picture". Possessory credit may also be given to the [[film producer|producer]]; an example of this is "[[Steven Spielberg]] presents ''[[Back to the Future]]''".

Although the earliest use of possessory credit dates from 1915's ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'', the use of possessory credits expanded particularly in the 1970s and 1980s. The [[Writers Guild of America]] has repeatedly tried to limit possessory credits to writers but has always been successfully opposed by the [[Directors Guild of America|Directors Guild of America (DGA)]], leaving directors free to try to negotiate such credits if they wish.&lt;ref&gt;[[Directors Guild of America]] Magazine, [http://www.dga.org/news/v28_6/news_pc-timeline.php3 Possessory Credit Timeline], 28(6), February 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the possessory credit  goes to the author of the novel on which the film was based  (such as ''[[Bram Stoker's Dracula]]'' or ''[[William Shakespeare]]'s [[Romeo + Juliet]]''). In the case of ''[[Tim Burton]]'s [[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'', Burton was not the film's director but instead the writer, producer, and a major creative voice. This may also be an example of a possessory credit being chosen for marketing reasons, as Burton was a more recognized name than the film's director, [[Henry Selick]].

The DGA encourages filmmakers to use restraint in taking credit until they have attained widespread name recognition or received at least two established awards of merit for their films, thereby securing their legacies as filmmakers.

== Video games ==
Possessory credits are sometimes used for video games such as ''[[American McGee's Alice]]'', ''[[Sid Meier's Civilization]]'', games released by [[Tom Clancy]]'s [[Red Storm Entertainment]], and games in the ''[[Metal Gear]]'' series.

They are also used when celebrities have licensed their names for use in games, or are involved with the game's development—for example, ''[[Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!]]'', and skater [[Tony Hawk]]'s [[Tony Hawk (series)|various games]].

'''Symbolically Isolated Linguistically Variable Intelligence Algorithms''', or more popularly known as '''SILVIA''', is a core platform technology developed by Cognitive Code. SILVIA was developed, and designed to recognize and interpret speech, text, and interact with applications and [[operating system]]s, all while interacting with a user. The technology can be run and operate via [[Cloud computing|cloud]], a [[mobile application]], a part of network, or via server.&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/karstenstrauss/2012/07/09/riding-the-wave-of-artificial-intelligence/ | title=Riding the Wave of Artificial Intelligence | publisher=''[[Forbes]]'' | date=July 9, 2012 | accessdate=May 25, 2013 | author=Strauss, Karsten | pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Leslie Spring, the company's general partners include Mimi Chen and John Albert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.launchfn.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderfiles/cognitive.pdf | title=Cognitive Code Funding | publisher=''Launch Funding Network'' | accessdate=May 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive Code received venture capital funding from CMV Capital Ventures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://silvia4u.info/investors/ | title=Cognitive Code Investors | publisher=''Cognitive Code'' | accessdate=May 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The platform was initially released on January 1, 2008.&lt;ref name="CB 1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.crunchbase.com/company/cognitivecode | title=Cognitive Code | publisher=''[[CrunchBase]]'' | accessdate=May 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Features and system requirements===
SILVIA was developed to recognized and interpret any human interaction: through text, speech, and any other human input. The platform allows an application of it in all applicable and possible application which then allows natural and intuitive [[human interaction]].&lt;ref name="Forbes"/&gt; The system also allows easy implementation. It has a complete set of [[graphical user interface|graphical user interface tools]] which can aid in developing intelligent objects or [[entity|entities]], and has an array of API scripts which can be embed in any compatible applications.&lt;ref name="Engadget 1"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.engadget.com/2007/09/17/cognitive-code-shows-off-silvia-artificial-intelligence-platform/ | title=Cognitive Code shows off SILVIA artificial intelligence platform | publisher=''[[Engadget]]'' | date=September 17, 2007 | accessdate=May 30, 2013 | author=Melanson, Donald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Differentiating SILVIA from other similar technologies, the platform can be used in different computing platforms and operating systems which can seamlessly allow easy transfer of data.&lt;ref name="VB"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://venturebeatprofiles.com/company/profile/cognitive-code/ | title=Cognitive Code | publisher=''[[VentureBeat]]'' | accessdate=May 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from being available in almost all platforms, SILVIA uses a non-command based system wherein inputs are based on normal human conversational language, not on pre-coded commands like what [[Google]]'s [[Google Now]] and [[Apple Inc.]]'s [[Siri (software)|Siri]] used.&lt;ref name="Fora TV"/&gt;

===Components===
SILVIA is composed of several components:
* '''SILVIA Core:''' A runtime engine which can be configurable for use in any user, server, or mobile systems. It can also be embedded.&lt;ref name="Components"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://silvia4u.info/technology/ | title=Components of the SILVIA Technology | publisher=''Cognitive Code'' | accessdate=May 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''SILVIA Server:''' A configurable system of SILVIA Cores for automated management.&lt;ref name="Components"/&gt;
* '''SILVIA Voice:''' A modular component designed for accepting voice input and rendering voice output. It can be used within an application, web page, or as part of SILVIA server for better optimization of media streaming.&lt;ref name="Components"/&gt;
* '''SILVIA API:''' Is one of the several components of SILVIA wherein programmers are allowed to create applications, and plug-in based functionality.&lt;ref name="Components"/&gt;
* '''SILVIA Studio:''' A graphical system for application-specific behavior development.&lt;ref name="Components"/&gt;

===Use===
SILVIA can be used in several applications, such as: being used in [[call centers]], [[smart phones]] like the [[iPhone]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices, and [[voice search]] or other voice-related applications. Unlike other similar technologies, SILVIA can intelligently respond to its users, not in one or two words or small phrases but in complete sentences.&lt;ref name="Dondon 1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://dondodge.typepad.com/the_next_big_thing/2007/09/techcrunch40--1.html | title=TechCrunch40 - First 10 companies | publisher=''[[Don Dodge|Don Dodge on The Next Big Thing]]'' | date=September 17, 2007 | accessdate=May 29, 2013 | author=[[Don Dodge|Dodge, Don]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SILVIA has been used by several companies such as [[Northrop Grumman]].&lt;ref name="Forbes"/&gt; Northrop Grumman used the technology in order to aid the company's employees to much better communicate with computers and mobile devices using natural language.&lt;ref name="Speech 1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.speechtechmag.com/Articles/?ArticleID=67168 | title=Cognitive Code is Approved Vendor for Northrop Grumman | publisher=''[[Speech Technology (magazine)|Speech Technology]]'' | date=May 12, 2010 | accessdate=May 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company also utilizes the technology in the development and deployment of military training applications.&lt;ref name="Forbes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IBT"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ibtimes.com/press-release/20100512/cognitive-code-approved-vendor-northrop-grumman-561694 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204092843/http://www.ibtimes.com/press-release/20100512/cognitive-code-approved-vendor-northrop-grumman-561694 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=February 4, 2016 | title=Cognitive Code is Approved Vendor for Northrop Grumman | publisher=''[[International Business Times]]'' | accessdate=May 30, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "SILVIA is also currently being used for training and simulation applications for the [[United States Army|US Military]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tuttoandroid.net/android/silvia-per-android-assistente-vocale-nativo-50472/ | title=SILVIA per Android, assistente vocale nativo per smartphone e tablet | publisher=''TuttoAndroid'' | date=May 31, 2012 | accessdate=May 30, 2013 | language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Phone 1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.phonearena.com/news/SILVIA-project-for-Android-aims-to-topple-Siri-and-S-Voice_id30770 | title=SILVIA project for Android aims to topple Siri and S Voice | publisher=''Phone Arena'' | date=May 31, 2012 | accessdate=May 30, 2013 | author=Daniel P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The platform is also revolutionary as it can also be used in [[Video game culture|gaming]] through its SILVIA Unity platform,&lt;ref name="Androrev"/&gt; and is currently being introduced for use in [[toys]].&lt;ref name="MIT 1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.technologyreview.com/news/408699/intelligent-chatty-machines/ | title=Intelligent, Chatty Machines | publisher=''[[MIT Technology Review]]'' | date=September 19, 2007 | accessdate=May 30, 2013 | author=Kate Greene}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==
Cognitive Code and its technology platform was included in the list of [[TechCrunch]]'s ''TechCrunch40''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://techcrunch.com/2007/09/17/cognitive-code-at-tc40/ | title=Cognitive Code at TC40 | publisher=''[[TechCrunch]]'' | date=September 17, 2007 | accessdate=May 30, 2013 | author=Robinson, Blake}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian 1"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/pda/2007/sep/17/techcrunch40thesearchguys | title=@TechCrunch40: The search guys | publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' | date=September 17, 2007 | accessdate=May 29, 2013 | author=Kiss, Jemima}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove|date=September 2012}}
[[Image:Sagitta.svg|right|thumb|400px|Visualization of the sagitta]]
In [[geometry]], the '''sagitta''' (sometimes abbreviated as '''sag'''&lt;ref name="Shaneyfelt"&gt;{{cite web | title=德博士的 Notes About Circles, ज्य, &amp; कोज्य: What in the world is a hacovercosine? | first=Ted V. | last=Shaneyfelt | publisher=[[University of Hawaii]] | location=Hilo, Hawaii | url=http://www2.hawaii.edu/~tvs/trig.html | access-date=2015-11-08 |dead-url=no | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919053929/http://www2.hawaii.edu/~tvs/trig.html | archive-date=2015-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;) of a [[circular arc]] is the distance from the center of the arc to the center of its base.&lt;ref name="Woodward_1978"/&gt; It is used extensively in architecture when calculating the arc necessary to span a certain height and distance and also in optics where it is used to find the depth of a spherical mirror or lens. The name comes directly from [[Latin]] ''sagitta'', meaning an arrow.
{{wikt|sagitta}}

==Formulae==
In the following equations, {{mvar|s}} denotes the sagitta (the depth of the arc), {{mvar|r}} equals the radius of the circle, and {{mvar|ℓ}} half the length of the [[Chord (geometry)|chord]] spanning the base of the arc.  As {{mvar|ℓ}} and {{math|''r''&amp;minus;''s''}} are two sides of a [[right triangle]] with {{mvar|r}} as the [[hypotenuse]], the [[Pythagorean theorem]] gives us
: &lt;math&gt;r^2 = \ell^2 + (r-s)^2.&lt;/math&gt;
This may be rearranged to give any of the other three:
: &lt;math&gt;s = r - \sqrt{r^2 - {\ell^2}}, &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\ell = \sqrt{2rs - s^2},&lt;/math&gt;  or
: &lt;math&gt;r = \frac{s^2 + \ell^2}{2s} = \frac{s}{2}+\frac{\ell^2}{2s}.&lt;/math&gt;
The sagitta may also be calculated from the [[versine]] function, for an arc that spans an angle of {{math|1=''Δ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2''θ''}}, and coincides with the versine for unit circles
: &lt;math&gt;s = r \operatorname{versin}\theta = r\left(1-\cos\theta\right) = 2r\sin^2\frac\theta 2.&lt;/math&gt;

==Approximation==
When the sagitta is small in comparison to the radius, it may be approximated by the formula
:&lt;math&gt;s\approx \frac{\ell^2}{2r}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Woodward_1978"&gt;{{cite book | title=Geometry - Plane, Solid &amp; Analytic Problem Solver | author-first=Ernest | author-last=Woodward&lt;!-- professor of mathematics at Austin Peay State University, Clarkesville, Tennessee, USA, not to be confused with (Ernest) [[Llewellyn Woodward]] --&gt; | series=Problem Solvers Solution Guides | publisher=[[Research &amp; Education Association]] (REA) | year=December 1978 | isbn=978-0-87891-510-1 | page=359 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4iNvcGB3M9sC&amp;pg=PA359}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, if the sagitta is small and the sagitta, radius, and half-chord length are known, they may be used to estimate the arc length by the formula
:&lt;math&gt;a\approx\ell+\frac{s^2}{r}&lt;/math&gt;,
where {{mvar|a}} is half the [[arclength|length of the arc]]; this formula was known to the Chinese mathematician [[Shen Kuo]], and a more accurate formula{{clarify |date=December 2015 |reason=What is this more accurate formula?}} also involving the sagitta was developed two centuries later by [[Guo Shoujing]].&lt;ref name="Needham_1959"&gt;{{cite book |title=Science and Civilisation in China: Mathematics and the Sciences of the Heavens and the Earth | first=Noel Joseph Terence Montgomery |last=Needham |author-link=Noel Joseph Terence Montgomery Needham |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=1959 |volume=3 |isbn=9780521058018 |page=39 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jfQ9E0u4pLAC&amp;pg=PA39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Architects, engineers, and contractors use these equations to create "flattened" arcs that are used in curved walls, arched ceilings, bridges, and numerous other applications.

The sagitta also has uses in physics where it is used, along with chord length, to calculate the radius of curvature of an accelerated particle. This is used especially in [[bubble chamber]] experiments where it is used to determine the momenta of decay particles.

The '''Salic law''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|æ|l|ᵻ|k}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|eɪ|l|ᵻ|k}}; {{lang-la|Lex salica}}), or the {{nowrap|'''Salian law''',}} was the ancient [[Salian Franks|Salian Frankish]] [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law code]] compiled around AD 500 by the first [[Frankish King]], [[Clovis I|Clovis]]. The written text is in [[Latin]], or in "[[French language|semi-French Latin]]" according to some linguists,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=vb0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;|title=Lex Salica: The Ten Texts with the Glosses, and the Lex Emendata|last=Hessels|first=Jan Hendrik|publisher=John Murray|year=2016|isbn=978-1402146336|location=London|pages=438}}&lt;/ref&gt; it also contains what Dutch linguists describe as one of the earliest known records of [[Old Dutch]], perhaps second only to the [[Bergakker inscription]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kennislink.nl/publicaties/hoe-het-nederlands-is-ontstaan|title=Lees: Hoe het Nederlands is ontstaan|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It remained the basis of [[Franks|Frankish]] law throughout the [[early Medieval period]], and influenced future [[Western law#History|European legal systems]]. The best-known tenet of the old law is the principle of exclusion of women from inheritance of thrones, fiefs and other property. The Salic laws were arbitrated by a committee appointed and empowered by the [[King of the Franks]]. Dozens of manuscripts dating from the 6th to 8th centuries and three emendations as late as the 9th century have survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Drew|1991|page=53}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Salic law provided written codification of both civil law, such as the statutes governing [[inheritance]], and [[criminal law]], such as the punishment for [[murder]]. Although it was originally intended as the law of the [[Salian Franks|Salians]] or [[Western Franks]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=SvrgAwAAQBAJ&amp;|title=The Merovingian Kingdoms 450 - 751|last=Wood|first=Ian|date=2014-06-23|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9781317871156|location=|pages=114|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has had a formative influence on the tradition of [[statute law]] that extended to [[modern history]] in Western and [[Central Europe]], especially in the [[Germany|German]] states, the [[Netherlands]], parts of [[Italy]] and [[Spain]], [[Austria-Hungary]], [[Romania]], and the [[Balkans]].

==History of the law==
[[File:Salic Law.png|thumb|[[Clovis I|King Clovis]] dictates the ''Salic Law'' surrounded by his military chiefs.]]
The original edition of the code was commissioned by the first king of all the Franks, [[Clovis I]] (c. 466–511), and published sometime between 507 and 511.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hinckeldey|Fosberry|1993|p=7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He appointed four commissioners&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=History of languages: an introduction | first=Tore | last=Janson | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2011 | series=Oxford textbooks in linguistics | page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; to research uses{{clarify|date=May 2017}} of laws that, until the publication of the Salic Law, had been recorded only in the minds of designated elders, who would meet in council when their knowledge was required. Transmission was entirely oral. Salic Law therefore reflects ancient usages and practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Drew|1991|p=20}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to govern more effectively, it was desirable for monarchs and their administrations to have a written code. The name of the code comes from the circumstance that Clovis was a [[Merovingians|Merovingian]] king ruling only the [[Salian Franks]] before his unification of [[Francia]]. The law must have applied to the [[Ripuarian Franks]] as well; however, containing only 65 titles, it may not have included any special Ripuarian laws.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

For the next 300 years the code was copied by hand, and was amended as required to add newly enacted laws, revise laws that had been amended, and delete laws that had been repealed. In contrast with printing, hand copying is an individual act by an individual copyist with ideas and a style of his own. Each of the several dozen surviving manuscripts features a unique set of errors, corrections, content and organization. The laws are called "titles" as each one has its own name, generally preceded by ''de'', "of", "concerning". Different sections of titles acquired individual names which revealed something about their provenances. Some of these dozens of names have been adopted for specific reference, often given the same designation as the overall work, ''lex''.

===Merovingian phase===
The [[recension]] of [[Johan Hendrik Caspar Kern|Hendrik Kern]] organizes all of the manuscripts into five families according to similarity and relative chronological sequence, judged by content and dateable material in the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kern|1880|loc=Prologue}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Family I is the oldest, containing four manuscripts dated to the 8th and 9th centuries but containing 65 titles believed to be copies of originals published in the 6th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kern|1880|p=xiv}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition they feature the ''Malbergse Glossen'', "Malberg Glosses", marginal [[Gloss (annotation)|glosses]] stating the native court word for some Latin words. These are named from native{{clarify|date=May 2017}} ''malbergo'', "language of the court".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Young|Gloning|2004|p=56}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Kern's Family II, represented by two manuscripts, is the same{{clarify|date=May 2017}} as Family I, except that it contains "interpolations or numerous additions which point to a later period".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kern|1880|p=xv}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carolingian phase===
Family III is split into two divisions. The first, comprising three manuscripts, dated to the 8th–9th centuries, presents an expanded text of 99 or 100 titles. The Malberg Glosses are retained. The second division, with four manuscripts, not only drops the glosses, but "bears traces of attempts to make the language more concise".&lt;ref name=Kernxvii&gt;{{harvnb|Kern|1880|p=xvii}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A statement gives the provenance: "in the 13th year of the reign of our most glorious king of the Franks, Pipin".&lt;ref name=Kernxvii/&gt; Some of the internal documents were composed after the reign of [[Pepin the Short]], but it is considered to be an emendation initiated by Pepin, and is therefore termed the ''Pipina Recensio''.

Family IV also has two divisions: the first comprised 33 manuscripts; the second, one manuscript. They are characterized by the internal assignment of Latin names to various sections of different provenance. Two of the sections are dated to 768 and 778, but the emendation is believed to be dated to 798, late in the reign of [[Charlemagne]]. This edition calls itself{{clarify|date=May 2017}} the ''Lex Salica Emendata'', or the ''Lex Reformata'', or the ''Lex Emendata'', and is clearly the result of a law code reform by Charlemagne.&lt;ref name="Kernxvii"/&gt;

By that time his [[Holy Roman Empire]] comprised most of Western Europe. He adds laws of choice{{clarify|date=May 2017}} taken from the earlier law codes of Germanic peoples not originally part of Francia. These are numbered into{{clarify|date=May 2017}} the laws that were there, but they have their own, quasi-sectional, title. All the Franks of Francia were subject to the same law code, which retained the overall title of ''Lex Salica''. These integrated sections borrowed from other Germanic codes are the ''[[Lex Ripuaria|Lex Ribuariorum]]'', later ''Lex Ribuaria'', laws adopted from the [[Ripuarian Franks]], who, before Clovis, had been independent. The ''[[Lex Alamannorum]]'' took laws from the [[Alamanni]], then subject to the Franks. Under the Franks, they were governed by Frankish law, not their own. The inclusion of some of their law as part of the Salic Law must have served as a palliative.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Charlemagne goes back even earlier to the ''Lex Suauorum'', the ancient code of the [[Suebi]] preceding the Alemanni.

==Old Dutch glosses==
{{see also|Old Dutch}}

Glosses to the Salic law code (the ''Malbergse glossen'') contain several Old Dutch words and what is likely the earliest full sentence in the language:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Dutch: Biography of a Language | first = Roland | last = Willemyns | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2013 | isbn = 978-0-19-932366-1 | page = 41 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
|}
&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; Old Dutch and Early Modern and earlier versions of English used the second-person singular pronoun, like ''thou'' and ''thee''.

&lt;nowiki&gt;**&lt;/nowiki&gt; A ''lito'' was a form of [[serfdom|serf]] in the [[feudal system]], a half-free farmer, connected to the lord's land but not owned by that lord. In contrast, a slave was fully owned by the lord.

==Some tenets of the law==
These laws and their interpretations give an insight into Frankish society. The criminal laws established damages to be paid and fines levied in recompense for injuries to persons and damage to goods (e.g. [[slave]]s), [[theft]], and unprovoked insults. One-third of the fine paid court costs. Judicial interpretation was by a [[jury of peers]].

The civil law establishes that an individual person is legally unprotected if he or she does not belong to a [[family]]. The rights of family members were defined: for example, the equal division of land among all living male heirs, in contrast to [[primogeniture]].

===Agnatic succession===
One tenet of the civil law is [[Patrilineality#Agnatic succession|agnatic succession]], explicitly excluding females from the inheritance of a throne or [[fief]]. Indeed, "Salic law" has often been used simply as a [[synonym]] for agnatic succession. But the importance of Salic law extends beyond the rules of inheritance, as it is a direct ancestor of the systems of law in use in many parts of continental Europe today.

Salic law regulates succession according to sex. ''Agnatic succession'' means succession to the throne or fief going to an agnate of the predecessor: for example, a brother, a son, or nearest male relative through the male line, including collateral agnate branches, for example very distant cousins. Chief forms are ''[[agnatic seniority]]'' and ''[[agnatic primogeniture]]''. The latter, which has been the most usual, means succession going to the eldest son of the monarch; if the monarch had no sons, the throne would pass to the nearest male relative in the male line.

===Female inheritance===
{{expert needed|date=May 2017}}
{{See also|Terra salica}}
Concerning the inheritance of land, Salic Law said:

{{quote|But of Salic land no portion of the inheritance shall come to a woman: but the whole inheritance of the land shall come to the male sex.&lt;ref&gt;Cave, Roy and Coulson, Herbert. ''A Source Book for Medieval Economic History'', Biblo and Tannen, New York (1965) p.&amp;nbsp;336&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|concerning terra Salica no portion or inheritance is for a woman but all the land belongs to members of the male sex who are brothers.}}

As interpreted by the Salian Franks, the law merely prohibited women from inheriting ancestral "Salic land"; this prohibition did not apply to other property (such as [[personal property]]); and under [[Chilperic I]] sometime around the year 570, the law was actually amended to permit inheritance of land by a daughter if a man had no surviving sons. (This amendment, depending on how it is applied and interpreted, offers the basis for either Semi-Salic succession or male-preferred [[primogeniture]], or both.)

The wording of the law, as well as common usage in those days and centuries afterwards, seems to support an interpretation that inheritance is divided between brothers. And, if it is intended to govern succession, it can be interpreted to mandate [[agnatic seniority]], not direct primogeniture.

In its use by Continental hereditary monarchies since the 15th century, aiming at agnatic succession, the Salic law is regarded as excluding all females from the succession as well as prohibiting the transfer of succession rights through any woman. At least two systems of hereditary succession are direct and full applications of the Salic Law: [[agnatic seniority]] and [[agnatic primogeniture]].

The so-called ''Semi-Salic'' version of succession order stipulates that firstly all-male descendance is applied, including all collateral male lines; but if all such lines are extinct, then the closest female agnate (such as a daughter) of the last male holder of the property inherits, and after her, her own male heirs according to the Salic order. In other words, the female closest to the last incumbent is "regarded as a male" for the purposes of inheritance and succession. This has the effect of following the closest extant blood line (at least in the first instance) and not involving any more distant relatives (see, for example: [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713]] in Austria). The closest female relative might be a child of a relatively junior{{clarify|date=May 2017}} branch of the whole dynasty, but still inherits due to her position in the male line, thanks to the longevity of her own branch{{clarify|date=May 2017}}; any existing senior{{clarify|date=May 2017}} female lines come behind that of the closest female.

From the Middle Ages, there was{{clarify|date=May 2017}}{{Fix|text=where/when was this system used?}} another system of succession, known as cognatic male primogeniture, which actually fulfills apparent stipulations{{clarify|date=May 2017}} of the original Salic law: succession is allowed also through female lines, but excludes the females themselves in favour of their sons. For example, a grandfather, without sons, is succeeded by a son of his daughter, when the daughter in question is still alive. Or an uncle, with no children of his own, is succeeded by a son of his sister, when the sister in question is still alive.

Strictly seen{{clarify|date=June 2017}}, this fulfils the Salic condition of "no land comes to a woman, but the land comes to the male sex". This can be called a ''Quasi-Salic'' system of succession and it should be classified as primogenitural, cognatic, and male.

==Applications of the succession and inheritance laws==

===In France===
The Merovingian kings divided their realm equally among all living sons, leading to much conflict and fratricide among the rival heirs. The Carolingians did likewise, but they also possessed the imperial dignity, which was indivisible and passed to only one person at a time. Primogeniture, or the preference for the eldest line in the transmission of inheritance, eventually emerged in France, under the Capetian kings. The early Capetians had only one heir, the eldest son, whom they [[Coronation of the French monarch#Coronation of the heir|crowned during their lifetime]]. Instead of an equal portion of the inheritance, the younger sons of the Capetian kings received an [[appanage]], which is a feudal territory under the suzerainty of the king. Feudal law allowed the transmission of fiefs to daughters in default of sons, which was also the case for the early appanages. Whether feudal law also applied to the French throne no one knew, until 1316.

====The succession in 1316====
For a remarkably long period, from the inception of the Capetian dynasty in 987 until the death of [[Louis X of France|Louis X]] in 1316, the eldest living son of the King of France succeeded to the throne upon his demise. There was no prior occasion to demonstrate whether or not females were excluded from the succession to the crown. Louis X died without a son, but left his wife pregnant. The king's brother, [[Philip V of France|Philip, Count of Poitiers]], became regent. Philip prepared for the contingencies with [[Odo IV, Duke of Burgundy]], maternal uncle of Louis X's daughter and prospective heiress, [[Joan II of Navarre|Joan]]. If the unborn child was male, he would succeed to the French throne as king; if female, Philip would maintain the regency until the daughters of Louis X reach their majority. There was opportunity for either daughter to succeed to the French throne.

The unborn child proved to be male, [[John I of France|John I]], to the relief of the kingdom. But the infant lived for only a few days. Philip saw his chance and broke the agreement with the Duke of Burgundy by having himself anointed at Reims in January 1317 as [[Philip V of France]]. [[Agnes of France, Duchess of Burgundy|Agnes of France]], daughter of Saint Louis, mother of the Duke of Burgundy, and maternal grandmother of the Princess Joan, considered it an usurpation and demanded an assembly of the peers, which Philip V accepted.

An assembly of prelates, lords, the bourgeois of Paris and doctors of the University, known as the Estates-General of 1317, gathered in February. Philip V asked them to write an argument justifying his right to the throne of France. These "general statements" agreed in declaring that "Women do not succeed the kingdom of France", formalizing Philip's usurpation and the impossibility for a woman to ascend the throne of France, a principle in force until the end of the monarchy. The Salic law, at the time, was not yet invoked: the arguments put forward in favor of Philip V relied only on the degree of proximity of Philip V with St. Louis. Philip had the support of the nobility and had the resources for his ambitions.

Philip won over the Duke of Burgundy by giving him his daughter, also named [[Joan III, Countess of Burgundy|Joan]], in marriage, with the counties of Artois and Burgundy as her eventual inheritance. On March 27, 1317, a treaty was signed at Laon between the Duke of Burgundy and Philip V, wherein Joan renounced her right to the throne of France.

====The succession in 1328====
Philip, too, died without a son, and his brother Charles succeeded him as [[Charles IV of France|Charles IV]] unopposed. Charles, too, died without a son, but also left his wife pregnant. It was another succession crisis, the same as that in 1316: it was necessary both to prepare for a possible regency (and choose a regent) and prepare for a possible succession to the throne. At this point, it had been accepted that women could not claim the crown of France (without any written rule stipulating it yet).

Under the application of the agnatic principle, the following were excluded:
*the daughters of Louis X, Philip V and Charles IV, including the possible unborn daughter of the pregnant Queen [[Jeanne d'Évreux]];
*[[Isabella of France]], sister of Louis X, Philip V and Charles IV, wife of King [[Edward II of England]].

The widow of Charles IV gave birth to a daughter. [[Isabella of France]], sister of Charles IV, claimed the throne for her son, [[Edward III of England]]. The French rejected the claim, noting that "Women cannot transmit a right which they do not possess", a corollary to the succession principle in 1316. The regent, Philip of Valois, became [[Philip VI of France]] in 1328. Philip became king without serious opposition, until his attempt to confiscate [[Gascony]] in 1337 made Edward III press his claim to the French throne.

====Emergence of the Salic law====
As far as can be ascertained, ''Salic law'' was not explicitly mentioned either in 1316 or 1328. It had been forgotten in the feudal era, and the assertion that the French crown can only be transmitted to and through males made it unique and exalted in the eyes of the French. Jurists later resurrected the long-defunct Salic law and reinterpreted it to justify the line of succession arrived at in the cases of 1316 and 1328 by forbidding not only inheritance by a woman but also inheritance through a female line (''In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant'').

In its origin, therefore, the agnatic principle was limited to the succession to the crown of France. Prior to the Valois succession, Capetian kings granted appanages to their younger sons and brothers, which could pass to male and female heirs. But the appanages given to the Valois princes, in imitation of the succession law of the monarchy that gave them, limited their transmission to males. Another Capetian lineage, the [[Montfort of Brittany]], claimed male succession in the Duchy of Brittany. In this they were supported by the King of England, while their rivals who claimed the traditional female succession in Brittany were supported by the King of France. The Montforts eventually won the duchy by warfare, but had to recognize the suzerainty of the King of France.

This law was by no means intended to cover all matters of inheritance — for example, not the inheritance of movables – only those lands considered "Salic" — and there is still debate as to the legal definition of this word, although it is generally accepted to refer to lands in the royal [[fisc]].  Only several hundred years later, under the [[House of Capet|Direct Capetian]] kings of [[France]] and their English contemporaries who held lands in France, did Salic law become a rationale for enforcing or debating succession.  By then it was somewhat anachronistic — there were no Salic lands, since the Salian monarchy and its lands had originally emerged in what is now the [[Netherlands]].

Shakespeare claims that [[Charles VI of France|Charles VI]] rejected [[Henry V of England|Henry V]]'s claim to the French throne on the basis of Salic law's inheritance rules, leading to the [[Battle of Agincourt]].  In fact, the conflict between Salic law and English law was a justification for [[English claims to the French throne|many overlapping claims]] between the French  and English monarchs over the French Throne.

More than a century later, [[Philip II of Spain]] attempted to claim the French crown for his daughter [[Isabella Clara Eugenia]], born of his Valois queen. Philip's agents were instructed to "insinuate cleverly" that the Salic law was a "pure invention". But even if the "Salic law" did not really apply to the throne of France, the very principle of agnatic succession had become a cornerstone of the French royal succession; they had upheld it in the Hundred Years' War with the English, and it had produced their kings for more than two centuries. The eventual recognition of [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]], the first of the Bourbons kings, further solidified the agnatic principle in France.

===Other European applications===
A number of military conflicts in European history have stemmed from the application of, or disregard for, Salic law. The [[Carlist Wars]] occurred in [[Spain]] over the question of whether the heir to the throne should be a female or a male relative. The [[War of the Austrian Succession]] was triggered by the [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713]] in which [[Charles VI of Austria]], who himself had inherited the Austrian patrimony over his nieces as a result of Salic law, attempted to ensure the inheritance directly to his own daughter [[Maria Theresa of Austria]], that being an example of an operation of the ''Semi-Salic law''.

In the modern [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]], under the [[House of Savoy]], succession to the throne was regulated by Salic law.

The [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] and the [[Kingdom of Hanover|Hanoverian]] thrones separated after the death of King [[William IV of the United Kingdom]] and of Hanover, in 1837. Hanover practised Semi-Salic law, but not Britain. King William's niece, [[Queen Victoria|Victoria]], ascended to the throne of Great Britain and Ireland, but the throne of Hanover went to William's brother [[Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover|Ernest, Duke of Cumberland]].

Salic law was also an important issue in the [[Schleswig-Holstein Question]] and played a weary prosaic day-to-day role in the inheritance and marriage decisions of common princedoms of the [[List of historic states of Germany|German states]], such as [[Saxe-Weimar]], to cite a representative example. It is not much of an overstatement to say that European nobility confronted Salic issues at every turn and nuance of diplomacy, and certainly, especially when negotiating marriages, for the entire male line had to be extinguished for a land title to pass (by marriage) ''to a female's husband''—women rulers were anathema in the German states well into the modern era.

In a similar way, the thrones of  the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]] and the [[Luxembourg|Grand Duchy of Luxembourg]] were separated in 1890, with the succession of [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Princess Wilhelmina]] as the first [[Queen regnant]] of the Netherlands. As a remnant of Salic law, the office of the reigning [[monarch]] of the [[Netherlands]] is always formally known as 'King' even though her title may be 'Queen'. Luxembourg passed to the [[House of Orange-Nassau]]'s distantly-related agnates, the [[House of Nassau-Weilburg]].  However, that house too faced extinction in the male line less than two decades later.  With no other male-line agnates in the remaining branches of the House of Nassau, [[William IV, Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Grand Duke William IV]] adopted a semi-salic law of succession so that he could be succeeded by his daughters.

==Literary references==
*[[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] uses the Salic Law as a plot device in ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'', saying it was upheld by the French to bar Henry V’s claiming the French throne. The play ''Henry V'' begins with the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] being asked if the claim might be upheld despite the Salic Law. The Archbishop replies, "That the '''''land Salique''''' is in Germany, between the floods of [[Saale|Sala]] and of [[Elbe]]", implying that the law is German, not French. The Archbishop's justification for Henry's claim, which Shakespeare intentionally renders obtuse and verbose (for comedic as well as politically expedient reasons), is also erroneous, as the [[Salian Franks]] settled along the lower [[Rhine]] and [[Scheldt]], which today is for the most part in the [[Flemish Region]].
*In the novel ''[[Royal Flash]]'', by [[George MacDonald Fraser]], the hero, [[Harry Flashman]], on his marriage, is presented with the Royal Consort's portion of the Crown Jewels, and "The Duchess did rather better"; the character, feeling hard done-by, thinks, "It struck me then, and it strikes me now, that the Salic Law was a damned sound idea".&lt;ref&gt;G. M. Fraser (2006) ''Royal Flash'', p.&amp;nbsp;172, Grafton paperback.&lt;/ref&gt;

Religions often emphasize the necessity of both personal effort—for example, [[repentance]] and [[asceticism]]—and divine action (e.g. grace).

In contemporary [[Judaism]], redemption ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''ge'ulah''), refers to [[God in Judaism|God]] redeeming the [[Israelites|people of Israel]] from their various exiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.kolel.org/pages/reb_on_the_web/redemption.html |title=Reb on the Web |publisher=Kolel: The Adult Centre for Liberal Jewish Learning |accessdate=November 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes the [[Jewish eschatology|final redemption]] from the present exile.&lt;ref name=EBJ&gt;Salvation, Judaism.

Judaism holds that adherents do not need personal salvation as Christians believe. Jews do not subscribe to the doctrine of [[original sin]].&lt;ref&gt;"How Does a Jew Attain Salvation?" [http://www.beingjewish.com/toshuv/salvation.html] Accessed: 4 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, they place a high value on individual morality as defined in the law of God — embodied in what Jews know as the [[Torah]] or The Law, given to [[Moses]] by God on [[biblical Mount Sinai]].

In Judaism, salvation is closely related to the idea of [[redemption (theology)|redemption]], a saving from the states or circumstances that destroy the value of human existence. God, as the universal spirit and Creator of the World, is the source of all salvation for humanity, provided an individual honours God by observing his precepts. So redemption or salvation depends on the individual. Judaism stresses that salvation cannot be obtained through anyone else or by just invoking a deity or believing in any outside power or influence.&lt;ref name=Malekar&gt;Malekar, Ezekiel Isaac. "THE SPEAKING TREE: Concept of Salvation In Judaism". ''The Times of India''. [http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2004-11-20/edit-page/27150861_1_redemption-salvation-jews] Accessed: 4 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|The Jewish concept of Messiah visualises the return of the prophet Elijah as the harbinger of one who will redeem the world from war and suffering, leading mankind to universal brotherhood under the fatherhood of one God. The Messiah is not considered as a future divine or supernatural being but as a dominating human influence in an age of universal peace, characterised by the spiritual regeneration of humanity.

In Judaism, salvation is open to all people and not limited to those of the Jewish faith; the only important consideration being that the people must observe and practise the ethical pattern of behaviour as summarised in the Ten Commandments. When Jews refer to themselves as the chosen people of God, they do not imply they have been chosen for special favours and privileges but rather they have taken it upon themselves to show to all peoples by precept and example the ethical way of life.&lt;ref name=Malekar/&gt;}}

When examining Jewish intellectual sources throughout history, there is clearly a spectrum of opinions regarding death versus the [[afterlife]]. Possibly an over-simplification, one source says salvation can be achieved in the following manner: Live a holy and righteous life dedicated to [[Yahweh]], the God of Creation. Fast, worship, and celebrate during the appropriate holidays.&lt;ref&gt;"How do I achieve salvation according to Judaism?"{{cite web |url=http://religions.findthedata.org/q/2/1475/How-do-I-achieve-salvation-according-to-Judaism |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130704012232/http://religions.findthedata.org/q/2/1475/How-do-I-achieve-salvation-according-to-Judaism |archivedate=2013-07-04 |df= }} Accessed: 4 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
By origin and nature, Judaism is an ethnic religion. Therefore, salvation has been primarily conceived in terms of the destiny of Israel as the elect people of Yahweh (often referred to as “the Lord”), the [[God in Judaism|God of Israel]].&lt;ref name=EBJ/&gt; In the biblical text of Psalms, there is a description of death, when people go into the earth or the "realm of the dead" and cannot praise God. The first reference to resurrection is collective in [[Ezekiel]]'s vision of the dry bones, when all the Israelites in exile will be resurrected. There is a reference to individual resurrection in the [[Book of Daniel]] (165 BCE), the last book of the Hebrew Bible.&lt;ref name=Krell&gt;Krell, Marc A. "Afterlife and Salvation". ''Religion Library: Judaism''. [http://www.patheos.com/Library/Judaism/Beliefs/Afterlife-and-Salvation.html] Accessed 4 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the 2nd century BCE that there arose a belief in an [[afterlife]], in which the dead would be resurrected and undergo divine judgment. Before that time, the individual had to be content that his posterity continued within the holy nation.&lt;ref name=EBJ/&gt;

The salvation of the individual Jew was connected to the salvation of the entire people. This belief stemmed directly from the teachings of the [[Torah]]. In the Torah, God taught his people sanctification of the individual. However, he also expected them to function together (spiritually) and be accountable to one another. The concept of salvation was tied to that of restoration for Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yashanet.com/studies/romstudy/rom2.htm|title=Jewish views of salvation, faith and freedom|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|During the Second Temple Period, the Sadducees, High Priests, denied any particular existence of individuals after death because it wasn't written in the Torah, while the Pharisees, ancestors of the rabbis, affirmed both bodily resurrection and immortality of the soul, most likely based on the influence of Hellenistic ideas about body and soul and the Pharisaic belief in the Oral Torah. The Pharisees maintained that after death, the soul is connected to God until the messianic era when it is rejoined with the body in the land of Israel at the time of resurrection.&lt;ref name=Krell/&gt;}}

Christianity’s primary premise is that the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnation]] and death of [[Jesus Christ]] formed the climax of a divine plan for humanity’s salvation. This plan was conceived by God consequent on [[Fall of Man|the Fall]] of Adam, the progenitor of the human race, and it would be completed at the [[Last Judgment]], when the [[Second Coming of Christ]] would mark the catastrophic end of the world.&lt;ref name=EBC&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/115240/Christianity] Accessed 4 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

For Christianity, salvation is only possible through Jesus Christ. Christians believe that Jesus' death on the cross was the once-for-all sacrifice that atoned for the sin of humanity.&lt;ref name=EBC/&gt;

The Christian religion, though not the exclusive possessor of the idea of redemption, has given to it a special definiteness and a dominant position. Taken in its widest sense, as deliverance from dangers and ills in general, most religions teach some form of it. It assumes an important position, however, only when the ills in question form part of a great system against which human power is helpless.&lt;ref&gt;"Redemption."

This is perhaps ''the'' non-negotiable item of Christian faith. What has been a matter of debate is the relation between salvation and our activities in the world."|Anselm Kyongsuk Min&lt;ref name="Min"&gt;Min, Anselm Kyongsuk.

{{Quote|"The Bible presents salvation in the form of a story that describes the outworking of God's eternal plan to deal with the problem of human sin. The story is set against the background of the history of God's people and reaches its climax in the person and work of Christ. The Old Testament part of the story shows that people are sinners by nature, and describes a series of covenants by which God sets people free and makes promises to them. His plan includes the promise of blessing for all nations through Abraham and the redemption of Israel from every form of bondage. God showed his saving power throughout Israel's history, but he also spoke about a Messianic figure who would save all people from the power, guilt, and penalty of sin. This role was fulfilled by Jesus, who will ultimately destroy all the devil's work, including suffering, pain, and death."|''Macmillan Dictionary of the Bible.''}}

Variant views on salvation are among the main fault lines dividing the various [[Christian denomination]]s, both between [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] and [[Protestantism]] and within Protestantism, notably in the [[History of Calvinist–Arminian debate|Calvinist–Arminian debate]], and the fault lines include conflicting definitions of [[Total depravity|depravity]], [[Predestination#Christianity|predestination]], [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]], but most pointedly [[Justification (theology)|justification]].
[[File:Are you saved - bumper sticker.png|thumb|A bumper sticker asking if one has found salvation]]
Salvation is believed to be a process that begins when a person first becomes a Christian, continues through that person's life, and is completed when they stand [[Last judgment|before Christ in judgment]]. Therefore, according to Catholic apologist James Akin, the faithful Christian can say in faith and hope, "I ''have been'' saved; I ''am being'' saved; and I ''will be'' saved."&lt;ref&gt;Akin, James. "The Salvation Controversy." ''Catholic Answers,'' October 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian salvation concepts are varied and complicated by certain theological concepts, traditional beliefs, and [[dogmas]]. Scripture is subject to individual and ecclesiastical interpretations. While some of the differences are as widespread as Christianity itself, the overwhelming majority agrees that salvation is made possible by the work of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, dying on the cross.

The purpose of salvation is debated, but in general most [[Christian theology|Christian theologians]] agree that God devised and implemented his plan of salvation because [[Love of God|he loves them]] and regards human beings as his children. Since human existence on Earth is said to be "given to sin",{{bibleref2c|Jn|8:34}} salvation also has connotations that deal with the [[liberty|liberation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Salvation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of human beings from sin, and the [[suffering]] associated with the [[punishment]] of sin—i.e., "the [[Epistle to the Romans|wages of sin]] are [[Soul death|death]]."{{bibleref2c|Rom.|6:23}}

Christians believe that salvation depends on the [[Grace (Christianity)|grace]] of God. Stagg writes that a fact assumed throughout the Bible is that humanity is in, "serious trouble from which we need deliverance…. The fact of sin as the human predicament is implied in the mission of Jesus, and it is explicitly affirmed in that connection". By its nature, salvation must answer to the plight of humankind as it actually is. Each individual's plight as sinner is the result of a fatal choice involving the whole person in bondage, guilt, estrangement, and death. Therefore, salvation must be concerned with the total person. "It must offer [[redemption (theology)|redemption]] from bondage, forgiveness for guilt, reconciliation for estrangement, renewal for the marred image of God".&lt;ref&gt;Stagg, Frank. ''New Testament Theology''. Broadman Press, 1962. {{ISBN|0-8054-1613-7}}. pp.11-13,80&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mormonism====
{{Main|Plan of salvation (Latter Day Saints)}}
According to doctrine of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], the plan of salvation is a plan that [[God]] created to save, redeem, and [[Exaltation (Mormonism)|exalt]] [[humankind]]. The elements of this plan are drawn from various sources, including the [[Bible]],&lt;ref&gt;See for example {{Biblesource | Matthew| 13:43| KJV | ref=yes}}, {{Biblesource |John| 14:2 | ref=yes}},{{Biblesource |2 Corinthians| 12:2 | ref=yes}}, {{Biblesource |1 Corinthians|15:40-41 | ref=yes}}, {{Biblesource |Genesis|2:4-5 | ref=yes}}, {{Biblesource |Genesis|2:7 | ref=yes}}, {{Biblesource |Job|38:4 | ref=yes}}, {{Biblesource |Ecclesiastes|12:7 | ref=yes}}, {{Biblesource |Jeremiah|1:5 | ref=yes}}, {{Biblesource |Zechariah|12:1 | ref=yes}}, and {{Biblesource |Hebrews|12:9 | ref=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Book of Mormon]], [[Doctrine &amp; Covenants]], [[Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism)|Pearl of Great Price]], and numerous statements made by the leadership of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church). The first appearance of the graphical representation of the plan of salvation is in the 1952 missionary manual entitled ''A Systematic Program for Teaching the Gospel.''&lt;ref&gt;https://rsc.byu.edu/archived/go-ye-all-world/missionary-training-and-practices/5-missionary-materials-and-methods#_edn69&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
{{See also|Islam|Jannah}}

In Islam, salvation refers to the eventual entrance to heaven. Islam teaches that people who die disbelieving in God do not receive salvation. It also teaches that non-Muslims who die believing in the God but disbelieving in his message (Islam), are left to his will. Those who die believing in the One God and his message (Islam) receive salvation.&lt;ref&gt;''The Facts On Islam'', By John Ankerberg, John Weldon, Dillon Burroughs, p.37 [https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=B_hndUQ1_40C&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq=salvation+islam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jdTIT4l-weo5_snwCA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=salvation%20islam&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

Narrated Anas that Muhammad said,
{{quote|Whoever said "None has the right to be worshipped but Allah" and has in his heart good (faith) equal to the weight of a barley grain will be taken out of Hell. And whoever said, "None has the right to be worshipped but Allah" and has in his heart good (faith) equal to the weight of a wheat grain will be taken out of Hell. And whoever said, "None has the right to be worshipped but Allah" and has in his heart good (faith) equal to the weight of an atom will be taken out of Hell.|Muhammad {{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|1|2|43}}}}

Islam teaches that all who enter into Islam must remain so in order to receive salvation.
{{quote|"If anyone desires a religion other than Islam (submission to Allah), never will it be accepted of him; and in the Hereafter He will be in the ranks of those who have lost (all spiritual good)."| Quran, sura 3 ([[Al Imran]]), [[ayat]] 85|source = }}

For those who have not been granted Islam or to whom the message has not been brought;
{{quote|Those who believe (in the Qur'an), those who follow the Jewish (scriptures), and the Sabians and the Christians,- any who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and work righteousness,- on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve."
-&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/005-qmt.php#005.069|title=Center for Muslim-Jewish Engagement|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170917/http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/005-qmt.php#005.069|archivedate=2015-05-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Tawhid====
{{See also|Tawhid|Shirk (Islam)}}

Belief in the “One God”, also known as the ''[[Tawhid]]'' (التَوْحيدْ) in Arabic, consists of two parts (or principles):
# Tawḥīdu r-Rubūbiyya ( تَوْحيدُ الرُبوبِيَّة): Believing in the attributes of God and attributing them to no other but God. Such attributes include Creation, having no beginning, and having no end. These attributes are what make a God. Islam also teaches 99 names for God, and each of these names defines one attribute. One breaks this principle, for example, by believing in an Idol as an intercessor to God. The idol, in this case, is thought of having powers that only God should have, thereby breaking this part of Tawheed. No intercession is required to communicate with, or worship, God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|2|186|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Tawḥīdu l-'ulūhiyya (تَوْحيدُ الأُلوهيَّة): Directing worship, prayer, or deed to God, and God only. For example, worshiping an idol or any saint or prophet is also considered Shirk, though prophets and saints may be asked for guidance or to pray for them.

====Sin and repentance====
{{See also|Repentance in Islam|Islamic views on sin}}
Islam also stresses that in order to gain salvation, one must also avoid sinning along with performing good deeds. Islam acknowledges the inclination of humanity towards sin.&lt;ref name="cite quran|3|85|s=ns"&gt;{{cite quran|3|85|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|12|51|e=53|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Muslims are constantly commanded to seek God's forgiveness and repent. Islam teaches that no one can gain salvation simply by virtue of their belief or deeds, instead it is the Mercy of God, which merits them salvation.&lt;ref&gt;''Answering Islam: The Crescent in Light of the Cross'', by Norman L. Geisler, Abdul Saleeb, p.128 [https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=jB1SNwAM_FQC&amp;pg=PA128&amp;dq=salvation+islam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jdTIT4l-weo5_snwCA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=salvation%20islam&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; However, this repentance must not be used to sin any further. Islam teaches that God is Merciful.

{{quote| Allah accepts the repentance of those who do evil in ignorance and repent soon afterwards; to them will Allah turn in mercy: For Allah is full of knowledge and wisdom. Of no effect is the repentance of those who continue to do evil, until death faces one of them, and he says, "Now have I repented indeed;" nor of those who die rejecting Faith: for them have We prepared a punishment most grievous.| Qur'an, sura 4 ([[An-Nisa]]), [[ayat]] 17 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|4|17|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|Allah forgiveth not that partners should be set up with Him; but He forgiveth anything else, to whom He pleaseth; to set up partners with Allah is to devise a sin Most heinous indeed.|Qur'an, sura 4 ([[An-Nisa]]), [[ayat]] 48 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|4|48|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Islam describes a true believer to have [[Love of God]] and [[Taqwa|Fear of God]]. Islam also teaches that every person is responsible for their own sins. The Quran states;

{{quote| If ye reject (Allah), Truly Allah hath no need of you; but He liketh not ingratitude from His servants: if ye are grateful, He is pleased with you. No bearer of burdens can bear the burden of another. In the end, to your Lord is your Return, when He will tell you the truth of all that ye did (in this life). for He knoweth well all that is in (men's) hearts.| Qur'an, sura 39 ([[Az-Zumar]]), [[ayat]] 7 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|39|7|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Al-Agharr al-Muzani, a companion of Mohammad, reported that Ibn 'Umar stated to him that Mohammad said,

{{quote|O people, seek repentance from Allah. Verily, I seek repentance from Him a hundred times a day. |Prophet Mohammad {{hadith-usc|usc=yes|muslim|35|6523}}}}

Sin in Islam is not a state, but an action (a bad deed); Islam teaches that a child is born sinless, regardless of the belief of his parents, dies a Muslim; he enters heaven, and does not enter hell. {{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|2|23|467}}

{{quote|Narrated Aisha, that Mohammad said, "Do good deeds properly, sincerely and moderately, and receive good news because one's good deeds will not make him enter Paradise." They asked, "Even you, O Allah's Apostle?" He said, "Even I, unless and until Allah bestows His pardon and Mercy on me." {{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|8|76|474}}}}

====Five Pillars====
{{main article|Five Pillars of Islam}}
There are acts of worship that Islam teaches to be mandatory. Islam is built on five principles. Narrated Ibn 'Umar that Muhammad said,
{{quote|Islam is based on (the following) five (principles):

# To [[Shahada|testify]] that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is Allah's Apostle.
# To offer the [[salat|compulsory prayers]] dutifully and perfectly.
# To pay [[Zakat]] to poor and needy (i.e. obligatory charity of 2.5% annually of surplus wealth).
# To perform [[Hajj]]. (i.e. Pilgrimage to Mecca)
# To [[Sawm|observe fast]] during the month of Ramadhan. {{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|1|2|7}}}}

Not performing the mandatory acts of worship may deprive Muslims of the chance of salvation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=p-NBqOkvfoEC&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=salvation+islam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jdTIT4l-weo5_snwCA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=salvation%20islam&amp;f=false|title=Fast Facts® on Islam|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Indian religions ==
{{Main article|Moksha|Nirvana}}

[[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Sikhism]] share certain key concepts, which are interpreted differently by different groups and individuals.{{sfn|Sherma|Sarma|2008|p=239}} In these religions one is not liberated from sin and its consequences, but from the ''[[saṃsāra]]'' (cycle of rebirth) perpetuated by passions and delusions and its resulting [[karma]].{{sfn|Tiwari|1983|p=210}} They differ however on the exact nature of this liberation.{{sfn|Tiwari|1983|p=210}} Salvation is called ''[[moksha]]''{{sfn|Tiwari|1983|p=210}} or ''mukti'' which mean liberation and release respectively. This state and the conditions considered necessary for its realization is described in early texts of Indian religion such as the [[Upanishads]] and the [[Pāli Canon]], and later texts such the [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]] and the [[Vedanta]] tradition.{{sfn|Sherma|Sarma|2008}} ''Moksha'' can be attained by [[sādhanā]], literally "means of accomplishing something".&lt;ref&gt;V. S. Apte. ''A Practical Sanskrit Dictionary''. p. 979.&lt;/ref&gt; It includes a variety of disciplines, such as [[yoga]] and [[meditation]].

[[Nirvana]] is the profound peace of mind that is acquired with [[moksha]] (liberation). In [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]], it is the state of being free from [[suffering]]. In [[Hindu philosophy]], it is union with the [[Brahman]] ([[Supreme Being#Hinduism|Supreme Being]]). The word literally means "blown out" (as in a candle) and refers, in the Buddhist context, to the blowing out of the fires of desire, aversion, and delusion,&lt;ref name="Gombrich" /&gt;{{sfn|Snelling|1987}} and the imperturbable stillness of mind acquired thereafter.&lt;ref name="Gombrich"&gt;[[Richard Gombrich]], ''Theravada Buddhism: A Social History from Ancient Benāres to Modern Colombo.'' Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Theravada Buddhism]] the emphasis is on one's own liberation from samsara.{{sfn|Snelling|1987}} The [[Mahayana]] traditions emphasize the [[bodhisattva]] path,{{sfn|Snelling|1987}} in which "each Buddha and Bodhisattva is a redeemer", assisting the Buddhist in seeking to achieve the redemptive state.&lt;ref name="JE"&gt;Joseph Edkins, ''Chinese Buddhism'' (1893), p. 364.&lt;/ref&gt; The assistance rendered is a form of self-sacrifice on the part of the teachers, who would presumably be able to achieve total detachment from worldly concerns, but have instead chosen to remain engaged in the material world to the degree that this is necessary to assist others in achieving such detachment.&lt;ref name="JE"/&gt;

===Jainism===
{{Main article|Moksha (Jainism)}}
In [[Jainism]], ''salvation'', ''moksa'' and ''nirvana'' are one and the same.&lt;ref name=pjaini&gt;{{cite book | last =Jaini | first =Padmanabh | title =Collected Papers on Jaina Studies | publisher =Motilal Banarsidass Publ. | year =2000 | location =Delhi | isbn =81-208-1691-9 }}: ''"Moksa and Nirvana are synonymous in Jainism".'' p.168&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Carrithers, Caroline Humphrey (1991) ''The Assembly of listeners: Jains in society'' Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0521365058}}: ''"Nirvana: A synonym for liberation, release, moksa."'' p.297&lt;/ref&gt;  When a soul (''atman'') achieves moksa, it is released from the cycle of births and deaths, and achieves its pure self. It then becomes a ''[[siddha]]'' (literally means one who has accomplished his ultimate objective). Attaining Moksa requires annihilation of all ''[[Karma in Jainism|karmas]]'', good and bad, because if karma is left, it must bear fruit.

'''Vakkom Mohammed Abdul Khader Moulavi''' ({{birth date|df=yes|1873|12|28}} - {{death date|df=yes|1932|10|31}}) , popularly known as ''Vakkom Moulavi''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=S. M.

He was the founder and publisher of the newspaper ''[[Swadeshabhimani(newspaper)|Swadeshabhimani]]'' which was banned and confiscated by the Government of Travancore in 1910 due to its criticisms against the government and the [[Diwan (title)|Diwan]] of Travancore, [[Perungavur Rajagopalachari|P.Rajagopalachari]].&lt;ref name="india9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Keralawindow"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://keralawindow.net/imp_v.htm|title=VAKKOM MOULAVI|accessdate=20 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EndeNaadukadathal"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ramakrishna Pillai|title=Ende Naadukadathal|publisher=D C Books/ Current Books, Kottayam|date=1911|edition=5 (2007)|isbn=81-264-1222-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="islamicvoice"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamicvoice.com/october.2001/community.htm#vak|title=Vakkom Complex Opened|accessdate=24 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keralapromoter.com/wikiped/kerala-poets-and-writers.html|title=Kerala poets and writers|accessdate=24 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csesindia.org/admin/modules/cms/docs/publication/19.pdf|title=WHEN THE KERALA MODEL OF DEVELOPMENT IS HISTORICISED|author=P.K.

==Early life and family==
{{Main|Poonthran}}
Moulavi was born in 1873 in [[Vakkom]], [[Chirayinkil (Lok Sabha constituency)|Chirayinkil]] Taluk, [[Thiruvananthapuram]] in Travancore. He was born into a prominent Muslim family [[Poonthran]] which had ancestral roots to [[Madurai]] and [[Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh|Hyderabad]], and many of his maternal ancestors worked for the military of the state government.

His father, a prominent merchant, engaged a number of scholars from distant places, including an itinerant Arab savant, to teach him every subject he wished to learn. Moulavi made such rapid progress, that some of his teachers soon found that their stock of knowledge was exhausted and at least one of them admitted that had learnt from his student more than he could teach him. In a short time, Moulavi had learnt many languages including Arabic, Persian, Urdu, Tamil, Sanskrit and English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vmft.org/category/documents/on-vakkom-moulavi/articles-on-moulavi/|title=Articles on Vakkom Moulavi |accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1900s, Moulavi was married to Haleema, daughter of Aliyar Kunju Poonthran Vilakom and Pathumma Kayalpuram. Moulavi - Haleema couple had one son Abdul Salam. Haleema died soon after the birth of their first child. A year later, Moulavi married Aamina Ummal. The couple had ten children, includes Abdul Hai, Abdul Vahab, Abdul Khader Jr. Abdul Haque, Obaidullah, Ameena, Yahiya, Sakeena, [[Mohammed Eeza]] and Mohammed Iqbal. His sons, Abdul Salam, Abdul Vahab and Mohammed Eeza were writers and scholars of Islamic studies, and Abdul Khader Jr was a writer, literary critic and journalist. One of his nephews, [[Vakkom Majeed]], was an Indian freedom fighter and a former member of [[Travancore-Cochin]] State Assembly and another nephew, [[P.Habeeb Mohamed]], was the first Muslim judge of the Travancore High Court of Kerala. His disciples included K.M Seethi Sahib, the former Speaker of Kerala Legislative Assembly and a social reformer among kerala Muslims.

==Journalism and Swadeshabhimani==
{{See also|Swadeshabhimani (newspaper)}}
Maulavi started the ''[[Swadeshabhimani(newspaper)|Swadeshabhimani]]'' newspaper on 19 January 1905, declaring that '''the paper will not hesitate to expose injustices to the people in any form''', but on 26 September 1910, the newspaper and press were sealed and confiscated by the British Police, and the editor [[Swadeshabhimani Ramakrishna Pillai|Ramakrishna Pillai]] was arrested and banished from Travancore to [[Thirunelveli]].&lt;ref name="Keralawindow"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EndeNaadukadathal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="prdkerala"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prd.kerala.gov.in/literacycriticmwesternifluence.htm|title=Literary Criticism: Western Influence|publisher=PRD, Kerala Government|accessdate=20 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= M. J. Koshy|title=Constitutionalism in Travancore and Cochin|publisher=Kerala Historical Society|date=1972|pages=18, 19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=K. Balachandran Nayar|title=In Quest of Kerala|publisher=Accent Publications|date=1974|pages=65,160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the confiscation of the press, Moulavi concentrated more on social and cultural activities, becoming a social leader,&lt;ref name="Keralawindow"/&gt; also writing several books. ''Daussabah'' and ''Islam Matha Sidantha Samgraham'' are original works, while ''Imam Ghazali's Keemiya-e- Saadat'', ''Ahlu Sunnathuwal Jammath'', ''Islamic Sandesam'', ''Surat-ul fathiha'' are translations.&lt;ref name="islamicvoice" /&gt;

==Social Reformation==

Moulavi is considered as one of the greatest reformers in the Kerala Muslim community, and is sometimes referred to as the "father of muslim renaissance".&lt;ref name="proceedings"/&gt; He emphasised the religious and socioeconomic aspects much more than the ritualistic aspects of religion. He also campaigned for the need for modern education, the education of women, and the elimination of potentially bad customs among the Muslim community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.education.kerala.gov.in/englishmedium/historyeng/chapter9.pdf|title=Leaders of Renaissance ( Social Studies Textbook,Standard X,)|publisher=Department of School Education, Government of Kerala|accessdate=24 November 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217193847/http://www.education.kerala.gov.in/englishmedium/historyeng/chapter9.pdf|archive-date=17 December 2008|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Influenced by the writings of [[Muhammad Abduh]] of Egypt and his reform movement, Moulavi started journals in [[Arabi-Malayalam]] and in [[Malayalam]] modelled on [[al-Manar (journal)|Al Manar]].&lt;ref&gt;Pg 67, Islam in Kerala: groups and movements in the 20th century- M. Abdul Samad,Laurel Publications, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=K M Bahauddin|title=Kerala Muslims: The Long Struggle|publisher=Sahitya Pravarthaka Cooperative Society ; Modern Book Centre|date=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Muslim'' was launched in January 1906 and was followed by ''Al-Islam''(1918) and ''Deepika''(1931). Through these publications, he tried to teach the Muslim community about the basic tenets of Islam. ''Al-Islam'' began publishing in April 1918 and played a pivotal role in Muslim renaissance in Kerala. It opposed ''Nercha''s and [[Urs|Uroos]] festivals amongst the Muslim community, thereby attracting opposition from the orthodox [[ulema]] to the extent that they issued a [[fatwa]] declaring the reading of it as sacrilege. Financial troubles and lack of readership led to the closure of the journal within five issues, but it is regarded as the pioneer journal that attempted religious reform amongst the [[Mappila]]s of Kerala. While it was published in [[Malayalam]] language using [[Arabi-Malayalam]] script, ''Muslim'' and ''Deepika'' used [[Malayalam]] in script also.&lt;ref name="proceedings"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_RBuAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Arabi-Malayalam%22+%22al-islam%22 Pg 239, Pg 345 – Proceedings of the 19th Annual conference, South India History Congress, 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pg 134, Journal of Kerala studies, Volume 17,University of Kerala.,1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Malayalam Literary Survey|publisher=Kēraḷa Sāhitya Akkādami|date=1984|pages=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the continuous campaigning of Moulavi throughout the State, the Maharaja's Government introduced the teaching of Arabic in all state schools where there were Muslim pupils, and offered them fee concessions and scholarships. Girls were totally exempted from payment of fees. Moulavi wrote text books for children to learn Arabic, and a manual for training Arabic instructors for primary schools. At the instance of Moulavi Abdul Qadir the State Government soon instituted qualifying examinations for Arabic teachers of which he was made the chief examiner.&lt;ref name="UM"&gt;Pg 36, Pg 56–58,Educational empowerment of Kerala Muslims: a socio-historical perspective By U. Mohammed, Other Books, Kozhikode&lt;/ref&gt;

There were many other dubious practices in the Muslim community of the time, such as the dowry system, extravagant expenditure on weddings, celebration of annual "urs" and Moharrum with bizarre unIslamic features bordering on idolatrous rituals. Moulavi launched his campaign against such practices with the help of his disciples, and with the co-operation of other learned men who shared his views and ideals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=A.

Some issued "[[fatwas]]" that he was a "[[kafir]]", others branded him as a "[[Wahhabi]]".{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

He also tried to create unity among Muslims, starting the ''All Travancore Muslim Mahajanasabha''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1==Asanaru Abdul Salim|author2= Salim, P R Gopinathan Nair|title=Educational Development in India|publisher=Anmol Publications PVT. LTD.|date=2002|pages=23|isbn=9788126110391}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Chirayinkil Taluk Muslim Samajam'', and worked as the chairman of the Muslim Board of the Government of Travancore. His activities were further instrumental in the establishment of "Muslim Aikya Sangham", a united Muslim forum in Eriyad, Kodungalloor for all the Muslims of the Travancore, Cochin and Malabar regions,with K M Moulavi, K M Seethi Sahib, Manappat Kunju Mohammed Haji and helped guide the Lajnathul Mohammadiyya Association of Alappuzha, Dharma Bhoshini Sabha of Kollam amongst others.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}
In 1931, he founded the ''Islamia Publishing House'', with his eldest son Abdul Salam supervising the translation into Malayalam and publication of Allama Shibli's biography of Omar Farooq in two volumes under the title ''Al Farooq''.

==Last days==
In ''Deepika'', he serialised the Malayalam translation of the [[Quran]], together with his brief commentary and the original text written in an elegant calligraphic style by Moulavi himself. It was his life's ambition to produce a translation of the Quran in Malayalam with his own commentary, but he died on 23 August 1932 aged 59 before the work was completed.

==Vakkom Moulavi Foundation Trust (VMFT)==
The Vakkom Moulavi Foundation Trust (VMFT) is intended to be a lasting memorial to Vakkom Moulavi. Dr N. A. Karim, former Pro-Vice-Chancellor of Kerala University is the President of the Trust and Er.A.Suhair is the chairman and Managing Trustee.

==Vakkom Moulavi Centre for Studies and Research ==

[[Vedic Sanskrit]] is the [[Indo-Aryan language]] used in the religious hymns known as the [[Vedas]], composed from the early-to-mid 2nd millennium through to the mid 1st millennium, BCE. It was a spoken language during that period. Its grammar differs in certain respects from the grammar of the later Classical [[Sanskrit]].

==Grammar==
[[File:ANCIENT_SANSKRIT_ON_HEMP_BASED_PAPER._HEMP_WAS_A_COMMON_AND_DURABLE_FIBRE_IN_THE_PRODUCTION_OF_%22RAG%22_PAPER_FROM_200_BCE_TO_THE_1850_AD.jpg|right|thumb|Ancient Sanskrit on hemp-based paper. Hemp fiber was commonly used in the production of paper from 200 BCE to the late 1800s.]]
Compared with [[Sanskrit|Classical Sanskrit]], [[Vedic]] had a [[subjunctive mood]] absent in [[Pāṇini]]'s grammar and generally believed to have disappeared by then at least in common sentence constructions. All tenses could be conjugated in the subjunctive and [[optative mood]]s, in contrast to Classical Sanskrit, with no subjunctive and only a present optative. However, the old first-person subjunctive forms were used to complete the Classical Sanskrit imperative. The three [[Synthetic language|synthetic]] past tenses ([[imperfect]], [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]] and [[aorist]]) were still clearly distinguished semantically in (at least the earliest) Vedic. A fifth mood, the [[Injunctive mood|injunctive]], also existed.

Long-''i'' stems differentiate the [[Devi and Vrkis feminines]], a difference lost in Classical Sanskrit.

*The [[subjunctive mood]] of Vedic was also lost in Classical Sanskrit. Also, there was no fixed rule about the use of various tenses {{transl|sa|(''luṇ, laṇ'' and ''liṭ'')}}.
*There were more than 12 ways of forming [[infinitive]]s in Vedic, of which Classical Sanskrit retained only one form.
*Nominal declinations and verbal conjugation also changed pronunciation, although the spelling was mostly retained in Classical Sanskrit. E.g., along with the Classical Sanskrit's declension of ''deva-'' as {{transl|sa|''devaḥ''—''devau''—''devāḥ''}}, Vedic additionally allowed the forms {{transl|sa|''daivaḥ''—''daivā''—''daivāsaḥ''}}. Similarly Vedic has declined forms such as ''asmai'', ''tvai'', {{transl|sa|''yuṣmai''}}, ''tvā'', etc. for the first and second person pronouns, not found in Classical Sanskrit. The obvious reason is the attempt of Classical Sanskrit to regularize and standardize its grammar, which simultaneously led to a purge of older [[Proto-Indo-European language#Verb|Proto-Indo-European forms]].
*To emphasize that Proto-Indo-European and its immediate daughters were essentially end-inflected languages, both Proto-Indo-European and Vedic had independent prefix-morphemes. Such prefixes (especially for verbs) could come anywhere in the sentence, but in Classical Sanskrit, it became mandatory to attach them immediately before the verb.

==Morphology==

===Nouns===
Vedic is a highly [[inflection|inflected]] language with three [[grammatical gender]]s (masculine, feminine, neuter) and three numbers (singular, plural, [[dual grammatical number|dual]]). It has eight [[Grammatical case|cases]]: [[Nominative case|nominative]], [[Vocative case|vocative]], [[Accusative case|accusative]], [[Instrumental case|instrumental]], [[Dative case|dative]], [[Ablative case|ablative]], [[Genitive case|genitive]], and [[Locative case|locative]].

In this article nouns are divided into five declensions. The declension which a noun belongs to is determined largely by form.

====The basic declension suffix scheme for nouns and adjectives====
The basic scheme is given in the table below — valid for almost all nouns and adjectives. However, according to the gender and the ending consonant/vowel of the uninflected word-stem, there are predetermined rules of compulsory ''sandhi'' which would then give the final inflected word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=MacDonell |first1=Arthur Anthony |title=A Vedic Grammar for Students |date=1916 |publisher=The Clarendon Press |location=Oxford |page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====a-stems====
A-stems ({{IPA|[a]}} and {{IPA|[ɑː]}}) (also known as thematic stems) comprise the largest class of nouns. As a rule, nouns belonging to this class, with the uninflected stem ending in short-a ({{IPA|[a]}}), are either masculine or neuter. Nouns ending in long-ā ({{IPA|[ɑː]}}) are almost always feminine. A-stem adjectives take the masculine and neuter in short-a ({{IPA|[a]}}), and feminine in long-ā ({{IPA|[ɑː]}}) in their stems. This class is so big because it also comprises the Proto-Indo-European o-stems.

===Compounds===
One other notable feature of the nominal system is the very common use of nominal compounds, which may be huge (10+ words) as in some modern languages such as [[German language|German]]. Nominal compounds occur with various structures, however morphologically speaking they are essentially the same. Each noun (or adjective) is in its (weak) stem form, with only the final element receiving case inflection. Some examples of nominal compounds include:

; [[Dvandva]] (co-ordinative)
: These consist of two or more [[noun]] stems, connected in sense with 'and'. There are mainly two kinds of ''dvandva'' constructions in Sanskrit. The first is called ''itaraitara dvandva'', an enumerative compound word, the meaning of which refers to all its constituent members. The resultant compound word is in the dual or plural number and takes the gender of the final member in the compound construction. e.g. ''{{IAST|rāma-lakṣmaṇāu}}'' – Rama and Lakshmana, or ''{{IAST|rāma-lakṣmaṇa-bharata-śatrughnāh}}'' – Rama, Lakshmana, Bharata and Satrughna. The second kind is called ''samāhāra dvandva'', a collective compound word, the meaning of which refers to the collection of its constituent members. The resultant compound word is in the singular number and is always neuter in gender. e.g. ''{{IAST|pāṇipādam}}'' – limbs, literally hands and feet, from ''{{IAST|pāṇi}}'' 'hand' and ''pāda'' 'foot'. According to some grammarians, there is a third kind of dvandva, called ''{{IAST|aikaśaiṣa dvandva}}'' or residual compound, which takes the dual (or plural) form of only its final constituent member, e.g. ''pitarau'' for mātā + pitā, mother + father, i.e. parents. According to other grammarians, however, the ''{{IAST|aikaśaiṣa}}'' is not properly a compound at all.
; [[Bahuvrīhi]] (possessive)
: Bahuvrīhi, or "much-rice", denotes a rich person—one who has much rice. Bahuvrīhi compounds refer (by example) to a compound noun with no head -- a compound noun that refers to a thing which is itself not part of the compound. For example, "low-life" and "block-head" are bahuvrihi compounds, since a low-life is not a kind of life, and a block-head is not a kind of head. (And a much-rice is not a kind of rice.) Compare with more common, headed, compound nouns like "fly-ball" (a kind of ball) or "alley cat" (a kind of cat). Bahurvrīhis can often be translated by "possessing..." or "-ed"; for example, "possessing much rice", or "much riced".
; [[Tatpurusha|{{transl|sa|Tatpuruṣa}}]] (determinative)
: There are many {{transl|sa|tatpuruṣas}} (one for each of the nominal cases, and a few others besides); in a {{transl|sa|tatpuruṣa}}, the first component is in a case relationship with another. For example, a doghouse is a dative compound, a house ''for'' a dog. It would be called a "{{transl|sa|caturthitatpuruṣa}}" (caturthi refers to the fourth case—that is, the dative). Incidentally, "{{transl|sa|tatpuruṣa}}" is a {{transl|sa|tatpuruṣa}} ("his man"—meaning someone's agent), while "{{transl|sa|caturthitatpuruṣa}}" is a karmadhārya, being both dative, and a {{transl|sa|tatpuruṣa}}. An easy way to understand it is to look at English examples of {{transl|sa|tatpuruṣas}}: "battlefield", where there is a genitive relationship between "field" and "battle", "a field of battle"; other examples include instrumental relationships ("thunderstruck") and locative relationships ("towndwelling").
; [[Karmadhāraya]] (descriptive)
: The relation of the first member to the last is appositional, attributive or adverbial, e. g. uluka-yatu (owl+demon) is a demon in the shape of an owl.
; [[Amredita|{{transl|sa|Amraiḍita}}]] (iterative)
: Repetition of a word expresses repetitiveness, e. g. ''dinai dinai'' 'day by day', 'day after day', 'daily'.
; [[Dvigu]]

===Personal pronouns and determiners===
The first and second person pronouns are declined for the most part alike, having by [[analogy]] assimilated themselves with one another.

Note: Where two forms are given, the second is [[enclitic]] and an alternative form. Ablatives in singular and plural may be extended by the syllable ''-tas''; thus ''mat'' or ''mattas'', ''asmat'' or ''asmattas''.

===Verbs===

====Classification of verbs====
Sanskrit has ten classes of [[verb]]s divided into two broad groups: [[athematic]] and [[Vowel stem|thematic]]. The thematic verbs are so called because an ''a'', called the [[theme vowel]], is inserted between the stem and the ending. This serves to make the thematic verbs generally more regular. [[Exponent (linguistics)|Exponents]] used in verb [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] include [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefix]]es, [[suffix]]es, [[infix]]es, and [[reduplication]]. Every root has (not necessarily all distinct) zero, [[guna|{{transl|sa|guṇa}}]], and [[vrddhi|{{transl|sa|vṛddhi}}]] grades. If V is the vowel of the zero grade, the {{transl|sa|guṇa}}-grade vowel is traditionally thought of as a + V, and the {{transl|sa|vṛddhi}}-grade vowel as ā + V.

====Tense systems====
The verbs [[Grammatical tense|tenses]] (a very inexact application of the word, since more distinctions than simply tense are expressed) are organized into four 'systems' (as well as [[gerund]]s and [[infinitive]]s, and such creatures as [[intensive]]s/[[frequentative]]s, [[desiderative]]s, [[causative]]s, and [[benedictive]]s derived from more basic forms) based on the different stem forms (derived from verbal roots) used in conjugation. There are four tense systems:
* Present ([[Present tense|Present]], [[Imperfect]], [[Imperative mood|Imperative]], [[Optative mood|Optative]])
* [[perfect (grammar)|Perfect]]
* [[Aorist]]
* [[Future]] ([[Future tense|Future]], [[Conditional mood|Conditional]])

=====Present system=====
The present system includes the [[present tense]], the [[imperfect]], and the [[optative mood|optative]] and [[imperative mood|imperative]] moods, as well as some of the remnant forms of the old [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]]. The tense stem of the present system is formed in various ways. The numbers are the native grammarians' numbers for these classes.

For thematic verbs, the present tense stem may be formed through:
* 1. Suffixation of the thematic vowel ''a'' with {{transl|sa|guṇa}} strengthening, for example, ''bháva-'' from ''bhū'' 'be', ''bhara-'' from ''{{IAST|bhṛ}}'' ({{transl|sa|guṇa}} form ''bhar-'') 'bring'.
* 6. Suffixation of the thematic vowel ''a'' with a shift of accent to this vowel, for example ''tudá-'' from ''tud'' 'thrust'.
* 4. Suffixation of ''ya'', for example ''dī́	vya-'' from ''div'' 'play', ''paśya-'' from ''pś'' 'see'.

For athematic verbs, the present tense stem may be formed through:
* 2. No modification at all, for example ''ad-'' from ''ad'' 'eat'.
* 3. Reduplication prefixed to the root, for example ''juhu-'' from ''hu'' 'sacrifice', ''dadhā-'' from ''dhā'' 'put'.
* 7. Infixion of ''ná'' or ''n'' before the final root consonant (with appropriate sandhi changes), for example ''rundh-'' or ''{{transl|sa|ruṇadh-}}'' from ''rudh'' 'obstruct', ''yunaj-'' from ''yuj'' 'join' (''yunakti'' 'he joins').
* 5. Suffixation of ''nu'' ({{transl|sa|guṇa}} form ''náu''), for example ''sunu-'' from ''su'' 'press out', ''{{IAST|stṛnau-}}'' from ''{{IAST|stṛ}}'' 'strew' (''{{IAST|stṛnumas}}'' 'we strew', ''{{IAST|stṛnvanti}}'' 'they strew').
* 8. Suffixation of ''u'' ({{transl|sa|guṇa}} form ''au''), for example ''tanu-'' from ''tan'' 'stretch'. For modern linguistic purposes it is better treated as a subclass of the 5th. ''tanu-'' derives from ''tnnu-'', which is zero-grade for *''tannu-'', because in the [[Proto-Indo-European language]] [m] and [n] could be vowels (i.e. [am], [an]), which in Sanskrit (and Greek) change to [a]. Most members of the 8th class arose this way; ''kar-'' 'make, do' was 5th class in Vedic (''krnauti'' 'he makes'), but shifted to the 8th class in Classical Sanskrit (''karauti'' 'he makes')
* 9. Suffixation of ''nā'' (zero-grade ''nī'' or ''n''), for example ''{{transl|sa|krīṇa-}}'' or ''{{transl|sa|krīṇī-}}'' from ''krī'' 'buy', ''pūna-'' from ''pū'' 'clean'.
* 10. This class described by native grammarians refers to a process which is derivational in nature, and thus not a true tense-stem formation. It is formed by suffixation of ''ya'' with {{transl|sa|guṇa}} or {{transl|sa|vṛddhi}} strengthening and lengthening of the root's last vowel, for example ''bhāvaya-'' (&lt; ''bāu-a-ya-'') from ''bhū'' 'be', ''pūjaya-'' from ''pūj'' 'honour', ''cauraya-'' from ''cur'' ({{transl|sa|guṇa}} form ''caur-'') 'steal', ''dāvaya-'' from ''du'' ({{transl|sa|vṛddhi}} form ''dāv-'') 'burn'.

The present system also differentiates strong and weak forms of the verb. The strong/weak opposition manifests itself differently depending on the class:
*The root and reduplicating classes (2 &amp; 3) are not modified in the weak forms, and receive {{transl|sa|guṇa}} in the strong forms.
*The nasal class (7) is not modified in the weak form, extends the nasal to ''ná'' in the strong form.
*The nu-class (5) has ''nu'' in the weak form and ''náu'' in the strong form.
*The nā-class (9) has ''nī'' in the weak form and ''nā́	'' in the strong form. ''nī'' disappears before vocalic endings.

=====Perfect system=====
The [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]] is only used in the indicative. The stem is formed with reduplication as with the present system.

The perfect system also produces separate "strong" and "weak" forms of the verb — the strong form is used with the singular active, and the weak form with the rest.

The perfect in the Sanskrit can be in form of the simple perfect and the periphrastic perfect. The only perfect is in the indicative. The simple perfect is the most common form and can be made from most of the roots. The simple perfect stem is made by reduplication and if necessary by stem lengthening. The conjugated form takes special perfect endings. The periphrastic perfect is used with causative, desiderative, denominative and roots with prosodic long anlauted vowel (except a/ā). Only few roots can form both the simple and the periphrastic perfect. These are ''{{IAST|bhṛ}}'' 'carry', ''{{IAST|uṣ}}'' 'burn', ''vid'' 'know', ''bhi'' 'to be afraid', ''hu'' 'sacrifice'.

=====Aorist system=====
The [[aorist]] system includes aorist proper (with past indicative meaning, e.g. ''abhūs'' 'you were') and some of the forms of the ancient injunctive (used almost exclusively with ''mā'' in prohibitions, e.g. ''mā bhūs'' 'don't be'). The principal distinction of the two is presence/absence of an augment – ''a-'' prefixed to the stem.

The aorist system stem actually has three different formations: the simple aorist, the reduplicating aorist (semantically related to the causative verb), and the sibilant aorist. The simple aorist is taken directly from the root stem (e.g. ''bhū-'': ''a-bhū-t'' 'he was'). The reduplicating aorist involves reduplication as well as [[vowel reduction]] of the stem. The sibilant aorist is formed with the suffixation of ''s'' to the stem. The sibilant aorist by itself has four formations:
* athematic s-aorist
* athematic {{transl|sa|iṣ}}-aorist
* athematic {{transl|sa|siṣ}}-aorist
* thematic s-aorist

=====Future system=====
The future system is formed with the suffixation of ''-sya-'' or ''{{transl|sa|-iṣya-}}'' and {{transl|sa|guṇa}}, both in the simple future and conditional. There exists also so called [[periphrastic]] future, which is made by adding suffix ''{{transl|sa|tṝ}}'' to the stem and the short ''as'' 'to be' form.

====Conjugation====
Each verb has a [[grammatical voice]], whether active, passive or middle. There is also an impersonal voice, which can be described as the passive voice of intransitive verbs. Sanskrit verbs have an [[indicative mood|indicative]], an [[optative mood|optative]] and an [[imperative mood]]. Older forms of the language had a [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]], though this had fallen out of use by the time of Classical Sanskrit.

=====Basic conjugational endings=====
Conjugational endings in Vedic convey [[Grammatical person|person]], [[Grammatical number|number]], and [[Grammatical voice|voice]]. Different forms of the endings are used depending on what tense stem and mood they are attached to. Verb stems or the endings themselves may be changed or obscured by sandhi.

Primary endings are used with present indicative and future forms. Secondary endings are used with the imperfect, conditional, aorist, and optative. Perfect, imperative and subjunctive endings are used with the perfect, imperative and subjunctive respectively.

In present and imperfect indicative singular active forms have the accent on the stem and take strong forms, while the other forms have the accent on the endings and take weak forms.

In imperative accent is variable and affects vowel quality. Forms which are end-accented trigger {{transl|sa|guṇa}} strengthening, and those with stem accent do not have the vowel affected.

The [[Passive voice]] forms for all tenses and moods are made by adding ''-ya-'' to the zero-grade stem and then adding the middle voice ending of appropriate tense and mood.

The [[Causative]] is made by adding the suffix ''aya'' to the {{transl|sa|vṛddhi}} form. For example, ''karauti'' 'he does/makes', and ''kārayati'' 'he lets do/make'.

The [[Desiderative]] is made by reduplication of the root and the suffix ''sa''. For example, ''karauti'' 'he does, makes', and ''{{IAST|cikīrṣati}}'' 'he wishes to do/make'. It can be also combined with causative, e.g. ''kārayati'' 'he lets do' and ''{{IAST|cikārayiṣati}}'' 'he wishes to let to do'.

The [[Intensive]] (or sometimes called [[Frequentative]]) describes a repeated or particularly intensive activity. With verbs of the movement it means "back and forth". The intensive is formed by reduplication of the root and the suffix ''ya'' with middle endings for thematic stems, and without suffix and active endings for athematic stems. For example, ''bhramati'' 'it curves around', and ''{{IAST|baṃbhramyatai}}'' 'it curves cross and crosswise around'.

'''Vijaygupta Maurya '''({{lang-gu|વિજયગુપ્ત મૌર્ય}}) was a pioneer science writer in [[Gujarati Language|Gujarati]]. He wrote thousands of articles popularising science as well as several books.

==Life==
===Early life===
Vijaygupta Maurya was born as Vijayshankar Morarji Vasu ({{lang-gu|વિજયશંકર મુરારજી વાસુ}}) in [[Porbandar]], Gujarat in 1909. He completed his high school education at Bhavsingh High School in Porbandar, India. He studied law in Mumbai, India and returned to Porbandar in 1933 to start his law practice. Four years later he took a position as judge in a British court. However, due to his passion for bird watching he wrote regular articles for ''Prakruti'' ({{lang-gu|પ્રકૃત્તિ}}) magazine on birds&lt;ref name=db&gt;{{cite news|last=Khambhayata|first=Lalit|title=વિજયગુપ્ત મૌર્ય જીવંત જ્ઞાનકોષને શતાબ્દિવંદન!
|url=http://www.divyabhaskar.co.in/article/100222160042_vijaygupt_maurya.html|accessdate=24 October 2012|newspaper=[[Divya Bhaskar]]|date=22 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944, the freedom fighter in British India named Dr. Vasant Avsare ({{lang-gu|ડૉ. વસંત અવસરે}}) came to Porbandar and asked Vijaygupta Maurya to fight for his case. However, as Vijaygupta Maurya was already at the position of judge, he could not do so. This prompted Vijaygupta Maurya to resign from his position and took Dr. Avsare's case as a regular lawyer. This ended Vijaygupta Maurya's career as judge and he decided to stay in Mumbai. He found a job as a typist for the salary of Rs. 0.75 per month at ''Gordhandas ni Pedhi'' ({{lang-gu|ગોરધનદાસ શેઠની પેઢી}}).&lt;ref name=hp&gt;Pushkarna, Harshal. [http://harshalpushkarna.blogspot.com/2009/03/vijaygupta-maurya.html "Vijaygupta Maurya"], ''{{lang-gu|એક નજર આ તરફ...}}'', 22 March 2009, accessed 7 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="db"/&gt;

===Career as Journalist and Writer===
In between financial struggles he kept writing for Prakruti magazine. After a few years, he got an opportunity to write for the Gujarati newspaper ''[[Janmabhumi]]''. He started writing articles about birds and other animals for the last page of ''Janambhumi Pravasi'' with limited space and eventually grew to become editor/writer of entire page and wrote on varied subjects from the universe, science, marine life, plant life and so on.&lt;ref name="hp"/&gt;

===Later years===
In 1973, he left ''Janmabhumi Pravasi'' and became a freelance journalist writing for various magazines. He also wrote several books during that time that included the theme of serving interesting factual information rolled up in stories as well as other books based on true stories. His career as a writer spanned over 46 years, however it didn't help him much financially. During later years he encountered several physical problems including poor vision, continuous back pain and [[Parkinson's disease]]. After a long illness he died in July 1992.&lt;ref name="hp"/&gt;

==Family==
His sons, [[Nagendra Vijay]] and Bhardvaj Vijay, has accepted similar goals and career as their father. Nagendra Vijay started writing at the age of 14 and pioneered the first Gujarati science magazine Scope and later [[Safari magazine]]. His grandson, [[Harshal Pushkarna]], has also continued work on spreading science and knowledge by currently running [[Safari magazine]].&lt;ref name="db"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21586">A '''wildland–urban interface''' (or WUI) is a zone of transition between unoccupied land and human development. Communities that are within {{convert|0.5|mi|km}} of the zone may also be included.  These lands and communities adjacent to and surrounded by [[wildland]]s are at risk of [[wildfire]]s.

==Definitions==
[[File:Wildland Urban Interface Catalonia.jpg|thumb|right|Map of the wildland-urban interface in Catalonia featuring intermix and interface zones.]]
The [[US Forest Service]] defines the wildland-urban interface as the place where "homes and wildlands meet or intermingle", or more specifically, where "humans and their development meet or intermix with wildland fuel".&lt;ref name="USDAFS"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stein|first1=Susan M.|last2=Comas|first2=Sara J.|last3=Menakis|first3=James P.|last4=Steward|first4=Susan I.|last5=Cleveland|first5=Helene|last6=Bramwell|first6=Lincoln|last7=Radeloff|first7=Volker|title=Wildfire, Wildlands, and People: Understanding and Preparing for Wildfire in the Wildland-Urban Interface|url=https://www.fs.fed.us/openspace/fote/reports/GTR-299.pdf|website=USDA Forest Service|publisher=USDA|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more quantitative definition is provided by the [[Federal Register]], which defines WUI areas as those containing at least one housing unit per 40 acres. Federal Register definitions can be combined with quantitative criteria to classify the WUI into two categories:

* Intermix WUI, or lands that contain at least one housing unit per 40 acres in which vegetation occupies at least 50% of terrestrial area, and
* Interface WUI, or lands that contain at least one housing unit per 40 acres, contain less than 50% vegetation, and lie within 2.4 km of a heavily vegetated area.
** A "heavily vegetated area" is defined as an area containing over 75% wildlife vegetation and occupies at least 5 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of terrestrial area.

The main difference between these types of WUI are that homes in intermix WUI are interspersed with vegetation, whereas homes in interface WUI are adjacent to heavy vegetation.&lt;ref name="Radeloff"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Radeloff|first1=V. C.|last2=Hammer|first2=R. B.|last3=Stewart|first3=S. I.|last4=Fried|first4=J. S.|last5=Holcomb|first5=S. S.|last6=McKeefry|first6=J.

==WUI growth and causes==

From 1990 to 2000, WUI area in the United States increased by 18 percent, covering 6 million additional homes. As of 2013, it was reported that the number of wildfires in the United States exceeding 50,000 acres had been steadily increasing since 1983, with the bulk of the change occurring from 2003 to 2013. The intensity of these fires was found to be increasing as well, contributing to an observed increase in costs related to reducing fire risks, fighting wildfires, and protecting property.&lt;ref name="USDAFS"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; WUI growth has also been noted in other places throughout the world, including Argentina, France, South Africa, Australia, and Mediterranean regions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=SYPHARD|first=ALEXANDRA D.|last2=RADELOFF|first2=VOLKER C.|last3=HAWBAKER|first3=TODD J.|last4=STEWART|first4=SUSAN I.|date=January 16, 2009|title=Conservation Threats Due to Human-Caused Increases in Fire Frequency in Mediterranean-Climate Ecosystems|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2009.01223.x|journal=Conservation Biology|language=en|volume=23|issue=3|pages=758–769|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2009.01223.x|issn=0888-8892|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Radeloff|first=Volker C.|last2=Helmers|first2=David P.|last3=Kramer|first3=H.

===Population shifts===
Factors behind WUI growth include population growth, housing growth in wildland areas, population shifts, and the expansion of cities into wildlands. In the United States, WUI growth is partially attributed to population shifts towards the West and South. Additionally, as of 2013, the migration of retiring [[baby-boomers]] to smaller communities closer to scenic natural resources (“amenity migration”) is expected to contribute to WUI growth as well.&lt;ref name="USDAFS"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1990 and 2010, the WUI was the fastest-growing land use type in the United States, and 97% of new WUI areas were the result of new housing rather than increases in wildlife vegetation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Ecological factors===

Keane, et al. attribute the increase in WUI area to ecological factors such as climate change, insect pests, and diseases, which have resulted in more arid and flammable landscapes.&lt;ref name="Keane Eco"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keane|first1=Robert E.|last2=Agee|first2=James K.|last3=Fulé|first3=Peter|last4=Keeley|first4=Jon E.|last5=Key|first5=Carl|last6=Kitchen|first6=Stanley G.|last7=Miller|first7=Richard|last8=Schulte|first8=Lisa A.|title=Ecological effects of large fires on US landscapes: benefit or catastrophe?|journal=International Journal of Wildland Fire|date=2008|volume=17|pages=696-712|url=http://oregonstate.edu/dept/eoarc/sites/default/files/publication/617.pdf|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climate change can result in significant shifts in wildlife composition due to changes in temperature and precipitation.&lt;ref name="Keane Climate"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keane|first1=Robert E.|last2=Holsinger|first2=Lisa M.|last3=Parsons|first3=Russell A.|last4=Gray|first4=Kathy|date=2008|title=Climate change effects on historical range and variability of two large landscapes in western Montana, USA|url=https://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs_other/rmrs_2008_keane_r001.pdf|journal=Forest Ecology and Management|volume=254|pages=375-389|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Population shifts can result in unintended ecological consequences resulting in higher landscape flammability. For example, flammable materials present in housing serve as a direct means of wildfire spread, while landscaping can cause non-native species to spread.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

To a small degree, vegetation growth into or near settled areas can lead to WUI growth. Between 1990 and 2010, vegetation growth accounted for 3% of all WUI growth in the United States.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Impact on environment ===
Environmental issues related to WUI growth extend beyond the increased risk of wildfire damage to human settlements. For example, housing growth in WUI regions can displace and fragment native vegetation. Additionally, the introduction of non-native species by humans through landscaping can change the wildlife composition of interface regions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Other factors can also have impacts on the environment, including pets which can kill large quantities of wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Loss|first=Scott R.|last2=Will|first2=Tom|last3=Marra|first3=Peter P.|date=2013-01-29|title=The impact of free-ranging domestic cats on wildlife of the United States|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms2380|journal=Nature Communications|language=En|volume=4|issue=1|doi=10.1038/ncomms2380|issn=2041-1723}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forest fragmentation is another impact of WUI growth, which can lead to unintended ecological consequences. For instance, increased forest fragmentation can lead to an increase in the prevalence of Lyme disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brownstein|first=John S.|last2=Skelly|first2=David K.|last3=Holford|first3=Theodore R.|last4=Fish|first4=Durland|date=2005-09-27|title=Forest fragmentation predicts local scale heterogeneity of Lyme disease risk|url=https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00442-005-0251-9|journal=Oecologia|language=en|volume=146|issue=3|pages=469–475|doi=10.1007/s00442-005-0251-9|issn=0029-8549}}&lt;/ref&gt; One possible reason for this effect is the production of high-density isolated populations of transmission vectors such as ticks and mice. Isolated forest patches in fragmented environments tend to be surrounded by unfavorable habitats, which hinders the dispersal of infected species and increases their local density. Additionally, disease vectors in isolated patches can undergo genetic differentiation, increasing their survivability as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simon|first=Julie A.|last2=Marrotte|first2=Robby R.|last3=Desrosiers|first3=Nathalie|last4=Fiset|first4=Jessica|last5=Gaitan|first5=Jorge|last6=Gonzalez|first6=Andrew|last7=Koffi|first7=Jules K.|last8=Lapointe|first8=Francois-Joseph|last9=Leighton|first9=Patrick A.|date=2014-05-07|title=Climate change and habitat fragmentation drive the occurrence ofBorrelia burgdorferi, the agent of Lyme disease, at the northeastern limit of its distribution|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/eva.12165|journal=Evolutionary Applications|language=en|volume=7|issue=7|pages=750–764|doi=10.1111/eva.12165|issn=1752-4571|pmc=4227856|pmid=25469157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increases in wildfire risk pose a threat to conservation in WUI growth regions. Between 1985-94 and 2005-14, the area burned by wildfires in the United States nearly doubled from 18,000 to 33,000 square kilometers, and this increase can partly be attributed to WUI growth.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In North America, Chile, and Australia, unnaturally high fire frequencies have resulted in incidences of exotic annual grasses replacing native shrublands.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Wildfire Risk Assessment==

As of 2013, 32 percent of homes, apartments, and other human dwellings in the United States are contained within the WUI, and this figure is expected to grow over time. Wildfires can pose a risk to any area containing vegetation, as embers transported by wind can ignite fires a mile or more away from a flame front.&lt;ref name="USDAFS" /&gt; The increase in wildfire prevalence in the United States between 1985-94 and 2005-14 resulted in a tripling of federal wildfire suppression expenditures from $0.4 billion per year to $1.4 billion per year, indicating that wildfires pose a potent economic risk to communities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Identification of high-risk areas===
Geospatial quantification of wildfire risk can highlight key areas for policy and emergency response planning. Several factors are used to assess the threat wildfires pose to human settlements. These factors can mainly be divided into ecological factors (e.g. climate, seasonal weather patterns, and vegetation) and human factors (e.g. arrangement and density of housing). Quantitative risk assessments can be produced by combining data such as the probability of large wildfires, estimated wildfire intensity, population density, and the proximity of human settlements to roads. One approach, used by Haas et al., combines geographical data on population density and probability of exposure to a large wildfire to produce maps that highlight spatial variability in wildfire risk. The highest-risk areas identified by this method are those where moderate population levels overlap with or are adjacent to wildlands with high chances of wildfire exposure.&lt;ref name="Haas"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haas|first1=Jessica R.|last2=Calkin|first2=David E.|last3=Thompson|first3=Matthew P.|date=2013|title=A national approach for integrating wildfire simulation modeling into Wildland Urban Interface risk assessments within the United States|url=https://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs_other/rmrs_2013_haas_j001.pdf|journal=Landscape and Urban Planning|volume=119|pages=44-53|doi=10.1016/j.landurbplan.2013.06.011|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Effect of population density on wildfire risk ====
Population density correlates with wildfire risk for two main reasons. First, people can cause fires; from 2001 to 2011, 85% of wildfires recorded by National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) were caused by people. Second, housing can intensify wildfires because they can potentially contain highly flammable material such wood shakes, and can be a source for mobile embers which can cause wildfires to spread.&lt;ref name="USDAFS" /&gt;

The relationship between population density and wildfire risk is non-linear. At low population densities, human ignitions are low, and ignitions increase with population density. However, in a range of environments sampled from North America, the Mediterranean Basin, Chile, and South Africa, a threshold of population density was observed at which fire occurrence decreased. Possible reasons for this decrease include decreases in open space for ember transmission, fuel fragmentation due to urban development, and higher availability of fire-suppression resources. For this reason, areas with moderate population densities tend to exhibit higher wildfire risk than areas with low or high population densities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Wildfire simulation modeling===
Some factors typically used in wildfire simulations include historical spatial wildfire data, geographic features, geographical distributions of vegetation, and climate.&lt;ref name="Keane Climate" /&gt; One algorithm commonly used to simulate wildfire spread are Minimum Travel Time (MTT) algorithms.&lt;ref name="Haas"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to MTT algorithms, fire boundaries were primarily modeled through the application of [[Huygens–Fresnel principle|Huygens' principle]] by treating boundaries as wave fronts on a two-dimensional surface. MTT algorithms are capable of calculating fire perimeters in a nearly-equivalent way finding the minimum time it takes for a fire to travel between two points, and are advantageous due to their speed and scalability. However, MTT methods come at the cost of assuming nearly-constant environmental conditions such as wind direction and fuel moisture dynamics, and thus tend to be more apt for short-timescale simulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Finney|first=Mark A|date=August 2002|title=Fire growth using minimum travel time methods|url=http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/10.1139/x02-068|journal=Canadian Journal of Forest Research|volume=32|issue=8|pages=1420–1424|doi=10.1139/x02-068|issn=0045-5067|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risk Management==
The vulnerability of a community to wildfires is partly determined by its decisions regarding land use, building standards, and landscaping choices. Community-focused risk management efforts often focused on reducing the flammability of dwellings and wildland vegetation in and around high-risk areas.&lt;ref name="USDAFS"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Distribution of responsibilities ===
[[File:Fire Adapted Communities infographic.jpg|thumb|287x287px|By distributing wildfire management responsibilities, communities can mitigate risks.]]
Calkin, et al. present a conceptual framework for risk mitigation in the WUI. In this model, two major objectives that lead to decreased home loss are (a) reducing the probability of home exposure to wildfires and (b) reducing the susceptibility of houses to wildfire loss. The former can be split into three actionable objectives: reducing wildfire occurrence, reducing wildfire size and intensity, and reducing human development in fire-prone areas. The latter can be converted into a single actionable objective, i.e. increasing home resistance to ignition. In the framework, responsibility for actions is attributed to three major groups: land management agencies, local governments, and homeowners. Land management agencies can help reduce wildfire occurrence through ignition prevention, and can help reduce wildfire size and intensity through fuel and vegetation management, building community preparedness, and responding to wildfires with suppression efforts. Local governments can help reduce human development in fire-proof areas through proper land use management and zoning. Individual homeowners can also reduce the risk of home loss by taking action to manage the flammability of their homes.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Calkin|first=David E.|last2=Cohen|first2=Jack D.|last3=Finney|first3=Mark A.|last4=Thompson|first4=Matthew P.|date=2014-01-14|title=How risk management can prevent future wildfire disasters in the wildland-urban interface|url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1315088111|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=111|issue=2|pages=746–751|doi=10.1073/pnas.1315088111|pmc=3896199|pmid=24344292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Community response ====
{{See also|Fire-adapted communities}}
One approach to mitigating fire risk is adapting communities to adapt to fire risks rather than escalate prevention efforts. Fire-adapted communities are defined by the United States Forest Service as "a knowledgeable and engaged community in which the awareness and actions of residents regarding infrastructure, buildings, landscaping, and the surrounding ecosystem lessens the need for extensive protection actions and enables the community to safely accept fire as a part of the surrounding landscape." Fostering the development of a fire-adapted community can help save resources for local and federal governments by reducing the amount of resources needed for fire mitigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fs.fed.us/fire/prev_ed/fac/faqs.pdf|title=Frequently Asked Questions – Fire Adapted Communities|last=|first=|date=July 10, 2014|website=USDA Forest Service Fire and Aviation Management|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171001135211/https://www.fs.fed.us/fire/prev_ed/fac/faqs.pdf|archive-date=October 1, 2017|dead-url=|access-date=June 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ways homeowners can reduce risk ===
The susceptibility of a home to ignition is determined by its home ignition zone (HIZ), or the home and its surrounding area up to 100-200 feet. Individual homeowners can use the following guidelines to determine what areas of their home can be improved to mitigate fire risk:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dnr.wi.gov/files/pdf/pubs/fr/fr0474.pdf|title=Home Ignition Zone Self Assessment for Homeowners|last=|first=|date=2011|website=Firewise Wisconsin|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180430183553/https://dnr.wi.gov/files/pdf/pubs/fr/fr0474.pdf|archive-date=April 30, 2018|dead-url=|access-date=June 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Ways to make a house fire-resistant:
** Ensure that the house's roof is made of fire-resistant materials and all exterior walls are fire resistant.
** Enclose eaves and vents with wire mesh.
** Ensure that decks and porches are made of fire-resistant materials.
* Guidelines for landscaping:
** Keep vegetation away from windows, as windows can break during a fire and let in embers.
** Ensure plants within 3-5 feet of the home are low-growing, well-maintained and [[deciduous]].
** Keep bare dirt, mowed grass, or non-combustible mulch in a "no-grow" zone within 3-5 feet of the home.
** Limit the presence of evergreens (which are highly flammable) within 30 feet of the home.
** Keep vegetation thin within 30 to 100 feet of the home.
* Guidelines for outdoor maintenance:
** Trim back tree limbs at least 10 feet from roof.
** Ensure power lines are away from tree branches and nearby dead or dying trees.
** Clean off fallen leaves, pine needles, and other debris from roof, gutters, window wells, and underneath decks.
** Prune tree branches 6 feet up from ground (especially [[Evergreen|evergreens]]).
** Keep lawn mowed, green, and free of leaf litter and needles.
** Ensure yard is free of dead trees and shrubs.
* Ways to keep flammables at a safe distance:
** Ensure outbuildings within 30 feet of homes or other buildings are clear of flammables.
** Store firewood and other flammable materials at least 30 feet from buildings.
** Clear the area 10 feet surrounding propane tanks or fuel oil tanks.

=== Challenges to risk management ===
Wildfires are an ecological process that naturally contribute to the development of ecosystems, and many wildlands are historically predisposed to periodic fire. Because of this, complete eradication of fires in WUI regions is typically not feasible. Additionally, wildfires are capable of spreading through far distances, presenting logistical challenges to wildfire management efforts. At a governmental level, communities that have developed within or near fire-prone areas typically vary widely in terms of wildfire risk and preparedness, which can confound coordination efforts. Lastly, a mismatch between the reality of wildfire risk and sociopolitical expectations of wildland fire management services may lead to challenges to strategic risk management.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The '''Zan languages''', or '''Zanuri''' ({{lang-ka|ზანური ენები}}), are a branch of the [[Kartvelian languages]] constituted by the [[Mingrelian language|Mingrelian]] and [[Laz language|Laz]] languages. Some linguists consider both to be members dialects of the same, Zan, language. However, Mingrelian and Laz are not completely mutually intelligible, though speakers of one language can recognize many words of the other.  

The term ''Zan'' comes from the [[Greco-Roman]] name of one of the chief Colchian tribes, which is almost identical to the name given to the [[Mingrelian people|Mingrelians]] by the [[Svan people|Svans]] (a northwestern Kartvelian group).
Georgian linguist [[Akaki Shanidze]] proposed the name "Colchian" for Zan.

==History==
According to a [[Glottochronology|glottochronological]] analysis by [[Georgi Klimov|G. Klimov]], the Zan languages had split from the [[Proto-Kartvelian language|Common Kartvelian group]] by about the 8th century BC. Zan  was spoken by a continuous community stretching along the Black Sea coast, from modern day [[Trabzon]], [[Turkey]] into western [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].

In the mid-7th century AD, Zan speakers were split by intrusions of Georgian-speaking peoples from [[Caucasian Iberia|Iberia]] ([[eastern Georgia]]), driven by the [[Muslim conquests|Arabs]], who took over the regions of [[Imereti]], [[Guria]], and [[Adjara]].

Separated by geography, and later by politics and religion, northern and southern Zan eventually diverged into Mingrelian and Laz. Since the differentiation was basically complete by early modern times, it is not customary to speak of a unified Zan language today. Presently, Mingrelian is spoken by the [[Mingrelian people|Mingrelians]] primarily in [[Mingrelia]] (northwest Georgia) and [[Abkhazia]], whereas Laz is spoken by the [[Laz people]] in Turkey (and in a small portion of Adjara, southwestern Georgia).
