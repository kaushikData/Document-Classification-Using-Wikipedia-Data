The '''1982 Commonwealth Games''' were held in [[Brisbane]], [[Queensland]], [[Australia]] from 30 September to 9 October 1982. The [[1982 Commonwealth Games Opening Ceremony|Opening Ceremony]] was held at the [[Queensland Sport and Athletics Centre|QEII Stadium]] (named for [[Elizabeth II]]), in the Brisbane suburb of [[Nathan, Queensland|Nathan]]. The QEII Stadium was also the venue which was used for the [[Athletics (sport)|athletics]] and [[archery]] competitions during the Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austadiums.com/stadiums/stadiums.php?id=5 |title=Queensland Sport and Athletic Centre |website=Austadiums.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other events were held at the purpose-built [[Sleeman Centre (Brisbane)|Sleeman Sports Complex]] in [[Chandler, Queensland|Chandler]].

The Chairman of the 1982 Commonwealth Games was [[Edward Williams (Queensland judge)|Sir Edward Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Commemorating the life of Sir Edward Williams |url=http://www.sclqld.org.au/schp/exhibitions/williams/brisbane_ambassador.htm |work=2004 |publisher=Supreme Court of Queensland Library |accessdate=7 December 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720110052/http://www.sclqld.org.au/schp/exhibitions/williams/brisbane_ambassador.htm |archivedate=20 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1982 Commonwealth Games Logo was designed by Paulo Ferreira,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commonwealthgames.org.au/GamesInfo/PastGames/1982/Logo.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050622091040/http://www.commonwealthgames.org.au/GamesInfo/PastGames/1982/Logo.htm |archivedate=22 June 2005 |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was the winner of a nationwide competition held in 1978. The symbol is derived from the form of a bounding kangaroo. The three bands, forming stylized A's (for Australia), are in colours which are common to flags of many Commonwealth countries.

Matilda the [[kangaroo]] [[mascot]] for the 1982 Commonwealth Games was represented by a cartoon kangaroo,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commonwealthgames.org.au/GamesInfo/PastGames/1982/Mascot.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050622091126/http://www.commonwealthgames.org.au/GamesInfo/PastGames/1982/Mascot.htm |archivedate=22 June 2005 |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a gigantic 13-metre (42 feet 8&amp;nbsp;inches) high mechanical "[[wink]]ing" [[kangaroo]], who travelled around the stadium and [[wink]]ed at the crowd.

The games were officially opened by [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|The Duke of Edinburgh]] and closed by [[Elizabeth II|The Queen]].

==Host selection==
Bidding for the XII Commonwealth Games was held in [[Montreal]], [[Canada]] at the [[1976 Summer Olympics]]. [[Lagos]], [[Brisbane]], [[Kuala Lumpur]] and [[Birmingham]] were the bidding cities. On 14 July 1976 it was announced that Brisbane had won the rights to stage the Games&lt;ref name="shap"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Shaping a city |last=Cole |first=John R. |year=1984 |publisher=William Brooks Queensland |location=Albion, Queensland |isbn=0-85568-619-7 |pages=350–353}}&lt;/ref&gt; after the other candidate cities withdrew bids earlier that year.

Brisbane was awarded by default of being the only Candidate City left at the bid election after Birmingham reversed its decision to submit an application.&lt;ref name="shap"/&gt; Nigeria's boycott of the Montreal Summer Olympics made Lagos' bid lobbying impractical.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} The Montreal Summer Olympics were plagued with cost overruns and bidding on a sports festival anywhere in the world was not good politically.

==Highlights==

===Opening Ceremony (30 September)===
{{Main|1982 Commonwealth Games opening ceremony}}

The ceremony at the [[Queensland Sport and Athletics Centre|QEII Stadium]] was held on a fine but extremely windy day.  The wind was so strong that skydivers who were going to descend into the stadium were cancelled.&lt;ref name="cgc"/&gt;  Instead they made an entrance at the closing ceremony.

===Day 1 (1 October)===
The first event of the Games was {{convert|100|km|mi}} Road Trial in cycling. [[England]] won the [[Gold Medal]] in the event, and Australia won the [[Silver Medal]]&amp;mdash;coming second to England by only six seconds.

Other sports which were contested on the first day of competition included swimming and diving, weightlifting, shooting and bowls.

===Day 2 (2 October)===
Sports contested included swimming, diving, weightlifting, shooting, cycling, bowls and archery.

The day was marred by both [[Australia]] and [[Canada]] being disqualified in the 4 × 100 metres relay in swimming, both problems occurring during change-overs. The medals awarded for this race went to [[England]], [[Scotland]] and New Zealand.

===Day 4 (4 October)===
Sports contested included swimming, diving, cycling, athletics, archery, hammer throwing and shooting.

The day was marred when Canada was again disqualified, this time in the 4 × 200 metres freestyle relay. Canada protested against the winners, Australia, as well as against their own disqualification.

===Closing Ceremony===
[[Elizabeth II]] closed the Games during a colourful ceremony, which included parachute jumpers (who had originally been also intended as part of the Opening Ceremony display) jumping and landing in a special target area within the stadium and red, white and blue balloons. Matilda the Kangaroo also winked at the Queen. Following the closing of the Games, the Queen and Duke left the stand to be driven from the stadium. However, nobody wanted the Games to end and the Australian team formed a 'guard of honour' and ran beside and behind the car in which Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip were travelling, as it circled the stadium several times before finally leaving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/could-the-gold-coast-ever-beat-brisbanes-games-20111110-1n9f6.html |title=Could the Gold Coast ever beat Brisbane's Games? |website=Brisbanetimes.com.au |date=2011-11-11 |accessdate=2016-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Team members from other countries also joined in running after the royal car.

==Medals by country==
This is the full table of the '''medal count''' of the '''1982 Commonwealth Games'''. These rankings sort by the number of gold medals earned by a country. The number of silvers is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze. If, after the above, countries are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically. This follows the system used by the [[IOC]], [[IAAF]] and [[BBC]].

== Aboriginal movement protests ==
The Brisbane Commonwealth Games were also noted by large-scale protests by the [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] rights movement in Australia, which brought to the centre of international media attention the lack of [[Aboriginal title|land rights]], poor living condition and suppression of personal and political rights in Queensland in particular, and in Australia as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer Reiss with Carl Robinson, "Aborigines Vs. Queensland", Newsweek: International Edition, 11 October 1982, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; The protests, which were followed by large-scale arrests, are a significant event in the history of the Australian Aboriginal movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Foley|first1=Gary|title=A Short History of the Australian Indigenous Resistance 1950 - 1990|url=http://www.kooriweb.org/foley/resources/pdfs/pdf_files.html|website=The Koori History Website|accessdate=12 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Matilda mascot from the opening ceremony was relocated to [[Wet'n'Wild Gold Coast|Wet'n'Wild Water World]], a water park in the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] hinterland. Unfortunately, in 2007, Matilda lay out the back of Wet'n'Wild in pieces, until 2011, when the winking icon found a new home at the back of the [[Kybong, Queensland|Kybong]] Matilda fuel station (now a [[Puma Energy]] station), near [[Gympie]], and has been thrilling visitors and locals with her impressive stature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Peters |first=Daniel |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3184575/Should-Matilda-bring-wink-Iconic-giant-kangaroo-mascot-1982-Commonwealth-Games-overlooks-nondescript-servo-make-comeback-games-return-Queensland-2018.html |title='Winking Matilda' from 1982 Commonwealth Games sits outside a service station &amp;#124; Daily Mail Online |website=Dailymail.co.uk |date=2015-08-04 |accessdate=2016-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''''Aa Harimanada'''''|ああ播磨灘}} is a Japanese media franchise that began with a 1991 manga by [[Kei Sadayasu]] published in [[Kodansha]]'s ''[[Weekly Morning]]''. An anime television series was broadcast in 1992. The series was later adapted to a [[video game]] developed and published by [[Sega]] for the [[Sega Game Gear]] and [[Sega Mega Drive]]. A port was also released on the [[Game Boy]], released by ASK.

==Premise==
On the first day of the September Professional Sumo Tournament, the new ''yokozuna'' Harimanada enters the ring wearing an eerie mask, surprising the audience. He then declares that he will break [[Futabayama Sadaji|Futabayama]]'s streak of 69 consecutive wins, and that he would retire on the spot if he loses even once. This invokes the wrath of the [[Japan Sumo Association]] and makes an enemy of all ''[[makuuchi]]'' wrestlers.

===Characters===
;Isao Harimanada (播磨灘勲 (はりまなだ いさお)) / Isao Yamagata (山形勲 (やまがた いさお)
:Voiced by [[Akio Ōtsuka]]
:The protagonist. Stands at 6'0" and weighs 335 pounds.

;Raikō (雷光 (らいこう)
:Voiced by [[Kenichi Ogata (voice actor)|Kenichi Ogata]]
:Harimanada's master.

;Atagoyama (愛宕山 (あたごやま)

==Media==
E&amp;G Film produced an anime television series based on the manga, titled {{nihongo|'''''It Makes Me Feel Strong When I Watch It! Yokozuna Anime: Aah! Harimanada'''''|見ると強くなる 痛快!横綱アニメ ああ播磨灘|Miru to Tsuyoku Naru Tsūkai! Yokozuna Anime: Aa Harimanada}}. It was directed by Norio Osada. The series premiered in Japan on [[TV Tokyo]] on April 23, 1992, and ran for 23 episodes until its conclusion on October 1, 1992. ''Aah! Harimanada'' is notable as an animated series based on the rare theme of sumo wrestling; following the end of the series' broadcast, no other such series would be produced until the premiere of ''[[Notari Matsutarō|Rowdy Wrestler!! Matsutaro]]'' in 2014.

''Aah! Harimanada'' was adapted into three video games of the same name in 1993. A [[Game Gear]] title was developed by [[Sega]] and released on July 2. A [[Game Boy]] title by Ask Kodansha was released on July 23. Sega also developed a title for the [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive]] that was released on September 3. The Mega Drive game was criticized for its "poor responsiveness" and "boring gameplay".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/sumo/sumo3.htm HardcoreGaming]&lt;/ref&gt; British gaming magazine [[Sega Pro]] rated the Mega Drive version 59 out of 100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=none|date=February 1994|journal=[[Sega Pro]]|publisher=[[Paragon Publishing]]|issue=28|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Artistic gymnastics''' is a discipline of [[gymnastics]] in which athletes perform short routines (ranging from approximately 30 to 90 [[second]]s) on different apparatuses, with less time for [[Vault (gymnastics)|vaulting]]. The sport is governed by the [[Federation Internationale de Gymnastique|Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique]] (FIG), which designs the [[Code of Points (artistic gymnastics)|Code of Points]] and regulates all aspects of international elite competition. Within individual countries, gymnastics is regulated by national federations, such as Gymnastics Canada in Canada, [[British Gymnastics]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[USA Gymnastics]] in the [[United States]]. Artistic gymnastics is a popular [[spectator sport]] at the [[Summer Olympic Games]] and other competitions.

==History==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-94681-0002, Werner Dölling.jpg|thumb|A gymnast performing on the [[parallel bars]] in 1962.]]
The gymnastic system was mentioned in works by ancient authors, such as [[Homer]], [[Aristotle]], and [[Plato]]. It included many disciplines that would later become separate sports, such as [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]], [[racing]], [[wrestling]], [[boxing]], and [[Equestrianism|riding]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.krugosvet.ru/articles/102/1010208/1010208a3.htm | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080620082659/http://www.krugosvet.ru/articles/102/1010208/1010208a3.htm | archivedate = 2008-06-20 | title = Sportivnaya gimnastika | work = Enciklopediya Krugosvet | accessdate = April 11, 2006|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was also used for military training. In its present form, gymnastics evolved in [[Bohemia]] and what is now [[Germany]] at the beginning of the 19th century, and the term "artistic gymnastics" was introduced at the same time to distinguish free styles from the ones used by the military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.olympic.org/uk/sports/programme/history_uk.asp?DiscCode=GA&amp;sportCode=GY | title = Artistic Gymnastics&amp;nbsp;— History | work = [[IOC]] | accessdate = April 11, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German educator [[Friedrich Ludwig Jahn]], who was known as the father of gymnastics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://encarta.msn.com/text_761567192___0/Gymnastics.html |title=Gymnastics |work=[[Encarta]] |accessdate=April 11, 2006 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwKijxRK?url=http://encarta.msn.com/text_761567192___0/Gymnastics.html |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; invented several apparatus, including the horizontal bar and parallel bars, which are used to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scholastic.com/teachers/articles/teaching-content/history-gymnastics-ancient-greece-modern-times/|title=A History of Gymnastics: From Ancient Greece to Modern Times {{!}} Scholastic|website=www.scholastic.com|access-date=2017-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the first gymnastics clubs were [[Turnverein]]s and [[Sokol]]s.

In 1881, the FIG was founded, and it remains the governing body of international gymnastics. It initially included only three countries and was called the European Gymnastics Federation until 1921, when the first non-European countries joined the federation and it was reorganized into its present form. Gymnastics was included in the program of the [[1896 Summer Olympics]], but women have been allowed to participate in the Olympics only since 1928. The World Championships, held since 1903, were open only to men until 1934. Since that time, two branches of artistic gymnastics have developed: women's artistic gymnastics (WAG) and men's artistic gymnastics (MAG). Unlike men's and women's branches of many other sports, WAG and MAG differ significantly in apparatus used at major competitions and in techniques.

===Women's artistic gymnastics (WAG)===
Women's gymnastics entered the Olympics as a team event in 1928 and was included in the twelfth gymnastics world championships in 1950. Individual women were recognized in the all-around as early as the tenth world championships in 1934. Two years after the full women's program (all-around and all four event finals) was introduced at the 1950 World Championships, it was added to the [[Gymnastics at the 1952 Summer Olympics|1952 Summer Olympics]] in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]], and the format has remained to this day.

The earliest champions in women's gymnastics tended to be in their 20s, and most had studied [[ballet]] for years before entering the sport. [[Larisa Latynina]], the first great [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] gymnast, won her first Olympic all-around medal at the age of 22 and her second at 26; she became the 1958 world champion while pregnant with her daughter. [[Věra Čáslavská]] of [[Czechoslovakia]], who followed Latynina to become a two-time Olympic all-around champion, was 22 before she started winning gold medals.

In the 1970s, the average age of Olympic gymnasts began to decrease. While it was not unheard-of for teenagers to compete in the 1960s—[[Ludmilla Tourischeva]] was 16 at her first Olympics in 1968—younger female gymnasts slowly became the norm as the sport's difficulty increased. Smaller, lighter girls generally excelled in the more challenging acrobatic elements required by the redesigned [[Code of Points (artistic gymnastics)|Code of Points]]. The 58th Congress of the FIG—held in July 1980, just before the Olympics—decided to raise the minimum age for senior international competition from 14 to 15.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=September 1980 |title=Within the International Federations |journal=Olympic Review |issue=155 |page=520 |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/OlympicInformationCenter/OlympicReview/1980/ore155/ORE155p.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2006-04-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060524213018/http://www.la84foundation.org/OlympicInformationCenter/OlympicReview/1980/ore155/ORE155p.pdf |archivedate=24 May 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The change, which came into effect two years later, did not eliminate the problem. By the time of the [[1992 Summer Olympics]], elite competitors consisted almost exclusively of "pixies"—underweight, [[Puberty|prepubertal]] teenagers—and concerns were raised about athletes' welfare.

The FIG responded to this trend by raising the minimum age for international elite competition to 16 in 1997. This, combined with changes in the Code of Points and evolving popular opinion in the sport, led to the return of older gymnasts. While the average elite female gymnast is still in her middle to late teens and of below-average height and weight, it is also common to see gymnasts competing well into their 20s. At the [[2004 Olympics]], both the second-place American team and the third-place Russians were captained by women in their mid-20s; several other teams, including [[Australia]], [[France]], and [[Canada]], included older gymnasts. At the [[2008 Olympics]], the silver medalist on vault, [[Oksana Chusovitina]], was a 33-year-old mother. She received another silver medal on vault at the 2011 World Championships in [[Tokyo]], when she was 36. At the age of 41, Chusovitina competed at her 7th consecutive Olympics at the [[2016 Olympics]], a world record for gymnastics.

==Apparatus==
Both male and female gymnasts are judged on all events for execution, [[degree of difficulty]], and overall presentation skills.

[[File:DHypolito-Vault.jpg|thumb|[[Diego Hypólito]] vaulting from a modern vaulting table during the [[2007 Pan American Games]].]]
; [[Vault (gymnastics)|Vault]]: The vault is an event as well as the primary piece of equipment used in that event. Unlike most of the gymnastic events employing apparatuses, the vault is common to both men's and women's competition, with little difference between the two categories. A gymnast sprints down a runway, which is a maximum of {{convert|25|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length, before leaping onto a [[Springboard (gymnastics)|springboard]]. Harnessing the energy of the spring, the gymnast directs his or her body hands-first towards the vault. Body position is maintained while "popping" (blocking using only a shoulder movement) the vaulting platform. The gymnast then rotates his or her body so as to land in a standing position on the far side of the vault. In advanced gymnastics, multiple twists and somersaults may be added before landing. Successful vaults depend on the speed of the run, the length of the hurdle, the power the gymnast generates from the legs and shoulder girdle, [[Kinaesthetics|kinesthetic]] awareness in the air, and the speed of rotation in the case of more difficult and complex vaults.

: In 2001, the traditional vaulting horse was replaced with a new apparatus, sometimes known as a tongue or table. It is more stable, wider, and longer than the older vaulting horse—approximately {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length and width—giving gymnasts a larger blocking surface, and is therefore safer than the old vaulting horse. With the addition of this new and safer apparatus, gymnasts are attempting more difficult and dangerous vaults.

[[File:FloorExercise-YOGArtisticGymnastics-BishanSportsHall-Singapore-20100816-01i.jpg|thumb|Néstor Abad's on floor exercise in 2010.]]
; [[Floor (gymnastics)|Floor exercise]]:The floor event occurs on a carpeted {{convert|12|x|12|m|ft|abbr=on}} square, called a "spring floor", consisting of hard foam over a layer of plywood, which is supported by springs or foam blocks. This provides a firm surface that will respond with force when compressed, allowing gymnasts to achieve extra height and a softer landing than would be possible on a regular floor. A series of tumbling passes are performed to demonstrate flexibility, strength, balance, and power. The gymnast must also show non-acrobatic skills, including circles, scales, and press handstands. Men's floor routines usually have multiple passes that will total from 60 to 70 seconds, and men perform without music (unlike women gymnasts). Rules require that gymnasts touch each corner of the floor at least once during their routine. Female gymnasts perform a 90-second choreographed routine to [[instrumental music]] on the same spring floor used by male gymnasts. Female routines consist of tumbling passes, a series of jumps, several dance elements, acrobatic skill elements, and turns. Elite gymnasts may perform up to four tumbling passes, each of which includes three or more skills.

===Men's only===
[[File:Alberto Braglia.jpg|thumb|right|[[Alberto Braglia]] won the gold medal in gymnastics at the 1908 and 1912 Olympics.]]

; [[Pommel horse]]: A typical pommel horse exercise involves both single leg and double leg work. Single leg skills are generally found in the form of scissors, an element often done on the pommels. Double leg work however, is the main staple of this event. The gymnast swings both legs in a circular motion (clockwise or counterclockwise depending on preference) and performs such skills on all parts of the apparatus. To make the exercise more challenging, gymnasts will often include variations on a typical circling skill by turning (moores and spindles) or by straddling their legs ([[Flare (acrobatic move)|flairs]]). Routines end when the gymnast performs a dismount, either by swinging his body over the horse, or landing after a handstand.
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-N0621-0038, DDR-Meisterschaften im Turnen, Klaus Köste.jpg|thumb|Klaus Köste on still rings.]]
; [[Rings (gymnastics)|Still rings]]: The still rings are suspended on [[wire cable]] from a point {{convert|5.8|m|ft|abbr=on}} off the floor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apparatus Norms |url=http://figdocs.lx2.sportcentric.com/external/serve.php?document=1540 |publisher=[[Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique|FIG]] |page=II/18 |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-11-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219195725/http://figdocs.lx2.sportcentric.com/external/serve.php?document=1540 |archivedate=2011-12-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and adjusted in height so the gymnast has room to hang freely and swing. He must perform a routine demonstrating balance, strength, power, and dynamic motion while preventing the rings themselves from swinging. At least one static strength move is required, but some gymnasts may include two or three. Most routines begin with a difficult mount and conclude with a difficult dismount.
[[File:Cucherat bars.JPG|thumb|Yann Cucherat on parallel bars in 2010.]]
;[[Parallel bars]]: Men perform on two bars slightly further than a shoulder's width apart and usually {{convert|1.75|m|ft|abbr=on}} high while executing a series of swings, balances, and releases that require great strength and coordination.
[[File:Kunstturner-Reinhard-Blum.jpg|thumb|Reinhard Blum on high bar.]]
;[[Horizontal bar]] or [[Horizontal bar|High bar]]: A {{convert|2.4|cm|in|abbr=on}} thick steel bar raised {{convert|2.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} above the landing area is all the gymnast has to hold onto as he performs giants (revolutions around the bar), release skills, twists, and changes of direction. By using the momentum from giants, enough height can be achieved for spectacular dismounts, such as a triple-back salto. Leather [[Grip (gymnastics)|grips]] are usually used to help maintain a grip on the bar.

===Women's only===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-K1102-0019, Karin Janz, Wahl.jpg|thumb|Karin Janz on uneven bars.]]
; [[Uneven bars]]: On the uneven bars (also known as '''asymmetric bars''' in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]), the gymnast navigates two horizontal bars set at different preset heights yet alterable widths. Gymnasts perform swinging, circling, transitional, and release moves, as well as moves that pass through the handstand. The most common way to mount these bars is by jumping towards the lower bar first.

: Higher-level gymnasts usually wear leather grips to ensure a grip is maintained on the bars while protecting hands from painful [[blister]]s and tears (known as rips). Gymnasts sometimes wet their grips with water from a spray bottle and then may apply chalk to their grips to prevent the hands from slipping. Chalk may also be applied to the hands and bar if grips are not worn.
[[File:Nastia Liukin Nationals.JPG|thumb|[[Nastia Liukin]] on the balance beam.]]
; [[Balance beam]]: The gymnast performs a choreographed routine from 70 to 90 seconds in length consisting of leaps, acrobatic skills, turns and dance elements on a padded spring beam. Apparatus norms set by the [[International Gymnastics Federation]] (used for Olympic and most elite competitions) specify the beam must be {{convert|125|cm|ft|0|abbr=on}} high, {{convert|500|cm|ft|abbr=on}} long, and {{convert|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080625041741/http://www.fedintgym.com/rules/docs/03-apparatus/appnorms0701-e.pdf Apparatus Norms], International Gymnastics Federation, p.63. Retrieved 2007-03-27.&lt;/ref&gt; The event requires balance, flexibility and strength.

==Format of competition==
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 20592 The Gymnast sculpture in Wingate Institute.JPG|250px|thumb|The Gymnast sculpture in [[Wingate Institute]], [[Israel]]]]Currently, in Olympic or World Championships competition, the meet is divided into several sessions which occur on different days: qualification, team finals, all-around finals and event finals.

During the '''qualification''' (abbreviated TQ) round, gymnasts compete with their national squad on all four (WAG) or six (MAG) apparatus. The scores from this session are not used to award medals, but are used to determine which teams advance to the team finals and which individual gymnasts advance to the all-around and event finals. For the 2020 Olympic cycle a new qualification format has been adopted. Each country can enter six gymnasts: a four-person team and two individual gymnasts. The current format of team qualification is 4–4–3, meaning that there are four gymnasts on the team, all four compete on each event, and three of the scores count. Individual gymnasts also compete to be qualified to the all-around and event finals, but their scores do not count toward team score.

In the '''team finals''' (abbreviated TF), gymnasts compete with their national squad on all four/six apparatus. The scores from the session are used to determine the medalists of the team competition. The current format is 4–3–3, meaning that there are four gymnasts on the team, three compete on each event, and all three scores count. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fig-gymnastics.com/site/figNews/view?id=1151# "Q and A on the new Olympic qualification system in Gymnastics"], FIG, 2015-05-21&lt;/ref&gt;

In the '''all-around''' finals (abbreviated AA), the gymnasts are individual competitors and perform on all four/six apparatus. Their scores from all four/six events are added together and the gymnasts with the three highest totals are awarded all-around medals. Only two gymnasts from each country may advance to the all-around finals.

In the '''event finals''' (abbreviated EF) or '''apparatus finals''', the top eight gymnasts on each event compete for medals. Only two gymnasts from each country may advance to each event final.

Other competitions are not bound by these rules, and may use other formats. For instance, the 2007 Pan American Games had only one day of team competition on a 6–5–4 format, and allowed three athletes from each country to advance to the all-around. In other meets, such as those on the World Cup circuit, the team event is not contested at all.

===New Life===
Competitions use the ''New Life'' scoring rule, which was introduced in 1989. Under New Life, marks from one session do not carry over to the next. In other words, a gymnast's performance in team finals does not affect his or her scores in the all-around finals or event finals; he or she starts with a clean slate. In addition, the marks from the team qualifying round do not count toward the team finals.

Before the introduction of the New Life rule, the scores from the team competition carried over into the all-around and event finals, and could have a negative or positive effect on the gymnast's efforts in subsequent sessions. The gymnasts' final results, and medal placement were previously determined by the combination of the following scores:

* '''Qualifiers for all-around and event finals:''' Team compulsories + team optionals
* '''Team competition:''' Team compulsories + team optionals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mitchell|first1=sarai}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''All-around competition:''' Team results (compulsories and optionals) averaged + all-around
* '''Event finals:''' Team results (compulsories and optionals) averaged + event final

===Compulsories===
Before 1997, the team competition was structured differently. It still consisted of two sessions. However, gymnasts performed '''compulsory exercises''' in the preliminaries and their optional routines on the second day. The team medals were awarded on the combined scores of both days. All-around and event final qualifiers were also determined according to the combined scores. In meets where team titles were not contested, such as the [[American Cup (Gymnastics)|American Cup]], there were two days of all-around competition: one for compulsories and one for optionals.

The optionals were the gymnasts' personal routines, developed with their coaches to adhere to the requirements of the ''Code of Points.'' They were performed in the team finals, the all-around and the event finals.

The compulsories were routines that were developed and choreographed by the FIG Technical Committee. They were performed on the first day of the team competition. Every single elite gymnast in every single FIG member nation performed the same exercises. The dance and tumbling skills of compulsory routines were generally less difficult than those of the optionals, but heavily emphasized perfect technique, form and execution. Scoring was exacting, with judges taking deductions for even slight deviations from the required choreography. For this reason, many gymnasts and coaches considered compulsories more challenging to perform than optionals.

Compulsories were eliminated at the end of 1996. The move was extremely controversial, and many successful gymnastics federations, including [[Russia]], the [[United States]] and [[People's Republic of China|China]], voted against the abolition of compulsories. They argued that the exercises helped maintain a high standard of form, technique and execution among gymnasts. Opponents believed that compulsories harmed emerging gymnastics programs. Many members of the gymnastics community still argue that compulsories should be reinstated.

Many gymnastics federations have maintained compulsories in their national programs. Gymnasts competing at the lower levels of the sport—for instance, Level 4–6 in USA Gymnastics, grade 2 in [[South Africa]] and national levels 3–6 in Australia—frequently only perform compulsory routines.

===Competition levels===
Artistic gymnasts compete only with other gymnasts in their level. Gymnasts start at the lowest level of competition and advance to higher levels by learning gymnastics skills and achieving qualifying scores at competitions.

In [[USA Gymnastics|America]], levels range from 1 to [[Level 10 (USA Gymnastics)|10]], then junior elite and senior elite. Elite, especially senior elite is considered Olympic level, and these gymnasts generally perform routines designed to meet the FIG's international ''Code of Points''. Levels 1–2 are usually considered recreational, or beginner; 3–6 intermediate, and 7–Elite advanced. Competitions begin at level 3 and in some gyms, level 2. A gymnast must have specific skills for each event in order to advance to the next level and once a gymnast has competed in a Sectional meet, they may not drop back to a lower level in the same competitive season. Levels 1–2 are basic skills, such as handstands, cartwheels, etc. 3–5 are compulsory levels, and 6 is an in-between level, with strict requirements but still allowing the gymnast to add in their own creativity.

In the UK, the levels system goes from 5 (lowest) to 2; there are also two tracks for Elite and Club level competition. In Canada there are several different competitive streams: Recreational, Developmental, Pre-Competitive, Provincial, National and High Performance. Provincial levels range from 5 (lowest) to 1; National levels are Pre-Novice, Novice, Open, and High Performance. High Performance levels are Novice, Junior and Senior.

In Germany, there are different competitive systems for grassroots sport and for high-performance sport. For hobby sportsmen there is a system of compulsory exercises from 1 to 9 and of optional exercises from 4 to 1 with modified requirements of the Code of Points. This competitions end on national level. For high-performans athletes and the junior there are several compulsory and optional requirements defined by age (age class exercises). They are existing from age of 6 up to the age of 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kari-turnen.de|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=Judge Homepage of the German Gymnastics Association (DTB)|publisher=Deutscher Turner-Bund e. V.|access-date=2016-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Age limits===
{{See also|Age falsification in gymnastics|Gymnastics all-around champions by age}}

The FIG imposes a minimum age limit on gymnasts competing in international meets. The term '''senior''', in gymnastics, refers to any world-class or elite gymnast who is age-eligible under FIG rules. The term '''junior''' refers to any gymnast who competes at a world-class or elite level, but is too young to be classified as a senior. Currently, female gymnasts must be at least sixteen years of age, or turning sixteen within the calendar year, the male 18, to be classified as a senior. Juniors are judged under the same ''Code of Points'' as the seniors, but with further restrictions, and often exhibit the same level of difficulty in their routines.

Many meets, such as the [[European Women's Artistic Gymnastics Championships|European Championships]], have separate divisions for juniors, but some competitions, such as the [[Goodwill Games]], the [[Pan American Games|Pan Am Games]], the [[Pacific Rim Championships]] and the [[All-Africa Games]], have rules that permit seniors and juniors to compete together.

Only senior gymnasts are allowed to compete in the Olympics, [[World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|World Championships]] and [[Artistic Gymnastics World Cup|World Cup]] circuit. For the current Olympic cycle, in order to compete in the [[2016 Summer Olympics|2016 Olympics]], a female gymnast must have a birthdate before January 1, 2001 (corresponding to an age of at least 15 years and 8 months on the first day of the games), the counterpart gender must be minimum 18 years old. There is no maximum age restriction.

The minimum age requirement is arguably one of the most contentious rules in artistic gymnastics, and is frequently debated by coaches, gymnasts and other members of the gymnastics community. Those in favor of the age limits{{who|date=August 2013}} argue that they promote the participation of older athletes in the sport, and that they spare younger gymnasts from the stress of competition and training at a high level. Opponents of the rule point out that junior gymnasts are scored under the same ''Code of Points'' as the seniors, except for some restrictions, and train mostly the same skills. They also feel that younger gymnasts need the experience of participating in major meets in order to become better athletes; and that if a junior has the skills and maturity to be competitive with seniors, he or she should be allowed that opportunity.

Another point that frequently arises{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} in this debate is the issue of age falsification. Since stricter age limit rules were first adopted in the early 1980s, there have been several well-documented, and many more suspected, cases of juniors with falsified documents competing as seniors. The FIG has only taken disciplinary action in three cases: those of [[Kim Gwang-Suk]] of [[North Korea]], who competed at the [[1989 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships]] at the approximate age of eleven; North Korean [[Hong Su-jong]], who competed under three different birth dates in the 2000s, and China's [[Dong Fangxiao]], who competed at the 2000 Olympics when she was two years below the age minimum.

While the minimum age requirement applies to both women and men, it is far more contentious in the women's program.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Most top male gymnasts are in their late teens or early twenties, while female gymnasts are typically ready to compete at the international level by their mid-teens. The difference is largely due to the fact that the men's skills tend to emphasize strength more than the women's skills.

===Scoring and the ''Code of Points''===
{{Main|Code of Points (artistic gymnastics)}}

Scoring at the international level is regulated by the ''[[Code of Points (artistic gymnastics)|Code of Points]]''. This system was significantly overhauled for 2006. Under the new Code of Points, there are two different panels judging each routine, evaluating different aspects of the performance. The D score covers Difficulty Value, Element Group Requirements and Connection Value; the E score covers execution, composition and artistry. The most visible change to the Code was the abandonment of the "Perfect 10" for an open-ended scoring system for difficulty (the D score). The E score is still limited to a maximum of 10. The sum of the two provides a gymnast's total score for the routine. Theoretically this means scores could be infinite, although average marks for routines in major competitions in 2016 generally stayed in the mid-teens.

Many gymnasts, including [[Nadia Comăneci]], [[Mary Lou Retton]], [[Josef Stalder]], and [[Kurt Thomas (gymnast)|Kurt Thomas]], have attributed their original skills to the [[Code of Points (artistic gymnastics)|Table of Elements]] section of the Code that helps define a routine's difficulty.

Before 2006, every routine was assigned a Start Value (SV). A routine with maximum SV performed perfectly was worth a 10.0. A routine with all required elements was automatically given a base SV (9.4 in 1996; 9.0 in 1997; 8.8 in 2001). It was up to the gymnast to increase the SV to 10.0 by performing difficult skills and combinations.

Many gymnastics insiders, coaches, officials and gymnasts have protested the new Code, with Olympic gold medalists [[Lilia Podkopayeva]], [[Svetlana Boguinskaya]], [[Shannon Miller]] and [[Vitaly Scherbo]] and Romanian team coach Nicolae Forminte publicly voicing their opposition. In addition, the 2006 report from the FIG Athletes' Commission cited major concerns about scoring, judging and other points of the new Code. Aspects of the Code were revised in 2007; however, there are no plans to abandon the new scoring system and return to the 10.0 format.

===National===
Most countries hold a major competition (National Championships, or "Nationals") every year that determines the best-performing all-around gymnasts and event specialists in their country. Gymnasts may also qualify to their country's national team or be selected for international meets based on their scores at Nationals.

==Dominant teams and nations==

===USSR/Post-Soviet Republics===
'''[[USSR]]/The Unified Team/[[Russia]]/[[Ukraine]]/[[Belarus]]/[[Armenia]]''': Before the breakup of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991, Soviet gymnasts dominated both men's and women's gymnastics, commencing with the introduction of the full women's program into the Olympics and the overall increased standardization of the Olympic gymnastics competition format which happened in 1952. Soviet Union's success might be explained by a heavy state's investment in sports to fulfil its political agenda on an international stage.&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.bu.edu/guidedhistory/russia-and-its-empires/tyler-benson/&lt;/ref&gt; They had many [[List of gymnasts#USSR 2|male stars]], such as Olympic all-around champions [[Viktor Chukarin]] and [[Vitaly Scherbo]], and [[List of gymnasts#USSR|female stars]], such as Olympic all-around champion [[Larisa Latynina]] and World all-around and Olympic champion [[Svetlana Boginskaya]] who contributed to this tradition. From 1952 to 1992 inclusive, the Soviet women's squad won almost every single team title in [[World Gymnastics Championships|World Championship]] competition and at the [[Summer Olympics]]: the only four exceptions were the [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Olympics]], which they did not attend, and the 1966, 1979, and 1987 World Championships. Most of the famous Soviet gymnasts were from the [[Russian SFSR]], the [[Ukrainian SSR]] and the [[Byelorussian SSR]].
Following the breakup of the Soviet Union, they competed together as one nation for the last time at the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] as a "Unified Team," winning the gold. [[Russia]] has maintained the tradition of gymnastics excellence, medaling at every Worlds and Olympic competition in both MAG and WAG disciplines, except in the [[Gymnastics at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Olympics]], where the Russian women's team did not win any medals. [[Ukraine]] also has a strong team; Ukrainian [[Lilia Podkopayeva]] was the all-around champion at the [[1996 Olympics]]. Belarus has maintained a strong men's team. Other former republics have been somewhat less successful.
In terms of medal results and overall domination, the Soviet legacy remains the strongest of all in artistic gymnastics.

===Romania===
'''[[Romania]]''': The Romanian team first achieved wide-scale success at the [[1976 Summer Olympics]] with the tremendous performance of [[Nadia Comăneci]]. Since then, using the centralized training system pioneered by [[Béla Károlyi]], they have been a dominant force in both team and individual events in WAG. With the exception of the defeat of the Soviet women's team by the Czechoslovakian women's team at the 1966 World Championships, Romania was the only team ever to defeat the Soviets in head-to-head competition at the World Championships/Olympic level with their victories at the 1979 and 1987 Worlds. Their women's teams have also won team medals at every Olympics from 1976 to 2012 inclusive, including three victories in 1984, 2000, and 2004. At the 16 World Championships from 1978 to 2007 inclusive, the women's team failed to medal only twice (in 1981 and 2006) and has won the team title seven times, including five victories in a row (1994–2001). From 1976 to 2000, they placed [[List of gymnasts#Romania|notable gymnasts]] such as [[Daniela Silivaş]], [[Lavinia Miloşovici]], and [[Simona Amânar]] on the Olympic all-around podium at every Olympics, and have usually done the same for the individual events at the World Championships through 2015, producing World all-around champions [[Aurelia Dobre]] and [[Maria Olaru]]. The Romanian men's program, while less successful, is still maturing and producing [[List of gymnasts#Romania 2|individual medalists]] such as [[Marian Drăgulescu]] and [[Marius Urzică]] at World and Olympic competitions, and they have started winning team medals as well. The Romanian women's team failed to qualify for the [[2016 Summer Olympics]], but they may send one individual gymnast.

===United States===
{{main|Artistic gymnastics in the United States}}
'''[[United States]]''': While isolated American gymnasts, including [[Kurt Thomas (gymnast)|Kurt Thomas]] and [[Cathy Rigby]], won medals in World Championship meets in the 1970s, the United States team was largely considered a "second power" until the mid- to late 1980s, when American gymnasts began medaling consistently in major, fully attended competitions. In 1984, the Olympic men's team won the gold. The team included [[Tim Daggett]], [[Peter Vidmar]], [[Mitch Gaylord]], [[Bart Conner]], Scott Johnson, Jim Hartung, and the team alternate Jim Mikus. Also in 1984, [[Mary Lou Retton]] became the first American Olympic all-around champion and won individual medals as well. In 1991, [[Kim Zmeskal]] became the first American world all-around champion. At the [[Gymnastics at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Olympics]], the American women won their first team medal (bronze), as well as their highest all-around ranking, a silver medal by [[Shannon Miller]], in a fully attended Games. In men's gymnastics, [[Trent Dimas]] was able to capture the gold medal on the horizontal bar. This was the second time that an American gymnast, male or female, won a gold medal in an Olympics held outside the United States. The U.S. women's team has become increasingly successful in the modern era, with the 1996 Olympic team victory of the [[Magnificent Seven (Gymnastics)|Magnificent Seven]] in Atlanta, the 2003 Worlds team victory in Anaheim, California, and multiple-medal hauls in both WAG and MAG at the [[2004 Olympics]]. At the [[2012 Olympics]] and [[2016 Olympics]], the U.S. won the team gold.  The United States has produced [[List of gymnasts#USA|individual gymnasts]] such as Olympic all-around champions [[Carly Patterson]] (2004), [[Nastia Liukin]] (2008), [[Gabby Douglas]] (2012), and [[Simone Biles]] (2016), and world all-around champions [[Kim Zmeskal]] (1991), [[Shannon Miller]] (1993, 1994), [[Chellsie Memmel]] (2005), [[Shawn Johnson]] (2007), [[Bridget Sloan]] (2009), [[Jordyn Wieber]] (2011), [[Simone Biles]] (2013, 2014, 2015, 2018), and [[Morgan Hurd]] (2017). Of particular note is that at the 2005 World Championships in [[Melbourne]], American women won the gold and silver the all-around and went 1–2 in every single event final except vault (in which they placed third). They continue to be one of the most dominant forces in the sport. The men's team has also matured, making the medal podium at both the 2004 and 2008 Olympics; they also made the podium at the 2003 and 2011 World Championships. [[Paul Hamm]], the most successful U.S. male gymnast, became the first American to win the world all-around title in 2003. He followed this up by winning the gold medal at the 2004 Olympic Games. 2010 world all-around bronze medalist [[Jonathan Horton]] captured the silver medal on the horizontal bar at the 2008 Olympic Games, and Danell Leyva won the all-around bronze medal at the 2012 Olympic Games, as well as two silver medals (parallel bars and high bar) at the 2016 Olympics.

===China===
'''[[China]]''' has developed strong, successful programs in both WAG and MAG over the past 25 years, earning both team and individual medals. The Chinese men's team won the team gold at the [[2000 Olympics]], [[2008 Olympics]], and every team world championship since 1994, except in 2001, when they placed fifth. They have produced such [[List of gymnasts#China 2|individual gymnasts]] as Olympic (and world) all-around champions [[Li Xiaoshuang]] (1996) and [[Yang Wei (gymnast)|Yang Wei]] (2008). The Chinese women's team won the team gold medal at the 2006 World Championships and the 2008 Olympics, and has produced [[List of gymnasts#China|individual gymnasts]] such as Olympic, world and World Cup champions [[Mo Huilan]], [[Kui Yuanyuan]], [[Yang Bo (gymnast)|Yang Bo]], [[Ma Yanhong]], [[Cheng Fei]], [[Sui Lu]], [[Huang Huidan]], [[Yao Jinnan]] and [[Fan Yilin]]. Chinese female Olympic individual gold medalists include [[Ma Yanhong]], [[Lu Li]], [[Liu Xuan (gymnast)|Liu Xuan]], [[He Kexin]], and [[Deng Linlin]]. Though for many years considered a two-event team (uneven bars and balance beam), they have developed and continue to develop successful all-around gymnasts, such as Olympic all-around bronze medalists, [[Liu Xuan (gymnast)|Liu Xuan]], [[Zhang Nan (gymnast)|Zhang Nan]] and [[Yang Yilin]]. However, like the former USSR, they have been plagued by some Western media reports relating to their grueling and sometimes cruel training methods and age falsification accusations.

===Japan===
'''[[Japan]]''' was largely dominant in MAG during the 1960s and 1970s, winning every Olympic team title from 1960 through 1976 thanks to [[List of gymnasts#Japan 2|individual gymnasts]] such as Olympic all-around champions [[Sawao Kato]] and [[Yukio Endo (gymnast)|Yukio Endo]]. Several innovations pioneered by [[List of gymnasts#Japan 2|Japanese gymnasts]] during this era have remained in the sport, including the [[Tsukahara vault]]. Japanese male gymnasts have re-emerged as a team to reckon with since winning a team gold at the [[2004 Olympics]]. Six-time world champion and Two-time Olympic All-around gold medalist [[Kohei Uchimura]] is widely considered to be the best all-around gymnast ever. The women have been less successful, but there have been such standouts as Olympic and world medalist [[Keiko Tanaka Ikeda]], who competed in the 1950s and 1960s. There have also been some emerging talents in recent years, such as [[Koko Tsurumi]], [[Rie Tanaka]], [[Yuka Tomita]], [[Natsumi Sasada]], [[Yuko Shintake]], [[Asuka Teramoto]], [[Sae Miyakawa]], [[Hitomi Hatakeda]] and [[Mai Murakami]] who did provide the women's team with talent worthy of placing in the top teams at the last championships and Olympics. They also have been winning world individual medals, Tsurumi's all-around bronze and bars silver at 2009 and Murakami's floor gold at 2017, the first Japanese gold since Keiko Tanaka.

===Germany===
'''The [[German Democratic Republic]], or [[East Germany]],''' had an extremely successful gymnastics program before the reunification of Germany. Both the MAG and WAG teams frequently won silver or bronze team medals at the World Championships and Olympics. [[List of gymnasts#Germany 2|Male gymnasts]] such as [[Andreas Wecker]] and [[Roland Brückner]] and [[List of gymnasts#Germany|female gymnasts]] such as [[Maxi Gnauck]] and [[Karin Janz]] contributed to their country's success. In spite of the fact that they weren't as successful as East Germany, the [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] had international stars too, like [[Eberhard Gienger]], Willi Jaschek or [[Helmut Bantz]]. Since the reunification of Germany, they have continued to have a measure of success with such gymnasts as [[Fabian Hambüchen]], [[Philipp Boy]], and [[Marcel Nguyen]], the former Soviet/Uzbek gymnast [[Oksana Chusovitina]] who competed for Germany during some years and [[Pauline Schäfer]].

===Czechoslovakia===
The '''[[Czechoslovakia]]n''' women's team had a very long tradition of success and was the chief threat to the dominance of the Soviet women's team for decades. They won team medals at every World Championships and Olympics from 1934 to 1970, with the exceptions of the 1950 Worlds and 1956 Olympics. Among [[list of gymnasts#Czechoslovakia|their leaders]] were the first women's world all-around champion, [[Vlasta Děkanová]] (1934, 1938) and [[Věra Čáslavská]], who won outright all five European, World and Olympic all-around titles during an [[Olympic cycle]] from 1964 to 1968—a feat never matched by any other gymnast, male or female. Čáslavská also led her teammates to the world team title in 1966, making the Czechoslovakians one of two national teams (Romania being the other) ever to defeat the Soviet women's team at a major competition.  [[List of gymnasts#Czechoslovakia 2|Their men]]'s success came earlier and was concurrent with the success of Dekanova, but by the time of Caslavska, they had no significant male counterparts among the men for their women.  Their overall success, however, at the [[World Artistic Gymnastics Championships]] was the greatest of any country prior to World War II in terms of being first in the medal table more than any other country and winning the most team titles of any team during the pre-WWII period.  Also, as Czechoslovakia, or in their pre World War I nationhood as the Austro-Hungarian constituent [[Bohemia]], they produced 4 different Men's World All Around Champions:  [[Josef Cada]] in 1907, [[Ferdinand Steiner]] in 1911, [[Frantisek Pechacek]] in 1922, and [[Jan Gajdos]] in 1938.  Perhaps their most decorated athlete, overall, was [[Ladislav Vacha]] who won a total of 10 individual medals at the Olympics and World Championships – moreso than any other of their athletes.

===Hungary===
Another Eastern Bloc country whose women achieved notable results was '''[[Hungary]]'''. Led by individuals such as 10-time Olympic medalist (with five golds) [[Ágnes Keleti]], their team medaled at the first four Olympics with women's artistic gymnastics competitions (1936–1956), as well as at the 1954 World Championships. Their women's program went into a decline with minor occasional success, although much later, during the late 1980s and early 1990s, world and Olympic [[Vault (gymnastics)|Vault]] champion [[Henrietta Ónodi]] put them back on the map. [[List of gymnasts#Hungary 2|Their men]] never had quite the same level of success as [[List of gymnasts#Hungary|their women]], although [[Zoltán Magyar]] dominated the [[pommel horse]] event during the 1970s, winning eight (of a possible nine) European, World and Olympic titles from 1973–1980. World and Olympic champion on [[Rings (gymnastics)|rings]], [[Szilveszter Csollány]], also kept Hungary on the medal platform at major competitions for a decade starting in the early 1990s.  In more recent years, [[Krisztián Berki]] has won World and Olympic titles on the Pommel Horse.

===Other nations===
Several other nations were at one time or have become in recent years serious contenders in both WAG and MAG. Part of the rise of the success of various countries' programs in recent years is attributable to the exodus of lots of talent from the USSR and other former [[Eastern Bloc]] countries. [[Korea|South Korea]], [[Canada]], [[Spain]], [[Greece]], [[Australia]], [[Brazil]], [[France]], [[Italy]] and [[Great Britain]] are among the other countries to have produced world and Olympic medalists and have started winning team medals at the European, World and Olympic level.

==Health effects==
Artistic gymnastics carries inherently high risk of spinal and other injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sands|first1=William|title=Stretching the Spines of Gymnasts: A Review|pmc=4769315}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kruse|first1=David|title=Spine Injuries in the Sport of Gymnastics|url=http://www.sportmedicine.ru/articles/kruse-spine-injuries.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eating disorders can also be quite common, especially in women's gymnastics when gymnasts are motivated and sometimes pushed by coaches to maintain a lower than normal bodyweight.

'''Benedetti–Wehrli Stadium''' is a stadium in [[Naperville, Illinois]]. It is primary used for [[American football]] and [[soccer]]. The stadium hosted the 2000 NCAA Division III Men's Outdoor Track and Field Championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Benedetti–Wehrli Stadium|publisher=northcentralcollege.edu/ |url=https://northcentralcollege.edu/community-and-visitors/benedetti-wehrli-stadium|accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium opened in 1999 for [[North Central College]] and was used by the [[Chicago Fire Soccer Club|Chicago Fire]] in 2002 and 2003, when it was known as ''Cardinal Stadium''. Benedetti–Wehrli Stadium is named after two North Central College Alumni/Donors: Albert Benedetti and Richard Wehrli. Benedetti-Wehrli also hosts the two highly hyped football games of [[Naperville Central High School]] - [[Naperville North High School]] and  [[Waubonsie Valley  High School]]-[[Neuqua Valley High School]].

The New Zealand '''Castrol Six Hour''' Race was an endurance motorcycle race that was held for fifteen years at [[Manfeild]], [[Palmerston North]] from 1974 to 1988. Many of New Zealand's top international riders competed at the Six Hour race; winners included [[Dave Hiscock]] (5-time winner), [[Neil Chivas]] (4-time winner), [[Graeme Crosby]] (3-time winner), [[Aaron Slight]] (2-time winner), and [[Ginger Molloy]] (first winner).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mnz.co.nz/history.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;  The race was characterised by its exclusive use of unmodified standard production motorcycles and a running start where the racers had to run to their machines before they could start. There was special provisions that the machines were no older than 3 years old, which was a boon to the motorcycle industry in New Zealand at the time which saw a dramatic rise in the sale of Motorcycles after these events.

Due to the [[political status of Taiwan]], the [[Republic of China]] (ROC) competed as '''[[Chinese Taipei]]''' at the '''[[2002 Winter Olympics]]''' in [[Salt Lake City, Utah|Salt Lake City]], [[United States]].  The [[International Olympic Committee]] mandates that the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee flag is used, and not the [[flag of the Republic of China]].
In the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC), the team is known as ''Zhongguo Taibei'' (中国台北队) or, ''Taipei, China'', where ''China'' implies the PRC.

'''Crystal Palace Park Cricket Ground''' was a [[cricket]] ground in [[Crystal Palace, London|Crystal Palace]] in south-east London. It was located in [[Crystal Palace Park]] in the shadow of [[The Crystal Palace]]. The ground was established on 3 June 1857 and used for [[first-class cricket]] between 1864 and 1906.

The site of the ground was part of the county of [[Kent]] when it was first established and it was initially used by [[Kent County Cricket Club]] in the 1860s before becoming the main ground for [[London County Cricket Club]] between 1900 and 1904. The site of the ground is now in the [[London Borough of Bromley]] and forms part of the [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre]].

==Cricket history==
[[Image:CrystalPalace1905.jpg|thumb|350px|right|A panoramic view of the Crystal Palace ground during the [[1905 FA Cup Final]], the only such photograph of the stadium known to exist. The cricket pavilion is to the right.]]
The cricket ground at Crystal palace was laid out in 1857 as part of the development of [[The Crystal Palace]] itself which had opened in 1854. An {{convert|3.2|ha|acre}} site was used and the ground became the home of Crystal Palace Cricket Club – prior to the development of the site the general location had been used as a ground by [[Sydenham]] Cricket Club.&lt;ref name=ciground&gt;[http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/ground/56946.html Crystal Palace Park], [[CricInfo]]. Retrieved 2017-11-27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=milton&gt;Milton H (1979) Kent cricket grounds, in ''The Cricket Statistician'', no.28, December 1979, pp.2–10.&lt;/ref&gt; The club played at the ground until 1900 when they were subsumed into the newly formed London County team.&lt;ref name=ciground /&gt;&lt;ref name=camisc&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/445_misc.html Other matches played on Crystal Palace Park, Crystal Palace], CricketArchive. Retrieved 2017-11-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first recorded [[first-class cricket]] match on the ground was in 1864, when [[Kent County Cricket Club]] played [[Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club|Nottinghamshire]]. From 1869 to 1870, Kent played four further first-class matches at the ground, two in each season.&lt;ref name=ciground /&gt;&lt;ref name=17annual210&gt;Grounds Records in ''Kent County Cricket Club Annual 2017'', pp.210–211.

Retrieved 2017-11-27.&lt;/ref&gt; The club has a tradition of playing cricket at grounds in what it terms "Metropolitan Kent".&lt;ref name=guide3jun16&gt;Clifford J (2016) 'Welcome to the Kent County Ground, Beckenham' in ''Match Guide'', 2016-06-03. Canterbury: [[Kent County Cricket Club]].&lt;/ref&gt; Grounds in nearby [[Beckenham]], [[Rectory Field|Blackheath]], [[Private Banks Sports Ground|Catford]] and [[Hesketh Park (cricket ground)|Dartford]] have all also been used by the club in the past for a total of more than 150 matches and the first match played by the county club after its foundation in 1842 was played at [[White Hart Field]] in [[Bromley]].&lt;ref name=17annual210 /&gt;

Ten years passed before first-class cricket returned to Crystal Palace, when in 1880 the [[Gentlemen v Players|Players]] played the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1880|touring Australians]] at the ground. In 1888 an [[England national cricket team|England XI]] played [[Australian cricket team in England in 1888|another touring Australian side]] and three further first-class matches took place on the ground from 1890 to 1900.&lt;ref name=cafc /&gt;

In 1898, the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace Company]] formed [[London County Cricket Club]] after offering [[W.G. Grace]] the roles of the club's secretary, manager and captain. Grace accepted the offer and his 29-year association with [[Gloucestershire County Cricket Club|Gloucestershire]] ended as a result of the conflicts between the new club and his county side.&lt;ref name=ci28jan06&gt;Williamson M (2006) [http://www.espncricinfo.com/columns/content/story/234735.html WG Grace gets the hump], [[CricInfo]], 2006-01-28. Retrieved 2017-11-27.&lt;/ref&gt; London County played their first first-class match at the ground in 1900 against [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]]. From 1900 to 1904 the team played 34 first-class matches at Crystal Palace,&lt;ref name=cafc /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Gibson]]: The Cricket Captains of England (1989), p 57.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Martin-Jenkins]]: ''The Wisden Book of County Cricket'' (1981), p 441.&lt;/ref&gt; the last of which saw them play [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire]] in August 1904.&lt;ref name=cafc /&gt; The increase in the importance of the [[County Championship]], Grace's decline in form due to age and the lack of a competitive element in the matches led to a decline in attendances and meant that the team lost money, with the club winding up in 1908.

The Gentlemen of England used the ground for three first-class matches in 1905 against a [[Australian cricket team in England in 1905|touring Australian side]], [[Oxford University Cricket Club|Oxford University]] and [[Cambridge University Cricket Club|Cambridge University]] and in 1906 a WG Grace's XI played the touring [[West Indian cricket team in England in 1906|West Indians]] and Cambridge University.&lt;ref name=cafc /&gt;

==Modern use==
{{main|Crystal Palace National Sports Centre}}
During [[World War I]] the ground and surrounding ornamental gardens were used as a training depot by the [[Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve]]. This largely destroyed the cricket pitch and after the war the original cricket field was used as [[tennis]] courts from 1921 and then for [[association football|football pitches]].&lt;ref name=milton /&gt; The pavilion was demolished in 1960 and the site today forms part of the [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre]], which was built in 1964.&lt;ref name=ciground /&gt; Facilities include an athletics stadium, indoor arena, swimming pool and a range of other sports facilities.&lt;ref name=nscfacil&gt;[http://www.better.org.uk/leisure-centre/london/crystal-palace/crystal-palace-national-sports-centre/facilities Facilities at Crystal Palace National Sports Centre], Better.org.

A cricket ground was re-established on the site in the early 1990s and cricket is played on the site.&lt;ref name=ciground /&gt;

==Records on the ground==
A total of 48 [[first-class cricket]] matches were held on the ground between 1864 and 1906. London County were the home team in 34 of these with Kent playing as the home side in five. The two teams never played each other at Crystal Palace.&lt;ref name=ca&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/445.html Crystal Palace Park, Crystal Palace], CricketArchive.

'''Estadio Charrúa''' is a multi-use [[stadium]] in the [[Carrasco, Montevideo|Carrasco]] neighborhood of [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]] used mostly for [[Association football|football]] and [[rugby union]] matches. It is currently leased to the [[Uruguayan Rugby Union]], governing body of that sport in the country, which uses it for its headquarters, its high performance training center, and as the regular home of its national teams, most notably the [[Uruguay national rugby union team|senior men's team]].&lt;ref name=ESPN/&gt; The stadium holds about 14,000 people. It was built in 1984 and then, in 2006 was re-built thanks to a [[FIFA]] project called GOAL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.auf.org.uy/charrua.html |title=Estadio Charrúa |work=Uruguay FA |accessdate=8 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902174301/http://www.auf.org.uy/charrua.html |archivedate=September 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Expo Hall''' is an [[indoor arena]] located at the [[Florida State Fairgrounds]] in [[Tampa, Florida]]. It is used primarily as an exhibition hall during the [[Florida State Fair]], but has also hosted concerts and sporting events.

The [[Tampa Bay Rowdies (1975–1993)|Tampa Bay Rowdies]] of the defunct [[North American Soccer League (1968–1984)|North American Soccer League]] used Expo Hall for 8 of their 16 home games during the [[1983–84 NASL Indoor season|1983–84 indoor season]]. At that time the arena's capacity was 9,200.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bunch |first=Ken |title=Arena possible site for Rowdies |date=November 8, 1983|publisher=[[Milwaukee Sentinel]]|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1368&amp;dat=19831108&amp;id=rgMiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5E4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2125,1815838&amp;hl=en |page=1-2 |accessdate=2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would also prove to be the league's final indoor campaign before suspending operations following the 1984 outdoor season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Beard |first=Randy |title=Don't hold your breath as Rowdies unveil schedule |date=November 5, 1983|publisher=[[Evening Independent]]|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VsNaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=rFkDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6845,2717682&amp;dq=tulsa+roughnecks&amp;hl=en |page=4-C |accessdate=2012-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arena was more famously used by the [[National Hockey League]]'s [[Tampa Bay Lightning]] during the team's inaugural season of [[1992–93 Tampa Bay Lightning season|1992-1993]]. The facility's [[seating capacity]] of 10,425 proved too small for the Lightning, and the team relocated to the [[Tropicana Field|ThunderDome]] in [[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]] for three seasons, until their permanent home, [[Amalie Arena]], was built in downtown Tampa.

In 1994 the expansion [[Tampa Bay Tritons]] of [[Roller Hockey International]] played for one season at Expo Hall before folding. [[Mark Messier]] was the owner of the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Brown, Jr. |first=Arthur R. |title=Tritons to make roller hockey home debut |date=June 11, 1994|publisher=Lakeland Ledger|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1346&amp;dat=19940611&amp;id=5bwwAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=hfwDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6866,151272 |page=3D |accessdate=2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Noteworthy entertainers to perform in concert at Expo Hall include [[Robert Plant]], [[REO Speedwagon]], [[Cheap Trick]], [[No Doubt]], [[Green Day]], [[Nine Inch Nails]], [[Peter Frampton]], [[Stone Temple Pilots]], [[Yes (band)|Yes]], [[George Michael]], [[Santana (band)|Santana]], [[Beastie Boys]], [[Alabama (band)|Alabama]], [[Motörhead]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Expo Hall Tampa Concert Setlists|url=http://www.setlist.fm/venue/florida-state-fairgrounds-expo-hall-tampa-fl-usa-73d65aed.htmll|accessdate=31 March 2017|publisher=www.setlist.fm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BLACK-BASS FLOAT-TUBE.JPG|right|thumb|300px|An angler in a float tube catching a [[black bass]]]]

A '''float tube''', also known as a '''belly boat''' or '''kick boat''', is a small, lightweight inflatable fishing craft which [[angling|anglers]] use to fish from. They were originally doughnut-shaped boats with an underwater seat in the "hole", but modern designs include a V-shape with [[Pontoon (boat)|pontoons]] on either side and the seat raised above the water allowing the legs of the angler to be the only part of his body to be submerged. Float tubes are used for many aspects of fishing, such as [[flyfishing]] for [[trout]] or [[Fishing lure|lure fishing]] for [[largemouth bass]], and enable the angler to fish areas otherwise not fishable from the bank.

Float tubes are either "U", "V"-shaped, or circular. A standard float tube consists of an inflated bladder inside a sewn cover providing the seat, reserve air compartments, and tackle storage pockets. Many float tube anglers customize their crafts with rod holders, lights, and electronic [[fishfinder|fish finders]].

==Details==
[[File:Float-tube-pikeangler.jpg|left|thumb|Playing a [[Esox|pike]]]] 

The angler generally wears stocking foot chest [[Hip boot|waders]] and scuba diving [[Swimfin|flippers]], so his legs remain dry. Seated in the float tube, he paddles across the water with a gentle movement of the flippers, then remains still over the chosen fishing ground. An alternative to diving flippers is the "paddle-pusher", or "duck fins." These fins strap onto the angler's feet and have paddles situated on the outsides of the ankles. The paddles fold back when the leg moves forward and open when the leg moves back, allowing anglers to move forward in a somewhat less efficient but more natural walking-type motion.

The competitive side of float tubing for bass is growing in the US with the Sonoma County Belly Boat Bass Club which was the first of its kind and is by far the largest in the world and in South Africa with [http://www.basschallenge.co.za The Bass Challenge] which offers a tournament trail called the Kickboat Bass Challenge for bass anglers who compete from float tubes.

==Safety==
Anglers fishing from a float tube should wear a [[personal flotation device]] (a requirement in some states), as float tubes are susceptible to punctures. Additionally, most manufacturers do not recommend using float tubes in moving waters, such as rivers or streams.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4269">'''Frank Nasworthy''' is notable in the history of skateboarding for introducing [[polyurethane]] wheel technology to the sport in the early 1970s.

After graduating from Annandale High School in Northern Virginia in 1969, Nasworthy attended [[Virginia Tech]] for a year. Back with his family for the summer of 1970, he visited a plastics factory in Purcellville called Creative Urethane, owned by a friend’s father. The factory had experimented with a polyurethane roller skate wheel that was sold to Roller Sports Inc., which supplied wheels for rental skates at roller rinks. The rationale was that a softer wheel with improved grip would help novice roller skaters, but the wheel was largely rejected by roller skaters who favored the hard steel wheels that allowed for faster speeds on the wooden floors of the roller rinks.

Up to this point, skateboards had also been manufactured with either the same steel wheels as [[rollerskates]], or out of a clay composite – a combination of plastic, paper, and finely ground [[walnut]] shells.&lt;ref name="Davidson"&gt;Davidson, J (1985) Sport and Modern Technology. The Rise of Skateboarding, 1963–1978, Journal of Popular Culture, 18 (4) pp145-157.&lt;/ref&gt; These wheels wore out far too quickly, in as little as seven or eight hours.&lt;ref name="Davidson" /&gt;

Nasworthy moved to [[Southern California]] in 1971 to [[surfing|surf]], and noticed that kids were trying to skateboard when the surf was down. He thought the soft polyurethane wheels would be ideal for skateboards, and had his father send him 10 sets. Assembling them onto his skateboard, he discovered they allowed for a much smoother ride that was fast and controllable. Having realized the potential of a [[Skateboard#Wheels|polyurethane skateboard wheel]], Nasworthy invested $700, which he had accumulated working in a restaurant, and formed the Cadillac Wheels Company (on account of their smooth ride).&lt;ref name="Pileggi"&gt;Pileggi, S (September 1, 1975) “Wheeling and Dealing”, [[Sports Illustrated]], pp22-24.&lt;/ref&gt; Creative Urethane made the wheels to his specifications, and Nasworthy took his company to [[California]] in 1972.

Due to the infancy of skateboarding at this time, Nasworthy sold his wheels directly to surf shops along the coast of California, and placed some tentative advertisements featuring a young [[Gregg Weaver]] in surfing magazines. News of the wheels initially spread by word of mouth, but the cumulative effect was a reawakening of skateboarding to the extent that, by 1975, scores of manufacturers had entered the market, a national magazine, Skateboarder, had re-formed and Nasworthy was selling 300,000 sets of wheels per year.&lt;ref name="Roberts"&gt;Roberts, T (July 5, 1976) “On The Move”, People Magazine, pp32-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nasworthy decided to license his wheels to Bahne and Co. of [[Encinitas, California]] and Bahne skateboards were packaged with Cadillac wheels. During 1975, the company reported sales of 10,000,000–20,000,000 skateboards per month.&lt;ref name="Davidson" /&gt; Nasworthy's association with Bahne led him to commission a series of paintings by poster artist [[Jim Evans (artist)|Jim Evans]] that featured Cadillac Wheels. The posters, with titles like, "From Out of the West" and "Accept No Substitutes" came to represent the paradigm shift taking place in skateboarding.

This success did not last long, as Nasworthy’s innovation was soon overtaken by the introduction of a precision [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearing]] skateboard wheel, the Road Rider. But Nasworthy’s discovery was the catalyst for the second skateboard boom. As a professional [[freestyle skateboarding|freestyle]] competitor at the time noted:

:''The progress of the urethane [sic] wheels just totally stoked me; you could do so much more on a skateboard, surf moves, especially; you could carve your turns and stuff without sliding, that changed everything a lot''.&lt;ref name="Davidson" /&gt;

The '''Gold Coast Parklands''' was a complex serving the grey hound and harness racing industries on the [[Gold Coast, Queensland]], Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Parklands Gold Coast&lt;/ref&gt; It opened on 7 December 1988 on the corner of Smith Street and Parklands Drive, Southport on the Gold Coast, Queensland at a cost of nine million dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper = The Gold Coast Bulletin | location = Southport | page = 56 | date = 25–26 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Plans to build the complex began in 1983 when the Racing Minister for Queensland, Mr Russell Hinze, visited the Gold Coast.  He was reportedly disappointed by trotting and grey hound racing facilities at Owen Park, Southport.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Gleeson | first = Peter | title = Politicians paw over Parklands showgrounds | newspaper = The Gold Coast Bulletin | page = 58 | date = 25 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was made to provide improved facilities at another location and State Government land and was selected opposite [[Griffith University]].
 
The complex was managed by the Parklands Trust and was the home for a number of organisations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Kane | first = Charmaine | last2 = Lewis | first2 = David | title = Games athletes' village to oust community groups | publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation | date = 5 April 2013  | url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-04-05/games-athletes-village-to-oust-community-groups/4611386 | accessdate = 3 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; including the [[Gold Coast Show Society]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=February 21st, 2013 by admin. |url=http://www.goldcoastshow.com.au |title=Home 2014 |publisher=Gold Coast Show |date=2013-02-21 |accessdate=2014-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gold Coast Greyhound Racing]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Wilson | first = Terry  | title = Avid fans in mourning for final race of greyhounds : It's a dog gone shame | newspaper = The Gold Coast Bulletin | page = 89 | date = 30 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Parklands Indoor Sports Centre]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parklandsindoor.com/index.htm |title=Parklands Indoor Sports Centre |publisher=Parklandsindoor.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Gold Coast Harness Racing Club]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harnessracingqueensland.com/clubs/gold-coast.aspx |title=Harness Racing QLD |publisher=Harnessracingqueensland.com |date=2014-02-13 |accessdate=2014-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Roots | first = Chris | title = Parklands closure offers a new dawn for Coast | newspaper = The Sun Herald Sydney | location = Sydney | page = 51 | date = 29 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Gleeson | first = Peter | title = Greys dogged by rough trot | newspaper = The Gold Coast Bulletin | page = 47 | date = 3 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Between 1993 and 2013 it was also the venue for the annual [[Big Day Out]] concert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper = The Gold Coast Bulletin | location = Southport | page = 13 | date = 10 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | title = Parklands fears losing its biggest earner | newspaper = The Gold Coast Bulletin | date = 24 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2007, The State Government announced plans to build a new hospital adjacent to the complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper = The Gold Coast Bulletin | location = Southport | page = 56 | date = 25–26 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This resulted in the departure of [[Gold Coast Greyhound Racing]] from Parklands in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Hickson | first = Kate  | title = Anger as greyhound track goes to the dogs | newspaper = The Gold Coast Sun | page = 9 | date = 22 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Cameron | first = Peter | title = Patter of greyhounds may yet be heard at Parklands | newspaper = The Gold Coast Bulletin | page = 19 | date = 29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 1 February 2013 the remaining part of the site was formally designated as the athletes' village for the [[2018 Commonwealth Games]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Planning commences for Commonwealth Games Village | publisher = The Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games Corporation (GOLDOC) | date = 1 February 2013 | url = http://www.gc2018.com/?name=Planning-commences-for-Commonwealth-Games-Village | accessdate = 3 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Hurst | first = Daniel | title = Games tick: new board, same decision | newspaper = The Brisbane Times | location = Brisbane | publisher = Fairfax Media | date = 29 May 2012 | url = http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/games-tick-new-board-same-decision-20120529-1zg60.html | accessdate = 3 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was declared a Priority Development Area (PDA) by the [[Government of Queensland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsdip.qld.gov.au/commonwealth-games-village/economic-development-queensland/commonwealth-games-village.html Commonwealth Games Village]&lt;/ref&gt;
In August 2013 a call for stories, memories and photographs from the community to commemorate the history of Parklands was launched.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mygc.com.au/article/entertainment/entertainment-news/38966-help-save-25-years-of-parklands-memories.php Help Save 25 Years of Parklands Memories]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/pages/Parklands-Gold-Coast/295067050507175 Parklands Gold Coast]&lt;/ref&gt; These stories and ephemera relating to the complex were donated to the City of Gold Coast Local Studies Library.

Demolition of the buildings on the site commenced in late 2013 and in December 2013 [[Grocon]] won the contract to build the village.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Wilmot | first = Ben | title = Grocon wins contract to build Games village | newspaper = The Australian  | date = 17 December 2013 | url = http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/property/grocon-wins-contract-to-build-games-village/story-fnko7zi0-1226784457864# | accessdate = 6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Paralympic Games infobox}}
The '''International Paralympic Committee''' ('''IPC'''; {{lang-de|Internationales Paralympisches Komitee}}) is an international non-profit organisation and the global governing body for the Paralympic Movement. The IPC organizes the [[Paralympic Games]] and functions as the international federation for nine sports. Founded on 22 September 1989 in Düsseldorf, Germany, its mission is "To enable Paralympic athletes to achieve sporting excellence and inspire and excite the world". Furthermore, the IPC wants to promote the Paralympic values and to create sport opportunities for all persons with a disability, from beginner to elite level.

The IPC has a democratic constitution and structure and is composed of representatives from 176 [[National Paralympic Committee]]s (NPCs), four international organizations of sport for the disabled (IOSDs) and five regional organizations. The IPC's headquarters is located in [[Bonn, Germany]].

On the basis of being able to organize the [[Paralympic Games]] more efficiently and to give the Paralympic Movement one voice, the four international organizations combined under the IOSD founded the International Co-ordination Committee of World Sports Organizations for the Disabled (ICC) in 1982. In the upcoming years, other organizations joined and the need for a democratically guided organization emerged, demanded by the nations participating in the Paralympic Movement. They desired a democratic structure, to improve national and regional representation, which led to the foundation of the IPC as it is known today. The [[1994 Winter Paralympics]], Norway, were the first to be organized by the IPC.

The IPC functions as an umbrella organization, representing several sports and disabilities, in contrast to other international sports organizations for athletes with a disability, which are predominantly limited to a single sport or disability.

The word "Paralympic" derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] preposition "para" ("beside" or "alongside"). and "Olympics". The first connotation connected to the syllable "para" was [[paralysis]] or [[paraplegia]]. But since the Paralympics cover different disability groups and the close association to the Olympic Movement, "para" underlines the existence of both movements side by side.

A fifteen-member Governing Board oversees the IPC between meetings of the General Assembly. Dr. Robert D. Steadward became the first President in 1989. Since 2017, [[Andrew Parsons (sports administrator)|Andrew Parsons]] is President of the IPC.

The number of athletes and nations participating in the Paralympic Games and thus being part of the Paralympic Movement is constantly increasing, along with the audience. Sport for persons with a disability is growing on a national and international level.

==Presidents==
The International Paralympic Committee has had three presidents to date. Its founding president, who presided it from 1989 to 2001, was the Canadian [[Robert Steadward]], who had previously founded the [[Canadian Sports Fund for the Physically Disabled]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paralympic.ca/en/About-Us/Robert-Steadward-builder.html "Robert Steadward, builder"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091225193054/http://www.paralympic.ca/en/About-Us/Robert-Steadward-builder.html |date=25 December 2009 }}, Canadian Paralympic Committee&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded in 2001 by [[Sir Philip Craven|Philip Craven]], a British Paralympian and former President of the [[International Wheelchair Basketball Federation]], who served as President until 2017. Craven was succeeded by Brazil's [[Andrew Parsons (sport administrator)|Andrew Parsons]], IPC Vice President from 2013 to 2017 and a former President of the [[Brazilian Paralympic Committee]].&lt;ref name="GB2017" /&gt;

===The Organizing Committees===
{{see also|Template:OCOG/OCPG}}
In June 2001, the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) and the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) signed an agreement that would ensure that the staging of the [[Paralympic Games]] is automatically included in the [[Bids for Olympic Games|bid for the Olympic Games]].&lt;ref name=agreement&gt;[http://www.paralympic.org/IPC/IPC-IOC_Co-operation.html IPC-IOC Co-operation], The official website of the International Paralympic Committee&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement came into effect at the [[2008 Paralympic Summer Games]] in Beijing, and the [[2010 Paralympic Winter Games]] in Vancouver.

However, the [[Salt Lake Organizing Committee for the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games of 2002|Salt Lake 2002 Organizing Committee]] (SLOC), chose to follow the practice of "one bid, one city" already at the 2002 Games in Salt Lake City, with one [[Organizing Committees for the Olympic Games|Organizing Committee]] for both Games, which was followed up by the 2004 Games in Athens and Beijing in 2008.

The agreement was adjusted in 2003. An extension was signed in June 2006.&lt;ref name=agreement/&gt; A further extension was signed in 2012, valid until 2020. In March 2018, a historic long-term extension was signed establishing a partnership until 2032.

===National Paralympic Committees (NPCs)===
{{main|National Paralympic Committee}}
The [[National Paralympic Committee|NPC]]s receive financial support for the training and development of Paralympic teams, Paralympic athletes and Paralympic hopefuls.

===International Paralympic Sports Federations (IFs)===
{{see also|List of international sport federations#Federations recognized by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC)}}
There are 11 international federations recognized by the IPC, and there are four disability specific organizations, while the IPC itself serves as the international federation for 10 sports.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paralympic.org/IPC/Organization/General_Assembly/International_Sports_Federations.html International Sports Federations], International Paralympic Committee (IPC)
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paralympic.org/IPC/Contacts/IFs/index.html Contacts - International Sports Federations (IFs)], International Paralympic Committee (IPC)&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 November 2016, the IPC officially adopted the "World Para" brand for all sports in which it is the international federation. Sports contested in the Summer Paralympics began using the new branding immediately. For winter sports, whose competitive seasons had already started by the announcement, only the world championships were immediately changed to reflect the new branding; the full switchover did not occur until the 2017–18 season.&lt;ref name="World Para"/&gt;

*[http://www.paralympic.org/dance-sport www.paralympic.org/dance-sport]

;World Para Ice Hockey
Supervises and co-ordinates the [[World Para Ice Hockey Championships]] and other competitions. With the November 2016 rebranding, the official name of the sport was changed from "sledge hockey" to "Para ice hockey". This change was made upon the request of the sport's community, partly due to the word "sledge" having different meanings across languages.&lt;ref name="World Para"/&gt;

Note that the Paralympic versions of some sports have different governing structures than the able-bodied versions of the same sports:
* The remit of World Para Nordic Skiing includes both Para biathlon and Para cross-country skiing; the able-bodied versions of the two disciplines are governed by entirely separate international federations, respectively the [[International Biathlon Union]] (IBU) and [[International Ski Federation]] (FIS).
* Able-bodied Alpine skiing and snowboarding are also governed by FIS. The IPC has distinct governing councils for its versions of the sports.

'''Katajanokan ympärijuoksu''' ('''Skatudden runt''' in [[Swedish language|Swedish]]) is an annual [[running]] event in [[Katajanokka]], [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]]. It is open for everyone who lives in Katajanokka or has relatives living there.

The running event has several categories according to age and sex. Children have separate categories for boys and girls, and are divided into two or three age groups. Adults (which also allows teenagers) have only one category, but results are separate for men and women.

The length of the running varies according to category. Toddlers run once around the inside of a walled-in sporting field. Schoolchildren run around the entire sporting area, younger children once, older children twice. Adults and teenagers run around half of the entire Katajanokka district.

There are no monetary prizes for the event, but winners get [[medal]]s, and the winner of the adults category gets a [[trophy]]. Results are also published in the annual ''Katajanokan kaiku'' magazine.

'''Krešimir Ćosić Hall''' ({{lang-hr|Dvorana Krešimira Ćosića}}) is a multi-use [[indoor arena]] in [[Zadar]], [[Croatia]]. Completed in May 2008, with an official seating capacity of 7,847 with 150 additional VIP seats,&lt;ref&gt;http://peka.visnjik.hr/hr/index.php/objekti/dvorane#velika-glavna-dvorana&lt;/ref&gt; it is used mostly for [[team handball]] and [[basketball]] matches. It was used as one of the venues during the [[2009 World Men's Handball Championship]] and home matches of [[KK Zadar]]. Also, the [[Croatia Davis Cup team]] has played at the arena for the [[2008 Davis Cup World Group Play-offs]] and the [[2016 Davis Cup World Group]] semifinals. The KK Zadar supporter group [[Tornado Zadar]] has their own section of the arena.

As of 3 October 2008, its official name became Krešimir Ćosić Hall, named after the legendary Croatian basketball player [[Krešimir Ćosić]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tportal.hr/sport/kosarka/page/2008/09/24/0094006.html?pos=1 ''Dvorani na Višnjiku ime Krešimira Ćosića''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610175052/http://www.tportal.hr/sport/kosarka/page/2008/09/24/0094006.html?pos=1 |date=2011-06-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Former names of the arena were '''Sportski centar Višnjik''' and '''Arena Zadar'''. The arena's nickname is "Peka".&lt;ref&gt;The nickname "Peka" may refer to the fact that the first event held in the arena was a handball qualifying tournament for the 2008 Summer Olympics, which were in [[Peking]].&lt;/ref&gt; For several months during 2008, it was the largest indoor arena in Croatia, and now it is the third largest.

'''MLS International Roster Slots''' are an important piece of roster composition in [[Major League Soccer]]. MLS employs a variety of mechanisms to promote parity and domestic player development which include player entry drafts, expansion drafts, allocation drafts, weighted lotteries, and a limit on the number of international roster slots available for each club. The limit on the number of international roster slots makes each slot a valuable commodity for clubs to utilize through player signings or trades with other clubs.

The MLS roster rules for 2018 state:
* A total of 184 international roster spots are divided among the 23 clubs. These spots are tradable, such that some clubs may have more than eight and some clubs may have fewer than eight. There is no limit on the number of international roster spots on each club's roster. The remaining roster spots must be filled by domestic players.
* For clubs based in the United States, a domestic player is either:
** a U.S. citizen;
** a permanent resident (green card holder); or
** the holder of other special status (e.g., has been granted refugee or asylum status); or
** a player who qualifies under the Homegrown International Rule.
* For clubs based in Canada, a domestic player is either:
** a Canadian citizen; or
** the holder of certain other special status (e.g., has been granted refugee or asylum status); or
** a player who qualifies under the Homegrown International Rule; or
** a U.S. Domestic Player.
* MLS clubs based in Canada are required to have a minimum of three Canadian Domestic Players on their rosters.
* Homegrown International Rule: regardless of nationality, any player who meets the requirements to qualify as a [[Homegrown Player Rule (Major League Soccer)|Homegrown Player]] as a member of an MLS club academy, either in the U.S. or Canada, or has met similar requirements as a member of a Canadian Approved Youth Club, will count as a domestic player on both U.S. and Canadian club rosters provided that:
** the player became a member of an MLS club academy, either in the U.S. or Canada, or a Canadian Approved Youth Club in the year prior to the year in which he turns 16; and
** the player signs his first professional contract with MLS or an MLS club's USL affiliate.

'''Max-Schmeling-Halle''' is a multi-purpose [[arena]], in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]], named after the famous German boxer [[Max Schmeling]]. Apart from the [[Velodrom]], it's one of Berlin's biggest indoor sports arenas and holds from 8,861 people, up to 12,000 people.

The opening ceremony happened on December 14, 1996, in the presence of Max Schmeling.

==Location==
The Max-Schmeling-Halle is situated in the former border area of Berlin, near the Mauerpark and directly next to the [[Friedrich Ludwig Jahn Sportpark]]. It's situated at the Falkplatz, in the district [[Prenzlauer Berg]] (borough [[Pankow]]).

==Use==
Planned for the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] as a pure box gym, it was rebuilt (after the games were awarded to Sydney as the venue) to a multi-functional gym and is now primarily used for [[boxing]] and [[team handball]] and is the home arena of [[Füchse Berlin Reinickendorf HBC|Füchse Berlin HBC]] and the Berlin Mini Basketball Tournament (berliner-mini-turnier.de).

On 9 May 2001, Irish vocal pop band [[Westlife]] held a concert for their [[Where Dreams Come True Tour]] supporting their album [[Coast to Coast (Westlife album)|Coast to Coast]].

[[World Wrestling Entertainment]] was there twice, in April 2005 and 2006.

'''Super Chexx®''' is a [[table hockey games|table hockey]] arcade game manufactured by Innovative Concepts in Entertainment, Inc. (ICE) from 1988 to 2017.&lt;ref&gt;ICE. [http://www.icegame.com/p-4-super-chexx.aspx Super Chexx]&lt;/ref&gt;  ICE began manufacturing CHEXX bubble hockey in 1982 and it quickly became one of the top-earning bar and arcade games of the 1980s.  Enhancements to the game were added and it was renamed Super Chexx in 1988 and it continued to be popular in bars and arcades and received national acclaim during the Bud Light Bubble Boys tournament series from 1999-2001.  In November 2017 Super Chexx was replaced with the Super Chexx Pro edition using enhanced electronics featuring a 5" LCD jumbotron and LED lighting.  Super Chexx Pro is still made in the USA in [[Clarence, New York]] just outside [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]].  These types of games are also known as bubble hockey, rod hockey, table hockey or dome hockey because of the long rods used to control the players and the distinctive dome or "bubble" covering the playing field.

The game can be played by two opposing players who control all five hockey players and the goalie for their side (singles) or as a two on two game (doubles). Players control their five skaters with long rods that move in and out to bring skaters up and down the ice and spin 360 degrees.  A knob is used to move the goalie from side to side.  Each player also a "boo button" to simulate sounds from the crowd.

Vintage versions of Super Chexx feature the USA vs. Russia, Canada vs. Russia, or USA vs. Canada formats. In 2010 ICE introduced a Deluxe Home version of the game with no coin doors and started offering [[NHL]] and [[American Hockey League|AHL]] licensed team versions. There is also a 30th Anniversary "Miracle on Ice" Edition of the game featuring the classic USA vs CCCP teams licensed through USA Hockey. Licensed games feature team colors and logos with custom hand-painted players in replica jerseys.

The early versions of the game were made with blue bases, but most of the games are now made with red bases. The first black bases were made for a Bubble Boys Tournament with Wayne Gretzky and Bud Light in 1999. There was a limited edition of 100 games with black bases made in 2005. A further limited edition with the black base was made in 2007.  The home version of the game has a base which can be split and hinged to fit through narrow doorways and comes in red or black.

== Fans and tournaments==
Many areas of the US have local fan sites and tournaments. Owners are known to customize their games with hand painted players representing their favorite NHL Teams (and players) and their  rivals. As of the last 4 years, Labatt Blue has partnered with the AHL and run a tournament of champions. Each year, the venue is a different AHL city. So far It has been in Hershey PA, Albany NY, Utica NY, and this year Glens Falls NY. With 11 different AHL teams participating with 8 qualifiers, leading to an eventual 8 person tournament to win their team. The 11 winners all meet at the years Newest venue to settle who the champion will be. Considered the largest tournament ever, with over 1,000 players per year, Jeremy Davis has won twice, and Ken Dubois has won once. ICE organized an Official Super Chexx World Championship in 2010. 128 players entered - the tournament was won by John Gaffney of Burlington NJ, the official World Champion.  Other tournaments are held locally throughout the United States and Canada each year. The KONY (later KONE) Tournaments were held annually from 2001 to 2005. NJbubblehockey.org ran tournaments from 2005 to 2014 and contributed to crowning a champion in the United States every year.  The International Bubble Hockey Federation (IBHL) held a large national Super Chexx tournament in March 2006 with over 40 participants.  This was at the time the largest tournament in Bubble Hockey history.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}  The event was repeated on March 9–10 in 2007 with over 60 players competing over 2 days. Jeremy Davis of Milford CT was the winner and is considered the best bubble hockey player in the world (2014).

In a suit against ICE, the manufacturers of Super Chexx were not give TRADE DRESS for the white and black bubble hockey it was awarded to ASAA.  The ASAA Bubble Hockey had thinner base to go through any door way and was slightly taller.  The first NHL bubble hockey games designed in 1996 can still be found in use today at the [[Wells Fargo Center (Philadelphia)|Wells Fargo Center]] in Philadelphia.

'''T. Davis''' (first name, birth and death details unknown) refers to a noted amateur [[cricket]]er in the 18th century who made seven known appearances for [[Hampshire county cricket teams]] between 1773 and 1776 in the era of the [[Hambledon Club]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Players/79/79336/79336.html |title=CricketArchive record of T Davis |work=cricketarchive.co.uk |accessdate=10 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The full span of his career is uncertain because he was almost certainly active before cricket's ''statistical record'' began in 1772.  He was probably an early member of the Hambledon Club, believed to have been founded about 1765, but little is known of him apart from what can be gleaned from surviving scorecards.

Davis was primarily a batsman who scored a known total of 115 runs in 11 innings with a highest score of 40.  He has not been credited with any wickets.  He took just 2 catches, which suggests he may have been an outfielder.

'''''True Blue: The Oxford Boat Race Mutiny''''' is a [[non-fiction]] [[book]] written by [[Dan Topolski]] and [[Patrick Robinson (author)|Patrick Robinson]] and published in [[1989 in literature|1989]]. It tells the story of the 1987 [[The Boat Race|Oxford-Cambridge Boat Race]] and the disagreement amongst the Oxford crew known as the "Oxford mutiny".&lt;ref name=muti&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/rowing/2310461/When-mutineers-hit-the-Thames.html|title=When mutineers hit the Thames|last=Baker|first=Andrew|date=6 April 2007|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=26 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It won the [[William Hill Sports Book of the Year]] in 1989, the award's inaugural year.

Topolski was Oxford's rowing coach, and the book describes his conflicts with the squad and principally five US international oarsmen who were enrolled that year at Oxford. Disagreements over training methods and crew selection ultimately led to the Americans leaving the crew shortly before the race. With a severely depleted crew, still suffering from the fall-out of the "mutiny", Oxford went on to beat Cambridge in the 1987 Boat Race.

==Reception and other accounts==
The book, and the "mutiny" itself, continue to divide rowers even 29 years afterwards. British Olympic champion oarsman [[Martin Cross]] describes the book as "... one of the most entertaining (if not wholly accurate) sports books ever written ...", and refers to its treatment of one of the American "mutineers", Chris Clark, in the following terms: "As character assassinations go, it is ruthless."&lt;ref&gt;Martin Cross, ''Olympic Obsession: The Inside Story of Britain's Most Successful Sport'', {{ISBN|1-85983-233-4}}, pp 132-133&lt;/ref&gt;

Alison Gill, an Oxford oarswoman at the time of the "mutiny", wrote ''[[The Yanks at Oxford]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|0-86332-662-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; a book that attempted to counter the perceived bias in Topolski's account.

The [[Oxford University Boat Club]] president, Donald Macdonald, broke a 25-year silence to give his own account of the course of events in a 2012 newspaper interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=True Blue Mutiny: Oxford University boat race captain reveals all about the savage feud with both Americans that tore team apart 25 years ago|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2125897/Boat-Race-2012-Oxford-University-captain-reveals-True-Blue-mutiny.html|accessdate=7 April 2012|newspaper=Daily Mail|date=6–7 April 2012|author=Harry Mount}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Waivers''' are a [[National Football League]] (NFL) labor management procedure by which a team makes an [[American football]] player's contract or NFL rights (such as [[NFL draft]] rights to an unsigned player) available to all other teams. During the season (starting July 4 and lasting through the regular season), each team has 24 hours to file a claim for a player that another team has made available through the system or [[waive]] the right to do so. During the off season each team has several days to file such claims. Claiming teams are assigned the rights to or contracts via a priority system based on inverse order of record. Players that pass through waivers unclaimed become [[free agent]]s.&lt;ref name=2NF&amp;RB&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogmedia.thenewstribune.com/media/Roster%20Rules.pdf |title=Waivers |accessdate=September 4, 2008 |work=2006 NFL Fact &amp; Record Book |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910180417/http://blogmedia.thenewstribune.com/media/Roster%20Rules.pdf |archivedate=September 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NWSR&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawgtalkers.net/showflat.php?Cat=0&amp;Number=3076&amp;an=0&amp;page=0|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090910183554/http://www.dawgtalkers.net:80/showflat.php?Cat=0&amp;Number=3076&amp;an=0&amp;page=0|dead-url=yes|archive-date=September 10, 2009|title=NFL WAIVER SYSTEM/RULES  |accessdate=September 4, 2008|date=September 14, 2006|publisher=Dawgtalkers.net|work=Dawg Talkers Message Boards}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Waiver claims are irrevocable.&lt;ref name=2NF&amp;RB/&gt;

NFL clubs are prohibited from contacting waived players until the player has been released by the club after passing waivers.&lt;ref name=NWSR/&gt;

{{asof|2008}}, at the conclusion of a season in which a veteran with four years of service is claimed via waivers, veterans with a [[no-trade clause]] in their contracts may declare themselves free agents.  Any other veteran with four years of service can declare himself an free agent at the conclusion of the season after the season in which they were claimed on waivers if they remain under a claimed contract.&lt;ref name=NWSR/&gt;&lt;ref name=2NF&amp;RB/&gt;

A player who clears waivers and becomes a free agent is free to negotiate and sign a contract with any NFL club, and any NFL club is free to negotiate and sign a contract with such player.  There is no penalty or restriction for signing a free agent who has cleared waivers. For example, Draft Choice Compensation between Clubs or First Refusal Rights of any kind, and signing period restrictions are not applicable.&lt;ref name=NWSR/&gt;{{update after|2011|12|13}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2854">The '''Winnipeg Auditorium''' was an indoor arena in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]], [[Canada]]. It was the premier site for [[ice hockey]] in Winnipeg from the time of its construction in 1898. The Auditorium rink hosted several [[Stanley Cup]] championship series. It was located at the intersection of Garry Street and York Avenue. It was destroyed by fire in 1926.

==Construction==
By 1898, the sport of ice hockey had become popular as both a participation sport and spectator sport in Winnipeg. Until this time, most ice hockey had been played on the rinks of curling clubs in Winnipeg. The Auditorium was built at a cost of about $20,000. Construction was financed by a group of very prominent businessmen, among them E. L. Drewry, proprietor of the Redwood and Empire Brewery, F. W. Stobart of Stobart and Sons (dry goods), J. H. Ashdown of Ashdown's Hardware, and A. M. Nanton, partner in the financial firm of Osler, Hammond, and Nanton.&lt;ref name="Mott"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/mb_history/43/hockeyhistory.shtml |title="An Immense Hold in the Public Estimation:" The First Quarter Century of Hockey in Manitoba, 1886-1911 |last=Mott |first=Morris |year=2002 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wood structure held an ice surface measuring {{Convert|200|ft|m}} by {{Convert|80|ft|m}}, following the regulation size of the [[Victoria Rink]] in [[Montreal]]. The Auditorium could seat about 2000 spectators for hockey, plus standing room. Over the years it was renovated and expanded to hold over 3500. The facility also contained a coat check room, a ladies' room and four or five dressing rooms. In the basement, under the ice, were four bowling alleys.&lt;ref name="Mott" /&gt;

==Usage==
The arena was used primarily for ice hockey but also hosted professional boxing until it was destroyed by fire in 1926. In 1931, a new "Winnipeg Civic Auditorium" was constructed. This was not a sports venue, but a music and theatre space. The [[Shea's Amphitheatre]], constructed in 1909, seating 5000, served Winnipeg until the construction of the [[Winnipeg Arena]] in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="Mott" /&gt;

The arena was used by the [[Manitoba Hockey Association]], as the home rink of the [[Winnipeg Victorias]], [[Winnipeg Hockey Club]] and [[Winnipeg Rowing Club]]. The rink was used in 1902 for a Stanley Cup challenge series between the Victorias and the [[Toronto Wellingtons]]. In 1907, it was used for the Stanley Cup challenge series between the [[Kenora Thistles]] and the [[Montreal Wanderers]].&lt;ref name="Mott" /&gt;
