'''Aquaveo''' is an environmental and water resources [[Computer simulation|modeling software]] company based in [[Provo, Utah]] that develops software used to model and simulate [[groundwater]], [[Drainage basin|watershed]], and [[surface water]] resources.&lt;ref name="ubique 20150529"/&gt; Its main software products include SMS, GMS, WMS, and Arc Hydro Groundwater.

==History==
The Engineering Computer Graphics Laboratory (ECGL) was established in 1985 at [[Brigham Young University]].&lt;ref name="ecgl 19990421"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emrl.byu.edu/|title=Environmental Modeling Research Laboratory|publisher=Engineering Computer Graphics Laboratory at [[Brigham Young University]]|accessdate=March 5, 2018|archivedate=April 21, 1999|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990421051442/http://emrl.byu.edu/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simulation data produced in the lab was critical to ''[[Anderson v. Cryovac, Inc.]]'', a 1986 federal lawsuit concerning toxic contamination of groundwater in [[Woburn, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="desnews 19990402"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/689128/Software-keeps-an-eye-on-invisible-water.html?pg=all |title=Software keeps an eye on 'invisible' water: Provo product monitors ground supply |first=Jerry |last=Spangler |date=2 April 1999 |publisher=''[[Deseret News]]'' |accessdate=25 February 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6fZJi3eUR?url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/689128/Software-keeps-an-eye-on-invisible-water.html?pg=all |archivedate=25 February 2016 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After using another BYU product—Movie BYU—to animate a hydrology problem to make it easier to understand, Norm Jones decided to start work on software that helped engineers visualize problems and solutions.&lt;ref name="byumag fall 2002"/&gt; Use of the tools created by Jones allowed the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] to save "hundreds of thousands of dollars."&lt;ref name="byumag fall 2002"/&gt;

Alan Zundel and James Nelson, two other professors at BYU, also became involved in the process of developing the software in 1991.&lt;ref name="byumag fall 2002"/&gt; By 2002, the company's software was being used in "more than 100 countries and [by] more than 9,000 organizations."&lt;ref name="byumag fall 2002"/&gt; Royd Nelson created Environmental Modeling Systems (EMSI), a private company, in October 1995 to distribute the software created in the ECGL.&lt;ref name="entity emsi"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://secure.utah.gov/bes/details.html?entity=1284924-0142 |title=Entity Search: Environmental Modeling Systems Incorporated |publisher=Division of Corporations and Commercial Code on Utah.gov |accessdate=25 February 2016 |date=29 September 2015 |archivedate=25 February 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6fZKRH8Ih?url=https://secure.utah.gov/bes/details.html?entity=1284924-0142 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the lab was changed in September 1998 to the Environmental Modeling Research Laboratory (EMRL).&lt;ref name="ecgl 19990421"/&gt;

The government of [[India]] used early versions of the software developed by the EMRL to help with finding sources of clean groundwater, setting groundwater policy, and setting a course of action to clean up the contaminated groundwater in their country.&lt;ref name="desnews 19990402"/&gt; State and local governments in Utah and California have used the software to help trace contaminant sources at farms and mining facilities, and to determine how to manage water resources in drier climates like the Los Angeles area.&lt;ref name="desnews 19990402"/&gt;

The planners of the [[2002 Winter Olympics]], held in Salt Lake City, Utah, used the [[Watershed Modeling System]] (WMS) software to simulate terrorist attacks on water infrastructure such as the [[Jordanelle Reservoir]].&lt;ref name="byumag fall 2002"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://magazine.byu.edu/article/modeling-the-worlds-waters/ |title=Modeling the World’s Waters |first=Nathan K. |last=Chai |publisher=''[[BYU Magazine]]'' |date=Fall 2002 |accessdate=25 February 2016 |archivedate=25 February 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6fZPVKbl2?url=http://magazine.byu.edu/article/modeling-the-worlds-waters/ |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2007, a private company named Aquaveo was created to develop the work of the EMRL as commercial products, and the main people at the lab moved to the new company.&lt;ref name="ubique 20150529"/&gt;&lt;ref name="emrl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emrl.byu.edu/ |title=The Environmental Modeling Research Laboratory |publisher=[[Brigham Young University]] |date=3 May 2012 |accessdate=9 September 2013 |archivedate=19 February 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6fQCLUwKg?url=http://emrl.byu.edu/ |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aquaveo-about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aquaveo.com/about-us |title=About Us |publisher=Aquaveo |accessdate=6 August 2013 |archivedate=19 February 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6fQCahpfD?url=http://www.aquaveo.com/about-us |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; EMSI and Aquaveo merged in October 2008, keeping the company name of "Aquaveo".&lt;ref name="merge"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aquaveo.com/merge |title=EMS-I is now Aquaveo! |publisher=Aquaveo |accessdate=25 February 2016 |archivedate=25 February 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6fZLxyGJT?url=http://www.aquaveo.com/merge |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anthropology |types}}
'''Archaeology''', or '''archeology''',&lt;ref name="Society for American Archaeology"/&gt; is the study of human activity through the recovery and [[analysis]] of [[material culture]]. The [[archaeological record]] consists of [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]], [[architecture]], [[biofact (archaeology)|biofacts]] or ecofacts and [[cultural landscapes]]. Archaeology can be considered both a [[social science]] and a branch of the [[humanities]].&lt;ref name="Renfrew_Bahn1991"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author = Sinclair A | year = 2016 | title = The Intellectual Base of Archaeological Research 2004–2013: a visualisation and analysis of its disciplinary links, networks of authors and conceptual language | journal = Internet Archaeology | volume =  | issue = 42| page =  | doi=10.11141/ia.42.8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In North America archaeology is a sub-field of [[anthropology]],&lt;ref name="Haviland_et_al_2005"/&gt; while in Europe it is often viewed as either a discipline in its own right or a sub-field of other disciplines.

Archaeologists study human [[prehistory]] and history, from the development of the first [[stone tool]]s at [[Lomekwi]] in East Africa 3.3 million years ago up until recent decades. Archaeology is distinct from [[palaeontology]], the study of fossil remains. It is particularly important for learning about prehistoric societies, for whom there may be no written records to study. Prehistory includes over 99% of the human past, from the [[Paleolithic]] until the advent of literacy in societies across the world.&lt;ref name="Renfrew_Bahn1991"/&gt; Archaeology has various goals, which range from understanding [[culture history]] to reconstructing past [[lifeway]]s to documenting and explaining changes in human societies through time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=https://www.livescience.com/44448-what-is-archaeology.html|title=What Is Archaeology? {{!}} Archaeology Definition|work=Live Science|access-date=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discipline involves [[Archaeological survey|surveying]], [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] and eventually [[Post excavation|analysis]] of data collected to learn more about the past. In broad scope, archaeology relies on cross-disciplinary research. It draws upon [[anthropology]], [[history]], [[art history]], [[classics]], [[ethnology]], [[geography]], [[geology]], [[History of literature|literary history]], [[linguistics]], [[semiology]], [[textual criticism]], [[physics]], [[information science]]s, [[chemistry]], [[statistics]], [[paleoecology]], [[Palaeography|paleography]], [[paleontology]], [[paleozoology]], and [[paleobotany]].

Archaeology developed out of [[antiquarianism]] in Europe during the 19th century, and has since become a discipline practiced across the world. Archaeology has been used by nation-states to create particular visions of the past.&lt;ref&gt;Christina Bueno, ''The Pursuit of Ruins: Archeology, History, and the Making of Modern Mexico''. Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Since its early development, various specific sub-disciplines of archaeology have developed, including [[maritime archaeology]], [[feminist archaeology]] and [[archaeoastronomy]], and numerous different scientific techniques have been developed to aid archaeological investigation. Nonetheless, today, archaeologists face many problems, such as dealing with [[pseudoarchaeology]], the looting of artifacts,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://openscience.com/a-special-issue-of-open-archaeology-on-non-professional-metal-detecting/ |title=A Special Issue of Open Archaeology on Non-Professional Metal-Detecting  |first=Pablo |last=Markin |work=[[OpenScience]] |date=10 April 2017 |accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a lack of public interest, and opposition to the excavation of human remains.

===Antiquarians===

{{further|History of Chinese archaeology}}
The science of archaeology (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἀρχαιολογία}}, ''archaiologia'' from {{lang|grc|ἀρχαῖος}}, ''arkhaios'', "ancient" and {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''-logia'', "[[-logy]]")&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=archaeology|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=archaeology|work=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; grew out of the older multi-disciplinary study known as antiquarianism. Antiquarians studied [[history]] with particular attention to ancient artifacts and manuscripts, as well as historical sites. Antiquarianism focused on the empirical evidence that existed for the understanding of the past, encapsulated in the motto of the 18th-century antiquary, Sir [[Richard Colt Hoare]], "We speak from facts not theory". Tentative steps towards the systematization of archaeology as a [[science]] took place during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment era]] in Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://archaeology.about.com/od/historyofarchaeology/a/history_series.htm|last=Hirst|first=K. Kris|title=The History of Archaeology: How Ancient Relic Hunting Became Science|work=ThoughtCo|date=9 February 2017|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, philosophical interest in the remains of [[Ancient Greece|Greco]]-[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] civilization and the rediscovery of classical culture began in the late [[Middle Age]]. [[Flavio Biondo]], an Italian [[Renaissance humanism|Renaissance humanist]] historian, created a systematic guide to the ruins and [[topography of ancient Rome]] in the early 15th century, for which he has been called an early founder of archaeology. Antiquarians of the 16th century, including [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]] and [[William Camden]], conducted surveys of the English countryside, drawing, describing and interpreting the monuments that they encountered.

===First excavations===
[[File:stonehenge 1877.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.15|alt=old photograph of stonehenge with toppled stones|An early photograph of Stonehenge taken July 1877]]
One of the first sites to undergo archaeological excavation was [[Stonehenge]] and other [[Megalith|megalithic monuments]] in England. [[John Aubrey]] (1626–1697) was a pioneer archaeologist who recorded numerous [[megalith]]ic and other [[Ancient monument|field monuments]] in southern England. He was also ahead of his time in the analysis of his findings. He attempted to chart the chronological stylistic evolution of handwriting, medieval architecture, costume, and shield-shapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Michael |last=Hunter |authorlink=Michael Hunter (historian) |title=John Aubrey and the Realm of Learning |place=London |publisher=Duckworth |year=1975|isbn=978-0-7156-0818-0|pages=156–57, 162–66, 181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Excavations were also carried out in the ancient towns of [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]], both of which had been covered by ash during the [[Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79]]. These excavations began in 1748 in Pompeii, while in Herculaneum they began in 1738. The discovery of entire towns, complete with utensils and even human shapes, as well the unearthing of [[fresco]]s, had a big impact throughout Europe.

However, prior to the development of modern techniques, excavations tended to be haphazard; the importance of concepts such as [[Stratification (archaeology)|stratification]] and [[Archaeological context|context]] were overlooked.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dorothy King]], ''The Elgin Marbles'' (Hutchinson, January 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development of archaeological method===
[[File:Both Lozenges.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Artifacts discovered at the 1808 [[Bush Barrow]] excavation by Sir [[Richard Colt Hoare]] and [[William Cunnington]].]]
The father of archaeological excavation was [[William Cunnington]] (1754–1810). He undertook excavations in [[Wiltshire]] from around 1798,&lt;ref&gt;Everill, P. 2010. The Parkers of Heytesbury: Archaeological pioneers. Antiquaries Journal 90: 441–53&lt;/ref&gt; funded by Sir [[Richard Colt Hoare]]. Cunnington made meticulous recordings of [[Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age]] [[tumulus|barrows]], and the terms he used to categorize and describe them are still used by archaeologists today.&lt;ref&gt;Everill, P. 2009. Invisible Pioneers. British Archaeology 108: 40–43&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the major achievements of 19th-century archaeology was the development of [[stratigraphy]]. The idea of overlapping strata tracing back to successive periods was borrowed from the new [[geology|geological]] and [[palaeontology|paleontological]] work of scholars like [[William Smith (geologist)|William Smith]], [[James Hutton]] and [[Charles Lyell]]. The application of stratigraphy to archaeology first took place with the excavations of [[Prehistory|prehistorical]] and [[Bronze Age]] sites. In the third and fourth decades of the 19th-century, archaeologists like [[Jacques Boucher de Perthes]] and [[Christian Jürgensen Thomsen]] began to put the artifacts they had found in chronological order.

A major figure in the development of archaeology into a rigorous science was the army officer and [[ethnology|ethnologist]], [[Augustus Pitt Rivers]],&lt;ref&gt;Bowden, Mark (1984) ''General Pitt Rivers: The father of scientific archaeology''. [[Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum]]. {{ISBN|0-947535-00-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; who began excavations on his land in England in the 1880s. His approach was highly methodical by the standards of the time, and he is widely regarded as the first scientific archaeologist. He [[Pitt Rivers Museum|arranged his artifacts]] by type or "[[Typology (archaeology)|typologically]], and within types by date or "chronologically". This style of arrangement, designed to highlight the evolutionary trends in human artifacts, was of enormous significance for the accurate dating of the objects. His most important methodological innovation was his insistence that ''all'' artifacts, not just beautiful or unique ones, be collected and catalogued.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Dan|last=Hicks|year=2013|chapter=Characterizing the World Archaeology Collections of the Pitt Rivers Museum|title=World Archaeology at the Pitt Rivers Museum: a characterization|publisher=Archaeopress|location=Oxford|editor1-first=Dan|editor1-last=Hicks|editor2-first=Alice|editor2-last=Stevenson|chapter-url=http://archaeopress.com/ArchaeopressShop/Public/download.asp?id=%7B64476CB8-7963-40E1-B225-F54DA37A2F9A%7D|isbn=9781905739585}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Flinders Petrie]] is another man who may legitimately be called the Father of Archaeology. His painstaking recording and study of artifacts, both in Egypt and later in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], laid down many of the ideas behind modern archaeological recording; he remarked that "I believe the true line of research lies in the noting and comparison of the smallest details." Petrie developed the [[seriation (archaeology)|system of dating layers based on pottery and ceramic findings]], which revolutionized the chronological basis of [[Egyptology]]. Petrie was the first to scientifically investigate the [[Great Pyramid of Giza|Great Pyramid]] in Egypt during the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.pef.org.uk/profiles/sir-william-flinders-petrie-1853-1942|title= Sir William Flinders Petrie|publisher=Palestine Exploration Fund|year=2000|accessdate=19 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also responsible for mentoring and training a whole generation of Egyptologists, including [[Howard Carter]] who went on to achieve fame with the discovery of the tomb of 14th-century BC pharaoh [[Tutankhamun]].

[[File:Aerial photograph of Maiden Castle from the west, 1937.jpg|thumb|left|alt=earthern fort with many walls|[[Mortimer Wheeler]] pioneered [[Wheeler-Kenyon method|systematic excavation]] in the early 20th century. Pictured, are his excavations at [[Maiden Castle, Dorset]], in October 1937.]]
The first stratigraphic excavation to reach wide popularity with public was that of [[Hissarlik]], on the site of ancient [[Troy]], carried out by [[Heinrich Schliemann]], [[Frank Calvert]] and [[Wilhelm Dörpfeld]] in the 1870s. These scholars individuated nine different cities that had overlapped with one another, from prehistory to the [[Hellenistic period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=http://www.thegreatcourses.com/tgc/courses/course_detail.aspx?cid=363| title=Great Ancient Civilizations of Asia Minor| first=Kenneth W.| last=Harl| accessdate=23 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the work of Sir [[Arthur Evans]] at [[Knossos]] in [[Crete]] revealed the ancient existence of an equally advanced [[Minoan civilization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Joseph Alexander|last=MacGillivray|title=Minotaur: Sir Arthur Evans and the Archaeology of the Minoan Myth|location=New York|publisher=Hill and Wang (Farrar, Straus and Giroux)|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next major figure in the development of archaeology was Sir [[Mortimer Wheeler]], whose highly disciplined approach to excavation and systematic coverage in the 1920s and 1930s brought the science on swiftly. Wheeler developed the [[Wheeler-Kenyon method|grid system of excavation]], which was further improved by his student [[Kathleen Kenyon]].

Archaeology became a professional activity in the first half of the 20th century, and it became possible to study archaeology as a subject in universities and even schools. By the end of the 20th century nearly all professional archaeologists, at least in developed countries, were graduates. Further adaptation and innovation in archaeology continued in this period, when [[maritime archaeology]] and [[urban archaeology]] became more prevalent and [[rescue archaeology]] was developed as a result of increasing commercial development.&lt;ref name="Renfrew_Bahn1991#5"&gt;Renfrew and Bahn (2004 [1991]:33–35)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
[[File:Australopithecus africanus - Cast of taung child.jpg|thumb|Cast of the skull of the [[Taung child]], uncovered in [[South Africa]]. The Child was an infant of the ''[[Australopithecus africanus]]'' species, an early form of [[hominin]]]]
The purpose of archaeology is to learn more about past societies and the development of the [[human race]]. Over 99% of the development of humanity has occurred within [[prehistory|prehistoric cultures]], who did not make use of [[literacy|writing]], thereby no written records exist for study purposes. Without such written sources, the only way to understand prehistoric societies is through archaeology. Because archaeology is the study of past human activity, it stretches back to about 2.5 million years ago when we find the first stone tools – [[Oldowan|The Oldowan Industry]]. Many important developments in human history occurred during prehistory, such as the [[human evolution|evolution of humanity]] during the [[Paleolithic]] period, when the [[hominin]]s developed from the [[australopithecines]] in [[Africa]] and eventually into modern ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. Archaeology also sheds light on many of humanity's technological advances, for instance the ability to use fire, the development of [[stone tool]]s, the discovery of [[metallurgy]], the beginnings of [[religion]] and the creation of [[agriculture]]. Without archaeology, we would know little or nothing about the use of material culture by humanity that pre-dates writing.&lt;ref name="ncl"/&gt;

However, it is not only prehistoric, pre-literate cultures that can be studied using archaeology but historic, literate cultures as well, through the sub-discipline of [[historical archaeology]]. For many literate cultures, such as [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Mesopotamia]], their surviving records are often incomplete and biased to some extent. In many societies, literacy was restricted to the [[elite]] classes, such as the [[clergy]] or the [[bureaucracy]] of court or temple. The literacy even of [[aristocracy|aristocrats]] has sometimes been restricted to deeds and contracts. The interests and world-view of elites are often quite different from the lives and interests of the populace. Writings that were produced by people more representative of the general population were unlikely to find their way into [[library|libraries]] and be preserved there for posterity. Thus, written records tend to reflect the biases, assumptions, cultural values and possibly deceptions of a limited range of individuals, usually a small fraction of the larger population. Hence, written records cannot be trusted as a sole source. The material record may be closer to a fair representation of society, though it is subject to its own biases, such as [[sampling bias]] and [[differential preservation]].&lt;ref name="archaeological"/&gt;

Often, archaeology provides the only means to learn of the existence and behaviors of people of the past. Across the millennia many thousands of cultures and societies and billions of people have come and gone of which there is little or no written record or existing records are misrepresentative or incomplete. Writing as it is known today did not exist in human civilization until the 4th millennium BC, in a relatively small number of technologically advanced civilizations. In contrast, ''Homo sapiens'' has existed for at least 200,000 years, and other species of ''Homo'' for millions of years (see [[Human evolution]]). These civilizations are, not coincidentally, the best-known; they are open to the inquiry of historians for centuries, while the study of pre-historic cultures has arisen only recently. Even within a literate civilization many events and important human practices are not officially recorded. Any knowledge of the early years of human civilization – the development of agriculture, cult practices of folk religion, the rise of the first cities – must come from archaeology.

In addition to their scientific importance, archaeological remains sometimes have political or cultural significance to descendants of the people who produced them, monetary value to collectors, or simply strong aesthetic appeal. Many people identify archaeology with the recovery of such aesthetic, religious, political, or economic treasures rather than with the reconstruction of past societies.

This view is often espoused in works of popular fiction, such as Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Mummy, and King Solomon's Mines. When such unrealistic subjects are treated more seriously, accusations of pseudoscience are invariably levelled at their proponents ''(see [[Pseudoarchaeology]])''. However, these endeavours, real and fictional, are not representative of modern archaeology.

===Theory===
{{main|Archaeological theory}}
[[File:Archeologists sign at Lubbock Lake Monument IMG 1591.JPG|upright=0.9|right|thumb|alt=Archaeologists dig in the dirt very carefully so they won't miss anything important. |Sign at [[Lubbock Lake Landmark]] in [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]], [[Texas]]]]

There is no one approach to archaeological theory that has been adhered to by all archaeologists. When archaeology developed in the late 19th century, the first approach to archaeological theory to be practiced was that of [[cultural-history archaeology]], which held the goal of explaining why cultures changed and adapted rather than just highlighting the fact that they did, therefore emphasizing [[historical particularism]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; In the early 20th century, many archaeologists who studied past societies with direct continuing links to existing ones (such as those of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], [[Siberia]]ns, [[Mesoamerica]]ns etc.) followed the [[direct historical approach]], compared the continuity between the past and contemporary ethnic and cultural groups.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; In the 1960s, an archaeological movement largely led by American archaeologists like [[Lewis Binford]] and [[Kent Flannery]] arose that rebelled against the established cultural-history archaeology.&lt;ref name="Binford1962"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Flannery1967"/&gt; They proposed a "New Archaeology", which would be more "scientific" and "anthropological", with [[hypothesis]] testing and the [[scientific method]] very important parts of what became known as [[processual archaeology]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

In the 1980s, a new [[postmodern]] movement arose led by the British archaeologists [[Michael Shanks (archaeologist)|Michael Shanks]],&lt;ref name="Shanks_Tilley1987"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shanks_Tilley1988"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shanks1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shanks1993"/&gt; [[Christopher Tilley]],&lt;ref name="Tilley1993"/&gt; [[Daniel Miller (anthropologist)|Daniel Miller]],&lt;ref name="Miller_Tilley1984"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller_etal1989"/&gt; and [[Ian Hodder]],&lt;ref name="Hodder1982"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hodder1985"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hodder1987"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hodder1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hodder1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hodder1992"/&gt; which has become known as [[post-processual archaeology]]. It questioned processualism's appeals to scientific positivism and impartiality, and emphasized the importance of a more self-critical theoretical [[reflexivity (social theory)|reflexivity]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} However, this approach has been criticized by processualists as lacking scientific rigor, and the validity of both processualism and post-processualism is still under debate. Meanwhile, another theory, known as [[historical processualism]] has emerged seeking to incorporate a focus on process and post-processual archaeology's emphasis of reflexivity and history.&lt;ref name="Pauketat2001"/&gt;

Archaeological theory now borrows from a wide range of influences, including [[evolution|neo-evolutionary thought]],&lt;ref name="Hinshaw2000"/&gt;[[#cite note-Hinshaw2000-35|&lt;span class="mw-reflink-text"&gt;[35]&lt;/span&gt;]] [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[postmodernism]], [[Structure and agency|agency theory]], [[Cognitive archaeology|cognitive science]], [[structural functionalism]], [[Gender archaeology|gender-based]] and [[feminist archaeology]], and [[systems theory in archaeology|systems theory]].

==Methods==
[[File:Indusketa arkeologikoa.webm|thumb|Video showing the different works in an archaeological recovery and analysis]]
An archaeological investigation usually involves several distinct phases, each of which employs its own variety of methods. Before any practical work can begin, however, a clear objective as to what the archaeologists are looking to achieve must be agreed upon. This done, a site is [[Archaeological survey|surveyed]] to find out as much as possible about it and the surrounding area. Second, an excavation may take place to uncover any archaeological features buried under the ground. And, third, the data collected from the excavation is studied and evaluated in an attempt to achieve the original research objectives of the archaeologists. It is then considered good practice for the information to be published so that it is available to other archaeologists and historians, although this is sometimes neglected.&lt;ref name="renfrew"/&gt;

===Remote sensing===
Before actually starting to dig in a location, [[Remote sensing (archaeology)|remote sensing]] can be used to look where sites are located within a large area or provide more information about sites or regions. There are two types of remote sensing instruments—passive and active. Passive instruments detect natural energy that is reflected or emitted from the observed scene. Passive instruments sense only radiation emitted by the object being viewed or reflected by the object from a source other than the instrument. Active instruments emit energy and record what is reflected. [[Satellite imagery]] is an example of passive remote sensing. Here are two active remote sensing instruments:

'''[[Lidar]]''' (Light Detection and Ranging)
A lidar uses a laser (light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation) to transmit a light pulse and a receiver with sensitive detectors to measure the backscattered or reflected light. Distance to the object is determined by recording the time between the transmitted and backscattered pulses and using the speed of light to calculate the distance travelled. Lidars can determine atmospheric profiles of aerosols, clouds, and other constituents of the atmosphere.

'''[[Laser altimeter]]'''
A laser altimeter uses a lidar (see above) to measure the height of the instrument platform above the surface. By independently knowing the height of the platform with respect to the mean Earth's surface, the topography of the underlying surface can be determined.
&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/RemoteSensing/|title=Remote Sensing : Feature Articles|first=Graham|last=Steve|date=17 September 1999|publisher=NASA|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Field survey===
{{main|Archaeological survey}}
[[File:Monte Albán archeological site, Oaxaca.jpg|thumb|[[Monte Alban]] archaeological site]]
The archaeological project then continues (or alternatively, begins) with a [[archaeological survey|field survey]]. Regional survey is the attempt to systematically locate previously unknown sites in a region. Site survey is the attempt to systematically locate features of interest, such as houses and [[midden]]s, within a site. Each of these two goals may be accomplished with largely the same methods.

Survey was not widely practiced in the early days of archaeology. Cultural historians and prior researchers were usually content with discovering the locations of monumental sites from the local populace, and excavating only the plainly visible [[Feature (archaeology)|features]] there. [[Gordon Willey]] pioneered the technique of regional settlement pattern survey in 1949 in the [[Viru Valley]] of coastal [[Peru]],&lt;ref name="Willey1953"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Willey1968"/&gt; and survey of all levels became prominent with the rise of processual archaeology some years later.&lt;ref name="Billmand_Feinman1999"/&gt;

Survey work has many benefits if performed as a preliminary exercise to, or even in place of, excavation. It requires relatively little time and expense, because it does not require processing large volumes of soil to search out artifacts. (Nevertheless, surveying a large region or site can be expensive, so archaeologists often employ [[sampling (statistics)|sampling]] methods.)&lt;ref name="Redman1974"/&gt; As with other forms of non-destructive archaeology, survey avoids ethical issues (of particular concern to descendant peoples) associated with destroying a site through excavation. It is the only way to gather some forms of information, such as [[Human settlement|settlement patterns]] and settlement structure. Survey data are commonly assembled into [[map]]s, which may show surface features and/or artifact distribution.
[[File:Archeoscan excavation site.jpg|thumbnail|right|Inverted kite aerial photo of an excavation of a Roman building at Nesley near Tetbury in Gloucestershire.]]
The simplest survey technique is surface survey. It involves combing an area, usually on foot but sometimes with the use of mechanized transport, to search for features or artifacts visible on the surface. Surface survey cannot detect sites or features that are completely buried under earth, or overgrown with vegetation. Surface survey may also include mini-excavation techniques such as [[auger (drill)|augers]], [[corer]]s, and [[shovel test]] pits. If no materials are found, the area surveyed is deemed [[sterile deposit|sterile]].

[[Aerial survey]] is conducted using [[camera]]s attached to [[airplane]]s, [[balloon (aircraft)|balloons]], [[UAVs]], or even [[Kite]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.armadale.org.uk/kite03.htm |title=Kite Aerial Photography |accessdate=2 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A bird's-eye view is useful for quick mapping of large or complex sites. Aerial photographs are used to document the status of the archaeological dig. Aerial imaging can also detect many things not visible from the surface. [[Plant]]s growing above a buried man made structure, such as a stone wall, will develop more slowly, while those above other types of features (such as [[midden]]s) may develop more rapidly. Photographs of ripening [[cereal|grain]], which changes colour rapidly at maturation, have revealed buried structures with great precision. Aerial photographs taken at different times of day will help show the outlines of structures by changes in shadows. Aerial survey also employs [[ultraviolet]], [[infrared]], ground-penetrating [[radar]] wavelengths, [[LiDAR]] and [[thermography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Reeves|first= D.M. |year=1936|title=Aerial photography and archaeology|journal=American Antiquity|volume=2|issue=2|pages= 102–07|doi=10.2307/275881|jstor=275881}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Geophysical survey (archaeology)|Geophysical survey]] can be the most effective way to see beneath the ground. [[Magnetometer]]s detect minute deviations in the [[Earth's magnetic field]] caused by [[iron]] artifacts, [[kiln]]s, some types of [[stone structures]], and even ditches and middens. Devices that measure the [[electrical resistivity]] of the soil are also widely used. Archaeological features whose electrical resistivity contrasts with that of surrounding soils can be detected and mapped. Some archaeological features (such as those composed of stone or brick) have higher resistivity than typical soils, while others (such as organic deposits or unfired clay) tend to have lower resistivity.

Although some archaeologists consider the use of [[metal detector]]s to be tantamount to treasure hunting, others deem them an effective tool in archaeological surveying.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Sánchez |first=Rosalía |title=Para los arqueólogos es un ladrón, para los buscadores de tesoros un ídolo |url=http://www.elmundo.es/cultura/2015/02/25/54ee2718ca4741d71a8b457b.html |date=25 February 2015 |access-date=19 December 2017 |newspaper=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]] |language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of formal archaeological use of metal detectors include musketball distribution analysis on [[English Civil War]] battlefields, metal distribution analysis prior to excavation of a 19th-century ship wreck, and service cable location during evaluation. Metal detectorists have also contributed to archaeology where they have made detailed records of their results and refrained from raising artifacts from their archaeological context. In the UK, metal detectorists have been solicited for involvement in the [[Portable Antiquities Scheme]].

Regional survey in [[underwater archaeology]] uses geophysical or remote sensing devices such as marine magnetometer, [[side-scan sonar]], or sub-bottom sonar.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Hall|first= E.T. |year=1970|title= Survey techniques in underwater archaeology|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

===Excavation===
{{main|Excavation (archaeology)}}
[[File:Iowa archaeology edgewater.JPG|thumb|Excavations at the 3800-year-old [[Edgewater Park Site]], [[Iowa]]]]
[[File:Vill excavation.jpg|thumb|upright|Archaeological excavation that discovered prehistoric caves in [[Vill]] ([[Innsbruck]]), [[Austria]]]]
[[File:Sifting for POW remains, Wake Island.jpg|thumb|right|An archaeologist sifting for [[Prisoner of war|POW]] remains on [[Wake Island]].]]

Archaeological excavation existed even when the field was still the domain of amateurs, and it remains the source of the majority of data recovered in most field projects. It can reveal several types of information usually not accessible to survey, such as [[stratigraphy]], three-dimensional structure, and verifiably primary context.

Modern excavation techniques require that the precise locations of objects and features, known as their [[provenance]] or provenience, be recorded. This always involves determining their horizontal locations, and sometimes vertical position as well (also see [[Harris matrix#Harris's Laws of Archaeological Stratigraphy|Primary Laws of Archaeology]]). Likewise, their [[archaeological association|association]], or [[relationship (archaeology)|relationship]] with nearby objects and [[feature (archaeology)|features]], needs to be recorded for later analysis. This allows the archaeologist to deduce which [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] and features were likely used together and which may be from different [[archaeological phase|phases]] of activity. For example, excavation of a site reveals its [[stratigraphy]]; if a site was occupied by a succession of distinct cultures, artifacts from more recent cultures will lie above those from more ancient cultures.

Excavation is the most expensive phase of archaeological research, in relative terms. Also, as a destructive process, it carries [[ethics|ethical]] concerns. As a result, very few sites are excavated in their entirety. Again the percentage of a site excavated depends greatly on the country and "method statement" issued. [[Sampling (statistics)|Sampling]] is even more important in excavation than in survey.Sometimes large mechanical equipment, such as [[backhoe]]s ([[J. C. Bamford|JCBs]]), is used in excavation, especially to remove the [[topsoil]] ([[overburden]]), though this method is increasingly used with great caution. Following this rather dramatic step, the exposed area is usually hand-cleaned with [[trowel]]s or [[hoe (tool)|hoes]] to ensure that all features are apparent.

The next task is to form a [[Archaeological plan|site plan]] and then use it to help decide the method of excavation. Features dug into the [[Archaeological natural|natural subsoil]] are normally excavated in portions to produce a visible [[archaeological section]] for recording. A feature, for example a pit or a ditch, consists of two parts: the [[Cut (archaeology)|cut]] and the [[Fill (archaeology)|fill]]. The cut describes the edge of the feature, where the feature meets the natural soil. It is the feature's boundary. The fill is what the feature is filled with, and will often appear quite distinct from the natural soil. The cut and fill are given consecutive numbers for recording purposes. Scaled plans and sections of individual features are all drawn on site, black and white and colour photographs of them are taken, and [[Single context recording|recording]] sheets are filled in describing the [[Archaeological context|context]] of each. All this information serves as a permanent record of the now-destroyed archaeology and is used in describing and interpreting the site.

===Analysis===
{{main|Post-excavation analysis}}

Once artifacts and structures have been excavated, or collected from surface surveys, it is necessary to properly study them. This process is known as [[post-excavation analysis]], and is usually the most time-consuming part of an archaeological investigation. It is not uncommon for final excavation reports for major sites to take years to be published.

At a basic level of analysis, artifacts found are cleaned, catalogued and compared to published collections. This comparison process often involves classifying them [[Typology (archaeology)|typologically]] and identifying other sites with similar artifact assemblages. However, a much more comprehensive range of analytical techniques are available through [[archaeological science]], meaning that artifacts can be dated and their compositions examined. Bones, plants, and pollen collected from a site can all be analyzed using the methods of [[zooarchaeology]], [[paleoethnobotany]], and [[palynology]], while any texts can usually be [[Deciphering|deciphered]].

These techniques frequently provide information that would not otherwise be known, and therefore they contribute greatly to the understanding of a site.

===Computational and virtual archaeology===
{{main|Computational archaeology}}
{{main|Virtual archaeology}}
[[Computer graphics]] are now used to build virtual [[3D modeling|3D models]] of sites, such as the throne room of an Assyrian palace or ancient Rome.&lt;ref name="virt"/&gt; [[Photogrammetry]] is also used as an analytical tool, and digital [[topography|topographical]] models have been combined with [[astronomy|astronomical]] calculations to verify whether or not certain structures (such as pillars) were aligned with astronomical events such as the sun's position at a [[solstice]].&lt;ref name=virt/&gt; [[Agent-based modeling]] and [[Computer simulation|simulation]] can be used to better understand past social dynamics and outcomes. [[Data mining]] can be applied to large bodies of archaeological 'grey literature'.

===Drones===

Archaeologists around the world use drones to speed up survey work and protect sites from squatters, builders and miners. In Peru, small drones helped researchers produce three-dimensional models of Peruvian sites instead of the usual flat maps – and in days and weeks instead of months and years.&lt;ref name=peru&gt;{{citation|author=Reuters in Lima |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/25/peru-archaeologists-drones-ancient-ruins |title=Peru's archaeologists turn to drones to help protect and explore ancient ruins &amp;#124; World news |work=The Guardian |date=25 August 2013 |accessdate=27 August 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130825124451/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/25/peru-archaeologists-drones-ancient-ruins|archivedate=25 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drones costing as little as £650 have proven useful. In 2013, drones have flown over at least six Peruvian archaeological sites, including the colonial Andean town Machu Llacta {{convert|4000|m}} above sea level. The drones continue to have altitude problems in the Andes, leading to plans to make a drone [[blimp]], employing open source software.&lt;ref name=peru/&gt;

Jeffrey Quilter, an archaeologist with Harvard University said, "You can go up three metres and photograph a room, 300 metres and photograph a site, or you can go up 3,000 metres and photograph the entire valley."&lt;ref name=peru/&gt;

In September 2014 drones weighing about {{convert|5|kg|0|abbr=on}} were used for 3D mapping of the above-ground ruins of the Greek city of [[Aphrodisias]]. The data is being analysed by the Austrian Archaeological Institute in Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Hudson|first1=Hal|title=Air-chaeological drones search for ancient treasures|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22329883.900-airchaeological-drones-search-for-ancient-treasures.html#.VC1hk_ldV8E|accessdate=2 October 2014|issue=2988|publisher=New Scientist|date=24 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic sub-disciplines==
{{Main|Archaeological sub-disciplines}}

As with most [[academia|academic]] disciplines, there are a very large number of [[archaeological sub-disciplines]] characterized by a specific method or type of material (e.g., [[lithic analysis]], [[music (archaeology)|music]], [[archaeobotany]]), geographical or chronological focus (e.g. [[Near Eastern archaeology]], Islamic archaeology, [[Medieval archaeology]]), other thematic concern (e.g. [[maritime archaeology]], [[landscape archaeology]], [[battlefield archaeology]]), or a specific [[archaeological culture]] or [[civilization]] (e.g. [[Egyptology]], [[Indology]], [[Sinology]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.saa.org/Default.aspx?TabId=1346|title=What is Archaeology?|last=Archaeology|first=Society for American|website=www.saa.org|language=en-US|access-date=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical archaeology===
{{Main|Historical archaeology}}

Historical archaeology is the study of cultures with some form of writing.

In [[England]], archaeologists have uncovered layouts of 14th century medieval villages, abandoned after crises such as the [[Black Death]].&lt;ref name=dyer&gt;{{citation|last1=Dyer|first1=Christopher|title=Deserted Medieval Villages in the West Midlands|volume=35|number=1|date=1982|journal=Economic History Society|jstor=2595101|pp=19–34|doi=10.2307/2595101}}&lt;/ref&gt; In downtown [[New York City]], archaeologists have exhumed the 18th century remains of the [[African Burial Ground National Monument|African Burial Ground]].

===Ethnoarchaeology===
{{Main|Ethnoarchaeology}}

[[Ethnoarchaeology]] is the ethnographic study of living people, designed to aid in our interpretation of the archaeological record.&lt;ref name="Gould1971a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gould1971b"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yellen1972"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yellen1977"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gould_Yellen1987"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yellen1991"/&gt; The approach first gained prominence during the processual movement of the 1960s, and continues to be a vibrant component of post-processual and other current archaeological approaches.&lt;ref name="Hinshaw2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sillet_et_al2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schott_Sillitoe2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ogundele2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kuznar2001"/&gt; Early ethnoarchaeological research focused on [[hunter-gatherer]] or foraging societies; today ethnoarchaeological research encompasses a much wider range of human behaviour.

===Experimental archaeology===
{{Main|Experimental archaeology}}

[[Experimental archaeology]] represents the application of the experimental method to develop more highly controlled observations of processes that create and impact the archaeological record.&lt;ref name="Ascher1961"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Saraydar_Shimada1971"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Saraydar_Shimada1973"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gifford-Gonzalez_et_al1985"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Frison1989"/&gt; In the context of the logical positivism of processualism with its goals of improving the scientific rigor of archaeological [[epistemological|epistemologies]] the experimental method gained importance. Experimental techniques remain a crucial component to improving the inferential frameworks for interpreting the archaeological record.

===Archaeometry===
{{Main|Archaeological science}}

[[Archaeometry]] aims to systematize archaeological measurement. It emphasizes the application of analytical techniques from physics, chemistry, and engineering. It is a field of research that frequently focuses on the definition of the chemical composition of archaeological remains for source analysis.&lt;ref name="Glasscock_et_al1994"/&gt; Archaeometry also investigates different spatial characteristics of features, employing methods such as space syntax techniques and [[geodesy]] as well as computer-based tools such as [[geographic information system]] technology.&lt;ref name="GIS, critique, representation and beyond"/&gt; [[Rare earth elements]] patterns may also be used.&lt;ref name="An anthropic soil transformation fingerprinted by REY patterns"/&gt;  A relatively nascent subfield is that of archaeological materials, designed to enhance understanding of prehistoric and non-industrial culture through scientific analysis of the structure and properties of materials associated with human activity.&lt;ref name="mit"/&gt;

===Cultural resources management===
{{Main|Cultural resources management}}
{{Original research|section|date=March 2014}}

Archaeology can be a subsidiary activity within [[Cultural resources management]] (CRM), also called heritage management in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="The University of Exeter - SoGAER - Department of Archaeology"/&gt; CRM archaeologists frequently examine archaeological sites that are threatened by development. Today, CRM accounts for most of the archaeological research done in the United States and much of that in [[western Europe]] as well. In the US, CRM archaeology has been a growing concern since the passage of the [[National Historic Preservation Act]] (NHPA) of 1966, and most taxpayers, scholars, and politicians believe that CRM has helped preserve much of that nation's history and prehistory that would have otherwise been lost in the expansion of cities, dams, and highways. Along with other statutes, the NHPA mandates that projects on federal land or involving federal funds or permits consider the effects of the project on each [[archaeological site]].

The application of CRM in the United Kingdom is not limited to government-funded projects. Since 1990, [[PPG 16]]&lt;ref name="Planning Policy Guidance 16: Archaeology and planning - Planning, building and the environment - Communities and Local Government"/&gt; has required planners to consider archaeology as a [[material consideration]] in determining applications for new development. As a result, numerous archaeological organizations undertake mitigation work in advance of (or during) construction work in archaeologically sensitive areas, at the [[polluter pays principle|developer's expense]].

In England, ultimate responsibility of care for the historic environment rests with the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]]&lt;ref name="Department for Culture Media and Sport - historic environment"/&gt; in association with [[English Heritage]].&lt;ref name="English Heritage - Stonehenge &amp; the History of England: English Heritage"/&gt; In [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]], the same responsibilities lie with [[Historic Scotland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/ |title= Historic Scotland |publisher=Historic Scotland |date= |accessdate=5 May 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090426014641/http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/| archivedate= 26 April 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cadw]]&lt;ref name="Cadw"/&gt; and the [[Northern Ireland Environment Agency]]&lt;ref name="Built Environment"/&gt; respectively.

In France, the [[Institut national du patrimoine]] (The National Institute of Cultural Heritage) trains curators specialized in archaeology. Their mission is to enhance the objects discovered. The [[curator]] is the link between scientific knowledge, administrative regulations, heritage objects and the public.

Among the goals of CRM are the identification, preservation, and maintenance of [[cultural]] sites on public and private lands, and the removal of culturally valuable materials from areas where they would otherwise be destroyed by human activity, such as proposed construction. This study involves at least a cursory examination to determine whether or not any significant archaeological sites are present in the area affected by the proposed construction. If these do exist, time and money must be allotted for their excavation. If initial survey and/or test excavations indicate the presence of an extraordinarily valuable site, the construction may be prohibited entirely.

Cultural resources management has, however, been criticized. CRM is conducted by private companies that bid for projects by submitting proposals outlining the work to be done and an expected budget. It is not unheard-of for the agency responsible for the construction to simply choose the proposal that asks for the least funding. CRM archaeologists face considerable time pressure, often being forced to complete their work in a fraction of the time that might be allotted for a purely scholarly endeavour. Compounding the time pressure is the vetting process of site reports that are required (in the US) to be submitted by CRM firms to the appropriate [[State Historic Preservation Office]] (SHPO). From the SHPO's perspective there is to be no difference between a report submitted by a CRM firm operating under a deadline, and a multi-year academic project. The end result is that for a Cultural Resource Management archaeologist to be successful, they must be able to produce academic quality documents at a corporate world pace.

The annual ratio of open academic archaeology positions (inclusive of [[postdoctoral|post-doc]], temporary, and non- tenure track appointments) to the annual number of archaeology MA/MSc and PhD students is disproportionate. Cultural Resource Management, once considered an intellectual backwater for individuals with "strong backs and weak minds,"&lt;ref name="Flannery1982"/&gt; has attracted these graduates, and CRM offices are thus increasingly staffed by advance degreed individuals with a track record of producing scholarly articles but who also have extensive CRM field experience.

==Popular views of archaeology==

[[File:Beit shean1.jpg|thumb|right|Extensive excavations at [[Beit She'an]], [[Israel]]]]
[[File:Exhibition in a multi-storey car park on archological discoveries having been made during construction.JPG|thumb|Permanent exhibition in a German [[multi-storey car park]], explaining the archaeological discoveries made during the construction of this building]]

Early archaeology was largely an attempt to uncover spectacular artifacts and features, or to explore vast and mysterious abandoned cities. Early archaeology was mostly done by upper class, scholarly men. This generalization laid the foundation for the modern popular view of archaeology and archaeologists. This generalization has been with western culture for a long time. Another popular thought that dates back to this era is that archaeology is monetarily lucrative. A large majority of the general public is under the impression that excavations are undertaken for money and not historical data.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} It is easy for the general public to hold this notion for that is what is presented to them through general media, and has been for many decades.

The majority of the public view archaeology as being something only available to a narrow demographic. The job of archaeologist is depicted as a "romantic adventurist occupation".&lt;ref name="McGeough 2006 174–185"&gt;{{Citation|last=McGeough|first=Kevin|title=Heroes, Mummies, and Treasure: Near Eastern Archaeology in the Movies|journal=Near Eastern Archaeology|year=2006|volume=69|pages=174–85}}&lt;/ref&gt; To generalize, the public views archaeology as a fantasized hobby more than a job in the scientific community. The audience may not take away scientific methods from popular cinema but they do form a notion of "who archaeologists are, why they do what they do, and how relationships to the past are constituted".&lt;ref name="McGeough 2006 174–185"/&gt; The modern depiction of archaeology is sensationalized so much that it has incorrectly formed the public's perception of what archaeology is. The public is often under the impression that all archaeology takes place in a distant and foreign land, only to collect monetarily or spiritually priceless artifacts.

Much thorough and productive research has indeed been conducted in dramatic locales such as [[Copán]] and the [[Valley of the Kings]], but the bulk of activities and finds of modern archaeology are not so sensational. Archaeological adventure stories tend to ignore the painstaking work involved in carrying out modern surveys, [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavations]], and [[archaeological data processing|data processing]]. Some archaeologists refer to such off-the-mark portrayals as "[[pseudoarchaeology]]".&lt;ref name="Romancing the Past-Archaeology"/&gt;
Archaeologists are also very much reliant on public support; the question of exactly who they are doing their work for is often discussed.&lt;ref name="Denning2004"/&gt;

==Current issues and controversy==

===Public archaeology===
[[File:Dolina-Pano-3.jpg|thumb|upright|Excavations at the site of [[Gran Dolina]], in the [[Atapuerca Mountains]], Spain, 2008]]
Motivated by a desire to halt looting, curb [[#Pseudoarchaeology|pseudoarchaeology]], and to help preserve archaeological sites through education and fostering public appreciation for the importance of archaeological heritage, archaeologists are mounting public-outreach campaigns.&lt;ref name="Anthropological Studies Center (ASC)"/&gt; They seek to stop looting by combatting people who illegally take artifacts from protected sites, and by alerting people who live near archaeological sites of the threat of looting. Common methods of public outreach include press releases, and the encouragement of school field trips to sites under excavation by professional archaeologists.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} Public appreciation of the significance of archaeology and archaeological sites often leads to improved protection from encroaching development or other threats.

One audience for archaeologists' work is the public. They increasingly realize that their work can benefit non-academic and non-archaeological audiences, and that they have a responsibility to educate and inform the public about archaeology. Local heritage awareness is aimed at increasing civic and individual pride through projects such as community excavation projects, and better public presentations of archaeological sites and knowledge.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} The U.S.Dept. of Agriculture, [[US Forest Service|Forest Service]] (USFS) operates a volunteer archaeology and historic preservation program called the Passport in Time (PIT). Volunteers work with professional USFS archaeologists and historians on national forests throughout the U.S. Volunteers are involved in all aspects of professional archaeology under expert supervision.&lt;ref name="rapidcityjournal"/&gt;

Television programs, web videos and social media can also bring an understanding of underwater archaeology to a broad audience. The ''Mardi Gras'' Shipwreck Project&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Mardi Gras Shipwreck |url=http://uwf.edu/jkent/fpan_preCMS/mardigras/ |website=uwf.edu |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150516045935/http://uwf.edu/jkent/fpan_preCMS/mardigras/ |archivedate=16 May 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; integrated a one-hour HD documentary,&lt;ref name="Mystery Mardi Gras Shipwreck"&gt;{{citation|title=Mystery Mardi Gras Shipwreck|url=http://nautilusproductions.com/projects/mystery-mardi-gras-shipwreck-documentary|website=Nautilus Productions}}&lt;/ref&gt; short videos for public viewing and video updates during the expedition as part of the educational outreach. Webcasting is also another tool for educational outreach. For one week in 2000 and 2001, live [[Underwater videography|underwater video]] of the ''[[Queen Anne's Revenge]]'' Shipwreck Project was [[webcast]] to the [[Internet]] as a part of the ''QAR DiveLive''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://digital.ncdcr.gov/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll22/id/695248|title=Live from Morehead City, it's Queen Anne's Revenge :: State Publications|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; educational program that reached thousands of children around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author1=C Southerly |author2=J Gillman-Bryan |title=Diving on the Queen Anne's Revenge |journal=In: SF Norton (ed).

In the UK, popular archaeology programs such as ''[[Time Team]]'' and ''[[Meet the Ancestors]]'' have resulted in a huge upsurge in public interest.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} Where possible, archaeologists now make more provisions for public involvement and outreach in larger projects than they once did, and many local archaeological organizations operate within the [[Community archaeology]] framework to expand public involvement in smaller-scale, more local projects. Archaeological excavation, however, is best undertaken by well-trained staff that can work quickly and accurately. Often this requires observing the necessary [[health and safety]] and indemnity insurance issues involved in working on a modern [[construction|building site]] with tight deadlines. Certain charities and [[local government]] bodies sometimes offer places on research projects either as part of academic work or as a defined community project.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} There is also a flourishing industry selling places on commercial [[training excavations]] and archaeological holiday tours.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

Archaeologists prize local knowledge and often liaise with local historical and archaeological societies, which is one reason why [[Community archaeology]] projects are starting to become more common. Often archaeologists are assisted by the public in the locating of archaeological sites, which professional archaeologists have neither the funding, nor the time to do.

Archaeological Legacy Institute (ALI), is a registered 501[c] [3] non-profit, media and education corporation registered in Oregon in 1999. ALI founded a website, [http://archaeologychannel.org/ The Archaeology Channel] to support the organization's mission "to nurturing and bringing attention to the human cultural heritage, by using media in the most efficient and effective ways possible."&lt;ref name="The Archaeology Channel and About Us: Archaeological Legacy Institute"/&gt;

===Pseudoarchaeology===
{{Main|Pseudoarchaeology}}

[[Pseudoarchaeology]] is an umbrella term for all activities that falsely claim to be archaeological but in fact violate commonly accepted and scientific archaeological practices. It includes much fictional archaeological work (discussed above), as well as some actual activity. Many non-fiction authors have ignored the scientific methods of processual archaeology, or the specific critiques of it contained in [[Post-processual archaeology|post-processualism]].

An example of this type is the writing of [[Erich von Däniken]]. His 1968 book, ''[[Chariots of the Gods?]]'', together with many subsequent lesser-known works, expounds a theory of ancient contacts between human civilization on Earth and more technologically advanced extraterrestrial civilizations. This theory, known as [[palaeocontact theory]], or [[Ancient astronaut theory]], is not exclusively Däniken's, nor did the idea originate with him. Works of this nature are usually marked by the renunciation of well-established theories on the basis of limited evidence, and the interpretation of evidence with a preconceived theory in mind.

===Looting===
[[File:Looting rontoy2007.jpg|thumb|right|A looter's pit on the morning following its excavation, taken at [[Rontoy]], [[Huaura Valley]], [[Peru]] in June 2007. Several small holes left by looters' prospecting probes can be seen, as well as their footprints.]]
[[File:Adad-Nirari stela.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Stela]] of a king named [[Adad-nirari I|Adad-Nirari]]. Object stolen from the Iraq National Museum in the looting in connection with the [[Iraq War]] of 2003.]]

[[Looting]] of archaeological sites is an ancient problem. For instance, many of the tombs of the Egyptian [[pharaoh]]s were looted during [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]].&lt;ref name="civilizations" /&gt; Archaeology stimulates interest in ancient objects, and people in search of artifacts or treasure cause damage to archaeological sites. The commercial and academic demand for artifacts unfortunately contributes directly to the [[illicit antiquities]] trade. Smuggling of antiquities abroad to private collectors has caused great cultural and economic damage in many countries whose governments lack the resources and or the will to deter it. Looters damage and destroy archaeological sites, denying future generations information about their ethnic and cultural heritage. Indigenous peoples especially lose access to and control over their 'cultural resources', ultimately denying them the opportunity to know their past.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt;

In 1937, W. F. Hodge the Director of the [[Southwest Museum]] released a statement that the museum would no longer purchase or accept collections from looted contexts.&lt;ref name="Hodge1937" /&gt; The first conviction of the transport of artifacts illegally removed from private property under the [http://www.nps.gov/history/local-law/FHPL_ArchRsrcsProt.pdf Archaeological Resources Protection Act (ARPA; Public Law 96-95; 93 Statute 721;] {{usc|16|470aamm}}) was in 1992 in the State of Indiana.&lt;ref name="Munson_et_al1995" /&gt;

Archaeologists trying to protect artifacts may be placed in danger by looters or locals trying to protect the artifacts from archaeologists who are viewed as looters by the locals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Archaeologist's Execution Highlights Risks to History's Guardians|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/08/150820-syria-archaeologist-isis-protecting-artifacts/|website=National Geographic News|accessdate=21 August 2015|first=Mark|last=Strauss|date=20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Descendant peoples===
In the United States, examples such as the case of [[Kennewick Man]] have illustrated the tensions between [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] and archaeologists, which can be summarized as a conflict between a need to remain respectful toward sacred burial sites and the academic benefit from studying them. For years, American archaeologists dug on Indian burial grounds and other places considered sacred, removing artifacts and human remains to storage facilities for further study. In some cases human remains were not even thoroughly studied but instead archived rather than reburied. Furthermore, Western archaeologists' views of the past often differ from those of tribal peoples. The West views time as linear; for many natives, it is cyclic. From a Western perspective, the past is long-gone; from a native perspective, disturbing the past can have dire consequences in the present.

As a consequence of this, American Indians attempted to prevent archaeological excavation of sites inhabited by their ancestors, while American archaeologists believed that the advancement of scientific knowledge was a valid reason to continue their studies. This contradictory situation was addressed by the [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act]] (NAGPRA, 1990), which sought to reach a compromise by limiting the right of research institutions to possess human remains. Due in part to the spirit of [[postprocessualism]], some archaeologists have begun to actively enlist the assistance of [[indigenous peoples]] likely to be descended from those under study.

Archaeologists have also been obliged to re-examine what constitutes an archaeological site in view of what native peoples believe to constitute sacred space. To many native peoples, natural features such as lakes, mountains or even individual trees have cultural significance. Australian archaeologists especially have explored this issue and attempted to survey these sites to give them some protection from being developed. Such work requires close links and trust between archaeologists and the people they are trying to help and at the same time study.

While this cooperation presents a new set of challenges and hurdles to fieldwork, it has benefits for all parties involved. Tribal elders cooperating with archaeologists can prevent the excavation of areas of sites that they consider sacred, while the archaeologists gain the elders' aid in interpreting their finds. There have also been active efforts to recruit aboriginal peoples directly into the archaeological profession.

====Repatriation====
:''See [[Repatriation and reburial of human remains]]''
A new trend in the heated controversy between [[First Nations]] groups and scientists is the [[repatriation]] of native [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] to the original descendants. An example of this occurred on 21 June 2005, when community members and elders from a number of the 10 [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] nations in the [[Ottawa]] area convened on the Kitigan Zibi reservation near [[Maniwaki, Quebec]], to inter ancestral human remains and burial goods—some dating back 6,000 years. It was not determined, however, if the remains were directly related to the Algonquin people who now inhabit the region. The remains may be of Iroquoian ancestry, since Iroquoian people inhabited the area before the Algonquin. Moreover, the oldest of these remains might have no relation at all to the Algonquin or Iroquois, and belong to an earlier culture who previously inhabited the area.

The remains and artifacts, including [[jewelry]], [[tool]]s and [[weapons]], were originally excavated from various sites in the [[Ottawa Valley]], including [[Morrison Island|Morrison]] and the [[Allumette Island]]s. They had been part of the [[Canadian Museum of Civilization]]'s research collection for decades, some since the late 19th century. Elders from various Algonquin communities conferred on an appropriate reburial, eventually deciding on traditional [[Juniperus virginiana|redcedar]] and [[birchbark]] boxes lined with redcedar chips, [[muskrat]] and [[Beaver#Commercial uses|beaver pelts]].

An inconspicuous rock mound marks the reburial site where close to 80 boxes of various sizes are buried. Because of this reburial, no further scientific study is possible. Although negotiations were at times tense between the Kitigan Zibi community and museum, they were able to reach agreement.&lt;ref name="Canadian Geographic Online" /&gt;

[[Kennewick Man]] is another repatriation candidate that has been the source of heated debate.

'''''Art and Illusion, A Study in the Psychology of Pictorial Representation''''', is a 1960 book of [[art theory]] and [[art history|history]] by [[Ernst Gombrich]], derived from the 1956 [[Bollingen Foundation#Number 35: The A. W. Mellon Lectures in the Fine Arts|A. W. Mellon Lectures in the Fine Arts]]. The book had a wide impact in art history,&lt;ref&gt;Shone, Richard and Stonard, John-Paul, eds. ''The Books That Shaped Art History: From Gombrich and Greenberg to Alpers and Krauss'', chapter 9. London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; but also in history (e.g. [[Carlo Ginzburg]], who called it "splendid"&lt;ref&gt;Ginzburg, Carlo. "From Aby Warburg to E.H. Gombrich." In Clues, Myths, and the Historical Method, 47. Baltimore: JHU Press, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;), [[aesthetics]] (e.g. [[Nelson Goodman]]'s ''[[Languages of Art]]''&lt;ref&gt;N. Goodman: ''Languages of Art'', Indianapolis and Cambridge, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;), [[semiotics]] ([[Umberto Eco]]'s ''Theory of Semiotics''&lt;ref&gt;U. Eco: ''Theory of Semiotics'', Bloomington, 1976, pp.204-05.&lt;/ref&gt;), and music psychology ([[Robert Gjerdingen|Robert O. Gjerdingen]]'s schema theory of [[Galant style]] music).

In ''Art and Illusion,'' Gombrich argues for the importance of "schemata" in analyzing works of art: he claims that artists can only learn to represent the external world by learning from previous artists, so representation is always done using stereotyped figures and methods.

'''Bertrand Westphal''' is a French scholar and essayist born on May 10, 1962 in [[Strasbourg, France]].

==Career==
Westphal, a professor of [[comparative literature]] and [[literary theory]], has been teaching at the [[University of Limoges]] since 1998. He has been directing the « Human Spaces and Cultural Interactions » research team (EA 1087) since 2000.

He was a visiting professor at [[Texas Tech University]] (2005) and at the [[University of North Carolina Charlotte]] (2013-2015).

Westphal is the founder of [[Geocriticism]], a method of literary analysis and literary theory that incorporates the study of geographic space. After editing the first collective work on this topic (''La Géocritique mode d'emploi''), he published the essay ''La Géocritique. Réel, fiction, espace'' in 2007. In 2011, the book was translated into English (United States) under the title of ''Geocriticism: Real and Fictional Spaces'' by [[Robert Tally]], who has become one of the main promoters of this literary approach in the United States. Geocriticism lays the foundations of the homonymous theory, i.e. an interdisciplinary method of literary analysis that focuses on spatial representations.

In 2011, Westphal published the essay ''Le Monde plausible. Espace, lieu, carte'', which proposes a diachronic study of the models of spatial representation. In this book, he distinguishes open space and closed place and gives special value to maps. In 2013, ''Le Monde plausible'' was translated into English (United States) by Amy Wells under the title ''The Plausible World''.
A third volume, ''La Cage des méridiens. La littérature et l’art contemporain face à la globalisation'', published in March 2016, completes what appears to be a Geocriticism trilogy. This work examines the specific role of literature and contemporary art on a global scale and focuses on transcultural logics and decentering.

Westphal is the author of several other books, such as ''Roman et Evangile'' (2000) about the transposition, in a plain narratological sense, of episodes or characters drawn from the Gospels in the contemporary European novel. He is also the author of ''L’œil de la Méditerranée. Une odyssée littéraire'' (2005), which brings together a series of studies of Mediterranean places, and ''Austro-fictions. Une géographie de l’intime'' (2010), which explores the works of a dozen of contemporary Austrian writers.

'''Bud Industries''' is a manufacturer and supplier of [[Enclosure (electrical)|electronics enclosures]] founded by Max Haas in 1928 and based in [[Willoughby, Ohio]] near [[Cleveland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crainscleveland.com/article/20060901/FREE/60901014 "Following Dad’s Footsteps"]. Stroope, Leslie. ''[[Crain Communications|Crain's Cleveland Business Magazine]]''.  September 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of Bud electronics enclosures are sold through more than 150 independent distributors, including [[Digi-Key]], [[Newark Corporation|Newark]], [[Allied Electronics]], Master Electronics, and [[Mouser Electronics]].

==History==
Max Haas was an electronics salesman who started the company to manufacture an "antenna eliminator" that attached to the back of a [[radio]] and eliminated the need for a rooftop [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]]. Later Haas modified the product to fit [[car|automobiles]] and other devices. The company name came from the nickname of Mr. Haas' son, Alvin.

Haas started selling his product in Cleveland, Ohio. Bud Industries expanded into producing radio kits and parts for ham radios, followed by radio coils, condensers and enclosures. By the mid-1930s, the Bud Industries product catalog ranged from small metal relay racks to large electrical mounting equipment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Bud+Industries+President+Haas%3a+Regulatory+Flexibility+Improvements+...-a0130343331 "Testimony of Blair Haas, President of Bud Industries Inc., before the House Small Business Committee on the Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act (H.R. 682)"] ''The Free Library'' (retrieved May 25, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

The company expanded into producing mini box enclosures, which became known among electronics students and engineers&lt;ref&gt;"Design and Manufacture of the 2003 2.007 Wireless Control Boxes". Varady, Eric. Bachelor's Degree Thesis. [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. 2003 (retrieved May 30, 2010 from http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/32793/57583475.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; as "bud boxes." The company also started producing relay [[19-inch rack|racks]], cabinets and other enclosures designed to house industrial electronic equipment, a large cabinet rack being called a '''BudRack'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.budind.com/view/Large+Cabinet+Racks/BudRack+Professional+Series Large Cabinet Racks]&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon Mr. Haas' death, control of the company moved to his son, Alvin "Bud" Haas, who moved the Bud manufacturing facility just outside Cleveland to Willoughby, Ohio. In 1976, Bud Industries added a facility in Phoenix, Arizona and started to concentrate on designing and manufacturing custom units.

In 1992, Bud's son Blair succeeded his father to become the third member of the Haas family to serve as company president. Since that time the company has developed a line of plastic enclosures and a series of [[National Electrical Manufacturers Association#NEMA Enclosure|NEMA-rated enclosures]] specially made for harsh environments.  In 2015, Josiah Haas succeeded his father as president, leading the company into the 4th generation of family management, a feat achieved by less than 3% of companies. The 2009 Bud product catalog lists more than 2,600 standard enclosures.

[[Image:Cadarache (red dot) CIA World Factbook map.png|thumb|right|250px|Location of Cadarache (marked in red) in southern France.]]

'''Cadarache''' is the largest technological research and development center for energy in Europe including CEA research activities and ITER.
CEA Cadarache is one of the 10 research centers of the French Commission of Atomic and Alternative Energies. Established in the French département [[Bouches-du-Rhône]], close to the village Saint Paul-lez-Durance, CEA Cadarache, created in 1959, is located about 40 kilometers from Aix-en-Provence, approximately 60 kilometres (37&amp;nbsp;mi) north-east of the city of [[Marseille]] and stands near the borders of three other départements: the Alpes de Haute-Provence, the Var and the Vaucluse. It is one of the major sources of employment in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region (PACA) and has one of the heaviest concentrations of specialized scientific staff.
Cadarache began its research activities when [[President]] [[Charles de Gaulle]] launched France's atomic energy program in 1959. The center is operated by the [[French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission|Commissariat à l'Énergie Atomique et aux énergies alternatives]] (CEA, [[English language|en]]: Atomic Energy and Alternative Energy Commission).
In 2005, Cadarache was selected to be the site of the [[International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor]] (ITER), the world's largest [[nuclear fusion]] reactor. Construction of the ITER complex began in 2007, and it is projected to begin [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]-generating operations in the 2020s.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/one-giant-leap-for-mankind-13bn-iter-project-makes-breakthrough-in-the-quest-for-nuclear-fusion-a-8590480.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://tass.com/economy/768454&lt;/ref&gt; Cadarache also plays host to a number of [[research reactors]], such as the [[Jules Horowitz Reactor]], which is expected to enter operation around 2021.

==Facilities==
[[File:Cadarache.JPG|thumb|250px|right|The Cadarache facility in 2008.]]
The Cadarache center is the largest  energy research site in Europe, hosting 19 Basic Nuclear Installation (BNI) and a secret BNI, including reactors, waste stockpiling and recycling facilities, bio-technology facilities and solar platforms. It employs over 5,000 people, and approximately 700 students and foreign collaborators carry out research in the facility’s laboratories.
[[ITER]], the experimental [[nuclear fusion]] [[tokamak]], is currently under construction at Cadarache and is expected to create its first plasma by 2025. When it becomes operational, ITER is hoped to be the first large-scale fusion reactor to produce more energy than is used to initiate its fusion reactions.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-11541383&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://tass.com/economy/768454&lt;/ref&gt; Other nuclear installations at Cadarache include the Tore Supra tokamak – a predecessor to ITER – and the Jules Horowitz Reactor, a 100-megawatt research reactor which is planned to begin operation in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN-Materials-test-reactor-gets-its-dome-1612134.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
Numerous nuclear research activities are conducted at Cadarache, including [[mixed-oxide fuel]] (MOX) production, [[nuclear propulsion]] and [[fission reactor]] prototyping, [[nuclear fusion]] research and research into new forms of fission fuel. [[Nuclear waste]] is also treated and recycled at the site.

==Notable incidents==
A number of accidents, of varying severity, have occurred at Cadarache since its inception. Some of these incidents are listed below.
*31 March 1994: A [[sodium]] explosion took place while the [[Rapsodie]] experimental reactor was being dismantled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.actualites-news-environnement.com/20070315-Cadarache-proces-Commissariat-energie-atomique.php "Cadarache, le procès du Commissariat à l'énergie atomique renvoyé à décembre" (in French)]. Actualités-News-Environnement.com. 15 March 2007. Retrieved 12 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The explosion was classified as a Class 2 incident by the [[Autorité de sûreté nucléaire|ASN]].

*6 November 2006: A fault in the equipment used to weigh [[MOX]] led to a grinder being loaded with more than the authorized amount {{convert|8|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of fissile material, presenting the possible threat of a spontaneous nuclear reaction. Initially classified as a low-priority Class-1 level incident, it was subsequently revised to Class 2 by the ASN.
*1 October 2008 : A fire broke out in a non-nuclear installation.
*6 October 2009:  A higher quantity of [[plutonium]] than authorized was uncovered in the Plutonium Technology Workshop. The ASN classified the incident as Class 2, and suspended dismantling work on the workshop. After investigation, it was revealed that the cause of the incident was the accumulation between 1966 and 2004 of fine plutonium dust in the 450 glove boxes in the workshop. Following the incident, further inspections revealed that another installation, STAR, also showed quantities of plutonium in excess of the authorized amounts. The incident was classified level 1 by the ASN.

==Seismological risk==
{{update-section|date=December 2015}}
Cadarache is situated on the [[Aix-en-Provence]]-[[Durance]] [[seismological fault]], and lies close to another fault, [[Trévaresse]]. The Aix-Durance fault caused France's [[1909 Lambesc earthquake|worst recorded earthquake]] in 1909. In a 2000 report, the ASN mandated the closure of six installations at Cadarache that did not meet [[aseismic]] construction standards; a similar report was issued by a French nuclear safety organization in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/jul2000/2000-07-21-11.asp|title=French Nuclear Facility Must Close or Risk Earthquake|publisher=ENS|date=21 July 2000|accessdate=6 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2010, three of these had been shut down, with the remaining three to be shut down by 2015.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7503">The '''Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges''' is a [[biblical commentary]] set published in parts by [[Cambridge University Press]] from 1882 onwards. Anglican bishop [[John Perowne]] was the general editor. The first section published was written by theologian [[Thomas Kelly Cheyne]] and covered the [[Book of Micah]].

Perowne exercised limited editorial control over the writers of individual commentaries: his aim was "to leave each contributor to the unfettered exercise of his own judgment".&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/cambridgebiblef00unkngoog Preface by the General Editor], accessed 12 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4455">The '''Center of Molecular Immunology''' ('''Centro de Inmunología Molecular''') or '''CIM''', is a [[cancer]] research institution located on the west side of [[Havana]], [[Cuba]]. {{Coord|23.0755|-82.4708}} Opened on December 5, 1994, it focuses on the research and production of new [[biopharmaceutical]] products for the treatment of cancer and other nontransmissible diseases.

==Facilities==
The design and construction of the Center of Molecular Immunology  was modeled on current [[Good Manufacturing Practice]] guidelines recommended by the [[World Health Organization]] and adopted by Cuba, particularly those also adopted by the member countries of the European Union, then known as the European Community.

Research labs, production areas and administrative offices share the 15,000 square meters of the two floor facility.

Approximately 800 employees work at the CIM, most of them scientists and engineers. These personnel are administratively organized in three main areas: Research and Development, Production, and Quality Assurance.

==Research==
Basic research projects are focused on [[cancer immunotherapy]], especially the development of molecular vaccines. These include [[antibody]] engineering, cellular engineering, [[bioinformatics]] and regulation of the [[immune response]].

CIM conducts clinical trials in diagnostic imaging and cancer therapy of varying origin, as well as other immune system diseases, in highly specialized hospitals.

In August 2011 it was announced that the Center of Molecular Immunology released [[CimaVax-EGF]], the first therapeutic [[cancer vaccine]] for [[lung cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2011-09/cuba-releases-worlds-first-lung-cancer-vaccine|title=Cuba Announces Release of the World's First Lung Cancer Vaccine|publisher=PopSci|date=2011-08-09|accessdate=2011-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2012, a new therapeutic cancer vaccine was approved by Cuban regulatory agency. CIMAbid (racotumomab or 1E10)obtained conditional approval for the treatment of lung cancer. This vaccine is an antiidiotypic vaccine targeting N-glicolil GM3, a tumor specific antigen. The project leader was Dr Ana María Vazquez. These vaccine has been associated with statistically significant extension of survival of lung cancer patients  with excellent safety profile and continues to be investigated in confirmatory clinical trials. {{cn|date=April 2018}}

==Products==

Today CIM produces biopharmaceutical products, such as anti-CD3 [[monoclonal antibody]] for the treatment of patients with organ [[transplant rejection]], human recombinant [[erythropoietin]] for the treatment of [[anemia]], [[granulocyte colony-stimulating factor]] for the treatment of [[neutropenia]], and a humanized monoclonal antibody that recognizes the epidermal growth factor receptor for cancer treatment, as well as other monoclonal antibodies for [[tumor]] imaging.

==Commercialization==

Since 1992 [https://web.archive.org/web/20120211235944/http://www.cimab-sa.com/ CIMAB S.A.] has been devoted to the commercialization of [[biopharmaceutical]] products for the [[Cuba]]n market and abroad, especially [[monoclonal antibodies]] and other recombinant proteins for the diagnosis and treatment of [[cancer]] and other diseases related to the [[immune system]].

[https://web.archive.org/web/20120211235944/http://www.cimab-sa.com/ CIMAB S.A.] is the exclusive representative for the commercialization of the products and services of the Center of Molecular Immunology.

It was announced in July 2008 that CIM had also received approval from the Cuban regulatory authorities for a lung cancer vaccine, targeting EGFR.  The vaccine has been in development since 1992 and the project led by Gisela Gonzalez.

In [[Taxonomy (biology)|biological taxonomy]], '''circumscription''' is the definition of a [[taxon]], that is, a group of [[organisms]].

One goal of biological taxonomy is to achieve a stable circumscription for every taxon.  Achieving stability is not yet a certainty in most taxa, and many that had been regarded as stable for decades are in upheaval in the light of rapid developments in [[molecular phylogenetics]]. In essence, new discoveries may invalidate the application of irrelevant attributes used in established or obsolete circumscriptions, or present new attributes useful in [[cladistic taxonomy]]. 

An example of a taxonomic group with unstable circumscription is [[Anacardiaceae]], a [[Family (biology)|family]] of [[flowering plant]]s. Some experts favor a circumscription&lt;ref&gt;[http://delta-intkey.com/angio/www/anacardi.htm Anacardiaceae] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050315000926/http://delta-intkey.com/angio/www/anacardi.htm |date=March 15, 2005 }} in [http://delta-intkey.com/angio/ L. Watson and M.J. Dallwitz (1992 onwards). The families of flowering plants.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213041459/http://delta-intkey.com/angio/ |date=December 13, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which this family includes the [[Blepharocaryaceae]], [[Julianaceae]], and [[Podoaceae]], which are sometimes considered to be separate families.&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, P. F. (2001 onwards). [http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/research/APweb/  Angiosperm Phylogeny Website]. Version 9, June 2008 [and more or less continuously updated since].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''C-Bus''' is a home-automation product range from the [[Clipsal]] brand owned by [[Schneider Electric]].  Since 1994&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.clipsal.com/cis/technical/technical_support/training2/cbus_control_and_management_system&lt;/ref&gt; it has grown to include approximately 400 products.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clipsal.com/Trade/Products/Catalogue/Integrated-Systems?c=2#top&lt;/ref&gt;  It is primarily used as a [[Lighting control system]] but also supports other automation functions such as irrigation and security.

The initial products were labelled as 'C-Bus'.  The branding became 'C-Bus 2' in 2001 with the introduction of a feature called Learn Mode, however products of either branding are compatible and can be used together.

C-Bus products communicate using an open protocol of the [[C-Bus (protocol)|same name]], relayed via a pink cable that carries both power and data.  Some products require an additional mains supply.

A single bus segment, referred to as a 'C-Bus network', can address 255 individual devices.  Commercial installations can comprise a number of interconnected networks which are linked together by the use of bridges.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17863">'''Cognitive valence theory''' ('''CVT''') is a theoretical framework that describes and explains the process of intimacy exchange within a dyad relationship. [[Peter A. Andersen]],{{Who?|date=November 2015}} PhD created the cognitive valence theory to answer questions regarding intimacy relationships among colleagues, close friends and intimate friends, married couples and family members.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, 1999, p.229&lt;/ref&gt; Intimacy or immediacy behavior is that behavior that provides closeness or distance within a dyad relationship. Closeness projects a positive feeling in a relationship, and distance projects a negative feeling within a relationship. Intimacy or immediacy behavior can be ''negatively valenced'' or ''positively valenced''.&lt;ref&gt;Guerrero &amp; Hecht, 2008, p. 512&lt;/ref&gt; [[Valence (psychology)|Valence]], associated with [[physics]], is used here to describe the degree of negativity or positivity in expected information. If your partner perceives your actions as negative, then the interaction may repel your partner away from you. If your partner perceives your actions as positive, then the interaction may be accepted and may encourage closeness. Affection and intimacy promotes positive valence in a relationship. CVT uses non-verbal and verbal communications criteria to analyze behavioral situations.&lt;ref name="Guerrero &amp; Hecht, 2008"&gt;Guerrero &amp; Hecht, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

CVT focuses on how intimate relationships are initiated and why only a few relationships are extended past initial contact.&lt;ref name="Guerrero &amp; Hecht, 2008"/&gt; CVT employs six factors or [[schema (psychology)|schemata]] to explain verbal and non-verbal intimacy behaviors, interpersonal perceptions, physiological arousal, social cognition and relational outcomes within a specified relationship.&lt;ref name="Andersen, 1985, pp. 1-36"&gt;Andersen, 1985, pp. 1–36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Andersen, 1989, np"&gt;Andersen, 1989, np&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Andersen, 1998, pp. 39-72"&gt;Andersen, 1998, pp. 39–72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Andersen, 1999, pp. 228-237"&gt;Andersen, 1999, pp. 228–237&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007, pp.181–185&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guerrero &amp; Hecht, 2008, p. 512-514&lt;/ref&gt; CVT utilizes six types of schemata that regulate interpersonal interaction: culture, personality, interpersonal valence, situation, state, and the relationship.&lt;ref name="Andersen, 1985, pp. 1-36"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Andersen, 1989, np"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Andersen, 1998, pp. 39-72"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Andersen, 1999, pp. 228-237"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007, pp.181–185&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guerrero &amp; Hecht, 2008, p. 515-517"&gt;Guerrero &amp; Hecht, 2008, p. 515-517&lt;/ref&gt; Each schema explores intimacy or immediacy behavior when interlaced with human emotion. CVT focuses on these six schemata in relations to moderate levels of arousal in human emotions. Moderate levels of arousal are acceptable in a dyad relationship, but high levels of arousal may cause undue excitement, panic, fear, anger and disorientation.&lt;ref name="Burgoon, Stern, &amp; Dillman, 1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guerrero &amp; Hecht, 2008, p. 515-517"/&gt;

== Nonverbal and verbal communications ==

[[Nonverbal communication]] is the process of communications by sending and receiving messages without speaking. Intimate relations may be affected by the use of nonverbal communications. Nonverbal communications are transmitted through messaging that utilizes [[haptic communication]]s (touching, hugs, kisses and caressing someone); [[body language]] (physical appearance, posture, gestures and eye contact); [[oculesics]] (or eye behavior, including pupil dilation); [[kinesics]] (facial expressions and receptive contact from others); and [[chronemics]] (time spent with someone else or waiting for someone).&lt;ref name="Guerrero &amp; Hecht, 2008, p. 515-517"/&gt; All these nonverbal behaviors can affect intimacy or immediacy within a relationship.

[[Verbal communication]] or dialogue communications also plays an important part in a dyad relationship. While nonverbal communication provides a forum conducive to wordless conversation, verbal conversation can provide the monologue or dialogue to vocally express personal feelings, emotions and supplement nonverbal actions. However, research has shown that only 7% of all communications is directly related to verbal communications. Research further reports that 38% of communications are by the tone of voice and 55% of communication is determined by body language—posture, gestures and eye contact.&lt;ref name="Mehrabian &amp; Ferris, 1967"&gt;Mehrabian &amp; Ferris, 1967, pp. 248–252&lt;/ref&gt;

===Negative and positive valence ===

Negative valence behavior is [[nonverbal communication]] transmission of a behavioral feeling or emotion received in a negative manner. The receiver perceives the negative transmission and may repel your contact or interaction. As in physics, negative particles repel which may cause the receiver of the transmission or communication to avoid your contact.&lt;ref name="Guerrero &amp; Hecht, 2008"/&gt; As the example stated above, initial contact of noticing another person in the grocery store or gas station may not be returned, through an acknowledgement of the initiator’s smile or gesture or the gesture of acknowledgement may purport a stare, frown or other look suggesting “leave me alone” or “not interested.” Intimacy or immediacy may be detrimental to a relationship if that immediacy is negatively accepted by the receiver.

Positive valence behavior is another non-verbal transmission of a behavioral feeling or emotion from one person to another and received in a positive manner. The receiver perceives the positive transmission and may be attracted to that person.&lt;ref name="Guerrero &amp; Hecht, 2008"/&gt; Positive behavior may affect intimacy or immediacy within the dyad relationship, but this positive behavior must be recognized and acknowledged by the receiver or partner.&lt;ref&gt;Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007, pp. 181–185&lt;/ref&gt; Initial contact within an impending dyad relationship may be as simple as noticing another person in a grocery store or gas station. A first look or glance from the initiator may be returned with a smile or gesture of acknowledgement by the receiver. This gesture may then be returned to the initiator as a positive, and further contact may be encouraged.

== Cognitive schemata ==

Andersen (1993, Planap, 1985) suggests that cognitive schemata or our social knowledge help interpret various social interactions. CVT incorporates these six schemata into the regulation or guidance of interpersonal interaction.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, 1999, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Culture ===

[[Culture]] is the total expression of one’s behavior patterns, arts, values, goals, and practices of a population or community.&lt;ref name="Merriam-Webster's collegiate dictionary"&gt;Merriam-Webster collegiate dictionary, 2002, p. 282&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geertz]] (1973) further argues “…this school of thought holds that culture is composed of psychological structures by means of which individuals or groups of individuals guide their behavior”.&lt;ref name="Geertz, 1973"&gt;Geertz, 1973, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Culture plays a definitive role in the formation of human behavior. In some cultures, it is permissible to hold hands; other cultures this open act of compassion is forbidden. Looking or gazing upon another is accepted; other cultures, the eyes are not directed at anyone not of your family. Public affection is acceptable in one country but to kiss, touch or hold someone’s hand is blasphemous. This behavior may be deemed negatively valenced.&lt;ref&gt;Guerrero &amp; Hecht, 2008, p. 515&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Personality ===

[[Personality type|Personality]] or [[personality traits]] also affect intimacy or immediacy within a dyad relationship. Just as humans differ in their size, weight and emotional attributes, human personalities differ in their degree of sociability, their likes and dislikes, the level of tolerance towards shyness and openness and their adherence to [[proxemics]] or the distance displaced from one person towards another. Essentially, this is where knowing your partner’s personality is crucial to a happy relationship. This relationship promotes positive valence or misinterpreting your partner’s personality may promote a negative valence.&lt;ref&gt;Guerrero &amp; Hecht, 2008, p. 513&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Interpersonal valence ===

Interpersonal Valence can be best described as a nonverbal communication typology. A touch from someone you like is received differently than an unwanted touch. Interpersonal valence has a positive affect for socially and physically attractive people and a negative valence for those not so attractive.&lt;ref&gt;Guerrero &amp; Hecht, 2008, p. 516&lt;/ref&gt; This degree of attraction may be within the initiator’s point of view or may also be perceived from the receiver.

=== State ===
Andersen argues here that [[:wikt:mental state|state]] is the internal, short-term condition affecting communications.&lt;ref name="Guerrero &amp; Hecht, 2008"/&gt; This form of state suggests that external behavioral situations affect one’s internal behavioral, coping adaptability. Simply, disagreements at home or at the office signal a negative valence of immediacy or intimacy. An argument with your boss or a disrespectful employee may lower your internal coping adaptability, and negative valence emerges. However, one’s acceptance of intimacy or immediacy is higher when positive valence is experienced. A good day at the office, congratulations on the successful completion a special project or a home cooked meal may amplify positive valence and increase immediacy or intimacy.&lt;ref name="Guerrero &amp; Hecht, 2008"/&gt;

=== The relationship ===

The relationship is the most important part of the cognitive schemata model.&lt;ref&gt;Guerrero &amp; Hecht, 2008, p. 517&lt;/ref&gt; Partnership within a dyad has numerous labels. Within relationships ([[interpersonal relationships]]), we label our dyad partners as acquaintances, friends, colleagues, professional coworkers, personal friends, family members, fellow college students and college professors and, those people whose paths cross with ours simply as convenient contacts.&lt;ref name="Guerrero &amp; Hecht, 2008"/&gt; Each dyad partner, whether initial or long-term may display a level of intimacy or immediacy based on a degree of appropriateness for the situation. Public forums are the stage in which positive or negative valence performs. As stated earlier, an unwanted look or a touch may heighten the degree of negative valence. In contrast, a look or an accepted touch may heighten the degree of positive valence and be the most desirable behavior for each of the dyad partners. Relationships are dependent upon both partners and their commitment to the dyad. Relationships therefore are fragile.&lt;ref&gt;Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive Valence Theory or CVT offers one explanation for this fragility. Negative valence received from any of the cognitive schemata can result in a negative relational outcome.&lt;ref name="Andersen, 1999, p. 229"&gt;Andersen, 1999, p. 229&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guerrero &amp; Hecht, 2008"/&gt; Negative valence reduces the intimacy or immediacy strength within a relationship. Negative valence can also thwart healthy dyad growth by heightening the lack of love and care within the dyad. Positive valence acts in a 180 degree fashion as positive feeling promotes growth and strengthens the love and care within the dyad. With positive valence, there can still be risks, but the rewards may outweigh the costs.

=== Valence violations ===

As mentioned above, valence is the degree of positivity or negativity in expected information. Relational outcomes will become negatively valenced when violations occur within the six schemata. Negative valence here can be associated with the amount of relationships we initially form and the amount of relationships that become long lasting.&lt;ref name="Guerrero &amp; Hecht, 2008"/&gt; Andersen’s cognitive valence theory points out (under relational outcome) how violations of any of the six schemata will affect a dyad relationship. Negative violations can result in (1) negative cognitive and affective appraisals of your partner; (2) compensation/reduction intimacy behaviors, and (3) reductions in relational closeness or disengagement.&lt;ref name="Andersen, 1999, p. 229"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guerrero &amp; Hecht, 2008, p. 514&lt;/ref&gt; The theory further describes the degree of positivity associated with positive relational outcomes within a dyad relationship. Andersen’s cognitive valence theory also points that (under relational outcome) how positive valenced intimacy can  show (1) positive cognitive and affective appraisals of one’s partner; (2) reciprocity or an increase in intimacy behaviors, and (3) increase in relational growth and closeness.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related theories ==

[[Expectancy violations theory]] (EVT) focuses on people’s reactions to unexpected human behavior. Expectancies are primarily based upon social norms and specific characteristics of the communicators.&lt;ref name="McPherson &amp; Yuhua, 2007"&gt;McPherson &amp; Yuhua, 2007, pp. 18–33&lt;/ref&gt; EVT requires determining whether one interactant's behavior change qualifies as a positive or negative violation. Within the realm of involvement and immediacy changes, it predicts that (a) unexpected positive behavior by a positively valenced interactant will produce reciprocal behavior, (b) unexpected negative behavior by a positively valenced interactant will produce compensatory behavior, (c) unexpected negative behavior by a negatively valenced interactant will produce reciprocal negative behavior, and (d) unexpected positive behavior by a negatively valenced interactant may produce either reciprocal or compensatory behavior, depending on which is more salient – the valence of the behavior or the valence of the interactant.&lt;ref name="Burgoon, Stern, &amp; Dillman, 1995"&gt;Burgoon, Stern, &amp; Dillman, 1995, pp. 251–279&lt;/ref&gt; The Arousal-Labeling theory (ALT) likewise posits that both compensation and reciprocity may occur, but the focus of this model is on how the undifferentiated arousal engendered by a partner's behavior change is effectively labeled – positive labels producing reciprocity and negative labels producing compensation.&lt;ref name="Burgoon, Stern, &amp; Dillman, 1995"/&gt; Discrepancy-Arousal theory (DAT) combines arousal and affect with expectancies, predicting that discrepancies from expected behavior patterns produce arousal change, that moderate arousal change is effectively positive and elicits approach (typically reciprocity), and that high arousal change is effectively negative and elicits avoidance (typically compensation).&lt;ref name="Burgoon, Stern, &amp; Dillman, 1995"/&gt;

== Conclusion ==

Cognitive valence theory seeks to describe and explain the process of intimacy exchange within a dyad relationship. CVT accomplishes this process through the employment of six schemata: culture, personality, interpersonal valence, situation, state, and the relationship. Intimacy behaviors provide the strength and positivity to generate close, personal friendships. These friendships may be found in the home family, an impending personal relationship and/or marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Guerrero &amp; Hecht, 2008, 518&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, ''if you want to have a happy marriage, be the kind of person who generates positive energy and sidesteps negative energy rather than empowering it''.&lt;ref name="Covey, 2004"&gt;Covey, 2004, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Control theory''' in [[Control engineering|control systems engineering]] is a subfield of [[mathematics]] that deals with the control of continuously operating [[dynamical system]]s  in engineered processes and machines. The objective is to develop a control model for controlling such systems using a control action in an optimum manner without ''delay or overshoot'' and ensuring control [[Stability theory|stability]].

To do this, a ''[[Controller (control theory)|controller]]'' with the requisite corrective behaviour is required. This controller monitors the controlled process variable (PV), and compares it with the reference or set point (SP). The difference between actual and desired value of the process variable, called the ''error'' signal, or SP-PV error, is applied as feedback to generate a control action to bring the controlled process variable to the same value as the set point. Other aspects which are also studied are  [[controllability]] and [[observability]]. On this is based the advanced type of automation that revolutionized manufacturing, aircraft, communications and other industries. This is ''feedback control'', which is usually ''continuous'' and involves taking measurements using a [[sensor]] and making calculated adjustments to keep the measured variable within a set range by means of a "final control element", such as a [[control valve]].&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, Stuart (1992). A history of control engineering, 1930-1955. IET. p. 48. {{ISBN|978-0-86341-299-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Extensive use is usually made of a diagrammatic style known as the [[block diagram]]. In it the [[transfer function]], also known as the system function or network function, is a mathematical model of the relation between the input and output based on the [[differential equation]]s describing the system.

Control theory dates from the 19th century, when the theoretical basis for the operation of governors was first described by [[James Clerk Maxwell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=J. C. |last=Maxwell |authorlink=James Clerk Maxwell |title=On Governors |date=1868 |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society |volume=100 |issue= |pages= |url=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/On_Governors.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Control theory was further advanced by [[Edward Routh]] in 1874, [[Jacques Charles François Sturm|Charles Sturm]] and in 1895, [[Adolf Hurwitz]], who all contributed to the establishment of control stability criteria; and from 1922 onwards, the development of [[PID control]] theory by [[Nicolas Minorsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Minorsky |first=Nicolas |authorlink=Nicolas Minorsky |title=Directional stability of automatically steered bodies |journal=Journal of the American Society of Naval Engineers |year=1922 |volume=34 |pages=280–309 |issue=2 |ref=harv  |doi=10.1111/j.1559-3584.1922.tb04958.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although a major application of control theory is in control systems engineering, which deals with the design of [[process control]] systems for industry, other applications range far beyond this.  As the general theory of feedback systems, control theory is useful wherever feedback occurs.

==History==
[[File:Boulton and Watt centrifugal governor-MJ.jpg|thumb|right|[[Centrifugal governor]] in a [[Boulton &amp; Watt engine]] of 1788]]

Although control systems of various types date back to antiquity, a more formal analysis of the field began with a dynamics analysis of the [[centrifugal governor]], conducted by the physicist [[James Clerk Maxwell]] in 1868, entitled ''On Governors''.&lt;ref name="Maxwell1867"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Maxwell, J.C.|year=1868|title=On Governors|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London|volume=16|pages=270–283|doi=10.1098/rspl.1867.0055|jstor=112510}}&lt;!--| accessdate = 2008-04-14--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This described and analyzed the phenomenon of [[self-oscillation]], in which lags in the system may lead to overcompensation and unstable behavior. This generated a flurry of interest in the topic, during which Maxwell's classmate, [[Edward John Routh]], abstracted Maxwell's results for the general class of linear systems.&lt;ref name=Routh1975&gt;{{cite book

A notable application of dynamic control was in the area of manned flight. The [[Wright brothers]] made their first successful test flights on December 17, 1903 and were distinguished by their ability to control their flights for substantial periods (more so than the ability to produce lift from an airfoil, which was known). Continuous, reliable control of the airplane was necessary for flights lasting longer than a few seconds.

By [[World War II]], control theory was becoming an important area of research. [[Irmgard Flügge-Lotz]] developed the theory of discontinuous automatic control systems, and applied the [[bang–bang control|bang-bang principle]] to the development of [[autopilot|automatic flight control equipment]] for aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Flugge-Lotz|first1=Irmgard|last2=Titus|first2=Harold A.|title=Optimum and Quasi-Optimum Control of Third and Fourth-Order Systems|journal=Stanford University Technical Report|date=October 1962|issue=134|pages=8–12|url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/621137.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hallion|first1=Richard P.|editor1-last=Sicherman|editor1-first=Barbara|editor2-last=Green|editor2-first=Carol Hurd|editor3-last=Kantrov|editor3-first=Ilene|editor4-last=Walker|editor4-first=Harriette|title=Notable American Women: The Modern Period: A Biographical Dictionary|date=1980|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=9781849722704|pages=241–242}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other areas of application for discontinuous controls included [[fire-control system]]s, [[guidance system]]s and [[electronics]].

A [[Centrifugal governor]] is used to regulate the windmill velocity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.302.5633&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Control Theory: History, Mathematical Achievements and Perspectives | E. Fernandez-Cara1 and E. Zuazua]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes, mechanical methods are used to improve the stability of systems. For example, [[Stabilizer (ship)|ship stabilizers]] are fins mounted beneath the waterline and emerging laterally.  In contemporary vessels, they may be gyroscopically controlled active fins, which have the capacity to change their angle of attack to counteract roll caused by wind or waves acting on the ship.

The [[Space Race]] also depended on accurate spacecraft control, and control theory has also seen an increasing use in fields such as economics.

==Open-loop and closed-loop (feedback) control==
[[File:Feedback loop with descriptions.svg|thumb|right|400px|A [[block diagram]] of a [[negative feedback]] [[control system]] using a [[feedback loop]] to control the process variable by comparing it with a desired value, and applying the difference as an error signal to generate a control output to reduce or eliminate the error.]]
[[File:Industrial control loop.jpg|thumb|400px|Example of a single industrial control loop; showing continuously modulated control of process flow.]]
Fundamentally, there are two types of control loops: open loop control and closed loop (feedback) control.

In open loop control, the control action from the controller is independent of the "process output" (or "controlled process variable" - PV). A good example of this is a central heating boiler controlled only by a timer, so that heat is applied for a constant time, regardless of the temperature of the building. The control action is the timed switching on/off of the boiler, the process variable is the building temperature, but neither is linked.

In closed loop control, the control action from the controller is dependent on feedback from the process in the form of the value of the process variable (PV). In the case of the boiler analogy, a closed loop would include a thermostat to compare the building temperature (PV) with the temperature set on the thermostat (the set point - SP). This generates a controller output to maintain the building at the desired temperature by switching the boiler on and off. A closed loop controller, therefore, has a feedback loop which ensures the controller exerts a control action to manipulate the process variable to be the same as the "Reference input" or  "set point". For this reason, closed loop controllers are also called feedback controllers.&lt;ref&gt;"Feedback and control systems" - JJ Di Steffano, AR Stubberud, IJ Williams. Schaums outline series, McGraw-Hill 1967&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of a closed loop control system according to the British Standard Institution is "a control system possessing monitoring feedback, the deviation signal formed as a result of this feedback being used to control the action of a final control element in such a way as to tend to reduce the deviation to zero." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= The Origins of Feedback Control|last=Mayr|first= Otto| author-link= Otto Mayr |year= 1970
|publisher =The Colonial Press, Inc.|location= Clinton, MA USA|isbn= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise; "A ''Feedback Control System'' is a system which tends to maintain a prescribed relationship of one system variable to another by comparing functions of these variables and using the difference as a means of control."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= The Origins of Feedback Control|last=Mayr|first= Otto| author-link= Otto Mayr |year= 1969|publisher =The Colonial Press, Inc.|location= Clinton, MA USA|isbn= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other examples===
An example of a control system is a car's [[cruise control]], which is a device designed to maintain vehicle speed at a constant ''desired'' or ''reference'' speed provided by the driver. The ''controller'' is the cruise control, the ''plant'' is the car, and the ''system'' is the car and the cruise control. The system output is the car's speed, and the control itself is the engine's [[throttle]] position which determines how much power the engine delivers.

A primitive way to implement cruise control is simply to lock the throttle position when the driver engages cruise control.  However, if the cruise control is engaged on a stretch of flat road, then the car will travel slower going uphill and faster when going downhill. This type of controller is called an ''[[open-loop controller]]'' because there is no [[feedback]]; no measurement of the system output (the car's speed) is used to alter the control (the throttle position.) As a result, the controller cannot compensate for changes acting on the car, like a change in the slope of the road.

In a ''[[closed-loop controller|closed-loop control system]]'', data from a sensor monitoring the car's speed (the system output) enters a controller which continuously compares the quantity representing the speed with the reference quantity representing the desired speed. The difference, called the error, determines the throttle position (the control). The result is to match the car's speed to the reference speed (maintain the desired system output). Now, when the car goes uphill, the difference between the input (the sensed speed) and the reference continuously determines the throttle position. As the sensed speed drops below the reference, the difference increases, the throttle opens, and engine power increases, speeding up the vehicle. In this way, the controller dynamically counteracts changes to the car's speed.  The central idea of these control systems is the ''feedback loop'', the controller affects the system output, which in turn is measured and fed back to the controller.

==Classical control theory==
{{main|Classical control theory}}

To overcome the limitations of the [[open-loop controller]], control theory introduces [[feedback]].
A [[closed-loop controller]] uses feedback to control [[state (controls)|states]] or [[Negative feedback#Overview|outputs]] of a [[dynamical system]]. Its name comes from the information path in the system: process inputs (e.g., [[voltage]] applied to an [[electric motor]]) have an effect on the process outputs (e.g., speed or torque of the motor), which is measured with [[sensor]]s and processed by the controller; the result (the control signal) is "fed back" as input to the process, closing the loop.

Closed-loop controllers have the following advantages over [[open-loop controller]]s:
* disturbance rejection (such as hills in the cruise control example above)
* guaranteed performance even with [[mathematical model|model]] uncertainties, when the model structure does not match perfectly the real process and the model parameters are not exact
* [[instability|unstable]] processes can be stabilized
* reduced sensitivity to parameter variations
* improved reference tracking performance

In some systems, closed-loop and open-loop control are used simultaneously. In such systems, the open-loop control is termed [[feed forward (control)|feedforward]] and serves to further improve reference tracking performance.

A common closed-loop controller architecture is the [[PID controller]].

==Closed-loop transfer function==
{{details|closed-loop transfer function}}
The output of the system ''y(t)'' is fed back through a sensor measurement ''F'' to a comparison with the reference value ''r(t)''. The controller ''C'' then takes the error ''e'' (difference) between the reference and the output to change the inputs ''u'' to the system under control ''P''. This is shown in the figure. This kind of controller is a closed-loop controller or feedback controller.

This is called a single-input-single-output (''SISO'') control system; ''MIMO'' (i.e., Multi-Input-Multi-Output) systems, with more than one input/output, are common. In such cases variables are represented through [[coordinate vector|vectors]] instead of simple [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] values. For some [[distributed parameter systems]] the vectors may be infinite-[[Dimension (vector space)|dimensional]] (typically functions).

[[File:simple feedback control loop2.svg|center|A simple feedback control loop]]

If we assume the controller ''C'', the plant ''P'', and the sensor ''F'' are [[linear]] and [[time-invariant]] (i.e., elements of their [[transfer function]] ''C(s)'', ''P(s)'', and ''F(s)'' do not depend on time), the systems above can be analysed using the [[Laplace transform]] on the variables. This gives the following relations:

: &lt;math&gt;Y(s) = P(s) U(s)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;U(s) = C(s) E(s)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;E(s) = R(s) - F(s)Y(s).&lt;/math&gt;

Solving for ''Y''(''s'') in terms of ''R''(''s'') gives

: &lt;math&gt;Y(s) = \left( \frac{P(s)C(s)}{1 + P(s)C(s)F(s)} \right) R(s) = H(s)R(s).&lt;/math&gt;

The expression &lt;math&gt;H(s) = \frac{P(s)C(s)}{1 + F(s)P(s)C(s)}&lt;/math&gt; is referred to as the ''closed-loop transfer function'' of the system. The numerator is the forward (open-loop) gain from ''r'' to ''y'', and the denominator is one plus the gain in going around the feedback loop, the so-called loop gain. If &lt;math&gt;|P(s)C(s)| \gg 1&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., it has a large [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] with each value of ''s'', and if &lt;math&gt;|F(s)| \approx 1&lt;/math&gt;, then ''Y(s)'' is approximately equal to ''R(s)'' and the output closely tracks the reference input.

==PID feedback control==
{{main |PID Controller}}
[[File:PID en.svg|right|thumb|400x400px|A [[block diagram]] of a PID controller in a feedback loop, r(''t'') is the desired process value or "set point", and y(''t'') is the measured process value.]]
A '''proportional–integral–derivative controller ''' ('''PID controller''') is a  [[control loop]] [[feedback mechanism]] control technique widely  used in control systems.

A PID controller continuously calculates an ''error value'' &lt;math&gt;e(t)&lt;/math&gt; as the difference between a desired [[Setpoint (control system)|setpoint]] and a measured [[process variable]] and applies a correction based on [[Proportional control|proportional]], [[integral]], and [[derivative]] terms. ''PID'' is an initialism for ''Proportional-Integral-Derivative'', referring to the three terms operating on the error signal to produce a control signal.

The theoretical understanding and application dates from the 1920s, and they are implemented in nearly all analogue control systems; originally in mechanical controllers, and then using discrete electronics and latterly in industrial process computers.
The [[PID controller]] is probably the most-used feedback control design.

If ''u(t)'' is the control signal sent to the system, ''y(t)'' is the measured output and ''r(t)'' is the desired output, and &lt;math&gt;e(t)=r(t)- y(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the tracking error, a PID controller has the general form

:&lt;math&gt;u(t) =  K_P e(t) + K_I \int e(\tau)\text{d}\tau + K_D \frac{\text{de(t)}}{\text{d}t}.&lt;/math&gt;

The desired closed loop dynamics is obtained by adjusting the three parameters &lt;math&gt; K_P&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; K_I&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; K_D&lt;/math&gt;, often iteratively by "tuning" and without specific knowledge of a plant model. Stability can often be ensured using only the proportional term. The integral term permits the rejection of a step disturbance (often a striking specification in [[process control]]). The derivative term is used to provide damping or shaping of the response. PID controllers are the most well-established class of control systems: however, they cannot be used in several more complicated cases, especially if [[MIMO]] systems are considered.

Applying Laplace transformation results in the transformed PID controller equation

:&lt;math&gt;u(s) =  K_P e(s) + K_I \frac{1}{s} e(s) + K_D s e(s)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;u(s) =  \left(K_P + K_I \frac{1}{s} + K_D s\right) e(s)&lt;/math&gt;

with the PID controller transfer function
:&lt;math&gt;C(s) = \left(K_P + K_I \frac{1}{s} + K_D s\right).&lt;/math&gt;

As an example of tuning a PID controller in the closed-loop system &lt;math&gt;H(s)&lt;/math&gt;, consider a 1st order plant given by

:&lt;math&gt;P(s) = \frac{A}{1 + sT_P}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T_P&lt;/math&gt; are some constants. The plant output is fed back through

:&lt;math&gt;F(s) = \frac{1}{1 + sT_F}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;T_F&lt;/math&gt; is also a constant. Now if we set &lt;math&gt;K_P=K\left(1+\frac{T_D}{T_I}\right)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;K_D=KT_D&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;K_I=\frac{K}{T_I}&lt;/math&gt;, we can express the PID controller transfer function in series form as

:&lt;math&gt;C(s) =  K \left(1 + \frac{1}{sT_I}\right)(1 + sT_D)&lt;/math&gt;

Plugging &lt;math&gt;P(s)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;F(s)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;C(s)&lt;/math&gt; into the closed-loop transfer function &lt;math&gt;H(s)&lt;/math&gt;, we find that by setting

:&lt;math&gt;K = \frac{1}{A},   T_I = T_F,   T_D = T_P&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;H(s) = 1&lt;/math&gt;. With this tuning in this example, the system output follows the reference input exactly.

However, in practice, a pure differentiator is neither physically realizable nor desirable&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ang |first1=K.H. |last2=Chong |first2=G.C.Y. |last3=Li |first3=Y. |date=2005 |title=PID control system analysis, design, and technology |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=1453566 |journal=IEEE Transactions on Control Systems and Technology |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=559–576}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to amplification of noise and resonant modes in the system. Therefore, a [[Lead–lag compensator|phase-lead compensator]] type approach or a differentiator with low-pass roll-off are used instead.

==Linear and nonlinear control theory==
The field of control theory can be divided into two branches:
* ''[[Linear control theory]]'' – This applies to systems made of devices which obey the [[superposition principle]], which means roughly that the output is proportional to the input.  They are governed by [[linear equation|linear]] [[differential equation]]s.  A major subclass is systems which in addition have parameters which do not change with time, called ''[[linear time invariant]]'' (LTI) systems.   These systems are amenable to powerful [[frequency domain]] mathematical techniques of great generality, such as the [[Laplace transform]], [[Fourier transform]], [[Z transform]], [[Bode plot]], [[root locus]], and [[Nyquist stability criterion]].  These lead to a description of the system using terms like [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], [[frequency response]], [[eigenvalue]]s, [[gain (electronics)|gain]], [[resonant frequency|resonant frequencies]], [[zeros and poles]], which give solutions for system response and design techniques for most systems of interest. 
* ''[[Nonlinear control theory]]'' – This covers a wider class of systems that do not obey the superposition principle, and applies to more real-world systems because all real control systems are nonlinear.  These systems are often governed by [[nonlinear differential equation]]s.  The few mathematical techniques which have been developed to handle them are more difficult and much less general, often applying only to narrow categories of systems.  These include [[limit cycle]] theory, [[Poincaré map]]s, [[Lyapunov function|Lyapunov stability theorem]], and [[describing function]]s.  Nonlinear systems are often analyzed using [[numerical method]]s on computers, for example by [[simulation|simulating]] their operation using a [[simulation language]].  If only solutions near a stable point are of interest, nonlinear systems can often be [[linearization|linearized]] by approximating them by a linear system using [[perturbation theory]], and linear techniques can be used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathworks.com/help/toolbox/simulink/slref/trim.html trim point]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis techniques - frequency domain and time domain==
Mathematical techniques for analyzing and designing control systems fall into two different categories:
* ''[[Frequency domain]]'' – In this type the values of the [[state variable]]s, the mathematical [[variable (mathematics)|variables]] representing the system's input, output and feedback are represented as functions of [[frequency]].  The input signal and the system's [[transfer function]] are converted from time functions to functions of frequency by a [[transform (mathematics)|transform]] such as the [[Fourier transform]], [[Laplace transform]], or [[Z transform]].  The advantage of this technique is that it results in a simplification of the mathematics; the ''[[differential equation]]s'' that represent the system are replaced by ''[[algebraic equation]]s'' in the frequency domain which is much simpler to solve.  However, frequency domain techniques can only be used with linear systems, as mentioned above.
* ''[[Time-domain state space representation]]'' – In this type the values of the [[state variable]]s are represented as functions of time.  With this model, the system being analyzed is represented by one or more [[differential equation]]s.  Since frequency domain techniques are limited to [[linear function|linear]] systems, time domain is widely used to analyze real-world nonlinear systems.   Although these are more difficult to solve, modern computer simulation techniques such as [[simulation language]]s have made their analysis routine.
In contrast to the frequency domain analysis of the classical control theory, modern control theory utilizes the time-domain [[state space (controls)|state space]] representation, a mathematical model of a physical system as a set of input, output and state variables related by first-order differential equations. To abstract from the number of inputs, outputs, and states, the variables are expressed as vectors and the differential and algebraic equations are written in matrix form (the latter only being possible when the dynamical system is linear). The state space representation (also known as the "time-domain approach") provides a convenient and compact way to model and analyze systems with multiple inputs and outputs. With inputs and outputs, we would otherwise have to write down Laplace transforms to encode all the information about a system. Unlike the frequency domain approach, the use of the state-space representation is not limited to systems with linear components and zero initial conditions. "State space" refers to the space whose axes are the state variables. The state of the system can be represented as a point within that space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=State space &amp; linear systems|series=Schaum's outline series |publisher=McGraw Hill|author=Donald M Wiberg|isbn=0-07-070096-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Terrell, William|title=Some fundamental control theory I: Controllability, observability, and duality —AND— Some fundamental control Theory II: Feedback linearization of single input nonlinear systems|journal=American Mathematical Monthly|volume=106|year=1999|pages=705–719 and 812–828|url=http://www.maa.org/programs/maa-awards/writing-awards/some-fundamental-control-theory-i-controllability-observability-and-duality-and-some-fundamental|doi=10.2307/2589614}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==System interfacing - SISO &amp; MIMO==
Control systems can be divided into different categories depending on the number of inputs and outputs.
* [[Single-input single-output system|Single-input single-output]] (SISO) – This is the simplest and most common type, in which one output is controlled by one control signal.  Examples are the cruise control example above, or an [[audio system]], in which the control input is the input audio signal and the output is the sound waves from the speaker. 
* [[MIMO|Multiple-input multiple-output]] (MIMO) – These are found in more complicated systems.  For example, modern large [[telescope]]s such as the [[Keck telescopes|Keck]] and [[MMT Observatory|MMT]] have mirrors composed of many separate segments each controlled by an [[actuator]].  The shape of the entire mirror is constantly adjusted by a MIMO [[active optics]] control system using input from multiple sensors at the focal plane, to compensate for changes in the mirror shape due to thermal expansion, contraction, stresses as it is rotated and distortion of the [[wavefront]] due to turbulence in the atmosphere.  Complicated systems such as [[nuclear reactor]]s and human [[cell (biology)|cells]] are simulated by a computer as large MIMO control systems.

==Topics in control theory==

===Stability===

The ''stability'' of a general [[dynamical system]] with no input can be described with [[Lyapunov stability]] criteria.
*A [[linear system]] is called [[BIBO stability|bounded-input bounded-output (BIBO) stable]] if its output will stay [[bounded function|bounded]] for any bounded input.
*Stability for [[nonlinear system]]s that take an input is [[input-to-state stability]] (ISS), which combines Lyapunov stability and a notion similar to BIBO stability.

For simplicity, the following descriptions focus on continuous-time and discrete-time '''linear systems'''.

Mathematically, this means that for a causal linear system to be stable all of the [[Pole (complex analysis)|poles]] of its [[transfer function]] must have negative-real values, i.e. the real part of each pole must be less than zero.  Practically speaking, stability requires that the transfer function complex poles reside
* in the open left half of the [[complex plane]] for continuous time, when the [[Laplace transform]] is used to obtain the transfer function.
* inside the [[unit circle]] for discrete time, when the [[Z-transform]] is used.
The difference between the two cases is simply due to the traditional method of plotting continuous time versus discrete time transfer functions. The continuous Laplace transform is in [[Cartesian coordinates]] where the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; axis is the real axis and the discrete Z-transform is in [[circular coordinates]] where the &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; axis is the real axis.

When the appropriate conditions above are satisfied a system is said to be [[asymptotic stability|asymptotically stable]]; the variables of an asymptotically stable control system always decrease from their initial value and do not show permanent oscillations. Permanent oscillations occur when a pole has a real part exactly equal to zero (in the continuous time case) or a modulus equal to one (in the discrete time case). If a simply stable system response neither decays nor grows over time, and has no oscillations, it is [[marginal stability|marginally stable]]; in this case the system transfer function has non-repeated poles at the complex plane origin (i.e. their real and complex component is zero in the continuous time case). Oscillations are present when poles with real part equal to zero have an imaginary part not equal to zero.

If a system in question has an [[impulse response]] of

:&lt;math&gt;\ x[n] = 0.5^n u[n]&lt;/math&gt;

then the Z-transform (see [[Z-transform#Example 2 (causal ROC)|this example]]), is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\ X(z) = \frac{1}{1 - 0.5z^{-1}}&lt;/math&gt;

which has a pole in &lt;math&gt;z = 0.5&lt;/math&gt; (zero [[imaginary number|imaginary part]]). This system is BIBO (asymptotically) stable since the pole is ''inside'' the unit circle.

However, if the impulse response was

:&lt;math&gt;\ x[n] = 1.5^n u[n]&lt;/math&gt;

then the Z-transform is

:&lt;math&gt;\ X(z) = \frac{1}{1 - 1.5z^{-1}}&lt;/math&gt;

which has a pole at &lt;math&gt;z = 1.5&lt;/math&gt; and is not BIBO stable since the pole has a modulus strictly greater than one.

Numerous tools exist for the analysis of the poles of a system. These include graphical systems like the [[root locus]], [[Bode plot]]s or the [[Nyquist plot]]s.

Mechanical changes can make equipment (and control systems) more stable. Sailors add ballast to improve the stability of ships. Cruise ships use [[Ship stability#Stabilizer fins|antiroll fins]] that extend transversely from the side of the ship for perhaps 30 feet (10 m) and are continuously rotated about their axes to develop forces that oppose the roll.

===Controllability and observability===
{{Main| Controllability|Observability}}

[[Controllability]] and [[observability]] are main issues in the analysis of a system before deciding the best control strategy to be applied, or whether it is even possible to control or stabilize the system. Controllability is related to the possibility of forcing the system into a particular state by using an appropriate control signal. If a state is not controllable, then no signal will ever be able to control the state. If a state is not controllable, but its dynamics are stable, then the state is termed ''stabilizable''. Observability instead is related to the possibility of ''observing'', through output measurements, the state of a system. If a state is not observable, the controller will never be able to determine the behavior of an unobservable state and hence cannot use it to stabilize the system. However, similar to the stabilizability condition above, if a state cannot be observed it might still be detectable.

From a geometrical point of view, looking at the states of each variable of the system to be controlled, every "bad" state of these variables must be controllable and observable to ensure a good behavior in the closed-loop system. That is, if one of the [[eigenvalues]] of the system is not both controllable and observable, this part of the dynamics will remain untouched in the closed-loop system. If such an eigenvalue is not stable, the dynamics of this eigenvalue will be present in the closed-loop system which therefore will be unstable. Unobservable poles are not present in the transfer function realization of a state-space representation, which is why sometimes the latter is preferred in dynamical systems analysis.

Solutions to problems of an uncontrollable or unobservable system include adding actuators and sensors.

===Control specification===
Several different control strategies have been devised in the past years. These vary from extremely general ones ([[PID controller]]), to others devoted to very particular classes of systems (especially [[robotics]] or aircraft cruise control).

A control problem can have several specifications. Stability, of course, is always present. The controller must ensure that the closed-loop system is stable, regardless of the open-loop stability. A poor choice of controller can even worsen the stability of the open-loop system, which must normally be avoided. Sometimes it would be desired to obtain particular dynamics in the closed loop: i.e. that the poles have &lt;math&gt;Re[\lambda] &lt; -\overline{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\overline{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt; is a fixed value strictly greater than zero, instead of simply asking that &lt;math&gt;Re[\lambda]&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;.

Another typical specification is the rejection of a step disturbance; including an [[integrator]] in the open-loop chain (i.e. directly before the system under control) easily achieves this. Other classes of disturbances need different types of sub-systems to be included.

Other "classical" control theory specifications regard the time-response of the closed-loop system. These include the [[rise time]] (the time needed by the control system to reach the desired value after a perturbation), peak [[overshoot (signal)|overshoot]] (the highest value reached by the response before reaching the desired value) and others ([[settling time]], quarter-decay). Frequency domain specifications are usually related to [[robust control|robustness]] (see after).

Modern performance assessments use some variation of integrated tracking error (IAE,ISA,CQI).

===Model identification and robustness===
A control system must always have some robustness property. A [[robust control]]ler is such that its properties do not change much if applied to a system slightly different from the mathematical one used for its synthesis. This requirement is important, as no real physical system truly behaves like the series of differential equations used to represent it mathematically. Typically a simpler mathematical model is chosen in order to simplify calculations, otherwise, the true system dynamics can be so complicated that a complete model is impossible.

;System identification
{{details|System identification}}
The process of determining the equations that govern the model's dynamics is called [[system identification]]. This can be done off-line: for example, executing a series of measures from which to calculate an approximated mathematical model, typically its [[transfer function]] or matrix. Such identification from the output, however, cannot take account of unobservable dynamics. Sometimes the model is built directly starting from known physical equations, for example, in the case of a [[Damping#Example: mass–spring–damper|mass-spring-damper]] system we know that &lt;math&gt; m \ddot{{x}}(t) = - K x(t) - \Beta \dot{x}(t)&lt;/math&gt;. Even assuming that a "complete" model is used in designing the controller, all the parameters included in these equations (called "nominal parameters") are never known with absolute precision; the control system will have to behave correctly even when connected to a physical system with true parameter values away from nominal.

Some advanced control techniques include an "on-line" identification process (see later). The parameters of the model are calculated ("identified") while the controller itself is running. In this way, if a drastic variation of the parameters ensues, for example, if the robot's arm releases a weight, the controller will adjust itself consequently in order to ensure the correct performance.

;Analysis
Analysis of the robustness of a SISO (single input single output) control system can be performed in the frequency domain, considering the system's transfer function and using [[Nyquist diagram|Nyquist]] and [[Bode diagram]]s. Topics include [[Bode plot#Gain margin and phase margin|gain and phase margin]] and amplitude margin. For MIMO (multi-input multi output) and, in general, more complicated control systems, one must consider the theoretical results devised for each control technique (see next section). I.e., if particular robustness qualities are needed, the engineer must shift his attention to a control technique by including them in its properties.

;Constraints
A particular robustness issue is the requirement for a control system to perform properly in the presence of input and state constraints. In the physical world every signal is limited. It could happen that a controller will send control signals that cannot be followed by the physical system, for example, trying to rotate a valve at excessive speed. This can produce undesired behavior of the closed-loop system, or even damage or break actuators or other subsystems. Specific control techniques are available to solve the problem: [[model predictive control]] (see later), and [[anti-wind up system (control)|anti-wind up systems]]. The latter consists of an additional control block that ensures that the control signal never exceeds a given threshold.

==System classifications==

===Linear systems control===
{{Main|State space (controls)}}
For MIMO systems, pole placement can be performed mathematically using a [[State space (controls)|state space representation]] of the open-loop system and calculating a feedback matrix assigning poles in the desired positions. In complicated systems this can require computer-assisted calculation capabilities, and cannot always ensure robustness. Furthermore, all system states are not in general measured and so observers must be included and incorporated in pole placement design.

===Nonlinear systems control===
{{Main|Nonlinear control}}
Processes in industries like [[robotics]] and the [[aerospace industry]] typically have strong nonlinear dynamics. In control theory it is sometimes possible to linearize such classes of systems and apply linear techniques, but in many cases it can be necessary to devise from scratch theories permitting control of nonlinear systems. These, e.g., [[feedback linearization]], [[backstepping]], [[sliding mode control]], trajectory linearization control normally take advantage of results based on [[Lyapunov's theory]]. [[Differential geometry]] has been widely used as a tool for generalizing well-known linear control concepts to the non-linear case, as well as showing the subtleties that make it a more challenging problem.  Control theory has also been used to decipher the neural mechanism that directs cognitive states.&lt;ref name=Shi_Gu_et_al&gt;{{cite journal |author1 = Gu Shi|year = 2015 |title = Controllability of structural brain networks (Article Number 8414) |journal = Nature Communications |quote = Here we use tools from control and network theories to offer a mechanistic explanation for how the brain moves between cognitive states drawn from the network organization of white matter microstructure.  |laysummary = http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/151001/ncomms9414/full/ncomms9414.html |doi = 10.1038/ncomms9414|issue = 6 |display-authors=etal|arxiv = 1406.5197|bibcode = 2015NatCo...6E8414G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decentralized systems control===
{{Main|Distributed control system}}
When the system is controlled by multiple controllers, the problem is one of decentralized control. Decentralization is helpful in many ways, for instance, it helps control systems to operate over a larger geographical area. The agents in decentralized control systems can interact using communication channels and coordinate their actions.

===Deterministic and stochastic systems control===
{{Main|Stochastic control}}

A stochastic control problem is one in which the evolution of the state variables is subjected to random shocks from outside the system. A deterministic control problem is not subject to external random shocks.

==Main control strategies==
Every control system must guarantee first the stability of the closed-loop behavior. For [[linear system]]s, this can be obtained by directly placing the poles. Non-linear control systems use specific theories (normally based on [[Aleksandr Lyapunov]]'s Theory) to ensure stability without regard to the inner dynamics of the system. The possibility to fulfill different specifications varies from the model considered and the control strategy chosen.

;List of the main control techniques

*[[Adaptive control]] uses on-line identification of the process parameters, or modification of controller gains, thereby obtaining strong robustness properties. Adaptive controls were applied for the first time in the [[aerospace industry]] in the 1950s, and have found particular success in that field.
*A [[hierarchical control system]] is a type of [[control system]] in which a set of devices and governing software is arranged in a [[hierarchical]] [[tree (data structure)|tree]].  When the links in the tree are implemented by a [[computer network]], then that hierarchical control system is also a form of [[networked control system]].
*[[Intelligent control]] uses various AI computing approaches like [[artificial neural networks]], [[Bayesian probability]], [[fuzzy logic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=A novel fuzzy framework for nonlinear system control| journal=Fuzzy Sets and Systems | year=2010 | last=Liu |first1=Jie |author2=Wilson Wang |author3=Farid Golnaraghi |author4=Eric Kubica | volume=161 | issue=21 | pages=2746–2759 | doi=10.1016/j.fss.2010.04.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[machine learning]], [[evolutionary computation]] and [[genetic algorithms]] to control a [[dynamic system]].
*[[Optimal control]] is a particular control technique in which the control signal optimizes a certain "cost index": for example, in the case of a satellite, the jet thrusts needed to bring it to desired trajectory that consume the least amount of fuel. Two optimal control design methods have been widely used in industrial applications, as it has been shown they can guarantee closed-loop stability. These are [[Model Predictive Control]] (MPC) and [[linear-quadratic-Gaussian control]] (LQG). The first can more explicitly take into account constraints on the signals in the system, which is an important feature in many industrial processes. However, the "optimal control" structure in MPC is only a means to achieve such a result, as it does not optimize a true performance index of the closed-loop control system. Together with PID controllers, MPC systems are the most widely used control technique in [[process control]].
*[[Robust control]] deals explicitly with uncertainty in its approach to controller design.  Controllers designed using ''robust control'' methods tend to be able to cope with small differences between the true system and the nominal model used for design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Melby|first1=Paul|last2=et.|first2=al.|title=Robustness of Adaptation in Controlled Self-Adjusting Chaotic Systems |journal=Fluctuation and Noise Letters |date=2002|doi=10.1142/S0219477502000919}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early methods of [[Hendrik Wade Bode|Bode]] and others were fairly robust; the state-space methods invented in the 1960s and 1970s were sometimes found to lack robustness.  Examples of modern robust control techniques include [[H-infinity loop-shaping]] developed by [[Duncan McFarlane]] and [[Keith Glover]] of [[Cambridge University]], United Kingdom, [[Sliding mode control]] (SMC) developed by [[Vadim Utkin]], and safe protocols designed for control of large heterogeneous populations of electric loads in Smart Power Grid applications.&lt;ref name='TCL1'&gt;{{cite journal|title=Safe Protocols for Generating Power Pulses with Heterogeneous Populations of Thermostatically Controlled Loads |author=N.

*[[Stochastic control]] deals with control design with uncertainty in the model. In typical stochastic control problems, it is assumed that there exist random noise and disturbances in the model and the controller, and the control design must take into account these random deviations.
*[[Energy-shaping control]] view the plant and the controller as energy-transformation devices. The control strategy is formulated in terms of interconnection (in a power-preserving manner) in order to achieve a desired behavior.
*[[Self-organized criticality control]] may be defined as attempts to interfere in the processes by which the [[self-organized]] system dissipates energy.

==People in systems and control==
{{Main|People in systems and control}}
Many active and historical figures made significant contribution to control theory including
* [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] invented the [[Z-transform]] in his work on [[probability theory]], now used to solve discrete-time control theory problems. The Z-transform is a discrete-time equivalent of the [[Laplace transform]] which is named after him.
* [[Irmgard Flugge-Lotz]] developed the theory of [[bang-bang control|discontinuous automatic control]] and applied it to [[autopilot|automatic aircraft control systems]].
* [[Alexander Lyapunov]] in the 1890s marks the beginning of [[stability theory]].
* [[Harold Stephen Black|Harold S. Black]] invented the concept of [[negative feedback amplifier]]s in 1927. He managed to develop stable negative feedback amplifiers in the 1930s.
* [[Harry Nyquist]] developed the [[Nyquist stability criterion]] for feedback systems in the 1930s.
* [[Richard Bellman]] developed [[dynamic programming]] since the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |author=[[Richard Bellman]] |date=1964 |title=Control Theory |url=http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v211/n3/pdf/scientificamerican0964-186.pdf |magazine=[[Scientific American]] |volume=211 |issue=3 |pages=186–200}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Andrey Kolmogorov]] co-developed the [[Wiener filter|Wiener–Kolmogorov filter]] in 1941.
* [[Norbert Wiener]] co-developed the Wiener–Kolmogorov filter and coined the term [[cybernetics]] in the 1940s.
* [[John R. Ragazzini]] introduced [[digital control]] and the use of [[Z-transform]] in control theory (invented by Laplace) in the 1950s.
* [[Lev Pontryagin]] introduced the [[Pontryagin's minimum principle|maximum principle]] and the [[Bang-bang control|bang-bang principle]].
* [[Pierre-Louis Lions]]  developed [[viscosity solutions]] into stochastic control and [[optimal control]] methods.
* [[Rudolf Kalman]]  pioneered the [[state-space]] approach to systems and control. Introduced the notions of [[controllability]] and [[observability]]. Developed the [[Kalman filter]] for linear estimation.
* [[Ali H. Nayfeh]]  who was one of the main contributors to Non-Linear Control Theory and published many books on Perturbation Methods
* [[Jan Camiel Willems|Jan C. Willems]] Introduced the concept of dissipativity, as a generalization of [[Lyapunov function]] to input/state/output systems.The construction of the storage function, as the analogue of a Lyapunov function is called, led to the study of the [[linear matrix inequality]] (LMI) in control theory.  He pioneered the behavioral approach to mathematical systems theory.

[[File:Butatriene-3D-balls.png|thumb|1,2,3-Butatriene, the simplest cumulene]]


A '''cumulene''' is a [[hydrocarbon]] with three or more ''cumulative'' (consecutive) [[double bond]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=cumulenes| file = C01440}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are analogous to [[allene]]s, only having a more extensive chain. The simplest molecule in this class is '''butatriene''' (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C=C=C=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), which is also called simply ''cumulene''. Unlike most [[alkane]]s and [[alkene]]s, cumulenes tend to be rigid, comparable to [[alkynes]], which makes them appealing for [[molecular nanotechnology]]. [[Polyyne]]s are another kind of rigid carbon chains.  Cumulenes are found in regions of outer space where hydrogen is rare (see [[astrochemistry]]). Cumulenes containing heteroatoms are called [[heterocumulene]]s;&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=heterocumulenes| file = H02797}}&lt;/ref&gt; an example is [[carbon suboxide]].

==Synthesis==
The first reported synthesis of a butatriene is that of tetraphenylbutatriene in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brand|first1=K.|title=Über Untersuchungen in der Tetraarylbutan-Reihe und über das 1.1 4.4-Tetraphenyl-butatrien. (4. Mitteilung über die Reduktion organischer Halogen-verbindungen.)|journal=Berichte der deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft (A and B Series)|date=17 September 1921|volume=54|issue=8|pages=1987–2006|doi=10.1002/cber.19210540828}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common synthetic method for butatriene synthesis is based on [[reductive coupling]] of a [[geminal]] [[dihalo]][[vinylidene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leroyer|first1=Léo|last2=Maraval|first2=Valérie|last3=Chauvin|first3=Remi|title=Synthesis of the Butatriene C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; Function: Methodology and Applications|journal=Chemical Reviews|volume=112|issue=3|year=2012|pages=1310–1343|issn=0009-2665|doi=10.1021/cr200239h}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tetraphenylbutatriene was reported synthesized in 1977 by homocoupling of 2,2-diphenyl-1,1,1-tribromoethane with elemental [[copper]] in [[dimethylformamide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kunieda|first1=Takehisa|last2=Takizawa|first2=Takeo|title=Convenient preparation of tetraarylbutatrienes|journal=Chemical &amp; Pharmaceutical Bulletin|date=1977|volume=25|issue=7|pages=1809–1810|doi=10.1248/cpb.25.1809}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
[[File:Isomerism Cumulenes V.1.png|thumb|''Cis''–''trans'' isomerism of a triene vs axial chirality of an allene]]
The rigidity of cumulenes arises from the fact that the internal carbon atoms carry two double bonds. Their sp hybridisation results in two [[pi bond|π bonds]], one to each neighbor, which are perpendicular to each other. This bonding reinforces a [[Linear molecular geometry|linear geometry]] of the carbon chain.

Cumulenes with non-equivalent substituents on each end exhibit [[isomerism]]. If the number of consecutive double bonds is odd, there is [[cis–trans isomerism|''cis''–''trans'' isomerism]] as for alkenes. If the number of consecutive double bonds is even, there is [[axial chirality]] as for allenes.

==Reactivity==
{{uncited section|date=June 2017}}
The reactions of cumulene are those of simple isolated double bonds because the consecutive double bonds are not [[Conjugated system|conjugated]] to each other.

==Transition metal cumulenes==
The first reported [[Coordination complex|complex]] containing a vinylidene ligand was (Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO)&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, derived from the reaction of [[diphenylketene]] and [[Iron pentacarbonyl|Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]]  Structurally, this molecule resembles [[Diiron nonacarbonyl|Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO)&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;]], wherein one ''μ''-CO ligand is replaced by 1,1-diphenylvinylidene, Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  The first monometallic vinylidene complex was ([[cyclopentadienyl|C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]])Mo([[triphenylphosphine|P(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]])(CO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[C=C(CN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]Cl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=R.

'''Customer support''' is a range of [[customer service]]s to assist customers in making cost effective and correct use of a product. It includes assistance in planning, installation, training, troubleshooting, maintenance, upgrading, and disposal of a product.&lt;ref name="businessdirectory-definition"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/customer-support.html|title=What is customer support? definition and meaning|work=BusinessDictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding technology products such as mobile phones, televisions, computers, software products or other electronic or mechanical goods, it is termed [[technical support]].&lt;ref name="businessdirectory-definition"/&gt;

Customer support is considered as one of the main data channels for [[customer satisfaction research]] and a way to increase [[customer retention]].

==Automation==&lt;!--[[Support automation]] redirects here--&gt;
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}

[[Automation]] of service organizations aim to achieve, for example, lower [[mean time to repair]] (MTTR).

Customer support automation involves the building of a [[knowledge base]] of known [[issue (computers)|issue]]s and their resolution to support [[incident management|incident]]s with delivery mechanisms, often by [[expert system]]s. A service automation platform includes a suite of support solutions including proactive support, assisted support and self-support. 

With automated support, service organizations can make their services available to their customers [[24/7|24 hours a day and 7 days a week]], by monitoring [[alarm]]s, identifying problems at an early stage and resolving issues before they become problems. Automated assisted support enables remote access to sites that need instant problem solving. By automating the collection of information of devices and applications coexisting with the supported application, problems can be quickly detected and fixed. 

Automated self-support, automates the self-support process, freeing users from self-help diagnostics and troubleshooting from [[digital library|on-line libraries]] or knowledge bases.
Support automation solutions can be integrated with [[customer relationship management]] (CRM) systems and [[network management system]]s (NMS), and provide full customer reports to management tallying problems and incidents that were solved mechanically ensuring compliance to industry regulations like [[Sarbanes Oxley]], [[Title 21 CFR Part 11|21 CFR part 11]], and [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|HIPAA]].

===Types===
*'''Proactive Support Automation''' refers to support automation solutions that minimize downtime and enable 24x7 [[availability]]. This is achieved by constant health check tracking with diagnostic procedures to enable issue monitoring and problem solving.
*'''Preemptive Support Automation''' refers to a support solution that utilizes information that is either generated or culled from an application or service, e.g. log files, database queries, configuration changes, etc. This information can then be exploited to predict service degradations or interruptions. The upshot of this is a higher level of service/application availability for the underlying application
*'''Self Support Automation''' is the term organizations give to their support structures that provide on-line libraries and tools for self-help and easy troubleshooting solutions to automatically and precisely diagnose and resolve problems and incidents.
*'''Assisted Support Automation''' is the software that enables support personnel to remotely access their customers desktop or server for diagnostics and trouble ticket resolution.

==Communication Channels==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
Channels of communication that companies may offer to customers for support:

; Phone support
: Customers speak directly to customer support representatives over the phone. For inbound calls, an IVR (Integrated Voice Response) can be programmed to route captured calls in a variety of ways with the potential goal of quickest resolution of a customer’s request/problem.
: Phone Support is often used for order taking, pre-sales queries, upselling and [[cross-selling]], troubleshooting etc.
: Outbound calls are calls made to customers from the [[call center]] to give or take information. 
; Live chat support
: With live chat support a web visitor seeks assistance, a text chat session is started by clicking on a link on the provider's website. The customer support representative interacts with the web visitor, understands the requirements, resolves the query and closes the interaction. Alternatively, based on the requirements the customer support representative could also trigger a chat session with the web visitor. Live chat support assists with language barriers as both parties involved in the chat session may be able to use an online translation service to communicate. It is also considered less intrusive than phone support.{{POV-statement|date=December 2014}}  Live chat support is often used for lead generation and fulfillment, campaign management, pre-sales and post-sales enquiries, complaint registration, tech support etc.
; Email support
: Email is the primary means to offer web-based assistance for your customers when matters do not require an immediate answer. Low-cost, non-intrusive and anywhere-anytime access are some of the advantages of email-based communications. Trouble Ticketing System and CRM Applications help keep track of a series of follow-up correspondence with a particular customer. Services offered via email response management is claims processing, polling/media analysis, subscription services, troubleshooting, complaint registrations etc.
; Remote support
: Solving problems of a computer at a particular location from a computer at another location is remote support. Companies can save considerable amounts of money on logistics through remote support. IT technicians are empowered with several tools that allow them to gain access to customers’ computers at various parts of the world. They are able to gain access and repair software related problems from remote locations. The need for a technician to visit the customers’ premises is mitigated. With the movement of applications from the desktop to the cloud, newer forms of browser based remote support have developed such as [[Cobrowsing]].
; On-site support
: On-site support is the opposite of remote support. Certain kinds of assistance cannot be rendered remotely, like, hardware related problems. repairing a TV, replacing a spare part, servicing of air conditioners etc. In some occasions, a service provider might choose to take devices or gadgets back to their warehouse for repair.
; Social media
: Since the arrival of social media platforms like [[Facebook]] &amp; [[Twitter]], service providers have found that many of their customers spend plenty of time on them daily. To make it convenient to customers, many service providers have set up a [[webcare]] team as support channel on their social media profiles. Customers are able to ask questions, register complaints, clarify doubts etc. by interacting with the company’s staff through these social media platforms. With millions of users now gaining access to social media, this platform has become as prominent as traditional media like phone, live chat and email.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4725">'''Dalibor Davidović''' (born 3 January 1972 in [[Našice]]) is a [[musicologist]] and [[university]] [[professor]]. 

Davidović studied [[musicology]] at the [[Zagreb Music Academy]] (B.A. and M.A.) and obtained his PhD from the [[University of Hamburg]].

His principal areas of research are [[systematic musicology]] and [[aesthetics of music]]. He published extensively on the epistemological problems of the music studies. In his book ''Identity and Music: Between Criticism and Technique'' he explores the contemporary music scholarship concerned with [[identity politics]]. His recent research has been focused on the aesthetic problem of [[listening]], on the notion of [[anarchy]] in the work of [[John Cage]] and on the music ontology of Jewish philosopher [[Ivan Focht]]. He is currently researching the work of German film director [[Hans-Jürgen Syberberg]].

He teaches at the Department of Musicology at the Music Academy in Zagreb. From 2016 to 2018 visiting researcher at [[Berlin University of the Arts]]. He translated into Croatian books on [[aesthetics]] and on [[philosophy of religion]].

A '''desmotubule''' is an endomembrane derived structure of the [[plasmodesmata]] that connects the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] of two adjacent plant cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4528765/ |title=Putting the Squeeze on Plasmodesmata: A Role for Reticulons in Primary Plasmodesmata Formation |website=ncbi.nlm.nih.gov |publisher=[[National Center for Biotechnology Information]], [[U.S. National Library of Medicine]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/cells/plants/plasmodesmata.html |title=Plasmodesmata |website=micro.magnet.fsu.edu |publisher=[[National High Magnetic Field Laboratory]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The desmotubule is not actually a tubule, but a compact, cylindrical segment of ER that is found within the larger tubule structure of the plasmodesmata pore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Epel|first=Bernard L.|date=1994|title=Plasmodesmata: composition, structure and trafficking|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/bf00016479|journal=Plant Molecular Biology|volume=26|issue=5|pages=1343–1356|doi=10.1007/bf00016479|issn=0167-4412|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some, but not all, transport of the plasmodesmata occurs through the desmotubule.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=ROBERTS|first=A.

==Structure==
The desmotubule is a rod-like structure with a diameter of approximately 15 nm, making it one of the mostly highly compressed biological membrane structures known.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=OPARKA|first=K.

These proteins, connect the membrane of the desmotubule to the plasma membrane. Other proteins, consisting of mostly [[actin]] and [[myosin]], form a helical structure which allows the transport of molecules through the cytoplasmic sleeve.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Overall|first=Robyn L.|last2=Blackman|first2=Leila M.|date=1996|title=A model of the macromolecular structure of plasmodesmata|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s1360-1385(96)88177-0|journal=Trends in Plant Science|volume=1|issue=9|pages=307–311|doi=10.1016/s1360-1385(96)88177-0|issn=1360-1385|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
The desmotubule is involved in the lateral transfer of lipid molecules from one cell’s ER to another. These lipids are used in cell signaling pathways as a form of intracellular communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grabski|first=Sharon|last2=de Feijter|first2=Adriaan W.|last3=Schindler|first3=Melvin|date=1993|title=Endoplasmic Reticulum Forms a Dynamic Continuum for Lipid Diffusion between Contiguous Soybean Root Cells|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3869425|journal=The Plant Cell|volume=5|issue=1|pages=25|doi=10.2307/3869425|issn=1040-4651|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three ways in which the desmotubule can facilitate the transfer of molecules: allowing them to flow through its internal lumen, letting them diffuse along its membrane, or attaching molecules on its cytoplasmic side and actively transporting them through the cytoplasmic sleeve of the plasmodesmata.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Actin and myosin molecules attach at the cytoplasmic end of the desmotubule and can provide contractile force that closes its opening and regulates the movement of molecules through the pore. In addition, the proteins of the desmotubule help to provide structural support to the plasmodesmata.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Overall|first=Robyn L.|last2=Blackman|first2=Leila M.|date=1996|title=A model of the macromolecular structure of plasmodesmata|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s1360-1385(96)88177-0|journal=Trends in Plant Science|volume=1|issue=9|pages=307–311|doi=10.1016/s1360-1385(96)88177-0|issn=1360-1385|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Eggdrop1.JPG|thumb|right|300px|A package designed to protect three [[eggs (food)|eggs]] from a fall of ten meters is dropped by a [[physics]] teacher on a lift.]]
The '''egg drop contest''' is an experiment usually performed by [[college]] or primary [[school]] students. Competitors typically attempt to create a device that can keep a raw [[chicken]] [[egg (food)|egg]] intact when dropped from a height. Students are asked to build a device made from a limited or not limited amount of materials to support an egg when dropped from various heights.

==Naked egg drop==
A variation of the egg drop competition is the naked egg drop, in which an exposed raw egg is dropped into a container below that must catch the egg and keep it from breaking. 

==Egg hurl==
Another common variation on the egg drop competition is the egg hurl competition, where the containers are hurled by a device such as a [[trebuchet]] or [[Pneumatic weapon|air cannon]].  This variation is often used by schools that lack tall structures from which to drop the containers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://staff.hartdistrict.org/glyle/projects/egg_hurl_project/index.htm Canyon High School Egg Hurl Competition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518070740/http://staff.hartdistrict.org/glyle/projects/egg_hurl_project/index.htm |date=18 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/lincolnshire/content/articles/2009/06/15/egg_throwing09_feature.shtml "The Rowntree's Randoms Egg Throwing Championships - Swaton 28 June"] ''[[BBC]]''-[[Lincolnshire]], June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  The egg hurl variation adds additional difficulties to the design of the container, since it is initially hurled at high speed and has to cope with horizontal as well as vertical velocities upon landing.

==Regional competitions==
Often schools work together to make larger competitions that pit more students against each other.  One of the larger regional egg drop competitions is the Winston-Salem / Forsyth County Egg Drop Competition that takes place during Engineers Week (late February) each year. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsfceggdrop.com Forsyth County Egg Drop Competition]&lt;/ref&gt;

Egg drop is one of 18 events in the [http://www.sciencenc.com/ North Carolina Science Olympiad] elementary competition. More than 100 teams compete in this annual competition. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencenc.com/event-help/EggDrop.php North Carolina Science Olympiad Egg Drop ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporate information==

===Name===
[[Image:Eldon Headquarters.jpg|thumb|240 px|right|The [[Industrial park]], home of Eldon – Madrid, Spain]]

Eldon literally means “devices for electricity” in Swedish,[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/el#Swedish][https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/don#Swedish] a representative name for a company manufacturing enclosures designed to protect highly sensitive electrical and electronic components.

===History===

Founded in 1922 in Nässjö, Sweden, the original company, was called Elekto Ljus &amp; Kraft, name that was changed to AB Eldon-Verken in 1948.  
 
Initially building electrical installation equipment and selling radios, the latest invention at the time, they soon began manufacturing a [[junction box]] designed for the use with electric ovens.  
  
In 1963 the first acquisition was made with the take-over of their biggest competitor, Elektriska Osterman AB.  Four years later the Eldon-Osterman companies have merged under the common name of Eldon AB.
 
In 1967 the company expanded abroad, by opening sales offices in several European Countries, starting with the [[UK]] and Belgium.
 
The Dutch subsidiary was inaugurated in 1970 in the north of the Netherlands, in [[Drachten]].
 
In 1999 Eldon AB was sold to [[EQT Partners]] and in 2006 the new management team acquired the majority shareholding from EQT.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4103">'''Emergent Design''' is a [[phrase]] coined by [[David Cavallo]] to describe a theoretical [[Conceptual framework|framework]] for the implementation of systemic change in education and learning environments.  This examines how choice of design [[methodology]] contributes to the success or failure of [[education reforms]] through studies in [[Thailand]]. It is related to the theories of [[situated learning]] and of [[constructionist learning]]. The term constructionism was coined by [[Seymour Papert]] under whom Cavallo studied. Emergent Design holds that education systems cannot adapt effectively to technology change unless the education is rooted in the existing skills and needs of the local culture.

== Applications ==
The most notable non-theoretical application of the principles of emergent design is in the [[OLPC XO|OLPC]], whose concept work is supported in Cavallo's paper "Models of growth &amp;mdash; towards fundamental change in learning environment".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.media.mit.edu/publications/bttj/Paper11Pages96-112.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Emergent design in agile software development ==
Emergent design is a consistent topic in [[agile software development]], as a result of the methodology's focus on delivering small pieces of working code with business value. With emergent design, a development organization starts delivering functionality and lets the design emerge. Development will take a piece of functionality A and implement it using best practices and proper test coverage and then move on to delivering functionality B. Once B is built, or while it is being built, the organization will look at what A and B have in common and refactor out the commonality, allowing the design to emerge. This process continues as the organization continually delivers functionality. At the end of an agile release cycle, development is left with the smallest set of the design needed, as opposed to the design that could have been anticipated in advance. The end result is a simpler design with a smaller code base, which is more easily understood and maintained and naturally has less room for defects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agilesherpa.org/agile_coach/engineering_practices/emergent_design Emergent design discussion at agileSherpa]&lt;/ref&gt;. Practices like Change Vector Tracking has helped teams adopting Emergent design as their design philosophy more systematic, disciplined and pragmatic.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite paper

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Emergent Design for social change ==
Emergent Design is also being used in social change movements, such as a group of Canadian NGOs that are bringing together a group of civic leaders to discuss how their work scales up and scales deep. A series of events are being organized by the Carold Institute and [[Ashoka: Innovators for the Public|Ashoka Canada]] in 2013 through to 2015. The project goals currently include, but are not limited to:
* Engage emerging leaders in redefining models and systems that will support a vibrant and dynamic civil society in Canada.
* Strengthen and broaden the impact of their leadership
* Discover and disseminate new knowledge related to systems change and emerging systems
* Share key learning, insights, innovative strategies and new models of engagement among participants and with key stakeholders and sponsoring organizations

[[File:Logo_UFZ.png|right|frameless|275px]]
The work of the '''Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research – UFZ''' (prior to 28 November 2006  UFZ-Umweltforschungszentrum Leipzig-Halle GmbH) covers both basic research and applied research.

The UFZ was established on 12 December 1991. The Centre commenced its research activities on 2 January 1992. The UFZ has locations in [[Leipzig]], [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] and [[Magdeburg]]. In addition, it operates experimental stations in Bad Lauchstädt and Falkenberg. The UFZ employs a total of 1,050 employees (as of 31 December 2016).

The UFZ has been operating KUBUS, a modern communications and event venue in Leipzig, since 2004. KUBUS has flexible event spaces in a range of sizes and accommodates up to 550 people.

== Research areas ==

As an international competence centre for environmental sciences, the UFZ investigates interrelationships between humans and nature under the influence of global change. The research activities of UFZ scientists focus on the terrestrial environment – on densely populated urban and industrial conurbations, on agricultural landscapes and near-natural landscapes. They examine issues relating to future land use, the preservation of biological diversity and of ecosystem services, the sustainable management of soil and water resources and the effect of chemicals on humans and the environment – from the level of single cells and organisms up to the scale of regions.

The work of the UFZ is characterised by integrated environmental research that overcomes disciplinary boundaries between the natural and social sciences (interdisciplinarity) and brings together decision-makers from business, government and society (transdisciplinarity). Major scientific infrastructures such as climate and land-use experiments (e.g., [https://www.ufz.de/index.php?en=40038 GCEF Global Change Experimental Facility], [http://www.ufz.de/index.php?en=38050 ProVis Centre for the visualisation of biochemical processes at cellular level]), platforms and technologies for environmental monitoring (e.g. [http://www.tereno.net/overview-en?set_language=en TERENO terrestrial environmental observatories]), modelling and visualisation (e.g., [https://www.ufz.de/index.php?en=37716 TESSIN/VisLab Terrestrial Environmental System Simulation &amp; Integration Network]) have been or are being initiated, developed and used as part of cooperation arrangements and networks at national and international level.

The goal of UFZ research is to identify ways in which fundamental natural resources can be used sustainably for the well-being of humans and the environment.

== Research organisation ==
[[File:Research structure ufz.jpg|thumb|500px|Research organisation of the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research]]

The integrated environmental research carried out by the UFZ is organised into six topic areas. Topic areas 1–4 address core topics; topic areas 5 and 6 comprise cross-sectional competences:

These topic areas have been developed by the UFZ in response to challenges facing society in times of global change: climate change, land-use change, population growth, societies working under conditions of scarcity, globalisation, urbanisation, decline in biodiversity, rising energy and food demands, rising quantity and variety of chemicals impacting people and the environment, new patterns in national and global governance.

A total of 36 method-oriented departments are assigned to the six strategic topic areas. The large number of departments shows the wide subject range and diversity of research at the UFZ:

== Member, cooperation arrangements, networks, certifications ==

The UFZ is a member of the [https://www.helmholtz.de Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres]. Eighteen natural/engineering sciences and medical/biological research centres with over 38,000 employees and an annual budget of over four billion euros came together to create the association. The UFZ carries out research in three of the total of six areas of Helmholtz Association research: (1) Earth and Environment (85 % of UFZ resources), (2) Energy (8 %) and (3) Health (7 %).

The UFZ cooperates and works with a large number of government agencies, research facilities and organisations at a national and international level (including UNEP, EU, [http://www.ipcc.ch/ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)], [https://www.ipbes.net/ Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES)], the [https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/en Federal Environment Agency (UBA)], the [http://www.bfr.bund.de/en/home.html Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR)], and the [https://www.bfn.de/en.html Federal Environment Agency (BfN)]).

UFZ is a member of [http://www.peer.eu/ PEER (Partnership for European Environmental Research)]. PEER is a network of eight European environmental research centres, and was established in 2001. Over 5,000 people are employed in PEER centres. The total budget of all eight centres is around €430 million per year. By carrying out joint research projects and fostering cooperation between European and international researchers, PEER aims to contribute to the strengthening of environmental research and its role at the European level.

The UFZ, together with the universities of Leipzig, Halle-Wittenberg and Jena and other research facilities, is a cooperation partner of the [https://www.idiv.de/ German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv)], which was established in 2012. iDiv is based in Leipzig and is funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation).

The UFZ has been accredited under EMAS (Eco-Management and Audit System) since 2005. It has been certified under the “berufundfamilie” (job and family) audit since 2014.

== Funding ==
The basic funding for the UFZ is provided by the Federal Republic of Germany (90%) and the Federal States of Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt (5% each) to a total of €64.9 million. The total budget including third-party funds and other income is €89.6 million (as of Dec. 2016).

== Publications ==
The UFZ publishes a series of brochures, research papers and other publications. An annual report on the work of the Centre is published each year. An overview of publications can be found on the [http://www.ufz.de UFZ website].

The '''law school of Beirut''' (also known as the '''law school of Berytus''' and the '''school of Roman law at Berytus''') was a center for the study of [[Roman law]] in [[classical antiquity]] located in [[Beirut]] ({{Lang-la|Berytus}}). It flourished under the patronage of the [[Roman emperor]]s and functioned as the [[Roman Empire]]'s preeminent center of [[jurisprudence]] until its destruction in AD 551.

The law schools of the Roman Empire established organized repositories of imperial [[Constitution (Roman law)|constitutions]] and institutionalized the study and practice of jurisprudence to relieve the busy imperial courts. The archiving of imperial constitutions facilitated the task of [[jurist]]s in referring to legal [[precedent]]s. The origins of the law school of Beirut are obscure, but probably it was under [[Augustus]] in the first century. The earliest written mention of the school dates to 239 AD, when its reputation had already been established. The school attracted young, affluent Roman citizens, and its professors made major contributions to the [[Corpus Juris Civilis|Codex of Justinian]]. The school achieved such wide recognition throughout the Empire that Beirut was known as the "Mother of Laws". Beirut was one of the few schools allowed to continue teaching jurisprudence when [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine emperor]] [[Justinian I]] shut down other provincial law schools.

The course of study at Beirut lasted for five years and consisted in the revision and analysis of classical legal texts and imperial constitutions, in addition to case discussions. Justinian took a personal interest in the teaching process, charging the bishop of Beirut, the governor of [[Phoenicia|Phoenicia Maritima]] and the teachers with discipline maintenance in the school.

The school's facilities were destroyed in the aftermath of a [[551 Beirut earthquake|massive earthquake]] that hit the Phoenician coastline. It was moved to [[Sidon]] but did not survive the [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|Arab conquest]] of 635 AD. Ancient texts attest that the school was next to the ancient Anastasis church, vestiges of which lie beneath the [[Saint George Greek Orthodox Cathedral]] in [[Beirut Central District|Beirut's historic center]].

==Background==
As the guarantor of justice, the [[Roman emperor]] was expected to devote substantial amounts of time to judicial matters. He was the [[Executive magistrates of the Roman Empire|chief magistrate]] whose major prerogative (''[[Ius|jus]]'') was the ordering of all public affairs, for which he could demand assistance from anyone at any time.&lt;ref name="Walker 2000 91"&gt;Walker 2000, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

With legal appeals, petitions from subjects and judicial queries of magistrates and [[Roman governor|governors]], the emperors were careful to consult with the [[jurist]]s (''iuris consulti''), who were usually secretaries drafted from the [[Roman equestrian order|equestrian order]]. From the reign of [[Augustus]] (27&amp;nbsp;BC–AD&amp;nbsp;14), jurists began compiling organized repositories of imperial [[edict]]s (''constitutiones''), and legal scholarship became an imperially sponsored function of administration. Every new judicial decision was founded on archived legal precedents and earlier deliberations. The edict repositories and the imperially sponsored legal scholarship gave rise to the earliest law school system of the [[Western world]], aimed specifically at training professional jurists.&lt;ref name="Walker 2000 91"/&gt;

==History==
During the reign of Augustus, [[Beirut]] was established under the name ''Colonia Iulia Augusta Felix Berytus''&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Named after Augustus' daughter [[Julia the Elder]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charnock 1859, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; (and granted the status of ''[[Ius Italicum]]'') as a [[Colonia (Roman)|colony]] for [[Battle of Actium]] veterans from the [[Legio V Macedonica|fifth Macedonian]] and the [[Legio III Gallica|third Gallic]] legions. It was chosen as a regional center instead of the more prominent Phoenician cities of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] and [[Sidon]], which had a history of belligerence against Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Jones Hall 2004, pp. 46–47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="arc"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://archive.archaeology.org/1107/features/beirut_lebanon_urban_archaeology.html | title=Rebuilding Beirut |author=Lawler, Andrew | journal=Archaeology |date=July–August 2011 | volume=64 | issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:St. George's Cathedral, Beirut.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A large church at the edge of an archaeological field.|St. George's Cathedral sits on the axis of Beirut's ancient [[Cardo|Cardo Maximus]]. The law school used to be located next to the Byzantine Anastasis church, a precursor of the cathedral.]]
Beirut was first mentioned in writing as a major center for the study of law in the 239 works of [[Gregory Thaumaturgus]], the bishop of [[Niksar|Neo-Caesarea]].&lt;ref&gt;Sartre 2005, p. 289&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thaumaturgus 239, pp. 45–46&lt;/ref&gt; Other early written sources do not mention when the law school was established, and the date is much debated among modern historians and scholars. [[Edward Gibbon]] suggested its founding may have been directed by locally born Emperor [[Alexander Severus]], who reigned during AD 222–235;&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon 1854, p. 294&lt;/ref&gt; this hypothesis had been supported by [[Gilles Ménage]], a late 17th-century French scholar. Italian jurist [[Scipione Gentili]], however, attributed the school's foundation to Augustus, while 19th-century German theologian [[Karl Hase]] advocated its establishment shortly after the victory at Actium (31&amp;nbsp;BC).&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 16–20&lt;/ref&gt; Adolf Friedrich Rudorff dated it to the reign of [[Hadrian]],&lt;ref&gt;Rudorff  1857, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; while Franz Peter Bremer suggested that it opened around 200, based on Thaumaturgus.&lt;ref&gt;Bremer 1868, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Theodor Mommsen]] linked the establishment of the law school in Beirut with the need for jurists, since the city was chosen to serve as a repository for Roman imperial edicts concerning the eastern provinces. After arriving in Beirut, these were translated into [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], [[publishing|published]] and archived. This function was first recorded in 196 AD, the date of the earliest constitutions contained in the [[Codex Gregorianus|Gregorian Codex]], but the city is thought to have served as a repository since earlier times.&lt;ref&gt;Mommsen 1901, pp. 139–144&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 52"&gt;Kassir 2010, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; The proximity of the repository to the law school allowed the Beiruti jurists to consult archived documents and for students to learn of the most recent imperial decrees—an advantage that the law schools of [[Caesarea Maritima]] and [[Alexandria]] lacked.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

The 3rd-century emperors [[Diocletian]] and [[Maximian]] issued constitutions exempting the students of the law school of Beirut from compulsory service in their hometowns.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 29–30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jidejian 1973, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; In the 4th century, the Greek [[rhetoric]]ian [[Libanius]] reported that the school attracted young students from affluent families and deplored the school's instructional use of [[Latin]], which was gradually abandoned in favor of Greek in the course of the century.&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925, p. 39"&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark 2011, p. 36"&gt;Clark 2011, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rochette 1997 pp. 168, 174"&gt;Rochette 1997 pp. 168, 174&lt;/ref&gt;
By the 5th century, Beirut had established its leading position and repute among the Empire's law schools; its teachers were highly regarded and played a chief role in the development of legal learning in the East to the point that they were dubbed “ecumenical masters”.&lt;ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p. 453"&gt;Jolowicz 1972, p. 453&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pomeroy 2012, pp. 41–42&lt;/ref&gt; From 425, the law school of [[Constantinople]] became a rival center of law study and was the only school, along with Beirut's, to be maintained after [[Justinian I]] closed those of Alexandria, Caesarea Maritima and [[Athens]] in 529&lt;ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p. 453"/&gt; because their teachings contradicted with Christian faith.&lt;ref&gt;Riddle 2008, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 9, 551, the Phoenician coastal cities were devastated by a high-magnitude earthquake. In Beirut the earthquake was followed by a [[tsunami]] and a fire that obliterated the city. In the aftermath, 30,000 people lost their lives, including many students from abroad. Justinian allocated funds to rebuild Beirut, and the law school was temporarily moved to the southern Phoenician city of [[Sidon]], pending reconstruction; the best teachers, however, moved to Constantinople. Misfortune hit Beirut again in 560 AD when a massive fire ravaged the recovering city. The law school was not reopened, and all prospect for its return was abandoned with the [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|Arab conquest]] in 635 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 54–58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sartre 2005, p. 291"&gt;Sartre 2005, p. 291&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academia==
The study course at the law school of Beirut was restricted to [[Roman law]]; it did not cover the local laws of the province of Phoenicia.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient texts provide an idea of the curriculum, the teaching method, the course languages and its duration.

===Preparatory studies===
Potential students were expected to have undergone grammar, rhetoric and encyclopedic sciences studies. Another prerequisite was the mastery of Greek and Latin, given that the classical legal references and imperial constitutions used in the teaching program were written in Latin. The aspirants could pursue their preparatory studies in public schools or have private tutors.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 81–83&lt;/ref&gt;

===Curriculum===

Little is known about the Beirut law school's curriculum before the 5th century. The ''[[Scholia Sinaitica]]'' and the ''[[Scholia]]'' to the ''[[Basilika|Basilica]]'' provide glimpses of the school's [[teaching method]], comparable to the method of rhetoric schools at the time. The lecturer would discuss and analyze legal texts by adding his own comments, which included references to analogous passages from imperial constitutions or from the works of prominent classical Roman jurists, such as [[Ulpian]]. He would then formulate the general legal principles and use these to resolve legal problems inspired from actual, practical cases. This method differed from the scheme of classical times in which the student had to master the law basics before engaging in case studies.&lt;ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p. 454"&gt;Jolowicz 1972, p. 454&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mousourakis 2003, p. 363"&gt;Mousourakis 2003, p. 363&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 245&lt;/ref&gt;

Jurisprudence was taught in Latin, even in the law schools of the East, but toward the end of the fourth and the beginning of the 5th century, Latin was supplanted by Greek at Beirut,&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925, p. 39"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p. 454"/&gt; which was the long-established [[lingua franca]] of the eastern territories of the Roman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Horrocks 2009, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; A similar shift probably occurred at the school of Constantinople at about the same time.&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925, p. 39"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p. 454"/&gt;

The ''Omnem'' constitution at the beginning of the [[Digest (Roman law)|Digest]] is the only source of information about the existing study system in the 5th century until the Justinian reforms of 533. The old program was a four-year course to be completed before the age of 25. The courses were based on the works of [[Gaius (jurist)|Gaius]], Ulpian, [[Aemilius Papinianus|Papinian]] and [[Julius Paulus Prudentissimus|Paulus]]. Students attended lectures for three years and spent the fourth year in private study of Paulus' ''[[Responsa]]''; they had the option to stay for a fifth year to study imperial constitutions. The students of each year were distinguished by special nicknames: first year, ''Dupondii''; second, ''Edictales''; third, ''Papinianistae''; fourth, ''Lytae''.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 224–240&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sheppard 1999, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt;

Justinian's ''Omnem'' constitution fixed the duration of the legal course in the schools of Beirut and Constantinople at five years.&lt;ref name="Corcoran"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/history2/volterra/julianintro.htm | title=Law-school texts after 533 | publisher=University College London | work=The Epitome of Julian | date=July 20, 2009 | accessdate=March 23, 2013 | author=Corcoran, Simon | authorlink=Simon Corcoran | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106095259/http://www.ucl.ac.uk/history2/volterra/julianintro.htm | archivedate=November 6, 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="digest"&gt;Monro 1872, pp. xviii–xxiv&lt;/ref&gt; The courses consisted of lectures and self-study using materials advanced in his ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]'', namely the ''[[Institutes of Justinian|Institutiones]]'' (Institutes), ''[[Digest (Roman law)|Digesta]]'' (Digest) and ''[[Codex Justinianus|Codex]]'' (Code).&lt;ref name="Corcoran"/&gt;&lt;ref name="digest"/&gt; First-year students were lectured on the Institutes and on the first part of the Digest;&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Books 1–4 of the Digest are called the ''Prota''.&lt;/ref&gt; second-year students were taught the greater part of the Digest,&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;The ''de iudiciis'' (books 5–11), the ''de rebus'' (books 12–19) and  the ''libri singularis'' (books 23, 26, 28 and 30).&lt;/ref&gt; and third-year students had to learn various texts from Papinian and the ''leges singulares''.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Books 20–22.&lt;/ref&gt; There were no lectures during the course's fourth year but the pupils studied the remainder of the Digest.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Books 24, 25, 27, 29 and 31–36.&lt;/ref&gt; Nicknames were still given according to the year of study, but Justinian changed the name of first-year students from the frivolous ''Dupondii'' (which means "two pennies") to ''Iustiniani novi'' and dubbed fifth-year students ''Prolytae''.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buckland 1921, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;
At the end of the course, graduands were given certificates allowing them to work as court advocates or in the imperial civil service.&lt;ref name="Mousourakis 2003, p. 363"/&gt;

===Professorial body===
Ancient texts reveal the names and deeds of some of the most notable law professors at the Beirut school. The scarce sources include historical accounts, works of legal scholarship, anthologies, ancient correspondences and funerary inscriptions.

[[Antioch]]-based rhetoric teacher Libanius wrote many letters of correspondence to Domninus the Elder, a 4th-century law school professor. In 360, Libanius invited Domninus to leave Beirut and teach with him at the rhetoric school of Antioch. Domninus apparently declined the offer, since later correspondence to him from Libanius, between 361 and 364, served as recommendations for law school candidates.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

The most brilliant era of Beirut's law school, spanning the century between 400 and 500, was known as the era of the "Ecumenical Masters" (Greek: τῆς οἰκουμένης διδάσκαλοι). During this period, a succession of seven highly esteemed law masters was largely responsible for the revival of legal education in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p. 453"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925 131"&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; The seven revered masters, cited with praise by 6th-century scholars, were [[Cyrillus]], [[Patricius (jurist)|Patricius]], [[Domninus (jurist)|Domninus]], [[Demosthenes (jurist)|Demosthenes]], [[Eudoxius (jurist)|Eudoxius]], [[Leontius (jurist)|Leontius]] and [[Amblichus]].&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925 131"/&gt;

Cyrillus was the founder of the ecumenical school of jurists.&lt;ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 52"/&gt; He is believed to have taught as of {{circa|lk=no|400}} or {{circa|lk=no|410}}. Styled "the great" due to his reputation as a teacher, he was known for his direct use of ancient sources of law and for interpreting jurists such as Ulpian and Papinian. Cyrillus wrote a precise treatise on definitions that supplied the materials for many important ''scholia'' appended to the first and second titles of the eleventh book of the ''Basilica''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Cyrillus |volume=7 |page=706}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 131–132&lt;/ref&gt;
Patricius was praised in the third preface of the Justinian Digest (''Tanta-Dedoken'') as a distinguished professor of the Beirut law school. Archaeological excavations done in Beirut at the turn of the 20th century revealed a funerary monument believed to have belonged to Patricius.&lt;ref&gt;Jalabert 1906, pp. 170–171&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 132–138&lt;/ref&gt; The son of Eudoxius, Leontius was described by ecclesiastical historian [[Zacharias Rhetor]], who was his first-year student in 487 or 488, to have a great reputation in the legal field. He was raised to the office of [[Praetorian prefecture of the East|Praetorian prefect of the East]] under Emperor [[Anastasius I Dicorus|Anastasius I]] between 503 and 504, and became [[Magister militum]] in 528. Leontius was also involved as a commissioner in the preparation of the first codex of Justinian.&lt;ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 52"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 141–154&lt;/ref&gt; His contemporary, Amblichus, wrote a commentary on Ulpian's ''Libri ad Edictum''.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical sources also tell of Euxenius, a teacher at the Beirut law school who taught during the times of the "Ecumenical Masters". Euxenius was the brother of the city's bishop Eustathius and was involved in the 460 religious controversy caused by [[Pope Timothy II of Alexandria|Timothy Aelurus]], which opposed the [[Miaphysitism|Miaphysites]] to the followers of the [[Council of Chalcedon]].&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Dorotheus (jurist)|Dorotheus]], Anatolius (son of Leontius) and Julianus were school professors contemporary to Justinian I. The first two were summoned to the imperial court and commissioned to draft the ''Digesta''. Under the supervision of [[Tribonian]], Dorotheus also collaborated with Theophilus, a Constantinopolitan law teacher, in drafting the ''Institutiones''.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 186–189&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="digest2"&gt;Monro 1872, p. xxix&lt;/ref&gt; Julianus, the last known professor of Beirut's law school, was extolled by Theaetetus as "the light of the law".&lt;ref&gt;Pringsheim 1921, p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; After the earthquake, Julianus left Beirut and settled in Constantinople, where he authored the ''[[Novellae Constitutiones|Epitome Iuliani]]'' in 555.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 190–191&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Justinian, there were eight teachers in the law schools of the [[Byzantine Empire]], presumably four in each of Beirut and Constantinople's schools.&lt;ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p. 454"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; Justinian mandated the supervision and enforcement of discipline in the school of Beirut to the teachers, the city's bishop and the [[Praeses|governor]] of Phoenicia Maritima.&lt;ref name="digest"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notable students===
While most of the law school's students are not remembered by history, ancient historians and sources recount the stories of some of those who were deemed notable and achieved fame.

According to [[Eusebius|Eusebius of Caesarea]], [[Pamphilus of Caesarea]] was born into a rich family in Beirut in the latter half of the 3rd century and attended its law school. Pamphilus later became the [[presbyter]] of Caesarea Maritima and the founder of its extensive Christian library. He is celebrated as a martyr by both the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. Eusebius also tells of martyred brothers [[Aphian]] and [[Aedesius of Alexandria|Aedesius]], born to a noble [[Lycia]]n family. They converted to Christianity while studying law in Beirut and were persecuted and executed for their beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 27–30&lt;/ref&gt;

Fourth-century historian [[Eunapius]] wrote of [[Anatolius]], a high-ranking Roman official known to his enemies as ''Azutrio''. Anatolius occupied the offices of consul of Syria, [[vicarius]] of the [[Diocese of Asia]], [[proconsul]] of Constantinople, [[List of urban prefects of Constantinople|urban prefect of Constantinople]] in 354, and [[Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum|Praetorian prefect of Illyricum]] until his death in 360. In his account of Anatolius, Eunapius summarized: "He reached the summit of the science of law. Nothing about this is surprising because Beirut, his homeland, is the mother and nurse of these studies".&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925, pp. 30–32"&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 30–32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eunapius 1596, pp. 148–151&lt;/ref&gt;
Libanius' correspondence with Gaianus of Tyre discusses the latter's achievements after his graduation from the law school of Beirut; Gaianus became the [[List of Roman governors of Syria#Consularis Governors of Syria Phoenicia (c. 295 to c. 395)|consular governor of Phoenicia]] in 362.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 87–88&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Gaza City|Gazan]] lawyer and church historian [[Sozomen]], also a law student at Beirut, wrote in his ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' about [[Triphyllius]], a convert to Christendom who became the bishop of Nicosia. Triphyllius received legal training in Beirut and was criticized by his teacher [[Saint Spyridon]] for his [[atticism]] and for using legal vocabulary instead of that of the Bible.&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925, pp. 30–32"/&gt;

Zacharias Rhetor studied law at Beirut between 487 and 492, then worked as a lawyer in Constantinople until his imperial contacts won him the appointment as bishop of [[Mytilene]]. Among Rhetor's works is the biography of [[Severus of Antioch|Severus]], the last miaphysite patriarch of Antioch and one of the founders of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], who had also been a law student in Beirut as of 486.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 46–51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Greatrex 2011, pp. 6–7"&gt;Greatrex 2011, pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt; Another late 5th-century student was [[John Rufus]], an anti-[[Chalcedonian Christianity|Chalcedonian]] priest who moved to [[Maiuma]] after the expulsion of his master, [[Peter the Fuller]]. In Maiuma, John Rufus authored the ''Plerophoriae'' and the ''Life of [[Peter the Iberian]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sterk 2009, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925, p. 51"&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
Historically, Roman ''stationes'' or ''auditoria'', where teaching was done, stood next to public libraries housed in temples. This arrangement was copied in the Roman colony at Beirut. The first mention of the school's premises dates to 350,&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; but the description does not specify its location. In the 5th century, Zacharias Rhetor reported that the school stood next to the "Temple of God", the description of which permitted its identification with the Byzantine Anastasis cathedral.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 63–73&lt;/ref&gt;

At the turn of the 20th century, archaeological excavations in the [[souq]] between the Saint George Greek Orthodox Cathedral and [[Saint George Maronite Cathedral, Beirut|Saint George Cathedral of the Maronites]] unearthed a funerary [[stele]] etched with an epitaph to a man named Patricius, "whose career was consecrated for the study of law".&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; The epitaph was identified as being dedicated to the famous 5th-century law school professor.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 61–73&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, archaeological diggings underneath the Saint George Greek Orthodox Cathedral in [[Beirut Central District]]'s Nejmeh Square identified structural elements of the Anastasis cathedral, but they were restricted to an area of {{convert|316|m2|sqft}} and failed to unearth the interred school.&lt;ref name="Sartre 2005, p. 291"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skaf 2005, pp. 224–229&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jones Hall 2004, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reputation and legacy==

The law school of Beirut supplied the Roman Empire, especially its eastern provinces, with lawyers and magistrates for three centuries until the school's destruction. The influx of students was abundant and persistent because of the affluence, honor and secured employment offered by the profession.&lt;ref&gt;Rawlinson 2004, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; A degree in law became highly sought following an edict issued in 460 by Emperor [[Leo I the Thracian|Leo I]]. The edict ordered that candidates for the bar of the Eastern [[praetorian prefect]]ure had to produce certificates of proficiency from the law teachers who instructed them at one of the recognized law schools of the Empire.&lt;ref name="Mousourakis 2003, p. 363"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jolowicz 1972, pp. 454–455&lt;/ref&gt;

The in-depth studies of the classical legal works in Beirut, and later in Constantinople, conferred an unprecedented scientific dimension to jurisprudence; this academic movement gave rise to the minds behind Justinian's legal reforms. As a result of the new understanding of the classical legal texts, the imperial laws of the late 5th and early 6th centuries were clearer and more coherent than those of the early [[Postclassical Era]], according to legal historian George Mousourakis and other scholars.&lt;ref name="Jolowicz 1972, pp. 451–460"&gt;Jolowicz 1972, pp. 451–460&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kunkel"&gt;Kunkel 1973, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schuz"&gt;Schulz 1967, p. 267&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mousourakis 2003, p. 364&lt;/ref&gt;

The school garnered accolades throughout its existence and was bestowed with the title ''Berytus Nutrix Legum'' (Beirut, Mother of Laws) by Eunapius, Libanius, Zacharias Rhetor and finally by Emperor Justinian.&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925, p. 51"/&gt; His 533 ''Omnem'' constitution read:
&lt;blockquote&gt;These three works which we have composed we desire should be put in their hands in royal cities as well as in the most fair city of Berytus, which may well be styled the nursing mother of law, as indeed previous Emperors have commanded, but in no other places which did not enjoy the same privilege in old times, as we have heard that even in the brilliant city of Alexandria, and in Caesarea and others, there have been ignorant men who, instead of doing their duty, conveyed spurious lessons to their pupils, and such as these we desire to make desist from that attempt by laying down the above limits, so that, if they should hereafter be guilty of such conduct and carry on their duties outside the royal cities and the metropolis Berytus, they may be punished by a fine of ten pounds of gold and be expelled from the city in which instead of teaching the law they transgress the law.&lt;ref name="digest"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From the 3rd century, the school tolerated Christian teachings, producing a number of students who would become influential church leaders and bishops, such as [[Pamphilus of Caesarea]], [[Severus of Antioch]] and [[Aphian]]. Under [[Cyrillus]], the first of the Ecumenical Masters, the Christian faith was consolidated as an integral element of the legal training.&lt;ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 53"&gt;Kassir 2010, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Attridge  1992, p. 436&lt;/ref&gt;

Two professors from the law school of Beirut, Dorotheus and Anatolius, had such a repute for their wisdom and knowledge that they were especially praised by Justinian in the opening of his ''Tanta'' constitution. The emperor summoned both professors to assist his minister Tribonian in compiling the Codex of Justinian,&lt;ref name="digest"/&gt; the Empire's body of civil laws issued between 529 and 534. The ''Tanta'' passage reads:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Dorotheus, an illustrious man, of great eloquence and quæstorian rank, whom, when he was engaged in delivering the law to students in the most brilliant city of Berytus,we, moved by his great reputation and renown, summoned to our presence and made to share in the work in question; again, Anatolius, an illustrious person, a magistrate, who, like the last, was invited to this work when acting as an exponent of law at Berytus, a man who came of an ancient stock, as both his father Leontius and his grandfather Eudoxius left behind them an excellent report in respect of legal learning...&lt;ref name="digest2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For centuries following its compilation, the work of Justinian's commission was studied and incorporated into the legal systems of different nations and has profoundly impacted the [[Byzantine law]] and the [[Western law|Western legal tradition]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodman 1995, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Stein asserts that the texts of ancient Roman law have constituted "a kind of legal supermarket, in which lawyers of different periods have found what they needed at the time."&lt;ref&gt;Stein 1999, pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Digesto 02.jpg|thumb|alt=Title page of an old book with ornate decorative motifs depicting a mermaid, a merman and various other creatures surrounding the Title text |Title page of a late 16th-century edition of the ''Digesta'', part of Emperor [[Justinian I]]'s ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]'']]
The ''Corpus Juris Civilis'' remained the basis of Byzantine law until the publication of the ''[[Byzantine law#Ecloga|Ecloga legum]]'' in 741 by Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]] and his son and co-regent [[Constantine V]]. The ''Ecloga'' was a shortened and more philanthropic version of the Codex of Justinian, whose dispositions were more in tune with [[Christian values]]. It was written in Greek, since Latin had fallen into disuse, and its provisions continued to be applied in later centuries in the neighboring Balkan and Asia Minor regions, with surviving translations in [[Slavic languages|Slavic]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]].&lt;ref name="Mousourakis 2003, pp. 403–404"&gt;Mousourakis 2003, pp. 403–404&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stein 1999, p. 35"&gt;Stein 1999, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reinink 2002, pp. 191–192"&gt;Reinink 2002, pp. 191–192&lt;/ref&gt; Emperor [[Basil I]], who ruled in the 9th century, issued the ''Prochiron'' and the ''Epanagoge'', which were legal compilations invalidating parts of the ''Ecloga'' and restoring the Justinian laws.&lt;ref name="Mousourakis 2003, p. 405"&gt;Mousourakis 2003, p. 405&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lokin 1994, pp. 71–91"&gt;Lokin 1994, pp. 71–91&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Prochiron'' served as the basis for the legal writings of the 12th-century first archbishop of Serbia, [[Saint Sava]]. His legal compilation was intended for the [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian church]] but the influential work was adopted as the basic constitution for the Bulgarian and Russian orthodox churches.&lt;ref name="Sedlar 2011, pp. 306–307"&gt;Sedlar 2011, pp. 306–307&lt;/ref&gt; Around 900, Emperor [[Leo VI the Wise|Leo VI]] commissioned the ''Basilica'', a Greek rewriting of the Justinian laws that is considered the ancestor of modern Greece's law until the enactment of the Code of 1940.&lt;ref name="Stein 1999, pp. 35–36"&gt;Stein 1999, pp. 35–36&lt;/ref&gt;

The Codex of Justinian also had a great influence on Western law, particularly on the legal history and tradition of western Europe and its American colonies. In Italy, a single complete copy of the Justinian Digest survived and lay forgotten until its rediscovery in 1070.&lt;ref name="Kuttner 1991, pp. 299–300"&gt;Kuttner 1991, pp. 299–300&lt;/ref&gt; In 1088, [[Irnerius]], a jurist and teacher of the liberal arts in [[Bologna]], was the first to teach the newly recovered Digest and the rest of Justinian's books. He and his successors explained the Roman laws to their students by means of glosses or explanatory notes written on the edges or between the text lines. The Roman legal concepts resulting from the studies of these "[[glossator]]s" spread to the universities and law courts of Europe.&lt;ref name="Evans 2005, p. 25"&gt;Evans 2005, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;  The Roman law revival that started in Italy, during the Middle Ages, was taken up by France, the Netherlands and Germany in later centuries.&lt;ref name="Stein 1999, p. 2"&gt;Stein 1999, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The enactment of the German Civil Code in 1900 put an end to the application of extant forms of law derived from the Justinian codes in most European states.&lt;ref name="Stein 1999, p. 128"&gt;Stein 1999, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

The reputation of Beirut as "mother of laws" reemerged in modern times.&lt;ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 53"/&gt; In 1913, [[Paul Huvelin]], the first dean of the newly established [[Saint Joseph University|Université Saint-Joseph]]'s Faculty of Law, dedicated the inaugural speech to the classical law school of Beirut in an effort to confer legitimacy to the new academy.&lt;ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 53"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 199"&gt;Kassir 2010, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; The epithet ''Berytus Nutrix Legum'' is used as a motto and as part of the emblem of the Beirut Bar Association, founded in 1919.&lt;ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 53"/&gt; It is also featured in the seal and flag of the Municipality of Beirut.&lt;ref name="log"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://beirut.gov.lb/ | title = Beirut Official Website | publisher = Municipality of Beirut | accessdate = June 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MIKE SHE''' is an integrated [[hydrological modelling]] system for building and [[Computer simulation|simulating]] [[surface water]] flow and [[groundwater]] flow.  MIKE SHE can simulate the entire land phase of the [[hydrologic cycle]] and allows components to be used independently and customized to local needs.  MIKE SHE emerged from Système Hydrologique Européen (SHE) as developed and extensively applied since 1977 onwards&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=M.B. |last1=Abbott |first2=J.C. |last2=Bathurst |first3=J.A. |last3=Cunge |first4=P.E. |last4=O'Connell |first5=J. |last5=Rasmussen |title=An introduction to the European Hydrological System — Systeme Hydrologique Europeen, "SHE", 1: History and philosophy of a physically-based, distributed modelling system |volume=87 |number=1–2 |pages=45–59 |year=1986 |journal=Journal of Hydrology  |doi=10.1016/0022-1694(86)90114-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; by a consortium of three European organizations: the Institute of Hydrology ([[the United Kingdom]]), [[Artelia#Sogreah|SOGREAH]] ([[France]]) and [[DHI (company)|DHI]] ([[Denmark]]).  Since then, DHI has continuously invested resources into research and development of MIKE SHE.  MIKE SHE can be used for the analysis, planning and management of a wide range of [[water resources]] and environmental problems related to surface water and groundwater, especially surface-water impact from groundwater withdrawal, conjunctive use of groundwater and surface water, [[wetland]] management and restoration, river basin management and planning, impact studies for changes in [[land use]] and [[climate]].

The program is offered in both [[32-bit]] and [[64-bit]] versions for [[Microsoft Windows]] operating systems.

'''Maritime Archaeology Sea Trust''' (MAST) is a [[charitable trust]] founded in February 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thisismast.org |title=Maritime Archaeology Sea Trust |publisher=Thisismast.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; which focuses on investigations into the maritime heritage of the [[United Kingdom]] and further afield, through [[maritime history|historical]] and [[maritime archaeology|archaeological investigations]]. MAST uses its profits from contract work as well as donations to fund its charitable aims.

Its stated objective is to advance the education of the public in maritime heritage, focusing in particular on maritime archaeological material. By such means as the directors in their discretion shall from time to time think fit including the preservation and investigation of shipwrecked vessels and of historically or otherwise valuable maritime material and the dissemination of the educationally useful results of such investigation to the general public. It does this by conducting archaeological surveys and excavations, conservation of material and publication of results. Clients include [[Historic England]], the Ministry of Defence and the [[National Trust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/salcombe-to-hope-cove/things-to-see-and-do/view-page/item535880/ |title=North and South Sands canoe trail, Salcombe |publisher=National Trust |date= |accessdate=2014-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102193743/http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/salcombe-to-hope-cove/things-to-see-and-do/view-page/item535880/ |archivedate=2 January 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

MAST is also accredited to the Governing Bodies of the 2001 UNESCO Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/underwater-cultural-heritage/partners-society/partners-ngos/accredited-ngos/ |title=Accredited Non-Governmental Organisations |publisher=UNESCO |date= 2015 |accessdate=2016-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a signatory to the Armed Forces Covenant which is committed to honour and to support the Armed Forces community of the United Kingdom&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/499917/Maritime_Archaeology_Sea_Trust_Armed_Forces_Covenant_20160113.pdf |title=The Armed Forces Corporate Covenant |publisher=Ministry of Defence |date= 2016 |accessdate=2016-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projects==

MAST takes a holistic approach to maritime archaeology covering a wide range of methods and environments including geophysics (both on land and sea), excavations, surveys, conservation and desk-based research.

===HMS Invincible 1744===
In July 2016 MAST received a £2 million grant for the rescue excavation, recovery, conservation and public display of material from the wreck of [[HMS Invincible (1747)]] with partners [[Bournemouth University]], [[National Museum of the Royal Navy]], Dan Pascoe of Pascoe Archaeological Services and Serving and ex-Service volunteers and the Community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/libor-fines-to-be-used-to-support-military-charities-and-royal-voluntary-service| title=LIBOR fines to be used to support military charities and Royal Voluntary Service|publisher=HM Treasury|date= 2016-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chancellor [[George Osborne]] said: "The wreck of the HMS Invincible is an invaluable part of the UK's proud maritime history and it is important we work to save as much as possible. This hugely worthwhile project will support military veterans, serving personnel and disadvantaged teenagers to learn new skills and put artefacts from the wreck on public display for the first time".

The site was first found in 1979 by Arthur Mack. John Bingeman subsequently led excavations between 1980-90 (Bingeman 2010). Dan Pascoe of Pascoe Archaeological Services took the reins in 2010, monitoring the increasingly vulnerable site, undertaking extensive survey work and raising artefacts at risk from destruction, work funded by [[Historic England]]. It was this that led Historic England to recognise the site's vulnerability.

[[Chatham Historic Dockyard]] holds a significant collection of HMS Invincible artefacts. Maritime archaeological material from the 18th century is poorly represented as a whole in the UK considering the amount of wrecks of this era off our coasts. The HMS Invincible 1744 Project will vastly increase our knowledge and understanding of this important era in shipbuilding and ship life.&lt;ref&gt;http://thedockyard.co.uk/explore/command-of-the-ocean/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Esmeralda 1503===
Following the discovery of a site consistent with an early 16th-century European wreck off [[Al-Hallaniyah]] in 1998, the Omani government, spearheaded by its Ministry of Heritage and Culture, agreed to initially to a reconnaissance expedition in 2013. [[David Mearns]], director of Blue Water Recoveries, brought together a team of maritime archaeologists from MAST and Bournemouth University, geophysicists and other scientists in 2013 to conduct a reconnaissance survey of the site, 14 years after its initial discovery. The archaeology team, led by Associate Professor Dave Parham of Bournemouth University, was supported by MAST which co-funded the first expedition in 2013. There have two subsequent fieldwork seasons and fieldwork was completed in November 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mearns|first1=David|last2=Parham|first2=Dave|last3=Frolich|first3=Bruno|title=A Portuguese East Indiaman from the 1502–1503 Fleet of Vasco da Gama off Al Hallaniyah Island, Oman: an interim report|journal=International Journal of Nautical Archaeology|date=14 March 2016|volume=46|issue=2|pages=1–21|doi=10.1111/1095-9270.12175|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1095-9270.12175/full|accessdate=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esmeraldashipwreck.com/history/|title=Vasco da Gama shipwreck history following find of Esmeralda Shipwreck off Oman coast|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Royal Navy Loss List===
As part of a team undertaking the 2001 [[UNESCO]] Convention Impact Review for the United Kingdom, MAST completed the [[Royal Navy]] Loss List, a major assessment of the international spread of UK sovereign wrecks.

The RN Loss List, from 1512-1947, is compiled from the volumes and websites listed below from the earliest known RN wreck. The assessment shows that there are over 4,700 Royal Naval wrecks scattered across the oceans of the world, covering the period between 1512 and 1945.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rmg.co.uk/discover/researchers/research-guides/research-guide-b3-royal-navy-sources-enquiries&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/underwater-cultural-heritage/about-the-underwater-cultural-heritage/world-war-i/heritage-for-peace-education-initiative/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coronation Geophysical Survey===
A Geophysical Survey was conducted by MAST and the Cornwall and Isles of Scilly Maritime Archaeological Society (CISMAS) on the [[HMS Coronation (1685)|Coronation Protected Wreck Site]]. Promare UK was sub-contracted to conduct the magnetometer survey and Swathe Services to conduct a multibeam survey producing a site plan of geo-referenced targets of both designated sites and the Intermediate area.

The Coronation was a 90-gun second rate, built in 1685 by Isaac Betts at Portsmouth dockyard as one of the 1677 thirty-ships programme. On 3 September 1691 after patrolling for the French fleet, the English Fleet made for Plymouth. The Coronation foundered in a strong south easterly gale whilst trying to round Penlee Point with a loss of all but 13 of her crew, including the captain, Charles Skelton.

The Coronation Protected wreck site consists of two designated areas: Inshore (designated 1988) &amp; Offshore (designated 1978). The area in between these two protected sites is known as the "Intermediate" site wherein lies an unverified scatter of archaeological material.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thisismast.org/downloads/CoronationWebReport.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bamburgh Castle Beach Wreck===
A rarely seen portion of an unknown wreck within the intertidal zone of [[Bamburgh Castle]] Beach was reported to MAST by Steve Brown, a PADI Basic Archaeological Diver (BAD) Instructor and local historian. MAST has conducted two preliminary surveys of the site in 2013 to establish the extent of the site and how much remains under the sand.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thisismast.org/downloads/bamburghcastle_v3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The survival and position of some of the features within the wreck would suggest that the buried structure could be mostly intact as the position of hull structure, deck beams, masts and even deck fittings are all as would be expected from a mostly intact buried vessel.

[[Dendrochronology|Dendrochronological]] samples were taken as part of this survey to try and establish the date and origin of the vessel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.northumberlandgazette.co.uk/news/local-news/shipwreck-offers-unique-opportunity-for-study-1-6119465 |title=Shipwreck offers unique opportunity for study |publisher=Northumberland Gazette |date=2013-10-05 |accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site is now protected under the [[Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979]].

===Swash Channel Wreck Artefacts===
MAST has donated funds to conserve three of the carvings from the [[Swash Channel Wreck]] as well as a [[Canister shot|canister]]

They were raised in August 2010. The two carvings were found directly above the gunports in the bowcastle and are in extremely good condition. They bring the number of carvings found on the site to five.

The work will be done by the [[York Archaeological Trust]]. Once conserved you will be able to see the artefacts up close at [[Poole Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisismast.org/projects.html |title=Maritime Archaeology Sea Trust : Swash Channel Wreck Artefacts |publisher=Thisismast.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scubaverse.com/2013/09/20/uk-minister-for-culture-ed-vaizey-visits-the-maritime-archaeology-sea-trust-mast/ |title=UK Minister For Culture Ed Vaizey Visits The York Archaeology Trust To View Marine Artefacts &amp;#124; Scubaverse &amp;#124; The World's Best Online Dive Companion |publisher=Scubaverse |date=2013-09-20 |accessdate=2014-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102191210/http://www.scubaverse.com/2013/09/20/uk-minister-for-culture-ed-vaizey-visits-the-maritime-archaeology-sea-trust-mast/ |archivedate=2 January 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-dorset-23602554 |title=BBC News - Poole Swash Channel Wreck: Raising the rudder |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2013-08-19 |accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== MoD wrecks===
MAST, in partnership with [[Bournemouth University]], won a Ministry of Defence (MoD) contract to assess the environmental and safety risks posed by the tankers [[RFA Creosol]] (1916), [[RFA War Mehtar]] (1919) and the escort carrier [[HMS Dasher (D37)]]. This assessment includes research into the history of the wreck and its cargo/contents.

The ships fall into two broad groups, purpose-built tankers and an escort aircraft carrier converted from a merchant ship. The first two are relatively simple vessels and the third a much more complex vessel that is likely to be complicated by its conversion and change of use and reuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisismast.org/mod-wrecks.html |title=MoD wrecks |publisher=Thisismast.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Not for Profit==
MAST has conducted two major charity events off [[Plymouth Sound]]. One in 2012 and one in 2013. In September 2012 MAST raised £6,000 to raise awareness for maritime heritage in the UK and for the [[RNLI]]'s Plymouth branch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rnli.org/NewsCentre/Pages/Plymouth-RNLI-receives-%C2%A31000-donation.aspx |title=Plymouth RNLI receives £1,000 donation |publisher=Rnli.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2013, MAST raised money again to raise awareness for the need to protect UK maritime heritage but also for the charity [[Battle Back Challenge Centre|Battle Back]] which received £2,000 towards helping injured Service personnel in their rehabilitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Herald |first=Plymouth |url=http://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/Divers-delving-deep-help-injured-heroes/story-19672043-detail/story.html |title=Divers delving deep to help injured heroes |publisher=Plymouth Herald |date=2013-08-17 |accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diving Speciality==
In 2012 MAST created a [[PADI]] Distinctive Specialty called Basic Archaeological Diver, a no frills, no fuss introduction to the basics of archaeology underwater with simple recording techniques using little more than a camera and tape measures. The course is now also an [[Scuba Schools International]] accredited course and is recognised by [[British Sub Aqua Club]] (BSAC). The course is an introduction to the basics includes a lecture on the laws governing divers and underwater archaeology in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Dive Training |url=http://www.scubaverse.com/2013/08/05/an-introduction-to-the-padi-distinctive-specialty-b-a-d-basic-archaeological-diver/ |title=An Introduction to the PADI Distinctive Specialty B.A.D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9181">'''Microvias''' are used as the interconnects between layers in high density interconnect (HDI) substrates and [[printed circuit board]]s (PCBs) to accommodate the high [[input/output]] (I/O) density of advanced packages. Driven by portability and wireless communications, the electronics industry strives to produce affordable, light, and reliable products with increased functionality. At the electronic component level, this translates to components with increased I/Os with smaller footprint areas (e.g. flip-chip packages, chip-scale packages, and direct chip attachments), and on the printed circuit board and package substrate level, to the use of high density interconnects (HDIs) (e.g. finer lines and spaces, and smaller [[via (electronics)|via]]s).

== Overview ==
IPC standards revised the definition of a microvia in 2013 to a hole with an aspect ratio of 1:1. Which is ratio of the hole diameter to depth (not to exceed 0.25 mm). Previously, microvia was any hole less than or equal to 0.15 mm in diameter &lt;ref&gt;https://blog.ipc.org/2014/01/10/new-microvia-definition-seeing-broader-usage/&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advent of smartphones and hand-held electronic devices, microvias have evolved from single-level to stacked microvias that cross over multiple HDI layers. 
Sequential build-up (SBU) technology is used to fabricate HDI boards. The HDI layers are usually built up from a traditionally manufactured double-sided core board or multilayer PCB. The HDI layers are built on both sides of the traditional PCB one by one with microvias. The SBU process consists of several steps: layer lamination, via formation, via metallization, and via filling. There are multiple choices of materials and/or technologies for each step.&lt;ref&gt;Happy Holden et al., The HDI Handbook, 1st Edition. Available from: http://www.hdihandbook.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

Microvias can be filled with different materials and processes:&lt;ref name="ref4"&gt;B. Birch, “Reliability Testing for Microvias in Printed Wire Boards”, Circuit World, Vol. 35, No. 4, pp. 3 – 17, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; (1) filled with epoxy resin (b-stage) during a sequential lamination process step; (2) filled with non-conductive or conductive material other than copper as a separate processing step; (3) plated closed with electroplated copper; (4) screen printed closed with a copper paste. Buried microvias are required to be filled, while blind microvias on the external layers usually do not have any fill requirements.&lt;ref&gt;IPC-6016, “Qualification and Performance Specification for High-density Interconnect (HDI) Structures,” May 1999&lt;/ref&gt; A stacked microvia is usually filled with electroplated copper to make electrical interconnections between multiple HDI layers and provide structural support for the outer level(s) of the microvia or for a component mounted on the outermost copper pad.

== Microvia reliability ==
The reliability of HDI structure is one of the major constraints for its successful widespread implementation in the PCB industry. Good thermo-mechanical reliability of microvias is an essential part of HDI reliability. Many researchers and professionals have studied the reliability of microvias in HDI PCBs. The reliability of microvias depends on many factors such as microvia geometry parameters, dielectric material properties, and processing parameters.

Microvia reliability research has focused on experimental assessment of the reliability of single-level unfilled microvias, as well as finite element analysis on stress/strain distributions in single-level microvias and microvia fatigue life estimation. Microvia failures identified from the research include interfacial separation (separation between the base of the microvia and the target pad), barrel cracks, corner/knee cracks, and target pad cracks (also referred to as microvia pull out). These failures result from the thermomechanical stresses caused by coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch, in the PCB thickness direction, between the metallization in a microvia structure and the dielectric materials surrounding the metal. The following paragraph highlights some of the microvia reliability research.

Ogunjimi et al.&lt;ref&gt;A. O. Ogunjimi, S. Macgregor, and M. G. Pech, “The effect of manufacturing and design process variabilities on the fatigue file of the high density interconnect vias,” Journal of Electronics Manufacturing, Vol. 5, No. 2, Jule 1995, pp. 111-119&lt;/ref&gt; looked at the effect of manufacturing and design process variables on the fatigue life of microvias, including trace(conductor) thickness, layer or layers of the dielectric around the trace and in the microvia, via geometry, via wall angle, ductility coefficient of the conductor material, and strain concentration factor. Finite element models were created with different geometries, and ANOVA method was used to determine the significance of the different process variables. The ANOVA results showed that the strain concentration factor was the most important variable, followed with the ductility factor, metallization thickness, and via wall angle. Prabhu et al.&lt;ref name="ref7"&gt;A. S. Prabhu, D. B. Barker, M. G. Pecht, J. W. Evans, W. Grieg, E. S. Bernard, and E. Smith, “A Thermo-Mechanical Fatigue Analysis of High Density Interconnect Vias,” Advances in Electronic Packaging, Vol. 10, No. 1, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;  conducted a finite element analysis (FEA) on an HDI microvia structure to determine the effect of accelerated temperature cycling and thermal shock. Liu et al.&lt;ref&gt;F. Liu, J. Lu, V. Sundaram, D. Sutter, G. White and D. F. Baldwin, and Rao R, “Reliability Assessment of Microvias in HDI Printed Circuit Board”, IEEE Transactions on Components and Packaging Technologies, Vol. 25, No. 2, June 2000, pp. 254-259&lt;/ref&gt; and Ramakrishna et al.&lt;ref&gt;G. Ramakrishna, F. Liu, and S. K. Sitaramana, “Experimental and Numerical Investigation of Microvia Reliability”, The Eighth Intersociety Conference on Thermal and Thermomechanical Phenomena in Electronic Systems, 2002, pp. 932 – 939&lt;/ref&gt; conducted liquid-to-liquid and air-to-air thermal shock testing, respectively, to studied the effect of dielectric material properties and microvia geometry parameters, such as microvia diameter, wall angle and plating thickness, on microvia reliability. Andrews et al.&lt;ref&gt;[14]	P. Andrews, G. Parry, P. Reid, “Concerns in the Lead Free Assembly Environment”, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; investigated single-level microvia reliability using IST (interconnect stress test), and considered the effect of reflow cycles of lead-free solder. Wang and Lai &lt;ref&gt;T. Wang and Y. Lai, “Stress Analysis for Fracture Potential of Blind Via in a Build-up Substrate,” Circuit World, Vol. 32, No. 2, 2006, pp: 39-44&lt;/ref&gt; investigated the potential failure sites of microvias using finite element modeling. They found that filled microvias have a lower stress than unfilled microvias. Choi and Dasgupta introduced microvia non-destructive inspection method in their work.&lt;ref&gt;C. Choi and A. Dasgupta, Microvia Non-Destructive Inspection Method, Proceedings of ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition, Vol. 5, 2009, pp. 15-22, doi:10.1115/IMECE2009-11779.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although most microvia reliability research focuses on single-level microvias, Birch &lt;ref name="ref4" /&gt; tested multiple-level stacked and staggered microvias using IST test. Weibull analysis on the test data showed that single- and 2-level stacked microvias last longer than 3- and 4-level microvias (e. g.  2-level stacked microvias experienced about 20 times more cycles to failure than 4-level stacked microvias).

== Microvia voiding and its effect on thermomechanical reliability ==
[[File:MicroviaVoiding.png|thumb|right|a cross-section view of a microvia with a void]]
One challenge for high density interconnect board development, is to fabricate reliable microvias, especially for stacked microvias, without resulting in incomplete filling, dimples, or voids in the copper plating process.&lt;ref name = "ref12"&gt;Y. Ning, M. H. Azarian, and M. Pecht, Simulation of the Influence of Manufacturing Quality on Thermomechanical Stress of Microvias, IPC APEX 2014 Technical Conference, March 25–27, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The authors of &lt;ref name = "ref12" /&gt; have been investigating the risk of microvias in terms of voids and other defects using both experimental testing and finite element analysis. They found that incomplete copper filling increases the stress levels in microvias and hence decreases microvia fatigue life. As for voids, different voiding conditions, such as different void sizes, shapes, and locations result in different effects on microvia reliability. Small voids of a spherical shape lightly increase the microvia fatigue life, but extreme voiding conditions greatly reduce the duration of microvias. This team is currently developing a qualification method that the electronics industry can use to assess the risks with using an HDI circuit board that employs microvias.

In the [[philosophy of science]], '''models of scientific inquiry''' have two functions: first, to provide a descriptive account of ''how'' scientific inquiry is carried out in practice, and second, to provide an explanatory account of ''why'' scientific inquiry succeeds as well as it appears to do in arriving at genuine knowledge.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The search for scientific knowledge ends far back into antiquity.  At some point in the past, at least by the time of Aristotle, philosophers recognized that a fundamental distinction should be drawn between two kinds of scientific knowledge—roughly, knowledge ''that'' and knowledge ''why''.  It is one thing to know ''that'' each planet periodically reverses the direction of its motion with respect to the background of fixed stars;  it is quite a different matter to know ''why''.  Knowledge of the former type is descriptive;  knowledge of the latter type is explanatory.  It is explanatory knowledge that provides scientific understanding of the world.  (Salmon, 2006, pg. 3)&lt;ref name=Salmon_FourDecades/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
"Scientific inquiry refers to the diverse ways in which scientists study the natural world and propose explanations based on the evidence derived from their work."&lt;ref name=NRC-1996/&gt;

==Accounts of scientific inquiry==

===Classical model===
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
The classical model of scientific inquiry derives from [[Aristotle]], who distinguished the forms of approximate and exact reasoning, set out the threefold scheme of [[abductive reasoning|abductive]], [[deductive reasoning|deductive]], and [[inductive reasoning|inductive]] inference, and also treated the compound forms such as reasoning by [[analogy]].

===Pragmatic model===
{{main|Pragmatic theory of truth}}
{{Expand section|date=February 2018}}

===Logical empiricism===
[[Wesley Salmon]] (1989)&lt;ref name=Salmon_FourDecades/&gt; began his historical survey of scientific explanation with what he called the ''received view'', as it was received from [[Carl Gustav Hempel|Hempel]] and [[Paul Oppenheim|Oppenheim]] in the years beginning with their ''Studies in the Logic of Explanation'' (1948) and culminating in Hempel's ''[[Aspects of Scientific Explanation and other Essays in the Philosophy of Science|Aspects of Scientific Explanation]]'' (1965).  Salmon summed up his analysis of these developments by means of the following Table.

{| class="wikitable" align="center" style="text-align:center; width:90%"
|-
! Laws / Explananda !! Particular Facts !! General Regularities
|-
! Universal Laws
| D-N

Deductive-Nomological
| D-N

Deductive-Nomological
|-
! Statistical Laws
| I-S

Inductive-Statistical
| D-S

Deductive-Statistical
|}

In this classification, a [[deductive-nomological]] (D-N) explanation of an occurrence is a valid deduction whose conclusion states that the outcome to be explained did in fact occur.  The deductive argument is called an ''explanation'', its premisses are called the ''explanans'' ([[Latin|L:]] ''explaining'') and the conclusion is called the ''explanandum'' ([[Latin|L:]] ''to be explained'').  Depending on a number of additional qualifications, an explanation may be ranked on a scale from ''potential'' to ''true''.

Not all explanations in science are of the D-N type, however.  An ''inductive-statistical'' (I-S) explanation accounts for an occurrence by subsuming it under statistical laws, rather than categorical or universal laws, and the mode of subsumption is itself inductive instead of deductive.  The D-N type can be seen as a limiting case of the more general I-S type, the measure of certainty involved being complete, or [[probability]] 1, in the former case, whereas it is less than complete, probability &amp;lt; 1, in the latter case.

In this view, the D-N mode of reasoning, in addition to being used to explain particular occurrences, can also be used to explain general regularities, simply by deducing them from still more general laws.

Finally, the ''deductive-statistical'' (D-S) type of explanation, properly regarded as a subclass of the D-N type, explains statistical regularities by deduction from more comprehensive statistical laws.  (Salmon 1989, pp.&amp;nbsp;8–9)&lt;ref name=Salmon_FourDecades/&gt;.

Such was the ''received view'' of scientific explanation from the point of view of [[logical empiricism]], that Salmon says "held sway" during the third quarter of the last century (Salmon, p.&amp;nbsp;10)&lt;ref name=Salmon_FourDecades/&gt;.

==Choice of a theory==
{{See also|Commensurability (philosophy of science)}}
During the course of history, one theory has succeeded another, and some have suggested further work while others have seemed content just to explain the phenomena. The reasons why one theory has replaced another are not always obvious or simple. The philosophy of science includes the question: ''What criteria are satisfied by a 'good' theory''. This question has a long history, and many scientists, as well as philosophers, have considered it. The objective is to be able to choose one theory as preferable to another without introducing [[cognitive bias]].&lt;ref name=Kuhn/&gt; Several often proposed criteria were summarized by Colyvan.&lt;ref name=Colyvan/&gt; A good theory:
# Is elegant (Formal elegance; no ''ad hoc'' modifications)
# Contains few arbitrary or adjustable elements (simplicity/parsimony)
# Agrees with and explains all existing observations (unificatory/[[explanatory power]])
# Makes detailed predictions about future observations that can [[disprove]] or [[falsify]] the model if they are not borne out.
# Is fruitful: the emphasis by Colyvan is not only upon prediction and falsification, but also upon a theory's [[wikt:seminality|seminality]] in suggesting future work.

[[Stephen Hawking]] supports items 1–4, but does not mention fruitfulness.&lt;ref name=Hawking/&gt; On the other hand, Kuhn emphasizes the importance of seminality.&lt;ref name=Kuhn0/&gt;

The goal here is to make the choice between theories less arbitrary. Nonetheless, these criteria contain subjective elements, and are [[heuristics]] rather than part of [[scientific method]].&lt;ref name=Simplicity/&gt; Also, criteria such as these do not necessarily decide between alternative theories. Quoting Bird:&lt;ref name=Bird/&gt;
{{quote|"They [such criteria]  cannot determine scientific choice. First, which features of a theory satisfy these criteria may be disputable (''e.g.'' does simplicity concern the ontological commitments of a theory or its mathematical form?). Secondly, these criteria are imprecise, and so there is room for disagreement about the degree to which they hold. Thirdly, there can be disagreement about how they are to be weighted relative to one another, especially when they conflict." |Alexander Bird|Methodological incommensurability}}

It also is debatable whether existing scientific theories satisfy all these criteria, which may represent goals not yet achieved. For example, explanatory power over all existing observations (criterion 3) is satisfied by no one theory at the moment.&lt;ref name=Realism/&gt;
{{quote|Whatever might be the ultimate goals of some scientists, science, as it is currently practiced, depends on multiple overlapping descriptions of the world, each of which has a domain of applicability. In some cases this domain is very large, but in others quite small.&lt;ref name=Davies/&gt;|E.B. Davies |Epistemological pluralism, p. 4}}

The [[wikt:desiderata|desiderata]] of a "good" theory have been debated for centuries, going back perhaps even earlier than [[Occam's razor]],&lt;ref name=Desiderata/&gt; which often is taken as an attribute of a good theory. Occam's razor might fall under the heading of "elegance", the first item on the list, but too zealous an application was cautioned by [[Albert Einstein]]: "Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler."&lt;ref name=Einstein/&gt; It is arguable that ''parsimony'' and ''elegance'' "typically pull in different directions".&lt;ref name=Baker/&gt;   The falsifiability item on the list is related to the criterion proposed by Popper as demarcating a scientific theory from a theory like astrology: both "explain" observations, but the scientific theory takes the risk of making predictions that decide whether it is right or wrong:&lt;ref name=Popper1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Popper0/&gt;
{{quote|"It must be possible for an empirical scientific system to be refuted by experience."
"Those among us who are unwilling to expose their ideas to the hazard of refutation do not take part in the game of science."
|Karl Popper|The logic of scientific discovery, p. 18 and p. 280}}
[[Thomas Kuhn]] argued that changes in scientists' views of reality not only contain subjective elements, but result from group dynamics, "revolutions" in scientific practice which result in [[paradigm shift]]s.&lt;ref name=Kuhn2/&gt; As an example, Kuhn suggested that the [[heliocentric]] "[[Copernican Revolution]]" replaced the [[geocentric]] views of [[Ptolemy]] not because of empirical failures, but because of a new "paradigm" that exerted control over what scientists felt to be the more fruitful way to pursue their goals.

==Aspects of scientific inquiry==

===Deduction and induction===
[[Deductive logic]] and [[inductive logic]] are quite different in their approaches.

'''Deductive logic''' is the reasoning of proof, or [[Logical consequence|logical implication]]. It is the logic used in mathematics and other [[axiomatic system]]s such as formal logic. In a deductive system, there will be [[axiom]]s (postulates) which are not proven. Indeed, they cannot be proven without circularity. There will also be primitive terms which are not defined, as they cannot be defined without circularity. For example, one can define a line as a set of points, but to then define a point as the intersection of two lines would be circular. Because of these interesting characteristics of [[formal system]]s, Bertrand Russell humorously referred to mathematics as "the field where we don't know what we are talking about, nor whether or not what we say is true". All theorems and corollaries are proven by exploring the implications of the axiomata and other theorems that have previously been developed. New terms are defined using the primitive terms and other derived definitions based on those primitive terms.

In a deductive system, one can correctly use the term "proof", as applying to a theorem. To say that a theorem is proven means that it is impossible for the axioms to be true and the theorem to be false. For example, we could do a simple [[syllogism]] such as the following:

# [[Arches National Park]] lies within the state of [[Utah]].
# I am standing in Arches National Park.
# Therefore, I am standing in the state of Utah.

Notice that it is not possible (assuming all of the trivial qualifying criteria are supplied) to be in Arches and not be in Utah. However, one can be in Utah while not in Arches National Park. The implication only works in one direction. Statements (1) and (2) taken together imply statement (3). Statement (3) does not imply anything about statements (1) or (2). Notice that we have not proven statement (3), but we have shown that statements (1) and (2) together imply statement (3). In mathematics, what is proven is not the truth of a particular theorem, but that the axioms of the system imply the theorem. In other words, it is impossible for the axioms to be true and the theorem to be false. The strength of deductive systems is that they are sure of their results. The weakness is that they are abstract constructs which are, unfortunately, one step removed from the physical world. They are very useful, however, as mathematics has provided great insights into natural science by providing useful models of natural phenomena. One result is the development of products and processes that benefit mankind.

Learning about the physical world requires the use of '''inductive logic'''. This is the logic of theory building. It is useful in such widely divergent enterprises as science and crime scene detective work. One makes a set of observations, and seeks to explain what one sees. The observer forms a hypothesis in an attempt to explain what he/she has observed. The hypothesis will have implications, which will point to certain other observations that would naturally result from either a repeat of the experiment or making more observations from a slightly different set of circumstances. If the predicted observations hold true, one feels excitement that they may be on the right track. However, the hypothesis has not been proven. The hypothesis implies that certain observations should follow, but positive observations do not imply the hypothesis. They only make it more believable. It is quite possible that some other hypothesis could also account for the known observations, and may do better with future experiments. The implication flows in only one direction, as in the syllogism used in the discussion on deduction. Therefore, it is never correct to say that a scientific principle or hypothesis/theory has been proven. (At least, not in the rigorous sense of proof used in deductive systems.)

A classic example of this is the study of gravitation. Newton formed a law for gravitation stating that the force of gravitation is directly proportional to the product of the two masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. For over 170 years, all observations seemed to validate his equation. However, telescopes eventually became powerful enough to see a slight discrepancy in the orbit of Mercury. Scientists tried everything imaginable to explain the discrepancy, but they could not do so using the objects that would bear on the orbit of Mercury. Eventually, Einstein developed his theory of [[general relativity]] and it explained the orbit of Mercury and all other known observations dealing with gravitation. During the long period of time when scientists were making observations that seemed to validate Newton's theory, they did not, in fact, prove his theory to be true. However, it must have seemed at the time that they did. It only took one counterexample (Mercury's orbit) to prove that there was something wrong with his theory.

This is typical of inductive logic. All of the observations that seem to validate the theory, do not prove its truth. But one counter-example can prove it false.  That means that deductive logic is used in the evaluation of a theory.  In other words, if A implies B, then not B implies not A.  Einstein's theory of General Relativity has been supported by many observations using the best scientific instruments and experiments. However, his theory now has the same status as Newton's theory of gravitation prior to seeing the problems in the orbit of Mercury. It is highly credible and validated with all we know, but it is not proven. It is only the best we have at this point in time.

Another example of correct scientific reasoning is shown in the current search for the [[Higgs boson]].  Scientists on the [[Compact Muon Solenoid]] experiment at the [[Large Hadron Collider]] have conducted experiments yielding data suggesting the existence of the Higgs boson. However, realizing that the results could possibly be explained as a background fluctuation and not the Higgs boson, they are cautious and waiting for further data from future experiments.  Said Guido Tonelli:

{{Quote|"We cannot exclude the presence of the [[Standard Model]] Higgs between 115 and 127 [[GeV]] because of a modest excess of events in this mass region that appears, quite consistently, in five independent channels [...] As of today what we see is consistent either with a background fluctuation or with the presence of the boson."}}

A brief overview of the '''scientific method''' would then contain these steps as a minimum:

# Make a set of observations regarding the phenomenon being studied.
# Form a hypothesis that might explain the observations.  (Inductive Step)
# Identify the implications and outcomes that must follow, if the hypothesis is to be true.
# Perform other experiments or observations to see if any of the predicted outcomes fail.
# If any predicted outcomes fail, the hypothesis is proven false since if A implies B, then not B implies not A.  (Deductive Logic)  It is then necessary to change the hypothesis and go back to step 3.  If the predicted outcomes are confirmed, the hypothesis is not proved, but rather can be said to be consistent with known data.

When a hypothesis has survived a sufficient number of tests, it may be promoted to a [[scientific theory]].  A theory is a hypothesis that has survived many tests and seems to be consistent with other established scientific theories.  Since a theory is a promoted hypothesis, it is of the same 'logical' species and shares the same logical limitations.  Just as a hypothesis cannot be proven but can be disproved, that same is true for a theory.  It is a difference of degree, not kind.

'''Arguments from analogy''' are another type of inductive reasoning. In arguing from analogy, one infers that since two things are alike in several respects, they are likely to be alike in another respect. This is, of course, an assumption. It is natural to attempt to find similarities between two phenomena and wonder what one can learn from those similarities. However, to notice that two things share attributes in several respects does not imply any similarities in other respects. It is possible that the observer has already noticed all of the attributes that are shared and any other attributes will be distinct. Argument from analogy is an unreliable method of reasoning that can lead to erroneous conclusions, and thus cannot be used to establish scientific facts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1381">'''Moral evil''' is the result of any morally negative event caused by the intentional action or inaction of an agent, such as a person. An example of a moral evil might be [[murder]], or any other [[evil]] event for which someone can be held responsible or culpable.&lt;ref&gt;"The Two Types of Evil." BBC News. BBC, n.d. Web. 13 Sept. 2014. [http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/rs/god/chgoodandevilrev1.shtml Christianity: good and evil]&lt;/ref&gt;

This concept can be contrasted with [[natural evil]], in which a bad event occurs naturally, without the intervention of an agent. The dividing line between natural and moral evil is not absolutely clear however, as some behaviour can be unintentional yet morally significant and some natural events (for example, global warming) can be caused by intentional actions.

The distinction of evil from 'bad' is complex. Evil is more than simply 'negative' or 'bad' (i.e. undesired or inhibiting good) as evil is on its own, and without reference to any other event, morally incorrect. The validity of 'moral evil' as a term, therefore, rests on the validity of morals in [[ethics]].

== Overview ==
The group was formed at the University of California campus in Santa Barbara to create a collaborative problem-solving approach to address widespread and complicated problems, modeled after approaches at the [[Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics]] (KITP). Novim organizes study teams of scientists, researchers, and area experts to evaluate issues like [[climate engineering]], [[global surface temperature]]s, and [[Environmental impact of hydraulic fracturing in the United States|methane leakage]]s in [[natural gas]] production. Their criteria for issue selection is that it must be "highly complex, controversial and global." They partner with governmental organizations, like the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] and [[Office of Science]], to engage them in the process, share findings and discuss potential actions.&lt;ref name=Cooper&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.noozhawk.com/article/011410_undersecretary_of_science_talks_sustainability_at_ucsb/|title= Undersecretary for Science Talks Sustainability at UCSB|date=2010-01-14|accessdate=2010-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fernandez&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.noozhawk.com/article/090609_novim_global_issues/|title= Novim Aims to Close Information Gap on Pressing Global Issues|date=2009-09-06|accessdate=2009-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally an '''oath''' (from [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] ''{{lang|ang|[[:wikt:að|āð]]}}'', also called '''plight''') is either a [[utterance|statement]] of [[fact]] or a [[promise]] with wording relating to something considered [[sacred]] as a sign of verity. A common legal substitute for those who conscientiously object to making sacred oaths is to give an [[Affirmation in law|affirmation]] instead. Nowadays, even when there is no notion of sanctity involved, certain promises said out loud in ceremonial or juridical purpose are referred to as oaths. "To [[:wikt:swear|swear]]" is a [[verb]] used to describe the taking of an oath, to making a solemn [[vow]].

==Divine oath==
Usually oaths have referred to a [[deity]] significant in the cultural sphere in question. The reciter's personal views upon the divinity of the aspects considered sacred in a predictated text of an oath may or may not be taken in to account. There might not be alternative personal proclamations with no mention of the sacred [[dogma]] in question, such as affirmations, to be made. This might mean an [[impasse]] to those with unwillingness to edify the dogma they see as untrue and those who decline to refer to sacred matters on the subject at hand.

The essence of a divine oath is an invocation of divine agency to be a guarantor of the oath taker's own honesty and integrity in the matter under question. By implication, this invokes divine displeasure if the oath taker fails in their sworn duties. It therefore implies greater care than usual in the act of the performance of one's duty, such as in testimony to the facts of the matter in a court of law.

A person taking an oath indicates this in a number of ways. The most usual is the explicit "I swear", but any statement or promise that includes "with * as my witness" or "so help me *", with '*' being something or someone the oath-taker holds sacred, is an oath. Many people take an oath by holding in their hand or placing over their head a book of [[scripture]] or a sacred object, thus indicating the sacred witness through their action: such an oath is called ''corporal''. However, the chief purpose of such an act is for ceremony or solemnity, and the act does not of itself make an oath.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}

==Historical development as a legal concept==
Making vows and taking oaths became a symbolic concept in law practice that developed over time in different cultures.

=== Jewish tradition ===
The concept of oaths is deeply rooted within [[Judaism]]. It is found in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 8:21, when God swears that he will "never again curse the ground because of man and never again smite every living thing". This repetition of the term ''never again'' is explained by [[Rashi]], the pre-eminent biblical commentator, as serving as an oath, citing the [[Talmud]] Shavous 36a for this ruling.&lt;ref&gt;Metsudah Chumash and Rashi, KTAV Publishing House, 1991. page 88&lt;/ref&gt;

The first personage in the biblical tradition to take an oath is held to be [[Eliezer]], the chief servant of [[Abraham]], when the latter requested of the former that he not take a wife for his son [[Isaac]] from the daughters of Canaan, but rather from among Abraham's own family.

The foundational text for oath making is in  [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 30:2: "When a man voweth a vow unto the Lord, or sweareth an oath to bind his soul with a bond, he shall not break his word; he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth." According to the Rabbis, a [[neder]] (usually translated as "vow") refers to the object, a ''shâmar'' (usually translated as "oath") to the person. The passage distinguishes between a ''neder'' and a ''shvua'', an important distinction between the two in [[Halakha]]: a ''neder'' changes the status of some external thing, while a ''shvua'' initiates an internal change in the one who swears the oath.

=== Roman tradition ===
In the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] tradition, oaths were sworn upon ''[[Iuppiter Lapis]]'' or the Jupiter Stone located in the [[Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus|Temple of Jupiter]], [[Capitoline Hill]]. ''Iuppiter Lapis'' was held in the Roman tradition to be an [[Oath Stone]], an aspect of Jupiter in his role as divine law-maker responsible for order and used principally for the investiture of the oathtaking of office.

According to Cyril Bailey, in "The Religion of Ancient Rome" (1907):

{{Quote| text=We have, for instance, the sacred stone (''[[Silex#Archaic and foreign uses|silex]]'') which was preserved in the temple of Iuppiter on the Capitol, and was brought out to play a prominent part in the ceremony of treaty-making. The [[fetial]], who on that occasion represented the Roman people, at the solemn moment of the oath-taking, struck the sacrificial pig with the ''silex'', saying as he did so, "Do thou, [[Jupiter (mythology)|Diespiter]], strike the Roman people as I strike this pig here to-day, and strike them the more, as thou art greater and stronger." Here no doubt the underlying notion is not merely symbolical, but in origin the stone is itself the god, an idea which later religion expressed in the cult-title specially used in this connection, ''Iuppiter Lapis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bailey |first=Cyril |date=1907 |title=The Religion of Ancient Rome |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/18564/18564-h/18564-h.htm#CHAPTER_II |location=London |publisher=Archibald Constable &amp; Co. Ltd. |page=7 |access-date=2015-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The punisher of broken oaths was the [[Hell|infernal]] deity [[Orcus]].

=== Greek tradition ===
[[Walter Burkert]] has shown that since [[Lycurgus of Athens]] (d. 324 BCE), who held that "it is the oath which holds democracy together", religion, morality and political organization had been linked by the oath, and the oath and its prerequisite altar had become the basis of both civil and criminal, as well as international law.&lt;ref&gt;Burkert, ''Greek Religion'', trans. Raffan, Harvard University Press (1985), 250ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Christian tradition===

Various religious groups have objected to the taking of oaths, most notably the [[Religious Society of Friends]] (Quakers) and [[Anabaptism|Anabaptist]] groups, like [[Mennonite]]s, [[Amish]], [[Hutterite]]s and [[Schwarzenau Brethren]]. This is principally based on {{Bibleverse||Matthew|5:34–37}}, the [[Antithesis of the Law]]. Here, Christ is written to say "I say to you: '[[Swear not at all]]{{'"}}. [[James the Just]] stated in {{Bibleverse|James|5:12}}, "Above all, my brothers, do not swear—not by heaven or by earth or by anything else. Let your 'Yes' be yes, and your 'No', no, or you will be condemned." Beyond this scriptural authority, Quakers place importance on being truthful at all times, so the testimony opposing oaths springs from a view that "taking legal oaths implies a double standard of truthfulness"&lt;ref&gt;Faith and Practice of Baltimore Yearly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends (1988) p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that truthfulness in legal contexts is somehow more important than truthfulness in non-legal contexts and that truthfulness in those other contexts is therefore somehow less important.

Not all [[Christianity|Christians]] interpret this reading as forbidding all types of oaths, however. Opposition to oath-taking among some groups of Christian caused many problems for these groups throughout their history. [[Quaker]]s were frequently imprisoned because of their refusal to swear [[loyalty oath]]s. Testifying in court was also difficult; [[George Fox]], Quakers' founder, famously challenged a judge who had asked him to swear, saying that he would do so once the judge could point to any [[Bible]] passage where Jesus or his apostles took oaths. (The judge could not, but this did not allow Fox to escape punishment.) Legal reforms from the 18th century onwards mean that everyone in the [[United Kingdom]] now has the right to make a solemn [[Affirmation in law|affirmation]] instead of an oath. The [[United States]] has permitted affirmations since it was founded; it is explicitly mentioned in the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]. Only President [[Franklin Pierce]] has chosen to affirm rather than swear at his inauguration.

As late as 1880, [[Charles Bradlaugh]] was denied a seat as an MP in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] because of his professed [[atheism]] as he was judged unable to swear the [[Oath of Allegiance (UK)|Oath of Allegiance]] in spite of his proposal to swear the oath as a "matter of form".

=== Islam ===
Islam takes the fulfillment of oaths extremely seriously.
{{quote|God does not hold you responsible for the mere utterance of oaths; He holds you responsible for your actual intentions. If you violate an oath, you shall atone by feeding ten poor people from the same food you offer to your own family, or clothing them, or by freeing a slave. If you cannot afford this, then you shall fast three days. This is the atonement for violating the oaths that you swore to keep. You shall fulfill your oaths. God thus explains His revelations to you, that you may be appreciative.|Quran Chapter 5: Verse 89}}

=== Germanic tradition ===
{{Further|Symbel|Feudalism}}
[[Germanic tribes|Germanic]] [[warrior culture]] was significantly based on oaths of fealty.

A prose passage inserted in the eddic poem ''[[Helgakviða Hjörvarðssonar]]'' relates:
Hedin was coming home alone from the forest one [[Yule]]-eve, and found a [[troll]]-woman; she rode on a wolf, and had snakes in place of a bridle. She asked Hedin for his company. "Nay," said he. She said, "Thou shalt pay for this at the ''bragarfull''." That evening the great vows were taken; the sacred boar was brought in, the men laid their hands thereon, and took their vows at the ''bragarfull''. Hedin vowed that he would have Sváva, Eylimi's daughter, the beloved of his brother Helgi; then such great grief seized him that he went forth on wild paths southward over the land, and found Helgi, his brother.

Such Norse traditions are directly parallel to the "bird oaths" of late medieval France, such as the [[voeux du faisan]] (oath on the pheasant) or the (fictional) [[voeux du paon]] (oath on the peacock). Huizinga, ''[[The Autumn of the Middle Ages]]'' (ch. 3); Michel Margue, "Vogelgelübde" am Hof des Fürsten. Ritterliches Integrationsritual zwischen Traditions- und Gegenwartsbezug (14. – 15. Jahrhundert)

=== Modern law ===
{{redirect|Under oath|the American rock band|Underoath}}
In the modern law, oaths are made by a witness to a court of law before giving testimony and usually by a newly appointed government officer to the people of a state before taking office. 

However, in both of those cases, an [[affirmation in law|affirmation]] can usually be replaced with a written statement, only if the author swears the statement is true. This statement is called an ''[[affidavit]]''. 

The oath given to support an affidavit is frequently administered by a [[notary]], who will certify the giving of the oath by affixing her or his seal to the document. Willfully delivering a false oath (or affirmation) is the crime of [[perjury]]. 

There are some places where there is a confusion between the "oath" and other statements or promises. For example, the current [[Olympic Oath]] is really a [[Promise|pledge]], not properly an oath, since there is only a promise but there is no appeal to a sacred witness.

Oaths may also be confused with [[vow]]s, but vows are really just a special kind of an oath.

Instead of, or in addition to, holding one's hand upon an object of ceremonial importance, it can be customary for a person swearing an oath to hold a raised hand in a specific gesture. Most often the right hand is raised. This custom has been explained with reference to medieval practices of branding palms.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;se=gglsc&amp;d=454360]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Parapatric Speciation Schematic.svg|Right|thumb|300px|A diagram representing population subject to a selective gradient of phenotypic or genotypic frequencies (a cline). Each end of the gradient experiences different selective conditions (divergent selection). Reproductive isolation occurs upon the formation of a hybrid zone. In most cases, the hybrid zone may become eliminated due to a selective disadvantage. This effectively completes the speciation process.]]
{{Evolutionary biology}}
In '''parapatric speciation''', two subpopulations of a species evolve [[reproductive isolation]] from one another while continuing to exchange [[genes]]. This mode of [[speciation]] has three distinguishing characteristics: 1) mating occurs non-randomly, 2) [[gene flow]] occurs unequally, and 3) populations exist in either continuous or discontinuous geographic ranges. This distribution pattern may be the result of unequal [[Biological dispersal|dispersal]], incomplete geographical barriers, or [[Genetic divergence|divergent]] expressions of behavior, among other things. Parapatric speciation predicts that hybrid zones will often exist at the junction between the two populations.

In [[biogeography]], the terms '''parapatric''' and '''parapatry''' are often used to describe the relationship between [[organism]]s whose ranges do not significantly overlap but are immediately adjacent to each other; they do not occur together except in a narrow contact zone. Parapatry is a geographical distribution opposed to [[sympatry]] (same area) and [[allopatry]] or [[peripatry]] (two similar cases of distinct areas).

Various "forms" of parapatry have been proposed and are discussed below. [[Jerry Coyne|Coyne]] and [[H. Allen Orr|Orr]] in ''Speciation'' categorise these forms into three groups: [[cline (biology)|clinal]] (environmental gradients), "stepping-stone" (discrete populations), and stasipatric speciation in concordance with most of the parapatric speciation literature.&lt;ref name="Speciation"&gt;{{Citation | title=Speciation | author1=Jerry A. Coyne |author1link=Jerry Coyne |author2=H. Allen Orr |author2link=H. Allen Orr | date=2004 | pages=1–545 | publisher=Sinauer Associates | isbn=0-87893-091-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|111}} Henceforth, the models are subdivided following a similar format.

[[Charles Darwin]] was the first to propose this mode of speciation. It was not until 1930 when [[Ronald Fisher]] published ''[[The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection]]'' where he outlined a verbal theoretical model of '''clinal speciation'''. In 1981, [[Joseph Felsenstein]] proposed an alternative, "discrete population" model (the "stepping-stone model). Since Darwin, a great deal of research has been conducted on parapatric speciation—concluding that its mechanisms are theoretically plausible, "and has most certainly occurred in nature".&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|124}}

== Models ==
Mathematical models, laboratory studies, and observational evidence supports the existence of parapatric speciation's occurrence in nature. The qualities of parapatry imply a partial extrinsic barrier during divergence;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Sympatric, parapatric or allopatric: the most important way to classify speciation? | author=Roger K. Butlin, Juan Galindo, and John W.

This problem poses the unanswered question as to its overall frequency in nature.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|124}}

Parapatric speciation can be understood as a level of gene flow between populations where &lt;math&gt;m=0&lt;/math&gt; in allopatry (and peripatry), &lt;math&gt;m=0.5&lt;/math&gt; in sympatry, and midway between the two in parapatry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Fitness landscapes and the origin of species | edition= | author=Sergey Gavrilets | date=2004 | pages=13 | publisher=Princeton University Press | isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Intrinsic to this, parapatry covers the entire continuum; represented as &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; m &lt; 0.5&lt;/math&gt;. Some biologists reject this delineation, advocating the disuse of the term "parapatric" outright, "because many different spatial distributions can result in intermediate levels of gene flow".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=The Language of Speciation | author=Richard G.

[[Natural selection]] has been shown to be the primary driver in parapatric speciation (among other modes),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=The Speciation Revolution | author=J. Mallet | journal=Journal of Evolutionary Biology | year=2001 | volume=14 | issue=6 | pages=887–888 | doi=10.1046/j.1420-9101.2001.00342.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the strength of selection during divergence is often an important factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Theory and speciation | author=Michael Turelli, Nicholas H. Barton, and Jerry A.

Hochberg, Barry Sinervo, and Sam P. Brown | journal=Evolution | year=2003 | volume=57 | issue=1 | pages=154–158 | doi=10.1554/0014-3820(2003)057[0154:sms]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environmental gradients ===
Due to the continuous nature of a parapatric population distribution, population niches will often overlap, producing a continuum in the species’ ecological role across an environmental gradient.&lt;ref name="ClineSpeciation"&gt;{{Citation |title=Speciation along environmental gradients | author=Michael Doebeli and Ulf Dieckmann | journal=Nature | year=2003 | volume=421 | pages=259–264 | doi=10.1038/nature01274 | bibcode=2003Natur.421..259D }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas in allopatric or peripatric speciation—in which geographically isolated populations may evolve reproductive isolation without gene flow—the reduced gene flow of parapatric speciation will often produce a [[cline (biology)|cline]] in which a variation in evolutionary pressures causes a change to occur in [[Allele frequency|allele frequencies]] within the [[gene pool]] between populations. This environmental gradient ultimately results in genetically distinct sister species.

[[Ronald Fisher|Fisher's]] original conception of clinal speciation relied on (unlike most modern speciation research) the [[morphological species concept]].&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|113}} With this interpretation, his verbal, theoretical model ''can'' effectively produce a new species; of which was subsequently confirmed mathematically.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Selection for migration modification | author=Beverley J. Balkau and Marcus W. Feldman | journal=Genetics | year=1973 | volume=74 | issue=1 | pages=171–174 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|113}} Further mathematical models have been developed to demonstrate the possibility of clinal speciation with most relying on, what Coyne and Orr assert are, "assumptions that are either restrictive or biologically unrealistic".&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|113}}

A mathematical model for clinal speciation was developed by Caisse and Antonovics that found evidence that, "both genetic divergence and reproductive isolation may therefore occur between populations connected by gene flow".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Evolution in closely adjacent plant populations | author=Michelle Caisse and Janis Antonovics | journal=Heredity | year=1978 | volume=40 | pages=371–384 | doi=10.1038/hdy.1978.44 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This research supports clinal isolation comparable to a ring species (discussed below), except that the terminal geographic ends do not meet to form a ring.

Doebeli and Dieckmann developed a mathematical model that suggested that [[Ecology|ecological]] contact is an important factor in parapatric speciation and that, despite gene flow acting as a barrier to divergence in the local population, [[disruptive selection]] drives assortative mating; eventually leading to a complete reduction in gene flow. This model resembles [[Reinforcement (speciation)|reinforcement]] with the exception that there is never a secondary contact event. The authors conclude that, "spatially localized interactions along environmental gradients can facilitate speciation through [[frequency-dependent selection]] and result in patterns of geographical segregation between the emerging species."&lt;ref name="ClineSpeciation"/&gt; However, one study by Polechová and Barton disputes these conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Speciation Through Competition: A Critical Review | author=Jitka Polechová and Nicholas H. Barton | journal=Evolution | year=2005 | volume=59 | issue=6 | pages=1194–1210 | url= | doi=10.1111/j.0014-3820.2005.tb01771.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ring species ====
{{Main article|Ring species}}
[[File:Ring Species (gene flow around a barrier).png|Right|thumb|300px|In a ring species, individuals are able to successfully reproduce (exchange genes) with members of their own species in adjacent populations occupying a suitable [[habitat]] around a geographic barrier. Individuals at the ends of the cline are unable to reproduce when they come into contact.]]
The concept of a ring species is associated with allopatric speciation as a special case;&lt;ref name="ajhelbig"&gt;{{Citation | title=A ring of species| author=A. J. Helbig| journal=Heredity| year=2005| volume=95| issue=| pages=113–114| doi= 10.1038/sj.hdy.6800679}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, Coyne and Orr argue that [[Ernst Mayr|Mayr's]] original conception of a ring species does not describe allopatric speciation, "but speciation occurring through the attenuation of gene flow with distance". They contend that ring species provide evidence of parapatric speciation in a non-conventional sense.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|102–103}} They go on to conclude that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Nevertheless, ring species are more convincing than cases of clinal isolation for showing that gene flow hampers the evolution of reproductive isolation. In clinal isolation, one can argue that reproductive isolation was caused by environmental differences that increase with distance between populations. One cannot make a similar argument for ring species because the most reproductively isolated populations occur in the ''same'' habitat.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|102}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Discrete populations ===
Referred to as a "stepping-stone" model by Coyne and Orr, it differs by virtue of the species population distribution pattern. Populations in discrete groups undoubtedly speciate more easily than those in a cline due to more limited gene flow.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|115}} This allows for a population to evolve reproductive isolation as either [[natural selection|selection]] or [[genetic drift|drift]] overpower gene flow between the populations. The smaller the discrete population, the species will likely undergo a higher rate of parapatric speciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Patterns of Parapatric Speciation | author=Sergey Gavrilets, Hai Li, and Michael D. Vose | journal=Evolution | year=2000 | volume=54 | issue=4 | pages=1126–1134 | doi=10.1554/0014-3820(2000)054[1126:pops]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several mathematical models have been developed to test whether this form of parapatric speciation can occur, providing theoretical possibility and supporting biological plausibility (dependent on the models parameters and their concordance with nature).&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|115}} [[Joseph Felsenstein]] was the first to develop a working model.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|115}} Later, [[Sergey Gavrilets]] and colleagues developed numerous analytical and dynamical models of parapatric speciation that have contributed significantly to the quantitative study of speciation. (See the "Further reading" section)

==== Para-allopatric speciation ====
Further concepts developed by [[Nick Barton|Barton]] and [[Godfrey Hewitt|Hewitt]] in studying 170 [[hybrid zone]]s, suggested that parapatric speciation can result from the same components that cause allopatric speciation. Called para-allopatric speciation, populations begin diverging parapatrically, fully speciating only after allopatry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Adaptation, speciation and hybrid zones | author=N. H. Barton and G. M. Hewitt | journal=Nature | year=1989 | volume=341 | pages=497–503 | doi=10.1038/341497a0 | bibcode=1989Natur.341..497B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stasipatric models ===
One variation of parapatric speciation involves species chromosomal differences. [[Michael J. D. White]] developed the stasipatric speciation model when studying Australian morabine grasshoppers (''[[Morabinae|Vandiemenella]]''). The chromosomal structure of sub-populations of a widespread species become [[Underdominance|underdominate]]; leading to [[Fixation (population genetics)|fixation]]. Subsequently, the sub-populations expand within the species larger range, [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridizing]] (with [[Sterility (physiology)|sterility]] of the [[offspring]]) in narrow hybrid zones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Modes of Speciation | edition= | author=M. J. D. White | date=1978 | pages= | publisher=W. H. Freeman and Company | isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Douglas J. Futuyma|Futuyama]] and [[Gregory C. Mayer|Mayer]] contend that this form of parapatric speciation is untenable and that [[chromosomal rearrangement]]s are unlikely to cause speciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Non-Allopatric Speciation in Animals | author=Douglas J. Futuyma and Gregory C. Mayer | journal=Systematic Biology | year=1980 | volume=29 | issue=3 | pages=254–271 | doi=10.1093/sysbio/29.3.254 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, data does support that chromosomal rearrangements can possibly lead to reproductive isolation, but it does not mean speciation results as a consequence.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|259}}

== Evidence ==
=== Laboratory evidence ===
{{see also|Laboratory experiments of speciation}}
Very few laboratory studies have been conducted that explicitly test for parapatric speciation. However, research concerning [[sympatric speciation]] often lends support to the occurrence of parapatry. This is due to the fact that, in symaptric speciation, gene flow within a population is unrestricted; whereas in parapatric speciation, gene flow is limited—thus allowing reproductive isolation to evolve easier.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|117}} [[Anders Ödeen|Ödeen]] and [[Ann-Britt Florin|Florin]] complied 63 laboaratory experiments conducted between the years 1950–2000 (many of which were discussed by [[William R. Rice|Rice]] and [[Ellen E. Hostert|Hostert]] previously&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Laboratory experiments on speciation: heat have we learned in 40 years? | author=William R. Rice and Ellen E. Hostert | journal=Evolution | year=1993 | volume=47 | issue=6 | pages=1637–1653 | doi=10.2307/2410209}}&lt;/ref&gt;) concerning sympatric and parapatric speciation. They contend that the laboratory evidence is more robust than often suggested, citing laboratory populations sizes as the primary shortcoming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Effective population size may limit the power of laboratory experiments to demonstrate sympatric and parapatric speciation | author=Anders Ödeen and Ann-Britt Florin | journal=Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B | year=2000 | volume=267 | pages=601–606 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2000.1044| pmc=1690569 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Observational evidence ===
Parapatric speciation is very difficult to observe in nature. This is due to one primary factor: patterns of parapatry can easily be explained by an alternate mode of speciation. Particularly, documenting closely related species sharing common boundaries does not imply that parapatric speciation was the mode that created this geographic distribution pattern.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|118}} Coyne and Orr assert that the most convincing evidence of parapatric speciation comes in two forms. This is described by the following criteria:

* ''Species populations that join, forming an [[ecotone]] can be interpreted as convincingly forming in parapatry if'':
** No evidence exists for a period of geographic separation between two closely related species
** Different [[locus (genetics)|loci]] are not in agreement along the cline 
** [[Phylogenetic tree|Phylogenies]] including sister groups support different divergence times 
* ''An [[Endemism|endemic]] species that exists within a specialized habitat next to its sister species that does not reside in the specialized habitat strongly suggests parapatric speciation.''&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|118–123}}

[[File:AnthoxanthumOdoratum.jpg|right|thumb|200px|''[[Anthoxanthum odoratum]]'']]
This has been exemplified by the grass species ''[[Agrostis tenuis]]'' that grows on soil contaminated with high levels of copper leeched from an unused mine. Adjacent is the non-contaminated soil. The populations are evolving reproductive isolation due to differences in flowering. The same phenomenon has been found in ''[[Anthoxanthum odoratum]]'' in lead and zinc contaminated soils.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Evolution in Closely Adjacent Plant Populations. IV. Barriers to Gene Flow | author=Thomas McNeilly and Janis Antonovics | journal=Heredity | year=1968 | volume=23 | pages=205–218 | doi=10.1038/hdy.1968.29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Evolution in closely adjacent plant populations X: long-term persistence of prereproductive isolation at a mine boundary | author=Janis Antonovics | journal=Heredity | year=2006 | volume=97 | pages=33–37 | doi=10.1038/sj.hdy.6800835 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cline (biology)|Clines]] are often cited as evidence of parapatric speciation and numerous examples have been documented to exist in nature; many of which contain hybrid zones. These clinal patterns, however, can also often be explained by allopatric speciation followed by a period of secondary contact—causing difficulty for researchers attempting to determine their origin.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|118}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Analysis of Hybrid Zones | author=N. H. Barton and G. M. Hewitt | journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics | year=1985 | volume=16 | pages=113–148 | doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.16.1.113}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas B. Smith and colleagues posit that large ecotones are "centers for speciation" (implying parapatric speciation) and are involved in the production of [[biodiversity]] in tropical rainforests.

Jiggins|Jiggins]] and [[James Mallet|Mallet]] surveyed a range of literature documenting every phase of parapatric speciation in nature positing that it is both ''possible'' and ''likely'' (in the studied species discussed).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Bimodal hybrid zones and speciation | author=Chris D.

A study of tropical cave snails (''[[Georissa saulae]]'') found that cave-dwelling population descended from the above-ground population, likely speciating in parapatry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Possible speciation with gene flow in tropical cave snails | author=M.

Haase | journal=Journal of Zoological Systematics and Evolutionary Research | year=2004 | volume=43 | issue=2 | pages=133–138 | doi=10.1111/j.1439-0469.2004.00289.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Partula (gastropod)|Partula]]'' snails on the island of [[Mo'orea]] have parapatrically speciated ''in situ'' after a single or a few colonization events, with some species expressing patterns of ring species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=The genus ''Partula'' on Moorea: speciation in progress | author=J.

In the [[Tennessee cave salamander]],  timing of migration was used to infer the differences in [[gene flow]] between cave-dwelling and surface-dwelling continuous populations. Concentrated gene flow and mean migration time results inferred a [[heterogenetic]] distribution and continuous parapatric speciation between populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Recent divergence with gene flow in Tennessee cave salamanders (Plethodontidae: Gyrinophilus) inferred from gene genealogies | author=M.

Researchers studying ''[[Ephedra]]'', a genus of [[gymnosperms]] in North American, found evidence of parapatric niche divergence for the sister species pairs ''E. californica'' and ''E. trifurca''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Diversification in North American arid lands: niche conservatism, divergence and expansion of habitat explain speciation in the genus Ephedra | author=I.

One study of Caucasian rock lizards suggested that habitat differences may be more important in the development of reproductive isolation than isolation time. ''[[Darevskia]] rudis'', ''D. valentini''  and ''D. portschinskii'' all hybridize with each other in their [[hybrid zone]]; however, hybridization is stronger between ''D. portschinskii'' and ''D. rudis'', which separated earlier but live in similar habitats than between ''D. valentini'' and two other species, which separated later but live in climatically different habitats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Speciation in Caucasian lizards: climatic dissimilarity of the habitats is more important than isolation time | author=David Tarkhnishvili, Marine Murtskhvaladze, and Alexander Gavashelishvili | journal=Biological Journal of the Linnean Society | year=2013 | volume=109 | issue=4 | pages=876–892 | doi=10.1111/bij.12092 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Marine organisms ====
It is widely thought that parapatric speciation is far more common in oceanic species due to the low probability of the presence of full geographic barriers (required in allopatry).&lt;ref name="Briggs"&gt;{{Citation |title=Modes of Speciation: Marine Indo-West Pacific | author=John C. Briggs | journal=Bulletin of Marine Science | year=1999 | volume=65 | issue=3 | pages=645–656 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous studies conducted have documented parapatric speciation in marine organisms.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3564">In [[mathematical logic]], the '''primitive recursive functionals''' are a generalization of [[primitive recursive functions]] into higher [[type theory]]. They consist of a collection of functions in all pure finite types.

The primitive recursive functionals are important in [[proof theory]] and [[constructive mathematics]] They are a central part of the [[Dialectica interpretation]] of intuitionistic arithmetic developed by [[Kurt Gödel]].

In [[recursion theory]], the primitive recursive functionals are an example of higher-type computability, as primitive recursive functions are examples of Turing computability.

== Background ==

Every primitive recursive functional has a type, which tells what kind of inputs it takes and what kind of output it produces. An object of type 0 is simply a natural number; it can also be viewed as a constant function that takes no input and returns an output in the set '''N''' of natural numbers.

For any two types σ and τ, the type σ→τ represents a function that takes an input of type σ and returns an output of type τ. Thus the function ''f''(''n'') = ''n''+1 is of type 0→0. The types (0→0)→0 and 0→(0→0) are different; by convention, the notation 0→0→0 refers to 0→(0→0). In the jargon of type theory, objects of type 0→0 are called ''functions'' and objects that take inputs of type other than 0 are called ''functionals''.

For any two types  σ and τ, the type σ×τ represents an ordered pair, the first element of which has type σ and the second element of which has type τ. For example, consider the functional ''A'' takes as inputs a function ''f'' from '''N''' to '''N''', and a natural number ''n'', and returns ''f''(''n''). Then ''A'' has type (0 × (0→0))→0.  This type can also be written as 0→(0→0)→0, by [[Currying]].

The set of (pure) ''finite types'' is the smallest collection of types that includes 0 and is closed under the operations of × and →. A superscript is used to indicate that a variable ''x''&lt;sup&gt;τ&lt;/sup&gt; is assumed to have a certain type τ; the superscript may be omitted when the type is clear from context.

== Definition ==

The primitive recursive functionals are the smallest collection of objects of finite type such that:
* The constant function ''f''(''n'') = 0 is a primitive recursive functional
* The successor function ''g''(''n'') = ''n'' + 1 is a primitive recursive functional
* For any type σ×τ, the functional K(''x''&lt;sup&gt;σ&lt;/sup&gt;, ''y''&lt;sup&gt;τ&lt;/sup&gt;) = ''x'' is a primitive recursive functional
* For any types ρ, σ, τ, the functional
*::S(''r''&lt;sup&gt;ρ→σ→τ&lt;/sup&gt;,''s''&lt;sup&gt;ρ→σ&lt;/sup&gt;, ''t''&lt;sup&gt;ρ&lt;/sup&gt;) = (''r''(''t''))(''s''(''t''))
*:is a primitive recursive functional

Prostitution occurs in a variety of forms, and [[prostitution law|its legal status]] varies from [[Prostitution by country|country to country]] (sometimes from region to region within a given country), ranging from being permissible but unregulated, to an enforced or unenforced crime, or a regulated profession. It is one branch of the [[sex industry]], along with [[pornography]], [[Stripper|stripping]], and [[Erotic dance|erotic dancing]]. [[Brothel]]s are establishments specifically dedicated to prostitution. In [[Escort agency|escort prostitution]], the act may take place at the client's residence or hotel room (referred to as out-call), or at the escort's residence or a hotel room rented for the occasion by the escort (in-call). Another form is [[street prostitution]]. Although the majority of prostitutes are female and have male clients, a prostitute can be, and have clients of, any [[gender]] or [[sexual orientation]]. 

There are about 42 million prostitutes in the world, living all over the world (though most of Central Asia, the Middle East and Africa lacks data, studied countries in that large region rank as top [[sex tourism]] destinations).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/there-are-42-million-prostitutes-in-the-world-and-heres-where-they-live-2012-1|title=There Are 42 Million Prostitutes In The World, And Here's Where They Live|author=Gus Lubin|date=17 January 2012|website=Business Insider|accessdate=14 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates place the annual revenue generated by prostitution worldwide to be over $100 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.havocscope.com/activities/prostitution/| title= Prostitution Market Value| accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology and terminology ==
[[File:EN BESKYTTERINDE AF INDUSTRIEN.gif|thumb|Prostitute c.1890]]

''Prostitute'' is derived from the [[Latin]] ''prostituta''. Some sources cite the verb as a composition of "''pro''" meaning "up front" or "forward" and "''stituere''", defined as "to offer up for sale".{{sfn|Perkins|Lovejoy|2007|pp=2–3}} Another explanation is that ''prostituta'' is a composition of ''pro'' and ''statuere'' (to cause to stand, to station, place erect). A literal translation therefore is: "to put up front for sale" or "to place forward". The ''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]'' states, "The notion of 'sex for hire' is not inherent in the etymology, which rather suggests one 'exposed to lust' or sex 'indiscriminately offered.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=prostitute&amp;searchmode=none |title=''prostitute'' |publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=26 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/ |title=Perseus Digital Library |publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu |accessdate=26 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''prostitute'' was then carried down through various languages to the present-day Western society. Most [[sex worker activists]] groups reject the word ''prostitute'' and since the late 1970s have used the term ''sex worker'' instead. However, ''sex worker'' can also mean anyone who works within the sex industry or whose work is of a sexual nature and is not limited solely to prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sex%20worker |title=''sex worker'' |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=13 August 2010 |accessdate=26 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1146/annurev-soc-070308-120025|title = Sociology of Sex Work| journal=Annual Review of Sociology| volume=35| pages=213–234|year = 2009|last1 = Weitzer|first1 = Ronald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dirck van Baburen - The Procuress - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|''[[The Procuress (Dirck van Baburen)|The Procuress]]'' by [[Dirck van Baburen]] (1622)]]

A variety of terms are used for those who engage in prostitution, some of which distinguish between different types of prostitution or imply a value judgment about them. Common alternatives for ''prostitute'' include ''[[Escort agency|escort]]'' and ''whore''; however, not all professional escorts are prostitutes.

The English word ''whore'' derives from the [[Old English]] word ''hōra'', from the [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] ''*hōrōn'' (prostitute), which derives from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] [[Proto-Indo-European root|root]] ''*keh₂-'' meaning "desire", a root which has also given us Latin ''cārus'' (dear), whence the French ''cher'' (dear, expensive) and the Latin ''cāritās'' (love, charity). Use of the word ''whore'' is widely considered [[pejorative]], especially in its modern slang form of ''ho''. In Germany, however, most prostitutes' organizations deliberately use the word ''Hure'' (whore) since they feel that ''prostitute'' is a bureaucratic term.  Those seeking to remove the social stigma associated with prostitution often promote terminology such as ''[[sex worker]]'', ''commercial sex worker'' (CSW) or ''sex trade worker''.  Another commonly used word for a prostitute is ''hooker''. Although a popular etymology connects "hooker" with [[Joseph Hooker]], a Union general in the [[American Civil War]], the word more likely comes from the concentration of prostitutes around the shipyards and ferry terminal of the [[Corlear's Hook]] area of [[Manhattan]] in the 1820s, who came to be referred to as "hookers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AmericanHeritage.com / History Now |url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2006/1/2006_1_15.shtml |date=21 May 2006 |accessdate=22 December 2014 |deadurl= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060521101352/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2006/1/2006_1_15.shtml |archivedate=21 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''streetwalker'' solicits customers on the streets or in public places, while a ''[[call girl]]'' makes appointments by phone, or in recent years, through email or the internet.

Correctly or not, use of the word ''prostitute'' without specifying a sex may commonly be assumed to be female; compound terms such as ''[[male prostitution]]'' or ''male escort'' are therefore often used to identify males.  Those offering services to female customers are commonly known as ''gigolos''; those offering services to male customers are ''hustlers'' or ''rent boys''.

===Procuring===
{{main|Procuring (prostitution)}}
Organizers of prostitution may be known as ''[[pimp]]s'' (if male) and ''[[madam]]s'' or ''[[Mama-san]]'' (if female). More formally, one who is said to practice procuring is a ''procurer'', or ''procuress''.

===Clients===
{{Redirect|Mongering|those who monger|Monger (disambiguation)}}
Clients of prostitutes, most often men by [[prevalence]], are sometimes known as ''johns'' or ''tricks'' in North America and ''punters'' in the [[British Isles]]. These slang terms are used among both prostitutes and law enforcement for persons who solicit prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forum.myredbook.com/dcforum2/DCForumID15/2.html |title=Adult Industry Terms and Acronyms |publisher=Forum.myredbook.com |accessdate=23 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209113009/http://forum.myredbook.com/dcforum2/DCForumID15/2.html |archivedate=9 February 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''john'' may have originated from the frequent customer practice of giving one's name as "John", a common name in [[English language|English-speaking]] countries, in an effort to maintain anonymity. In some places, men who drive around [[red-light district]]s for the purpose of soliciting prostitutes are also known as ''[[kerb crawler]]s''.

Female clients of prostitutes are sometimes referred to as ''janes'' or ''sugar mamas''.&lt;ref name="janes1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="janes2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sm1" /&gt;

=== Other meanings ===
The word "prostitution" can also be used metaphorically to mean debasing oneself or working towards an unworthy cause or "selling out".&lt;ref name="education.yahoo.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/prostitution |title=prostitution – Dictionary definition and pronunciation – Yahoo! Education |publisher=Education.yahoo.com |accessdate=23 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323211921/http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/prostitution |archivedate=23 March 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, "prostituting oneself" or "whoring oneself" the services or acts performed are typically not sexual.  For instance, in the book ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'', [[Holden Caulfield]] says of his brother ("D.B."): "Now he's out in Hollywood, D.B., being a prostitute. If there's one thing I hate, it's the movies. Don't even mention them to me." D.B. is not literally a prostitute; Holden feels that his job writing [[B-movie]] screenplays is morally debasing.

The prostitution metaphor, "traditionally used to signify political inconstancy, unreliability, fickleness, a lack of firm values and integrity, and venality, has long been a staple of Russian political rhetoric."&lt;ref name="jspsps-2015"&gt;Riabova, Tatiana and Riabova, Oleg (2015) "Gayromaidan" in Fedor, Julie; Portnov, Andriy; and Umland, Andraes (eds.) ''Journal of Soviet and Post-Soviet Politics and Society: Sociographic Essays on the Post-Soviet Infrastructure for Alternative Healing Practices, Volume 1, Issue 1'' Columbia University Press. [https://books.google.com/books?id=pQCGCwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA105&amp;ots=gYodnAKJhD&amp;dq=trotsky%20political%20prostitute&amp;pg=PA105#v=onepage&amp;q=trotsky%20political%20prostitute&amp;f=false p.105] Accessed: 14 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt; One of the famous insults of [[Leon Trotsky]] made by [[Vladimir Lenin]] was calling him a "political prostitute".&lt;ref name="jspsps-2015"/&gt; [[Leon Trotsky]] used this epithet himself, calling German Social Democracy, at that time "corrupted by [[Karl Kautsky|Kautskianism]]", a "political prostitution disguised by theories".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1920/terrcomm/ch07.htm |title=Terrorism and Communism: Chapter 7, The Working Class and Its Soviet Policy |publisher=Marxists.org |date=1921 |author = Trotsky, Leon|authorlink=Leon Trotsky |accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938, he used the same description for the [[Comintern]], saying that the chief aim of the Bonapartist clique of [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] during the preceding several years "has consisted in proving to the imperialist 'democracies' its wise conservatism and love for order. For the sake of the longed alliance with imperialist democracies [Stalin] has brought the Comintern to the last stages of political prostitution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1938/09/newwar.htm |publisher=Marxists.org |title = New War Flows from Versailles Banditry |author=Trotsky, Leon| authorlink = Leon Trotsky |date = September 1938 |accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides targeting political figures, the term is used in relation to organizations and even small countries, which "have no choice but to sell themselves", because their voice in world affairs is insignificant. In 2007, a Russian caricature depicted the Baltic states as three "ladies of the night", "vying for the attentions of Uncle Sam, since the Russian client has run out of money".&lt;ref name="jspsps-2015"/&gt;

Usage of the "political prostitute" moniker is by no means unique to Russian political lexicon, such as when a ''[[Huffington Post]]'' contributor expressed the opinion that [[Donald J. Trump]] was "prostituting himself to feed his ego and gain power" when he ran for President of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tom-gerdy/winner-or-just-another-po_b_9347740.html |publisher=The Huffington Post |title = Winner or Just Another Political Prostitute? |author=Gerdy, Tom |date = 29 February 2016 |accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sex work researcher and writer Gail Pheterson writes that these metaphorical usages exist because "the term "prostitute" gradually took on a Christian moralist tradition, as being synonymous with debasement of oneself or of others for the purpose of ill-gotten gains".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.2307/466259|jstor=466259|title=The Whore Stigma: Female Dishonor and Male Unworthiness|journal=Social Text|issue=37|pages=39|year=1993|last1=Pheterson|first1=Gail}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Ancient Near East]] along the [[Tigris–Euphrates river system]] there were many shrines and temples or "houses of heaven" dedicated to various [[deities]] documented by the [[Ancient Greek]] historian [[Herodotus]] in ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Herodotus |author-link=Herodotus |title=The Histories |translator-first=A.D. |translator-last=Godley |translator-link=A.

As early as the 18th century BC, ancient [[Babylon|Mesopotamia]] recognized the need to protect women's property rights. In the [[Code of Hammurabi]], provisions were found that addressed inheritance rights of women, including female prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://civilliberty.about.com/od/gendersexuality/tp/History-of-Prostitution.htm |title=History of Prostitution |website=[[About, Inc.]] |date=2 November 2009 |access-date=23 May 2010 |last=Head |first=Tom |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412012601/http://civilliberty.about.com/od/gendersexuality/tp/History-of-Prostitution.htm |archive-date=12 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ancient Hebrew culture ===
According to [[Zohar]] and the [[Alphabet of Ben Sira]], there were four [[angel]]s of [[sacred prostitution]], who mated with [[archangel]] [[Samael]]. They were the queens of the demons [[Lilith]], [[Naamah (demon)|Naamah]], [[Agrat Bat Mahlat]] and [[Eisheth Zenunim]].{{ref}}

They were required to wear distinctive dresses and had to pay taxes. Some similarities have been found between the Greek ''[[hetaera]]'', the Japanese ''[[oiran]]'', and also the Indian ''[[tawaif]]''. Some prostitutes in ancient Greece, such as [[Lais of Corinth|Lais]] were as famous for their company as their beauty, and some of these women charged extraordinary sums for their services.

=== Ancient Rome ===
[[File:Pompeii-wall painting.jpg|thumb|right|[[Fresco]] from the [[Pompeii]] brothel]]

[[Prostitution in ancient Rome]] was legal, public, and widespread. A registered prostitute was called a [[meretrix]] while the unregistered one fell under the broad category '''''prostibulae'''''. There were some commonalities with the Greek system, but as the Empire grew, prostitutes were often foreign [[slavery|slaves]], captured, purchased, or raised for that purpose, sometimes by large-scale "prostitute farmers" who took [[child abandonment|abandoned children]]. Indeed, abandoned children were almost always raised as prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The First Apology (St. Justin Martyr) |url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0126.htm |website=New Advent |accessdate=26 August 2018|quote= But as for us, we have been taught that to expose newly-born children is the part of wicked men; and this we have been taught lest we should do any one an injury, and lest we should sin against God, first, because we see that almost all so exposed (not only the girls, but also the males) are brought up to prostitution.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enslavement into prostitution was sometimes used as a legal punishment against criminal free women. Buyers were allowed to inspect naked men and women for sale in private and there was no stigma attached to the purchase of males by a male aristocrat.

=== Asia ===
According to [[Shia]] Muslims, [[Muhammad]] sanctioned [[Nikah mut‘ah|fixed-term marriage]] – muta'a in Iraq and [[sigheh]] in Iran – which has instead been used as a legitimizing cover for sex workers, in a culture where prostitution is otherwise forbidden.{{sfn|İlkkaracan|2008|p=36}} [[Sunni]] Muslims, who make up the majority of Muslims worldwide, believe the practice of fixed-term marriage was abrogated and ultimately forbidden by either Muhammad, or one of his successors, [[Umar]]. Sunnis regard prostitution as sinful and forbidden.

In the early 17th century, there was widespread male and female prostitution throughout the cities of [[Kyoto]], [[Edo]], and [[Osaka]], Japan. [[Oiran]] were [[courtesan]]s in Japan during the [[Edo period]]. The oiran were considered a type of {{nihongo|''yūjo''|遊女}} "woman of pleasure" or prostitute. Among the oiran, the {{nihongo|''tayū''|太夫}} was considered the highest rank of courtesan available only to the wealthiest and highest ranking men. To entertain their clients, oiran practiced the arts of dance, music, poetry, and calligraphy as well as sexual services, and an educated wit was considered essential for sophisticated conversation. Many became celebrities of their times outside the pleasure districts. Their art and fashions often set trends among wealthy women. The last recorded oiran was in 1761. Although illegal in modern Japan, the definition of prostitution does not extend to a "private agreement" reached between a woman and a man in a [[brothel]]. [[Yoshiwara]] has a large number of [[soapland]]s that began when explicit prostitution in Japan became illegal, where women washed men's bodies. They were originally known as toruko-buro, meaning [[Turkish bath]].

A [[tawaif]] was a [[courtesan]] who catered to the nobility of South Asia, particularly during the era of the [[Mughal Empire]]. These courtesans danced, sang, recited poetry and entertained their suitors at [[mehfil]]s. Like the [[geisha]] tradition in Japan, their main purpose was to professionally entertain their guests, and while sex was often incidental, it was not assured contractually. High-class or the most popular tawaifs could often pick and choose between the best of their suitors. They contributed to music, dance, theatre, film, and the [[Urdu]] literary tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2004/08/11/stories/2004081101090100.htm |title=Mapping cultures |publisher=The Hindu |date=11 August 2004 |accessdate=23 May 2010 |location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the [[Middle Ages]] the definition of a prostitute has been ambiguous, with various secular and canonical organizations defining prostitution in constantly evolving terms. Even though medieval secular authorities created legislation to deal with the phenomenon of prostitution, they rarely attempted to define what a prostitute was because it was deemed unnecessary "to specify exactly who fell into that [specific] category" of a prostitute.&lt;ref name="Rollo-Koster 2002 110"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rollo-Koster|first=Joelle|title=From Prostitutes to Brides of Christ: The Avignonese Repentises in the Late Middle Ages|journal=Journal of Medieval and Early Modern Studies|year=2002|volume=31|issue=1|page=110|doi=10.1215/10829636-32-1-109}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first known definition of prostitution was found in Marseille's thirteenth-century statutes, which included a chapter entitled De meretricibus ("regarding prostitutes").&lt;ref name="Rollo-Koster 2002 110" /&gt; The Marseillais designated prostitutes as "public girls" who, day and night, received two or more men in their house, and as a woman who "did business trading [their bodies], within the confine[s] of a [[brothel]]."{{sfn|Bullough|Brundage|2000|pp=243–260}} A fourteenth-century English tract, Fasciculus Morum, states that the term prostitute (termed '[[meretrix]]' in this document), "must be applied only to those women who give themselves to anyone and will refuse none, and that for monetary gain".{{sfn|Bullough|Brundage|2000|pp=243–260}} In general prostitution was not typically a life-time career choice for women. Women usually alternated their career of prostitution with "petty retailing, and victualing," or only occasionally turning to prostitution in times of great financial need.{{sfn|Roberts|1992|p=65}} Women who became prostitutes often did not have the familial ties or means to protect themselves from the lure of prostitution, and it has been recorded on several occasions that mothers would be charged with prostituting their own daughters in exchange for extra money.{{sfn|Findlen|Fontaine|Osheim|2003|p=98}}
Medieval civilians accepted without question the fact of prostitution, it was necessary part of medieval life.{{sfn|Otis|1985|p=16}} Prostitutes subverted the sexual tendencies of male youth, just by existing. With the establishment of prostitution men were less likely to collectively rape honest women of marriageable and re-marriageable age.{{sfn|Rossiaud|1996|p=32}} This is most clearly demonstrated in [[St. Augustine]]'s claim that "the removal of the institution would bring lust into all aspects of the world."{{sfn|Bullough|Brundage|1994|p=34}} Meaning that without prostitutes to subvert male tendencies, men would go after innocent women instead, thus the prostitutes were actually doing society a favor.

In urban societies there was an erroneous view that prostitution was flourishing more in rural regions rather than in cities, however it has been proven that prostitution was more rampant in cities and large towns.{{sfn|Rossiaud|1996|p=3}} Although there were wandering prostitutes in rural areas who worked according to the calendar of fairs, similar to riding a circuit, in which prostitutes stopped by various towns based on what event was going on at the time, most prostitutes remained in cities. Cities tended to draw more prostitutes due to the sheer size of the population and the institutionalization of prostitution in urban areas which made it more rampant in metropolitan regions.{{sfn|Rossiaud|1996|p=3}} Furthermore, in both urban and rural areas of society, women who did not live under the rule of male authority were more likely to be suspected of prostitution than their oppressed counterparts because of the fear of women who did not fit into a stereotypical category outside of marriage or religious life.{{sfn|Findlen|Fontaine|Osheim|2003|p=98}}
Secular law, like most other aspects of prostitution in the Middle Ages, is difficult to generalize due to the regional variations in attitudes towards prostitution.{{sfn|Karras|1998|pp=13–31}} The global trend of the thirteenth century was toward the development of positive policy on prostitution as laws exiling prostitutes changed towards [[sumptuary laws]] and the confinement of prostitutes to [[red light districts]].{{sfn|Sanger|1859|p=97}}

Sumptuary laws became the regulatory norm for prostitutes and included making [[courtesans]] "wear a shoulder-knot of a particular color as a badge of their calling" to be able to easily distinguish the prostitute from a respectable woman in society.{{sfn|Sanger|1859|p=97}} The color that designated them as prostitutes could vary from different earth tones to yellow, as was usually designated as a color of shame in the Hebrew communities.{{sfn | Knauer | 2002 | pp=95-117}} These laws, however, proved no impediment to wealthier prostitutes because their glamorous appearances were almost indistinguishable from noble women.{{sfn | Knauer | 2002 | p=101}}

Although brothels were still present in most cities and urban centers, and could range from private bordelages run by a procuress from her home to public baths and centers established by municipal legislation, the only centers for prostitution legally allowed were the institutionalized and publicly funded brothels.{{sfnm|Karras|1998|1p=32|Rossiaud|1996|2p=6}} However this did not prevent illegal brothels from thriving. Furthermore, brothels theoretically banned the [[patronage]] of married men and clergy also, but it was sporadically enforced and there is evidence of clergymen present in brawls that were documented in brothels.{{sfn|Rossiaud|1996|p=41}} Thus the clergy were at least present in brothels at some point or another. Brothels also settled the "obsessive fear of the sharing of women" and solved the issue of "collective security."{{sfn|Rossiaud|1996|p=42}} The lives of prostitutes in brothels were not cloistered like that of nuns and "only some lived permanently in the streets assigned to them."{{sfn|Rossiaud|1996|p=43}} Prostitutes were only allowed to practice their trade in the brothel in which they worked.{{sfn|Geremek|2006|p=216}} Brothels were also used to protect prostitutes and their clients through various regulations. For example, the law that "forbid brothel keepers [from] beat[ing] them."{{sfn|Karras|1998|p=106}} However, brothel regulations also hindered prostitutes' lives by forbidding them from having "lovers other than their customers" or from having a favored customer.{{sfn|Karras|1998|p=106}}

Courts showed the conflicting views on the role of prostitutes in secular law as prostitutes could not inherit property, defend themselves in court, or make accusations in court.{{sfn|Bullough|Brundage|1994|p=37}} However, prostitutes were sometimes called upon as witnesses during trial.&lt;{{sfn|Karras|1998|pp=13–107}}

=== 16th–17th centuries ===
By the end of the 15th century attitudes seemed to have begun to harden against prostitution. An outbreak of [[syphilis]] in [[Naples]] 1494 which later swept across Europe, and which may have originated from the [[Columbian Exchange]],&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.livescience.com/history/080114-syphilis-columbus.html Columbus May Have Brought Syphilis to Europe]". [[LiveScience]]. 15 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and the prevalence of other [[Sexually transmitted infection|sexually transmitted diseases]] from the earlier 13th century, may have been causes of this change in attitude. By the early 16th century the association between prostitutes, plague, and contagion emerged, causing brothels and prostitution to be outlawed by secular authority.{{sfn|Otis|1985|p=41}} Furthermore, outlawing brothel-keeping and prostitution was also used to  "strengthen the criminal law" system of the sixteenth-century secular rulers.{{sfn|Otis|1985|p=44}}
[[Canon law]] defined a prostitute as "a promiscuous woman, regardless of financial elements."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=London Commissary Court Act Books|year=1470–1473|publisher=Department of Manuscripts|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prostitute was considered a "whore … who [was] available for the lust of many men," and was most closely associated with promiscuity.{{sfn|Bennett|1989|p=81}}

The Church's stance on prostitution was three-fold: “acceptance of prostitution as an inevitable social fact, condemnation of those profiting from this commerce, and encouragement for the prostitute to [[repent]]."{{sfn|Otis|1985|p=13}} The Church was forced to recognize its inability to remove prostitution from the worldly society, and in the fourteenth century "began to tolerate prostitution as a lesser evil."{{sfnm|Rossiaud|1996|1p=160|Otis|1985|2p=12}} However, prostitutes were to be excluded from the Church as long as they practiced.{{sfn|Bullough|Brundage|1994|p=36}} Around the twelfth century, the idea of prostitute saints took hold, with [[Mary Magdalene]] being one of the most popular saints of the era. The Church used Mary Magdalene's biblical history of being a reformed harlot to encourage prostitutes to repent and mend their ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Karras|first=Ruth|title=Holy Harlots: Prostitute Saints in Medieval Legend|journal=Journal of the History of Sexuality|date=July 1990|volume=1|issue=1|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously, religious houses were established with the purpose of providing asylum and encouraging the reformation of prostitution. 'Magdalene Homes' were particularly popular and peaked especially in the early fourteenth century.{{sfnm|1a1=Bullough|1a2=Brundage|1y=1994|1p=41|2a1=Roberts|2y=1992|2pp=73–4}} Over the course of the Middle Ages, [[popes]] and [[religious communities]] made various attempts to remove prostitution or reform prostitutes, with varying success.{{sfn|Bullough|Brundage|1994|pp=41–42}}

With the advent of the [[Protestant Reformation]], numbers of Southern German towns closed their brothels in an attempt to eradicate prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/History/teaching/protref/women/WR0911.htm|title=L. Roper: Luther on sex, marriage and motherhood. The University of Warwick|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some periods prostitutes had to distinguish themselves by particular signs, sometimes wearing very short hair or no hair at all, or wearing [[veil]]s in societies where other women did not wear them. Ancient codes regulated in this case the crime of a prostitute that dissimulated her profession. In some cultures, prostitutes were the sole women allowed to sing in public or act in theatrical performances.

=== 18th century ===
According to [[Dervish]] Ismail Agha, in the ''Dellâkname-i Dilküşâ,'' the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] archives,{{sfn|Gazali|2001|p=106}}&lt;ref name=Nedim&gt;{{cite book|title=Nedim and the poetics of the Ottoman court|author=Kemal Sılay|isbn=978-1-878318-09-1|publisher=[[Indiana University]]|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Turkish bath]]s, the masseurs were traditionally [[Pederasty#The Middle East|young men]], who helped wash clients by soaping and scrubbing their bodies. They also worked as [[sex workers]].{{sfn|Toledano|2003|p=242 "[Flaubert, January 1850:] Be informed, furthermore, that all of the bath-boys are {{linktext|bardash}}es [male homosexuals]."}} The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] texts describe who they were, their prices, how many times they could bring their customers to [[orgasm]], and the details of their sexual practices.

During the British [[East India Company]]'s [[Company rule in India|rule in India]] in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, it was initially fairly common for British soldiers to engage in inter-ethnic [[prostitution in India]], where they frequently visited local Indian ''[[nautch]]'' dancers.&lt;ref name=Fisher-2007&gt;{{cite journal|title=Excluding and Including "Natives of India": Early-19th-Century British-Indian Race Relations in Britain|first=Michael H.|last=Fisher|journal=Comparative Studies of South Asia, Africa and the Middle East|volume=27|issue=2|year=2007|pages=303–314 [304–5]|doi=10.1215/1089201x-2007-007|ref=harv|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; As British females began arriving in British India in large numbers from the early to mid-19th century, it became increasingly uncommon for British soldiers to visit Indian prostitutes, and [[miscegenation]] was despised altogether after the events of the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]].{{sfn|Beckman|2003|pp=31–33}}

=== 19th century ===
In the 19th century, legalized prostitution became a public controversy as France and then the United Kingdom passed the [[Contagious Diseases Acts]], legislation mandating pelvic examinations for suspected prostitutes. This legislation applied not only to the United Kingdom and France, but also to their overseas colonies. France, instead of trying to outlaw prostitution began to view prostitution as an evil necessary for society to function. France chose to regulate prostitution, introducing a Morals Brigade onto the streets of Paris.{{sfn|Harsin|1985|pp=3, 25}}  A similar situation did in fact exist in the [[Russian Empire]]; prostitutes operating out of government-sanctioned brothels were given yellow internal passports signifying their status and were subjected to weekly physical exams. A major work, ''[[Prostitution, Considered in Its Moral, Social, and Sanitary Aspects]]'', was published by [[William Acton (doctor)|William Acton]] in 1857, which estimated that
the County of London had 80,000 prostitutes and that 1 house in 60 was serving as a brothel.{{Sfn|Gale|p=245}} [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s novel ''[[Resurrection (novel)|Resurrection]]'' describes legal prostitution in 19th-century Russia.

During this period, prostitution was also very prominent in the [[Barbary Coast, San Francisco]] as the population was mainly men, due to the influx from the [[Gold Rush]].{{sfn|Sears|2014| }} One of the more successful madams was [[Belle Cora (Arabella Ryan)|Belle Cora]], who inadvertently got involved in a scandal involving her husband, Charles Cora, shooting US Marshal William H. Richardson.{{sfn|Jensen|2011| }} This led to the rise of new statutes against prostitution, gambling and other activities seen as "immoral".{{sfn|Sears|2014| }}

=== 20th century ===
The leading theorists of Communism opposed prostitution. Communist governments often attempted to repress the practice immediately after obtaining power, although it always persisted. In contemporary Communist countries, it remains illegal but is nonetheless common.{{sfn|Flowers|1998|p=[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FSNB0G7f4CsC&amp;pg=PA169&amp;lpg=PA169&amp;dq=prostitution+in+former+soviet+countries&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vtvOji8f76&amp;sig=t6tNuWtoT4OzR2W5shTCYe1SfWM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwia4520td3aAhUGJ8AKHbOqCKY4ChDoAQhSMAc#v=onepage&amp;q=prostitution%20in%20former%20soviet%20countries&amp;f=false 169]}} The economic decline brought about by the collapse of the Soviet Union led to increased prostitution in many current or former Communist countries.&lt;ref name="Slate Explainer"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wickman|first=Forrest|title="Socialist Whores": What did Karl Marx think of prostitutes?|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2011/11/socialist_whores_what_did_karl_marx_think_of_prostitution_.html|accessdate=5 November 2011|newspaper=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate Magazine]]|date=5 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, prostitution was widely legal in the United States. Prostitution was made illegal in almost all states between 1910 and 1915 largely due to the influence of the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]]. On the other hand, prostitution generated much national revenue in South Korea, hence the military government encouraged [[prostitutes in South Korea for the U.S. military|prostitution for the U.S. military]].&lt;ref name=IBT20130429&gt;{{cite news | first=Palash | last=Ghosh | title=South Korea: A Thriving Sex Industry In A Powerful, Wealthy Super-State | date=29 April 2013 | publisher=[[International Business Times]] | url =http://www.ibtimes.com/south-korea-thriving-sex-industry-powerful-wealthy-super-state-1222647 | accessdate = 21 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=joongang20081030&gt;{{cite news|first=Soo-mee |last=Park |title=Former sex workers in fight for compensation |date=30 October 2008 |publisher=[[Joongang Daily]] |url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2896741 |accessdate=21 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130430220310/http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2896741 |archivedate=30 April 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, the United Kingdom introduced the [[Sexual Offences Act 1956]]. While this law did not criminalise the act of [[prostitution in the United Kingdom]] itself, it prohibited such activities as running a brothel. Soliciting was made illegal by the [[Street Offences Act 1959]]. These laws were partly repealed, and altered, by the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]] and the [[Policing and Crime Act 2009]].

Beginning in the late 1980s, many states in the US increased the penalties for prostitution in cases where the prostitute is knowingly HIV-positive. Penalties for felony prostitution vary, with maximum sentences of typically 10 to 15 years in prison.

[[Sex tourism]] emerged in the late 20th century as a controversial aspect of Western tourism and [[globalization]].

In the 21st century, [[Afghan]]s revived a method of prostituting young boys which is referred to as "[[bacha bazi]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/dancingboys/view/ |title=The Dancing Boys of Afghanistan &amp;#124; FRONTLINE |publisher=PBS |date=20 April 2010 |accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the break up of the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union]], thousands of eastern European women end up as prostitutes in China, Western Europe, Israel, and Turkey every year; some enter the profession willingly, but many are tricked, coerced, or kidnapped, and often experience captivity and violence.&lt;ref&gt;Hornblower, Margot (24 June 2001).

==Islam==
According to [[Shia]] Muslims, Muhammad sanctioned [[Nikah mut‘ah]] (fixed-term marriage, called muta'a in [[Iraq]] and [[sigheh]] in [[Iran]]) which has instead been used as a legitimizing cover for sex workers, in a culture where prostitution is otherwise forbidden.{{sfn|İlkkaracan|2008|p=36}} Some Western writers have argued that mut'ah approximates prostitution.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Medieval Islamic Civilization: L-Z, index|url = https://books.google.com/?id=LaV-IGZ8VKIC&amp;pg=PA647&amp;dq=mutah+prostitution#v=onepage&amp;q=mutah%2520prostitution&amp;f=false|publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis|date = 1 January 2006|isbn = 9780415966924|language = en|first = Josef W.|last = Meri|first2 = Jere L.|last2 = Bacharach}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Nikah misyar&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n4Eye4ilLVkC&amp;pg=PA52 | title=Muslim World: Modern Muslim Societies | publisher=Marshall Cavendish | date=1 September 2010 | accessdate=5 April 2013 | author=Pohl, Florian | pages=52–53| isbn=9780761479277 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Julie Parshall writes that mut'ah is legalised prostitution which has been sanctioned by the Twelver Shia authorities.

"Most of the travelers describe the Shi'i institution of temporary marriage (sigheh) as 'legalized profligacy' and hardly distinguish between temporary marriage and prostitution."&lt;/ref&gt; Religious supporters of mut'ah argue that temporary marriage is different from prostitution for a couple of reasons, including the necessity of [[iddah]] in case the couple have sexual intercourse. It means that if a woman marries a man in this way and has sex, she has to wait for a number of months before marrying again and therefore, a woman cannot marry more than 3 or 4 times in a year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.al-islam.org/shiite-encyclopedia-ahlul-bayt-dilp-team/temporary-marriage-islam-part-6-similarities-and Temporary Marriage in Islam Part 6: Similarities and Differences of Mut’a and Regular Marriage | A Shi'ite Encyclopedia | Books on Islam and Muslims | Al-Islam.org].

== Payments and salaries ==
Prostitutes' salaries and payments fluctuate according to the economic conditions of their respective countries.

=== Attitudes ===
{{Further|Feminist views on prostitution}}

Roughly speaking, the possible attitudes are:
* "Prostitution should be tolerated by society":
** [[decriminalization]]: "prostitution is labor like any other. Sex industry premises should not be subject to any special regulation or laws", the current situation in New Zealand; the laws against operating a brothel, pimping and street prostitution are struck down, but prostitution is hardly regulated at all. Proponents of this view often cite instances of government regulation under legalization that they consider intrusive, demeaning, or violent, but feel that criminalization adversely affects sex workers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sexworkeurope.org/sites/default/files/userfiles/files/join/manbrussels2005.pdf Sex Workers in Europe Manifesto].

The degree of regulation varies very much; for example, in the Netherlands, prostitutes are not required to undergo mandatory health checks (see [[Prostitution in the Netherlands]]), while in [[Nevada]], the regulations are very strict (see [[Prostitution in Nevada]])
* "Prostitution should not be tolerated":
** [[Abolition of prostitution|abolitionism]] (prostitution itself is not prohibited, but most associated activities are illegal, in an attempt to make it more difficult to engage in prostitution, prostitution is heavily discouraged and seen as a social problem): prostitution (the exchange of sexual services for money) is legal, but the surrounding activities such as public [[solicitation]], operating a [[brothel]] and other forms of [[pimp]]ing are prohibited, the current situation in Great Britain and Italy among others;
** [[Abolition of prostitution|neo-abolitionism]] ("prostitution is a form of [[violence against women]], it is a violation of human rights, the clients of the prostitutes exploit the prostitutes"): prostitutes are not prosecuted, but their clients and pimps are, which is the current situation in Sweden, France, Norway and Iceland (in Norway the law is even more strict, forbidding also having sex with a prostitute abroad).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7806760.stm|title=New Norway law bans buying of sex|date=1 January 2009|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[prohibitionism]] (both prostitutes and clients are criminalized and are seen as immoral, they are considered criminals): the prevailing attitude nearly everywhere in the United States, with a few exceptions in some rural [[Nevada]] counties (see [[Prostitution in Nevada]])

In some countries, there is controversy regarding the laws applicable to [[sex work]]. For instance, the legal stance of punishing pimping while keeping sex work legal but "underground" and risky is often denounced as hypocritical; opponents suggest either going the full abolition route and criminalize clients or making sex work a regulated business.

Many countries have sex worker advocacy groups which lobby against criminalization and discrimination of prostitutes.
These groups generally oppose Nevada-style regulation and oversight, stating that prostitution should be treated like other professions. In the United States of America, one such group is [[COYOTE]] (an abbreviation for "Call Off Your Old Tired Ethics") and another is the North American Task Force on Prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bayswan.org/NTFP.html |title=Prostitution: North American Task Force On Prostitution |publisher=Bayswan.org |date= |accessdate=2015-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia the lead sex worker rights organisation is [[Scarlet Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scarletalliance.org.au/ |title=Scarlet Alliance, Australian Sex Workers Association is the national peak sex worker organisation in Australia |publisher=Scarletalliance.org.au |date= |accessdate=2015-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; International [[Sex workers' rights|prostitutes' rights]] organizations include the [[International Committee for Prostitutes' Rights]] and the Network of Sex Work Projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nswp.org/ |title=Global Network of Sex Work Projects &amp;#124; Promoting Health and Human Rights |publisher=Nswp.org |date= |accessdate=2015-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other groups, often with religious backgrounds, focus on offering women a way out of the world of prostitution while not taking a position on the legal question.

Prostitution is a significant issue in feminist thought and activism. Many feminists are opposed to prostitution, which they see as a form of exploitation of women and male dominance over women, and as a practice which is the result of the existing patriarchal societal order. These feminists argue that prostitution has a very negative effect, both on the prostitutes themselves and on society as a whole, as it reinforces stereotypical views about women, who are seen as sex objects which can be used and abused by men. Other feminists hold that prostitution can be a valid choice for the women who choose to engage in it; in this view, prostitution must be differentiated from [[forced prostitution]], and feminists should support sex worker activism against abuses by both the sex industry and the legal system.

In February 2014, the members of the European Parliament voted in a non-binding resolution, (adopted by 343 votes to 139; with 105 abstentions), in favor of the 'Swedish Model' of criminalizing the buying, but not the selling of sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/content/20140221IPR36644/html/Punish-the-client-not-the-prostitute|title=Punish the client, not the prostitute|website=European Parliament|date=2014-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Prostitution law|Prostitution by country}}

The position of prostitution and the law varies widely worldwide, reflecting differing opinions on victimhood and [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]], [[Economic inequality|inequality]], [[gender role]]s, [[gender equality]], ethics and [[morality]], [[free will|freedom of choice]], historical [[social norm]]s, and [[sociology|social costs and benefits]].

Legal themes tend to address four types of issue: victimhood (including potential victimhood), ethics and morality, freedom of choice, and general benefit or harm to society (including harm arising indirectly from matters connected to prostitution).

Prostitution may be considered a form of exploitation (e.g., Sweden, Norway, Iceland, where it is illegal to buy sexual services, but not to sell them — the client commits a crime, but not the prostitute), a legitimate occupation (e.g., Netherlands, Germany, where prostitution is regulated as a profession) or a crime (e.g., many [[Muslim]] countries, where the prostitutes face severe penalties).

The legal status of prostitution varies from country to country, from being legal and considered a [[profession]] to being [[punishable by death]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uri.edu/artsci/wms/hughes/iran.htm |title=Iran – Facts on Trafficking and Prostitution |publisher=Uri.edu |accessdate=23 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008164248/http://www.uri.edu/artsci/wms/hughes/iran.htm |archivedate=8 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some jurisdictions outlaw the act of prostitution (the exchange of sexual services for money); other countries do not prohibit prostitution itself, but ban the activities typically associated with it (soliciting in a public place, operating a brothel, pimping etc.), making it difficult to engage in prostitution without breaking any law; and in a few countries prostitution is legal and [[regulated prostitution|regulated]].

In 1949, the [[UN General Assembly]] adopted a [[Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others|convention]] stating that "prostitution and the accompanying evil of the traffic in persons for the purpose of prostitution are incompatible with the dignity and worth of the human person",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/trafficpersons.htm |title=Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others |publisher=.ohchr.org |accessdate=26 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508080409/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/trafficpersons.htm |archivedate=8 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; requiring all signing parties to punish pimps and brothel owners and operators and to abolish all special treatment or registration of prostitutes. As of January 2009, the convention was ratified by 95 member nations including France, Spain, Italy, Denmark, and not ratified by another 97 member nations including Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States.

=== Advertising ===

In countries where prostitution is legal, advertising it may be legal (as in the [[Prostitution in the Netherlands|Netherlands]]) or illegal (as in [[Prostitution in India|India]]).
Covert advertising for prostitution can take a number of forms:
* by cards in newsagents' windows
* by cards placed in public telephone enclosures: so-called [[tart card]]s
* by euphemistic advertisements in regular magazines and newspapers (for instance, talking of "massages" or "relaxation")
* in specialist [[contact magazine]]s
* via the [[World Wide Web|Internet]]

In the United States, [[massage parlor]]s serving as a cover for prostitution may advertise "full service", a euphemism for coitus.{{sfn|Rathus|Nevid|Fichner-Rathus|2002| }}

In [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], prostitution is often promoted overtly on the [[Las Vegas Strip]] by third party workers distributing risque flyers with the pictures and phone numbers of escorts (despite the fact that prostitution is illegal in Las Vegas and [[Clark County, Nevada|Clark County]], see [[Prostitution in Nevada]]).

The way in which prostitutes advertise their presence varies widely. Some remain in apartments which have hints or clues outside such as posters with "model" written on them to lure potential customers inside. Others advertise by putting numbers or location in [[phonebox]]es or in online or newspaper ads. In more sexually permissive societies, prostitutes can advertise in public view, such as through display windows. In sexually restrictive societies it may occur through word-of-mouth and other means.{{sfn|Scambler|Scambler|1997|p=1920}}

== Socio-economic issues ==

=== Illegal immigration ===
{{Main|Illegal immigration}}
A difficulty facing migrant prostitutes in many developed countries is the illegal residence status of some of these women. They face potential deportation, and so do not have recourse to the law. Hence there are brothels that may not adhere to the usual legal standards intended to safeguard public health and the safety of the workers.

The immigration status of the persons who sell sexual services is – particularly in Western Europe – a controversial and highly debated political issue. Currently, in most of these countries most prostitutes are immigrants, mainly from Eastern and Central Europe; in Spain and Italy 90% of prostitutes are estimated to be migrants, in Austria 78%, in Switzerland 75%, in Greece 73%, in Norway 70% (according to a 2009 [[TAMPEP]] report, ''Sex Work in Europe-A mapping of the prostitution scene in 25 European countries'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tampep.eu/documents/TAMPEP%202009%20European%20Mapping%20Report.pdf |format=PDF |title=Sex work in Europe |publisher=Tampep.eu |accessdate=2015-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714160224/http://tampep.eu/documents/TAMPEP%202009%20European%20Mapping%20Report.pdf |archivedate=14 July 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
An article in ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'' in 1997 stated that 80% of prostitutes in [[Amsterdam]] were foreigners and 70% had no immigration papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uri.edu/artsci/wms/hughes/netherl.htm |title=Netherlands – Facts on Trafficking and Prostitution |publisher=Uri.edu |accessdate=26 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002222727/http://www.uri.edu/artsci/wms/hughes/netherl.htm |archivedate=2 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Survival sex ===
{{Main|Survival sex}}
Survival sex is when the prostitute is driven to prostitution by a need for basic necessities such as food or shelter. This type of prostitution is common among the [[homeless]] and in [[refugee camp]]s. The term is used in the sex trade and by [[aid workers]], although some practitioners do not regard the act as exploitative.

=== Use of children ===
{{Main|Prostitution of children}}
Regarding the [[prostitution of children]] the laws on prostitution as well as those on sex with a child apply. If prostitution in general is legal there is usually a minimum age requirement for legal prostitution that is higher than the general [[age of consent]] (see above for some examples). Although some countries do not single out patronage of child prostitution as a separate crime, the same act is punishable as sex with an underage person.

In India, the federal police say that around 1.2 million children are believed to be involved in prostitution.&lt;ref name="cnn.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/05/11/india.prostitution.children/index.html | work=CNN | title=Official: More than 1M child prostitutes in India – CNN.com | accessdate=22 May 2010 | date=11 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Central Bureau of Investigation|CBI]] statement said that studies and surveys sponsored by the ministry of women and child development estimated that about 40% of all India's prostitutes are children.&lt;ref name="cnn.com" /&gt;

In Bangladesh, child prostitutes are known to take the drug Oradexon, also known as [[dexamethasone]]. This over-the-counter [[steroid]], usually used by farmers to fatten cattle, makes child prostitutes look larger and older. Charities say that 90% of prostitutes in the country's legalized brothels use the drug. According to social activists, the steroid can cause [[diabetes]], [[high blood pressure]] and is highly addictive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/19/us-bangladesh-prostitution-idUSBRE82I02A20120319 |title=Bangladesh's teenage brothels hold dark steroid secret|publisher=reuters.com|accessdate=20 March 2012|date=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/apr/05/sex-workers-bangladesh-steroid|title=A new danger for sex workers in Bangladesh|publisher=guardian.com|accessdate=20 March 2012|date=5 April 2010|location=London|first=Joanna|last=Moorhead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10173115|title=Bangladesh's dark brothel steroid secret|publisher=bbcnews.com|accessdate=20 March 2012|date=30 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thailand's Health System Research Institute reported that children in prostitution make up 40% of prostitutes in Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unicri.it/wwd/trafficking/minors/docs/dr_thailand.pdf |title=Desk Review: Trafficking in Minors for Commercial Sexual Exploitation; Thailand |format=PDF |accessdate=26 June 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070606235116/http://www.unicri.it/wwd/trafficking/minors/docs/dr_thailand.pdf |archivedate=6 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some adults travel to other countries to have access to sex with children, which is unavailable in their home country.

===Among the elderly===
Prostitution among the elderly is a phenomenon reported in [[South Korea]] where [[elderly]] people turn to prostitution to pay their bills. This problem comes about because the state does not provide enough income for necessities. Clients in Korea tend also to be elderly.&lt;ref&gt;Ng, Desmond (January 29, 2017) [http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asiapacific/granny-prostitutes-reflect-south-korea-s-problem-of-elderly/3475610.html "Granny prostitutes reflect South Korea's problem of elderly poverty"] ''Channel NewsAsia''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Violence ===
{{Main|Violence against prostitutes}}
Street prostitutes are at higher risk of [[violent crime]] than brothel prostitutes and bar prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justicewomen.com/letters_prostitution.html |title=Prostitution Crossroads on Santa Rosa Avenue |publisher=Justicewomen.com |date=2003-04-15 |accessdate=2015-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Carroll|2009|p=527}}

Prostitution may sometimes be associated with illegal, abusive, and dangerous activities.

Sex trafficking is defined as using coercion or force to transport an unwilling person into prostitution or other sexual exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Nick Davies |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/oct/20/trafficking-numbers-women-exaggerated |title=Prostitution and trafficking – the anatomy of a moral panic |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=22 July 2012 |location=London |date=20 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations stated in 2009 that [[sex trafficking]] is the most commonly identified form of human trafficking and estimates that about 79% of human trafficking reported is for prostitution (although the study notes that this may be the result of statistical bias and that sex trafficking tends to receive the most attention and be the most visible).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 2009 UN Report on TIP|url=http://www.unodc.org/documents/Global_Report_on_TIP.pdf|accessdate=29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sex trafficking has been described by Kul Gautum, Deputy Executive Director of [[UNICEF]], as "the largest [[history of slavery|slave trade]] in history."&lt;ref name=bbcnews&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2783655.stm |title=Asia's sex trade is 'slavery' |publisher=BBC News |date=20 February 2003 |accessdate=23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the fastest growing [[organized crime|criminal industry]], predicted to outgrow drug trafficking.&lt;ref name=voa&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.voanews.com/english/news/a-13-2009-05-15-voa30-68815957.html?rss=human+rights+and+law |title=Experts encourage action against sex trafficking |publisher=Voice of America |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501101647/http://www.voanews.com/english/news/a-13-2009-05-15-voa30-68815957.html?rss=human%2Brights%2Band%2Blaw |date=15 May 2009 |archivedate=1 May 2011 |accessdate=26 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ncpc.typepad.com/prevention_works_blog/2006/10/human_trafficki.html|title= Responding to Modern-Day Slavery|accessdate= |website= |date=20 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/2056662.stm|title=Human smuggling eclipses drug trade|publisher=bbcnews.com|date=20 June 2002 |accessdate=30 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there may be a higher number of people involved in [[slavery]] today than at any time in history, the proportion of the population is probably the smallest in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/0901/p16s01-wogi.html |title=Slavery is not dead, just less recognizable |journal=Christian Science Monitor |date=1 September 2004 |accessdate=26 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite news|author=E.

“Annually, according to U.S. Government-sponsored research completed in 2006, approximately 800,000 people are trafficked across national borders, which does not include millions trafficked within their own countries. Approximately 80 percent of transnational victims are women and girls and up to 50 percent are minors," estimated the US Department of State in a 2008 study, in reference to the number of people estimated to be victims of all forms of human trafficking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://womennewsnetwork.net/2008/12/05/lostdaughternepal808/ "Lost Daughters – An Ongoing Tragedy in Nepal"], Women News Network – WNN, 5 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Due in part to the illegal and underground nature of sex trafficking, the actual extent of women and children forced into prostitution is unknown.

Children are sold into the global sex trade every year. Often they are kidnapped or orphaned, and sometimes they are sold by their own families. According to the International Labour Organization, the occurrence is especially common in places such as Thailand, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Cambodia, Nepal and India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecpatusa.org/ |title=End Child Prostitution and Child Pornography and Trafficking of Children for Sexual Purposes |publisher=Ecpat Usa |accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Globally, forced labour generates an estimated $31 billion, about half of it in the industrialised world and around one tenth in transitional countries, according to the [[International Labour Organization]] in a report on forced labour ("A global alliance against forced labour", ILO, 11 May 2005).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ilo.org/public/english/standards/relm/ilc/ilc93/pdf/rep-i-b.pdf |title=A global alliance against forced labour |publisher=International Labour Office |accessdate=26 June 2012 |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trafficking in people has been facilitated by factors such as porous borders and advanced communication technologies, and has become increasingly transnational in scope and highly financially lucrative.

The most common destinations for victims of human trafficking are Thailand, Japan, Israel, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, Turkey and the US, according to a report by the UNODC ([[UN Office on Drugs and Crime]]).&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6497799.stm | work=BBC News | title=UN highlights human trafficking | date=26 March 2007 | accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prostitution, often when it is illegal, is used in [[extortion]] and [[blackmail]], which always involves extortion, where the extortionist threatens to reveal information about a victim or their family members that is potentially embarrassing, socially damaging, or incriminating unless a demand for money, property, or services is met. The subject of the extortion may be manipulated into or voluntarily solicit the use of prostitution which is then later used to extort money or for profit otherwise. The film ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'' famously depicts the role of Senator Geary who is implicated in the use of prostitution in order to gain his compliance on political issues.

=== Street ===
{{Main|Street prostitution}}
In street prostitution, the prostitute solicits customers while waiting at street corners, sometimes called "the track" by [[pimp]]s and prostitutes alike.  They usually dress in skimpy, provocative clothing, regardless of the weather.  Street prostitutes are often called "streetwalkers" while their customers are referred to as "tricks" or "johns." Servicing the customers is described as "turning tricks." The sex is usually performed in the customer's car, in a nearby alley, or in a rented room.  Motels and hotels that accommodate prostitutes commonly rent rooms by the half or full hour.

In Russia and other countries of the [[Soviet Union|former USSR]], prostitution takes the form of an open-air market. One prostitute stands by a roadside, and directs cars to a so-called "tochka" (usually located in alleyways or carparks), where lines of women are paraded for customers in front of their car headlights. The client selects a prostitute, whom he takes away in his car. Prevalent in the late 1990s, this type of service has been steadily declining in recent years.

A "lot lizard" is a commonly encountered special case of street prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://traffickingresourcecenter.org/sites/default/files/Sex%20Trafficking%20at%20Truck%20Stops%20AAG.pdf |title=Sex Trafficking At Truck Stops |format=PDF |publisher=[[Polaris Project]] |website=[[National Human Trafficking Resource Center]] |access-date=12 August 2018 |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lot lizards mainly serve those in the [[Semi-trailer truck|trucking industry]] at [[truck stop]]s and stopping centers. Prostitutes will often proposition [[trucker]]s using a [[CB radio]] from a vehicle parked in the non-commercial section of a truck stop parking lot, communicating through codes based on commercial driving slang, then join the driver in his truck.

=== Brothels ===
{{Main|Brothel|Red-light district}}

[[Brothel]]s are establishments specifically dedicated to prostitution, often confined to special [[red-light district]]s in big cities. Other names for brothels include ''bordello'', ''whorehouse'', ''cathouse'', ''knocking shop'', and ''general houses''. Prostitution also occurs in some [[massage]] [[Massage parlor|parlours]], and in Asian countries in some [[barber]] shops where sexual services may be offered as a secondary function of the premises.

=== Escorts ===
[[File:Phone box prostitute calling cards 1 crop.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tart card]]s in a British [[telephone booth|phone box]] advertising the services of [[call girl]]s]]
{{Main|Call girl|Escort agency}}

Escort services may be distinguished from prostitution or other forms of prostitution in that sexual activities are often not explicitly advertised as necessarily included in these services; rather, payment is often noted as being for an escort's time and companionship only, although there is often an implicit assumption that sexual activities are expected.

In escort prostitution, the act takes place at the customer's residence or hotel room (referred to as out-call), or at the escort's residence or in a hotel room rented for the occasion by the escort (called in-call). The prostitute may be independent or working under the auspices of an [[escort agency]]. Services may be advertised over the Internet, in regional publications, or in local telephone listings.

Use of the Internet by prostitutes and customers is common.{{sfn|Siegel|2007| }} A prostitute may use adult boards or create a website of their own with contact details, such as email addresses. Adult contact sites, chats and on-line communities are also used. This, in turn, has brought increased scrutiny from law enforcement, public officials, and activist groups toward online prostitution. In 2009, [[Craigslist]] came under fire for its role in facilitating online prostitution, and was sued by some 40 US state attorneys general, local prosecutors, and law enforcement officials.

Reviews of the services of individual prostitutes can often be found at various escort review boards worldwide. These [[online forum]]s are used to trade information between potential clients, and also by prostitutes to advertise the various services available. Sex workers, in turn, often use online forums of their own to exchange information on clients, particularly to warn others about dangerous clients.

=== Sex tourism ===
{{Main|Sex tourism|Child sex tourism}}
[[Sex tourism]] is travel for [[sexual intercourse]] with prostitutes or to engage in other sexual activity. The [[World Tourism Organization]], a specialized agency of the United Nations defines sex tourism as "trips organized from within the tourism sector, or from outside this sector but using its structures and networks, with the primary purpose of effecting a commercial sexual relationship by the tourist with residents at the destination".&lt;ref name="WTO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-tourism.org/protect_children/statements/wto_a.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061010061925/http://www.world-tourism.org/protect_children/statements/wto_a.htm|title=WTO Statement on the Prevention of Organised Sex Tourism|archive-date=10 October 2006|date=22 October 1995|publisher=World Tourism Organization|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As opposed to regular sex tourism, which is often legal, a tourist who has sex with a [[Prostitution of children|child prostitute]] will usually be committing a crime in the host country, under the laws of his own country (notwithstanding him being outside of it) and against international law. Child sex tourism (CST) is defined as a travel to a foreign country for the purpose of engaging in commercially facilitated [[child sexual abuse]].&lt;ref name=deptstate&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/fs/08/112090.htm|title=The Facts About Child Sex Tourism|website=Fact Sheet|publisher= US Dept of State, Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons|date=29 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thailand, Cambodia, India, Brazil, and Mexico have been identified as leading hotspots of child sexual exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=38872 |title=RIGHTS-MEXICO: 16,000 Victims of Child Sexual Exploitation – IPS |publisher=Ipsnews.net |date=13 August 2007 |accessdate=23 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326111520/http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=38872 |archivedate=26 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Virtual sex ===
[[Virtual sex]], that is, sexual acts conveyed by messages rather than physically, is also the subject of commercial transactions. Commercial [[phone sex]] services have been available for decades. The advent of the Internet has made other forms of virtual sex available for money, including computer-mediated [[cybersex]], in which sexual services are provided in text form by way of [[chat room]]s or [[instant messaging]], or audiovisually through a [[webcam]] (see [[camgirl]]).

According to the paper "Estimating the prevalence and career longevity of prostitute women",{{sfn|Potterat|Woodhouse|Muth|Muth|1990| }} the number of full-time equivalent prostitutes in a typical area in the United States (Colorado Springs, CO, during 1970–1988) is estimated at 23 per 100,000 population (0.023%), of which some 4% were under 18. The length of these prostitutes' working careers was estimated at a mean of 5 years. According to a 2012 report by ''Fondation Scelles'' there are between 40 and 42 million prostitutes in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=There Are 42 Million Prostitutes In The World, And Here's Where They Live|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/there-are-42-million-prostitutes-in-the-world-and-heres-where-they-live-2012-1?IR=T|author=Gus Lubin|date=17 January 2012|newspaper=Business Insider|accessdate=4 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, it was estimated that in [[Amsterdam]], one woman in 35 was working as a prostitute, compared to one in 300 in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swissinfo.org/eng/front/Window_ban_for_Zurich_s_prostitutes.html?siteSect=107&amp;sid=1853267&amp;cKey=1052980380000&amp;ty=st |title=Window ban for Zurich's prostitutes |publisher=swissinfo |date=15 May 2003 |accessdate=26 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, a 2004 TNS poll reported 15% of all men admitted to having paid for sex at least once in their life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/News/story?id=156921&amp;page=1|author=Gary Langer, with Cheryl Arnedt and Dalia Sussman|title=Primetime Live Poll: American Sex Survey|publisher=[[ABC News]]|date=21 October 2004|accessdate=28 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a paper entitled "Prostitution and the sex discrepancy in reported number of sexual partners" concluded that men's self-reporting of prostitutes as sexual partners provides a serious underestimate.{{sfn|Brewer|Potterat|Garrett|2000|pp=12385–12388}}

In Australia, a survey conducted in the early 2000s showed that 15.6% of men aged 16–59 reported paying for sex at least once in their life, and 1.9% had done so in the past year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1467-842X.2003.tb00807.x|title=Sex in Australia: Experiences of commercial sex in a representative sample of adults|first5=Anthony M.A.|last5=Smith|first4=Richard O.|last4=Visser|first3=Andrew E.|last3=Grulich|first2=Juliet|year=2003|last2=Richters|last1=Rissel|first1=Chris E.|journal=Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health|volume=27|ref=harv|pmid=14696710|issue=2|pages=191–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports disagree on whether prostitution levels are growing or declining in [[developed countries]]. Some studies indicate that the percentage of men engaging in commercial sex in the United States has declined significantly in recent decades: in 1964, an estimated 69–80% of men had paid for sex at least once.&lt;ref name=ProCon /&gt; Some have suggested that prostitution levels have fallen in sexually liberal countries, most likely because of the increased availability of non-commercial, non-marital sex&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Edlund |first1=Lena |last2=Korn |first2=Evelyn |title=A Theory of Prostitution |journal=Journal of Political Economy |date=February 2002 |volume=110 |issue=1 |pages=181–214 |doi=10.1086/324390 |url=http://www.iies.su.se/seminars/papers/Edlund.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060526010007/http://www.iies.su.se/seminars/papers/Edlund.pdf|archive-date=26 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; or, for example in Sweden, because of stricter legal penalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Skarhead|first=Anna|title=Evaluating the Swedish Ban on the Purchase of Sexual Services: The Anna Skarhed Report|url=http://nppr.se/2010/07/02/evaluating-the-swedish-ban-on-the-purchase-of-sexual-services-the-anna-skarhed-report/|publisher=Nordic Prostitution Policy Reform|accessdate=26 January 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100709082031/http://nppr.se/2010/07/02/evaluating-the-swedish-ban-on-the-purchase-of-sexual-services-the-anna-skarhed-report/|archivedate=9 July 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other reports suggest a growth in prostitution levels, for example in the US,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bennetts|first=Leslie|title=The John Next Door|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2011/07/17/the-growing-demand-for-prostitution.html|website=2011|publisher=The Daily Beast|accessdate=26 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; where again, sexual liberalisation is suggested as the cause. As Norma Ramos, Executive Director of the [[Coalition Against Trafficking in Women]] says "The more the commercial [[sex industry]] normalizes this behavior, the more of this behavior you get".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CATW submission to the OCHR Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women |url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cedaw/docs/cedaw_crc_contributions/CoalitionagainstTraffickinginWomen.pdf|publisher=[[CATW]]|accessdate=26 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prostitutes have long plied their trades to the military in many cultures.  For example, the British naval port of [[Portsmouth]] had a flourishing local sex industry in the 19th century, and until the early 1990s there were large [[red-light district]]s near American military bases in the Philippines. The notorious [[Patpong]] entertainment district in [[Bangkok]], Thailand, started as an [[R&amp;R (military)|R&amp;R]] location for US troops serving in the [[Vietnam War]] in the early 1970s. Washington D.C. itself had [[Murder Bay]] which attracted the military of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. The village of [[Vadia (Banaskantha)|Vadia]], India is known locally as the ''village of prostitutes'', where unmarried women are involved in prostitution. Mass weddings for children of prostitutes in the village are held to protect them from being pushed into prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=In pictures: Mass wedding in India 'prostitute village'|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-17336512|work=BBC|date=March 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medical situation ==
In some places, prostitution may be associated with the spread of [[sexually transmitted diseases]] (STDs). Lack of condom use among prostitutes and their clients has been cited as a factor in the spread of HIV in Asia: "One of the main reasons for the rapid spread of HIV in Asian countries is the massive transmission among sex workers and clients".&lt;ref name=Rojanap /&gt;  As a result, prevention campaigns aimed at increasing condom use by sex workers have been attributed to play a major role in restricting the spread of HIV.&lt;ref name=AVERTHIVSexWorkers&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.avert.org/sex-workers.htm | title = HIV Prevention and Sex Workers | accessdate= 15 September 2009| date = 2015-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the sources for the spread of HIV in Africa is prostitution, with one study finding that encounters with prostitutes produced 84% of new HIV infections in adult males in Accra, Ghana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Côté AM, Sobela F, Dzokoto A |title=Transactional sex is the driving force in the dynamics of HIV in Accra, Ghana |journal=AIDS |volume=18 |issue=6 |pages=917–25 |date=April 2004 |pmid=15060439 |doi= 10.1097/00002030-200404090-00009|url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0269-9370&amp;volume=18&amp;issue=6&amp;spage=917 |ref=harv|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spread of HIV from urban settings to rural areas in Africa has been attributed to the mobility of farmers who visit sex workers in cities, for example in Ethiopia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shabbir I, Larson CP |title=Urban to rural routes of HIV infection spread in Ethiopia |journal=J Trop Med Hyg |volume=98 |issue=5 |pages=338–42 |date=October 1995 |pmid=7563263 |doi= |url= |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some studies of prostitution in urban settings in developing countries, such as Kenya, have stated that prostitution acts as a reservoir of STDs within the general population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=D'Costa LJ, Plummer FA, Bowmer I |title=Prostitutes are a major reservoir of sexually transmitted diseases in Nairobi, Kenya |journal=Sex Transm Dis |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=64–7 |year=1985 |pmid=4002094 |doi= 10.1097/00007435-198504000-00002|url= |ref=harv|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical responses to the problem are:
* banning prostitution completely
* introducing a system of [[Licensure|registration]] for prostitutes that mandates health checks and other public health measures
* educating prostitutes and their clients to encourage the use of [[barrier contraception]] and greater interaction with health care

Some think that the first two measures are counter-productive. Banning prostitution tends to drive it underground, making safe sex promotion, treatment and monitoring more difficult. Registering prostitutes makes the state complicit in prostitution and does not address the health risks of unregistered prostitutes. Both of the last two measures can be viewed as [[harm reduction]] policies.

In countries and areas where safer sex precautions are either unavailable or not practiced for cultural reasons, prostitution is an active disease vector for all STDs, including [[HIV]]/AIDS, but the encouragement of [[safer sex]] practices, combined with regular testing for sexually transmitted diseases, has been very successful when applied consistently. As an example, Thailand's condom program has been largely responsible for the country's progress against the HIV epidemic.&lt;ref name=Rojanap&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rojanapithayakorn W |title=The 100% condom use programme in Asia |journal=Reprod Health Matters |volume=14 |issue=28 |pages=41–52 |date=November 2006 |pmid=17101421 |doi=10.1016/S0968-8080(06)28270-3 |url= |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been estimated that successful implementation of safe sex practices in India "would drive the [HIV] epidemic to extinction" while similar measures could achieve a 50% reduction in Botswana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nagelkerke NJ, Jha P, de Vlas SJ |title=Modelling HIV/AIDS epidemics in Botswana and India: impact of interventions to prevent transmission |journal=Bull.

[[File:Amino acids.png|thumb|220px|Amino acids are necessary nutrients. Present in every cell, they are also precursors to nucleic acids, co-enzymes, hormones, immune response, repair and other molecules essential for life.]] 
'''Proteins''' are essential nutrients for the [[human body]].&lt;ref name=proteinbody/&gt; They are one of the building blocks of body tissue and can also serve as a fuel source. As a fuel, proteins provide as much [[energy density]] as [[carbohydrate]]s: 4 [[Calories|kcal]] (17 [[Joule|kJ]]) per gram; in contrast, [[lipid]]s provide 9 kcal (37 kJ) per gram.  The most important aspect and defining characteristic of protein from a nutritional standpoint is its [[amino acid]] composition.&lt;ref name="DRIProteinChpt" /&gt;

[[Protein]]s are [[polymer]] chains made of [[amino acid]]s linked together by [[peptide bonds]]. During human [[digestion]], proteins are broken down in the stomach to smaller [[polypeptide|polypeptide chains]] via [[hydrochloric acid]] and [[protease]] actions. This is crucial for the [[absorption (small intestine)|absorption]] of the [[essential amino acid]]s that cannot be [[biosynthesis|biosynthesized]] by the body.&lt;ref name=genton&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Genton L, Melzer K, Pichard C | title = Energy and macronutrient requirements for physical fitness in exercising subjects | journal = Clinical Nutrition | volume = 29 | issue = 4 | pages = 413–23 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 20189694 | doi = 10.1016/j.clnu.2010.02.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are nine [[essential amino acids]] which humans must obtain from their diet in order to prevent [[protein-energy malnutrition]] and resulting death. They are [[phenylalanine]], [[valine]], [[threonine]], [[tryptophan]], [[methionine]], [[leucine]], [[isoleucine]], [[lysine]], and [[histidine]].&lt;ref name="DRIProteinChpt" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Young VR | title = Adult amino acid requirements: the case for a major revision in current recommendations | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 124 | issue = 8 Suppl | pages = 1517S-1523S | date = August 1994 | pmid = 8064412 | doi = 10.1093/jn/124.suppl_8.1517S | url = http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/reprint/124/8_Suppl/1517S.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been debate as to whether there are 8 or 9 essential amino acids.&lt;ref&gt;Rosane Oliveira, [http://ucdintegrativemedicine.com/2016/02/the-essentials-part-one/#gs.Sy6ae48 "The Essentials–Part One"], ''UC Davis Integrative Medicine'', Feb 4, 2016. July 12, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The consensus seems to lean towards 9 since [[histidine]] is not synthesized in adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kopple JD, Swendseid ME | title = Evidence that histidine is an essential amino acid in normal and chronically uremic man | journal = The Journal of Clinical Investigation | volume = 55 | issue = 5 | pages = 881–91 | date = May 1975 | pmid = 1123426 | pmc = 301830 | doi = 10.1172/jci108016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are five amino acids which humans are able to synthesize in the body. These five are [[alanine]], [[aspartic acid]], [[asparagine]], [[glutamic acid]] and [[serine]]. There are six conditionally essential amino acids whose synthesis can be limited under special pathophysiological conditions, such as prematurity in the infant or individuals in severe catabolic distress. These six are [[arginine]], [[cysteine]], [[glycine]], [[glutamine]], [[proline]] and [[tyrosine]].&lt;ref name="DRIProteinChpt" /&gt;

Dietary sources of protein include both animals and plants: meats, dairy products, fish and eggs, as well as [[grain]]s, [[legumes]] and [[nut (fruit)|nuts]]. [[Vegans]] can get enough essential amino acids by eating plant proteins.&lt;ref name=nih1&gt;{{cite web|title=Protein in diet|publisher=United States National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health|year=2009|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002467.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protein functions in human body==
Protein is a nutrient needed by the human body for growth and maintenance. Aside from water, proteins are the most abundant kind of molecules in the body. Protein can be found in all cells of the body and is the major structural component of all cells in the body, especially muscle. This also includes body organs, hair and skin. Proteins are also used in membranes, such as [[glycoprotein]]s. When broken down into amino acids, they are used as precursors to [[nucleic acid]], co-enzymes, hormones, immune response, cellular repair, and other molecules essential for life. Additionally, protein is needed to form blood cells.&lt;ref name=proteinbody&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hermann | first = Janice R. | title = Protein and the Body | journal = Oklahoma Cooperative Extension Service, Division of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources • Oklahoma State University | pages = T–3163–1 – T–3163–4 | url = http://pods.dasnr.okstate.edu/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-2473/T-3163web.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DRIProteinChpt" /&gt;

Protein can be found in a wide range of food. The best combination of protein sources depends on the region of the world, access, cost, amino acid types and nutrition balance, as well as acquired tastes. Some foods are high in certain amino acids, but their digestibility and the [[anti-nutritional factor]]s present in these foods make them of limited value in human nutrition. Therefore, one must consider digestibility and secondary nutrition profile such as calories, cholesterol, vitamins and essential mineral density of the protein source.&lt;ref name=vernon&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Young VR, Pellett PL | title = Plant proteins in relation to human protein and amino acid nutrition | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 59 | issue = 5 Suppl | pages = 1203S-1212S | date = May 1994 | pmid = 8172124 | doi = 10.1093/ajcn/59.5.1203s | url = http://www.ajcn.org/content/59/5/1203S.full.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; On a worldwide basis, plant protein foods contribute over 60 percent of the per capita supply of protein, on average. In North America, animal-derived foods contribute about 70 percent of protein sources.&lt;ref name=vernon&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Young VR, Pellett PL | title = Plant proteins in relation to human protein and amino acid nutrition | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 59 | issue = 5 Suppl | pages = 1203S-1212S | date = May 1994 | pmid = 8172124 | doi = 10.1093/ajcn/59.5.1203s | url = http://www.ajcn.org/content/59/5/1203S.full.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meat, products from milk, eggs, [[Soybean|soy]], and fish are sources of [[complete protein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Steinke | first = Waggle | name-list-format = vanc |title=New protein foods in human health: nutrition, prevention and therapy|publisher=CRC Press|year=1992|pages=91–100|isbn=978-0-8493-6904-9|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whole grains and cereals are another source of proteins. However, these tend to be limiting in the amino acid lysine or threonine, which are available in other vegetarian sources and meats. Examples of [[food staple]]s and [[cereal]] sources of protein, each with a concentration greater than 7.0%, are (in no particular order) buckwheat, oats, rye, millet, maize (corn), rice, wheat, sorghum, amaranth, and quinoa.

Vegetarian sources of proteins include legumes, nuts, seeds and fruits. [[Legume]]s, some of which are called [[Pulse (legume)|pulse]]s in certain parts of the world, have higher concentrations of amino acids and are more complete sources of protein than whole grains and cereals. Examples of vegetarian foods with protein concentrations greater than 7 percent include soybeans, lentils, kidney beans, white beans, mung beans, chickpeas, cowpeas, lima beans, pigeon peas, lupines, wing beans, almonds, Brazil nuts, cashews, pecans, walnuts, cotton seeds, pumpkin seeds, hemp seeds, sesame seeds, and sunflower seeds.&lt;ref name=vernon/&gt;

Food staples that are poor sources of protein include roots and tubers such as [[Yam (vegetable)|yams]], [[cassava]] and [[sweet potato]]. [[Plantain (cooking)|Plantain]]s, another major staple, are also a poor source of essential amino acids. Fruits, while rich in other essential nutrients, are another poor source of amino acids. The protein content in roots, tubers and fruits is between 0 and 2 percent. Food staples with low protein content must be complemented with foods with complete, quality protein content for a healthy life, particularly in children for proper development.&lt;ref name=proteinbody/&gt;&lt;ref name=fao85/&gt;&lt;ref name=latham/&gt;

A good source of protein is often a [[protein combining|combination]] of various foods, because different foods are rich in different amino acids. A good source of dietary protein meets two requirements:&lt;ref name=vernon/&gt;
*The requirement for the nutritionally indispensable amino acids (histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine) under all conditions and for conditionally indispensable amino acids (cystine, tyrosine, taurine, glycine, arginine, glutamine, proline) under specific physiological and pathological conditions
*The requirement for nonspecific nitrogen for the synthesis of the nutritionally dispensable amino acids (aspartic acid, asparagine, glutamic acid, alanine, serine) and other physiologically important nitrogen-containing compounds such as nucleic acids, creatine, and porphyrins.

Healthy people eating a balanced diet rarely need protein supplements.&lt;ref name=nih1/&gt;&lt;ref name=vernon/&gt;&lt;ref name=fao85&gt;{{cite book|title=Amino acid content of foods and biological data on proteins (FAO nutritional studies number 24)|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization|year=1985|isbn=92-5-001102-4|url=http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/005/AC854T/AC854T00.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The table below presents the most important food groups as protein sources, from a worldwide perspective. It also lists their respective performance as source of the commonly limiting amino acids, in milligrams of limiting amino acid per gram of total protein in the food source.&lt;ref name=fao85/&gt; The table reiterates the need for a balanced mix of foods to ensure adequate amino acid source.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

[[File:Protein shake.jpg|thumb|Protein milkshakes, made from protein powder (center) and milk (left), are a common [[bodybuilding supplement]].]]
[[Bodybuilding supplement#Protein Sources|Protein powders]] – such as [[casein]], [[whey]], [[Egg (food)|egg]], [[rice]] and [[soy]] – are processed and manufactured sources of protein.&lt;ref name=lemon/&gt; These protein powders may provide an additional source of protein for bodybuilders. The type of protein is important in terms of its influence on protein metabolic response and possibly on the muscle's exercise performance. The different physical and/or chemical properties within the various types of protein may affect the rate of protein digestion. As a result, the amino acid availability and the accumulation of tissue protein is altered because of the various protein metabolic responses.&lt;ref name=lemon/&gt;

==Testing in foods==
The classic [[assays]] for protein concentration in food are the [[Kjeldahl method]] and the [[Dumas method]]. These tests determine the total nitrogen in a sample. The only major component of most food which contains nitrogen is protein (fat, carbohydrate and dietary fiber do not contain nitrogen). If the amount of nitrogen is multiplied by a factor depending on the kinds of protein expected in the food the total protein can be determined. This value is known as the "''crude protein''" content. On food labels the protein is given by the nitrogen multiplied by 6.25, because the average nitrogen content of proteins is about 16%. The Kjeldahl test is typically used because it is the method the [[AOAC International]] has adopted and is therefore used by many food standards agencies around the world, though the Dumas method is also approved by some standards organizations.&lt;ref name="ProtAnaweb"&gt;{{cite web

Accidental [[contamination]] and intentional adulteration of protein meals with [[non-protein nitrogen]] sources that inflate crude protein content measurements have been known to occur in the [[food industry]] for decades. To ensure [[food quality]], purchasers of protein meals routinely conduct [[quality control]] tests designed to detect the most common non-protein nitrogen contaminants, such as [[urea]] and [[ammonium nitrate]].&lt;ref name=USAToday&gt;{{cite news

In at least one segment of the food industry, the dairy industry, some countries (at least the U.S., Australia, France and Hungary) have adopted "''true protein''" measurement, as opposed to crude protein measurement, as the standard for payment and testing: "True protein is a measure of only the proteins in milk, whereas crude protein is a measure of all sources of nitrogen and includes nonprotein nitrogen, such as urea, which has no food value to humans. ... Current milk-testing equipment measures peptide bonds, a direct measure of true protein."&lt;ref name="USDAweb"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://aipl.arsusda.gov/reference/trueprot.htm | vauthors = VanRaden PM, Powell RL | title = Genetic evaluations for true protein | publisher = [[United States Department of Agriculture]] | access-date = 27 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Measuring peptide bonds in grains has also been put into practice in several countries including Canada, the UK, Australia, Russia and Argentina where near-infrared reflectance (NIR) technology, a type of [[infrared spectroscopy]] is used.&lt;ref name=SciAmProt&gt;{{cite news

The testing method for protein in beef cattle feed has grown into a science over the post-war years. The standard text in the United States, ''Nutrient Requirements of Beef Cattle'', has been through eight editions over at least seventy years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nap.edu/catalog/19014/nutrient-requirements-of-beef-cattle-eighth-revised-edition nap.edu: "Nutrient Requirements of Beef Cattle Eighth Revised Edition (2016)"]&lt;/ref&gt; The 1996 sixth edition substituted for the fifth edition's ''crude protein'' the concept of "''[[metabolizeable protein]]''", which was defined around the year 2000 as "the ''true protein'' absorbed by the intestine, supplied by microbial protein and undegraded intake protein".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.uaex.edu/publications/PDF/MP391.pdf uaex.edu: "Beef cattle nutrition series - Part 3: Nutrient Requirement Tables"], University of Arkansas Division of Agriculture publication MP391&lt;/ref&gt;

The limitations of the Kjeldahl method were at the heart of the [[Chinese protein adulteration#Protein testing|Chinese protein export contamination]] in 2007 and the [[2008 China milk scandal]] in which the industrial chemical [[melamine]] was [[2008 Chinese milk scandal#Melamine|added to the milk]] or glutens to increase the measured "protein".&lt;ref name="melamine"&gt;{{cite news|author=Stephen Chen |title=Melamine – an industry staple |pages=Page A2 |work=South China Morning Post |date=18 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Moore |first1=Jeffrey C. |last2=DeVries |first2=Jonathan W. |last3=Lipp |first3=Markus |last4=Griffiths |first4=James C. |last5=Abernethy |first5=Darrell R. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Total Protein Methods and Their Potential Utility to Reduce the Risk of Food Protein Adulteration |journal=Comprehensive Reviews in Food Science and Food Safety |date=17 August 2010 |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=330–357 |doi=10.1111/j.1541-4337.2010.00114.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protein quality===
{{see further|Protein quality|Amino acid score}}
The most important aspect and defining characteristic of protein from a nutritional standpoint is its [[amino acid]] composition.&lt;ref name="DRIProteinChpt" /&gt; There are multiple systems which rate proteins by their usefulness to an organism based on their relative percentage of amino acids and, in some systems, the digestibility of the protein source. They include [[biological value]], [[net protein utilization]], and [[PDCAAS]] (Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acids Score) which was developed by the FDA as a modification of the [[Protein efficiency ratio]] (PER) method. The PDCAAS rating was adopted by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations/[[World Health Organization]] (FAO/WHO) in 1993 as "the preferred 'best'" method to determine protein quality. These organizations have suggested that other methods for evaluating the quality of protein are inferior.&lt;ref name=FAO&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/U5900t/u5900t07.htm Boutrif, E., Food Quality and Consumer Protection Group, Food Policy and Nutrition Division, FAO, Rome: "Recent Developments in Protein Quality Evaluation" ''Food, Nutrition and Agriculture'', Issue 2/3, 1991]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 FAO proposed changing to [[Digestible Indispensable Amino Acid Score]].

==Digestion==
Most proteins are decomposed to single amino acids by digestion in the gastro-intestinal tract.&lt;ref name="mehta"&gt;[http://pharmaxchange.info/press/2013/07/digestion-of-dietary-proteins-in-the-gastro-intestinal-tract-gi-tract/ Digestion of Dietary Proteins in the Gastro-Intestinal Tract]&lt;/ref&gt;

Digestion typically begins in the stomach when [[pepsinogen]] is converted to [[pepsin]] by the action of [[hydrochloric acid]], and continued by [[trypsin]] and [[chymotrypsin]] in the small intestine.&lt;ref name="mehta" /&gt;
Before the absorption in the [[small intestine]], most proteins are already reduced to single amino acid or peptides of several amino acids. Most peptides longer than four amino acids are not absorbed. Absorption into the [[enterocyte|intestinal absorptive cells]] is not the end. There, most of the peptides are broken into single amino acids.

Absorption of the amino acids and their [[Derivative (chemistry)|derivatives]] into which dietary protein is degraded is done by the [[gastrointestinal tract]]. The absorption rates of individual amino acids are highly dependent on the protein source; for example, the digestibilities of many amino acids in humans, the difference between [[soy]] and milk proteins&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gaudichon C, Bos C, Morens C, Petzke KJ, Mariotti F, Everwand J, Benamouzig R, Daré S, Tomé D, Metges CC | title = Ileal losses of nitrogen and amino acids in humans and their importance to the assessment of amino acid requirements | journal = Gastroenterology | volume = 123 | issue = 1 | pages = 50–9 | date = July 2002 | pmid = 12105833 | doi = 10.1053/gast.2002.34233 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and between individual milk proteins, [[beta-lactoglobulin]] and casein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mahé S, Roos N, Benamouzig R, Davin L, Luengo C, Gagnon L, Gaussergès N, Rautureau J, Tomé D | title = Gastrojejunal kinetics and the digestion of [15N]beta-lactoglobulin and casein in humans: the influence of the nature and quantity of the protein | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 63 | issue = 4 | pages = 546–52 | date = April 1996 | pmid = 8599318 | doi = 10.1093/ajcn/63.4.546 | url = http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content/abstract/63/4/546 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For milk proteins, about 50% of the ingested protein is absorbed between the stomach and the [[jejunum]] and 90% is absorbed by the time the digested food reaches the [[ileum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mahé S, Marteau P, Huneau JF, Thuillier F, Tomé D | title = Intestinal nitrogen and electrolyte movements following fermented milk ingestion in man | journal = The British Journal of Nutrition | volume = 71 | issue = 2 | pages = 169–80 | date = February 1994 | pmid = 8142329 | doi = 10.1079/BJN19940124 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Biological value (BV) is a measure of the proportion of absorbed protein from a food which becomes incorporated into the proteins of the organism's body.

=== Newborn ===
[[Newborns]] of [[mammals]] are exceptional in protein digestion and [[assimilation (biology)|assimilation]] in that they can absorb intact proteins at the small intestine. This enables [[passive immunity]], i.e., transfer of immunoglobulins from the mother to the newborn, via milk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hurley WL, Theil PK | title = Perspectives on immunoglobulins in colostrum and milk | journal = Nutrients | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = 442–74 | date = April 2011 | pmid = 22254105 | pmc = 3257684 | doi = 10.3390/nu3040442 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dietary requirements==
[[File:"Eat More Cottage Cheese...You'll Need Less Meat...A Postal Card Will Bring Recipes...Cottage Cheese or Meat^ Ask... - NARA - 512542.jpg|thumb|An education campaign launched by the United States Department of Agriculture about 100 years ago, on cottage cheese as a lower-cost protein substitute for meat.]]
Considerable debate has taken place regarding issues surrounding protein intake requirements.&lt;ref name="IJSNEM"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bilsborough S, Mann N | title = A review of issues of dietary protein intake in humans | journal = International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism | volume = 16 | issue = 2 | pages = 129–52 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16779921 | doi = 10.1123/ijsnem.16.2.129 | url = http://journals.humankinetics.com/doi/abs/10.1123/ijsnem.16.2.129 | access-date = 6 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JACN&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lemon PW | title = Beyond the zone: protein needs of active individuals | journal = Journal of the American College of Nutrition | volume = 19 | issue = 5 Suppl | pages = 513S-521S | date = October 2000 | pmid = 11023001 | doi = 10.1080/07315724.2000.10718974 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of protein required in a person's diet is determined in large part by overall energy intake, the body's need for nitrogen and essential amino acids, body weight and composition, rate of growth in the individual, physical activity level, the individual's energy and carbohydrate intake, and the presence of illness or injury.&lt;ref name=genton/&gt;&lt;ref name=lemon/&gt; Physical activity and exertion as well as enhanced muscular mass increase the need for protein. Requirements are also greater during childhood for growth and development, during pregnancy, or when breastfeeding in order to nourish a baby or when the body needs to recover from malnutrition or trauma or after an operation.&lt;ref name="WHO-TRS"&gt;{{cite web

If not enough energy is taken in through diet, as in the process of [[starvation]], the body will use protein from the muscle mass to meet its energy needs, leading to muscle wasting over time. If the individual does not consume adequate protein in nutrition, then muscle will also waste as more vital cellular processes (e.g., respiration enzymes, blood cells) recycle muscle protein for their own requirements.{{citation needed|reason=Unsubstantiated scientific claim.|date=March 2016}}

==Dietary recommendations==
According to US &amp; Canadian [[Dietary Reference Intake]] guidelines, women aged 19–70 need to consume 46&amp;nbsp;grams of protein per day while men aged 19–70 need to consume 56&amp;nbsp;grams of protein per day to minimize risk of deficiency. These Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) were calculated based on 0.8 grams protein per kilogram body weight and average body weights of 57&amp;nbsp;kg (126 pounds) and 70&amp;nbsp;kg (154 pounds), respectively.&lt;ref name="DRIProteinChpt"&gt;{{citation| title = Dietary Reference Intakes for Energy, Carbohydrate, Fiber, Fat, Fatty Acids, Cholesterol, Protein and Amino Acids| publisher = Institute of Medicine. National Academy Press| year = 2005| url = https://www.nap.edu/read/10490/chapter/12}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this recommendation is based on structural requirements but disregards use of protein for [[energy metabolism]].&lt;ref name=IJSNEM/&gt; This requirement is for a normal sedentary person.&lt;ref name=tarnopolsky&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tarnopolsky MA, Atkinson SA, MacDougall JD, Chesley A, Phillips S, Schwarcz HP | title = Evaluation of protein requirements for trained strength athletes | journal = Journal of Applied Physiology | volume = 73 | issue = 5 | pages = 1986–95 | date = November 1992 | pmid = 1474076 | doi = 10.1152/jappl.1992.73.5.1986 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, average protein consumption is higher than the RDA. According to results of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES 2013-2014), average protein consumption for women ages 20 and older was 69.8 grams and for men 98.3 grams/day.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title = What We Eat in America, NHANES 2013-2014| publisher = U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service | year = 2016| url = https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/80400530/pdf/1314/Table_1_NIN_GEN_13.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Active people===
Several studies have concluded that active people and athletes may require elevated protein intake (compared to 0.8 g/kg) due to increase in muscle mass and sweat losses, as well as need for body repair and energy source.&lt;ref name=IJSNEM/&gt;&lt;ref name=JACN/&gt;&lt;ref name=tarnopolsky/&gt; Suggested amounts vary between 1.6 g/kg and 1.8 g/kg,&lt;ref name=JACN/&gt; while a proposed ''maximum'' daily protein intake would be approximately 25% of energy requirements i.e. approximately 2 to 2.5 g/kg.&lt;ref name=IJSNEM/&gt; However, many questions still remain to be resolved.&lt;ref name=JACN/&gt;

In addition, some have suggested that athletes using [[Calorie restriction|restricted-calorie]] diets for weight loss should further increase their protein consumption, possibly to 1.8–2.0 g/kg, in order to avoid loss of lean muscle mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Phillips SM, Van Loon LJ | title = Dietary protein for athletes: from requirements to optimum adaptation | journal = Journal of Sports Sciences | volume = 29 Suppl 1 | issue = sup1 | pages = S29-38 | date = 2011-01-01 | pmid = 22150425 | doi = 10.1080/02640414.2011.619204 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aerobic exercise protein needs===
Endurance athletes differ from strength-building athletes in that endurance athletes do not build as much muscle mass from training as strength-building athletes do.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Research suggests that individuals performing endurance activity require more protein intake than sedentary individuals so that muscles broken down during endurance workouts can be repaired.&lt;ref name=phillips&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Phillips SM | title = Dietary protein for athletes: from requirements to metabolic advantage | journal = Applied Physiology, Nutrition, and Metabolism = Physiologie Appliquee, Nutrition Et Metabolisme | volume = 31 | issue = 6 | pages = 647–54 | date = December 2006 | pmid = 17213878 | doi = 10.1139/H06-035 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the protein requirement for athletes still remains controversial (for instance see Lamont, Nutrition Research Reviews, pages 142 - 149, 2012), research does show that endurance athletes can benefit from increasing protein intake because the type of exercise endurance athletes participate in still alters the protein metabolism pathway. The overall protein requirement increases because of amino acid oxidation in endurance-trained athletes.&lt;ref name=phillips/&gt; Endurance athletes who exercise over a long period (2–5 hours per training session) use protein as a source of 5–10% of their total energy expended. Therefore, a slight increase in protein intake may be beneficial to endurance athletes by replacing the protein lost in energy expenditure and protein lost in repairing muscles. One review concluded that endurance athletes may increase daily protein intake to a maximum of 1.2–1.4 g per kg body weight.&lt;ref name=lemon&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lemon PW | title = Do athletes need more dietary protein and amino acids? | journal = International Journal of Sport Nutrition | volume = 5 Suppl | pages = S39-61 | date = June 1995 | pmid = 7550257 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anaerobic exercise protein needs===
Research also indicates that individuals performing strength-training activity require more protein than sedentary individuals. Strength-training athletes may increase their daily protein intake to a maximum of 1.4–1.8 g per kg body weight to enhance muscle protein synthesis, or to make up for the loss of amino acid oxidation during exercise. Many athletes maintain a high-protein diet as part of their training. In fact, some athletes who specialize in anaerobic sports (e.g., weightlifting) believe a very high level of protein intake is necessary, and so consume high protein meals and also protein supplements.&lt;ref name=genton/&gt;&lt;ref name=lemon/&gt;&lt;ref name=phillips/&gt;&lt;ref name=IOC&gt;[https://hub.olympic.org/athlete365/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/1378_IOC_NutritionAthleteHandbook_1e.pdf Nutrition for Athletes, International Olympic Committee] Nutrition Working Group of the Medical and Scientific Commission of the International Olympic Committee, Revised and Updated in June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special populations===

====Protein allergies====
{{Main|Food allergy}}
A food allergy is an abnormal [[immune system|immune response]] to proteins in food. The signs and symptoms may range from mild to severe. They may include [[pruritus|itchiness]], swelling of the tongue, vomiting, diarrhea, hives, trouble breathing, or low blood pressure. These symptoms typically occurs within minutes to one hour after exposure. When the symptoms are severe, it is known as [[anaphylaxis]]. The following eight foods are responsible for about 90% of allergic reactions: [[cow's milk]], [[egg as food|eggs]], [[wheat]], [[shellfish]], [[fish]], [[peanut]]s, [[tree nuts]] and [[soybean|soy]].&lt;ref name=NIH2012pdf&gt;{{cite web|author =National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases|title=Food Allergy An Overview|url=https://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/foodAllergy/Documents/foodallergy.pdf|format=pdf|date=July 2012|deadurl=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305145206/http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/foodallergy/documents/foodallergy.pdf|archive-date=2016-03-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Chronic kidney disease ====
While there is no conclusive evidence that a high protein diet can cause [[chronic kidney disease]], there is a consensus that people with this disease should decrease consumption of protein. According to one 2009 review, people with chronic kidney disease who reduce protein consumption have a 32% lower risk of death in comparison to affected people who do not make these dietary changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fouque D, Laville M | title = Low protein diets for chronic kidney disease in non diabetic adults | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 3 | pages = CD001892 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19588328 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD001892.pub3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|reason=Updated version https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30284724|date = December 2018}}&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schwingshackl L, Hoffmann G | title = Comparison of high vs. normal/low protein diets on renal function in subjects without chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = PLOS One | volume = 9 | issue = 5 | pages = e97656 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24852037 | pmc = 4031217 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0097656 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, people with this disease while using a low protein diet (0.6 g/kg/d - 0.8 g/kg/d) may develop [[Metabolism#Amino_acids_and_proteins|metabolic compensations]] that preserve kidney function, although in some people, [[malnutrition]] may occur.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

====Phenylketonuria====
Individuals with [[phenylketonuria]] (PKU) must keep their intake of phenylalanine - an essential amino acid - extremely low to prevent a mental disability and other metabolic complications. Phenylalanine is a component of the artificial sweetener aspartame, so people with PKU need to avoid low calorie beverages and foods with this ingredient.&lt;ref name=NIH2016&gt;{{cite web|title=phenylketonuria|url=https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/phenylketonuria|website=Genetics Home Reference|access-date=12 September 2016|date=September 8, 2016|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160727233812/https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/phenylketonuria|archive-date=27 July 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Maple syrup urine disease====
[[Maple syrup urine disease]] is associated with genetic anomalies in the metabolism of [[branched-chain amino acids]] (BCAAs). They have high blood levels of BCAAs and must severely restrict their intake of BCAAs in order to prevent mental retardation and death. The amino acids in question are leucine, isoleucine and valine. The condition gets its name from the distinctive sweet odor of affected infants' urine. Children of [[Amish]], [[Mennonite]], and Ashkenazi Jewish descent have a high prevalence of this disease compared to other populations.&lt;ref name="DRIProteinChpt" /&gt;

==Excess consumption==
The U.S. and Canadian Dietary Reference Intake review for protein concluded that there was not sufficient evidence to establish a [[Tolerable upper intake level]], i.e., an upper limit for how much protein can be safely consumed.&lt;ref name="DRIProteinChpt" /&gt;

Dietary protein is converted by the digestive process to individual amino acids, which are then absorbed. When amino acids are in excess of needs, the liver takes up the amino acids and [[deamination|deaminates]] them, a process converting the nitrogen from the amino acids into [[ammonia]], further processed in the liver into urea via the [[urea cycle]]. Excretion of urea occurs via the kidneys. Other parts of the amino acid molecules can be converted into [[glucose]] and used for fuel.&lt;ref name=tarnopolsky/&gt;&lt;ref name=absorptionkinetics&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ten Have GA, Engelen MP, Luiking YC, Deutz NE | title = Absorption kinetics of amino acids, peptides, and intact proteins | journal = International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism | volume = 17 Suppl | pages = S23-36 | date = August 2007 | pmid = 18577772 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-495-11657-2"&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Sareen S. | last1 = Gropper | first2 = Jack L. | last2 = Smith | first3 = James L. | last3 = Groff | name-list-format = vanc |title=Advanced nutrition and human metabolism |publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning |location=Belmont, CA |year=2009 |isbn=0-495-11657-2 |oclc= }}&lt;/ref&gt; When food protein intake is periodically high or low, the body tries to keep protein levels at an equilibrium by using the "labile protein reserve" to compensate for daily variations in protein intake. However, unlike body fat as a reserve for future caloric needs, there is no protein storage for future needs.&lt;ref name="DRIProteinChpt" /&gt;

While the report acknowledges research showing that lower intake of red and processed meat is correlated with reduced risk of [[cardiovascular diseases]] in adults, it also notes the value of nutrients provided from these meats. The recommendation is not to limit intake of meats or protein, but rather to monitor and keep within daily limits the sodium (&lt; 2300&amp;nbsp;mg), [[saturated fat]]s (less than 10% of total calories per day), and added sugars (less than 10% of total calories per day) that may be increased as a result of consumption of certain meats and proteins.

'''Quasi-empirical methods''' are [[methodology|methods]] applied in [[science]] and [[mathematics]] to achieve [[epistemology]] similar to that of [[empiricism]] (thus ''[[wikt:quasi-#Prefix|quasi-]] + empirical'') when [[experience]] cannot [[falsifiability|falsify]] the ideas involved. [[Empirical research]] relies on [[empirical evidence]], and its empirical methods involve [[experiment]]ation and disclosure of apparatus for [[reproducibility]], by which scientific findings are [[verification and validation|validated]] by other scientists. Empirical methods are studied extensively in the [[philosophy of science]], but they cannot be used directly in fields whose hypotheses cannot be falsified by real experiment (for example, [[mathematics]], [[philosophy]], [[theology]], and [[ideology]]). Because of such [[empirical limits in science]], the [[scientific method]] must rely not only on empirical methods but sometimes also on quasi-empirical ones. The prefix ''[[wikt:quasi-#Prefix|quasi-]]'' came to denote methods that are "almost" or "socially approximate" an ideal of truly empirical methods.

It is unnecessary to find all counterexamples to a theory; all that is required to disprove a theory logically is one counterexample. The converse does not prove a theory; [[Bayesian inference]] simply makes a theory more likely, by weight of evidence.

One can argue that no science is capable of finding all counter-examples to a theory, therefore, no science is strictly empirical, it's all quasi-empirical. But usually, the term "quasi-empirical" refers to the means of choosing problems to focus on (or ignore), selecting prior work on which to build an argument or proof, notations for informal claims, peer review and acceptance, and incentives to discover, ignore, or correct errors.  These are common to both [[science]] and [[mathematics]], and do not include experimental method.

[[Albert Einstein]]'s discovery of the [[general relativity]] theory relied upon [[thought experiments]] and [[mathematics]]. Empirical methods only became relevant when confirmation was sought. Furthermore, some empirical confirmation was found only some time after the general acceptance of the theory.

Thought experiments are almost standard procedure in [[philosophy]], where a conjecture is tested out in the imagination for possible effects on experience; when these are thought to be implausible,  unlikely to occur, or not actually occurring, then the conjecture may be either rejected or amended.  [[Logical positivism]] was a perhaps extreme version of this practice, though this claim is open to debate.

Post-20th-century [[philosophy of mathematics]] is mostly concerned with [[quasi-empiricism in mathematics|quasi-empirical mathematical methods]], especially as reflected in the actual [[mathematical practice]] of working mathematicians.

'''Reinhard Rudolf Karl Hartmann''' is a [[lexicography|lexicographer]] and [[applied linguistics|applied linguist]]. Until the 1970s, [[lexicographers]] worked in relative isolation, and Hartmann is credited with making a major contribution to lexicography&lt;ref&gt;Robert Burchfield (1989) in the Foreword of the Festschrift issued on the occasion of the 15th anniversary of the Exeter University Language Centre and the 5th of the Dictionary Research Centre as well as Hartmann's 50th birthday, ''Lexicographers and their Works'' ed. by G. James (Volume 14, Exeter Linguistic Studies, University of Exeter Press) p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt; and fostering interdisciplinary consultation between reference specialists.&lt;ref&gt;Terry C. Falla (2005) "A conceptual framework for a new Comprehensive Syriac–English Lexicon" in ''Foundations for Syriac Lexicography: Proceedings of the First International Syriac Language Project Meeting'' ed. by B. Turner (Cambridge: Gorgias Press) p. 65, n. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

R.R.K. Hartmann is co-author of the standard texts ''Dictionary of Language and Linguistics'' (1972) and the ''Dictionary of Lexicography'' (1998); the former has been translated into Chinese, the latter into Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;The Literati Club/Reference Reviews 1999 award for excellence as 'best specialist reference work' was given to the editors of the ''Dictionary of Lexicography''.&lt;/ref&gt; Hartmann has also produced works on a wide range of linguistic and lexicographic topics (see list of Publications below). Two selections of his essays have been published in Kuwait (2004) and Germany (2007).

==Career==
Reinhard Hartmann was born on 8 April 1938 in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]], as the son of Walther and Gerta Hartmann. He obtained a degree at the [[Vienna University of Economics and Business Administration]], where he later wrote a doctoral dissertation on public economy control and auditing, studied at the [[University of Vienna]], where he was awarded a diploma in English translation, and was a postgraduate student at [[Southern Illinois University]], where he received an M.A. in international economics.

In 1964, Hartmann moved to Manchester where he married Lynn Warren and where their children Nasim and Stefan were born. He started his career with an appointment as lecturer in modern languages at the [[University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology]]. This was followed in 1968 by a lectureship in applied linguistics at the [[University of Nottingham]]. From 1974 onwards, Hartmann held senior posts in the Language Centre and the School of English at the [[University of Exeter]], where he also organised a number of influential conferences, such as ''LEXeter ’83'' which led to the creation of the ''European Association of Lexicography'' (EURALEX), the ''International Journal of Lexicography'' and the book series ''Lexicographica Series Maior'' (of which he was one of the co-editors from 1984 to 2008, during which period 134 volumes were published). He attended 12 of the 13 biennial congresses that have been held since 1983, contributing papers at half of them and acting as first secretary and fourth president.&lt;ref&gt;He has been given honorary life membership for his services to EURALEX.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hartmann has also been involved in the founding of AFRILEX (Johannesburg 1995) and ASIALEX (Hong Kong 1997). Other conferences he hosted at Exeter include one on the history of lexicography (Hartmann 1986), which demonstrated that lexicographic traditions differ considerably by dictionary types and languages, and one on lexicography in Africa (Hartmann 1990).  He has acted as a consultant to a number of bodies,&lt;ref&gt;E.g. research councils such as the National Endowment for the Humanities and the British Council, publishers such as Oxford U.P. and Benjamins, and selection panels for conferences such as EURALEX congresses.&lt;/ref&gt; received a number of grants and fellowships to spend time abroad&lt;ref&gt;Visiting fellowships held at the Humanities Research Centre of the ANU in Canberra (1977), the State University of New York at Binghamton (1985), the University of Waterloo (Ontario) Centre for the New OED (1985), the European Translation Centre at Straelen and the Institut fuer deutsche Sprache in Mannheim (1986), the School of English and Linguistics at Macquarie University in Sydney (1994), the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (1997), and the China Foreign Affairs University in Beijing (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; and to participate in various initiatives to promote the discipline.&lt;ref&gt;ERASMUS grant 1990/1991 to start M.A. programmes in lexicography at various universities in Europe; Thematic Network Project in the Area of Languages with a Sub-project on Dictionaries in Language Learning in Europe (Hartmann 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; He also welcomed several visiting scholars for periods at Exeter University.&lt;ref&gt;The list includes Alan Kirkness (New Zealand), Colin Yallop (Australia), Rufus Gouws (South Africa), Olga Karpova (Russia), Alan Turney, Isamu Hayakawa and Masaaki Ohsugi (Japan), Xiaojun Heng and Jianping Wu (China).&lt;/ref&gt; His achievements have been recorded in several international directories,&lt;ref&gt;The ''Linguisten-Handbuch'' (1994), the ''Kenkyusha Biographical Dictionary of English Linguistics and Philology'' (1995), the ''International Who's Who in Translation and Terminology'' (1995), the ''Who's Who in Lexicography'' (1996), and the ''Dictionary of International Biography'' (34th edition 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; and he is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts and of the Chartered Institute of Linguists.

While at Exeter, Hartmann supervised over 45 M.A. and 30 Ph.D. dissertations,&lt;ref&gt;Some of these Exeter postgraduates have moved on to make an impact on their respective specialisms and countries, notably Fred Weeks, Jon Mills, Mersedeh Proctor and Martin Stark (UK), Peter Sharpe (UK and Japan), Gregory James, Philip Benson, Li Lan, Tan Zaixi and Jacqueline Lam (UK and Hong Kong), [[Barbara Kipfer]] (USA), Evanthia Tsiouris and Agapios Oikonomidis (Greece), Ibrahim Al-Besbasi (Libya), Turki Diab (UAE), Nazih Kassis (Israel), Takashi Kanazashi, Kusujiro Miyoshi and Yuri Komuro (Japan), and Young-kuk Jeong (Korea).&lt;/ref&gt; specialising on such aspects as [[dictionary criticism]] (evaluating their many different features), [[dictionary history]] (tracing their varying traditions), [[dictionary typology]] (classifying their different genres), [[dictionary use]] (observing the reference skills needed to access information), [[contrastive linguistics]], [[translation]] and [[bilingual lexicography]].

Upon his retirement in 2001, the Dictionary Research Centre that Hartmann had established at the [[University of Exeter]] was transferred to the [[University of Birmingham]] where he was awarded the title of Honorary Professor of Lexicography in the School of English. Since 2007, Hartmann has been consolidating his various lists of conferences, institutions, dictionary projects, dissertations, and periodicals into an International Directory of Lexicography Institutions.

A '''rest''' is an interval of [[silence]] in a piece of [[music]], marked by a symbol indicating the length of the pause. Each rest symbol and name corresponds with a particular [[note value]] for length, indicating how long the silence should last.

== Description ==
'''Rests''' are intervals of [[silence]] in pieces of [[music]], marked by symbols indicating the length of the pause. Each rest symbol and name corresponds with a particular [[note value]], indicating how long the silence should last, generally as a multiplier of a [[measure (music)|measure]] or [[whole note]].

In instrumental parts, rests of more than one bar in the same meter and key may be indicated with a '''multimeasure rest''' (British English: '''multiple bar rest'''), showing the number of bars of rest, as shown. Multimeasure rests of are usually drawn in one of two ways:
* As long, thick horizontal lines placed on the middle line of the staff, with [[serifs]] at both ends (see above middle picture)&lt;ref name="three" /&gt; or as thick diagonal lines placed between the second and fourth lines of the staff (but this method is much less used than the above method; although a small number of publishers use this method, it most commonly used casually in modern manuscripts),&lt;ref name="two" /&gt; regardless of how many bars' rests it represents;
* The former system of notating multirests (deriving from Baroque notation conventions that were adapted from the old mensural rest system dating from Medieval times) draws multirests according to the picture above right until a certain amount of bar rests is reached when multirests are then drawn to the first method. How long exactly must a multirest be until the above method is used is largely a matter of personal taste, most publishers use ten as the changing point, however bigger and smaller changing points are used, especially in earlier music.&lt;ref name="three" /&gt;

The number of whole-rest lengths for which the multimeasure rest lasts is indicated by a number printed above the musical staff (usually at the same size as the numerals in a time signature).  If a meter or key change occurs during a multimeasure rest, the rest must be broken up as required for clarity, with the change of key and/or meter indicated between the rests. This also applies in the case of  double barlines, which demarcate musical phrases or sections.

=== Dotted rests ===
[[File:YB0110 Silences pointes.png|thumb]]

A rest may also have a [[dotted note|dot]] after it, increasing its [[duration (music)|duration]] by half, but this is less commonly used than with notes, except occasionally in modern music notated in [[compound meter (music)|compound meters]] such as {{music|time|6|8}} or {{music|time|12|8}}. In these meters the long-standing convention has been to indicate one beat of rest as a quarter rest followed by an eighth rest (equivalent to three eighths). See: [[Anacrusis]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4422">The '''SAT Subject Test in Chemistry''' is a one-hour [[multiple choice]] [[Standardized test|test]] given on [[chemistry]] by [[The College Board]]. A student chooses whether to take the test depending upon [[college]] entrance requirements for the schools in which the student is planning to apply. Until 1994, the [[SAT Subject Tests]] were known as '''Achievement Tests'''; until January 2005, they were known as '''SAT IIs'''; they are still well known by the latter name.

==Format==

This test consists of 85 questions. The first 23 questions numbered 1-23 are 'classification questions'. The next 15 questions, numbered 101-115, are called 'relationship analysis questions'. The SAT Subject Test in Chemistry is currently the only SAT that incorporates the relationship analysis questions. Relationship Analysis Questions require the student to identify the [[truth value]] of two statements. If both statements are true, the student will then have to analyze the relationship between the two statements to see if the second statement correctly explains the first statement. The last 47 questions numbered 24-70 are standard multiple choice questions. The [[Metric System]] of measurement is used, rather than [[United States customary units]]. This is widely because students across the world take SAT Subject Tests, not just Americans. Additionally, many chemists and scientists use the Metric System, considering the entire world uses it as well.

==Scoring==

The test has 85 multiple choice questions, each consisting of five answer choices, that are to be answered in one hour. Students receive 1 point for every correct answer, lose ¼ of a point for each incorrect answer, and receive 0 points for questions left blank. This score is then converted to a scaled score of 200-800. The mean score for the 2009 test administrations was 638, [[standard deviation]] 113.&lt;ref name=SATsubjectpercentile&gt;{{cite web |url=http://professionals.collegeboard.com/profdownload/SAT-Subject-Test-Percentile-Ranks-2009.pdf |title=SAT Subject Test Percentile Ranks, 2009 College-Bound Seniors |accessdate=May 12, 2010 |format=[[PDF]] |publisher=[[The College Board]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the mean score was 648 with a standard deviation of 110.

==Preparation==
The College Board's recommended preparation is a one-year college preparatory course in [[chemistry]], a one-year course in [[algebra]], and experience in the laboratory. However, some second-year algebra concepts (including [[logarithms]]) are tested on this subject test. Given the timed nature of the test, one of the keys of the mathematics that appears on the SAT II in Chemistry is not the difficulty, but rather the speed at which it must be completed. Furthermore, the oft-quoted prerequisite{{who?|date=November 2013}} of lab-experience is sometimes unnecessary for the SAT Subject Test in Chemistry due to the nature of the questions concerning experiments; most laboratory concepts can simply be memorized beforehand. Some lab-based questions use diagrams, and thus it is helpful to know what common glassware looks like and how the different pieces are used.

==Difficulty==
Like most of the [[SAT Subject Tests]], the Chemistry SAT Test is relatively difficult. It tests a very wide breadth of content and expects students to formulate answers in a very short period of time. Many high school students find themselves picking up extra resource material, like prep books and [[online]] aids, to help them prepare for the SAT Chemistry test.

While the test is challenging, there are distinctions between the SAT Chemistry Test and the [[AP Chemistry]] exam, which is a more critical-thinking exam that is used not for college admissions but rather for college placement. Still, an AP course in [[Chemistry]] is sufficient preparation for the Chemistry SAT.

==Resources==
The student is not allowed to use notes, textbooks, or a [[calculator]] on this test. The only resource a student may use is a [[periodic table]] which is provided with the test booklet. This table only provides atomic masses, atomic numbers, and symbols for each element.

Sexual violence is a serious public health problem and has a profound short or long-term impact on physical and mental health, such as an increased risk of sexual and [[Reproduction|reproductive]] health problems,&lt;ref&gt;Holmes MM et al. Rape-related pregnancy: estimates and descriptive characteristics from a national sample of women. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, 1996, 175:320–324.&lt;/ref&gt; an increased risk of [[suicide]] or [[HIV]] infection. [[Murder]] occurring either during a [[sexual assault]] or as a result of an [[honor killing]] in response to a sexual assault is also a factor of sexual violence. Though women and girls suffer disproportionately from these aspects,&lt;ref name="icrc.org"/&gt; sexual violence can occur to anybody at any age; it is an act of violence that can be perpetrated by parents, caregivers, acquaintances and strangers, as well as intimate partners. It is rarely a [[crime of passion]], and is rather an aggressive act that frequently aims to express power and dominance over the victim.

Sexual violence remains highly stigmatized in all settings, thus levels of disclosure of the assault vary between regions. In general, it is a widely underreported phenomenon, thus available data tend to underestimate the true scale of the problem. In addition, sexual violence is also a neglected area of research, thus deeper understanding of the issue is imperative in order to promote a coordinated movement against it. [[Domestic violence|Domestic sexual violence]] is distinguished from conflict-related sexual violence.&lt;ref name="Human Security Report 2012"&gt;[Human Security Report (2012), Sexual Violence, Education and War: Beyond the mainstream narrative, Human Security Research Group, Simon Fraser University, Canada, Human Security Press]&lt;/ref&gt; Often, people who coerce their spouses into sexual acts believe their actions are legitimate because they are married. In times of conflict, sexual violence tends to be an inevitable repercussion of warfare trapped in an ongoing cycle of impunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=International Committee of the Red Cross|title=Women and War|year=2008|publisher=ICRC|location=Geneva|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|OCHA|2007|pp=57–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rape of women and of men is often used as a method of warfare ([[war rape]]), as a form of attack on the enemy, typifying the conquest and degradation of its women or men or captured male or female fighters.&lt;ref&gt;Swiss S et al. Violence against women during the Liberian civil conflict. Journal of the American Medical Association, 1998, 279:625–629.&lt;/ref&gt; Even if strongly prohibited by [[Human rights law|IHRL]], [[Custom (law)|Customary law]] and [[International humanitarian law|IHL]], enforcement mechanisms are still fragile or even non-existent in many corners of the world.&lt;ref name="Lindsey 2001 57–61"/&gt;&lt;ref name="icrc.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Physicians for Human Rights 2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Physicians for Human Rights|title=War-related sexual violence in Sierra Leone : a population-based assessment : a report|year=2002|publisher=Physicians for Human Rights|location=Boston, MA|isbn=978-1-879707-37-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs 2007"&gt;{{harvp|OCHA|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
From a historical perspective, sexual violence was considered as only happening to women and as being commonplace and "normal" during both war and peace times from the Ancient Greeks to the 20th century. This led to the negligence of any indications of what the methods, aims and magnitude of such violence was. It took until the end of the 20th century for sexual violence to no longer be considered a minor issue and to gradually become criminalized.

== Definitions ==

===General===
The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) in its 2002 World Report on Violence and Health defined sexual violence as: "any sexual act, attempt to obtain a sexual act, unwanted sexual comments or advances, or acts to traffic, or otherwise directed, against a person's sexuality using coercion, by any person regardless of their relationship to the victim, in any setting, including but not limited to home and work".&lt;ref name="WHO definition"/&gt; WHO's definition of sexual violence includes but is not limited to rape, which is defined as physically forced or otherwise coerced penetration of the [[vulva]] or [[Human anus|anus]], using a [[Human penis|penis]], other body parts or an object. Sexual violence consists in a purposeful action of which the intention is often to inflict severe humiliation on the victim(s) and diminish human dignity. In the case where others are forced to watch acts of sexual violence, such acts aim at intimidating the larger community.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

Other acts incorporated in sexual violence are various forms of [[sexual assault]]s, such as forced contact between mouth and penis, vulva or anus.&lt;ref name="WHO 2002 pp. 147-181"&gt;[WHO (2002), ’Sexual violence’, in World Report in violence and health, Chapter 6, pp. 147-181]&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual violence can include coerced contact between the mouth and penis, vulva or anus, or acts that do not involve physical contact between the victim and the perpetrator—for example, sexual harassment, threats, and peeping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/sv-factsheet.pdf|title=Understanding Sexual Violence|last=|first=|date=2014|website=www.cdc.gov/|publisher=|access-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coercion, with regard to sexual violence, can cover a whole spectrum of degrees of force. Apart from physical force, it may involve [[psychological intimidation]], [[blackmail]] or other threats – for instance, the threat of physical harm, of being dismissed from a job or of not obtaining a job that is sought. It may also occur when the person being attacked is unable to give consent – for instance, while drunk, drugged, asleep or mentally incapable of understanding the situation.

Such broader definitions of sexual violence are found within international law. The [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] (ICC) has established in article 7(1)(g) that "rape, sexual slavery, enforced prostitution, forced pregnancy, enforced sterilization, or any other form of sexual violence of comparable gravity".&lt;ref&gt;[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC), Article 7(g) Crimes against humanity]&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual violence is further explained in the ICC's Elements of Crimes, which the Court uses in its interpretation and application of Article 7. The Elements of Crime establishes that sexual violence is:

*"An act of sexual nature against one or more persons or caused such person or persons to engage in an act of sexual nature by force, or by threat of force or coercion, such as that caused by fear of violence, duress, detention, psychological oppression or abuse of power, against such person or persons or another person, or by taking advantage of a coercive environment or such person’s or persons’ incapacity to give genuine consent."&lt;ref name="icc-cpi.int"/&gt;

The Special Rapporteur on systemic rape sexual slavery and slavery-like practices during armed conflict, in a report in 1998, stipulated that sexual violence is "any violence, physical or psychological, carried out through sexual means by targeting sexuality". This definition encompasses physical as well as psychological attacks aimed at "a person's sexual characteristics, such as forcing a person to strip naked in public, mutilating a person’s genitals, or slicing off a woman’s breasts".&lt;ref name="McDougall 1998"/&gt; The Special Rapporteur’s definition also refers to situations "in which two victims are forced to perform sexual acts on one another or to harm one another in a sexual manner".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{harvp|McDougall|1998|loc=para. 22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A thorough definition is necessary in monitoring the prevalence of sexual violence and studying trends over time. In addition, a consistent definition helps in determining the magnitude of sexual violence and aids in comparing the problem across demographics. Consistency allows researchers to measure risk and protective factors for victimization in a uniform manner. This ultimately informs prevention and intervention efforts.

=== Conflict-related and domestic sexual violence ===
A distinction is made between conflict-related sexual violence and domestic sexual violence:&lt;ref name="Human Security Report 2012"/&gt;

* ''Conflict-related sexual violence'' is sexual violence perpetrated by combatants, including rebels, militias, and government forces. The various forms of sexual violence can be used systematically in conflicts "to torture, injure, extract information, degrade, threaten, intimidate or punish".&lt;ref&gt;[Goetz, Ms. Anne Marie (2008), ’Introduction’ at Wilton Park Conference, Women Targeted or Affected by Armed Conflict: What Role for Military Peacekeepers?, 27–28 May 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual violence can in such cases amount to being a weapon of war. See [[War rape]].
* ''Domestic sexual violence'' is sexual violence perpetrated by intimate partners and by other family/household members, and is often termed ''intimate partner violence.'' This kind of sexual violence is widespread both during conflict and in peacetime. It is commonly believed that incidences of domestic sexual violence increase in wartime and in post-conflict environments.

== Victims ==

===Spectrum===
A spectrum of people can fall victim to sexual violence. This includes women, men and children, but also people who define themselves in other terms, e. g. [[transgender]] individuals.

Most research, reports and studies focus on sexual violence against women and sexual violence in armed conflicts. Mainstream narratives on sexual violence also often depict men as perpetrators and women as victims. Indeed, women suffer disproportionately from sexual violence; however, sexual violence is committed by both men and women, and in peacetime as well as during conflict.&lt;ref name="Sivakumaran, Sandesh 2007 pp. 253-276"&gt;[Sivakumaran, Sandesh (2007), ”Sexual Violence Against Men in Armed Conflict” in European Journal of International Law, Vol. 18, no.2, pp. 253-276]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible for individuals to be targeted based on sexual orientation or gender-exhibiting behavior. Such attacks, which are often called "[[corrective rape]]s" have been performed to conform an individual to a heterosexual orientation or to more accepted notions of behavior for the perceived gender of the victim.

=== Domestic sexual violence ===
{{main|Sexual violence by intimate partners}}

Domestic sexual violence includes all forms of unwanted sexual activity. It is considered abuse even if the victim may have previously engaged in consensual sexual activities with the perpetrator. Men and women can both fall victim to this type of abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, M. and Segal, J. (2013). Domestic Violence and Abuse: Signs of Abuse and Abusive Relationships. HelpGuide.  Available at:{{cite web |url=http://www.helpguide.org/mental/domestic_violence_abuse_types_signs_causes_effects.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131201131946/http://www.helpguide.org/mental/domestic_violence_abuse_types_signs_causes_effects.htm |archivedate=2013-12-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 WHO study on physical and sexual domestic violence against women conducted across ten countries, finds that prevalence of sexual domestic violence ranges on average between 10 and 50%. Domestic sexual violence is also considerably less common than other forms of domestic violence. The variations in the findings across and within countries suggest that this type of abuse is not inevitable and can be prevented.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Moreno, C., Jansen, H. A., Ellsberg, M., Heise, L., &amp; Watts, C. H. (2006). Prevalence of intimate partner violence: findings from the WHO multi-country study on women's health and domestic violence. The Lancet, 368(9543), 1260-1269.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Women ===
Sexual violence against women and girls can take many forms and is carried out in different situations and contexts. The WHO’s World Report on Violence and Health&lt;ref name="WHO 2002 pp. 147-181"/&gt; lists the following ways in which sexual violence against females can be committed: 
* Systematic rape during armed conflict
* Rape within marriage or dating relationships
* Rape by strangers
* Unwanted sexual advances or sexual harassment, including demanding sex in return for favors
* Sexual abuse of mentally or physically disabled people
* Sexual abuse of children
* [[Forced marriage]] or cohabitation, including the [[Child marriage|marriage of children]]
* Denial of the right to use contraception or to adopt other measures to protect against sexually transmitted diseases
* [[Forced abortion]]
* Violent acts against the sexual integrity of women, including [[female genital mutilation]] and obligatory inspection for [[virginity]]
* Forced [[prostitution]] and [[Human trafficking|trafficking of people]] for the purpose of sexual exploitation

There was a study in 1987 that came to a conclusion that women in college have reported being involved in unwanted sex due to men using verbal coercion, physical force, and using alcohol an drugs to intoxicate them. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Speaking of Sexuality|last=Moore|first=Nelwyn|publisher=Oxford University Press, Inc|year=2010|isbn=|location=198 Madison Avenue, New York , New York 10016|pages=524|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual violence is one of the most common and widespread violations to which women are subject in wartime. It also figures among the most traumatic experiences, both emotionally and psychologically, women suffer during conflict. Sexual violence, in particular rape, is often considered as a method of warfare: it is used not only to "torture, injure, extract information, degrade, displace, intimidate, punish or simply destroy," but also as a strategy to destabilize communities and demoralize men.&lt;ref&gt;[ICRC (2008), Women and War, pp. 12-13]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thomas, Katie 2007 pp. 15-16"&gt;[Thomas, Katie (2007), “Sexual violence: weapon of war” in Forced Migration Review, Issue 27, January, pp. 15-16]&lt;/ref&gt; The use of sexual violence as a weapon of war was widespread conflicts such as Rwanda, Sudan, Sierra Leone, and Kosovo.&lt;ref name="Thomas, Katie 2007 pp. 15-16" /&gt;
The perpetrators of female-directed violence in times of conflict are often armed groups and local people.&lt;ref&gt;[Egeland, Jan (2007), “International responses” in Forced Migration Review, Issue 27, January, pp. 8-9]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Men ===
As with sexual violence against women, sexual violence against men can take different forms, and occur in any kind of context, including at home or in the workplace, in prisons and police custody, and during war and in the military.&lt;ref name="WHO 2002 pp. 147-181"/&gt; The practice of sexually assaulting males is not confined to any geographical area of the world or its place of commission, and occurs irrespective of the victim’s age.&lt;ref name="Sivakumaran, Sandesh 2007 pp. 253-276"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Solangon 2012 pp. 417-442"&gt;[Solangon, Sarah and Preeti Patel (2012), “Sexual violence against men in countries affected by armed conflict” in Conflict, Security and Development, 12:4, pp. 417-442]&lt;/ref&gt; The various forms of sexual violence directed against males include rape, enforced sterilization, enforced masturbation, and genital violence. Sexual violence against males also encompasses emasculation, which can take place through "[[Feminization (sociology)|feminization]]" or "homosexualization" of the victim, and the prevention of procreation.&lt;ref name="Sivakumaran, Sandesh 2007 pp. 253-276"/&gt;

Male-directed sexual violence is more significant than is often thought. The scope of such crimes continues, however, to be unknown largely because of poor or a lack of documentation. The under- or non-reporting of sexual violence against males may often be due to fear, confusion, guilt, shame and stigma, or a combination thereof.&lt;ref&gt;[Russell, Wynne (2007), ”Sexual violence against men and boys” in Forced Migration Review, Issue 27, pp. 22-23]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[Sivakuraman, Sandesh (2005), “Male/Male Rape and the ‘Taint’ of Homosexuality” in Human Rights Quarterly, Volume 27, Number 4, November 2005, pp. 1274-1306]&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, men may be reluctant to talk about being victim of crimes of sexual violence. In this regard, the way in which societies construct the notion of masculinity plays a role. Masculinity and victimization may be considered incompatible, in particular in societies where masculinity is equated with the ability to exert power, leading to non-reporting.&lt;ref&gt;[Stanko, Elizabeth A. and Kathy Hobdell (1993), “Assault on Men: Masculinity and Male Victimization” in British Journal of Criminology, 33(3), pp. 400-415]&lt;/ref&gt; The incompatibility between the conventional understanding of masculinity and victimization can arise both with regard to the attack itself and when coping with the consequences of such crimes.&lt;ref&gt;[Mezey, Gillian C. and Michael B. King (2000), “Treatment for Male Victims of Sexual Assault” in G. Mezey and M. B. King (eds.) Male Victims of Sexual Assault]&lt;/ref&gt; Because of under- and non-reporting on sexual violence against men, the little evidence that exists tends to be anecdotal.&lt;ref name="Solangon 2012 pp. 417-442"/&gt;

In the case that sexual violence against males is recognized and reported, it is often categorized as "abuse" or "torture". This is considered a tendency to hide sexual assaults directed at men as something else, and it is believed to contribute to the poor- or lack of reporting of such crimes, and can arise from the belief that sexual violence is a women's issue and that men cannot be victims of sexual assaults.&lt;ref name="Sivakumaran, Sandesh 2007 pp. 253-276"/&gt;

=== Children ===
{{main|Child sexual abuse}}
Sexual violence against children is a form of [[child abuse]]. It includes harassment and rape, as well as the use of children in prostitution or pornography.&lt;ref name="ReferenceUNICEF"&gt;UNICEF(2011)Child protection from violence, exploitation and abuse - Sexual violence against children. Available at: http://www.unicef.org/protection/57929_58006.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;World Congress Against the Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children (1996). Declaration of the Stockholm Convention. Pg. 1. Available at: http://www.csecworldcongress.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual violence is a serious infringement upon a child's rights, and one which can result in significant physical and psychological trauma to the victim.&lt;ref name="ReferenceUNICEF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceOHCHR"&gt;OHCHR (2010). Addressing sexual violence against children. Available at: http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/HRCChildren.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; A 2002 WHO study approximated that 223 million children have been victims to sexual violence involving physical contact.&lt;ref&gt;Global Estimates of Health Consequences due to Violence against Children at note 8, based on estimates by G. Andrews et al., Child sexual abuse, chapter 23 in M. Ezzati et al., (2004) Comparative Quantification of Health Risks: Global and regional burden of disease attributable to selected major risk factors (Geneva, World Health Organization, 2004), vol. 2, pp. 1851-1940, and using data of the Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs for population under 18 years.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, due to the sensitivity of the issue and the tendency of the crime to stay hidden, the true figure is likely to be much higher.&lt;ref name="ReferenceUNICEF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceOHCHR"/&gt;

Girls are more frequent targets for sexual abuse than boys. The WHO study found that 150 million girls were abused compared to 73 million boys. Other sources also conclude that girls face a greater risk of sexual violence, including prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;Pinheiro, P. (2006). Rights of the Child: Report of the Independent Expert for the United Nations Study on Violence Against Children. Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. Pp. 11, 13-14, 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes and factors==

===Explanations===
{{main|Causes of sexual violence|Factors associated with being a victim of sexual violence}}
Explaining sexual violence is complicated by the multiple forms it takes and contexts in which it occurs. There is considerable overlap between forms of sexual violence and [[intimate partner violence]]. There are factors increasing the risk of someone being coerced into sex, factors increasing the risk of an individual person forcing sex on another person, and factors within the social environment including peers and family influencing the likelihood of rape and the reaction to it&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chitiki|first1=Elizabeth|title=Participation in the anti-sexual violence silent protest: a sexual citizenship perspective|date=2018|publisher=Rhodes University|hdl=10962/62916}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Research suggests that the various factors have an [[Behavioral addiction|additive effect]], so that the more factors present, the greater the likelihood of sexual violence. In addition, a particular factor may vary in importance according to the life stage.

=== Risk factors ===

The following are individual risks factors:&lt;ref name="cdc.gov"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/sexualviolence/riskprotectivefactors.html|title=Risk and Protective Factors{{!}}Sexual Violence{{!}}Violence Prevention{{!}}Injury Center{{!}}CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-05-06|date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Alcohol and drug use
* Delinquency
* Empathic deficits
* General aggressiveness and acceptance of violence
* Early sexual initiation
* Coercive sexual fantasies
* Preference for impersonal sex and sexual-risk taking
* Exposure to sexually explicit media
* Hostility towards women
* Adherence to traditional gender role norms
* Hyper-masculinity
* Suicidal behavior
* Prior sexual victimization or perpetration

The following are relationship risk factors:&lt;ref name="cdc.gov"/&gt;

* Family environment characterized by physical violence and conflict
* Childhood history of physical, sexual, or emotional abuse
* Emotionally unsupportive family environment
* Poor parent-child relationships, particularly with fathers
* Association with sexually aggressive, hypermasculine, and delinquent peers
* Involvement in a violent or abusive intimate relationship

The following are community factors:&lt;ref name="cdc.gov"/&gt;

* Poverty
* Lack of employment opportunities
* Lack of institutional support from police and judicial system
* General tolerance of sexual violence within the community
* Weak community sanctions against sexual violence perpetrators

=== Perpetrators ===
There is no stereotypical profile of sexually violent persons. Perpetrators may be coming from various backgrounds, and they may be someone known by the victim like a friend, a family member, an intimate partner, an acquaintance, or they may be a complete stranger.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|WHO|2003|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary motivators behind sexually violent acts are believed to be power and control, and not, as it is widely perceived, a [[sexual desire]]. Sexual violence is rather a violent, aggressive and hostile act aiming to degrade, dominate, humiliate, terrorize and control the victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|WHO|2003|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the reasons for committing sexual violence are that it reassures the offender about his sexual adequacy, it discharges frustration, compensates for feelings of helplessness, and achieves sexual gratification.&lt;ref&gt;Groth AN. (2000). The rapist’s view. In: Burgess AW, ed. Violence through a forensic lens. King of Prussia, PA, Nursing Spectrum.&lt;/ref&gt;

Data on sexually violent men are somewhat limited and heavily biased towards apprehended rapists, except in the United States, where research has also been conducted on male college students. Despite the limited amount of information on sexually violent men, it appears that sexual violence is found in almost all countries (though with differences in prevalence), in all socioeconomic classes and in all age groups from childhood onwards. Data on sexually violent men also show that most direct their acts at women whom they already know.&lt;ref&gt;Heise L, Moore K, Toubia N. Sexual coercion and women's reproductive health: a focus on research. New York, NY, Population Council, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Violence against women: a priority health issue. Geneva, World Health Organization, 1997 (document WHO/FRH/WHD/97.8).&lt;/ref&gt; Among the factors increasing the risk of a man committing rape are those related to attitudes and beliefs, as well as behavior arising from situations and social conditions that provide opportunities and support for abuse.

==Consequences==
Sexual violence is a serious public health problem and it has both short and long term negative physical and psychological effects on health and well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|WHO|2003|loc=Chapter 2: "Sexual violence: prevalence, dynamics and consequences".}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that male and female victims of sexual violence may experience similar mental health, behavioral and social consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Patel V, Andrew G. (2001) Gender, sexual abuse and risk behaviours in adolescents: a cross-sectional survey in schools in Goa. National Medical Journal of India, 14(5):263–67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dube SR et al.

In: Ezzati M, et al., eds. Comparative quantification of health risks: global and regional burden of disease attributable to selected major risk factors. Geneva, World Health Organization.&lt;/ref&gt; Watts, Hossain, and Zimmerman (2013) reported that 72.4% of the victims had at least one gynecological complaint. 52.2% suffered from chronic lower abdominal pain, 27.4% from abnormal vaginal bleeding, 26.6% from infertility, 25.3% from genital sores, and 22.5% from swellings in the abdomen. 18.7% of the participants also suffered from severe psychological and surgical morbidity including alcoholism. 69.4% showed significant psychological distress, 15.8% attempted suicide, 75.6% had at least one surgical complaint. 4.8% of the participants had a positive HIV status.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, C, M. Hossain, C. Zimmerman (2013). In War and Sexual Violence - Mental Health Care for Survivors. The New England Journal of Medicine, 368 (23); 2152-2153&lt;/ref&gt; In child sexual abuse (CSA) cases, the child may suffer mental health disorders that can extend into adult life especially if sexual abuse involved actual intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;Jonas S., Bebbington P., McMans S., Meltzer H., Jenkins R., Kuipers E., Cooper C., King M., Brugha T.

In addition to the above-mentioned outcomes, in some cases victims of sexual violence may also be stigmatized and ostracized by their families and others.&lt;ref&gt;Mollica RF, Son L. Cultural dimensions in the evaluation and treatment of sexual trauma: an overview. Psychiatric Clinics of North America, 1989, 12:363–379.&lt;/ref&gt; Societal perceptions that the victim provoked sexual violence lead to a lack of disclosure of sexual assault which is associated with even more severe psychological consequences, particularly in children.&lt;ref&gt;Ruggiero K.J., Smith D.W., Hanson R.F., Resnick H.S., Saunders B.E., Kilpatrick D.G., Best C.L. (2004) Is Disclosure of Childhood Rape Associated with Mental Health Outcome? Results from the National Women’s Study. Child Maltreat. 9(1):62-77&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, more interventions are needed in order to order to change societal attitudes towards sexual violence as well as efforts designed to educate those to whom the survivors may disclose the assault.&lt;ref&gt;McNally R.J., Bryant R.A., &amp; Ehlers A.

==Treatment==
In the [[emergency room]], emergency [[contraceptive]] medications are offered to women raped by men because about 5% of such rapes result in pregnancy.&lt;ref name=Varcarolis&gt;{{cite book | author = Varcarolis, Elizabeth| year = 2013 | title = Essentials of psychiatric mental health nursing | location = St. Louis | publisher = Elsevier | pages = 439–442}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Preventative healthcare|Preventative]] medication against [[sexually transmitted infection]]s are given to victims of all types of sexual assault (especially for the most common diseases like [[chlamydia infection|chlamydia]], [[gonorhea]], [[trichomoniasis]] and [[bacterial vaginosis]]) and a blood serum is collected to test for STIs (such as [[HIV]], [[hepatitis B]] and [[syphilis]]).&lt;ref name=Varcarolis/&gt; Any survivor with abrasions are immunized for tetanus if 5 years have elapsed since the last immunization.&lt;ref name=Varcarolis/&gt; Short-term treatment with a [[benzodiazepine]] may help with acute anxiety and antidepressants may be helpful for symptoms of [[PTSD]], depression and panic attacks.&lt;ref name=Varcarolis/&gt;

==Prevention==
{{main| Initiatives to prevent sexual violence}}
The number of initiatives addressing sexual violence is limited and few have been evaluated. The approaches vary with most interventions being developed and implemented in industrialized countries. How relevant they may be in other settings is not well known. Early interventions and the provision of psychological support may prevent or minimize many of the harmful and lasting psychological impacts of sexual assault.&lt;ref&gt;Astbury J, and Jewkes R. (in press) Sexual Violence: A Priority Research Area for Women’s Mental Health&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Foa E.B., Davidson J.R.T., Frances A., &amp; Ross R.

(2007) Randomized Controlled Evaluation of an Early Intervention to Prevent Post-Rape Psychopathology. Behav Res Ther. 45(10): 2432-2447&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The interventions that have been developed can be categorized as follows.

There is also a public health approach to prevention. Because sexual violence is widespread and directly or indirectly affects a community as whole, a community-oriented approach encourages not just victims and advocates to spread awareness and prevent sexual violence, but allocates responsibility to wider community to do so as well. The CDC's report on Sexual Violence Prevention: Beginning the Dialogue&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/svprevention-a.pdf|title=Sexual Violence Prevention: Beginning the Dialogue|last=|first=|date=|website=CDC.gov|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests following its four step model.

# Define the Problem: Collect data about the victims, perpetrators, where it's occurring, and how often it's happening. 
# Identify Risk and Protective Factors: Research the risk factors that may put people at risk for victimization of perpetration 
# Develop and Test Prevention Strategies: Work with community leaders, practitioners to test different sexual violence prevention strategies 
# Ensure Widespread Adoption: Implement and spread awareness about the successful prevention strategies

Child sexual abuse prevention programmes were developed in the United States of America during the 1970s and originally delivered to children. Programmes delivered to parents were developed in the 1980s and took the form of one-off meetings, two to three hours long &lt;ref name="Babatsikos"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Babatsikos | first=Georgia | title=Parents' knowledge, attitudes and practices about preventing child sexual abuse: a literature review | journal=Child Abuse Review | volume=19 | issue=2 | year=2010 | issn=0952-9136 | doi=10.1002/car.1102 | pages=107–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hébert"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hébert | first=Martine | last2=Lavoie | first2=Francine | last3=Parent | first3=Nathalie | title=An Assessment of Outcomes Following Parents' Participation in a Child Abuse Prevention Program | journal=Violence and Victims | volume=17 | issue=3 | date=2002-06-01 | issn=0886-6708 | doi=10.1891/vivi.17.3.355.33664 | pages=355–372}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wurtele Moreno Kenny"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Wurtele | first=Sandy K. | last2=Moreno | first2=Tasha | last3=Kenny | first3=Maureen C. | title=Evaluation of a Sexual Abuse Prevention Workshop for Parents of Young Children | journal=Journal of Child &amp; Adolescent Trauma | volume=1 | issue=4 | year=2008 | issn=1936-1521 | doi=10.1080/19361520802505768 | pages=331–340}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wurtele Kenny 2010 pp. 130–152"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Wurtele | first=Sandy K. | last2=Kenny | first2=Maureen C. | title=Partnering with parents to prevent childhood sexual abuse | journal=Child Abuse Review | volume=19 | issue=2 | year=2010 | issn=0952-9136 | doi=10.1002/car.1112 | pages=130–152}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://library.nspcc.org.uk/HeritageScripts/Hapi.dll/filetransfer/2018FourStepsToThePreventionOfCSAInTheHome.pdf?CookieCheck=43313.725224213&amp;filename=AA58F75CEDE68892A73FB681FE246B8371684F102152F0AA780A14959D3BCE5767137B3B2A935011CBAEC3068664FF681AA6D2524E357BAB96C006752CCD756759AD77BD1E389823A55CFAAE74B2EE64F46C611AD1724BE1AC500B025490CCB1CD8D9D26B00674E723A731951BB13FBE2976BA14838E6BBB09A4FA52BE735F27D92CBFED7FA6CFFA88BC073F0228EAA69F4D1FE158D846D5D4DD33F8F3466703AC49AD67CE927D87622D067280EF2A231A479B85D0572EF2AABC4480&amp;DataSetName=LIVEDATA|title=Four Steps to the Prevention of Child Sexual Abuse in the Home|last=Williams|first=Mike|date=2018|website=NSPCC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://library.nspcc.org.uk/HeritageScripts/Hapi.dll/filetransfer/2018WorkingWithACommunityToPreventCSAInTheHome.pdf?filename=AA58F75CEDE68892A73FB681FE246B8371684F102152F0AA780A14959D3BCE5767137B3B2A935011CBAEC3068664FF681AA6D2524E357BAB96C006752CCD756759AD77BD1E389823A55CFAAE74B2EE64F46C611AD1724BE1AC500B025490CCB1CD8D9D26B00674E723A731951BB13FBE2976BA14838E6BBB09A4EB52B96A653DDB0BA5CD78B3E4F0B5A317270E32E79B9F7322E26DEE69E8F9DA1AD4D57D6203CA56A4641A004820ECE9E3EB4F712C3FED9F46CEBCE377C14C55CB2FBCFD7942&amp;DataSetName=LIVEDATA|title=Working with a community to prevent child sexual abuse in the home|last=Williams|first=Mike|date=2018|website=NSPCC|access-date=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In the last 15 years, web-based programmes have been developed.

==Statistics==
{{main| Estimates of sexual violence}}

Sexual violence is a widely underreported phenomenon, therefore available statistics are unlikely to inform about the true scale of the problem. The available data are scanty and fragmented. Police data, for instance, are often incomplete and limited. Data from medico-legal clinics, on the other hand, may be biased towards the more violent incidents of sexual abuse. In addition, the proportion of people who seek medical services for immediate problems related to sexual violence is also relatively small.

Reasons for non-reporting include shame and embarrassment, fear of not being believed, fear of the perpetrator of the crime, fear of the legal process, or disbelief that the police would be able to do anything to help them.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) (1996) Women's Safety Australia 1996, Australian Bureau of Statistics, Canberra&lt;/ref&gt; Men are even more reluctant to report sexual violence due to extreme embarrassment and concerns about opinions of other people, their masculinity and the fact that they were unable to prevent the assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|WHO|2003|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus information about the extent of sexual violence against males is especially limited. Child sexual abuse is also largely underreported. Most of the data comes from asking adults about their past experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews G, Corry J, Slade T, Issakidis C, and Swanston H. (2004) Comparative risk assessment: child sexual abuse. Final report. Geneva, World Health Organization&lt;/ref&gt;[[Image:Table.GIF|600px|right|How rape statistics are formulated and how they correspond to the extent of the problem:]]One of the reasons for non-reporting is that children lack independent access to resources. They normally require the cooperation of one of their parents who may refuse to believe their child, or may, in fact, be the perpetrator.&lt;ref&gt;Cook B, David F, Grant A. (2001) Sexual Violence in Australia. Australian Institute of Criminology Research and Public Policy Series No. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

Data on sexual violence typically come from police, clinical settings, [[nongovernmental organizations]] and [[survey research]]. The relationship between these sources and the global magnitude of the problem of sexual violence may be viewed as corresponding to an [[iceberg]] floating in water (see diagram).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Jewkes R, Abrahams N. The epidemiology of rape and sexual coercion in South Africa: an overview. Social Science and Medicine (in press).&lt;/ref&gt; The small visible tip represents cases reported to police. A larger section may be elucidated through survey research and the work of nongovernmental organizations.

== Culture ==
Sexual violence occurs in all cultures with varying definitions of what constitutes it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rozée|first=Patricia|date=1993|title=Forbidden or forgiven?

It has been reported that victims who attempt resistance or escape from the situation are more likely to be brutalized by the offender,[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3777345/#ref32 32] thereby giving an inflated sense of power to the abuser as was seen in the New Delhi gang rape case of ''Nirbhaya'' in December 2012. It is likely that in patriarchal cultures, any resistance from the woman victim is perceived by the offender as an insult to his “manhood” further provoking him to resort to more violent means to control the victim.

There is a theory that explains sexual violence as socioculturally constructed which disproves the biological framework that suggests sexual violence is a result of a man's sexual urges. This theory looks to prove that sexual violence is a natural behavior that originates from the "biological propensity to reproduce have a net positive effect on the person's (resorting to sexual violence) reproductive success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kalra|first=Gurvinder|last2=Bhugra|first2=Dinesh|date=2013-07-01|title=Sexual violence against women: Understanding cross-cultural intersections|url=http://www.indianjpsychiatry.org/text.asp?2013/55/3/244/117139|journal=Indian Journal of Psychiatry|language=en|volume=55|issue=3|pages=244–9|doi=10.4103/0019-5545.117139|pmc=3777345|pmid=24082244}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sociocultural theory takes into account gender power equations, moral values, male dominance, and attitudes toward violence."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sanday|first=Peggy Reeves|date=1981-10-01|title=The Socio-Cultural Context of Rape: A Cross-Cultural Study|journal=Journal of Social Issues|language=en|volume=37|issue=4|pages=5–27|doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.1981.tb01068.x|issn=1540-4560}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Feminism and sexual violence ==

Feminist scholars and activists have made unique contributions to the discourse on sexual violence against women and men
. They have proposed that the root causes of sexual violence lie in the social structure characterized by severe inequality, in which the male is dominant and the female exploited. Feminists also hold that the weak institutional arrangements in place to address consequences of sexual violence, as well as unfair treatment of the victims (or survivors, an alternatively proposed terminology) are direct reflections of the ways in which society regards men, women and the sexual relations between them. Furthermore, feminist critique has led to a closer convergence between feminism and psychology in the study of sexual violence.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, C. A. (1995). Attitudes toward rape: Feminist and social psychological perspectives (Vol. 8). Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conveying a connection between gender-based sexual violence and concepts of power-seeking and subordination was pioneered in the 1970s and has proven to be very influential. Within this context, rape has been assessed as a foremost tool of intimidation used by men against women.&lt;ref&gt;Brownmiller, S. (1972.). Against our will: men, women and rape. Available at: http://www.susanbrownmiller.com/susanbrownmiller/html/against_our_will.html&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, domestic violence can be viewed as a particularly severe form of patriarchal domination and oppression.&lt;ref&gt;Dobash, R. E., &amp; Dobash, R. (1979). Violence against wives: A case against the patriarchy (pp. 179-206). New York: Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Feminist views on pornography|Feminist interpretation of pornography]] also suggests a link between rape and pornography, by which pornography that degrades, humiliates and exercises violence upon the female body feeds a culture which a culture which validates this kinds of behavior;&lt;ref&gt;Brownmiller, S. (1972.). Let's put pornography back in the closet. Available at: http://www.susanbrownmiller.com/susanbrownmiller/html/antiporno.html.&lt;/ref&gt; however, there is little evidence to prove this.

An intersection of Marxist and feminist theories has been utilized to offer additional insight to the topic of sexual violence.  According to this argument, labor and sex are analogous in the roles they play in their respective overarching exploitative systems: both are produced by the exploited person and both are forcefully taken away from them.&lt;ref&gt;MacKinnon, C. A. (1982). Feminism, Marxism, method, and the state: An agenda for theory. Signs, 7(3), 515-544.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some feminist scholars have illuminated the idea that all women cannot have uniformly similar experiences of sexual violence or its aftermath. For instance race and ethnicity are significant determinants of these experiences, which serves to show that approaches which are exclusively feminist or exclusively anti-racist in nature are misguided. Instead, a proposition has been made for use of inter-sectionality when studying these cases.&lt;ref&gt;Crenshaw, K. (1991). Mapping the margins: Intersectionality, identity politics, and violence against women of color. Stanford law review, 1241-1299.&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist ideas have served as catalysts for transnational movements to combat violence against women, including sexual violence. This agenda has also been adopted by feminist organizations, as illustrated by the current initiative titled the Rape Task Force of the [[National Organization for Women|National Organization for Women (NOW)]].

== International legal framework ==
{{Main|International framework of sexual violence}}
[[International humanitarian law]] (IHL) strongly prohibits sexual violence in all armed conflicts and [[international human rights law]] (IHRL) and [[international customary law]] strongly prohibit it at all times.&lt;ref name="Lindsey 2001 57–61"/&gt;&lt;ref name="icrc.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Physicians for Human Rights 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs 2007"/&gt; IHL ensures women are protected through a two-tiered approach, being covered by general (equal protection as men) and specific protections. IHL mandates special protections to women, according to their additional needs when they are more vulnerable, such as widows, the sick and wounded, migrants, the internally displaced, or those held in detention.&lt;ref name="Customary IHL. Rule 134 on Women"&gt;{{cite web|title=Customary IHL.

Groundbreaking [[case law]] both by the ''ad hoc'' Tribunals of [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] (ICTR) and [[International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY) established acts of [[war rape|rape]] and sexual violence as [[Genocide#As a crime|crimes of genocide]] and [[crimes against humanity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lindsey|2001|pp=57–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bassiouni|first=M.

An extensive amount of both [[Hard law|hard]] and [[soft law]] instruments set rules, standards and norms for the protection of victims of sexual offences. These include the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]] (1979);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (1979), art. 6 |url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/text/econvention.htm#article6 |accessdate=29 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xc2eRFDv?url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/text/econvention.htm |archivedate=1 April 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]] (1993); the Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment and Eradication of Violence Against Women (1994);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment and Eradication of Violence Against Women|url=https://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/brazil1994.html|website=University of Minnesota Human Rights Library|accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa]] (2003), and the [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]] (1993).

[[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1888]] (2009), in particular, created the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary General for Sexual Violence in Conflict (SRSG-SVC). The Office highlighted six priorities and identified eight priority countries: [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Central African Republic]] (CAR), [[Colombia]], [[Cote d’Ivoire]], [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] (DRC), [[Liberia]], [[South Sudan]], and [[Sudan]].

==History==

===General===
Sexual violence can be traced back to the Greeks and Romans where women were seen as property without any rights over their bodies or sexual integrity. Rape of women during peace times was therefore considered as property crime only affecting their owners: the husbands, sons or brothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Herik|first=edited by Anne-Marie De Brouwer, Charlotte Ku, Renée Römkens, Larissa van den|title=Sexual violence as an international crime : interdisciplinary approaches|year=1120|publisher=Intersentia|location=Cambridge [etc.]|isbn=978-1-78068-002-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; During armed conflict sexual violence, particularly rape, was perceived as a normal byproduct of war, as "a socially acceptable behavior well within the rules of warfare".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brownmiller|first=Susan|title=Against our will : men, women, and rape|year=1993|publisher=Fawcett Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-449-90820-4|edition=1st Ballantine Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Ancient Greece, women were sometimes the reason for the attack of a city, conquering women as new wives or concubines, legitimate booty, as slaves or as trophies. The fact that sexual violence to women was commonplace during both war and peace times led to the negligence of any indications of what the methods, aims and magnitude of such violence was; it was face- and nameless.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Heineman|2011|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages===
The [[Middle Ages]] strongly reflected the patriarchal sexual violence view. During times of peace, female spouses had no right to refuse sex with their husbands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=D'Cruze|first=Shani|title=Approaching the History of Rape and Sexual Violence: Notes towards Research|journal=[[Women's History Review]]|year=2011|volume=1|issue=3|page=382|doi=10.1080/09612029300200016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though laws punishing rapes existed, sexual violence was usually considered as justified or inconsequential. Usually, depending on the elite's views, which perceived sexual violence as a minor issue, sexual violence was not prosecuted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ruggiero|first=Guido|title=Sexual Criminality in the Early Renaissance: Venice 1338-1358|journal=Journal of Social History|year=1975|volume=8|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view was also transferred to the colonies. In Alta California, for example, the Catholic clergy relied heavily on corporal punishment such as flogging, placing in the stocks or shackling of Amerinindian women within their programs of Christianization.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Heineman|2011|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this context of trying to restore a certain social order, women were often the victims of sexual violence if politically active and posing a threat to the existing order.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Heineman|2011|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to times of war, jurists, writers and scholars argued that as soon as war is just, no boundaries would be set towards methods used in order to achieve victory. However, with [[Alberico Gentili]] (1552–1608) discussions started that suffering of women should be reduced and rape prohibited during peace and war times. However, this view was not accepted for a long time, as women and children not participating in the fighting were still considered as being the enemy and the patriarchal view on women prevailed during peace and war times.

===Codification of laws of war on gender-related crimes===
Gradually, over the centuries laws and customs of war changed in direction of a wider understanding of sexual violence and the need to protect the victims. During the American civil war, the US started to codify the customary rules regulating land-based wars. With the [[Lieber Code]] of 1863, President Lincoln tried to regulate the conduct of Union soldiers and prohibited explicitly rape.&lt;ref name="Kuo 2002 306"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kuo|first=Peggy|title=Prosecuting Crimes of Sexual Violence in an International Tribunal|journal=Case Western Reserve Journal of International Law|year=2002|volume=34|page=306}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[First Geneva Convention|first-ever Geneva Convention]] one year after and the Fourth [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Conventions]] 1907 followed this line by advocating the protection of family rights and honor, implying specifically also the prohibition of rape. But the only enforcement mechanisms were the military commanders themselves, having the right to execute the soldiers immediately.&lt;ref name="Kuo 2002 306"/&gt;

After [[World War I]], a War Crimes Commission was established in order to bring war criminals before justice. Forced prostitution and rape was seen as grave violation of the customs and laws of war. Under the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg (IMT) and the International Military Tribunal for the Far East at Tokyo (IMTFE), the spectrum of sexual violence as war crime was widened even though rape was not explicitly mentioned. The transcripts of the trials contain evidence of rape, sexual slavery, sexual torture, forced prostitution, forced sterilization, forced abortion, pornography, sexual mutilation, forced nudity and [[Sexual sadism disorder|sexual sadism]]. But only after the Tokyo Tribunal, when Japanese commanders were prosecuted the first time based on the chain of command for not having prevented rape and sexual slavery of [[comfort women]] during the Second World War, was sexual violence gradually considered as a grave war crime in itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Campanaro|2002|p=2564}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Argibay|first=Carmen M.|title=Sexual Slavery and the "Comfort Women" of World War II|journal=Berkeley Journal of International Law|year=2003|volume=21|page=387}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view was the first time expressed after Nuremberg and Tokyo in the second series of trials for the prosecution of "lesser" war criminals where the Control Council Law No. 10 explicitly listed rape constituting a crime against humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Control Council Law No. 10|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/imt10.asp|publisher=Yale Law School}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Campanaro|2002|p=2565}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Show, don't tell''' is a technique used in various kinds of texts to allow the reader to experience the story through [[Action (fiction)|action]], words, thoughts, senses, and feelings rather than through the author's [[exposition (narrative)|exposition]], summarization, and [[description]]. It avoids adjectives describing the author's analysis, but instead describes the scene in such a way that the reader can draw his or her own conclusions. The technique applies equally to [[nonfiction]] and all forms of [[fiction]], literature including [[Haiku]]&lt;ref&gt;British Haiku Society- occasional paper 'English Haiku: a Composite View'2002&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Imagism]] poetry in particular, speech, movie making, and playwriting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Wells | year = 1999 | title = How To Write Non-Fiction Books | publisher = Writers' Bookshop | page = 65 | isbn= 1902713028}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Warren | year = 2011 | title = Show Don't Tell: A Guide to Purpose Driven Speech | publisher = Jerianne Warren | isbn= 0615498353}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Mackendrick, Cronin, Scorsese | year = 2005 | title = On Film-making: An Introduction to the Craft of the Director | publisher = Faber \&amp; Faber | page = xxiii | isbn= 0571211259}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hatcher | year = 2000 | title = The Art and Craft of Playwriting | publisher = F+W Media | page = 43 | isbn= 1884910467}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept is often attributed to Russian playwright [[Anton Chekhov]], reputed to have said "Don't tell me the moon is shining; show me the glint of light on broken glass." What Chekhov actually said, in a letter to his brother, was "In descriptions of Nature one must seize on small details, grouping them so that when the reader closes his eyes he gets a picture. For instance, you’ll have a moonlit night if you write that on the mill dam a piece of glass from a broken bottle glittered like a bright little star, and that the black shadow of a dog or a wolf rolled past like a ball." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Yarmolinsky|first=Avrahm|year=1954|title=The Unknown Chekhov: Stories and Other Writings Hitherto Untranslated by Anton Chekhov|page=14|publisher=Noonday Press, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The distinction between telling and showing was popularized in [[Percy Lubbock]]'s book ''The Craft of Fiction'' (1921), and has been an important element in Anglo-Saxon [[narratology|narratological theory]] ever since.

==Examples==
===Ernest Hemingway===

Nobel Prize–winning novelist [[Ernest Hemingway]] was a notable proponent of the "show, don't tell" style. His [[Iceberg Theory]], also known as the "theory of omission", developed from his background as a newspaper reporter. The term itself originates from his bullfighting treatise, ''[[Death in the Afternoon]]'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0v1GUke_ncMC&amp;pg=PA128&amp;dq=If+a+writer+of+prose+knows+enough+of+what+he+is+writing+about+he+may+omit+things+that+he+knows+and+the+reader,+if+the+writer+is+writing+truly+enough,+will+have+a+feeling+of+those+things+as+strongly+as+though+the+writer+had+stated+them.+The+dignity+of+movement+of+an+iceberg+is+due+to+only+one-eighth+of+it+being+above+water.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-4-Pywc3XAhVEJFAKHaiMAW8QuwUIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Hemingway's Theaters of Masculinity|first=Thomas F.|last=Strychacz|date=20 November 2017|publisher=LSU Press|accessdate=20 November 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;If a writer of prose knows enough of what he is writing about he may omit things that he knows and the reader, if the writer is writing truly enough, will have a feeling of those things as strongly as though the writer had stated them. The dignity of movement of an iceberg is due to only one-eighth of it being above water. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Creative literature (as opposed to technical writing or objective journalism) in general hinges on the artful use of a wide range of devices (such as inference, [[metaphor]], understatement, the [[unreliable narrator]], and ambiguity) that reward the careful reader's appreciation of subtext and extrapolation of what the author chooses to leave unsaid, untold, and/or unshown. This suggests a form of respect for the reader, who should be trusted to develop a feeling for the meaning behind the action, without having the point painfully laid out for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=izK6BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT17&amp;lpg=PT17&amp;dq=develop+a+feeling+for+the+meaning+behind+the+action,+without+having+the+point+painfully+laid+out+for+them&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=82FuRr_SB2&amp;sig=Ucrfj3FnKus-LfTEeIL0VllGDBE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjy2qmsw83XAhVFJ1AKHbJvD9sQ6AEIKzAB#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=How to Write a Novel in 90 Days|first=Conrad|last=Jones|date=21 October 2013|publisher=Andrews UK Limited|accessdate=20 November 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chuck Palahniuk===

In a 2013 article, [[Chuck Palahniuk]] (author of the novel ''[[Fight Club (novel)|Fight Club]]'') goes as far as recommending a ban of what he calls "thought verbs" ("Thinks, Knows, Understands, Realizes, Believes, Wants, Remembers, Imagines, Desires […]") favoring instead the use of "specific sensory detail: action, smell, taste, sound, and feeling."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Palahniuk|first=Chuck|title=Nuts and Bolts: "Thought" Verbs|url=http://litreactor.com/essays/chuck-palahniuk/nuts-and-bolts-%E2%80%9Cthought%E2%80%9D-verbs|work=LitReactor|accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===James Scott Bell===

"Show, don't tell" should not be applied to all incidents in a story. According to James Scott Bell, "Sometimes a writer tells as a shortcut, to move quickly to the meaty part of the story or [[scene (fiction)|scene]]. Showing is essentially about making scenes vivid. If you try to do it constantly, the parts that are supposed to stand out won't, and your readers will get exhausted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Orson Scott Card===

[[Scene (drama)|Scenes]] that are important to the story should be dramatized with showing, but sometimes what happens between scenes can be told so the story can make progress. According to [[Orson Scott Card]] and others, "showing" is so terribly time consuming that it is to be used only for dramatic scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

A '''tautonym''' is a [[scientific name]] of a species in which both parts of the name have the same spelling, for example ''[[Rattus rattus]]''. The first part of the name is the name of the genus and the  second part is referred to as the ''specific epithet'' in the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]]'' and the ''specific name'' in the ''[[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]]''.

Tautonymy (i.e., the usage of tautonymous names) is permissible in zoological nomenclature (see [[List of tautonyms]] for examples). In past editions of the zoological Code, the term tautonym was used, but it has now been replaced by the more inclusive "tautonymous names"; these include trinomial names such as ''[[Gorilla gorilla gorilla]]'', and ''[[Bison bison bison]]''.

For animals, a tautonym implicitly indicates that the species is the [[type species|type]] of its genus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iczn.org/iczn/index.jsp ICZN. Chapter 15 Art. 68a]&lt;/ref&gt; This can also be indicated by a species name with the specific epithet ''typus'' or ''typicus'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iczn.org/iczn/index.jsp ICZN. Chapter 15 Art. 68c]&lt;/ref&gt; although more commonly the [[type species]] is designated another way.

==Botanical nomenclature==

In the current rules for [[botanical nomenclature]] (which apply retroactively), tautonyms are explicitly prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php?page=art23#23.4 |title=Article 23.4 |date=2012 |work=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Melbourne Code) |publisher=International Association for Plant Taxonomy|accessdate=28 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example of a botanical tautonym is 'Larix larix'. The earliest name for the [[European Larch|European larch]] is ''Pinus larix'' L. (1753) but [[Gustav Karl Wilhelm Hermann Karsten]] did not agree with the placement of the species in ''[[Pinus]]'' and decided to move it to ''[[Larix]]'' in 1880. His proposed name created a tautonym. Under rules first established in 1906, which are applied retroactively, 'Larix larix' does not and cannot exist (as a formal name). In such a case either the next earliest validly published name must be found, in this case ''[[Larix decidua]]'' Mill. (1768), or (in its absence) a new epithet must be published.

However, it is allowed for both parts of the name of a species to mean the same ([[pleonasm]]), without being identical in spelling. For instance, ''Arctostaphylos uva-ursi'' means [[bearberry]] twice, in Greek and Latin respectively; ''Picea omorica'' uses the Latin and Serbian terms for a [[pine]].

Instances that repeat the genus name with a slight modification, such as ''Lycopersicon lycopersicum'' (Greek and Latinized Greek, a rejected name for the [[tomato]]) and ''[[Ziziphus zizyphus]]'', have been contentious, but are in accord with the Code of Nomenclature.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author1=Kirkbride, J.H. |author2=Wiersema, J.H. |author3=Turland, N.J. |year=2006 |title=(1753) Proposal to conserve the name ''Ziziphus jujuba'' against ''Z. zizyphus'' (Rhamnaceae) |journal=Taxon |volume=55 |issue=4 |pages=1049–1050 |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/iapt/tax/2006/00000055/00000004/art00039}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tin-glazed pottery'''&lt;ref&gt;''Maiolica'', [[C. Drury E. Fortnum]], 1875, p.12“&lt;/ref&gt; is [[earthenware]] covered in [[Ceramic glaze|glaze]] containing [[tin oxide]] which is white, shiny and opaque (see [[tin-glazing]] for the chemistry); usually this provides a background for brightly painted decoration.  It has been important in [[Islamic pottery|Islamic]] and European [[pottery]], but very little used in East Asia. The pottery body is usually made of red or buff-colored [[earthenware]] and the white glaze imitated [[Chinese porcelain]].  The decoration on tin-glazed pottery is usually applied to the unfired glaze surface by brush with metallic oxides, commonly [[cobalt oxide]], [[copper (II) oxide|copper oxide]], [[iron oxide]], [[manganese dioxide]] and [[antimony]] oxide.  The makers of Italian tin-glazed pottery from the late [[Renaissance]] blended oxides to produce detailed and realistic polychrome paintings.

The earliest tin-glazed pottery appears to have been made in [[Iraq]] in the 9th century, the oldest fragments having been excavated during the [[First World War]] from the palace of [[Samarra]] about fifty miles north of [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref name=Caiger1973&gt;Caiger-Smith, Alan, ''Tin-glazed Pottery in Europe and the Islamic World: The Tradition of 1000 Years in Maiolica, Faience and Delftware'' (Faber and Faber, 1973) {{ISBN|0-571-09349-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From there it spread to Egypt, Persia and Spain before reaching [[Italy]] in the [[Renaissance]], [[Holland]] in the 16th century and [[England]], [[France]] and other European countries shortly after.

The development of white, or near white, firing bodies in Europe from the late 18th century, such as [[creamware]] by [[Josiah Wedgwood]], and icreasingly cheap [[Porcelain#European porcelain|European porcelain]] and [[Chinese export porcelain]], reduced the demand for tin-glaze [[Delftware]], [[faience]] and [[majolica]].

The rise in the cost of tin oxide during the First World War led to its partial substitution by [[zirconium]] compounds in the glaze.

==Names==
[[File:Chinese white ware and Iraqi earthenware bowls 9th 10th century both found in Iraq.jpg|thumb|Chinese [[porcelain]] white ware bowl, not tin-glazed (left), found in [[Iran]], and Iraqi tin-glazed earthenware bowl (right) found in [[Iraq]], both 9-10th century, an example of [[Chinese influences on Islamic pottery]]. [[British Museum]].]]
Tin-glazed pottery of different periods and styles is known by different names.  The pottery from Muslim Spain is known as ''[[Hispano-Moresque ware]]''. The decorated tin-glaze of Renaissance Italy is called ''[[maiolica]]'', sometimes pronounced and spelt ''majolica'' by English speakers and authors. When the technique was taken up in the Netherlands, it became known as ''[[delftware]]'' as much of it was made in the town of [[Delft]]. Dutch potters brought it to England in around 1600, and wares produced there are known as ''[[English Delftware|English delftware]]'' or ''galleyware''. In France it was known as ''[[faience]]''.

The word ''maiolica'' is thought to have come from the medieval Italian word for [[Majorca]], an island on the route for ships that brought Hispano-Moresque wares to Italy from [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]] in the 15th and 16th centuries, or from the Spanish ''obra de Mallequa'', the term for lustered ware made in Valencia under the influence of Moorish craftsmen from Malaga. During the Renaissance, the term ''maiolica'' was adopted for Italian-made [[lusterware|luster pottery]] copying Spanish examples, and, during the 16th century, its meaning shifted to include all tin-glazed earthenware.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/a/ceramics-m-is-for-maiolica-majolica/ Victoria and Albert Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of their identical names, there has been some confusion between tin-glazed majolica/maiolica and the lead-glazed majolica made in England and America in the 19th century, but they are different in origin, technique, style and history. In the late 18th century, old Italian tin-glazed maiolica became popular among  the British, who referred to it by the anglicized pronunciation ''majolica''. The [[Mintons Ltd|Minton]] pottery copied it and applied the term ''majolica ware'' to their product. At the Great Exhibition of 1851, Minton launched the colorful [[lead-glazed earthenware]] which they called ''[[Palissy ware]]'', soon also to become known as ''majolica''. So now we have two distinct products with the same name. "In the 1870s, the curators of the [[Victoria and Albert Museum|South Kensington Museum]] returned to the original Italian 'maiolica' with an 'i' to describe all Italian tin-glazed earthenware, doubtless to stress the Italian pronunciation and to avoid confusion with contemporary majolica."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/a/ceramics-m-is-for-maiolica-majolica/  Victoria and Albert Museum, "Ceramics - M is for Maiolica/majolica"]&lt;/ref&gt;

:''For the article about 19th century lead-glazed earthenware, see [[Victorian majolica]]''

W.B. Honey (Keeper of Ceramics at the [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]], 1938–1950) wrote of ''maiolica'' that, "By a convenient extension and limitation the name may be applied to all tin-glazed ware, of whatever nationality, made in the Italian tradition … the name faïence (or the synonymous English 'delftware') being reserved for the later wares of the 17th Century onwards, either in original styles (as in the case of the French) or, more frequently, in the Dutch-Chinese (Delft) tradition."&lt;ref name=Honey&gt;Honey, W.B., ''European Ceramic Art'', 1952&lt;/ref&gt;  The term ''maiolica'' is sometimes applied to modern tin-glazed ware made by studio potters.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, ''The New Maiolica'' by Matthias Osterman.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Moors]] introduced tin-glazed pottery to Spain after the conquest of 711.

Hispano-Moresque ware is generally distinguished from the pottery of Christendom by the Islamic character of its decoration,&lt;ref name=Caiger1973/&gt; though as the dish illustrated shows, it was also made for the Christian market.

Hispano-Moresque shapes of the 15th century included the ''[[albarello]]'' (a tall jar), luster dishes with [[Coat of Arms|coats of arms]], made for wealthy Italians and Spaniards, jugs, some on high feet (the ''citra'' and the ''grealet''), a deep-sided dish (the ''lebrillo de alo'') and the eared bowl (''cuenco de oreja'').

With the Spanish conquest of [[Mexico]], tin-glazed pottery came to be produced in the Valley of Mexico as early as 1540, at first in imitation of the ceramics imported from [[Seville]].&lt;ref&gt;Lister&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Moors were expelled from Spain in the early 17th century, the Hispano-Moresque style survived in the province of Valencia.  Later wares usually have a coarse reddish-buff body, dark blue decoration and luster.

==Maiolica==
{{main|Maiolica}}

[[File:albarello.JPG|thumb|right|An albarello (drug jar) from Venice or Castel Durante, 16th century.  Approx 30cm high.  Decorated in cobalt blue, copper green, antimony yellow and yellow ochre.  [[Burrell Collection]]]]The 15th-century wares that initiated maiolica as an art form were the product of a long technical evolution, in which medieval lead-glazed wares were improved by the addition of tin oxides under the initial influence of Islamic wares imported through Sicily.&lt;ref&gt;Goldthwaite, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;  Such archaic wares&lt;ref&gt;Blake&lt;/ref&gt; are sometimes dubbed ''proto-maiolica''.&lt;ref&gt;Whitehouse&lt;/ref&gt;  During the later 14th century, the limited palette of colors was expanded from the traditional manganese purple and copper green to embrace cobalt blue, antimony yellow and iron-oxide orange. ''Sgraffito'' wares were also produced, in which the white tin-oxide slip was decoratively scratched to produce a design from the revealed body of the ware.

Refined production of tin-glazed earthenware made for more than local needs was concentrated in central Italy from the later 13th century, especially in the ''contada'' of [[Florence]].  The city itself declined in importance in the second half of the 15th century, perhaps because of local [[deforestation]]. Italian cities encouraged the start of a new pottery industry by offering tax relief, citizenship, monopoly rights and protection from outside imports.  Production scattered among small communes&lt;ref&gt;Galeazzo Cora (1973) noted kilns dispersed at Bacchereto (a center of production from the fourteenth century), Puntormo, [[Prato]] and [[Pistoia]], none of them site-names that have circulated among connoisseurs and collectors.&lt;/ref&gt; and, after the mid-15th century, at [[Faenza]], [[Arezzo]] and [[Siena]]. Faenza, which gave its name to [[faience]], was the only fair-sized city in which the ceramic industry became a major economic component.&lt;ref&gt;Goldthwaite p.14&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bologna]] produced lead-glazed wares for export.  [[Orvieto]] and [[Deruta]] both produced ''maioliche'' in the 15th century.  In the 16th century, maiolica production was established at [[Castel Durante]], [[Urbino]], [[Gubbio]] and [[Pesaro]].  Some maiolica was produced as far north as [[Padua]], [[Venice]] and [[Turin]] and as far south as [[Palermo]] and [[Caltagirone]] in Sicily.&lt;ref name=Caiger1973/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rackham, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17th century [[Savona]] began to be a prominent place of manufacture.

Some of the principal centers of production (e.g. [[Deruta]] and [[Montelupo Fiorentino|Montelupo]]) still produce maiolica, which is sold in quantity in Italian tourist areas.

==Delftware==
{{main|Delftware}}

Delftware was made in the Netherlands from the 16th to the 18th centuries. The main period of manufacture was 1600-1780, after which it was succeeded by white stoneware and porcelain.

The earliest tin-glazed pottery in the Netherlands was made in Antwerp in 1512. The manufacture of painted pottery may have spread from the southern to the northern Netherlands in the 1560s. It was made in Middleburg and Haarlem in the 1570s and in Amsterdam in the 1580s.&lt;ref name=Caiger1973/&gt;  Much of the finer work was produced in Delft, but simple everyday tin-glazed pottery was made in such places as Gouda, Rotterdam, Amsterdam and Dordrecht.&lt;ref name=Caiger1973/&gt;

The [[Guild of St. Luke]], to which painters in all media had to belong, admitted ten master potters in the thirty years between 1610 and 1640 and twenty in the nine years 1651 to 1660. In 1654 a gunpowder explosion in Delft destroyed many breweries, and, as the brewing industry was in decline, their premises became available to pottery makers.&lt;ref name=Caiger1973/&gt;

From about 1615, the potters began to coat their pots completely in white tin glaze instead of covering only the painting surface and coating the rest with clear glaze. They then began to cover the tin glaze with a coat of clear glaze which gave depth to the fired surface and smoothness to [[cobalt]] blues, ultimately creating a good resemblance to porcelain.&lt;ref name=Caiger1973/&gt;

Although Dutch potters did not immediately imitate Chinese porcelain, they began to do after the death of the Emperor [[Wan-Li]] in 1619, when the supply to Europe was interrupted.&lt;ref name=Caiger1973/&gt; Delftware inspired by Chinese originals persisted from about 1630 to the mid-18th century alongside European patterns.

Delftware ranged from simple household items to fancy artwork. Pictorial plates were made in abundance, illustrated with religious motifs, native Dutch scenes with [[windmills]] and [[fishing]] [[boat]]s, hunting scenes, landscapes and seascapes. The Delft potters also made tiles in vast numbers (estimated at eight hundred million over a period of two hundred years&lt;ref name=Caiger1973/&gt;); many Dutch houses still have tiles that were fixed in the 17th and 18th centuries.

Delftware became popular, was widely exported in Europe and reached China and Japan. Chinese and Japanese potters made porcelain versions of Delftware for export to Europe.

By the late 18th century, Delftware potters had lost their market to British porcelain and the new white earthenware.

There are good collections of old Delftware in the [[Rijksmuseum]] and the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]].

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:ajvdelft.jpg|thumb|English delftware drug jar circa 1720-40 (copyright ajv private collection)|{{puic|1=Ajvdelft.jpg|log=2009 February 28}}]] --&gt;English delftware was made in the British Isles between about 1550 and the late 18th century.  The main centers of production were [[London]], [[Bristol]] and [[Liverpool]] with smaller centers at [[Wincanton]], [[Glasgow]] and [[Dublin]].

[[John Stow]]'s ''Survey of London'' (1598) records the arrival in 1567 of two Antwerp potters, Jasper Andries and Jacob Jansen, in [[Norwich]], where they made "Gally Paving Tiles, and vessels for Apothecaries and others, very artificially".&lt;ref name=Caiger1973/&gt; In 1579 Jansen applied to [[Queen Elizabeth I]] for the sole right to practice "galleypotting" in London and soon set up a workshop at [[Aldgate]] to the east of the city.  There were already other Flemish potters in London, two of them in [[Southwark]] recorded in 1571 as "painters of pottes".&lt;ref name=Caiger1973/&gt;

English delftware pottery and its painted decoration is similar in many respects to that from Holland, but its peculiarly English quality has been commented upon: "...&amp;nbsp;there is a relaxed tone and a sprightliness which is preserved throughout the history of English delftware; the overriding mood is provincial and naive rather than urbane and sophisticated."&lt;ref&gt;Carnegy, p.51. Caiger-Smith describes its mood as "ingenuous, direct, sometimes eccentric", and Garner talks of its "quite distinctive character".&lt;/ref&gt; Its methods and techniques were less sophisticated than those of its continental counterparts.

The earliest known piece with an English inscription is a dish dated 1600 in the London Museum. It is painted in blue, purple, green, orange and yellow and depicts the Tower of London and Old London Bridge, surrounded by the words, "THE ROSE IS RED THE LEAVES ARE GRENE GOD SAVE ELIZABETH OUR QUEENE" and an Italianate border of masks and leaves. The rim is decorated with dashes of blue and can be considered the first in series of large decorated dishes so painted and called blue-dash chargers. Blue-dash chargers, usually between about 25 and 35&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter with abstract, floral, religious, [http://www.antiquedelft.com/cbr5.html patriotic] or [http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/explore/highlights/highlight_image.aspx?image=ps337952.jpg&amp;retpage=20594 topographical]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }} motifs, were produced in quantity by London and Bristol potters until the early 18th century.  As they were kept for decoration on walls, dressers and side-tables, many have survived and they are well represented in museum collections.

Smaller and more everyday wares were also made: paving tiles, mugs, drug jars, dishes, wine bottles, [http://www.antiquedelft.com/keg.html posset pots], salt pots, candlesticks, fuddling cups,&lt;ref&gt;Ale mugs joined in groups of three, four or five with connecting holes to confuse the drinker.&lt;/ref&gt; puzzle jugs,&lt;ref&gt;Similar to fuddling cups,&lt;/ref&gt; barber's bowls, pill slabs, bleeding bowls, [[porringer]]s, and [http://www.antiquedelft.com/mrw.html flower bricks].

Towards the end of the 17th century, changing taste led to the replacement of apothecary pots, paving tiles and large dishes by polite tablewares, delicate ornaments, [[punch (drink)|punch bowls]], teapots, cocoa pots and coffee-pots.

There are good examples of English delftware in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], the [[British Museum]], the [[Ashmolean Museum]] and the [[Fitzwilliam Museum]].

==Faience==
{{main|Faience}}
[[File:Faience-luneville-saint-clement.jpg|thumb|right|Faience of [[Lunéville]]]]
In France, the first well-known painter of faïence was [[Masseot Abaquesne]], established in Rouen in the 1530s. Other centres of faience manufacturing developed from the early 18th century, led in 1690 by [[Quimper, Finistère|Quimper]] in Brittany [https://web.archive.org/web/20050413214248/http://www.faience-de-quimper.com/histquim_en.html], which today possesses a museum devoted to faience, and followed by [[Nevers]], [[Moustiers-Sainte-Marie|Moustiers]] and [[Marseille]], [[Strasbourg]] and [[Lunéville]].

The products of faience manufactories are identified by the usual methods of ceramic connoisseurship: the character of the clay body, the character and palette of the [[ceramic glaze|glaze]], and the style of decoration, ''faïence blanche'' being left in its undecorated fired white slip. ''Faïence parlante'' bears mottoes often on decorative labels or banners. [[Apothecary]] wares, including ''[[albarello|albarelli]]'', can bear the names of their intended contents, generally in Latin and often so abbreviated to be unrecognizable to the untutored eye. Mottoes of fellowships and associations became popular in the 18th century, leading to the ''faïence patriotique'' that was a specialty of the years of the [[French Revolution]].

Popular and folk forms have continued in many countries, including the Mexican [[Talavera (pottery)|Talavera]].

In the 20th century there were changes in the formulation of tin-glaze and several artist potters began to work in the medium of tin-glazed pottery.

The cost of tin oxide rose considerably during the 1918-1918 war and resulted in a search for cheaper alternatives.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The first successful replacement was [[zirconia]] and later [[zircon]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;''Ceramics Glaze Technology'', J.R. Taylor &amp; A.C. Bull, The Institute Of Ceramics &amp; Pergamon Press, Oxford, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst zirconium compounds are not as effective opacifiers as tin oxide, their relatively low price has led to a gradual increase in their use, with an associated reduction in the use of tin oxide. The whiteness resulting from the use of zirconia has been described as more "clinical" than that from tin oxide and is preferred in some applications.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Science For Craft Potters And Enamellers'', K. Shaw, A.H. &amp; A.W. Reed, Wellington, 1973&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, tin oxide still finds use in ceramic manufacture and has been widely used as the opacifier in sanitaryware,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; with up to 6% used in glazes.&lt;ref&gt;''Sanitaryware'', D. Fortuna, Gruppo Editoriale Faenza Editrice s.p.a., Florence, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise, tin oxide in glazes, often in conjunction with zircon compounds, is generally restricted to specialist low temperature applications and use by studio potters.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Ceramic Glazes'', F. Singer &amp; W.L. German, Borax Consolidated Limited, London, 1960&lt;/ref&gt;

In England at the end of the nineteenth century, [[William de Morgan]] re-discovered the technique of firing luster on tin-glaze "to an extraordinarily high standard".&lt;ref&gt;Carnegy, p.65&lt;/ref&gt; Since the beginning of the 20th century there has been a revival of pottery-making in Orvieto and Deruta, the traditional centres of tin-glazed ceramics in Italy, where the shapes and designs of the medieval and renaissance period are reproduced.&lt;ref&gt;Cremona, J. and Andreis, T., ''Buongiorno Italia!'', London: BBC Books, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s and 1930s, [[Roger Fry]], [[Vanessa Bell]]  and [[Duncan Grant]] decorated tin-glazed pottery for the [[Omega Workshops]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;Anscombe, p.136&lt;/ref&gt;  Picasso produced and designed much tin-glazed pottery at [[Vallauris]] in the south of France in the 1940s and 1950s. At the [[Central School of Arts and Crafts]], London, [[Dora Billington]] encouraged her students, including [[William R. Newland (potter)|William Newland]] and [[Alan Caiger-Smith]], to use tin-glaze decoration. In Britain during the 1950s Caiger-Smith, Margaret Hine, [[Nicholas Vergette]] and others including the [[Rye Pottery]] made tin-glazed pottery, going against the trend in studio pottery towards [[stoneware]]. Subsequently, Caiger-Smith experimented with the technique of reduced lustre on tin glaze, which had been practiced in Italy until 1700 and Spain until 1800 and had then been forgotten.&lt;ref&gt;Caiger-Smith, Alan, ''Lustre Pottery: Technique, Tradition and Innovation in Islam and the Western World''(Faber and Faber, 1985) {{ISBN|0-571-13507-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caiger-Smith trained several potters at his Aldermaston Pottery and published ''Tin-glaze Pottery'' which gives a history of maiolica, delftware and faience in Europe and the Islamic world.&lt;ref&gt;'Tin-Glaze Pottery in Europe and the Islamic World: The Tradition of 1000 Years in Maiolica, Faience and Delftware.'

&lt;!-- This article is nearly a copy/paste from the single referenced external link, except where I've just cleaned up the carefree misinformation. Feb 2009 --&gt;

A '''treebog''' is a type of low-tech [[compost toilet]]. It consists of a raised platform above a compost pile surrounded by densely planted willow trees or other  nutrient-hungry vegetation.  It can be considered an example of [[permaculture]] design, as it functions as a system for converting urine and feces to [[biomass]], without the need to handle excreta. 

==Etymology==
The term "treebog" was coined Jay Abrahams of Biologic Design. ''[[wikt:bog|Bog]]'' is a [[British English]] slang word for [[toilet]], not to be confused with its other meaning of [[wetland]].

==History==
The treebog is a simple method of composting wastes. Abrahams claims that from 1995-2011, around 1500 treebogs may have been built in Britain.&lt;ref name="LivingWoods"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Making of a Biologic Treebog|journal=LivingWoods Magazine|date=January–February 2011|pages=10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They have been on sites ranging from fruit farms, pick-your-own enterprises, campsites, an angling lake, festival sites, remote/low impact dwellings, holiday cottages, allotments, and church yards where there is no mains water supply.

In 2011, Abrahams claimed that the treebog had attracted the attention of NGOs and aid workers who hope to develop its potential for shanty towns or refugee camps - anywhere that water is scarce and the population pressure on resources is high.&lt;ref name="LivingWoods"/&gt;

==Plant growth==
A treebog is simply a controlled [[compost heap]] whose function has been enhanced by use of moisture or nutrient-hungry trees. They use no water, purify waste as they create a biomass resource, and also contain the organic waste material, thus preventing the spread of disease.

The main requirement is that the planted species should be nutrient-hungry. It is a bonus if they can be harvested or [[coppice]]d for productive uses, e.g. willow cultivars. Apart from willow coppice, [[soft fruit]] such as black currants and sweet-smelling herbs such as mint will thrive around a treebog. If left unmanaged, a treebog will soon be surrounded by weed species such as nettles, but a little management and conscious planting can create a fertile and productive [[bog garden]].

Both the solids and liquids are deposited within the treebog base, where the solids compost and the liquids soak through the soil. The associated dense root zone enables the nitrogen to be rapidly absorbed and metabolized by the mycorhyzal species. The feces are contained within the treebog base, which is well ventilated to allow aerobic decomposition to occur, the mineralized material feeding the trees around it. 

==Construction==
A seating platform/cubicle is mounted at least one meter high.  The area beneath the seating platform is enclosed by a double-layer of chicken wire; this acts as an effective child-proof barrier and allows air to circulate through the compost heap.This allows for optimum plant growing conditions.

Sawdust, straw, woodchip, ash or other high-carbon matter is used to balance the high-nitrogen content of the urine. One design used Effective Micro-organism bran, which helped keep the treebog virtually odour free.&lt;ref name="PCMag"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.permaculture.co.uk/articles/loo-view-build-your-own-treebog | title=A Loo with a View - Build your own Treebog | author=Tim Green | date=18 May 2011 | publisher=Permaculture Magazine | accessdate=23 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The space between the wire is stuffed with straw, which acts as a wick to help sop up excess urine, preventing the likelihood of odour problems due to incomplete biological absorption of the nitrogen from the urine.  The straw-filled wire also enables the pile to be well-aerated whilst acting as a visual screen for the first year’s use.

The structure is surrounded by two closely planted rows of [[Salix viminalis|osier]] or [[Willow#Other|biomass willow]] cuttings; this [[Green wall|living wall]] of willow can then be woven into a hurdle-like structure and its annual growth can be harvested.

'''Earl Warren Throckmorton''' (born 1957)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bios.marquiswhoswho.com/earl_warren_throckmorton/mental_health_counselor/6347950|title=Earl Warren Throckmorton - mental health counselor - Marquis Who's Who Biography|work=marquiswhoswho.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a professor of [[Psychology]]  at [[Grove City College]] in [[Grove City, Pennsylvania|Grove City]], [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gcc.edu/academics/artsandletters/psychology/Pages/Faculty.aspx|title=Faculty|work=gcc.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; He developed the [[Sexual Identity Therapy Framework]] and was a creator of the documentary ''I Do Exist'', about people who say they have changed their sexual orientation. He is an example of an evangelical Christian who has changed his view about human sexuality, from traditional to more progressive.

== Education ==
Throckmorton received his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[Psychology]] in June, 1979 from [[Cedarville College]], an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in [[Clinical Psychology]] from [[Central Michigan University]] in May, 1982, and a [[Ph.D.]] in Counselor Education and Community Counseling from [[Ohio University]] in June 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drthrockmorton.com/webvita.pdf drthrockmorton.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sexual Identity and the Bible ==
Throckmorton's work on [[Sexual Identity Therapy]] was endorsed by psychiatrist [[Robert L. Spitzer]].&lt;ref name="New Ground"&gt;{{cite news
 |url = http://wthrockmorton.com/2007/06/18/la-times-article-features-ex-gay-debate-and-sexual-identity-therapy
 |title = New ground in debate on 'curing' gays
 |last = Simon
 |first = Stephanie
 |publisher = [[Los Angeles Times]]
 |date = 2007-06-18
 |accessdate = 2018-05-09
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of these recommendations is to help patients make their sexual identity conform to their beliefs and values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|title=New Paradigm Helps Gays with Conflicting Religious Values
|first=Lillian
|last=Kwon
|publisher=Christian Post Reporter
|date=April 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spitzer later tried to retract his research that endorsed Throckmorton's work by saying "The findings can be considered evidence for what those who have undergone ex-gay therapy say about it, but nothing more."&lt;ref name="My So-Called Ex-Gay Life"&gt;{{cite news
 |url = http://prospect.org/article/my-so-called-ex-gay-life/
 |title = My So-Called Ex-Gay Life
 |last = Arana
 |first = Gabriel
 |publisher = [[The American Prospect]]
 |date = 2012-04-11
 |accessdate = 2012-06-02
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throckmorton has come out strongly against the [[Uganda Anti-Homosexuality Bill]]. In turn, former endorsers of his work, such as [[Scott Lively]], have denounced him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.boxturtlebulletin.com/2012/08/13/47584|title = Scott Lively: Moral Relativist|author = Rob Tisinai|date = August 13, 2012|publisher = Box Turtle Bulletin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throckmorton has been involved in controversy over the origins and treatment of variations in gender identity. The February 2008 issue of ''[[Christianity Today]]'' carried an article discussing how Throckmorton has advised people who are in agony over being transgender that their desires are not in accord with the Bible.&lt;ref name="Kennedy 2008"&gt;{{cite web |author=Kennedy, John W. |date=February 2008 |title=The transgender moment; Evangelicals hope to respond with both moral authority and biblical compassion to gender identity disorder |work=[[Christianity Today]] |pages=54–58 |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/article_print.html?id=53605}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Even if science does determine differentiation in the brain at birth," Throckmorton says, "even if there are prenatal influences, we can't set aside teachings of the Bible, because of research findings."&lt;ref name="Kennedy 2008"/&gt; Throckmorton subsequently argued that these comments were quoted "out of context". On his blog, he stated that people should consult physicians, specialists, and spiritual advisors in resolving their feelings. If someone decides that sexual reassignment violates faith, then this feeling may guide their decisions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wthrockmorton.com/2008/02/14/christianity-today-on-the-transgender-moment/ Christianity Today on “The Transgender Moment” — Warren Throckmorton&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalist Jeff Sharlet said that Throckmorton has allowed data and evidence to shape his views "in a way very few people of any ideological or political stripe would."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/evangelical-professor-turned-reparative-therapy-gays-174326663.html|title=The evangelical professor who turned against 'reparative therapy' for gays|access-date=2018-04-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; That article goes on to trace Throckmorton's on-going development of his views on human sexuality and the Bible, which he still believes is divinely inspired. To say it more clearly, Throckmorton has blogged: "After working with LGBT people for two decades, I believe some people are inherently gay."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/warrenthrockmorton/2017/11/15/wishful-thinking-and-nashville-statement/|title=Wishful Thinking, Forced Intimacy, and The Nashville Statement|last=Throckmorton|first=Warren|date=2017-11-15|work=Warren Throckmorton|access-date=2018-04-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Blogging controversies ==
In addition to his writings on sexuality, he has also blogged on various Christian religious organizations involved in controversy, such as:

*[[Mark Driscoll]] and the now-defunct [[Mars Hill Church]] in Seattle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/warrenthrockmorton/category/mars-hill-church/|title=Mars Hill Church|work=Warren Throckmorton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Åbo Akademi University''' ({{lang-sv|'''Åbo Akademi'''}} {{IPA-sv|ˈoːbʊ akadɛˈmiː|}}) is the only exclusively [[Swedish language]] multi-faculty [[university]] in [[Finland]] (or anywhere outside [[Sweden]]). It is located mainly in [[Turku]] (Åbo is the Swedish name of the city) but has also activities in [[Vaasa]]. It is said to have one of the most prestigious business programs in the world (in 1999).&lt;ref&gt;Dichev, Ilia D. "How good are business school rankings?." The Journal of Business 72.2 (1999): 201-213.&lt;/ref&gt; Åbo Akademi should not be confused with the [[The Royal Academy of Turku|Royal Academy of Åbo]], which was founded in 1640, but moved to [[Helsinki]] after the [[Great Fire of Turku|Turku fire]] of 1827 and is today known as the [[University of Helsinki]].

Åbo Akademi was founded by private donations in 1918 as the third university in Finland, both to let Turku again become a university town and because it was felt that the Swedish language was threatened at the University of Helsinki. The Finnish [[University of Turku]] was founded in 1920, also by private donations and for similar reasons. Åbo Akademi was a private institution until 1981, when it was turned into a public institution. 

As the only uni-lingually Swedish multi-faculty university in the world outside Sweden and consequently the only one in Finland, Åbo Akademi University is responsible for higher education for a large proportion of the [[Swedish-speaking population of Finland|Swedish-speaking population]]. This role has many implications for education and research as well as for the social environment. As there are few students in most subjects, cooperation between faculties and with other universities is very important.

A significant minority of the students are Finnish-speaking. While Turku in itself is mostly Finnish, the university provides a strong Swedish environment. Most of the students, regardless of original language, will be functionally bilingual when finishing their studies.

The university has a policy that non-[[Swedish language|Swedish]] speaking applicants from the [[Nordic countries]] are required to participate in a Swedish language test, in order to prove their ability to successfully study in Swedish. Applicants from non-Nordic countries can, however, choose between [[Swedish language|Swedish]] or [[English language]] tests.

== Organisation ==
The university consists of four faculties:
*Faculty of Arts, Psychology and Theology (located in Turku)
*Faculty of Education and Welfare Studies (located in Vaasa)
*Faculty of Science and Engineering (located in Turku, with some activity also in Vaasa)
*Faculty of Social Sciences, Business and Economics (located in Turku, with some activity also in Vaasa)

In addition, there are several other units and joint programs, such as:
* Language Centre
* Centre for Lifelong Learning
* [[Donner Institute]] for Research in Religious and Cultural History&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Donner institute|url=http://www.abo.fi/forskning/donnerska_institutet|work=Åbo Akademi University|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Institute of Human Rights
* Turku PET Centre (jointly run by [[University of Turku|Turku University]], Åbo Akademi and the [[TYKS|Turku University Hospital]])
* [[Tucs|Turku Centre for Computer Science (TUCS)]] (in co-operation with Turku University, among others)
* Turku Centre for Biotechnology (in co-operation with Turku University, among others)
* [[Vasa övningsskola]], located in [[Vaasa]], is the [[normal school]] of the teacher training programme.

When the university was turned into a public institution the foundation Stiftelsen för Åbo Akademi remained. Besides maintaining many of the university buildings, it is also a significant donor. Because of new legislation regarding higher education, it is planned to turn universities in Finland into semi-private institutions.

== Rectors ==
The following people have served as rectors of Åbo Akademi:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.abo.fi/rektorer-genom-tiderna/|title=Rektorer genom tiderna|last=|first=|date=|website=Åbo Akademi|language=sv-SE|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
