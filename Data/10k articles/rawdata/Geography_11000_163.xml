The '''A38(M)''', also known as the '''Aston Expressway''', is a [[motorway]] in [[Birmingham]], England. It is {{convert|2|mi}} long and was opened on 24 May 1972.&lt;ref name="ma-dates"&gt;[http://www.iht.org/motorway/a38mastonstat.htm The Motorway Archive A38(M) – Dates] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311050656/http://www.iht.org/motorway/a38mastonstat.htm |date=11 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It forms part of the much longer [[A38 road|A38]] route.

It is extremely unusual among UK motorways, as part of it consists of seven lanes with no central reservation, and operates a [[Reversible lane|tidal flow]] system in an attempt to minimise congestion. Due to the nature of the road, the speed limit is reduced to 50&amp;nbsp;mph (80&amp;nbsp;km/h) for most of its length with a very short length of 30&amp;nbsp;mph (48&amp;nbsp;km/h),&lt;ref&gt;https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@52.4906935,-1.8889903,3a,75y,203.24h,84.6t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sRFkT6PbCktrodePaioHNmA!2e0!7i13312!8i6656&lt;/ref&gt; though there are no permanent [[speed camera]]s{{as of?|date=January 2010}}.

When construction work of the motorway began in the late 1960s, many late 19th-century and early 20th-century houses in the Aston area had to be demolished to make way for the new route.

==Route==
[[File:A38(M) Aston Expressway.jpg|thumb|right|The Aston Expressway approaching [[Birmingham City Centre]]]] A38(M) runs from the [[A5127 road|A5127]]  through [[Gravelly Hill Interchange]] where the A38 joins and then shortly after traffic from the [[M6 motorway]] also joins. It then enters a [[Reversible lane|tidal flow]] section. The road is on a [[viaduct]] as it passes through [[Aston]]; this section cuts through the grounds of [[Aston Hall]].&lt;ref name="ma-main"&gt;[http://www.iht.org/motorway/a38mastonexp.htm The Motorway Archive – A38(M)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311050646/http://www.iht.org/motorway/a38mastonexp.htm |date=11 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The road passes through its first junction after {{convert|1|mi}}. It enters a cutting before reaching the second junction, where the tidal flow ends as does the motorway. The motorway is curved in Aston to avoid an [[Ansells]] [[brewery]]. The motorway was also crossed by a [[vinegar]] [[pipeline transport|pipeline]], carrying the condiment from one part of the since-demolished [[HP Sauce]] factory to the other.

==Tidal flow==

The Expressway was the first road in the United Kingdom to introduce [[Reversible lane|tidal flow]] to allow better management of traffic. Lane use is controlled by means of electronic overhead signs, with one lane always closed to create a buffer between the two directions of travel – there is no [[central reservation]]. In the morning, four of the seven lanes are designated for use by traffic heading toward Birmingham city centre, and two lanes for traffic out of the city. In the evening rush hour, this pattern is reversed and four lanes are made available to outbound traffic and two lanes towards the city centre. At all other times, the road runs with three lanes in each direction.

[[Motorcycle]]s are banned from the red-surfaced central lane, which contains a drainage channel, regardless of how it is being used. This follows a fatal accident which occurred when one of the drainage covers dislodged.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbrd.co.uk/motorway/a38m/ CBRD Motorway Database – A38(M)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bocas del Dragón''' ('''Dragon's Mouths''') is the name of the series of straits separating the [[Gulf of Paria]] from the [[Caribbean Sea]].  There are four Bocas, from west to east:
* The '''Boca Grande''' or '''Grand Boca''' separates [[Chacachacare]] from the [[Paria Peninsula]] and [[Patos Island (Venezuela)|Patos Island]] of [[Venezuela]].  The [[international border]] between [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and Venezuela runs through this strait.
* The '''Boca de Navios''' or '''Third Boca''' which separates Chacachacare from [[Huevos]].
* The '''Boca de Huevos''' or '''Second Boca''' which separates Huevos from [[Monos]].
* The '''Boca de Monos''' or '''First Boca''' which separates Monos from the [[Chaguaramas, Trinidad|Chaguaramas]] Peninsula of [[Trinidad]].

The passage was named by Christopher Columbus on his [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|third voyage]].&lt;ref name="Eric"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Eric|title=History of the People of Trinidad and Tobago|date=1942|publisher=Eworld Inc.|location=Buffalo|isbn=9781617590108|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bratislava Riverfront''' ({{lang-sk|Bratislavské nábrežie}}) is a [[riverfront]] on the river [[Danube]] located on the [[Old Town, Bratislava|Old Town]] side of [[Bratislava]], [[Slovakia]]. It extends from the Karloveská bay near the [[Lafranconi Bridge]] to the [[Port of Bratislava]] and [[Prístavný most|Harbour Bridge]]. In the past, the riverfront included the Coronation Hill, where the newly crowned [[King of Hungary|Kings of Hungary]] would recite an [[oath]] and make crosses with their [[sword]] in four cardinal directions to show their resolution to defend the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://spectator.sme.sk/c/20040372/maria-theresas-coronation-re-enacted-in-bratislava.html|title=Maria Theresa’s coronation re-enacted in Bratislava|publisher=The Slovak Spectator|date=4 July 2011|accessdate=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hill was demolished in 1870 when the shores of the Danube were strengthened. 

Bratislava Riverfront is a [[tourist attraction]] as well as a leisure area for the citizens of Bratislava.

== Location and division ==
The [[riverfront]] begins near the garden of the Bratislava Water Company in the [[Karlova Ves]] borough of Bratislava and runs along the [[Danube]] up to the [[Prístavný most|Harbour Bridge]]. It is divided into four sections.
* From Karloveská bay to the [[Lafranconi Bridge]]. Named Nábrežie Ľubomíra Kadnára, it consists partially of a [[bike path]] and partially of a narrow dirt road winding through the semi-preserved [[riparian forests]]. The area features the Museum of the Bratislava Water Company, the [[Botanical Garden of the Comenius University]] and the canalised outlet of the river [[Vydrica (river)|Vydrica]]. The area also features a complex of water sports facilities (especially [[kayaking]]) with many local sports clubs present here.
* From the [[Lafranconi Bridge]] to the [[Starý most|Old Bridge]]. It consists of the streets Dvořákovo nábrežie, Rázusovo nábrežie and Fajnorovo nábrežie and features a broad walkway with benches, tree alleys and statues. The area includes the Faculty of Physical Education and Sports of the [[Comenius University]], the [[Park kultúry a oddychu]], the [[River Park (Bratislava)|River Park]] complex, the [[Chatam Sofer Memorial]], the Bratislava Passenger Port and many monuments of the [[Old Town, Bratislava|Old Town]] of Bratislava.
* From the [[Starý most|Old Bridge]] to the [[Apollo Bridge]]. It consists of the [[Eurovea]] complex and an empty space waiting for the Eurovea Phase 2 construction to begin. It features two artificial pedestrian piers and the culturally protected building of Warehouse No. 7. 
* From the [[Apollo Bridge]] up to a few dozen meters behind the [[Prístavný most|Harbour Bridge]]. Part of the [[Port of Bratislava]], not officially accessible. It is industrial in character and features numerous protected cultural monuments. 

== History ==
In 2010, a new anti-flood wall was constructed along parts of the riverbank to protect Bratislava from periodic floods on the river [[Danube]]. At the same time, part of the riverbank from the [[Most SNP|New Bridge]] to the Passenger Port was reconstructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bratislava.sk/nova-tvar-dunajskeho-nabrezia/d-11023583/p1=11050198|title=Nová tvár dunajského nábrežia (New Face of the Danube Riverbank)|publisher=City of Bratislava|date=27 January 2010|accessdate=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Buell Seamount''' is a [[seamount]] in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. It is part of the [[New England Seamounts]], which was active more than 100 million years ago. It was formed when the [[North American Plate]] moved over the [[New England hotspot]].&lt;ref name="NOAA2"&gt;{{cite web | title = Geological Origin of the New England Seamount Chain | work = National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration | publisher = U.S. Department of Commerce | year = 2005 | url = http://www.oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/explorations/03mountains/background/geology/geology.html | accessdate = 2007-09-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Philippines]] has five types of [[climate]]s: [[tropical rainforest climate|tropical rainforest]], [[tropical savanna climate|tropical savanna]], [[tropical monsoon climate|tropical monsoon]], [[humid subtropical climate|humid subtropical]], and [[oceanic climate|oceanic]] (both are in higher-altitude areas) characterized by relatively high temperature, oppressive humidity and plenty of rainfall.  There are two [[seasons]] in the country, the wet season and the dry season, based upon the amount of rainfall.&lt;ref name="Seasons" /&gt;  This is also dependent on location in the country as some areas experience rain all throughout the year (see [[#Climate types|Climate types]]).  Based on temperature, the warmest months of the year are March through October; the winter [[East Asian Monsoon|monsoon]] brings cooler air from November to February. May is the warmest month, and January, the coolest.{{sfn|Coronas|1920}} 

Weather in the Philippines is monitored and managed by [[Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration]] (PAGASA).

==Rainfall==
[[Monsoon]]s are large-scale sea breezes which occur when the temperature on land is significantly warmer or cooler than the temperature of the ocean. Most summer monsoons have a dominant westerly component and a strong tendency to ascend and produce copious amounts of rain (because of the condensation of water vapor in the rising air). The intensity and duration, however, are not uniform from year to year. Winter monsoons, by contrast, have a dominant easterly component and a strong tendency to diverge, subside and cause drought. 

The summer monsoon brings heavy rains to most of the archipelago from May to October.  Annual average rainfall ranges from as much as {{convert|5000|mm|in|0}} in the mountainous east coast section of the country, to less than {{convert|1000|mm|in|0}} in some of the sheltered valleys. Monsoon rains, although hard and drenching, are not normally associated with high winds and waves.
   
At least 30&amp;nbsp;percent of the annual rainfall in the northern Philippines can be traced to tropical cyclones, while the southern islands receiving less than 10&amp;nbsp;percent of their annual rainfall from tropical cyclones.  The wettest known tropical cyclone to impact the archipelago was the July 1911 cyclone, when the total precipitation for Baguio was distributed over the four days as: 14th&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;{{convert|879.8|mm|in|abbr=on|1}}, 15th&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;{{convert|733.6|mm|in|abbr=on|1}}, 16th&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;{{convert|424.9|mm|in|abbr=on|1}}, 17th&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;{{convert|200.4|mm|in|abbr=on|1}};{{sfn|Coronas|1920|p=110}}&lt;ref name="bag"&gt;Glossary of Meteorology. [http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/browse?s=b&amp;p=4 Baguio.] Retrieved on 2008-06-11.&lt;/ref&gt; followed by extraordinary drought from October 1911 to May 1912, so that the annual amount of those two years were hardly noticeable.

==Typhoons==
{{Main|Typhoons in the Philippines}}
{{Philippine Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale}}
The Philippines sit across the [[typhoon belt]], making dangerous storms from July through October. These are especially hazardous for northern and eastern [[Luzon]] and the [[Bicol Region|Bicol]] and [[Eastern Visayas]] regions, but Manila gets devastated periodically as well.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} ''Bagyo'' is the Filipino term to any [[tropical cyclone]] in the Philippine Islands.&lt;ref name="bag"/&gt;  From the statistics gathered by PAGASA from 1948 to 2004, around an average of 28 storms and/or typhoons per year enter the PAR (Philippine Area of Responsibility) – the designated area assigned to PAGASA to monitor during weather disturbances.  Those that made landfall or crossed the Philippines, the average was nine per year.  In 1993, a record 19 typhoons made landfall in the country making it the most in one year.  The fewest per year were 4 during the years 1955, 1958, 1992 and 1997.&lt;ref name="Typhoon"&gt;Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration. "[http://kidlat.pagasa.dost.gov.ph/cab/statfram.htm Tropical Cyclone Statistics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525212029/http://kidlat.pagasa.dost.gov.ph/cab/statfram.htm |date=2013-05-25 }}". Retrieved on 2010-06-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

PAGASA categorises typhoons into five types according to wind speed. Once a tropical cyclone enters the PAR, regardless of strength, it is given a [[Lists of tropical cyclone names#Philippines|local name]] for identification purposes by the media, government, and the general public.&lt;ref name="AOML FAQ B2"&gt;{{cite web | author = [[Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory]], [[Hurricane]] Research Division | title = Frequently Asked Questions: What are the upcoming tropical cyclone names? | publisher = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]] | accessdate = 2006-12-11 | url = http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/B2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Public Storm Warning System (PSWS) ===
{{Philippine Tropical Cyclone Signals}}

For the past ten years, the Philippines has experienced a number of extremely damaging tropical cyclones, particularly typhoons with more than {{convert|20|km/h|mph kn m/s|abbr=on}} of sustained winds. Because of this, the Super Typhoon ('''STY''') category with more than {{convert|220|km/h|mph kn m/s|abbr=on}} maximum sustained winds was officially adopted by the PAGASA. However, according to different stakeholders, the extensive and devastating damages caused by strong typhoons such as Typhoon Yolanda in 2013 made the four{{nbhyph}}level warning system inadequate.

==Strongest typhoons==

=== Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda) ===
The deadliest typhoon to impact the Philippines was [[Typhoon Haiyan]], locally known as Yolanda, in November 2013, in which more than 6,300 lives were lost from its storm surges and powerful winds. Over 1,000 went missing and nearly 20,000 were injured.  Winds reached {{convert|315|km/h|mph kn m/s|abbr=on}} in one–minute sustained and may have been the strongest storm in history in terms of wind speeds as wind speeds before the 1970s were too high to record.

=== Typhoon Angela (Rosing) ===
Back in 1995, where [[Typhoon Angela]], known as Rosing was an extremely catastrophic category 5 typhoon that made landfall in Catanduanes and made across Manila. Winds reached 290 km/h (180 mph) on one-minute sustain winds. Rosing took 936 lives and the most powerful typhoon that ever hit Metro Manila.

=== Typhoon Bopha (Pablo) ===
On late December 3, 2012, [[Typhoon Bopha]] or known as Pablo made [[landfall]] on Eastern Mindanao, damage was over 1.04 billion USD by winds of 280 km/h (175 mph) on one-minute sustain winds. Typhoon Bopha was the most powerful typhoon ever hit Mindanao, killing 1,067 people and 834 people were missing. Most of the damage was caused by rushing storm surges and screaming winds.

=== Typhoon Megi (Juan)===
In terms of central pressure, [[Typhoon Megi (2010)]] measured 885 mb. This was the strongest storm ever to make landfall in terms of pressure. 

It was 295 kph (185 mph) in terms of one-minute sustained winds, killing 67 people and costing over 700 million USD in damage.

==Temperature==

The average year-round temperature measured from all the weather stations in the Philippines, except [[Baguio City]], is {{convert|26.6|C|1}}. Cooler days are usually felt in the month of January with temperature averaging at {{convert|25.5|C|1}} and the warmest days, in the month of May with a mean of {{convert|28.3|C|1}}.&lt;ref name=Seasons /&gt; Elevation factors significantly in the variation of temperature in the Philippines. In Baguio City, with an elevation of {{convert|1,500| m|ft|abbr=on|-2}} above sea level, the mean average is {{convert|18.3|°C}} or cooler by about {{convert|4.3|C-change|0}}.  In 1915, a one-year study was [[conducted]] by [[William H. Brown]] of the Philippine Journal of Science on top of [[Mount Banahaw]] at {{convert|2,100| m|abbr=on|-2}} elevation.  The mean temperature measured was {{convert|18.6|°C}}, a difference of {{convert|10| C-change|0}} from the lowland mean temperature.{{sfn|Coronas|1920|p=53}}

==Humidity==

Relative humidity is high in the Philippines.  A high amount of moisture or vapor in the air makes hot temperatures feel hotter.  This quantity of moisture is due to different factors – the extraordinary [[evaporation]] from the seas that surrounds the country on all sides, to the different [[prevailing winds]] in the different seasons of the year, and finally, to the abundant rains so common in a tropical country. The first may be considered as general causes of the great humidity, which is generally observed in all the islands throughout the year.  The last two may influence the different degree of humidity for the different months of the year and for the different regions of the archipelago.{{sfn|Coronas|1920|p=125}}

==Seasons==

The climate of the country is divided into two main seasons: 
# the rainy season, from June to the early part of October; 
# the dry season, from the later part of October to May. The dry season may be subdivided further into (a) the cool dry season, from the later part of October to February; and (b) the hot dry season, from March to May.&lt;ref name=Seasons /&gt; The months of April and May, the hot and dry months when schools are on their long break between academic years, is referred to as [[summer]] while in most of the [[northern Hemisphere|northern hemisphere]] those months are part of [[Spring (season)|spring]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

'''Croatian Littoral''' ({{lang-hr|Hrvatsko primorje}}) is a historical name (period of Austro-Hungarian Monarchy) [[littoral]] for the region of [[Croatia]] comprising mostly Kvarner coastal area between traditional [[Dalmatia]] to the south, [[Mountainous Croatia]] to the north and east, and [[Istria]] and the [[Kvarner Gulf]] of the [[Adriatic Sea]] to the west. The term "Croatian Littoral" developed relatively recently, since the 18th and 19th centuries, reflecting the complex development of Croatia in historical and geographical terms. The term Croatian Littoral is also applied to entire Adriatic coast of modern Croatia in general terms, which is then divided into the [[Dalmatia|Southern Croatian Littoral]] comprising Dalmatia, and the [[Northern Croatian Littoral]] comprising Istria and Croatian Littoral in the strict meaning of the term. Croatian Littoral covers {{convert|2830|km2|abbr=off}} and has a population of 228,725. More than half the region's population lives in the city of [[Rijeka]]—by far the largest urban centre in the area.

The foothills of mountains that form the northeast boundary of the region, as well as [[List of islands in the Adriatic|islands]] in the Kvarner Gulf, are a part of the [[Dinaric Alps]], making [[karst]] topography especially prominent in the Croatian Littoral. The Cres&amp;nbsp;– Lošinj and Krk&amp;nbsp;– Rab [[island chain]]s divide the Kvarner Gulf into four distinct areas—[[Rijeka Bay]], Kvarner ([[sensu stricto]]), [[Kvarnerić]], and [[Vinodol Channel]]. The Cres&amp;nbsp;– Lošinj group also includes the inhabited islands of [[Ilovik]], [[Susak]], [[Unije]], [[Vele Srakane]], and [[Male Srakane]], as well as a larger number of small uninhabited islands. [[Zadar Archipelago]] extends to the southeast of the island group. Water significantly contributed to the geomorphology of the area, especially in the [[Bay of Bakar]], a [[ria]] located between Rijeka and [[Kraljevica]]. The most significant inland bodies of water in the region are the {{convert|17.5|km|abbr=off|adj=on}} long [[Rječina]] River and [[Lake Vrana (Cres)|Lake Vrana]] on the island of Cres.

The region saw frequent changes to its ruling powers since [[classical antiquity]], including the  [[Roman Empire]], the [[Ostrogoths]], the [[Kingdom of the Lombards|Lombards]], the [[Byzantine Empire]], the [[Frankish Empire]], and the [[Kingdom of Croatia (medieval)|Croats]], some of whose major historical heritage originates from the area—most notably the [[Baška tablet]]. The region and adjacent territories became a point of contention between major European powers, including the [[Republic of Venice]], the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], and the [[Habsburg Empire|Habsburg]] and [[Ottoman Empire]]s, as well as [[Austrian Empire|Austria]], the [[First French Empire]], the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]], and [[Yugoslavia]].

Croatian Littoral is a [[List of regions of Croatia|geographical region]] of [[Croatia]] comprising the area between [[Dalmatia]] to the south, [[Mountainous Croatia]] to the north and east, and [[Istria]] and the [[Kvarner Gulf]] of the [[Adriatic Sea]] to the west.

[[File:Trsat.jpg|thumb|left|[[Trsat Castle]] in [[Rijeka]]]]
Since [[classical antiquity]], the area around Kvarner Bay has been characterized as a meeting point of diverse cultures—from [[Culture of Greece|Hellenic]] and [[Culture of ancient Rome|Roman]] cultures, through the [[Middle Ages]] and a succession of various rulers, to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Kvarner Tourist Board|url=http://www.kvarner.hr/kultura/english/index.html|title=Cultural heritage on Kvarner|accessdate=21 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This blending is reflected in the [[folklore]] of the area, including [[Zvončari]]—bell-ringers best known for annual pageant in [[Kastav]], listed on [[UNESCO]]'s [[Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?pg=00011&amp;RL=00243|title=Annual carnival bell ringers' pageant from the Kastav area|accessdate=21 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crossbowmen from Rab are a [[living history]] company [[Historical reenactment|reenacting]] an [[arbalest]] tournament first held in 1364 to commemorate the successful defence of the island using that weapon. A typical decorative motif used in the region is ''morčić'' (plural: ''morčići'')—a dark skinned [[Moors|Moor]] used as a centerpiece on [[jewelry]], usually earrings. Legend has it that the motif is related to a hypothesized battle between Croatian and Ottoman armies on Grobnik north of Rijeka, but it is more likely that it is of Venetian origin, as it is similar to the Venetian ''moretti'' motif, used mostly on brooches and pins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Kvarner Tourist Board|url=http://www.kvarner.hr/kultura/english/ethnographic.html|title=Ethnographic timeline|author=Mirjana Kos-Nalis|accessdate=21 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest architectural heritage of the region includes [[ruins]] of Roman and Byzantine buildings throughout the area and early medieval Croatian burial grounds in the Vinodol area. There are preserved examples of the [[Romanesque architecture]] on the island of Krk, in Vinodol, and in the Kastav area—largely churches, monasteries, and fortifications such as [[Drivenik Castle]]. Several preserved examples of [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] churches exist on the mainland, but during the [[Renaissance]], construction largely consisted of fortifications because of the Ottoman conquest of the hinterland of the region. The most powerful noblemen in the region, the [[House of Zrinski]] and the [[House of Frankopan]], built numerous castles in the area. They include the castles of [[Trsat Castle|Trsat]], Grobnik, [[Bakar]], [[Kraljevica]], Ledenice, [[Bribir, Primorje-Gorski Kotar County|Bribir]], [[Hreljin Castle|Hreljin]], [[Grižane Castle|Grižane]], Novi Vinodolski, [[Krk (town)|Krk]], Drivenik and Gradec near [[Vrbnik]]. The most representative piece of [[Baroque architecture]] is the [[Rijeka Cathedral|St. Vitus Cathedral]] in Rijeka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Kvarner Tourist Board|url=http://www.kvarner.hr/kultura/english/architectural.html|title=Architectural heritage|author1=Marijan Bradanović|author2=Daina Glavočić|accessdate=21 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The region was birthplace or home to several writers who made their marks in [[Croatian literature|Croatian]], [[Italian literature|Italian]], and [[Austrian literature]]. These include [[Ivan Mažuranić]]—one of the foremost authors of Croatian literature in the first half of the 19th century—[[Janko Polić Kamov]], [[Ödön von Horváth]], and many others. [[Chakavian dialect]], spoken in the region, is widely present in the works of poets born or living in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Kvarner Tourist Board|url=http://www.kvarner.hr/kultura/english/literature.html|title=A reader's guide to Kvarner|author=Velid Đekić|accessdate=21 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most significant artist from the region is [[Juraj Julije Klović]] ({{lang-it|Giorgio Giulio Clovio}})—a 16th-century [[miniaturist]], [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminator]], and artist born in [[Grižane-Belgrad|Grižane]] in Vinodol. 20th-century artists born or active in the region are [[Romolo Venucci]], [[Jakov Smokvina]], [[Vladimir Udatny]], [[Antun Haller]], [[Ivo Kalina]], [[Vjekoslav Vojo Radoičić]], and many others. Churches and monasteries in the region treasure a great number of works of art. These include a 1535 altar [[polyptych]] by [[Girolamo da Santacroce]] in the [[Franciscan]] monastery on [[Košljun]] island, while a [[Paolo Veneziano]] polyptych from [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] abbey in [[Jurandvor]] near [[Baška]] is in the collection of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Krk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Kvarner Tourist Board|url=http://www.kvarner.hr/kultura/english/visual.html|title=A panoramic survey of visual arts|author=Nataša Šegota Lah|accessdate=21 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Geographical name changes in Turkey''' have been undertaken, periodically, in bulk from 1913 to the present by [[Turkish government|successive Turkish governments]]. Thousands of names within the [[Turkish Republic]] or the [[Ottoman Empire]] have lost or departed from their popular or historic alternatives in favour of recognizably [[Turkish language|Turkish]] names, as part of the [[Turkification]] policy. The governments have argued that such names are foreign or divisive. Names changed were usually of [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Georgian language|Georgian]] (Including [[Laz language|Laz]]), [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], [[Zazaki]], [[Assyrian/Syriac people|Assyrian]], or [[Arabic language|Arabic]] origin.

Turkey's [[Accession of Turkey to the European Union|efforts to join]] the [[European Union]] in the early 21st century have led to a decrease in the incidence of such changes from local, and particularly the central government. In some cases legislation has restored the names of certain villages (primarily those housing [[Kurds|Kurdish]] and [[Zazas|Zaza]] minorities). Place names that have formally changed frequently persist in local dialects and languages throughout the ethnically diverse country.

The policy commenced during the final years of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and continued into the [[Turkish Republic]]. Under the [[Kemalist]] oriented government, specialized governmental commissions were created for the purpose of changing names. Approximately 28,000 topographic names were changed, which included 12,211 village and town names and 4,000 mountain, river, and other topographic names. Most name changes occurred in the eastern regions of the country where minority ethnicities form a large part or a majority of the population. Policies at times included banning the use of foreign names that were considered divisive and inappropriate.
[[File:Enverpascha.jpg|thumb|[[Enver Pasha]] issued an edict in 1916 that all place names originating from non-Muslim peoples would be changed]]

{{hatnote|For changes throughout Turkey's recorded history before 1913 see individual geographical articles such as [[Istanbul#Toponymy|Istanbul]].}}

=== Ottoman Empire ===
The [[Committee of Union and Progress]] took the reins of the Ottoman government through a [[1913 Ottoman coup d'état|coup d'état]] in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Naimark|first=Norman M.|title=Fires of hatred: ethnic cleansing in twentieth-century Europe|year=2002|publisher=Harvard Univ.

Enver Pasha did not change the geographical names belonging to Muslim minorities (i.e. [[Arabs]] and [[Kurds]]) due to the Ottoman government's role as a [[Caliphate]].&lt;ref name="Turkification of the Toponyms"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sahakyan|first=Lusine|title=Turkification of the Toponyms in the Ottoman Empire and the Republic of Turkey|year=2010|publisher=Arod Books|location=Montreal|isbn=978-0-9699879-7-0|url=http://www.ararat-center.org/upload/files/Toponym_Lusine.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; His decree inspired many Turkish intellectuals to write in support of such measures. One such intellectual, [[Hüseyin Avni Alparslan]] (1877–1921), a Turkish soldier and author of books about Turkish language and culture, was inspired by the efforts of Enver Pasha, writing in his book ''[[Trabzon İli Lâz mı?

It is not known how many geographical names were changed under the ordinance. The ultimate overarching objective behind it failed due to the collapse of the Ottoman government and [[Turkish Courts-Martial of 1919–1920|trials of its leaders]] before Ottoman and European courts for massacres against [[ethnic minorities]] committed in 1915.&lt;ref name="Creating the Turk’s Homeland: Modernization, Nationalism and Geography in Southeast Turkey in the late 19th and 20th Centuries" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Verdict ("Kararname") of the Turkish Military Tribunal|url=http://www.armenian-genocide.org/Affirmation.237/current_category.50/affirmation_detail.html|publisher=Published in theOfficial Gazetteof Turkey(Takvimi Vekayi),no. 3604 (supplement), July 22, 1919|accessdate=12 January 2013|author=Haigazn Kazarian (trans.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, the Turkish government stated in the preface of ''Köylerimiz'', a publication dedicated to names of Turkish villages, that:
{{quote|Approximately 12,000 village names that are non-Turkish, understood to originate from non-Turkish roots, and identified as causing confusion have been examined and replaced with Turkish names, and put into effect by the Substitution Committee for Foreign Names functioning at the Directorate General for Provincial Governments in our Ministry.&lt;ref&gt;Köylerimiz 1981, İçişleri Bakanlığı Yayınlan, Yedigün Matbaası, Ankara, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
{{clear}}
At the culmination of the policy, no geographical or topographical names of non-Turkish origin remained.&lt;ref name="The Hemshin: history, society and identity in the highlands of northeast Turkey" /&gt; Some of the newer names resembled their native names, but with revised Turkish connotations (i.e. Aghtamar was changed to Akdamar).

==Comparative analysis==
Most of the geographical name changes occurred in the eastern provinces of the country and on the coast of the eastern Black Sea, where minority populations tend to live. Through independent study, [[etymology|etymologist]] [[Sevan Nisanyan]] estimates that, of the geographical location name changes, 4,200 were Greek, 4,000 Kurdish, 3,600 Armenian, 750 Arabic, 400 Assyrian, 300 Georgian, 200 Laz, and 50 others.&lt;ref name=Tesev /&gt;&lt;ref name="Adını unutan ülke : Türkiye'de adı değiştirilen yerler sözlüğü" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Social relations in Ottoman Diyarbekir, 1870-1915" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Hemshin: history, society and identity in the highlands of northeast Turkey" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The settlement issue in Turkey and the Kurds" /&gt; The official statistics of ''The Special Commission for Name Change'' (Ad Degistirme Ihtisas Komisyonu) claim that the total number of villages, towns, cities, and settlements renamed is 12,211.&lt;ref name=tuncel /&gt;&lt;ref name="Proceedings of the second" /&gt; The chart below lists the provinces and the number of villages or towns renamed.&lt;ref name=Tuncel&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tuncel |first=Harun |title=Türkiye'de İsmi Değiştirilen Köyler English: Renamed Villages in Turkey |journal=Fırat University Journal of Social Science |year=2000 |volume=10 |issue=2 |url=http://cografya.bilecik.edu.tr/Dosya/Arsiv/Harun%20Tun%C3%A7el%20Makaleler/T%C3%BCrkiye%E2%80%99de%20%C4%B0smi%20De%C4%9Fi%C5%9Ftirilen%20K%C3%B6yler.pdf |accessdate=13 January 2013 |language=tr |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131114102054/http://cografya.bilecik.edu.tr/Dosya/Arsiv/Harun%20Tun%C3%A7el%20Makaleler/T%C3%BCrkiye%E2%80%99de%20%C4%B0smi%20De%C4%9Fi%C5%9Ftirilen%20K%C3%B6yler.pdf |archivedate=14 November 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Norşin ve Kürtçe isimler 99 yıldır yasak" /&gt;

== Notable geographical name changes ==

=== Armenian ===
{{main|Armenian cultural heritage in Turkey}}
Armenian geographic names were first changed under the reign of [[Sultan Abdulhamit II]]. In 1880, the word ''Armenia'' was banned from use in the press, schoolbooks, and governmental establishments, to be replaced with words like Anatolia or Kurdistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} Modern History of Armenia in the Works of Foreign Authors [Novaya istoriya Armenii v trudax sovremennix zarubezhnix avtorov], edited by R.

Most Armenian geographical names were in the eastern provinces of the [[Ottoman empire]]. Villages, settlements, or towns that contain the suffix ''-kert'', meaning built or built by (i.e. Manavazkert (today [[Malazgirt]]), [[Norakert]], [[Dikranagert]], [[Noyakert]]), ''-shen'', meaning village (i.e. [[Aratashen]], [[Pemzashen]], [[Güroymak|Norashen]]), and ''-van'', meaning town (i.e. [[Charentsavan]], [[Nakhchivan (city)|Nakhichevan]], [[Tatvan]]), signify an Armenian name.&lt;ref name="Turkification of the Toponyms" /&gt; Throughout Ottoman history, Turkish and Kurdish tribesmen have settled into Armenian villages and changed the native Armenian names (i.e. the Armenian Norashen was changed to Norşin). This was especially true after the [[Armenian genocide]], when much of eastern Turkey was depopulated of its Armenian population.&lt;ref name="Turkification of the Toponyms" /&gt;

[[Sevan Nişanyan]] estimates that 3,600 Armenian geographical locations have been changed.&lt;ref name=Tesev /&gt;

=== Assyrian ===
Most Assyrian name changes occurred in the southeast of Turkey near the Syrian border in the [[Tur Abdin]] region. The Tur Abdin ({{lang-syr|ܛܘܼܪ ܥܒ݂ܕܝܼܢ}}) is a hilly region incorporating the eastern half of [[Mardin Province]], and [[Şırnak Province]] west of the [[Tigris]], on the border with [[Syria]]. The name 'Tur Abdin' is from the [[Syriac language]] meaning 'mountain of the servants (of God)'. Tur Abdin is of great importance to [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syriac Orthodox]] Christians, for whom the region used to be a monastic and cultural heartland.

===Greek ===
Many of the Greek names have maintained their origins from the [[Byzantine empire]] and [[Empire of Trebizond]] era.

With the establishment of the [[Ottoman empire]], many Turkish name changes have continued to retain their Greek origins. For example, the modern name "İzmir" derives from the former Greek name Σμύρνη "Smyrna", through the first two syllables of the phrase "εις Σμύρνην" (pronounced "is Smirnin"), which means "to Smyrna" in Greek. A similar etymology also applies to other Turkish cities with former Greek names, such as İznik (from the phrase "is Nikaean", meaning "to Nicaea"), Istanbul (from the phrase "is tan Polin" or "to the City"), or even for the Greek island of Kos, called "İstanköy" in Turkish.&lt;ref name="Index Anatolicus" /&gt;

Nişanyan estimates that 4,200 Greek geographical locations have been changed, the most of any ethnic minority.&lt;ref name=Tesev /&gt;

=== Kurdish and Zazaki ===
The Kurdish and Zaza geographical name changes were exempt under the Ottoman Empire due to the Islamic religious orientation of Kurds. During the Republican era and especially after the [[Dersim massacre]], Kurdish and Zaza geographical name changes became more common.&lt;ref name="Turkification of the Toponyms" /&gt; During the Turkish Republican era, the words Kurdistan and Kurds were banned. The Turkish government had disguised the presence of the Kurds and Zazas statistically by categorizing them as ''Mountain Turks''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Metz|first=Federal Research Division, Library of Congress.

'''Mauritius''' is an island of Africa's southeast coast located in the [[Indian Ocean]], east of [[Madagascar]]. It is geologically located within the [[Somali plate]].

== Climate ==
The local [[climate]] is tropical, modified by southeast trade winds; there is a warm, dry winter from May to November and a hot, wet, and humid summer from November to May. [[Anti-cyclone]]s affect the country during May to September.

[[Cyclones]] affect Mauritius or Mauricio during November–April. [[Cyclone Hollanda|Hollanda]] (1994) and [[2001–02 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season|Dina]] (2002) were the worst two last cyclones to have affected the island.

The '''geology of [[Jersey]]''' is characterised by the Late Proterozoic Brioverian volcanics, the [[Cadomian Orogeny]], and only small signs of later deposits from the [[Cambrian]] and [[Quaternary]] periods. The kind of rocks go from conglomerate to shale, volcanic, intrusive and plutonic igneous rocks of many compositions, and metamorphic rocks as well, thus including most major types.

The Brioverian rocks were formed between 900 and 700 mya. They were named after Briovère, the native name for St. Lô, in Normandy, which is the first area these rocks were described from. They start with [[turbidite]]s in the west, centre and south of Jersey, including at [[Saint Ouen, Jersey|St Ouens Bay]], and [[Saint Aubin, Jersey|St Aubin's Bay]]. The Brioverian sedimentary rocks are all well bedded and were originally the mid and outer parts of a [[submarine fan]]. This constitutes the Jersey Shale Formation. The [[shale]] is found at [[Gorey Harbour]] in the east coast, and La Belle Hougue Point, and Le Mont Mado granite has an occurrence. The shale is more easily eroded, and this has affected the shape of the island by the concave St Ouens's Bay and St Aubin's Bay. The deepest valleys (Valley of St. Peter and St. Lawrence) are cut into this soft rock. Other sediments associated with the shale are [[mudstone]], and fine grained [[sandstone]]. Various sedimentary structures include [[flute caste|flute]] and bounce castes, ripple lamination, [[graded bedding]], [[cross bedding]], and [[boudinage]]. The shale layers have been identified as Association IV in the submarine fan.

The sandstone is Association III of the submarine fan.  [[Greywacke]] is termed Association IV along with the shale. It is found in the same areas as the shale. In an analysis of the greywacke it has fragments with 70% [[quartz]], 10% to 15% [[plagioclase]] and [[microcline]] [[feldspar]], 2% dark iron containing minerals, with carbon flakes, in a matrix of 10 to 20% clay. The minerals contained are very diverse indicating a broad source area.  

[[Conglomerate (geology)|Conglomerate]], termed Association I from the upper parts of the fan, is found in lenticular bodies near St Peter's Valley, at Gargate Mill. The pebbles in the conglomerate are of multiple kinds of rock. The granite intrusions at the boundary of the formation have caused metamorphism and intrusion by dykes.

In the L'Êtacq area, the metamorphism has produced spotted [[hornfels]] with a grey colour. The spots are darker, containing [[cordierite]] and [[biotite]]. At St. Ouën's Bay the metamorphosis of greywacke has made hornblende-hornfels. Regional metamorphism has converted the shale to a low [[greenschist facies]], where clay is converted to [[Chlorite group|chlorite]]. 

The interpretation of this area is that is a part of the north facing [[continental slope]] of [[Armorica]] facing a [[subduction]] zone, where the Celtic oceanic plate was converging and descending in the trench. The sediments were carried by rivers from the Le Vast Arc, a strip of land oriented east north east, that lay to the south of Jersey. The sea at this time was termed l' Océan de la Manche.

==Brioverian volcanics==
These sediments were uplifted and are overlaid by volcanic rocks of the Jersey Volcanic Group around 530 Mya. The magma came from the subduction zones below and to the north of the island.  [[Andesite]] from St. Saviour's Andesite Formation is in the centre and in the north at Les Rouaux. It is coloured grey and includes some basalt and pyroclastic fallout such as [[tuff]] and [[agglomerate]]. Porphyritic andesite is dark grey with white crystals of plagioclase feldspar embedded. Outcrops occur on the coast at Giffards Bay on the north coast and Vicard Point on the east coast. The volcanoes were to the north east and south. Vicard Tuff contains bombs. The Long Echet Tuff contains large crystals of quartz and feldspar and strands of quartz. Les Rouaux Agglomerate and L' Homme Mort Agglomerate contain fragments of the surrounding rocks including shale and andesite embedded in a feldspar matrix. The Les Rouaux Agglomerate also contains [[pumice]]. This was eroded before the next phase of volcanism.

Porphoritic [[rhyolite]] of St. John's Rhyolite Formation is found to the north east of the centre. It contains banded flows and ignimbrite. Totally it is 950 meters thick. It contains shards of glass and pumice. Different flows exits with sections called Bonne Nuit Ignimbrite followed by Frémont Ignimbrite on the north coast. They contain xenoliths of the andesite and shale found in Jersey. Also there are local mudstone and conglomerate deposited on the flows. The conglomerate is called L'Homme Mort Conglomerate. 

The Jeffrey's Leap Ignimbrite is overlaid by the Anne Port Ignimbrite named after locations on the east coast. The Trinity Ignimbrite is a purple tuff near Les Grands Vaux, inland.

Fine grained rhyolite of Bouley Rhyolite Formation occurs even further to the north east. This is 430 metres thick. At Giffard Bay are Gifford Rhyolite, Gifford Andesite, Gifford Ignimbrite and Gifford Tuffs. Les Platons Rhyolite top this off. These rocks contain xenoliths and tuff deposits from lakes and streams. The Les Platons Rhyolite contains spherulites. Spherulites are also found at Les Hurets on Bouley Bay. At Bouley Bay there are three units of ignimbrite: the Lower Bouley Ignimbrite, Middle Bouley Ignimbrite and Upper Bouley Ignimbrite. These contain flow banding and spherulites up to 10&amp;nbsp;cm and eutaxitic and [[fiamme|fiamme texture]]s. The Anne Port Rhyolite is the bottom unit on the east coast. This is massive but columnar jointed. It shows flow banding. It resembles the [[Giants Causeway]] at La Crête Point.

Le Havre de Fer Beach has an outcrop of columnar rhyloite that has been separated by faulting from the rest of the units. North of Archirondel Round Tower there are three more flows stacked on top of each other called Archirondel Ignimbrite, Dolmen Ignimbrite and St. Catherine's Ignimbrite. These are separated from each other by layers of tuff, and are coloured maroon by [[hematite]]. They consist of pumice, quartz crystals and feldspar in a feldspar rich matrix.

==Cadomian Orogeny==
Intrusions were formed during the [[Cadomian Orogeny]] between {{Ma|700|500}}. In this orogeny the rocks were first crushed and folded with East West pressure, then later they were compressed in the north south direction. Gabbro is found at Sorel Point. This rock can be observed to transition into diorite by changes in the mineral content and texture. Layered gabbro has also been changed into diorite at Le Nez point, the southernmost point of the main island. The diorite is emplaced at and near Sorel point, and at several places along the south coast east of [[Saint Helier]]. It also is found on the south east tidal rock platform.

Granite intrudes into the north west, south west and south east. The south west granite also includes porphyries and some fine grained sections.

The south west granites are 550 – 480 mya, and has three intrusions. The intrusions are called Corbière Granite, La Moye Granite, and Beau Port Granite.   They are coloured pale to deep red. The north west area was intruded {{Ma|465|426}} with four intrusions. One of these intrusions contained the gabbro and diorite. These granites are coloured grey-pink and orange, with the gabbro a dark grey, and the diorite speckled grey. 

There are also pink and red [[aplite]] veins in the igneous complexes up to 5&amp;nbsp;cm wide. The aplite is the lowest melting remanent of the granite magma, that is poor in volatiles. The aplite minerals include [[tourmaline]], [[topaz]] and [[fluorite]]. At St Brelade's Bay there are two aplogranites: Beau Port Granite and La Moye Granite. This is coloured yellow brown to pink and contains fine crystals of [[perthite]], and [[oligoclase]] and [[quartz]], coloured by [[limonite]]. Other parts more rich in volatiles have formed [[pegmatite]]s featuring [[milky quartz]] and pink [[orthoclase]].

The north west area was intruded {{Ma|465|426}} with four intrusions. The magma came from a volcanic arc. One of these intrusions contained the gabbro and diorite. The granites are coloured grey-pink and orange, with the gabbro a dark grey, and the diorite speckled grey. The main intrusion is the St. Mary's Granite {{Ma|438}}. One other intrusion was an aplogranite called Mont Mado granite, or Red Granite solidified {{Ma|426}}.   This is mostly made from fine grained quartz and Perthite, but is coloured red yellow and brown. A third porphyritic granite is {{Ma|465}}.

The south east granites moved into the south east about the same time. The components here are called [[Fort Regent]]/[[Elizabeth Castle]] Granophyre, Dicq Granite, Longueville Granite, and La Roque Granite.

The plutonic rocks are not foliated, showing that the orogeny was near completion at the time they formed.

==Rozel Conglomerate==

The land here was uplifted and eroded in the Cambrian. A coarse conglomerate known as Rozel Conglomerate was washed in by a flash flood flowing from somewhere to the north of the island during the Cambrian to Ordovician time period. This conglomerate is on the north east cape at Rozel. The pebbles consist of andesite, rhyolite, granite and shale. The pebbles range from 1&amp;nbsp;cm to 60&amp;nbsp;cm, and are quite irregular. The conglomerate bed is above a bed of red sandstone and mudstone which has pits, probably being rain drop marks, and also has polygonal shaped cracks. Apart from the main outcrop, the conglomerate is also found in smaller areas at Les Hurets Valley, west of the Bouley Bay and at La Pierre de Fételle. The conglomerate is estimated to be Ordovician in age.
==Variscan Orogeny==
Sinistral tear faults have affected the rock.

The [[Variscan orogeny|Variscan Orogeny]] left a smaller print on the island, with the intrusion of some dykes, and some folding and jointing that affected the island's rocks including the Rozel Conglomerate. During the [[Mesozoic]] and [[Tertiary]], Jersey was part the north-west edge of [[Armorica]]. The dykes included a swarm of dolerite dykes, also [[lamprophyre]], [[feldspar]] porphyry and aplite.

There is a known acid dyke of rhyolitic composition on the east side of Noirmont headland. This is 1 metre wide and coloured light grey to pink. It has an east-west strike. Porhyritic microgranite dykes occur below Le Saut Jeffroi, and south of Le Mont Orgueil. These have a NNE strike. 

The aplite dykes are one to two metres wide. 

There are two sets of [[lamprophyre]] dykes.  [[Biotite]] lamprophyres (minettes) are oriented in the north west direction. They are coloured brown, and are up to 1 metre wide. They contain orthoclase.  [[Hornblende]] lamprophyre (spessarites) contain plagioclase, coloured light brown and are oriented north-south. A hornblende lamprophyre dyke in the Rozel Conglomerate is dated at {{Ma|435}}.

The Jersey Main Dyke Swarm consists of dolerite dykes intruded into the South East Igneous complex. Some dolerite dykes have a porphyry centre. The strike is north-west, and the direction is vertical. Augite and labradorite are found in these dolerites.

In the north-west there are sills of dolerite.

==Tertiary==
During the Eocene limestone was deposited in the sea around Jersey, but none is actually on the island.

During the Tertiary the surface of the island was a plain at 60 to 130 metres above sea level.

==Quaternary==
The high surface has been eaten into by cliffs dropping down to 8 metres. These have been formed during the Quaternary when the sea level was around 8 metres above the current sea level. There are also raised beaches at 18 and 30 metres above current sea level. During the glacial periods valleys were eroded deeply below the sea level
These raised beaches are found at Portelet Bay, Giffard Bay, and Belcroute Bay.  [[Flint]] is found amongst the pebbles on these beaches, and this is derived from [[chalk]] deposits only found underwater.

La Cotte de St Brelade has a [[Neanderthal]] rock shelter which was inhabited 200000 years ago by hunters of [[woolly mammoth]] and rhinoceros amongst other animals.

During the [[Quaternary]] [[Devensian]] glaciation, [[loess]] was deposited, blown in by wind from the west. The loess has formed thick deposits on the island interior and combined with [[periglacial]] frost shattered rock fragments sliding down the cliffs to form ''head'' which have themselves been eroded to form cliffs from 3 to 12 metres high. At Belcroute there is a more complex deposit of loess head on a raised beach deposit elevated at 8 metres, that sits on another loess deposit. Head occurs at the foot of cliffs along the north, north east and south west sides, and can also be found beneath wind blown sand at the bays of St. Ouen, St. Aubin, St. Clement and the Royal Bay of Grouville. The thickest parts of loess are five metres deep at St Clements and at [[La Hougue Bie]] on the eastern plateau. 

Peat occurs in the valleys. At [[Quetivel Mill]] in St. Peter’s Valley there is peat dated to 7600 BC which contains pollen from boreal forest.

The island was only separated from the continent of Europe by rising sea levels about 5000 BC during the new stone age.

There are several sea caves. A notable cave is the Le Creux du Vis. This cave has a tunnel going in from the beach at the base of the cliff, and a crater shaped opening with steep rocky sides above.

The only fossils date from the Quaternary, and are found in raised beaches, peat and clay.  [[Mammuthus]] primigenius bones have been found at La Cotte de St. Brelade along with deer bones. Mollusk shells are found in the Loess and beach deposits. A submerged forest in St. Ouën's Bay between L'Ouzière slipway and Le Port Slipway has stumps of Birch and Alder ([[Betula]] sp and [[Alnus]] sp) from 1980 BC. Legends record that the sea encroached on the forest in the fifteenth century.

==Economic geology==
At Le Pulec there is a small deposit of lead and zinc that was mined in the late 19th century, but the venture was unsuccessful. There are also some other small unmined mineral veins, such as [[ankerite]], [[molybdenite]] and [[haematite]].

Rocks have been used in [[Neolithic]] times to build [[dolmen]]s. These are found at La Hougue Bie in St. Saviour and Le Mont Ubé dolmen, St. Clément and La Pouquelaye de Faldouet and Le Couperon.

[[Kaolinite|China clay]] quarries used to be in what is now Handois reservoirs. Bricks have also been made from clay from St. Saviour. La [[Société Jersiaise]] is making a brick archive. 
===Quarrying===
[[File:Les cârriéthes dé Ronez Saint Jean Jèrri.jpg|thumb|Ronez Quarry, Saint John]]
Granite quarrying still occurs in three quarries in the north west at Ronez, Gigoulande (by Granite Products company) and La Saline. The La Saline company produces decorative stone for building. The other two quarries produce aggregate for roads and concrete and a product called [[hoggin]]. There are many other disused or abandoned quarries that have been used for stone to make the buildings, castles, and piers on the island.

===Sand===
Sand mining takes place at St. Ouen’s Bay in the west by Simon's Sand and Gravel, and formerly at [[Grouville]] in the east.

===Water===
Ground water is found in rock fractures and to a limited extend in porous rocks, in the upper 40 meters. Ground water is irregular, with some perched aquifers and vertical screens preventing underground flow. The water underground is young (as determined by isotope analysis), replenished from the surface from local rain, and not by underground streams from Normandy.

===Earthquakes===
Earth tremors occur more commonly near Jersey that other areas in the Channel Islands, with magnitudes up to 3. The epicentres are mostly on the sea floor to the west, south and east.

==Study==
La Société Jersiaise&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.societe-jersiaise.org|title=Société Jersiaise - Jersey archaeology, history, natural history and ancient language Société Jersiaise|website=www.societe-jersiaise.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; has a geology section that studies, presents talks, and tours of the Geology of the island.

==Geophysics==
The tidal range is high at 13 meters, exposing a wide rock platform around Jersey.
Western Jersey sedimentary rocks are underlain by shallow granite, and in eastern Jersey there is a high in the gravity field near Grande Charriere, which could be due to gabbro.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Arthur Day: ''Gravity anomalies in the Channel Islands'' Geological Magazine; March 1959; volume 96; number 2; page 89-98&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Great Meteor Seamount''' is the largest [[seamount]] in the North Atlantic (24 000 km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).

Two small seamounts exist located southwest of Great Meteor and encircled by the −3800 m bathymetric line. These are the '''Closs seamount''', roughly oriented NNE-SSW, with its peak at 1400 m depth and covering an area of ~390 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and the '''Small Meteor''', located NNE of Closs, with over 960 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a flat top at −400 m.

The [[Germany|German]] [[research vessel]] ''[[Meteor (1915)|Meteor]]'' discovered the tablemount between 1925 and 1927. It was given the name Great Meteor ''[[Ocean bank (topography)|Bank]]'', a designation still used in the official [[GEBCO]] [[gazetteer]].

==Formation==
The [[New England hotspot]] formed the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]] 124&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;100&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;years ago when the [[North America|North American continent]] was directly overhead. As the continent [[Continental drift|drifted]] to the west, the hotspot gradually moved offshore. On a southeasterly course, the hotspot formed [[Bear Seamount]], the oldest in the chain, about 100&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;103&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;years ago. Over the course of millions of years, it continued creating the rest of the seamounts, eventually culminating in the [[Nashville Seamount]] about 83&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;years ago. As the Atlantic Ocean continued to [[Seafloor spreading|spread]], the hotspot eventually traveled further east, forming the Great Meteor Seamount where it is found today.&lt;ref name="NOAA2"&gt;{{cite web | title = Geological Origin of the New England Seamount Chain | work = [[Office of Ocean Exploration and Research]], [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] | publisher = [[U.S. Department of Commerce]] | year = 2005 | url = http://www.oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/explorations/03mountains/background/geology/geology.html | accessdate = 14 April 2014 }}Revised August 25, 2010 by the Ocean Explorer&lt;/ref&gt; [[Radiometric dating]] of [[basalt]] from the Great Meteor Seamount has given ages of about 11 and 16 million years old, with the bulk of the seamount possibly having formed about 22 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hekinian|first=Roger|last2=Stoffers|first2=Peter|last3=Cheminée|first3=Jean-Louis|title=Oceanic Hotspots: Intraplate Submarine Magmatism and Tectonism|page=116|publisher=[[Springer Nature|Springer]]|year=2012|isbn=978-3-642-62290-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hong Liangji.jpg|thumb|200px|Hong Liangji]]
'''Hong Liangji''' ({{zh|c=洪亮吉|p=Hóng Liàngjí|w='''''Hung Liang-chi'''''}}, 1746–1809), [[courtesy name]]s '''Junzhi''' (君直) and '''Zhicun''' (稚存), was a [[China|Chinese]] [[scholar]], [[politician|statesman]], [[political theorist]], and [[philosopher]]. He was most famous for his critical essay to the [[Jiaqing Emperor]], which resulted in his banishment to [[Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture|Yili]] in [[Xinjiang]]. In modern times, he is best remembered for his essay ''Zhi Ping Pian'' ({{lang|zh|治平篇}}, "On Governance and Well-being of the Empire") on population growth and its sociopolitical consequence, in which he raised many of the same issues that were raised by [[Thomas Robert Malthus|Malthus]] writing during the same period in [[England]].

==Life==
[[File:洪亮吉故居 入口.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Former Residence of Hong Liangji in Changzhou]]Hong was born in [[Changzhou]] and was relatively slow in his accomplishment of the rank of [[Jinshi (imperial examination)|jinshi]], which he finally attained at the age of 44.  He held minor government posts up until his criticism of the [[Jiaqing Emperor]] in the early nineteenth century which focused on the emperor's failure to weed out corrupt officials like [[Heshen]] or reform the bureaucracy that had allowed Heshen to secure power. Although well-intentioned and meant to serve as a call to action, the punishment for his transgression was originally decapitation, and subsequently lessened to banishment. Later, the emperor once more commuted Hong's sentence and pardoned him completely in hopes of ending a drought.

==Philosophy==
Hong was a proponent of the [[New Text Confucianism|New Text]] scholarship, and felt that political remonstrance was part of his [[Confucian]] duty, as many other philosophers of his time did.  He was concerned with such issues as [[population control]], [[geography]], the [[Chinese classics]], and [[government corruption]].  He critically re-evaluated the common Chinese assumption that a growing population was the sign of a good government.

===''Zhi Ping Pian'' and Theory on Population Growth===
Hong's time experienced one of the fastest expansions of population in Chinese history. With the promotion of [[New World]] crops such as corn, Chinese population tripled from 100 million (1651–1661) to 300 million (1790). The population boom resulted in a series of socioeconomic problems, and caused concerns among the Mandarins. In 1791, [[Qianlong Emperor]] expressed his worry to the court officials that the resources might not be able to support the growing population. Two years later, Hong published ''Zhi Ping Pian'', the 26th essay of his anthology ''Opinions'' ({{lang|zh|意言}}).

In ''Zhi Ping Pian'', Hong points to the tension between the growth of the means of subsistence and the growing population. He writes that the tension would be relieved by disasters, famine, and plagues.

{{quote|"Speaking of households, the number of which ...&amp;nbsp;there are 20 times more than a hundred years ago&amp;nbsp;... Some people may propose that there would be wild land to cultivate and spare space for housing. But they can only be doubled or tripled, or at most increased five times, whereas the population at the same time could be ten to twenty times larger. Therefore housing and crop fields tend to be in scarcity, while the population tends to be excessive at all time. Given the fact that some households become monopolists, there is no wonder that so many have suffered cold and hunger and even died here and there&amp;nbsp;... How does Heaven deal with the tension? Flood, drought, and pestilence are the means of Heaven to temper the problem."}}

Hong points out that government can mediate the problem by policies like adjusting tax, encouraging colonization, and enhancing the [[social safety net]]. However, he expresses his concern about the limits of human policy in addressing such an inherent structural dilemma.

==Works==
Hong was a prolific writer, with more than 20 books published, including multiple volumes of essays, prose works and poems. In addition to his philosophical works, Hong was also a noted historian, known for his study of historical geography.

'''ISO 3166-2:BD''' is the entry for [[Bangladesh]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently for Bangladesh, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for two levels of subdivisions:
* [[divisions of Bangladesh|8 divisions]]
* [[districts of Bangladesh|64 districts]]

Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is {{mono|BD}}, the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code of Bangladesh. The second part is either of the following:
* one letter (A&amp;ndash;H): divisions
* two digits (01&amp;ndash;64): districts

==Current codes==
Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA).

'''ISO 3166-2:VE''' is the entry for [[Venezuela]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently for Venezuela, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for [[states of Venezuela|1 federal dependency, 1 federal district, and 23 states]]. The [[Venezuelan Capital District]] contains the central part of the capital of the country [[Caracas]] and has special status equal to the states.

Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is {{mono|VE}}, the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code of Venezuela. The second part is a letter:
* A: federal district
* B&amp;ndash;V (except Q): states as of late 1980s
* W: federal dependency
* X: state created in 1998

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2302">In the [[Byzantine Empire]], a '''''kleisoura''''' ({{lang-el|κλεισούρα}}, "enclosure, defile") was a term traditionally applied to a fortified [[mountain pass]] and the military district protecting it.&lt;ref name="Kazhdan-Ahrweiler"&gt;{{harvnb|Kazhdan|1991|p=1132}}; {{harvnb|Glykatzi-Ahrweiler|1960|pp=1–111}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 7th century, it came to be applied to more extensive frontier districts, distinct from the larger ''[[Theme (Byzantine district)|thema]]ta'', chiefly along the Empire's eastern border with the [[Caliphate]] along the line of the [[Taurus Mountains|Taurus]]-[[Anti-Taurus Mountains|Anti-Taurus]] mountains (in the [[Balkans|West]], only [[Strymon (theme)|Strymon]] was in its early days termed a ''kleisoura'').&lt;ref name="Kazhdan-Ahrweiler"/&gt; A ''kleisoura'' or ''kleisourarchia'' was an autonomous command, under a '''''kleisourarches''''' (Greek: κλεισουράρχης). Eventually, most ''kleisourai'' were raised to full ''themata'', and the term fell out of use after the 10th century (in late Byzantine times, ''[[droungos]]'' had a similar meaning). Its [[Islam]]ic counterpart in [[Cilicia]] and [[Al Jazira, Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia]] was the ''[[thughur|al-thughūr]]''.&lt;ref name="Kazhdan-Ahrweiler"/&gt;

The '''Kula-Farallon Ridge''' was an ancient [[mid-ocean ridge]] that existed between the [[Kula Plate|Kula]] and [[Farallon Plate|Farallon]] plates in the [[Pacific Ocean]] during the [[Jurassic]] period. There was a small piece of this ridge off the [[Pacific Northwest]] 43 million years ago. The rest of the ridge has since been [[subduction|subducted]] beneath [[Alaska]]. 

In its early stages of development, the Kula-Farallon Ridge sheared pieces of oceanic rock off the coast of [[California]]. When the Kula–Farallon Ridge was in the area where [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] and [[Oregon]] are now, [[basalt]]ic [[lava]] erupted there. Some of the basaltic lava is now part of the [[Olympic Peninsula]].

'''L'Île-aux-Marins''' (literally "The Island of the Sailors"; before 1931 called ''Île-aux-Chiens'', literally "Island of the Dogs") is a small island in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. It is located off the coast of [[Saint-Pierre and Miquelon]] and was a [[Communes of France|commune]] until 1945, when it was annexed by the commune of [[Saint-Pierre, Saint-Pierre and Miquelon|Saint-Pierre]]. It is {{convert|1500|m|mi}} long and its width varies from {{convert|100|to(-)|400|m|ft}}. The highest point, Cape Beaudry, is only {{convert|35|m|ft}} [[above mean sea level]].

It was settled in 1604 and once had a population approaching 700.&lt;ref&gt;Tourist Guide Saint-Pierre &amp; Miquelon, 2012 ed., pg. 53&lt;/ref&gt; It has had no permanent population since 1965 when the last families left for [[Saint Pierre Island]], although a small number of people live there on a seasonal basis from May to November. It is also a [[ghost town]]: several unique buildings still stand, such as the [[Church (building)|Church]], the Jézéquel house, the cemetery, a number of fisherman's homes, and the Archipélitude Museum located in the town's only school. The bow section of the wrecked ship ''[[Transpacific (ships)|Transpacific]]'' is on the northern side of the island and is accessible.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23921">'''Landscape archaeology''' is the study of the ways in which people in the past constructed and used the environment around them. Landscape archaeology is inherently multidisciplinary in its approach to the study of culture, and is used by pre-historical, classic, and historic archaeologists. The key feature that distinguishes landscape archaeology from other archaeological approaches to sites is that there is an explicit emphasis on the sites' relationships between material culture, human alteration of land/cultural modifications to landscape, and the natural environment. The study of landscape archaeology (also sometimes referred to as the [[archaeology]] of the [[cultural landscape]]) has evolved to include how landscapes were used to create and reinforce [[social inequality]] and to announce one's [[social status]] to the community at large.

==Introduction==
[[Landscape]] generally refers to both natural environments and environments constructed by human beings.&lt;ref name="Nicole"&gt;Branton, Nicole (2009) Landscape Approaches in Historical Archaeology: The Archaeology of Places. In International Handbook of Historic Archaeology, Majewski, Teresita and David Gaimster, eds. Springer:&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Natural landscape]]s are considered to be environments that have not been altered by humans in any shape or form.&lt;ref name="Hood"&gt;Hood, Edward J. (1996)  "Social Relations and the Cultural Landscape". In Landscape Archaeology:Reading and Interpreting the American Historical Landscape. Yamin, Rebecca and Karen Bescherer Metheny, eds. Knoxville:The University of Tennessee Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Cultural landscapes, on the other hand, are environments that have been altered in some manner by people (including temporary structures and places, such as campsites, that are created by human beings).&lt;ref name="Wood"&gt;Spencer-Wood, Suzanne M. and Sherene Baugher. (2010) "Introduction to the Historical Archaeology of Powered Cultural Landscapes." International Journal of Historical Archaeology 14, pp. 463-474.&lt;/ref&gt; Among archaeologists, the term landscape can refer to the meanings and alterations people mark onto their surroundings.&lt;ref name="Wood" /&gt;&lt;ref name="garden" /&gt;  As such, landscape archaeology is often employed to study the human use of land over extensive periods of time.&lt;ref name="garden"&gt;Gleason, Kathryn L. (1994). "To Bound and to Cultivate: An Introduction to the Archaeology of Gardens and Fields. In The Archaeology of Garden and Field. Miller, Naomi F. and Kathryn L. Gleason, eds. Philadelphia:University of Pennsylvania Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erika Martin Seibert. [http://www.nps.gov/nr/publications/guidance/NR_workshop_3-11-09/Archeol_and_landscapes_Erika.doc "Archaeology and Landscape"], Accessed December 12, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Landscape archaeology can be summed up by Nicole Branton's statement: 
:"the landscapes in landscape archaeology may be as small as a single household or garden or as large as an empire", and "although resource exploitation, class, and power are frequent topics of landscape archaeology, landscape approaches are concerned with spatial, not necessarily ecological or economic, relationships. While similar to [[settlement archaeology]] and ecological archaeology, landscape approaches model places and spaces as dynamic participants in past behavior, not merely setting (affecting human action), or artifact (affected by human action)".&lt;ref name="Nicole" /&gt;

The term space has commonly been used in place of cultural landscape to describe landscapes that are "produced or mediated by human behavior to elicit certain behaviors".&lt;ref name="James"&gt;Delle, James A.  (1998) An Archaeology of Social Space: Analyzing Coffee Plantations in Jamaica's Blue Mountains. Plenum Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Defined in this manner, archaeologists, such as Delle, have theorized space as composed of three components: the material, social, and cognitive.&lt;ref name="James" /&gt; Material space is any space that is created by people either through physical means or through the establishment of definitions, descriptions and rules of what a space is reserved for and how it should be used (Delle 1998:38). Social space is what dictates a person’s relationship with both others and the material space (Delle 1998:39).   Social space is how one uses their material space to interact with others and navigate throughout their world. Cognitive space is how people comprehend their social and material spaces—it is how people understand the world around them and identify appropriate ways of conducting themselves in the many different environments they may occupy (Delle 1998:38-9). Alternatively, the terms constructed, conceptualized, and ideational have been used to describe: the constructed ways in which people engage with their environments, meanings and interactions people place onto specific landscapes, and imagined and emotional perspectives individuals place with their landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;Knapp, Bernard A. and Wendy Ashmore (1999). "Archaeological Landscapes: Constructed, Conceptualized, Ideational". In Archaeologies of Landscape. Ashmore, Wendy and A. Bernard Knapp, eds. Malden:Blackwell Publishers Inc: pp. 1-30.; 10-12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis of landscapes==
Many methods used to analyze archaeological sites are relevant to the analysis of landscapes. The archaeology of landscapes incorporates multiple research methods into its analysis in order to ensure that multiple sources of information are gathered; allowing for a sound interpretation of the site in question. These methods include [[pollen analysis]], [[Geographic Information Systems]], soil sampling, faunal analysis, ground penetrating radar, archival data (including maps and census data), and of course archaeological excavation methods.&lt;ref name="Baugher"&gt;Baugher, Sherene and Lu Ann De Cunzo. (2002) “Archaeological Perspectives on and Contributions to the Study of Colonial American Gardens.”  Landscape Journal 21.2-02&lt;/ref&gt;  Pollen, soil, faunal, and floral analysis allows the archaeologist to understand the natural vegetation of an area, vegetation that was actively grown by area settlers, and the animal life that also lived in the area. An understanding of the plant and animal life specific to an area can lead to, for example, an analysis of the types of food available to members of the community, an understanding of the actual diet typical for a subset of a population,&lt;ref&gt;McKee, Larry. (1999). "Food Supply and Plantation Social Order: An Archaeological Perspective." In I, Too, Am America: Archaeological Studies of African-American Life. Theresa A. Singleton, ed. Charlottesville:University Press of Virginia&lt;/ref&gt; and site and skeletal dating.&lt;ref name="King" /&gt;  If landscape reconstruction and preservation, in particular, is a goal of an archaeological research project, pollen and soil analysis can aide in landscape archaeology to accurately interpret and reconstruct landscapes of the past (Schoenwetter pg 278).

Advances in survey technology have permitted the rapid and accurate analysis of wide areas, making the process an efficient way of learning more about the historic environment. Global Positioning System, remote sensing, archaeological geophysics, Total stations and digital photography, as well as [[Geographic information system|GIS]], have helped reduce the time and cost involved in such work.

* [[Geographic Information Systems]]
:Geographic Information Systems, commonly referred to as GIS, provides a way in which archaeologists can visually represent archaeological data, and can be done in two ways: data visualization and representative visualization.&lt;ref name="McCoy"&gt;McCoy, Mark D. and Thegn N. Ladefoged (2009). New Developments in the Use of Spatial Technology in Archaeology. Journal of Archaeological Research 17:pp.263-295.&lt;/ref&gt;

:[[Viewshed Analysis]] has aided in the archaeologists ability to study behavioral relationships between humans, their landscape, and material culture, in order to study migration, settlement patterns, and agency. Viewshed analysis also provides means with which archaeologists can recreate through an ability to recreate the line of sights possible from one point on a landscape and to situate a person within a defined landscape.&lt;ref name="McCoy" /&gt;
 
*[[Ground Penetrating Radar]]
*[[Global Positioning System]]
*[[remote sensing|Remote Sensing]]
*[[archaeological geophysics|Archaeological Geophysics]]
*[[Total station|Total Station]]
*Excavation
:[[Excavation (archaeology)|Site excavation]] has the potential to uncover building methods, such as the findings of [[posthole]]s (which can mark the previous existence of fence lines or other site boundaries), timber, stones, and/or brick that marks the existence of man-made structures.

:Archaeological [[Feature (archaeology)|feature]]s often leave [[Earthworks (Archaeology)|earthworks]] - signs of some type of modification to the natural environment that often appear as [[cropmark]]s, soil marks, or even as [[plough]] marks in fields that, if historical, can indicate cultivation methods of the past, or, particularly if more recent, can lift archaeological material to the surface and, therefore, ruin the [[Stratification (archeology)|stratigraphic layering]] of materials from youngest to oldest). Features can be discovered by archaeologists both through excavation and through [[Archaeological field survey|field survey]].
  
*[[Archive|Archival Data]] is used by any archaeologists that have any written texts available to them, and is used in a multiple number of ways, depending on the research project and objective of the research and the data available in the archives. Archives are often employed to confirm archaeological findings, to understand the construction of a site, settlement patterns,.
* Pollen Analysis
:[[Pollen analysis]] has allowed archaeologists to analyze vegetation selectively cultivated by area residents, the “native vegetation” of a particular area, and allow archaeologists to map out land use over time (which can be ascertained from weeds&lt;ref name="Kelso"&gt;Kelso, Gerald K. and Mary C. Beaudry (1990). Pollen Analysis and Urban Land Use: The Environs of Scottow's Dock in the 17th, 18th, and Early 19th Century Boston. Historical Archaeology 24(1):pp. 61;62;65;75&lt;/ref&gt;). But collecting a suitable sample is not all that easy. Failure to collect a suitable sample can be due in part to not sampling from areas where suitable pollen samples can be gathered (e.g. lakes and bogs, sites that were sufficiently exposed to air-borne pollen, sites that had both a long exposure to air and are deeply buried into the ground), or because pollen is vulnerable to destruction by the oxidation process or soil microbes such as bacteria and fungi, it negatively impacts an archaeologist’s ability to collect a suitable pollen sample.&lt;ref name="King"&gt;King, James E., Walter E. Klippel, and Rose Duffield (1975). Pollen Preservation and Archaeology in Eastern North America. American Antiquity 40(2):pp. 180-190.&lt;/ref&gt;

:Gerald K. Kelso and Mary C. Beaudry demonstrate how “…changes in the complex mosaic of microenvironments in metropolitan situations are sensitively recorded in the pollen contributions of weedy taxa”.&lt;ref name="Kelso" /&gt;  Arboreal pollen indicates regional vegetation, while non-arboreal indicates local vegetation. Both arboreal and non-arboreal pollen can be gathered and used in archaeological studies to support documentary and archaeological evidence of changes in land use—initial settlement, resettlement of area by other groups, and decline and abandonment of area—for example non-arboreal pollen can indicate the replacement of vegetation native to a region within the United States by vegetation native to places in Europe, or to the clearance of large areas that would be expected to make way for cities and towns.&lt;ref name="Kelso" /&gt;

==Inequality, archaeology, landscape==

Within the discipline of historical archaeology, specifically within the [[United States]], landscape archaeology initially gained prominence with efforts to preserve the homes and gardens of prominent North American figures (see George Washington's [[Mount Vernon]] and Thomas Jefferson's [[Monticello]]), the reconstruction of early colonial settlements (see [[Colonial Williamsburg]]) and the analysis of [[gardens]] (see [[Annapolis]]). Archaeologists studying the aforementioned, and other colonial sites throughout the United States, have excavated the gardens of wealthy men and women in order to reconstruct and ascertain the function of these gardens in colonial life. Scholars analyzing the colonial gardens have noticed that gardens were designed in a neat and orderly fashion, displaying symmetry and inspired by Baroque and Renaissance styles (this style is often described as indicative of a "Georgian Worldview" that became popular during the 17th and 18th centuries).&lt;ref name="Baugher" /&gt; Many interpretations have been advanced to explain the function of these gardens. Beginning in the mid-1700s, wealthy elites began to construct large, stately homes and neat, ordered gardens with the guise of mapping superiority and exclusive knowledge onto the landscape.&lt;ref name="Baugher" /&gt;  Although the Baroque and Renaissance styles were out of date by the time elites in the United States employed them, this was intentionally done to communicate a knowledge and appreciation of British history that few within the community would have access to.&lt;ref name="Baugher"/&gt;  Archaeologists have concluded that the symmetrical, geometric, designs of garden-scapes adopted by colonists in the mid eighteenth to nineteenth centuries made use of "...converging and diverging lines of sight to manipulate the relationship between distance and focal point", making objects appear larger or further away than they really were.&lt;ref name="wye"&gt;Leone, Mark P, James M. Harmon, Jessica L. Neuwirth. (2005).  "Perspective and Surveillance in Eighteenth-Century Maryland Gardens, including William Paca's Garden on Wye Island. In Historical Archaeology, Vol. 39, No.4, pp.140.&lt;/ref&gt;  These optical illusions functioned to transform the home into a readily identifiable status symbol, and to mark the owners and occupants of these homes as socially distinct from others within the colonial community.&lt;ref name="Anne"&gt;Yentsch, Anne Elizabeth. (1996) "Introduction: Close Attention to Place--Landscape Studies by Historical Archaeologists". In ''Landscape Archaeology''. Yamin, Rebecca and Karen Bescherer Metheny, eds. Knoxville: The University of Tennessee Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Stately homes and gardens constructed by the colonial elite also served to assert authority and to naturalize a social hierarchy onto the colonial landscape.&lt;ref name="Anne" /&gt;  Such analysis and interpretations are neo-marxist in its approach to the understanding and interpreting landscapes of the past.

Stephen A. Mrozwoski has extended the conclusions drawn from the archaeological analysis of elite homes and pleasure gardens into the analysis of the developing middle and working class landscapes and ideologies among industrial communities, noting “in the urban context economies of scale realized through spatial practice also contributed to a social landscape that between the eighteenth and early twentieth centuries was increasingly constructed along class lines”&lt;ref name= "Stephen"&gt;Mrozowski, Stephen A. (2006). The Archaeology of Class in Urban America. Cambridge:Cambridge University Press., pg 16;113&lt;/ref&gt; and demonstrate the ways in which the elite constructed their industrial landscapes that worked to restrict perceived amoral behaviors (e.g. drinking, smoking) and to maintain an orderly landscape 97. The landscape also provided an area where "values like orderliness, gentility, and abstinence were important elements of a middle-class culture that, while subject to variability, was nevertheless part of daily existence."&lt;ref name="Stephen" /&gt;

Historical archaeologists have incorporated [[Foucauldian]] theories into the understanding of plantation landscapes. On plantation sites throughout the [[Americas]], plantation owners utilized surveillance methods to restrict the behaviors of the enslaved populations. James A. Delle notes that surveillance was often incorporated into the plantation landscape, noting “the planter class who designed the estate landscapes actively constructed plantation spaces…as an active part of their strategy of social control” and power.&lt;ref name="Delle"&gt;Delle, James A. (1999) The Landscapes of Class Negotiation on Coffee Plantations in the Blue Mountains of Jamaica: 1790-1850. Historical Archaeology 33(1): 136-158. Pp. 151&lt;/ref&gt;  This was largely done through architectural techniques such as incorporating positions where [[panoptic]] views can be achieved into the construction of planters and/or overseers homes&lt;ref name="wye" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Delle" /&gt; or by constructing slave villages that were in the plain view or line of sight of the homes of the overseer and/or plantation owner.&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, Douglas V, and Kenneth G. Kelly (2000). Settlement Patterns and the Origins of African Jamaican Society: Seville Plantation, St. Ann's Bay, Jamaica. Ethnohistory 47(2): 369-394.&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeologists have pointed out that, although home spaces are generally considered to have become increasingly gendered; it is erroneous to assume that only women occupied the private (home) sphere and men the public.&lt;ref&gt;Rotman, Deborah L. and Michael S. Nassaney (1997). Class, Gender, and the Built Environment: Deriving Social Relations from Cultural Landscapes in Southwest Michigan. Historical Archaeology 31(2), pp. 42-62.&lt;/ref&gt;  For more extensive information on this topic, see [[Household Archaeology]].

Barbara Voss has done extensive archaeological work to reveal how ideas about [[gender]], [[human sexuality|sexuality]], [[marriage]], and [[ethnic]]/[[racial]] intermarriage were mapped onto the landscape of Spanish Colonial mission sites in California (El Presidio de San Francisco). Voss’ interpretations reveal the lived trauma that is often concealed by popular, romanticized, narratives of relationships established through colonial contact between indigenous peoples and Spanish colonizers&lt;ref name="Voss"&gt;Voss, Barbara L. (2008). Domesticating Imperialism: Sexual Politics and the Archaeology of Empire. American Anthropologist 110(2), pp. 191-203.&lt;/ref&gt;  The mission landscape became physical and conceptualized space where two genders (male/female) and heterosexuality were to be explicitly expressed and reinforced.&lt;ref name="Voss" /&gt;

Landscape Archaeology has been useful in the analysis of cultural identities that developed among social and racial groups. It has been argued that the existence and continued use of yard spaces among Black Americans (along with other African-derived practices observed in the Americas) is proof of a distinct, new world, cultural identity.&lt;ref&gt;Ruppel, Timothy, Jessica Neuwirth, Mark P. Leone, and Gladys-Marie Fry (2003). Hidden in view: African spiritual spaces in North American landscapes. Antiquity 77 (296): pp. 321-335.&lt;/ref&gt; One feature that appears to be widespread throughout the [[African diaspora]] is the significant importance of [[Yard (land)|yard spaces]] in the everyday lives of African-Americans. Sidney W. Mintz, in describing the “house-and-yard pattern” among African-American [[peasants]] residing in the [[Caribbean]], explains “…the house, particularly among poorer peasants, is not important in itself as a material representation (i.e. material culture/artifacts) of the domestic group or family”.&lt;ref name="mintz"&gt;Mintz, Sidney W. (1974). Caribbean Transformations. Chicago: Aldine Publishing Company, Pp.249, 244&lt;/ref&gt; Mintz further states that while the house “…is usually used mainly for sleeping and for storing clothing and other articles of personal value” the yard is where “…children play, the washing is done, the family relaxes, and friends are entertained”.&lt;ref name="mintz" /&gt;

Richard Westmacott, [[Barbara J. Heath]] and Amber Bennett have echoed Mintz’s statements about the use of yards among African-Americans in their accounts of present day and past African-American communities. Richard Westmacott provides an extensive ethnographic account of the role gardens and yards play in the lives of African Americans in the southern region of the United States in his book African-American Gardens and Yards in the Rural South. Westmacott provides a clear definition of the yard, defining it as a place where leisure activities and artistic expression often take place&lt;ref name="West"&gt;Westmacott, Richard (1992) African-American Gardens and Yards in the Rural South. Knoxville: The University of Tennessee Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, Heath and Bennett describe the yard as a space in which “…food production and preparation, care and maintenance of animals, domestic chores, storage, recreation, and aesthetic enjoyment” often occur at.&lt;ref name="Heath"&gt;Heath, Barbara J. and Amber Bennett (2000). "The little Spots allow'd them": The Archaeological Study of African-American Yards. Historical Archaeology 34(2):38-55.&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of the yard as an important and integral aspect of a home appears to be an element that many west African cultures hold, which indicates that the function of the yard within African-American households may be a facet of west African cultures that was maintained in the New World, as well as a cultural aspect that aided in the development of African American identities in the Americas.&lt;ref name="West" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Heath" /&gt;

Similarly, Mrozowski’s study of rear yards associated with the Boott Mill boardinghouses and tenements that housed workers revealed that these yards mainly served practical functions and were not primarily used to grow foodstuffs, and may not have served an integral part in the daily lives of the low-wage workers hired (99-100). Mrozowski also argues that yards also represented social distance and distinctiveness between socio-economic classes of people, due to the particular placement, use, and overall function.  "The result was a landscape that created social distance between the agents and the workers who lived only a few feet away. It also represents a significant transformation in the urban space. The ornamental yards of the agent's house and overseers' block signal an important shift in the type of urban space being produced and the manner in which it was utilized."

'''Lawrence David "Larry" Kusche''' (born November 1, 1940) is an American author, research librarian, and pilot. He investigated unexplained disappearences and other unusual events related to the [[Bermuda Triangle]] to answer queries he was getting as a research librarian, and ended up writing a book debunking most of the mysteries touted by other writers about that location.

==Early Life==
Larry Kusche was born in [[Racine, Wisconsin]], but his family moved to the [[Phoenix, Arizona]] area when he was six.{{r|Tancill-1975}} 
Interested in aviation, Kusche qualified for a commercial pilot's license at age 19, was a commercial pilot by age 21, a flight instructor by age 24, and an instrument instructor.{{r|Winstein-1980}} 

In 1964, Kusche graduated from [[Arizona State University]] (ASU). He completed a training course to become a commercial flight engineer, but on the day he was supposed to report for work, he decided he didn't like the prospect of a career sitting in front of hundreds of switches and dials unable to see out of the airplane. He resigned and returned to Arizona to became a high school math teacher and librarian. Later, he acquired a master's degree in library science and began working at ASU's Hayden Library in June, 1969.{{r|Ben-Horin}} 

==Writing Career==
===Bermuda Triangle===
As a research librarian at ASU, Kusche received queries for all types of information from students writing term papers.{{r|Ropp-1975}} {{r|Kusche-2015}} 
In the early 1970s he became interested in the [[Bermuda Triangle]] mystery, as he was confronted by numerous queries related to the Triangle. This prompted Kusche and fellow librarian Debbie Blouin to start gathering information, mostly by writing hundreds of letters to request information from official sources. Initially, the two librarians began selling for $2 a bibliography of the information about the Bermuda Triangle that they had acquired.
Later, it occurred to Kusche that somebody should put down all of the information they had gathered into a book. When the publishing company Harper and Row ordered a copy of the bibliography, Kusche sent them a copy with a note scribbled on it asking if they were interested in a book about the subject that he was writing – and they were.{{r|Ben-Horin}} 

Initially intrigued by the mysteries surrounding the Triangle, Kusche's research convinced him that virtually all the incidents had been caused by storms or accidents, or they happened outside the Triangle, or no proof could be found that they ever occurred at all. His conclusion was that the Triangle was a "manufactured mystery," the result of poor research and reporting, and the occasional deliberate falsification of facts.{{r|Dean-1974}}{{r|skepdic}} 

===Flight 19===
Kusche originally included a long chapter is his Bermuda Triangle book about Flight 19, five Navy Avenger torpedo airplanes on a training mission out of Fort Lauderdale Naval Air Station that disappeared in the Atlantic ocean on December 5, 1945. Kusche later expanded this chapter into a book, ''The Disappearance of Flight 19.'' He studied the Navy's report of the investigation, interviewed many of the Navy personnel who were involved at the time, and flew the likely route of the missing aircraft himself. At the time, the lost flight of five torpedo bombers was said to be a victim of the mysterious forces in the Triangle. Kusche explained why the flight leader erroneously thought he was in the Florida Keys, why he said his compass had failed, and why no wreckage has yet been found.{{r|Covington-1980}}{{r|Kaye-1995}}{{r|Kusche-2015}} 

===Later Career===
Kusche took a leave-of-absence to complete his first book. After the success of the ''Bermuda Triangle'' book, Kusche abandoned his career as a librarian to become a writer. He has worked as a technical writer in the Phoenix area. After publication of his investigative books, Kusche became a Fellow of the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] (CSI).{{r|CSI}} 

===Other Books===
Kusche is also the author of ''Larry Kusche's Popcorn Cookery'', a 1977 cookbook detailing recipes involving popcorn, including baked goods made from ground-up popcorn "flour",{{r|Upton-1977}} and ''Shape Up Your Hips and Thighs''.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

An attempt to declare its alliance to [[Gran Colombia]], the flag was raised in the early weeks of 1822, but it was short-lived when nine weeks later Boyer had ended the republic.

'''Mount Qasioun''' ({{lang-ar|'''جبل قاسيون'''}}, transliterated as '''Jabal Qāsiyūn''') is a mountain overlooking the city of [[Damascus]], [[Syria]]. It has a range of restaurants, from which the whole city can be viewed. As the city has expanded over the years, some districts have been established on the foot of the mountain. Its highest point is {{convert|1151|m|ft|0}}.&lt;ref name=USArmyMapService&gt;[http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/world_cities/txu-oclc-44821944-damas-1958.jpg 1:10,000, Edition 2-AMS, Series K922. U.S. Army Map Service, 1958]&lt;/ref&gt;

The mountain has been heavily entrenched with Syrian government forces since the start of the [[Syrian Civil War]], as it is a strategic site in the battle for the outskirts of Damascus. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Syria’s civil war: Closer to the capital |url= https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21576150-president-bashar-assad-and-rebels-are-set-fight-damascus-closer |newspaper=The Economist |date=13 April 2013 |accessdate=7 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sam Dagher, 'Assad Readies for U.S. Strike Despite Delay', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', Tuesday, September 3, 2013, p. A6&lt;/ref&gt;

The mountain is also host to an [[endemic]] species of iris, ''[[Iris damascena]]'', which can be found on the steep eastern slopes, at an altitude of {{convert|1200|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level.&lt;ref name=signa&gt;{{cite web |first= Rafael Diez |last=Dominguez |title=Iris damascena |date=27 July 2007 |url=http://www.signa.org/index.pl?Iris-damascena |publisher=signa.org (Species Iris Group of North America) |accessdate=6 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Syrian government has not given the species any protected status. Its only benefiting factor was that part of the habitat of the species lies within a military area near the 'Qassioun Republican Guards Military Base' and other military facilities, which prevents civilians from accessing the area.&lt;ref name=factors&gt;{{cite web |first=Amr |last=Al-Faham |title=Factors Driving the Destruction of Syria’s Natural Heritage |date=19 January 2016 |url=http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/syriasource/factors-driving-the-destruction-of-syria-s-natural-heritage |publisher=atlantoccouncil.org |accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The base and steepness of the habitat also prevents construction or development, but it is still classified as [[Critically endangered]].&lt;ref name=redlist&gt;{{cite web |first=Y. |last=Sapir |title=Iris damascena |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.2305/IUCN.UK.2016-1.RLTS.T13161620A18611035.en |publisher=dx.doi.org ([[IUCN]]) |accessdate=6 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the slopes of Jabal Qasiun is a cave steeped in legend. It is said to have been inhabited at one point by the first human-being, [[Adam]]; and there are various stories told about Ibrāhīm (Abraham), and 'Īsā (Jesus) also having prayed in it. It is mentioned however in Medieval Arab history books as having been the place where Qābīl ([[Cain]]) killed Hābīl ([[Abel]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.naqshbandi.org/events/hajj/jabal.htm |title=Jabal Qasiyun - Site of Wonders |accessdate=2009-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305025659/http://www.naqshbandi.org/events/hajj/jabal.htm |archivedate=2012-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Progress at a standstill at the crossroads of the Middle East|author=Jason Koutsoukis |newspaper=The Age|date=September 27, 2008 |url= http://www.theage.com.au/world/progress-at-a-standstill-at-the-crossroads-of-the-middle-east-20080926-4ov4.html?skin=text-only |accessdate=December 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was known for hundreds of years as a place where prayers were immediately accepted, and especially in times of drought rulers of Damascus would climb to the cave and pray for rain. Because of the murder that took place there, claimed to be the first committed, it is called ''Maghārat al-Dam'' (the Cave of Blood).&lt;ref name=Meri&gt;Josef W. Meri (Trans.): A Lonely Wayfarer's Guide to Pilgrimage. 'Ali ibn Abī Bakr al-Harawī's: ''Kitāb al-Ishārāt ilā Ma'rifat al-Ziyārāt''Pg. 24-25. Princeton, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Sunni]] Muslims, Mount Qasioun is the site of the [[mihrab|miḥrāb]]s (prayer niches) of the 40 arch-saints, known as the Abdāl, who are said to pray the [[vigil|night vigil]] prayers every night. A small mosque has been built over the Cave of Blood containing these miḥrābs.

Further down the mountain from the 'Cave of Blood', there was another cave known as ''Maghārat al-Jūˁ'' (the Cave of Hunger). Stories about this cave are somewhat confused. Some say that forty saints died there of hunger;{{Who|date=December 2014}} al-Harawī, however, who lived in the 13th century, writes that it is said that forty prophets died there of hunger.&lt;ref name=Meri/&gt; At present, the cave has been concealed by surrounding houses, but that spot is called al-Juyūˁīyah (Roughly 'the Place of the Hungry').

On another flank of the same mountain is yet another cave, which has come down in local legend as being the cave of the [[Seven Sleepers]], mentioned in early Christian sources, as well as in the Quran,&lt;ref&gt;Quran 18:7-26&lt;/ref&gt; where they are known as the ''Aṣḥāb al-Kahf'' (Companions of the Cave). This is rather dubious, however, and it is only one of many caves in this part of the world that share the claim. A [[madrassah]] has been built over the cave, but pilgrims are still granted access.

The '''neutral density''' ( &lt;math&gt; \gamma^n\, &lt;/math&gt; ) or '''empirical neutral density''' is a density variable used in [[oceanography]], introduced in 1997 by David R. Jackett and [[Trevor McDougall]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Jackett, David R., Trevor J. McDougall, 1997: A Neutral Density Variable for the World's Oceans. J. Phys. Oceanogr., 27, 237–263&lt;/ref&gt;
It is function of the three state variables ([[salinity]], [[temperature]], and [[pressure]]) and the geographical location ([[longitude]] and [[latitude]]) and it has the typical units of [[density]] (M/V).
The level surfaces of &lt;math&gt; \gamma^n\, &lt;/math&gt;  form the “neutral density surfaces”. These are widely regarded as the most natural layer interfaces stratifying the [[deep sea|deep ocean]] circulation, along which the strong lateral mixing in the ocean occurs, although this has yet to be rigorously established. These surfaces are widely used in water masses analysis. Neutral density is a density variable that depends on the particular state of the ocean, and hence a function of time as well, although this is often ignored. In practice, its construction for a given hydrographic observation is achieved by means of a computational code (available for [[Matlab]] and [[Fortran]]), that contains the computational [[algorithm]] developed by Jackett and McDougall. Use of this code is currently restricted to the present day ocean.

== Mathematical expression ==
A neutral density surface is the surface along which a given [[water mass]] will move, remaining neutrally [[buoyancy|buoyant]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{clarify |date=February 2017 |reason=see Talk }}

McDougall and Jackett &lt;ref&gt;McDougall, T. J. and D. R. Jackett, 1988: On the helical nature of neutral surfaces. Progress in Oceanography, Vol. 20, Pergamon, 153–183&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated that the normal to the neutral surfaces is in the direction of &lt;math&gt; \beta \nabla S - \alpha \nabla \theta &lt;/math&gt;, where S is the [[salinity]], &lt;math&gt; \theta \, &lt;/math&gt; is the [[potential temperature]], &lt;math&gt; \alpha \, &lt;/math&gt; the [[thermal expansion]] coefficient and &lt;math&gt; \beta \, &lt;/math&gt; the saline [[concentration]] coefficient.
Thus, neutral surfaces are defined as the surfaces everywhere perpendicular to the vector &lt;math&gt; \rho (\beta \nabla S - \alpha \nabla \theta) &lt;/math&gt;. For such a surface to exist, its [[Hydrodynamical helicity|helicity]] H must be zero;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Jackett, David R., Trevor J. McDougall, 1997: A Neutral Density Variable for the World's Oceans. J. Phys. Oceanogr., 27, page 238&lt;/ref&gt; if this condition is respected, a scalar &lt;math&gt; \gamma^n\, &lt;/math&gt; exists and it is the one which satisfies the following formula:&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \nabla\gamma^n\ =    b \rho (\beta \nabla S - \alpha \nabla \theta) + {\cal R};&lt;/math&gt;                    {{EquationRef|1}}
where b is an integrating scalar factor, which is function of space, and &lt;math&gt; {\cal R}&lt;/math&gt; a residual term that is usually different from zero.

This formula represents a coupled system of first-order [[partial differential equations]], that has to be solved to obtain the desired value of &lt;math&gt; \gamma^n\, &lt;/math&gt;.
The solutions of ({{EquationNote|1}} ) can be obtained by using [[Numerical partial differential equations|numerical techniques]].

In the real ocean, the condition of [[Helicity (fluid mechanics)|helicity]] equal to zero is not generally satisfied exactly. Therefore, and because of the non-linear terms in the equation of state, it is impossible to create analytically a [[Well-defined]] neutral density surface.&lt;ref&gt;Klocker et all., 2007, “Diapycnal motion due to neutral helicity”&lt;/ref&gt; There will always be flow through the calculated surfaces, because of the presence of a neutral [[Helicity (fluid mechanics)|helicity]].

Therefore, it is possible to obtain only a best-fit approximate neutral surface, through which there is no flow of major proportions and  along which it is generally accepted that flow takes place.
&lt;math&gt; \gamma^n\, &lt;/math&gt; is a [[Well-defined]] function and Jackett and McDougall demonstrated that the [[inaccuracy]] due to the not exact neutrality is below the present instrumentation error in density.&lt;ref&gt;Jackett, David R., Trevor J. McDougall, 1997: A Neutral Density Variable for the World's Oceans. J. Phys. Oceanogr., 27, page 239&lt;/ref&gt; Neutral density surfaces stay within a few tens meters of an ideal surface anywhere in the world.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oceanworld.tamu.edu/resources/ocng_textbook/chapter06/chapter06_05.htm |title=Introduction to Physical Oceanography : Chapter 6 - Temperature, Salinity, and Density - Density, Potential Temperature, and Neutral Density |publisher=Oceanworld.tamu.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For how &lt;math&gt; \gamma^n\, &lt;/math&gt; has been defined, neutral density surfaces can be considered the continuous analog of the commonly used [[potential density]] surfaces, which are defined over various discrete values of pressures (see for example &lt;ref&gt;Montgomery, R. B., 1938: Circulation in the upper layers of the southern North Atlantic, Pap. Phys. Oceanogr. Meteor., 6(2), 55 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; and &lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Reid, J. L.,  1994: On the total geostrophic circulation of the North Atlantic Ocean: Flow patterns, tracers and transports. Progress in Oceanography,Vol. 33, Pergamon, 1–92&lt;/ref&gt;).

== Spatial dependence ==
Given the spatial dependence of the neutral density, its calculation requires the knowledge of the spatial distribution of temperature and [[salinity]] in the ocean. Therefore, the definition of &lt;math&gt; \gamma^n\, &lt;/math&gt; has to be linked with a global hydrographic dataset, based on the climatology of the world’s ocean (see [[World Ocean Atlas]] and &lt;ref&gt;Levitus, S. (1982) Climatological Atlas of the World Ocean, NOAA Professional Paper No. 13, U.S. Govt. Printing Office, 173 pp., -ftp://ftp.nodc.noaa.gov/pub/data.nodc/woa/PUBLICATIONS/levitus_atlas_1982.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;).
In this way, the solution of ({{EquationNote|1}} ) provides values of &lt;math&gt; \gamma^n\, &lt;/math&gt; for a referenced global dataset.
The solution of the system for a high resolution dataset would be computationally very expensive. In this case, the original dataset can be sub-sampled and ({{EquationNote|1}} ) can be solved over a more limited set of data.

== Algorithm for the computation of neutral surfaces using  &lt;math&gt; \gamma^n\, &lt;/math&gt; ==
Jackett and McDougall constructed the variable &lt;math&gt; \gamma^n\, &lt;/math&gt; using the data in the “Levitus dataset”.&lt;ref&gt;Levitus, S. (1982) Climatological Atlas of the World Ocean, NOAA Professional Paper No. 13, U.S. Govt. Printing Office, 173 pp.    -   ftp://ftp.nodc.noaa.gov/pub/data.nodc/woa/PUBLICATIONS/levitus_atlas_1982.pdf{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
As this dataset consist of measurements of S and T at 33 standard depth levels at a 1° resolution, the solution of ({{EquationNote|1}} ) for such a large dataset would be computationally very expensive. Therefore, they sub-sampled the data of the original dataset onto a 4°x4° grid and solved ({{EquationNote|1}} ) on the nodes of this grid.
The authors suggested to solve this system by using a combination of the [[method of characteristics]] in nearly 85% of the ocean (the characteristic surfaces of ({{EquationNote|1}} ) are neutral surfaces along which &lt;math&gt; \gamma^n\, &lt;/math&gt; is constant) and the [[finite difference method|finite differences method]] in the remaining 15%.
The output of these calculations is a global dataset labeled with values of &lt;math&gt; \gamma^n\, &lt;/math&gt;.
The field of &lt;math&gt; \gamma^n\, &lt;/math&gt; values resulting from the solution of the differential system ({{EquationNote|1}} ) satisfies ({{EquationNote|1}} ) an order of magnitude better (on average) than the present instrumentation error in [[density]].&lt;ref&gt;Jackett, David R., Trevor J. McDougall, 1997: A Neutral Density Variable for the World's Oceans. J. Phys. Oceanogr., 27, page 248&lt;/ref&gt;

The labeled dataset is then used to assign &lt;math&gt; \gamma^n\, &lt;/math&gt; values to any arbitrary hydrographic data at new locations, where values are measured as a function of depth by [[interpolation]] to the four closest points in the Levitus atlas.

== Practical computation of &lt;math&gt; \gamma^n\, &lt;/math&gt; ==
The formation of neutral density surfaces from a given hydrographic observation requires only a call to a computational code that contains the [[algorithm]] developed by Jackett and McDougall.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.teos-10.org/preteos10_software/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Neutral Density code comes as a package of [[Matlab]] or as a [[Fortran]] routine. It enables the user to fit neutral density surfaces to arbitrary hydrographic data and just 2 [[Megabyte|MBytes]] of storage are required to obtain an accurately pre-labelled world ocean.

Then, the code permits to [[interpolation|interpolate]] the labeled data in terms of spatial location and [[hydrography]]. By taking a [[Weighted mean|weighted average]] of the four closest casts from the labeled data set, it enables to assign &lt;math&gt; \gamma^n\, &lt;/math&gt; values to any arbitrary hydrographic data.

Another function provided in the code, given a vertical profile of labeled data and &lt;math&gt; \gamma^n\, &lt;/math&gt; surfaces, finds the positions of the specified &lt;math&gt; \gamma^n\, &lt;/math&gt;  surfaces within the [[water column]], together with [[error bar]]s.

== Advantages of using the neutral density variable ==
Comparisons between the approximated neutral surfaces obtained by using the variable &lt;math&gt; \gamma^n\, &lt;/math&gt; and the previous commonly used methods to obtain discretely referenced neutral surfaces (see for example Reid (1994),&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; that proposed to approximate neutral surfaces by a linked sequence of [[potential density]] surfaces referred to a discrete set of reference pressures) have shown an improvement of [[Accuracy and precision|accuracy]] (by a factor of about 5) &lt;ref&gt;Jackett, David R., Trevor J. McDougall, 1997: A Neutral Density Variable for the World's Oceans. J. Phys. Oceanogr., 27, page 252&lt;/ref&gt; and an easier and computationally less expensive [[algorithm]] to form neutral surfaces. 
A neutral surface defined using &lt;math&gt; \gamma^n\, &lt;/math&gt; differs only slightly from an ideal neutral surface. In fact, if a parcel moves around a gyre on the neutral surface and returns to its starting location, its depth at the end will differ by around 10m from the depth at the start.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; If [[potential density]] surfaces are used, the difference can be hundreds of meters, a far larger error.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

[[Image:Nicolaas Witsen 1674-1717 by Petrus Schenk 1701.jpg|thumb|Nicolaes Witsen by [[Peter Schenck]] (1701)]]

'''Nicolaes Witsen''' (8 May 1641 – 10 August 1717; [[Dutch language|modern Dutch]]: ''Nicolaas Witsen'') was a Dutch statesman who was mayor of Amsterdam thirteen times, between 1682 and 1706. In 1693 he became administrator of the [[Dutch East India Company|VOC]]. In 1689 he was extraordinary-ambassador to the English court, and became [[Fellow of the Royal Society]]. In his free time he was [[cartographer]], maritime writer, and an authority on [[shipbuilding]]. His books on the subject are important sources on Dutch shipbuilding in the 17th century. Furthermore, he was an expert on Russian affairs. He was the first to describe Siberia, the Far East and Central Asia in his study ''Noord en Oost Tartarye'' [North and East Tartary].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nwo.nl/onderzoek-en-resultaten/onderzoeksprojecten/52/1600111152.html The Witsen Project].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Nicolaes Witsen was born in [[Amsterdam]], the son of [[Cornelis Jan Witsen]], [[burgomaster]], head bailiff and administrator of the [[Dutch West India Company]].  In 1656 Nicolaes went with his father to England, where he was introduced to [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s children.&lt;ref&gt;Gebhard Jr, J.F. (1881) Het leven van Mr Nicolaes Cornelisz. Witsen.&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1662 Nicolaes Witsen held a disputation at the Amsterdam [[Athenaeum Illustre of Amsterdam|Athenaeum Illustre]], in which he argued against the influence of [[comet]]s on the welfare of all earthly things, possibly influenced by his nephew [[Johann van Waveren Hudde|Joannes Hudde]]. In 1664 and 1665 Nicolaes made an embassy to Moscovia with the envoy [[Jacob Boreel]]. By boat they went to [[Riga]], then Swedish, and over land to [[Novgorod]] and Moscow. There he met with [[Andrew Vinius]], who became his life long friend, sending him maps and objects. The talks with [[czar]] [[Alexis of Russia]] about a monopoly on [[tar]] were no success.  Witsen wrote in his diary that no-one there was occupied with art or science.  Witsen visited the [[Patriarch Nikon]] and made notes on the worship of [[icon]]s, interested in his name saint (and patron saint of Amsterdam), [[saint Nicholas]].  He studied law at [[Leiden University]], but became more interested in languages and maps. In the 1666–1667 Witsen travelled to Rome and met with [[Cosimo III de' Medici]] in Pisa. In Paris he met the scientist [[Melchisédech Thévenot]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vostlit.info/Texts/rus5/Vitsen/pred.phtml?id=271 ПУТЕШЕСТВИЕ В МОСКОВИЮ НИКОЛААСА ВИТСЕНА]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1668 he travelled to [[Oxford]]. In 1674 he married Catherina Hochepied. Four children were born, not surviving childhood.

==Shipbuilding==
Witsen wrote "''Aeloude and hedendaegsche Scheepsbouw en Bestier''" in 1671, which quickly became seen as the standard work on the subject.  Even an [[anatomist]] like [[Nicolas Steno|Steno]] read the book. The technique Witsen describes is ''[[Trireme#Construction|shell-first]]'', and not ''[[Ancient shipbuilding techniques#Frame-first|frame-first]]''.  The book is not easy to read, because of misty wording and the chaotic structure, but has a lot of interesting engravings, made by himself. It can be compared with ''Doctrine for Naval Architecture'' by fellow-shipbuilder [[Anthony Dean (mayor)|Anthony Dean]], a mayor of [[Harwich]] and also a mentor of [[Peter the Great]].&lt;ref&gt;Hoving, A.J. (1994) Nicolaes Witsens Scheeps-Bouw-Konst Open Gestelt, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; It led to a correspondence between him and [[Peter the Great]] on modernising the [[Imperial Russian Navy]], then backward by Western European standards.  This led to an order for warships from Amsterdam shipyards in return for an [[ukase]] (negotiated by Witsen) on Dutch-Russian trade, guaranteeing to supply the Republic with grain, wood, [[talc]], tar and skins.  In 1697 Witsen organised a four-month training period for the tsar at the [[Dutch East India Company]] shipyards during his [[Grand Embassy of Peter I|Grand Embassy]], with the Tsar staying in [[Jacob J. Hinlopen]]'s house and being taken by Witsen among many others to meet the [[botanist]] and [[anatomist]] [[Frederik Ruysch]].&lt;ref&gt;Driessen, J. (1996) ''Tsaar Peter de Grote en zijn Amsterdamse vrienden''. In cooperation with Amsterdams Historisch Museum, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cartography==
[[Image:Witsen - Tartaria.jpg|thumb|right|Map of [[Tartary]] (Land of the Tartars)]]

After 20 years' study, Witsen published the first map of [[Siberia]] in 1690. This map represented the world from [[Novaya Zemlya|Nova Zembla]] to as far away as [[Qing China|China]]. Witsen had discussed with the tsar the trade routes to [[Persia]] via the [[Caspian Sea]] and to China via Siberia. In 1692 he published a compendium titled "''Noord en Oost Tartarye''", describing Siberia and the surrounding areas, though without literary references. He consulted classical authors and Arabic medieval writers as well as his learned contemporaries in Europe. The second enlarged edition, a bulky book, also written in 17th century Dutch, presents a rather complicated mixture of various texts with encyclopaedic details. It appeared in 1705 and was reprinted in 1785. In this book, Witsen gave an account of all the information available to the Europeans at that time about the northern and eastern parts of Europe and Asia, and also about the [[Volga]] area, [[Crimea]], [[Caucasus]], Central Asia, [[Northern Yuan dynasty|Mongolia]], Tibet, [[Qing China|China]], [[Joseon|Korea]] and the neighbouring parts of [[Tokugawa shogunate|Japan]]. In the text, for instance, we find lists of 900 [[Georgian language|Georgian]] and 700 [[Kalmyk language|Kalmyk]] words and illustrations of the writing systems of [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]], [[Manchu language|Manchu]] and [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] languages. Witsen provides word lists and other data on more than 25 languages.&lt;ref&gt;Graaf, T. de, &amp; B. Naarden. 2007. ''Description of the Border Areas of Russia with Japan and Their Inhabitants in Witsen's North and East Tartary''. In: Acta Slavica Iaponica 24, pp. 205–220. [http://www.src-h.slav.hokudai.ac.jp/publictn/acta/24/deGraaf.pdf For the article see this link]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1692 Witsen received the diary of [[Maarten Gerritsz Vries]], who had explored the coast of [[Sahkalin]] in 1643, and it was never seen again.

==Mayor and Maecenas==
In 1688, Witsen was visited and invited more than once to discuss [[William III of England|William III]]'s proposed crossing to England, but he had great doubts and did not know what to advise. [[William Bentinck, 1st Earl of Portland|William Bentinck]] called him the most sensitive man in the world.&lt;ref&gt;When Witsen was invited for the first time to see the prince, Witsen started to cry and fell on his knees, according to his personal archive, but could not refuse. In: Kok, J. (1744) Vaderlands Woordenboek, p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt;  Of the other three burgomasters – Jean Appelman (a merchant trading with France), [[Johannes Hudde]] and [[Cornelis Geelvinck]] – Geelvinck openly opposed the enterprise and Appelman was not trusted by the prince and thus was not informed.  After the crossing went ahead, Witsen went to London in the next year to find a way of meeting the costs of 7,301,322 guilders the city of Amsterdam had incurred in supporting it.  William offered to knight him as a [[baronet]], but the modest Witsen refused.&lt;ref&gt;Kok, J. (1744) Vaderlands Woordenboek, p. 251-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Already in his youth Witsen started to collect Siberian curiosities and artworks, gathering corals, lacquer, books, paintings, weapons, porcelain, insects, seashells, stuffed animals and precious stones into his house on [[Herengracht]] on the [[Gouden Bocht|Golden Bend]]. As mayor, he was patron of the arts and sciences, and maintained contacts with German scholars, such as [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]].  He corresponded with [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]], discovering tiny creatures under his [[microscope]]. In 1698 [[Willem de Vlamingh]] offered him two seashells from [[New Holland (Australia)]] and Witsen offered the drawings to [[Martin Lister]].&lt;ref&gt;Smit, P &amp; A.P.M. Sanders &amp; J.P.F. van der Veen (1986) Hendrik Engel's Alphabetical List of Dutch Zoological Canbinets and Menageries, p. 306.&lt;/ref&gt; Witsen who had invested in the journey, was disappointed the men had been more interested in setting up trade than in exploring.&lt;ref&gt;Heeres, J.E. (1899) The part borne by the Dutch in the discovery of Australia 1606–1765, p. XVI, 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

Witsen tried to introduce [[coffee plant]]s from [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] via Amsterdam to countries in South America. [[Boerhaave]] estimated that Witsen had put together a collection of more than 1500 paintings of plants that came to be known as the ''Codex Witsenii'' and were for the greater part of plants growing in and around the [[Cape Peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;''South African Botanical Art'' – Marion Arnold et al. (Fernwood Press, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; These passed into the custody of [[Caspar Commelin]], Professor of Botany at the [[Athenaeum Illustre of Amsterdam|Athenaeum Illustre]] and working in the [[Hortus Botanicus (Amsterdam)|Hortus Botanicus]]. After Commelin's death they were passed to [[Johannes Burman]], inspiring him to produce ''Rariorum africanarum plantarum'' in 1738-9. On Burman's death in 1779, his effects passed to his son, Nicolaas Laurens Burman. After ''his'' death in 1793, his effects, including the ''Codex'', were sold by auction in 1800, disappearing from the records. Witsen had contact with the painter [[Jan de Bray]] over a plan to improve the city's water-supply, and helped the artist [[Cornelis de Bruijn]], who needed contacts in Egypt and Russia – indeed, it was probably Witsen who encouraged De Bruijn to make drawings of [[Persepolis]], to show to the [[Royal Society]].&lt;ref&gt;Sancisi-Weerdenburg, H. (1998) Cornelis de Bruijn, Voyages from Rome to Jerusalem and from Moscow to Batavia, p. 45. [[Allard Pierson Museum]], Amsterdam.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Witsen's Shaman.JPG|thumb|The earliest known depiction of a Siberian shaman, produced by the Dutch explorer Nicolaes Witsen, who authored an account of his travels among Samoyedic- and Tungusic-speaking peoples in 1692. Witsen labelled the illustration as a "Priest of the Devil" and gave this figure clawed feet to highlight his demonic qualities.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut01|Hutton 2001]]. p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
46 persons dedicated books to Witsen, including several by [[Olfert Dapper]], one by the brother of [[Johan Nieuhof]] (including descriptions of Chinese shipbuilding), one by [[Jan van der Heyden]] on his invention of the [[fire hose]] and by the pharmacist [[Hermanus Angelkot junior|Hermanus Angelkot]] jr. and [[Pieter Langendijk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xs4all.nl/~mhpeters/nep.htm|title=NEPOTISME, PATRONAGE EN BOEKOPDRACHTEN BIJ NICOLAES WITSEN (1641–1717)}}&lt;/ref&gt; He helped [[Maria Sybilla Merian]] to publish her prints with plants and insects from [[Surinam (Dutch colony)|Surinam]].

Witsen was also interested in religion, but in an [[Ecumenism|ecumenical]] way: his interests stretched to "saint [[Confucius]]" as he called him (based on his analysis of a Han dynasty Chinese mirror in his collection), as well as to [[shamanism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/19725659/_The_Global_Trajectory_of_Nicolaas_Witsen_s_Chinese_Mirror_The_Rijksmuseum_Bulletin_63_4_2015_pp._324-361|title="The Global Trajectory of Nicolaas Witsen's Chinese Mirror", The Rijksmuseum Bulletin 63, 4 (2015), pp. 324–361.|author=Willemijn van Noord &amp; Thijs Weststeijn}}&lt;/ref&gt; The minister famous for attacking witch-hunts, [[Balthasar Bekker]], was his friend.

Witsen died in [[Amsterdam]] and was buried in [[Egmond aan den Hoef]], not far from his country house, called "Tijdverdrijf" (=to pleasurably pass time). Peter the Great was present when Witsen died and said he lost a great friend.

'''Noel Castree''' [[FAcSS]] (born 2 April 1968) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[geographer]] whose research interests are in [[capitalism]]-environment relationships. He is currently the [[editor-in-chief]] of the [[peer-reviewed journal]] [[Progress in Human Geography]].

==Background==

Castree was born in [[Bury, Greater Manchester]], UK and has a BA in Geography (first class honours) from the [[University of Oxford]], and an MA (1992) and PhD from the [[University of British Columbia]] (May, 1999). He taught for 5 years at [[Liverpool University]] before joining the [[University of Manchester]] in 2000 and becoming a Professor of Geography in the School of Environment and Development in 2004. In January 2014 he joined the [[University of Wollongong]] in Australia, in a new Department of Geography &amp; Sustainable Communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.uow.edu.au/releases/UOW152846.html |title=International human geography expert to join UOW - News &amp; Media @ UOW |publisher=Media.uow.edu.au |date=2013-07-05 |accessdate=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Manchester University in late 2017.

==Key contributions==

His "principal interests are in the [[political economy]] of environmental change, regulation and contestation". He has sought to develop and apply [[Marx]]ian approaches to understanding a range of environmental problems, with an emphasis on understanding the meaning and limits of '[[commodification]]'.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sed.manchester.ac.uk/research/serg/sergstaff.htm Info on the webpage of the Society and Environment Research Group, School of Environment and Development, University of Manchester]&lt;/ref&gt; 
One of his main intellectual contributions to the discipline of geography is advancing the concept of "[[social nature]]"; another is anatomizing the 'neoliberalisation of nature'. He has served twice as a managing editor of peer review journals, once for ''Antipode'' and more recently for ''Progress in Human Geography''.

==Awards==
*In 1993 Castree received a Governor General of Canada's Gold Medal for his master's degree performance at UBC. In 2005, he received the Gill Memorial Award from the [[Royal Geographical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rgs.org/NR/rdonlyres/42561FD8-2BE0-4F1E-A64E-9D1680527BB0/0/MedalsandAwards2005Recipients.pdf 2005 Medals' and Awards' Recipients]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 he was made a Fellow of the British Academy of Social Science and was, in 2008, chair of the RGS-IBG conference held in London.

[[File:Map OC-Oceania.PNG|thumb|500px|Map of islands of [[Oceania]]]]

The '''Oceanian realm''' is one of the [[World Wildlife Fund]] (WWF) [[biogeographic realm]]s, and is unique in not including any [[continent]]al land mass. It is the smallest in land of an area of the WWF realms.

This realm includes the  islands of the [[Pacific Ocean]] in: [[Micronesia]], the [[Fiji|Fijian Islands]], the [[Hawaiian islands]], and [[Polynesia]] (with the exception of New Zealand). 

[[New Zealand]], [[Australia]], and most of [[Melanesia]] including [[New Guinea]], [[Vanuatu]], the [[Solomon Islands]], and [[New Caledonia]] are included within the [[Australasian realm]]. 

==Geology==
Oceania is geologically the youngest realm. While other realms include old continental land masses or fragments of continents, Oceania is composed mostly of volcanic [[high islands]] and [[coral atoll]]s that arose from the sea in geologically recent times, many of them in the [[Pleistocene]]. They were created either by [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspot]] volcanism, or as [[island arc]]s pushed upward by the collision and [[subduction]] of [[tectonic plate]]s. The islands range from tiny islets, sea stacks and coral [[atoll]]s to large mountainous islands, like [[Hawaii]] and [[Fiji]].

==Climate==

The climate of Oceania's islands is tropical or subtropical, and range from humid to seasonally dry. Wetter parts of the islands are covered by [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests]], while the drier parts of the islands, including the leeward sides of the islands and many of the low coral islands, are covered by [[Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests]] and [[Tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands]]. [[Hawaii]]'s high volcanoes, [[Mauna Kea]] and [[Mauna Loa]], are home to some rare tropical [[Montane grasslands and shrublands]].

==Flora and fauna==

Since the islands of Oceania were never connected by land to a continent, the flora and fauna of the islands originally reached them from across the ocean (though at the height of the last ice age sea levels were much lower than today and many current [[seamount]]s were islands, so some now isolated islands were once less isolated). Once they reached the islands, the ancestors of Oceania's present flora and fauna adapted to life on the islands. 

Larger islands with diverse ecological niches encouraged floral and faunal [[adaptive radiation]], whereby multiple species evolved from a common ancestor, each species adapted to a different ecological niche; the various species of [[Hawaiian honeycreeper]]s (Family ''Drepanididae'') are a classic example. Other adaptations to island ecologies include gigantism, dwarfism, and among birds, loss of flight. Oceania has a number of [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] species; Hawaii in particular is considered a global 'center of endemism', with its forest [[ecoregion]]s having one of the highest percentages of endemic plants in the world. 

===Flora===

Land [[plant]]s disperse by several different means. Many plants, mostly ferns and mosses but also some flowering plants, disperse on the wind, relying on tiny spores or feathery seeds that can remain airborne over long distances notably ''[[Metrosideros]]'' trees from New Zealand spread on the wind across Oceania. Other plants, notably [[coconut palm]]s and [[mangroves]], produce seeds that can float in salt water over long distances, eventually washing up on distant beaches, and thus ''[[Coconut|Cocos]]'' trees are ubiquitous across Oceania. [[Bird]]s are also an important means of dispersal; some plants produce sticky seeds that are carried on the feet or feathers of birds, and many plants produce fruits with seeds that can pass through the digestive tracts of birds. ''[[Pandanus]]'' trees are fairly ubiquitous across Oceania.  

Botanists generally agree that much of the flora of Oceania is derived from the [[Malesia]]n Flora of the [[Malay Peninsula]], [[Indonesia]], the [[Philippines]], and [[New Guinea]], with some plants from Australasia and a few from the [[Americas]], particularly in Hawaii. [[Easter Island]] has some plants from [[South America]] such as the [[totora (plant)|totora reed]].

===Fauna===

[[File:Kagu Rhynchetos jubatus detail.JPG|thumb|[[Kagu]] (''Rhynochetos jubatus''), a flightless bird from [[New Caledonia]]]]

Dispersal across the ocean is difficult for most land [[animal]]s, and Oceania has relatively few indigenous land animals compared to other realms. Certain types of animals that are ecologically important on the continental realms, like large land [[predator]]s and grazing mammals, were entirely absent from the islands of Oceania until humans brought them. [[Bird]]s are relatively common, including many [[seabird]]s and some species of land birds whose ancestors may have been blown out to sea by storms. Some birds evolved into flightless species after their ancestors arrived, including several species of [[rallidae|rails]].  A number of islands have indigenous [[lizard]]s, including [[gecko]]es and [[skink]]s, whose ancestors probably arrived on floating rafts of vegetation washed out to sea by storms. With the exception of [[bat]]s, which live on most of the island groups, there are few if any indigenous [[mammal]] species in Oceania.

==Impact of settlement==

Many animal and plant species have been introduced by humans in two main waves.

[[Malayo-Polynesian]] settlers brought [[pig]]s, [[dog]]s, [[chicken]]s and [[polynesian rat]]s to many islands; and had spread across the whole of Oceania by 1200 [[Common Era|CE]]. From the seventeenth century onwards European settlers brought other animals, including [[cat]]s, [[cattle]], [[horse]]s, [[small Asian mongoose]] (''Herpestes javanicus''), [[sheep]], [[goat]]s, and the [[brown rat]] (''Rattus norvegicus''). These and other introduced species, in addition to overhunting and deforestation, have dramatically altered the ecology of many of Oceania's islands, pushing many species to extinction or near-extinction, or confining them to small islets uninhabited by humans.

The absence of predator species caused many bird species to become 'naive', losing the instinct to flee from predators, and to lay their eggs on the ground, which makes them vulnerable to introduced predators like cats, dogs, mongooses, and rats. The arrival of humans on these island groups often resulted in disruption of the indigenous ecosystems and waves of species extinctions (see [[Holocene extinction event]]). [[Easter Island]], the easternmost island in Polynesia, shows evidence of a human-caused ecosystem collapse several hundred years ago, which contributed (along with slave raiding and European diseases) to a 99% decline in the human population of the island. The island, once lushly forested, is now mostly windswept grasslands. More recently, [[Guam]]'s native bird and lizard species were decimated by the introduction of the [[brown tree snake]] (''Boiga irregularis'') in the 1940s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1063">'''Precordillera''' is a [[Spanish language|Spanish]] geographical term for hills and mountains lying before a greater range, [[foothills]]. The term is derived from ''cordillera'' (mountain range)—literally "pre-mountain range"—and applied usually to the [[Andes]],.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dle.rae.es/?id=TwlfV9m |title=precordillera|language=Spanish|website=Diccionario de la lengua española - Edición del Tricentenario |date=  |author= |accessdate= 6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some places usually called precordillera are:
*Mountains between [[Sierras de Córdoba]] and the main chain of the Andes in Argentina.  See [[Cuyo (Argentina)]] and [[Cuyania]].
*Used all over Chile from north to south as a morphological unit lying just between the Andes and the [[Chilean Central Valley|Intermediate Depression]].

The '''Princes of Canino and Musignano''' formed the genealogically senior line of the [[House of Bonaparte|Bonaparte]] family following the death of [[Joseph Bonaparte]] in 1844. The line was founded by one of [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Emperor Napoleon]]'s younger brothers, [[Lucien Bonaparte]]. It became extinct in the male line in 1924. The [[Line of succession to the French throne (Napoleonic)|dynastic Bonapartist]] [[pretender]]s descend in the male line from Prince [[Jérôme Bonaparte|Jérôme Napoléon]], Napoleon's youngest brother.

[[Canino]] and Musignano are two neighbouring villages in the [[Province of Viterbo]] in Italy. They were bestowed on [[Lucien Bonaparte]] by papal authority on 18 August 1814 (Prince of Canino) and on 21 March 1824 (Prince of Musignano).

==First Empire law==
{{House of Bonaparte}}
Article 7 of the [[monarchy|monarchical]] constitution of the [[First French Empire]], promulgated 20 May 1804, established that upon extinction of the legitimate natural and adopted male, [[patrilineality|agnatic]] descendants of Napoleon I (1769–1821), and those of two of his brothers, Prince [[Joseph Bonaparte|Joseph Napoléon]] (1768–1844) and Prince [[Louis Bonaparte|Louis Napoléon]] (1778–1846), the throne was to be awarded to a man selected by the non-dynastic princely and ducal dignitaries of the empire, as ratified by [[Referendum|plebiscite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On 22 March 1815, during the [[Hundred Days]], Napoleon also recognized his brother Lucien and Lucien's sons as Imperial French princes. At no time, however, were Lucien and his issue recognized during the First Empire as eligible by law to inherit the French throne, or any other throne. The title of ''Principe di Canino e Musignano'' borne by Lucien and his [[heir male|heirs male]] was a [[Pope|papal]] title of nobility, never legally recognized in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| editor = A. Niemann| title = Almanach de Gotha| year = 1878| publisher = Justus Perthes| location =  Gotha| language = French| pages = 225–226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, upon the death without issue in 1832 of the [[Napoleon II|Duke of Reichstadt]], titular ''Emperor Napoleon II'', the claim to the Bonaparte crown of France devolved upon [[Joseph Bonaparte]], formerly King of Naples and then King of Spain. Following his death without sons in 1844, the Imperial claim bypassed Lucien's sons and devolved upon [[Louis Bonaparte]], formerly King of Holland, even though Louis had been younger than Lucien.

==Second Empire law==
Louis's two elder sons pre-deceased their father, but his third son became Emperor [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]] in 1852. The [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]]'s constitution recognized the [[dynasty|dynasticity]] of all of Napoleon I's brothers and their issue, but allowed the emperor to choose the order in which they would inherit the throne in the event he died without male issue. On 18 December 1852 the emperor appointed his only remaining uncle, Prince Jérôme Napoléon, former King of Westphalia, as [[Heir Presumptive|heir presumptive]], again bypassing the male line of Lucien. 

In May 1870, that [[order of succession]] was confirmed by referendum, except that Prince [[Napoléon Joseph Charles Paul Bonaparte|Napoléon Joseph]] (1822–1891), Jérôme's surviving son by his second wife, Duchess Catharina of Württemberg, was named to follow the emperor's son, the Prince Imperial [[Napoléon Eugène, Prince Imperial|Napoléon Eugène]] in the succession line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Meanwhile, the [[agnatic]] descendants of Jérôme Napoléon's branch (the [[Prince Napoléon Line]]) are still extant, and still hold the [[Pretender|dynastic claim]] to the Napoleonic legacy.

[[Iran]] has been divided into regions in a number of different ways historically.&lt;ref&gt;In general see {{Cite book|editor=[[Pirouz Mojtahedzadeh|Mojtahed-Zadeh, Pirouz]] |year=2007|title=Boundary Politics and International Boundaries of Iran: A Study of the Origin, Evolution, and Implications of the Boundaries of Modern Iran|publisher=Universal-Publishers|location=Boca Raton, Florida |isbn=978-1-58112-933-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been divided into five administrative regions since 2014.

==Current administrative regions==
Iran's [[Provinces of Iran|thirty-one provinces]] were grouped into five regions on 22 June 2014, based on a decision of [[Ministry of Interior (Iran)|Ministry of Interior]].&lt;ref name="MoI"&gt;{{Cite news|date=22 June 2014|title=همشهری آنلاین-استان‌های کشور به ۵ منطقه تقسیم شدند (Provinces were divided into 5 regions)|language=Persian|newspaper=Hamshahri Online|url=http://www.hamshahrionline.ir/details/263382/Iran/-provinces |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140623191332/http://www.hamshahrionline.ir/details/263382/Iran/-provinces |archivedate=23 June 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this change, the adjacency, geographical location and similarities of the provinces were considered.&lt;ref name="MoI" /&gt;

The Constitution of Iran does not provide for regions and they are not the constituent units of the country, but exist purely for the convenience of governmental administration.

According to Javad Naserian, Ministry of Interior's Management Development and Human Resources Vice-Minister, the purpose of this grouping of provinces was creation of synergy, transfer of experience, information exchange, and regional development. Also, it now provides an intermediate level where provinces can discuss their problems among themselves, instead of going immediately to [[Tehran]].&lt;ref name="MoI" /&gt;

The intention was for each region to have regularly scheduled meetings of the constituent provinces' Governors-general, rotating the meeting place through the provincial capitals. The host province would provide the chairman of each meeting.
A regional secretariat would be established in the capital city of the main province of each region, with a coordinating bureau in the Ministry of Interior headquarters in Tehran.&lt;ref name="MoI" /&gt;

In 1937 the territory of Iran was divided into 10 administrative regions: {{illm|Region 1 (Iran)|fa|استان_یکم|lt=Region 1}}, {{illm|Region 2 (Iran)|fa|استان دوم|lt=Region 2}}, {{illm|Region 10 (Iran)|fa|استان_دهم|lt=Region 10}}, etc.&lt;sup&gt;([[:fa:پیشینه تقسیمات کشوری ایران|fa]])&lt;/sup&gt; For example, {{illm|Region 7 (Iran)|fa|استان هفتم|lt=Region 7}} or "Seventh Province" corresponded to present-day [[Fars Province]] per the "Territorial Subdivision Act of 1316 [[Solar Hijri calendar|Š.]]/1937 (Qānūn-e taqsīmāt-e kešvar)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work= [[Encyclopædia Iranica]] |title=Fars: Population |url= http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/fars-vi |accessdate= 10 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Histories, travel books and economic analyses often refer to less formal, more historical or geographical, Iranian regions.  The borders of these are not fixed and often have changed over time, and even overlapped at the same time.

The '''Ring of Fire''' is a major area in the [[Ocean basin|basin]] of the [[Pacific Ocean]] where many [[earthquake]]s and [[Types of volcanic eruptions|volcanic eruptions]] occur. In a large {{convert|40,000|km|mi|abbr=on}} horseshoe shape, it is associated with a nearly continuous series of [[oceanic trench]]es, [[volcanic arc]]s, and [[volcanic belt]]s and plate movements.

The southern portion is more complex, with a number of smaller tectonic plates in collision with the Pacific plate from the [[Mariana Islands]], the [[Philippines]], [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]], [[Tonga]], and [[New Zealand]].

== History ==
The presence of a belt of volcanic activity surrounding the Pacific Ocean was observed in the 19th century. "They [the Japanese Islands] are in the line of that immense circle of volcanic development which surrounds the shores of the Pacific from Tierra del Fuego around to the Moluccas." (Matthew Perry, ''Narrative of the Expedition of an American Squadron to the China Seas and Japan, 1852-54,'' Introduction, Section I, "Name, Extent, and Geography")

About 90%&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; of the world's earthquakes and 81%&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; of the world's largest earthquakes occur along the Ring of Fire. The next most seismically active region (5–6% of earthquakes and 17% of the world's largest earthquakes) is the [[Alpide belt]], which extends from [[Java (island)|Java]] to the northern [[Atlantic Ocean]] via the [[Himalayas]] and southern Europe.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

All but three of the world's 25 largest volcanic eruptions of the last 11,700 years occurred at volcanoes in the Ring of Fire.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The famous and very active [[San Andreas Fault]] zone of [[California]] is a [[transform fault]] which offsets a portion of the [[East Pacific Rise]] under the southwestern United States and Mexico; the motion of the fault generates numerous small earthquakes, at multiple times a day, most of which are too small to be felt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/map|title=Latest Earthquakes in the USA|publisher=USGS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/earthq3/|title=The San Andreas Fault|last1=Schulz|first1=Sandra S.|last2=Wallace|first2=Robert E.|publisher=USGS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The active [[Queen Charlotte Fault]] on the west coast of the [[Haida Gwaii]], [[British Columbia]], has generated three large earthquakes during the 20th century: a [[Richter magnitude scale|magnitude]] 7 event in 1929; a magnitude 8.1 in 1949 (Canada's largest recorded earthquake); and a magnitude 7.4 in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.litho.ucalgary.ca/publications/newsletter10.1/bird.html|title=Earthquakes in the Queen Charlotte Islands Region 1984–1996|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060418071705/http://www.litho.ucalgary.ca/publications/newsletter10.1/bird.html|archivedate=2006-04-18|deadurl=bot: unknown|accessdate=2007-10-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cause ==
[[File:Plates tect2 en.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Tectonic plates of the world]]
The Ring of Fire is a direct result of [[plate tectonics]]: the movement and collisions of [[lithosphere|lithospheric]] plates.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The eastern section of the ring is the result of the [[Nazca Plate]] and the [[Cocos Plate]] being [[subduction|subducted]] beneath the westward-moving [[South American Plate]]. The Cocos Plate is being subducted beneath the [[Caribbean Plate]], in [[Central America]]. A portion of the [[Pacific Plate]] and the small [[Juan de Fuca Plate]] are being subducted beneath the [[North American Plate]]. Along the northern portion, the northwestward-moving Pacific plate is being subducted beneath the [[Aleutian Islands]] arc. Farther west, the Pacific plate is being subducted along the [[Kamchatka Peninsula]] arcs on south past [[Japan]]. The southern portion is more complex, with a number of smaller tectonic plates in collision with the Pacific plate from the [[Mariana Islands]], the [[Philippines]], [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]], [[Tonga]], and [[New Zealand]]; this portion excludes [[Geography of Australia#Geology|Australia]], since it lies in the center of its tectonic plate. [[Indonesia]] lies between the Ring of Fire along the northeastern islands adjacent to and including [[New Guinea]] and the Alpide belt along the south and west from Sumatra, Java, [[Bali]], [[Flores]], and [[Timor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/09/29/asia/earthquakes-indonesia-explainer/index.html|title=Why Indonesia has so many earthquakes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|List of volcanoes in Bolivia}}

Bolivia hosts numerous active and extinct volcanoes across its territory. The active volcanoes are located in western Bolivia where they make up the [[Cordillera Occidental (Bolivia)|Cordillera Occidental]], the western limit of the [[Altiplano]] plateau. Many of the active volcanoes are international mountains shared with [[Chile]]. All [[Cenozoic]] volcanoes of Bolivia are part of the [[Central Volcanic Zone]] (CVZ) of the [[Andean Volcanic Belt]] that results due to processes involved in the [[subduction]] of the [[Nazca Plate]] under the [[South American Plate]]. The Central Volcanic Zone is a major upper [[Cenozoic]] volcanic province.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baker|first1=M.C.W.|last2=Francis|first2=P.W.|year=1978|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0012821X78900080|title=Upper Cenozoic Volcanism in the Central Andes – Ages and Volumes|doi=10.1016/0012-821X(78)90008-0|bibcode=1978E&amp;PSL..41..175B|volume=41|issue=2|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|pages=175–187}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from Andean volcanoes, the [[geology of Bolivia]] hosts the remnants of ancient volcanoes around the [[Precambrian]] Guaporé Shield in the eastern part of the country.

Earthquake activity in Chile is related to subduction of the Nazca Plate to the east.  Chile notably holds the record for the [[largest earthquakes|largest earthquake]] ever recorded, the [[1960 Valdivia earthquake]]. [[Villarrica (volcano)|Villarrica]], one of Chile's most active volcanoes, rises above [[Villarrica Lake]] and the town of [[Villarrica, Chile|Villarrica]]. It is the westernmost of three large [[stratovolcano]]es that trend perpendicular to the Andean chain. A 6-km-wide [[caldera]] formed during the late [[Pleistocene]], more than 0.9 million years ago.

A 2-km-wide postglacial caldera is located at the base of the presently active, dominantly basaltic-to-andesitic cone at the northwest margin of the Pleistocene caldera. About 25 scoria cones dot Villarica's flanks. [[Plinian eruption]]s and [[pyroclastic flow]]s have been produced during the [[Holocene]] from this dominantly basaltic volcano, but historical eruptions have consisted of largely mild-to-moderate explosive activity with occasional lava effusion. [[Lahar]]s from the glacier-covered volcanoes have damaged towns on its flanks.

The Llaima Volcano is one of the largest and most active volcanoes in Chile. It is situated 82&amp;nbsp;km northeast of [[Temuco, Chile|Temuco]] and 663&amp;nbsp;km southeast of [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], within the borders of [[Conguillío National Park]].  Llaima’s activity has been documented since the 17th century, and consists of several separate episodes of moderate explosive eruptions with occasional lava flows. The last major eruption occurred in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chile volcano forces evacuations|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7167639.stm|work=BBC|date=January 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lascar eruption 2006b - cropped.jpg|thumb|Lascar erupting in 2006]]

Chile has experienced numerous volcanic eruptions from 60 volcanoes, including Llaima Volcano and the [[Chaitén Volcano]]. More recently, a [[2010 Chile earthquake|magnitude-8.8 earthquake struck central Chile on February 27, 2010]], the Puyehue-Cordón Caulle volcano [[2011 Puyehue-Cordón Caulle eruption|erupted in 2011]], and a [[2014 Iquique earthquake|M8.2 earthquake struck northern Chile on April 1, 2014]].  The main shock was preceded by a number of moderate to large shocks and was followed by a large number of moderate to very large aftershocks, including a magnitude-7.6 event on 2 April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/recenteqsww/Quakes/us2010tfan.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100410032038/http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/recenteqsww/Quakes/us2010tfan.php|archivedate=2010-04-10|title=Magnitude 8.8 – OFFSHORE MAULE, CHILE|date=February 27, 2010|publisher=|accessdate=February 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lascar (volcano)|Lascar]] is a stratovolcano, is the most active volcano of the northern Chilean Andes.  The largest eruption of Lascar took place about 26,500&amp;nbsp;years ago, and following the eruption of the Tumbres scoria flow about 9,000&amp;nbsp;years ago, activity shifted back to the eastern edifice, where three overlapping craters were formed. Frequent small-to-moderate explosive eruptions have been recorded from Lascar in historical time since the mid-19th century, along with periodic larger eruptions that produced ash and [[tephra]] fall up to hundreds of kilometers away from the volcano.&lt;ref name=gvp /&gt;  The largest eruption of Lascar in recent history took place in 1993, producing [[pyroclastic flow]]s as far as {{Convert|8.5|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} northwest of the summit and ash fall in [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina,&lt;ref name=gvp /&gt; more than {{Convert|1600|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} to the southeast. The latest series of eruptions began on 18 April 2006 and was continuing as of 2011.

[[Chiliques]] is a stratovolcano located in the [[Antofagasta Region]] of Chile, immediately north of [[Cerro Miscanti]]. [[Laguna Lejía]] lies to the north of the volcano and has been dormant for at least 10,000&amp;nbsp;years, but is now showing signs of life. A January 6, 2002, nighttime thermal infrared image from [[Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer|ASTER]] revealed a hot spot in the summit crater, as well as several others along the upper flanks of the volcano’s edifice, indicating new volcanic activity. Examination of an earlier nighttime thermal infrared image from May 24, 2000, showed no such hot spots.&lt;ref name="nasa"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://visibleearth.nasa.gov/view.php?id=2377 | title = Chiliques Volcano, Chile | work = Visible Earth | publisher = [[NASA]] | accessdate = 2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Calbuco (volcano)|Calbuco]] is a stratovolcano in southern Chile, located southeast of [[Llanquihue Lake]] and northwest of [[Chapo Lake]], in [[Los Lagos Region]]. The volcano and the surrounding area are protected within [[Llanquihue National Reserve]]. It is a very explosive [[andesite]] volcano that underwent edifice collapse in the late [[Pleistocene]], producing a volcanic [[debris avalanche]] that reached the lake.  At least nine eruptions occurred since 1837, with the latest one in 1972. One of the largest historical eruptions in southern Chile took place there in 1893–1894. Violent eruptions ejected 30-cm bombs to distances of 8&amp;nbsp;km from the crater, accompanied by voluminous hot lahars. Strong explosions occurred in April 1917, and a [[lava dome]] formed in the crater accompanied by hot lahars. Another short explosive eruption in January 1929 also included an apparent pyroclastic flow and a lava flow. The last major eruption of Calbuco, in 1961, sent ash columns 12–15&amp;nbsp;km high and produced plumes that dispersed mainly to the southeast and two lava flows were also emitted. A minor, four-hour eruption happened on August 26, 1972. Strong fumarolic emission from the main crater was observed on August 12, 1996.

[[Lonquimay (volcano)|Lonquimay]] is a stratovolocano of late-Pleistocene to dominantly Holocene age, with the shape of a truncated cone. The cone is largely andesitic, though [[basalt]]ic and [[dacite|dacitic]] rocks are present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.volcano.si.edu/world/volcano.cfm?vnum=1507-10=|title=Global Volcanism Program – Lonquimay|work=si.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is located in [[La Araucanía Region]] of [[Chile]], immediately southeast of [[Tolhuaca (volcano)|Tolhuaca]] volcano. [[Sierra Nevada (stratovolcano)|Sierra Nevada]] and Llaima are their neighbors to the south. The snow-capped volcano lies within the protected area [[Malalcahuello-Nalcas]].  The volcano last erupted in 1988, ending in 1990. The [[Volcanic Explosivity Index|VEI]] was 3. The eruption was from a flank vent and involved lava flows and explosive eruptions. Some fatalities occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.volcano.si.edu/world/volcano.cfm?vnum=1507-10=&amp;volpage=erupt|title=Global Volcanism Program – Lonquimay|work=si.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Antuco Volcano]] is a stratovolocano located in the [[Bío Bío Region]] of Chile, near [[Sierra Velluda]] and on the shore of [[Laguna del Laja]], with its last eruption in 1869.

[[Villarrica (volcano)|Villarrica]] is one of Chile's most active volcanoes, rising above the [[Lake Villarrica|lake]] and [[Villarrica, Chile|town]] of the same name. The volcano is also known as ''Rucapillán'', a [[Mapudungun|Mapuche]] word meaning "House of the [[Pillán]]". It is the westernmost of three large stratovolcanoes that trend perpendicular to the Andes along the [[Gastre Fault Zone|Gastre Fault]].  Villarrica, along with [[Quetrupillán]] and the Chilean portion of [[Lanín]], are protected within [[Villarrica National Park]]. Ascents of the volcano are popular with several guided ascents reaching the top during summer.

Villarrica, with its lava of basaltic-andesitic composition, is one of only five volcanoes worldwide known to have an active [[lava lake]] within its crater. The volcano usually generates [[strombolian eruption]]s, with ejection of [[incandescent]] pyroclasts and lava flows. Melting of snow and [[glacier|glacier ice]], as well as rainfall, often causes massive lahars, such as during the eruptions of 1964 and 1971.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.povi.cl/files/h_1971.pdf La erupción de 1971], Villarrica Volcano Visual Observation Project. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1738, Cotopaxi has erupted more than 50 times, resulting in the creation of numerous valleys formed by mudflows around the volcano.

In October 1999, Pichincha Volcano erupted in Quito and covered the city with several inches of [[Volcanic ash|ash]]. Prior to that, the last major eruptions were in 1553&lt;ref name="Weather, Kington 2010"&gt;Climate and Weather, Kington, J.

It exhibits mostly [[Strombolian eruption|strombolian]] activity; the most recent eruption, which started in 1934, is still going on. Geologically, Sangay marks the southern bound of the [[Northern Volcanic Zone]], and its position straddling two major pieces of [[Crust (geology)|crust]] accounts for its high level of activity. Sangay's roughly 500,000-year history is one of instability; two previous versions of the mountain were destroyed in massive flank collapses, evidence of which still litters its surroundings today.  Sangay is one of two active volcanoes located within the namesake [[Sangay National Park]], the other being Tungurahua to the north. As such, it has been listed as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] since 1983.

[[Reventador]] is an active stratovolcano which lies in the eastern Andes of Ecuador.  Since 1541, it has erupted over 25 times, with its most recent eruption in 2009,&lt;ref name="news.yahoo.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1A1-D94C87UO0.html|title=Reventador volcano spews lava near Ecuador capital|publisher=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the largest historical eruption occurred in 2002. During that eruption, the plume from the volcano reached a height of 17&amp;nbsp;km, and pyroclastic flows went up to 7&amp;nbsp;km from the cone.  On March 30, 2007, the mountain spewed ash again. The ash reached a height of about two miles (3&amp;nbsp;km, 11,000&amp;nbsp;ft).

[[Cotopaxi]], outside of [[Quito]], started activity in April 2015. A large increase in earthquakes (including harmonic tremors) and [[sulfur dioxide|SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] emissions began. IGPEN reported slight deformation of the edifice, suggesting an intrusion of magma under the volcano.

Volcanoes of Mexico are related to subduction of the [[Cocos Plate|Cocos]] and [[Rivera Plate|Rivera]] plates to the east, which has produced large, explosive eruptions. Most active volcanoes in Mexico occur in the [[Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt]], which extends {{Convert|900|km|mi|0}} from west to east across central-southern Mexico. A few other active volcanoes in northern Mexico are related to [[extensional tectonics]] of the [[Basin and Range Province]], which splits the Baja California peninsula from the mainland.&lt;ref name="AA"&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050309061128/http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Volcanoes/Mexico/description_mexico_volcanoes.html|title=Mexico Volcanoes and Volcanics|publisher=USGS|url=http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Volcanoes/Mexico/description_mexico_volcanoes.html|archivedate=2005-03-09|accessdate=2007-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Popocatépetl]], lying in the eastern half of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, is the second-highest peak in Mexico after the [[Pico de Orizaba]]. It is one of the most active volcanoes in Mexico, having had more than 20 major eruptions since the arrival of the Spanish in 1519. The 1982 eruption of [[El Chichón]], which killed about 2,000 people who lived near the volcano, created a 1-km-wide caldera that filled with an acidic crater lake. Prior to 2000, this relatively unknown volcano was heavily forested and of no greater height than adjacent nonvolcanic peaks.&lt;ref name="AA" /&gt;

[[File:Cascadia subduction zone USGS.png|thumb|left|Area of the [[Cascadia subduction zone]], including the [[Cascade Volcanoes|Cascade Volcanic Arc]] (red triangles)]]

The [[United States Geological Survey]] and the [[National Earthquake Information Center]] (NEIC) are located on the campus of the [[Colorado School of Mines]] in [[Golden, Colorado]]. Both monitor volcanos in the United States; in the western United States lies the [[Cascade Volcanoes|Cascade Volcanic Arc]]. It includes nearly 20 major volcanoes, among a total of over 4,000 separate volcanic vents including numerous stratovolcanoes, shield volcanoes, lava domes, and cinder cones, along with a few isolated examples of rarer volcanic forms such as [[tuya]]s. Volcanism in the arc began about 37 million years ago, but most of the present-day Cascade volcanoes are less than 2,000,000 years old, and the highest peaks are less than 100,000 years old. The arc formed by the subduction of the [[Gorda Plate|Gorda]] and [[Juan de Fuca Plate|Juan de Fuca]] plates at the [[Cascadia subduction zone]]. This is a 680-mi-long [[Fault (geology)|fault]], running {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=on}} off the coast of the [[Pacific Northwest]] from northern California to [[Vancouver Island]], British Columbia. The plates move at a relative rate over 0.4&amp;nbsp;in (10&amp;nbsp;mm) per year at a somewhat oblique angle to the subduction zone.

Because of the very large fault area, the Cascadia subduction zone can produce very large earthquakes, magnitude 9.0 or greater, if rupture occurred over its whole area. When the "locked" zone stores energy for an earthquake, the "transition" zone, although somewhat plastic, can rupture. Thermal and deformation studies indicate that the locked zone is fully locked for 60&amp;nbsp;km (about 40&amp;nbsp;mi) down-dip from the deformation front. Further down-dip, a transition from fully locked to [[aseismic creep|aseismic sliding]] occurs.

[[File:Cascade eruptions in the last 4000 years.png|thumb|American [[Cascade Range]] volcano eruptions in the last 4000 years]]

Unlike most subduction zones worldwide, no [[oceanic trench]] is present along the [[continental margin]] in [[Cascadia subduction zone|Cascadia]]. Instead, [[terrane]]s and the [[accretionary wedge]] have been lifted up to form a series of coast ranges and exotic mountains. A high rate of sedimentation from the outflow of the three major rivers ([[Fraser River]], [[Columbia River]], and [[Klamath River]]) which cross the Cascade Range contributes to further obscuring the presence of a trench. However, in common with most other subduction zones, the outer margin is slowly being compressed, similar to a giant [[spring (device)|spring]]. When the stored energy is suddenly released by slippage across the fault at irregular intervals, the Cascadia subduction zone can create very large earthquakes such as the magnitude-9 [[1700 Cascadia earthquake|Cascadia earthquake of 1700]]. Geological evidence indicates that great earthquakes may have occurred at least seven times in the last 3,500 years, suggesting a return time of 400 to 600 years. Also, evidence of accompanying tsunamis with every earthquake is seen, as the prime reason these earthquakes are known is through "scars" the tsunami left on the coast, and through [[Japan]]ese records (tsunami waves can travel across the Pacific).

The [[1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens]] was the most significant to occur in the contiguous 48 U.S. states in recorded history ([[Volcanic Explosivity Index|VEI]] = 5, 0.3&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;mi, 1.2&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of material erupted), exceeding the destructive power and volume of material released by the 1915 eruption of California's [[Lassen Peak]]. The eruption was preceded by a two-month series of earthquakes and steam-venting episodes caused by an injection of [[magma]] at shallow depth below the mountain that created a huge bulge and a fracture system on [[Mount St. Helens]]' north slope. An earthquake at 8:32&amp;nbsp;am on May 18, 1980, caused the entire weakened north face to slide away, suddenly exposing the partly molten, gas- and steam-rich rock in the volcano to lower pressure. The rock responded by exploding into a very hot mix of pulverized lava and older rock that sped toward [[Spirit Lake (Washington)|Spirit Lake]] so fast that it quickly passed the avalanching north face.

[[Alaska]] is known for its seismic and volcanic activity, holding the record for the second-largest earthquake in the world, the [[Good Friday earthquake]], and having more than 50 volcanoes which have erupted since about 1760.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avo.alaska.edu/volcanoes/about.php |title=Alaska Volcano Observatory – About Alaska's Volcanoes |publisher=Avo.alaska.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volcanoes can be found not only in the mainland, but also in the [[Aleutian Islands]].

The most recent activity in the American portion of the Ring of Fire occurred in early 2009 when [[Mount Redoubt]] in Alaska became active and finally erupted late in the evening of March 22. The eruption ended in May 2009.

British Columbia and [[Yukon]] are home to a vast region of volcanoes and volcanic activity in the Pacific Ring of Fire.&lt;ref name="SE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skimountaineer.com/ROF/Region.php?region=AlaskaCanada|title=Skiing the Pacific Ring of Fire and Beyond: Alaska and Northwest Canada|accessdate=2007-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several mountains in populated areas of British Columbia are [[dormant volcano]]es. Most of these were active during the Pleistocene and Holocene epochs. Although none of Canada's volcanoes are currently erupting, several volcanoes, volcanic fields, and volcanic centers are considered potentially active.&lt;ref name="IJ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=14897949|publisher=CAT.INIST|title=Canadian volcanoes|accessdate=2007-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Hot spring]]s are at some volcanoes, while 10 volcanoes in British Columbia appear related to seismic activity since 1975, including: the [[Silverthrone Caldera]], [[Mount Meager massif]], [[Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field]], [[Mount Garibaldi]], [[Mount Cayley massif]], [[Castle Rock (volcano)|Castle Rock]], [[The Volcano (British Columbia)|The Volcano]], [[Mount Edziza]], [[Hoodoo Mountain]], [[Crow Lagoon]], and [[Nazko Cone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060528051236/http://www.bcminerals.ca/pdf/CanadianVolcanoes-CH2005.pdf|title=Volcanoes of Canada|url=http://www.bcminerals.ca/pdf/CanadianVolcanoes-CH2005.pdf |archivedate=2006-05-28|accessdate=2007-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The volcanoes are grouped into five volcanic belts with different tectonic settings.

The [[Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province]] (sometimes known as the Stikine Volcanic Belt) is the most active volcanic region in Canada. It formed due to extensional cracking, faulting, and [[rift]]ing of the North American Plate, as the Pacific Plate grinds and slides past the [[Queen Charlotte Fault]], unlike subduction that produces the volcanoes in Japan, the Philippines, and Indonesia. The region has Canada's largest volcanoes,&lt;ref name="SE" /&gt; much larger than the minor stratovolcanoes found in the Canadian portion of the [[Garibaldi Volcanic Belt|Cascade Volcanic Arc]].&lt;ref name="SE" /&gt; Several eruptions are known to have occurred within the last 400 years. [[Mount Edziza]] is a huge volcanic complex that erupted several times in the past several thousand years and has formed several cinder cones and lava flows. The complex comprises the [[Mount Edziza Plateau]], a large volcanic plateau (65&amp;nbsp;km long and 20&amp;nbsp;km wide) made of predominantly basaltic lava flows with four large stratovolcanoes built on top of the plateau. The associated lava domes and satellite cones were constructed over the past 7.5 million years during five magmatic cycles beginning with eruption of alkali basalts and ending with [[felsic]] and basaltic eruptions as late as 1,340 years ago. The blocky lava flows still maintain their original forms. Hoodoo Mountain is a [[tuya]] in northwestern British Columbia, which has had several periods of [[subglacial eruption]]s. The oldest eruptions occurred about 100,000 years ago and the most recent about 7000 years ago. Hoodoo Mountain is also considered active, so could erupt in the future. The nearby [[Tseax Cone]] and The Volcano produced some of Canada's youngest lava flows, about 150 years old.

[[File:Mount Edziza, British Columbia.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mount Edziza]], a large shield volcano in northwestern British Columbia]]

Canada's worst known geophysical disaster came from the Tseax Cone during the 18th century at the southernmost end of the volcanic belt. The eruption produced a 22.5-km-long lava flow, destroying the [[Nisga'a]] villages and the death of at least 2000 Nisga'a people by volcanic gases and poisonous smoke. The [[Nass River]] valley was inundated by the lava flows and contains abundant tree molds and lava tubes. The event happened at the same time as the arrival of the first European explorers to penetrate the uncharted coastal waters of northern British Columbia. Today, the basaltic lava deposits are a draw to tourists and are part of the [[Nisga'a Memorial Lava Beds Provincial Park]].

The [[Garibaldi Volcanic Belt]] in southwestern British Columbia is the northern extension of the Cascade Volcanic Arc in the United States (which includes [[Mount Baker]] and Mount St. Helens) and contains the most explosive young volcanoes in Canada.&lt;ref name="SW"&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060219225022/http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/volcanoes/cat/belt_garibaldi_e.php|work=Calalogue of Canadian volcanoes|title=Garibaldi Volcanic Belt|url=http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/volcanoes/cat/belt_garibaldi_e.php|archivedate=2006-02-19|accessdate=2007-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; It formed as a result of subduction of the Juan de Fuca Plate (a remnant of the much larger [[Farallon Plate]]) under the North American Plate along the Cascadia subduction zone.&lt;ref name="SW" /&gt; The Garibaldi Volcanic Belt includes the [[Bridge River Cones]], [[Mount Cayley massif]], [[Mount Fee]], [[Mount Garibaldi]], [[Mount Price (British Columbia)|Mount Price]], [[Mount Meager massif]], the Squamish Volcanic Field, and more smaller volcanoes. The eruption styles in the belt range from [[effusive eruption|effusive]] to [[explosive eruption|explosive]], with compositions from basalt to [[rhyolite]]. Morphologically, centers include calderas, cinder cones, stratovolcanoes and small isolated lava masses. Due to repeated continental and alpine glaciations, many of the volcanic deposits in the belt reflect complex interactions between magma composition, topography, and changing ice configurations. The most recent major catastrophic eruption in the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt was an explosive eruption of the Mount Meager massif about 2,350 years ago. It was similar to the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens,&lt;ref name="SW" /&gt; sending an [[eruption column|ash column]] about 20&amp;nbsp;km into the [[stratosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060219230054/http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/volcanoes/cat/volcano_e.php?id=gvb_mme_034|work=Catalogue of Canadian volcanoes|title=Mount Meager|url=http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/volcanoes/cat/volcano_e.php?id=gvb_mme_034|archivedate=2006-02-19|accessdate=2007-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MountMeagerPlinthCapricorn.jpg|thumb|The [[Mount Meager massif]] as seen from the east near Pemberton, BC: Summits left to right are [[Capricorn Mountain]], [[Mount Meager (British Columbia)|Mount Meager]], and [[Plinth Peak]].]]

The [[Chilcotin Group]] is a north-south range of volcanoes in southern British Columbia running parallel to the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt. The majority of the eruptions in this belt happened either 6–10 million years ago ([[Miocene]]) or 2–3 million years ago (Pliocene), although with some slightly more recent eruptions (in the Pleistocene).&lt;ref name="DA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/volcanoes/cat/belt_chilcotin_e.php|work=Catalogue of Canadian volcanoes|title=Chilcotin Plateau basalts|accessdate=2007-07-31|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080315000000/http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/volcanoes/cat/belt_chilcotin_e.php|archivedate=2008-03-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought to have formed as a result of [[back-arc basin|back-arc extension]] behind the Cascadia subduction zone.&lt;ref name="DA" /&gt; Volcanoes in this belt include [[Mount Noel]], the [[Clisbako Caldera Complex]], [[Lightning Peak (British Columbia)|Lightning Peak]], [[Black Dome Mountain]], and many lava flows.

The [[Anahim Volcanic Belt]] is a line of volcanoes stretching from just north of Vancouver Island to near [[Quesnel, British Columbia|Quesnel]], British Columbia. These volcanoes were formed 8 to 1 million years ago, and the Nazko Cone last erupted only 7,200 years ago.&lt;ref name="SA"&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060219224928/http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/volcanoes/cat/belt_anahim_e.php|work=Catalogue of Canadian volcanoes|title=Anahim Volcanic Belt|url=http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/volcanoes/cat/belt_anahim_e.php |archivedate=2006-02-19|accessdate=2007-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The volcanoes generally get younger moving from the coast to the interior. These volcanoes are thought to have formed as a result of the North American Plate sliding westward over a small [[hotspot (geology)|hotspot]], called the [[Anahim hotspot]].&lt;ref name="SA" /&gt; The hotspot is considered similar to the one feeding the [[Hawaiian Islands]].&lt;ref name="SA" /&gt; The belt is defined by three large [[shield volcano]]es ([[Rainbow Range (Coast Mountains)|Rainbow]], [[Ilgachuz Range|Ilgachuz]] and the [[Itcha Range]]s) and 37 [[Quaternary]] basalt centers.

Eruptions of basaltic to rhyolitic volcanoes and [[hypabyssal]] rocks of the [[Alert Bay Volcanic Belt]] in northern Vancouver Island are probably linked with the subducted margin flanked by the [[Explorer Plate|Explorer]] and Juan de Fuca Plates at the Cascadia subduction zone. It appears to have been active during the Pliocene and Pleistocene. However, no Holocene eruptions are known, and volcanic activity in the belt has likely ceased.

[[File:Avachinsky Volcano.jpg|thumb|left|[[Avachinsky]], an active volcano on the Kamchatka Peninsula.]]

The [[Kamchatka Peninsula]] in the [[Russian Far East]] is one of the most various and active volcanic areas in the world,&lt;ref name="DF"&gt;[http://www.skimountaineer.com/ROF/Region.php?region=Kamchatka Skiing the Pacific Ring of Fire and Beyond: Kamchatka &amp; Kuril Islands] Retrieved on 2007-08-01&lt;/ref&gt; with an area of 472,300&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. It lies between the Pacific Ocean to the east and the [[Okhotsk Sea]] to the west. Immediately offshore along the Pacific coast of the peninsula runs the 10,500-m-deep [[Kuril-Kamchatka Trench]], where rapid subduction of the Pacific Plate fuels the intense volcanism. Almost all types of volcanic activity are present, from stratovolcanoes and shield volcanoes to Hawaiian-style fissure eruptions.&lt;ref name="DF" /&gt;

Over 30 active volcanoes and hundreds of [[dormant volcano|dormant]] and [[extinct volcano|extinct]] volcanoes are in two major volcanic belts. The most recent activity takes place in the eastern belt,&lt;ref name="DF" /&gt; starting in the north at the [[Shiveluch]] volcanic complex, which lies at the junction of the [[Aleutian Islands|Aleutian]] and Kamchatka volcanic arcs. Just to the south is the famous [[Klyuchi]] volcanic group, comprising the twin volcanic cones of [[Kliuchevskoi]] and [[Kamen (volcano)|Kamen]], the huge volcanic complexes of [[Tolbachik]] and [[Ushkovsky]], and a number of other large stratovolcanoes. The only active volcano in the central belt is found west of here, the huge remote [[Ichinsky]]. Farther south, the eastern belt continues to the southern slope of Kamchatka, topped by loads of [[stratovolcano]]es, continuing onto the [[Kuril Islands]], and southwards into [[Japan]].{{clear}}

== Japan ==
{{Main|List of volcanoes in Japan}}

About 10% of the world's active volcanoes are found in Japan, which lies in a zone of extreme crustal instability. They are formed by subduction of the Pacific Plate and the [[Philippine Sea Plate]]. As many as 1,500 earthquakes are recorded yearly, and magnitudes of 4 to 6 are not uncommon. Minor tremors occur almost daily in one part of the country or another, causing some slight shaking of buildings. Major earthquakes occur infrequently; the most famous in the 20th century were: the [[Great Kantō earthquake]] of 1923, in which 130,000 people died; and the [[Great Hanshin earthquake]] of 17 January 1995, in which 6,434 people died. On March 11, 2011 [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|a magnitude 9.0 earthquake hit Japan]], the country's biggest ever and the fifth largest on record, according to US Geological Survey data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/list-japan-quake-seventh-largest-in-history-20110311-1brew.html |title=LIST: Japan quake seventh largest in history |publisher=Smh.com.au |date= 2011-03-11|accessdate=2011-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Undersea earthquakes also expose the Japanese coastline to danger from [[tsunami]]s.

[[File:FujiSunriseKawaguchiko2025WP.jpg|thumb|[[Mount Fuji]] at sunrise from [[Lake Kawaguchi]] ]]

[[Mount Bandai]], one of Japan's most noted volcanoes, rises above the north shore of [[Lake Inawashiro]]. Mount Bandai is formed of several overlapping stratovolcanoes, the largest of which is O-Bandai forming a [[complex volcano]]. O-Bandai volcano was constructed within a horseshoe-shaped [[caldera]] that formed about 40,000 years when an earlier volcano collapsed, forming the Okinajima debris avalanche, which traveled to the southwest and was accompanied by a [[plinian eruption]]. Four major [[phreatic eruption]]s have occurred during the past 5,000 years, two of them in historical time, in 806 and 1888. Seen from the south, Bandai presents a conical profile, but much of the north side of the volcano is missing as a result of the collapse of Ko-Bandai volcano during the 1888 eruption, in which a debris avalanche buried several villages and formed several large lakes.

Nearly a century ago, the north flank of Mount Bandai collapsed during an eruption quite similar to the May 18, 1980, eruption of Mount St. Helens. After a week of seismic activity, a large earthquake on July 15, 1888, was followed by a tremendous noise and a large explosion. Eyewitnesses heard about 15 to 20 additional explosions and observed that the last one was projected almost horizontally to the north.

[[Mount Fuji]] is Japan's highest and most noted volcano. The modern postglacial stratovolcano is constructed above a group of overlapping volcanoes, remnants of which form irregularities on Fuji's profile. Growth of the younger Mount Fuji began with a period of voluminous lava flows from 11,000 to 8,000 years ago, accounting for four-fifths of the volume of the younger Mount Fuji. Minor explosive eruptions dominated activity from 8,000 to 4,500 years ago, with another period of major lava flows occurring from 4,500 to 3,000 years ago. Subsequently, intermittent major explosive eruptions occurred, with subordinate lava flows and small pyroclastic flows. Summit eruptions dominated from 3,000 to 2,000 years ago, after which flank vents were active. The extensive basaltic lava flows from the summit and some of the more than 100 flank cones and vents blocked drainage against the [[Tertiary]] [[Misaka Mountains]] on the north side of the volcano, forming the [[Fuji Five Lakes]]. The last eruption of this dominantly basaltic volcano in 1707 ejected andesitic [[pumice]] and formed a large new crater on the east flank. Some minor volcanic activity may occur in the next few years.

== Philippines ==

[[File:MajorVolcanoesOfThePhilippines-USGS.gif|thumb|upright|Map showing major volcanoes of the [[Philippines]]]]

The 1991 eruption of [[Mount Pinatubo]] is the world's second-largest terrestrial eruption of the 20th century. Successful predictions of the onset of the climactic eruption led to the evacuation of tens of thousands of people from the surrounding areas, saving many lives, but as the surrounding areas were severely damaged by pyroclastic flows, ash deposits, and later, lahars caused by rainwater remobilising earlier volcanic deposits, thousands of houses were destroyed.

[[File:Mayon1984.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mayon Volcano]] overlooks a pastoral scene about five months before the volcano's violent eruption in September 1984.]]

[[Mayon Volcano]] is the Philippines' most active volcano. It has steep upper slopes that average 35–40° and is capped by a small summit crater. The historical eruptions of this basaltic-andesitic volcano date back to 1616 and range from [[Strombolian eruption|Strombolian]] to basaltic [[Plinian eruption]]s. Eruptions occur predominately from the central conduit and have also produced lava flows that travel far down the flanks. Pyroclastic flows and mudflows have commonly swept down many of the roughly 40 ravines that radiate from the summit and have often devastated populated lowland areas.

[[Taal Volcano]] has had 33 recorded eruptions since 1572. A devastating eruption occurred in 1911, which claimed more than a thousand lives. The deposits of that eruption consist of a yellowish, fairly decomposed (nonjuvenile) [[tephra]] with a high sulfur content. The most recent period of activity lasted from 1965 to 1977, and was characterized by the interaction of magma with the lake water, which produced violent phreatic and phreatomagmatic eruptions. Although the volcano has been dormant since 1977, it has shown signs of unrest since 1991, with strong seismic activity and ground-fracturing events, as well as the formation of small mud geysers on parts of the island.

[[Kanlaon Volcano]], the most active volcano in the central Philippines, has erupted 25 times since 1866. Eruptions are typically phreatic explosions of small-to-moderate size that produce minor ash falls near the volcano. On August 10, 1996, Kanlaon erupted without warning, killing British student Julian Green and Filipinos Noel Tragico and Neil Perez, who were among 24 mountain climbers who were trapped near the summit.

The volcanoes in [[Indonesia]] are among the most active of the Pacific Ring of Fire. They are formed due to subduction zones of three main active tectonic plates namely the [[Eurasian Plate]], Pacific Plate, and  [[Indo-Australian Plate]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antaranews.com/en/news/69302/ri-sits-on-pacific-ring-of-fire—official RI sits on Pacific "ring of fire" : official]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the volcanoes are notable for their eruptions, for instance, [[Krakatau]] for its global effects in 1883, [[Lake Toba]] for its [[supervolcano|supervolcanic]] eruption estimated to have occurred 74,000 BP, which was responsible for six years of [[volcanic winter]], and [[Mount Tambora]], for the most violent eruption in recorded history in 1815. The eruption of Mount Tambora caused widespread harvest failures in Northern Europe, the Northeastern United States, and eastern Canada in 1816, which was known as the [[Year Without a Summer]].

The most active volcanoes are [[Kelud]] and [[Mount Merapi]] on [[Java]] island, which have been responsible for thousands of deaths in the region. Since AD 1000, Kelud has erupted more than 30 times, of which the largest eruption was at scale 5 on the [[Volcanic Explosivity Index]], while Merapi has erupted more than 80 times. The [[International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior]] has named Merapi as a [[Decade Volcano]] since 1995 because of its high volcanic activity. Another active volcano is [[Sinabung]] which erupted since 2013 until now.

[[New Zealand]] contains the world's strongest concentration of youthful rhyolitic volcanoes, and voluminous sheets blanket much of the [[North Island]]. The earliest historically-dated eruption was at [[Whakaari/White Island]] in 1826,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051223201353/http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Volcanoes/NewZealand/description_new_zealand_volcanoes.html|publisher=USGS CVO|title=New Zealand Volcanoes and Volcanics|accessdate=2007-10-15|url=http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Volcanoes/NewZealand/description_new_zealand_volcanoes.html|archivedate=2005-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed in 1886 by the country's largest historical eruption at [[Mount Tarawera]].  Much of the region north of New Zealand's North Island is made up of [[seamount]]s and small islands, including 16 [[submarine volcano]]es. In the last 1.6 million years, most of New Zealand's volcanism is from the [[Taupo Volcanic Zone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geonet.org.nz/volcano|title=GeoNet|location=New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mount Ruapehu]], at the southern end of the Taupo Volcanic Zone, is one of the most active volcanoes.&lt;ref name="crlk"&gt;{{cite web| title=Crater&amp;nbsp;Lake Climb| url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/tracks-and-walks/central-north-island/ruapehu/mount-ruapehu-crater-climb/features/ | author=New Zealand Department of Conservation | accessdate=2006-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It began erupting at least 250,000 years ago. In recorded history, major eruptions have been about 50 years apart,&lt;ref name="crlk" /&gt; in 1895, 1945, and 1995–1996. Minor eruptions are frequent, with at least 60 since 1945. Some of the minor eruptions in the 1970s generated small ash falls and lahars that damaged ski fields.&lt;ref name="cniv"&gt;{{cite web|title=Central North Island Volcanoes| url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/national-parks/tongariro/features/central-north-island-volcanoes/ | author=New Zealand Department of Conservation|accessdate=2006-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between major eruptions, a warm acidic crater lake forms, fed by melting snow. Major eruptions may completely expel the lake water. Where a major eruption has deposited a tephra dam across the lake's outlet, the dam may collapse after the lake has refilled and risen above the level of its normal outlet, the outrush of water causing a large lahar. The most notable lahar caused the [[Tangiwai disaster]] on December 24, 1953, when 151 people aboard a Wellington to Auckland express train were killed after the lahar destroyed the Tangiwai rail bridge just moments before the train was due. In 2000, the [[ERLAWS]] system was installed on the mountain to detect such a collapse and alert the relevant authorities.

The [[Auckland volcanic field]] on the North Island of New Zealand has produced a diverse array of explosive craters, scoria cones, and lava flows. Currently [[dormant volcano|dormant]], the field is likely to erupt again with the next "hundreds to thousands of years", a very short timeframe in geologic terms.&lt;ref name="CONT"&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060116164441/http://www.arc.govt.nz/arc/library/c28192_2.pdf|title=Contingency Plan for the Auckland Volcanic Field|url=http://www.arc.govt.nz/arc/library/c28192_2.pdf |archivedate=2006-01-16|publisher=[[Auckland Regional Council]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field contains at least 40 volcanoes, most recently active about 600 years ago at [[Rangitoto Island]], erupting 2.3&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of lava.

{{Main|List of volcanoes in Antarctica}}
[[File:Mt erebus.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mount Erebus]], 1972]]

The Pacific Ring of Fire is completed in the south by the continent of [[Antarctica]],&lt;ref name="FD"&gt;[http://www.skimountaineer.com/ROF/Region.php?region=Antarctica Skiing the Pacific Ring of Fire and Beyond: Antarctica]. Retrieved 2007-07-31.&lt;/ref&gt; which includes many large volcanoes. The makeup and structure of the volcanoes in Antarctica change largely from the other places around the ring. In contrast, the [[Antarctic Plate]] is almost completely surrounded by extensional zones, with several [[mid-ocean ridge]]s which encircle it, with only a small subduction zone at the tip of the [[Antarctic Peninsula]], reaching eastward to the remote [[South Sandwich Islands]].&lt;ref name="FD" /&gt; The most well known volcano in Antarctica is [[Mount Erebus]], which is also the world's southernmost active volcano.&lt;ref name="FD" /&gt; In many respects the geology of the Antarctic Peninsula is an extension of the Andes, hence the name sometimes used by geologists: "[[Antarctandes]]". At the opposite side of the continent, the volcanoes of [[Victoria Land]] may be seen as the 'other end' of the Antarctandes, thus completing the Pacific Ring of Fire and continuing up through the [[Balleny Islands]] to [[New Zealand]].

Mount Erebus is the second-highest volcano in [[Antarctica]] (after [[Mount Sidley]]) and the southernmost active volcano on earth.  It is the [[List of islands by highest point|sixth-highest]] [[ultra mountain]] on an island.&lt;ref name="gvp"&gt;{{cite gvp| vnum = 1900-02=| name = Mount Erebus| accessdate = 2008-12-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With a summit elevation of {{Convert|3794|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, it is located on [[Ross Island]], which is also home to three inactive volcanoes, [[Mount Terror (Antarctica)|Mount Terror]], [[Mount Bird]], and [[Mount Terra Nova]].

The volcanoes of the [[Victoria Land]] area are the most well known in Antarctica,&lt;ref name="FD" /&gt; most likely because they are the most accessible. Much of Victoria Land is mountainous, developing the eastern section of the [[Transantarctic Mountains]], and the several scattered volcanoes include [[Mount Overlord]] and [[Mount Melbourne]] in the northern part.&lt;ref name="FD" /&gt; Farther south are two more well-known volcanoes, [[Mount Discovery]] and [[Mount Morning]], which are on the coast across from Mount Erebus and Mount Terror on Ross Island. The volcanism in this area is caused by rifting along a number of rift zones increasing mainly north-south similar to the coast.&lt;ref name="FD" /&gt;

[[Marie Byrd Land]] contains the largest volcanic region in Antarctica, covering a length of almost {{convert|600|mi|km|abbr=on}} along the Pacific coast.&lt;ref name="FD" /&gt; The volcanism is the result of rifting along the vast [[West Antarctic Rift]], which extends from the base of the Antarctic Peninsula to the surrounding area of Ross Island, and the volcanoes are found along the northern edge of the rift.&lt;ref name="FD" /&gt; Protruding up through the ice are a large number of major shield volcanoes, including Mount Sidley, which is the highest volcano in Antarctica.&lt;ref name="FD" /&gt; Although a number of the volcanoes are relatively young and are potentially active ([[Mount Berlin]], [[Mount Takahe]], [[Mount Waesche]], and [[Mount Siple]]), others such as [[Mount Andrus]] and [[Mount Hampton]] are over 10 million years old, yet maintain uneroded constructional forms.&lt;ref name="FD" /&gt; The desert-like surroundings of the Antarctic interior, along with a very thick and stable ice sheet which encloses and protects the bases of the volcanoes, which decreases the speed of erosion by an issue of perhaps a thousand relative to volcanoes in moist temperate or tropical climates.

{{Chinese|title=Sze Yup|pic=Location of Siyi within Guangdong China.png|piccap=Sze Yup location in Guangdong|c=四邑|p=Sìyì|w=Ssu&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;-i&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;|mi={{IPAc-cmn|si|4|yi|4}}|l=four counties|y=Seiyāp|j=sei3&amp;nbsp;jap1|c2=五邑|p2=Wǔyì|y2=Nghyāp|j2=ng5 jap1|l2=five counties}}

The '''Siyi''' or '''Four Counties''', also known by various [[Cantonese language|Cantonese]] romanizations such as '''Sze Yup''' and '''Seiyap''' refers to the four former counties of [[Xinhui]] (Sunwui), [[Taishan, Guangdong|Taishan]] (Toisan), [[Kaiping]] (Hoiping) and [[Enping]] (Yanping) in the [[Pearl River Delta]] of southern [[Guangdong]] province, [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;Chinese American Names: Tradition and Transition - Page 118 Emma Woo Louie - 2008 "These were the Sam Yup and Sze Yup dialects, which the author spelled as “Saam Yup” and “Sz Yip,” respectively. Sam Yup means “Three Districts dialect,” which is akin to standard Cantonese, and Sze Yup means “Four Districts dialect.”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shanghai Girls - Page 8 Lisa See - 2010 "My first language was Sze Yup, the dialect spoken in the Four Districts in Kwangtung province, where our ancestral home is located...”&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[Xinhui]] is a city district and the other three are county-level cities, all four belong to [[Jiangmen|Jiangmen prefecture]] administered from the city of [[Jiangmen]]. Since [[Heshan, Guangdong|Heshan]] became governed by [[Jiangmen]] in 1983, Wuyi ({{zh|c={{linktext|五|邑}}|p=Wǔyì|l=five counties}}, sometimes "Ng Yap"), which refers to all the five counties of [[Xinhui]], [[Taishan, Guangdong|Taishan]], [[Kaiping]], [[Enping]] and [[Heshan, Guangdong|Heshan]], has become an official title, and is widely accepted by the local residents today. However, among overseas Chinese, the name Siyi (Cantonese: Sze Yup) is still popular and frequently used.

It is said that over 100 famous people come from the Siyi or Wuyi  region of Guangdong province, making the region famous for producing more entertainment stars than any other region in mainland China. As a result, the local government in Jiangmen which administers the Siyi or Wuyi cities of Taishan, Kaiping, Enping, Xinhui, and Heshan, decided to build a Stars Park called [[Jiangmen Star Park]].

==Dialects==
The area gave rise to the [[Siyi dialect]]s, the most prominent of which is [[Taishanese]] (Toisanese/Hoisanese). Although Siyi and [[Standard Cantonese|Cantonese]] both belong to the [[Yue Chinese|Yue branch]] of Chinese, Cantonese speakers cannot easily understand Siyi dialect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Phonology of Cantonese - Page 192 Oi-kan Yue Hashimoto - 1972 "... affricates and aspirated stops into consonant clusters is for external comparative purposes, because the Cantonese aspirated stops correspond to /h/ and some of the Cantonese affricates correspond to stops in many Si-yi (Seiyap) dialects."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Language in the USA - Page 217 Charles A. Ferguson, Shirley Brice Heath, David Hwang - 1981 "Even the kind of Cantonese which the Chinese Americans speak causes difficulties, because most of them have come from the rural Seiyap districts southwest of Canton and speak dialects of that region rather than the Standard Cantonese of the city"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emigration==
{{see also|Chinese emigration}}
In the late 19th century and early 20th century, many people from the Siyi (or Sze Yup as it was then known) emigrated to [[Hong Kong]], [[Southeast Asia]], [[Australasia]], [[North America]] and [[South America]]. Of the [[Chinese American]] population from that time until the 1950s, Sze Yup accounted for the vast majority, about 80%, along with people from [[Sanyi|Sanyi (Sam Yup)]] and [[Zhongshan]].&lt;ref name="pan"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pan|first1=Lynn|title=The Encyclopedia of the Chinese Overseas|date=1999|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=0674252101|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In America, people from Siyi (Sze Yup) generally worked as laborers; Sanyi (Sam Yup) people worked as entrepreneurs; and Zhongshan people specialized in agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Making of the American West: People and Perspectives|editor1-first=Peter|editor1-last=Mancall|editor2-first=Benjamin Heber|editor2-last=Johnson|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2007|chapter=Asians and Asian Americans in the West|first=Lisa|last=Hsia|pages=161–187}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Punti-Hakka Clan Wars]] also erupted in the Siyi counties just prior to this time period of emigration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apex.net.au/~jgk/taishan/phcwar.html Punti-Hakka Clan Wars and Taishan County] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070910212104/http://www.apex.net.au/%7Ejgk/taishan/phcwar.html |date=2007-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1851, two [[huiguan]]s (native place associations) were established in [[San Francisco]]: the ''Siyi Huiguan'' and the ''Sanyi Huiguan''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=East Asian Americans and Political Participation: A Reference Handbook|first=Tsung|last=Chi|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2005|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Endowed with only limited arable lands, with much of the terrain either rocky or swampy, Siyi (Sze Yup) was the "pre-eminent sending area" of overseas Chinese.&lt;ref name="pan" /&gt;

In addition to being a region of major emigration abroad, Siyi (Sze Yup) is a melting pot of ideas and trends brought back by overseas Chinese. For example, many [[tong lau]] in [[Chikan, Kaiping]] and [[diaolou]] in [[Kaiping]] and [[Taishan, Guangdong|Taishan]] built in the early 20th century incorporate architectural features from both China and the West.&lt;ref name="pan2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pan|first1=Lynn|title=The Encyclopedia of the Chinese Overseas|date=1999|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=0674252101|pages=28-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
