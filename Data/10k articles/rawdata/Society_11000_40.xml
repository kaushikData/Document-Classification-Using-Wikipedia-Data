'''African immigrants to Greece''' are citizens or residents of [[Greece]] who have recent ancestors from nations in [[Africa]].

==Overview==
Some families of African descent, who came to Greece as [[Afro Turks|African slaves in the times of the Ottoman Empire]], still live in the village of [[Avato]] and are Sunni Muslims. Some of them lived before the [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey]] also on the island of [[Crete]].&lt;ref&gt;Kenya-Crète-Istanbul: Biographie d'une famille d'esclaves, Paris, Librairie Özgül, 2006 {{ISBN|978-2-910901-02-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of African immigrants arrived in Greece in 1997. However, most came during the 2000s. The majority of the immigrants migrated from [[Biafra]], [[Nigeria]] and [[Senegal]]. Some of them also come from [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]], [[Zambia]] and [[Angola]]. Most live in the [[Patissia]] and [[Kypseli, Athens|Kypseli]] area in [[Athens]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hitgreece.com/expats/immigrants-part3 Main ethnic groups of immigrants in Greece &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Some African immigrants and Greek citizens with ancestry from Africa report being the victim of racist harassment and assaults from suspected far-right Greek [[Golden Dawn (political party)|Golden Dawn]] party members.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/12/greece-racist-attacks_n_2116302.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://greece.greekreporter.com/2013/05/29/black-panthers-will-fight-golden-dawn/|title=Black Panthers Will Fight Golden Dawn {{!}} GreekReporter.com|website=greece.greekreporter.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bhil Kataria''' are a sub-division of the [[Bhil]] community found in the state of [[Rajasthan]] in [[India]]. They are known as Kataria Bhil because they inhabit the Kataria region of Rajasthan. It is an area that covers parts of the districts of [[Udaipur District|Udaipur]], [[Dungarpur]] and [[Banswara District|Banswara]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated159"&gt;People of India Rajasthan Volume XXXVIII Part One  edited by B.K Lavania, D. K Samanta, S K Mandal  &amp; N.N Vyas pages 159 to 164 Popular Prakashan&lt;/ref&gt;

Their clans are known as ''atak'', and there are said to be at least eighty four ataks. The Kataria are a community of small and medium-sized farmers. Most of their settlements are exclusively Kataria, and each of them contains an informal caste association. This acts as an instrument of social control, punishing those who transgress community norms. They are entirely [[Hindu]] and unlike other [[Bhil]] groups do not have non Hindu tribal deities. The Kataria speak the [[Bagri language|Bagri]] dialect of [[Rajasthani language|Rajasthani]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated159"/&gt;

== Marriage ==

Like other Bhil groups, they are [[endogamous]]. They have a greater level of distance from assimilation by [[Brahminical]] [[Sanskritisation]].

'''Cannabis use disorder''' ('''CUD'''), also known as '''cannabis addiction''' or '''marijuana addiction''', is defined in the fifth revision of the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] ([[DSM-5]]) and [[ICD-10]] published by [[World Health Organization]] as the continued use of cannabis despite clinically significant impairment, ranging from mild to severe.&lt;ref name=nida&gt;{{citation|last=National Institute on Drug Abuse|title=The Science of Drug Abuse and Addiction: The Basics|url=https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/media-guide/science-drug-abuse-addiction-basics|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Gordon2013&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gordon AJ, Conley JW, Gordon JM |title=Medical consequences of marijuana use: a review of current literature |journal=Curr Psychiatry Rep |volume=15 |issue=12 |pages=419 |date=December 2013 |pmid=24234874 |doi=10.1007/s11920-013-0419-7 |type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

== Signs and symptoms ==

Marijuana use and abuse has symptoms that affect behavior, physical, cognitive, and psychosocial aspects of a person's life. Symptoms include agitation, bloodshot eyes, challenges in problem solving, and paranoia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cannabis Symptoms|url=http://www.timberlineknolls.com/drug-addiction/marijuana/signs-effects/|website=Timberline Knolls|accessdate=7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cannabis use is [[Long-term effects of cannabis#Mental health|associated with comorbid mental health problems]], such as mood and anxiety disorders, and discontinuing cannabis use is difficult for some users.&lt;ref name=Danovitch2012/&gt; Psychiatric comorbidities are often present in dependent cannabis users including a range of personality disorders.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://bv8ja7kw5x.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/summon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=Cannabis%3A+Use+and+dependence&amp;rft.jtitle=Presse+m%C3%A9dicale+%28Paris%2C+France+%3A+1983%29&amp;rft.au=Dervaux%2C+Alain&amp;rft.au=Laqueille%2C+Xavier&amp;rft.date=2012-12-01&amp;rft.issn=0755-4982&amp;rft.volume=41&amp;rft.issue=12%20Pt%201&amp;rft.spage=1233&amp;rft_id=info:pmid/23040955&amp;rft.externalDocID=23040955&amp;paramdict=en-AU|title = Cannabis: Use and dependence|last = Dervaux|first = Alain|date = December 2012|journal = La Presse Médicale|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of cannabis at a young age such as the teenage years, can have serious impacts on depression and anxiety in youth and later in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ncpic.org.au/professionals/publications/factsheets/cannabis-and-young-people/|title=Cannabis and young people {{!}} NCPIC|last=NCPIC|website=ncpic.org.au|access-date=2016-09-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309211757/https://ncpic.org.au/professionals/publications/factsheets/cannabis-and-young-people/#|archive-date=9 March 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that cannabis use during adolescence, at a time when the brain is still developing, may have deleterious effects on neural development and later cognitive functioning.&lt;ref name=McLaren/&gt; The brain is not completely developed until a person reaches the age range of 22-27.

===Dependency===
Prolonged marijuana use produces both [[pharmacokinetic]] changes (how the drug is absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and excreted) and [[pharmacodynamic]] changes (how the drug interacts with target cells) to the body. These changes require the user to consume higher doses of the drug to achieve a common desirable effect (known as a higher tolerance), reinforcing the body's metabolic systems for eliminating the drug more efficiently&lt;ref name="joy"&gt;{{Cite book| title=Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing The Science Base |author1=J.E. Joy |author2=S. J. Watson, Jr. |author3=J.A.

Cannabis users have shown decreased reactivity to dopamine, suggesting a possible link to a dampening of the reward system of the brain and an increase in negative emotionality and addiction severity.&lt;ref name="Madras2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Madras|first1=B. K.|title=Dopamine challenge reveals neuroadaptive changes in marijuana abusers|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=111|issue=33|year=2014|pages=11915–11916|issn=0027-8424|doi=10.1073/pnas.1412314111|pmid=25114244|pmc=4143049}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cannabis users can develop tolerance to the effects of [[THC]]. Tolerance to the behavioral and psychological effects of THC has been demonstrated in adolescent humans and animals.&lt;ref name=gonzalez&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gonzalez|first1=S|last2=Cebeira|first2=M|last3=Fernandez-Ruiz|first3=J|title=Cannabinoid tolerance and dependence: A review of studies in laboratory animals|journal=Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior|date=June 2005|volume=81|issue=2|pages=300–318|doi=10.1016/j.pbb.2005.01.028}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maldonado|first1=R.|last2=Berrendero|first2=F.|last3=Ozaita|first3=A.|last4=Robledo|first4=P.|title=Neurochemical basis of cannabis addiction|journal=Neuroscience|date=May 2011|volume=181|pages=1–17|doi=10.1016/j.neuroscience.2011.02.035}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanisms that create this tolerance to THC are thought to involve changes in cannabinoid receptor function.&lt;ref name=gonzalez/&gt;

According to the [[National Cannabis Prevention and Information Centre]] in Australia, a sign of cannabis dependence is that an individual spends noticeably more time than the average recreational user recovering from the use of or obtaining cannabis. For some, using cannabis becomes a substantial and disruptive part of an individual's life and he or she may exhibit difficulties in meeting personal obligations or participating in important life activities, preferring to use cannabis instead. People who are cannabis dependent have the inability to stop or decrease using cannabis on their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thehealingclinic.org/alcohol-vs-cannabis-2015-infographic/|title=Alcohol vs Cannabis 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=National Cannabis Prevention and Information|access-date=|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marijuana addiction is more common among heavy users. Marijuana use can lead to increased [[drug tolerance|tolerance]]&lt;ref name=Borgelt2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sewell2009&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sewell RA, Poling J, Sofuoglu M |title=The effect of cannabis compared with alcohol on driving |journal=Am J Addict |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=185–93 |year=2009 |pmid=19340636 |pmc=2722956 |doi=10.1080/10550490902786934 |type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in some users, withdrawal symptoms when trying to stop.&lt;ref name=Gordon2013&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gordon AJ, Conley JW, Gordon JM |title=Medical consequences of marijuana use: a review of current literature |journal=Curr Psychiatry Rep |volume=15 |issue=12 |pages=419 |date=December 2013 |pmid=24234874 |doi=10.1007/s11920-013-0419-7 |type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Danovitch2012/&gt;

===Withdrawal===
Cannabis withdrawal symptoms can occur in one half of patients in treatment for cannabis use disorders. These symptoms include dysphoria (anxiety, irritability, depression, restlessness), disturbed sleep, gastrointestinal symptoms, and decreased appetite. Most symptoms begin during the first week of abstinence and resolve after a few weeks.&lt;ref name=Danovitch2012/&gt;  The withdrawal symptoms are usually not severe, even after heavy use.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.druglibrary.org/SCHAFFER/library/studies/ledain/tolerance_and_dependence.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cause ==
Cannabis addiction is often due to prolonged and increasing use of the drug. Increasing the strength of the cannabis taken and an increasing use of more effective methods of delivery often increase the progression of cannabis dependency. It can also be caused by being prone to becoming addicted to substances, which can either be genetically  or environmentally acquired.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/182/4/330|title = Adolescent precursors of cannabis addiction: Findings from the Victorian Adolescent Health Cohort Study|last = Coffey1, Carlin2, Lynskey3, Li4, Patton5|first = Carolyn1, John B.2, Michael3, Ning4, George C.5|date = 1 April 2003|journal = The British Journal of Psychiatry|doi = 10.1192/bjp.182.4.330|pmid = |access-date = 17 April 2015|volume=182|pages=330–336}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Risk factors ===
Certain factors are considered to heighten the risk of developing cannabis dependence and longitudinal studies over a number of years have enabled researchers to track aspects of social and psychological development concurrently with cannabis use. Increasing evidence is being shown for the elevation of associated problems by the frequency and age at which cannabis is used, with young and frequent users being at most risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/marijuana | title=DrugFacts: Marijuana | publisher=National Institute on Drug Abuse | accessdate=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main factors in Australia, for example, related to a heightened risk for developing problems with cannabis use include frequent use at a young age; personal maladjustment; emotional distress; poor parenting; school drop-out; affiliation with drug-using peers; moving away from home at an early age; daily cigarette smoking; and ready access to cannabis. The researchers concluded there is emerging evidence that positive experiences to early cannabis use are a significant predictor of late dependence and that genetic predisposition plays a role in the development of problematic use.&lt;ref name=Copeland2004/&gt;

=== High risk groups ===

A number of groups have been identified as being at greater risk of developing cannabis dependence and, in Australia, for example, have been found to include adolescent populations, [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] and [[Torres Strait Islanders]] and people suffering from mental health conditions.&lt;ref name=McLaren&gt;McLaren, J, Mattick, R P., ''Cannabis in Australia Use, supply, harms, and responses'' Monograph series No. 57 Report prepared for: Drug Strategy Branch Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing. National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre University of New South Wales, Australia.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Adolescents ====

Young people are at greater risk of developing cannabis dependency because of the association between early initiation into substance use and subsequent problems such as dependence, and the risks associated with using cannabis at a developmentally vulnerable age.&lt;ref name=McLaren/&gt;

== Diagnosis ==
{{expand section|date=May 2018}}
Cannabis use disorder is recognized in the fifth version of the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' ([[DSM-5]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevisions/Pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=39# |title=Proposed Revision &amp;#124; APA DSM-5 |publisher=Dsm5.org |date= |accessdate=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; which added cannabis withdrawal as a new condition.&lt;ref name="highlights"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rogershospital.org/blog/dsm-5-now-categorizes-substance-use-disorders-single-continuum|title=DSM-5 Now Categorizes Substance Use Disorder in a Single Continuum|last=|first=|date=17 May 2013|website=|publisher=[[American Psychiatric Association]]|format=PDF|access-date=|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some healthcare facilities have been known to diagnose patients with Cannabis Use Disorder, even when the patient does not exhibit or experience any of the criteria for the disorder, simply on the basis that the patient uses cannabis in any manner.  Patients receiving this false diagnosis have, in some cases, been denied insurance benefits and employment as a result of the false diagnosis, leaving the healthcare facilities vulnerable to legal action.

== Treatment==
Clinicians differentiate between casual users who have difficulty with drug screens, and daily heavy users, to a chronic user who uses multiple times a day.&lt;ref name=Mcd&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JJk52UeE6hYC&amp; Clinical Textbook of Addictive Disorders], Marijuana, [[David McDowell]], page 169, Published by [[Guilford Press]], 2005 {{ISBN|1-59385-174-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  

=== Psychological ===

[[Psychological intervention]] includes [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT), [[motivational enhancement therapy]] (MET), [[contingency management]] (CM), supportive-expressive psychotherapy (SEP), family and systems interventions, and [[twelve-step program]]s.&lt;ref name=Danovitch2012/&gt;

Evaluations of [[Marijuana Anonymous]] programs, modelled on the 12-step lines of [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] and [[Narcotics Anonymous]], have shown small beneficial effects for general drug use reduction.{{mcn|date=December 2013}} In 2006, the Wisconsin Initiative to Promote Healthy Lifestyles implemented a program that helps primary care physicians identify and address marijuana use problems in patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/profiles/support-collaborative-primary-care-practices-identify-and-address-behavioral-health-issues |title=With Support From Collaborative, Primary Care Practices Identify and Address Behavioral Health Issues, Reducing Binge Drinking, Marijuana Use, and Depression Symptoms |date=2013-05-08 |accessdate=2013-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Barriers to treatment ===

Research that looks at barriers to cannabis treatment frequently cites a lack of interest in treatment, lack of motivation and knowledge of treatment facilities, an overall lack of facilities, costs associated with treatment, difficulty meeting program eligibility criteria and transport difficulties.&lt;ref name="autogenerated367"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1080/09687630600761444 | last1 = Treloar | first1 = C. | last2 = Holt | first2 = M. | year = 2006 | title = Deficit models and divergent philosophies: Service providers' perspectives on barriers and incentives to drug treatment | url = | journal = Drugs: Education prevention and policy | volume = 13 | issue = 4| pages = 367–382 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Treloar, C., Abelson, J., Cao, W., Brener, L., Kippax, S., Schultz, L., Schultz, M., &amp; Bath, N.

===Treatment for dependency===
In the US, {{asof|2013|lc=yes}}, cannabis is the most commonly identified illicit substance used by people admitted to treatment facilities.&lt;ref name=Borgelt2013&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Borgelt LM, Franson KL, Nussbaum AM, Wang GS |title=The pharmacologic and clinical effects of medical cannabis |journal=Pharmacotherapy |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=195–209 |date=February 2013 |pmid=23386598 |doi=10.1002/phar.1187 |type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Demand for treatment for cannabis use disorder increased internationally between 1995 and 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Office of Applied Studies.

''Emergency department trends from the drug abuse warning network, final estimates 1995–2002'', DAWN Series: D-24, DHHS Publication No. (SMA) 03-3780.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States, the average adult who seeks treatment has consumed cannabis for over 10 years almost daily and has attempted to quit six or more times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Marijuana Dependence and Its Treatment|journal = Addiction Science &amp; Clinical Practice|date=December 2007|issn = 1940-0632|pmc = 2797098|pmid = 18292704|pages = 4–16|volume = 4|issue = 1|first = Alan J.|last = Budney|first2 = Roger|last2 = Roffman|first3 = Robert S.|last3 = Stephens|first4 = Denise|last4 = Walker|doi=10.1151/ascp07414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No medications have been found effective for cannabis dependence as of 2014,&lt;ref name=Cochrane2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marshall|first1=K|last2=Gowing|first2=L|last3=Ali|first3=R|last4=Le Foll|first4=B|title=Pharmacotherapies for cannabis dependence.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=17 December 2014|volume=12|pages=CD008940|pmid=25515775|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD008940.pub2|pmc=4297244}}&lt;/ref&gt; but psychotherapeutic models hold promise.&lt;ref name=Danovitch2012/&gt;

Treatment options for cannabis dependence are far fewer than for opiate or alcohol dependence. Most treatment falls into the categories of psychological or psychotherapeutic, intervention, pharmacological intervention or treatment through peer support and environmental approaches.&lt;ref name=Copeland2004&gt;Copeland, J, Gerber, S, Swift, W. ''Evidence-based answers to cannabis questions a review of the literature''National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre University of New South Wales A report prepared for the Australian National Council on Drugs, December 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  Screening and brief intervention sessions can be given in a variety of settings, particularly at doctor's surgeries, which is of importance as most cannabis users seeking help will do so from their general practitioner rather than a drug treatment service agency.&lt;ref&gt;Degenhardt, L., Hall, W. and Lynskey, M. (2000a) ''Cannabis use and mental health among Australian adults: Findings from the National Survey of Mental Health and Well-being''. NDARC Technical Report No. 98 Sydney, National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre, University of New South Wales.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most commonly accessed forms of treatment in Australia are 12-step programmes, physicians, rehabilitation programmes, and detox services, with inpatient and outpatient services equally accessed.&lt;ref name=Copeland2009&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Copeland J, Swift W |title=Cannabis use disorder: epidemiology and management |journal=Int Rev Psychiatry |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=96–103 |date=April 2009 |pmid=19367503 |doi=10.1080/09540260902782745|type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the EU approximately 20% of all primary admissions and 29% of all new drug clients in 2005, had primary cannabis problems. And in all countries that reported data between 1999–2005 the number of people seeking treatment for cannabis use increased.&lt;ref&gt;EMCDDA (2007).

==== Medication ====
As of 2012, there is no medication that has been proven effective for treating cannabis use disorder; research is focused on three treatment approaches: agonist substitution, antagonist, and modulation of other neurotransmitter systems.&lt;ref name=Danovitch2012/&gt; [[Dronabinol]] is an agonist that is legally available; in some cases and trials, it reduced symptoms of withdrawal and reduced cannabis use.&lt;ref name=Danovitch2012/&gt; [[Entacapone]] was well-tolerated and decreased cannabis cravings in a trial on a small number of patients.&lt;ref name=Danovitch2012/&gt;  [[Acetylcysteine]] (NAC) decreased cannabis use and craving in a trial.&lt;ref name=Danovitch2012/&gt; [[Atomoxetine]] in a small study showed no significant change in cannabis use, and most patients experienced adverse events.&lt;ref name=Danovitch2012/&gt; [[Buspirone]] shows promise as a treatment for dependence; trials show it reducing cravings, irritability and depression.&lt;ref name=Danovitch2012/&gt; [[Divalproex]] in a small study was poorly tolerated and did not show a significant reduction in cannabis use among subjects.&lt;ref name=Danovitch2012/&gt;

== Research ==

[[Columbia University]], in collaboration with the [[National Institute on Drug Abuse]] (NIDA), is undertaking a clinical trial that looks at the effects of combined medication on cannabis dependency, to see if [[lofexidine]] in combination with [[dronabinol]] is superior to placebo in achieving abstinence, reducing cannabis use and reducing withdrawal in cannabis-dependent patients seeking treatment for their marijuana use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01020019 |title=US National Institute of Health |publisher=Clinicaltrials.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men and women between the ages of 18–60 who met DSM-IV criteria for current marijuana dependence were enrolled in a 12-week trial that started in January 2010.

Georgotas &amp; Zeidenberg (1979) conducted an experiment where they gave an average daily dose of 210&amp;nbsp;mg of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the ingredient in cannabis which is responsible for its psychological effects,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.livescience.com/24553-what-is-thc.html|title = Live Science|date = 2015|accessdate = 17 April 2015|website = What is THC (tetrahydrocannabinol)?|publisher = |last = Bradford|first = Alina}}&lt;/ref&gt; to a group of volunteers over a 4-week period. After the test ended, the subjects were found to be "irritable, uncooperative, resistant and at times hostile," and many of the patients experienced insomnia. These effects were likely due to withdrawal from the drug and lasted about 3 weeks after the experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/178/2/116|title = Psychiatric effects of cannabis|last = Johns|first = Andrew|date = 1 February 2001|journal = The British Journal of Psychiatry|doi = 10.1192/bjp.178.2.116|pmid = |access-date = 17 April 2015|volume=178|pages=116–122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 [[Cochrane Collaboration]] review found insufficient data to evaluate the effectiveness of [[gabapentin]] and [[acetylcysteine]] in the treatment of cannabis dependence and that it warrants further investigation.&lt;ref name=Cochrane2014/&gt;

A {{nihongo|'''capsule hotel'''|カプセルホテル|kapuseru hoteru}}, also known as a '''pod hotel''', is a type of [[hotel]] developed in [[Japan]] that features a large number of extremely small "rooms" (capsules) intended to provide cheap, basic overnight accommodation for guests who do not require or who cannot afford the services offered by more conventional hotels.

==Description==
The guest room is a modular plastic or [[fiberglass]] block roughly {{Convert|2|by|1|by|1.25|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. Facilities differ, but most include a television, an electronic console, and [[wireless internet]] connection. The capsules are stacked side-by-side, two units high, with steps providing access to the second level rooms, leading to comparisons to corpse drawers in a [[morgue]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://weburbanist.com/2011/01/31/13-of-japans-most-stylish-strange-hotels/ Japan's most stylish/strange hotels]&lt;/ref&gt; The open end of the capsule can be closed, for privacy, with a curtain or a fiberglass door. Luggage is stored in a locker and washrooms are communal. Guests are asked not to smoke or eat in the capsules.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, Leonard (1997). ''Japan in a Nutshell''. Top Hat Press, 115–166. {{ISBN|0-912509-06-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some hotels also provide restaurants (or at least [[vending machine]]s), pools, and other entertainment facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Schreiber, Mark (January 16, 2001).

Clothes and shoes can sometimes be exchanged for a ''[[yukata]]'' and slippers on entry. A towel may also be provided.

The benefit of these hotels is convenience and low price, usually around ¥2000–4000 (USD {{To USD|2000|JPN|round=yes}}–{{To USD|4000|JPN|round=yes}}) a night. They provide an alternative for those who (especially on weeknights) may be too [[drunk]] to return home safely, or too embarrassed to face their spouses.&lt;ref&gt;Wardell, Steven (October 1994).

'''Cherry Valley O Scale''' is a [[not for profit|not-for-profit]] club dedicated to the promotion of 2-rail [[O scale|O-scale]] ([[1:48 scale|1:48]]) [[Rail transport modelling|model railroading]],&lt;ref name="aap1"&gt;"Choo Choo", ''All Around Pennsauken'', December 2012&lt;/ref&gt; located in [[Merchantville, New Jersey|Merchantville]], [[New Jersey]], United States, in the basement/[[undercroft]] of the Grace Episcopal Church.&lt;ref name="Courpo1"&gt;"Holiday Open House: Cherry Valley Train Club", ''Camden NJ Courier-Post'', December 30, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.merchantville.com/merchantville/groups/374-model-railroad-club-open-house-# |title=Merchantville Online: Model Railroad Club Open House |access-date=2011-08-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927033252/http://www.merchantville.com/merchantville/groups/374-model-railroad-club-open-house-# |archive-date=2011-09-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Obsrv1"&gt;"Model Railroad Open House", ''Merchantville Observer'', November 12, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Cvmrr-oldlayout.jpg|thumb|left|Control panel from the old layout.]]

The club was started in March 1962,&lt;ref name="Courpo2"&gt;Arthur M McGuire, "Model Railroad Runs Like Real", ''Camden NJ Courier-Post'', November 12, 1964&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Inky1"&gt;[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PI&amp;s_site=philly&amp;p_multi=PI&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB5CDACEFF8CB9D&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM Jennifer Farrell, "A Different Track \ Model Train Club Aboard New Line", ''Philadelphia Inquirer'', January 11, 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Courpo3"&gt;[http://www.courierpostonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/gallery?Avis=BZ&amp;Dato=20101205&amp;Kategori=NEWS01&amp;Lopenr=12050801&amp;Ref=PH Scott Anderson, "Model Railroad Open House", ''Camden NJ Courier-Post'', December 6, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; by members of the former [[Philadelphia Model Railroad Club]], which had been located in the [[24th Street Station (Philadelphia)|B&amp;O passenger station]] on Chestnut St. in [[Philadelphia]],&lt;ref name="Obsrv1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="retro1"&gt;[http://theretrospect.com/default.asp?sourceid=&amp;smenu=1&amp;twindow=&amp;mad=&amp;sdetail=1629&amp;wpage=1&amp;skeyword=&amp;sidate=&amp;ccat=&amp;ccatm=&amp;restate=&amp;restatus=&amp;reoption=&amp;retype=&amp;repmin=&amp;repmax=&amp;rebed=&amp;rebath=&amp;subname=&amp;pform=&amp;sc=1155&amp;hn=theretrospect&amp;he=.com Sam Steinruck, "Model Train Layout A Little Bit of Christmas", ''The Retrospective'', December 5, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; after the B&amp;O station was demolished. (Some members of the PMRC also went on to start the [[East Penn Traction Club]] several years later.)&lt;ref name="eptc1"&gt;[http://www.eastpenn.org/origin.html The East Penn Traction Club: The Origin of Modular Trolley Layout]&lt;/ref&gt; When first started, the space was an 80' x 35' unfinished crawl space directly under the original 1890's chapel. Finishing the space took weeks, with the removal of 4' of dirt&lt;ref name="Inky1" /&gt; before 20 cubic yards of concrete was used for the new floor.&lt;ref name="hadgaz"&gt;"Cherry Valley RR: Ready to Roll", ''The Haddon Gazette'', November 8, 1962&lt;/ref&gt;
The first [[Model railroad layout|layout]] in the space was started in July 1962,&lt;ref name="hadgaz4"&gt;"Modern Gullivers", ''The Haddon Gazette'', November 7, 1963&lt;/ref&gt; with the framing and scenery built before the track was laid, and the first spike driven on August 30, 1962.&lt;ref name="hadgaz" /&gt; This layout was 27 by 55 feet in size,&lt;ref name="Courpo4"&gt;"15 Model Railroaders Plan Exhibit at Church Festival", ''Camden NJ Courier-Post'', November 10, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; and was of a [[Model railroad layout#Track layout|double-track folded dogbone design]], built with traditional square tabletop framing, [[Rail transport modelling#Landscaping|plaster scenery]], and [[Control relay|relay control]].&lt;ref name="Obsrv1" /&gt; Eventually it grew to have over 4000 linear feet of track,&lt;ref name="Inky1" /&gt; in both [[Standard gauge|standard]] and [[Narrow gauge railroads in the United States|3-foot]] gauges, with some [[dual gauge]] mixed in.&lt;ref name="Courpo4" /&gt; It existed through to January 1999,&lt;ref name="Inky1" /&gt; when it was torn down due to growing problems with accessibility and electrical characteristics.&lt;ref name="Obsrv1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Inky1" /&gt; Many of the original [[Building model|structures]] and [[Railroad switch|switches]] have been saved, for eventual inclusion on the new layout. Most notable of these is a 1940s train station model which had previously been salvaged from the layout at the PMRC location on Chestnut Street.&lt;ref name="Obsrv1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hadgaz2"&gt;"Model Railroad Invites Inspection", ''The Haddon Gazette'', November 2, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;

2012 was officially recognized as the club's 50th anniversary, by proclamation of the [[Merchantville, New Jersey|Merchantville]] Town Council, at their October public session.&lt;ref name="Obsrv1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20161227095605/http://merchantvillenj.gov/attachments/category/61/10.15.12.pdf Merchantville Town Council Agenda for October 15, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

==New layout==
The new [[Model railroad layout|layout]] was started in 2001,&lt;ref name="retro2"&gt;Bethany Mitros, "World's A Stage: Cherry Valley Trains Are Actors", ''The Retrospective'', January 4, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; is of a [[Model railroad layout#Track layout|double-track looped-8 design]]; but has been built around the walls, with several [[Balloon loop|reversing loops]], curved laminate benchwork, more than 2000 linear feet of track,&lt;ref name="Courpo5"&gt;[http://www.courierpostonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2012301080027 Joe Cooney, "Train Club's Open House Features All the Bells and Whistles", ''Camden NJ Courier-Post'', January 8, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; and a scale model of [[Philadelphia|Philadelphia's]] [[30th Street Station (Philadelphia)|30th Street Station]].&lt;ref name="retro2" /&gt; Scenery has been built with a mix of [[hydrocal]] and [[Extruded polystyrene|extruded styrofoam]] board, and [[NCE Corporation|North Coast Engineering (NCE)]] [[Digital Command Control]] has been installed to allow running of multiple trains without the need for complex [[Control relay|relay systems]].&lt;ref name="retro1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Courpo5" /&gt; The layout also features working signals that display proper occupancy, as well as scale-sized lighting fixtures for night scenes. Additionally, a new On30 narrow gauge branchline is being constructed at one end of the layout, with plans to expand it as time and resources allow.&lt;ref name="retro1" /&gt; [[Rolling stock]] is owned by the individual members,&lt;ref name="retro1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hadgaz2" /&gt; with the club jointly owning the [[Model railroad layout|layout]] and [[Rail transport modelling#Control|control system]]. This rolling stock represents all periods of history,&lt;ref name="retro2" /&gt; and is a mixture of [[Brass model|brass]], bronze, tin, [[white metal]], [[Plastic model|plastic]], [[Resin casting|resin]], wood, [[Paper model|paper]], cardboard, and [[Diecast toy|die-cast]] models; most of which has been extensively [[kitbashing|kitbashed]]/modified, features custom paint and [[Water slide decal|water-slide decals]]; and has been [[Rail transport modelling#Weathering|weathered]] to better replicate real-world conditions.&lt;ref name="retro1" /&gt;

==Catenary==
[[Image:Cvmrr-catenary.jpg|thumb|right|PRR-style compound catenary being installed on new layout.]]

Although the original layout did have a short section of [[Overhead lines#Overhead catenary|catenary]], most of it was destroyed when the layout was torn down.&lt;ref name="Inky1" /&gt; However, the new layout is being constructed with a full [[Pennsylvania Railroad#Electrification|PRR-Style compound catenary system]] over the entire layout. This catenary system is being integrated into the power distribution,&lt;ref name="retro2" /&gt; so that the [[electric locomotive]]s and [[Electric Multiple Unit|MU cars]] will receive power via their [[Pantograph (rail)|operating pantographs]].&lt;ref name="Courpo6"&gt;"Hobbyists On The Right Track", ''Camden NJ Courier-Post'', January 7, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Board of directors==
The club is governed by president, vice president, treasurer, and secretary. All officers serve, on a voluntary basis, as the organization's Board of Directors.

==Meetings==
Meetings are held each Thursday evening. Business meetings are typically held on the second Thursday of the month.

==Open House events==
Every year, the club traditionally has several "Open House" weekends near the end of the year, in conjunction with the [[Merchantville, New Jersey|Merchantville]] annual Christmas parade and Tree Lighting ceremony.&lt;ref name="Obsrv1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bee1"&gt;"Calling All Model Train Enthusiasts", ''Beverly Bee'', December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The first such Open House weekends were held Friday and Saturday, November 9–10 and 16-17, 1962. Admission is free (donations requested).&lt;ref name="aap1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Courpo1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Courpo6"/&gt;

==O-scale Swap Meet events==
The Club hosts two O-scale-only "[[Flea market|Swap Meets]]" a year, usually on a single first Saturday in both March and September.&lt;ref name="hadgaz3"&gt;"Here She Comes", ''The Haddon Gazette'', November 3, 1966&lt;/ref&gt; Admission to the Dealer's Hall is set at $5, and includes a tour of the layout. No meet has been scheduled for 2017.

==Membership==
Club membership is open to everyone over the age of 18. Annual dues is $150.00 and new members have a six-month probation period.

'''Circassians in Iraq''' are people of [[North Caucasus|North Caucasian]] origin in [[Iraq]], including [[Adyghe people|Adyghes]], [[Chechen people|Chechens]] and [[Dagestan]]is.

The name "[[Circassians|Circassian]]" usually denotes speakers of {{nowrap|[[Northwest Caucasian languages]]}} only, however in {{nowrap|[[Western Asia]]}} the name may denote {{nowrap|North Caucasus peoples}} in general,&lt;ref name=ORSAM&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Ahmet Katav |author2=Bilgay Duman |title=Iraqi Circassians (Chechens, Dagestanis, Adyghes) |journal=ORSAM Reports |date=November 2012 |issue=134 |url=http://www.orsam.org.tr/en/enUploads/Article/Files/20121116_134ingtum.pdf |accessdate=15 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403142200/http://www.orsam.org.tr/en/enUploads/Article/Files/20121116_134ingtum.pdf |archivedate=3 April 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Chechen people|Chechens]] and [[Dagestan]]is, who speak {{nowrap|[[Northeast Caucasian languages]]}}.

==History==
Iraqis of North Caucasus origin mainly originate from [[Circassia]], [[Chechnya]] and [[Dagestan]].&lt;ref name=ORSAM/&gt; {{nowrap|North Caucasian}} tribes which settled in Iraq include: [[Abkhaz people|Abkhaz]], [[Adyghe people|Adyghes]], [[Kabarday|Kabardin]], [[Shapsugs]], [[Ingush people|Ingush]], [[Chechen people|Chechens]], [[Avar people (Caucasus)|Avars]], [[Lezgian people|Lezgins]],  and [[Kumyks]].&lt;ref name=ORSAM/&gt;

The migration of North Caucasians to Iraq goes back many centuries,&lt;ref name=ORSAM/&gt; peaking during the {{nowrap|[[Caucasian War]]}} {{nowrap|(1817–1864)}} and in the aftermath of the {{nowrap|[[Russian–Circassian War]]}} with the {{nowrap|[[Ethnic cleansing of Circassians|Circassian Exile]]}} of the 1860s.&lt;ref name=ORSAM/&gt; [[Adyghe people|Adyghes]] came to Iraq in two waves: directly from [[Circassia]], and later from the [[Balkans]].&lt;ref name=ORSAM/&gt; [[Chechen people|Chechens]] and [[Dagestan]]is also settled in Iraq throughout the {{nowrap|[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman era]]}}.&lt;ref name=ORSAM/&gt; Circassians also settled in large numbers in other neighbouring countries including [[Turkey]], [[Syria]], [[Jordan]], and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].&lt;ref name=ORSAM/&gt;

Like all Iraqis, Circassians in Iraq faced various hardships in the modern era, as Iraq suffered wars, sanctions, {{nowrap|oppressive regimes}}, and civil strife.&lt;ref name=ORSAM/&gt;

==Demographics==

[[File:Flag of Ingushetia.svg|thumb|right|135px|Flag of [[Ingushetia]]]]
The overall number of Circassians or people of North Caucasus origin in Iraq is estimated to be between 30,000 and 50,000,&lt;ref name=ORSAM/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adyghe People|url=http://www.joshuaproject.net/peoples.php?peo3=10161|publisher=[[Joshua Project]]|accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Estimated population of Circassians|url=http://www.circassiannation.org/circassiannation_019.htm|publisher=CircassianNation.org|accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; however the total number is unknown.&lt;ref name=ORSAM/&gt; It has been reported that there are 30,000 [[Adyghe people|Adyghe]] families in [[Baghdad]] alone.&lt;ref name=ORSAM/&gt; It is understood that many {{nowrap|North Caucasians}} have ethnically assimilated into the Iraqi population, becoming Arabicized or Kurdicized.&lt;ref name=ORSAM/&gt; [[Chechen people|Chechens]] may comprise up to {{nowrap|three-quarters}} of Iraqis of {{nowrap|North Caucasian}} origin.&lt;ref name=ORSAM/&gt;

Surnames such as ''Al-Daghestani'', ''[[Shishani (surname)|Al-Shishani]]'' ("Chechen"), and ''Al-Sharkas'' ("Circassian") are common among Iraqis of {{nowrap|North Caucasian}} descent.

===Population===
North Caucasians have settled in all parts of Iraq, from [[Dohuk]] in the north to [[Basra]]h in the south.&lt;ref name=ORSAM /&gt; The largest communities are in [[Baghdad]], [[Sulaymaniyah Governorate|Sulaymaniyah]], [[Diyala Governorate|Diyala]], [[Kirkuk Governorate|Kirkuk]], and [[Fallujah]], with smaller communities in [[Najaf]], [[Hillah]], [[Mosul]], [[Kut]], [[Basra]]h, [[Tikrit]], [[Erbil]], [[Nasiriyah]], [[Al Diwaniyah|Diwaniyah]], [[Dohuk]], [[Ramadi]], [[Amarah]], and {{nowrap|[[Tuz Khormato]]}}.&lt;ref name=ORSAM /&gt;

There are also several Circassian villages throughout Iraq, including a Chechen neighbourhood in [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref name=ORSAM /&gt;

===Culture===
North Caucasians in Iraq have integrated into Iraqi society while preserving their traditional {{nowrap|North Caucasian}} culture and customs, such as the Khabze culture. They continue to preserve certain {{nowrap|North Caucasian}} traditions in wedding ceremonies, birth ceremonies, and other special occasions, and to cook their traditional cuisine.&lt;ref name=ORSAM/&gt;

In 2004, the {{nowrap|[[Al-Tadamun Society of Iraqi, Chechen, Dagestani and Circassian Tribes]]}} was formed in [[Kirkuk]]. This cultural organization seeks to bring together Iraqis of {{nowrap|North Caucasian}} heritage.&lt;ref name=ORSAM/&gt; {{nowrap|"Al-Tadamun"}} can be translated as "Solidarity".

North Caucasians in Iraq are predominantly {{nowrap|[[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslims]]}} like their ethnic counterparts in other countries. It is possible that a minority may also identify with {{nowrap|[[Shia Islam]]}}, the majority faith in Iraq.

===Language===
North Caucasians in Iraq speak a number of languages, including their native languages of either [[Adyghe language|Adyghe]], [[Chechen language|Chechen]], or [[Lezgian language|Lezgin]], as well as {{nowrap|[[Mesopotamian Arabic]]}}, [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], or [[Azerbaijani language|Turkmen]].&lt;ref name=ORSAM/&gt; The native languages are mainly spoken by the elder generations, with younger people usually speaking only Arabic or Kurdish, the main Iraqi languages.&lt;ref name=ORSAM/&gt;

==South Caucasians==
Many peoples of [[South Caucasus]] origin have also settled in Iraq, including [[Armenians in Iraq|Armenians]] and [[Iraqi Turkmens|Azerbaijanis]]. Ethnic [[Georgian people|Georgians]] also settled in Iraq historically, and actually {{nowrap|[[Mamluk dynasty of Iraq|ruled the country]]}} through the 18th and early 19th centuries {{nowrap|(from 1704 to 1831)}}. The Georgians who settled in Iraq were Muslim and ultimately assimilated into the Iraqi population, as a {{nowrap|Georgian-speaking}} community no longer exists in the country. {{nowrap|[[Naji Shawkat]]}}, the {{nowrap|[[Prime Minister of Iraq]]}} from 1932 to 1933 was of Georgian descent.

==Notable people==
*[[Mahmud Shevket Pasha|Mahmud Shawkat Pasha]] – Ottoman general and statesman.
*[[Hikmat Sulayman]] – Prime Minister of Iraq (1936–1937).
*[[Tahir Yahya]] – Prime Minister of Iraq (1963–1965 and 1967–1968).

'''Communication noise''' refers to influences on effective [[communication]] that influence the interpretation of [[conversation]]s. While often looked over, communication noise can have a profound impact both on our perception of [[social interaction|interactions]] with others and our analysis of our own communication proficiency.

Forms of communication noise include [[psychology|psychological]] noise, physical noise, [[physiology|physiological]] and [[semantic]] noise. All these forms of noise subtly, yet greatly influence our communication with others and are vitally important to anyone’s skills as a competent communicator.

==Psychological noise==
Psychological noise results from preconceived notions we bring to conversations, such as racial [[stereotype]]s, reputations, [[bias]]es, and assumptions. When we come into a conversation with ideas about what the other person is going to say and why, we can easily become blinded to their original message. Most of the time psychological noise is impossible to free ourselves from, and we must simply strive to recognize that it exists and take those distractions into account when we converse with others.

==Environmental Noise==
Environmental noise is the summary of [[noise pollution]] from outside, caused by transport, industrial and recreational activities.

==Physical noise==
Physical noise is any external or environmental [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] that distracts us from receiving the intended message sent by a communicator (Rothwell 11). Examples of physical noise include: others talking in the background, background music, a startling noise and acknowledging someone outside of the conversation.

==Semantic noise==
This is noise caused by the sender. i.e., the encoder. This type of noise occurs when grammar or technical language is used that the receiver (the decoder) cannot understand, or cannot understand it clearly.
It occurs when the sender of the message uses a word or a phrase that we don't know the meaning of, or which we use in a different way from the speakers. This is usually due to the result that the encoder had failed to practice audience analysis at first. The type of audience is the one that determine the jargon one will use.

'''Copts in Sudan''' may refer to people born in or residing in [[Sudan]] of full or partial [[Coptic people|Coptic]] origin.

Sudan has a native Coptic minority, although many Copts in Sudan are descended from more recent Coptic immigrants from Egypt.&lt;ref name="unhcr1"/&gt;
Copts in Sudan live mostly in northern cities, including [[Al Obeid]], [[Atbara]], [[Dongola]], [[Khartoum]], [[Omdurman]], [[Port Sudan]], and [[Wad Medani]].&lt;ref name="unhcr1"/&gt; They number up to 500,000, or slightly over 1% of the Sudanese population.&lt;ref name="unhcr1"/&gt; Due to their advanced education, their role in the life of the country has been more significant than their numbers suggest.&lt;ref name="unhcr1"/&gt; They have occasionally faced forced conversion to [[Islam]], resulting in their emigration and decrease in number.&lt;ref name="unhcr1"/&gt;

Modern immigration of Copts to Sudan peaked in the early 19th century, and they generally received a tolerant welcome there. However, this was interrupted by a decade of persecution under [[History of Mahdist Sudan|Mahdist rule]] at the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="unhcr1"/&gt; As a result of this persecution, many were forced to relinquish their faith, adopt [[Islam]], and intermarry with the native Sudanese. The [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|Anglo-Egyptian invasion]] in 1898 allowed Copts greater religious and economic freedom, and they extended their original roles as artisans and merchants into trading, banking, engineering, medicine, and the civil service. Proficiency in business and administration made them a privileged minority. However, the return of [[Islamism|militant Islam]] in the mid-1960s and subsequent demands by radicals for an [[Sharia|Islamic constitution]] prompted Copts to join in public opposition to religious rule.&lt;ref name="unhcr1"/&gt;

[[Gaafar Nimeiry]]'s introduction of Islamic [[Sharia]] law in 1983 began a new phase of oppressive treatment of Copts, among other non-Muslims.&lt;ref name="unhcr1"/&gt; After the overthrow of Nimeiry, Coptic leaders supported a secular candidate in the 1986 elections. However, when the [[National Islamic Front]] overthrew the elected government of [[Sadiq al-Mahdi]] with the help of the military, discrimination against Copts returned in earnest. Hundreds of Copts were dismissed from the civil service and judiciary.&lt;ref name="unhcr1"/&gt;

In February 1991, a Coptic pilot working for [[Sudan Airways]] was executed for illegal possession of foreign currency.&lt;ref name="sudanupdate1"&gt;[http://www.sudanupdate.org/REPORTS/PEOPLES/COPTS.HTM The Copts]&lt;/ref&gt; Before his execution, he had been offered amnesty and money if he converted to [[Islam]], but he refused. Thousands attended his funeral, and the execution was taken as a warning by many Copts, who began to flee the country.&lt;ref name="sudanupdate1"/&gt;

Restrictions on the Copts' rights to Sudanese nationality followed, and it became difficult for them to obtain Sudanese nationality by birth or by naturalization, resulting in problems when attempting to travel abroad. The confiscation of Christian schools and the imposition of an Arab-Islamic emphasis in language and history teaching were accompanied by harassment of Christian children and the introduction of [[hijab]] dress laws. A Coptic child was flogged for failing to recite a [[Koranic]] verse.&lt;ref name="sudanupdate1"/&gt; In contrast with the extensive media broadcasting of the Muslim [[Friday prayers]], the radio ceased coverage of the Christian Sunday service. As the civil war raged throughout the 1990s, the government focused its religious fervour on the south. Although experiencing discrimination, the Copts and other long-established Christian groups in the north had fewer restrictions than other types of Christians in the [[South Sudan|south]].

Today, the [[Coptic Church]] in Sudan is officially registered with the government, and is exempt from property tax.&lt;ref name="unhcr1"/&gt; In 2005, the Sudanese government of National Unity (GNU) named a [[Coptic Orthodox]] priest to a government position, though the ruling Islamist party's continued dominance under the GNU provides ample reason to doubt its commitment to broader religious or ethnic representation.&lt;ref name="unhcr1"/&gt;

'''Damir Siraciev''' ({{lang-tt|Дамир Сираҗиев}}, {{lang-ru|Дамир Сиразиев}} ''Damir Siraziev'', October 17, 1954 was a [[Volga Tatars|Volga Tatar]] [[theatre director]] and [[actor]]. He was born '''Siraziev Raid Ravilovich''' ({{lang-ru|Сиразиев Раид Равилович}}) in [[Kaybitsky District]] and later moved to [[Kazan]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{tt icon}} [http://www.tatar.ru/?DNSID=9f6e996f1c36ad4ba91c0fb767e0076a&amp;page=31&amp;full=27439]  as retrieved on 21 Oct 2007 from Official site of the Republic of Tatarstan.&lt;/ref&gt; He died on 17 December 1998. His grave was visited during Second [[World Congress of Tatars]] (WCT) in August 2002. He is  interred at the [[Tatar Cemetery]] in [[Kazan]].

Siraciev was the director in both [[Tinçurin Theater]] and [[Kamal Theater]]&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; in [[Kazan]], [[Tatarstan]], [[Russia]], who tried to bring a fresh look on theater as an art .&lt;ref&gt;[http://tatarica.narod.ru/archive/2004/08/114_04.09.19-4.htm Article about Damir Siraciev] by Natalya Titova, ''Vostochny Ekspress'' no. 42/37, September 17, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; He was first who established cultural relations with Tatars living in Turkey. In 1991 on his initiative (together with his close friend composer [[Masguda Shamsutdinova]]) the [[TÜMATA]] folk and mystic music band were invited to Kazan. Their three concerts in Tinçurin Theater were a great success. Another important contribution of Damir Siraciev was his role in organizing the visit of the world-known ballet dancer [[Rudolf Nureyev]] to [[Kazan]] and his appearance, already heavily affected by [[AIDS]], in front of the audience at [[Musa Cälil Tatar Academic Opera and Ballet Theater]] in [[Kazan]] in March 1992 as a conductor .&lt;ref&gt;Yaroslav Sedov.

'''''Demi-monde''''' refers to a group of people who live [[hedonism|hedonistic]] lifestyles, usually in a flagrant and [[conspicuous consumption|conspicuous]] manner. The term was commonly used in Europe from the late nineteenth to the early twentieth century, and contemporary use has an anachronistic character. Its connotations of pleasure-seeking often contrasted with wealth and ruling class behavior.

The term 'demi-monde' is French for "half-world". It derives from a comedy called ''Le Demi-Monde'', by [[Alexandre Dumas, fils]], published in 1855.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theatrehistory.com/french/dumasfils002.html |title=Le Demi-monde, a synopsis of the play by Alexander Dumas (fils)|author=Alice B. Fort &amp; Herbert S. Kates}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was often used as one of disapprobation, the behavior of a person in the demimonde being contrary to more traditional or [[bourgeois]] values. Such behaviors often included drinking or drug use, gambling, high spending (particularly in pursuit of [[fashion]], as through clothing as well as servants and houses), and sexual promiscuity. The term ''demimondaine'' referred to a woman who embodied these qualities; later it became a euphemism for a [[courtesan]] or [[prostitute]].

== Decline ==
As the twentieth century dawned, changing social mores resulted in the demarginalization of the demimonde. [[Women's suffrage]] and the [[flapper]] movements resulted in the label ''demimondaine'' becoming obsolete. The term commonly used to refer to the class that became [[bohemianism|'starving artists']].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

== Women called demimondaine ==
Externally, the defining aspects of the demimonde were an extravagant [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] of fine food and clothes, often surpassing that of other wealthy women of their day with a steady income of cash and gifts from their various lovers. Internally, their lifestyle was an eclectic mixture of sharp business acumen, social skills, and [[hedonism]]. Intelligent demimondaines, like the fictional [[Gigi]]'s grandmother, would invest their wealth for the day when their beauty faded. Others ended up penniless and starving when age took its toll on their beauty, unless they managed to marry.

A famous beauty was [[Virginia Oldoini|Virginia Oldoini, Countess di Castiglione]], who came to Paris in the 1850s with very little money of her own and soon became mistress of [[Napoleon III]]; after that relationship ended she moved on to other wealthy men in government, finance and European royalty. She was one of the most aristocratic and exclusive of the demimondaines—reputed to have charged a member of the British aristocracy one million francs for 12 hours in her company. 

Another woman who doubtless influenced later images of the demimondaine was the dancer and adventuress [[Lola Montez]], though she died before the term came into general use.

The actress [[Sarah Bernhardt]] was the illegitimate child of a courtesan; in her day all actresses were generally considered demimondaines.  Her many lovers and extravagant lifestyle fit the type, though her genuine successes as an artist and innovator eventually gained her a kind of public esteem most demimondaines never achieved.

== Fictional demimondaine ==
Descriptions of the demimonde can be found in ''[[Vanity Fair (novel)|Vanity Fair]]'' (1848), a novel which satirizes nineteenth century society, written by [[William Makepeace Thackeray]].  Although it does not mention the terms 'demimonde' and 'demimondaine' (they were coined later), the terms were later used by reviewers and other authors in reference to three characters in it.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Lady Crackenbury and Mrs. Washington White are demimonde characters, both of whom Captain Rawdon Crawley lusts after in his younger days.  [[Becky Sharp (character)|Becky Sharp]] is perceived as a demimondaine before she is presented at court, and then becomes one when she travels through [[Europe]] after her husband abandons her.

Possibly the most famous portrayal of the demimonde, albeit from before the word was coined, is in Verdi's opera ''[[La traviata]]'' (1853). The opera, in turn, was inspired by [[Alexandre Dumas, fils|Alexandre Dumas the younger]]'s ''[[The Lady of the Camellias|La Dame aux Camélias]];'' [[The Lady of the Camellias|Marguerite Gautier]], the heroine of the book and subsequent play, was based on [[Marie Duplessis]], 1840s Paris courtesan and mistress to a number of prominent men, including Dumas.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news|last=Webber|first=Carolline|title=‘My Favors Cost a Great Deal’: ‘The Girl Who Loved Camellias,’ by Julie Kavanagh|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/21/books/review/the-girl-who-loved-camellias-by-julie-kavanagh.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=July 20, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In writing his 1924 play ''[[Easy Virtue (play)|Easy Virtue]]'', [[Noël Coward]] stated his object was to present a comedy in the structure of a tragedy "to compare the déclassée woman of to-day with the more flamboyant demi-mondaine of the 1890s."

[[Colette]]'s ''[[Gigi]]'' (1944) also describes the demimonde and their lifestyle.  Gigi is schooled from childhood to be a kept woman, to stifle her feelings in return for a life of ease.  "We never marry in our family", says Gigi's mother.  But Gigi finds herself a misfit in the demimonde of [[Paris]] in the '[[Gay Nineties]]', as she desires true romance with Gaston.

In ''[[The Seven-Per-Cent Solution (film)|The Seven-Per-Cent Solution]]'' (1976) the character Lola Devereaux is labeled a demimondaine by the character [[Sigmund Freud]].

== Other uses of the term in fiction ==
In [[Henryk Sienkiewicz]]'s ''[[Without Dogma]]'' (1891), the "demimonde" refers to the affluent, pleasure-seeking portion of society, unbound by morals, religion or tradition, and is loosely analogous to the "[[Jet set|Jet Set]]" of modern times.

In Marcel Proust's ''Swann's Way'' (1913), Odette de Crécy is described as a demimondaine. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Swann's Way|last = Proust|first = Marcel|translator=C.K. Scott Moncrieff and Terence Kilmartin|publisher = Random House|year = 1981|isbn = 0394506448|location = New York}}{{rp|205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Francoise Sagan]], in her novel ''[[Bonjour Tristesse]]'' (1954), uses the term 'demimondaine' to refer to the character Elsa, a young, stunningly attractive woman who leverages her appearance into support by wealthy men, which allows her entrance into the social-world of the upper classes.

The high society men in [[Peter Matthew Hillsman Taylor]]'s novella ''The Old Forest'' (from the story collection of the same name, 1985) use "demimonde" to refer to a group of "adventurous" and intelligent young women in 1937 Memphis, Tennessee; in the story, it is common for the men to continue courting such "demimondames" right up until the time they are married to high society women.

The term appears repeatedly in [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''.

In [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''[[Mars trilogy]]'' (1990s), the "demimonde" refers to a semi-tolerated, "off the net" society of commerce and education.

*The English language title of the Hungarian feature film ''Félvilág'' is ''[[Demimonde_(film)|Demimonde]]''.

{{Violence against women}}

'''[[Domestic violence]] in Tajikistan''' is very high, due to traditional [[Tajik people|Tajik]] [[Islam|muslim]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://drc.ngo/media/2470176/breaking-barriers_challenges-to-implementing-laws-on-violence-in-afghanistan-and-tajikistan-with-special-consideration-of-diasplaced-women.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theadvocatesforhumanrights.org/uploads/tajikistan_3_6_07_layout_-_final_mc.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-04-24/confronting-domestic-violence-in-islam/8458116}}&lt;/ref&gt; family values, as well as a reluctance by the authorities to intervene in what is viewed in [[Tajikistan]] as a "private family matter".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8375617.stm |title=Amnesty: Nearly half of Tajik women 'regularly abused' |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=2009-11-24 |accessdate=2016-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extent==
Nearly half Tajik women have been subjected to physical, psychological, or sexual violence by their husbands or in-laws. One woman told [[Amnesty International]] that during her five years of marriage, she was not allowed to leave her husband's home, while another reported that she had been raped by her boyfriend, who threatened to kill her if she told anybody, and continued to coerce her into sex for four months.&lt;ref name="AI"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/EUR60/001/2009/en |title=Document &amp;#124; Amnesty International |website=Amnesty.org |date=2009-11-24 |accessdate=2016-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law prohibits rape, which is punishable by up to 20 years’ imprisonment. There is no separate statute for spousal rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/humanrightsreport/index.htm#section6women |title=Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2014 |website=State.gov |date= |accessdate=2016-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many women are subjected to harsh treatment by husbands or in-laws upon marriage. Most Tajik women leave school early to be wed, leaving them without an adequate education, and are often pushed into the lowest paying jobs, leaving them economically dependent on their husbands. 

In 2013, Tajikistan enacted the ''Law on the Prevention of Domestic Violence'', its first law against domestic violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ilo.org/dyn/natlex/docs/ELECTRONIC/94868/111490/F1123656258/TJK94868.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 27, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208055850/https://www.ilo.org/dyn/natlex/docs/ELECTRONIC/94868/111490/F1123656258/TJK94868.pdf |archivedate=December 8, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tajik social attitudes==
Domestic violence is often seen as justified by society: a UNICEF survey found that  62.4% of women in Tajikistan justify wife beating if the wife goes out without telling the husband; 68% if she argues with him; 47.9% if she refuses to have sex with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.childinfo.org/files/MICS3_Tajikistan_FinalReport_2005_Eng.pdf |format=PDF |title=Tajikistan : Monitoring the situation of children and women |website=Childinfo.org |accessdate=2016-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another survey also found that women and men largely
agreed that it was justifiable for a husband or mother-in-law to beat a wife/daughter-in-law who had "talked back", disobeyed, left the house without permission, had not prepared dinner on time, or had not cared for the children properly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stopvaw.org/uploads/tajikistan_3_6_07_layout_-_final_mc.pdf |format=PDF |title=DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN TAJIKISTAN |website=Stopvaw.org |accessdate=2016-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Police are often unwilling to intervene in domestic violence incidents. The de facto policy of the authorities is to promote reconciliation. The police often blame the women for their abuse, and sometimes insult women trying to report abuse. Women trying to report cases of abuse to the police are often told to file a complaint, or are sent away. Judiciary, police, and medical staff are not trained to deal with cases of domestic violence. Abusive husbands are rarely arrested or prosecuted.&lt;ref name="AI" /&gt;

'''Dymkovo toys''', also known as the '''Vyatka toys''' or '''Kirov toys''' (''Дымковская игрушка'', ''вятская игрушка'', ''кировская игрушка'' in [[Russian language|Russian]]) are moulded painted [[clay]] figures of people and animals (sometimes in the form of a [[Tin whistle|pennywhistle]]). It is one of the old [[Russia]]n [[folk art]] [[handicraft]]s, which still exists in a village of [[:ru:Дымково (Киров)|Dymkovo]] near [[Kirov, Kirov Oblast|Kirov]] (former Vyatka). Traditionally, the Dymkovo toys are made by women.

The tradition of making pennywhistles in the form of a horse, a horse rider, and a bird goes back to the ancient magic ritual images{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} and has to do with the [[agricultural]] [[calendar]] holidays. Later, the little figures lost their magic meaning and turned into toys for children, the making of which would become an artistic handicraft. Up until the 20th century, this toy production had been timed to the spring fair called ''свистунья'', or whistler. The first recorded mentioning of this event took place in 1811, but it is believed to have existed for some 400 years, thus dating the history of the Dymkovo toy at least from the 17th century.

In the late 19th century the handicraft fell into decline because the Dymkovo toys had been forced out of the market by the [[factory]]-made moulded [[plaster]] statuettes, which imitated [[porcelain]] articles. During [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] times, however, the Dymkovo handicraft was revived. In 1933, they{{who|date=October 2018}} organized an [[artel]] called ''Вятская игрушка'' (The Vyatka Toy), which would turn into a [[workshop]] of the Artistic Fund of the RSFSR ({{lang-ru|Художественный фонд РСФСР}}). These days, the Dymkovo toys are known as a popular Russian [[souvenir]].

[[File:Дымковская игрушка в магазине г. Киров (Кировская область).JPG|thumb|left|280px|Dymkovo toys]]

The Dymkovo toys are moulded from a mixture of local [[Pottery|potter]]'s clay and river [[sand]]. The parts are then fastened together with watery clay. After the toys are dried and [[tempering (metallurgy)|tempered]] in a [[furnace]], they are whitewashed with [[chalk]] diluted in milk, then painted with [[tempera]] (before 1953, the artists used [[aniline]] paints ground with eggs) in 4 to 10 (or more) colors, and decorated with [[gold leaf]].

Modern Dymkovo toys include ancient motifs, as well as those of the second half of the 19th century, such as ''барыни'' (barynyas, or landladies), ''няньки'' (nyanki, or nannies), ''водоноски'' (vodonoski, or female watercarriers) and others. In the 1930s, the Dymkovo toys began to depict [[fairy tale]]s and a contemporary lifestyle. There were also multi-character compositions on stands, and figures of people taller than 30&amp;nbsp;cm.

Massive, abstract, and somewhat grotesque forms of the Dymkovo toys are emphasized by ruffles, puffed collars, and other features. The improvised bright painting of the toys represents a geometric ornament of circles, checks, and dots of different colors and sizes.

'''German Nicaraguan''' is a Nicaraguan having German ancestries or a German naturalized Nicaraguan. This includes Poles due to [[Partitions of Poland]]. During the [[Second World War]], after Nicaragua's allies declared war on Germany, German immigrants not naturalized were persecuted and imprisoned. Some were deported to Germany or to concentration camps in other countries. Although Germans have emigrated to Nicaragua since the 19th century, most of the German Nicaraguans still speak both Spanish and German.

== History ==

=== Early of the emigration ===
The first German who settled in Nicaragua was the merchant of Leon in 1810, known simply as "Don Alemán" (Don German), known by  Orlando W. Roberts, (although the real name of German was not mentioned).&lt;ref name="Nicale"&gt;{{sp icon}} [http://www.manfut.org/matagalpa/alemanes.html Alemanes en Nicaragua "Germans in Nicaragua", posted by por Güetz Von Houwald, retrieved 31 August 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1852, a group of German immigrants, primarily single men, began to settle in northern [[Nicaragua]] with the purpose of cultivating 200 blocks of land per person, which were granted by the Government. They were required to cultivate the land and have an initial capital equivalent to about $2,500 per person. Over time, these settlers built farms, established towns and increased the wealth of Nicaragua. North Nicaragua became the epicenter of this economic prosperity.&lt;ref name="Dololvi"/&gt; The next settlement upstream, Castillo Viejo (Old Castle), likely had a number of German settlers by the year 1852.&lt;ref name="Nicale"/&gt;
The Germans continued to arrive on ships at Granada and rode down to areas where they would soon establish settlements. Other immigrants came to Leon and began their journey to 
[[Matagalpa]].&lt;ref name="Dololvi"/&gt; Many of the Germans, who then moved to [[Costa Rica]] in 1853 had come to Nicaragua with the emigrant ship "Antoinette".&lt;ref name="Nicale"/&gt;

=== During World War II ===
At the beginning of World War II in 1939, Nicaragua's allies - [[France]] and [[the United Kingdom]] - declared war on Germany. The Government of Nicaragua prompted a wave of persecution against the Germans in Nicaragua. During this period,  fifty young men of German descent were attacked in La vaterland. They were those who had been encouraged to farm coffee plantations by the 'Thirty Years' Conservative governments (1857-1892) and then by the Liberal government of [[José Santos Zelaya]] (1893-1909). To promote the cultivation of coffee he donated 200 acres of land in the wilderness areas of [[Matagalpa]] and [[Jinotega]]. These Germans were the ones who started the promotion, production, processing, transportation and marketing of coffee in northern Nicaragua.

The president of Nicaragua, [[Anastasio Somoza Garcia]] declared war against Germany in 1941, and the Germans in Nicaragua were victims of this European war. Somoza began "hunting" Germans to imprison them. The older people were arrested and the younger were taken to the Quinta Eitzen, a property which Somoza had seized from the German Ulrich Eitzen. 
Once imprisoned they were not given food. 

Only Germans who were naturalized Nicaraguans were not imprisoned or were released from the jail. However, some Germans were deported to Germany.  Some German groups from Nicaragua were in refugee camps in other countries but once the war and the German persecution started, some returned to Nicaragua.&lt;ref name="Dololvi"&gt;{{sp icon}} [http://archivo.laprensa.com.ni/archivo/2000/julio/26/nacionales/nacionales-20000726-14.html La Prensa, el Diario de Los nicaraguences. Enfoque Alemanes en Nicaragua: Entre el dolor y el olvido, posted 26 July 2000, retrieved 31 August 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; Some groups of German (and other ethnic groups) were deported to concentration camps in the United States from Nicaragua. Those who refused to be deported were confined on [[Ellis Island]], a small island in New York, used as a quarantine site for immigrants.&lt;ref name="Today"&gt;{{sp icon}} [http://www.nicaragua-actual.info/alemannes2.html Nicaragua actual, retrieved August 31, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Demography ==
The descendants of those Germans today live in the mountains, in [[fincas]], as did their ancestors. Most of them can still speak both Spanish and German. Many German Nicaraguans speak additional languages including English and French. They maintain the use of elements of German culture such as the use of fireplaces in their homes, which are unusual in [[Hispanic America]].&lt;ref name="Dololvi"/&gt; The German Nicaraguans have their own school in [[Managua]], [[Nicaragua]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.coalnic.edu.ni/index.php/en/ Home]. German Nicaraguan School. Retrieved on March 23, 2015. "Carretera Sur, Km 10 ½. P.O.Box 16-36. Managua, Nicaragua"&lt;/ref&gt;

=== German Festivals in Nicaragua===
The German Culture Festival in Nicaragua is celebrated between 4 and 15 June. As part of this festival, there are events celebrating gastronomy, cinema, philosophy and musical heritage. All the events are free to attend, except for the Grand Concert "Germany in the heart of Nicaragua", held at the córdobas Ruben Dario National Theater.&lt;ref name="Newdialy"&gt;[http://www.elnuevodiario.com.ni/actualidad/344335-primer-festival-cultura-alemana-nicaragua/ El Nuevo Diario: Primer Festival de la Cultura Alemana en Nicaragua] (in Spanish: The New daily: First festival of the German culture in Nicaragua).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Greek Orthodox Congregations in Norway ==
{{Main|Eastern Orthodoxy in Norway}}

A number of the 7,600 Eastern Orthodox in Norway are Greeks. The primarily Greek congregation of the Annunciation of the Theotokos was founded in 1965 in Oslo with the main purpose of serving the Greek Orthodox community in [[Norway]]. The church is administrated under Metropolitan Pavlos Menevissoglou, based in [[Stockholm]]. The congregation celebrates the Divine Liturgy approximately once a month through the services of  [[Archimandrite]] Evmenios Likakis or other Greek clergy who travel to Oslo for the occasion. In addition, St. Michael's Orthodox Church is a small Greek community in [[Bergen]] with 98 members, .&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fylkesmannen.no/hoved.aspx?m=1166&amp;amid=2913053 Fylkesmannen i Hordaland - Bergen Moské størst av trussamfunna i 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229163547/http://www.fylkesmannen.no/hoved.aspx?m=1166&amp;amid=2913053 |date=2012-02-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hells Canyon massacre''' (also known as the '''Snake River massacre''') was a [[massacre]] where thirty-four Chinese goldminers were ambushed and murdered in May 1887. In 2005, the area was renamed [[Chinese Massacre Cove]], and a memorial was placed there in 2012 in three languages, [[Standard Chinese|Chinese]], [[English language|English]], and [[Nez Perce language|Nez Perce]].

==Massacre==
Two groups of Chinese miners, led by Chea Po and Lee She, departed [[Lewiston, Idaho|Lewiston]] in October 1886 and headed upriver along the [[Snake River|Snake]] into Oregon's [[Hells Canyon]] to search for gold. Chea's group stopped on the Oregon side of the Snake, near Robinson Gulch and the cove where Deep Creek empties into the Snake. Lee's group continued upriver to Salt Creek. Chea Po had chosen a location just upstream of Dug Bar, a [[ford (crossing)|ford]] used by horse and cattle thieves to cross the Snake.&lt;ref name=Stratton /&gt;{{rp|115}} Dug Bar was named for Thomas J. Douglas, a thief who had used the area to graze his horses. Douglas was killed in 1883, and a gang led by Bruce Evans, known locally as "Old Blue", began using Douglas's abandoned cabin in the spring of 1887, approximately {{convert|1/2|mi}} downstream from Chea Po's camp. The gang consisted of Evans, J.T. ("Tigh") Canfield, C.O. (Homer) LaRue, Frank Vaughn, Carl (or Hezekiah) Hughes, Hiram Maynard and Robert McMillan, a fifteen-year-old boy.&lt;ref name=Stratton /&gt;{{rp|115–116}}

In late May 1887 (May 25, according to Stratton)&lt;ref name=Stratton /&gt;{{rp|116}} the gang of seven white [[horse gang]] members robbed, murdered, and mutilated between 10 and 34 Chinese employees of the [[Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association#San Francisco|Sam Yup Company]], reportedly for their gold.&lt;ref name=kgw&gt;{{cite news |title=Next stop Qochyax Island  |date=12 October 2005 |accessdate=12 March 2007 |website=KGW-TV |location=Portland, Oregon |agency=Associated Press |url=http://www.kgw.com/sharedcontent/APStories/stories/D8D6CD980.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070109192706/http://www.kgw.com/sharedcontent/APStories/stories/D8D6CD980.html |archivedate=9 January 2007 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Scout88&gt;{{cite news |url=https://oregonhistoryproject.org/articles/historical-records/news-article-the-chinese-murderers/ |title=The Chinese Murderers |author= |date=20 April 1888 |newspaper=Oregon Scout |accessdate=25 April 2018 |volume=IV |number=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates of the value of gold stolen range from $4,000&lt;ref name=Scout88 /&gt; to $50,000.&lt;ref name=NYT-AP95 /&gt; According to a contemporaneous news article, the gold dust was given to Canfield for safekeeping, but he double-crossed the rest of the gang and fled the county.&lt;ref name=Scout88 /&gt;

After the first day's onslaught at Robinson Gulch, the killers wrecked and burned the camp and then threw the mutilated corpses into the Snake River.

Robert McMillan made a [[deathbed confession]] to his father Hugh recounting details of the massacre, which were published in 1891. According to Hugh McMillan, the Chinese miners were ambushed by a party consisting of Robert McMillan, Bruce Evans, J.T. Canfield, Max Larue, and Frank Vaughn in late April 1887. Hiram Maynard and Carl Hughes were traveling with the others, but did not participate in the ambush. Canfield and Larue first attacked the camp of thirteen Chinese from the bluffs overlooking the cove, driving them towards Evans and Vaughn, who were in the path of their retreat. Twelve Chinese were killed in the initial fusillade, then the remaining man had "his brains beaten out", retrieving $5,500 in gold dust. The next day, eight more Chinese returned to the camp by boat, where the gang shot and killed them, throwing the 21 bodies into the Snake River. The gang then stole the boat and traveled {{convert|4|mi}} to the next Chinese camp, where they killed 13 more and retrieved $50,000 in gold. Hugh McMillan stated that Robert was only present for the first day's events, but the gang had discussed the next day's plans before Robert left the others.&lt;ref name=McMillan&gt;{{cite news |url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=SDU18910930.2.7 |title=Murdered for Gold |author=McMillan, Hugh |date=30 September 1891 |newspaper=Sacramento Daily Union |accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a modern account, Vaughn stayed behind to prepare dinner while the other six rode to ambush the miners. McMillan minded the horses; Canfield and LaRue shot from the rim of Robinson Gulch, while Evans shot from the river level; Hughes and Maynard were positioned upstream and downstream to catch any miner who tried to flee along the river. Their surprise attack was successful, and all ten of the miners at the camp were killed, the last with a rock after the gang had run out of ammunition.&lt;ref name=Stratton /&gt;{{rp|116–117}} The gang returned to the Douglas cabin and restocked their ammunition; the next day, the Evans, Canfield, and LaRue ambushed a group of eight Chinese miners who returned to the cove, then sailed to a second camp and killed thirteen more miners.&lt;ref name=Stratton /&gt;{{rp|117}}

===Aftermath===
The bodies of some murder victims began washing ashore soon afterward, swept downstream to places as far away as Lime Point (south of the mouth of the [[Grande Ronde River]]), Log Cabin Island (now the site of the [[Lower Granite Dam]]), and Penawawa, Washington. Each body bore unmistakable markings of great violence; J.K. Vincent, a federal official who investigated the crime, later wrote "every one was shot, cut up and stripped and thrown in the River."&lt;ref name=Stratton /&gt;{{rp|117–118}} Lee She's group went to visit Chea Po's group at Robinson Gulch in early June 1887, and found three bodies in the deserted, ransacked camp; they fled in terror to Lewiston, where they reported the crimes.&lt;ref name=Stratton /&gt;{{rp|119}}

A news article published in July 1887 called the corpses a "severe warning to Chinese miners" and blamed the victims: "More than likely it was the whites who look with an evil eye upon Chinese intrusion in American mines. The American miner kicks hard at the Chinese miner."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://oregonnews.uoregon.edu/lccn/sn97071028/1887-07-01/ed-1/seq-2/ |title=Headlines |author= |date=1 July 1887 |newspaper=The Lebanon Express |accessdate=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other local Chinese Americans believed that all Chinese miners along the Snake had been killed once the mutilated bodies began to surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://oregonnews.uoregon.edu/lccn/sn96061150/1887-07-13/ed-1/seq-2/ |title=Believed to Be True. |author= |date=13 July 1887 |newspaper=The Daily Astorian |accessdate=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, "a thorough investigation" described in a July 17, 1887 article concluded the Chinese had been murdered by rival Chinese miners, since the victims had been "shot in the back and mutilated by cleavers, a weapon in general use by the Chinese."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=SBDC18870717.1.1 |title=Chinese Not Killed by Whites |author= |date=17 July 1887 |newspaper=San Bernardino Daily Courier |accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; George S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17542">The '''history of medical diagnosis''' began in earnest from the days of [[Imhotep]] in [[ancient Egypt]] and [[Hippocrates]] in [[ancient Greece]] but is far from perfect despite the enormous bounty of information made available by medical research including the [[sequencing]] of the [[human genome]]. The practice of diagnosis continues to be dominated by theories set down in the early 20th century.

== Ancient Egypt ==
An [[Ancient Egyptian medicine|Egyptian medical textbook]], the [[Edwin Smith Papyrus]] written by [[Imhotep]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 2630-2611 BC), was the first to apply the method of diagnosis to the treatment of disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Encyclopædia Britannica||p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ancient Babylonia ==
A [[Babylonia]]n medical textbook, the ''Diagnostic Handbook'' written by [[Esagil-kin-apli]] (fl. 1069-1046 BC), introduced the use of [[empiricism]], [[logic]] and [[rationality]] in the diagnosis of an illness or disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Horstmanshoff|Stol|Tilburg|2004|pp=97–98}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book made use of logical rules in combining observed symptoms on the body of a patient with its diagnosis and [[prognosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Horstmanshoff|Stol|Tilburg|2004|pp=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; He described the symptoms for many varieties of [[epilepsy]] and related [[ailment]]s along with their diagnosis and prognosis&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stol|1993|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; which both played significant roles in the practice of [[Babylonia#Medicine|Babylonian medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ginzburg|1984|pp=90–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ancient China ==
Predated by Babylonian and Egyptian medicine, [[traditional Chinese medicine]] (TCM) was described in an ancient Chinese text, the Yellow Emperor's
Inner Canon or [[Huangdi Neijing]] which dates to the first&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sivin|1993|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or second&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Needham|Lu|1980|pp=89–90}}&lt;/ref&gt; century BCE.

== Ancient Greece ==
Over two thousand years ago, [[Hippocrates]] recorded the association between disease and heredity. In similar fashion, [[Pythagoras]] noted the association between [[metabolism]] and [[heredity]] (allergy to Fava beans). The medical community, however, has only recently acknowledged the importance of [[genetics]] and its relevance to mainstream [[medicine]].

== Islamic world ==
The [[Medicine in Islam|Arabic physician]], [[Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi]] (Abulcasis), wrote on [[hematology]] in his ''[[Al-Tasrif]]'' (1000). He provided the first description on [[haemophilia]], a [[Heredity|hereditary]] [[genetic disorder]], in which he wrote of an [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian]] family whose males died of bleeding after minor injuries.&lt;ref name=Patricia&gt;{{harvnb|Skinner|2001|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ancient Iranian Medicine|Persian physician]], [[Avicenna|Ibn Sina]] (Avicenna, 980-1037), in ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]'' (1025), pioneered the idea of a [[syndrome]] in the diagnosis of specific diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goodman|2003|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Middle Ages ==
[[File:Konstantinderafrikaner.jpg|thumb|right|the analysis of urine]]
Physicians used many different techniques to analyze the imbalance of the four humours in the body. Urosocpy was most widely used for diagnosing illness. Physicians would collect patients urine in a flask called “matula”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dal Canton A, Castellano M | year = 1988 | title = Theory of urine formation and uroscopic diagnosis in the Medical School of Salerno | url = | journal = Kidney International | volume = 34 | issue = 2| pages = 273–7 | doi=10.1038/ki.1988.176}}&lt;/ref&gt; The matula was specific in shape and had four regions – circulus, superficies, substantia, and fundus – that corresponded to regions of the body. The circulus corresponded to the head; the superficies corresponded to the chest; the substantia corresponded to the abdomen; the fundus corresponded to the reproductive and urinary organs. Urine was inspected based on four criteria: color, consistency, odor, and presence of precipitate.&lt;ref&gt;Wittern-Sterzel R. (1999). Diagnosis: the

The color and viscosity denoted whether the patient had an acute, major, or chronic disease; which also assisted the physician with the next course of action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Diamandopoulos A.

By interpreting the pulse of the physician could diagnose the type of fever the patient had.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wallis F | year = 2000 | title = Signs and senses: diagnosis and prognosis in early medieval pulse and urine texts | url = | journal = Social History of Medicine | volume = 13 | issue = 2| pages = 265–78 | doi=10.1093/shm/13.2.265}}&lt;/ref&gt; Astrological diagnosis was the least used technique for diagnosing illness.

== 19th century ==
In the first half of the 19th century, the well-known British physiologist [[Marshall Hall (physiologist)|Marshall Hall]] emphasized the necessity of maintaining a close relationship between the theory and practice in medicine.&lt;ref&gt;Diana E. Manuel (1996). ''Marshall Hall (1790-1857): Science and Medicine in Early Victorian Society''. Volume 37 of Clio medica. Rodopi. p. 45-46&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote ''On diagnosis'' (1817) and ''The Principles of Diagnosis'' (1834).

== The Oslerian ideal ==
The ideals of [[William Osler]], who transformed the practice of medicine in the early 1900s, were based on the principles of the diagnosis and treatment of [[disease]]. According to Osler, the functions of a [[physician]] were to be able to identify disease and its manifestations and to understand its mechanisms and how it may be prevented or cured. For his medical students he believed that the best textbook was the patient himself—analysis of morbid [[anatomy]] and [[pathology]] were the keys. The Oslerian ideal continues today as the basis of the doctor's strategy is, "What disease does this patient have, and what is the best way for treatment?" The emphasis is on the classification of the disease in order to use the remedies available for its effects to be reversed or ameliorated. The human being in question is representative of a class of people with this type of disease; this person's biological individuality is not given any great weight.

== Garrod's view ==
The successor to William Osler as Regius Professor at Oxford was [[Archibald Garrod]]. Garrod echoed the observations of his Greek counterparts of two millennia ago, ''...our chemical individualities are due to our chemical merits as well as our chemical shortcomings; and it is more nearly true to say that the factors which confer upon us our predispositions to and immunities from various mishaps which are spoken of as diseases, are inherent in our very chemical structure; and even in the molecular groupings which confer upon us our individualities, and which went into the making of the [[chromosomes]] from which we sprang.''{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Because Garrod practiced in the early 1900s, well before the knowledge of [[DNA]] encoding [[genes]] that in turn encoded [[proteins]] responsible for bodily structure and functions were discovered, it took some time before medicine could fully appreciate the fundamental importance of his concept of diagnosis.

== Present-day Oslerian practice ==
Whereas Osler laid the founding principles by which medicine should be practiced, Garrod placed these principles in a greater context of a [[chemical]] individuality that is inherited and is subject to the mechanisms of [[evolutionary]] selection. The Oslerian ideal of medical practice continues to dominate medical philosophy today. The patient is a collective of [[symptoms]] to be characterized and analyzed [[algorithmically]] in order to draw a diagnosis and subsequently produce a strategy of treatment. Medicine is about problems based solutions. In keeping with this philosophy, today's pathology reports provide a momentary snapshot of the patient's [[biochemical]] profile, highlighting the end result of the disease process.

== Influence of DNA technology ==
Garrod's conception of biological individuality was confirmed with the advent of the sequencing of the human genome. Finally the subtle relationship between inheritance, individuality and environment became apparent via the variations detected in DNA. In each patient's DNA lies a script for how their bodies will change and become ill as well as how they will handle the assaults of the environment from the beginning of their life to its end. It is hoped that by knowing a patient's genes that the biological strengths and weaknesses in respect to these assaults will be revealed and disease processes can be predicted before they have the opportunity to manifest. Although knowledge in this area is far from complete, there are already medical interventions based on this. More importantly, the physician, forewarned with this knowledge can guide the patient towards appropriate lifestyle changes to anticipate and mitigate disease processes.

'''Indo-Grenadians''', or [[Grenadian people|Grenadians]] who trace their roots to [[India]], form the largest minority group in [[Grenada]]. This term is not generally recognized by Grenadians or indeed Caribbeans. They usually refer to themselves simply as Grenadian or possibly Caribbean. This group was first introduced during the second half of the 19th century when Grenada experimented with indentured labour. By the second half of the 20th century Indians were so integrated into Grenada’s society that a distinct Indian cultural identity was generally invisible. In addition, Indians were involved in every aspect of Grenadian life. Currently there are over 12,000 Grenadians of Indian and mixed-Indian descent (11% of the total population).

==History==
{{see|Indian indenture system}}
Historian S. N. Yadav described the history of Indo-Grenadians as "essentially the history of a relatively powerless ethnic group submitting without any organised resistance to an environment unfavourable to it in almost every sense".&lt;ref name="Yadav"/&gt; Historian Raymond D. Viechweg wrote in 2007, "the beginning of the trade in Indian indentures ... meant the continuous intermixing, or creolizing, of cultures that would eventually place the Grenadian Indian in a position of cultural vulnerability. When Indians arrived in Grenada in 1857, they found themselves in a position subordinate to a dominant Anglo-African creolization.  In Grenada, Indians have functioned within and alongside the dominant Afro-Grenadian cultural formation for 150 years now."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Viechweg|first1=Raymond D.|title=Abolition, Indentureship and Creoleness:  Reflections on the Indo-Grenadian Predicament|url=http://www.bigdrumnation.org/comments/indians_arrival.pdf|website=Big Drum Nation|accessdate=18 April 2017|date=June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the abolition of slavery in 1833&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Felix|first1=Martin P.|title=History of the Grenada Labor Movement|url=http://www.bigdrumnation.org/notes/grenadalabormovement.htm|website=www.bigdrumnation.org|accessdate=18 April 2017|date=1 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the full emancipation of African slaves in Grenada in 1838, plantation owners in the region sought to find alternate sources of labour. Grenadian planters initially made unsuccessful attempts to replace African slave labour with indentured workers from Africa, Malta and Portugal.&lt;ref name="Brunel"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sookram|first1=Ron|title=Immigrants to Citizens: the Indian Community in Grenada, 1857 to the Present|url=https://www.brunel.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/186073/ET63SookramRevsED.pdf|website=Brunel University London|accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Planters in the West Indies began using indentured workers from [[British Raj|British India]] as labour on their plantations. Learning of the success of the approach, planters in Grenada also sought to hire Indian indentured workers. [[British Grenada]] legalised immigration in 1856 to facilitate the arrival indentured migrant workers. The first ship carrying indentured workers from India, the ''Maidstone'', departed from Calcutta on 27 January 1857 with 375 Indians on board. It arrived at Irwin’s Bay in [[Saint Patrick Parish, Grenada|St. Patrick Parish]], Grenada on 1 May 1857. Eighty-six Indians died during the voyage.&lt;ref name="Yadav"/&gt; Most of the workers on the ''Maidstone'' were distributed to plantation estates in St. Patrick and St. Mark parishes, as well as other parishes. None were sent to plantations in St. John parish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BDM Interview with Wilbur Adams|url=http://www.bigdrumnation.org/comments/BDN_WAdams_interview1.pdf|website=Big Drum Nation|accessdate=18 April 2017|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Fulwood'' brought 362 live Indian workers to Grenada in 1858 and the ''Jalawar'' brought 249 workers the following year. Between 1857 and 1878, ships transported a total of 3,033 Indians to Grenada, excluding those who died during the voyage. The last ship carrying 175 indentured Indian labourers arrived on the island some time between 1881 and 1885.&lt;ref name="Yadav"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yadav|first1=S.

Only about 15% of them returned to India, while the rest remained in the country even after their indenture period ended in 1890. These Indians are the origin of the Indo-Grenadian community.&lt;ref name = "Brunel"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Bell"/&gt;

The 100th anniversary of the first arrival of Indians in Grenada was commemorated in 1957. This was the first ever commemoration of the day in Grenada.

On 29 April 2009, the Government of Grenada declared that the 1st of May would officially be designated as Indian Arrival Day and observed annually alongside the existing Labour Day. The date was already a public holiday in Grenada, on account of Labour Day. The Government also announced that Boucherie Road, the road leading to the site of the arrival of the ''Maidstone'', would be officially renamed Maidstone Road to honour the arrival of Indians in Grenada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=L'ARRIVEE INDIENNE COMMEMOREE A GRENADE ET SAINTE-LUCIE|url=http://www.montraykreyol.org/article/larrivee-indienne-commemoree-a-grenade-et-sainte-lucie|website=Montray Kréyol|accessdate=18 April 2017|language=fr|date=25 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The renaming was officially carried out in a ceremony at 10:30 AM at La Fortune Junction, St. Patrick on 2 May 2009. Governor General Sir Carlyle Glean unveiled a granite plaque commemorating the arrival of the first Indians in Grenada. The plaque bears the inscription, "On 1st May 1857, in this bay the sailing vessel “Maidstone” anchored and landed 287 passengers having left India three months earlier, with 304 passengers. Between the years 1857 and 1890 other ships anchored in this and other bays bringing a total of 3,200 persons from India to work as agricultural indenture labourers in Grenada. This monument is dedicated to those who became the genesis of the Indo-Grenadian population of our nation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ferguson|first1=Michael|title=Indian Arrival Day Celebrations|url=http://belmontestate.net/news.htm|website=belmontestate.net|accessdate=18 April 2017|date=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kami'''/'''Bishwakarma''' (Nepali: कामी/ विश्वकर्मा) is an ethno-linguistic [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] [[Nepali language|Nepali]] speaking group. It is a [[Khas]] occupational caste belonging to blacksmiths.{{sfn|Whelpton|2005|p=31}} The 1854 Nepalese Muluki Ain (Legal Code) not keep in lowest category.&lt;ref&gt;Gurung, Harka (2005) Social Exclusion and Maoist Insurgency.

They live in Nepal, [[Sikkim]] and [[Darjeeling District]] of [[West Bengal]], [[India]]. Kamis are essentially blacksmiths Kami/Vishowkarma are Vishowkarmabramin.are scattered across almost all hilly districts of Nepal, districts of Sikkim, Darjeeling (a District of W.B), and [[Assam]]; some have settled in other parts of India as well. They are also known as Vishwakarma or Bishwakarma.

The Kami are traditionally held to be the descendants of God or [[Vishvakarman|Lord Vishwakarma]]. They are one sub-caste from other Vishwakarma sub-caste to kami they have their own identity and occupation and language. The word ''kami'' may derive from the Sanskrit word ''karma'' or ''kam'', meaning "work". The Kami make the famous [[Khukuri]] knives used by the [[Gurkha]] Army, and a traditional Nepali drum called a [[Madal]]. They are also expert performers of the traditional folk dance ''[[Maruni]] Nritya''.

According to the 2001 Nepal census, there were a total of 895,954 Kami, of whom 96.69% were [[Hindu]]s and 2.21% were [[Buddhist]]s. According to [[2011 Nepal census]], Kami make up 4.8% of Nepal's population (or 12,58,554 peoples).&lt;ref name="cbs"&gt;{{Cite web|URL=https://unstats.un.org/unsD/demographic/sources/census/wphc/Nepal/Nepal-Census-2011-Vol1.pdf|title=Nepal Census 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mbunda people]] started migrating to [[Barotseland]] now Western Province of [[Zambia]] in the latter part of the 18th Century.&lt;ref&gt;The elites of Barotseland, 1878-1969: a political history of Zambia's Western Province: a.

The three were all received by the Aluyi King Mulambwa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2LT2YEkA04MC&amp;lpg=PA106&amp;ots=rQDKPuN8Od&amp;dq=Bo|title=The Historical Study of African Religion|last=Center|first=University of California, Los Angeles African Studies|date=1972|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520022065|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bantu-Languages.com"&gt;[http://www.bantu-languages.com/fr/zonek.html Bantu-Languages.com], citing Maniacky 1997&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the Mbunda chiefs started migrating at the beginning of the 20th century due to the [[Mbunda people|Mbunda]] resistance to Portuguese colonial occupation, when the Portuguese colonialists abducted the twenty first (21st) Mbunda Monarch, King [[Mwene Mbandu Kapova I of Mbunda|Mwene Mbandu I Lyondthzi Kapova]].&lt;ref&gt;René Pélissier, ''La révolte des Bunda (1916-1917)'', pp. 408 - 412 (French for "the Mbunda revolt"), section footnotes citing sources: Luís Figueira, Princesa Negra: ''O preço da civilização em África, Coimbra'' Edição do autor, 1932.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the Mbunda/Aluyi interaction since the end of the 18th Century in Barotseland, the Mbunda named  the Aluyi King Lubosi "Litunga Liwanika lya mafuti, Njamba kalimi, lifuti limulimina". This is a Mbunda name meaning, "Builder and Uniter of Nations" and depicting an Elephant (Njamba in Mbunda), a Mbunda monarch symbol. This was in recognition of King Lubosi's justice on discovery of the concealment of Aluyi fighters who killed Mbunda commanders after the Aluyi/Tonga war, for fear of the Mbunda getting the credit for the victory over the Tonga, and after the absorption of not only the conquered Makololo, but also the Mbunda immigrants, the Ndebele raiders and the ever-increasing European presence in Barotseland since 1864.

== Status of Mbunda Chiefs In Barotseland ==
Mbunda Chiefs and their people have continued to be subjective to the Barotse Royal Establishment. Negative reactions from different quarters between the two peoples could be attributed to lack of correct information of subject matters. Mbunda Chieftainships obtaining in Barotseland and else where in Zambia are "Mbunda Institutions" which would not be substituted, and will remain in existence even when a chief in a person is dethroned, by replacement of another Mbunda from the same royal family tree.

Interactive approaches by the 23rd Mbunda Monarch, His Majesty King Mbandu III Mbandu Lifuti of Angola to his counterpart the 24th King of Barotseland, His Majesty Lubosi Imwiko II, in appreciating the time long co-existence with his people and for the continued cordial relationship between the two peoples indicate exemplary statesmanship. Whereas parallel structures of introducing a Mbunda Royal Council or Establishment in Barotseland has never been considered by the Mbunda Monarch in Angola, however, the Mbunda Chiefs in Zambia and Barotseland in particular, having to be installed by the Mbunda Monarch in Angola, while maintaining their subjectivity to the Litunga, for those in Barotseland as practiced in like manner by the Paramount Chief Undi of the Chewa people of Zambia, Malawi and Mozambique would help preserve the Mbunda culture and traditions.

Traditional Mbundaland in Angola recognize chieftainship of all migrant ethnicity living in the land and continue living with them all in harmony, while paying allegiance to their central chieftainship in their countries of origin. Equally, Mbunda people in the diaspora pay allegiance to the Mbunda Monarch in Angola, while recognizing and being subjective, but not subservient to authorities that be in the diaspora.

Following is a list of [[Mbunda people|Mbunda]] chiefs in [[Zambia]], who ascribe to the 23rd [[Mbunda people|Mbunda]] monarch [[Mbunda people|His Majesty, King Mwene Mbandu III Mbandu Lifuti]] in Lumbala Nguimbo, [[Moxico Province|Moxico]], [[Angola]]:

== Chief Mwene Mundu Dynasty ==
The first [[Mbunda people|Mbunda]] Chiefs to settle in Bulozi were of the [[Mbunda language]] (Vambalango). The ancestor of the Mbunda Mbalango was a woman chief called Vamwene Nungu in Mbundaland now [[Angola]]. Not all of the children succeeded to  chieftainship. Sometimes the succession followed Lozi custom as the Vambalango lived among the Lozi and tended to adopt Lozi customs.

Thus the name  Mwene Mundu is a title that is given to every Mbunda-Mbalango chief at Liumba, in Kalabo District, who succeeds to the chieftainship. After this visit, Chief Mwene Mundu returned to Mbundaland and shifted from his former palace and settled in Kapuyi. In his second visit to Bulozi he found King Yeta Twamona had died, he this time he met King Ngombala of the Aluyi people. Mbunda chief usually visited Bulozi from Mbundaland now [[Angola]] to visit Aluyi chiefs due to its proximity. When King Mulambwa was on his throne he remembered this Friendship which had existed between Chief Mwene Mundu and King Yeta Twamona. Therefore he also decided to strengthen the friendship between the Mbunda and the Aluyi. During the time of King Mulambwa in Bulozi, Chief Mwene Mundu's  fame had grown so much that the King Mulambwa sent for him. Chief Mwene Mundu brought along with him ministers or vimyata on this third trip together with his sons and stayed for a while in a place called Kama in Bulozi. By this time Chief Mwene Mundu had decided to shift from Kapuyi, a river in Mbundaland now Angola into Bulozi. When he finally shifted to Bulozi he wanted to settle in Kama but did not because the soil was not good for agricultural purposes, thus he settled in Ndoka. Because he had come with a very large group of people they could not settle in one place; Chief Mwene Kakinga ka Chompe settled in Mbunde, Chief Mwene Nkando in Mayela, Chief Mwene Kalomo ka Chompe in Lukoela and Chief Mwene Mbambi in Mbambi. Others settled at Kamonga, Chisole, and some in Liande and even today there are remains of settlements such as old agricultural ridges and canals.

== Chief Mwene Kandala Dynasty ==
The second [[Mbunda people|Mbunda Chiefs]] to settle in Bulozi were also of the [[Mbunda language|Mbunda Mbalango dialect]] (Vambalango). During the reign of Chief Mundu Kalomo ka Chompe, Chief Kandala Vyemba, nephew to Chief Mundu Man'ulumbe fled into Bulozi. Chief Kandala had come into Bulozi to seek asylum for he was being sought for by King Ngonga I Chiteta of the Mbunda ya Mathzi after a domestic dispute between them which had erupted from a theft case that involved the two Royalties in which Chief Kandala's people had stolen an antelope from King Ngonga I Chiteta's hunting trap. Sometimes the succession followed Lozi custom as the Vambalango lived among the Lozi and tended to adopt Lozi customs.

Chief Mwene Kandala Vyemba left his country for Bulozi because of differences he had firstly with his brother Chungamalala Kasavi and secondly with [[List of the rulers of the Mbunda Kingdom|King Ngonga I Chiteta]]. In both cases theft was involved by Chief Kandala's subordinates who had, in the Fulumana river area of Mbundaland now [[Angola]], stolen an antelope belonging to [[List of the rulers of the Mbunda Kingdom|King Ngonga I Chiteta]]. After these disputes and warnings Chief Mwene Kandala decided to leave Mbundaland leaving his brother Chungamalala Kasavi there as he departed for Bulozi. When they reached Tushole his wife delivered a baby girl and nicknamed the baby "Kashembe", Meaning:  "We shall be mocked at that we deliver whilst on the way." After that they came  to Lilengo and then proceeded to Kalamba. He was welcomed by the Aluyi King Mulambwa. They were allowed to settle at Kanyonyo. Before they finally settled at Kanyonyo, Chief Mwene Kandala Vyemba was granted the status of Proselyte in the Lozi chieftainship and was recognized as a son of the King Mulambwa who gave him a herd of cattle for this recognition. Chief Kandala lived many years during the rule of King Mulambwa and died at his palace in Yuka and was buried near the modern site of Mongu's Lewanika hospital.

This contrast grew so sharp that they referred the matter to the King Mulambwa for a solution but he only advised them to observe their traditional customs. They enthrned Kalanda Kumba as Chief but they did not give him the title of  Chief Mwene Kandala which they gave to Chief  Ngulungu Mushondo.

In frustration he migrated to [[Barotseland]] in the now [[Zambia]] in 1795. King Mulambwa offered Chief mwene Chitengi Chingumbe Chiyengele the area known as Namaya in the plains east of Namuyowa for him to settle with the people. But he declined that offer because the Mbunda were not used to staying in the plain, but preferred forests where they cultivate their staple food such as cassava, millet family crops, beans, groundnuts and bush potatoes. Thereafter he was offered another area called Nan'oko, in [[Mongu]] where Chief Mwene Chitengi Chingumbe Chiyengele built his Palace, and settled with a group of his Mbunda followers. The Aluyi and their leader, the Litunga Mulambwa especially prized the Mbunda for their ability to fight.

== Chief Mwene Chikufele Dynasty ==
After the death of King Mulambwa, the Makololo defeated and occupied Bulozi. Some Aluyi and Mbundas migrated from Bulozi to other places.
The Mbunda who had supported Prince Mubukwanu, one of Mulambwa's sons left for the now Kabompo. Most of them went to Nakalomo in present-day Lukulu. Here they abandoned their stockade due to Makololo attacks. When Nxaba (Ngabe) in his pursuance to invade the Makololo came to Kakenge's area, (ruler of the Luvale) in the north, he failed to break through the Mbunda fortress at Nakalomo. He then negotiated and tried to persuade the Mbunda to join him and his group, in an alliance against the Kololo. The Mbunda however remained suspicious and merely supplied the Mandebele with guides who took them across the Zambezi westwards in the direction of the Kololo who at that time were pursuing the Luyana fleeing to Nyengo. Those Mandebele were all killed in the valley which was named after them as "Matebele Valley". 
Those Mbunda who in 1830 had, due to Makololo invasion, abandoned Nakalomo went to settle east of Manyinga river finding there only a few Nkoya villages. Prior to 1920 the now Kabompo District was uninhabited. Amongst those that migrated to Manyinga, were Prince Namiluko the son of Mulambwa with his son Chikufele. They took the Nkoya under control and established the headquarters of their leader Chikufele (Sikufele) at what came to be known as Lukwakwa. Prince Namiluko and his son Prince Chikufele established the Mbunda Chieftainship at Kabompo, after the expulsion of the Kalolo inversion. After that,  many of the Mbundas returned to Barotseland but the Chikufele family remained at Lukwakwa. In those years the Chokwes, the Luvales and the Luchazis had not yet migrated to Kabompo. Though there were some Lozi rulers who were allowed to the Lukwakwa throne, it basically remained under the control of the Mbunda. Sikufele became the main chief of all the Manyinga Native Authorities and the Administrative Court remained under the Mbunda after it was restored from the Lunda. While power was being firmly wrestled by the Mbunda in Manyinga area their influence at the Central Throne of the Lozi Kingdom was still felt. After Lubosi Lewanika fled the throne at the insurrection by Mataa and Numwa in 1884, Tatila Akufuna, one who knew not a single word in Luyana nor in Chikololo (Sikololouthe new Lozi), but spoke Mbunda,&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=nvq19UbIgZwC&amp;pg=PA117&amp;lpg=PA137&amp;ots=WuDq6xYOrv&amp;focus=viewport&amp;dq=lewanika+mbunda&amp;output=html_text Bulozi Under the Luyana Kings: Political Evolution and State Formation in ... By Mutumba Mainga, Mutumba Mainga Bull page 117&lt;/ref&gt; was called upon to take up the central throne. Tatila Akufuna (son of Imbue) was a direct product of the Mbunda at Lukwakwa.

Later, groups of Luchazi started moving further East from Chief Shinde's area, where they settled earlier and were welcomed and given land in the Upper Mumbeji, by Chief Chikufele, under the Manyinga Native Authorities. This was followed by groups of Chokwes, Luvales and Lundas (not in any sequence). In 1941, before Kabompo Boma came into existence, the Government separated Zambezi from Barotseland. Chief Chikufele  had two other Mbunda subordinated chiefs namely Chiengele, Vulamitata and two others: a Nkoya called Mutinginyi and a  
Luchazi called Kalunga. In 1944 recognition was withdrawn from Mutinginyi and Vulamitata. In 1945 Induna Imasiku was recalled to Barotseland.  The Mbunda in Manyinga resolved never again to be presided by a Barotseland Indunas. Chief Shinde of Zambezi wanted to control Manyinga in order to include it to his Zambezi areas. However, Manyinga people and village headmen rejected th Chief Shinde's move, contending that; the Chikufele chieftainship is the earlier and most senior in Manyinga, and that the first local court in Manyinga was his at his palace. An election was therefore organized, comprising more than 300 village headmen and all chiefs in the area, and Chief Chikufele was elected the Senior Chief of Manyinga Native Authority. Manyinga Native Aothority was at his palace. Senior Chief Chikufele then decreed that; he had broken away from Barotseland and that he would remain independent at Manyinga with the Mbunda chieftainship and that, it should be known that he was a Mbunda. Chief Mwene Chikufele remained a supreme power in the political administration of the whole Manyinga area and was seen as a symbol of the British administrative system. He was to be helped by the Council whose powers he could not to overrule. There were administrative villages called Ndandanda (or ndandanga) which consisted of membo (villages)

== Chief Mwene Kathimba Dynasty ==
This is a Mbunda Chieftainship related to Chief Chitengi Chingumbe Chiyengele, which was later recognised after the Kaonde/Lozi war, which the Lozis won with the help of the Mbunda war machinery, resulting in the Mbunda Chieftainship of Chief Mwene Kathimba having firmly been established at the confluence of the Lalafuta and Kyamenge in 1893, opposite Chief Mushima Njivumina of the Kaonde. The chieftainship of the Chief Mwene Kathimba brought peace to the area. It is said that when the first Mwene Kathimba arrived, Nkoya inhabiitants of the area were forced to live in stockaded villages for fear of the Kaonde who were their enemies at that time. But today all three peoples co-exist with mutual respect in Kaoma District of the Western Province of Zambia.

'''Louis Bennett Butler Jr.''' (born 1952) is a former justice of the [[Wisconsin Supreme Court]].

He is the [[List of African American firsts|first]] [[African American]] to serve on the Wisconsin Supreme Court.

Louis Butler was born and raised in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]].  He earned his bachelor's degree from [[Lawrence University]] in 1973 and his [[Juris Doctor|law degree]] from the [[University of Wisconsin Law School]] in 1977.

After serving as an assistant state [[public defender]] from 1979 to 1992, Louis Butler was appointed to the [[State court (United States)|Municipal Court]] in [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]]. He served as a municipal judge until 2002, when he was elected to Branch 9 of the [[Milwaukee County]] [[Circuit Court]].

Butler was the first sitting Wisconsin Supreme Court justice to be defeated in a reelection campaign since 1967.

Obama then renominated Butler on September 13, 2010. [[NPR]] commented on the Senate's reluctance to confirm Butler in an August 4, 2011 article, stating that "Some of the longest waiting nominees, Louis Butler of Wisconsin, [[Charles Bernard Day]] of Maryland and [[Edward C.

'''Global [[mangrove]] distributions''' have fluctuated throughout human and [[Geology|geological]] history. The area covered by mangroves is influenced by a complex interaction between land position, [[rain]]fall [[hydrology]], [[sea level]], [[sedimentation]], [[subsidence]], storms and pest-predator relationships&lt;ref name="Eslami-Andargoli et al. 2009"&gt;Eslami-Andargoli, L., Dale, P. et al.

Gland, Switzerland, The World Conservation Union (IUCN) 2.&lt;/ref&gt;). In the last 50 years, human activities have strongly affected mangrove distributions, resulting in declines or expansions of worldwide mangrove area. Mangroves provide several important ‘free services’ including [[coast]]al stabilization, [[juvenile fish]] habitats, and the filtration of sediment and nutrients&lt;ref name="Valieala et al. 2001"&gt;Valiela, I., Bowen, J.

As of 2012, mangroves are found in 105 nations globally.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although distributed across 105 nations, the top 10 mangrove holding nations contain approximately 52% of the global mangrove stock with Indonesia alone containing between 26% and 29% of the entire global mangrove stock.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The largest continuous area of mangrove forest is likely in-and-around the Sundarbans National Park in India and the Sundarbans Mangrove Forests in Bangladesh,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Global Mangrove Forests Distribution, v1: Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) {{!}} SEDAC|url=http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/lulc-global-mangrove-forests-distribution-2000|doi=10.7927/h4j67dw8}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are both recognized by UNESCO as World Heritage Sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/?search=sundarbans&amp;searchSites=&amp;search_by_country=&amp;region=&amp;search_yearinscribed=&amp;themes=&amp;criteria_restrication=&amp;type=&amp;media=&amp;order=country&amp;description=|title=UNESCO World Heritage Centre - World Heritage List|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although existing almost exclusively in the tropics and near-tropics, warm ocean currents support mangrove forests as far north as Walsingham Nature Reserve (Idwal Hughes Nature Reserve) in Bermuda and as far south as Snake Island, Australia.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Mangrove declines==

=== Global trends ===

In the last five decades, worldwide mangrove area has fallen across all regions.&lt;ref name="Valieala et al. 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alongi 2002"&gt;Alongi, D. M. 2002. Present state and future of the world's mangrove forests. Environmental Conservation, 29, 331–349.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FAO"&gt;FAO 2007. The World's Mangroves 1980–2005. FAO Forestry Paper. Rome: Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) no.153&lt;/ref&gt; Different data sources or survey methods make estimates more problematic, as many nations have high variations of mangrove change.&lt;ref name="Valieala et al. 2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Alongi 2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FAO" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barbier and Sathirathai 2004"&gt;Barbier, E. &amp; Sathirathai, S. 2004. Shrimp farming and mangrove loss in Thailand, Cheltenham, Edward Elgar Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Percentage of original area lost per year'''
* Asia: 1.52%
* Africa: 1.25%
* Australia: 1.99%
* Americas: 3.62%
* The World: 2.07%

(based on data from)&lt;ref name="Valieala et al. 2001"/&gt; ''(Annual loss rates  calculated from the mean number of years between original area and present area for each region: 24, 25, 7, 11, and 17
years for Asia, Africa, Australia, the Americas, and the world, respectively.) ''

From 2000 to 2012, the global mangrove deforestation rate was between 0.16% and 0.39% annually but as high as 3.58% to 8.08% in Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; The most recent and comprehensive global assessment of mangrove distribution was conducted by Hamilton and Casey (2016) and provides a high-resolution global database of mangrove loss at the 1 arc-second level at annual intervals from 2000 to 2012 with estimates for 2013 and 2014.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;  In the 1980s and 1990s the greatest amount of loss occurred, while in the period of 2000 to 2005 the rate has fallen significantly across all regions.&lt;ref name="FAO"/&gt; Some projections estimate that worldwide mangrove area will decline by a further 25% by 2025, particularly in developing nations.&lt;ref name="McLeod and Salm 2006"&gt;McLeod, E. &amp; Salm, R. V. 2006. Managing mangroves for resilience to climate change. Gland, Switzerland: The World Conservation Union (IUCN)&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that since 1970, 28% of mangrove lost has been directly displaced by commercial aquaculture.&lt;ref name="Hamilton 585–601"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hamilton|first=Stuart|date=2013-04-01|title=Assessing the Role of Commercial Aquaculture in Displacing Mangrove Forest|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/umrsmas/bullmar/2013/00000089/00000002/art00013|journal=Bulletin of Marine Science|volume=89|issue=2|pages=585–601|doi=10.5343/bms.2012.1069}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role of perception===
People’s [[perception]] of mangrove ecosystems has been instrumental in the loss of mangroves. Commonly, they have been undervalued and considered ‘wastelands’ with low [[productivity]] (,&lt;ref name="FAO"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McLeod and Salm 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Krauss et al. 2008"&gt;Krauss, K. W., Lovelock, C. E., McKee, K. L., Lopez-Hoffman, L., Ewe, S. M. L. &amp; Sousa, W. P. 2008. Environmental drivers in mangrove establishment and early development: A review. Aquatic Botany, 89, 105–127.&lt;/ref&gt;). Concerns for the fate of mangroves have historically been restricted to [[Scientific community|scientific communities]], with little transfer of knowledge to [[Local community|local communities]] and governments.&lt;ref name="Valieala et al. 2001"/&gt; Mangroves are a [[Common-pool resource|common pool resource]], creating difficulties in enforcing restrictions on exploitative activities.&lt;ref name="Idrus 2009"&gt;Idrus, M. R. 2009. Hard habits to break : investigating coastal resource utilisations and management systems in Sulawesi, Indonesia : a thesis submitted in partial of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Environmental Science at the University of Canterbury.&lt;/ref&gt;
More recently, perceptions have shifted to a broader acknowledgment within communities and governments of the value of mangroves in coastal ecosystems and local communities. The declining rate of mangrove loss since 2000 across all regions is indicative of this, bringing forth an increasing number of [[Conservation biology|conservation]] projects and [[legislation]].&lt;ref name="FAO"/&gt;

===Causes of decline===
A variety of factors have led to the declining trends in mangrove distribution (refer to table fig of causes). These factors are predominantly [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] in origin, as mangrove destruction is positively [[Correlation and dependence|correlated]] to human population density.&lt;ref name="Alongi 2002" /&gt; Up to 35% of mangrove forests worldwide have been lost since 1980, reflecting the increased pressure from high population densities residing at the [[coast]].&lt;ref name="Valieala et al. 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alongi 2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FAO"/&gt; Mangrove losses to climate change are considered a probable long term threat to future distribution.&lt;ref name="Alongi 2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McLeod and Salm 2006"/&gt; Despite a wide variety of factors linked to mangrove loss (insert figure of causes), the main drivers of recent (i.e. after 1980) mangrove destruction are linked to four main activities: [[urban sprawl]], [[tourism]], [[agriculture]] and [[aquaculture]].&lt;ref name="Valieala et al. 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alongi 2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FAO"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Farnsworth and Ellison 1997"&gt;Farnsworth, E. J. &amp; Ellison, A. M. 1997. The global conservation status of mangroves. Ambio, 328–334.&lt;/ref&gt; The causes of declines in mangrove areas vary between regions. In [[Asia]], the [[Caribbean]] and [[Latin America]], aquaculture and tourism development are the greatest threat.&lt;ref name="FAO"/&gt; In [[Oceania]], tourism development is the greatest threat while in [[Africa]], conversion of mangroves for agricultural and urban development is most apparent.&lt;ref name="FAO"/&gt;

'''Aquaculture''' – This activity is considered the greatest contributor to worldwide mangrove loss.&lt;ref name="Barbier and Sathirathai 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McLeod and Salm 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamilton 585–601"/&gt; Since the 1980s, [[shrimp]] aquaculture dramatically increased, replacing mangroves with ponds and degrading surrounding areas with associated pollution.&lt;ref name="Valieala et al. 2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dierbergand and Kiattisimkul 1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FAO" /&gt;  Aquaculture has dramatically affected some regions. For example, 50-80% of mangroves were lost in Asia in the past decades.&lt;ref name="Farnsworth and Ellison 1997" /&gt; Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America have been most affected by aquaculture&lt;ref name="FAO" /&gt;

[[File:Lone house in Petite-Anse (1180932461).jpg|thumb|Urban expansion - Urban development on mangrove habitat in [[Cap-Haitien, Haiti]]]]

'''Urban expansion''' – As population density increases at the coast, areas of mangrove forest have been replaced to provide urban and [[Industry|industrial]] lands.&lt;ref name="FAO"/&gt;

'''Tourism''' – infrastructure supporting tourism often requires the reclamation of substantial tracts of mangrove forests.&lt;ref name="FAO"/&gt; In the Americas and Oceania, tourism is a major driver of mangrove loss. Where tourism is a main contributor to an [[economy]] (such as Pacific Island nations), construction of [[resort]]s and related [[infrastructure]]s have reduced mangrove area in past decades.&lt;ref name="FAO"/&gt;

'''Agriculture''' – Conversion of mangrove forests for agriculture has occurred across all regions historically, freeing up land for activities such as rice or [[salt]] production (.&lt;ref name="FAO"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Farnsworth and Ellison 1997"/&gt;

====Mangrove loss case study: shrimp aquaculture in South-east Asia====
In many South-east Asian nations, shrimp aquaculture has been instrumental in mangrove loss, particularly in the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref name="Valieala et al. 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dierbergand and Kiattisimkul 1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FAO"/&gt; Due to high economic returns, shrimp farming was promoted to improve economic conditions in many countries.&lt;ref name="Dierbergand and Kiattisimkul 1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barbier and Sathirathai 2004" /&gt; The social and economic benefits of shrimp farming are substantial.&lt;ref name="Dierbergand and Kiattisimkul 1996" /&gt; Shrimp farms are located close to the coast to reduce costs by using [[Tide|tidal]] energy and short [[canal]] lengths to the coast.&lt;ref name="Dierbergand and Kiattisimkul 1996" /&gt; Consequently, vast tracts of mangrove forest have been replaced by numerous ponds. Compounding mangrove losses is the short life span of individual ponds (5–10 years), imposing a [[shifting cultivation]] pattern to shrimp farming.&lt;ref name="Valieala et al. 2001"/&gt;

After 1980, shrimp farming became far more [[intensive]], with high productivity (per unit area) ponds proliferating across the landscape.&lt;ref name="Dierbergand and Kiattisimkul 1996" /&gt; Dramatic reductions in mangrove forests were reported with shrimp pond intensification. In [[Thailand]], mangrove forests literally halved between 1975–1993&lt;ref name="Aksornkoae and Tokrishna 2004"&gt;Aksornkoae, S. &amp; Tokrishna, R. 2004. Overview of shrimp farming and mangrove loss in Thailand. In: Barbier, E. &amp; Sathirathai, S. (eds.) Shrimp farming and mangrove loss in Thailand. Cheltenham Edward Elgar Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; The impact of such losses has been linked to the disruption of [[Ecology|ecological]] and economic functioning of mangroves.&lt;ref name="Barbier and Sathirathai 2004" /&gt; For example, loss of income for local Thai fishermen has been reported due to reduced catches from the degradation of [[Juvenile (organism)|juvenile]] fish habitat.&lt;ref name="Barbier and Sathirathai 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Aksornkoae and Tokrishna 2004" /&gt;
Some consider that the number of shrimp farms in South-east Asia peaked in the late 1990s, with the rate of mangrove loss declining accordingly.&lt;ref name="Aksornkoae and Tokrishna 2004" /&gt; This decline is in part due to increased [[Conservation biology|conservation]] and [[Restoration ecology|restoration]] projects, and improved [[management]] practices.

===Global climate change and mangrove loss===
Increases in temperature, CO2, precipitation, storms, and sea level are likely to threaten mangroves in the future.&lt;ref name="McLeod and Salm 2006"/&gt; Sea level rise is considered the greatest [[climate change]] related threat to mangrove regions.&lt;ref name="Alongi 2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McLeod and Salm 2006"/&gt; The natural ability of mangroves to ‘keep up’ with rising [[sea level]] through [[peat]] or [[sediment]] accumulation could be exceeded, leading to mangrove die back.&lt;ref name="Ellison 1993"&gt;Ellison, J. C. 1993. Mangrove retreat with rising sea-level, Bermuda. [[Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science]], 37, 75–87.&lt;/ref&gt;[[Low island]] mangroves are most at risk, as demonstrated in [[Bermuda]], where sea level rise has exceeded peat accumulation rates periodically, resulting in landward die back of mangrove stands.&lt;ref name="Ellison 1993" /&gt; Climate change may reduce global mangrove area by 10-15%, but it is a long term, less significance threat to the current 1-2% annual loss from human activities.&lt;ref name="Alongi 2002" /&gt;

==Mangrove expansions==

=== Global trends ===

Several nations have experienced an expansion of their mangrove area. These expansions include human activities promoting seaward or landward expansion from climatic or other local factors, as well as conservation and [[reforestation]] programmes.&lt;ref name="Morrisey et al. 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FAO"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Farnsworth and Ellison 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harty 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Saintilan and Wilton 2001" /&gt; Globally, this stability and expansion is far outweighed by the magnitude of mangrove loss from human activities.

===Seaward expansion and human activity===
Seaward mangrove expansion is considered a natural response to high inputs of sediment and nutrients from human activity in adjacent [[Catchment area (human geography)|catchments]];.&lt;ref name="Morrisey et al. 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Harty 2009"&gt;Harty, C. 2009. Mangrove planning and management in New Zealand and South East Australia - A reflection on approaches. Ocean and Coastal Management, 52, 278–286.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lovelock et al 2007"&gt;Lovelock, C. E., Feller, I. C., Ellis, J., Schwarz, A. M., Hancock, N., Nichols, P. &amp; Sorrell, B. 2007. Mangrove growth in New Zealand estuaries: The role of nutrient enrichment at sites with contrasting rates of sedimentation.&lt;/ref&gt; Mangroves naturally encourage [[sediment]] deposition by slowing [[Ocean current|currents]] and attenuating [[Wind wave|waves]]. However, with high [[sediment]] inputs, the elevation of [[intertidal]] flats can rise above the [[low tide]] limit of the original mangrove forest, resulting in a seaward expansion of new mangrove [[habitat]].&lt;ref name="Morrisey et al. 2007" /&gt; Once new mangroves establish, they too begin to trap more sediment, raising the tidal flat elevation and generating more mangrove habitat.&lt;ref name="Morrisey et al. 2007" /&gt; Seaward expansions are likely in regions with modified catchments (i.e. deforestation or urban development) with high topography where high sediments loads are delivered to mangroves at the coast.&lt;ref name="Harty 2009" /&gt; Extremely high rates of sediment input can exceed tolerance thresholds and induce mangrove die backs.&lt;ref name="Krauss et al. 2008"/&gt; Excess sedimentation is the primary control, but [[nutrients]] (i.e. from [[agricultural runoff]]) can enhance mangrove expansion, particularly when combined with high levels of [[sedimentation]].&lt;ref name="Lovelock et al 2007" /&gt; Seaward expansions highlight the interconnectivity of mangrove ecosystems to adjacent catchments and the need to consider catchment alteration when managing mangroves.

[[File:SEAWARD mangrove migration.jpg|thumb| Conceptual model of seaward mangrove migrations]]

====Case study: New Zealand mangroves====
In [[New Zealand]] (NZ), [[temperate]] mangroves (Avicennia marina) are common in [[estuaries]], harbours and [[tidal]] creeks north of 38° latitude.&lt;ref name="Morrisey et al. 2007" /&gt; Following [[European colonization]], mangrove area declined, but since the 1970s rapid, ongoing seaward expansion has occurred in many areas.&lt;ref name="Morrisey et al. 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Harty 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lovelock et al 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Park 2004"&gt;Park, S. 2004. Aspects of Mangrove Distribution and Abundance in Tauranga Harbour. Whakatane: Environment Bay of Plenty, 2004/16.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the last 50 years mangrove area has expanded 120% in Tuaranga Harbour.&lt;ref name="Park 2004" /&gt; Such expansion is strongly correlated with elevated rates of sediment deposition. [[Drainage basin|Catchment]] activities such as [[deforestation]] and more recently, [[urban development]] have been blamed for the expansion.&lt;ref name="Morrisey et al. 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Harty 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lovelock et al 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Park 2004" /&gt;
Considerable debate over whether to protect or remove NZ mangroves exist. Proponents for protection cite the ecological and coastal protection values of mangrove stands, while removal advocates aim to restore recreational values and prevent encroachment into non-mangrove ecosystems.&lt;ref name="Harty 2009" /&gt; A shift in the management strategy of regional councils from protection to mangrove ‘management’ has occurred recently&lt;ref name="Harty 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="De Luca 2009"&gt;De Luca, S. 2009. Mangrove Management - Balancing Values. Coastal News, NZ no. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Removals may take place when human amenities or non-mangrove habitats are deemed threatened by mangrove encroachment.&lt;ref name="Harty 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="De Luca 2009" /&gt; Some researchers caution comparisons being made between NZ and [[tropical]] mangroves, suggesting NZ mangroves are unique in their ecology and require a tailored [[management]] approach.&lt;ref name="Harty 2009" /&gt;

===Landward expansion===
In contrast to seaward expansions in NZ, [[landward]] expansions are documented in a number of regions ([[Thailand]], Australia, and [[Hawaii]]).&lt;ref name="Eslami-Andargoli et al. 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Harty 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Saintilan and Wilton 2001"&gt;Saintilan, N. &amp; Wilton, K. 2001. Changes in the distribution of mangroves and saltmarshes in Jervis Bay, Australia. Wetlands Ecology and Management, 9, 409–420.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chimner et al. 2006"&gt;Chimner, R. A., Fry, B., Kaneshiro, M. Y. &amp; Cormier, N. 2006. Current Extent and Historical Expansion of Introduced Mangroves on O'ahu, Hawai'i1. Pacific Science, 60, 377–383&lt;/ref&gt; The cause of landward expansions is not always clear. In Eastern Australia expansions have replaced salt marshes with various suggestions for the cause of landward expansion (increased rainfall, changes in hydrology, to local subsidence).&lt;ref name="Eslami-Andargoli et al. 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Harty 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Saintilan and Wilton 2001" /&gt; Expansions in Hawaii are thought to be the result of invasions by [[Invasive species|exotic]] mangrove species.&lt;ref name="Chimner et al. 2006" /&gt;

===Expansion through conservation and restoration===
More recently, awareness of the economic, social, and [[ecological]] values of mangroves have led to an increase in the number of initiatives to protect and restore mangrove areas.&lt;ref name="Valieala et al. 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FAO"/&gt; Broader recognition of the connection of mangroves to coastal food chains, [[coastal protection]] and [[socio-economic]] welfare has driven recent conservation.&lt;ref name="FAO"/&gt; For example, [[Bangladesh]] has undertaken extensive coastal afforesation (mass plantings) projects since 1966, leading to an increase in mangrove area in recent decades;&lt;ref name="FAO"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Saenger N. A. 1993"&gt;Saenger, N. A. 1993. Land from the sea: the mangrove afforestation program of Bangladesh. Ocean &amp; Coastal Management, 20, 23–39&lt;/ref&gt; 2005;.&lt;ref name="Alongi 2002" /&gt; Many nations with mangroves have signed on to the 1971 [[Ramsar Convention]] on wetlands in the last two decades, making a commitment to [[wetland]] preservation.&lt;ref name="Ramsar 1971"&gt;Ramsar. 1971. Ramsar Convention on Wetlands [Online]. Available: http://www.ramsar.org/cda/en/ramsar-about-about-ramsar/main/ramsar/1-36%5E7687_4000_0__ [Accessed April 2010].&lt;/ref&gt; However, the adoption of protective [[legislation]] is not evenly spread. For instance, community initiatives to protect mangroves are common in Africa but little legislation exists compared to other regions, such as Asia.&lt;ref name="FAO"/&gt;

==Challenges, limitations and future suggestions==
Much attention has been given to mangroves by the [[scientific community]], as well as a largely universal acknowledgement among communities and governments of the ecological and economic values.&lt;ref name="Farnsworth and Ellison 1997"/&gt; Despite this awareness, global mangrove area continues to decline through human activities. A lack of communication between [[biologists]], effected residents, and governments could partly account for this.&lt;ref name="Farnsworth and Ellison 1997"/&gt; Calls have been made for greater [[collaboration]] between international researchers and residents of affected nations.
Efforts to assess changes in worldwide mangrove distribution have been hindered by a lack of long term data, or limited to no data at all for some nations.&lt;ref name="Alongi 2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Farnsworth and Ellison 1997"/&gt; Without accurate data on distributions, an accurate forecast of mangrove loss or expansion becomes problematic. This in turn may hinder the progress of [[Conservation biology|conservation]] projects.
Despite large volumes of [[scientific literature]] on [[mangroves]], many uncertainties still exist. These include how mangroves will respond to increases in greenhouse gases and sea level, [[sustainable]] yields for silviculture, the difference in ecological functioning between tropical and [[temperate]] species, and why within the same species we get seaward and landward expansions.&lt;ref name="Morrisey et al. 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Alongi 2002" /&gt; Obtaining this knowledge will help nations to better predict future mangrove behavior, and administer appropriate [[management]] policies.

==Summary==
Mangrove loss has been a worldwide trend for the last 50 years due primarily to [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] activities that compete for land area. Expansions in mangrove area do occur, but have a limited ability to offset the extensive losses. Recently the rate of loss has been declining due to a greater awareness of mangrove values, with legislation and conservation projects becoming more commonplace. It can only be hoped that this declining rate of loss continues, allowing future generations to appreciate the many benefits of mangroves.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6483">The '''National Driver Register''' (NDR) &lt;ref&gt;http://www.nhtsa.gov/Data/National+Driver+Register+%28NDR%29&lt;/ref&gt; is a computerized [[database]] of information about [[United States]] drivers who have had their [[driver's license]]s [[revoked]] or suspended, or who have been [[convicted]] of serious [[traffic violation]]s, such as [[driving under the influence]] or [[psychoactive drug|drugs]] or [[ethanol|alcohol]]. (see 23 Code of Federal Regulations 1327 Appendix A for a complete list of violations).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/23/part-1327/appendix-A|title=23 CFR Appendix A to Part 1327, Abridged Listing of the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators Violations Exchange Code, Used by the NDR for Recording...License Denials, Withdrawals, and Convictions of Motor Vehicle-Related Offenses|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The records are added and maintained and deleted by the [[motor vehicle agency]] (MVA) of the state that convicted the driver or withdrew the driver's license.&lt;ref&gt;http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=615bc01c8ec9efbce2ccb6f01537ce2b&amp;rgn=div5&amp;view=text&amp;node=23:1.0.3.17.2&amp;idno=23&lt;/ref&gt;

==Checks for problem drivers==
When a person applies for a driver's license, either as a new applicant or as a renewing applicant in a participating state, the state MVA must check if the name is on the NDR's Problem Driver Pointer System (PDPS) (as required by federal regulation—see 23 CFR 1327.5(b)(1)).&lt;ref&gt;http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=23:1.0.3.17.2.0.1.5&amp;idno=23&lt;/ref&gt; If a person has been reported to the NDR by any state as a "problem driver", the prospective licensing state must investigate the driver's history from the state that added the NDR record.  Depending on the results of the investigation and the state's own laws, the prospective licensing state may be required to deny the license. Thus, this "PDPS check" enables the state MVAs to prevent someone with a suspended or revoked driver's license in one state from obtaining a driver's license in another state.  The PDPS check also makes it harder for a person to obtain more than one driver's license at any one time.

Note that not all records on the NDR are correct.  Some may have been added in the past incorrectly for misdemeanor violations, such as not returning [[license plate]]s in New York state.  Some records may identify the wrong driver.  Some records for specific convictions may have met data retention requirements and are eligible for deletion.  A driver must contact the state that added the record to have that state delete an incorrect record. To find out if you have a record on NDR PDPS, see the next section.

Note also that the NDR may not contain all required records. For example, a man in Pennsylvania was convicted of driving under the influence of [[marijuana]] cigarettes and [[crack cocaine]] in 1997, and was never put on the NDR.

==Participation by states==
Currently, and for the past few decades, all U.S. states participate in NDR,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aamva.org/PDPS/|website=AAMVA PDPS}}&lt;/ref&gt; to avoid losing federal funding. Federal Regulation 23 CFR 1327.1 states, "This part provides procedures for States to participate in the National Driver Register (NDR) Problem Driver Pointer System (PDPS) and for other authorized parties to receive information from the NDR. It includes, in accordance with section 204(c) of the NDR Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-364), procedures for a State to notify the Secretary of Transportation of its intention to be bound by the requirements of section 205 of the Act (i.e., requirements for reporting by chief driver licensing officials) and for a State to notify the Secretary in the event it becomes necessary to withdraw from participation. The rule also contains the conditions for becoming a participating State as well as conditions and procedures for other authorized users of the NDR."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roddy|first1=William|title=§1327.1   Scope|url=http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=3d7a2c8f94276a6230d1c0063b8e0497&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se23.1.1327_11&amp;rgn=div8|website=eCFR--Code of Federal Regulations|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|accessdate=23 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Obtaining information from NDR==
The following groups are authorized to receive information from the NDR:

* Individuals requesting their own records under the [[Privacy Act of 1974]]
* State and federal driver's licensing officials
* [[Federal Railroad Administration]] and employers of locomotive operators
* [[Federal Aviation Administration]] for airman medical certification
* [[United States Coast Guard]] for merchant mariner certification
* [[National Transportation Safety Board]] for accident investigations
* [[Federal Highway Administration]] for accident investigations
* Federal agencies performing background investigations for employment
* Current or prospective employers of commercial motor vehicles operators, with permission by the operator
* Air carriers for [[aviator|pilot]] applicants, with permission by the applicant

===Requesting your record===
Under the provisions of the [[Privacy Act of 1974]] and Title 23 § 1327.7, you are entitled to request a file search to see if you have a record on the NDR. As a private citizen, you must send a [[notarized]] letter commonly referred to as a "privacy act request" to the NDR indicating that you would like an NDR file check. There is no charge for this service.

===Identity data sharing===
According to National Drivers Register officials, problem drivers' records posted to the NDR database by the states are made available to all states in the U.S.  Information supplied by one state to the NDR is obtained by another state from the NDR using the first four letters of the driver's first and last names, date of birth, and, often, if it is published, that driver's [[social security number]] and/or license number.

'''Overseas Indonesians''' people of '''[[Indonesian origin]]''' who live outside [[Indonesia]]. This term applies to people of Indonesian birth and descent who are citizens or residents of temporary status.

==History==
Many Indonesians go abroad as students, or labourers (known as "''Tenaga Kerja Indonesia''" or TKI). Most of them settle in [[Malaysia]], [[UAE]], [[South Korea]], [[Japan]], [[Singapore]], [[Netherlands]], [[United States]], and [[Australia]].

==Indonesians Worldwide==

=== Malaysia ===
{{Main|Indonesians in Malaysia}}
Malaysia shares a land border with Indonesia and both countries share many aspects of their culture, including mutually intelligible national languages. Populations have long moved between the areas which make up the modern-day states. Since the distinction between thre two regions emerged in the early 19th century, many people from [[Java]], [[Kalimantan]], [[Sumatra]], and [[Sulawesi]], which are located in modern-day Indonesia, migrated and settled in the [[Malay Peninsula]] and in [[Malaysian Borneo]]. These earlier populations have mostly effectively or partially assimilated with the larger Malaysian-[[Malay people|Malay]] community due to religious, social and cultural similarities. Currently, it is also estimated that there are around 2 million Indonesian citizens in Malaysia at any given time, ranging from all types of background with a significant majority of them consisting of [[Foreign worker|labour migrants]], with a considerable number of professionals and students.

=== Singapore ===
{{Main|Malays in Singapore}}
The Malays in Singapore (Malay: Orang Melayu Singapura) make up about 14% of the country's population. Most of them came from what we know today as  Indonesia and southern Malaysia. In the 19th century, Singapore was part of [[Johor Sultanate|Johor]]-[[Riau Sultanate|Riau]] Sultanate. Many Indonesian people, mainly Bugis and Minangkabau settled in Singapore. From 1886 till 1890, as many as 21,000 Javanese became bonded labourers with the Singapore Chinese Protectorate, an organisation formed by the British in 1877 to monitor the Chinese population. They performed manual labour in the rubber plantations. After their bond ended, they continued to open up the land and stayed on in Johore. Famous Singaporeans of Indonesian descent are the first president of Singapore [[Yusof bin Ishak]], and [[Zubir Said]] who composed the national anthem of Singapore ''[[Majulah Singapura]]''.

According to the Indonesian Embassy in Singapore, as of 2010 there are 180,000 Indonesian citizens in Singapore. As much as 80,000 work as domestic helpers/TKI, 10,000 as sailors, and the rest are either students or professionals. But the number can be higher as registering one's residence is not compulsory for Indonesians, putting the number to around 200,000 people.

=== Netherlands ===
{{further|Indo people}}
Indonesia was a colony of the [[Netherlands]] from 1605 until 1945. In the early 20th century, many Indonesian students studied in the Netherlands. Most of them lived in Leiden and were active in the [[Perhimpoenan Indonesia]] (Indonesian Association). During and after the [[Indonesian National Revolution]], many [[Maluku Islands|Moluccans]] and [[Indo people]], people of mixed Dutch and Indonesian ancestry migrated to the Netherlands. Most of them were ex-KNIL army. In this way around 360,000 Indo people (Indo's)and Totok's (white people) and 12,500 persons from Maluke ancestry were settled in the Netherlands. [[Giovanni van Bronckhorst]], [[Denny Landzaat]], [[Roy Makaay]], [[Mia Audina]], and [[Daniel Sahuleka]] are notable people of Indonesian ancestry from the Netherlands. These 372,500 first generation people and their 2nd, 3rd and 4th generation offspring account for some 1.6 million Dutch passport-holders. This is as much as about 10% of the overall population of the Netherlands.

=== United Kingdom ===

{{main|Indonesians in the United Kingdom}}

=== United States ===
{{Main|Indonesian American}}
In the United States, most Indonesians are students and professionals. [[Boston University]] and [[Harvard University]] are examples of favourite universities for Indonesians. In the Silicon Valley region of Northern California, there are many professional Indonesian-American engineers in the high-tech industry that are employed in companies such as [[Cisco Systems]], [[KLA Tencor]], [[Google]], [[Yahoo]], [[Sun Microsystems]], and [[IBM]]. [[Sehat Sutardja]], CEO of Marvell Technology Group, is one of the successful Indonesian professional in USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|format=PDF|url=http://www.marvell.com/meet_marvell.pdf|title=Meet Marvell|publisher=Forbes Magazine|date=14 August 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061014233458/http://www.marvell.com/meet_marvell.pdf|archivedate=14 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011 the [[Special English]] service of [[Voice of America]] reported on a push for American universities to get more Indonesians to study in America as part of reaching out fast-growing economies like Indonesia in order to compete with students' preferred universities in Australia, Singapore, and Malaysia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Steve|last1=Ember|first2=Sara|last2=Schonhardt|url=http://learningenglish.voanews.com/a/push-to-get-more-indonesians-to-study-in-us-119812454/113786.html|title=A Push to Get More Indonesians to Study in US|publisher=VoA|date=13 April 2011|accessdate=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Saudi Arabia ===
{{Main|Indonesians in Saudi Arabia}}
Indonesian pilgrims have long lived in [[Hejaz]], a region along the west coast of Saudi Arabia. Among them was [[Ahmad Khatib]], who served as the [[Imam]] of the [[Shafi'i]] school of law at the mosque known as [[Masjidil Haram]], [[Mecca]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ricklefs|first=M.C.|title=A History of Modern Indonesia Since c. 1300|agency=Stanford University Press|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Most of Indonesians in Saudi Arabia are female [[domestic worker]]s, with a minority of other types of [[migrant worker|labour migrant]]s and students. Most of the ''santri'' extension studied in Saudi, as well as [[Islamic University]] in [[Madina]]. A number of Indonesian expatriates in Saudi Arabia work in diplomatic sectors or are employees to local or foreign companies located in various province of Saudi Arabia such as [[SABIC]], [[Schlumberger]], [[Halliburton]], or [[Indomie]]. Many of Indonesians are also employees to the world's biggest oil company [[Saudi Aramco]]. Most Indonesians in Saudi Arabia reside in [[Riyadh]], [[Jeddah]], and all around [[Dammam]] area.

=== United Arab Emirates ===

=== Qatar ===
There are about 39,000 Indonesian citizens in the State of Qatar according to the Indonesian Embassy.&lt;ref name="Snojqatar"&gt;{{cite web|last=Snoj |first=Jure |url=http://www.bqdoha.com/2013/12/population-qatar |title=Population of Qatar |publisher=Bqdoha.com |date=18 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131222095738/http://www.bqdoha.com/2013/12/population-qatar |archivedate=22 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australia ===
{{Main|Indonesian Australians}}
Before Dutch and British sailors arrived in Australia, Indonesians from Southern Sulawesi have explored the Australia northern coast. Each year, the Bugis sailors would sail down on the northwestern [[monsoon]] in their wooden [[pinisi]]. They would stay in Australia for several months to trade and take ''tripang'' (or dried [[sea cucumber (food)|sea cucumber]]) before returning to Makassar on the dry season off shore winds. These trading voyages continued until 1907.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}
Nowadays, mostly Indonesian whose reside in Australia are either foreign students or workers, the main ethnic group mostly are the [[Chinese Indonesians|Chinese]] from Indonesia.
Furthermore, the [[Cocos Malays]] are descendants of native Indonesians were brought by the Clunies-Ross family to work in the copra industry in the 19th century.

=== Suriname ===
{{Main|Javanese Surinamese}}
People of Indonesian descent, mainly Javanese, make up 15% of the population of [[Suriname]]. In the 19th century, the Dutch sent the Javanese to Suriname as contract workers in plantations. The most famous person of Indonesian descent is [[Paul Somohardjo]] as the speaker of the [[National Assembly of Suriname]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v3/printable.php?id=156693|title=English Not On Menu For Wednesday's Press Briefing|work=Malaysian National News Agency|date=22 September 2005|accessdate=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Japan ===
{{Main|Indonesians in Japan}}
In 2013 approximately 20,000 Indonesians living in Japan, including about 3,000 illegal Indonesians. These numbers dropped from the previous years because of various reasons, reasons include the high cost of living in Japan and the difficulties to find jobs in Japan. Most of them are in Japan for short term and deportation remains high for Indonesian residents.

=== Hong Kong ===
{{Main|Indonesians in Hong Kong}}
Indonesian are the second largest foreigner group after [[Filipino people|Filipino]], mainly are the female domestic helper from [[Java Island]], there are also several [[Chinese Indonesians]] family and student that reside in Hong Kong.

{{History of Czechoslovakia}}
The '''Prague Spring''' ({{lang-cs|Pražské jaro}}, {{lang-sk|Pražská jar}}) was a period of political [[liberalization]] in [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]] as a [[Communist state]] after [[World War II]]. It began on 5 January 1968, when [[reformist]] [[Alexander Dubček]] was elected [[First Secretary]] of the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]] (KSČ), and continued until 21 August 1968 when the [[Soviet Union]] and other members of the [[Warsaw Pact]] [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|invaded the country]] to suppress the reforms.

The [[Prague]] Spring reforms were a strong attempt by Dubček to grant additional [[rights]] to the citizens of Czechoslovakia in an act of partial [[decentralization of the economy]] and [[democratization]]. The freedoms granted included a loosening of restrictions on the [[freedom of the press|media]], [[freedom of speech|speech]] and [[freedom of movement|travel]]. After national discussion of dividing the country into a [[federation]] of three [[republic]]s, [[Bohemia]], [[Moravia]]-[[Czech Silesia|Silesia]] and [[Slovakia]], Dubček oversaw the decision to split into two, the Czech Socialist Republic and Slovak Socialist Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Czech radio broadcasts 18–20 August 1968&lt;/ref&gt; This dual federation was the only formal change that survived the invasion.

The reforms, especially the decentralization of administrative authority, were not received well by the Soviets, who, after failed negotiations, sent half a million Warsaw Pact troops and tanks to occupy the country. ''[[The New York Times]]'' cited reports of 650,000 men equipped with the most modern and sophisticated weapons in the Soviet military catalogue.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1968/09/02/issue.html New York Times September 2, 1968]&lt;/ref&gt; A large wave of emigration swept the nation. Non-violent resistance was mounted throughout the country, involving attempted [[fraternization]], sabotage of street signs, defiance of curfews, etc. While the Soviet military had predicted that it would take four days to subdue the country, the resistance held out for eight months until it was finally circumvented by diplomatic stratagems (see below). It became a high-profile example of [[civilian-based defense]]; there were sporadic acts of violence and several protest suicides by [[self-immolation]] (the most famous being that of [[Jan Palach]]), but no military resistance. Czechoslovakia remained controlled by the Soviet Union until 1989, when the [[Velvet Revolution]] peacefully ended the communist regime; the last Soviet troops left the country in 1991. 

After the invasion, Czechoslovakia entered a period known as "[[Normalization (Czechoslovakia)|normalization]]": subsequent leaders attempted to restore the political and economic values that had prevailed before Dubček gained control of the KSČ. [[Gustáv Husák]], who replaced Dubček as First Secretary and also became [[president of Czechoslovakia|President]], reversed almost all of the reforms. The Prague Spring inspired music and literature including the work of [[Václav Havel]], [[Karel Husa]], [[Karel Kryl]] and [[Milan Kundera]]'s novel ''[[The Unbearable Lightness of Being]]''.

==Background==
{{Eastern Bloc sidebar}}

The process of [[de-Stalinization]] in [[Czechoslovakia]] had begun under [[Antonín Novotný]] in the late 1950s and early 1960s, but had progressed more slowly than in most other states of the [[Eastern Bloc]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams (1997), p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; Following the lead of [[Nikita Khrushchev]], Novotný proclaimed the completion of socialism, and the [[1960 Constitution of Czechoslovakia|new constitution]]&lt;ref&gt;Williams (1997), p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; accordingly adopted the name [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic]]. The pace of change, however, was sluggish; the rehabilitation of Stalinist-era victims, such as those convicted in the [[Slánský trials]], may have been considered as early as 1963, but did not take place until 1967.&lt;ref&gt;Skilling (1976), p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Czechoslovakia: 1948 - 1968|In the early 1960s]], Czechoslovakia underwent an economic downturn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Photius.com, (info from CIA world Factbook)| url = http://www.photius.com/countries/slovakia/economy/czechoslovakia_economy_economic_policy_and_~777.html| publisher=Photius Coutsoukis| accessdate =20 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] model of industrialization applied poorly to Czechoslovakia. Czechoslovakia was already quite industrialized before World War II and the Soviet model mainly took into account less developed economies. Novotný's attempt at restructuring the economy, the 1965 New Economic Model, spurred increased demand for political reform as well.&lt;ref name="Williams5"&gt;Williams (1997), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

===1967 Writers' Congress===
As the strict regime eased its rules, the Union of Czechoslovak Writers cautiously began to air discontent, and in the union's gazette, ''Literární noviny'', members suggested that literature should be independent of Party doctrine.&lt;ref name="Williams55"/&gt;

In June 1967, a small fraction of the Czech writer's union sympathized with radical socialists, specifically [[Ludvík Vaculík]], [[Milan Kundera]], [[Jan Procházka (writer)|Jan Procházka]], [[Antonín Jaroslav Liehm]], [[Pavel Kohout]] and [[Ivan Klíma]].&lt;ref name="Williams55"/&gt;

A few months later, at a party meeting, it was decided that administrative actions against the writers who openly expressed support of reformation would be taken. Since only a small part of the union held these beliefs, the remaining members were relied upon to discipline their colleagues.&lt;ref name="Williams55"/&gt; Control over ''Literární noviny'' and several other publishing houses was transferred to the Ministry of Culture,&lt;ref name="Williams55"/&gt; and even members of the party who later became major reformers — including Dubček — endorsed these moves.&lt;ref name="Williams55"&gt;Williams (1997), p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dubček's rise to power==
[[File:Dubcek.jpg|thumb|[[Alexander Dubček]]]]

As President Antonín Novotný was losing support, [[Alexander Dubček]], First Secretary of the regional [[Communist Party of Slovakia (1939)|Communist Party of Slovakia]], and economist [[Ota Šik]] challenged him at a meeting of the Central Committee. Novotný then invited the secretary-general of the [[Communist Party of Soviet Union]], [[Leonid Brezhnev]], to [[Prague]] that December, seeking support;&lt;ref&gt;Navrátil (2006), pp. 18–20&lt;/ref&gt; but Brezhnev was surprised at the extent of the opposition to Novotný and thus supported his removal as Czechoslovakia's leader. Dubček replaced Novotný as First Secretary on 5 January 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Navazelskis (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 March 1968, Novotný resigned his presidency and was replaced by [[Ludvík Svoboda]], who later gave consent to the reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Antonin Novotný Biography| url = http://www.hrad.cz/en/president-of-the-cr/former-presidents/antonin-novotny.shtml| publisher=Libri publishing house| accessdate =15 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early signs of change were few. When the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (KSČ) Presidium member [[Josef Smrkovský]] was interviewed in a ''[[Rudé Právo]]'' article, entitled "What Lies Ahead", he insisted that Dubček's appointment at the January Plenum would further the goals of socialism and maintain the working class nature of the Communist Party.&lt;ref&gt;Navrátil (2006), p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literární listy===
However, right after Dubček assumed power, the scholar Eduard Goldstücker became chairman of the ''Union of Czechoslovak Writers'' and thus editor-in-chief of the previously hard-line communist weekly ''Literární noviny'',&lt;ref name="Williams, p. 68"&gt;Williams, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bren, p. 23"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bren|first=Paulina|authorlink=Paulina Bren|title=The Greengrocer and His TV: The Culture of Communism after the 1968 Prague Spring|location=Ithaca, NY|publisher=[[Cornell University Press]]|year=2010|isbn=978-0-8014-4767-9|url={{Google books|id=o2LT7c_Kw80C|page=23|plainurl=yes}}|pages=23ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt; which under Novotny had been filled with party loyalists.&lt;ref name="Bren, p. 23" /&gt; Goldstücker tested the boundaries of Dubček's devotion to freedom of the press when he appeared on a television interview as the new head of the union. On 4 February, in front of the entire nation, he openly criticized Novotny, exposing all of Novotny's previously unreported policies and explaining how they were preventing progress in Czechoslovakia.&lt;ref name="Williams, p. 69"&gt;Williams, p= 69&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the official government statement that allowed for freedom of the press, this was the first trial of whether Dubček was serious about reforms. Goldstücker suffered no repercussions, and Dubček instead began to build a sense of trust among the media, the government, and the citizens.&lt;ref name="Bren, p. 23"/&gt; It was under Goldstücker that the journal's name was changed to Literární listy, and on 29 February 1968, the Writers' Union published the first copy of the censor-free ''Literární listy''.&lt;ref name="Williams, p. 68"/&gt; By August 1968, ''Literární listy'' had a circulation of 300,000, making it the most published periodical in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Holý, Jiří. ''Writers Under Siege: Czech Literature Since 1945''. Sussex: Sussex Academic Press, 2011, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

==Socialism with a human face==
{{main|Socialism with a human face}}
[[File:Main protagonists of Prague spring in 1968.jpg|thumb|Main protagonists of Prague Spring in 1968 (L-R) [[Oldřich Černík]], [[Alexander Dubček]], [[Ludvík Svoboda]] and [[Josef Smrkovský]]]]

On the 20th anniversary of Czechoslovakia's "[[Czechoslovak coup d'état of 1948|Victorious February]]", Dubček delivered a speech explaining the need for change following the triumph of socialism. He emphasized the need to "enforce the leading role of the party more effectively"&lt;ref name="Navratil52"/&gt; and acknowledged that, despite [[Klement Gottwald]]'s urgings for better relations with society, the Party had too often made heavy-handed rulings on trivial issues. Dubček declared the party's mission was "to build an advanced socialist society on sound economic foundations&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;a socialism that corresponds to the historical democratic traditions of Czechoslovakia, in accordance with the experience of other communist parties&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name="Navratil52"&gt;Navrátil (2006), pp. 52–54&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most important steps towards the reform was the reduction and later abolition of the [[censorship]] on 4 March 1968. It was for the first time in Czech history the censorship was abolished and it was also probably the only reform fully implemented, albeit only for a short period. From the instrument of Party's propaganda media quickly became the instrument of criticism of the regime.&lt;ref name="bulletin"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vondrová|first1=Jitka|title=PRAŽSKÉ JARO 1968|url=http://abicko.avcr.cz/2008/4/04/prazske-jaro-1968.html|accessdate=21 March 2018|work=Akademický bulletin|publisher=Akademie věd ČR|date=25 June 2008|language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoppe"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hoppe|first1=Jiří|title=Co je Pražské jaro 1968?|url=https://iforum.cuni.cz/IFORUM-5993.html|accessdate=21 March 2018|work=iForum|publisher=Charles University|date=6 August 2008|language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April, Dubček launched an "[[Action Programme (1968)|Action Programme]]" of liberalizations, which included increasing freedom of the press, freedom of speech, and freedom of movement, with economic emphasis on [[consumer goods]] and the possibility of a multiparty government. The programme was based on the view that "Socialism cannot mean only liberation of the working people from the domination of exploiting class relations, but must make more provisions for a fuller life of the personality than any bourgeois democracy."&lt;ref&gt;Ello (1968), pp. 32, 54&lt;/ref&gt; It would limit the power of the secret police&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Von Geldern | first = James | last2 = Siegelbaum | first2 = Lewis | publisher=Soviethistory.org| title = The Soviet-led Intervention in Czechoslovakia| url = http://soviethistory.org/index.php?action=L2&amp;SubjectID=1968czechoslovakia&amp;Year=1968| accessdate =7 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and provide for the [[Constitutional Law of Federation|federalization]] of the ČSSR into two equal nations.&lt;ref name="Auto"&gt;Hochman, Dubček (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; The programme also covered foreign policy, including both the maintenance of good relations with Western countries and cooperation with the [[Soviet Union]] and other [[Eastern Bloc]] nations.&lt;ref name="Library"&gt;{{Cite news| authors = Dubček, Alexander; Kramer, Mark; Moss, Joy; Tosek, Ruth (translation)| title = Akční program Komunistické strany Československa| work = Action Program| pages = 1–6| language = Czech| publisher = Rudé právo| date = 10 April 1968| url = http://library.thinkquest.org/C001155/documents/doc13.htm| accessdate = 21 February 2008| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080506101804/http://library.thinkquest.org/C001155/documents/doc13.htm| archivedate = 6 May 2008| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It spoke of a ten-year transition through which democratic elections would be made possible and a new form of democratic socialism would replace the status quo.&lt;ref name="Postwar"&gt;Judt (2005), p. 441&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who drafted the Action Programme were careful not to criticize the actions of the post-war Communist regime, only to point out policies that they felt had outlived their usefulness.&lt;ref name="Doc"/&gt; For instance, the immediate post-war situation had required "centralist and directive-administrative methods"&lt;ref name="Doc"/&gt; to fight against the "remnants of the [[bourgeoisie]]."&lt;ref name="Doc"/&gt; Since the "antagonistic classes"&lt;ref name="Doc"/&gt; were said to have been defeated with the achievement of socialism, these methods were no longer necessary. Reform was needed for the Czechoslovak economy to join the "scientific-technical revolution in the world",&lt;ref name="Doc"/&gt; rather than relying on Stalinist-era [[heavy industry]], labour power, and raw materials.&lt;ref name="Doc"&gt;Ello (1968), pp. 7–9, 129–31&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, since internal class conflict had been overcome, workers could now be duly rewarded for their qualifications and technical skills without contravening [[Marxism-Leninism]]. The Programme suggested it was now necessary to ensure important positions were "filled by capable, educated socialist expert cadres" in order to compete with capitalism.&lt;ref name="Doc"/&gt;

Although it was stipulated that reform must proceed under KSČ direction, popular pressure mounted to implement reforms immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Derasadurain| first = Beatrice| title = Prague Spring| url = http://library.thinkquest.org/C001155/noframes/summary_spring.htm| accessdate = 23 January 2008| publisher = thinkquest.org| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071114005849/http://library.thinkquest.org/C001155/noframes/summary_spring.htm| archivedate = 14 November 2007| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radical elements became more vocal: anti-Soviet polemics appeared in the press on 26 June 1968,&lt;ref name="Postwar"/&gt; the [[Czech Social Democratic Party|Social Democrats]] began to form a separate party, and new unaffiliated political clubs were created. Party conservatives urged repressive measures, but Dubček counselled moderation and re-emphasized KSČ leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Kusin (2002), pp. 107–22&lt;/ref&gt; At the Presidium of the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]] in April, Dubček announced a political programme of "[[socialism with a human face]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | publisher=Library of Congress | url = http://www.country-studies.com/czech-republic/the-prague-spring,-1968.html | title = The Prague Spring, 1968 | year = 1985 | accessdate =5 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May, he announced that the Fourteenth Party Congress would convene in an early session on 9 September. The congress would incorporate the Action Programme into the party statutes, draft a federalization law, and elect a new Central Committee.&lt;ref name="Williams 1997, p. 156"&gt;Williams (1997), p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;

Dubček's reforms guaranteed freedom of the press, and political commentary was allowed for the first time in mainstream media.&lt;ref name="KieranPress"&gt;Williams (1997), p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the Prague Spring, Czechoslovak exports were declining in competitiveness, and Dubček's reforms planned to solve these troubles by mixing [[planned economy|planned]] and [[market economy|market economies]]. Within the party, there were varying opinions on how this should proceed; certain economists wished for a more [[mixed economy]] while others wanted the economy to remain mostly planned. Dubček continued to stress the importance of economic reform proceeding under Communist Party rule.&lt;ref&gt;Williams (1997), pp. 18–22&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 June [[Ludvík Vaculík]], a leading author and journalist, published a manifesto titled ''[[The Two Thousand Words]]''. It expressed concern about conservative elements within the KSČ and so-called "foreign" forces. Vaculík called on the people to take the initiative in implementing the reform programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Vaculík| first = Ludvík| date = 27 June 1968| title = Two Thousand Words| publisher=Literární listy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dubček, the party Presidium, the National Front, and the cabinet denounced this manifesto.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Mastalir| first = Linda| title = Ludvík Vaculík: a Czechoslovak man of letters| publisher=Radio Prague| date = 25 July 2006| url = http://www.radio.cz/en/article/81466| accessdate =23 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publications and media===
[[File:1968-Prague Spring.ogv|thumb|''[[Prague]], 1968-08, «Periscope ƒilm»'']]

Dubček's relaxation of censorship ushered in a brief period of freedom of speech and the press.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Tieren. ''The Prague Spring and Its Aftermath: Czechoslovak Politics, 1968–1970.'' Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 1997, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; The first tangible manifestation of this new policy of openness was the production of the previously hard-line communist weekly ''Literarni noviny'', renamed ''Literarni listy''.&lt;ref name="Williams, p. 68"&gt;Williams, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bren, p. 23"/&gt;

Freedom of the press also opened the door for the first honest look at Czechoslovakia's past by Czechoslovakia's people. Many of the investigations centered on the country's history under communism, especially in the instance of the [[Joseph Stalin]]-period.&lt;ref name="Williams, p. 68"/&gt; In another television appearance, Goldstücker presented both doctored and undoctored photographs of former communist leaders who had been purged, imprisoned, or executed and thus erased from communist history.&lt;ref name="Bren, p. 23"/&gt; The Writers' Union also formed a committee in April 1968, headed by the poet [[Jaroslav Seifert]], to investigate the persecution of writers after the [[Czechoslovak coup d'état of 1948|Communist takeover in February 1948]] and rehabilitate the literary figures into the Union, bookstores and libraries, and the literary world.&lt;ref&gt;Golan, Galia. ''Cambridge Russian, Soviet and Post-Soviet Studies. Reform Rule in Czechoslovakia: The Dubček Era, 1968–1969''. Vol. 11. Cambridge, UK: CUP Archive, 1973, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Holy, p. 119"&gt;Holy, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; Discussions on the current state of communism and abstract ideas such as freedom and identity were also becoming more common; soon, non-party publications began appearing, such as the trade union daily ''Prace'' (Labour). This was also helped by the Journalists' Union, which by March 1968 had already persuaded the Central Publication Board, the government censor, to allow editors to receive uncensored subscriptions to foreign papers, allowing for a more international dialogue around the news.&lt;ref&gt;Golan, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

The press, the radio, and the television also contributed to these discussions by hosting meetings where students and young workers could ask questions of writers such as Goldstücker, [[Pavel Kohout]], and Jan Prochazka and political victims such as [[Josef Smrkovský]], Zdenek Hejzlar, and [[Gustav Husak]].&lt;ref name="Williams, p. 69"/&gt; Television also broadcast meetings between former political prisoners and the communist leaders from the secret police or prisons where they were held.&lt;ref name="Bren, p. 23"/&gt; Most importantly, this new freedom of the press and the introduction of television into the lives of everyday Czechoslovak citizens moved the political dialogue from the intellectual to the popular sphere.

== Soviet reaction ==
[[File:Brezhnev 1973.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Leonid Brezhnev]]]]

Initial reaction within the [[Eastern Bloc|Communist Bloc]] was mixed. [[People's Republic of Hungary|Hungary]]'s [[János Kádár]] was highly supportive of Dubček's appointment in January, but [[Leonid Brezhnev]] and others grew concerned about Dubček's reforms, which they feared might weaken the position of the Communist Bloc during the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref&gt;Navrátil (2006), p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="trans"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Document #81: Transcript of Leonid Brezhnev's Telephone Conversation with Alexander Dubček, August&amp;nbsp;13, 1968 | year = 1998 | url = http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/nsa/publications/DOC_readers/psread/doc81.htm | work=The Prague Spring '68 | publisher=The Prague Spring Foundation | accessdate =23 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Navrátil (2006), pp. 172–81&lt;/ref&gt;

At a meeting in [[Dresden]], East Germany on 23 March, leaders of the "Warsaw Five" ([[USSR]], [[Hungary]], [[People's Republic of Poland|Poland]], [[History of Communist Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] and [[East Germany]]) questioned a Czechoslovak delegation over the planned reforms, suggesting any talk of "democratization" was a veiled criticism of other policies.&lt;ref name="NavDresden"&gt;Navrátil (2006), pp. 64–72&lt;/ref&gt; [[Władysław Gomułka]] and János Kádár were less concerned with the reforms themselves than with the growing criticisms levelled by the Czechoslovak media, and worried the situation might be "similar to the prologue of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian counterrevolution]]".&lt;ref name="NavDresden"/&gt; Some of the language in April's KSČ Action Programme may have been chosen to assert that no counterrevolution was planned, but Kieran Williams suggests that Dubček was perhaps surprised at, but not resentful of, Soviet suggestions.&lt;ref&gt;Williams (1997), pp. 10–11&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soviet leadership tried to stop, or limit, the changes in the ČSSR through a series of negotiations. The Soviet Union agreed to bilateral talks with Czechoslovakia in July at [[Čierna nad Tisou]], near the Slovak-Soviet border. At the meeting, from 29 July to 1 August, with attendance of Brezhnev, [[Alexei Kosygin]], [[Nikolai Podgorny]], [[Mikhail Suslov]] and others on the Soviet side and Dubček, Svoboda, [[Oldřich Černík]], Smrkovský and others on the Czechoslovak side, Dubček defended the proposals of the reformist wing of the KSČ while pledging commitment to the Warsaw Pact and [[Comecon]].&lt;ref name="Library"/&gt; The KSČ leadership, however, was divided between vigorous reformers (Josef Smrkovský, Oldřich Černík, and [[František Kriegel]]) who supported Dubček, and conservatives ([[Vasil Biľak]], Drahomír Kolder, and Oldřich Švestka) who adopted an anti-reformist stance.&lt;ref name="Navrátil 2006, pp. 448–79"&gt;Navrátil (2006), pp. 448–79&lt;/ref&gt;

Brezhnev decided on compromise. The KSČ delegates reaffirmed their loyalty to the Warsaw Pact and promised to curb "anti-socialist" tendencies, prevent the revival of the Czechoslovak Social Democratic Party, and control the press more effectively. The Soviets agreed to withdraw their [[military|armed forces]] (still in Czechoslovakia after manoeuvres that June) and permit the 9 September Party Congress.&lt;ref name="Navrátil 2006, pp. 448–79"/&gt;

On 3 August representatives from the "Warsaw Five" and Czechoslovakia met in [[Bratislava]] and signed the [[Bratislava Declaration]]. The declaration affirmed unshakable fidelity to [[Marxism-Leninism]] and [[proletarian internationalism]] and declared an implacable struggle against "bourgeois" ideology and all "anti-socialist" forces.&lt;ref&gt;Navrátil (2006), pp. 326–29&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet Union expressed its intention to intervene in a Warsaw Pact country if a "bourgeois" system—a pluralist system of several political parties representing different factions of the capitalist class—was ever established. After the Bratislava conference, the Soviet Army left Czechoslovak territory but remained along its borders.&lt;ref&gt;Navrátil (2006), pp. 326–27&lt;/ref&gt;

===Invasion===

As these talks proved unsatisfactory, the Soviets began to consider a military alternative. The Soviet Union's policy of compelling the socialist governments of its [[satellite state]]s to subordinate their national interests to those of the "Eastern Bloc" (through military force if needed) became known as the [[Brezhnev Doctrine]].&lt;ref&gt;Chafetz (1993), p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; On the night of 20–21 August 1968, Eastern Bloc armies from four Warsaw Pact countries – the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Poland and Hungary—invaded the ČSSR.&lt;ref&gt;Ouimet (2003), pp. 34–35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Global"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Soviet Invasion of Czechoslovakia | work=Military| date = 27 April 2005| publisher=GlobalSecurity.org| url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/czechoslovakia2.htm| accessdate =19 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

That night, 200,000 troops and 2,000 tanks entered the country.&lt;ref&gt;[[Washington Post]], (Final Edition), 21 August 1968, p. A11&lt;/ref&gt; They first occupied the [[Ruzyně International Airport]], where air deployment of more troops was arranged. The [[Military of the Czech Republic|Czechoslovak forces]] were confined to their barracks, which were surrounded until the threat of a counter-attack was assuaged. By the morning of 21 August Czechoslovakia was occupied.&lt;ref name="Global"/&gt;

Neither Romania nor Albania took part in the invasion.&lt;ref name="Warsaw"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Curtis| first = Glenn E.| title = The Warsaw Pact| url = http://www.shsu.edu/~his_ncp/WarPact.html| publisher = Federal Research Division of the Library of Congress| accessdate = 19 February 2008| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080226153443/http://www.shsu.edu/~his_ncp/WarPact.html| archivedate = 26 February 2008| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soviet command refrained from drawing upon East German troops for fear of reviving memories of the Nazi invasion in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bpb.de/geschichte/deutsche-geschichte/68er-bewegung/52007/prager-fruehling?p=all|title=Der "Prager Frühling"|last=|first=|date=|website=Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the invasion by the Warsaw Pact armies, 72&amp;nbsp;[[Czechs]] and [[Slovaks]] were killed (19 of those in Slovakia), 266 severely wounded and another 436 slightly injured.&lt;ref name="Praguelife"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Springtime for Prague| work=Prague Life| publisher=Lifeboat Limited| url = http://www.prague-life.com/prague/prague-spring| accessdate =30 April 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Williams158"&gt;Williams (1997), p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander Dubček called upon his people not to resist.&lt;ref name="Williams158"/&gt; Nevertheless, there was scattered resistance in the streets. Road signs in towns were removed or painted over—except for those indicating the way to Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;See Paul Chan, "Fearless Symmetry" ''Artforum International'' vol. 45, March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Many small villages renamed themselves "Dubcek" or "Svoboda"; thus, without navigational equipment, the invaders were often confused.&lt;ref name="CivilianResistance"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Civilian Resistance in Czechoslovakia| url = http://www.fragmentsweb.org/TXT2/czechotx.html | publisher=Fragments| accessdate =5 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the night of the invasion the Czechoslovak Presidium declared that Warsaw Pact troops had crossed the border without the knowledge of the ČSSR government, but the [[Central newspapers of the Soviet Union|Soviet Press]] printed an unsigned request – allegedly by Czechoslovak party and state leaders – for "immediate assistance, including assistance with armed forces".&lt;ref name="skilling"&gt;Skilling (1976)&lt;/ref&gt; At the 14th KSČ [[Party Congress]] (conducted secretly, immediately following the intervention), it was emphasized that no member of the leadership had invited the intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Navrátil (2006), p. xviii&lt;/ref&gt; More recent evidence suggests that conservative KSČ members (including Biľak, Švestka, Kolder, Indra, and Kapek) did send a request for intervention to the Soviets.&lt;ref&gt;Fowkes (2000), pp. 64–85&lt;/ref&gt; The invasion was followed by a previously unseen wave of emigration, which was stopped shortly thereafter. An estimated 70,000 fled immediately with an eventual total of some 300,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Čulík| first = Jan | title = Den, kdy tanky zlikvidovaly české sny Pražského jara| url = http://www.britskelisty.cz/9808/19980821h.html| publisher=Britské Listy| accessdate =23 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soviets attributed the invasion to the "Brezhnev Doctrine", which stated that the U.S.S.R. had the right to intervene whenever a country in the Eastern Bloc appeared to be making a shift towards capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;Grenville (2005), p. 780&lt;/ref&gt; There is still some uncertainty, however, as to what provocation, if any, occurred to make the Warsaw Pact armies invade. Preceding the invasion was a rather calm period without any major events taking place in Czechoslovakia.&lt;ref name="Williams 1997, p. 156"/&gt;

=== Reactions to the invasion ===

[[File:Adunare Piaţa Palatului August 1968.jpg|thumb|Romanian Prime Secretary [[Nicolae Ceaușescu|Nicolae Ceauşescu]] gives a speech critical of the invasion, in front of a crowd in Bucharest, 21 August 1968]]

In Czechoslovakia, especially in the week immediately following the invasion, popular opposition was expressed in numerous spontaneous acts of [[nonviolent resistance]].&lt;ref&gt;Windsor, Philip and Adam Roberts. ''Czechoslovakia 1968: Reform, Repression and Resistance''. Chatto &amp; Windus, London, 1969, pp. 97–143.&lt;/ref&gt; Civilians purposely gave wrong directions to invading soldiers, while others identified and followed cars belonging to the [[secret police]].&lt;ref&gt;Keane, John. ''Václav Havel: A Political Tragedy in Six Acts''. Bloomsbury Publishing, 1999, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 January 1969, student [[Jan Palach]] [[Self-immolation|set himself on fire]] in Prague's [[Wenceslas Square]] to protest against the renewed suppression of free speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Jan Palach| url = http://archiv.radio.cz/palach99/eng/aktual3.html| publisher=Radio Prague| accessdate =19 February 2008| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120206211130/http://archiv.radio.cz/palach99/eng/aktual3.html| archivedate = 6 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The generalized resistance caused the Soviet Union to abandon its original plan to oust the First Secretary. Dubček, who had been arrested on the night of 20 August, was taken to Moscow for negotiations. There, he and several other leaders (including all the highest-ranked officials, President Svoboda, Prime Minister Černík and Chairman of the National Assembly Smrkovský) signed the [[Moscow Protocol]], under heavy psychological pressure from Soviet politicians, and it was agreed that Dubček would remain in office and a programme of moderate reform would continue.

[[File:Za vashu i nashu svobodu.jpg|thumb|left|Protest banner in Russian reading "[[For your freedom and ours]]"]]

On 25 August citizens of the Soviet Union who did not approve of the invasion [[1968 Red Square demonstration|protested in Red Square]]; seven protesters opened banners with anti-invasion slogans. The demonstrators were brutally beaten and arrested by security forces, and later punished by a secret tribunal; the protest was dubbed "anti-Soviet" and several people were detained in psychiatric hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;Gorbanevskaya (1972)&lt;/ref&gt;

A more pronounced effect took place in Romania, where [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]], [[General Secretary of the Romanian Communist Party]], already a staunch opponent of Soviet influences and a self-declared Dubček supporter, gave a public speech in [[Bucharest]] on the day of the invasion, depicting Soviet policies in harsh terms.&lt;ref name="Warsaw"/&gt; Albania withdrew from the [[Warsaw Pact]] in opposition, calling the invasion an act of "[[social imperialism]]". In Finland, a country under some Soviet political influence, the occupation caused a major scandal.&lt;ref name="FINB"&gt;Jutikkala, Pirinen (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the [[Italian Communist Party|Italian]] and [[French Communist Party|French]]&lt;ref name="OSA"&gt;{{Cite web | last = Devlin| first = Kevin| publisher=Open Society Archives| title = Western CPs Condemn Invasion, Hail Prague Spring | url = http://osaarchivum.org/files/holdings/300/8/3/text/22-4-11.shtml | accessdate =8 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Communist parties, the majority of the [[Communist Party of Finland]] denounced the occupation. Nonetheless, [[President of Finland|Finnish president]] [[Urho Kekkonen]] was the very first Western politician to officially visit Czechoslovakia after August 1968; he received the highest Czechoslovakian honours from the hands of President [[Ludvík Svoboda]], on 4 October 1969.&lt;ref name="FINB"/&gt; The [[Portuguese Communist Party|Portuguese communist]] secretary-general [[Álvaro Cunhal]] was one of few political leaders from western Europe to have supported the invasion for being [[counter-revolutionary]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrew, Mitrokhin (2005), p. 444&lt;/ref&gt; along with the [[Communist Party of Luxembourg|Luxembourg party]]&lt;ref name="OSA"/&gt; and conservative factions of the [[Greek Communist Party|Greek party]].&lt;ref name="OSA"/&gt;

[[File:Helsinki demonstration against the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968.jpg|thumb|Helsinki demonstration against the invasion of Czechoslovakia]]

Most countries offered only vocal criticism following the invasion. The night of the invasion, Canada, Denmark, France, Paraguay, the United Kingdom and the United States requested a meeting of the [[United Nations Security Council]].&lt;ref name = "franck"&gt;Franck (1985)&lt;/ref&gt; At the meeting, the Czechoslovak ambassador [[Jan Muzik]] denounced the invasion. Soviet ambassador [[Yakov Malik|Jacob Malik]] insisted the Warsaw Pact actions were "fraternal assistance" against "antisocial forces".&lt;ref name = "franck"/&gt; 

One of the nations that most vehemently condemned the invasion was China, which objected furiously to the so-called "Brezhnev doctrine" declaring the Soviet Union alone had the right to determine what nations were properly Communist and could invade those Communist nations whose communism did not meet the Kremlin's approval.&lt;ref&gt;Rea, (1975) p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Mao Zedong saw the Brezhnev doctrine as the ideological basis for a Soviet invasion of China, and launched a massive propaganda campaign condemning the invasion of Czechoslovakia, despite his own earlier opposition to the Prague Spring.&lt;ref&gt;Rea, (1975) p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking at a banquet at the Romanian embassy in Beijing on 23 August 1968, the Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai denounced the Soviet Union for "fascist politics, great power chauvinism, national egoism and social imperialism", going on to compare the invasion of Czechoslovakia to the American war in Vietnam and more pointedly to the policies of Adolf Hitler towards Czechoslovakia in 1938-39.&lt;ref&gt;Rea, (1975) p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Zhou ended his speech with a barely veiled call for the people of Czechoslovakia to wage guerrilla war against the Red Army.&lt;ref&gt;Rea, (1975) p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;            

The next day, several countries suggested a resolution condemning the intervention and calling for immediate withdrawal. Eventually, a vote was taken with ten members supporting the motion; Algeria, India, and Pakistan abstained; the [[USSR]] (with veto power) and Hungary opposed. Canadian delegates immediately introduced another motion asking for a UN representative to travel to Prague and work toward the release of the imprisoned Czechoslovak leaders.&lt;ref name = "franck"/&gt;

By 26 August a new Czechoslovak representative requested the whole issue be removed from the Security Council's agenda. [[Shirley Temple Black]] visited Prague in August 1968 to prepare for becoming the US Ambassador for a free Czechoslovakia. However, after the 21 August invasion she became part of a U.S. Embassy-organized convoy of vehicles that evacuated U.S. citizens from the country.&lt;ref&gt;The Real History of the Cold War: A New Look at the Past By Alan Axelrod&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1989, she returned to Prague as U.S. Ambassador, three months before the [[Velvet Revolution]] that ended 41 years of Communist rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Joseph| first = Lawrence E | title = International; Prague's Spring Into Capitalism| url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CEEDF1338F931A35751C1A966958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=1 | work=The New York Times| date=2 December 1990| accessdate =20 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1969, Dubček was replaced as first secretary by [[Gustáv Husák]], and a period of "[[Normalization (Czechoslovakia)|normalization]]" began.&lt;ref name = "Williams"&gt;Williams (1997), p. xi&lt;/ref&gt; Dubček was expelled from the KSČ and given a job as a forestry official.&lt;ref name="Auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schoolnet"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Alexander Dubcek|url = http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/COLDdubcek.htm |publisher=Spartacus Educational | accessdate =25 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Husák reversed Dubček's reforms, purged the party of its liberal members, and dismissed from public office professional and intellectual elites who openly expressed disagreement with the political transformation.&lt;ref name=Interpolitics&gt;Goertz (1995), pp. 154–57&lt;/ref&gt; Husák worked to reinstate the power of the police and strengthen ties with the rest of the Communist bloc. He also sought to re-[[Planned economy|centralize]] the economy, as a considerable amount of freedom had been granted to industries during the Prague Spring.&lt;ref name="Interpolitics" /&gt; Commentary on politics was forbidden in mainstream media, and political statements by anyone not considered to have "full political trust" were also banned.&lt;ref name="KieranPress"/&gt; The only significant change that survived was the [[federalization]] of the country, which created the [[Czech Socialist Republic]] and the [[Slovak Socialist Republic]] in 1969.
In 1987, the Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] acknowledged that his liberalizing policies of [[glasnost]] and [[perestroika]] owed a great deal to Dubček's "socialism with a human face".&lt;ref&gt;Gorbachev (2003), p. x&lt;/ref&gt; When asked what the difference was between the Prague Spring and Gorbachev's own reforms, a Foreign Ministry spokesman replied, "Nineteen years."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Kaufman| first = Michael T.| url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE5D91F3EF931A25757C0A961948260 | title = Gorbachev Alludes to Czech Invasion|work=The New York Times | date = 12 April 1987| accessdate =4 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dubček lent his support to the [[Velvet Revolution]] of December 1989. After the collapse of the Communist regime that month, Dubček became chairman of the federal assembly under the [[Václav Havel|Havel]] administration.&lt;ref&gt;Cook (2001), pp. 320–21&lt;/ref&gt; He later led the [[Social Democratic Party of Slovakia]], and spoke against the [[dissolution of Czechoslovakia]] prior to his death in November 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/08/world/alexander-dubcek-70-dies-in-prague.html?sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=1 Alexander Dubcek, 70, Dies in Prague (New York Times, 8 November 1992)]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Normalization and censorship ===
The Warsaw Pact invasion included attacks on media establishments, such as [[Radio Prague]] and [[Czechoslovak Television]], almost immediately after the initial tanks rolled into Prague on 21 August 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Bren, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; While both the radio station and the television station managed to hold out for at least enough time for initial broadcasts of the invasion, what the Soviets did not attack by force they attacked by reenacting party censorship. In reaction to the invasion, on 28 August 1968, all Czechoslovak publishers agreed to halt production of newspapers for the day to allow for a "day of reflection" for the editorial staffs.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; Writers and reporters agreed with Dubcek to support a limited reinstitution of the censorship office, as long as the institution was to only last three months.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, by September 1968, the [[Czechoslovak Communist Party]] plenum was held to instate the new censorship law. In the words of the Moscow-approved resolution, "The press, radio, and television are first of all the instruments for carrying into life the policies of the Party and state."&lt;ref&gt;Bren, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

While this was not yet the end of the media's freedom after the Prague Spring, it was the beginning of the end. During November, the Presidium, under Husak, declared that the Czechoslovak press could not make any negative remarks about the Soviet invaders or they would risk violating the agreement they had come to at the end of August. When the weeklies ''Reporter'' and ''Politika'' responded harshly to this threat, even going so far as to not so subtly criticize the Presidium itself in ''Politika'', the government banned ''Reporter'' for a month, suspended ''Politika'' indefinitely, and prohibited any political programs from appearing on the radio or television.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;

The intellectuals were stuck at a bypass; they recognized the government's increasing normalization, but they were unsure whether to trust that the measures were only temporary or demand more. For example, still believing in Dubcek's promises for reform, [[Milan Kundera]] published the article "Cesky udel" (Our Czech Destiny) in ''Literarni listy'' on 19 December.&lt;ref name="Holy, p. 119"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote: "People who today are falling into depression and defeatism, commenting that there are not enough guarantees, that everything could end badly, that we might again end up in a marasmus of censorship and trials, that this or that could happen, are simply weak people, who can live only in illusions of certainty."&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1969, however, the new Soviet-backed Czechoslovakian government instituted full censorship, effectively ending the hopes that normalization would lead back to the freedoms enjoyed during the Prague Spring. A declaration was presented to the Presidium condemning the media as co-conspirators against the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact in their support of Dubcek's liberalization measures. Finally, on 2 April 1969, the government adopted measures "to secure peace and order" through even stricter censorship, forcing the people of Czechoslovakia to wait until the [[Cold War (1985-1991)|thawing of Eastern Europe]] for the return of a free media.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;

Former students from Prague, including [[Constantine Menges]], and Czech [[refugees]] from the crisis, who were able to escape or resettle in Western Countries continued to advocate for [[human rights]], [[religious liberty]], [[freedom of speech]] and [[political asylum]] for Czech [[political prisoners]] and [[dissidents]]. Many raised concerns about the Soviet Union and [[Red Army]]'s continued military occupation of the Czechoslovakia in the 1970s and 1980s, prior to the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] and collapse of [[Communism]] in [[Moscow]] and Eastern Europe.

=== Cultural impact ===
The Prague Spring deepened the disillusionment of many Western leftists with [[Soviet]] views. It contributed to the growth of [[Eurocommunism|Eurocommunist]] ideas in Western communist parties, which sought greater distance from the Soviet Union, and eventually led to the dissolution of many of these groups.&lt;ref&gt;Aspaturian (1980), p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;
A decade later, a period of Chinese political liberalization became known as the [[Beijing Spring]]. It also partly influenced the [[Croatian Spring]] in [[Communist Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref&gt;Despalatović (2000), pp. 91–92&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1993 Czech survey, 60% of those surveyed had a personal memory linked to the Prague Spring while another 30% were familiar with the events in another form.&lt;ref&gt;Williams (1997), p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; The demonstrations and regime changes taking place in North Africa and the Middle East from December 2010 have frequently been referred to as an "[[Arab Spring]]".

The event has been referenced in popular music, including the music of [[Karel Kryl]], [[Luboš Fišer]]'s ''Requiem'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Luboš Fišer| url = http://www.musica.cz/fiser/| date = 5 February 2005| publisher=CZMIC| accessdate =23 January 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071008142700/http://www.musica.cz/fiser/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 8 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Karel Husa]]'s ''[[Music for Prague 1968]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Duffie| first = Bruce| date = 1 December 2001| title = Karel Husa, The Composer in Conversation with Bruce Duffie | url = http://www.bruceduffie.com/husa.html| publisher=New Music Connoisseur Magazine| accessdate =23 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Israeli song "Prague", written by [[Shalom Hanoch]] and performed by [[Arik Einstein]] at the Israel Song Festival of 1969, was a [[lamentation]] on the fate of the city after the Soviet invasion and mentions [[Jan Palach]]'s [[Self-immolation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mooma.mako.co.il/Biography.asp?ArtistId=1124&amp;TextId=982 Biography of Arik Einstein – The Solo Years], Mooma (in Hebrew). Retrieved 15 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
"[[They Can't Stop The Spring]]", a song by Irish journalist and songwriter [[John Waters (columnist)|John Waters]], represented Ireland in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] in 2007. Waters has described it as "a kind of [[Celtis|Celtic]] celebration of the Eastern European revolutions and their eventual outcome", quoting Dubček's alleged comment: "They may crush the flowers, but they can't stop the Spring."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = John Waters, The Events That Transpired it| url = http://www.unison.ie/irish_independent/stories.php3?ca=9&amp;si=1774358&amp;issue_id=15243| work=Spring: The Events that Transpired it| date = 11 February 2007| accessdate =21 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Prague Spring is featured in several works of literature. [[Milan Kundera]] set his novel ''[[The Unbearable Lightness of Being]]'' during the Prague Spring. It follows the repercussions of increased Soviet presence and the dictatorial police control of the population.&lt;ref&gt;Kundera (1999), p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; A [[The Unbearable Lightness of Being (film)|film version]] was released in 1988. ''[[The Liberators (Suvorov)|The Liberators]]'', by [[Viktor Suvorov]], is an eyewitness description of the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia, from the point of view of a Soviet tank commander.&lt;ref&gt;Suvorov (1983), p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Rock 'n' Roll (play)|Rock 'n' Roll]]'', a play by award-winning Czech-born English playwright [[Tom Stoppard]], references the Prague Spring, as well as the 1989 [[Velvet Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mastalir|first=Linda|date=28 June 2006|title=Tom Stoppard's "Rock 'n' Roll"|url=http://www.radio.cz/en/article/80581|publisher=Radio Prague|accessdate=23 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heda Margolius Kovály]] also ends her memoir ''Under a Cruel Star'' with a first hand account of the Prague Spring and the subsequent invasion, and her reflections upon these events.&lt;ref&gt;Margolius-Kovály (1986), pp. 178–92.&lt;/ref&gt;

In film there has been an adaptation of [[The Unbearable Lightness of Being (film)|''The Unbearable Lightness of Being'']], and also the movie ''[[Pelíšky]]'' from director [[Jan Hřebejk]] and screenwriter Petr Jarchovský, which depicts the events of the Prague Spring and ends with the invasion by the Soviet Union and their allies.&lt;ref name="Film"/&gt; The Czech musical film, ''[[Rebelové]]'' from [[Filip Renč]], also depicts the events, the invasion and subsequent wave of emigration.&lt;ref name="Film"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Čulík| first = Jan| title = The Prague Spring as reflected in Czech postcommunist cinema| url = http://www.blisty.cz/2008/4/11/art40074.html| publisher = Britské Listy| date = 11 April 2008| accessdate = 16 April 2008| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080412132303/http://www.blisty.cz/2008/4/11/art40074.html| archivedate = 12 April 2008| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number ''68'' has become iconic in the former [[Czechoslovakia]]. [[ice hockey|Hockey]] player [[Jaromír Jágr]], whose grandfather died in prison during the rebellion, wears the number because of the importance of the year in Czechoslovak history.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison (2006), pp. 158–59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Legends of Hockey, Jaromír Jágr| url = http://www.legendsofhockey.net:8080/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SearchPlayer.jsp?player=10703| publisher = Hockey Hall of Fame and Museum| accessdate = 23 January 2008| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071112235512/http://www.legendsofhockey.net:8080/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SearchPlayer.jsp?player=10703| archivedate = 12 November 2007| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A former publishing house based in [[Toronto]], [[68 Publishers]], that published books by exiled Czech and Slovak authors, took its name from the event.

== Anarchist Analysis ==
[[Anarchism|Anarchist]] [[Colin Ward]] argues that a significantly anarchist street culture developed during the Prague Spring as citizens became increasingly defiant of government authorities and began to occupy workplaces while creating [[Mutual aid (organization theory)|mutual aid]] networks between telephone workers, truck drivers and university students. Furthermore, during the Soviet invasion, anarchists took to the streets and battled tanks and soldiers with rocks, molotov cocktails and improvised weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anarchy in Action|last=Ward|first=Colin|publisher=|year=1973|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Languages of Pakistan}}
{{Culture of Pakistan}}
The '''provincial languages of Pakistan''' are a set of languages that are spoken and used in the four[[Provinces of Pakistan]] ([[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], [[Sindh]], [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]], and [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]]). However, provincial languages have no official status in Pakistan, except [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]] in Sindh,{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} given the fact that [[Urdu]] and [[Pakistani English|English]] are the official languages of the country. Shown below are the main languages of each the provinces:

* [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]]: The languages of the province of Punjab are [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Punjab (Pakistan)|English, Urdu  and Saraiki]]. Punjabi is the most common spoken language in Pakistan, with the fact that 44% of the people of Pakistan speak [[Punjabi Language|Punjabi]] as either their first or second language and for some as their third language. [[Lahore]], the capital of the Punjab Province of Pakistan, is the largest Punjabi-speaking city in the world. According to the 1998 Census, 87% of the total population of Lahore speaks a dialect of Punjabi and 68% of the population of [[Islamabad]], the capital of Pakistan, speaks Punjabi.
* [[Sindh]]: The provincial language spoken in the province of Sindh is [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]].  Sindhi is the third most common language spoken in Pakistan (after [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] and [[Pashto language|Pashto]]) and is the only regional.  This language is used and spoken mostly by the [[Sindhi people|Sindhis]], along with several other languages indigenous to Sindh such as [[lasi]], [[Kutchi language|Kutchi]], [[Thari]] and Sindhi [[Saraiki language|Saraiki]].
* [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]]: [[Balochi language|Balochi]], Urdu, Pashto, and Brahui are the provincial language of Balochistan.  It is the main language spoken in Balochistan, apart from [[Brahui language|Brahui]], [[Hazaragi language|Hazaragi]], and the Balochi dialects of [[Pushto]].
* [[Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa]]: The provincial language of Khyber-Pukhtunkhwa is [[Pashto language|Pashto]], and English. This language is also spoken widely in adjacent regions of [[Afghanistan]] which borders the province. Other languages of the province include [[Chitrali language|Chitrali]], [[Kohistani language|Kohistani]], Urdu and [[Hindko]].
* [[Gilgit–Baltistan]]: The provincial language of Gilgit–Baltistan is [[Urdu language|Urdu]]. [[Shina language|Shina]],Brushaki, Wakhi, Khawar. Domaki [[Balti dialect|Balti]] are also widely spoken. Other minor languages includes [[Pashto]] (in western districts of Gilgit Baltistan i.e Ghizer and Daimere).
* [[Azad Kashmir]]: The official language of Azad Kashmir is [[Urdu language|Urdu]]. [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]], [[Shina language|Shina]] and [[Balti dialect|Balti]] are also spoken, Pothohari or Mirpuri are also spoken in this area.

Urdu is spoken and understood by nearly all Pakistanis, as it is the national language and is officially used in formal governmental, educational purposes, etc. It is the symbol of muslim identity and unity.

'''''Roto''''', f. '''''rota''''', (literally "broken") is a term used to refer to Chilean people and in particular to the common Chilean. In [[Chile]] from the start of the 20th century it was applied with a negative [[classism|classist]] connotation to poor city-dwellers. It is also used contemptuously in other Spanish-speaking countries, especially [[Bolivia]]&lt;!---BROKEN LINK---&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.batallas.org/viewtopic.php?p=158950&amp;sid=c490b82637a239cfcdcd6a52ee9f9b64|title=Los Colorados de Bolivia en la Guerra del Pacífico|accessdate=|format=PHP|author=|date=|publisher=www.batallas.org}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Peru]], to refer to Chileans in a derogatory manner. Otherwise, despite its defects, the roto is also considered a figure of national identity and pride in Chile.

==Historical usage==
The term ''roto'' has been used in [[Peru]] since the times of the [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire|Spanish conquest]], when [[Diego de Almagro]]'s disappointed troops returned to [[Cusco|Cuzco]] (after a failed gold-seeking expedition in Chile) with their torn clothes, due to the extensive and laborious passage on foot through the [[Atacama desert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://diario.elmercurio.com/detalle/index.asp?id={ff7d780d-671b-41f1-8ab2-a07c851aaa16} |title=Roto chileno |accessdate=2 August 2013 |format=ASP |author=Cañas Palacios, Gastón |date=20 September 2010 |publisher=diario.elmercurio.com |quote= |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Larraín Valdés, Gerardo |title=Diego de Almagro |url= |format= |year=2001 |origyear=1996 |editor= |publisher=Luxemburgo |isbn=956-272-488-3 |language=Spanish |quote=[...] los [españoles que volvieron] de Chile estaban en tan pobres condiciones, ya que nadie les daba trabajo ni posibilidades de desenvolverse en alguna actividad, que por sus ropas harapientas los llamaban los '''rotos''' chilenos.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This term became more used after the [[War of the Confederation|Chilean campaigns against the Peru-Bolivian Confederation]] in 1839 —Chilean troops defeated the confederation at the [[Battle of Yungay]] on 20 January 1839.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.academiahistoriamilitar.cl/?do=noticias.verDetalle&amp;id=86 |title=Batalla de Yungay y conmemoración del roto chileno – Yungay y el roto chileno: El proceso de consolidación de la nacionalidad |accessdate=15 October 2012 |author=López Ardiles, Marcos |date=17 January 2012 |publisher=www.academiahistoriamilitar.cl |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Chile tributes were paid to the victors of Yungay and, in a gesture of recognition, 20 January was declared the [[:es:Día del Roto Chileno|''Día del Roto Chileno'']] (in Spanish; ''Day of the Chilean Roto'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.feriadoschilenos.cl/DiasNacionales.html#DiaDelRotoChileno |title=Días nacionales en Chile: Otros días en que se observan celebraciones |accessdate=17 March 2013 |author=Farah, Miguel |date=14 March 2013 |publisher=www.feriadoschilenos.cl |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;— and the [[War of the Pacific]] (1879–84).

The figure of the ''Chilean Roto'' is commemorated by very diverse organisations and actors such as the [[Chilean Army]], ultra-nationalist activists, the Communist Party and local organisations of ordinary citizens. The Army has a particular appreciation to the figure which was regarded as the main hero –a collective and anonymous hero- of some of the most crucial battles in the war against Bolivia and Peru.
In this context, the webpage of the Chilean Army states:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ejercito.cl/historia/hisp-ind.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071005011805/http://www.ejercito.cl/historia/hisp-ind.htm |date=5 October 2007 }}; 15 December 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The patriotism, bravery and heroism was embodied in the Chilean roto, who represents the ordinary man that left all to fight for its country. This was the one who fought in Yungay and characterised himself by his fierceness and determination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oresteplath.cl/antologia/origen-roto.html ''Epopeya del “roto” chileno''], by  Oreste Plath.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0718-23762010000100009&amp;lng=es&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=es ''Exaltación del mestizo: la invención del roto chileno''], by Horacio Gutiérrez.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Salvadoran Lenca''' was spoken in [[Chilanga, El Salvador|Chilanga]] and [[Potó]]. Lencans had arrived in El Salvador about 2,000 years B.P. and founded the site of [[Quelepa]].  One speaker remains in Poto.

Salvadoran Lenca is of the small language family of [[ Lencan languages]] that consists of two languages one of which is the Salvadoran Lenca and the Honduran Lenca, both which are now extinct. There have been attempt to link the Lencan language to other languages within their groupings but there has been no success. &lt;ref&gt; Campbell, Lyle. ''Glossary of Historical Linguistics''.

== Lenca Potón ==
As of 2012, Mario Salvador Hernández of [[Guatajiagua]] is the last speaker of Lenca Potón, which differs from the version spoken in Chilanga, where the language has disappeared. Research in 2004 by the [[University of Central America]] recorded 380 words, five vowels and 16 consonants, alternation between “g” and “k”, with reduplication to create plurals from singular forms.&lt;ref name=poton&gt;{{Cite news

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15195">In [[cognitive psychology]], '''sequence learning''' is inherent to human ability because it is an integrated part of conscious and nonconscious learning as well as activities. Sequences of information or sequences of actions are used in various everyday tasks: "from sequencing sounds in speech, to sequencing movements in typing or playing instruments, to sequencing actions in driving an automobile."&lt;ref name="Clegg"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clegg|first=Benjamin A|author2=DiGirolamo, Gregory J |author3=Keele, Steven W |title=Sequence learning|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date=August 1998|volume=2|issue=8|pages=275&amp;ndash;81|doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(98)01202-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sequence learning can be used to study skill acquisition and in studies of various groups ranging from neuropsychological patients to infants.&lt;ref name="Clegg" /&gt; According to Ritter and Nerb, “The order in which material is presented can strongly influence what is learned, how fast performance increases, and sometimes even whether the material is learned at all.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Frank E. Ritter|title=In order to learn: how the sequence of topics influences learning|series=Oxford series on cognitive models and architectures|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford/New York|isbn=978-0-19-517884-5|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sequence learning, more known and understood as a form of explicit learning, is now also being studied as a form of [[implicit learning]] as well as other forms of learning. Sequence learning can also be referred to as sequential behavior, behavior sequencing, and serial order in behavior.

==History==
In the first half of the 20th century, [[Margaret Floy Washburn]], [[John B. Watson]], and other [[behaviorists]] believed behavioral sequencing to be governed by the reflex chain, which states that stimulation caused by an initial movement triggers an additional movement, which triggers another additional movement, and so on. In 1951, [[Karl Lashley]], a [[neurophysiologist]] at [[Harvard University]], published “The Problem of Serial Order in Behavior,” addressing the current beliefs about sequence learning and introducing his hypothesis. He criticized the previous view on the basis of six lines of evidence: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The first line is that movements can occur even when [[sensory feedback]] is interrupted. The second is that some movement sequences occur too quickly for elements of the sequences to be triggered by feedback from the preceding elements. Next is that the errors in behavior suggest internal plans for what will be done later. Also, the time to initiate a movement sequence can increase with the length or complexity of the sequence. The next line is the properties of movements occurring early in a sequence can anticipate later features. Then lastly the neural activity can indicate preparation of upcoming behavior events, including upcoming behavior events in the relatively long-term future.&lt;ref name="Rosenbaum"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosenbaum|first=David|author2=Rajal G. Cohen |author3=Steven A. Jax |author4=Daniel J. Weiss |author5=Robrecht van der Wel |title=The problem of serial order in behavior: Lashley’s legacy|journal=Human Movement Science|year=2007|volume=26|issue=4|pages=525&amp;ndash;54|doi=10.1016/j.humov.2007.04.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lashley argued that sequence learning, or behavioral sequencing or serial order in behavior, is not attributable to sensory feedback. Rather, he proposed that there are plans for behavior since the nervous system prepares for some behaviors but not others. He said that there was a [[hierarchical organization]] of plans. He came up with several lines of evidence. The first of these is that the context changes functional interpretations of the same behaviors, such as the way “wright, right, right, rite, and write” are interpreted based on the context of the sentence. “Right” can be interpreted as a direction or as something good depending on the context. A second line of evidence says that errors are involved in human behavior as hierarchical organization. In addition, “hierarchical organization of plans comes from the timing of behavioral sequences.” The larger the phrase, the longer the response time, which factors into “decoding” or “unpacking” hierarchical plans. Additional evidence is how easy or hard it is to learn a sequence. The mind can create a “memory for what is about to happen” as well as a “memory for what has happened.” The final evidence for the hierarchical organization of plans is characterized by [[chunking (psychology)|"chunking"]]. This skill combines multiple units into larger units.&lt;ref name= "Rosenbaum" /&gt;

==Types of sequence learning==
There are two broad categories of sequence learning&amp;mdash;explicit and implicit&amp;mdash;with subcategories. Explicit sequence learning has been known and studied since the discovery of sequence learning. However, recently, implicit sequence learning has gained more attention and research. A form of [[implicit learning]], implicit sequence learning refers to the underlying methods of learning that people are unaware of&amp;mdash;in other words, learning without knowing. The exact properties and number of mechanisms of implicit learning are debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lin|first=Hsiang-Ling Jennifer|title=Implicit sequence learning: One or two learning mechanisms?|type=MA thesis|year=1994|publisher=University of Missouri|location=Columbia, Missouri|oclc=	36106139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other forms of implicit sequence learning include motor sequence learning, temporal sequence learning, and [[Associative Sequence Learning|associative sequence learning]].

==Sequence learning problems==
Sequence learning problems are used to better understand the different types of sequence learning. There are four basic sequence learning problems: sequence prediction, sequence generation, sequence recognition, and sequential decision making. These “problems” show how sequences are formulated. They show the patterns sequences follow and how these different sequence learning problems are related to each other.

Sequence prediction attempts to predict the next immediate element of a sequence based on all the preceding elements. Sequence generation is basically the same as sequence prediction: an attempt to piece together a sequence one by one the way it naturally occurs. Sequence recognition takes certain criteria and determines whether the sequence is legitimate. Sequential decision making or sequence generation through actions breaks down into three variations: goal-oriented, trajectory-oriented, and reinforcement-maximizing. These three variations all want to pick the action(s) or step(s) that will lead to the goal in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sun|first=Ron|title=Introduction to Sequence Learning|url=http://www.cogsci.rpi.edu/~rsun/sun.seq-intro.ps|accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These sequence learning problems reflect hierarchical organization of plans because each element in the sequences builds on the previous elements.

In a classic experiment published in 1967, [[Alfred L. Yarbus]] demonstrated that though subjects viewing portraits reported apprehending the portrait as a whole, their eye movements successively fixated on the most informative parts of the image. These observations suggest that underlying an apparently parallel process of face perception, a serial [[oculomotor]] process is concealed.&lt;ref&gt;Yarbus, Alfred L., "Eye movements during perception of complex objects", Yarbus, Alfred L., tr. Basil Haigh, ed. Lorrin A. Riggs, ''Eye Movements and Vision'', New York: Plenum, 1967, OCLC 220267263, ch. 7, pp. 171&amp;ndash;96.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a common observation that when a [[skill]] is being acquired, we are more attentive in the initial phase, but after repeated practice, the skill becomes nearly automatic;&lt;ref&gt;Fitts, P. M., "Perceptual motor skill learning", in Arthur W. Melton (ed.), ''Categories of Human Learning'', New York: Academic Press, 1964, OCLC 180195, pp. 243&amp;ndash;85.&lt;/ref&gt; this is also known as [[unconscious competence]]. We can then concentrate on learning a new action while performing previously learned actions skillfully. Thus, it appears that a neural code or representation for the learned skill is created in our brain, which is usually called [[procedural memory]]. The procedural memory encodes procedures or algorithms rather than facts.

==Ongoing research==
There are many other areas of application for sequence learning. How humans learn sequential procedures has been a long-standing research problem in [[cognitive science]] and currently is a major topic in [[neuroscience]]. Research work has been going on in several disciplines, including [[artificial intelligence]], [[neural networks]], and engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sun|first=Ron|author2=C.

The '''Temuan people''' ([[Temuan language|Temuan]]: ''Uwang/Eang Temuan'', [[Malaysian language|Malaysian]]: ''Orang Temuan'') are a [[Proto-Malay]] ethnic group indigenous to western parts of [[Peninsular Malaysia]]. They can be found in the states of [[Selangor]], [[Pahang]], [[Johor]], [[Negeri Sembilan]] and [[Malacca]]. The Temuans are classified as part of [[Orang Asli]] group according to the Malaysian government. They are also one of the largest (numbering to almost 30,000 people) and the most widespread of the Orang Asli ethnic groups.

They speak [[Temuan language|Temuan]], an [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian language]] closely related to [[Malay language|Malay]]. Like other indigenous tribes in Malaysia, most Temuans live in poverty.

==Flood legend==
[[File:Mamak and Inak Bungsuk.jpg|thumb|right|An illustration of Mamak and Inak Bungsuk the founding father and mother of the Temuan people.]]
Thousands of years ago, many Temuan people died because they had committed ''"Celau"'' (the sins that angered god and their ancestors; as it is also called ''Talan'' in [[Semaq Beri language]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Malaya. Museums Department, Malaysia. Jabatan Muzium|title=Federation Museums Journal, Volumes 16-23|year=1971|publisher=Museums Department, States of Malaya|isbn=|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Their god has sent a ''"Celau"'' punishment in a form of a great flood which had drowned all the Temuan sinners that day. Only two of the Temuans, named ''Mamak'' and ''Inak Bungsuk'' survived that day by climbing at Eaglewood tree at ''Gunung Raja'' (Royal Mountain) located at the border of Selangor and Pahang state. There was a Temuan village over there named Kampung Orang Asli Pertak. ''Mamak'' and ''Inak Bungsuk'' survived because they had an enchanting mantra or spell to ease down the ''"Celau"'' storm.&lt;ref name="KLT"&gt;{{cite book|author=Man Ess|title=Kisah Lagenda Temuan: Wak Beull dengan Mamak Bungsuk|year=2014|publisher=Blue Crystal Enterprise|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gunung Gajak'' (Gunung Rajah, Pahang, Malaysia) became the birth places and ancestral home of the Temuan tribe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.magickriver.net/akarumbi.htm |title=Akar Umbi |publisher=Magic River |accessdate=2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Mamak Bungsuk'' (Adam) and ''Inak Bungsuk'' (Eve) are the Temuan analogues of Adam and Eve in the myth of the birth of humanity.

==Language==
The Temuans have their own language called the [[Temuan language]] or ''Bahasak Temuan''. It is distinct but closely related to the Malay language spoken by their Malay neighbours. The Temuan language is a [[Malayan languages|Malayan language]] spoken by the majority of the Temuan people. It is essentially a spoken language with several dialectal variation. Temuan is divided into two major dialects namely ''Belandas'' and ''Mantra'' which differs mostly in terms of phonology and also some of the vocabulary but still mutually intelligible to one another. Temuan is mostly written in the Latin alphabet although no standard orthography has been made.

===Comparison between Belandas and Mantra dialects===
Example of Temuan Belandas dialect: ''diak'' (he/she), ''hajak'' (only), ''kitak'' (we), ''tai'' (the end of sentence particle).

Example of Temuan Mantra dialect: ''dien'' (he/she), ''hajen'' (only), ''kiten'' (we), ''tea'' (the end of sentence particle).

==Religion==
[[File:Temuan legend.jpg|thumb|right|The Temuan people believe that every places, rivers and oceans in this word has its guardian.]]
A basic traditional Temuan belief is that their God and ancestors are always present with them, guarding their safety.

At the end of every year, the Temuans celebrate ''Aik Gayak Muyang'' (Ancestor Day in English). This celebration is to thank their God and ancestors for the crops they grow and for the peaceful life they have had.&lt;ref name="HODOFFIHIF"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.malaysiakini.com/letters/339535 |title=How our dependency on fossil fuel is harming indigenous folk |author=Fatimah Zainal |publisher=Malaysia Kini |date=28 April 2016 |accessdate=2016-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Temuans believe they were placed on the earth (''Tanah Tujuh'') by ''Muyang'' (God) to be guardians of the [[rain forest]] and that if they fail in their sacred duty, the whole world will turn upside down and humanity will perish.&lt;ref name="KLT"/&gt; Each river, hill, stream, rock, tree and shrub is animated by a guardian spirit. Rivers are guarded by dragons (''naga'') and snakes (''ular'') which often cause mayhem if their homes are desecrated.

The Temuan’s culture reflects their belief in these nature spirits. Their [[animism]] takes the form of [[taboo]]s, herbal remedies, ritual ceremonies and magic. They have ''dukun'' (healers) and a village ''bomoh'' ([[shaman]]) who, when in a [[trance]] state, communicates with the nature spirits. It is the shaman who leads the tribe in the annual ''sawai'' or ''sewang'' - an ancient earth healing ritual to honour their ancestors and appease the guardian spirits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aliran.com/archives/monthly/2005a/5g.html |title=Akar Umbi: Songs of the Dragon, indigenous identity and Temuan rights to the Forest |author=Tan Sooi Beng |publisher=Aliran Monthly |date=2005 |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although today the Temuans mostly adhere to their animistic beliefs, the rest have now largely converted to either [[Christianity]] or [[Islam]].&lt;ref name="ETTEAAAIAIKD"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journal-archieves18.webs.com/421-433.pdf |title=Enhancing Temuan Tribe Economic Activities As An Indigenous Attraction In Kampung Dengkil, Mukim Sepang, Selangor |author=Haliza Mohd Said, Zainal Abidin Ramli &amp; Sukma Dina Radin |publisher=Interdisciplinary Journal of Contemporary Research in Business |page=425 |date=May 2012 |accessdate=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; This happens especially when Temuans married with people outside of their ethnic groups, whether it's with the [[Malaysian Malay|Malays]], [[Malaysian Chinese|Chinese]] or other [[Demographics of Malaysia|ethnic groups in the country]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|contribution=Universiti Sains Malaysia.

===Customs===
[[File:Documentary of Kg.Bukit Payung (5380516703).jpg|thumb|right|A Temuan child from Kampung Bukit Payung, [[Melaka]].]]
Some traditional superstitions still held by Temuans:
# Respect for their elders ; bad luck is said to strike those who fail in this.
# They do not praise a baby, in the belief that it would make the child sick and die.
# If a Temuan is travelling and a little rain falls, he must slip a leaf into his ear to protect himself on his journey.
# If a Temuan desires something he cannot get, he must say ''pinah hunan'' and put their saliva on his neck, in the belief that failure to do so would result in an accident.
# A Temuan who must leave a meal in a hurry without eating food must ''tempot'' (touch the food to his skin) before leaving, in the belief that failure to do so would result in an accident or death.
# A Temuan must stay quiet during thunderstorm. If he makes noise, the Thunder god will mistake him for a devil and strike him. Temuans believe that a thunder strike occurs when the Thunder god is hunting devils. That is why they must stay quiet; to prevent the Thunder god from striking at them.
# A murderer will be haunted by his victim's ghost.
# Stay away from a place that was haunted, to avoid being disturbed by an evil spirit.

===Hierarchy structure===
# ''Batin'', Temuan leader
# ''Mangku'', Batin Assistant (temporary replacing Batin when the Batin away from the village)
# ''Jenang'', Customary leader
# ''Menteyik'', Batin advisor (Menteyik judgement is not influence by the Batin)
# ''Jekerah'', Jekerah duty to take care of Enekbuah / Mon
# ''Panglimak'', Panglimak is Jekerah vassal
# ''Bidan / Bomoh / Dukun'', Temuan shaman
# ''Enekbuah / Mon'', ordinary Temuan people

===Traditional medicine===
The Temuan people also possess knowledge in traditional medicine. There also those from the city folks who would seek consultation from the [[Orang Asli]] to cure their illness and problems. Among of the illness that the Temuan shaman could cure are such as fever, diarrhea, blood clot, kidney disease and many more by using herbs or animal based medicine. Examples of herbs used:-&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c810/7b0e574dc7195933514e20da3b950f861b0a.pdf |title=Ethno-medicinal Resources Used By the Temuan in Ulu Kuang Village |author=M.

* [[Auricularia auricula-judae]] and [[Termitomyces clypeatus]] for curing fever.
* [[Polyalthia]] bullata for diabetes and to increase libido.
* [[Andrographis paniculata]] for hypertension and diabetes, and its roots for [[hematochezia]].
* [[Parkia speciosa]] for toothache, hypertension and diabetes.

It is also known that the Temuan people themselves have begun to cultivate some of the herbs as an indication of the common health problems faced by them. Examples of such species that have been cultivated by the Temuan people instead of gathering them from the wild are:-&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://repository.um.edu.my/16968/1/EM-05-3-169-11-186-Ong-H-C-Tt.pdf |title=Traditional Medicinal Plants Used by the Temuan Villagers in Kampung Tering, Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia |author=Hean Chooi Ong, Norliah Ahmad &amp; Pozi Milow |publisher=Kamla-Raj, Ethno Med, 5(3) |year=2011 |accessdate=2018-01-02 |page=169-173}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Azadirachta indica]] for measles.
* [[Aloe barbadensis]] for dandruff, hair loss and burns.
* [[Alpinia galanga]] for skin infection.
* [[Cocos nucifera]] for fever and measles.
* [[Curcuma longa]] for acne and pimples.
* [[Hibiscus rosa-sinensis]] for grey hair.
* [[Zingiber officinale]] for fever and [[flatulence]].

The common method of administering the herbs by the Temuan people are by consuming the decoction of the roots orally, such as the [[Polyalthia]] bullata, [[Andrographis paniculata]], [[Parkia speciosa]], [[Zingiber officinale]] and many more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://repository.um.edu.my/20465/1/EM-05-2-095-11-179-Ong-H-C-Tt.pdf |title=Ethno-medicinal Plants Used by the Temuan Villagers in Kampung Jeram Kedah, Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia |author=H.

Some herbs have multiple methods of administering its medicinal properties to treat for different illness. For example, root decoction of [[Alpinia conchigera]] is used as a shampoo to clean fleas on the head, its leaves are used as poultice to treat boils and post-childbirth swelling on the stomach, while its rhizome can be pounded as rubbing for bone ache, and also powdered to be mixed with water as poultice for stomach ache.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pertanika.upm.edu.my/Pertanika%20PAPERS/JTAS%20Vol.%2022%20(2)%20Sep.%201999/05%20PAGE%2085-94.pdf |title=The Use of Medicinal Plant Species by the Temuan Tribe of Ayer Hitam Forest, Selangor, Peninsular Malaysia |author=Faridah Hanum &amp; Nurulhuda Hamzah |publisher=Universiti Putra Malaysia Press, Pertanika J.

'''Tzeni Karezi''' ({{lang-el|Τζένη Καρέζη}}, [[12 January]] [[1932]] - [[27 July]] [[1992]] also known as '''Jenny Karezi''', was a [[Greece|Greek]] film and stage actress.

==Biography==
===Early life===
'''Evgenia Karpouzi''' was born in [[Athens, Greece]], to a [[mathematician]] father and [[high school]] teacher mother. She studied under the direction of the Sisters of St. Joseph at a private [[France|French]] school in [[Thessaloniki]], and later by the same Order in Athens. She learned [[French language|French]] fluently. When she was a [[Teen-agers|teenager]], her father left the family and she continued to live with her mother. Her father died in a car accident in 1971.

In 1951 she was accepted at the Greek National Theater (''Eθνικό Θέατρο''), where she studied in the Drama School. The playwright [[Angelos Terzakis]] and the director [[Dimitris Rontiris]] were among her teachers. Upon graduation, in 1954, she was immediately thrust into starring roles in the theatre, playing alongside actors such as [[Alexis Minotis]] and [[Katina Paxinou]]. {{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

===Career===
Her stage debut was in the [[Marika Kotopouli]] theatre in the French comedy, ''La belle Heléne'', with [[Melina Mercouri]] and [[Vasilis Diamantopoulos]]. In 1955, Karezi made her cinema debut in the [[Alekos Sakellarios]]' comedy, ''Laterna, ftoheia kai filotimo'' in 1955, a massive success just like its sequel, ''Laterna, ftoheia kai garyfallo'' in 1957. For the soundtrack of the 1959 film ''To nisi ton genneon'' she recorded a song by future [[Academy Award]]-winner [[Manos Hadjidakis]], "Min ton rotas ton ourano" ("Do not ask the sky").{{cn|date=August 2016}}

Her career flourished in the 1960s, when she headed her own theater troupe in 1961 and starred in some of the most classic movies of the [[Cinema of Greece|Greek cinema]], like ''Lola'' (1964), ''Mia trelli ... trelli oikogeneia'' (1965), ''Tzeni-Tzeni'' (1966), and ''Kontserto gia polyvola'' (1967). Her greatest film success was ''Ta kokkina fanaria'' (''[[The Red Lanterns]]''; 1963), which was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]]. 

Her last film appearance was in [[Aristophanes]]' ''Lysistrata'' (1972). Over the following decade, she continued to produce and star in such stage classics as ''[[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?]]'', ''[[Medea (play)|Medea]]'' and ''[[Electra (Sophocles)|Electra]]''. She appeared for the last time in theatre in 1990 in [[Loula Anagnostaki]]'s play, ''Diamonds and the blues''; suffering from terminal [[breast cancer]], she was in great pain and had to leave the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=March 21, 2011 |url=http://treepony.com/tzeni-karezi-profile-on-the-greek-actress/ |title=Tzeni Karezi: Profile on the Greek Actress |publisher=Tree Pony |date=2011-03-21 |accessdate=2016-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antiwarsongs.org/do_search.php?idartista=11017&amp;stesso=1&amp;lang=en |title=(AWS) |publisher=Antiwar Songs |date= |accessdate=2016-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal life===
In May 1962 Karezi wed a journalist, Zahos Hadjifotiou, but this marriage ended in divorce two years later. In 1967, during the filming of ''Kontserto gia polyvola'', she met [[Kostas Kazakos]], with whom she had her only child, Konstantinos Kazakos. They formed a popular duo and Karezi's repertoire shifted to more sophisticated and intellectual plays. They were led to prison where they spent several nights due to the play ''To megalo mas tsirko'' (''Our Big Circus'') in 1973, which insulted the [[Greek military junta of 1967-1974|Greek dictatorship]] (1967–74).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic1148082.files/IAKOVOS%20KAMBANELLIS/25.2steen.pdf|format=PDF|title=POroject Muse|website=Isites.harvard.edu|accessdate=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Tzeni Karezi died on 27 July 1992 from cancer at her home and buried at a public expense.{{Clarify|date=January 2014}} She was believed to be 58 years old, although some sources gave her age as 56 or 60. Thousands were present to attend her funeral. 

As a victim of metastatic cancer, she asked those close to her to make [[palliative care]] better known and to assist in its development so others suffering painful diseases or ailments could be able to live through their last days with dignity. After her death, her wish materialized and her family founded the '''Tzeni Karezi Foundation'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldday.dk/168 World Day 2007 - Greece]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, worldday.dk; accessed 6 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15336">'''Unconscious inference''' (German: '''unbewusster Schluss'''), also referred to as '''unconscious conclusion''',&lt;ref&gt;''Unconscious conclusion'' is the term used by [[James P. C. Southall]] in his 1925 English translation of Helmholtz's ''Handbuch der physiologischen Optik'' (''Treatise on Physiological Optics''). Today, the concept is more widely referred to as ''unconscious inference'', notably by [[Edwin Boring|Edwin G. Boring]] in his widely received 'History of Experimental Psychology', and [[Daniel Gilbert (psychologist)|Daniel T. Gilbert]]. Cf. Boring 1950, pp. 309-311.&lt;/ref&gt; is a term of [[perceptual psychology]] coined in 1867 by the German [[physicist]] and [[polymath]] [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] to describe an involuntary, pre-rational and reflex-like mechanism which is part of the formation of visual impressions. While precursory notions have been identified in the writings of [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[Robert Hooke]], and [[Francis North, 1st Baron Guilford|Francis North]]&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Kassler 2004, pp. 125-126.&lt;/ref&gt; (especially in connection with [[Hearing|auditory perception]]) as well as in [[Francis Bacon]]'s ''[[Novum Organum]]'',&lt;ref&gt;"[B]y far the greatest hindrance and aberration of the human understanding proceeds from the dullness, incompetency, and deceptions of the senses; in that things which strike the sense outweigh things which do not immediately strike it, though they be more important" (Bacon 1620, bk. 1, aphorism L, transl.).&lt;/ref&gt; Helmholtz's theory was long ignored or even dismissed by philosophy and psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Boring 1942, p. 289; Gilbert 1989, p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; It has since received new attention from modern research, and the work of recent scholars has approached Helmholtz's view.

In the third and final volume of his ''Handbuch der physiologischen Optik''&lt;ref&gt;Helmholtz 1867.&lt;/ref&gt; (1856–67, translated as ''Treatise on Physiological Optics'' in 1920-25), Helmholtz discussed the psychological effects of [[visual perception]]. His first example is that of the illusion of the sun rotating around the earth:

{{quote|text=Every evening apparently before our eyes the sun goes down behind the stationary horizon, although we are well aware that the sun is fixed and the horizon moves.&lt;ref&gt;Helmholtz 1925, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
==Optical illusions==
[[Image:Müller-Lyer illusion.svg|thumb|Two sets of arrows that exhibit the [[Müller-Lyer illusion]]. The set on the bottom shows that all the shafts of the arrows are of the same length.|200px]]
We are unable to do away with such [[optical illusions]] by convincing ourselves rationally that our eyes have played tricks on us: obstinately and unswervingly, the mechanism follows its own rule and thus wields an imperious mastery over the human mind. While optical illusions are the most obvious instances of unconscious inference, people's perceptions of each other are similarly influenced by such unintended, unconscious conclusions. Helmholtz's second example refers to theatrical performance, arguing that the strong emotional effect of a play results mainly from the viewers' inability to doubt the visual impressions generated by unconscious inference:

{{quote|text=An actor who cleverly portrays an old man is for us an old man there on the stage, so long as we let the immediate impression sway us, and do not forcibly recall that the programme states that the person moving about there is the young actor with whom we are acquainted. We consider him as being angry or in pain according as he shows us one or the other mode of countenance and demeanour. He arouses fright or sympathy in us [...]; and the deep-seated conviction that all this is only show and play does not hinder our emotions at all, provided the actor does not cease to play his part. On the contrary, a fictitious tale of this sort, which we seem to enter into ourselves, grips and tortures us more than a similar true story would do when we read it in a dry documentary report.&lt;ref&gt;Helmholtz 1925, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The mere sight of another person is sufficient to produce an emotional attitude without any reasonable basis whatsoever, yet highly resilient against all rational criticism. Obviously, the [[Impression formation|impression]] is based on the spontaneous, spurious attribution of traits - a process we can hardly avoid, for the human eye, so to speak, is ''incapable of doubt'' and thus cannot ward off the impression.

The formation of visual impressions, Helmholtz realized, is achieved primarily by unconscious judgments, the results of which "can never once be elevated to the plane of conscious judgments" and thus "lack the purifying and scrutinizing work of conscious thinking".&lt;ref&gt;Helmholtz 1925, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of this, the results of unconscious judgments are so impervious to conscious control, so resistant to contradiction that they are "impossible to get rid of"&lt;ref&gt;Helmholtz 1925, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; and "the effect of them cannot be overcome".&lt;ref&gt;Helmholtz 1925, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; So whatever impressions this unconscious inference process leads to, they strike "our consciousness as a foreign and overpowering force of nature".&lt;ref&gt;Helmholtz 1925, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason, Helmholtz suggested, lies in the way visual [[Sense|sensory impressions]] are processed neurologically.&lt;ref&gt;Edgar, Scott (forthcoming). “The Physiology of the Sense Organs and Early Neo-Kantian Conceptions of Objectivity: Helmholtz, Lange, Liebmann,” in Flavia Padovani, Alan Richardson &amp; Jonathan Y. Tsou (eds.), Objectivity in Science: Approaches to Historical Epistemology. Boston Studies in Philosophy and History of Science. Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; The higher [[Cerebral cortex|cortical centres]] responsible for conscious deliberation are not involved in the formation of visual impressions. However, as the process is spontaneous and automatic, we are unable to account for just how we arrived at our judgments. Through our eyes, we necessarily ''perceive things as real'', for the results of the unconscious conclusions are interpretations which "are urged on our [[consciousness]], so to speak, as if an external power had constrained us, over which our will has no control".&lt;ref&gt;Helmholtz 1925, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recognizing these attitude-formation mechanisms underlying the human processing of nonverbal cues, Helmholtz anticipated developments in science by more than a century. As [[Daniel Gilbert (psychologist)|Daniel Gilbert]] has pointed out, "Helmholtz presaged many current thinkers not only by postulating the existence of such [unconscious inferential] operations, but also by describing their general features".&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert 1989, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, he added, it is "probably fair to say that Helmholtz's ideas about the social inference process have exerted no impact whatsoever on social psychology".&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert 1989, p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, psychologists have largely felt that Helmholtz had fallen prey to an error in reasoning. As [[Edwin Boring|Edwin G. Boring]] summed up the debate, "Since an inference is ostensibly a conscious process and can therefore be neither unconscious nor immediate, [Helmholtz's] view was rejected as self-contradictory".&lt;ref&gt;Boring 1942, p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helmholtz himself had justified the use of the term: "The psychic activities that lead us to infer that there in front of us at a certain place there is a certain object of a certain character, are generally not conscious activities, but unconscious ones. In their result they are equivalent to a conclusion [...]. But what seems to differentiate them from a conclusion, in the ordinary sense of that word, is that a conclusion is an act of conscious thought. [...] Still it may be permissible to speak of the psychic acts of ordinary perception as unconscious conclusions, thereby making a distinction of some sort between them and the common so-called conscious conclusions. And while it is true that there has been, and probably always will be, a measure of doubt as to the similarity of the psychic activity in the two cases, there can be no doubt as to the similarity between the results of such unconscious conclusions and those of conscious conclusions" (Helmholtz 1925, p. 4).&lt;/ref&gt; However, several recent authors have since approached Helmholtz's conception under a variety of headings, such as "snap judgments",&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, Hastorf, &amp; Ellsworth 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; "nonconscious social information processing",&lt;ref&gt;Lewicki 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; "spontaneous trait inference",&lt;ref&gt;Newman &amp; Uleman 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; "people as flexible interpreters",&lt;ref&gt;Newman, Moskowitz, &amp; Uleman 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; and "unintended thought".&lt;ref&gt;Uleman  &amp; Bargh 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Siegfried Frey has pointed out the revolutionary quality of Helmholtz's proposition that it is from the perceiver, not the actor, whence springs the meaning-attribution process performed when we interpret a nonverbal stimulus:

{{quote|text=By failing to distinguish appearance from reality, the psychology of expression merely perpetuated a fallacy deeply ingrained in everyday language: with unswerving belief in our perceptions, we routinely call the other person’s expression what is, in plain truth, our own impression of her or him.&lt;ref&gt;Frey 2005, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Influences in current computer science and psychology ==
=== The Helmholtz machine ===
Work in computer science has made use of Helmholtz ideas of unconscious inference by suggesting the cortex contains a generative model of the world. They develop a statistical method for discovering the structure inherent in a set of patterns:
{{quote|text=Following Helmholtz, we view the human perceptual system as a statistical inference engine whose function is to infer the probable causes of sensory input.  We show that a device of this kind can learn how to perform these inferences without requiring a teacher to label each sensory input vector with its underlying causes.&lt;ref name="Dayan"&gt;Dayan, P., Hinton, G. E., &amp; Neal, R. (1995). [http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~dayan/papers/hm95.pdf The Helmholtz machine]. Neural Computation , 7, 889–904.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Free energy principle ===

The [[Free energy principle]] provides an explanation for [[Embodied cognition|embodied perception]] in neuroscience and
tries to explain how biological systems maintain order by restricting themselves to a limited number of states or beliefs about hidden states in their environment. A biological system performs '''active inference''' in sampling action outcomes to maximise the evidence for its model of the world:

{{quote|text=The notion that [[self-organisation|self-organising]] biological systems – like a cell or brain – can be understood as minimising variational free energy is based upon [[Hermann von Helmholtz|Helmholtz]]’s observations on [[unconscious inference]]&lt;ref name="Helmholtz"&gt;Helmholtz, H. (1866/1962). Concerning the perceptions in general. In Treatise on physiological optics (J. Southall, Trans., 3rd ed., Vol. III).

There are an estimated 70,000 '''Uzbeks in Pakistan'''.

'''Vilela''' (''Uakambalelté, Atalalá, Chulupí~Chunupí'')&lt;ref&gt;Not to be confused with [[Nivaclé language|Niwaklé]], which is also called Chulupí~Chunupí.&lt;/ref&gt; is an extinct language last spoken in the [[Resistencia, Chaco|Resistencia]] area of [[Argentina]] and in the eastern [[Gran Chaco|Chaco]] near the [[Paraguayan]] border. Dialects were ''Ocol, Chinipi, Sinipi''; only Ocol survives. The people call themselves ''Waqha-umbaβelte'' 'Waqha speakers'.

The last Vilela people were absorbed into the surrounding [[Toba people]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking townsfolk.

==Phonology==
Vilela appears to have the five vowels of Spanish and approximately the following consonants:

'''Wolaytta'''&lt;ref&gt;Other transliterations include Wolaitta, Wolaita, and Wolayta or Welayta.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[North Omotic languages|North]] [[Omotic languages|Omotic]] language of the [[Ometo languages|Ometo]] group spoken in the [[Wolayita Zone]] and some other parts of the [[Southern Nations, Nationalities, and People's Region]] of [[Ethiopia]]. It is the native language of the [[Welayta people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=wal|title=Wolaytta|website=Ethnologue.com|accessdate=26 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The estimates of the population vary greatly because it is not agreed where the boundaries of the language are.

There are conflicting claims about how widely Wolaytta is spoken.  The Ethnologue identifies one smaller dialect region: Zala. Some hold that [[Melo language|Melo]], [[Oyda language|Oyda]], and [[Gamo-Gofa-Dawro language|Gamo-Gofa-Dawro]] are also dialects, but most authorities, including Ethnologue and ISO 639-3 now list these as separate languages. The different communities of speakers also recognize them as separate languages.&lt;ref&gt;Abebe 2002&lt;/ref&gt; A variety called ''Laha'' is said to be 'close' to Wolaytta in Hayward (1990) but listed as a distinct language by Blench; however, it is not included in ''Ethnologue''.

{{anchor|writing}}Wolaytta has existed in written form since the 1940s, when the [[Sudan Interior Mission]] first devised a system for writing it. The writing system was later revised by a team led by Dr. Bruce Adams. They finished the New Testament in 1981 and the entire Bible in 2002. It was one of the first languages the [[Derg]] selected for their literacy campaign (1979–1991), before any other southern languages. Welaytta pride in their written language led to a fiercely hostile response in 1998 when the Ethiopian government distributed textbooks written in Wegagoda – an artificial language based on amalgamating Wolaytta with several closely related languages. As a result the textbooks in Wegagoda were withdrawn and teachers returned to ones in Wolaytta.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Vaughan, [http://www.ihasa.org/documents/special-reports/ethnicity-in-ethiopia.pdf "Ethnicity and Power in Ethiopia"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813043308/http://www.ihasa.org/documents/special-reports/ethnicity-in-ethiopia.pdf |date=2011-08-13 }} (University of Edinburgh: Ph.D. Thesis, 2003), pp. 250-258&lt;/ref&gt;

In speaking their language, the Wolaytta people use many proverbs. A large collection of them, in Ethiopian script, was published in 1987 ([[Ethiopian calendar]]){{efn-ua|1994/1995 [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calendar-converter.com/ethiopian/|title=Ethiopian – Calendar Converter|website=www.calendar-converter.com|accessdate=26 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} by the Academy of Ethiopian Languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.good-amharic-books.com/onebook.php?bookID=846 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315035156/http://good-amharic-books.com/onebook.php?bookID=846 |archivedate=2013-03-15 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; Fikre Alemayehu's 2012 MA thesis from [[Addis Ababa University]] provides an analysis of Wolaytta proverbs and their functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An analysis of Wolayta proverbs: Function in focus|url=http://etd.aau.edu.et/dspace/bitstream/123456789/4479/1/edited%20theses33.pdf|format=PDF|website=Etd.aau.edu.et|accessdate=2017-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language status==
The language is the official language in the [[Wolayita Zone]] of Ethiopia. The Ethnologue cites statistics that 5% to 25% of the population are literate in this language. Portions of the Bible were produced in 1934, the New Testament in 1981, and the entire Bible in 2002.

==Phonology==
===Consonants===
Wakasa (2008) gives the following consonant phonemes for Wolaytta. Items in {{angle bracket|angle brackets}} show Wakasa's practical alphabet, where this differs from the IPA:

{| class="wikitable"
|+ '''Consonants'''
|-

Two consonants require further discussion.  The sound written {{angle bracket|nh}} is described by Wakasa (2008:44) as a '[[nasalized glottal fricative]]'; it is said to be extremely rare, occurring in only one common noun, an interjection, and two proper names.  The status of the sound written {{angle bracket|D}} is apparently in dispute; Adams (1983:48) and Lamberti and Sottile (1997:23, 25-26) claim that it is implosive, thus presumably {{IPA|[ɗ&amp;thinsp;]}}.  Wakasa (2008:62) denies that this consonant is implosive, and calls it 'glottalized'. (See [[implosive]] for more on such discrepancies.)

===Vowels===

Wolaytta has five vowels, which appear both long and short:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!
![[Front vowel|Front]]
![[Central vowel|Central]]
![[Back vowel|Back]]
|- style="text-align:center;"
![[High vowel|High]]
|{{IPA|i}}, {{IPA|iː}} || || {{IPA|u}}, {{IPA|uː}}
|- style="text-align:center;"
![[Mid vowel|Mid]]
|{{IPA|e}}, {{IPA|eː}}|| || {{IPA|o}}, {{IPA|oː}}
|- style="text-align:center;"
![[Low vowel|Low]]
| || {{IPA|a}}, {{IPA|aː}} ||
|}

==Grammar==

===Word order===
Like other Omotic languages, the Wolaytta language has the basic word order SOV (subject–object–verb), as shown in the following example (Wakasa 2008:1041):

{| class='wikitable'
|na7-ái|| 7iss-í|| maTááp-aa || shamm-íis.
|-
|child-NOM.M.SG. || one-OBL. ||book-ABS.M.SG. ||buy-PF.3M.SG.
|-
|colspan='7'|'The boy bought a book.'
|}

It has postpositional phrases, which precede the verb (Wakasa 2008:1042):

{| class='wikitable'
|ta-7ish-ái|| maTááp-aa|| ba-lágg-iya-ppe||taLL-íis.
|-
|my-brother-NOM.M.SG.|| book-ABS.M.SG. ||his:own-friend-OBL.M.SG.-from||borrow-PF.3M.SG.
|-
|colspan='7'|'My brother borrowed a book from his friend.'
|}

Nouns used adjectivally precede the nouns that they modify (Wakasa 2008:1044)

{| class='wikitable'
|ló77-o ||dé7-uwa|| de7-áis.
|-
|good-OBL || life-ABS.M.SG || live-IMPF.1SG.
|-
|colspan='7'|'I live a good life.'
|}

Numerals precede the nouns that they quantify over (Wakasa 2008:1045)

{| class='wikitable'
|na7-ái|| naa77-ú|| máCC-a|| 7as-atá||be7-íis.
|-
|child-NOM.M.SG|| two-OBL|| female-OBL|| people-ABS.PL||see-PF.3M.SG.
|-
|colspan='7'|'The boy saw two women.'
|}

== Economic participation ==
Economic development has increased opportunities for women to participate in fields such as medicine, both as physicians and nurses; teaching; and administration. By 1989 nearly 10 percent of government employees were women, and the top civil service examination graduate in 1989 was a woman. During their government careers, women civil servants were allowed three months [[maternity leave]] with full pay for three deliveries and leave without pay for any additional deliveries.

Reflecting the dominance of males in society, girls were outnumbered three to two in primary and secondary-level schools. With many pro-women organizations on the rise including CSO, MBO etc. women have been seen to be contributing towards livelihoods of individual families. For instance SABAH-Bhutan tries to empower women in earning through weaving, tailoring food processing and other economic activities, thereby making women participate in earning for the family(s).

==Political participation==
Between 2008 and 2011, recruitment and retention of Tshogpas, or local government council members, remained a serious issue. Obstacles range from lack of interest and lack of economic incentives to difficulty in compliance and obtaining accreditation under existing election laws. The functional literacy and skills test alone left many constituencies without the minimum of two candidates, leading to lengthy delay of the [[Bhutanese local government elections, 2011|local government elections of 2011]], originally slated for 2008.&lt;ref name=UNHCR1/&gt;

The first round of the functional literacy and skills test left many [[Gewog]]s with no representatives, though second round results showed a pass rate over 90%. Although women elected to office remained relatively few (14% before local elections according to the [[UNHCR]]), more than half of voters in initial local government elections were women. In initial local-level voting in 2011, voter turnout was about 50%.&lt;ref name=UNHCR1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/4dcbf522c.html |title=Freedom in the World 2011 - Bhutan |publisher=Freedom House |date=2011-05-12 |work=[[UNHCR]] Refworld online |accessdate=2011-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kuensel1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kuenselonline.com/2010/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=19077 |title=Tshogpa dearth for real |date=2011-04-16 |first=Dechen |last=Tshering |publisher=[[Kuensel]] |accessdate=2011-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BO1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhutanobserver.bt/tshogpas-gone/ |title=Where have the tshogpas gone? |date=2011-05-03 |first=Gyembo |last=Namgyal |publisher=Bhutan Observer online |accessdate=2011-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DWW&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,6411665,00.html |title=Bhutan holds first-ever local government elections |first=Sherpem |last=Sherpa |editor=Baerthlein, Thomas |publisher=Deutsche Welle online |date=2011-01-21 |accessdate=2011-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbs.com.bt/bbs/?p=1334 |title=When the candidates are illiterate |publisher=[[Bhutan Broadcasting Service]] |date=2010-09-28 |accessdate=2011-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has raised the question of whether women would benefit from quotas in public service, highlighting the need to encourage further female electoral and political participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhutanobserver.bt/bhutan-leadership-quotas-women/ |title=Should Bhutan Have Leadership Quotas for Women? |date=2011-08-12 |first=Sonam |last=Pelden |publisher=[[Bhutan Observer]] online |accessdate=2011-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Women in the 1980s played a significant role in the [[agriculture|agricultural]] work force, where they outnumbered men, who were leaving for the service sector and other urban industrial and commercial activities. In the mid-1980s, 95 percent of all Bhutanese women from the ages of fifteen to sixty-four years were involved in agricultural work, compared with only 78 percent of men in the same age range. Foreign observers have noted that women shared equally with men in farm labor. Overall, women were providing more labor than men in all sectors of the economy. Less than 4 percent of the total female work force was unemployed, compared with nearly 10 percent of men who had no occupation.&lt;ref name=CS1&gt;{{Country study|author=Robert L. Worden |country=Bhutan |abbr=bt |section=Role of Women |editor=Andrea Matles Savada |date=September 1991 |pd=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government founded the National Women's Association of Bhutan in 1981 primarily to improve the socioeconomic status of women, particularly those in rural areas. The association, at its inaugural session, declared that it would not push for equal rights for women because the women of Bhutan had already come to "enjoy equal status with men politically, economically, and socially." To give prominence to the association, the Druk Gyalpo's sister, Ashi Sonam Chhoden Wangchuck, was appointed its president. Starting in 1985, the association became a line item in the government budget and was funded at Nu2.4 million in fiscal year 1992. The association has organized annual [[beauty contest]]s featuring traditional arts and culture, fostered training in health and hygiene, distributed yarn and vegetable seeds, and introduced smokeless stoves in villages.&lt;ref name=CS1/&gt;

===Traditional marriage and family life===
The traditional practice, arranged marriages based on family and ethnic ties, had been replaced in the late twentieth century with marriages based on mutual affection. Marriages were usually arranged by the partners in contemporary Bhutan, and the minimum age was sixteen for women and twenty-one for men. The institution of [[child marriage]], once relatively widespread, largely declined as Bhutan modernized, and there were only remnants of the practice in the late twentieth century.&lt;ref name=CS2&gt;{{Country study|author=Robert L. Worden |country=Bhutan |abbr=bt |section=Marriage and Family Life |editor=Andrea Matles Savada |date=September 1991 |pd=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interethnic marriages, once forbidden, were encouraged in the late 1980s by an incentive of a [[Ngultrum|Nu]]10,000 government stipend to willing couples. The stipend was discontinued in 1991. [[Bhutanese Citizenship Act 1985|Marriages of Bhutanese citizens to foreigners]] have been discouraged. Bhutanese with foreign spouses were not allowed to obtain civil service positions and could have their government scholarships cancelled and be required to repay portions already received. Foreign spouses were not entitled to citizenship by right but had to apply for naturalization.&lt;ref name="CS2"/&gt;

[[Polyandry]] is rare and can still be found for instance among the Brokpas of Merak-Sakten.&lt;ref&gt;"Feature: All in the Family", Kuensel 27 August 2007; http://www.kuenselonline.com/feature-all-in-the-family/&lt;/ref&gt; A woman married by custom to several husbands will, however, be granted only one marriage certificate according to law.&lt;ref&gt;The Marriage Act of Bhutan 1980, article KHa 1-17; http://landwise.landesa.org/record/733&lt;/ref&gt; [[Polygamy in Bhutan]] was restricted in the mid-twentieth century. Through the 1990s the law still allowed a man as many as three wives, providing he had the first wife's permission. The first wife also had the power to sue for divorce and alimony if she did not agree. In the 1980s, divorce was common, and newer laws provided better benefits to women seeking alimony.&lt;ref name=CS2/&gt;

Family life, both traditionally and through the end of the 20th century, was likely to provide for a fair amount of self-sufficiency. Families, for example, often made their own clothing, bedding, floor and seat covers, tablecloths, and decorative items for daily and religious use. Wool was the primary material, but domestic silk and imported cotton were also used in weaving colorful cloth, often featuring elaborate geometric, floral, and animal designs. Although weaving was normally done by women of all ages using family-owned looms, monks sometimes did embroidery and [[appliqué]] work. In the twentieth century, weaving was possibly as predominant a feature of daily life as it was at the time of Bhutan's unification in the seventeenth century.&lt;ref name=CS2/&gt;

Landholdings varied depending on the wealth and size of individual families, but most families had as much land as they could farm using traditional techniques. A key element of family life was the availability of labor. Thus, the choice of the home of newlyweds was determined by which parental unit had the greatest need of supplemental labor. If both families had a sufficient supply of labor, then a bride and groom might elect to set up their own home.&lt;&lt;ref name=CS2/&gt;
