[[File:Africa (orthographic projection).svg|thumb|Africa]]
'''African studies''' is the study of [[Africa]], especially the continent's cultures and societies (as opposed to its geology, geography, zoology, etc.). The field includes the study of Africa's [[history of Africa|history]] (Pre-colonial, [[colonisation of Africa|colonial]], [[decolonization of Africa|post-colonial]]), [[demographics of Africa|demography]] ([[ethnic groups in Africa|ethnic groups]]), [[culture of Africa|culture]], [[politics of Africa|politics]], [[economy of Africa|economy]], [[languages of Africa|languages]], and [[religion in Africa|religion]] ([[Islam in Africa|Islam]], [[Christianity in Africa|Christianity]], [[Traditional African religion|traditional religions]]). A specialist in African studies is often referred to as an "Africanist". A key focus of the discipline is to interrogate [[epistemology|epistemological]] approaches, theories and methods in traditional disciplines using a critical lens that inserts African-centred ways of knowing and references.

For Africanists, also known as communitarians, problems within Africa are thought to be caused because the real flesh-and-blood communities that comprise Africa are marginalized from public life as so many "[[tribe]]s". Therefore, the solution is understood to be the need to defend culture and put Africa's age-old communities at the center of African politics. It is also argued that there is a need to "deexoticize" Africa and banalise it, rather than understand Africa as exceptionalized and exoticized.&lt;ref name=Mamdani&gt;Mamdani, M. (1996), Chapter 1 from Mamdani, M., ''Citizen and Subject: contemporary Africa and the legacy of late colonialism''.&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''animal epithet''' is a name used to label a person or group, by association with some perceived quality of an [[animal]]. [[Epithet]]s may be formulated as [[simile]]s, explicitly comparing people with the named animal, or as [[metaphor]]s, directly naming people as animals. Animal epithets may be [[pejorative]], readily giving offence, and they are sometimes used in political campaigns. One English epithet, lamb, is always used positively.

Animal similes and metaphors have been used since classical times, for example by [[Homer]] and [[Virgil]], to heighten effects in literature, and to sum up complex concepts concisely.

Surnames that name animals are found in different countries. They may be [[metonym]]ic, naming a person's profession, generally in the [[Middle Ages]]; [[toponym]]ic, naming the place where a person lived; or [[nickname]]s, comparing the person favourably or otherwise with the named animal.

==History==

[[File:Mnesterophonia Louvre CA7124.jpg|thumb|left|[[Odysseus]], slaughtering Penelope's suitors on his return home at the end of the ''[[Odyssey]]'', is compared by [[Homer]] to a lion.&lt;ref name=Campbell2014/&gt; Bell-[[krater]], c. 330 BC]]

In the cultures of [[ancient Greece]] and [[ancient Rome]], animal stereotypes grew until by the time of [[Virgil]], animal epithets could be applied to anything from an abstract concept like love or fear, to a whole civilisation. An author could use an animal's name to emphasise a theme or to provide an overview of a complex epic tale. For example, [[Homer]] uses animal similes in the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'', where the lion symbolises qualities such as bravery. This leads up to the lion [[simile]] at the end of the ''Odyssey'', where in Book 22 [[Odysseus]] kills all Penelope's suitors. In the ''Iliad'', Homer compares the [[Troy|Trojans]] to [[stridulating]] [[grasshopper]]s, which the classicist Gordon Lindsay Campbell believes to imply that they make a lot of noise but are weaker and less determined than they think. In the ''[[Aeneid]]'', Book 4, Virgil compares the world of [[Dido]], queen of [[Carthage]], with a colony of [[ant]]s. Campbell argues that Dido's people are hardworking, strong, unfailingly loyal, organised, and self-regulating: just the sort of world that the hero Aeneas would like to create. But, Campbell argues, the simile also suggests that Carthage's civilisation is fragile and insignificant, and could readily be destroyed.&lt;ref name=Campbell2014&gt;{{cite book |last=Campbell |first=Gordon Lindsay |title=The Oxford Handbook of Animals in Classical Thought and Life |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_OWkBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT147 |year=2014 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-19-103516-6 |pages=145–147, and passim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Insults==

Animal epithets may be [[pejorative]], indeed in some cultures highly offensive.&lt;ref name="Herzfeld2016"&gt;{{cite book |last=Herzfeld |first=Michael|title=Cultural Intimacy: Social Poetics and the Real Life of States, Societies, and Institutions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-lSpCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA73 |year=2016 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-317-29755-0 |page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Epithets are sometimes used in political campaigns; in 1890, the trades unionist [[Chummy Fleming]] marched with a group of unemployed people through the streets of Melbourne, displaying a banner with the message "Feed on our flesh and blood you capitalist [[hyena]]s: it is your funeral feast".&lt;ref name="Scates1997"&gt;{{cite book |last=Scates |first=Bruce |title=A New Australia: Citizenship, Radicalism and the First Republic |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zkgeEmlRjEgC&amp;pg=PA32 |year=1997 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-57296-5 |page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other side of the ideological divide, the Cuban government described the revolutionary [[Che Guevara]] as a "communist [[rat]]" in 1958.&lt;ref name="Reid-Henry2009"&gt;{{cite book |last=Reid-Henry |first=Simon |title=Fidel and Che: A Revolutionary Friendship |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aorld6QRmYgC&amp;pg=PT141 |year=2009 |publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton |isbn=978-1-84894-138-0 |page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Epithets are not limited to mammals; for instance, comparing someone to a [[snail]] means they are (extremely) slow,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Pamatier, Robert Allen |title=Speaking of Animals: A Dictionary of Animal Metaphors |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kSr4fO2zYrIC&amp;pg=PA351 |year=1995 |publisher=Greenwood |isbn=978-0-313-29490-7 |page=351}}&lt;/ref&gt; while calling them a [[slug]] implies they are lazy and loathsome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Slug|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/slug|publisher=Oxford Dictionaries|accessdate=12 July 2017|quote=2. A slow, lazy person. "'Even though you're dying to bitchslap your clueless roommate, loser boyfriend or loathsome slug of a boss, play nice.'"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frog is pejorative for French people in English, from the use of frogs' legs in French cuisine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Why do the French call the British 'the roast beefs'? |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/2913151.stm |newspaper=BBC News |date=3 April 2003 |accessdate=1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taboos===
Edmund Leach argued in a classic 1964 paper that animal epithets are insulting when the animal in question is [[taboo]], making its name suitable for use as an obscenity. For example, Leach argues that calling a person "a son of a bitch" or "you swine" means that the "animal name itself is credited with potency".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Leach |first1=Edmund |editor=Lenneberg, E. H. |title=Anthropological Aspects of Language: Animal Categories and Verbal Abuse |work=New directions in the study of language |publisher=MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, John Halverson argued that Leach's argument about taboos was "specious", and his "categorisation of animals in terms of 'social distance' and edibility is inconsistent in itself and corresponds neither to reality nor to the scheme of social distance and human sexuality it is claimed to parallel". Halverson disputed the association of animal epithets with potency, noting that calling a timid person a mouse, or a person who does not face reality an ostrich, or a silly person a goose, does not mean that these names are potent, taboo, or sacred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Halverson |first1=John |title=Animal Categories and Terms of Abuse |journal=Man |date=December 1976 |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=505–516 |jstor=2800435}} (Subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt;

Timothy Jay argues, citing Leach, that the use of animal epithets as insults is partly down to taboos on eating pets or unfamiliar wild animals,&lt;!--this obviously doesn't explain use of farmyard animal names, then!--&gt; and partly down to our stereotypes of animals' habits, such as that pigs "are dirty, fat, and eat filth".  Jay further cites [[Sigmund Freud]]'s view that obscenities that name animals, such as cow, cock, dog, pig, and bitch, gain their power by reducing people to animals.&lt;ref name="Jay1999"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jay |first=Timothy |title=Why We Curse: A neuro-psycho-social theory of speech |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UcJHAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA196 |year=1999 |publisher=John Benjamins |isbn=978-90-272-9848-5 |pages=196–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Murphy2010"&gt;{{cite book |last=Murphy |first=Bróna |title=Corpus and Sociolinguistics: Investigating age and gender in female talk |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZV4zAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA170 |year=2010 |publisher=John Benjamins |isbn=978-90-272-8861-5 |pages=170–}}&lt;!--cites and relies on Jay--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metaphors and similes==

The use of metaphors from zoology, such as referring to politicians as rats or hyenas, is what the linguistic researcher Aida Sakalauskaite calls "zoometaphors"&lt;ref name=Sakalauskaite&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sakalauskaite |first1=Aida |title=Zoometaphors in English, German, and Lithuanian: A Corpus Study |date=2010 |publisher=University of California, Berkeley (PhD Thesis) |url=http://digitalassets.lib.berkeley.edu/etd/ucb/text/Sakalauskaite_berkeley_0028E_10322.pdf |accessdate=28 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Grzegorz A. Kleparski calls "zoosemy",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kleparski, G.A. |date=1990 |title=Semantic Change in English: A Study of Evaluative Developments in the Domain of Humans |publisher=Wydawnictwo KUL}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kiełtyka, R. and G.A. Kleparski. 2005. "The scope of English zoosemy: the case of domesticated animals" [in:] Kleparski. G.A. (ed.). Studia Anglica Resoviensia 3, 76-87.&lt;/ref&gt; the use of [[metaphor]]s from [[zoology]]. In each of three different languages, English, German, and Lithuanian, the most common animal categories are farmyard animals (40% in English), [[Canidae]] (including dog and wolf, 6% in English), and birds (10% in English). Grammatically, metaphor, as in "sly fox", is not the only option: speakers may also use [[simile]], as in "deaf as an ass". In German, 92% of animal epithets are metaphors, 8% similes, whereas in English, 53% are similes, 47% metaphors.&lt;ref name=Sakalauskaite/&gt;

The Hungarian linguists Katalin Balogné Bérces and Zsuzsa Szamosfalvi found in a preliminary survey of Serbian usage that the most commonly used "animal vocatives" were, in order, 1. pig, 2. chick(en), 3. dog/puppy, 4. cow, 5. monkey, 6. hen, 7. rat, 8. turkey, 9. mouse, 10. snake, 11. cat/kitten, 12. fox, 13. lamb, 14. vixen, 15. worm. Of these, using the classification devised by Sabina Halupka-Resetar, and Biljana Radic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Halupka-Resetar |first1=Sabina |last2=Radic |first2=Biljana |title=Animal names used in addressing people in Serbian |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=2003 |volume=35 |pages=1891–1902 |doi=10.1016/s0378-2166(03)00052-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; lamb was always used positively; cow and vixen referred to a person's appearance; pig indicated a person's eating habits; calling someone a fox or a turkey related to their intelligence, or lack of it; and names like cat, snake, worm, monkey, dog, mouse, chicken, lamb and rat were used to indicate a person's character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bérces |first1=Katalin Balogné |last2=Szamosfalvi |first2=Zsuzsa |title=Animal Names Used in Addressing People (in English) |url=https://linguistlist.org/issues/20/20-295.html |accessdate=1 July 2016 |date=28 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surnames==
[[File:The Painter and His Pug by William Hogarth.jpg|thumb|upright|The painter [[William Hogarth]]'s name is a [[metonym]] for a swineherd. Self-portrait with his dog, 1745]]

Some English surnames from the [[Middle Ages]] name animals. These have different origins. Some, like Pigg (1066), Hogg (1079) and Hoggard, Hogarth (1279) are [[metonym]]s for a swineherd,&lt;ref&gt;Reaney, pages 234, 351&lt;/ref&gt; while Oxer (1327) similarly denotes an [[ox]]herd&lt;ref&gt;Reaney, page 334&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Shepherd]] (1279 onwards) means as it sounds a herder of sheep.&lt;ref&gt;Reaney, pages 404–405&lt;/ref&gt;

Surnames that mention animals can also be [[toponym]]ic, the names Horscroft, Horsfall, Horsley and Horstead for example all denoting people who came from these villages associated with [[horse]]s. The surname Horseman (1226 onwards) on the other hand is a metonym for a rider, mounted warrior, or horse-dealer, while the surnames Horse and Horsnail could either be nicknames or metonyms for workers with horses and [[farrier|shoers of horses]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Reaney, page 239&lt;/ref&gt;

Some surnames, like Bird, dating from 1193 onwards, with variants like Byrd and Bride, are most likely [[nickname]]s for a [[bird]]like person, though they may also be metonyms for a birdcatcher; but Birdwood is toponymic, for a person who lived by a wood full of birds.&lt;ref&gt;Reaney, page 45&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eagle]] from 1230 is a nickname from the bird,&lt;ref&gt;Reaney, page 148&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Weasel]], Wessel from 1193 and [[Stag]]g from 1198 are certainly nicknames from those animals.&lt;ref&gt;Reaney, pages 423, 480&lt;/ref&gt; It is not always easy to tell whether a nickname was friendly, humorous or negative, but the surname [[Stallion]], with variants Stallan, Stallen and Stallon, (1202 onwards) is certainly pejorative, meaning "a begetter, a man of lascivious life".&lt;ref&gt;Reaney, page 423&lt;/ref&gt;

Surnames behave in similar ways in other languages; for example in [[France]], surnames can be toponymic, metonymic, or may record nicknames ("sobriquets"). [[Poisson (disambiguation)|Poisson]] ([[Fish]]) is a metonym for a fishmonger or fisherman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Patronyme Poisson : Nom de famille |url=http://www.genealogie.com/nom-de-famille/POISSON.html |publisher=Genealogie.com |accessdate=27 July 2016|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loiseau (The bird) and Lechat (The cat) are nicknames, Lechat indicating either a flexible man or a hypocrite, Loiseau suggesting a lightly-built birdlike person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Patronyme Lechat : Nom de famille |url=http://www.genealogie.com/nom-de-famille/Lechat.html |publisher=Genealogie.com |accessdate=27 July 2016|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Patronyme Loiseau : Nom de famille |url=http://www.genealogie.com/nom-de-famille/Loiseau.html |publisher=Genealogie.com |accessdate=27 July 2016|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Sweden]], the surname [[Falk (name)|Falk]] ([[Falcon]]) is common;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Efternamn, topp 100 (2015) |url=http://www.scb.se/sv_/Hitta-statistik/Statistik-efter-amne/Befolkning/Amnesovergripande-statistik/Namnstatistik/30898/30905/Samtliga-folkbokforda--Efternamn-topplistor/31063/ |publisher=Statistiska centralbyrån (Statistics Sweden) |accessdate=26 July 2016 |language=Swedish |date=22 February 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729032257/http://www.scb.se/sv_/Hitta-statistik/Statistik-efter-amne/Befolkning/Amnesovergripande-statistik/Namnstatistik/30898/30905/Samtliga-folkbokforda--Efternamn-topplistor/31063/ |archivedate=29 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it is found among Swedish nobility from 1399.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Hildebrand, Bengt |title=Falck och Falk, släkter |url=https://sok.riksarkivet.se/sbl/Presentation.aspx?id=15008 |work=Svenskt biografiskt lexikon |publisher=Riksarkivet (Swedish national archive) |accessdate=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''animistic fallacy''' is the [[informal fallacy]] of arguing that an event or situation necessarily arose because someone intentionally acted to cause it.&lt;ref name="Sowell"&gt;{{cite book |title=Knowledge and decisions |authorlink=Thomas Sowell |last=Sowell |first=Thomas |edition=3rd |publisher=Basic Books |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-465-03738-4 |pages=97–100 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4kqTMrEKWXoC&amp;pg=PA97}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While it could be that someone set out to effect a specific goal, the fallacy appears in an argument that states this ''must'' be the case.&lt;ref name="Sowell"/&gt;  The name of the fallacy comes from the [[animism|animistic]] belief that changes in the physical world are the work of conscious spirits.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}
__NOTOC__
==Examples==
[[Thomas Sowell]] in his book ''[[Knowledge and Decisions]]'' (1980) presents several arguments as examples of the animistic fallacy:&lt;ref name="Sowell"/&gt;
* that people earn wealth always because of superior choices
* that central planning is necessary to prevent chaos in society

Sowell repeatedly dismisses the necessity that order comes from design, and notes that fallacious animistic arguments tend to provide explanations that require comparatively little time to implement.  In this light he contrasts the [[Genesis creation narrative|six-day creation of the world]] described in the [[Bible]] to the development of life over billions of years described by [[evolution]].

[[File:KantWasIstAufklärung.png|thumb|300px|The first page of the 1799 edition.]]
{{Immanuel Kant}}
"'''Answering the Question: What Is Enlightenment?'''" ({{lang-de|Beantwortung der Frage: Was ist Aufklärung?}}) is a 1784 [[essay]] by the [[philosophy|philosopher]] [[Immanuel Kant]]. In the December 1784 publication of the ''[[Berlinische Monatsschrift]]'' (''Berlin Monthly''), edited by Friedrich Gedike and Johann Erich Biester, Kant replied to the question posed a year earlier by the Reverend Johann Friedrich Zöllner, who was also an official in the Prussian government. Zöllner's question was addressed to a broad intellectual public community, in reply to Biester's essay entitled: "Proposal, not to engage the clergy any longer when marriages are conducted" (April 1783) and a number of leading intellectuals replied with essays, of which Kant's is the most famous and has had the most impact. Kant's opening paragraph of the essay is a much-cited definition of a lack of Enlightenment as people's inability to think for themselves due not to their lack of intellect, but lack of courage.

Kant's essay also addressed the causes of a lack of [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]] and the preconditions necessary to make it possible for people to enlighten themselves. He held it necessary that all church and state [[paternalism]] be abolished and people be given the freedom to use their own intellect. Kant praised [[Frederick II of Prussia]] for creating these preconditions. Kant focused on religious issues, saying that "our rulers" had less interest in telling citizens what to think in regard to artistic and scientific issues.

== Basic understanding ==

Kant answers the question in the first sentence of the essay: "Enlightenment is man's emergence from his self-incurred immaturity (Unmündigkeit)." He argues that the immaturity is self-inflicted not from a lack of understanding, but from the lack of courage to use one's reason, intellect, and wisdom without the guidance of another. He exclaims that the motto of enlightenment is "[[Sapere aude]]"! – Dare to be wise!

In the sense used here, the German word "Unmündigkeit" does not mean having attained [[age of majority]] or legal adulthood. Literally translated, "Unmündig" is non-mouthed or not having a voice to raise. "Unmündig" also means "dependent" or "unfree", and another translation is "tutelage" or "nonage" (the condition of "not [being] of age"). Kant, whose moral philosophy is centred on the concept of [[autonomy]], he distinguishes between a person who is intellectually autonomous and one who keeps him/herself in an intellectually heteronomous, i.e., dependent and immature status.

Kant understands the majority of people to be content to follow the guiding institutions of society, such as the Church and the Monarchy, and unable to throw off the yoke of their immaturity due to a lack of resolution to be autonomous. It is difficult for individuals to work their way out of this immature, cowardly life because we are so uncomfortable with the idea of thinking for ourselves. Kant says that even if we did throw off the spoon-fed dogma and formulas we have absorbed, we would still be stuck, because we have never "cultivated our minds."

The key to throwing off these chains of mental immaturity is reason. There is hope that the entire public could become a force of free thinking individuals if they are free to do so. Why? There will always be a few people, even among the institutional "guardians," who think for themselves. They will help the rest of us to "cultivate our minds." Kant shows himself a man of his times when he observes that "a revolution may well put an end to autocratic despotism . . . or power-seeking oppression, but it will never produce a true reform in ways of thinking." The recently completed [[American Revolution]] had made a great impression in Europe; Kant cautions that new prejudice will replace the old and become a new leash to control the "great unthinking masses."

== Private and public use of reasoning ==
Private use of reason is doing something because we have to. For example, rational workers in a specific occupation use private reasoning to complete tasks.

Public use of reason is doing something in the public sphere because we choose to improve our private function.  Although someone may find his job or function disagreeable, the task must be completed for society to flow consistently.  He may, however, use public reasoning in order to complain about the function in the public sphere.

A military officer is required to obey the orders of his superiors. A clergyman is required to teach the doctrines of the church that employs him. But the responsibilities of their office do not preclude them from publicly voicing any opinions that may conflict with those responsibilities. We expect office holders to stay in character at all times, but Kant gives examples. A clergyman is not free to make use of his reason in the execution of his duties, but as "a scholar addressing the real public through his writings, the clergyman making public use of his reason enjoys unlimited freedom to use his own reason and to speak in his own person."

== Kant and religion ==
Staying on the religious theme, Kant asks whether a religious synod or presbytery should be entitled to “commit itself by oath to a certain unalterable set of doctrines.” He answers that a contract like this prevents “all further enlightenment of mankind forever.” It is impossible and immoral that the people of one generation could restrict the thoughts of the next generation, to prevent the extension and correction of previous knowledge, and stop all future progress. Based on this, later generations are not bound by the oaths of preceding generations. With freedom, each citizen, especially the clergy, could provide public comment until public insight and public opinion changes the religious institution. But Kant says that it is impossible to agree, “even for a single lifetime,” to a permanent religious constitution that doesn't allow public comment and criticism. If one were to renounce enlightenment for later generations, one would be trampling on the “sacred rights of mankind.” Neither an individual citizen nor a monarch has the right to constrict historical development.

Kant further explains why he has been emphasizing the religious aspect, religious immaturity, "is the most pernicious and dishonourable variety of all.” If Enlightenment is man's emergence from his ‘self-incurred immaturity' and the guiding forces of society, then simply put: the church is a political force which constrains public behaviour through the use of doctrine. By defining doctrines and making them politically binding, the Church can control the growth of reason, therefore, publicly it is in your own self-interest not to assent to a set of beliefs that hinder the development of your reason. It is in man's interest to surpass those that prevent him from using his own reason.

== Kant and Frederick the Great ==
Then Kant segues to the subject of his monarch, [[Frederick the Great]]. He states that a monarch should allow his subjects to do or think whatever they find necessary for their salvation, and that such thoughts and deeds are “none of his business.” Religious ideas should not be subject to government oversight, and government should not support “spiritual despotism” against any of his subjects.

It is insisted that the king favours freedom in the arts and sciences because there is “no danger to his legislation” from his subjects' making public use of their own reason and providing “forthright criticism of the current legislation." Throughout history we see that most monarchs do perceive danger from free thinking subjects.

Kant asks if they (those living in 1784) are living in an “enlightened age.” The answer is no, but they do live in an “age of enlightenment.” His point here is that because of the actions of Frederick, there are fewer obstacles to “universal enlightenment.” Religious leaders may “freely and publicly submit to the judgment of the world their verdicts and opinions, even if these deviate . . . from orthodox doctrine.”

Finally, Kant provides some philosophy that is probably directed towards his monarch by proposing a paradox. “A high degree of civil freedom seems advantageous to a people's intellectual freedom, yet it also sets up insuperable barriers to it. Conversely, a lesser degree of civil freedom gives intellectual freedom enough room to expand to its fullest extent.”

== Kant and orientation in thinking ==
Orientation in thinking links very much with direction of thought: on what basis does our thought path determine the way we act?

This is split into two conceptions, theoretical and practical thinking. Theoretical thinking is the laws of thought. It is subjective (an assumption), but must be established to prevent us from falling into chaos. A key example of this is the idea of an intelligible first cause and development of our moral attitudes. Practical thinking is the application of theoretical thinking to our thoughts, with which we can ensure the basis of moral laws through the concepts of freedom, highest good and happiness.

== Kant and historical development ==
Humanity as a species requires historical development to become autonomous, for reason does not work instinctively; it requires trial, practice and instruction to allow it to progress. ‘Argue as much as you like, but obey' as, through opposition, a synthesis can develop. Resistance is needed for development.

== Foucault and "What is Enlightenment?" ==
In 1984 French philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] published an essay on Kant's work, giving it the same title (''Qu'est-ce que les Lumières?''). Foucault's essay reflected on the contemporary status of the project of enlightenment, inverting much of Kant's reasoning but concluding that enlightenment "still entails work on our limits."

A '''Bachelor of Independent Studies''' is an [[undergraduate]] academic degree.  Its program of studies is unique to each student, and the individual [[curriculum|curricula]] are largely determined by each student.  It may focus in any field, and generally has two phases: a pre-thesis phase, in which the student takes courses or reading courses, and a [[thesis]] phase, in which the student completes a substantial thesis.  A similarly name '''Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies''' is also awarded by some universities.  The degree can be considered akin to a degree in general studies.

While it is an undergraduate degree, it is far more akin in structure to a [[Graduate school|graduate]] degree. In the United States, the degree is becoming an option in more and more settings. The state of [[Florida]] has developed an external degree program for the BIS degree; [[Florida International University]], [[Florida State University]], the [[University of Florida]], the [[University of North Florida]], and the [[University of South Florida]] all participate. In [[Kentucky]], [[Murray State University]] now offers a BIS program as well. Several other colleges are beginning to offer degrees that are very similar to or identical with the BIS program, such as the [[University of Northern Iowa]] and its [[Bachelor of Liberal Studies]] program, or [[Brigham Young University]]'s [[Bachelor of General Studies]] program.

'''Faculty of Biology of the [[Belarusian State University]]''' was founded in 1931. It is a major biology research and teaching establishment in the country, which includes nine Departments and nine Research Laboratories. The Dean is Vladimir V. Lysak, Docent, Candidate of Sciences

== General information ==
More than eleven thousands biologists have been graduated from the Faculty since 1931. About eighty graduates have received the ‘Doctor of Sciences’ degree (highest scientific degree, equivalent to Habilitation or old style UK D.Sc.); seven hundreds graduates obtained the ‘Candidate of Sciences’ degree (equivalent to Ph.D.).

A number of world-class researchers and outstanding managers of high education started their career in the Faculty. For example, Professor Leonid M. Sushchenya was graduated from the Faculty in 1953. He is widely accepted as one of the creators of modern Freshwater Biology. Leonid M. Sushchenya was an Academician of both Soviet and Belarusian Academies of Sciences. In 1990s, he was a President of National Academy of Sciences of Belarus (NASB). Another ecologist, Professor Alexander P. Ostapenya, was a Head of Hydrobiology Laboratory (largest in Europe). Professor Ekaterina I. Slobozhanina (graduated in 1967) is currently a Deputy Director of the Institute of Biophysics and Cell Engineering of the NASB. Another alumni, Professor Oleg G. Davydenko (graduated in 1973), works as a Head of Laboratory in the Institute of Genetics and Cytology of NASB. Vitaliy P. Semenchenko (graduated in 1973) is a Deputy Director General of NASB Scientific and Practical Center of Bio-resources. Professor Sergey A. Usanov (graduated in 1973) is a Head of the Institute of Bio-organic Chemistry of the NASB. These successful academics are well known in Belarus and abroad. Since early 1990s, graduates of BSU Biological Faculty have been settling all around the world; a number of them currently work as Professors, Lecturers or Senior Research Associates in the world's leading research universities, such as Cambridge, Heidelberg, Harvard or Oxford. Some graduates have become top managers in bio-industry (Glaxosmithkline, Pfizer, etc.).

The highest standard in biology teaching is maintained due to the strong linkage between educational process and the scientific research in the Faculty. Internationally recognised centers for study of hydrobiology, biochemistry, plant ion transport, microbial molecular genetics, entomology and others have been established in the Faculty since 1931. The Faculty collaborates with NASB Department of Biological Sciences forming Joint University Centre between BSU and NASB. As a result, a number of research students have good quality publications and win Student Biology Olympiads, prizes and young scientist research grants both in Belarus and abroad.

The international collaboration is another strong feature of the Faculty. The Faculty routinely organises several key international conferences, such as «Lake Ecosystems: Biological Processes, Anthropogenic Transformation, Quality of Water», «Xenobiotics and Living Systems», etc., usually involving several hundred participants. The Faculty publishes peer-reviewed «Physiological, biochemical and molecular fundamentals of biological systems».

Apart of the NASB Department of Biological Sciences, the Faculty has established collaborative links with research institutions of NASB Department of Medical Sciences and NASB Department of Agricultural Sciences. The Faculty owes one of the Europe’s most advanced Zoology Museum, which has recently been renovated to the highest international standard. It is also a home of old Fundamental Herbarium, University Botanical Gardens and Biological Theatre. The Faculty also owes a research base on Naroch Lake (large lake in the Northern Belarus), which is called «Vinberg’s Naroch Biological Station» and used both for teaching and research purposes.

The Faculty is committed to providing students with modern and well-equipped lecture halls and research facilities to ensure a first-class environment in which to study and do research. It offers excellent computer rooms, free wi-fi internet access in the Faculty buildings. The Faculty also organises students’ research conferences and paper contests, Annual Belarusian Biology Olympiad for High Education Students. Several departments in the Faculty possess a special infrastructure, which is called Student Research Laboratories. These Laboratories are aimed to provide research guidance, space and equipment for student independent research work. When preparing for exams, students are provided with all necessary handbooks (library is available on campus), free exam training using Moodle based environment and other up-to-date resources.

== Education ==
;•	High Education Diploma
is five years of studies for full-time students, and six years for distant learning students; totally about 5000 hours of auditorium and laboratory work. It is widely accepted as equivalent to Bachelor-level degree in the Western Europe. Note that the number of lecture and practical classes is significantly higher (sometimes by 10–15 times) in BSU’s High Education Diploma than in most universities of Western Europe, North America or Australia (B.Sc. Course).

;•	Magistrature
is usually one year-long postgraduate course, which is equivalent to Masters Course in English speaking countries. BSU also offers two-year Research Magistrature, which is equivalent to M.Diss. or M.Res. in English speaking countries.

;•	Aspiranture
includes three and four-year programmes for the full-time and distant learning postgraduate students respectively. This is Candidate of Sciences course, which is equivalent to Ph.D. course in English speaking countries. It is internationally accredited and accepted.

;•	Doctoranture
is 2–3 years of postgraduate research at the highest level (post-C.Sc./Ph.D.). It is an equivalent to Habilitation Course in Germany. Doctoranture is aimed at preparing Doctor of Sciences Dissertation, which does not exist anymore in English speaking countries, while it is still required in most European countries.

;Museum of zoology
Museum of Zoology was established in 1921 at the initiative of the Head of Department of Zoology, Professor Anatoliy V. Fedyushin.
This Museum has the largest collection of zoological objects in the Republic (stuffed animals, birds nests, drugs, osteological material and other vertebrates as well as invertebrates), totally over 102 thousand units. Scientific collections of the museum are kept in special rooms occupying a total area of 980 m2. 260 species of the collection are listed in Red Data Book of the CIS countries and the world.

Over the last decade, the exhibition fund has been reinforced by such rare species as the red wolf, wandering albatross, ostrich, Hyacinth Macaw, a chimpanzee, some tropical insects and many other items that cannot be found in any other natural history museums in Belarus. In addition, the museum has a significant number of long-extinct fossil animals, for example, fragments of fossil elephant, discovered in 2006 during the construction of the Minsk Metro.

For a long time, the museum existed as a temporary exposition and only in 2001 the collection was moved to permanent premises with expanded storage facilities. Since then construction of landscapes and ecological dioramas displaying rare and endangered species in natural surroundings has been initiated.

;Botanical garden
The Botanical Garden was founded in 1930 by Professor Stepan P. Melnik within the Department of Plant Systematics. Since 1933, it has been supervised by Natalia O. Tsetterman. In 1956, the Botanical Gardens covered 2 hectares of campus land and its collection included 37 species of trees, 19 species of shrubs and many herbaceous plants. In 1965, the Botanical Gardens moved to Schemyslitsa Training and Experimental Farm of the BSU. Since 2002, the Botanical Garden has been relocated to the fields near the Faculty of Biology at 10 Kurchatov Street. At present, it includes a greenhouse, arboretum and a piece of real ancient oak forest «Dubrava».

The collection of medical, decorative, perennial, rare and endangered plants contains over 900 species, varieties and forms. The collection of tropical and subtropical plants includes about 400 species and varieties belonging to 190 genera of 69 families. A number of species of tropical and subtropical plants can be found in the greenhouse, the conservatory and on the floors of the Faculty of Biology. Arboretum was founded in 1928 and, nowadays it embraces 250 species and forms of 96 genera and 38 families.

;Georgiy vinberg naroch biological station
The scientific and research centre Georgiy Vinberg Naroch Biological Station is the oldest biological station in Belarus. For many years it has been a place where profound research on the functioning processes and biological productivity of the water bodies has been conducted. Results of these investigations are recognised by researchers in hydrobiology all over the world. The materials of long-term investigations of the polytypic Naroch Lakes serve as a basis for development of measures on rational use and preservation of the unique Naroch Lakes’ environment.

The primary objectives of Georgiy Vinberg Naroch Biological Station are:
:- educational : to serve as a basis for professional training of ecologists and hydrobiologists;
:- scientific : to carry out fundamental and applied research in the field of biology and ecology;

'''Breakaway music''' is a modern [[United States Navy|U.S. Naval]] tradition used to motivate sailors upon the conclusion of [[underway replenishment]] (UNREP), although using breakaway music is at the discretion of the [[Captain (United States)|captain]], and not all commands use it. When the two ships involved in the UNREP conclude their transfer of fuels and stores and commence their breakaway, a song (usually selected by the captain, but sometimes picked by the [[officer of the deck]] (OOD) or [[Navigator|navigation officer]]) is played over the [[1 Main Circuit]].  Breakaway music may sometimes be related to the name of the ship, such as the "[[Theme from Star Trek]]" ({{USS|Enterprise|CVN-65}}) or "Kansas City, Here I Come" ({{USS|Kansas City|AOR-3}}).  The fast combat support ship, and oiler, {{USS|Camden|AOE-2}}  played the "[[Baby Elephant Walk]]" (written in 1961 by composer [[Henry Mancini]], for the 1962 release of the movie ''[[Hatari!]]'') after each UNREP in honor of its title as "The Awesome Pachyderm of the Pacific".

The '''conflict between [[good and evil]]''' is one of the most common conventional themes in [[literature]], and is sometimes considered to be a universal part of the [[human condition]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldtransformation.com/good-vs-evil/ ''Good vs Evil''&lt;/ref&gt;. There are several variations on this conflict, one being the battle between individuals or ideologies, with one side held up as ''[[Goodness and value theory|Good]]'', while the other is portrayed as ''[[Evil]]''. Another variation is the inner struggle in characters (and by extension, humans in reality) between good and evil. 

==Classical tragedy==
The form of tragedy described as best by [[Aristotle]] and exemplified by ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'' is, properly, concerned more with the tragic operations of fate than with a thematized conflict between good and evil. Nevertheless, the conflict between the good and the flawed aspects of the [[tragic hero]] form an important part of tragic [[catharsis]] in Aristotle's theory. There is, moreover, the form of tragedy with a happy ending that, although denigrated from Aristotle, was quite common in antiquity. This form, perhaps best exemplified by the [[Alcestis]] of [[Euripides]], ends with a hero or god decisively beating an evil character.  [[Northrop Frye]] has suggested that this form of "tragedy" is, in fact, the basic template for [[melodrama]].
&lt;gallery&gt;

File:Joan of Arc miniature graded.jpg| Joan of Arc is a folk heroine of France and a Roman Catholic saint. Cultural depictions of Joan of Arc have continued in film, theatre, television, video games, music, and performances to this day.
File:Washington Crossing the Delaware by Emanuel Leutze, MMA-NYC, 1851.jpg|  The first American president, George Washington, is often depicted in a heroic manner. Many Americans view the American Revolution as a war for freedom against governmental tyranny.
File:Adolf Hitler cph 3a48970.jpg|Adolf Hitler, Chancellor of Nazi Germany. Sometimes referred to as "The Good War," the Second World War has arguably come in western discourse to signify the very idea of a [[Just War Theory|just war]] between Good (The Allies) and Evil (The Axis), in both popular and at times even academic spheres.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Jewish and Christian literature==
Writers from the earliest times have thematized the conflict between good and evil, understood, of course, in religious terms.  In the [[Old Testament]], [[Yahweh]] asks the prophet [[Jeremiah]]: "The heart is devious above all else; it is perverse—who can understand it?" ({{bibleref|Jeremiah|17:9}}, [[NRSV]]). Compare also the [[Book of Job]].
  
In addition to explicating [[classical antiquity|classical]] myth and stories to reveal a hidden conflict between good and evil in them, they wrote into their own texts different versions of the conflict.  The basic forms may be described as the [[apocalyptic literature|apocalyptic]], in which the writer describes real, social events (whether historical or imagined) as manifestations of the eternal conflict between [[God]] and [[Satan]], good and evil &amp;mdash; a struggle that, if controlled in the end by God's [[omnipotence]], was nevertheless of deep importance for humans.  In a different way, Christian writers could focus on the internal struggle to find or maintain belief. This literature is exemplified by the ''[[Psychomachia]]'' of [[Prudentius]], whose title continues to signify great psychological turmoil, and supremely by [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine of Hippo's]] ''[[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]]'', the model for countless later psychological biographies. Special mention might also be made of the ''[[Consolation of Philosophy]]'' of [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]], a work that combines Platonic, Christian, and Stoic thought on the nature of suffering.

== The inner evil conflict ==
[[Joseph Conrad]] defined all humans as having an "inner evil" or ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' in his novella of the same name.

While certainly not as widely seen as the direct good vs. evil conflict, the concept of "individual vs. self" is often much more compelling to a reader/watcher, especially if it is the [[protagonist]]. In both [[literature]] and [[film]], it requires well-written character development in order to truly succeed.

[[Joseph Conrad]]'s version of the inner evil conflict, known as the [[Heart of Darkness]], is a [[human]]'s struggle with their own [[morals]], and their own battle with their hidden evil. Although first chiefly used in the novel, this improved device was commonly used, as opposed to the old devices used in literature before the turn of the century. It is a conflict that exists outside of literature as well, making it a universal truth of the human condition.

'''Crotonia''' was the first [[literary society]] to exist at [[Yale University]]. Little is known about it. It was already defunct before 1766.&lt;ref name=YAM&gt;{{cite web |url= http://archives.yalealumnimagazine.com/issues/01_03/groups.html |title= An Irrepressible Urge to Join|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= March 2001|website= |publisher= Yale Alumni Magazine|access-date= 22 November 2016|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==
In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the course of study at Yale was drastically different from what it is now. The majority of literature studied was that of the ancient Greeks, Romans, and, in the extensive study of the [[Old Testament]], Hebrews. English literature was not introduced into the curriculum until the 1850s.  The young men who studied at Yale at the time felt the need to supplement their studies with a working knowledge of contemporary literature and a forum in which to gain “skill in making known [their] own thoughts in good, plain English” .

The literary societies, which first appeared at Yale and soon afterward at many other colleges and universities, were designed to fill this void.  Unlike other societies, students of any class from freshmen to seniors could be members of the literary societies; in fact, by the end of the eighteenth century, everyone at Yale belonged to one and there was often fierce competition for the recruitment of freshmen.

==Activities==
These societies were primarily debating societies, but they also held speeches and poetry readings and each had a substantial library, filled with books that one could not find in Yale College’s collection.&lt;ref name=YAM/&gt; Only the members of a given society had access to its library, and debates primarily took place within the society, though by the mid-1800s it was not unheard of for a speech to be attended by members of all three societies, or for inter-society debates to be organized. At the end of the Civil War, the Yale College faculty attempted to ban fraternities and sophomore societies. As a cover for their continued existence, many of these groups took the guise of small debating societies.  [[Linonia]] and [[Brothers in Unity]] no longer dominated the College’s social scene, and the Yale Union became the primary forum for debate. In 1872, Linonia and Brothers in Unity gave up their libraries to the College’s collection and were wholly absorbed by the Union, which enjoyed intermittent existence until 1934 when it became the [[Yale Political Union]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3679">'''David Grey Rattray''' (6 September 1958 – 26 January 2007) was a South African historian of the 1879 [[Anglo-Zulu war]] in [[South Africa]], also well known as a tour guide.&lt;ref name="theg_Obit" /&gt;

==Biography==
Rattray was born in [[Johannesburg]], matriculated from the [[St. Alban's College]] in [[Pretoria]], and studied [[entomology]] (the study of insects) at the [[University of Natal]], [[Pietermaritzburg]], where he graduated in 1982. From 1983 to 1988 he managed the prestigious [[Mala Mala Game Reserve]] situated on the doorstep of [[Kruger National Park]]. In 1989 he and his family moved to their family farm at [[Rorke's Drift]], where the renowned Battle of [[Isandlwana]] and Battle of Rorke's Drift took place between the [[Zulu people|Zulu]]s and [[British people|British]] soldiers. He and his wife, Nicky, established and operated the Fugitives' Drift Lodge.

He gained considerable knowledge about the conflicts between the Zulus and British in South Africa as a child as he accompanied his father, a keen amateur historian himself, as he interviewed Zulus in the local community to obtain their accounts of the conflict, some of whose forebears had fought in those wars.

He provided tours of the historic battle sites of Isandlwana and Rorke's Drift, and his tours are estimated to have been attended by more than 60&amp;nbsp;000 visitors. He was a fellow of the [[Royal Geographical Society]] in [[London]], and his annual lectures there are reported to have been always well attended.

Rattray, aged 48, was shot dead on his farm in [[KwaZulu-Natal]] on 26 January 2007 during an armed robbery attempt by six men.&lt;ref name="dail_'Isa" /&gt;&lt;ref name="econ_Davi" /&gt;&lt;ref name="indep" /&gt; He was laid to rest in a simple pine coffin at [[Balgowan, South Africa|Balgowan]] deep in the forested Natal Midlands.  Five of the gang, including the murderer, were subsequently arrested and sentenced to life imprisonment.&lt;ref name="stan_'Dav" /&gt;

An '''egg-and-spoon race''' is a [[Sport|sporting event]] in which participants must balance an [[egg (biology)|egg]] or similarly shaped item upon a [[spoon]] and [[Racing|race]] with it to the finishing line. At many [[primary schools]] an egg-and-spoon race is staged as part of the annual [[Sports Day]], alongside other events such as the [[sack race]] and the [[three-legged race]].

==History==
The earliest recorded usage in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' is in an article of 8 September 1894 featured in ''[[The Daily News (UK)|The Daily News]]'': "the gentlemen had a turn in the egg-and-spoon race, in which the competitors had to [[Punt (boat)|punt]] with one hand and balance an egg on a spoon with the other".&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] V: Dvandva-Follis |year=1989 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-19-861186-8 |page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- This book isn't reliable as a source on the history of games: An earlier origin in the [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial United States]] has been claimed.&lt;ref name="Horowitz"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DMqcmwxfFikC&amp;pg=PA36#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=International Games: Building Skills Through Multicultural Play |author=Horowitz, Gayle |year=2008 |publisher=Human Kinetics |isbn=978-0-736-07394-3 |pages=36 f}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; Egg-and-spoon races formed part of village celebrations of the [[Queen_Victoria#Diamond_Jubilee|Diamond Jubilee]] of [[Queen Victoria]] in 1897, alongside the [[tug of war]] and blindfold [[wheelbarrow race]]s.&lt;ref name="Wiltshire"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wshc.eu/blog/why-are-wiltshires-towns-villages-and-schools-looking-back-to-look-forward-to-the-queens-jubilee.html |title=Why Wiltshire's towns, villages and schools are looking back to look forward to the Queen's Jubilee |publisher=[[Wiltshire Council|Wiltshire]] and [[Borough of Swindon|Swindon]] History Centre |accessdate=7 July 2012 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; A set of [[Woodturning|turned]] and [[Wood stain|stained]] wooden eggs and spoons designed for racing and dating to the 1920s forms part of the Good Time Gallery of the Museum of Childhood in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O10749/egg-and-spoon/ |title=Egg and spoon race set |publisher=[[Victoria and Albert Museum]] |accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It reached Canada by at least 1922, the first time it was mentioned in ''[[The Globe and Mail|The Globe]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Plains Road School Picnic|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|date=26 June 1922|location=Toronto ON|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1930s, the phenomenon of the parents' egg-and-spoon race was sufficiently well-established to be [[Satire|satirized]] in ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]''.&lt;ref name="OED"/&gt; Races were held among the staff of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] until the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/index.php?pageid=168 |title=Trinity College Staff Sports and Social Club |publisher=[[Trinity College, Cambridge]] |accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Egg-and-spoon races were held as part of the celebrations for both the 1977 [[Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Silver Jubilee]] and 2012 [[Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Diamond Jubilee]] of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4353004/Sweet-party.html |title=Sweet party: Whole of Britain turns out to kick off jubilee in style |author=Mills, James |work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]] |date=3 June 2012 |accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2012, the [[British Council]] promoted the egg-and-spoon race as a suitable event for "English days", alongside the celebration of [[Charles Dickens]] and of the [[Victorian era]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishcouncil.org/english_days_with_the_british_council.doc |title=English days with the British Council |publisher=[[British Council]] |accessdate=7 July 2012 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variant of this sport played in India uses a lemon instead of an egg and often has the participant hold the spoon in the mouth.

==Prohibition==
In some schools the attendance of parents is prohibited or alternative non-competitive events staged, with the intention of sparing children the embarrassment and stigma of defeat.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1532418/The-egg-and-spoon-award-for-political-correctness.html# |title=The egg and spoon award for political correctness |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=26 October 2006 |accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In others, the use of raw eggs is banned on the grounds of [[Risk assessment#Risk assessment in public health|health and safety]] and fears of [[allergy]] or of competitors contracting [[salmonella]] through accidental [[ingestion]] of the contents of a broken egg.&lt;ref name="Manchester University"/&gt; [[Boiled egg|Hard-boiled]], wooden, ceramic or synthetic eggs may be used in their stead, or alternative substitutes such as potatoes, small balls, or [[Gelatin dessert|jelly]].{{citation needed|date=November 2018|reason=[[WP:DAILYMAIL]]}} Punitive [[Insurance|insurance premiums]] have also resulted in the cancellation of some events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/sack-race-is-too-dangerous-7177523.html |title=Sack race is too dangerous |work=[[London Evening Standard]] |date=7 February 2007 |accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase "egg and spoon" features in [[The Concise New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English]]; its use, along with the idiom [[Wiktionary:good egg|good egg]] with which it is sometimes confused, is frowned upon by the [[Metropolitan Police Service]] on the grounds of it being derogatory and [[rhyming slang]] for "[[Wiktionary:coon|coon]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1394248/Nitty-gritty-is-not-PC-minister.html |title=Nitty gritty is not PC, minister |author=Steele, John |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=15 May 2002 |accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/may/15/race.world |title=Why nitty gritty has been ruled a no-no in the police lexicon |author=Hopkins, Nick |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=15 May 2002 |accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cCVnlIUTpg4C&amp;pg=PA232#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Concise New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English |editor=[[Eric Partridge|Partridge, Eric]] |publisher=[[Routledge]] |year=2008 |isbn=978-0415-21259-5 |page=232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Records==
A number of [[world record]]s in egg-and-spoon racing are held by New Yorker and serial record-holder [[Ashrita Furman]]; these include, as published by [[Guinness World Records]], fastest 100 m egg-and-spoon race (19.39 seconds);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-5000/fastest-100-m-egg-and-spoon-race/ |title=Fastest 100 m egg-and-spoon race |publisher=[[Guinness World Records]] |accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; fastest 100 m egg-and-spoon race while holding the spoon in the mouth (25.13 seconds);&lt;ref name="Mouths"/&gt; fastest mile egg-and-spoon race (7 minutes, 8 seconds);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-4000/fastest-mile-egg-and-spoon-race/ |title=Fastest mile egg and spoon race |publisher=[[Guinness World Records]] |accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; fastest mile egg-and-spoon race holding the spoon with both hands (8 minutes, 5 seconds);&lt;ref name="Hands"/&gt; and fastest mile egg-and-spoon race holding the spoon in the mouth (9 minutes, 29 seconds).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/5000/fastest-mile-carrying-an-egg-on-a-spoon-in-the-mouth |title=Fastest mile carrying an egg on a spoon in the mouth |publisher=[[Guinness World Records]] |accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990 a runner completed the [[London Marathon]] in three hours forty-seven minutes while carrying a [[dessert spoon]] with an uncooked egg balanced upon it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/3000/fastest-marathon-running-with-an-egg-and-spoon |title=Fastest marathon running with an egg and spoon |publisher=[[Guinness World Records]] |accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British Olympic [[heptathlon|heptathlete]] and gold-medal winner [[Denise Lewis]] cites victory aged six in a thirty-metre egg-and-spoon race as the origin of her sporting ambitions; she advises all young athletes "concentrate, have fun with it and do your best".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sponsored/sport/national-school-sport-week/9344960/denise-lewis-advice-young-athletes.html |title=Denise Lewis's advice for young athletes |author=Davies, Gareth A |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=20 June 2012 |accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19694">'''Fałszywka''' ({{lang-en|[[false document]] or [[forgery]]}})&lt;ref name="bab.la"/&gt; is a [[Polish language|Polish]] [[socio-political]] term describing [[counterfeit]] top secret files and fake police reports produced by the [[Ministry of Public Security (Poland)|Ministry of Public Security]] in the [[People's Republic of Poland]].&lt;ref name="nie.com" /&gt; Their purpose was to undermine the popularity of prominent opponents of [[Polish United Workers' Party]], mainly by attempting to ruin their good name as private individuals. ''Fałszywka'' ([[Plural|pl]]. ''fałszywki'') were used from the beginning of the People's Republic against opponents of the Communist system.   These included seemingly stolen or declassified revelations about opposition members working as alleged police informants under the Soviet system.&lt;ref name="ostroda.wm"/&gt; Most notably, some have argued that an entire forged file of this sort was produced in the 1980s and then disseminated by the communist establishment about the leading dissident and future President of Poland [[Lech Wałęsa]] when he was nominated for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. This file was fabricated and then "leaked" to the media (as "proof" of his betrayal of [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]])&lt;ref name="wykop.pl"/&gt; in an attempt to prevent Wałęsa from being awarded the Prize.&lt;ref name="CTV News"/&gt; A similar file led to the publication of a widely successful book ''Zabić tego Polaka'' (To Kill that Pole) about the fake assassination plan against the Pope [[John Paul II]] during his 1983 pilgrimage to Poland.&lt;ref name="polandleaks"/&gt;

==History==
The former head of the State Protection Office (UOP), General Gromosław Czempiński, described the method in which typical ''fałszywka'' used to be made.&lt;ref name="Czempiński"/&gt; Nobody ever saw the original document (as in the case of Lech Wałęsa). The ''[[Służba Bezpieczeństwa|Security Service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs]]'' made sure that only the photocopies were in circulation, because they could not be denounced as fake, and were easy to make. The Ministry of Public Security used them frequently, said Czempiński, stating also that often the officers who signed them were created out of thin air.&lt;ref name="Czempiński" /&gt; Writer [[Jerzy Urban]] noted, that (if available) signatures of alleged collaborators, from unrelated documents, were also photocopied and pasted into ''fałszywkas'' before reprints.&lt;ref name="nie.com"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nie.com.pl/art25939.htm | title=Alfabet Urbana 2 | publisher=Tygodnik "NIE" w internecie | work=Numer archiwalny | date=October 2012 | accessdate=September 25, 2012 | author=[[Jerzy Urban]] | language=Polish }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[revolutions of 1989]], the ''fałszywkas'' were catalogued by the [[Institute of National Remembrance]] in accordance with its own mandate, and subsequently also made available to the public based on the right to request access to recorded information held by government organizations (RFI). Numerous prominent politicians, such as [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Poland)|the Minister]] [[Władysław Bartoszewski]] (former [[Auschwitz]] concentration camp prisoner),&lt;ref name="gazeta"/&gt; and Professor [[Jerzy Kłoczowski]] (member of the [[UNESCO]] Executive Board),&lt;ref name="lena"/&gt; have been noted among their targets. Kłoczowski was defended against slander based on a ''fałszywka'' produced by Security Service, in a letter of protest published in ''[[Rzeczpospolita (newspaper)|Rzeczpospolita]]'' in 2004, and signed by a number of Polish public personalities, including Prof. [[Jerzy Buzek]], [[Tadeusz Mazowiecki]], [[Jan Nowak-Jeziorański]], Prof. [[Władysław Bartoszewski]], Prof. [[Andrzej Zoll]], [[Józef Życiński]], [[Andrzej Wajda]], Prof. [[Barbara Skarga]], Prof. [[Jan Miodek]], Prof. [[Jerzy Zdrada]], [[Aleksander Hall]], [[Władysław Frasyniuk]], Prof. [[Adam Galos]], [[Krystyna Zachwatowicz]] and many others.&lt;ref name="ekai.pl"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ekai.pl/dzien_uchodzcy/x8315/protest-intelektualistow-w-obronie-prof-kloczowskiego/ | title=Protest intelektualistów w obronie prof.

==Lech Wałęsa as agent Bolek==
[[File:Lech Walesa 1980.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lech Wałęsa]] in 1980, [[Gdańsk]]]]
Wałesa has been accused of having been an informer for the Polish secret police ''[[Służba Bezpieczeństwa]]'' (SB) already in the early 1970s. A 2008 book by historians from the [[Institute of National Remembrance]] (IPN), [[Sławomir Cenckiewicz]] and [[Piotr Gontarczyk]], presented evidence provoking a nationwide debate.&lt;ref name="ipn.gov.pl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wikinews"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Szporer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boyes"/&gt; The book was perceived by some as very controversial; but it contained over 130 pages of documents in support of its thesis, originating from the archives of the ''SB'' secret service, which were inherited by the ''IPN''. Cenckiewicz defended his discoveries on those basis.&lt;ref name="spiegel"/&gt; Even [[Janusz Kurtyka]], president of the Institute of National Remembrance at the time, believed it was true, while admitting that the book did not contain a "hundred-percent" proof of Wałęsa in fact being the agent ''Bolek''.&lt;ref name="RMF24"/&gt; To make the matters worse, some of the photocopies went missing from the secret police records during Wałęsa's presidency of Poland (1990–1995), which some commentators perceived as a more serious problem inhibiting the post-communist process of [[lustration]] in Poland.&lt;ref name="Szporer-2012"/&gt; The ''SB'' security police tried to recruit Wałęsa several times and maintained the ''Bolek'' file between 1970 and 1976. At different times in his career Wałęsa had both admitted and denied that he has identified individuals during his interrogations recorded there. However, no compromising ''SB'' documents exist about him at all, once he joined the Solidarity Coastal Free Trade Union in the following years.&lt;ref name="Szporer-2012"/&gt;

In 2011 the Bialystok IPN seemingly admitted that the ''Służba Bezpieczeństwa'' fabricated some of the documents pertaining to the alleged collaboration of Wałęsa with the secret police. The SB goal was to slander and discredit him before the Nobel committee.&lt;ref name="wyborcza.pl"/&gt; The ''fałszywkas'' were seemingly confirmed in the 2000 court case by a document written in 1985 by Major Adam Styliński during an internal investigation at the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The document written by Styliński described how the ''fałszywkas'' were produced and disseminated by the department as far as Norway during the [[martial law in Poland]].&lt;ref name="wyborcza.pl"/&gt; On December 22, 2011, the Institute of National Remembrance confirmed in its final statement that the communist apparatus had forged documents secretly mailed to Oslo in the SB operation "Ambasador" and similar others from the 1980s.&lt;ref name="CTVNews World"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Raporty"/&gt;  In April 2015, on the other hand, the IPN found that there was no evidence that any documents had been falsified regarding Wałęsa's supposed collaboration, which led to the conclusion that the documents on this matter had not been fabricated. &lt;ref&gt;http://niezalezna.pl/65919-prokuratura-ustalila-sb-nie-falszowala-donosow-walesy-w-zwiazku-z-czym-sa-one-prawdziwe&lt;/ref&gt;  

It should be noted however that whether or not SB falsified some of the documents to be sent to the Nobel Committee, Cenckiewicz's and Gontarczyk's conclusion are not based on the suspect documents but rather on the authentic SB records which are wholly independent from the Oslo issue. These documents independently establish Wałęsa's collaboration with SB. According to an IPN announcement in 2011 the claim about the falsification of the Nobel Committee Bolek documents only confirms, not refutes Cenckiewicz's and Gontarczyk's findings, specifically what they wrote about SB's falsification attempts on pp. 137-146 of their book. IPN explicitly rejected the incorrect claim that all Bolek documents were found to be fake.&lt;ref&gt;http://old.ipn.gov.pl/wydzial-prasowy/media-o-ipn/2011/przeglad-mediow-22-grudnia-2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Cenckiewicz and Gontarczyk also establish that Wałęsa tried to destroy the authentic documents during his presidential tenure.&lt;ref&gt;SB a Lech Wałęsa: przyczynek do biografii, 2008, pp. 197ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016-2017 the experts of Prof. Jan Sehn Institute of Forensic Research in Cracow have analyzed the new cache of the Bolek documents demonstrating Wałęsa's collaboration with SB and found them to be completely authentic.&lt;ref&gt;https://ipn.gov.pl/en/news/899,Information-on-the-experts-opinion-on-the-secret-collaborator-Boleks-files.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==John Paul II assassination folder==
[[File:Msza św na Pl Zwycięstwa.jpg|thumb|right|[[John Paul II]] at an open-air mass on Victory Square in [[Warsaw]], 1979]]
On 13 May 1981 Pope [[John Paul II]] was shot and critically wounded in Rome by a Turkish gunman.&lt;ref name="Year"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dziwisz"/&gt; Little is known about classified documents describing an alleged similar attempt on his life during his 1979 Papal visit to Poland. In 2002–2004 the IPN prosecutor Andrzej Witkowski uncovered a ''fałszywka'' suggesting that an assassination attempt was planned by the Polish security forces during his church mass in [[Częstochowa]]. The information came from the local communist prosecutor Marek Izydorek. However, when Witkowski attempted to locate the actual folder, the only note he found said that there are no such documents.&lt;ref name="polandleaks"/&gt;&lt;ref name="estudiante"/&gt;

The alleged John Paul II assassination folder was behind the 1991 publication of an immensely popular book entitled ''Zabić tego Polaka'' (To Kill that Pole) printed in Warsaw by ''Wydawnictwo ROK'' publishing, with 100,000 copies. The book claimed that the action was conducted not in 1979, but in 1983; and not in Częstochowa, but in Warsaw; and that the only reason why it did not succeed was the faulty bomb detonator. It is suspected that the story was based on a counterfeit police report produced by the Ministry of Public Security.&lt;ref name="polandleaks"/&gt;&lt;ref name="estudiante"/&gt;

'''Gradation''' in art is a visual technique of gradually transitioning from one colour hue to another, or from one shade to another, or one texture to another.  Space, distance, atmosphere, volume, and curved or rounded forms are some of the visual effects created with gradation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Judy|title=The Encyclopedia of Pastel Techniques|year=1992|publisher=Running Press|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|isbn=1-56138-087-3|pages=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Gradation.svg|thumb|A gradient illustration, showing a gradation spectrum from black to white.]]
Artists use a variety of methods to create gradation, depending upon the art medium, and the precise desired effect. [[Blending (art)|Blending]], [[shading (art)|shading]], [[hatching]] and [[crosshatching]] are common methods.  A fading effect can be created with [[pastels]] by using a [[torchon (art)|torchon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Judy|title=The Encyclopedia of Pastel Techniques|year=1992|publisher=Running Press|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|isbn=1-56138-087-3|pages=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gradation in photography==
Gradation can also be useful in composing photographs. The early decades of the development of photography involved much effort and experimentation aimed at improving gradation detail in photographs. Different materials were tested in producing lithographs and early photographs, with steady improvement in producing detailed gradation. In 1878, one photographer wrote: {{blockquote|The great defect of all the processes of photolithography described in the last section is that they can only be applied with advantage to the reproduction of drawings or subjects in which the gradation of shade is shown by lines or dots separated by white spaces of varying sizes and at varying intervals apart, as in line or stipple engravings and lithographs in line and chalk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The British Journal of Photography|date=2007|orig-year=First published 1878|volume=XXV|pages=518|author=J. Waterhouse, Capt.|publisher=Oxford University}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}
[[File:Halftone example CMYK.png|thumb|Example of a halftone reproduction of a photograph.]]
A major innovation was the development of [[halftone]] photography in the late 19th century. Halftone photography involves creating a reproduction of an original photograph by taking an image of it using a [[Photomechnical transfer camera (PMT)]], with a [[halftone screen]] as an intermediary tool to create gradation in the final reproduction. Halftone screens are a plate or film, made up of a continuous pattern of small dots, and when used in a photomechanical transfer camera, the halftone screen serves as an image filter. The invention of halftone photography was an important milestone, allowing photographs to be reproduced for mass publication in newspapers and magazines.

Analog photography is limited by the materials and equipment used by the photographer to capture gradation. These constraints are eliminated in digital photography, where software can be used to manipulate photograph images to create gradation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ralph Lambrecht |author2=Ralph W.

In [[anthropology]], '''High-context culture and low-context culture''' is a measure of how explicit the messages exchanged in a culture are, and how important the context is in communication. These concepts were first introduced by the [[anthropologist]] [[Edward T. Hall]]in his 1976 book ''[[Beyond Culture]]''. According to Hall, in a low-context culture, the message will be interpreted through just the words (whether written or spoken) and their explicit meaning. The responsibility to be understood is with the sender of the message, who must work to be clear and comprehensive. In a high-context culture, messages are also interpreted using tone of voice, gesture, silence or implied meaning, as well as context or situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.pacific.edu/sis/culture/pub/Context_Cultures_High_and_Lo.htm|title=1.4.6 - Context of Cultures: High and Low|website=www2.pacific.edu|access-date=2017-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, the receiver is expected to use the situation, messages and cultural norms to understand the message.

"High" and "low" context cultures are typically defined by language group, nationality, or regional community. However, they have also been applied to corporations, professions and other cultural groups, as well as settings such as online vs. offline communication.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wurtz|first=Elizabeth|date=2005|title=Intercultural Communication on Web sites: A Cross-Cultural Analysis of Web sites from High-Context Cultures and Low-Context Cultures|url=https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1083-6101.2006.tb00313.x|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|language=en|volume=11|issue=1|pages=274–299|doi=10.1111/j.1083-6101.2006.tb00313.x|issn=1083-6101|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Examples of Higher and Lower Context Cultures ==
Cultural contexts are not absolutely "high" or "low". Instead, a comparison between cultures may find communication differences to a greater or lesser degree. Typically a high-context culture will be relational, [[Collectivism#Culture and Politics|collectivist]], intuitive, and contemplative. They place a high value on interpersonal relationships and group members are a very close-knit community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Essentials of Business Communication|last=Guffey|first=Mary Ellen|publisher=South-Western/ Cengage Learning|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically a low-context culture will be less close-knit, and so individuals communicating will have fewer relational cues when interpreting messages. Therefore, it is necessary for more explicit information to be included in the message so it is not misinterpreted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.culture-at-work.com/highlow.html|title=High and Low Context|website=www.culture-at-work.com|access-date=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all individuals in a culture can be defined by cultural [[stereotype]]s, and there will be variations within a national culture in different settings. For example, Hall describes how Japanese culture has both low- and high- context situations.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Beyond culture|last=Hall|first=Edward T.|publisher=Doubleday|year=1976|isbn=9780385124744|location=New York|pages=68-69}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, understanding the broad tendencies of predominant cultures can help inform and educate individuals on how to better facilitate communication between individuals of differing cultures. 

Although the concept of high- and low-context cultures is usually applied in the field of analyzing national cultures, it can also be used to describe scientific or corporate cultures, or specific settings such as airports or law courts. A simplified example mentioned by Hall is that scientists working in "hard science" fields (like chemistry and physics) tend to have lower-context cultures: because their knowledge that has fewer variables, they will typically include less context for each event they describe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/20595709|title=Beyond culture|last=Hall|first=Edward T.|date=1989|publisher=Doubleday|year=|isbn=0385124740|edition=|location=New York|pages=87-88|oclc=20595709}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, scientists working with living systems need to include more context because there can be significant variables which impact the research outcomes. 

Cultures and languages are defined as higher or lower context on a spectrum. For example, it could be argued that [[French Canadian]] language is higher context than English Canadian, but lower context than [[Spanish language|Spanish]] or [[French language|French]].  An individual from [[Texas]] (a higher-context culture) may communicate with a few words or use of a prolonged silence, where a [[New York City|New Yorker]] would be very explicit, although both speak the same language (English) and are part of a nation (United States) which is lower-context relative to other nations. Hall notes a similar difference between [[Navajo language|Navajo]] speakers and English speakers in a United States school.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

Hall and Hall proposed a "spectrum" of national cultures from "High-Context cultures" to "Low-Context Cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/20259415|title=Understanding cultural differences|last=Hall|first=Edward T.|last2=Hall|first2=Mildred Reed|date=1990|publisher=Intercultural Press|others=|year=1990|isbn=093366284X|location=Yarmouth, Me.|pages=|oclc=20259415}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This has been expanded to further countries by Copeland &amp; Griggs (1985).&lt;ref name="Barrett2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Deborah Barrett|title=Leadership Communication|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_YD4vsPU4U0C&amp;pg=PA197|year=2006|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0-07-291849-6|page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/13560290|title=Going international : how to make friends and deal effectively in the global marketplace|last=Copeland,|first=Lennie|last2=Griggs|first2=Lewis|date=1985|publisher=New American Library|others=|year=1985|isbn=0452258642|location=New York|pages=|oclc=13560290}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:Higher-context culture: [[Afghan]]s, [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]], [[Arabic]], [[Brazilian people|Brazilian]], [[Chinese people|Chinese]], [[Filipinos]], [[French Canadian]], [[French people|French]], [[Greeks|Greek]], [[Hawaiian people|Hawaiian]], [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]], [[India]]n, [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], [[Italians|Italian]], [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Japanese people|Japanese]], [[Korean people|Korean]], [[Latin Americans]], [[Nepal]]i, [[Pakistani culture|Pakistani]], [[Persian people|Persian]], [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], [[Russian people|Russian]], [[Southern United States]], [[Spanish people|Spanish]], [[Thai people|Thai]], [[Turkish people|Turkish]], [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]], [[South Slavs|South Slavic]], [[Western Slavs|West Slavic]].
:Lower-context culture: [[Australian]], [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[English Canadian]], [[English people|English]], [[Finnish people|Finnish]], [[Germans|German]], [[Israelis|Israeli]], [[New Zealand]], [[Scandinavia]], [[Switzerland]], [[United States]].

Cultural context can also shift and evolve. For instance, a study has argued that both [[Japan]] and [[Finland]] (high-context cultures) are becoming lower-context with the increased influence of Western European and US culture.&lt;ref name="finland"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helsinki.fi/~tella/nishimuranevgitella299.pdf|title=Communication Style and Cultural Features in High/Low Context Communication Cultures: A Case Study of Finland, Japan and India|last=Nishimura|first=Shoji|last2=Nevgi|first2=Anne|publisher=Helsinki.fi|accessdate=December 23, 2014|last3=Tella|first3=Seppo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== How higher context relates to other cultural metrics ===

==== Diversity ====
Families, subcultures and in-groups typically favour higher-context communication.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Groups who are able to rely on their common background, may not need to use explicit words to understand each other. Settings and cultures where people come together from a wider diversity of backgrounds such as international airports, large cities, or [[Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory|multi-national firms]], tend user lower-context communication forms.

==== Language ====
Hall links language to culture through the work of [[Sapir-Worf|Sapir-Worfe]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A [[trade language]] will typically need to explicitly explain more of the context than a [[dialect]] which can assume a high level of shared context. Because a low-context setting cannot rely on shared understanding of potentially [[Ambiguity|ambiguous]] messages, low-context cultures tend to give more information, or to be precise in their language. In contrast, a high-context language like Japanese can use a high number of [[Homophone|homophones]] but still be understood by a listener who knows the context.&lt;ref name="finland" /&gt; 

===== Elaborated and restricted codes =====
The concept of elaborated and restricted codes is introduced by sociologist [[Basil Bernstein]] in his book ''Class, Codes and Control''.  An elaborated code indicates that the speaker is expressing his/her idea by phrasing from an abundant selection of alternatives without assuming the listener shares lots of common knowledge, which allows the speaker to explain their idea explicitly. While restricted codes are phrased from more limited alternatives, usually with collapsed and shortened sentences, therefore it requires the listeners to share a great deal of common perspectives to understand the implicit meaning of the conversation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bernstein|first1=Basil|title=Theoretical studies towards a sociology of language|date=2003|publisher=Routledge|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=0-415-30287-0|page=58|edition=Digital printing.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Restricted codes are commonly used in high-context culture groups, where people share same cultural background and can easily understand the implicit meanings between lines without further elaboration. Conversely, in cultural groups with low context, where people share little common knowledge or ‘value individuality above group identification’, detailed elaboration becomes essential to avoid misunderstanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Foss|first1=Stephen W. Littlejohn, Karen A.|title=Theories of human communication|date=2011|publisher=Waveland Press|location=Long Grove, Ill.|isbn=9781577667063|pages=375–376|edition=10th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Collectivism and individualism ====
The concepts of [[collectivism]] and [[individualism]] have been applied to high- and low-context cultures by [[Geert Hofstede|Hofstede]] in his [[Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory|Cultural Dimensions Theory]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Collectivist societies prioritise the group over the individual, and vice versa. In high-context cultures, language may be used to assist and maintain relationship building and to focus on process. India and Japan are typically high-context, highly collectivistic cultures, where business is done by building relationships and maintaining respectful communication.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/69872214|title=When cultures collide : leading across cultures : a major new edition of the global guide|last=D.|first=Lewis, Richard|date=2006|publisher=Nicholas Brealey International|year=|isbn=1423774582|edition=3rd|location=Boston|pages=436-437|oclc=69872214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individualistic cultures promote the development of individual values and independent social groups. Individualism may lead to communicating to all people in a group in the same way, rather than offering hierarchical respect to certain members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.slideshare.net/uncstaff/individualism-collectivism-high-and-low-context/6|title=Individualism, Collectivism, High And Low Context|date=12 January 2010|website=SlideShare|publisher=University of Montana, Undergraduate Advising Center|accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because individualistic cultures may value cultural difference, a more explicit way of communicating is required to avoid misunderstanding. Language may be used to achieve goals or exchange information. The USA and Australia are typically low-context, highly individualistic cultures, where transparency and competition in business are prized.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 

Individualism and collectivism have [[Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory|been criticised]] for being too unidimensional. 

==== Stability and durability of tradition====

High-context cultures tend to be more stable, as their communication is more economical, fast, efficient and satisfying, but it is gained at a price of devoting time into preprogramming cultural background, and its high stability might come with a price of a high barrier for development. Whereas low-context cultures tend to change rapidly and drastically, they allow extension to happen at an incredibly fast rate. But it also means that low-context communication may fail due to the overload of information, which makes culture lose its screening function.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Beyond culture|last1=Hall|first1=Edward T.|date=1989|publisher=Doubleday|year=|isbn=9780385124744|edition=|location=New York|pages=15-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, higher-context cultures tend to correlate with cultures that also have a strong sense of [[tradition]] and [[history]], and change little over time. For example, [[Native Americans in the United States]] have higher-context cultures with a strong sense of tradition and history. The focus on tradition creates opportunities for higher context messages between individuals of each new generation, and the high- context culture feeds back to the stability hence allows the tradition to be maintained. This is in contrast to lower-context cultures in which the shared experiences upon which communication is built can change drastically from one generation to the next, creating communication gaps between parents and children, as in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Facial expression and gesture ====

Culture also affects how individuals interpret other people’s facial expression. Experiment done by the University of Glasgow shows that different cultures have different understanding of the facial expression signals of the six basic emotions, which are the so-called “universal language of emotion”—happy, surprise, fear, disgust, anger and sadness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-10-01|title=Discovering cultural differences (and similarities) in facial expressions of emotion|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352250X16302007|journal=Current Opinion in Psychology|language=en|volume=17|pages=61–66|doi=10.1016/j.copsyc.2017.06.010|issn=2352-250X}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jack|first=Rachael E.|last2=Schyns|first2=Philippe G.|date=2015|title=The Human Face as a Dynamic Tool for Social Communication|url=https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(15)00655-7?_returnURL=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0960982215006557?showall=true|journal=Current Biology|language=English|volume=25|issue=14|pages=R621–R634|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2015.05.052|issn=0960-9822|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In high-context cultures, facial expression and gesture take on greater importance in understanding the message, and the receiver may require more cultural context to understand "basic" displays of emotions. 

==== Marketing and advertising perspective ====
Cultural differences in advertising and marketing may also be explained through high- and low-context cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=ajDiBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=consumer%20behaviour%20Solomon%20Japan&amp;pg=PA366#v=snippet&amp;q=high%20context&amp;f=false|title=Consumer Behaviour|last=Solomon|first=Michael|last2=Russell-Bennett|first2=Rebekah|last3=Previte|first3=Josephine|date=2012-10-24|publisher=Pearson Higher Education AU|isbn=9781442564992|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study on McDonald's online advertising compared Japan, China, Korea, Hong Kong, Pakistan, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, and the United States, and found that in high-context countries, the advertising used more colors, movements, and sounds to give context, while in low-context cultures the advertising focused more on verbal information and linear processes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A '''Hollywood novel''' is a [[novel]] that takes the [[Southern California]] [[motion picture]] industry as its setting and often its subject. Examples of Hollywood novels include ''The Day of the Locust'' by [[Nathanael West]], ''What Makes Sammy Run'' by [[Budd Schulberg]], ''The Last Tycoon'' by [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]], ''After Many A Summer Dies the Swan'' by [[Aldous Huxley]], ''Inside Daisy Clover'' by [[Gavin Lambert]], ''The Deer Park'' by [[Norman Mailer]], ''I Should Have Stayed Home'' by [[Horace McCoy]], Michael Tolkin's ''The Player'' and ''The Return of the Player'', and  Joan Didion's ''Play It As It Lays''. Novels set in [[Los Angeles]] but not primarily about the movie business and its effect on movie people and the public are not properly called Hollywood novels.

==Background and Perception of Hollywood Novels==

Many novelists such as [[William Faulkner]] and [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] took jobs writing screenplays in Hollywood since they made more money. But many novelists such as them soon felt the film industry made them so miserable, and wrote novels detailing fictionalized versions of their experiences. Often some of these novels would revolve around some bitter screenwriter or producer who believed they were screwed over by some studio executive. And these same novels often took place during the [[Golden Age of Hollywood]] in the 1930s-1940's.

==The Last Tycoon==

''[[The Last Tycoon]]'' is an unfinished novel written by Fitzgerald, but left incomplete before his death about a studio executive Monroe Stahr, and later adapted into [[The Last Tycoon (1976 film)|The Last Tycoon]] starring [[Robert De Niro]]. Stahr is living for his job, focusing on nothing else but work, and is now suffering from a heart condition. The point of view of this novel is told through Cecelia Brady, the daughter of one of Stahr’s fellow executives. She flirts with him, and wants to start some kind of love affair, but he is too wrapped up in his work to even try to think of her in romantic fashion.

==What Makes Sammy Run?==

[[What Makes Sammy Run?]], written by [[Budd Schulberg]], is told from the point of view of New York Times drama critic Al Manheim. It focuses on a 16-year-old Jewish boy named Sammy Glick, who rises out of the ghetto in New York to become a hot in demand screenwriter in Hollywood. The two become good friends almost from the start, but Al soon realizes that Sammy is a ruthless backstabber.

==Hollywood Wives and Other Perceptions==

[[Hollywood Wives (novel)|Hollywood Wives]] was a novel written bestselling author [[Jackie Collins]], and was from the point of view of several wives of screenwriters and producers, detailing how their wives dealt with the Hollywood lifestyle along with how it affected them. A couple years after the novel’s release, it was turned into a made for television miniseries by [[Aaron Spelling]], and was a huge hit for the ABC network. It was also most popular miniseries during the 1980s. Spelling also produced the hit television show ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]'', which starred the author’s sister, [[Joan Collins]], who played the iconic role of Alexis Carrington in the series.

The '''International Year of the Monument''' is a commemorative date created by [[UNESCO]] in 1964. The implementation of the date was to give a better global coverage in the perception of the monument as a building or historical site of exemplary character, for its significance in the life trajectory of a society / community and its There are monuments built especially to celebrate or reminisce about an episode, moment or character of our history, created by architects, sculptors, artists, etc. Others are remnants of the past that survived the time and are consecrated By society as collective symbols, and as references of the memory of a people.&lt;ref&gt;HORTA, M.

==Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage==
The [[Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage]] defines monument as:
monuments: architectural works, works of monumental sculpture and painting, elements or structures of an archaeological nature, inscriptions, cave dwellings and combinations of features, which are of outstanding universal value from the point of view of history, art or science

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="43134">In [[psychometrics]], '''item response theory''' ('''IRT''') (also known as '''latent trait theory''', '''strong true score theory''', or '''modern mental test theory''') is a paradigm for the design, analysis, and scoring of [[Test (student assessment)|tests]], [[questionnaire]]s, and similar instruments [[measurement|measuring]] abilities, attitudes, or other variables. It is a theory of testing based on the relationship between individuals' performances on a test item and the test takers' levels of performance on an overall measure of the ability that item was designed to measure. Several different statistical models are used to represent both item and test taker characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;National Council on Measurement in Education http://www.ncme.org/ncme/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary1.aspx?hkey=4bb87415-44dc-4088-9ed9-e8515326a061#anchorI {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170722194028/http://www.ncme.org/ncme/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary1.aspx?hkey=4bb87415-44dc-4088-9ed9-e8515326a061#anchorI |date=2017-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike simpler alternatives for creating scales and evaluating questionnaire responses, it does not assume that each item is equally difficult. This distinguishes IRT from, for instance, [[Likert scaling]], in which ''"''All items are assumed to be replications of each other or in other words items are considered to be parallel instruments"&lt;ref name="vanAlphen1994"&gt;A. van Alphen, R. Halfens, A. Hasman and T. Imbos. (1994). Likert or Rasch? Nothing is more applicable than good theory. ''Journal of Advanced Nursing''. '''20''', 196-201&lt;/ref&gt; (p.&amp;nbsp;197). By contrast, item response theory treats the difficulty of each item (the item characteristic curves, or [[#The_item_response_function|ICCs]]) as information to be incorporated in scaling items. 

It is based on the application of related [[mathematical model]]s to testing [[data]].  Because it is often regarded as superior to [[classical test theory]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Susan E. |last1=Embretson |first2=Steven P. |last2=Reise |title=Item Response Theory for Psychologists |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rYU7rsi53gQC |year=2000 |publisher=Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is the preferred method for developing scales in the United States,{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} especially when optimal decisions are demanded, as in so-called [[High-stakes testing|high-stakes tests]], e.g., the [[Graduate Record Examination]] (GRE) and [[Graduate Management Admission Test]] (GMAT).

The name ''item response theory'' is due to the focus of the theory on the item, as opposed to the test-level focus of classical test theory. Thus IRT models the response of each examinee of a given ability to each item in the test. The term ''item'' is generic, covering all kinds of informative items. They might be [[multiple choice]] questions that have incorrect and correct responses, but are also commonly statements on questionnaires that allow respondents to indicate level of agreement (a [[rating scale|rating]] or [[Likert scale]]), or patient symptoms scored as present/absent, or diagnostic information in complex systems.

IRT is based on the idea that the [[probability]] of a correct/keyed response to an item is a [[mathematical function]] of person and item [[parameters]]. The person parameter is construed as (usually) a single latent trait or dimension. Examples include general [[intelligence]] or the strength of an attitude. Parameters on which items are characterized include their difficulty (known as "location" for their location on the difficulty range); discrimination (slope or correlation), representing how steeply the rate of success of individuals varies with their ability; and a pseudoguessing parameter, characterising the (lower) [[asymptote]] at which even the least able persons will score due to guessing (for instance, 25% for pure chance on a multiple choice item with four possible responses).

In the same manner, IRT can be used to measure human behaviour in online social networks. The views expressed by different people can be aggregated to be studied using IRT. Its use in classifying information as  misinformation or true information has also been evaluated.

==Overview==
{{refimprove section|date=December 2015}}
The concept of the item response function was around before 1950.  The pioneering work of IRT as a theory occurred during the 1950s and 1960s.  Three of the pioneers were the [[Educational Testing Service]] psychometrician [[Frederic M. Lord]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ets.org/portal/site/ets/menuitem.c988ba0e5dd572bada20bc47c3921509/?vgnextoid=26fdaf5e44df4010VgnVCM10000022f95190RCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=ceb2be3a864f4010VgnVCM10000022f95190RCRD ETS Research Overview]&lt;/ref&gt; the Danish mathematician [[Georg Rasch]], and Austrian sociologist [[Paul Lazarsfeld]], who pursued parallel research independently.  Key figures who furthered the progress of IRT include [[Benjamin Drake Wright]] and [[David Andrich]]. IRT did not become widely used until the late 1970s and 1980s, when practitioners were told the "usefulness" and "advantages" of IRT on the one hand, and [[personal computer]]s gave many researchers access to the computing power necessary for IRT on the other.

Among other things, the purpose of IRT is to provide a framework for evaluating how well assessments work, and how well individual items on assessments work. The most common application of IRT is in education, where psychometricians use it for developing and designing [[Test (student assessment)|exams]], maintaining banks of items for exams, and [[equating]] the difficulties of items for successive versions of exams (for example, to allow comparisons between results over time).&lt;ref&gt;Hambleton, R. K., Swaminathan, H., &amp; Rogers, H. J. (1991). ''Fundamentals of Item Response Theory''. Newbury Park, CA: Sage Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

IRT models are often referred to as ''latent trait models''. The term ''latent'' is used to emphasize that discrete item responses are taken to be ''observable manifestations'' of hypothesized traits, constructs, or attributes, not directly observed, but which must be inferred from the manifest responses.  Latent trait models were developed in the field of sociology, but are virtually identical to IRT models.

IRT is generally claimed as an improvement over [[classical test theory]] (CTT).  For tasks that can be accomplished using CTT, IRT generally brings greater flexibility and provides more sophisticated information.  Some applications, such as [[Computer-adaptive test|computerized adaptive testing]], are enabled by IRT and cannot reasonably be performed using only classical test theory.  Another advantage of IRT over CTT is that the more sophisticated information IRT provides allows a researcher to improve the [[Reliability (psychometric)|reliability]] of an assessment.

IRT entails three assumptions:

#  A unidimensional trait denoted by &lt;math&gt;{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; ;
#  [[Local independence]] of items;
#  The response of a person to an item can be modeled by a mathematical ''item response function'' (IRF).

The trait is further assumed to be measurable on a scale (the mere existence of a test assumes this), typically set to a standard scale with a [[mean]] of 0.0 and a [[standard deviation]] of 1.0.  Unidimensionality should be interpreted as homogeneity, a quality that should be defined or empirically demonstrated in relation to a given purpose or use, but not a quantity that can be measured. 'Local independence' means (a) that the chance of one item being used is not related to any other item(s) being used and (b) that response to an item is each and every test-taker's independent decision, that is, there is no cheating or pair or group work.  The topic of dimensionality is often investigated with [[factor analysis]], while the IRF is the basic building block of IRT and is the center of much of the research and literature.

==The item response function==
The IRF gives the probability that a person with a given ability level will answer correctly. Persons with lower ability have less of a chance, while persons with high ability are very likely to answer correctly; for example, students with higher math ability are more likely to get a math item correct. The exact value of the probability depends, in addition to ability, on a set of ''item parameters'' for the IRF.

===Three parameter logistic model===
[[File:3PL IRF.png|220x220px|Figure 1: Example of 3PL IRF, with dotted lines overlaid to demonstrate parameters.|thumb]]
For example, in the '''three parameter logistic model''' ('''3PL'''), the probability of a correct response to a dichotomous item ''i'', usually a multiple-choice question,  is:

:&lt;math&gt;
p_i({\theta})=c_i + \frac{1-c_i}{1+e^{-a_i({\theta}-b_i)}}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; indicates that the person abilities are modeled as a sample from a normal distribution for the purpose of estimating the item parameters. After the item parameters have been estimated, the abilities of individual person are estimated for reporting purposes. &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b_i&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt; are the item parameters. The item parameters determine the shape of the IRF. Figure 1 depicts an ideal 3PL ICC.

The item parameters can be interpreted as changing the shape of the standard [[logistic function]]:
:&lt;math&gt;P(t)=\frac{1}{1+e^{-t}}.&lt;/math&gt;
In brief, the parameters are interpreted as follows (dropping subscripts for legibility); ''b'' is most basic, hence listed first:
* ''b'' – difficulty, item location: &lt;math&gt;p(b) = (1+c)/2,&lt;/math&gt; the half-way point between &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt; (min) and 1 (max), also where the slope is maximized.
* ''a'' – discrimination, scale, slope: the maximum slope &lt;math&gt;p'(b) = a \cdot (1-c)/4.&lt;/math&gt;
* ''c'' – pseudo-guessing, chance, asymptotic minimum &lt;math&gt;p(-\infty) = c.&lt;/math&gt;
If &lt;math&gt;c = 0,&lt;/math&gt; then these simplify to &lt;math&gt;p(b) = 1/2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p'(b) = a/4,&lt;/math&gt; meaning that ''b'' equals the 50% success level (difficulty), and ''a'' (divided by four) is the maximum slope (discrimination), which occurs at the 50% success level. Further, the [[logit]] (log [[odds]]) of a correct response is &lt;math&gt;a(\theta-b)&lt;/math&gt; (assuming &lt;math&gt;c=0&lt;/math&gt;): in particular if ability ''θ'' equals difficulty ''b,'' there are even odds (1:1, so logit 0) of a correct answer, the greater the ability is above (or below) the difficulty the more (or less) likely a correct response, with discrimination ''a'' determining how rapidly the odds increase or decrease with ability.

In other words, the standard logistic function has an asymptotic minimum of 0 (&lt;math&gt;c=0&lt;/math&gt;), is centered around 0 (&lt;math&gt;b = 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;P(0) = 1/2&lt;/math&gt;), and has maximum slope &lt;math&gt;P'(0)=1/4.&lt;/math&gt; The &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; parameter stretches the horizontal scale, the &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; parameter shifts the horizontal scale, and the &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; compresses the vertical scale from &lt;math&gt;[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;[c,1].&lt;/math&gt; This is elaborated below.

The parameter &lt;math&gt;b_i&lt;/math&gt; represents the item location which, in the case of attainment testing, is referred to as the item difficulty. It is the point on &lt;math&gt;{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; where the IRF has its maximum slope, and where the value is half-way between the minimum value of &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt; and the maximum value of 1. The example item is of medium difficulty since &lt;math&gt;b_i&lt;/math&gt;=0.0, which is near the center of the distribution. Note that this model scales the item's difficulty and the person's trait onto the same continuum. Thus, it is valid to talk about an item being about as hard as Person A's trait level or of a person's trait level being about the same as Item Y's difficulty, in the sense that successful performance of the task involved with an item reflects a specific level of ability.

The item parameter &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt; represents the discrimination of the item: that is, the degree to which the item discriminates between persons in different regions on the latent continuum. This parameter characterizes the slope of the IRF where the slope is at its maximum. The example item has &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt;=1.0, which discriminates fairly well; persons with low ability do indeed have a much smaller chance of correctly responding than persons of higher ability.

For items such as [[multiple choice]] items, the parameter &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt; is used in attempt to account for the effects of guessing on the probability of a correct response. It indicates the probability that very low ability individuals will get this item correct by chance, mathematically represented as a lower [[asymptote]]. A four-option multiple choice item might have an IRF like the example item; there is a 1/4 chance of an extremely low ability candidate guessing the correct answer, so the &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt; would be approximately 0.25. This approach assumes that all options are equally plausible, because if one option made no sense, even the lowest ability person would be able to discard it, so IRT parameter estimation methods take this into account and estimate a &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt; based on the observed data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bock |first1=R.D. |last2=Aitkin |first2=M. |title=Marginal maximum likelihood estimation of item parameters: application of an EM algorithm |journal=Psychometrika |volume=46 |issue=4 |pages=443–459 |year=1981 |doi=10.1007/BF02293801 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/c676744078511265/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==IRT models==
Broadly speaking, IRT models can be divided into two families: unidimensional and multidimensional.  Unidimensional models require a single trait (ability) dimension &lt;math&gt;{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;.  Multidimensional IRT models model response data hypothesized to arise from multiple traits.  However, because of the greatly increased complexity, the majority of IRT research and applications utilize a unidimensional model.

IRT models can also be categorized based on the number of scored responses.  The typical [[multiple choice]] item is ''dichotomous''; even though there may be four or five options, it is still scored only as correct/incorrect (right/wrong).  Another class of models apply to ''polytomous'' outcomes, where each response has a different score value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Remo |last1=Ostini |first2=Michael L. |last2=Nering |title=Polytomous Item Response Theory Models |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wS8VEMtJ3UYC |year=2005 |publisher=SAGE| isbn=978-0-7619-3068-6 |series=Quantitative Applications in the Social Sciences |volume=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Michael L. |editor1-last=Nering |editor2-first=Remo |editor2-last=Ostini |title=Handbook of polytomous item response theory models |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M2NYAAAAYAAJ |year=2010 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-0-8058-5992-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common example of this is [[Likert scale|Likert]]-type items, e.g., "Rate on a scale of 1 to 5."

===Number of IRT parameters===
Dichotomous IRT models are described by the number of parameters they make use of.&lt;ref&gt;Thissen, D. &amp; Orlando, M. (2001).  Item response theory for items scored in two categories.  In D. Thissen &amp; Wainer, H. (Eds.), ''Test Scoring'' (pp. 73-140).  Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;  The 3PL is named so because it employs three item parameters.  The two-parameter model (2PL) assumes that the data have no guessing, but that items can vary in terms of location (&lt;math&gt;b_i&lt;/math&gt;) and discrimination (&lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt;).  The one-parameter model (1PL) assumes that guessing is a part of the ability and that all items that fit the model have equivalent discriminations, so that items are only described by a single parameter (&lt;math&gt;b_i&lt;/math&gt;). This results in one-parameter models having the property of specific objectivity, meaning that the rank of the item difficulty is the same for all respondents independent of ability, and that the rank of the person ability is the same for items independently of difficulty. Thus, 1 parameter models are sample independent, a property that does not hold for two-parameter and three-parameter models.  Additionally, there is theoretically a four-parameter model (4PL), with an upper [[asymptote]], denoted by &lt;math&gt;d_i,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;1-c_i&lt;/math&gt; in the 3PL is replaced by &lt;math&gt;d_i-c_i&lt;/math&gt;.  However, this is rarely used.  Note that the alphabetical order of the item parameters does not match their practical or psychometric importance; the location/difficulty (&lt;math&gt;b_i&lt;/math&gt;) parameter is clearly most important because it is included in all three models.  The 1PL uses only &lt;math&gt;b_i&lt;/math&gt;, the 2PL uses &lt;math&gt;b_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt;, the 3PL adds &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt;, and the 4PL adds &lt;math&gt;d_i&lt;/math&gt;.

The 2PL is equivalent to the 3PL model with &lt;math&gt;c_i = 0&lt;/math&gt;, and is appropriate for testing items where guessing the correct answer is highly unlikely, such as fill-in-the-blank items ("What is the square root of 121?"), or where the concept of guessing does not apply, such as personality, attitude, or interest items (e.g., "I like Broadway musicals. Agree/Disagree").

The 1PL assumes not only that guessing is not present (or irrelevant), but that all items are equivalent in terms of discrimination, analogous to a common [[factor analysis]] with identical loadings for all items.  Individual items or individuals might have secondary factors but these are assumed to be mutually independent and collectively [[orthogonal]].

===Logistic and normal IRT models===
An alternative formulation constructs IRFs based on the normal probability distribution; these are sometimes called ''normal [[ogive (statistics)|ogive]] models''.  For example, the formula for a two-parameter normal-ogive IRF is:

:&lt;math&gt;
p_i(\theta)= \Phi \left( \frac{\theta-b_i}{\sigma_i} \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

where '''Φ''' is the [[cumulative distribution function]] (cdf) of the standard normal distribution.

The normal-ogive model derives from the assumption of normally distributed measurement error and is theoretically appealing on that basis. Here &lt;math&gt;b_i&lt;/math&gt; is, again, the difficulty parameter.  The discrimination parameter is &lt;math&gt;{\sigma}_i&lt;/math&gt;, the standard deviation of the measurement error for item ''i'', and comparable to 1/''&lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt;.

One can estimate a normal-ogive latent trait model by factor-analyzing a matrix of tetrachoric correlations between items.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Gustav Jöreskog|K. G. Jöreskog]] and D. Sörbom(1988). ''PRELIS 1 user's manual, version 1''.  Chicago: Scientific Software, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;  This means it is technically possible to estimate a simple IRT model using general-purpose statistical software.

With rescaling of the ability parameter, it is possible to make the 2PL logistic model closely approximate the [[cumulative normal]] [[ogive]].  Typically, the 2PL logistic and normal-ogive IRFs differ in probability by no more than 0.01 across the range of the function. The difference is greatest in the distribution tails, however, which tend to have more influence on results.

The latent trait/IRT model was originally developed using normal ogives, but this was considered too computationally demanding for the computers at the time (1960s).  The logistic model was proposed as a simpler alternative, and has enjoyed wide use since.  More recently, however, it was demonstrated that, using standard polynomial approximations to the normal ''cdf,''&lt;ref&gt;Abramowitz M., Stegun I.A. (1972). ''Handbook of Mathematical Functions''. Washington DC: U. S. Government Printing Office.&lt;/ref&gt; the normal-ogive model is no more computationally demanding than logistic models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Uebersax |first=J.S. |title=Probit latent class analysis with dichotomous or ordered category measures: conditional independence/dependence models |journal=Applied Psychological Measurement |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=283–297 |date=December 1999 |doi=10.1177/01466219922031400 |url=http://apm.sagepub.com/content/23/4/283.short}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Rasch model===
The [[Rasch model]] is often considered to be the 1PL IRT model.  However, proponents of Rasch modeling prefer to view it as a completely different approach to conceptualizing the relationship between data and theory.&lt;ref&gt;Andrich, D (1989), Distinctions between assumptions and requirements in measurement in the Social sciences", in Keats, J.A, Taft, R., Heath, R.A, Lovibond, S (Eds), ''Mathematical and Theoretical Systems'', Elsevier Science Publishers, North Holland, Amsterdam, pp.7-16.&lt;/ref&gt;  Like other statistical modeling approaches, IRT emphasizes the primacy of the fit of a model to observed data,&lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, J. (2000). Frederic Lord, Who Devised Testing Yardstick, Dies at 87.  New York Times, February 10, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; while the Rasch model emphasizes the primacy of the requirements for fundamental measurement, with adequate data-model fit being an important but secondary requirement to be met before a test or research instrument can be claimed to measure a trait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Andrich |first=D. |title=Controversy and the Rasch model: a characteristic of incompatible paradigms? |journal=Medical Care |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=I–7 |date=January 2004 |pmid=14707751 |url=http://journals.lww.com/lww-medicalcare/Abstract/2004/01001/Controversy_and_the_Rasch_Model__A_Characteristic.2.aspx |doi=10.1097/01.mlr.0000103528.48582.7c}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Operationally, this means that the IRT approaches include additional model parameters to reflect the patterns observed in the data (e.g., allowing items to vary in their correlation with the latent trait), whereas in the Rasch approach, claims regarding the presence of a latent trait can only be considered valid when both (a) the data fit the Rasch model, and (b) test items and examinees conform to the model. Therefore, under Rasch models, misfitting responses require diagnosis of the reason for the misfit, and may be excluded from the data set if one can explain substantively why they do not address the latent trait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Smith |first=R.M. |title=Theory and practice of fit |journal=Rasch Measurement Transactions |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=78 |year=1990 |url=http://rasch.org/rmt/rmt34b.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the Rasch approach can be seen to be a confirmatory approach, as opposed to exploratory approaches that attempt to model the observed data.  As in any confirmatory analysis, care must be taken to avoid [[confirmation bias]].

The presence or absence of a guessing or pseudo-chance parameter is a major and sometimes controversial distinction.  The IRT approach includes a left asymptote parameter to account for guessing in [[multiple choice]] examinations, while the Rasch model does not because it is assumed that guessing adds randomly distributed noise to the data. As the noise is randomly distributed, it is assumed that, provided sufficient items are tested, the rank-ordering of persons along the latent trait by raw score will not change, but will simply undergo a linear rescaling.  By contrast, three-parameter IRT achieves data-model fit by selecting a model that fits the data,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zwick |first1=R. |last2=Thayer |first2=D.T. |last3=Wingersky |first3=M. |title=Effect of Rasch calibration on ability and DIF estimation in computer-adaptive tests |journal=Journal of Educational Measurement |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=341–363 |date=December 1995 |doi=10.1111/j.1745-3984.1995.tb00471.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1745-3984.1995.tb00471.x/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the expense of sacrificing [[specific objectivity]].

In practice, the Rasch model has at least two principal advantages in comparison to the IRT approach.  The first advantage is the primacy of Rasch's specific requirements,&lt;ref&gt;Rasch, G. (1960/1980).  ''Probabilistic models for some intelligence and attainment tests''. (Copenhagen, Danish Institute for Educational Research), expanded edition (1980) with foreword and afterword by B.D. Wright.  Chicago: The University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; which (when met) provides ''fundamental'' person-free measurement (where persons and items can be mapped onto the same invariant scale).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wright |first=B.D. |title=IRT in the 1990s: Which Models Work Best? |journal=Rasch measurement transactions |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=196–200 |year=1992 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another advantage of the Rasch approach is that estimation of parameters is more straightforward in Rasch models due to the presence of sufficient statistics, which in this application means a one-to-one mapping of raw number-correct scores to Rasch &lt;math&gt;{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; estimates.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, G.H. &amp; Molenaar, I.W. (1995).  ''Rasch Models: Foundations, Recent Developments, and Applications''.  New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis of model fit==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2014}}
As with any use of mathematical models, it is important to assess the fit of the data to the model.  If item misfit with any model is diagnosed as due to poor item quality, for example confusing distractors in a multiple-choice test, then the items may be removed from that test form and rewritten or replaced in future test forms. If, however, a large number of misfitting items occur with no apparent reason for the misfit, the construct validity of the test will need to be reconsidered and the test specifications may need to be rewritten. Thus, misfit provides invaluable diagnostic tools for test developers, allowing the hypotheses upon which test specifications are based to be empirically tested against data.

There are several methods for assessing fit, such as a [[Chi-square statistic]], or a standardized version of it.  Two and three-parameter IRT models adjust item discrimination, ensuring improved data-model fit, so fit statistics lack the confirmatory diagnostic value found in one-parameter models, where the idealized model is specified in advance.

Data should not be removed on the basis of misfitting the model, but rather because a construct relevant reason for the misfit has been diagnosed, such as a non-native speaker of English taking a science test written in English. Such a candidate can be argued to not belong to the same population of persons depending on the dimensionality of the test, and, although one parameter IRT measures are argued to be sample-independent, they are not population independent, so misfit such as this is construct relevant and does not invalidate the test or the model. Such an approach is an essential tool in instrument validation. In two and three-parameter models, where the psychometric model is adjusted to fit the data, future administrations of the test must be checked for fit to the same model used in the initial validation in order to confirm the hypothesis that scores from each administration generalize to other administrations. If a different model is specified for each administration in order to achieve data-model fit, then a different latent trait is being measured and test scores cannot be argued to be comparable between administrations.

==Information==
One of the major contributions of item response theory is the extension of the concept of [[reliability (statistics)|reliability]].  Traditionally, reliability refers to the precision of measurement (i.e., the degree to which measurement is free of error).  Traditionally, it is measured using a single index defined in various ways, such as the ratio of true and observed score variance.  This index is helpful in characterizing a test's average reliability, for example in order to compare two tests.  But IRT makes it clear that precision is not uniform across the entire range of test scores.  Scores at the edges of the test's range, for example, generally have more error associated with them than scores closer to the middle of the range.

Item response theory advances the concept of item and test information to replace reliability.  Information is also a ''function'' of the model parameters. For example, according to [[Fisher information]] theory, the item information supplied in the case of the 1PL for dichotomous response data is simply the probability of a correct response multiplied by the probability of an incorrect response, or,

:&lt;math&gt;
I(\theta)=p_i(\theta) q_i(\theta).\,
&lt;/math&gt;

The [[standard error of estimation]] (SE) is the reciprocal of the test information of at a given trait level, is the

:&lt;math&gt;
\text{SE}(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{I(\theta)}}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus more information implies less error of measurement.

For other models, such as the two and three parameters models, the discrimination parameter plays an important role in the function. The item information function for the two parameter model is

:&lt;math&gt;
I(\theta)=a_i^2 p_i(\theta) q_i(\theta).\,
&lt;/math&gt;

The item information function for the three parameter model is

:&lt;math&gt;
I(\theta)=a_i^2 \frac{(p_i(\theta) - c_i)^2}{(1 - c_i)^2} \frac{q_i(\theta)}{p_i(\theta)}.
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
de Ayala, R.J. (2009). ''The Theory and Practice of Item Response Theory'', New York, NY: The Guilford Press. (6.12), p.144
&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, item information functions tend to look bell-shaped. Highly discriminating items have tall, narrow information functions; they contribute greatly but over a narrow range.  Less discriminating items provide less information but over a wider range.

Plots of item information can be used to see how much information an item contributes and to what portion of the scale score range.  Because of local independence, item information functions are [[additive map|additive]].  Thus, the test information function is simply the sum of the information functions of the items on the exam.  Using this property with a large item bank, test information functions can be shaped to control [[measurement error]] very precisely.

Characterizing the [[accuracy]] of test scores is perhaps the central issue in psychometric theory and is a chief difference between IRT and CTT. IRT findings reveal that the CTT concept of reliability is a simplification. In the place of reliability, IRT offers the test information function which shows the degree of precision at different values of theta, θ.

These results allow psychometricians to (potentially) carefully shape the level of reliability for different ranges of ability by including carefully chosen items. For example, in a [[certification]] situation in which a test can only be passed or failed, where there is only a single "cutscore," and where the actually passing score is unimportant, a very efficient test can be developed by selecting only items that have high information near the cutscore. These items generally correspond to items whose difficulty is about the same as that of the cutscore.

==Scoring==
The person parameter &lt;math&gt;{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; represents the magnitude of ''latent trait'' of the individual, which is the human capacity or attribute measured by the test.&lt;ref&gt;Lazarsfeld P.F, &amp; Henry N.W. (1968). ''Latent Structure Analysis''. Boston: Houghton Mifflin.&lt;/ref&gt;  It might be a cognitive ability, physical ability, skill, knowledge, attitude, personality characteristic, etc.

The estimate of the person parameter - the "score" on a test with IRT - is computed and interpreted in a very different manner as compared to traditional scores like number or percent correct.  The individual's total number-correct score is not the actual score, but is rather based on the IRFs, leading to a weighted score when the model contains item discrimination parameters.  It is actually obtained by multiplying the item response function for each item to obtain a ''likelihood function'', the highest point of which is the ''maximum likelihood estimate'' of &lt;math&gt;{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;.  This highest point is typically estimated with IRT software using the [[Newton-Raphson]] method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.assess.com/docs/Thompson_(2009)_-_Ability_estimation_with_IRT.pdf | title=Ability estimation with IRT |last=Thompson |first=N.A. |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While scoring is much more sophisticated with IRT, for most tests, the (linear) [[correlation]] between the theta estimate and a traditional score is very high; often it is .95 or more.  A graph of IRT scores against traditional scores shows an ogive shape implying that the IRT estimates separate individuals at the borders of the range more than in the middle.

An important difference between CTT and IRT is the treatment of measurement error, indexed by the [[standard error of measurement]].  All tests, questionnaires, and inventories are imprecise tools; we can never know a person's ''true score'', but rather only have an estimate, the ''observed score.'' There is some amount of random error which may push the observed score higher or lower than the true score.  CTT assumes that the amount of error is the same for each examinee, but IRT allows it to vary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kolen |first1=Michael J. |last2=Zeng |first2=Lingjia |last3=Hanson |first3=Bradley A. |title=Conditional Standard Errors of Measurement for Scale Scores Using IRT |journal=Journal of Educational Measurement |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=129–140 |date=June 1996 |doi=10.1111/j.1745-3984.1996.tb00485.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1745-3984.1996.tb00485.x/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, nothing about IRT refutes human development or improvement or assumes that a trait level is fixed.  A person may learn skills, knowledge or even so called "test-taking skills" which may translate to a higher true-score. In fact, a portion of IRT research focuses on the measurement of change in trait level.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, L.A., &amp; McDonald, J.L. (2000). ''[http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED441789&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED441789 Measuring Change in Teachers' Perceptions of the Impact that Staff Development Has on Teaching.]'' Paper presented at the Annual Meeting of the American Educational Research Association (New Orleans, LA, April 24–28, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

==A comparison of classical and item response theories==
[[Classical test theory]] (CTT) and IRT are largely concerned with the same problems but are different bodies of theory and entail different methods.  Although the two paradigms are generally consistent and complementary, there are a number of points of difference:

*IRT makes stronger assumptions than CTT and in many cases provides correspondingly stronger findings; primarily, characterizations of error. Of course, these results only hold when the assumptions of the IRT models are actually met.
*Although CTT results have allowed important practical results, the model-based nature of IRT affords many advantages over analogous CTT findings.
*CTT test scoring procedures have the advantage of being simple to compute (and to explain) whereas IRT scoring generally requires relatively complex estimation procedures.
*IRT provides several improvements in scaling items and people. The specifics depend upon the IRT model, but most models scale the difficulty of items and the ability of people on the same metric. Thus the difficulty of an item and the ability of a person can be meaningfully compared.
*Another improvement provided by IRT is that the parameters of IRT models are generally not sample- or test-dependent whereas true-score is defined in CTT in the context of a specific test. Thus IRT provides significantly greater flexibility in situations where different samples or test forms are used. These IRT findings are foundational for computerized adaptive testing.

It is worth also mentioning some specific similarities between CTT and IRT which help to understand the correspondence between concepts. First, Lord&lt;ref&gt;Lord, F.M. (1980). ''Applications of item response theory to practical testing problems''. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; showed that under the assumption that &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is normally distributed, discrimination in the 2PL model is approximately a [[monotonic function]] of the [[Point-biserial correlation coefficient|point-biserial correlation]]. In particular:

:&lt;math&gt;
a_i \cong \frac{\rho_{it}}{\sqrt{1-\rho_{it}^2}}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\rho_{it}&lt;/math&gt; is the point biserial correlation of item ''i''. Thus, if the assumption holds, where there is a higher discrimination there will generally be a higher point-biserial correlation.

Another similarity is that while IRT provides for a standard error of each estimate and an information function, it is also possible to obtain an index for a test as a whole which is directly analogous to [[Cronbach's alpha]], called the ''separation index''.  To do so, it is necessary to begin with a decomposition of an IRT estimate into a true location and error, analogous to decomposition of an observed score into a true score and error in CTT.  Let

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{\theta} = \theta + \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the true location, and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is the error association with an estimate.  Then &lt;math&gt;\mbox{SE}({\theta})&lt;/math&gt; is an estimate of the standard deviation of &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; for person with a given weighted score and the separation index is obtained as follows

:&lt;math&gt;
R_\theta = \frac{\text{var}[\theta]}{\text{var}[\hat{\theta}]} = \frac{\text{var} [\hat{\theta}] - \text{var}[\epsilon]}{\text{var}[\hat{\theta}]}
&lt;/math&gt;

where the mean squared standard error of person estimate gives an estimate of the variance of the errors, &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_n&lt;/math&gt;, across persons. The standard errors are normally produced as a by-product of the estimation process.  The separation index is typically very close in value to Cronbach's alpha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Andrich |first=D. |title=An index of person separation in latent trait theory, the traditional KR.20 index, and the Guttman scale response pattern |journal=Education Research and Perspectives |volume=9 |issue= |pages=95–104 |year=1982 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

IRT is sometimes called ''strong true score theory'' or ''modern mental test theory'' because it is a more recent body of theory and makes more explicit the hypotheses that are implicit within CTT.

'''''Jacob's Ladder''''' is a 1990 American [[psychological horror]] film directed by [[Adrian Lyne]], produced by [[Alan Marshall (producer)|Alan Marshall]], written by [[Bruce Joel Rubin]] and starring [[Tim Robbins]], [[Elizabeth Peña]], and [[Danny Aiello]]. The film's protagonist, Jacob, is a [[Vietnam veteran]] whose experiences prior to and during the war result in strange, fragmentary visions and bizarre hallucinations that continue to haunt him. As his ordeal worsens, Jacob desperately attempts to figure out the truth.

''Jacob's Ladder'' was made by [[Carolco Pictures]] ten years after being written by Rubin. It drew from several inspirations for its story and effects, including the short film ''[[An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge (film)|An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge]]'' and the paintings of [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]]. Though only moderately successful upon release, the film garnered a [[Cult film|cult following]] and became a source of influence for various other works such as the horror video game franchise ''[[Silent Hill]]''. A remake, also titled ''[[Jacob's Ladder (2019 film)|Jacob's Ladder]]'', is currently in production for a planned 2019 release.

==Plot==
On 6&amp;nbsp;October 1971, an American [[combat medic]], Jacob Singer, is with the [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Air Cavalry Division]], deployed in a village in Vietnam's [[Mekong Delta]], when his close-knit unit comes under sudden attack. As many of Jacob's comrades are killed or wounded, others exhibit abnormal behavior with some suffering [[catatonia]], convulsions, and seizures. Jacob flees into the jungle, only to be bayoneted by an unseen assailant.

Jacob awakens in the [[New York City Subway]], where an inexplicably locked subway station exit results in him almost being hit by a train. The year is 1975, he works as a postal clerk, and lives in a rundown apartment in [[Brooklyn]] with his girlfriend, Jezzie. Jacob misses his old family and experiences visions of them, especially the youngest of his sons, Gabe, who had died in an accident before the war. He is increasingly beset by disturbing experiences and apparitions, including glimpses of faceless vibrating figures, and narrowly escapes being run over by a pursuing car. At a party thrown by friends, he appears to witness an enormous creature penetrating Jezzie before he collapses with a dangerous fever. First-person perspective apparent [[Flashback (psychology)|flashbacks]] to his time in Vietnam show Jacob, badly wounded, being discovered by American soldiers before being evacuated under fire in a helicopter.

One of Jacob's former platoon mates, Paul, contacts him to reveal he is suffering from similar experiences but is immediately killed when his car explodes. Commiserating after the funeral, other surviving members of the platoon confess that they have all been experiencing horrifying hallucinations. Believing that they are suffering the effects of a military experiment performed on them without their knowledge or consent, they hire a lawyer to investigate. However the lawyer quits the case after reading military files documenting that the soldiers were never in combat and were discharged for psychological reasons. Jacob's comrades soon back down while Jacob suspects they have been threatened into doing so. He is abducted by suited men who try to intimidate him. Jacob fights them and escapes but is injured and nearly paralyzed in the process. He is taken to a nightmarish hospital, where he is told he has been killed and this is home, but his [[chiropractor]] friend Louis comes to his rescue and heals him. Louis quotes the 14th-century [[Christian mysticism|Christian mystic]], [[Meister Eckhart]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Eckhart saw [[Hell]] too. He said: "The only thing that burns in Hell is the part of you that won't let go of life, your memories, your attachments. They burn them all away. But they're not punishing you", he said. "They're freeing your soul. So, if you're frightened of dying and ... you're holding on, you'll see [[devil]]s tearing your life away. But if you've made your peace, then the devils are really [[angel]]s, freeing you from the earth."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jacob is approached by a distressed man who was seen treating his wound in a [[Medical evacuation|medevac]] helicopter and who also dragged him away from Paul's burning car. Introducing himself as Michael Newman, he tells a story of having been a chemist with [[Chemical Corps|the Army's chemical warfare division]] where he designed a drug he called the Ladder, which when ingested massively increased aggression. To test its effectiveness, a dose was secretly given to Jacob's unit before the battle, causing some of them to turn on each other in a homicidal frenzy. Michael's revelation triggers a vision of his wounding in Vietnam, in which he sees that his attacker was a fellow American soldier. Jacob returns to his family's home, where he finds Gabe, who takes him by the hand and leads him up the staircase into a bright light. In a [[triage]] tent in 1971, military doctors declare Jacob dead.

The film's title refers to the Biblical story of [[Jacob's Ladder]], or the dream of a meeting place between [[Heaven]] and Earth ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 28:12). Its little-known alternate title is ''Dante's Inferno'', in a reference to ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'' by [[Dante Alighieri]].&lt;ref&gt;John Flowers, Paul Frizler, ''Psychotherapists on Film, 1899-1999: A Worldwide Guide to Over 5000 Films, Volume 1'', McFarland, 2004 (p.309).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pamela Jaye Smith, ''Inner Drives'', Michael Wiese Productions, 2005 (p.217).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eric G. Wilson, ''Secret Cinema: Gnostic Vision in Film'', Bloomsbury, 2006 (p.123).&lt;/ref&gt; Screenwriter and co-producer [[Bruce Joel Rubin]] perceived the film as a modern interpretation of the ''[[Bardo Thodol|Liberation Through Hearing During the Intermediate State]]'', the [[Tibet]]an Book of the Dead.&lt;ref name="st"&gt;{{cite news | title = Adrian Lyne Met A Metaphysical Challenge | first = John | last = Hartl | url = http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19901101&amp;slug=1101695 | work = [[The Seattle Times]] | date = 1990-11-01 | accessdate = 2010-02-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = FILM; Up 'Jacob's Ladder' And Into the Hell Of a Veteran's Psyche | first = Tim | last = Golden | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/28/arts/film-up-jacob-s-ladder-and-into-the-hell-of-a-veteran-s-psyche.html | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 1990-10-28 | accessdate = 2007-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rubin said: "The inspiration in a sense is my entire spiritual upbringing. Once you have a [[Buddhist meditation|meditative life]] you start to see that the world is really far different than what it appears to be. What appears to be finite is really couched in the infinite, and the infinite imbues everything in our lives."&lt;ref&gt;''Tricycle: The Buddhist Review - Volume 1'', Buddhist Ray, 1991 (p.77).&lt;/ref&gt; Before writing his scripts for ''Jacob's Ladder'' and ''[[Ghost (1990 film)|Ghost]]'', which too was released in 1990, the Jewish-born Rubin spent two years in a [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] monastery in Nepal;&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carrol Lee Fry, ''Cinema of the Occult: New Age, Satanism, Wicca, and Spiritualism in Film'', Associated University Presse, 2008 (p.77).&lt;/ref&gt; previously, he has also written [[afterlife]]-themed ''[[Brainstorm (1983 film)|Brainstorm]]'' and ''[[Deadly Friend]]''.

Rubin's work on ''Jacob's Ladder'' began in 1980, sparked by his nightmare in which he dreamt about being trapped in a subway. For several years, Rubin tried to sell the script, without success; [[Thom Mount]] of [[Universal Pictures]] said he "loved it, but it was not for his studio". Directors [[Michael Apted]], [[Sidney Lumet]] and [[Ridley Scott]] all expressed an interest in making the film, but still no major studio was ready to invest in Rubin's "too [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]]" stories as "Hollywood does not make [[List of ghost films|ghost movies]]". Eventually, after ''Deadly Friend'' was filmed by [[Wes Craven]] in 1986, Rubin's screenplays for both ''Jacob's Ladder'' and ''Ghost'' were picked by [[Paramount Pictures]].&lt;ref name="st" /&gt; In 1988,&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; [[Adrian Lyne]], who described Rubin's work as "certainly one of the best scripts I've ever read", decided then to direct it instead of an adaptation of ''[[The Bonfire of the Vanities]]'' as he had originally planned (incidentally, [[Tom Hanks]], an actor originally considered by Lyne for the role of Jacob, ended up starring in ''Bonfire''). The ownership and policy changes at Paramount resulted in the cancellation of the project; the executives had doubts about the film's ending and the scenes taking place in Vietnam. The [[independent film]] studio [[Carolco Pictures]] decided to take over the production of ''Jacob's Ladder'', giving Lyne a greater creative control&lt;ref name="st" /&gt; and a budget of $25 million.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; Rubin became the film's co-producer, along with [[Mario Kassar]], [[Alan Marshall (producer)|Alan Marshall]] and [[Andrew G. Vajna]].

{{quote box|quote=I can see why people didn't want to make it for so long. It reads like a novel, and it's very intimidating because it's written so descriptively. Bruce had these very literal images of heaven and hell that I didn't know how to bring off. How do you introduce a character with horns?|source=–[[Adrian Lyne]]&lt;ref name=st/&gt;|width=30%}}

Lyne, who downplayed Rubin's "intimidating" [[Old Testament]] themes,&lt;ref name="after"&gt;Tom Ruffles, ''Ghost Images: Cinema of the Afterlife'', McFarland, 2004 (p.192).&lt;/ref&gt; said that he prepared for making the film by watching "endless" documentary films about the war in Vietnam and reading "countless" chronicles of [[near-death experience]]s.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; The film's plot device of a long period of [[Time perception|subjective time]] passing in an instant has been explored by several authors. A particularly strong inspiration for both Rubin and Lyne was [[Robert Enrico]]'s 1962 short film ''[[An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge (film)|An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge]]'',&lt;ref name="rubin"&gt;Bruce Joel Rubin, ''Jacob's Ladder'', Applause Theatre &amp; Cinema Books, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; one of Lyne's favourite movies,&lt;ref name="st" /&gt; which was in turn based on [[Ambrose Bierce]]'s 1890 short story [[An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge|of the same title]].

Cast in the role of Jacob, [[Tim Robbins]] said the film presented for him "a great opportunity to go in a different direction. I love doing comedy, but I know I can do other things as well."&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; The film's military advisor was Vietnam veteran Captain [[Dale Dye]],&lt;ref&gt;Almar Haflidason, [http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2001/10/15/dale_dye_2001_2_interview.shtml Dale Dye: Part 2 - Stop Whining at Me!], BBC, October 2003&lt;/ref&gt; who provided a five-day [[Recruit training|boot camp]] military training for the actors playing soldiers in the Vietnam storyline (including Robbins, [[Pruitt Taylor Vince]], [[Eriq La Salle]] and [[Ving Rhames]]). The war scenes were filmed in the [[Puerto Rico]] area of [[Vega Baja]], featuring the [[UH-1 Iroquois|UH-1]] helicopters provided by the [[Puerto Rico National Guard]].

All of the film's special effect sequences were filmed in camera, with no use of post production effects. In several scenes of ''Jacob's Ladder'', Lyne used a [[body horror]] technique in which an actor is recorded shaking his head around at a low [[frame rate]], resulting in horrifically fast motion when played back. In the Special Edition's commentary track, Lyne said he was inspired by the art of the painter [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]] when developing the effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.widerscreenings.com/jacobsladder.html |title=Jacob's Ladder |publisher=Widerscreenings.com |date=|accessdate=2012-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his screenplay, Rubin used traditional imagery of demons and hell. However, Lyne decided to use images similar to [[thalidomide]] deformities to achieve a greater shock effect.&lt;ref name="rubin" /&gt; After many heated arguments,&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; Lyne managed to convert Rubin to his vision. Lyne and Rubin used the works of the artist [[H. R. Giger]] and the photographers [[Diane Arbus]] and [[Joel-Peter Witkin]] for inspiration; another influence came from the [[Brothers Quay]]'s 1986 [[stop motion]] short film ''[[Street of Crocodiles]]''.

{{quote box|quote=Vietnam was really a means to an end. It was a plot device rather than something we were trying to make a huge issue of.|source=–[[Alan Marshall (producer)|Alan Marshall]]&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;|width=30%}}

In the film, Jacob is told by Michael that the horrific events he experienced on his final day in Vietnam were the product of an experimental drug called "the Ladder", which was used on troops without their knowledge. At the end of the film, a message is displayed saying that reports of testing of BZ, [[NATO]] code for a [[deliriant]] and [[hallucinogen]] known as [[3-Quinuclidinyl benzilate|3-quinuclidinyl benzilate]], on U.S. soldiers during the Vietnam War were denied by the [[United States Department of Defense|Pentagon]]. Lyne said a part of the inspiration for this motif was [[Martin A. Lee]]'s book ''[[Acid Dreams: The CIA, LSD and Sixties Rebellion]]'', but noted that "nothing in the book suggests that the drug BZ — a super-hallucinogen that has a tendency to elicit [[Mania|maniac behavior]] — was used on U.S. troops."&lt;ref name="st" /&gt;

According to Lyne's audio commentary, [[test screening]]s indicated that the initial version of the film was overwhelming for the audience. In response, about 20 minutes of disturbing scenes, mostly from the last third of the film, were removed from the final cut.

===Home media===
The Special Edition [[DVD]] was released by [[Artisan Entertainment]] on July 14, 1998, containing three deleted scenes ("Jezzie's Transformation", "The Antidote" and "The Train Station") along with several other special features, such as audio commentary by Adrian Lyne and a 26-minute [[making-of]] documentary "Building ''Jacob's Ladder''".&lt;ref name="dvd" /&gt; On September 14, 2010, the film was released on [[Blu-ray Disc]] by [[Lions Gate Entertainment]] and retains all of the special features of the DVD version, along with two [[Trailer (promotion)|trailer]]s, omitting only a TV spot that came with the DVD.&lt;ref name="ign"&gt;R.L.

==Reception==

===Box office===
The film took the number one spot at the weekend [[box office]] in North America, garnering ticket sales of $7.5 million from 1,052 screens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-11-05/entertainment/ca-3119_1_ticket-sales |title='Jacob's Ladder' Climbs to Top of Ticket Sales. - Los Angeles Times |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=2000-08-17 |accessdate=2013-06-28 |first=Pat H. |last=Broeske}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the attendance dropped fast and its overall domestic box office result was only $26,118,851.&lt;ref name="mojo" /&gt;

===Critical reception===
According to aggregate website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], 69% of reviews of the film have been positive based on 61 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/jacobs_ladder/ | title = Jacob's Ladder (1990) | publisher = ''[[Rotten Tomatoes]]'' | accessdate = 2010-04-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "C-" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref name="CinemaScore"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://m.cinemascore.com |title=CinemaScore |work=cinemascore.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' wrote that watching it left him "reeling with turmoil and confusion, with feelings of sadness and despair," and called it a "thoroughly painful and depressing experience — but, it must be said, one that has been powerfully written, directed and acted." He awarded the film three and a half out of a possible four stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19901102/REVIEWS/11020301/1023 | title = Jacob's Ladder | last = Ebert | first = Roger | date = 1990-11-02 | publisher = ''Rogerebert.suntimes.com'' | accessdate = 2010-04-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that this "slick, riveting, viscerally scary film about what in other hands would be a decidedly unsalable subject, namely [[death]]," is "both quaint and devastating."&lt;ref&gt;Janet Maslin, [https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C0CE7D8143CF931A35752C1A966958260 Movie Review - Jacob s Ladder - Review/Film; It's Scary, Yes, and Death Has a Role], ''The New York Times'', November 2, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[Desson Thomson]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' felt disappointed with the film that is "ultimately flat on its [[Surrealism|surrealistic]] face, the victim of too many fake-art sequences."&lt;ref&gt;Desson Howe, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/jacobsladderrhowe_a0b2b5.htm 'Jacob's Ladder' (R)], ''Washington Post'', November 02, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; [[Owen Gleiberman]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' wrote that "''Jacob's Ladder'' is so 'dark' it sucks Robbins right down with it. By the time Jacob is being strapped to a bed and wheeled down a hospital corridor strewn with bloody limbs, it's hard to care whether the [[Orwellian]] image is a hallucination or not. You just want out."&lt;ref&gt;Owen Gleiberman, [http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,318521,00.html Jacob's Ladder (1990)], EW.com, Nov 02, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kim Newman]] called the film "effectively the blunt remake" of ''[[Carnival of Souls]]''.&lt;ref name="after" /&gt;

According to [[IGN]]'s review of the DVD release in 2004, "After movies like ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Se7en]]'', it may not pack the same subtle horror for today's audiences it did when it was first released, but it's still a great film."&lt;ref name="dvd"&gt;Mike Drucker, [http://uk.ign.com/articles/2004/11/08/jacobs-ladder Jacob's Ladder: The living nightmare of a movie has a pretty decent DVD.], IGN, November 8, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; IGN's review of ''Jacob's Ladder''{{'}}s 2010 Blu-ray release called it is "an emotionally poignant, creepy horror masterpiece."&lt;ref name="ign" /&gt; According to ''[[Slant Magazine]]'', ''Jacob's Ladder'' is "a bizarrely cohesive hybrid of war movie, character study, [[art film]], and horror flick" and "the very act of watching the film is so emotionally draining that the viewer leaves the film feeling worked-in; the thought of repeat viewings is daunting yet insatiable."&lt;ref name="br"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/dvd/review/jacobs-ladder/1807 |title=Jacob's Ladder &lt;nowiki&gt;&amp;#124;&lt;/nowiki&gt; DVD Review |publisher=Slant Magazine |date=2010-09-14 |accessdate=2013-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Kenneth Muir]] called the film's nightmarish hospital scene "one of the most terrifying moments in all of 1990s horror cinema." Muir further wrote: "In its musings about death, about the end we all fear'', Jacob's Ladder'' proves a deeply affecting and meaningful motion picture. After a screening, you'll immediately want to hug the people you love and then go outside and breathe the fresh air, or otherwise affirm your very existence."&lt;ref&gt;John Kenneth Muir, ''Horror Films of the 1990s'', McFarland, 2011 (p.105).&lt;/ref&gt;

Rubin's script was included on the list of "Hollywood's ten best unproduced screenplays" by ''American Film'' magazine in 1983.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; In 1991, ''Jacob's Ladder'' was nominated at [[Horror Hall of Fame]] II for best horror film, losing to ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]''. The film was also featured in [[Bravo (U.S. TV channel)|Bravo]]'s 2004 documentary miniseries ''[[The 100 Scariest Movie Moments]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bravotv.com/The_100_Scariest_Movie_Moments/index.shtml |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030070540/http://www.bravotv.com/The_100_Scariest_Movie_Moments/index.shtml |archivedate=2007-10-30 |title=The 100 Scariest Movie Moments: 100 Scariest Moments in Movie History - Official Bravo TV Site |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=|accessdate=2013-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the 2009 book ''[[1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die]]''.

''Jacob's Ladder'' greatly inspired the horror franchise ''[[Silent Hill]]'',&lt;ref&gt;John Gaudiosi, [https://www.forbes.com/sites/johngaudiosi/2012/11/02/resident-evil-and-silent-hill-producer-samuel-hadida-talks-wolfenstein-and-onimusha-movies/ Resident Evil And Silent Hill Producer Samuel Hadida Talks Wolfenstein And Onimusha Movies],  Forbes, 11/02/2012&lt;/ref&gt; including the video games ''[[Silent Hill (video game)|Silent Hill]]'' (1999),&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Perron, ''Silent Hill: The Terror Engine'', University of Michigan Press, 2012 (p. 55-56).&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Silent Hill 2]]'' (2001),&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.ign.com/articles/2001/08/17/interview-with-silent-hill-2s-artist-takayoshi-sato Interview with Silent Hill 2&amp;#039,s Artist Takayoshi Sato], IGN, August 17, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Silent Hill 3]]'' (2003),&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.ign.com/articles/2002/06/12/silent-hill-3-interview Silent Hill 3 Interview], IGN, June 12, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Silent Hill 4: The Room]]'' (2004),&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/collective/A3066879| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071227080553/http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/collective/A3066879| archivedate = 2007-12-27| title = Silent Hill 4: The Room| author = Daniel Etherington| work = [[bbc.co.uk]]| date = 2004-10-01| accessdate = 2007-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Silent Hill: Homecoming]]'' (2007),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grayson |first=Vincent |url=http://www.shacknews.com/article/52765/silent-hill-5-interview-jasons |title=Silent Hill 5 Interview: Jason's Philosophy, Jacob's Ladder, and Pyramid Head |publisher=Shacknews.com |date=|accessdate=2012-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the series' 2006 [[Silent Hill (film)|film adaptation]] by [[Christophe Gans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/interview/219 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328090017/http://bloody-disgusting.com/interview/219 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2016-03-28 |title=Interview Silent Hill: Director Christophe Gans |publisher=Bloody Disgusting |date=|accessdate=2012-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's influence on their works was recognised by [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]], writer of the 2011 TV series ''[[American Horror Story: Asylum]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/03/jessica-lange-the-name-game_n_2402373.html Jessica Lange Sings 'The Name Game': 'American Horror Story: Asylum' Goes Musical], HUFFPOST TV, 01/03/2013&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Shinji Mikami]], director of the 2014 video game ''[[The Evil Within]]''.&lt;ref name=ign2&gt;Lucy O'Brien, [http://uk.ign.com/articles/2013/05/06/the-movie-every-survival-horror-fan-should-watch "Am I dying, Louie?"], IGN, May 16, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kim Manners]] prepared for directing ''[[The X-Files]]'' episode "[[Grotesque (The X-Files)|Grotesque]]" by listening to the music from ''Jacob's Ladder''.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Lowry, ''The Truth is Out There: The Official Guide to the X-Files'', Harper Prism, 1995 (p.158).&lt;/ref&gt; The music video for the 2010 song "[[Nightmare (Avenged Sevenfold song)|Nightmare]]" by [[Avenged Sevenfold]] is a [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to the famous hospital scene from the film, chosen because the band's deceased drummer [[The Rev]] was a fan of the film.

''Jacob's Ladder'' as a film is directly referred to in ''Silent Hill 2'' and especially ''Silent Hill 3''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/features/behind-mysteries-of-silent-hill |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130219221845/http://www.1up.com/features/behind-mysteries-of-silent-hill |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-02-19 |title=Behind the Many Mysteries of Silent Hill from |publisher=1UP.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other references include the 2002 ''[[The Twilight Zone (2002 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' episode "[[Night Route]]", the 2005 film ''[[Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit]]'', and the 2010 ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[The Squirt and the Whale]]".

[[Claytown Troupe]] used a [[Sample (music)|sample]] of Michael's quote 'It's a fast trip ... ' at the beginning of the track "Rainbow's Edge" in the 1991 album ''Out There''. [[UNKLE]] sampled dialogue from the film in their 1998 "[[Rabbit in Your Headlights]]" and again in 2003 in "Inside". [[VNV Nation]]'s track "Forsaken" from the 1998  album ''[[Praise the Fallen]]'' ends with the quotation from Eckhart. "Devils" from [[IVardensphere]]'s 2011 album ''APOK'' begins with the same quotation. A sample of Jacob's cry 'Stop it, you're killing me!' is used in "Next in Line" in [[Nevermore]]'s 1996 album ''[[The Politics of Ecstasy (album)|The Politics of Ecstasy]]''.  Terminal Sect extensively sampled the film for their track "Where Angels Fall".

The film's possible influence can be arguably seen in many other works ranging from [[M. Night Shyamalan]]'s 1999 hit psychological horror film ''[[The Sixth Sense]]''&lt;ref&gt;Charles Derry, ''Dark Dreams 2.0: A Psychological History of the Modern Horror Film from the 1950s to the 21st Century'', McFarland, 2009 (p.223).&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Peter Arnett]]'s controversial 1998 [[CNN]] report "Valley of Death" about the 1970 [[Operation Tailwind]].&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Lembcke, ''CNN's Tailwind Tale: Inside Vietnam's Last Great Myth'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2003 (p.77).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jeff Millar]] of ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' wrote that [[Giuseppe Tornatore]]'s 1994 psychological thriller ''[[A Pure Formality]]'' uses the plot device of ''Jacob's Ladder'' mixed with several other sources.&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Millar, [http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl/1995_1300653/pure-formality-so-pretentious-is-hurts.html 'Pure Formality' so pretentious is hurts], ''Houston Chronicle'', 10/06/1995&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere]]'', [[Massy Tadjedin]]'s 2005 psychological thriller ''[[The Jacket]]'' "is a film for those who don't remember ''Jacob's Ladder'', perhaps for someone like Jacob himself", as it "resembles ''Jacob's Ladder'' too much for its own good".&lt;ref&gt;Brian W. Fairbanks, ''I Saw That Movie, Too: Selected Film Reviews'', 2005 (p.201).&lt;/ref&gt; [[PopMatters]] called [[Michael Hurst]]'s 2006 horror film ''[[Room 6]]'' a "''Jacob's Ladder'' lift".&lt;ref&gt;Bill Gibron, [http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/room-6/ Room 6], PopMatters, 8 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jerome, many Jews were also sold into slavery, so many, indeed, that the price of Jewish slaves at the slave market in Hebron sank drastically to a level no greater than that for a horse. The economic structure of the country was largely destroyed. The entire spiritual and economic life of the Palestinian Jews moved to Galilee. Jerusalem was now turned into a Roman colony with the official name ''Colonia Aelia Capitolina'' (''Aelia'' after Hadrian's family name: P. Aelius Hadrianus; ''Capitolina'' after Jupiter Capitolinus). The Jews were forbidden on pain of death to set foot in the new Roman city.

* [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/69*.html Cassius Dio's ''Roman History: Epitome of Book LXIX'' para. 13–14]: "13 At first the Romans took no account of them. Soon, however, all Judaea had been stirred up, and the Jews everywhere were showing signs of disturbance, were gathering together, and giving evidence of great hostility to the Romans, partly by secret and partly by overt acts; 2 many outside nations, too, were joining them through eagerness for gain, and the whole earth, one might almost say, was being stirred up over the matter. Then, indeed, Hadrian sent against them his best generals. First of these was Julius Severus, who was dispatched from Britain, where he was governor, against the Jews. 3 Severus did not venture to attack his opponents in the open at any one point, in view of their numbers and their desperation, but by intercepting small groups, thanks to the number of his soldiers and his under-officers, and by depriving them of food and shutting them up, he was able, rather slowly, to be sure, but with comparatively little danger, to crush, exhaust and exterminate them. Very few of them in fact survived. Fifty of their most important outposts and nine hundred and eighty-five of their most famous villages were razed to the ground. Five hundred and eighty thousand men were slain in the various raids and battles, and the number of those that perished by famine, disease and fire was past finding out. 2 Thus nearly the whole of Judaea was made desolate, a result of which the people had had forewarning before the war. For the tomb of Solomon, which the Jews regard as an object of veneration, fell to pieces of itself and collapsed, and many wolves and hyenas rushed howling into their cities. 3 Many Romans, moreover, perished in this war. Therefore Hadrian in writing to the senate did not employ the opening phrase commonly affected by the emperors, 'If you and our children are in health, it is well; I and the legions are in health'" (para. 13–14).

Diaspora [galut] connoted deracination, legal disabilities, oppression, and an often painful adjustment to a hostland whose hospitality was unreliable and ephemeral. It also connoted the existence on foreign soil of an expatriate community that considered its presence to be transitory. Meanwhile, it developed a set of institutions, social patterns, and ethnonational and/or religious symbols that held it together. These included the language, religion, values, social norms, and narratives of the homeland. Gradually, this community adjusted to the hostland environment and became itself a center of cultural creation. All the while, however, it continued to cultivate the idea of return to the homeland."

This attitude has further been buttressed by the equally traditional view, which is held not only by the Jews themselves, about the exceptional historical age of this diaspora, its singular traumatic experiences its singular ability to survive pogroms, exiles, and Holocaust, as well as its "special relations" with its ancient homeland, culminating in 1948 with the nation-state that the Jewish nation has established there... First, like many other members of established diasporas, the vast majority of Jews no longer regard themselves as being in ''Galut'' [exile] in their host countries.7 Perceptually, as well as actually, Jews permanently reside in host countries of their own free will, as a result of inertia, or as a result of problematic conditions prevailing in other hostlands, or in Israel. It means that the basic perception of many Jews about their existential situation in their hostlands has changed. Consequently, there is both a much greater self- and collective-legitimatization to refrain from making serious plans concerning "return" or actually "making Aliyah" [to emigrate, or "go up"] to Israel. This is one of the results of their wider, yet still rather problematic and sometimes painful acceptance by the societies and political systems in their host countries. It means that they, and to an extent their hosts, do not regard Jewish life within the framework of diasporic formations in these hostlands as something that they should be ashamed of, hide from others, or alter by returning to the old homeland" (p. 4).

The Judaean Jewish community never recovered from the Bar Kochba war. In its wake, Jews no longer formed the majority in Palestine, and the Jewish center moved to the Galilee.

== Name and etymology ==
{{main|Jew (word)}}
{{main list|List of Jewish ethnonyms}}
The English word "Jew" continues [[Middle English]] ''{{lang|enm|Gyw, Iewe}}''. These terms derive from [[Old French]] ''{{lang|fro|giu}}'', earlier ''{{lang|fro|juieu}}'', which through [[elision]] had dropped the letter "d" from the [[Medieval Latin]] ''Iudaeus'', which, like the [[New Testament]] [[Greek language|Greek]] term ''[[Ioudaios]]'', meant both "Jew" and "[[Judean]]" / "of [[Judea]]".&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of the Peoples of Africa and the Middle East, Facts On File Inc., Infobase Publishing, 2009, p.336&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek term was a loan from [[Middle Aramaic|Aramaic]] ''{{transl|arc|Y'hūdāi}}'', corresponding to [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] {{lang|he|יְהוּדִי}} {{transl|he|Yehudi}}, originally the term for a member of the [[tribe of Judah]] or the people of the [[kingdom of Judah]]. According to the [[Hebrew Bible]], the name of both the tribe and kingdom derive from [[Judah (Bible)|Judah]], the fourth son of [[Jacob]].&lt;ref&gt;"Jew", ''Oxford English Dictionary''.&lt;/ref&gt; Genesis 29:35 and 49:8 connect the name "Judah" with the verb {{transl|he|yada}}, meaning "praise", but scholars generally agree that the name of both the patriarch and the kingdom instead have a geographic origin—possibly referring to the gorges and ravines of the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Theological Dictionary of the Old Testament|editor1-first=G.

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is widely recognized that the attributive use of the noun ''Jew'', in phrases such as ''Jew lawyer'' or ''Jew ethics'', is both vulgar and highly offensive. In such contexts ''Jewish'' is the only acceptable possibility. Some people, however, have become so wary of this construction that they have extended the stigma to any use of ''Jew'' as a noun, a practice that carries risks of its own. In a sentence such as ''There are now several Jews on the council'', which is unobjectionable, the substitution of a circumlocution like ''Jewish people'' or ''persons of Jewish background'' may in itself cause offense for seeming to imply that Jew has a negative connotation when used as a noun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/Jew |title=Jew |publisher=[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]] |accessdate=2 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805210424/http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/jew |archivedate=August 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Historical definitions of [[Jewish identity]] have traditionally been based on ''[[halakha|halakhic]]'' definitions of matrilineal descent, and halakhic conversions. These definitions of who is a Jew date back to the codification of the [[Oral Torah]] into the [[Talmud|Babylonian Talmud]], around 200 [[Common Era|CE]]. Interpretations of sections of the Tanakh, such as [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]] 7:1–5, by Jewish sages, are used as a warning against [[Interfaith marriage in Judaism|intermarriage]] between Jews and [[Canaanites]] because "[the non-Jewish husband] will cause your child to turn away from Me and they will worship the gods (i.e., idols) of others." {{bibleref2|Leviticus|24:10}} says that the son in a marriage between a Hebrew woman and an [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] man is "of the community of Israel." This is complemented by {{bibleref2|Ezra|10:2–3}}, where Israelites returning from Babylon vow to put aside their [[gentile]] wives and their children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shamash.org/lists/scj-faq/HTML/faq/10-11.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19961018024300/http://shamash.org/lists/scj-faq/HTML/faq/10-11.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=18 October 1996|title=What is the origin of Matrilineal Descent?|accessdate=9 January 2009|date=4 September 2003|publisher=Shamash.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torah.org/qanda/seequanda.php?id=318 |title=What is the source of the law that a child is Jewish only if its mother is Jewish? |accessdate=9 January 2009 |publisher=Torah.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224205847/http://www.torah.org/qanda/seequanda.php?id=318 |archivedate=24 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A popular theory is that the rape of Jewish women in captivity brought about the law of Jewish identity being inherited through the maternal line, although scholars challenge this theory citing the Talmudic establishment of the law from the pre-exile period.&lt;ref name="Klein2016" /&gt; Another argument is that the rabbis changed the law of patrilineal descent to matrilineal descent due to the widespread rape of Jewish women by Roman soldiers.&lt;ref name="Schott2010"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6iFx-wHhMJMC&amp;pg=PA67|title=Birth, Death, and Femininity: Philosophies of Embodiment|author=Robin May Schott|date=25 October 2010|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0-253-00482-9|pages=67–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the anti-religious ''[[Haskalah]]'' movement of the late 18th and 19th centuries, ''halakhic'' interpretations of Jewish identity have been challenged.&lt;ref&gt;Dosick (2007), pp. 56–57.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to historian [[Shaye J. D. Cohen]], the status of the offspring of mixed marriages was determined [[Patrilineality|patrilineally]] in the Bible. He brings two likely explanations for the change in [[Mishnah|Mishnaic]] times: first, the Mishnah may have been applying the same logic to mixed marriages as it had applied to other mixtures (''[[Kil'ayim (prohibition)|Kil'ayim]]''). Thus, a mixed marriage is forbidden as is the union of a [[horse]] and a [[donkey]], and in both unions the offspring are judged matrilineally.&lt;ref name="J.D. Cohen"&gt;{{cite book|author=Shaye J.D. Cohen|year=1999|title=The Beginnings of Jewishness|publisher=U. California Press|pages=305–06|isbn=0-585-24643-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, the [[Tannaim]] may have been influenced by [[Roman law]], which dictated that when a parent could not contract a legal marriage, [[Mater semper certa est|offspring would follow the mother]].&lt;ref name="J.D. Cohen" /&gt; Rabbi Rivon Krygier follows a similar reasoning, arguing that Jewish descent had formerly passed through the patrineal descent and the law of matrilineal descent had its roots in the Roman legal system.&lt;ref name="Klein2016"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0BC_DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA6|title=Lost Jews: The Struggle for Identity Today|author=Emma Klein|date=27 July 2016|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-349-24319-8|pages=6–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A factual reconstruction for the origin of the Jews is a difficult and complex endeavor. It requires examining at least 3,000 years of ancient human history using documents in vast quantities and variety written in at least ten near Eastern languages. As archaeological discovery relies upon researchers and scholars from diverse disciplines, the goal is to interpret all of the factual data, focusing on the most consistent theory. The prehistory and ethnogenesis of the Jews are closely intertwined with archaeology, biology, and historical textual records, as well as religious literature and mythology. The ethnic stock to which Jews originally trace their ancestry was a confederation of Iron Age semitic-speaking tribes known as the [[Israelites]] that inhabited a part of [[Canaan]] during the [[history of ancient Israel and Judah|tribal and monarchic periods]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Legacy: A Genetic History of the Jewish People |last=Ostrer |first=Harry |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2012 |isbn=978-0195379617 |publication-date=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Jews are named after and also descended from the southern Israelite [[Kingdom of Judah]].&lt;ref&gt;Ann E.

According to the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Bible]] narrative, Jewish ancestry is traced back to the [[Patriarchs (Bible)|Biblical patriarchs]] such as [[Abraham]], his son [[Isaac]], Isaac's son [[Jacob]], and the Biblical matriarchs [[Sarah]], [[Rebecca]], [[Leah]], and [[Rachel]], who lived in [[Canaan]]. The [[Twelve Tribes]] are described as descending from the twelve sons of Jacob. Jacob and his family migrated to [[Ancient Egypt]] after being invited to live with Jacob's son [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]] by the [[Pharaohs in the Bible|Pharaoh]] himself. The patriarchs' descendants were later enslaved until the [[The Exodus|Exodus]] led by [[Moses]], after which the Israelites conquered Canaan under Moses' successor [[Joshua]], went through the period of the [[Biblical judges]] after the death of Joshua, then through the mediation of [[Samuel]] became subject to a king, [[Saul]], who was succeeded by [[David]] and then [[Solomon]], after whom the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|United Monarchy]] ended and was split into a separate [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]] and a [[Kingdom of Judah]]. The Kingdom of Judah is described as comprising the [[Tribe of Judah]], the [[Tribe of Benjamin]], partially the [[Tribe of Levi]], and later adding remnants of other tribes who migrated there from the Kingdom of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/307146/Judah Judah: Hebrew Tribe, ''Encyclopædia Britannica'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Broshi 2001 174"&gt;{{cite book |last=Broshi |first=Maguen |title=Bread, Wine, Walls and Scrolls |url=https://books.google.com/?id=etTUEorS1zMC&amp;pg=PA174|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |year=2001 |page=174 |isbn=1-84127-201-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Jews claim lineage from those tribes since the [[Ten Lost Tribes|ten northern tribes]] were lost following [[Assyrian captivity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Judah-Hebrew-tribe |title=Judah |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. |access-date=1 April 2018}}|&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern [[archaeology]] has largely discarded the historicity of this narrative,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dever |first=William |title=What Did the Biblical Writers Know, and When Did They Know It? |year=2001 |publisher=Eerdmans |isbn=3-927120-37-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6-VxwC5rQtwC |pages=98–99 |quote=After a century of exhaustive investigation, all respectable archaeologists have given up hope of recovering any context that would make Abraham, Isaac, or Jacob credible "historical figures" [...] archaeological investigation of Moses and the Exodus has similarly been discarded as a fruitless pursuit.}}&lt;/ref&gt; with it being reframed as constituting the [[Israelites]]' inspiring [[national myth]] narrative. The Israelites and their culture, according to the modern archaeological account, did not overtake the region by force, but instead branched out of the [[Canaanite languages|Canaanite peoples]] and culture through the development of a distinct [[monolatrism|monolatristic]]—and later [[monotheism|monotheistic]]—religion centered on [[Yahweh]]. The growth of Yahweh-centric belief, along with a number of cultic practices, gradually gave rise to a distinct Israelite [[ethnic group]], setting them apart from other Canaanites.&lt;ref&gt;Tubb, 1998. pp. 13–14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Smith in "The Early History of God: Yahweh and Other Deities of Ancient Israel" states "Despite the long regnant model that the Canaanites and Israelites were people of fundamentally different culture, archaeological data now casts doubt on this view. The material culture of the region exhibits numerous common points between Israelites and Canaanites in the Iron I period (c. 1200–1000&amp;nbsp;BCE). The record would suggest that the Israelite culture largely overlapped with and derived from Canaanite culture... In short, Israelite culture was largely Canaanite in nature. Given the information available, one cannot maintain a radical cultural separation between Canaanites and Israelites for the Iron I period." (pp. 6–7).

The Jewish [[ethnicity|people]] and the [[religion]] of [[Judaism]] are strongly interrelated. [[Conversion to Judaism|Converts to Judaism]] typically have a status within the Jewish ''ethnos'' equal to those born into it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/judaism/beliefs/conversion.shtml |title=BBC Religions/Converting to Judaism: "A person who converts to Judaism becomes a Jew in every sense of the word, and is just as Jewish as someone born into Judaism." |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, several converts to Judaism, as well as ex-Jews, have claimed that converts are treated as second-class Jews by many born Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.interfaithfamily.com/spirituality/conversion/Are_Converts_Treated_as_Second_Class.shtml |title=Are Converts Treated as Second Class? |work=InterfaithFamily}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Conversion is not encouraged by mainstream Judaism, and it is considered a difficult task. A significant portion of conversions are undertaken by children of mixed marriages, or would-be or current spouses of Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/paul-golin/the-complicated-relations_b_842806.html |title=Paul Golin: The Complicated Relationship Between Intermarriage and Jewish Conversion |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hebrew Bible]], a religious interpretation of the traditions and early history of the Jews, established the first of the [[Abrahamic religions]], which are now practiced by 54% of the world. [[Judaism]] guides its adherents in both practice and belief, and has been called not only a religion, but also a "way of life,"&lt;ref&gt;Neusner (1991) p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; which has made drawing a clear distinction between Judaism, [[Jewish culture]], and [[Jewish identity]] rather difficult.

For centuries, Jews worldwide have spoken the local or dominant languages of the regions they migrated to, often developing distinctive [[dialect]]al forms or branches that became independent languages.

Within the world's [[Jewish population]] there are distinct ethnic divisions, most of which are primarily the result of geographic branching from an originating [[Israelite]] population, and subsequent independent evolutions. An array of Jewish communities was established by Jewish settlers in various places around the [[Old World]], often at great distances from one another, resulting in effective and often long-term isolation. During the [[millennia]] of the [[Jewish diaspora]] the communities would develop under the influence of their local environments: [[politics|political]], [[culture|cultural]], [[nature|natural]], and populational. Today, manifestations of these differences among the Jews can be observed in [[Jewish culture|Jewish cultural expressions]] of each community, including [[Jewish languages|Jewish linguistic diversity]], culinary preferences, liturgical practices, religious interpretations, as well as degrees and sources of [[genetic admixture]].&lt;ref&gt;Dosick (2007), p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jews are often identified as belonging to one of two major groups: the ''[[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazim]]'' and the ''[[Sephardi Jews|Sephardim]]''. Ashkenazim, or "Germanics" ([[Ashkenaz]] meaning "[[Germany]]" in Hebrew), are so named denoting their [[History of the Jews in Germany|German Jewish]] cultural and geographical origins, while Sephardim, or "[[Hispanics]]" ([[Sefarad]] meaning "[[Spain]]/[[Hispania]]" or "[[Iberian peninsula|Iberia]]" in Hebrew), are so named denoting their Spanish/Portuguese Jewish cultural and geographic origins. The more common term in [[Israel]] for many of those broadly called Sephardim, is ''[[Mizrahi Jews|Mizrahim]]'' (lit. "Easterners", Mizrach being "East" in Hebrew), that is, in reference to the diverse collection of Middle Eastern and North African Jews who are often, as a group, referred to collectively as ''Sephardim'' (together with Sephardim proper) for liturgical reasons, although Mizrahi Jewish groups and Sephardi Jews proper are ethnically distinct.&lt;ref&gt;Dosick (2007), p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Smaller groups include, but are not restricted to, [[Jews in India|Indian Jews]] such as the [[Bene Israel]], [[Bnei Menashe]], [[Cochin Jews]], and [[Bene Ephraim]]; the [[Romaniote Jews|Romaniotes]] of Greece; the [[Italian rite Jews|Italian Jews]] ("Italkim" or "Bené Roma"); the [[Teimanim]] from [[Yemen]]; various [[Jews and Judaism in Africa|African Jews]], including most numerously the [[Beta Israel]] of [[Ethiopia]]; and [[History of the Jews in China|Chinese Jews]], most notably the [[Kaifeng Jews]], as well as various other distinct but now almost extinct communities.&lt;ref name=EJ571&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Schmelz|first=Usiel Oscar |author2=Sergio DellaPergola |editor=Fred Skolnik|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]|title=Demography|edition=2d|year=2007|publisher=Thomson Gale|volume=5|location=Farmington Hills, Mich.|isbn=0-02-865928-7|page=571|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The divisions between all these groups are approximate and their boundaries are not always clear. The Mizrahim for example, are a heterogeneous collection of [[North Africa]]n, [[Central Asia]]n, [[Caucasus (geographic region)|Caucasian]], and Middle Eastern Jewish communities that are no closer related to each other than they are to any of the earlier mentioned Jewish groups. In modern usage, however, the Mizrahim are sometimes termed ''Sephardi'' due to similar styles of liturgy, despite independent development from Sephardim proper. Thus, among Mizrahim there are [[Egyptian Jews]], [[Iraqi Jews]], [[Lebanese Jews]], [[Kurdish Jews]], [[Moroccan Jews]], [[Libyan Jews]], [[Syrian Jews]], [[Bukharian Jews]], [[Mountain Jews]], [[Georgian Jews]], [[Iranian Jews]], [[Afghan Jews]], and various others. The [[Teimanim]] from [[Yemen]] are sometimes included, although their style of liturgy is unique and they differ in respect to the admixture found among them to that found in Mizrahim. In addition, there is a differentiation made between Sephardi migrants who established themselves in the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]] after the expulsion of the Jews from Spain and Portugal in the 1490s and the pre-existing Jewish communities in those regions.&lt;ref name=EJ571 /&gt;

Ashkenazi Jews represent the bulk of modern Jewry, with at least 70% of Jews worldwide (and up to 90% prior to [[World War II]] and [[the Holocaust]]). As a result of their [[emigration]] from [[Europe]], Ashkenazim also represent the overwhelming majority of Jews in the [[New World]] continents, in countries such as the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Argentina]], [[Australia]], and [[Brazil]]. In [[France]], the immigration of Jews from [[Algeria]] (Sephardim) has led them to outnumber the Ashkenazim.&lt;ref name=EJ572&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Schmelz|first=Usiel Oscar |author2=Sergio DellaPergola |editor=Fred Skolnik|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]|title=Demography|edition=2d|year=2007|publisher=Thomson Gale|volume=5|location=Farmington Hills, Mich.|isbn=0-02-865928-7|pages=571–2|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only in [[Israel]] is the Jewish population representative of all groups, a [[melting pot]] independent of each group's proportion within the overall world Jewish population.&lt;ref&gt;Dosick (2007), p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

A trickle of immigrants from other communities has also arrived, including [[Indian Jews]] and others, as well as some descendants of [[Ashkenazi]] Holocaust survivors who had settled in countries such as the [[United States]], [[Argentina]], [[Australia]], [[Chile]], and [[South Africa]]. Some Jews have emigrated from Israel elsewhere, because of economic problems or disillusionment with political conditions and the continuing [[Arab–Israeli conflict]]. Jewish Israeli emigrants are known as [[Yerida|yordim]].&lt;ref name="Dosick 2007, p. 340"&gt;Dosick (2007), p. 340.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hanukkah sign Nicosia Republic of Cyprus.JPG|thumb|[[public menorah|Public Hanukkah menorah]] in [[Nicosia]], [[Cyprus]]]]

The waves of [[immigration to the United States]] and elsewhere at the turn of the 19th century, the founding of [[Zionism]] and later events, including [[pogroms]] in Russia, the massacre of European Jewry during [[the Holocaust]], and the founding of the [[state of Israel]], with the subsequent [[Jewish exodus from Arab lands]], all resulted in substantial shifts in the population centers of world Jewry by the end of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Gartner (2001), p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt;

More than half of the Jews live in the Diaspora (see Population table). Currently, the largest Jewish community outside Israel, and either the largest or second-largest Jewish community in the world, is located in the United States, with 5.2&amp;nbsp;million to 6.4&amp;nbsp;million Jews by various estimates. Elsewhere in the Americas, there are also large Jewish populations in [[Canada]] (315,000), [[Argentina]] (180,000–300,000), and [[Brazil]] (196,000–600,000), and smaller populations in [[Mexico]], [[Uruguay]], [[Venezuela]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]] and several other countries (see [[History of the Jews in Latin America]]).&lt;ref name="JPPI2007"&gt;{{cite web|title=Annual Assessment|url=http://jppi.org.il/uploads/Annual%20Assessment%202007.pdf|year=2007|publisher=Jewish People Policy Planning Institute ([[Jewish Agency for Israel]])|page=15|format=PDF}}, based on {{cite book|title=Annual Assessment 2007|publisher=[[American Jewish Committee]]|url=http://www.ajcarchives.org/main.php?GroupingId=10142|volume=106|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2010 [[Pew Research Center]] study, about 470,000 people of Jewish heritage live in [[Latin America|Latin-America]] and the [[Caribbean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewforum.org/2015/04/02/jews/ |title= Jews - Pew Research Center|website= Pew Research Center|access-date= March 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Demographers disagree on whether the United States has a larger Jewish population than Israel, with many maintaining that Israel surpassed the United States in Jewish population during the 2000s, while others maintain that the United States still has the largest Jewish population in the world. Currently, a major national Jewish population survey is planned to ascertain whether or not Israel has overtaken the United States in Jewish population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/demographic_duo/item/israel_may_be_main_topic_in_next_national_jewish_population_survey_of_the_u |title=Israel May Be Main Topic In Next National Jewish Population Survey of the U.S. |publisher=Jewish Journal |date=14 March 2013 |accessdate=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Western Europe]]'s largest Jewish community, and the third-largest Jewish community in the world, can be found in [[France]], home to between 483,000 and 500,000 Jews, the majority of whom are immigrants or refugees from North African countries such as [[Algeria]], [[Morocco]], and [[Tunisia]] (or their descendants).&lt;ref&gt;Gartner (2001), pp. 410–10.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Kingdom]] has a Jewish community of 292,000. In [[East Europe|Eastern Europe]], the exact figures are difficult to establish. The number of Jews in Russia varies widely according to whether a source uses census data (which requires a person to choose a single nationality among choices that include "Russian" and "Jewish") or eligibility for immigration to Israel (which requires that a person have one or more Jewish grandparents). According to the latter criteria, the heads of the Russian Jewish community assert that up to 1.5 million Russians are eligible for [[aliyah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mskagency.ru/materials/2716461 |title=Исследование: Около 1,5 млн людей с еврейскими корнями проживают в России |trans-title=Study: About 1.5 Million People with Jewish Roots Live in Russia |date=20 October 2017 |publisher=Moscow Urban News Agency |accessdate=28 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.interfax-religion.ru/?act=news&amp;div=57988 |title=В России проживает около миллиона иудеев |trans-title=In Russia, There Are About a Million Jews |date=26 February 2015 |publisher=[[Interfax]] |accessdate=28 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Germany]], the 102,000 Jews registered with the Jewish community are a slowly declining population,&lt;ref&gt;Jewish community in Germany: [https://web.archive.org/web/20131204213637/http://www.zwst.org/cms/documents/178/de_DE/ZWST-Mitgliederstatistik-2012-web.pdf ''Mitgliederstatistik der jüdischen Gemeinden und Landesverbände in Deutschland für das Jahr 2012''], p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; despite the immigration of tens of thousands of Jews from the former [[Soviet Union]] since the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jppi.org.il/uploads/Annual%20Assessment%202007.pdf|title=Annual Assessment 2007|accessdate=3 July 2008|last=Waxman|first=Chaim I.|year=2007|format=PDF|publisher=Jewish People Policy Planning Institute ([[Jewish Agency for Israel]])|pages=40–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of [[Israelis]] also live in Germany, either permanently or temporarily, for economic reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jg-berlin.org/en/service/israelis-in-berlin.html|title=Israelis in Berlin|publisher=Jewish Community of Berlin|accessdate=11 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to 1948, approximately 800,000 Jews were living in lands which now make up the [[Arab world]] (excluding Israel). Of these, just under two-thirds lived in the French-controlled [[Maghreb]] region, 15–20% in the [[Kingdom of Iraq]], approximately 10% in the [[Kingdom of Egypt]] and approximately 7% in the [[Kingdom of Yemen]]. A further 200,000 lived in [[Pahlavi Iran]] and the [[Republic of Turkey]]. Today, around 26,000 Jews live in Arab countries&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=bdAdAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA44#v=onepage The Rebirth of the Middle East], Jerry M. Rosenberg, Hamilton Books, 2009, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; and around 30,000 in [[Iran]] and [[Turkey]]. A small-scale exodus had begun in many countries in the early decades of the 20th century, although the only substantial [[aliyah]] came from [[Yemen]] and [[Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;Reeva S. Simon, Michael M. Laskier, Sara Reguer, [https://books.google.com/books?id=bW7aNxCGDKQC&amp;pg=PA327&amp;lpg=PA327#v=onepage The Jews of the Middle East and North Africa in Modern Times], 2003, p. 327="Before the 1940s only two communities, Yemen and Syria, made substantial aliyah."&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries|exodus from Arab and Muslim countries]] took place primarily from 1948. The first large-scale exoduses took place in the late 1940s and early 1950s, primarily in [[Iraq]], Yemen and [[Libya]], with up to 90% of these communities leaving within a few years. The peak of the exodus from [[Egypt]] occurred in 1956. The exodus in the Maghreb countries peaked in the 1960s. [[Lebanon]] was the only Arab country to see a temporary increase in its Jewish population during this period, due to an influx of refugees from other Arab countries, although by the mid-1970s the Jewish community of Lebanon had also dwindled. In the aftermath of the exodus wave from Arab states, an additional migration of [[Iranian Jews]] peaked in the 1980s when around 80% of Iranian Jews left the country.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Outside [[Europe]], the [[Americas]], the [[Middle East]], and the rest of [[Asia]], there are significant Jewish populations in [[Australia]] (112,500) and [[Jewish population of South Africa|South Africa]] (70,000).&lt;ref name="JVIL2010" /&gt; There is also a 7,500-strong community in [[New Zealand]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}.

==== Assimilation ====
{{main|Jewish assimilation|Interfaith marriage in Judaism}}
Since at least the time of the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]], a proportion of Jews have assimilated into the wider non-Jewish society around them, by either choice or force, ceasing to practice Judaism and losing their [[Jewish identity]].&lt;ref name=Johnson171&gt;Johnson (1987), p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; Assimilation took place in all areas, and during all time periods,&lt;ref name=Johnson171 /&gt; with some Jewish communities, for example the [[Kaifeng Jews]] of [[China]], disappearing entirely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shavei.org/communities/kaifeng_jews/articles-kaifeng_jews/chinese-jews-reverence-for-ancestors/ |title=Chinese Jews: Reverence for Ancestors |last=Edinger |first=Bernard |date=15 December 2005 |publisher=Shavei Israel |accessdate=2 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003094552/http://www.shavei.org/communities/kaifeng_jews/articles-kaifeng_jews/chinese-jews-reverence-for-ancestors/ |archivedate=3 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The advent of the Jewish Enlightenment of the 18th century (see [[Haskalah]]) and the subsequent [[Jewish emancipation|emancipation of the Jewish populations]] of Europe and America in the 19th century, accelerated the situation, encouraging Jews to increasingly participate in, and become part of, [[Secularism|secular society]]. The result has been a growing trend of assimilation, as Jews marry non-Jewish spouses and stop participating in the Jewish community.&lt;ref&gt;Elazar (2003), p. 434.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rates of [[Interfaith marriage|interreligious marriage]] vary widely: In the United States, it is just under 50%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NJPS: Defining and Calculating Intermarriage |url=http://www.jewishfederations.org/page.aspx?id=46252 |accessdate=2 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812024158/http://www.jewishfederations.org/page.aspx?id=46252 |archivedate=12 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the United Kingdom, around 53%; in France; around 30%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akadem.org/medias/documents/Rapport-Erik-Cohen.pdf|title=Les juifs de France: La lente progression des mariages mixtes|last=Cohen|first=Erik H.|date=November 2002|publisher=Akadem|language=French|accessdate=11 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Australia and Mexico, as low as 10%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australia|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/communities/show/id/2|publisher=World Jewish Congress|accessdate=2 April 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120521082932/http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/communities/show/id/2|archivedate=21 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Virtual Jewish History Tour&amp;nbsp;– Mexico|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Mexico.html|accessdate=7 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, only about a third of children from intermarriages affiliate with Jewish religious practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jppi.org.il/uploads/Annual%20Assessment%202007.pdf|title=Annual Assessment 2007|accessdate=3 July 2008|last=Waxman|first=Chaim I.|year=2007|format=PDF|publisher=Jewish People Policy Planning Institute ([[Jewish Agency for Israel]])|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result is that most countries in the [[Jewish diaspora|Diaspora]] have steady or slightly declining religiously Jewish populations as Jews continue to assimilate into the countries in which they live.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

The Jewish people and [[Judaism]] have experienced various [[persecution]]s throughout [[Jewish history]]. During [[Late Antiquity]] and the [[Early Middle Ages]] the [[Roman Empire]] (in its later phases known as the [[Byzantine Empire]]) repeatedly repressed the [[History of the Jews in the Roman Empire|Jewish population]], first by ejecting them from their homelands during the pagan [[Roman era]] and later by officially establishing them as [[Justinian I#Suppression of religions|second-class citizens]] during the Christian Roman era.&lt;ref&gt;Goldenberg (2007), pp. 131, 135–36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnson (1987), pp. 164–65.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[James P. Carroll|James Carroll]], "Jews accounted for 10% of the total population of the [[Roman Empire]]. By that ratio, if other factors had not intervened, there would be 200&amp;nbsp;million Jews in the world today, instead of something like 13&amp;nbsp;million."&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, James.

Later in [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Western Europe]], further persecutions of Jews by Christians occurred, notably during the [[Crusades]]—when Jews all over Germany [[Rhineland massacres|were massacred]]—and a series of expulsions from the [[Edict of Expulsion|Kingdom of England]], Germany, France, and, in the [[Alhambra Decree|largest expulsion of all]], Spain and Portugal after the [[Reconquista]] (the Catholic Reconquest of the [[Iberian Peninsula]]), where both unbaptized Sephardic Jews and the ruling [[Muslim]] [[Moors]] were expelled.&lt;ref name="Johnson207-208" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnson213plus" /&gt;

In the [[Papal States]], which existed until 1870, Jews were required to live only in specified neighborhoods called [[ghetto]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson (1987), pp. 243–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Islam and Judaism]] have a complex relationship. Traditionally Jews and Christians living in Muslim lands, known as [[dhimmis]], were allowed to practice their religions and administer their internal affairs, but they were subject to certain conditions.&lt;ref name="Bernard1020"&gt;Lewis (1984), pp. 10, 20&lt;/ref&gt; They had to pay the [[jizya]] (a per capita tax imposed on free adult non-Muslim males) to the Islamic state.&lt;ref name="Bernard1020" /&gt; Dhimmis had an inferior status under Islamic rule. They had several social and legal [[Disabilities (Jewish)|disabilities]] such as prohibitions against bearing arms or giving testimony in courts in cases involving Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1987), pp. 9, 27&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the disabilities were highly symbolic. The one described by [[Bernard Lewis]] as "most degrading"&lt;ref name=Lewis131 /&gt; was the requirement of [[Yellow badge|distinctive clothing]], not found in the [[Quran]] or [[hadith]] but invented in [[Early Middle Ages|early medieval]] [[Baghdad]]; its enforcement was highly erratic.&lt;ref name=Lewis131&gt;Lewis (1999), p.131&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Jews rarely faced martyrdom or exile, or forced compulsion to change their religion, and they were mostly free in their choice of residence and profession.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1999), p. 131; (1984), pp. 8, 62&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable exceptions include the massacre of Jews and forcible conversion of some Jews by the rulers of the [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohad]] dynasty in [[Al-Andalus]] in the 12th century,&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1984), p. 52; Stillman (1979), p.77&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in [[Islamic conquest of Persia|Islamic Persia]],&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1984), pp. 17–18, 94–95; Stillman (1979), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; and the forced confinement of Moroccan Jews to walled quarters known as [[mellah]]s beginning from the 15th century and especially in the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1984), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; In modern times, it has become commonplace for standard [[Anti-Zionism and antisemitism|antisemitic themes to be conflated with anti-Zionist]] publications and pronouncements of Islamic movements such as [[Hezbollah]] and [[Hamas]], in the pronouncements of various agencies of the [[Iran|Islamic Republic of Iran]], and even in the newspapers and other publications of Turkish [[Refah Partisi]]."&lt;ref name=Lewis_MEQ&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meforum.org/396/muslim-anti-semitism|title=Muslim Anti-Semitism|first=Bernard|last=Lewis|authorlink=Bernard Lewis|work=Middle East Quarterly|publisher=Middle East Forum|date=June 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout history, many rulers, empires and nations have oppressed their Jewish populations or sought to eliminate them entirely. Methods employed ranged from [[Deportation|expulsion]] to outright [[genocide]]; within nations, often the threat of these extreme methods was sufficient to silence dissent. The [[history of antisemitism]] includes the [[First Crusade]] which resulted in the massacre of Jews;&lt;ref name="Johnson207-208"&gt;Johnson (1987), pp. 207–08.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Spanish Inquisition]] (led by [[Tomás de Torquemada]]) and the [[Portuguese Inquisition]], with their persecution and ''[[Auto-da-fé|autos-da-fé]]'' against the [[New Christians]] and [[Marrano]] Jews;&lt;ref&gt;Johnson (1987), pp. 226–29.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Bohdan Chmielnicki]] [[Cossack]] massacres in [[Ukraine]];&lt;ref&gt;Johnson (1987), pp. 259–60.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Pogrom]]s backed by the Russian [[List of Russian rulers|Tsars]];&lt;ref name="Johnson 1987, pp. 364–5"&gt;Johnson (1987), pp. 364–65.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as expulsions from Spain, Portugal, England, France, Germany, and other countries in which the Jews had settled.&lt;ref name="Johnson213plus"&gt;Johnson (1987), pp. 213, 229–31.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2008 study published in the [[American Journal of Human Genetics]], 19.8% of the modern [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] population has Sephardic Jewish ancestry,&lt;ref name="Adams2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adams|first=Susan M.|year=2008|title=The Genetic Legacy of Religious Diversity and Intolerance: Paternal Lineages of Christians, Jews, and Muslims in the Iberian Peninsula|journal=The American Journal of Human Genetics|volume=83|issue=6|pages=725–36|issn=0002-9297|doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2008.11.007|pmid=19061982|pmc=2668061}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicating that the number of [[converso]]s may have been much higher than originally thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/04/world/europe/04iht-gene.4.18411385.html|title=DNA study shows 20 percent of Iberian population has Jewish ancestry|newspaper=The New York Times|date=4 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.cell.com/AJHG/fulltext/S0002-9297(08)00592-2|title=The Genetic Legacy of Religious Diversity and Intolerance: Paternal Lineages of Christians, Jews, and Muslims in the Iberian Peninsula|publisher=Cell.com|work=American Society of Human Genetics|date=December 2008|accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout Jewish history, Jews have repeatedly been directly or indirectly expelled from both their original homeland, the [[Land of Israel]], and many of the areas in which they have settled. This experience as [[Jewish refugees|refugees]] has shaped [[Jewish identity]] and religious practice in many ways, and is thus a major element of Jewish history.&lt;ref&gt;de Lange (2002), pp. 41–43.&lt;/ref&gt; The patriarch [[Abraham]] is described as a migrant to the land of [[Canaan]] from [[Ur of the Chaldees|Ur]] of the [[Chaldea|Chaldees]]&lt;ref&gt;Johnson (1987), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; after an attempt on his life by King [[Nimrod]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Jewish Encyclopedia|title=NIMROD|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/11548-nimrod|first1=Emil G.|last1=Hirsch|authorlink1=Emil G.

Centuries later, [[Assyria]]n policy was to deport and displace conquered peoples, and it is estimated some 4,500,000 among captive populations suffered this dislocation over 3 centuries of Assyrian rule.&lt;ref name="Smith-Christopher" /&gt; With regard to Israel, [[Tiglath-Pileser III]] claims he deported 80% of the population of [[Lower Galilee]], some 13,520 people.&lt;ref&gt;Baruch Halpern, in Jerrold S.

Many Jews were exiled again by the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Johnson (1987), p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; The 2,000 year dispersion of the [[Jewish diaspora]] beginning under the [[Roman Empire]],{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} as Jews were spread throughout the Roman world and, driven from land to land,{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} settled wherever they could live freely enough to practice their religion. Over the course of the diaspora the center of Jewish life moved from [[History of the Jews in Iraq|Babylonia]]&lt;ref&gt;Johnson (1987), p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[Golden age of Jewish culture in the Iberian Peninsula|Iberian Peninsula]]&lt;ref&gt;Johnson (1987), p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; to [[History of the Jews in Poland|Poland]]&lt;ref&gt;Johnson (1987), p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[Jewish American|United States]]&lt;ref&gt;Johnson (1987), p. 460.&lt;/ref&gt; and, as a result of [[Zionism]], back to [[Israel]].&lt;ref name="Gartner431"&gt;Gartner (2001), p. 431.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were also many expulsions of Jews during the Middle Ages and Enlightenment in Europe, including: 1290, 16,000 Jews were expelled from England, see the ''([[Statute of Jewry]])''; in 1396, 100,000 from France; in 1421&amp;nbsp;thousands were expelled from Austria. Many of these Jews settled in [[Eastern Europe]], especially Poland.&lt;ref name="Gartner 11-12"&gt;Gartner (2001), pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Spanish Inquisition]] in 1492, the Spanish population of around 200,000 [[Sephardi]]c Jews were expelled by the Spanish crown and [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic church]], followed by expulsions in 1493 in Sicily (37,000 Jews) and Portugal in 1496. The expelled Jews fled mainly to the [[Ottoman Empire]], the Netherlands, and [[North Africa]], others migrating to [[Southern Europe]] and the Middle East.&lt;ref name="Johnson229-231"&gt;Johnson (1987), pp. 229–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 19th century, France's policies of equal citizenship regardless of religion led to the immigration of Jews (especially from Eastern and Central Europe).&lt;ref name="Johnson 1987, p. 306"&gt;Johnson (1987), p. 306.&lt;/ref&gt; This contributed to the arrival of millions of Jews in the [[New World]]. Over two million Eastern European Jews arrived in the United States from 1880 to 1925.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson (1987), p. 370.&lt;/ref&gt;

In summary, the [[pogrom]]s in Eastern Europe,&lt;ref name="Johnson 1987, pp. 364–365"&gt;Johnson (1987), pp. 364–365.&lt;/ref&gt; the rise of modern [[antisemitism]],&lt;ref name="Gartner 2001, pp. 213–5"&gt;Gartner (2001), pp. 213–5.&lt;/ref&gt; the Holocaust,&lt;ref&gt;Gartner (2001), pp. 357–70.&lt;/ref&gt; and the rise of [[Arab nationalism]]&lt;ref&gt;Johnson (1987), pp. 529–30.&lt;/ref&gt; all served to fuel the movements and migrations of huge segments of Jewry from land to land and continent to continent, until they arrived back in large numbers at their original historical homeland in Israel.&lt;ref name="Gartner431" /&gt;

In the latest phase of migrations, the [[Iranian Revolution|Islamic Revolution of Iran]] caused many [[Iranian Jews]] to flee Iran. Most found refuge in the US (particularly [[Los Angeles, California]] and [[Long Island, New York]]) and Israel. Smaller communities of Persian Jews exist in Canada and Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Netzer|first=Amnon|editor=Fred Skolnik|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]|title=Iran|edition=2d|year=2007|publisher=Thomson Gale|volume=10|location=Farmington Hills, Mich.|isbn=0-02-865928-7|page=13|ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, when the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985–1991)#Dissolution of the USSR|Soviet Union collapsed]], many of the Jews in the affected territory (who had been [[refusenik]]s) were suddenly allowed to leave. This produced a wave of migration to Israel in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="Dosick 2007, p. 340" /&gt;

==== Growth ====
[[File:A man prays at the Western Wall in Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|A man praying at the [[Western Wall]]]]
Israel is the only country with a Jewish population that is consistently growing through [[natural population growth]], although the Jewish populations of other countries, in Europe and North America, have recently increased through immigration. In the Diaspora, in almost every country the Jewish population in general is either declining or steady, but [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and [[Haredi]] Jewish communities, whose members often shun [[birth control]] for religious reasons, have experienced rapid population growth.&lt;ref&gt;Gartner (2001), pp. 400–01.&lt;/ref&gt;

Orthodox and [[Conservative Judaism]] discourage [[proselytism]] to non-Jews, but many Jewish groups have tried to reach out to the assimilated Jewish communities of the Diaspora in order for them to reconnect to their Jewish roots. Additionally, while in principle [[Reform Judaism]] favors seeking new members for the faith, this position has not translated into active proselytism, instead taking the form of an effort to reach out to non-Jewish spouses of intermarried couples.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan (2003), p. 301.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a trend of Orthodox movements reaching out to secular Jews in order to give them a stronger [[Jewish identity]] so there is less chance of intermarriage. As a result of the efforts by these and other Jewish groups over the past 25 years, there has been a trend (known as the [[Baal teshuva movement]]) for secular Jews to become more religiously observant, though the demographic implications of the trend are unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Danzger (2003), pp. 495–96.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, there is also a growing rate of conversion to [[Jews by Choice]] of [[gentiles]] who make the decision to head in the direction of becoming Jews.&lt;ref&gt;de Lange (2002), p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Upanayanam.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Karnavedham]] of Brahmin boy (both ears pierced)]]
'''Karnavedha''' ({{lang-sa|कर्णवेध}}, {{IAST|Karṇavedha}}) or  '''Karnavedham''' is one of the sixteen major [[Sanskara (rite of passage)|sanskaras]] (sacraments) known as "Shodasha Sanskaras" of [[Sanatana Dharma]].  It is an [[ear piercing]] ceremony that is typically performed between the first and fifth year of life. This can also be performed during later years. &lt;ref&gt;Pandey, R.B. (1962, reprint 2003). ''The Hindu Sacraments (Sanskāra)'' in S. Radhakrishnan (ed.) ''The Cultural Heritage of India'', Vol.II, Kolkata:The Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture, {{ISBN|81-85843-03-1}}, p.402&lt;/ref&gt;

Brahmins, especially those studying the [[vedas]], usually undergo karnavedha and the other samskaras during the course of their lifetime. The samskaras are mentioned in the  [[Brahmana]] portion of the  [[vedas]]. Some scholars advise that the performance of karnavedha should be considered just as important as [[upanayanam]] (sacred thread ceremony - another major samskara ) and the other sacraments as each holds its own symbolic spiritual value. 

While equally recommended for males and females, in modern times, karnavedha has become an uncommon practice amongst males. 

Karnavedha is considered a vedic rite of passage with symbolic spiritual significance. Some believe that it is intended to open the inner ears for receiving sacred sounds. Hearing of sacred sounds with concentration is considered meritorious in that it cleanses the mind and nurtures the spirit. 

During certain medieval periods, "karnavedha" became associated with religious attire and its performance became obligatory to the extent that its non-performance became regarded as sinful among some communities.

The '''Limbu''' (ᤕᤠᤰᤌᤢᤱ) ([[Exonym and endonym|exonym]]) or '''Yakthung''' ([[Exonym and endonym|endonym]]) ({{IPA-all|yɑkthuŋ}}) are [[limbu people]] indigenous and native to the [[Himalaya]]n [[Limbuwan]] region of Eastern [[Nepal]],and from the eastern of Tibet, Northern [[Sikkim, India]] and Western [[Bhutan]].&lt;ref&gt;State government and politics, Sikkim By Nirmalananda Sengupta Sterling, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Evaluation Of Man And The Modern Society In Sikkim By Jash Raj Subba, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P.6 History, Culture and Customs of Sikkim, J. R. Subba, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The original name of Limbus is Yakthung, ''Yakthumba'' or ''Yakthungba'' (ᤕᤠᤰᤌᤢᤱ). Limbu males and Limbu females are called “Yakthumma" or "Yakthungma". In Ancient texts believe that "Yakthung" or "Yakthum" is a derivative from China and some interpret its meaning as the "Yaksha winner".&lt;ref&gt;P.20 The culture and religion of Limbus By Chaitanya Subba, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; In Limbu language it means "heroes of the hills" (Yak - hills, thung or thum - heroes or mighty warriors), which connotation with ancient Kiratas.&lt;ref&gt;The culture and religion of Limbus By Chaitanya Subba, K.B.

Their history is stated to be written in a book called Bhongsoli also known as Vanisavali of which copies are kept in some of the most ancient families.&lt;ref&gt;Linguistic Survey of India, Volume 3, Part 1 By Office of the superintendent of government printing, 1909&lt;/ref&gt; There are hundreds of [[Limbu Clans and Tribes]]. Each Limbu clans are classified under their Tribe or subnational entity or according to their place of origin.

The Chinese text ''Po-ou-Yeo-Jing'',{{which|date=January 2015}} translated in 308 AD, refers to the Yi-ti-Sai (barbarians bordering on the north), a name which is an exact equivalent of Kiratas.&lt;ref&gt;Saklani, Dinesh Prasad ''Ancient communities of the Himalaya'' Indus Publishing Company, India (1 Mar 2002) {{ISBN|978-81-7387-090-3}} p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Sylvain Levi|Levi, Sylvain]] ''Le Nepal'' Asian Educational Services, India; Facsimile edition (20 Dec 2007){{ISBN|978-81-206-0580-0}} p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Limbus were also one of the earliest inhabitants of [[Sikkim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = The Limbus: A South Eastern Himalayan Kirata People | year = 1979| last = Sanyal| first = Dr. Chanru Chandra| publisher = Dipti Printing | page = 7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Navigating Social Exclusion and Inclusion in Contemporary India and Beyond: Structures, Agents, Practices (Anthem South Asian Studies) | year = 2014 | last = Skoda | first = Uwe | publisher = Anthem Press | location = | isbn = 978-1783083404| page = 137 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their estimated population of 700,000 is mainly centred in the districts of [[Sankhuwasabha District|Sankhuwasabha]], [[Terhathum District|Tehrathum]], [[Dhankuta District|Dhankuta]], [[Taplejung]], [[Morang District|Morang]], [[Sunsari District|Sunsari]], [[Jhapa District|Jhapa]], [[Panchthar District|Panchthar]], [[Ilam District|Ilam]], [[Kathmandu District|Kathmandu]], [[Nakhipot]], [[Lalitpur District, Nepal|Lalitpur]] and [[Bhaktapur District|Bhaktapur]] in [[Nepal]]. These are all within the [[Mechi Zone|Mechi]] and [[Kosi Zone]]s or "[[Limbuwan]]". Portions of the Limbu population are also located in the east and west districts of [[Sikkim]]. A smaller number are scattered throughout the cities of [[Darjeeling]] and [[Kalimpong]] in [[West Bengal]], [[Assam]], [[Nagaland]] and in north and [[south Sikkim]], [[Bhutan]], [[Burma]], and others have recently migrated to the [[United Kingdom]], [[Hong Kong]], the [[United States]] and many other countries.

==Culture==
[[File:Limbuwomendrinktongba.jpg|Limbu women with traditional clothing and traditional [[tongba]] drink.|right|thumb]]

Limbus practice many of their own life cycle rituals. They believe that lineage is not transmitted patrilineally. Rather, a woman inherits her mother's gods, and when she marries and lives with her husband she brings with her the deities that will then be recognized as the household deities.

Limbu bury their dead and observe for two-to-three days through practiced death rituals. During death ceremony, they put the head of dead in chares ko thal and coin on forehead. They block the nose, ear and put alcohol on the lips of the dead body. Nikwasamma is a dead ritual done to cleanse the house by Phedangma. Relatives, neighbours, and visitors bring money as respect and put an offering on the top of the dead body. Sons of dead body shave head and eyebrows to respect the body of the dead. They will be known as the new hier in the family. They buried the dead body covered with white cloth in wooden box. The length of the mourning period varies depending on the gender of the deceased. Weddings, mourning, gift exchanges, and settlement of conflicts involve consumption of alcohol i.e. liquor, especially the Limbu traditional beer popularly known as thee which is also drunk in a container called [[Tongba]]. Dancing parties are arranged for visitors to the village. These affairs give the young Limbu girls and boys a chance to meet and enjoy dancing and drinking.

===Attire and ornaments===
[[File:Dhannach.JPG|thumb|260x260px|Yalang{{yɑˀlɑ:ŋ}} (''Nep. ''Dhan nach), paddy dance, in Taplejung, Nepal

The traditional dress of the Limbus are mekhli and taga.

While performing mangsewa {{IPA-all|mɑŋsewɑ}} (God+worship), Yakthung  {{IPA-all|yɑkthuŋ}} people wear mekhli and taga in white colour as it symbolizes purity.

[[Dhaka fabric|Dhaka]] is the traditional fabric of the Limbus which are made by weaving it in geometric patterns in a handloom.&lt;ref&gt;p.15 Rural Enterprise: Case Studies from Developing Ccountries By Malcolm Harper, Shailendra Vyakarnam Intermediate Technology Publications, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; The art of making dhaka is taught by one generation to another. You will always see a Limbu man clad in dhaka topi (hat) and scarf, and a Limbu lady in dhaka saree, mekhli, blouse and shawl.

In the olden days, the Limbus were skilled in silk farming.&lt;ref&gt;Chaintanya Subba, The Culture and Religion of Limbus, K.B. Subba, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; The Kiratis were also known as silk traders.&lt;ref&gt;Kumar Pradhan, The Gurkha Conquests, Oxford University Press, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; According to JB Subba and Iman Xin Chemjong, the Kirat is a corrupt form of kereta, silkworm.

Nowadays, traditional Limbu ornaments are used by different ethnic groups and can be found in other parts of Nepal. This is due to the sold by different jewelry shops often referring Nepali.

This form of clothing was worn until Nepal forced "one religion, one dress, one language" policy which is why many Limbus in Nepal wear the traditional Nepalese dress, chaubandi cholo and daura sural. The Yakthung of Sikkim still wear traditional Limbu clothing. Many efforts are being made by groups such as Yakthung Chumlung to raise awareness on the cultural dress and heritage.

==Limbu (Limboo) traditional Architecture==
The house of Limbus is a symbolic representation of a feminine character and Yuma — a goddess of the Limbu community. The details of the windows and doors are embroidered with wood carvings depicting different flowers which are used by the Limbus during rituals. Some decorative embroideries done in the wood carvings of the door and windows of the house are the direct representation of gold jewelry worn by Limbu women. In a traditional house of the Limboos, the skirting of the wall is generally painted manually with red mud paint. This is also a symbolic representation of the ''patuka'' or the belt worn by the Limboo women. There is numerous symbolism including number symbolism usually 3 and 9 in the house which is inspired by the beliefs of the tribal people. The major distinct element of the house in the ''muring-sitlam'' or the main pillar/column of the house which is in the centre of the house in the ground floor. This pillar is generally believed by the Limboo people as the shrine where Yuma goddess resides in the house. Thus to pay their gratitude they perform ritualistic prayers and offerings around the pillar, twice a year. These houses can be found at Eastern Nepal and western part of Sikkim, India. These houses are similar to other communities also due to acculturation between different communities living in the vicinity. The evolution of the form and spaces of the houses have been inspired by the everyday lifestyle and culture of the people which is similar in many communities. Therefore nowadays a Limboo house is difficult to identify through an exterior perspective. This has been intervened by the introduction of display of the symbol called ''Silam-sakma'' in the house elevation which is apparently a ritualistic element used by the ''phedangmas'' or tribal priests and has been a symbol/logo for identifying the Limboo community. This symbol is seemingly diamond in shape and has 9 concentric diamond shapes supported by two axes at the centre, one vertically and one horizontally. These days, this symbol is emerging to be visible more often in the entry gates, balcony railing of the house and the most conspicuous location is the woolen batch worn by the community people on their left chest during an occasion or event. 
In the present scenario, these houses are now endangered and are hardly built due to the adaptation of modern architecture. Also the reason that the poor house owner are unable to bear expenses for wood carvings for the embroideries, thus resulting in the extinction of local craftsmen and hence the traditional design itself.

==Flag==
{{Main article|Limbuwan}}
The Limbu people have their own flag. The blue represents the bodies of water and the sky, the white represents air and peace, and the red represents the earth and pure blood of the Limbu people. The sun in the centre represents various Limbu spiritual practices and everyday living. The use and recognition of the flag ended in the eighteenth century during the Gorkha invasion. [[Limbuwan]] organisations use the flag in [[Limbuwan]] laaje  {{IPA-all|la:jeˀ}} areas.

==Lifestyle==
The Limbus traditionally practiced subsistence farming. Rice and maize comprised their principal crops. Although there is an abundance of arable land, productivity is greatly limited by insufficient technology. Excess crops are often traded for food that cannot be grown in the region. Limbu Women weave [[Dhaka fabric]] cloth on their traditional small hand looms made from bamboo and wood.&lt;ref&gt;Rural Enterprise: Case Studies from Developing Countries, Front Cover By Malcolm Harper, Shailendra Vyakarnam, Intermediate Technology Publications, 1988 - Cooperative societies - 105 pages, P.15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wedding practices==
{{Main article|Limbu clans and tribes}}
Limbus generally marry within their own community. A Limbu will not be allowed to marry their own clans for up to 7 generations back to ensure that they are not related. Cross-cousin marriage is not allowed in Limbu culture. Marriage between a man and the widow of his elder brother can take place if they mutually agree. Marriage between a man and a woman outside the clan is also possible either by arrangement or by mutual consent of the man and woman in question. It is conventionally said that the customs and traditions of Limbus were established in the distant past by Sawa Yethang  {{IPA-all|sawa yethaŋ}} (council of eight kings). The marriages are mostly arranged by parents or they can also result when a man elopes with a woman.  Asking for a woman's hand is an important ceremony. In that system, the woman can ask for anything, including an amount of gold, silver, etc.  This confirms to the woman's family that the man is financially secure enough to keep their daughter happy. A few days after the wedding, the man's family members have to visit the woman's house with a piglet and some alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, depending upon the financial standard of his house. The most important ceremonies of a Limbu wedding take place in the groom's house rather than the bride's because the bride has to stay with her husband. There are two special dances in this ceremony, one is called "yalakma" or ''dhan nach'' in Nepali (rice harvest dance) and "Kelangma"  {{IPA-all|ke la:ŋma}} or ''[[Chyabrung]] {{IPA-all|cyɑbruŋ}}'' in Nepali. The Yalakma {{IPA-all|yɑˀlɑ:kmɑ}} is characterized by men and women dancing in a slow circle, whereas the Kelangma  {{IPA-all|ke lɑ:ŋmɑ}} consists of complex footwork synchronized with the beat of the drums. Anyone can join the dance, which can last for many hours. The Yalakma {{IPA-all|yɑˀlɑ:kmɑ}} can also be a celebration of the harvest season or other social occasions.

==Religion and festivals==
{{Main article|Mundhum}}
The Limbus follow the social rules and regulation of [[Mundhum]] oral 'scripture' and a religious book.&lt;ref&gt;Ancestral Voices: Oral Ritual Texts and Their Social Contexts Among the Mewahang Rai of East Nepal By Martin Gaenszle Lit, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The high god of the Limbu is called [[Tagera Ningwaphumang]] {{IPA-all|niŋwɑˀphu:mɑŋ}}, which may be translated simply as "Supreme Body of Knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;P.33 Kinship and Marriage Among the Limbu of Eastern Nepal: A Study in Marriage Stability Rex Lee Jones By University of California, Los Angeles, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; Their God  Tagera Ningwaphuma is described as a forceful power the creator of life on earth.&lt;ref&gt;Buddhist Modernities: Re-inventing Tradition in the Globalizing Modern World By Hanna Havnevik, Ute Hüsken, Mark Teeuwen, Vladimir Tikhonov, Koen Wellens Routledge, 17 Feb 2017&lt;/ref&gt; In earthly form, Tagera Ningwaphuma is worship as the goddess Yuma Sammang {{IPA-all|yumɒˀ}}  and her male counterpart Theba Sammang.&lt;ref&gt;P.37 Images of Sikkim: the land, people, and culture By Ramesh Sharma, Sikkim, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; The deity Yuma {{IPA-all|yumɒˀ}} (literally: "Grandmother" or "Mother Earth") known as "Yuma Samyo" or "Niwaphuma" is the most important and popular among some Limbus and is worshiped in all occasions. Yuma  {{IPA-all|yumɒˀ}}is the mother of all the Limbus, therefore one regards his or her mother as a goddess. They also have many different classes of ritual specialists, of which "Phedangma {{IPA-all|phɛdɑŋmɑ}}", "Yema/Yeba"  {{IPA-all|yɛma/yɛba}}, and "Shamba" are some. Their religion is enshrined in the evergreen Cynodondactylon (Dubo) grass. Traditionally, the Limbu bury their dead, but due to the influence from other Hindus, cremation is becoming more popular. Limbu people also have their own clergy, such as Phedangma {{IPA-all|phɛdaŋmɑ}}, Samba, Yeba (male) Yeba-Yema  {{IPA-all|yɛba/yɛma}} (female).But now most of the Limbu people follow Kirat religion also. As of the changing time, some of the Limbu people are Christian and Hindu also but it is believed that their main religion is Mundhum. A very different reformist tradition was established by the Limbu guru [[Phalgunanda]], who established the 'Satyahang' religion.&lt;ref&gt;P.141 Migration and Religion in Europe: Comparative Perspectives on South Asian Experiences By Ester Gallo, 22 Apr 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional music and singing styles==
[[File:Kirati Limbu women performing Kelang dance.jpg|Kirati Limbu women performing Kelang  {{IPA-all|ke:lɑ:ŋ}}dance during the festival of Kirat festival Udhauli 2012 in Sydney.|right|thumb]] Limbus residing in Sikkim, Darjeeling, Assam, Nepal, Bhutan and Burma have their own identity because of a strong belief in "Yumawad". Yumawad is a type of religious scripture which has been kept alive by their religious leaders and handed down verbally from generation to generation. Some of the retellings of Yumawad are also included in Limbu traditional music with social stories, dreams, and everyday life. There has been a rich tradition of Limbus singing their folk songs. Their folk songs can be divided into the following groups:

# ''Khyali'' - a conversational song in which young lash and lads sing in very poetic expressions and in a very sweet tone.
# Traditional Love Songs -
## ''Sakpa Palam  {{IPA-all|pɑ:lɑm}}Samlo'' - This song is sung during the Kusakpa Yaalang {{IPA-all|yɑˀlɑ:ŋ}} dance in a fast beat.
## ''Kemba Palam  {{IPA-all|pɑ:lɑm}}Samlo'' - This song is sung during the Kemba Yeaaˀlang dance in a slow beat.
## ''Domke Akma Palam  {{IPA-all|pɑ:lɑm}} Samlo'' - It is sung when doing the normal chores and also during the Domke Akma dance.
# ''Hakpare Samlo'' - this song is sung by middle-aged men and women who have interest in Mundhum and who are well versed in it. One can find spiritual and worldly specialties in this song.
# ''Nisammang  {{IPA-all|nisɑmmɑŋ}}Sewa Samlo'' - This song is sung during religious functions. It is a devotional song. Dancing is an important aspect of life among Limbus. Based on acting style, the following types of dances are performed:
## Dance performed after origin of life: This type of dance is known as Ke Lang or [[Chyabrung]] dance. The dance imitates the actions of animals, insects and any form of living beings.
## Agricultural dance: Under this type of dance there are -
### ''Yea Kakma''- This dance is performed in the evening after the crops are reaped.
### ''Damke Akme''- This dance is performed while sowing crops.
## War dance: This form of dance is known as 'Nahangma {{IPA-all|nɑ.hɑŋmɑ}}'. It is performed during "Nahangma {{IPA-all|nɑ.hɑŋmɑ}}"- their religious function. Before Nahangma dance, Manggena traditional ritual is performed at home and all the blood relatives, cousins are present.  During Manggena, stone refer as god with red tika offered is put on banana leaf. A large adult black homegrown pig is killed and present to phedangba. A [[Junglefowl]] is given to each person according to match with person's age and gender same as of their [[Junglefowl]]. Person who cannot be present due to problems will be done by their closest family member on their behalf. Phedangba say vision of each person when they present their own [[Junglefowl]] and later Phedangma beheaded the Junglefowl and sprinkle the blood. They eat their own charcoal burned Junglefowl liver with salt eaten with rice. The rest of meat are prepared for meal Bhutuwa or mixed yangben with rice for dinner. After the Manggena, Nahangma is performed that his spirit has become strong and reached at the top of Chuklung and returned from Chuklung. Chuklung means top of Himalayas. However, this can be done by only those who have no father. In this dance, only adult males and "Shamani" priests can take part. During the dance,they carry a [[Kukri|Phedza]]&lt;ref&gt;P.496 A Grammar of Limbu, Front Cover By George van Driem, Walter de Gruyter, 1 Jan 1987 - Language Arts &amp; Disciplines - 593 pages&lt;/ref&gt; in their right hand and a domesticated young adult male [[Junglefowl]] in their left hand or sword in their right hand and a shield in their left hand, or an arrow in their right hand and a bow in their left hand.

==Traditional sports==
For the Limbu people, Archery has always been considered as the main traditional sport. Archery often involves religious demonstrations and rituals. Historically, Limbu [[cavalry]] archers were important when resisting invasions before the pre-Nepal era. The word ''Limbu'' itself came from the word ''Lim-pfungh'' which in translation means "Shooting-Arrows" or "Act of archery".

There are legends about the beginning of the Limbuwan Gorkha war. In these legends, a Gorkha Military General met a Yakthung {{IPA-all|yɑkthuŋ}} hunter in a forest. When the General asked the hunter about his presence and what he was doing, the Yakthung {{IPA-all|yɑkthuŋ}} hunter replied "Lim-pfungh". The Gorkha army later experienced the fierceness from the Yakthung {{IPA-all|yɑkthuŋ}}-Tribes' horseback archers for years during the Gorkha-Limbu war. Thus, the name "Limbu" was recorded on the papers of the Gorkhas to describe the Yakthung {{IPA-all|yɑkthuŋ}} people. However, after the success of Gorkha invasion, horse breeding and keeping declined swiftly in Limbu territories.

Bare-hand Wrestling has also been practised among the Limbu men during festivals. This was also used to settle personal matters after a festive drinking in which the losing wrestler would have to pay the winner by buying him a drink or inviting him to his house for a drink of traditional [[tongba]] {{IPA-all|tɔ:ŋbɑ}}. ''na:nchiŋma'' is the term for wrestling in Yakthung-pan {{IPA-all|yɑkthuŋ pɑ:n}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2226">A '''Maenianum''' was a [[balcony]] or gallery for spectators at a public show in ancient Rome. The name was originally given by [[Roman censor|censor]] [[Gaius Maenius]] in 318 BC to the decorated gallery in the [[Colosseum]], where spectators watched gladiatorial combats.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sextus Pompeius Festus]] 134 M.

The Maenianum was divided into several levels: ''Maenianum Primum'', which was reserved for the non-senatorial noble class called the [[Equites]].

The '''Maison d'Ailleurs''' (translated as "House of Elsewhere") is a museum of [[science fiction]], [[utopia]] and extraordinary journeys in [[Yverdon-les-Bains]] ([[Switzerland]]). It is a non-profit foundation functioning both as a public museum and a specialized research center.

The archives of the museum contain around 70,000 documents related to science fiction or utopia (books, art pieces, toys, etc.), including some very old (as early as the sixteenth century) or unique pieces. The collections of the museum are used for iconographic purposes or research (literature, history of ideas, design, etc.).  The ''Maison d'Ailleurs'' thus represents an important research and documentation center.

In parallel, the museum presents from two to three temporary exhibitions per year, around the main themes of science fiction (cities of the future, space travel, lost worlds, etc.) and its artists: [[H. R. Giger]], [[John Howe (illustrator)|John Howe]], [[James Gurney]], [[Caza]], Jean Fontaine, etc.. The exhibitions favour diversity and openness towards the world, in order to reach a broad audience. The museum also offers itinerary exhibitions and regularly presents its work in Switzerland and abroad. Half a dozen exhibitions are rented per year on average.

The ''Maison d'Ailleurs'' is the only public institution of its kind in the world. It has the status of a non-profit foundation, and therefore isn't directly a communal museum. The Foundation manages the collections owned by the city of Yverdon-les-Bains in the building it has been provided with. Five to seven members of the Foundation board are chosen by the municipality of Yverdon-les-Bains, while two others come from the association ''Amis de la Maison d'Ailleurs'' (''Friends of the House of Elsewhere'').

==History==
The ''Maison d'Ailleurs'' originates from the work of the French encyclopedian [[Pierre Versins]], who dedicated his life to writing and the study of what he named "rational romanesque conjectures" ("conjectures romanesques rationnelles" in French). For more than twenty years, he gathered a very important collection of science fiction works. Based on this corpus, he wrote one of the major books in this domain, the ''[[Encyclopédie de l'utopie, des voyages extraordinaires et de la science-fiction]]''. In 1976, he donated his assets to the city of [[Yverdon-les-Bains]] and the ''Maison d'Ailleurs'' was created. Pierre Versins acts as its curator until he moves back to France in 1981. Initially, the ''Maison d'Ailleurs'' only occupies a three-room flat, and doesn't have the ambition of a museum.

After a lethargy period (during which the direction is held by Pascal Ducommun), the municipality of Yverdon-les-Bains decides in 1989 to install the ''Maison d'Ailleurs'' in the renovated old prison, a historical building built in 1806 and well-situated in the center of the city. The journalist [[Roger Gaillard (journalist)|Roger Gaillard]] (1947–2010) is chosen as its curator and the new museum opens in 1991.

By the end of 1995, the communal council of Yverdon decided to cut
more than 70% of the budget for the next year, which dramatically
reduced the organizational slack of the ''Maison d'Ailleurs'' and
generated a lot of negative reactions.  The majority of the staff was
dismissed.  In 1998, a foundation is created to manage the museum.
Its first decision is to give the direction to historian [[Patrick Gyger]],

[[Image:MDA_EJV_room1_1.JPG|thumb|300px|right|The Jules Verne Exhibition Space]]
In 2003, collector Jean-Michel Margot decided to donate one of the
most important collections dedicated to [[Jules Verne]] to the city of
[[Yverdon-les-Bains]].  The ''Maison d'Ailleurs'' was given the task
to manage and present this collection.

This ''Jules Verne collection'' contains about 20,000 documents,
including rare pieces such as posters dating from the end of the
nineteenth century, hand-written notes, ancient iconography linked to
discovery and scientific adventure, as well as the complete collection
of the ''Voyages Extraordinaires'', owned by the granddaughter of
[[Pierre-Jules Hetzel]], Jules Verne's publisher.

To host these pieces, a new ''Espace Jules Verne" (Jules Verne Exhibition Space) has been
built in the old casino of Yverdon-les-Bains.  In addition to the
public presentation of the collection, a workspace is reserved to
researchers, with a privileged access to documents.  The ''Espace Jules Verne''
is connected to the rest of the museum by a
footbridge.

The administration of the museum and a large collection of [[pulp magazines]] have also been moved to the new building.  This will allow the creation of a permanent exhibition at the ''Maison d'Ailleurs'', in addition to the temporary exhibitions.

The ''Espace Jules Verne'' has opened in October 2008.

==Partnerships==

The ''Maison d'Ailleurs'' represents an ever-expanding research and documentation center, which has built a large network of partners over time.  The museum collaborates with the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA), the [[University of Lausanne]], the [[Cité de l'Espace]] in
Toulouse (France), the International Trade Event in Bordeaux, the
"[[Utopiales]]" festival in Nantes (France), the [[Neuchâtel International Fantastic Film Festival]], and it is part of the
''Science et Cité'' network in the French-speaking part of Switzerland.

Among its studies, the ''Maison d'Ailleurs'' has coordinated an important research funded by the [[ESA]] to try to find, in science fiction works, imaginary inventions related to astronautics and space
conquest technologies.

In a partnership with the [[ESA]] and the ''Agence Martienne'' (Martian Agency), the ''Maison d'Ailleurs'' has realised the most important science fiction image library in the world.  The museum has also been mandated by [[Pro Helvetia]] to prepare an important itinerary exhibition project about Swiss artists working in cinema and video games.

'''Merovingian art''' is the art of the [[Merovingian]] dynasty of the [[Franks]], which lasted from the 5th century to the 8th century in present-day [[France]], [[Benelux]] and a part of [[Germany]].
The advent of the Merovingian dynasty in [[Gaul]] in the 5th century led to important changes in the field of arts.  Sculpture regressed to be little more than a simple technique for the ornamentation of [[sarcophagus|sarcophagi]], [[altars]] and ecclesiastical furniture. On the other hand, [[goldsmith|gold work]] and the new medium of [[Illuminated manuscript|manuscript illumination]] integrated "barbarian" [[Migration Period art|animal-style]] decoration, with [[Late Antique]] motifs, and other contributions from as far as Syria or Ireland to constitute  Merovingian art.

==Architecture==
The unification of the [[Franks|Frankish]] kingdom under [[Clovis I]] (465 &amp;ndash; 511) and his successors, corresponded with the need for the building of churches, and especially monastery churches, as these were now the power-houses of the Merovingian church.  Plans often continued the [[Roman architecture|Roman]] [[basilica]] tradition, but also took influences from as far away as Syria and Armenia.  In the East, most structures were in timber, but stone was more common for significant buildings in the West and in the southern areas that later fell under Merovingian rule.  Most major churches have been rebuilt, usually more than once, but many Merovingian plans have been reconstructed from archaeology.  The description in [[Bishop]] [[Gregory of Tours]]' ''History of the Franks'' of the basilica of Saint-Martin, built at Tours by [[Saint Perpetuus]] (bishop 460-490) at the beginning of the period and at the time on the edge of Frankish territory, gives cause to regret the disappearance of this building, one of the most beautiful Merovingian churches, which he says had 120 marble columns, towers at the East end, and several mosaics: "Saint-Martin displayed the vertical emphasis, and the combination of block-units forming a complex internal space and the correspondingly rich external silhouette, which were to be the hallmarks of the Romanesque".&lt;ref&gt;V.I. Atroshenko and Judith Collins, ''The Origins of the Romanesque'' (Lund Humphries, London) 1985, p. 48. {{ISBN|0-85331-487-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A feature of the basilica of Saint-Martin that became a hallmark of Frankish church architecture was the sarcophagus or reliquary of the saint raised to be visible and sited axially behind the altar, sometimes in the [[apse]].  There are no Roman precedents for this Frankish innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Werner Jacobsen, "Saints' Tombs in Frankish Church Architecture" ''Speculum'' '''72'''.4 (October 1997:1107-1143).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Saint Peter's church, Vienne (Isère)|Saint Peter's church]] in [[Vienne, Isère|Vienne]] is the only surviving one. A number of other buildings, now lost, including the Merovingian foundations of [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]], [[St. Gereon's Basilica|St. Gereon]] in [[Cologne]], and the [[Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés]] in Paris, are described as similarly ornate.

Some small buildings remain, especially [[Baptistery|baptistries]], which fell out of fashion and were spared rebuilding.  In [[Aix-en-Provence]], [[Riez]] and [[Fréjus]], three octagonal [[baptistery|baptistries]], each covered with a cupola on pillars, are testimony to the influence of oriental architecture (the baptistry of Riez, in the [[Alpes-de-Haute-Provence]], recalls that of St.&amp;nbsp;George, Ezra', [[Syria]]). Very different from these Provençal baptistries, except for the quatrefoil one of [[Venasque]], that of [[Baptistère Saint-Jean|St.&amp;nbsp;Jean]] at [[Poitiers]] (6th century) has the form of a rectangle flanked by three apses. The original building has probably undergone a number of alterations but preserves in its decoration (marble capitals) a Merovingian character.

Among the very many [[crypt]]s, numerous due to the importance of the cult of saints at the time, only those of St.&amp;nbsp;Seurin, Bordeaux, [[Grenoble Archaeological Museum|St.&amp;nbsp;Laurent, Grenoble]], and the abbey of [[Jouarre Abbey|Jouarre]] (7th century) survive.

==Other arts==
[[File:Sacr Gelasianum 131v 132.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Gelasian Sacramentary|Sacramentarium Gelasianum]]. Frontispice and Incipit from the [[Vatican Library|Vatican]] manuscript]]
By the 7th century, the abilities of Merovingian craftsmen must have been well regarded, as they were brought to England to re-introduce glass making skills, and Merovingian stonemasons were used to build English churches.&lt;ref name="bede"&gt;Bede. ''The Lives of the Holy Abbots of Wearmouth and Jarrow''.&lt;/ref&gt; Merovingian masons also employed the ''[[opus gallicum]]'' extensively and are responsible for bringing it to England and bequeathing it to the [[Normans]], who brought it to Italy.

Very few Merovingian illuminated manuscripts survive, of which the most richly decorated is the 8th century [[Gelasian Sacramentary]] in the [[Vatican Library]], which has geometric and animal decoration, less complex than that of the [[Insular art]] of the British Isles, but like it derived from metalwork motifs, with some influence from Late Antiquity and the Near-East. The principal centres were the [[Abbey of Luxeuil]], an [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|Irish]] foundation, and later its daughter house at [[Corbie Abbey]].

A large Merovingian art collection in Berlin was taken by Soviet Occupiers to Russia, where it remains to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Effros|first1=Bonnie|title=Uncovering the Germanic Past: Merovingian Archaeology in France, 1830-1914|date=14 June 2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199696710|page=298}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=(www.dw.com)|first1=Deutsche Welle|title=Germany Worried About Losing Out in Looted Art Row {{!}} Culture {{!}} DW.COM {{!}} 16.08.2007|url=http://www.dw.com/en/germany-worried-about-losing-out-in-looted-art-row/a-2738594|accessdate=19 August 2016|work=DW.COM|agency=DW|date=16 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harding|first1=Luke|title=Russia displays looted German treasure|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/mar/13/russia.secondworldwar|accessdate=19 August 2016|work=The Guardian|date=13 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Multilingualism''' is the use of more than one [[language]], either by an individual speaker or by a community of speakers. It is believed that multilingual speakers outnumber [[monolingualism|monolingual]] speakers in the world's population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cal.org/content/download/1803/19986/file/AGlobalPerspectiveonBilingualism.pdf|title=A Global Perspective on Bilingualism and Bilingual Education (1999), G.

People who speak several languages are also called [[polyglotism|polyglots]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/polyglot |title="Polyglot"|work= Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |accessdate=2010-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multilingual speakers have acquired and maintained at least one language during childhood, the so-called [[first language]] (L1). The first language (sometimes also referred to as the mother tongue) is acquired without formal education, by [[Language acquisition|mechanisms]] about which scholars disagree. Children acquiring two languages from these early years are called simultaneous bilinguals. Even in the case of simultaneous bilinguals, one language is usually dominant. 

People who know more than one language have been reported to be more adept at language learning compared to monolinguals.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The bilingual advantage in novel word learning |vauthors=Kaushanskaya M, Marian V |journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=705–710 |year=2009 |doi=10.3758/PBR.16.4.705 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Multilingualism in computing can be considered part of a continuum between [[internationalization and localization]]. Due to the status of [[English in computing]], software development nearly always uses it (but see also [[Non-English-based programming languages]]). Almost all commercial software is initially available in an English version, and multilingual versions, if any, may be produced as alternative options based on the English original.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

== Definition ==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2013}}
The definition of multilingualism is a subject of debate in the same way as the definition of language fluency.  On one end of a sort of linguistic continuum, one may define multilingualism as complete competence and mastery in another language. The speaker would presumably have complete knowledge and control over the language so as to sound native. On the opposite end of the spectrum would be people who know enough phrases to get around as a tourist using the alternate language. Since 1992, [[Vivian Cook (academic)|Vivian Cook]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.viviancook.uk/Writings/Papers/MCentry.htm|title=Multi-competence definition|author=|date=|website=www.viviancook.uk|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171022003750/http://www.viviancook.uk/Writings/Papers/MCentry.htm|archivedate=22 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; has argued that most multilingual speakers fall somewhere between minimal and maximal definitions.&lt;ref name="ParadowskiBator2016"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Paradowski MB, Bator A |title=Perceived effectiveness of language acquisition in the process of multilingual upbringing by parents of different nationalities |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13670050.2016.1203858 |journal=International Journal of Bilingual Education and Bilingualism |pages=1–19 |year=2016 |doi=10.1080/13670050.2016.1203858 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170101022728/http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13670050.2016.1203858 |archivedate=1 January 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cook calls these people ''multi-competent''.
In addition, there is no consistent definition of what constitutes a distinct language. For instance, scholars often disagree whether [[Scots language|Scots]] is a language in its own right or a dialect of [[English language|English]].&lt;ref&gt;[[A.J. Aitken]] in ''The Oxford Companion to the English Language'', Oxford University Press 1992. p.894&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, what is considered a language can change, often for purely political purposes, such as when [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]] was created as a [[standard language]] on the basis of the [[Eastern Herzegovinian dialect]] to function as [[Dachsprache|umbrella]] for numerous [[South Slavic languages|South Slavic]] dialects, and after the breakup of [[Yugoslavia]] was split into [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]] and [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]], or when [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] was dismissed as a Russian dialect by the Russian [[tsar]]s to discourage national feelings.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ems Ukaz]]&lt;/ref&gt;
Many small independent nations' schoolchildren are today compelled to learn multiple languages because of international interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://foreign-language.org/|title=Writing With English As A Second Language|publisher=Foreign-Language.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150421235102/http://foreign-language.org/|archivedate=21 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in Finland, all children are required to learn at least two foreign languages: the other national language (Swedish or Finnish) and one alien language (usually English). Many Finnish schoolchildren also select further languages, such as German or Russian.

In some large nations with multiple languages, such as India, schoolchildren may routinely learn multiple languages based on where they reside in the country. In major metropolitan areas of Central, Southern and Eastern India, many children may be fluent in four languages (the mother tongue, the state language, and the official languages of India, Hindi and English). Thus, a child of Telugu parents living in Bangalore will end up speaking his or her mother tongue (Telugu) at home and the state language (Kannada), Hindi and English in school and life.

==Myths surrounding multilingualism==
Many myths and much prejudice has grown around the notions of bi- and multilingualism in some Western countries where monolingualism is the norm. Researchers from the UK and Poland have listed the most common misconceptions:&lt;ref name="ParadowskiBator2016"/&gt;
* that bi- or multilinguals are exceptions to the ‘default’ monolingual ‘norm’;
* that in order to deserve the label ‘bi-/multilingual’, one needs to have an equal, ‘perfect’, ‘nativelike’ command of both/all of one's languages;
* that childhood bilingualism may be detrimental to both linguistic and cognitive development and consequently lead to poorer results at school;
* that exposing a child to more than one language may cause language impairment or deficits, or that for children already diagnosed with impairments two languages mean too much unnecessary pressure and effort;
* that the children do not have enough time to learn both languages, therefore it is better if they only acquire the majority language.
* that the children would be confused with having the ability to speak two languages and the “tip-of-the-tongue states” For instance, where one knows the meaning and the specific details of a word, but cannot retrieve a word. 
* those bilingual individuals tend to have slightly fewer vocabularies and weaker in “verbal fluency tasks” than the monolingual counterpart 
These are all harmful convictions which have long been debunked,&lt;ref name="ParadowskiBator2016"/&gt; yet still persist among many parents.

==Multilingual individuals==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}
A multilingual person is someone who can communicate in more than one language, either actively (through speaking, writing, or signing) or passively (through listening, reading, or perceiving). More specifically, the terms ''bilingual'' and ''trilingual'' are used to describe comparable situations in which two or three languages are involved. A multilingual person is generally referred to as a [[polyglotism|polyglot]].
Multilingual speakers have acquired and maintained at least one language during childhood, the so-called [[first language]] (L1). The first language (sometimes also referred to as the mother tongue) is acquired without formal education, by mechanisms heavily disputed. Children acquiring two languages in this way are called simultaneous bilinguals. Even in the case of simultaneous bilinguals, one language usually dominates over the other.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Hult, F.M. (2014).  Covert bilingualism and symbolic competence: Analytical reflections on negotiating insider/outsider positionality in Swedish speech situations. ''Applied Linguistics, 35''(1), 63-81.&lt;/ref&gt;
In linguistics, first language acquisition is closely related to the concept of a "native speaker". According to a view widely held by linguists, a native speaker of a given language has in some respects a level of skill which a second (or subsequent) language learner cannot easily accomplish. Consequently, descriptive empirical studies of languages are usually carried out using only native speakers. This view is, however, slightly problematic, particularly as many non-native speakers demonstrably not only successfully engage with and in their non-native language societies, but in fact may become culturally and even linguistically important contributors (as, for example, writers, politicians, media personalities and performing artists) in their non-native language. In recent years, linguistic research has focused attention on the use of widely known world languages, such as English, as a [[lingua franca]] or a shared common language of professional and commercial communities. In lingua franca situations, most speakers of the common language are functionally multilingual.

People who know more than one language have been reported to be more adept at language learning compared to monolinguals.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Bilinguals who are highly proficient in two or more languages have been reported to have enhanced executive function or even have reduced-risk for dementia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bialystok E, Martin MM |title=Attention and inhibition in bilingual children: evidence from the dimensional change card sort task |journal=Dev Sci |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=325–39 |year=2004 |pmid=15595373 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-7687.2004.00351.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bialystok E, Craik FI, Grady C, Chau W, Ishii R, Gunji A, Pantev C |title=Effect of bilingualism on cognitive control in the Simon task: evidence from MEG |journal=NeuroImage |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=40–49 |year=2005 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2004.09.044 |pmid=15588595}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://science.time.com/2013/07/18/how-the-brain-benefits-from-being-bilingual/ |title=How the Brain Benefits from Being Bilingual |last=Kluger |first=Jeffrey |date=18 July 2013 |website=TIME |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6IHQkrPci?url=http://science.time.com/2013/07/18/how-the-brain-benefits-from-being-bilingual/ |archivedate=21 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Atkinson2016"&gt;{{Cite journal |authors = Atkinson AL |title = Does Bilingualism Delay the Development of Dementia? |url = http://jeps.efpsa.org/articles/10.5334/jeps.375/ |journal = Journal of European Psychology Students |year = 2016 |pages = 43–50 |volume = 7 |issue = 1 |doi = 10.5334/jeps.375 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160903092222/http://jeps.efpsa.org/articles/10.5334/jeps.375/ |archivedate = 3 September 2016 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, however, this claim has come under strong criticism&lt;ref name="Atlantic2016"&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Bitter Fight Over the Benefits of Bilingualism|url = https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/02/the-battle-over-bilingualism/462114/|website = The Atlantic|access-date = 2016-02-11|language = en-US|first = Ed|last = Yong|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160211015050/http://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/02/the-battle-over-bilingualism/462114/|archivedate = 11 February 2016|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lehtonen2018"&gt; {{Cite journal|title = Is Bilingualism Associated With Enhanced Executive Functioning in Adults?

When acquisition of the first language is interrupted and insufficient or unstructured language input follows from the second language, as sometimes happens with [[Immigration|immigrant]] children, the speaker can end up with two languages both mastered below the monolingual standard.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} A notable example can be found in the [[Bengali people|ethnic Bengali]] Muslim community of Assam province in India, hailing from [[Bangladesh|East Bengal]]. Their mother tongue is [[Bengali language|Bengali]], but they have no opportunity to study it in the school. Their medium language of study is [[Assamese language|Assamese]], the provincial language. As a result, their predominant form of communication mixes the mother tongue and the medium language. Because they have no chance to study both the languages separately, they can't differentiate between the two or maintain such a difference in expression. Literacy plays an important role in the development of language in these immigrant children.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Those who were literate in their first language before arriving, and who have support to maintain that literacy, are at the very least able to maintain and master their first language.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}
There are differences between those who learn a language in a class environment and those who learn through total [[language immersion|immersion]], usually living in a country where the target language is widely spoken. Without the possibility to actively translate, due to a complete lack of any first language communication opportunity, the comparison between languages is reduced. The new language is almost independently learned, like the mother tongue for a child, with direct concept-to-language translation that can become more natural than word structures learned as a subject. Added to this, the uninterrupted, immediate and exclusive practice of the new language reinforces and deepens the attained knowledge.

===Economic benefits===
Bilinguals might have important labor market advantages over monolingual individuals as bilingual people are able to carry out duties that monolinguals cannot, such as
interacting with customers who only speak a minority language. A study in Switzerland has found that multilingualism is positively correlated with an individual's salary, the productivity of firms, and the gross domestic production (GDP); the authors state that Switzerland's GDP is augmented by 10% by multilingualism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grin|first1=François|last2=Sfreddo|first2=Claudio|last3=Vaillancourt|first3=François|title=Economics of the multilingual workplace.|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=[S.l.]|isbn=978-0-415-85106-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study in the United States by Agirdag found that bilingualism has substantial economic benefits as bilingual persons were found to have around $3,000 per year more salary than monolinguals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Agirdag, O. |title=The long-term effects of bilingualism on children of immigration: student bilingualism and future earnings |journal=International Journal of Bilingual Education and Bilingualism |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=449–464 |year=2014  |doi=10.1080/13670050.2013.816264 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Receptive bilingualism===
{{Main article|Passive speakers (language)}}
Receptive bilinguals are those who have the ability to understand a second language but who cannot speak it or whose abilities to speak it are inhibited by psychological barriers. Receptive bilingualism is frequently encountered among adult immigrants to the U.S. who do not speak English as a native language but who have children who do speak English natively, usually in part because those children's education has been conducted in English; while the immigrant parents can understand both their native language and English, they speak only their native language to their children.  If their children are likewise receptively bilingual but productively English-monolingual, throughout the conversation the parents will speak their native language and the children will speak English. If their children are productively bilingual, however, those children may answer in the parents' native language, in English, or in a combination of both languages, varying their choice of language depending on factors such as the communication's content, context, and/or emotional intensity and the presence or absence of third-party speakers of one language or the other. The third alternative represents the phenomenon of "[[code-switching]]" in which the productively bilingual party to a communication switches languages in the course of that communication.  Receptively bilingual persons, especially children, may rapidly achieve oral fluency by spending extended time in situations where they are required to speak the language that they theretofore understood only passively.  Until both generations achieve oral fluency, not all definitions of bilingualism accurately characterize the family as a whole, but the linguistic differences between the family's generations often constitute little or no impairment to the family's functionality.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}
Receptive bilingualism in one language as exhibited by a speaker of another language, or even as exhibited by most speakers of that language, is not the same as [[mutual intelligibility]] of languages; the latter is a property of a pair of ''languages'', namely a consequence of objectively high lexical and grammatical similarities between the languages themselves (''e.g.'', Iberian Spanish and Iberian Portuguese), whereas the former is a property of one or more ''persons'' and is determined by subjective or intersubjective factors such as the respective languages' prevalence in the life history (including family upbringing, educational setting, and ambient culture) of the person or persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=spa |title=Ethnologue report for language code: spa |publisher=Ethnologue.com |accessdate=2010-07-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100418134038/http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=spa |archivedate=18 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Personality ===
Because it is difficult or impossible to master many of the high-level semantic aspects of a language (including but not limited to its [[idiom]]s and [[eponym]]s) without first understanding the culture and history of the region in which that language evolved, as a practical matter an in-depth familiarity with multiple cultures is a prerequisite for high-level multilingualism.  This knowledge of cultures individually and comparatively, or indeed the mere fact of one's having that knowledge, often forms an important part of both what one considers one's own personal identity to be and what others consider that identity to be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Halwachs|first=D.W.|title=Polysystem repertoire and identity|journal=Grazer Linguistische Studien|year=1993|volume=39–40|pages=71–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Some studies have found that groups of multilingual individuals get higher average scores on tests for certain personality traits such as cultural [[empathy]], [[open-mindedness]] and social initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dewaele|first=J.|title=Multilingualism, empathy, and multicompetence|journal=International Journal of Multilingualism|year=2012|pages=1–15|url=http://www.bbk.ac.uk/linguistics/our-staff/li-wei/copy_of_DewaeleLiWei2012.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131009194907/http://www.bbk.ac.uk/linguistics/our-staff/li-wei/copy_of_DewaeleLiWei2012.pdf|archivedate=9 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dewaele|first=J.|title=The effect of multilingualism, sociobiographical, and situational factors on communicative anxiety and foreign language anxiety of mature language learners|journal=International Journal of Bilingualism|year=2007|volume=11|pages=391–409|doi=10.1177/13670069070110040301|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The idea of [[linguistic relativity]], which claims that the language people speak influences the way they see the world, can be interpreted to mean that individuals who speak multiple languages have a broader, more diverse view of the world, even when speaking only one language at a time.&lt;ref name="Grosjean 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grosjean|first=F|title=Life as a bilingual: the reality of living with two or more languages|journal=Psychology Today|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some bilinguals feel that their personality changes depending on which language they are speaking;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tokuhama-Espinosa|first=T.|title=The multilingual mind: Issues discussed by, for, and about people living with many languages|year=2003|publisher=Praeger Publishers|location=Westport, Connecticut}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wang|first=X.|title=Growing up with three languages: Birth to eleven|year=2008|publisher=Multilingualism Matters|location=Briston, United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus multilingualism is said to create multiple personalities. Xiao-lei Wang states in her book ''Growing up with Three Languages: Birth to Eleven'': "Languages used by speakers with one or more than one language are used not just to represent a unitary self, but to enact different kinds of selves, and different linguistic contexts create different kinds of self-expression and experiences for the same person." However, there has been little rigorous research done on this topic and it is difficult to define "personality" in this context. [[François Grosjean]] wrote: "What is seen as a change in personality is most probably simply a shift in attitudes and behaviors that correspond to a shift in situation or context, independent of language."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Living with two languages and two cultures, chapter in: Cultural and Language Diversity and the Deaf Experience. | publisher=Cambridge University Press | author=François Grosjean (author of chapter); Editor: I. Parasnis | year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the [[Sapir-Whorf]] hypothesis, which states that a language shapes our vision of the world, may suggest that a language learned by a grown-up may have much fewer emotional [[connotation]]s and therefore allow a more serene discussion than a language learned by a child and to that respect more or less bound to a child's perception of the world. A 2013 study published in PLoS ONE found that rather than an emotion-based explanation, switching into the second language seems to exempt bilinguals from the social norms and constraints such as political correctness.&lt;ref name="ParadowskiGawinkowskaBilewicz2013"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gawinkowska M, Paradowski MB, Bilewicz M |title=Second language as an exemptor from sociocultural norms.

==Learning language==
{{main article|Language education}}
One view is that of the [[linguistics|linguist]] [[Noam Chomsky]] in what he calls the human [[language acquisition device]]—a mechanism which enables an individual to recreate correctly the rules and certain other characteristics of language used by speakers around the learner.&lt;ref name="Santrock"&gt;Santrock, John W. (2008).  Bilingualism and Second-Language Learning.  ''A Topical Approach to Life-Span Development (4th ed.)'' (pp. 330–335).  New York, NY: McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;  This device, according to Chomsky, wears out over time, and is not normally available by [[puberty]], which he uses to explain the poor results some adolescents and adults have when learning aspects of a [[second language]] (L2).

If language learning is a [[Cognition|cognitive process]], rather than a language acquisition device, as the school led by [[Stephen Krashen]] suggests, there would only be relative, not categorical, differences between the two types of language learning.

[[Rod Ellis]] quotes research finding that the earlier children learn a second language, the better off they are, in terms of [[pronunciation]]. See [[Critical period hypothesis]]. European schools generally offer secondary language classes for their students early on, due to the interconnectedness with neighbour countries with different languages. Most European students now study at least two foreign languages, a process strongly encouraged by the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euractiv.com/culture/eu-students-learn-foreign-languages-study/article-185818|title=EurActiv: Most EU students learn two foreign languages: Study, 28 September 2009, retrieved November 2011|author=|date=|website=euractiv.com|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171015202853/http://www.euractiv.com/culture/eu-students-learn-foreign-languages-study/article-185818|archivedate=15 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[second language]] class, students will commonly face the difficulties on thinking in the target language because they are influenced by their native language and culture patterns. Robert B. Kaplan thinks that in second language classes, the foreign-student paper is out of focus because the foreign student is employing rhetoric and a sequence of thought which violate the expectations of the native reader.&lt;ref name="Kaplan"&gt;Kaplan, Robert B. "Cultural thought patterns in inter-cultural education language learning". 16.1-2(2006). 1-20. Wiley Online Library. Web. 9 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign students who have mastered syntactic structures have still demonstrated inability to compose adequate themes, term papers, theses, and dissertations. Robert B. Kaplan describes two key words that affect people when they learn a second language. [[Logic]] in the popular, rather than the logician's sense of the word, which is the basis of rhetoric, is evolved out of a culture; it is not universal. [[Rhetoric]], then, is not universal either, but varies, from culture to culture and even from time to time within a given culture.&lt;ref name="Kaplan" /&gt; Language teachers know how to predict the differences between pronunciations or constructions in different languages, but they might be less clear about the differences between rhetoric, that is, in the way they use language to accomplish various purposes, particularly in writing.&lt;ref name="Gadda"&gt;Gadda, George.

==Psychology==
A study in 2012 has shown that using a foreign language reduces decision-making biases. It was surmised that the [[Framing effect (psychology)|framing effect]] disappeared when choices are presented in a foreign tongue. As human reasoning is shaped by two distinct modes of thought: one that is systematic, analytical and cognition-intensive, and another that is fast, unconscious and emotionally charged, it was believed that a second language provides a useful cognitive distance from automatic processes, promoting analytical thought and reducing unthinking, emotional reaction. Therefore, those who speak two languages have better critical thinking and decision making skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In 2014, another study has shown that people using a foreign language are more likely to make utilitarian decisions when faced with a moral dilemma, as in the [[trolley problem]]. The utilitarian option was chosen more often in ''the fat man'' case when presented in a foreign language. However, there was no difference in the switch track case. It was surmised that a foreign language lacks the emotional impact of one's native language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Widespread multilingualism is one form of [[language contact]]. Multilingualism was common in the past: in early times, when most people were members of small language communities, it was necessary to know two or more languages for trade or any other dealings outside one's own town or village, and this holds good today in places of high linguistic diversity such as [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] and [[India]]. Linguist Ekkehard Wolff estimates that 50% of the population of Africa is multilingual.&lt;ref&gt;Wolff, Ekkehard (2000).  Language and Society. In: Bernd Heine and Derek Nurse (Eds.) ''African Languages - An Introduction'', 317. Cambridge University Press.
&lt;/ref&gt;

In multilingual societies, not all speakers need to be multilingual. Some states can have multilingual policies and recognize several official languages, such as Canada (English and French). In some states, particular languages may be associated with particular regions in the state (e.g., Canada) or with particular ethnicities (e.g., Malaysia and Singapore). When all speakers are multilingual, linguists classify the community according to the functional distribution of the languages involved:
* '''[[Diglossia]]''': if there is a structural functional distribution of the languages involved, the society is termed 'diglossic'. Typical diglossic areas are those areas in [[Europe]] where a [[regional language]] is used in informal, usually oral, contexts, while the state language is used in more formal situations. [[Frisia]] (with [[Frisian languages|Frisian]] and [[German language|German]] or [[Dutch language|Dutch]]) and [[Lusatia]] (with [[Sorbian languages|Sorbian]] and German) are well-known examples. Some writers limit diglossia to situations where the languages are closely related, and could be considered dialects of each other.  This can also be observed in Scotland where, in formal situations, [[English language|English]] is used. However, in informal situations in many areas, [[Scots language|Scots]] is the preferred language of choice. A similar phenomenon is also observed in Arabic-speaking regions. The effects of diglossia could be seen in the difference between written Arabic ([[Modern Standard Arabic]]) and colloquial Arabic. However, as time goes, the Arabic language somewhere between the two have been created what some have deemed "Middle Arabic" or "Common Arabic". Because of this diversification of the language, the concept of spectroglossia&lt;ref&gt;M.HBakalla(1984), Arabic Culture through its Language and Literature, Kegan Paul International, London&lt;/ref&gt; has been suggested.
* '''Ambilingualism''': a region is called ambilingual if this functional distribution is not observed. In a typical ambilingual area it is nearly impossible to predict which language will be used in a given setting. True ambilingualism is rare. Ambilingual tendencies can be found in small states with multiple heritages like [[Luxembourg]], which has a combined Franco-Germanic heritage, or [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]], which fuses the cultures of [[Ethnic Malays|Malays]], [[China]], and [[India]] or communities with high rates of deafness like [[Martha's Vineyard]] where historically most inhabitants spoke both [[Martha's Vineyard Sign Language|MVSL]] and [[English language|English]] or in southern Israel where locals speak both [[Al-Sayyid Bedouin Sign Language|ABSL]] and either Arabic or Hebrew. Ambilingualism also can manifest in specific regions of larger states that have both a clearly dominant state language (be it ''de jure'' or ''de facto'') and a protected minority language that is limited in terms of distribution of speakers within the country. This tendency is especially pronounced when, even though the local language is widely spoken, there is a reasonable assumption that all citizens speak the predominant state tongue (e.g., English in Quebec vs. Canada; Spanish in Catalonia vs. Spain). This phenomenon can also occur in border regions with many cross-border contacts.
* '''Bipart-lingualism''': if more than one language can be heard in a small area, but the large majority of speakers are monolinguals, who have little contact with speakers from neighbouring ethnic groups, an area is called 'bipart-lingual'. An example of this is the [[Balkans]].

N.B. the terms given above all refer to situations describing only two languages. In cases of an unspecified number of languages, the terms '''polyglossia''', '''omnilingualism''', and '''multipart-lingualism''' are more appropriate.

==Multilingualism between different language speakers==
Whenever two people meet, negotiations take place. If they want to express solidarity and sympathy, they tend to seek common features in their behavior. If speakers wish to express distance towards or even dislike of the person they are speaking to, the reverse is true, and differences are sought. This mechanism also extends to language, as described in the [[Communication Accommodation Theory]].

Some multilinguals use [[code-switching]], a term that describes the process of 'swapping' between languages. In many cases, code-switching is motivated by the wish to express loyalty to more than one cultural group,{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} as holds for many immigrant communities in the New World. Code-switching may also function as a strategy where proficiency is lacking. Such strategies are common if the vocabulary of one of the languages is not very elaborated for certain fields, or if the speakers have not developed proficiency in certain lexical domains, as in the case of immigrant languages.

This code-switching appears in many forms. If a speaker has a positive attitude towards both languages and towards code-switching, many switches can be found, even within the same sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Poplack Shana | authorlink = Shana Poplack | year = 1980 | title = Sometimes I'll start a sentence in Spanish y termino en español": toward a typology of code-switching | url = | journal = Linguistics | volume = 18 | issue = 7/8| pages = 581–618 | doi = 10.1515/ling.1980.18.7-8.581 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If, however, the speaker is reluctant to use code-switching, as in the case of a lack of proficiency, he might knowingly or unknowingly try to camouflage his attempt by converting elements of one language into elements of the other language through [[calque|calquing]]. This results in speakers using words like ''courrier noir'' (literally mail that is black) in French, instead of the proper word for [[blackmail]], ''chantage''.

Sometimes a [[pidgin language]] may develop. A pidgin language is a fusion of two languages that is mutually understandable for both speakers. Some pidgin languages develop into real languages (such as [[Papiamento]] in [[Curaçao]] or [[Singlish]] in [[Singapore]]) while others remain as slangs or jargons (such as [[Helsinki slang]], which is more or less [[mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]] both in Finnish and Swedish).{{Clarify|date=July 2014}} In other cases, prolonged influence of languages on each other may have the effect of changing one or both to the point where it may be considered that a new language is born. For example, many linguists believe that the [[Occitan language]] and the [[Catalan language]] were formed because a population speaking a single Occitano-Romance language was divided into political spheres of influence of France and Spain, respectively. [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] is a complex blend of [[Middle High German]] with [[Hebrew]] and borrowings from Slavic languages.

Bilingual interaction can even take place without the speakers switching. In certain areas, it is not uncommon for speakers each to use a different language within the same conversation. This phenomenon is found, amongst other places, in [[Scandinavia]]. Most speakers of [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Danish language|Danish]] can communicate with each other speaking their respective languages, while few can speak both (people used to these situations often adjust their language, avoiding words that are not found in the other language or that can be misunderstood). Using different languages is usually called [[non-convergent discourse]], a term introduced by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] linguist Reitze Jonkman. {{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} To a certain extent, this situation also exists between [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]], although everyday contact is fairly rare because of the distance between the two respective communities. Another example is the former state of [[Czechoslovakia]], where two closely related and mutually intelligible languages ([[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]]) were in common use. Most Czechs and Slovaks understand both languages, although they would use only one of them (their respective mother tongue) when speaking. For example, in Czechoslovakia it was common to hear two people talking on television each speaking a different language without any difficulty understanding each other. This bilinguality still exists nowadays, although it has started to deteriorate after Czechoslovakia split up.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

==Multilingualism at the linguistic level==

===Models for native language literacy programs===
Sociopolitical as well as socio-cultural identity arguments may influence native language literacy.  While these two camps may occupy much of the debate about which languages children will learn to read, a greater emphasis on the linguistic aspects of the argument is appropriate. In spite of the political turmoil precipitated by this debate, researchers continue to espouse a linguistic basis for it.  This rationale is based upon the work of Jim Cummins (1983).&lt;!--- this paragraph is not intelligible ---&gt;

===Sequential model===
{{Main article|Sequential bilingualism}}
In this model, learners receive literacy instruction in their native language until they acquire a "threshold" literacy proficiency. Some researchers use age 3 as the age when a child has basic communicative competence in their first language (Kessler, 1984).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hanen.org/web/Home/AboutHanen/NewsViews/OneLanguageorTwo/tabid/220/Default.aspx|title=Page Not Found|author=|date=|website=www.hanen.org|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530230334/http://www.hanen.org/web/Home/AboutHanen/NewsViews/OneLanguageorTwo/tabid/220/Default.aspx|archivedate=30 May 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children may go through a process of sequential acquisition if they migrate at a young age to a country where a different language is spoken, or if the child exclusively speaks his or her heritage language at home until he/she is immersed in a school setting where instruction is offered in a different language.

The phases children go through during sequential acquisition are less linear than for simultaneous acquisition and can vary greatly among children. Sequential acquisition is a more complex and lengthier process, although there is no indication that non-language-delayed children end up less proficient than simultaneous bilinguals, so long as they receive adequate input in both languages.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

===Bilingual model===
{{Main article|Simultaneous bilingualism}}
In this model, the native language and the community language are simultaneously taught. The advantage is literacy in two languages as the outcome. However, the teacher must be well-versed in both languages and also in techniques for teaching a second language.

===Coordinate model===
This model posits that equal time should be spent in separate instruction of the native language and of the community language. The native language class, however, focuses on basic literacy while the community language class focuses on listening and speaking skills. Being a bilingual does not necessarily mean that one can speak, for example, English and French.

===Outcomes===
{{Citation style|section|date=June 2018}}
Cummins' research concluded that the development of competence in the native language serves as a foundation of proficiency that can be transposed to the second language — the common underlying proficiency hypothesis.  His work sought to overcome the perception propagated in the 1960s that learning two languages made for two competing aims. The belief was that the two languages were mutually exclusive and that learning a second required unlearning elements and dynamics of the first in order to accommodate the second (Hakuta, 1990). The evidence for this perspective relied on the fact that some errors in acquiring the second language were related to the rules of the first language (Hakuta, 1990). How this hypothesis holds under different types of languages such as Romance versus non-Western languages has yet to undergo research.

Another new development that has influenced the linguistic argument for bilingual literacy is the length of time necessary to acquire the second language.  While previously children were believed to have the ability to learn a language within a year, today researchers believe that within and across academic settings, the time span is nearer to five years (Collier, 1992; Ramirez, 1992).

An interesting outcome of studies during the early 1990s however confirmed that students who do successfully complete bilingual instruction perform better academically (Collier, 1992; Ramirez, 1992).  These students exhibit more cognitive elasticity including a better ability to analyse abstract visual patterns.  Students who receive bidirectional bilingual instruction where equal proficiency in both languages is required perform at an even higher level.  Examples of such programs include international and multi-national education schools.

==Multilingualism in computing==
[[File:Hebkeyboard.JPG|thumb|Dual language [[Hebrew]] and English keyboard]]

With emerging markets and expanding international cooperation, business users expect to be able to use software and applications in their own language.&lt;ref&gt;Dedić, N. and Stanier C., 2016., "An Evaluation of the Challenges of Multilingualism in Data Warehouse Development" in 18th International Conference on Enterprise Information Systems - ICEIS 2016, p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; Multilingualisation (or "m17n", where "17" stands for 17 omitted letters) of computer systems can be considered part of a continuum between [[internationalization and localization]]:
* A localized system has been adapted or converted for a particular locale (other than the one it was originally developed for), including the language of the user interface, input, and display, and features such as time/date display and currency; but each instance of the system only supports a single locale.
* Multilingualised software supports multiple languages for display and input simultaneously, but generally has a single user interface language.  Support for other locale features like time, date, number and currency formats may vary as the system tends towards full internationalisation.  Generally a multilingualised system is intended for use in a specific locale, whilst allowing for multilingual content.
* An internationalised system is equipped for use in a range of locales, allowing for the co-existence of several languages and character sets in user interfaces and displays.  In particular, a system may not be considered internationalised in the fullest sense unless the interface language is selectable by the user at runtime.

Translating the user interface is usually part of the [[software localization]] process, which also includes adaptations such as units and date conversion. Many software applications are available in several languages, ranging from a handful (the [[List of languages by number of native speakers|most spoken languages]]) to dozens for the most popular applications (such as [[office suite]]s, [[web browser]]s, etc.).  Due to the status of [[English in computing]], software development nearly always uses it (but see also [[Non-English-based programming languages]]), so almost all commercial software is initially available in an English version, and multilingual versions, if any, may be produced as alternative options based on the English original.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wolfram.com/language/11/multilingual-functionality/?product=mathematica|title=Multilingual Functionality: New in Wolfram Language 11|website=www.wolfram.com|access-date=2016-08-23|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820020128/http://www.wolfram.com/language/11/multilingual-functionality/?product=mathematica|archivedate=20 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multilingualism in the workplace==

Globalization has led the world to be more deeply interconnected. Consequences of this are that more and more companies are trading with foreign countries, and with countries that don't necessarily speak the same language. English has become an important working knowledge mainly in multinational companies, but also in smaller companies. NGO workers are also faced with multilingualism when intervening on the field and use both linguistic and non-verbal strategies to communicate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bencherki|first1=Nicolas|last2=Matte|first2=Frédérik|last3=Pelletier|first3=Émilie|title=

=== Multilingualism in English speaking countries ===
According to Hewitt (2008) entrepreneurs in London from Poland, China or Turkey use English mainly for communication with customers, suppliers and banks, but their own native languages for work tasks and social purposes.
Even in English speaking countries immigrants are still able to use their own mother tongue in the workplace thanks to other immigrants from the same place. Kovacs (2004)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kovacs|first1=M.|title=Australian Finns on the verge of language shift|date=2004|pages=108, 200–223}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes this phenomenon in Australia with Finnish immigrants in the construction industry who spoke Finnish during working hours.
But even though foreign languages may be used in the workplace, English is still a must-know working skill. Mainstream society justifies the divided job market, arguing that getting a low-paying job is the best newcomers can achieve considering their limited language skills.

=== Multilingualism in Asia===
With companies going international they are now focusing more and more on the English level of their employees. Especially in South Korea since the 1990s, companies are using different English language testing to evaluate job applicants, and the criteria in those tests are constantly upgrading the level for good English. In India it is even possible to receive training to acquire an English accent, as the number of outsourced call centres in India has soared in the past decades.
Meanwhile, Japan ranks 26th out of 63 countries in a 2014 English Proficiency Index, amid calls for this to improve in time for the [[2020 Tokyo Olympics]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Within multiracial countries such as [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]], it is not unusual for one to speak two or more languages, albeit with varying degrees of fluency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=9 of the world's most multilingual countries|url=http://www.mnn.com/lifestyle/arts-culture/stories/9-of-the-worlds-most-multilingual-countries|publisher=Mother Nature Network|date=28 June 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005210034/http://www.mnn.com/lifestyle/arts-culture/stories/9-of-the-worlds-most-multilingual-countries|archivedate=5 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=

=== Multilingualism in Africa===
Not only in multinational companies is English an important skill, but also in the engineering industry, in the chemical, electrical and aeronautical fields. A study directed by Hill and van Zyl (2002) shows that in South Africa young black engineers used English most often for communication and documentation. However, Afrikaans and other local languages were also used to explain particular concepts to workers in order to ensure understanding and cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gunnarson|first1=Britt-Louise|title=Multilingualism in the Workplace|journal=Annual Review of Applied Linguistics|date=2013|volume=33|pages=162–&amp;volumeId=33&amp;issueId=-1&amp;aid=9090498}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Multilingualism in Europe ===
In Europe, as the domestic market is generally quite restricted, international trade is a norm. But there is no predominant language in Europe (with [[List of territorial entities where German is an official language|German]] spoken in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Luxembourg, and Belgium; [[List of territorial entities where French is an official language|French]] in France, Belgium, Luxembourg, and Switzerland; and [[List of territorial entities where English is an official language|English]] in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Malta). Most of the time, English is used as a communication language, but in multilingual countries such as Belgium (Dutch, French and German), Switzerland (German, French, Italian and Romanche), Luxembourg (Luxembourgish, French and German) or Spain (Spanish, Catalan, Basque and Galician), it is common to see employees mastering two or even three of those languages. Some languages such as Danish, Swedish and Norwegian or Croatian, Slovenian, Serbian and Bosnian are so close to each other that it is generally more common for meeting to use their mother tongue rather than English.

Continued global [[diversity (business)|diversity]] has led to an increasingly multilingual workforce. Europe has become an excellent model to observe this newly diversified labor culture. The expansion of the European Union with its open labor market has provided opportunities both for well-trained professionals and unskilled workers to move to new countries to seek employment. Political changes and turmoil have also led to migration and to the creation of new and more complex multilingual workplaces. In most wealthy and secure countries, immigrants are found mostly in low paid jobs but also, increasingly, in high status positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gunnarsson|first1=Britt-Louise|title=Multilingualism in European Workplaces.|date=2014|volume=33|pages=11–33|doi=10.1515/multi-2014-0002|journal=Multilingua}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multilingualism in music==
{{further information|List of multilingual bands and artists}}
It is extremely common for music to be written in whatever the contemporary [[lingua franca]] is. If a song is not written in a common tongue, then it is usually written in whatever is the predominant language in the musician's country of origin, or in another widely recognized language, such as English, German, Spanish, or French.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

The bilingual song cycles "there..." and "Sing, Poetry" on the 2011 contemporary classical album [[Troika (album)|Troika]] consist of musical settings of Russian poems with their English self-translations by [[Joseph Brodsky]] and [[Vladimir Nabokov]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B005USB24A "Troika: Russia's westerly poetry in three orchestral song cycles"] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20171103083529/https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B005USB24A |date=3 November 2017 }}, Rideau Rouge Records, ASIN: B005USB24A, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Museumsquartier''' ('''MQ''') is a 60,000 m² large area in the [[Neubau|7th district]] of the city of [[Vienna]], [[Austria]];

== Highlights ==
The Museumsquartier contains [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] buildings as well as [[Modern architecture]] by the [[architect]]s Laurids and Manfred Ortner (Ortner &amp; Ortner Baukunst). The renovation of the former court stables began in April 1998. Three years later, the Museumsquartier opened in two stages (June and September 2001). The total cost of the construction was 150 Million Euro (two billion [[Austrian schilling|Austria Schilling]]).

The MQ is home to a range of installations from large [[art museum]]s like the [[Leopold Museum]] and the [[MUMOK]] (Museum of Modern Art Ludwig Foundation Vienna) to contemporary exhibition spaces like the [[Kunsthalle Wien]] and festivals like the [[Wiener Festwochen]], an annual summer event that is headquartered in the MuseumsQuartier Wien.

Additional highlights include the ''Tanzquartier'', an international, state-of-the-art centre for dance, the [[Architekturzentrum Wien]], production studios for new media, artist studios for artists-in-residence, outstanding art and cultural facilities designed for children, and a variety of other events and festivals such as the renowned [[Viennale]] film festival, the [[ImPulsTanz Vienna International Dance Festival]], [[Coded Cultures]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mqw.at/de/programm//programmdetail/coded-cultures-exploring-creative-emergences/|title=CODED CULTURES – Exploring Creative Emergences|last=Wien|first=MQW - MuseumsQuartier|work=Museumsquartier Wien|access-date=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Techno Sensual,&lt;ref name="name"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.technosensualexpo.com/info.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207171309/http://www.technosensualexpo.com/info.html |archivedate=2013-12-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and many others.

The Museumsquartier hosts ''quartier21'', which features around 60 alternative art groups,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.q21.at/en/institutions/|title=Institutions|website=www.q21.at|access-date=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example [[eSeL]].

Since 2002, an [[artist-in-residence]] programme brought over 735 artists to MuseumsQuartier, who have been working and living in the studio spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.q21.at/en/artists-in-residence/artists/|title=Artists|website=www.q21.at|access-date=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The residency programme is run together with ''tranzit.org / ERSTE Stiftung,'' the [[Federal Ministry for Europe, Integration and Foreign Affairs]] and the [[Research Institute for Arts and Technology]]''.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.q21.at/en/artists-in-residence/about/|title=General Information of the Artist-In-Residence Programme|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Museumsquartier (Vienna U-Bahn)|Museumsquartier station]] of line U2 of the [[Vienna U-Bahn]], as well as the metro station "Volkstheater" is located next to the premises.

== Controversy ==
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2018}}
There was negative [[Mass media|media]] reaction after it became known that the expensive public buildings had serious shortcomings regarding [[barrier-free]] [[wheelchair]] [[accessibility]]. Not even the recently constructed buildings (Kunsthalle, MUMOK and Leopold Museum) were able to fulfill the most basic requirements. After many negative reports across the media, and the commitment of [[Disability|handicapped]] interest groups, the majority of the problems were repaired in the following years.

[[Public Netbase]], an internet provider and sponsor of electronic art and culture programs, was not invited to be part of Museumsquartier in 2002. Originally located in a part of the MQ, it had to leave during the renovations, but after the construction was completed, it was not able to return to its former premises.

The '''Mwangwego alphabet''' is an [[abugida]] developed for [[Malawian language]]s by Nolence Mwangwego.&lt;ref name="hist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mwangwego.com/history.htm|title=Mwangwego Script  -History of the script|publisher=Mwangwego.com|accessdate=9 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://kumatoo.com/nolwence_mwangwego.html&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of several indigenous scripts invented for local language communities in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Unseth, Peter. Invention of scripts in West Africa for Ethnic Revitalization. In ''Handbook of Language and Ethnic Identity'' vol. 2, edited by [[Joshua Fishman]] and [[Ofelia Garcia]], 23-32. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea for a Malawian script came on November 10, 1977, in Paris, when he discovered that there are various writing systems in the world, and thought that words meaning "to write" in Malawian languages were evidence that they once had a script of their own.&lt;ref name="hist" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://speakjhr.com/2010/11/the-politics-of-malawis-alphabet/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Mwangwego script was created in 1979, with additional symbols created up to 1997 by Mwangwego.&lt;ref name="hist" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?item_id=SitesOnScriptsAndWSs|title=Sites on Scripts and Writing Systems|publisher=Scripts.sil.org|accessdate=9 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage and reception ==
The script was launched in 2003 but has only gained a small following within Malawi. Mwangwego continues to hold public lectures and exhibitions in academic institutions and teach the script. In 2003, the Minister of youth, sports and culture, Mr [[Kamangadazi Chambalo]], was quoted as saying:

"Mwangwego script is in itself history in the making. Irrespective of how it is going to be received by the public nationwide, the script is bound to go in the annals of our history as a remarkable invention."&lt;ref name="hist" /&gt;

The first person to learn the script was Mwandipa Chimaliro.&lt;ref name="hist" /&gt; Ten other students that year learned the script as well who went on to teach others.&lt;ref name="hist" /&gt;  

In 2007 the Mwangwego Club was formed whose membership is open to those that have learned the script. As of 2012, there were about 395 people using it. Only one book has ever been published using the script. This was ''A Malawi Tili Pati'' by Mwangwego written in [[Chichewa]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.omniglot.com/writing/mwangwego.htm "Mwangwego"], Omniglot, retrieved 21 June 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

The script is not recognised by the [[ISO 15924]] standard.  However, the Script Encoding Initiative&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linguistics.berkeley.edu/sei/ "Welcome to the Script Encoding Iniative"], Script Encoding Initiative, retrieved 21 June 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; is working to have it included and there is a proposal&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2012/12251-n4295-mwangwego.pdf "Preliminary proposal to encode the Mwangwego script in the UCS"], The Unicode Consortium, retrieved 21 June 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; to include it in [[Unicode]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://scriptsource.org/cms/scripts/page.php?item_id=script_detail&amp;key=Qa54 "Mwangwego"], ScriptSource, retrieved 21 June 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:New crop.jpg|thumbnail|right|Harvesting preparation]]
'''''Nabanna ''''' ({{lang-bn|নবান্ন}}, Nabānna; lit: ''' new Feast''' ) is a [[Bengali people|Bengali]] harvest celebration usually celebrated with food and dance and music in [[Bangladesh]] and in the Indian State of [[West Bengal]]. It is a festival of food; many local preparations of [[Bengali cuisine]] like [[pithe]] are cooked and offered. {{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

==Celebration==

The festival is celebrated with [[mela]] which are called nabanna mela. It is one of the numerous festivals that gave the name "baro mase tero parban" (thirteen festivals in twelve months ) to the land of [[Bengal]]. Although the nabanna parban is somewhat different from other ones since it is not connected to a religion such as [[Ratha Yatra]]. The villagers and locals from both the major religious groups join the festival with equal participation. There are also several [[fertility ritual]]s which make the festival truly a [[harvest ritual]]. The festival gets a lot of support from the [[Creativity|creative]] army of [[Culture of Bengal|Bengali culture]]. Several poets, musicians, [[baul]] and painters flock to such mass gatherings. There is a famous play written on nabanna by [[Bijon Bhattacharya]] which depicts the sad incident of the great [[Bengal famine of 1943|Bengal Famine]] of 1943.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/jc47.2005/ghatak/notes.html Ritwik Ghatak notes&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
Nowadays the Festival "Nabanna" is celebrating every Bengali year (1st day of Agrahayan) in [[Dhaka]], organised by Jatiya Nabanna Utshab Udjapan Parshad (National Harvest Festival committee) since 1998. Mr. Shahriar Salam is main planner of the organisation. There are huge number of cultural activists, organisations &amp; performing in a day long festival.  Traditional Dance, Song &amp; Rally arranging by the Committee.
Once upon a time 1st Agrahayan was the first day of Bengali New Year. It is a non-communal festival in Bengal.

Below is a description found in west Bengal on one such mela website.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"people from several villages of Howrah and even from other districts of West Bengal come here. People not only come to visit the Mela. In addition, they participate in many cultural programmes and competitions like 'Pithe Making' (Preparation of different sorts of Bengali Cakes), Seat-and Draw, Senior Citizens' Walking Competition etc. An "Art-Camp" may attract creative minded people where artists from different states will participate. Some rare items of rural Bengal as "[[Dhenki]]" (Old-style Domestic Rice Mill), paddy of different varieties directly from the farmers' house are to be exhibited in the Exhibition ground. You can taste some delicious Bengali dishes like Pati-sapta, Payesh (the latest addition is 'Vegetable Payesh'), Jilipipi (not Jilipi) etc. during the festival. Bengal's time-honoured culture and heritage will be presented to you in forms of Baul song, [[Chhou]]-dance, [[Jatra (Bengal)|Jatra]], [[Tarja (folk poetry contest)|Tarja]], Kobi-gaan, etc. These artists come from different parts of the state to perform their talent and expertise in front of thousands of appreciative gatherings. Moreover, you can refurbish your collection of folk arts from the 'exhibition-cum-sale' stalls of handicrafts made by rural artisans."&lt;ref&gt;[http://tapankar.com/nabanna.htm Nabanna Mela&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Social and cultural effects==
&lt;!-- Commented out: [[Image:Shobha sen in nabanna.jpg|thumb|120px|A shot from historical performance of 'Nabanna"]] --&gt;
Several dance and music forms have grown out of the ritual accompanied with the festival. Examples are [[Chhau dance|Chhau]], [[Bihu]] etc. Also the name nabanna is associated to several rural welfare projects and banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apit.gov.in/DOST/egovernance/ictpr/ictpr.nic.in/baduria/partners.html |title=Home – Information Technology &amp; Communications Department – Government of AP |publisher=Apit.gov.in |date= |accessdate=22 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apdip.net/projects/ictrnd/2004/S04-in/proposal ICT R&amp;D Grants Programme for Asia Pacific — Asia-Pacific Development Information Programme&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been associated with the [[Indian People's Theatre Association|IPTA]] movement of [[Bengali theatre]].

The path-breaking production "[[Nabanna (play)|Nabanna]]" of the Indian People's Theatre Association [[Indian People's Theatre Association|IPTA]] in the 1940s, has been a motivating force in the left-tilted political approach of the next few decades on the stage&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1812/18120800.htm The theatre and class contradictions&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021104436/http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1812/18120800.htm |date=21 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where luminaries like [[Utpal Dutt]] will glow with brilliance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34349">The '''Nazareth-Conferences''' were the beginning of a project of [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalysts]] from England, Israel and Germany, whose founding fathers and mothers&lt;ref name="r-01" /&gt; intended to contribute to a process of solving [[Conflict theories|conflicts]] that developed between national groups. The causes of these conflicts were supposed in collective prejudices and [[resentment]]s. The aim of the conferences was – and still is for the follow-up projects&lt;ref name="r-02" /&gt; –, to become aware of these [[prejudice]]s and resentments and – at best – to give them up. [[Desmond Tutu]] compared the conferences in his foreword&lt;ref name="r-03" /&gt; for the English and German edition of the book about the Nazareth-Conferences&lt;ref name="r-04" /&gt; with the [[Truth and reconciliation commission]] set up after the end of [[Apartheid]] in South Africa.&lt;ref name="r-05" /&gt;

== History ==
There are long paths that individual psychoanalysts and their representative organizations – joined in the [[International Psychoanalytical Association|International Psychoanalytical Association (IPA)]] – had to go until the first of the three conferences under the name ''Nazareth-Conferences'' could be held in 1994. The roots go back to the year 1934 when [[Max Eitingon]] after his flight from Germany founded the Palestinian, today ''Israel Psychoanalytic Society''.&lt;ref name="r-06" /&gt; From their ranks came some of the founders of these conferences.&lt;ref name="r-07" /&gt;

A second line of the story of the project began 1957 in England. There the [[Tavistock Institute]]&lt;ref name="r-08" /&gt; started to develop the later so-called Leicesterconferences,&lt;ref name="r-09" /&gt; an “empirical experiment on group relations” – partly with psychoanalytic concepts, partly with those of the “theory of open systems”.&lt;ref name="r-10" /&gt;

1977 the congress of the IPA&lt;ref name="r-11" /&gt; for the first time after the war and the period of [[Nazism]] was held in Jerusalem. The occurrences at the congress activated in Germany and Israel processes of reflection and discussion that in 1985 should have visible consequences in both countries. In Jerusalem 1977 the German group suffered a grievous experienced rejection of their desire, to hold a next congress in Berlin – also for the first time after the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] –, but made use of this offense for an intensive process of [[Introspection|self-reflection]]. At its beginning there was the insight in the “illusion of an innocent tradition and [[Psychoanalysis#History|history]]”.&lt;ref name="r-12" /&gt; The result was presented at the 34th congress of the IPA 1985 in Hamburg in an accompanying exhibition that traced the self-reflective process.&lt;ref name="r-13" /&gt;

In the same year in Israel ''OFEK''&lt;ref name="r-14" /&gt; was  founded as a result of striving for self-knowledge after the Jerusalem congress: an organization dedicated to the study of group processes using the [[Socio-analysis#Group relations theory and Tavistock conferences|Leicesterconferences]].&lt;ref name="r-09" /&gt; With support and under the direction of Eric Miller from the ''Tavistock Institute'' in London own group relation conferences were established with the ''OFEK'' in Israel.

Soon after the IPA-Congress 1985 in Hamburg and stimulated by it, Rafael Moses&lt;ref name="r-15" /&gt; and his wife Rina Moses Hrushevski in Israel suggested a research group that should initiate reflexive processes of both groups in the presence of each other. The decision to enter into this venture and to start the project fell in the apartment of the couple Moses as [[Shmuel Erlich]], who was there at the time, mentioned.&lt;ref name="r-01" /&gt; But a further 9 years – and the failure of a first attempt – went by before the first conference in 1994 finally was held in [[Nazareth]].

As some participants painfully were missing the German Jews on the first and second conference, Shmuel Erlich as a native Frankfurter turned to them in an open letter 1999, shortly before the third conference,  encouraging them to participate.&lt;ref name="r-16" /&gt;

The long way of the German psychoanalysts in these conferences were according to Hermann Beland&lt;ref name="r-17" /&gt; on one hand caused by the “still collectively effective” defence of the Germans against a visualization of the Holocaust and on the other hand the lack of “convincing insight into the insanity, into why the Germans wanted this” (the Holocaust, author's note).&lt;ref name="r-18" /&gt; In detail he described the delusions and confusions – his own and of part of the German group –, which finally led to an involvement in this project. Since 1922 it took a long time until 2007 that a congress of the IPA in Berlin was possible again.&lt;ref name="r-19" /&gt;&lt;ref name="r-20" /&gt;

Director of ''staff'' called supervisors group&lt;ref name="r-21" /&gt; for the first three conferences 1994 and 1996 in Nazareth and 2000 in Bad Segeberg/Germany was [[Eric Miller (social scientist)|Eric Miller]]. His unexpected death in 2002&lt;ref name="r-22" /&gt; led to a turning point, as well as in the same year the death of Rafael Moses, who was staff-member from the beginning. At [[Cyprus]] they went on in 2004 with the fourth and in 2006 with the fifth conference: under a new name, a new design and with Anton Obholzer&lt;ref name="r-23" /&gt; as a new director. 2007 ''PCCA''&lt;ref name="r-02" /&gt; was founded – ''Partners in Confronting Collective Atrocities'' –, a non-profit organization with which the founders of ''Nazareth-Conferences'' have given themselves an outward visible structure.&lt;ref name="r-24" /&gt; Since 2008 ''PCCA'' took over the leadership for the conferences.&lt;ref name="r-25" /&gt; In the same year for the first time [[Palestinians]] participated and in the subsequent 2010 Conference they were represented in staff with Nimer Said.

== Task and Design ==
The title of the three ''Nazareth-Conferences'' – “Germans and Israelis: The Past in the Present”&lt;ref name="r-26" /&gt; –, was its program. It spoke of two national groups and suggested to recognize the past of the relationship between the two target groups in the present. Thus, the conferences were able to become a place where individual and group identities could meet and where was given the opportunity to explore the chances and risks of such an encounter. The task was to find out how the current relationship to the other group was influenced by belonging to the own and how the presence of this ratio was influenced by the past. Although it was intended, thereby also to detect the underlying, [[Unconscious mind|unconscious fantasies]], the target was not therapeutic, but learning at the moment of encounter. To address this difficult task undisturbed by the everyday life of the participants, the design of conferences&lt;ref name="r-27" /&gt; presented a secure framework. Members and staff lived together in a house and worked for six days in the topic. Conference language was English. The use of one's own national language was permissible, but only if all those present dominated this language. Through all this, it gradually should be possible to perceive one's own role, which was taken at the conference in the presence of others, and explore how this role was affected by past and current psychological and social processes.

== Participants ==

As the conferences were assessed from the outset as a bold and risky venture and planned by psychoanalysts,&lt;ref name="r-28" /&gt; the invitation first was directed to a kind of closed society: over various psychoanalytic associations and societies to their members.&lt;ref name="r-29" /&gt; This changed later. Participants were members of the “groups in conflict” and members of staff. The staff's purpose was the management of the conference, he took over the responsibility for the frame, thus securing the boundaries of space, time and task; he presented consultants systematic or if necessary and was called for, and offered working hypotheses about what just happened. In the same time the staff was not an external observer, but as participating individuals and as a group involved in the entire process.

The participants came, as it turned out, not only from Germany and Israel, so that the division of the world in the title appeared as a “fantasy on the part of the planners”.&lt;ref name="r-30" /&gt; The largest age group was built by the so-called second-generation members. But some members of the preliminary and some of the subsequent generation were represented.

Although Germans and Israelis were invited for participation, they often felt poorly perceived in their identity by these attributes.&lt;ref name="r-31" /&gt; The question of identity was central,&lt;ref name="r-32" /&gt; particularly for Israelis, because this question was the one that in the past had decided who was allowed to live. Everyone involved knew what finally found words: “Our parents would sit here together”.&lt;ref name="r-33" /&gt;&lt;ref name="r-34" /&gt;

== Structure and Technique ==
The individual participants with their history stood only apparently in the focus of attention. They tentatively could be seen as representatives of their group and gave thereby an opportunity to understand the individual as a significant part of the group conflicts. In an attempt to find solutions for these group conflicts, various group processes were initiated and studied. Pathbreaking work hypothesis was that the unsolvable appearing group conflicts were based on conscious and unconscious attitudes, feelings, response readiness and fantasies, which were often establishing identity and therefore difficult to give up. Just the perception of that was accompanied by violent emotions and assumed a high willingness to affect-tolerance in the participants.

According to the purpose of the conference to obtain a deeper understanding of the causes of individual and collective group conflicts and thereby create the conditions for their solution, the method provided a system of various group constellations with either experimental or reflective character. In the one experiences should have been collected in the here and now and evaluated in the other. As far as the experience of a previous conference suggested changes in design, it has been adjusted accordingly. By the third conference, the system of the various groups had initially consolidated. ''Plenary'', ''Review-'' and ''Application-Group'' should help to bring reflexive processes on the way, ''Small-Study-Group'' and in particular the ''System Event'' provided space for feeling, shaping and experience, therefore encounter with oneself and others. A total of 33 ½ hours were distributed over six days – even on the [[Sabbath]]. The ''Application-Group'' was later abandoned.&lt;ref name="r-35" /&gt;

While the challenge in the five ''Plena'' was, to gather again and understand the events and experiences from the other groups and consider single events as part of the whole, ''Review-'' and ''Application-Group'' had other tasks. Both had the same composition of five to seven participants of the same nation and a constant consultant. In the ''Review-Group'' members had to find out what role they had taken in the entire system of the conference and whether or how they changed. The ''Application-Group'' gave the opportunity to consider how the conference experience could be effectively at home in professional or in other roles. In the ''Small-Study-Group'' both nationalities sat with a consultant six times in order to experience the behavior of the group as a group and to look at. The ''System Event'' finally stood with its seven meetings not only in time in the center of the conference. It started in two large groups of separate nationality without consultants; the staff worked throughout public in a third room. That meant he could have been visited and his work could have been observed. In an ongoing process the participants in ''System Event'' had to come to an agreement about the question who wanted to work with whom, in which room, with or without consultant, on which topic and then to do so. In this way, current conflicts appeared, which often were similar to those which were brought along. The ''System Event'' made them because currently (re)enacted, available for experience and allowed to observe and understand them in their origin and meaning. If the process threatened to derail, the staff helped with a targeted interpretation. The goal of all this, so the declared intention of the initiators, is an educational: learning through experience.&lt;ref name="r-36" /&gt;

== Process ==
Each of the three conferences took a unique course, depending on the participants and their histories and stories. In the first&lt;ref name="r-37" /&gt; and second&lt;ref name="r-38" /&gt; conference particularly the fathers and their influence on the development of prejudices and resentments were in the foreground, while in the third conference the mothers came in the focus.&lt;ref name="r-39" /&gt;

Strictly speaking, the conferences for many began even before its beginning with the almost always anxious question: Go there or not?&lt;ref name="r-40" /&gt; In the ongoing process “meaningful moments” by all participants were experienced from “different events”.&lt;ref name="r-41" /&gt; Stories of “perpetrators” and “victims” and the consequences of the Holocaust for future generations – already intellectually worked through by political scientists and historians – were noticeable during the conferences by individual fates and showed the big gap in the individual and personal workup. “Fantasies, Dreams, Unknowns, Unthought-knowns, Unspoken and Unspeakable”&lt;ref name="r-42" /&gt; were alive. This cleared the way for change in the individual. This might be prerequisite to stop on both sides an until today continuing dumb transfer of suffered damages to subsequent generations.&lt;ref name="r-43" /&gt;

Although the three conferences were not the same in composition and structure, a process became noticeable, not only during each individual conference, but also during the development of all three conferences. This process intensified during the third conference when the only interpretation that the staff made available to the participants in this conference was as follows:

“Participants have put themselves into a painful situation by coming to this conference, which can be experienced as cruel. This leads to greater dependency on staff for containment, along with fears and disappointment of fantasies about the insufficiency of staff resources. The fearful fantasies may have to do with unexpected, powerful changes in one's sense of identity and the giving up of precious parts of identity, such as the role of the victim (for the Israelis) or the guilt of perpetrators (for the Germans).”&lt;ref name="r-137" /&gt;

One participant had perceived this interpretation as very disturbing but at the same time as leading forward as it had raised questions that required an answer:

“For me, the staff had expressed something unbelievable: the role of victims for the Israelis and the guilt of perpetrators for the Germans should be ‘worthy’ parts of the own identity! This is difficult to accept. The hypothesis suggested the idea that parts of this identity could be given up. But if so then what then? Wouldn't that mean for the Jewish group to dis-identify from the role of victim and for the non-Jewish group to dis-identify from the guilt of perpetrator? Wouldn't that mean to separate in a more deep way from parents who, not only in the world of inner objects but often also in real life have to be the space for our own anxiety or wishes for destruction? Where to put these feelings when the space for it would be lost? What could be the consequences for oneself as well as for the meeting with the others? Isn't one that is touching a toboo in danger of becoming a taboo? Fearful questions might follow from this hypothesis, and many more became possible.”&lt;ref name="r-137" /&gt;

One participant in the Israeli group, a so-called “child survivor” had participated in all three conferences and had widely published about the subject. He was concerned about the question of whether Jews have a face for Germans. During the third conference he had apparently taken on the role of [[The Eternal Jew (1940 film)|The Eternal Jew]]: he was carrying a plastic bag with him at all times which contained, among other things, one of his publications which he offered for sale. In it he had written:
{{Quote|text=Also, we, the professionals, like the rest, are unable to look into the eyes of those who return from death. |author=Haim Dasberg |source=Echoes of the Holocaust&lt;ref name="dasberg_2000" /&gt;}}
To be able to look into each other's eyes was one of the objectives of these conferences.

== Result ==
The results of the conferences were different from each other and thereby individual nature. One participant put it to words: “To look at this helps in recognizing the difference between ‘the other’ and my fantasies about him/her. This releases me from the imprisonment of fantasies and releases ‘the other’ from the world of my inner objects – I become empty and I don't need to project my inner objects on ‘the other’ any longer – it is a purifying process and I am not stuck. Then, and only then, are both (the other and myself) free to choose relationship with one another, or not.”&lt;ref name="r-44" /&gt;

In addition to these and other individual insights, there was on the other hand also a collective result: two books,&lt;ref name="r-04" /&gt; one in German, one in English, both appeared almost simultaneously and a really common work of all those who wanted to participate. While on the one hand the authors of the two books collected some important chapters for the understanding of the project, its history, design and structure of the conference, on the other hand the conference experience of the participants was presented as a collage: thematically ordered individual contributions of named co-authors. Mira Erlich-Ginor which was authorized by the participants to compile a collage from their contributions, wrote in her introduction: “There are conference-narratives as numerous as the number of participants in them.”&lt;ref name="r-45" /&gt;

The collage was, though all were contacted and asked for participation, mainly borne by participants, who faced the conferences positive. Critical positions hardly can be found. But the two books have helped to make the project accessible for a wider public and the readers of the personal and often painful experiences of the participants were able to learn firsthand.

The reception of the conferences looked quite different in Germany and Israel: “... in contrast to the importance given to this work in Germany and elsewhere, it was not accorded the same place in Israel.” Nevertheless, the assessment “of those Israelis who attended the conferences was decidedly very positive, deeply involved and grateful.”&lt;ref name="r-46" /&gt;

Through lectures, presentations and publications, the work of the conferences received international attention – initially in the psychoanalytic community. 2009 was foreseeable that they “will, and must, have a future.”&lt;ref name="r-47" /&gt; A website was set up and with the ''PCCA'' the conferences opened to all interested parties, so that the project could now turn to other national ''groups in conflict''.

'''''New Kids Turbo''''', sometimes promoted as ''New Kids: Turbo!'', is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[black comedy]] film based on the television series ''[[New Kids]]''. The film premiered on 6 December 2010 and was released in all Dutch cinemas on 9 December. It broke the Dutch record for receiving the highest audience figures on the opening evening. It is [[Comedy Central]]'s first film to be produced outside the United States and also [[Paramount Pictures]]' first film to be produced by Comedy Central in the Netherlands. A second New Kids movie followed in 2011: ''[[New Kids Nitro]]''

==Plot==
Set in the small village of [[Maaskantje]] in [[North Brabant]], a group of friends: Gerrie, Richard, Rikkert, Robbie and Barrie lose their jobs. The group perceives themselves as being victims of the widely reported [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|credit crisis]], although in actuality their misfortune is the direct result of their idleness, lack of common sense, and poor punctuality. Gerrie, for instance, turns up to work late and drives the forks of his fork-lift truck into a pallet of boxed plasma screen televisions. Similarly Richard brings his old [[bulldog]] to work with him, who in turn gnaws at and breaks the shovels of Richard's supervisor, and Rikkert is sacked by his boss, a sarcastic and abusive garage owner.

Gerrie is kicked out by his mother, after she catches him trying to steal from her purse. At around the same time, Rikkert breaks up with Manuela, his girlfriend, and Barrie's house (which is also an illegal cannabis farm) catches fire. Subsequently all three take refuge in the home of Richard and Robbie. The group go shopping and rely on Richard to pay, however his bank card is declined following the refuelling of Rikkerts Opel Manta. The group travel together to the local employment and benefits office and demand more benefits from the official, who politely refuses. Richard climbs over the desk and thrusts the official against the wall, telling him to "Give us more money, 'kut'". The following morning, Richard reads a letter sent from the benefits office and informs the group that as a whole their benefits have ceased entirely. The result of which is that the group decides that they simply will no longer pay for anything and go on a spree of petty robbery, most notably from their local petrol filling station, as the group run from the forecourt each carrying two large capacity containers full of fuel, chased by the petrol station attendant, similarly the group flee the local supermarket "Lupus" each carrying large quantities of lager. Gerrie steals deep-fried croquette snacks from the local takeaway whilst Barrie acts as a diversion. Richard, Robbie and Rikkert phone a delivering Chinese takeaway, but explain they have no money to pay the delivery rider when he comes to deliver.

With their level of criminality rising, more and more letters and final demands come through Richard's letterbox, followed by a visit from a debt collector, firstly deceived by a local [[Down syndrome]] sufferer - who is duped into opening the front door by Richard and the group - who confuses the collector by uttering the words "Lorry driver", before slamming the door closed again. He is 'paid' with a slice of ham, which he is led to believe is a ten-Euro note. The collector rings the doorbell again and this time is met by Richard. He explains there are serious concerns, before Richard reiterates that they are paying for nothing anymore. The debt collector starts to explain that that is not going to work, before being promptly punched in the nose and falling to the ground. He returns shortly afterwards, flanked by the local Police chief who is additionally punched by Richard.

Their actions draw the attention of a popular Brabant-based journalist, who makes a report on group for TV Brabant. They are presented in a sympathetic light and are described as victims with no focus being placed upon the severity of their illegal actions. The report sparks a series of imitation riots in other towns and cities across The Netherlands.

In the full swing of the crisis, Gerrie takes Barrie by bus to go to an old friend of his, Peter Aerts, aka "The Lumberjack", who is now a  professional kickboxer to borrow a large sum of money. With this money he goes to a casino, where he places the entire loan on a single number at the [[Roulette]] table and wins. The entire group join him and although are unnaware of the origin of such a large amount of cash, are thrilled to have won against the odds. Gerrie however bets it all again, loses everything and promptly vanishes from the casino before the rest of the group discover what he has done. Then Rickert loses his [[Opel Manta]] as it gets picked up and towed away by the local authorities. Despite chasing it for a short distance with a small child's bicycle, the car is lost (except for a wheel that was secure to the kerbstone in an effort to prevent it from being removed.)

In response to the rising levels of [[civil unrest]] throughout the region, the Ministry of Defence in [[The Hague]] decides to wipe Maaskantje off the map in an attempt to stop the riots; however, the plan goes wrong when the neighboring town of Schijndel is accidentally bombed by mistake. The government explain the accident as a rogue Belgian missile experiencing technical problems and assures the population that the Netherlands and Belgium are not at war. When they see it, the boys know the situation is critical.

Walking back to Maaskantje they are apparently ambushed by multiple bursts of automatic weapon fire. Barrie is shot in the chest, but is apparently unharmed. The source of the gunfire is, however, Gerrie - who had met a farmer who had kept some weapons in his barn from [[World War II]]. He shows the group his cache of antique weaponry and invites them to take their pick. Whilst singing the Nazi anthem, he is accidentally shot in the head by Gerry, than Rikkert laughs and says: "more weapons per man."

Maaskantje is evacuated by the local residents, whilst the group make their way back into town, rendezvousing with their friends and colleagues. The five men team with Manuela, the owner of the local takeaway and the recently sacked local police chief. The Chinese restaurant delivery rider arrives and explains that he too wishes to help, before being one of the first casualties of the incoming troops. The troops are held back by bazooka, machine gun and rifle fire from the group and their friends.

[[File:Maaskantje - Cafetaria 't Pleintje.jpg|thumb|Cafetaria 't Pleintje in Den Dungen, often featured location in comedy sketches by the New Kids]]
The takeaway owner is cornered by a sole officer and was saved by a single shot to the back of the officer's head by Gerrie. The cafetaria owner exclaims that he could not be more proud of his son. Gerrie is taken back, but accepts a hug from his long-lost father.

The situation comes to a head as Richard faces the leader of the incoming troops, flanked by Barrie, Gerrie, Rikkert, Robbie, Manuela, Gerrie's father and the local police chief. As a thrown smoke grenade clears, the commander holds Richard with a semi-automatic weapon to his head and is flanked himself by several dozen highly armes officers. He orders the group to lower their weapons, which they do, but is caught off-guard by a [[DAF Trucks|DAF]] curtainsider lorry careering through his troops. The lorry comes to a crashing halt off-screen and the curtain splits open, spilling the load of lager. The driver is revealed to be the Down syndrome sufferer.

The Local police chief re-arms himself and promptly shoots the commander in the head.

The group are subsequently arrested and charged with a laundry-list of offences. The punishment is passed at 250 hours [[Community Service]] each. Whilst the five are carrying out the community service, "The Lumberjack" returns and demands repayment. He is about to launch into an attack on the group when he is crushed by a falling set of speakers and turntable deck, accompanied by DJ [[Paul Elstak]].

The tagline of the film is 'Niemand komt aan Maaskantje!' (No one messes with Maaskantje!). In German this is 'Niemand fickt mit Maaskantje!'. (No-one fucks with Maaskantje!)

==Trivia==
A supermarket called LUPUS is shown in the film. This is actually a parody of the Dutch supermarket chain PLUS, which bears a similar logo.

The Forum was first organized in 2004 in Warsaw. Since then, it has been held every year, promoting debate on economic, social and political issues in Europe. The Forum thus allows discussing these matters, confronting them with the European integration project. All of this is done in an independent spirit.

===50 years of existence symposium===

The event attracted many alumni and prestigious guests, including his Royal Highness the [[Prince Philippe of Belgium]], former prime minister and Olivaint alumni [[Jean-Luc Dehaene]], minister [[Armand De Decker]], viscount [[Étienne Davignon]] and many more.

The concept of a "'''pan-Caribbean'''" [[culture area]] refers to recent proposals by an international group of [[archaeologist]]s to the effect that contacts among [[Pre-Columbian]] peoples of the [[Yucatán Peninsula]], the [[Antilles]], [[Central America]], and northern [[South America]] may have been more extensive than heretofore acknowledged.  A pan-Caribbean perspective seeks to emphasize the importance of considering information from the a broad area, one characterized as "the American Mediterranean," in evaluating issues of mobility, exchange, linguistics, ideology, art, material culture, and identity.  The pan-Caribbean area was one whose peoples interacted regularly with those of [[Mesoamerica]], the [[Isthmo-Colombian]] area, and the [[Amazon basin]], creating a context that had significant effects on culture change throughout a large portion of [[the Americas]].

The culture of the Caribbean people as practiced and experienced among the islands of the Caribbean sea, that stretch from the Bahamas in the north to the mainland shores of the Guianasin the south.  Caribbean anthropologist, like their colleagues in sociology, history, geography, political science, are increasingly expanding the frontiers of their respective disciplines to overlap and encompass previous academic boundaries in their quest to effectively represent and interpret the heterogeneity of the Caribbean experience. In terms of the social context of Caribbean people, an increasingly important issue archeologists are addressing relates to the identification of culture diversity.  In recent years, a growing body of indigenous voices in Caribbean archeology is expressing disdain for and resistance to the hegemony of colonialist interpretations of Caribbean pre-Columbian history. As such, new historical frameworks and visions of past dynamics have become centers of active scholarship in Caribbean archeology.&lt;ref&gt;Keegan, William F., [[Corinne Hofman|Corinne Lisette Hofman]], and Reniel Rodríguez Ramos.

The [[piano]] is often used to provide [[harmony|harmonic]] [[accompaniment]] to a [[singer|voice]] or other [[instrument (music)|instrument]]. However, [[solo (music)|solo]] parts for the piano are common in many musical styles. These can take the form of a section in which the piano is heard more prominently than other instruments, or in which the piano may be played entirely [[unaccompanied]].

The term ''piano solo'' is also often used to mean a musical composition written solely for piano.

'''Prosiopesis''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Classical Greek]], προσιωπησις, "becoming silent") is a term coined by [[Otto Jespersen]] for pronouncing a word or phrase without vocalizing its initial sounds. One example Jespersen gave is for "Good morning" to be shortened to "Morning". Jesperson introduced the idea in ''Language, Its Nature, Development, and Origin'' (ASIN B0007DEMMW; 1922); he also discusses it in ''The Philosophy of Grammar'' ({{ISBN|0-226-39881-1}}; reprint 1992). Prosiopesis is studied as a mode for originating interjections, which can shed light on their meaning.

'''Radio promotion''' is the division of a [[record company]] which is charged with placing songs on the [[radio]]. They maintain relationships with [[radio programming|program directors]] at [[radio stations]] and attempt to persuade them to play [[single (music)|single]]s to promote the sale of recordings, such as [[Compact disk|CD]]s, sold by the record company. They may also pay a fee to a third party, known as an independent promoter, who has a financial relationship with the radio station or its parent company.

'''Sexpo 2005''' is [[Southeast Asia]]'s first [[sex exhibition]] held from 18 November to 20 November in [[Singapore]]. 

It was an exhibition event that showcased different aspects of health, lifestyle, culture and novelty. Among the cultural exhibits were miniature sculptures placed in [[dowry]] boxes to teach young couples how to consummate their marriage, an early form of Chinese sex education that dates from the [[Qing Dynasty]] (1644-1911).

The event also included seminars and forums by medical doctors, [[sexologist]] and other experts on [[sexual health]] problems and solutions. There were also sessions on [[sensual dancing]] and novelties, some of which were restricted to people above the age of 21 years. Other topics included [[infertility]] and treatments, and advice on how parents can discuss [[sex education]] with their children. 

More than 43,000 visitors witnessed this inaugural event in Singapore.

'''''Steven Universe''''' is an American [[animated series|animated television series]] created by [[Rebecca Sugar]] for [[Cartoon Network]]. It is the [[coming-of-age story]] of a young boy, [[Steven Universe (character)|Steven Universe]] (voiced by [[Zach Callison]]), who lives with the Crystal Gems—magical, humanoid aliens named [[Pearl (Steven Universe)|Pearl]] ([[Deedee Magno Hall]]), [[Garnet (Steven Universe)|Garnet]] ([[Estelle (musician)|Estelle]]), and [[Amethyst (Steven Universe)|Amethyst]] ([[Michaela Dietz]])—in the fictional town of Beach City. Steven, who is half-Gem, has adventures with his friends and helps the Gems protect the world from their own kind. ''Steven Universe'' premiered on November 4, 2013, and is Cartoon Network's first animated show solely created by a woman. The themes of the series include love, family, and the importance of healthy interpersonal relationships. Books, comics and video games based on the series have been released, and a film is in development.

Sugar based the lead character on her younger brother Steven, who is an artist for the series. She developed ''Steven Universe'' while she was a writer and storyboard artist on ''[[Adventure Time]]'', which she left when Cartoon Network commissioned her series for full production. The series is storyboard-driven; when episodes are being produced the show's storyboard artists are responsible for writing the dialogue and blocking out the action. The series has developed a broad fan base and has been critically acclaimed for its design, music, voice acting, characterization, prominence of [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] themes and [[science fantasy]] worldbuilding. It has been nominated for four [[Primetime Emmy Award for Short-format Animation|Emmy Awards]] and five [[Annie Awards]], and was renewed for a fourth and fifth season in March 2016.

==Synopsis==
''Steven Universe'' is set in the fictional town of Beach City, located on the [[Delmarva Peninsula]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sugar|first1=Rebecca|title=I am Rebecca Sugar, creator of Steven Universe, and former Adventure Time storyboarder, AMA!|date=August 20, 2014|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2e4gmx/i_am_rebecca_sugar_creator_of_steven_universe_and/cjw4mo6|website=[[Reddit]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151213200144/https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2e4gmx/i_am_rebecca_sugar_creator_of_steven_universe_and/cjw4mo6|archivedate=December 13, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the [[East Coast of the United States|American East Coast]]. The Crystal Gems live in an ancient beachside temple and protect humanity from monsters and other threats. The Gems are ageless alien warriors who project female humanoid forms from magical gemstones at the core of their being. The Crystal Gems comprise Garnet, Amethyst, Pearl and Steven—a young, half-human, half-Gem boy who inherited his gemstone from his mother, the Crystal Gems' former leader Rose Quartz. As Steven tries to understand his gradually-expanding range of powers, he spends his days with his father Greg, his friend Connie, his magical pet lion, other residents of Beach City, and the Gems. He explores the abilities inherited from his mother, which include fusion—the ability of Gems to merge their bodies and abilities to form new, more-powerful personalities.

The series's first season gradually reveals that the Crystal Gems are remnants of a great interstellar empire. During their missions they visit ruins that were once important to Gem culture but have been derelict for millennia. The Gems are cut off from the Gem &lt;!-- lowercase because used as a description and not as a proper noun here --&gt;homeworld, and Steven learns that many of the monsters and artifacts they encounter are Gems who were corrupted by a Gem weapon of mass destruction and can no longer maintain rational, humanoid form. By the end of the first season, Steven learns that, millennia ago, the Gem empire intended to sterilize the Earth to incubate new Gems, but Rose Quartz led her supporters, the Crystal Gems, in a violent and apparently successful rebellion against this genocidal plan. In the present, the Gem empire's machinations again begin to extend towards Earth with the arrival of hostile envoys Peridot and Jasper.

In the second season, Peridot allies with and eventually joins the Crystal Gems to prevent Earth's destruction by a Gem "geo-weapon" buried in the planet. During the third season, Lapis Lazuli, an errant Gem from Homeworld, decides to live on Earth with Peridot; Jasper is defeated and captured, and Steven learns that his mother shattered one of the Gem empire's matriarchs, Pink Diamond. In the fourth season, as Steven wrestles with his conflicted feelings about his mother's actions, the Gem empire leaders Blue Diamond and Yellow Diamond return their full attention to Earth. In the fifth season, Steven learns that in fact his mother ''was'' Pink Diamond, who faked her death to assume the identity of Rose Quartz; when Blue and Yellow Diamond personally attack Earth, he stops their assault by revealing the secret to them.

==Conception==
[[File:Rebecca Sugar Speaking at New York Comic Con 2014 - Peter Dzubay (cropped).jpeg|thumb|upright|alt+Rebecca Sugar, a smiling, bespectacled young woman|Rebecca Sugar (creator of ''Steven Universe'') is the first woman to create a show for Cartoon Network.]]
In 2011, after former Cartoon Network vice-president of comedy animation Curtis Lelash asked the staff for ideas for a new series, Rebecca Sugar—an artist working for the network's series ''[[Adventure Time]]''—described her initial ideas for what would become ''Steven Universe'', and the project was chosen for development. While developing her show, Sugar continued working on ''Adventure Time''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was inspired by Sugar's short story "Ballad of Margo and Dread" about a sensitive child helping teenagers with problems they cannot verbalize.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cartoon Network executives commissioned the show after the crew's art presentation and Sugar became the first woman to create a show independently for the network.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before a production team had been appointed, Sugar tried to alter elements of the show's plot and developed the character's identity so her crew would have the freedom she did when she worked for ''Adventure Time''.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development ===
When Sugar's show was commissioned, she resigned from her role as a storyboard artist on ''Adventure Time'' to focus on her own series.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Sugar focused the pilot short on the main characters and their personalities to demonstrate the series' humor. The pilot is a [[Slice of life|slice-of-life]] episode that does not involve major events because the series' world was still in development.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Sugar and her production team focused the plot on interaction between the Crystal Gems and Steven.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|pp=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sugar strove to make her pilot distinctive in terms of its artistic and aesthetic detail but the time limit imposed upon her by Cartoon Network hampered her. This unsuccessful experience helped Sugar develop the show's concept; she said, "to know that there is so much more that you can't see and the way that knowledge frustrates and excites and confuses and scares you".&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

The title character Steven is loosely based on Steven Sugar, Rebecca's younger brother.&lt;ref name="Cavna 2013-11-01" /&gt; During ''Steven Universe''{{'s}} development, Sugar repeatedly asked her brother whether naming the show after him was a good idea; she stopped asking when it was commissioned. Her brother had no problem with it and trusted Sugar to use his name wisely.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In an interview with the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]],'' Sugar discussed developing the background of the show's protagonist, saying she wanted to base the character's viewpoint on her brother growing up "where you're so comfortable in your life because you get all the attention, but you also want to rise up and not be the little brother".&lt;ref name="Ito 2013-07-26"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/28/movies/rising-animators-spring-into-motion.html|title=Rising Animators Spring Into Motion|last=Ito|first=Robert|date=July 26, 2013|work=New York Times|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130803055430/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/28/movies/rising-animators-spring-into-motion.html|archivedate=August 3, 2013|deadurl=no|author2=Jeremy Egner|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the original pilot was presented to Cartoon Network executives, they told the crew the series would air in 2013.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Cartoon Network released the original pilot in May 2013. Sugar and her team panicked because the series was going to be very different from the pilot episode. The pilot was popular when it was released, engendering forum discussions in which people expressed their hopes of seeing it on the air soon. Those who knew Rebecca Sugar from ''Adventure Time'' were also interested. Positive reaction to the show reassured its crew.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To prepare for the show's commissioning by Cartoon Network, Sugar began assembling a production crew.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Jackie Buscarino was engaged as a producer in September 2012 and was tasked with hiring people and supervising the show's crew.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period of development, Sugar and her team were moved to a building behind the main Cartoon Network studio and based on the same floor as the crew of ''[[The Powerpuff Girls]]'' CGI special. Some artists who had worked on the special, such as colorist Tiffany Ford and art directors Kevin Dart, Ellie Michalka and Jasmin Lai, were later invited to join the ''Steven Universe'' team.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cartoon Network also provided Sugar with a list of suggested writers; when she saw Ben Levin and Matt Burnett (former writers for ''[[Level Up (U.S. TV series)|Level Up]]'') on the list she immediately asked them to join her team because she was familiar with their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|pp=48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freelance artist Danny Hynes, whom the former supervising director Ian Jones-Quartey knew from his own project ''[[OK K.O.! Let's Be Heroes|Lakewood Plaza Turbo]]'', became the show's lead character designer.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|pp=49; 54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steven Sugar was assigned as the background designer after his work on the original pilot,&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; and was assisted by Dart, Michalka, Lai, background painter Amanda Winterston and others.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the art presentation, Jones-Quartey, Guy, Hynes and Steven Sugar created artwork that differed from their previous work. Jones-Quartey wanted to work with something new, retaining elements of the show's previous project.&lt;ref name="McDonnell 2017 55; 60"&gt;{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|pp=55; 60}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked with Elle Michalka, who later took over his role as background painter for the presentation, to create concept art for an "action-comedy" series.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time, Jones-Quartey added stars to the series' logo because he saw them as a versatile symbol. He later said he over-used them, and they were criticized at the art presentation.&lt;ref name="McDonnell 2017 55; 60" /&gt; The art presentation's drawings were by Rebecca Sugar, Jones-Quartey, Hynes, Paul Villeco (a writer and storyboard artist) and Steven Sugar. Michalka did the painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Design ===
During the development of the ''Steven Universe'' pilot, Sugar focused much attention on the design of the world, adding notes to her drawings.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by the idea of foreign figures (Gems) living human lives, she drew many sketches depicting their world and history. The series' design was also inspired by her and her brother's interest in video games, comics and animation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After the series was commissioned, Sugar decided to redesign everything to make the series "flexible and simple" for future production staff to add ideas of their own.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; During this time, the creative director was Kevin Dart, followed by Jasmin Lai, Elle Michalka and Ricky Cometa.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dart's artistic style remained a great influence on the show after his departure. Steven Sugar praised Dart's work and was inspired by him in college years, saying Dart had more ideas for the art than he did.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

In the pilot, the locations the Temple and the Big Donut appeared. The Temple was designed by Ian Jones-Quartey, Steven Sugar, Ben Levin, Matt Burnett and [[Andy Ristaino]]. The Temple's dual faces were based on Guy Davis' ideas.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Steven Sugar designed the rest of Beach City for the series; he was painstaking in his attention to detail. Sugar also designed people, houses, cars, buildings and restaurants. Because of Rebecca Sugar's redesigned drawings, the two original locations had to be redrawn.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

To find inspiration for the show's backgrounds, Rebecca and Steven Sugar, and Jones-Quartey went to their favorite beaches.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The series' setting, Beach City, is loosely based on Delaware beaches [[Rehoboth Beach, Delaware|Rehoboth Beach]], [[Bethany Beach, Delaware|Bethany Beach]] and [[Dewey Beach, Delaware|Dewey Beach]], all of which Rebecca Sugar visited as a child.&lt;ref name="Cavna 2013-11-01"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/tv/steven-universe-creator-rebecca-sugar-is-an-idealistic-trailblazer/2013/11/01/fe622da2-4338-11e3-a751-f032898f2dbc_story.html |title='Steven Universe' creator Rebecca Sugar is a Cartoon Network trailblazer |last=Cavna |first=Michael |date=November 1, 2013 |work=The Washington Post |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111171925/https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/tv/steven-universe-creator-rebecca-sugar-is-an-idealistic-trailblazer/2013/11/01/fe622da2-4338-11e3-a751-f032898f2dbc_story.html |archive-date=November 11, 2013 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steven Sugar drew Beach City with a boardwalk lined with a variety of shops.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; He wanted it to have a "specific style" so viewers could believe it was based on a real location; he drew the roads and shops consistently oriented with the Temple and a water tower.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The concept for the primary setting was inspired by [[Akira Toriyama]]'s ''[[Dr. Slump]]'', which features a small environment in which the recurring characters live where they work. Steven Sugar made the boardwalk the focus of ''Steven Universe''{{'}}s human world.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Characters ===
During the early stages of production, Sugar worked on character appearance and personality development simultaneously;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; during this process of conception, she was heavily inspired by fantasy television characters she and her brother used to draw when they were younger.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Lead character designer Danny Hynes, influenced by the design of [[Mickey Mouse]] by [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] artists, wanted the characters to be standardized, simple and recognizable.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed 24 human characters to the crew; Rebecca and Steven Sugar drew 22 designs—13 of which were made official. The coloring was done by Jones-Quartey.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|pp=52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rebecca Sugar merged several characters during the pilot development;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; supporting characters Lars and Sadie were originally created when she was in college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2e4gmx/i_am_rebecca_sugar_creator_of_steven_universe_and/cjvzqk3|title=I am Rebecca Sugar, creator of Steven Universe, and former Adventure Time storyboarder, AMA!|last1=Sugar|first1=Rebecca|date=August 20, 2014|website=[[Reddit]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150822171741/https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2e4gmx/i_am_rebecca_sugar_creator_of_steven_universe_and/cjvzqk3|archivedate=August 22, 2015|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pizza family was based on Jones-Quartey's [[Ghanaian people|Ghanaian]] family,&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; and Ronaldo was created by Ben Levin and Matt Burnett.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; Guy Davis, a childhood friend of the Sugars, designed the early monsters and Gem architecture.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Making a character "look alive" was always a priority in their design; according to Jones-Quartey, a character's emotions should be clearly delineated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character design team's mission is for the characters to resemble a classic cartoon such as 1940s Disney cartoons, ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'' or [[Osamu Tezuka]], and [[Harvey Kurtzman]]'s projects. In drawing the characters for each episode, the crew has two weeks to make modifications.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Character names and some designs were inspired by types of food,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|pp=54–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some characters were redesigned because the pilot revealed discrepancies between appearances and personalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=77; 80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sugar planned for the characters' designs to receive visual benchmarks so the show's artists can draw them consistently.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sugar aimed to make the designs for her characters simple, flexible and consistent so the production team members would not become bogged down by over-complex details.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; This redesigning meant the appearances of the characters in the pilot episode differs substantially from their depiction in the television series.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Sugar wanted the Gems to resemble humans; she developed the Crystal Gems to ride a roller coaster of family life with Steven,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; whom they would treat like a brother.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; She wanted their gems to reflect their personalities; Pearl's perfect smoothness, Amethyst's coarseness and Garnet's air of mystery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2e4gmx/i_am_rebecca_sugar_creator_of_steven_universe_and/cjvyr7j|title=I am Rebecca Sugar, creator of Steven Universe, and former Adventure Time storyboarder, AMA!|last1=Sugar|first1=Rebecca|date=August 20, 2014|website=[[Reddit]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151111003100/https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2e4gmx/i_am_rebecca_sugar_creator_of_steven_universe_and/cjvyr7j|archivedate=November 11, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sugar, the Gems are "some version of me&amp;nbsp;... neurotic, lazy, decisive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2e4gmx/i_am_rebecca_sugar_creator_of_steven_universe_and/cjw018y|title=I am Rebecca Sugar, creator of Steven Universe, and former Adventure Time storyboarder, AMA!|last1=Sugar|first1=Rebecca|date=August 20, 2014|website=[[Reddit]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151111001526/https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2e4gmx/i_am_rebecca_sugar_creator_of_steven_universe_and/cjw018y|archivedate=November 11, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their facial designs were influenced by [[Wassily Kandinsky]], who taught at the  [[Bauhaus]] and encouraged his students to pair three colors—red, yellow and blue—with the three basic shapes—square, triangle and circle. Because of the characters' personalities, Garnet is square, Amethyst is a sphere and Pearl is a cone.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Sugar wanted to give the Gems a superpower similar to those of classic cartoon characters such as [[Bugs Bunny]]. The Gems' ability to shape-shift is a reference to older cartoons such as [[Tex Avery]]'s work for [[MGM]], where characters would change at will. Although the Crystal Gems are intended to be serious characters, the writers wanted them to be "funny and weird" as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
According to Sugar, production for ''Steven Universe'' began while she was working on ''Adventure Time'', her last episode for which was "[[Simon &amp; Marcy]]". Working on both series simultaneously became impossible; she also encountered difficulty in the production of the episode, "[[Bad Little Boy]]".&lt;ref name="Kohn 2013-11-01"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/television/adventure-time-writer-rebecca-sugar-on-steven-universe|title=''Adventure Time'' Writer Rebecca Sugar on ''Steven Universe'', Being Cartoon Network's First Female Show Creator And Why Pop Art Is 'Offensive'|last=Kohn|first=Eric|date=November 1, 2013|publisher=[[Indiewire]]|page=1|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103000634/http://www.indiewire.com/article/television/adventure-time-writer-rebecca-sugar-on-steven-universe|archivedate=November 3, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cartoon Network executives authorized the ''Steven Universe'' production crew to begin working after their pre-production presentation, for which the crew were well-prepared. The episodes "Cheeseburger Backpack" and "Together Breakfast" were developed at this time.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Although Sugar works as executive producer on the series' art, animation and sound, she considers herself "the most hands on" at the storyboarding stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2e4gmx/i_am_rebecca_sugar_creator_of_steven_universe_and/cjvykrt|title=I am Rebecca Sugar, creator of Steven Universe, and former Adventure Time storyboarder, AMA!|last1=Sugar|first1=Rebecca|date=August 20, 2014|website=[[Reddit]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151111001454/https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2e4gmx/i_am_rebecca_sugar_creator_of_steven_universe_and/cjvykrt|archivedate=November 11, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The episode outlines are passed to the storyboarders, who block out the action for the episode and write its dialogue. The storyboards are animated, using paper drawings and the production crew's designs, by one of two Korean studios; [[Sunmin Image Pictures|Sunmin]] and [[Rough Draft Studios|Rough Draft]]&lt;ref name="Ben Levin 15 May 2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ben-levin.tumblr.com/post/119088359955/i-heard-somewhere-that-it-takes-8-9-months-for|title=15 May 2015|last1=Levin|first1=Ben|date=May 15, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518111003/http://ben-levin.tumblr.com/post/119088359955/i-heard-somewhere-that-it-takes-8-9-months-for|archivedate=May 18, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the production crew's designs.&lt;ref name="Hot Topic"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9rQlh0KxYo|title=Interview: Steven Universe Creator Rebecca Sugar|date=June 6, 2014|publisher=Hot Topic|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208165339/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9rQlh0KxYo|archivedate=December 8, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Storyboard ===
[[File:Steven Universe storyboard from Island Adventure.png|thumb|upright=1.2|alt=Drawing of an anxious-looking character|Portion of the [[storyboard]] and script from the episode, "Island Adventure". The series' storyboard artists are also its writers.]]
During storyboard meetings, artists draw their ideas on [[post-it note]]s, which are then attached to walls, table and boxes in the corners of their conference room. The drawings play a major role in forming episode ideas; Sugar looks at these designs and occasionally makes changes to key poses. Sugar likes to review and re-draw scenes and characters to add extra pathos and emotion to storyboards.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=207}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each episode's storyboards are created by two artists, each of whom writes half of the dialogue and draws panels similar to comic strips. This process can be quite complex; the storyboard artists must block out the [[cinematography]] and focus on [[scenic design]] in a way similar to film production. After the panels are made, the thumbnail-storyboard artists draw mannerisms and dialogue based on their own experiences; Sugar draws "quintessential" scenes from her memories of hanging out with her brother after school.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; The storyboard artists then discuss their work with the rest of the crew and make any necessary changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the team discussion, the storyboard artists draw a revised board—based on the thumbnail board—on a full-size panel with notes. The storyboards are again discussed, corrected and finally approved.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Writing ===
During the pilot development, Sugar wrote and sketched a number of plot ideas that later became episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series' initial premise focused mostly on Steven's human side, rather than his magic side, but the premise was later changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|pp=43; 48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sugar developed the Gems' history in conjunction with the pilot episode.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While the first season of the show introduced the human and Gem characters and their relationships, Sugar began to plot and explore second-season storylines involving the Crystal Gems.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Sugar created a chart with taped printouts about a 2,000-year Gem and Earth history, with a number of events needing to be "fleshed out" for production. Although the series' overall plot is established, the writers improvise to arrive at its ending; according to Matt Burnett, the storylines will be resolved by the series' end.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sugar wanted the series to focus on comedy and positivity before exploring controversial subjects involving the main characters, thinking it was "more honest" to begin the show with happiness instead of action or drama.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The writers—formerly Levin and Burnett—would write the premises and outlines while the storyboarders wrote and drew the episodes.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://ianjq.tumblr.com/post/74241332119/hey-i-am-a-screenwriting-student-from-emerson |title=Hey!

They discuss episode pacing and vary each season's texture by balancing "lighter" and "heavier" story arcs.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; Changes in major-character appearances—such as Yellow Diamond—in a storyline can be difficult for the writers.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; According to Ben Levin, writing a season of ''Steven Universe'' is like a "jigsaw puzzle" because the writing team must assemble a number of plot ideas, which are discarded if they do not benefit character growth. After further discussion and questions about the writing, an idea becomes an episode. After discussing a season's proposed episodes the "puzzle" is complete, and they begin writing a major story arc or a season finale. Burnett said writing a season is like an algebraic equation "where one side is the season finale, and the x's and y's are the episodes we need for that solution to make sense"; he cited "Ocean Gem", "Steven the Sword Fighter", "Monster Buddies", "An Indirect Kiss" and "Serious Steven" as examples. Those episodes led to the season-one finale as a minor story arc.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; To develop new ideas for episodes, the writers play writing games. In one, a scenario with characters is drawn and passed to another writer. The second writer adds a few sentences before giving it to a third, until the drawing has a three-act story. Episodes such as "Island Adventure", "Future Boy Zoltron" and "Onion Friend" were written this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|pp=107–108}}&lt;/ref&gt; The writers also play drawing games, which design new Gem characters and technological ideas. Burnett said he and Levin use fewer ideas from the storyboarders than they previously did; storyboarders change fewer things than they did before because the episodes have a "stronger continuity".&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

According to Levin, he and Burnett try to balance the focus between the main characters—with Steven in the center—and the theme of episodes in their writing. The balance indicates Steven has the same interests on his human side as he does on his Gem side. Levin said the Gem mythology and drama would have been less interesting if Steven was not as well-developed in the first few episodes. Grateful to work on a show which is unafraid to be "sincere and vulnerable", he said if every episode was emotional the series would become formulaic; happy episodes balance out emotional ones.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; Levin said he and Burnett have found ways to integrate Steven's powers into the plot. The character's powers and home-world technology are revealed at a "measured (very slow) pace", satisfying the viewer and keeping the series clear of superhero territory.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

Before significant plotlines air, the writers reveal information relevant to a "climactic" episode for the audience. According to storyboard artist Hilary Florido, much of the series' action and magic are narrative climaxes, demonstrating the characters' discoveries, difficulties and views. Florido said if a character's evolution is not directly related to the plot, there is no drama.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; The crew is discouraged from breaking perspective involving episode development as they want the audience to know the protagonist's point of view. Although the writers could hint at future events, they prefer to focus on plot and develop Steven in real time. Levin said if the pilot tried to present Gem history in five minutes, the audience and protagonist would be equally confused.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

=== Backgrounds ===
The production of background art begins after the approved storyboards are received. If the characters visit old locations, the pre-existing backgrounds are modified for authenticity; it is likely locations would change slightly over time. Steven Sugar likes to hide narrative bits in the backgrounds because he believes the key to world-building is "having a cohesive underlying structure to everything".&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former art director Elle Michalka said the backgrounds' artistic style was inspired by French post-impressionist painter [[Paul Cézanne]], whose apparent lack of focus belied detail and specificity. The art was also inspired by [[Tao Te Ching]], whose work highlights the importance of empty spaces, "like the space within a vase as being part of the vase that makes it useful".&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; During the painting phase, the painters see the lines as "descriptive bones" and color is used loosely, meaning the color is intentionally slightly off register, highlighting the distinction between color and line.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; The painters used "superimposed" watercolor texture before switching to [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]] because the former made the backgrounds "very chunky". When painting the backgrounds, they use one primary and several secondary colors; Amanda Winterston and Jasmin Lai found suitable color combinations. After the primary backgrounds are painted, they are sent to the color stylist, who chooses colors for a character or prop from model sheets, matching and complementing the storyboard and background. The lines of the character or prop are rarely colored. The lines are removed when scenes need light effects. The coloring in early season-one episodes was experimental because the stylist would have difficulty if a storyboard's character and background mixed together or a bright character walked unchanged into a shadow. Mistakes became rare as the crew planned and checked storyboards. The primary backgrounds are made in Burbank; the secondary ones by Korean artists.&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Animation ===
After the crew finishes constructing an episode, the production team sends it to animators in Korea. The animation is produced by [[Sunmin Image Pictures]] and [[Rough Draft Studios|Rough Draft Korea]]. The production team and animators communicate by email and sometimes use video chat when animating a major episode. Before sending the episode to one of the studios, animation director Nick DeMayo and his team create a plan for the animators after reviewing the [[Storyboard#Animatics|animatics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; They then add character movements on [[exposure sheet]]s to guide the animators. Mouth assignments for the characters, describing mouth shapes and timing for lip-syncing, follow.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|pp=197–198}}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode is then sent to one of the animation studios. The black-and-white version is sent first, followed about two weeks later by the colored version&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=198}}&lt;/ref&gt; The animation is drawn and inked on paper, then scanned and colored digitally. The crew then arranges a "work print" meeting to discuss the episode and review it for errors. DeMayo notes any errors, removes them and sends the episode back to the animation studio or to Cartoon Network's post-production department to fix any remaining issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minor animation mistakes or omissions are fixed by the crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show's four main voice actors—Callison, Dietz, Magno and Estelle—spend three to four hours recording per session; three to four weeks a month for ten months each year. Cast members record together or separately; they are often recording multiple episodes. Each recording session covers a new episode and includes retakes for that episode or previous ones if needed. In group recording sessions, a maximum of six actors stand in a semicircle.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sugar and voice director [[Kent Osborne]] attend the sessions,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|pp=155–156}}&lt;/ref&gt; advising the actors about voicing the characters in specific situations. If they like a take, the production assistant marks it and gives it to the animation editor for the episode's rough cut. When a recording session begins, Sugar explains the storyboards and describes the sequences, character intention and the relationship between them; Osborne does the recording. Before the sessions, Sugar and the voice actors discuss new plot elements and shows them the advanced storyboards. Magno said she enjoys the group recording sessions because the funny faces the cast members make while recording lines requiring emotion or movement often cause them to laugh.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

===Music===
''Steven Universe'' features songs and musical numbers produced by Sugar and her writers, who collaborate on each song's lyrics. Multiple drafts of the theme song's lyrics were written.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sugar composed the extended theme song while waiting in line for a [[Airport security|security check]] at [[Los Angeles International Airport]].&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; The series relies on [[leitmotif]]s for its soundtrack; instruments, genres and melodies are allotted to specific characters. The music is influenced by the works of [[Michael Jackson]] and Estelle;&lt;ref name=":24"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noisey.vice.com/blog/steven-universe-composers-aivi-surrashu-interview|title=Dropping Gems: An Interview with the Composers of the Score for 'Steven Universe'|author=Eric Thurm|date=January 16, 2016|website=noisey.vice.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160814111713/http://noisey.vice.com/blog/steven-universe-composers-aivi-surrashu-interview|archivedate=August 14, 2016|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Sugar has cited [[Aimee Mann]] as "a huge influence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2e4gmx/i_am_rebecca_sugar_creator_of_steven_universe_and/cjvyk5b|title=I am Rebecca Sugar, creator of Steven Universe, and former Adventure Time storyboarder, AMA!|last1=Sugar|first1=Rebecca|date=August 20, 2014|website=[[Reddit]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151111003057/https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2e4gmx/i_am_rebecca_sugar_creator_of_steven_universe_and/cjvyk5b|archivedate=November 11, 2015|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sugar writes songs for the series during her travels, accompanying herself on a ukulele.&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not every episode features a song; according to Sugar, she uses them occasionally, to avoid forced creativity.&lt;ref name="Kohn 2013-11-01" /&gt;

Most of the show's incidental music is composed by the [[chiptune]] piano duo Aivi and Surasshu, with guitars by [[Stemage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stemagemusic.com/blog/category/heft|title=Heft!|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160708222330/http://www.stemagemusic.com/blog/category/heft|archivedate=July 8, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeff Liu, who was familiar with producer Aivi's musical score for the video game ''Cryamore'', recommended her to Sugar as a composer. Sugar asked Aivi to audition and agreed that producer Surasshu could join her.  Aivi and Surasshu scored a clip from "Gem Glow", the series' first episode; Sugar liked their work and hired them as series composers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before composing an episode, Aivi and Surasshu video chat with Sugar and the creative director to discuss the episode; they have a week to send Sugar a preview score.&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; After any necessary changes, Aivi and Surasshu send the score to Sabre Media Studios for the final mix with their sound designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|pp=162–163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each character has an instrumental theme expressing their personality, which changes slightly depending on the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|pp=161–162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pearl is often accompanied by a piano, Garnet by a synth bass, Amethyst by a drum machine with electric bass and synths, and Steven with chiptune tones.&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; Sound palettes were produced for the human characters to represent the evolution of the series, its characters and their relationships. Sound motifs and palettes were also created for locations, objects and abstract concepts.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; When Sugar or the other writers write a song for an episode, they record a demo that is sent to the composers. The same musical style for a song and the character singing it is used for each song. Over time, the songs have become increasingly complex and production has become more difficult because the show's original musical style no longer fits perfectly with the newer lyrical themes. An example is "Here Comes a Thought", sung by Estelle and [[AJ Michalka]] (who voices Stevonnie). The two were less inspired by a specific musical style, but rather by the song's "feel", which Sugar had explained to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2015, Cartoon Network has aired new episodes in groups of five over one week—marketed as "Stevenbombs"—rather than one episode per week. The hiatuses between groups have irritated fans, according to ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' causing "agonized cries of a rabid, starving, pained cult following".&lt;ref name="The A.V. Club 20 April 2016" /&gt; The format, which is also used for other Cartoon Network series, has, in the website's view, contributed to the network's spikes in [[Google Trends]] associated with each "bomb". ''The A.V. Club'' attributed the effect to ''Steven Universe''{{'}}s unusual—for a youth cartoon—adherence to an overarching plot, which can generate "massive swells of online interest"—similar to the release of full seasons of adult TV series—which are "crucial to a network's vitality in an increasingly internet-based television world".&lt;ref name="The A.V. Club 20 April 2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Blumenfeld|first1=Zach|title=Steven Universe's frustrating schedule is crucial to its success|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/steven-universes-frustrating-schedule-crucial-its--234864|work=The A.V.

In May 2018, Cartoon Network apologized to fans after one of the channel's promotional videos contained unaired footage with significant [[Spoiler (media)|spoilers]] for future episodes. In response to the video, former series producer [[Ian Jones-Quartey]] noted in a later-deleted tweet that "being a ''Steven Universe'' fan is suffering", alluding to the series's irregular and unpredictable airing schedule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Polo|first1=Susana|title=Cartoon Network might have accidentally spoiled the end of Steven Universe (Update)|url=https://www.polygon.com/platform/amp/2018/5/3/17315264/steven-universe-ending-spoilers-cartoon-network|accessdate=5 May 2018|work=www.polygon.com|date=3 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sugar wanted ''Steven Universe'' to be thematically consistent with hers and her brother's shared interests.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a coming-of-age series, the theme of family is important since Sugar based the titular character on her brother. Additionally, the theme of love was inspired by her relationship with Jones-Quartey.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|pp=124–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series also expresses the importance of acceptance,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=224}}&lt;/ref&gt; and explores relationships, [[LGBT]] identity, body shapes and "hues of skin in a colorful sci-fi magic display of diversity".&lt;ref name=":25" /&gt; According to Kat Morris, the series' central concepts are developed over time in an organic way, rather than being "overly calculated" from the start.&lt;ref name=":25"&gt;{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former writer Matt Burnett said the series' simple-life theme prevented the inclusion of "cynicism" or "snarkiness".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to Burnett, the writers have no interest in a superhero theme.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The unusually strong female presence in a series about a boy—all major characters except Steven and Greg are female—is intentional according to Sugar, who intended to "tear down and play with the [[semiotics]] of gender in cartoons for children"; she considered it absurd that shows for boys should be fundamentally different from those for girls. The series' plot is developing towards a distant goal; everything in between is kept flexible, partly because her intentions have "changed since I've started because I've grown up a lot" while working on the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/06/15/steven-universe-creator-growing-gender-politics-her-brother|title=Steven Universe creator Rebecca Sugar on growing up, gender politics and her brother|last1=Howe-Smith|first1=Nia|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|issue=June 15, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150622204857/http://www.ew.com/article/2015/06/15/steven-universe-creator-growing-gender-politics-her-brother|archivedate=June 22, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sugar described the series as "reverse escapism"; the idea that fantasy characters would become interested in real life and would want to participate in it. Steven personifies the "love affair between fantasy and reality".&lt;ref name="Hot Topic" /&gt; Sugar said ''Steven Universe'' was influenced by the anime series ''[[Future Boy Conan]]'', ''[[Revolutionary Girl Utena]]'' and ''[[The Simpsons]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2e4gmx/i_am_rebecca_sugar_creator_of_steven_universe_and/cjvykmy|title=I am Rebecca Sugar, creator of Steven Universe, and former Adventure Time storyboarder, AMA!|last1=Sugar|first1=Rebecca|date=August 20, 2014|website=[[Reddit]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151111001457/https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2e4gmx/i_am_rebecca_sugar_creator_of_steven_universe_and/cjvykmy|archivedate=November 11, 2015|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
''Steven Universe'', according to Eric Thurm, is a low-key, [[slice of life]] portrayal of childhood, an examination of unconventional family dynamics, a homage to [[anime]], video games and other pop-culture mainstays, and a "straightforward kids' show about superheroes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thurm|first1=Eric|title=Steven Universe: "Lion 2: The Movie"|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/steven-universe-lion-2-movie-203778|date=April 23, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150709164400/http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/steven-universe-lion-2-movie-203778|archivedate=July 9, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jacob Hope Chapman of ''[[Anime News Network]]'' said the anime series ''[[Revolutionary Girl Utena]]'' and ''[[Sailor Moon]]'' are ''Steven Universe''{{'}}s strongest influences visually and structurally, reflected by its "predominantly playful tone, interrupted by crushing drama at key moments", and its "glorification of the strengths of femininity, dilution of gender barriers, and emphasis on a wide variety of relationships between women, aimed at a family audience".&lt;ref name="ANN 31 July 2015"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chapman|first1=Jacob Hope|title=Why Are Anime Fans Obsessed with Steven Universe?|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2015-07-31/why-are-anime-fans-obsessed-with-steven-universe/.91130|work=Anime News Network|date=July 31, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304124437/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2015-07-31/why-are-anime-fans-obsessed-with-steven-universe/.91130|archivedate=March 4, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Steven Universe'' also refers to Japanese cultural icons, including ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'', ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'', ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]'', ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'', [[Studio Ghibli]] movies and [[Junji Ito]]'s horror manga ''[[The Enigma of Amigara Fault]]''.&lt;ref name="ANN 31 July 2015" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hornet.com/stories/the-secret-school-the-alternative-japanese-high-school-world-of-steven-universe/|title=The Secret School: The Alternate Japanese High School World of Steven Universe|date=2016-02-19|work=Hornet Stories|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Whitbrook, the series' "masterful sense of pace" allows it to integrate [[foreshadowing]] and [[worldbuilding]] into scenes, which makes an overarching, dramatic narrative emerge from what might otherwise be "[[Villain of the week|monster of the week]]" episodes.&lt;ref name="io9 16 June 2015" /&gt; The narration of a complex story from a child's perspective means its [[Exposition (narrative)|exposition]] remains "artfully restrained, growing in ambition with the series" and Steven's character.&lt;ref name="Wired 19 February 2015" /&gt; ''Steven Universe''{{'}}s measured pace allows its characters to become "more complex and interesting than most of their counterparts on prestige dramas",&lt;ref name="A.V.

Club 7 May 2014" /&gt; The series explores increasingly-challenging facets of relationships, such as the possibility Pearl may partially resent Steven because he is the reason his mother Rose no longer exists;&lt;ref name="A.V.

Club 15 June 2015" /&gt; Its action scenes—such as Estelle's song presenting the climactic fight in "[[Jail Break (Steven Universe)|Jail Break]]" as a contest between Garnet's loving relationship and Jasper's lone-wolf attitude—are occasionally cast as philosophical arguments.&lt;ref name="A.V. Club 12 March 2015" /&gt;

====Characters====
{{main|List of Steven Universe characters}}
Adams highlighted the "groundbreaking and inventive" portrayal of the complicated "mentor/caregiver/older sibling dynamic" between Steven and the Crystal Gems&lt;ref name="A.V. Club 4 November 2015" /&gt; in a series which, at its core, is about sibling relationships.&lt;ref name="A.V. Club 11 November 2013" /&gt; Thurm wrote that a notable emotional difference between ''Steven Universe'', and ''Adventure Time'' and ''[[Regular Show]]'', is that the latter two series deal with their protagonists' transitions to adulthood whereas during its first season, ''Steven Universe'' was content to be "enamored with the simplicity of childhood".&lt;ref name="A.V. Club 9 April 2014" /&gt; Steven slowly grows from being an obnoxious, tag-along child to an accepted member of the Crystal Gems in his own right by the end of the first season; a change brought about by increased insight and experience rather than age.&lt;ref name="A.V. Club 12 March 2015" /&gt; Joe Cain noted in ''[[The Mary Sue]]'' that unlike heroes from antiquity ([[Hercules]]) and modern fiction ([[Luke Skywalker]]), Steven is defined by his mother's legacy rather than his father's; the preponderance of mother figures in the series underscores their rarity in other fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cain|first1=Joseph|title=Superheroes, Steven Universe, and the Maternal Narrative|url=http://www.themarysue.com/steven-universe-maternal-narrative/|work=The Mary Sue|date=May 13, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160514112356/http://www.themarysue.com/steven-universe-maternal-narrative/|archivedate=May 14, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kat Smalley of [[PopMatters]], the Gems' alien nature, which prevents them from fully understanding the world they protect, is handled with "remarkable depth and intellectual rigor", even as they deal with human issues such as "[[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress]], and self-loathing" remaining from the long-past war for Earth.&lt;ref name="Pop Matters 15 January 2016"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.popmatters.com/feature/steven-universe-cartoon-networks-avant-garde-animation/ |title='Steven Universe': Cartoon Network's Avant-Garde Animation |last=Smalley |first=Kat |date=January 15, 2016 |work=[[Pop Matters]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170906004121/http://www.popmatters.com/feature/steven-universe-cartoon-networks-avant-garde-animation/ |archive-date=September 6, 2017 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smalley characterized ''Steven Universe'' as part of a growing trend of cartoons that appeal to adults and children alike; which includes ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]'' (2005), its sequel ''[[The Legend of Korra]]'' (2012), ''Adventure Time'' (2010) and ''Regular Show'' (2010). This is reflected in the series' outreach to minorities that seldom appear elsewhere in animation and its broader themes; instead of delivering genre-typical, mustache-twirling villains, ''Steven Universe'' "deals with issues of extraordinary violence and horror, depicts its characters in shades of grey, and subtly plays with matters of philosophy, morality, and interpersonal conflicts, all while refusing to reset any development to a ''status quo''".&lt;ref name="Pop Matters 15 January 2016" /&gt;

====Gender and sexuality====

Their past relationship is gradually seen to affect Pearl's relationship with Steven and those around him.]]

"Gender is at the forefront of the conversation surrounding ''Steven Universe''", according to Erik Adams of the ''A.V. Club'', who noted that "the show's superheroes are all women".&lt;ref name="A.V. Club 4 November 2015" /&gt; As a self-aware pastiche of "[[magical girl]]" anime, the series subverts the genre's premises by having Steven embody the loving femininity of the typical magical-girl protagonist without ridicule or losing his masculine side. Whitbrook characterized the series as being "about love—''all'' kinds of love", including non-traditional forms such as the motherly and friendly bond between Steven and the Gems; and Garnet as the "physical embodiment of a lesbian relationship".&lt;ref name="io9 16 June 2015" /&gt;

When placing the series on the honor list of the 2015 [[James Tiptree Jr. Award|Tiptree Award]], which recognizes works of science fiction or fantasy that explore and expand gender roles, the jury wrote; "In the context of children's television, this show deals with gender in a much more open and mature way than is typical for the genre, and has some of the best writing of any cartoon&amp;nbsp;... In addition to showing men and women who do not necessarily conform to standard American gender ideals, the show also gives us an agender/non-binary character and a thoughtful exploration of growing up".&lt;ref name="Tiptree 2016" /&gt;

[[Autostraddle]]'s Mey Rude wrote that ''Steven Universe'' was the most-recent animated series for a younger audience with significant [[queer]] themes, such as the  [[Androgyny|androgynous]] fusion [[Stevonnie]] and the romantic relationship between the Gems Ruby and Sapphire. This, according to Rude, reflects the growing prominence of these themes in children's cartoons; previous depictions were subtextual or minimal, such as the 2011 ''Adventure Time'' episode "[[What Was Missing]]", the 2014 series ''[[Clarence (2014 TV series)|Clarence]]'' or (more explicit but unexplored) the 2014 finale of Nickelodeon's ''[[The Legend of Korra]]''. In ''Steven Universe'', [[LGBT]] themes are prominent as early as the first season's second half.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mey|title="Steven Universe" and the Importance of All-Ages Queer Representation|url=http://www.autostraddle.com/steven-universe-and-the-importance-of-all-ages-queer-representation-281482/|work=[[Autostraddle]]|date=March 13, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150725084959/https://www.autostraddle.com/steven-universe-and-the-importance-of-all-ages-queer-representation-281482/|archivedate=July 25, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fifth season's engagement and wedding between Ruby and Sapphire was reportedly the first [[same-sex marriage]] proposal in an animated series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.teenvogue.com/story/steven-universe-is-reportedly-first-cartoon-to-feature-same-sex-engagement|title="Steven Universe" Just Made Queer History With a Same-Sex Engagement|first=Lauren|last=Rearick|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/tv/2018/07/05/steven-universe-same-sex-marriage-proposal-the-question/|title='Steven Universe' shows a groundbreaking same-sex marriage proposal|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Sugar, her series' LGBT representation is not intended to make a point but to help children understand themselves and develop their identities. In her view, queer youth deserve to see themselves in stories as much as other children—and, given pervasive [[heteronormativity]], not allowing them to do so can be harmful. LGBT children deserve to see the prospect of love for themselves in the characters with whom they identify—the ideal of fulfilling partnership and true love, established as the thing to aspire to by generations of [[Disney cartoons]], extended to all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tremeer|first1=Eleanor|title=Rebecca Sugar Talks LGBT Representation In Steven Universe|url=http://moviepilot.com/posts/3954346|work=[[Moviepilot]]|date=June 7, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609221602/http://moviepilot.com/posts/3954346|archivedate=June 9, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a 2016 panel discussion, Sugar said the LGBT themes in ''Steven Universe'' were also largely based on her own experience as a bisexual woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mey|title=Rebecca Sugar is Bisexual: "Steven Universe" Creator Comes Out at Comic-Con|url=http://www.autostraddle.com/rebecca-sugar-is-bisexual-steven-universe-creator-comes-out-at-comic-con-346094/|work=[[Autostraddle]]|date=July 22, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160724134835/http://www.autostraddle.com/rebecca-sugar-is-bisexual-steven-universe-creator-comes-out-at-comic-con-346094/|archivedate=July 24, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later she said that Fluorite—the fusion of six Gems—represents a [[polyamory|polyamorous]] relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-comic-con-2017-steven-universe-rebecca-sugar-fluorite-1500664224-htmlstory.html |title='Steven Universe's' Rebecca Sugar confirms Fluorite is a representation of a polyamorous relationship |publisher=LA Times |date= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170722075959/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-comic-con-2017-steven-universe-rebecca-sugar-fluorite-1500664224-htmlstory.html |archivedate=July 22, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;In July 2018, she told an interviewer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Johnson |first1=Joshua |title=The Mind Behind America's Most Empathetic Cartoon |url=https://the1a.org/audio/#/shows/2018-07-09/the-mind-behind-americas-most-empathetic-cartoon/114886/ |accessdate=13 July 2018 |work=1A |publisher=NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt; that she created the series's Gems as "[[non-binary]] women" in order to express herself, as a non-binary woman, through them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Pulliam-Moore |first1=Charles |title=Steven Universe's Rebecca Sugar Comes Out as Gender Nonbinary |url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/steven-universes-rebecca-sugar-on-how-she-expresses-her-1827624015 |accessdate=17 July 2018 |work=io9 |date=16 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Music ===
Aivi Tran and Steven "Surasshu" Velema's chiptune-inspired music has also been praised in reviews; Oliver Sava of ''The A.V. Club'' mentioned its range from "peppy retro" to [[Studio Ghibli|Ghibli]]-esque "smooth jazz piano".&lt;ref name="A.V.

The series' music has also been widely praised. "Stronger Than You" has been referred to as a "queer fight song", and the end credits song, "Love Like You", has also been called worthy of being "the latest addition to the [[Great American Songbook]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hornet.com/stories/stronger-than-you/|title=The Heartwarming 'Stronger Than You' Video From 'Steven Universe' Could Be the Next Queer Fight Song|date=2017-07-27|work=Hornet Stories|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hornet.com/stories/best-steven-universe-songs/|title=Still Not Giving Up: 5 More of the Best 'Steven Universe' Songs|date=2017-06-11|work=Hornet Stories|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION BEFORE ESTABLISHING A CONSENSUS VIA THE ARTICLE'S TALK PAGE--&gt; 
''Steven Universe'' has a large, active fandom. Public interest in the series measured by [[Google Trends]] vastly outstripped that of Cartoon Network's other series in April 2016, which ''The A.V. Club'' called "definitive proof that ''Steven Universe'' is now Cartoon Network's flagship series".&lt;ref name="The A.V. Club 20 April 2016" /&gt;

In [[Hinduism]], a '''swami''' ({{Lang-sa|स्वामी}} {{lang|sa-Latn|svāmī}} {{IPA-sa|sʋaːmiː|}}; sometimes abbreviated '''sw.'''), is an [[ascetic]] or [[yogi]] who has been initiated into a religious [[monastic order]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=E. Cobham |last1=Brewer |author-link=E. Cobham Brewer |editor-first=Camilla |editor-last=Rockwood |ISBN=9780550104113 |at="Swami" entry |title=Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable |location=London |publisher=Chambers Harrap |date=2009 |OL=2527037W}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning of the Sanskrit root of the word is '[he who is] one with his [[Philosophy of self#Self in Eastern traditions|self]]' ({{lang|sa-Latn|swa}} stands for 'self').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Yogananda |first=Paramhamsa |date=1997 |title=Autobiography of a Yogi |location=Mumbai |publisher=Jaico Publishing House |p=14}}{{unreliable source|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is applied to religious [[guru]]s as well as yogis, with or without [[wikt:disciple|disciple]]s.  The term is also used in [[Advaita Vedanta]].{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} As a direct form of address, or as a stand-in for a swami's name, it is often rendered ''[[Swamiji (disambiguation)|Swamiji]]'' (also ''Swami-ji'' or ''Swami Ji'').

The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' gives the etymology as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://oed.com/view/Entry/195404?rskey=Cbewbm&amp;result=1 |title=swami |work=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |edition=online |date=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |access-date=31 August 2011 |url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|[[Hindi]] {{lang|hi|svāmī}} 'master, lord, prince', used by Hindus as a term of respectful address, &amp;lt; Sanskrit {{lang|sa-Latn|svāmin}} in same senses, also the idol or temple of a god.}}

In [[Bengali language|Bengali]], the word (pronounced {{IPA-bn|ˈʃami|}}), while carrying its original meaning, also has the meaning of '[[husband]]' in another context. The word also means 'husband' in [[Malay language|Malay]], in which it is spelled {{lang|ms|suami}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Istilah Malaysia |url= http://prpm.dbp.gov.my/Search.aspx?k=suami |work=Pusat Rujukan Persuratan Melayu |publisher=Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka Malaysia |access-date=31 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Khmer language|Khmer]] and [[Odiya language|Odiya]]. The [[Thai language|Thai]] word for 'husband', {{lang|th-Latn|sami}} ({{lang|th|สามี}}), like the [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]] word for 'spouse', {{lang|tl|asawa}}, are also [[cognate]]s of the word.

"'''The Deprogrammers'''" is an episode of ''[[The Outer Limits (1995 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'' television series. It first aired on 26 May 1996, during the second season.

==Introduction==
In the near future, Earth is under [[Alien invasion|alien occupation]] by a race of reptilian aliens, the Torkor. For two years the human race has been conditioned for slavery, unable to think for itself or disobey an order. One human, the slave of an important ruler, is captured by a small band of rebel humans who try to break the conditioning and restore his [[free will]].

==Opening narration==
{{cquote|''At what point does a human being's free will cease to exist? And if we have forfeited our free will... are we still human?''}}

==Plot==
In the near future, where a race of unnamed scaly aliens have taken over Earth, Evan ([[Erich Anderson]]) is a slave in the mansion of the harsh-ruling Koltak ([[Vincent Hammond]]) who he refers to as "[[Milord]]". Like all other slaves ("Jollem"), he has been "programmed" to not feel anything, and to take everything his master says as fact without question.

Later, Evan is captured by a resistance movement led by Professor Trent Davis ([[Brent Spiner]]), who call themselves the Vindicators, or the [[Deprogramming|Deprogrammers]]. At first, he is completely [[Vegetative state|vegetative]] towards them. Not even pain or having Trent cutting his wrist will make him flinch.

But during the course of days, little by little, the resistance manages to wake up the parts of his mind that have been silenced by the programming. He is slowly introduced to his past life, a successful military career, and to his wife Jill ([[Nicole Oliver]]), who is also working with the resistance movement.

The resistance aims to restore the meaning of what it means to be a human, by the means of military power. Finally, when Evan comes to realize that his master is actually responsible for killing all the children of the world, including his daughter, he becomes apparently sympathetic to the goals of the vindicators, despite occasional quirks in his thinking.

Evan returns to Koltak's mansion, bringing with him a vial that is camouflaged as a vial of Seragon Oil, a substance Koltak is particularly fond of. He drops the vial into the bath the alien is taking, and combines it with another substance, making the bath become solid, trapping the alien there. Evan beats Koltak to death, and then returns to the place of the Vindicators, carrying the head of the alien with him in a bag.

At the moment of joy and success, Trent Davis asks if "Milord" is pleased, after which another alien steps in, whom Davis recognizes as Megwon ([[Vincent Hammond]]). Davis had been a Jollem all along, but was spared from the reprogramming so that he can continue with his experiments. Megwon had used Evan as a pawn to kill his rival. Megwon says the resistance is small and at the moment will not be a threat to him.

In the final scene, Evan is being reprogrammed again along with Jill....though Jill seems to resist programming.

'''''The Exorcist''''' is an American [[horror film|horror]] [[Media franchise|franchise]] consisting of five installments based on the novel ''[[The Exorcist (novel)|The Exorcist]]'', created by [[William Blatty]], and part of [[The Exorcist]] franchise. The films have been distributed by [[Warner Bros.]] and [[20th Century Fox]].

The films have grossed over [[United States dollar|$]]661 million at the worldwide box office. Critics have given the films mixed reviews. In 2004, a prequel (''[[Exorcist: The Beginning]]'') was released. This was the second version of the prequel film made at that time as the first version (directed by [[Paul Schrader]]) was deemed unsatisfactory by the studio upon completion, and the entire project was refilmed by director [[Renny Harlin]]. However, Schrader's version received a limited release in 2005, after Harlin's, and was titled ''[[Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist]]''.     On January 22, 2016, [[20th Century Fox Television]] announced they were developing a [[The Exorcist (TV series)|television series]] of ''The Exorcist''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=‘The Exorcist’ Pilot Ordered at Fox with Modern Twist|url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/the-exorcist-tv-series-pilot-fox-1201686653/|last=Prudom|first=Laura|website=Variety.com|accessdate=February 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It premiered on September 23, 2016.

===''The Exorcist''===
{{Main|The Exorcist (film)}}
Based on the 1971 novel by [[William Peter Blatty]], ''The Exorcist'' marries three scenarios into one plot.

The film opens with Father Merrin ([[Max von Sydow]]) on an archaeological dig in [[Hatra|Al-hadar]], near [[Nineveh]], in [[Iraq]]. He is alerted that a small carving is found in the dig, resembling a grimacing, bestial creature. After talking to one of his supervisors, he travels to a statue of [[Pazuzu (The Exorcist)|Pazuzu]]; the small carving resembles the head of the statue. He sees ominous figures and two dogs fight viciously nearby, setting the tone for the rest of the film.

===''Exorcist II: The Heretic''===
{{Main|Exorcist II: The Heretic}}
Father Philip Lamont ([[Richard Burton]]), who is struggling with his faith, is assigned by the [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] ([[Paul Henreid]]) to investigate the death of Father Lankester Merrin ([[Max von Sydow]]). Merrin was killed in the first film during the exorcism of [[Regan MacNeil]] ([[Linda Blair]]). The Cardinal informs Lamont (who has had some experience at exorcism, and has been exposed to Merrin's teachings) that Merrin is being investigated posthumously for heresy. Despite approval of the MacNeil exorcism by a bishop, the Church is no longer convinced that MacNeil was truly possessed, and the controversial nature of Merrin's books on the subject are being reconsidered as politically and theologically suspect.

===''The Exorcist III''===
{{Main|The Exorcist III}}
[[Film adaptation|Adapted]] and directed by Blatty from his 1983 novel ''[[Legion (Blatty novel)|Legion]]'', the film stars [[George C. Scott]] and several cast members ([[Jason Miller (playwright)|Jason Miller]], [[Ed Flanders]], [[Scott Wilson (actor)|Scott Wilson]] and [[George DiCenzo]]) from Blatty's previous film ''[[The Ninth Configuration]]''. The story takes place 17 years after the events of ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' and centers on the philosophical police detective William F. Kinderman from the first film. He investigates a series of brutal murders in [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.|Georgetown]] that resemble the ''[[modus operandi]]'' of a serial killer executed about the time of the MacNeil exorcism.

Originally titled '''''Legion''''', the film was drastically changed after rewrites and re-shoots ordered by the studio [[Morgan Creek Productions]].&lt;ref name="A Legion of Interference"&gt;''Fangoria'' #122 (May 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; Studio executives demanded the addition of an exorcism sequence, and retitled the film as ''The Exorcist III'' in order to more strongly tie the film to the rest of the franchise. All of the deleted footage is apparently lost.&lt;ref name="tncf"&gt;http://www.theninthconfiguration.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Exorcist: The Beginning''===
{{Main|Exorcist: The Beginning}}
The plot revolves around the crisis of faith suffered by [[Lankester Merrin|Father Merrin]] (Stellan Skarsgård) following the horrific events he witnessed during [[World War II]].

After WWII, Merrin is an [[archaeologist]] in [[Cairo]], when he is approached by a collector of antiquities who asks him to come to a British excavation in the Turkana region of [[Kenya]]. This dig is excavating a [[Christian]] [[Byzantine]] [[Church (building)|church]] from the 5th century—long before Christianity had reached that region. Further, the church is in perfect condition, as though it had been buried immediately after the construction was completed.  Merrin is asked to participate in the dig and find an ancient relic hidden in the ruins before the British do.  Merrin takes the job, but soon discovers that all is not well—something evil lies in the church and is infecting the region.  The local tribesman hired to dig refuse to enter the building, and there are stories of an epidemic that wiped out an entire village.  However, when Merrin, growing suspicious of these rumors, digs up one of the graves of the supposed victims of this plague, he discovers it is empty.  Meanwhile, the evil grows, turning people against each other and resulting in violence, atrocities, and more bloodshed.

===''Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist''===
{{Main|Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist}}
Many years before the events in ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'', the young Father Lankester Merrin (played by Skarsgård, who played the same part in the ''[[Exorcist: The Beginning]]'') travels to [[East Africa]]. Merrin has taken a sabbatical from the Church and devoted himself to history and archaeology as he struggles with his shattered faith. He is haunted especially by an incident in small village in occupied Holland during [[World War II]], where he served as parish priest. Near the end of the war, a sadistic Nazi SS commander, in retaliation for the murder of a German trooper, forces Merrin to participate in arbitrary executions in order to save a full village from slaughter.

He meets up with a team of archaeologists, who are seeking to unearth a church that they believe has been buried for centuries. At first, Merrin resists the idea that supernatural forces are in play, but eventually helps them, and the ensuing events result in an encounter with [[Pazuzu (The Exorcist)|Pazuzu]], the same demon referenced in ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]''.

==Cut scenes==

===The "spider-walk scene"===
[[Contortionist]] Linda R. Hager was hired to perform the infamous "spider-walk scene" that was filmed on April 11, 1973. Friedkin deleted the scene just prior to the original December 26, 1973 release date because he felt it was ineffective technically. However, with advanced developments in digital media technology, Friedkin worked with [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] artists to make the scene look more convincing for the 2000 theatrically re-released version of ''The Exorcist: The Version You've Never Seen''. Since the original release, myths and rumors still exist that a variety of spider-walk scenes were filmed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://captainhowdy.com/?page_id=38&amp;xdforum_action=viewthread&amp;xf_id=1&amp;xt_id=888&amp;pstart=0# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-09-05 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120707002215/http://captainhowdy.com/?page_id=38&amp;xdforum_action=viewthread&amp;xf_id=1&amp;xt_id=888&amp;pstart=0# |archive-date=2012-07-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; despite Friedkin's insistence that no alternate version was ever shot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pages.zoom.co.uk/the.exorcist/Html/friedkin_faqs.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427112721/http://pages.zoom.co.uk/the.exorcist/Html/friedkin_faqs.htm |archivedate=2009-04-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Warner Brothers re-released the [[digitally remastered]] DVD of ''The Exorcist: 25th Anniversary Special Edition''. This DVD includes the special feature BBC documentary, ''The Fear of God: The Making of The Exorcist,''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timewarner.com/corp/newsroom/pr/0,20812,666953,00.html Collectors' Tribute to the Film that Frightened the World!!! The Exorcist 25th Anniversary Special Edition]&lt;/ref&gt; highlighting the never-before-seen original non-bloody version of the spider-walk scene. The updated "bloody version" of the spider-walk scene appears in the 2000 re-release of ''The Exorcist: The Version You've Never Seen'' utilizing CGI technology to incorporate the special effect of blood pouring from Regan's mouth during this scene’s finale.

===''The Exorcist III''===

Despite his misgivings about the studio-imposed reshoots, Blatty is proud of the finished version of ''The Exorcist III'', having said, “It’s still a superior film. And in my opinion, and excuse me if I utter heresy here, but for me it’s a more frightening film than ''The Exorcist''."&lt;ref name="TEOTS"&gt;''The Exorcist: Out of the Shadows'' (Omnibus Press, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Blatty had hoped to recover the deleted footage from the Morgan Creek vaults so that he might re-assemble the original cut of the film which he said was "rather different" from what was released, and a version of the film fans of the ''Exorcist'' series have been clamouring for. In 2007, Blatty's wife reported on a [[fan site]] that "My husband tells me that it is Morgan Creek's claim that they have lost all the footage, including an alternate opening scene in which Kinderman views the body of Karras in the morgue, right after his fall down the steps." Mark Kermode has stated that the search for the missing footage is "ongoing".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/markkermode/2009/01/more_points_of_you_part_two.html&lt;/ref&gt;

An upcoming book titled ''The Evolution Of William Peter Blatty's The Exorcist III: From Concept To Novel To Screen'' by author Erik Kristopher Myers will reveal the whole story behind the film's development, and publish never-before-seen images, the original script, studio notes, various drafts of the story as it has evolved, and interviews with Blatty, Brad Dourif, Mark Kermode, John Carpenter, and many others associated with the film.&lt;ref name="tncf"/&gt; Myers in an interview said that ''The Exorcist III'' "has sort of turned into horror genre’s equivalent to [[Orson Welles]]' ''[[The Magnificent Ambersons]]'', in that it was originally a very classy film that the studio hacked apart and turned into a commercial piece [...] I'm basically trying to chronicle how a film can get away from the auteur and be transformed into a purely commercial product." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cincity2000.com/content/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1546&amp;Itemid=2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708154034/http://www.cincity2000.com/content/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1546&amp;Itemid=2 |archivedate=2011-07-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

Upon its release on December 26, 1973, the film received mixed reviews from critics, “ranging from ‘classic’ to ‘claptrap'."&lt;ref name="Travers"&gt;Travers, Peter and Rieff, Stephanie. ''The Story Behind ‘The Exorcist’'', Pg. 149, Signet Books, 1974. {{ISBN|978-0-451-06207-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stanley Kauffmann]], in ''[[The New Republic]]'', wrote, “This is the most scary film I’ve seen in years — the ''only'' scary film I’ve seen in years…If you want to be shaken — and I found out, while the picture was going, that that’s what I wanted — then ''The Exorcist'' will scare the hell out of you.”&lt;ref name="Kauffmann"&gt;Kauffmann, Stanley. ''New Republic'' review reprinted in ''The Story Behind ‘The Exorcist’'', written by Peter Travers and Stephanie Rieff, pgs. 152 - 154, Signet Books, 1974. {{ISBN|978-0-451-06207-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' noted that it was “an expert telling of a supernatural horror story…The climactic sequences assault the senses and the intellect with pure cinematic terror.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117790769.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1&amp;query=The+Exorcist |title=The Exorcist|accessdate=2007-11-03|first=|last=|work=Variety | date=January 1, 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''[[Castle of Frankenstein]]'', [[Joe Dante]] opined, “[A]n amazing film, and one destined to become at the very least a horror classic.  Director William Friedkin’s film will be profoundly disturbing to all audiences, especially the more sensitive and those who tend to 'live' the movies they see…Suffice it to say, there has never been anything like this on the screen before.”&lt;ref name="Dante"&gt;Dante, Joe.  ''Castle of Frankenstein'', Vol 6, No. 2 (Whole Issue #22), pgs. 32-33. Review of ''The Exorcist''&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[Vincent Canby]], writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'', dismissed ''The Exorcist'' as “a chunk of elegant occultist claptrap…[A] practically impossible film to sit through…it establishes a new low for grotesque special effects...”&lt;ref name="Canby"&gt;Canby, Vincent.  ''The New York Times'' review reprinted in ''The Story Behind ‘The Exorcist’'', written by Peter Travers and Stephanie Rieff, pgs. 150 - 152, Signet Books, 1974. {{ISBN|978-0-451-06207-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrew Sarris]] complained that “Friedkin’s biggest weakness is his inability to provide enough visual information about his characters…whole passages of the movie’s exposition were one long buzz of small talk and name droppings…''The Exorcist'' succeeds on one level as an effectively excruciating entertainment, but on another, deeper level it is a thoroughly evil film.”&lt;ref name="Sarris"&gt;Sarris, Andrew. ''[[Village Voice]]'' review reprinted in ''The Story Behind ‘The Exorcist’'', written by Peter Travers and Stephanie Rieff, pgs. 154–158, Signet Books, 1974. {{ISBN|978-0-451-06207-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Writing in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', [[Jon Landau]] felt the film was, “[N]othing more than a religious porn film, the gaudiest piece of shlock this side of [[Cecil B. DeMille]] (minus that gentleman’s wit and ability to tell a story) …”&lt;ref name="Landau"&gt;Landau, Jon. ''Rolling Stone'' review reprinted in ''The Story Behind ‘The Exorcist’'', written by Peter Travers and Stephanie Rieff, pgs. 158 - 162, Signet Books, 1974. {{ISBN|978-0-451-06207-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, ''The Exorcist''{{’}}s critical reputation has grown considerably. The film currently has an 85% "Certified Fresh" approval rating on the [[Rotten Tomatoes]] website, based on 40 reviews the website collected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/exorcist/ |title=''The Exorcist" (1973)|accessdate=2007-11-03|first=|last=|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some critics regard it as being one of the best and most effective [[horror film]]s; admirers say the film balances a stellar script, gruesome effects, and outstanding performances. However, the movie has its detractors as well, including [[Kim Newman]] who has criticized it for messy plot construction, conventionality and overblown pretentiousness, among other perceived defects. Writer [[James Baldwin (writer)|James Baldwin]] provides an extended negative critique in his book length essay ''[[The Devil Finds Work]]''.

'''II:''' Stephen H. Scheuer wrote that ''Exorcist II'' “may just well be the worst sequel in the history of films – a stupefying, boring, vapid and ''non-scary'' follow-up to the box-office champ of 1973...''Exorcist II'' is a disaster on every level – a sophomoric script, terrible editing, worst direction by John Boorman, inevitably coupled with silly acting. In one scene that typifies this lamentable sci-fi horror pic, [Richard] Burton and [James Earl] Jones, two splendid actors, are spouting inane dialogue while Jones is outfitted like a witch doctor.”&lt;ref&gt;Steven H. Scheuer, ''Movies on TV'' (Bantam Books, 1977), p.224&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leslie Halliwell]] described the film as a “highly unsatisfactory psychic melodrama which...falls flat on its face along some wayward path of metaphysical and religious fancy. It was released in two versions and is unintelligible in either.”&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Halliwell, ''Halliwell’s Film Guide: Fifth Edition'' (HarperCollins, 1995), p.370&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leonard Maltin]] described the film as a “preposterous sequel...Special effects are the only virtue in this turkey.”&lt;ref&gt;Leonard Maltin, ''Leonard Maltin’s 2009 Movie Guide'' (Plume, 2008) p.427&lt;/ref&gt; [[Danny Peary]] dismissed  ''Exorcist II'' as “absurd.”&lt;ref&gt;Danny Peary, ''Guide for the Film Fanatic'' (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1986) p.143&lt;/ref&gt;

While most reviewers responded negatively to the film, [[Pauline Kael]] greatly preferred Boorman's sequel to the original, writing in her review in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' that ''Exorcist II'' "had more visual magic than a dozen movies." Since ''Exorcist II's'' initial release, some notable critics and directors have praised the film. [[Kim Newman]] wrote in ''Nightmare Movies'' (1988) that "it doesn't work in all sorts of ways... However, like [[Ennio Morricone|Ennio Morricone's]] mix of tribal and liturgical music, it does manage to be very interesting." Director [[Martin Scorsese]] asserted, "The picture asks: Does great goodness bring upon itself great evil? This goes back to the [[Book of Job]]; it's God testing the good. In this sense, Regan ([[Linda Blair]]) is a modern-day saint — like [[Ingrid Bergman]] in ''[[Europa '51]]'', and in a way, like Charlie in ''[[Mean Streets]]''. I like the first ''Exorcist'', because of the [[Catholic guilt]] I have, and because it scared the hell out of me; but ''The Heretic'' surpasses it. Maybe Boorman failed to execute the material, but the movie still deserved better than it got."&lt;ref name="Scorsese"&gt;Scorsese, Martin. "Martin Scorsese´s Guility Pleasures", ''[[Film Comment]]'', September/October 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

Author Bob McCabe's book ''The Exorcist: Out of the Shadows'' contains a chapter on the film in which Linda Blair said the movie "was one of the big disappointments of my career,"&lt;ref name="Linda Blair 1999 p.165"&gt;Linda Blair, cited in Bob McCabe, ‘’The Exorcist: Out of the Shadows’’ (Omnibus Press, 1999), p.165&lt;/ref&gt; and John Boorman confessed that “The sin I committed was not giving the audience what it wanted in terms of horror...There’s this wild beast out there which is the audience. I created this arena and I just didn’t throw enough Christians into it. People think of cutting and re-cutting as defeat, but it isn’t. As Irving Thalberg said: ‘Films aren’t made, they’re remade.’”&lt;ref&gt;John Boorman, cited in Bob McCabe, ''The Exorcist: Out of the Shadows'' (Omnibus Press, 1999), p.164&lt;/ref&gt; McCabe himself offered no one answer as to why ''Exorcist II'' failed: "Who knows where the blame ultimately lies. Boorman's illness and constant revising of the script can't have helped, but these events alone are not enough to explain the film's almighty failure. Boorman has certainly gone on to produce some fine work subsequently...When a list was compiled to find the fifty worst films of all time, ''Exorcist II: The Heretic'' came in at number two. It was beaten only by [[Ed Wood]]'s ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]'', a film that generally receives a warmer response from its audience than this terribly misjudged sequel."&lt;ref&gt;Bob McCabe, ‘’The Exorcist: Out of the Shadows’’ (Omnibus Press, 1999), p.165&lt;/ref&gt;

'''III:''' The film met with mixed reviews. ''[[The New York Times]]'' reviewer Vincent Canby said "''The Exorcist III'' is a better and funnier (intentionally) movie than either of its predecessors".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C0CE2D81339F93BA2575BC0A966958260 | archive-url=https://archive.is/20120630054513/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C0CE2D81339F93BA2575BC0A966958260 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=June 30, 2012 | work=The New York Times | first=Vincent | last=Canby | title=Review/Film; Leaving the Devil Out in the Cold | date=August 18, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; and British film critic [[Mark Kermode]] called it "a restrained, haunting chiller which stimulates the adrenalin and intellect alike."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/64113/the-exorcist-iii.html&lt;/ref&gt; However Owen Gleiberman of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave a negative review, stating "If Part II sequels are generally disappointing, Part IIIs are often much, much worse. It can seem as if nothing is going on in them except dim murmurings about the original movie—murmurings that mostly remind you of what isn't being delivered." Gleiberman called ''The Exorcist III'' "an ash-gray disaster" and that it "has the feel of a nightmare catechism lesson, or a horror movie made by a depressed monk.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,318049,00.html | work=Entertainment Weekly | title=Movie Review: The Exorcist III}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kim Newman]] claimed that "The major fault in ''Exorcist III'' is the house-of-cards plot that is constantly collapsing."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=2881&lt;/ref&gt; Kevin Thomas of ''Los Angeles Times'' gave a mixed review, saying ''Exorcist III'' "doesn't completely work but offers much more than countless, less ambitious films."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-08-20/entertainment/ca-827_1_exorcist-iii | work=Los Angeles Times | title=Movie Reviews | first=Kevin | last=Thomas | date=August 20, 1990 | accessdate=May 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ticuna''', or '''Tikuna''', is a language spoken by approximately 50,000 people in [[Brazil]], [[Peru]], and [[Colombia]]. It is the native language of the [[Ticuna people]]. Ticuna is generally classified as a [[language isolate]], but may be related to the extinct [[Yuri language (Amazon)|Yuri language]] (see [[Ticuna-Yuri languages|Tïcuna-Yuri]]) and there has been some research indicating similarities between Ticuna and [[Carabayo language|Carabayo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.plos.org/everyone/2014/04/28/linking-isolated-languages-linguistic-relationships-carabayo/|title=Linking Isolated Languages: Linguistic Relationships of the Carabayo|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seifart|first=Frank|last2=Echeverri|first2=Juan Alvaro|date=2014-04-16|title=Evidence for the Identification of Carabayo, the Language of an Uncontacted People of the Colombian Amazon, as Belonging to the Tikuna-Yurí Linguistic Family|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0094814|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=9|issue=4|pages=e94814|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0094814|issn=1932-6203|pmc=3989239|pmid=24739948}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a tonal language, and therefore the meaning of words with the same phonemes can vary greatly simply by changing the tone used to pronounce them.

Tïcuna is also known as Magta, Maguta, Tucuna/Tukuna, and Tukna.

=== Brazil ===
Despite being home to more than 50% of the Ticunas, Brazil has only recently started to invest in native language education. Brazilian Ticunas now have a written literature and an education provided by the Brazilian [[Fundação Nacional do Índio|National Foundation for the Indian]] (FUNAI) and the [[Ministry of Education (Brazil)|Ministry of Education]]. Textbooks in Ticuna are used by native teachers trained in both Portuguese and Ticuna to teach the language to the children. A large-scale project has been recording traditional narrations and writing them down to provide the literate Ticunas with some literature to practice with.

Ticuna education is not a privilege, but part of a wider project carried on by the Brazilian government to provide all significant minorities with education in their own language.

In 2012, the Brazilian government launched an educational campaign for the prevention of [[Prevention of HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] and [[violence against women]], the first such campaign in Brazil ever conducted in an indigenous language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Peru ===
Ticunas in Peru have had native language education at least since the 1960s. They use a writing system that was, apparently, the base for the development of the Brazilian one. However, much of the literature available to Peruvian Ticunas comprise standard textbooks.

=== Colombia ===
Colombian Ticunas are taught in Spanish, when they have access to school at all. Since the establishment of Ticuna schools in Brazil some have ventured to attend them {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}.

=== Christian Ministries ===
A number of Christian ministries have reached the Ticuna people. These ministries have translated the bible into the native Ticuna language and even have a weekday radio show that is broadcast in Ticuna, Portuguese, and Spanish by the Latin American Ministries (LAM).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latinamericanministries.net/ticuna/ucb-lam|title=Latin American Ministries - Project Ticuna|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Literacy ==
Besides its use at the Ticuna schools, the language has a dozen books published every year, both in Brazil and Peru. Those books employ a specially devised phonetic writing system using conventions similar to those found in Portuguese (except for K instead of C and the letter Ñ instead of NH) instead of the more complex scientific notation found, for instance, at the [[Language Museum]].

In school Ticuna is taught formally. Children in schools typically in areas of Catholic Missionaries are also taught either Portuguese or Spanish as well.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://xapiri.com/pages/ticuna|title=Ticuna Indigenous Trive in Brazil and Colombia|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Linguistic structure ==
Ticuna is a fairly [[Analytic language|isolating]] language morphologically, meaning that most words consist of just one morpheme. However, Ticuna words usually have more than one syllable, unlike isolating languages such as [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]. Ticuna is an unusually tonal language for South America, with five [[level tone]]s and four [[contour tone]]s. Tones are only indicated orthographically, with diacritics, when confusion is likely. The six vowels may be nasal or laryngealized; consonants may also be glottalized. Glottal stop is spelled ''x'', and the sixth vowel ''ü''. Typologically, Ticuna word order is [[subject–verb–object]] (SVO), though unusually this can vary within the language.

Research has indicated isolated tonal languages with complex tones are more likely to occur in regions of higher humidity and higher mean average temperature because it is believed the vocal folds can produce less consistent tones in colder, drier air. Ticuna was one of the languages of focus in this study due to its prevalence—and complexity—of tones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Everett et al|first=Caleb|date=February 3, 2015|title=Climate, vocal folds, and tonal languages: Connecting the physiological and geographic dots|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2e12/d83c392363ff56741da344ea60a3a34ff4fe.pdf|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1073/pnas.1417413112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Classification ===
Some have tentatively associated the Ticuna language within the [[Macro-Arawakan languages|macro-arawakano]] or with [[Macro-Tucanoan|macro-tukano]], although most experts consider that this classification is highly speculative, given the lack of evidence. Recently a new and promising hypothesis has linked Yuri-Ticuna with the [[Saliban languages|Saliban]] and [[Hoti language|Hoti]] languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite |last=Jolkesky|first=Marcelo|date=2016|title=Estudo arqueo-ecolinguístico das terras tropicais sul-americanas.|publisher= Brasilia: UnB. PhD Dissertation. |url=https://www.academia.edu/27105400/}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, some linguists maintain that Ticuna is actually an [[isolated language]].

===Phonology===
Vowels qualities are {{IPA|/a e i ɨ u o/}}. There are diphthongs {{IPA|/ai̯/}} and {{IPA|/au̯/}} that carry a single tone, contrasting with vowel sequences {{IPA|/ai/}} and {{IPA|/au/}} that carry two tones. There are no long vowels, but instead sequences of identical vowels (such as ''aa'') that carry two tones. Vowels may be nasalized or "laryngealized" ([[creaky voice]]d? the tones are lowered) or both.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Anderson, Doris, ''Conversational Ticuna'', Summer Institute of Linguistics, 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

The counting words in Ticuna imply a base five system of counting as the word for five is the combination of "one five". Six through nine all contain the same beginning "naixmixwa rü" and then append the values for one through four respectively (such that six is "naixmixwa rü" and "wüxi" meaning one).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Waaq''' (also '''Waq''' or '''Waaqa''') is the name of [[God]] in the [[Traditional African religions|traditional religion]] of many [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]] people in the [[Horn of Africa]].&lt;ref name="Abdullahi"&gt;Mohamed Diriye Abdullahi, ''Culture and Customs of Somalia'', (Greenwood Publishing Group: 2001), p.65.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
In [[Oromo people|Oromo]] culture, ''Waaq'' or ''Waaqo'' denotes the single god of the early [[Monotheism|monotheistic]] faith believed to have been adhered to by Cushitic groups. This belief system still somewhat exists in some Oromo societies.&lt;ref name="Abdullahi"/&gt;

With regard to the [[Muslim]] [[Somalis]], since no indigenous spiritual group has survived, no ancient deities and spirits are known. Early beliefs can therefore only be hypothesized from certain customs and words, such as ''waaq'' (sky-god), an archaic Somali term for god.

Also in [[Somalia]] there are many clans and places called Waaq; such as [[El Wak, Somalia|Ceel Waaq]], which mean "the well of God" and [[Abudwak|Caabud Waaq]], which mean "where God is worshiped". Some Somali clans still have Waaq names like [[Jidwaq (clan)|Jid Waaq]] clan. Also there are many [[Somali language]] uses of Waaq name, like [[Barwaaqo|BarWaaqo]], which mean "when the land is filled with grass and water".&lt;ref name="Abdullahi"/&gt;

The '''Yoruba tribal marks''' are [[scarification]]s which are specific identification and beautification marks designed on the face or body of the [[Yoruba people]]. The tribal marks are part of the [[Yoruba culture]] and are usually inscribed on the body by burning or cutting of the [[skin]] during childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lefèber|first1=Yvonne|author2=Henk W. A. Voorhoeve|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7Y0bCWpg-U8C&amp;pg=PA53|page=53|title=Indigenous Customs in Childbirth and Child Care|publisher=Guinevere Van Gorcum|year=1998|isbn=9023233662}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The primary function of the tribal marks is for identification of a person's tribe, family or [[patrilineal]] heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Orie (2011), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanguardngr.com/2014/10/marked-life-tribal-marks-attractive-repulsive/|publisher=[[Vanguard News]]|title=Marked for life? Are your tribal marks attractive or repulsive?|author=Chioma, Gabriel|date=18 October 2014|accessdate=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other secondary functions of the marks are symbols of beauty, Yoruba creativity and keeping mischievous children alive (ila Abiku). This practice was popular among Yoruba people of [[Nigeria]], [[Benin]], and [[Togo]]. During the [[Atlantic slave trade|trans-Atlantic slave trade]], tribal identification and facial stripes became important.&lt;ref&gt;Odunbaku (2012), p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some repatriated slaves later reunited with their communities by looking at facial stripes.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

However, the use of tribal marks is fading in Yoruba land.

==Background==
In traditional Yoruba societies, every child is born into a patrilineal clan called idile baba in Yoruba language. The clan share clan names (orile), oriki (poetry), taboos (eewo) and facial marks (ila). The facial marks on the child assigns the child full clan membership rights. The children with facial marks are called Okola. Families or individuals lacking the normal features consistent with the tribe are not considered as acquiring full standing as agents in Yoruba society. They would also lack the capacity for meaningful behavior, such as greeting, stating and commanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bello|first=Abiodun|url=http://newtelegraphonline.com/tribal-marks-a-peoples-identity/|title=Tribal marks, a people's identity|publisher=[[New Telegraph]]|date=10 February 2015|accessdate=19 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150522014534/http://newtelegraphonline.com/tribal-marks-a-peoples-identity/|archivedate=22 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Each [[List of tribes in Nigeria|tribe]] of the [[History of the Yoruba people|Yoruba ethnic group]] had different inscription patterns which appears in different sizes and shapes at different locations within the face or body. The location and position of the mark's inscription depends on the tribe and culture.&lt;ref name="book 1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ember|first1=Melvin|last2=Ember|first2=Carol R.|title=Encyclopedia of Medical Anthropology|year=2004|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|volume=1 (cultures)|isbn=0306477548|page=1032|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nrMRezmNrPcC&amp;pg=PA1032}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tribal marks could be inscribed on the breast, arm, lap or buttocks, but they are usually on the face.&lt;ref name="The Punch 1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Famutimi|first=Temitayo|title=Civilisation pushes tribal mark makers out of job|url=http://www.punchng.com/special-feature/civilisation-pushes-tribal-mark-makers-out-of-job/|publisher=[[The Punch]]|date=24 December 2014|accessdate=19 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150521044753/http://www.punchng.com/special-feature/civilisation-pushes-tribal-mark-makers-out-of-job/|archivedate=21 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
[[File:Facialmarks2.jpg|thumb|Facial marks]]

===Pele===
The Pele style is three longitudinal lines, inscribed on the cheeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://realnewsmagazine.net/lifestyle/killed-by-modernity/|title=Killed by modernity|work=realnewsmagazine.net|accessdate=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Odunbaku (2012), p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pele have different variants. The variants includes; ''Pele Ife'', a three longitudinal line inscribed on the cheek. It is peculiar to the [[Ile Ife|Ile Ife people]]. ''Pele Ijebu'' and ''Pele Ijesha'' are other variants of Pele. Both variants are three short longitudinal lines inscribed on the cheeks.&lt;ref name="D.Adeleke2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Abraham Ajibade Adeleke Ph.

===Owu===
Owu tribal marks consist of six incisions on each side of the cheeks and peculiar to the indigenes of Owu, an historical city in [[Abeokuta]], the capital of [[Ogun State, Nigeria]]. The Owu tribal mark was inscribed on the cheeks of [[Tribal chief|Chief]] [[Olusegun Obasanjo]], the former President of the [[Nigeria|Federal Republic of Nigeria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thenationonlineng.net/tribal-marks-my-id-card-obasanjo/|title=Tribal marks my ID card - Obasanjo|work=|accessdate=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gọmbọ===
The Gọmbọ style, also known as  Kẹkẹ, consists of multiple straight and curved lines about a half of an inch apart inscribed on the cheeks on both sides of the mouth.  Indigenes of [[Ogbomosho]] in [[Oyo State]] are usually identified by the Gombo or Kẹkẹ style of Yoruba tribal marks.

===Abaja===
Abaja can be both a basic and also a complex style. In its basic form, it is either three or four horizontal stripes on the cheeks. 
The Abaja style also consists of twelve horizontal lines, six lines per cheek. It is often referred to as "Abaja Alaafin Mefa Mefa". This tribal mark is unique to the indigenes of [[Oyo, Nigeria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=T5v11UywUbwC&amp;pg=PT198|title=Yoruba Traditions and African American Religious Nationalism|publisher=UNM Press|first=Tracey E.|last=Hucks|isbn=0826350771}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of tribal marks today==
The use of tribal marks as a means of identification and beautification among the Yoruba tribe is no longer a norm and some Yoruba states have enacted certain laws that prohibit the use of the marks. Violators of the law are liable to fines or imprisonment (or both).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|pages=86|author1=Falola, Toyin  |author2=Ngom, Fallou |lastauthoramp=yes |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3YKMAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA86|title=Facts, Fiction, and African Creative Imaginations|publisher=Routledge|year=2009|isbn=1135212899}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Oyo State]], for example, the prohibition of tribal marks is an integral part of the state [[Children's rights movement|Child Rights Law]], a law that imposes a fine or one-month imprisonment or both for violation.&lt;ref name="Star Africa"&gt;{{cite news|last1=[[Apa, Nigeria|Apa]]|title=The kick against aged tribal marks in Nigeria|url=http://en.starafrica.com/news/the-kick-against-aged-tribal-marks-in-nigeria.html|accessdate=19 May 2015|publisher=Star Africa|date=15 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the law "No person shall tattoo or make a skin mark or cause any tattoo or skin mark to be made on a child".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tribune.com.ng/news2013/index.php/en/editorial/item/12411-tribal-marks-in-modern-nigeria |title=Tribal marks in modern Nigeria: The burden, the anguish |author=Adeoye, Doyin |work=[[Nigerian Tribune|The Tribune]] |accessdate=19 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150521160445/http://tribune.com.ng/news2013/index.php/en/editorial/item/12411-tribal-marks-in-modern-nigeria |archivedate=21 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
