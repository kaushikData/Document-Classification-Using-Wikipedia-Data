[[File:Alastor.png|thumb|1816 first edition title page.]]{{italic title}}
'''''Alastor, or The Spirit of Solitude''''' is a poem by [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], written from 10 September to 14 December in 1815 in Bishopsgate, London and first published in 1816. The poem was without a title when Shelley passed it along to his contemporary and friend, [[Thomas Love Peacock]]. The poem is 720 lines long. It is considered to be one of the first of Shelley's major poems.

Peacock suggested the name Alastor which comes from [[Roman mythology]]. Peacock has defined [[Alastor]] as "evil genius."  The name does not refer to the hero or Poet of the poem, however, but instead to the spirit who divinely animates the Poet's imagination.

==Summary==

In ''Alastor'' the speaker ostensibly recounts the life of a Poet who zealously pursues the most obscure part of nature in search of "strange truths in undiscovered lands", journeying to the Caucasus Mountains ("the ethereal cliffs of Caucasus"), Persia, "Arabie", Cashmire, and "the wild Carmanian waste". The Poet rejects an "Arab maiden" in his search for an idealised embodiment of a woman. As the Poet wanders one night, he dreams of a "veiled maid". This veiled vision brings with her an intimation of the supernatural world that lies beyond nature. This dream vision serves as a mediator between the natural and supernatural domains by being both spirit and an element of human love. As the Poet attempts to unite with the spirit, night's blackness swallows the vision and severs his dreamy link to the [[supernatural]].

Once touched by the maddening hand of the supernatural, the Poet restlessly searches for a reconciliation with his lost vision. Though his imagination craves a reunion with the infinite, it too is ultimately anchored to the perceptions of the natural world.

Ruminating on thoughts of death as the possible next step beyond dream to the supernatural world he tasted, the Poet notices a small boat ("little shallop") floating down a nearby river. Passively, he sits in the boat furiously being driven down the river by a smooth wave. Deeper and deeper into the very source of the natural world he rushes. Like the water's surface supports the boat, the supernatural world "cradles" the mutability both of nature and of man.

As his senses are literally dulled, his imagination helps him sense the spirit's supernatural presence. Instead of perceiving the vision through the senses, the Poet imaginatively observes her in the dying images of the passing objects of nature. The boat flows onward to an "immeasurable void" and the Poet finds himself ready to sink into the supernatural world and break through the threshold into death.

When the Poet reaches the "obscurest chasm," his last sight is of the moon. As that image fades from the Poet's mind, he has finally attained transcendence to the supernatural world. The journey to the very source of nature led, finally, to an immanence within nature's very structure and to a world free of decay and change.

==1816 publication==
The work was first published in London in 1816 (see [[1816 in poetry]]) under the title ''Alastor; or, The Spirit of Solitude: And Other Poems'', printed for Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy, Pater-Noster Row; and Carpenter and Son, Old Bond-Street: by S. Hamilton, Weybridge, Surrey, consisting of the title poem and the following additional poems:

* "O! There Are Spirits Of The Air"
* Stanzas.—April 1814
* [[Mutability (poem)|Mutability]]
* "The Pale, The Cold, And The Moony Smile"
* A Summer-evening Church-yard
* To Wordsworth
* Feelings Of A Republican On The Fall Of Bonaparte
* Superstition
* Sonnet From The Italian Of Dante
* Translated From The Greek Of Moschus
* The Daemon Of The World

The epigraph to the poem is from St. Augustine's ''Confessions'', III, i, written between 397 and 398 AD:

:Nondum amabam, et amare amabam, quaerebam quid amarem, amans amare.

The English translation of the Latin is: "I was not yet in love, and I loved to be in love, I sought what I might love, in love with loving."

Shelley also quotes from William Wordsworth's ''The Excursion'' (1814) the lines, "The good die first,/ And they whose hearts are dry as summer dust / Burn to the socket!" The line "It is a woe 'too deep for tears'" is a quote from Wordsworth's "Ode: Intimations of Immortality".

Eight lines from the poem "Mutability" are quoted in ''[[Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus]]'' (1818) in the scene when Victor Frankenstein climbs [[Glacier Montanvert|Montanvert]] in the [[Swiss Alps]]:

:"We rest. A dream has power to poison sleep;
:We rise. One wandering thought pollutes the day;
:We feel, conceive or reason, laugh or weep;
:Embrace fond woe, or cast our cares away:

:It is the same! For, be it joy or sorrow,
:The path of its departure still is free:
:Man's yesterday may ne'er be like his morrow;
:Nought may endure but Mutability."

==Critical reception==

Reviews were initially negative when ''Alastor'' was published in 1816. [[John Gibson Lockhart]] of ''Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine'' wrote the first major positive review in the November 1819 issue. Lockhart wrote that Shelley is "a man of genius... Mr. Shelley is a poet, almost in the very highest sense of that mysterious word."

Leigh Hunt praised ''Alastor'' in the December 1816 issue of ''The Examiner''.

The poem was attacked by contemporary critics for its "obscurity". In a review in ''The Monthly Review'' for April 1816, the critic wrote: "We must candidly own that these poems are beyond our comprehension; and we did not obtain a clue to their sublime obscurity, till an address to Mr. Wordsworth explained in what school the author had formed his taste." In the ''Eclectic Review'' for October 1816, Josiah Condor wrote:

"We fear that not even this commentary [Shelley's Preface], will enable ordinary readers to decipher the import of the greater part of Mr. Shelley's allegory. All is wild and specious,intangible and incoherent as a dream. We should be utterly at a loss to convey any distinct idea of the plan or purpose of the poem."

In ''[[The British Critic]]'' for May 1816, the reviewer dismissed the work as "the madness of a poetic mind."

Mary Shelley, in her note on the work, wrote: "None of Shelley's poems is more characteristic than this." In the spring of 1815, Shelley had been erroneously diagnosed as suffering from consumption. Shelley suffered from spasms and there were abscesses in his lungs. He made a full recovery but the shock of imminent death is reflected in the work. Mary Shelley noted that the work "was the outpouring of his own emotions, embodied in the purest form he could conceive, painted in the ideal hues which his brilliant imagination inspired, and softened by the recent anticipation of death."

In his biography of John Keats, Sidney Colvin wrote on the influence of ''Alastor'' on Keats' ''Endymion'': "It is certain that Keats read and was impressed by ''Alastor''."

''Alastor'' influenced the poetry of William Butler Yeats, whose own work ''The Wanderings of Oisin'' was influenced by the Shelley poem.

==Critical review==
Critics have spent a great deal of effort attempting to identify the Poet. The most convincing possibility is [[William Wordsworth]], since the poem is framed with direct quotations from Wordsworth's poetry, and Shelley had a deeply ambivalent reaction to Wordsworth's poetry, as witnessed in his sonnet "To Wordsworth."

In 1912, Russian composer [[Nikolai Myaskovsky]] wrote his [[symphonic poem]] ''Alastor, Poème d'après Shelley'' (Op. 14) based on Shelley's work.

'''Alden''' is a [[character (arts)|fictional character]] from [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]]'s [[Horror fiction|horror]] [[drama]] series ''[[The Walking Dead (TV series)|The Walking Dead]]'', who first appeared in the [[The Walking Dead (season 8)|eighth season]] as a recurring character. He is described as a sexy, blue-collar twentysomething whose survival skills include sarcasm.&lt;ref name="Comic Book"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://comicbook.com/thewalkingdead/2017/04/26/the-walking-dead-new-characters-season-8-/ |title=The Walking Dead Casting Two New Characters For Season 8 |last=Davis |first=Brandon |date=April 26, 2017 |publisher=Comic Book |accessdate=December 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearances==

===Season 8===
{{see also|The Walking Dead (season 8)}}
In the episode "[[The Damned (The Walking Dead)|The Damned]]", while in a battle, Alden is one of the Saviors attempting to flee the Satellite Outpost, but is forced to surrender to the Militia remarking that "living sounds good" after being surrounded. He encourages his fellow Saviors to surrender as well. He is chained with several other Saviors in the episode "[[Monsters (The Walking Dead)|Monsters]]" and being transported to the Hilltop Colony. On their way a walker attack occurred. His fellow Savoirs who are chained together with him attend to flee in the panic, but he refuses and reminds them that the Militia has guns handy they don't. After successfully being brought to the Hilltop in the episode "[[The King, the Widow, and Rick]]", he asks [[Paul "Jesus" Monroe|Jesus]] what the colonists of the Hilltop are building inside. He is then imprisoned with the other Saviors and [[Gregory (The Walking Dead)|Gregory]]. He then stops Jared, a Savior who has tried to flee several times before, from escaping because he doesn't want any trouble. In the mid-season finale, "[[How It's Gotta Be]]", he begs to [[Maggie Greene|Maggie]] that she would spare Dean, a fellow inmate. Shortly after, Alden, in horror, witnesses Maggie execute Dean in cold blood.

In the episode "[[Dead or Alive Or]]", he suggests an agreement to Maggie that the prisoners be allowed to alternately go out supervised for a short period of time. At first she refuses, but eventually agrees. In the episode "[[Do Not Send Us Astray]]", Maggie threatens to kill all of the prisoners if [[Simon (The Walking Dead)|Simon]], the de facto leader of the Saviors, doesn't stop an attack on Hilltop. However Simon starts the attack without thinking about the welfare of the prisoners. Alden asks if he can help, but Maggie sends him back to the others inside. After the battle Alden buries the corpses of the fallen Saviors, stating that he doesn't think about them as his people anymore. On the following night, Henry arrives at the prison and threatens to kill all of the prisoners if the murderer of his brother doesn't show himself. Alden tries to talk Henry down and reveals that he also had a brother who has been killed, explaining through his own experiences that revenge won't help him. While they're talking, a wounded prisoner reanimates and kills two others, making Henry open the gate. In the panic, Jared is able to overpower Henry and escapes with some of the prisoners. Alden and several other prisoners however stay and try to close the main gate against a walker herd drawn by the gunfire. Alden then saves Siddiq from a walker, killing it with a shovel. Maggie and others arrive and hold Alden at gunpoint, asking him what happened. Alden explains that he and the other remaining prisoners don't know where the escapees went, but that they will stay and help despite the fact that they no longer have any strategic value to the Militia. Maggie appears to accept Alden's explanation.

Following the attack, Alden and the other former Savior prisoners are set free though they are not fully trusted and are not allowed to join the Militia. In "[[Still Gotta Mean Something]]," [[Rick Grimes|Rick]] approaches Alden for anything he knows about where the escaped prisoners may have gone. Alden suggests an old dive bar located between the Hilltop and the Sanctuary that Alden once scouted out for the Saviors as a potential outpost. Alden asks Rick to only kill who he needs to kill and to give the other Saviors, who Alden believes are just scared, a chance to join up with them as Alden's group did. When Rick returns with Morgan, Alden is sitting by the fire with Dianne and realizes that Rick killed all of the Saviors despite Alden's request.

In "[[Wrath (The Walking Dead)|Wrath]]," Alden and the other defected Savior prisoners volunteer for a mission to lead the walker herd that was drawn by the battle in "Do Not Send Us Astray" away from the Hilltop, an offer that is accepted. After they return, Alden is briefly accosted by Morgan Jones who was unaware of his mission. During the evacuation of the Hilltop, Alden chooses to stay behind with Tara to face the attacking Saviors with Tara alongside the other defectors, making it clear that even if Tara isn't with them, they are with her. Tara agrees to arm the defectors, but [[Aaron (The Walking Dead)|Aaron]] shows up with the women of Oceanside to firebomb the Savior attackers before a battle can break out. After the war is over, Alden approaches Maggie to ask her to remain at the Hilltop despite the other Savior defectors returning to the Sanctuary. Having read Georgie's book ''A Key to the Future'', Alden suggests that he can put his talents to better use making the book a reality and he has never truly felt at home in the Sanctuary. After a brief contemplation, Maggie agrees to allow Alden to join the Hilltop Colony.

===Season 9===
{{see also|The Walking Dead (season 9)}}
In   "[[A New Beginning]]," Alden travels with the group to the Museum to gather supplies; and talks with Ken and Marco on the way back. After Ken's sudden death, Alden sings at his funeral. When Maggie decides to hang Gregory, Alden watches in discomfort along with the others. In "[[The Bridge (The Walking Dead)|The Bridge]]", Alden comes to Rick to warn him that the Saviours are going to turn against him if he keeps going on the way he is, even comparing Rick's actions to that of Negan's. In "[[Warning Signs (The Walking Dead)|Warning Signs]]" Alden is present when The Saviors are causing an uproar and directly confronts Jed when trying to calm the situation. "In   "[[The Obliged]]," Jed reveals that he ambushed Alden and stole his gun, leaving Alden's ultimate fate unknown. 

Though he does not appear, Alden is mentioned in "[[Stradivarius (The Walking Dead)|Stradivarius]]" where he is revealed to be alive and one of the Hilltop's construction foremen six years after Rick Grimes' apparent death. Alden reappears in "[[Evolution (The Walking Dead)|Evolution]]" where he is shown working as a blacksmith alongside Earl Sutton and to be in a relationship with Carl's old girlfriend Enid.

==Development and reception==
The casting name for this character was Dillon. Before his first appearance, he was compared to other characters from the show like Spencer Monroe and Nicholas.&lt;ref name="Comic Book"/&gt; Alden's actual name wasn't revealed until "[[How It's Gotta Be]]" when fellow Savior Dean calls him Alden instead of Dillon.

'''Apantomancy''' is a form of [[divination]] using articles at hand or things that present themselves by chance.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia  | title = Apantomancy  | encyclopedia = The Element Encyclopedia of the Psychic World  | pages = 26  | publisher = Harper Element  | date = 2006  | id =   }}&lt;/ref&gt; The diviner works him/herself into a [[altered state of consciousness|state of trance]] until an object or event is perceived and a divination worked out.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2586">'''Artabazus''' ({{lang-grc|[[wikt:Ἀρτάβαζος|Ἀρτάβαζος]]}}; fl. 480 BC - 455 BC) was a [[satrap]] of [[Hellespontine Phrygia]] (now northwest [[Turkey]]) under the [[Achaemenid]] dynasty of [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]]. He was the son of [[Pharnaces (satrap)|Pharnaces]], who was the younger brother of [[Hystaspes (father of Darius I)|Hystaspes]].

Artabazus was one of the generals in [[Xerxes I|Xerxes]]' [[Second Persian invasion of Greece|invasion]] of [[Greece]], in charge of the reserve forces guarding the route back to Asia, and responsible for suppressing a revolt in [[Potidaea]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Hdt.+8.126.1 Herodotus 8,126-129]&lt;/ref&gt; The invasion ended with [[Mardonius (general)|Mardonius]], ignoring advice from Artabazus and others, meeting the Greeks in pitched battle at [[Battle of Plataea|Plataea]] and being defeated (479 BC).  The Greeks followed up their victory by sailing to [[Ionia]], where they destroyed the garrisoning forces under [[Tigranes]] at [[Battle of Mycale|Mycale]] in the same year.  Artabazus, however, managed to lead the remnant portion of a greatly reduced Persian army out of Greece and back to Ionia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Hdt.+9.89.1 Herodotus 9,89]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Herodotus]] and [[Plutarch]] this force consisted of 40,000 men. Herodotus claims in Thessaly he did not reveal the defeat as he would have been attacked, but claimed he needed to go to [[Thrace]] on a special mission. He was able to return to Persian territory despite losing men in attacks in Thrace.

As a reward, Artabazus was made satrap of Hellespontine Phrygia.  This office was passed down to his descendants.  He was succeeded by his son, Pharnabazus ([[floruit|fl.]] 455 BC - 430 BC), of whom little is known, and then by his grandson [[Pharnaces II of Phrygia]] (''fl.'' 430 BC - 413 BC), who is known to have been satrap at the outset of the [[Peloponnesian War]].  Pharnaces was in turn succeeded by his son, another [[Pharnabazus (5th century BC)|Pharnabazus]] (''fl.'' 413 BC - 373 BC), who is well known for his rivalry with [[Tissaphernes]] and wars against the [[Sparta]]ns.

The '''Association for Research and Enlightenment''' ('''A.R.E.'''), also known as Edgar Cayce's A.R.E., was founded by [[Edgar Cayce]] (1877–1945) in 1931 to research and explore subjects such as [[holistic health]], ancient mysteries, personal spirituality, [[dreams]] and [[dream interpretation]], intuition, philosophy and reincarnation. A.R.E.'s stated mission is to help people change their lives for the better through the ideas and information found in the Edgar Cayce readings.

Its international headquarters is in [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]], with a regional office in [[Houston]], [[Texas]]. There are also Edgar Cayce Centers in 37 countries and individual members in more than 70 countries.

A.R.E. runs conferences, retreats and other educational activities, and publishes books relating to Edgar Cayce and his teachings under the imprints of A.R.E. Press and 4th Dimension Press. The A.R.E. also publishes a quarterly member magazine, ''Venture Inward''.

It maintains an affiliation with [[Atlantic University]], and runs a Health Center and Day Spa at its Virginia Beach headquarters along with the Cayce/Reilly School of Massage.

== History ==

A.R.E. is the heir to a previous Cayce-related organization, the Association of National Investigators (A.N.I.). Dependent on the financial support of a few major donors, the ANI emphasized major institution-building projects such as the original Atlantic University and the Cayce Hospital for Research and Enlightenment, a hospital staffed with medical personnel who used Cayce-recommended treatments. The name of the hospital would later inspire the name, Association for Research and Enlightenment. The ANI and its various projects folded with the onset of the [[Great Depression]].

In 1931, Cayce called a meeting of his supporters in Virginia Beach, asking them directly whether they felt that his work should continue. The result was the creation of the Association for Research and Enlightenment as a successor organization to the A.N.I. This was also the beginning of a tradition of annual meetings at A.R.E.'s Virginia Beach headquarters featuring talks on various spiritual subjects.

Prior to Cayce's death in 1945, people seeking a reading from Cayce were asked to join the A.R.E. This helped insulate Cayce from charges of fortune-telling, which was illegal in some U.S. states, as he was not directly charging a fee for his services but receiving a salary from the member-supported A.R.E. Apart from supporting Cayce and his staff, a major emphasis of the early A.R.E. was the encouragement of small groups devoted to spiritual study, prayer, and meditation.

When Cayce died, he left many requests for readings unanswered. His son, Hugh Lynn Cayce, returned from the Army later that year and took charge of the A.R.E. Under Hugh Lynn Cayce's leadership, the A.R.E. arrived at the basic focus of activities and interests which it follows today. A major boost came with the rise of the 1960s [[counterculture]] and then the [[New Age Movement]], which coincided with a number of popular books on Cayce including Jess Stearn's best seller, ''The Sleeping Prophet''.

After Hugh Lynn's death in 1982 the A.R.E. was led by his son, Charles Thomas Cayce. Charles Thomas retired in 2006. The A.R.E.'s current CEO and executive director is Kevin J. Todeschi, previously the editor of the A.R.E. membership magazine, ''Venture Inward'', and a long-time A.R.E. staffer.

During the last few decades, the A.R.E. has focused its efforts on globalizing its activities and promoting Cayce's spiritual message in the mass media.

== Activities ==

Major activities of the A.R.E. include:

:* Nonprofit association membership with benefits such as a quarterly magazine (''Venture Inward'') and newsletter (''Cayce Quarterly'')
:* Lectures and tours at A.R.E. headquarters in Virginia Beach, Va., and around the U.S.; library facilities; bookstore; meditation garden
:* A.R.E. Health Center &amp; Spa focuses on holistic treatments at Virginia Beach campus
:* Housing and distributing the Edgar Cayce readings (14,306 documented readings on file)
:* Encouraging research into various aspects of the Cayce material
:* Publishing books, DVDs, and CDs through A.R.E. Press
:* International tours to sacred sites around the world
:* Cayce/Reilly School of Massage (holistic massage based on the Cayce readings)
:* Atlantic University (nonprofit higher education online university with masters in transpersonal studies and mindful leadership)
:* A summer camp for children, teens, families, and adults

== Structure ==

The A.R.E. is led by a board of trustees. The same board also heads a sister organization, the Edgar Cayce Foundation, which claims to hold the copyright to the Cayce readings and related material. (Critics point out that Cayce himself freely distributed the same material without copyright.) Books using Cayce quotes are thus expected to pay royalties.

A.R.E. membership is a subscription arrangement in which the member receives a packet of goods (publications, mainly) and services (e.g., access to Cayce readings online) in exchange for an annual fee. These fees can be waived altogether for people who cannot afford the full fee. Life memberships are also available.

Within the United States and Canada, A.R.E. activities are divided into 11 multi-state / multi-provincial regions and 3 major metropolitan areas. Their relationship with Virginia Beach is basically that of a branch office to headquarters. Overseas, there are presently 29 Edgar Cayce Centers in 25 countries and another 37 countries with a lesser degree of A.R.E. representation.

Study groups and the Glad Helpers group are organizationally independent of A.R.E. headquarters and in fact pre-date that organization. They do, however, cooperate to some degree. For example, A.R.E. headquarters refers inquirers to study groups, while study groups may donate money or encourage their participants to join the A.R.E.

== Study groups ==

Cayce study groups usually meet weekly in members' homes.  This occurs when no central place of gathering was available, such as in the A.R.E. of NYC at 241 West 30th Street.  Traditional Cayce groups include The Dream Group, The Prayers for Healing Group, and Search for God.  About half of the Prayers for Healing &amp; Search for God meetings are generally devoted to the study of some appropriate Cayce text, traditionally the two volumes of ''A Search For God.'' These consist of lessons which Study Group #1 put together with guidance from the sleeping Cayce (who refused to allow them to continue until he felt that they were successfully living the spiritual lessons already given). Often, study group members will attempt to apply the lessons in their lives, just as the first group did.

Usually, the other half of the Prayers for Healing meetings will be given over to meditation and recitation of names of those who wished for healing. Several prayers are often recited, including the [[Lord's Prayer]] and the [[Psalm 23|Twenty-Third Psalm]] ("The Lord is my shepherd..."). The mediation during the second half can also apply to the Search for God group.  Despite the prevalence of Christian traditions, a significant number of A.R.E. members are [[Jews]] or other non-Christians.

The Dream Group attempts to apply the Cayce philosophy to the interpretation of dreams.  The group will take turns sharing their dreams and, based on the methods outlined in his texts, attempt to interpret their own.  Later, the group will share ideas and feedback about whether the symbols and patterns were accurately interpreted.  These groups are no charge, but donations are appreciated.

== Symbol ==
The original A.R.E. symbol consisted of a white cross and dove on a blue background. In 2007, this was changed to a dove and globe.

'''Witchcraft''' among the Azande ([[Zande people|Zande]] people) is evil magic used to inflict harm on an individual and is the cause of all unusual or terrible events that take place. The belief in [[witchcraft]] is present in every aspect of Zande society. They believe it is a power that can only be passed on from a parent to their child. To the Azande, a witch uses witchcraft when he has hatred towards another person. Witchcraft can also manipulate nature to bring harm upon the victim of the witch. [[Oracle]]s and [[Witch doctor|witchdoctors]] determine whether someone is guilty of using witchcraft on another villager. More magic is then created to avenge the victim and punish the one who committed the transgression.

==Description==
The African tribe of the Azande are largely found in the African countries of South Sudan, the Central African Republic, and the Northern Democratic Republic of Congo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/zne |title=Zande |editor-last=Simons |editor2-last=Fennig |editor-first=Gary F. |editor2-first=Charles D. |date=2018 |website=Ethnologue: Languages of the World |edition=21th |location=Dallas, Texas |publisher=SIL International |access-date=April 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Witchcraft surrounds Zande culture and is believed to be the major cause of disease, death, and any other unfortunate events that occur.&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Evans-Pritchard |first=E. E. |authorlink=E. E. Evans-Pritchard |year=1935 |title=Witchcraft |journal=[[Africa (journal)|Africa]] |volume=8 |pages=417–422 |jstor=3180590}}&lt;/ref&gt; It clings to a digestive organ of the body, and the only way it can be inherited is if the offspring of the witch is of the same sex. If a witch is male, then his child must be male in order to inherit witchcraft; likewise, if a witch is female, then her child must be female for witchcraft to be passed on to her child.&lt;ref name="Wagner" /&gt; Witchcraft is a psychic power that can only be used at a short range.&lt;ref name="Wagner" /&gt; Because of this, the Azande tend to distance themselves from their neighbors and live closer to oracles. Witchcraft can also use nature to cause injury or even death if the witch allows it. It can  manipulate an animal such as a buffalo to kill someone or cause a structure such as a storage house to collapse on top of someone.&lt;ref name="Evans" /&gt;

Although witchcraft is the cause for any bad events that happen to anyone, the Azande do not blame it for human errors. It does not cause people to make mistakes in activities such as farming, hunting, or making crafts. Witchcraft also does not influence anyone to commit any moral crimes such as lying, cheating, or deceiving someone.&lt;ref name="Evans" /&gt;

A witch will not use his or her powers to hurt someone unless they dislike that person.&lt;ref name="Evans" /&gt; When a witch uses their witchcraft on a victim, it flows out of them and into the body of the sleeping victim to steal their soul; a group of witches will then eat the soul of the victim, working collaboratively. Killing a person is a slow process, for the witch may have to perform witchcraft several times on the person to actually accomplish it. In turn, while the witch is performing their witchcraft, the victim's relatives can prepare a plan of defense and strike back at the evil magic,&lt;ref name="Wagner" /&gt; but before they are allowed to do this, they must seek advice from an oracle.&lt;ref name="Evans" /&gt;

Azande witches do not use magical spells or use any medicines. Witches perform their witchcraft through physical acts. Witches are very different than sorcerers who use who can make people ill by performing magic through the use of bad medicines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Witchcraft, Oracles, and Magic Among the Azande|last=Evans-Pritchard|first=E.E.|publisher=The Clarendon Press|year=1937|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of oracles==
Oracles are tasked with finding those responsible of using witchcraft on an individual, and with predicting future tragedies. If someone believes witchcraft is being used to cause misfortune upon one of their relatives, they may seek the wisdom of the oracles to see if that is the case. Different methods are used by oracles to determine whether someone is using witchcraft to bring disaster upon an individual.&lt;ref name="Wagner"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wagner|first=Günter|date=October 1937|title=Witchcraft among the Azande|journal=Journal of the Royal African Society|volume=36|issue=145|pages=469–476|jstor=717946|doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.afraf.a101484}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Azande consult the [[oracle]]s about many different types of things that they need information on. In pre-European times the Zande chiefs consulted the oracles about different types of military decisions that they needed to make. The Azande use three different types of oracles. The most powerful oracle is the “benge” poison oracle, which is used solely by men. The decisions of the oracle are always accepted and no one questions it. This ritual that goes along with the use of the oracle utilizes a chicken and that is administered a special poison and then asked questions to. The answer to the question lies in the fate of the chicken whether it dies or lives after it is administered the poison for a set amount of time.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Culture sketches : case studies in anthropology |last=Peters-Golden |first=Holly |date=2012 |publisher=The McGraw-Hill |isbn=9780078117022 |edition=6th |location=Dubuque, Iowa |pages=3–4 |oclc=716069710}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One such method to find out if witchcraft is being used is the so-called poison oracle; this uses a vegetable poison called [[benge]], which is fed to a chicken.&lt;ref name="Wagner" /&gt; Whether the bird survives determines the answer. There are specific situations where a second fowl is fed the same poison to confirm the results of the first test. In order for the first test to be accepted as solid evidence, the results of the second test must be opposite of the first.&lt;ref name="Sankey"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sankey|first=Howard|year=2010|title=Witchcraft, Relativism and the Problem of the Criterion|journal=Erkenntnis|volume=72|pages=1–16|jstor=20642277|doi=10.1007/s10670-009-9193-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of an instance that the “benge” oracle may be used in is can be seen in the [[ethnography|ethnographic]] video ''Witchcraft Among the Azande'' by [[anthropologist]] [[John Ryle (writer)|John Ryle]]. In order to find out why his wife is sick a husband choses to consult the “benge” oracle to find the witch who is the one that is making his wife sick. He asks this question to the benge oracle and then feed the poison to the chicken if it dies then the witch he asked the question about is guilty.  The chicken in this case died and he then asked another chicken if he should divorce the second wife since she is the one causing the illness. But the oracle decides that would be pointless and that the other wife must spit water sincerely in order to purify herself so that the first wife gets well again.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite AV media |medium=Video |url=http://johnryle.com/?article=witchcraft-among-azande |title=Witchcraft among the Azande |people=Singer, André (Director) |date=1981 |via=johnryle.com |language=en-US |access-date=2018-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The “benge” oracle can also be used in adultery cases to help decide if the people on trial are guilty. This can be seen in the ethnographic video ''Witchcraft Among the Azande'' when they have a case of [[adultery]] in the village. The adultery case has to go before the “benge” oracle to see if the women should get to live or die and if she is guilty or telling the truth. The chief has to consult the “benge” oracle and the chicken should only die if the two undressed and had sex and the chicken died proving that adultery had taken place. This will then be taken to the court and shown to the judge to prove that the two had lied and were actually a part of adultery.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;

Another group of oracles that the Zande can seek is the termite oracle. The termite oracle is more readily available to all. Women, men, and children are all allowed to consult this oracle.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; When a question is presented before these oracles, they take a branch from two trees. One branch is called the ''dakpa'', another ''kpoyo''. The oracle takes these branches and sticks them into a termite mound and waits overnight to see which branch the termites eat, which dictates the answer. The termite oracle is not as popular as the poison oracle, because it is more time-consuming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Witchcraft, Oracles, and Magic Among the Azande|last=Evans-Pritchard|first=E.E.|publisher=|year=1937|isbn=|location=|pages=352–353}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is less elaborate and costly then the benge oracle.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; An example of an instance in which the termite oracle can be used in the ethnographic video ''Witchcraft Among the Azande'' when a woman in the village is sick and her husband wants to know whether or not she is going to live or die.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

[[File:Zande man with oracle (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Zande man with rubbing board oracle]]
The least expensive but also least reliable oracle is the rubbing-board oracle.  The rubbing board oracle is described in ''Culture Sketches'' as “a device resembling a [[Ouija|Ouija board]], made of two small pieces of wood easily carried to be consulted anywhere, and at any time.” They have a wood handle and second piece of wood if the wood catches or sticks then the answer to the question is revealed.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

== Witchdoctors ==
In addition to the oracles, witchdoctors can also predict disasters and reveal the witches who use their witchcraft to cause harm.&lt;ref name="Wagner" /&gt; Although both oracles and witchdoctors have these abilities, witchdoctors are considered to be more accurate as far as pointing out witches.&lt;ref name="Forde"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Forde|first=C.

[[Khalid ibn Barmak|Khalid]], the son of Barmak became the prime minister (''[[Vizier|wazir]]'') of Al Saffah, the first Caliph of the Abbasid dynasty. His son Yahya aided [[Harun Al-Rashid]] in capturing the throne and rose to power as the most powerful man in the Caliphate. The Barmakids were remarkable for their majesty, splendor and hospitality. They are mentioned in some stories of the ''[[Arabian Nights]]''.

== Origins ==
The family is traceable back to the hereditary [[Buddhist]] administrators, Sanskrit प्रमुख Pramukha (Arabized to Barmak), of the Buddhist monastery of [[Nava Vihara|Nava Vihāra]] (Nawbahar) west of [[Balkh]] (Northern Afghanistan).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Kevin van Bladel, "The Bactrian Background of the Barmakids" ch.3 in A. Akasoy, C. Burnett and R. Yoeli-Tlalim (eds.) ``Islam and Tibet: Interactions along the Musk Routes'', Ashgate, 2011, 43-88''&lt;/ref&gt;  Historians of Islam have sometimes considered the Barmakids to have been [[Zoroastrian]] priests before converting to Islam, an erroneous view based on the fact that Balkh was known as an important centre of Zoroastrianism, or from a simple failure of early Islamic sources to distinguish Zoroastrians from Buddhists. In fact, the Barmakids descended from the chiefs, or administrators of the Buddhist monastery called Navavihāra (Skt. नवविहार) or "New Monastery", that was described by the Chinese Buddhist diarist [[Xuanzang]] in the seventh century&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Si-yu-ki, Buddhist Records of the Western World, Translated from the Chinese of Hiuen Tsiang (AD 629)|last = Beal|first = S.|publisher = Kegan Paul, Trench, Trübner|year = 1884|isbn = |location = London|pages = 44 ff.|url = https://archive.org/stream/siyukibuddhistr01bealgoog#page/n154/mode/2up|volume = 1|note = |quote = Outside the city, towards the south-west, there is a convent called Navasaṅghārāma [synonym of "navavihāra"], which was built by a former king of this country.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="brillonline.com"&gt;[http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-2/al-baramika-COM_0099 Encyclopedia of Islam, 2 ed., v.1, pp.1033 ff.

The Pramukhas converted during the [[Muslim conquest of Persia|Arab invasion of the Sasanian Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kevin|first=van Bladel,|title=Barmakids|url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-3/*-COM_24302|journal=Encyclopaedia of Islam, THREE|language=en|doi=10.1163/1573-3912_ei3_com_24302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Barmakids were highly educated, respected and influential throughout Arabia, Persia, Central Asia and the Levant. In Baghdad, the Barmakid court became a centre of patronage for the [[Ulema]], poets, scholars alike.&lt;ref name="brillonline.com"/&gt;

The first member of the family whose identity is known in historical records was a physician of Balkh. He is reputed for a pill named after him and also recommended by [[Avicenna]] in addition to a scent which was widely used by prostitutes.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} According to [[al-Masudi]], the name Barmak was not a name but a title of the high priest of the fire temple of the city, though recent research makes it certain that it was a Buddhist title changed to look more Iranian. His wife was enslaved during the battle for Balkh in 705 and given to the Arab general's brother 'Abd-Ullah. Their sexual relation produced a son known as Khalid, whom 'Abd-Ullah later acknowledged as his natural son. She was later restored to her husband after peace was reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=XFB8-xIyUpAC&amp;pg=PA80|title=A Medical History of Persia and the Eastern Caliphate: From the Earliest Times Until the Year A.D. 1932|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|page=80|author=Cyril Elgood}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=2fRwPIBLpKcC&amp;pg=PA129|title=The History of al-Tabari Vol. 23: The Zenith of the Marwanid House: The Last Years of 'Abd al-Malik and The Caliphate of al-Walid A.D. 700-715/A.H. 81-96|author=transl. by Martin Hinds|first=|publisher=SUNY Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|page=129|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barmak had also been summoned to cure Caliph [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|Abd al-Malik]]'s son [[Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik|Maslama]] in 705.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Journal of Central Asia, Volumes 3-4|publisher=Centre for the Study of the Civilizations of Central Asia, Quaid-i-Azam University|page=141|year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abu Hafs 'Umar al-Kirmani's account narrates that the Barmak was brought among a party of ''shakirriya'' (thought to be slaves or retainers) and honored by the Caliph [[Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik]] who increased his status and was impressed by him.

===Khalid al-Barmaki===
See [[Khalid ibn Barmak]].

Khalid al-Barmaki (705–782) occupied distinguished positions under first two Abbasid Caliphs, [[al-Saffah]] (722–754) and [[al-Mansur]] (714–775). He had risen to be the vizier, following death of Abu Salma and Abul Jahm. Khalid was on such intimate terms with al-Saffah that his daughter was nursed by the wife of the Caliph. Likewise, Caliph's daughter was nursed by Khalid's wife.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Under Abbasid regime Khalid rose to the headship of the department of Finance (''diwan al-Kharaj'') This department was concerned with Taxation and Land Tenure. Genuine budgets began to be drawn up for the first time and offices sprang up for various departments. The extensive staff of officials engaged in correspondence with the provinces and prepared estimates and accounts. An influential stratum of officialdom, the Irano-Islamic class of secretaries (''[[kuttab]]'' in Arabic, ''[[dabiran]]'' in Persian), was formed which considered itself as the main support of the state. Their knowledge of the complex system of the ''[[kharaj]]'' (land tax) which took account not only of the quality of the land but of the produce of the crops sown, made the officials of the ''diwan al-Kharaj''; the guardians of knowledge which was inaccessible to the uninitiated and was passed by inheritance.&lt;ref name="brillonline.com"/&gt;

In 765, Khalid al-Barmaki received the governorship of [[Tabaristan]], where he crushed a dangerous uprising. During his governorship of [[Upper Mesopotamia]], Khalid, through a mix of firmness and justice, brought the province quickly into order and effectively curbed the unruly Kurds.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

=== Yaḥyá ibn Khālid ===
Khalid's son, [[Yahya ibn Khalid|Yaḥyá ibn Khālid]] (d. 806), at one time Governor of [[Arminiya]], was entrusted by Caliph [[al-Mahdi]] (775-85) with the education of his son, Harun, the future Caliph [[Harun al-Rashid|al-Rashid]].&lt;ref name="brillonline.com" /&gt;

=== al-Fadl and Ja'far ===
Yaḥya's sons [[al-Fadl ibn Yahya|al-Fadl]] (766–808) and [[Ja'far ibn Yahya|Ja'far]] (767–803), both occupied high offices under Harun al-Rashid.

== Influence under the early Abbasids ==

The Barmakid family was an early supporter of the [[Abbasid]] revolt against the Umayyads and of [[As-Saffah]]. This gave [[Khalid bin Barmak]] considerable influence, and his son [[Yahya ibn Khalid|Yaḥyá ibn Khālid]] (d. 806) was the vizier of the caliph [[al-Mahdi]] (ruled 775–785) and tutor of [[Harun al-Rashid|Hārūn al-Rashid]] (ruled 786–809). Yahya's sons [[al-Fadl ibn Yahya|al-Fadl]] and [[Ja'far ibn Yahya|Ja'far]] (767–803), both occupied high offices under Harun.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Many Barmakids were [[patron]]s of the sciences, which greatly helped the propagation of Iranian science and scholarship into the Islamic world of Baghdad and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = van Bladel|first = Kevin|title = Islam and Tibet: Interactions along the Musk Routes|year = 2011|publisher = Ashgate|location = London|pages = 43–88|editor = A.

{{quote|text="We know of Yahya ibn Khalid al-Barmaki (d. 805) as a patron of physicians and, specifically, of the translation of Hindu medical works into both Arabic and Persian. In all likelihood however, his activity took place in the orbit of the caliphal court in Iraq , where at the behest of Hārūn al-Rashīd (786–809), such books were translated into Arabic. Thus Khurāsān and Transoxiana were effectively bypassed in this transfer of learning from India to Islam, even though, undeniably the Barmakī's cultural outlook owed something to their land of origin, northern khurasan, and Yahya al-Barmakī's interest in medicine may have derived from no longer identifiable family tradition."&lt;ref&gt;History of Civilizations of Central Asia, Volume 4, Part 2 By C.

== Disgrace and fall ==
{{More citations needed|date=June 2018}}
In 803, the family lost favor in the eyes of Harun al-Rashīd, and many of its members were imprisoned.

According to Rit Nosotro, Harun al-Rashīd found his chief pleasure in the society of his sister [[ʿAbbāsa]] and Barmakid prince [[Jafar bin Yahya]]. In order that these two might be with him continuously without breach of the restrictions on women, he persuaded them to contract a purely formal marriage. This marriage was on condition the two would meet only in his presence, and never produce an heir. This condition was broken, and when Harun learned that ʿAbbāsa had borne a son, he had Jafar suddenly arrested and beheaded, and the rest of the family, except Yahya's brother Muḥammad, also imprisoned and deprived of their property.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

However, al-Tabari and Ibn Khaldūn mentioned other reasons ensuring that their decline was gradual and not sudden.  These other reasons are:

*The Barmakids' monetary extravagance, so that in displays of wealth they overshadowed Hārun himself. It has been said that Yahya ibn Khalid had gold tiles on the wall of his mansion, and Jafar ibn Yahya's mansion cost twenty million dirhams. Hārun became upset on a tour of [[Baghdad]]: whenever he saw an impressive house or mansion, he was told it belonged to the Barmakids.
*The hostility of [[al-Fadl ibn al-Rabi']], an official very close to Hārun. He convinced Hārūn to assign spies to watch them, and that is how Hārūn found out about the escape of Yahya ibn Abdullah al-Talibi.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}
*The Yahya ibn Abdullah al-Talibi incident. In AH 176, Yahya ibn Abdullah went to [[Daylam]] in Persia and called for rule by himself in place of Hārūn. Many people followed him, and he became strong enough to threaten Hārūn. Hārūn captured him, and placed him in house arrest in the custody of Barmakid al-Fadl ibn Yahya. However, al-Fadl ibn Yahya instead connived at Yahya ibn Abdullah's escape from Baghdad. The Caliph considered that to be [[high treason]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}
*The Barmakid army. Although technically this army of 50,000 men was under the Caliph, in reality, it was controlled by al-Fadl ibn Yahya. During the last days of Barmakid power, al-Fadl brought 20,000 men to Baghdad as the Karnabiya Legion. This made Harun very wary of their intentions.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}
*The Governor of Khurasan at the time, [[Ali ibn Isa ibn Mahan]], sent a letter to Hārun reporting unrest in his province, which he blamed on Musa ibn Yahya, another brother of Jafar.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

The fall of the Iranian Barmakids did not, however, affect the prominent position of the [[Persian people|Persians]] in the Abbasid court, which continued until [[al-Mutawakkil]].&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=39XZDnOWUXsC&amp;pg=PA66&lt;/ref&gt;

{{unreferenced section|date=April 2012}}
A number of canals, mosques and other public works owe their existence to the initiative and munificence of the Barmakids. Al Fadl ibn Yahya is credited with introducing the use of lamps in the mosques during the holy month of [[Ramadan]]. They are also credited with the establishment of the first paper mill in Baghdad. Jafar ibn Yahya acquired great fame for eloquence, literary activity, and [[calligraphy]]. Hitti argues that chiefly because of him, Arab historians regard the Barmakids as the founders of the class designated as 'people of the pen' (''ahl al-qalam''). The long neck which Barmakids possessed is said to have been responsible for the introduction of the custom of wearing high collars. The first extant Arabic report on India was prepared under the directions of Yahya ibn Barmak by his envoy. The Barmakids invited several scholars and physicians from everywhere in the caliphate to the court of Abbasids.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During the [[Caliphate campaigns in India]], [[Khalid ibn Barmak]] built the city of [[Mansura (Brahmanabad)]] there. Khalid was later in charge of the building of [[Baghdad]]. On 30 July 763, the caliph Al Mansur concluded the construction of the city.

'''Meditation''' and its effect on '''brain activity''' and the [[central nervous system]] became a focus of collaborative research in [[neuroscience]], [[psychology]] and [[neurobiology]] during the latter half of the 20th century. [[Research on meditation]] sought to define and characterize various practices. Meditation’s effect on the brain can be broken up into two categories: state changes and trait changes, respectively alterations in brain activities during the act of meditating and changes that are the outcome of long-term practice.

[[Mindfulness]] meditation is frequently studied, a [[Buddhist meditation]] approach found in [[Zen]] and [[Vipassana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Essentials of Buddhism |last=Mizuno |first=Kogen |year=1972 |publisher=Kosei Publishing Company |location=Tokyo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Vipassana : A Universal Buddhist Meditation Technique |last=Ahir |first=D.C. |year=1999 |publisher=Sri Satguru Publications |location=New Delhi}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jon Kabat-Zinn]] describes mindfulness meditation as a complete, unbiased attention to the current moment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Wherever You Go, There You Are : Mindfulness Meditation in Everyday Life 
 |last=Kabat-Zinn |first=Jon |year=1998 |publisher=Hyperion |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Changes in brain state==

=== Electroencephalography===
[[Electroencephalography]] (EEG) has been used in many studies as a primary method for evaluating the meditating brain.  Electroencephalography uses electrical leads placed all over the scalp to measure the collective electrical activity of the [[cerebral cortex]].  Specifically, EEG measures the electric fields of large groups of neurons.  EEG has the benefit of excellent temporal resolution and is able to measure aggregate activity of portions or the entire cortex down to the millisecond scale.  Unlike other imaging based methods, EEG does not have good spatial resolution and is more appropriately used to evaluate the running spontaneous activity of the cortex.  This spontaneous activity is classified into four main classifications based on the frequency of the activity, ranging from low frequency delta waves (&lt; 4&amp;nbsp;Hz) commonly found during sleep to beta waves (13–30&amp;nbsp;Hz) associated with an awake and alert brain.  In between these two extremes are theta waves (4–8&amp;nbsp;Hz) and alpha waves (8–12&amp;nbsp;Hz).

Many studies on mindfulness meditation, assessed in a review by Cahn and Polich in 2006, have linked lower frequency alpha waves, as well as theta waves, to meditation.&lt;ref name="Cahn"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cahn BR, Polich J |title = Meditation states and traits : EEG, ERP, and neuroimaging studies|pmid=16536641 |journal = Psychological Bulletin |volume = 132 |pages = 180–211 |year = 2006 &lt;!--|accessdate = 2011-09-06--&gt; |issue=2 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.132.2.180}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much older studies report more specific findings, such as decreased alpha blocking and increased frontal lobe specific theta activity.&lt;ref name="Kasamatsu"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kasamatsu KH, Hirai T |title = An electroencephalographic study on the zen meditation (Zazen) |journal = Folia Psychiatrica et Neurologica Japonica |volume = 20 |pages = 315–336 |year = 1966 &lt;!--|accessdate = 2011-09-06--&gt; |doi=10.1111/j.1440-1819.1966.tb02646.x |pmid=6013341 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alpha blocking is a phenomenon where the active brain, normally presenting beta wave activity, cannot as easily switch to alpha wave activity often involved in memory recall.  These findings would suggest that in a meditative state a person is more relaxed but maintains a sharp awareness.  Two large, recent comprehensive review works, however, point to poor control and statistical analyses in these early studies and comment that it can only be said with confidence that increased alpha and theta wave activity exists.&lt;ref name="Cahn" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chiesa"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Chiesa A, Serretti, A |title = A systematic review of neurobiological and clinical features of mindfulness meditations |journal = Psychological Medicine |volume = 40 |issue = 8 |pages = 1239–1252 |year = 2010 &lt;!--|accessdate = 2011-09-06--&gt; |doi=10.1017/S0033291709991747 |pmid=19941676}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Kamakura Budda Daibutsu front 1885.jpg|thumb|right|A statue of Buddha meditating.]]

===Neuroimaging===
[[Functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) is another highly utilized methodology for studying state changes in meditating brains.  fMRI detects subtle increases in blood flow to areas of the brain with higher metabolic activity.  Thus these areas of increased metabolic activity indicate which regions of the brain are currently being used to process whatever stimuli presented.  Counter to EEG, the advantage of fMRI is its spatial resolution, with the ability to produce detailed spatial maps of brain activity.  It suffers, however, in temporal resolution and cannot measure progressive activity, like the EEG, with much detail.

====Topographical findings====
As a relatively new technology, fMRI has only recently been used to assess brain state changes during meditation.  Recent studies have shown heightened activity in the [[anterior cingulate cortex]], [[frontal lobe|frontal cortex]], and [[prefrontal cortex]], specifically in the dorsal medial prefrontal area during Vipassana meditation.&lt;ref name="Holzel"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Holzel BK, Ott U, Hempel H, Hackl A, Wolf K, Stark R, Vaitl D |title = Differential engagement of anterior cingulate and adjacent medial frontal cortex in adept meditators and non-meditators |journal = Neuroscience Letters |volume = 421 |pages = 16–21 |year = 2007 &lt;!--|accessdate = 2011-09-06--&gt; |doi=10.1016/j.neulet.2007.04.074 |pmid=17548160}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, the [[cingulate cortex]] and [[frontal cortex]] areas were shown to have increased activity during Zen meditation.&lt;ref name="Pagnoni"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pagnoni G, Cekic M, Guo Y |title = ‘ Thinking about not- thinking’: neural correlates of conceptual processing during Zen meditation |journal = PLoS ONE |volume = 3 |pages = e3083 |year = 2008 &lt;!--|accessdate = 2011-09-06--&gt; |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0003083}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both studies comment on the possibility that these findings could indicate some state of heightened voluntary control over attention during mindfulness meditation.  Review works by Cahn and Chiesa state that these results indicate consistency in meditation’s effect on these regions of the brain, citing a multitude of other studies spanning other meditative disciplines, but mention the need for further investigation with better controls.&lt;ref name="Cahn" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chiesa" /&gt;

====Study on meditation and emotion====
The review by Cahn also notes findings describing a heightened emotional state of meditators.  A more complex study, conducted in 2008 by Lutz et al., focused on emotional response during meditation.&lt;ref name="Lutz"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lutz A, Brefczynski-Lewis J, Johnstone T, Davidson RJ |title = Regulation of the Neural Circuitry of Emotion by Compassion Meditation: Effects of Meditative Expertise |journal = PLoS ONE |volume = 3 |issue=3 |pages = e1897 |year = 2008 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0001897 |pmid=18365029 |pmc=2267490}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This investigation involved the creation of a “compassion meditation” state by novice and experienced meditators and testing the meditators response to emotionally charged sounds.  fMRI results indicated heightened activity in the cingulate cortex but also in the [[amygdala]], temporo-parietal junction, and right posterior [[superior temporal sulcus]] in response to the emotional sounds.  The authors of this study believe this indicates greater sensitivity to emotional expression and positive emotion due to the neural circuitry activated.&lt;ref name="Lutz" /&gt;

==Changes in brain due to the prolonged practice==

===Electroencephalography===
Similar to research into state changes in brain function, older studies make more specific claims about trait changes in meditators versus non-meditators. Changes to the alpha wave were indicated to be a trait, as well as state, phenomena. Studies have reported an increase in the specific frequencies expressed in the alpha range, increased alpha band power, and an overall slowing (reduction in frequency) in EEG activity in experienced meditators versus less experienced meditators while meditating.&lt;ref name="Kasamatsu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stigsby"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Stigsby B, Rodenberg JC, Moth HB |title = Electroencephalographic findings during mantra meditation (transcendental meditation). A controlled, quantitative study of experienced meditators |journal = Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology |volume = 51 |pages = 434–442 |year = 1981 &lt;!--|accessdate = 2011-09-06--&gt; |doi=10.1016/0013-4694(81)90107-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The alpha blocking phenomena, observed as a state change in brain function, was investigated as a possible trait change as well.  One study that examined a variety of meditation techniques tried to show that alpha blocking was affected by the long term practice of meditation by testing response to auditory stimuli.&lt;ref name="Becker"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Becker DE, Shapiro D |title = Physiological responses to clicks during Zen, yoga, and TM meditation |journal = Psychophysiology |volume = 18 |pages = 694–699 |year = 1981 &lt;!--|accessdate = 2011-09-06--&gt; |doi=10.1111/j.1469-8986.1981.tb01846.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Review works, however, comment on inconsistent findings as well as a lack of repeated results in this, and other studies.  They further remark that, similar to observations in brain state changes, only general assertions can be made about brain trait changes: some change in the electroencephalographic profile exists but with some inconsistency.&lt;ref name="Cahn" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Andersen"&gt;{{cite journal |author = Andersen J |title = Meditation meets behavioural medicine: The story of experimental research on meditation |journal = Journal of Consciousness Studies |volume = 7 |pages = 17–73 |year = 2000&lt;!--|accessdate = 2011-09-06--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also important to note that these trait changes were observed during meditation, and although it does indicate that a practitioner’s electroencephalographic profile is modified by the practice of meditation, these EEG studies have not yet shown changes in non-meditating brains, even of experienced meditators.

[[File:Hippocampus.gif|thumb|left|Red region of the brain shows the [[hippocampus]] which had been shown to have heightened activity during meditation by experienced meditators.]]

===Neuroimaging===
Brain trait changes have also been observed in neuroimaging studies, most often employing fMRI. In a [[meta-analysis]] of 21 neuroimaging studies, eight brain regions were found to be consistently altered, including areas key to meta-awareness (frontopolar cortex/[[Brodmann area 10]]), exteroceptive and interoceptive body awareness ([[sensory cortex]] and [[insular cortex]]), memory consolidation and reconsolidation ([[hippocampus]]), self and emotion regulation ([[anterior cingulate cortex]] and [[orbitofrontal cortex]]), and intra- and interhemispheric communication (superior longitudinal fasciculus; [[corpus callosum]])&lt;ref name="Fox 48–73"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fox|first=Kieran C.R.|author2=Nijeboer, Savannah |author3=Dixon, Matthew L. |author4=Floman, James L. |author5=Ellamil, Melissa |author6=Rumak, Samuel P. |author7=Sedlmeier, Peter |author8= Christoff, Kalina |title=Is meditation associated with altered brain structure? A systematic review and meta-analysis of morphometric neuroimaging in meditation practitioners|journal=Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews|date=June 2014|volume=43|pages=48–73|doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2014.03.016 |pmid=24705269}}&lt;/ref&gt; These changes were distinguished by density increases in [[grey matter]] regions and [[white matter]] pathways in the brains of individuals who meditate in comparison to individuals who do not. Of all areas with reported findings, a greater number of structural changes were found in the left hemisphere.
   
There is also evidence to suggest meditation plays a protective role against the natural reduction in [[grey matter]] volume associated with aging. One study found evidence that Zen meditators experienced a slower age related decline rate for cerebral gray matter volume in the [[putamen]] which plays a role in learning, cognitive flexibility and attentional processing &lt;ref name="Pagnoni2"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pagnoni G, Cekic M |title = Age effects on gray matter volume and attentional performance in Zen meditation |journal = Neurobiology of Aging |volume = 28 |pages = 1623–1627 |year = 2007 |doi = 10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2007.06.008 |pmid = 17655980 |issue = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could suggest a better attentiveness in aging meditators versus non-meditators.

Long-term meditation practitioners have also shown to have a higher tolerance for pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grant|first=J. A.|author2=Rainville, P.|title=Pain Sensitivity and Analgesic Effects of Mindful States in Zen Meditators: A Cross-Sectional Study|journal=Psychosomatic Medicine|date=5 January 2009|volume=71|issue=1|pages=106–114|doi=10.1097/psy.0b013e31818f52ee}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect has been correlated to altered function and structure in somatosensory cortices and an increased ability to decouple regions in the brain associated with the cognitive appraisal of pain ([[anterior cingulate cortex]] and [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grant|first=Joshua A.|author2=Courtemanche, Jérôme |author3=Rainville, Pierre |title=A non-elaborative mental stance and decoupling of executive and pain-related cortices predicts low pain sensitivity in Zen meditators|journal=Pain|date=January 2011|volume=152|issue=1|pages=150–156|doi=10.1016/j.pain.2010.10.006|pmid=21055874}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The brain state changes found in meditators are almost exclusively found in higher-order executive and association cortices.&lt;ref name="Fox 48–73"/&gt; This supports the notion that meditation increases self-regulation and attentiveness. Recent studies have also investigated how these changes may alter the functionality and connectivity of the [[default mode network]], which is a hypothesized network of brain regions that are active when an individual is engaged in internal tasks such as daydreaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jang|first=Joon Hwan|author2=Jung, Wi Hoon |author3=Kang, Do-Hyung |author4=Byun, Min Soo |author5=Kwon, Soo Jin |author6=Choi, Chi-Hoon |author7= Kwon, Jun Soo |title=Increased default mode network connectivity associated with meditation|journal=Neuroscience Letters|volume=487|issue=3|pages=358–362|doi=10.1016/j.neulet.2010.10.056 |pmid=21034792 |date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Validity of findings===
In the meta-analysis performed by Fox et al., several sources of bias were indicated which bring into question the validity of meditation studies which use neuroimaging. Fox et al. suggests a publication bias may be leading to the over-reporting of significant results.&lt;ref name="Kieran C.R 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fox|first=Kieran C.R.|author2=Nijeboer, Savannah |author3=Dixon, Matthew L. |author4=Floman, James L. |author5=Ellamil, Melissa |author6=Rumak, Samuel P. |author7=Sedlmeier, Peter |author8= Christoff, Kalina |title=Is meditation associated with altered brain structure? A systematic review and meta-analysis of morphometric neuroimaging in meditation practitioners|journal=Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews|volume=43|pages=48–73|doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2014.03.016 |pmid=24705269 |year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, however, Fox et al. found "consistent differences in prefrontal cortex and body awareness regions" in "areas key to meta-awareness..., exteroceptive and interoceptive body awareness..., memory consolidation and reconsolidation..., self and emotion regulation..., and intra- and interhemispheric communication..." and that changes were significant with "moderate" global median effect size and "consistent and medium-sized brain structure differences."&lt;ref name="Kieran C.R 2014" /&gt;

More research will be needed before any firm conclusions can be made.

==Popular literature==

===Positive portrayal===
Besides scientific literature, some authors have written of the promising [[research on meditation]] in books targeted for general audiences.  One such book, Buddha’s Brain by Rick Hanson, PhD shares the current scientific research and investigations into meditation.&lt;ref name=Hanson&gt;{{cite book |title=Buddha’s Brain: The Practical Neuroscience of Happiness, Love, and Wisdom |last=Hanson |first=Rick |year=2009 |publisher=New Harbinger Publication, INC |location=Oakland, CA|isbn=978-1572246959}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hanson, a neuroscientist and researcher, explains to readers the scientific studies in plain language and discuss the impact of the results.  Hanson’s main argument is that positive emotions, like love can be strengthened through meditation in a neuroplastic manner, citing dozens of scientific studies to support this claim.&lt;ref name=Hanson /&gt;  Hanson’s viewpoint is representative of a larger popular movement to study and embrace Eastern phenomena including meditation in the Western world.

===Rebuttal===
Critics, like Owen Flanagan, PhD, believe that Hanson, and those like him, are overextending the results of current scientific studies.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}  In his book ''Bodhisattva’s Brain: Buddhism Naturalized'', Flanagan presents a more conservative viewpoint of current scientific research and cautions readers against the seemingly exciting results of recent studies.&lt;ref name=Flanagan&gt;{{cite book |title= Bodhisattva’s Brain: Buddhism Naturalized |last=Flanagan |first=Owen |year=2011 |publisher=The MIT Press |location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=978-0262016049}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Flanagan does not believe current science supports the idea that positive emotion can be strengthened in the same way that stroke victims can recover use of limbs with use.&lt;ref name=Flanagan /&gt;  Flanagan does acknowledge that meditation may be beneficial in some way, but the mechanism of how meditation affects the brain is still clouded.&lt;ref name=Flanagan /&gt;  Similarly, Awasthi argues that Meditation is non-specific to the research studies showing clinical efficacy in some cases, though mechanisms remain unclear.&lt;ref name="Awasthi"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Awasthi B |title = Issues and perspectives in meditation research: in search for a definition|pmid=23335908  |journal = Frontiers in Psychology
 |volume = 3 |pages = 613 |year = 2013 |doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2012.00613 |pmc=3541715}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flanagan and Hanson use many of the same scientific studies to attempt to support their differing viewpoint, but both authors identify the need and importance of future studies investigating meditation.

The '''British Druid Order''' (BDO) is an international [[druid]] order, founded in 1979 as a religious and educational organisation. Its constitution defines it as a not-for-profit unincorporated association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The British Druid Order (BDO) Constitution|url=http://www.druidry.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/BDO-Constitution-2011.pdf|accessdate=17 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is commonly regarded as being one of the first, if not the first, explicitly [[neo-pagan]] Druid Orders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pearson|first=Joanne|title=A popular dictionary of Paganism|year=2002|publisher=Routlege}}&lt;/ref&gt; The order draws on medieval [[Welsh language|Welsh]] texts such as the [[Mabinogion]] and other early British/Celtic texts for inspiration&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hunt|first=Stephen|title=Alternative religions: a sociological introduction|year=2003|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to re-connect with the pre-Christian, indigenous religious and spiritual practices of Britain which it believes to be [[shamanic]] in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wallis|first=Robert J.|title=Shamans/Neo-Shamans: Ecstasies, Alternative Archaeologies and Contemporary Pagans|year=2013|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Founded in 1979 with the creation of the original Mother Grove, The Grove of the Badger, in Hastings, Sussex, England by [[Philip Shallcrass]], the current Chief of the Order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Little BDO History|url=http://www.druidry.co.uk/about-the-bdo/a-little-bdo-history/|accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1992, the BDO was publishing and disseminating pagan literature focused on the shamanic traditions of the Islands of Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wallis|first=Robert J.|title=Shamans/Neo-Shamans: Ecstasies, Alternative Archaeologies and Contemporary Pagans|year=2013|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gorsedd of Bards of Caer Abiri was co-founded at Avebury in 1993 by the BDO with ritual designed by [[Philip Shallcrass]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of New Religions and Cultural Production|year=2012|publisher=BRILL|location=Sydney|isbn=9789004221871|editor1=Cusack, Carole |editor2=Norman, Alex }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, [[Philip Shallcrass]] was joined by [[Emma Restall Orr]] as joint chief of the order.

The first US Gorsedd, Caer Pugetia, was founded in Seattle during a visit to America by the joint chiefs of the Order in 1997 and the Gorsedd of Bards of Cor Gawr founded at Stonehenge as part of the BDO's work to extend ritual access to the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Little BDO History|url=http://www.druidry.co.uk/about-the-bdo/a-little-bdo-history/|accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, [[Emma Restall Orr]] stepped down as joint chief of the order in order to set up [[The Druid Network]], following which in 2003 the BDO Circle of Elders was formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Little BDO History|url=http://www.druidry.co.uk/about-the-bdo/a-little-bdo-history/|accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2010, the BDO had completed construction of an Iron Age style [[Roundhouse (dwelling)|Roundhouse]] which has since been the focus of training, workshops and ritual for the order. 2011 saw the launch of the BDO's Bardic training,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Little BDO History|url=http://www.druidry.co.uk/about-the-bdo/a-little-bdo-history/|accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with its first Bards graduating in 2013.

2013 also saw the launch of the Druid Hedge Schools initiative, a loose network of pagan Druid trainings intended to promote Druidry as a spiritual practice in the modern world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Druid Hedge Schools|url=http://druidhedgeschools.org.uk/|accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principle Beliefs==
The British Druid Order follows the contemporary tradition of [[neo-druidry]] with its threefold division of the Order membership into Bards, Ovates and Druids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Researching paganisms|year=2004|publisher=Rowman Altamira|editor1=Blain, Jenny. |editor2=Ezzy, Douglas. |editor3=Harvey, Graham }}&lt;/ref&gt;

BDO Druidry 
* is [[animistic]], seeing all things as imbued with spirit,
* is [[polytheistic]], recognising many gods and goddesses,
* venerates ancestors of blood (our direct physical forebears) and of spirit (those who have walked similar spiritual paths before us) and
* venerates [[Spirit of place]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The British Druid Order (BDO) Constitution|url=http://www.druidry.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/BDO-Constitution-2011.pdf|accessdate=17 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The order believes that the pre-Christian, indigenous religious and spiritual practices of the original Druids were [[shamanic]] in nature, and works to reconstruct such practices in a form as a spiritual system answering to the needs of the 21st century where possible and to reconnect with the spirit of them where not,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wallis|first=Robert J.|title=Shamans/Neo-Shamans: Ecstasies, Alternative Archaeologies and Contemporary Pagans|year=2013|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; a process referred to by the BDO as 'rekindling the sacred fire.'&lt;ref&gt;The title of the BDO introductory book published by the Order in 1992, with revised editions in 1996 and 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Practically, the British Druid Order seeks to understand and work with the spirit of inspiration and creativity known in the British Druid tradition as '[[awen]]' through study, ritual, folklore, healing and many other practices to facilitate connections to sources of knowledge, inspiration and wisdom beyond the confines of the human psyche and rooted in the natural world. It also sees political and practical activism, in the areas of ecology, as a spiritual obligation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carr-Gomm|first=Philip|title=The Druid renaissance: the voice of Druidry today|year=1996|publisher=Thorsons}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BDO Spiritual Ecology|url=http://www.druidry.co.uk/getting-involved/green-links/|accessdate=17 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
The following is a list of publications that the BDO have produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wallis|first=Robert J.|title=Shamans/Neo-Shamans: Ecstasies, Alternative Archaeologies and Contemporary Pagans|year=2013|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tooth and Claw is still published on an occasional basis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13259">The '''Buddhist Publication Society''' is a charity whose goal is to explain and spread the [[dhamma|doctrine]] of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. It was founded in [[Sri Lanka]] in 1958 by two Sri Lankan Buddhist laymen, A.S. Karunaratna and Richard Abeyasekera, and a European-born Buddhist monk, [[Nyanaponika Thera]].  Originally conceived as a limited effort to publish small, affordable books on fundamental Buddhist topics, the Society expanded its scope in response to the reception of their early publishing efforts.  Reflecting its Sri Lankan roots, the Buddhist Publication society's publications reflect the perspective of the [[Theravada]] branch of Buddhism, drawing heavily from the [[Pali Canon]] for source material.

The BPS regularly supplies Buddhist literature to over 3,000 subscriber members all over the world, in some eighty countries. Its titles have been translated into many other languages, including German, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Czech, Hindi, and Chinese. 

== Publications ==
The Buddhist Publication Society publishes a variety of works, in both [[English (language)|English]] and [[Sinhalese language|Sinhala]], ranging from introductory works to translations of technical philosophical texts.  The Society publishes works by a number of noted Theravada monks and lay writers, including books by Nyanaponika Thera, [[Nyanatiloka]] Thera, [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]], [[Piyadassi Thera]], [[Bhikkhu Ñanamoli]], [[Narada Mahathera]], [[Mahasi Sayadaw]], Helmuth Hecker, S. Dhammika and Francis Story.  

From the BPS's inception to 1984 Ven. Nyanaponika Thera was the BPS's English editor. From 1984 until 2002 Ven. Bhikkhu Bodhi was the editor. Since 2005 Ven. Bhikkhu Nyanatusita is the editor.

The BPS's English-language publications fall into three classes: two series of booklets called ''The Wheel'' and ''Bodhi Leaves'', and full-size books. 

''The Wheel'' consists of booklets issued in a format 4.8 x 7.2 inches, typically ranging from 40 to 80 pages. Since the inception of BPS in 1958 about 250 titles have been published, though not all have been maintained in print. The booklets cover a wide range of topics and can be categorized as: Introductory Booklets; Specific Teachings (on the main topics of Buddhist doctrine, such as the Four Noble Truths, the Noble Eightfold Path, dependent origination, the three marks of existence, kamma and rebirth, and so forth); Meditation and Mind Training; Dhamma Reflections (more personal explorations of the relevance of Buddhist principles for spiritual understanding and practice); Philosophy and Psychology; Faith and Devotion; Monastic Life; Comparative Studies; Buddhist History and Culture; Buddhism and the World Today; Translations from the Pali Canon; Non-Canonical Buddhist Literature. All Wheel Publications have been digitalised and are being reissued in bound volumes as well as put on the BPS website. 

''Bodhi Leaves'' is a series of smaller booklets, hand-sized, between 16 and 40 pages in length. Its range of categories is similar to that of the Wheel, but the tone is different, less expository and more conversational. Bodhi Leaves are intended to offer personal insights into the Buddha's teachings, close-up focus on specific ethical and social problems, and practical guidelines to living by the light of the Dhamma. This series was discontinued some years ago, but the issues are being made available in digital format on the BPS website. 

The BPS's line of full-size books ranges from basic introductions to advanced texts on the finer points of Buddhist doctrine and practice. Books on basic Buddhism include several comprehensive surveys that have long been regarded as essential reference works. Ven. Narada Thera's ''The Buddha and His Teachings'' gives an informative account of the Master's life and teaching, highlighting the doctrines of kamma and rebirth, meditation, the nature of Nibbána, and the way to enlightenment. For a complete biography, Bhikkhu Ñanamoli's ''The Life of the Buddha'' is unique: a vivid and moving portrait of the Enlightened One composed almost entirely from texts of the Pali Canon. This is our most popular title, and though in print for over twenty-five years it is still constantly in demand. For an illuminating account of the Buddha's path two authoritative works can be recommended. One is Piyadassi Thera's popular ''The Buddha’s Ancient Path'', the other is Bhikkhu Bodhi's ''The Noble Eightfold Path''. Both works offer detailed explanations of each of the eight factors of the path, thus showing how Buddhism is to be practiced as a way of life.

For elementary, original source material on the Dhamma, two compilations by the great German scholar-monk Nyanatiloka Thera (Ven. Nyanaponika's teacher) are still unsurpassed. The more elementary is ''The Word of the Buddha'', first compiled in 1906 and subject to some sixteen reprints. This book arranges the Buddha's sayings around the framework of the Four Noble Truths. The more advanced title is ''The Buddha’s Path to Deliverance'', which documents the Buddha's own instructions on all the different methods of meditation, both for concentration and insight, and arranges them according to the pattern of the seven stages of purification.

The BPS also publishes accurate translations of several small classics from the Pali Canon, including Achariya Buddharakkhita's ''The Dhammapada'' and (in one volume) ''The Udána and the Itivuttaka'', translated by John Ireland. For more advanced students, the present writer has issued translations of four major Pali suttas along with their commentaries and excerpts from the subcommentaries. The first of these is the best one to start with: ''The Discourse on the All-Embracing Net of Views'', a translation of the Brahmajala Sutta and its commentaries. The others are: ''The Discourse on the Root of Existence (the Mulapariyaya Sutta)''; ''The Great Discourse on Causation (the Mahanidana Sutta)''; and ''The Discourse on the Fruits of Recluseship (the Samaññaphala Sutta).''

BPS books on meditation give qualified guidance in both the practical methods of meditation and the underlying theory. A thorough and informative survey is Amadeo Sole-Leris's ''Tranquillity and Insight,'' which systematically explores both samatha and vipassana meditation according to the classical sources and their modern adaptations. A modern classic is Nyanaponika Thera's ''The Heart of Buddhist Meditation.'' Basic instructions in insight meditation are found in Mahasi Sayadaw's ''Practical Insight Meditation'', while Jack Kornfield's ''Modern Buddhist Masters'' collects tracts from a range of contemporary Theravada meditation masters from Burma and Thailand. A work with a unique flavour is ''The Seven Stages of Purification'' by the late [[Matara Sri Ñāṇanārāma Mahathera]], one of Sri Lanka's most respected meditation masters of recent times. 

The BPS also publishes several books on the Abhidhamma, a systematic arrangement of the Buddha's philosophical and psychological teachings, defining the theory that lies behind his more pragmatically oriented discourses: ''A Comprehensive Manual of Abhidhamma'', a translation of the ''[[Abhidhammattha-sangaha]]'' complete with a detailed explanatory guide by the Burmese Sayadaw U [[Rewata Dhamma|Rewatadhamma]] and [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]]. Nyanaponika Thera's ''Abhidhamma Studies'' demonstrates the practical relevance of the Abhidhamma to the spiritual life. To find one's way through the seven books of the canonical Abhidhamma, Nyanatiloka Thera's ''Guide through the Abhidhamma Pitaka'' is of great use. For exploring the full range of classical Theravada thought Achariya Buddhaghosa's masterpiece, The ''Visuddhimagga'' is essential. This is a virtual encyclopaedia of Buddhist doctrine and meditation, which gives detailed coverage to all the meditation subjects and, in its middle chapters, a survey of the Abhidhamma. This is published by BPS in the outstanding translation by Bhikkhu Ñanamoli under the title ''The Path of Purification.'' The BPS also publishes the translation of an earlier, shorter work, the ''[[Vimuttimagga]]'' or ''Path of Freedom,'' which served as the example for the ''Visuddhimagga,'' and which is only completely extant in a Chinese translation. A draft translation from the Chinese was done by N.R.M. Ehara, [[Soma Thera]] and Kheminda Thera. A new translation of this important work is currently being done by Bhikkhu Nyanatusita. 

Over the years BPS has published several works by the greatest Burmese scholar-monk of recent times, Ledi Sayadaw. The Wheel series includes Ledi Sayadaw's ''Manual of Insight (Vipassana Dipani), The Requisites of Enlightenment (Bodhipakkhiya Dipani), The Noble Eightfold Path and Its Factors (Magganga Dipani), The Buddhist Philosophy of Relations (Patthanuddesa Dipani)'' and the ''Manual of Mindfulness of Breathing (Anapana Dipani)''. ''The  Manual of the Supreme Man (Uttamapurisa Dipani)'' and, most recently, the ''Manual of Light and the Path of Higher Knowledge (Alin Kyan and Vijjamagga Dipani)'' were published in book form. 

The most recent book publications of the BPS are: ''The Life of Nyanatiloka Thera'' by Hellmuth Hecker and Bhikkhu Nyanatusita, ''Similes of the Buddha'' by Hellmuth Hecker, ''Buddhist Nuns'' by Mohan Wijayaratna and ''Jataka Tales of the Buddha'' by Ken and Visakha Kawasaki.[http://www.bps.lk/new_releases.asp]

In the late 1990s, the BPS entered into co-publication agreements with major Buddhist publishers in the West. The purpose of this step is to make its own works more readily available to readers in the Americas and Europe. The BPS also co-publishes works on Theravada Buddhism first issued by Western publishers, to make them more easily available for Asian readers. To date the BPS's partner in both areas of cooperation has been Wisdom Publications in Boston. 

Works first issued by Wisdom Publications, and then taken over for the Asian readership by BPS, include: ''The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha'', a translation of the Majjhima Nikaya originally made by Bhikkhu Ñanamoli, U Pandita's ''In This Very Life'' and Ayya Khema's ''Being Nobody, Going Nowhere''. Along with Wisdom, the BPS also publishes a wonderful collection of biographies called ''The Great Disciples of the Buddha''. This book brings to life for the modern reader such outstanding figures as Sariputta and Moggallana.

BPS has also partnered with [[Pariyatti]], a U.S. publisher, importer, distributor, and bookseller affiliated with the Vipassana Research Academy, established in Igatpuri, India, by Sri S.N. Goenka. As well as distributing BPS books in the Americas, Pariyatti has created an imprint called BPS Pariyatti Editions (BPE) to publish American editions of ''The Path of Purification, A Comprehensive Manual of Abhidhamma, The Noble Eightfold Path'' and other popular BPS titles. 

Since 1960 the BPS has been issuing a Sinhala-language counterpart of The Wheel called ''Damsak'' (= ''Dhamma-cakka''), and a series of full-size books in Sinhala called Kalana Mithuru (= Kalyanamitra) Books. From 1960 ''Damsak'' was edited by the famous Sri Lankan missionary monk, Ven. Piyadassi Thera. After his death in 1998, responsibility for the Sinhala publications was taken over by his assistant, A.G.S. Kariyawasam until his death in 2005. Currently, Mr. Senadheera is looking after the Sinhalese publications.

== Dhamma Dana Project ==
In 1993, the Society launched the Nyanaponika Dhamma Dana project, named in honor of former Society president Nyanaponika Mahathera.  Under the auspices of the project, 50-150 copies of each new book published by the society are sent free of charge to libraries, monasteries, and Buddhist centers around the world.  Copies of the Wheel are also sent to a number of Buddhist temples and practice centers, to be distributed free of charge.

[[Portable Document Format|.pdf format]].

==Festivals==
CMA hosts two festivals a year: Beltane and Samhain. Held a couple of weeks before [[Beltaine]] and [[Samhain]], to allow for local and coven obligations, CMA has become primarily known for them.

For many years the festivals were held at a commercial camping property in the hill country of [[Austin, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Adler |first=Margot |authorlink=Margot Adler |title=[[Drawing Down the Moon: Witches, Druids, Goddess-Worshippers, and Other Pagans in America Today]] |origyear=1979 |type=Paperback |edition=Revised and Expanded |year=1986 |publisher=Beacon Press |location=Boston, MA |isbn=0-8070-3253-0 |pages=536 |chapter=Resources }} lists the CMA Beltaine and Samhain festivals.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999 CMA purchased land of their own, called [[#SpiritHaven|SpiritHaven]], located near the community of [[Cistern, Texas|Cistern]] in Central Texas.

A typical festival starts with setup on Wednesday for vendors and early arrivals.  The main attendees arrive on Thursday and Friday.  Each night a public ritual is held, presented by different volunteer members and their groups (covens, kindreds, groves, etc.), and, weather permitting, a bonfire (Revels) is lit.  The bonfire serves as the main public area for those who wish to stay up late into the night, drumming, dancing, and talking.  Personal and group campsites also host gatherings at night.

During the daylight hours of Friday and Saturday, a full schedule of workshops are presented, some by members and some by guest presenters which, in the past, has included such notables as [[Patricia Telesco]], Fritz Jung and Wren (of [[The Witches' Voice]]), [[Morning Glory Zell-Ravenheart]], and more.

Between the workshops and the evening ritual and bonfire, the main stage is used to present regional and national Pagan artists, such as [[Dreamtrybe]] (formerly ''Velvet Hammer''), [[Canvas (band)|Canvas]], Spoonfed Tribe, [[SONA (band)|SONA]], Lisa Thiel,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacreddream.com/artist-info/ Sacreddream.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin Davis, [[Spiral Dance (band)|Spiral Dance]], and others.

The corporation's business meeting, called Great Works, is held on Sunday after the festival.

==SpiritHaven==
Often referred to as, simply, "The Land", Spirit Haven Ranch is {{convert|101|acre|km2}} just outside the town of [[Cistern, Texas]], which is a few miles north of [[Interstate 10 in Texas|IH-10]] and the town of [[Flatonia, Texas]]. Although some improvements have been made, such as a water well and electricity for some critical needs such as a First Aid Building, and Ritual Areas, the land is mostly rough. The camping areas are mesquite covered, while the Sacred Spaces (located in the flood plain, around the creek) are more densely wooded with oaks and other native trees.

Maintenance between festivals, and the majority of the work to ready the land for each festival, is done by the volunteers of the Spirit Haven Ranch Team, and all members are welcome to come out on the work weekends as part of the team, as well as interested persons wanting to learn more about CMA.

Tent camping is the only form of lodging available at Spirit Haven Ranch. RV space is limited and without amenities.
Members may also now lease campsites on a yearly basis, reserving their group's placement during Festivals. These sites are reserved for the lessee and their associates.&lt;ref&gt;CMA Registration Office&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4945">'''Dru yoga''' is a style of [[yoga]] that works with postures, breath work, relaxation and [[meditation]]. Its [[Yoga series|series]] or sequences are called Energy Block Release. According to "Dru World Wide" this yoga style has thousands of practitioners in 31 countries.&lt;br /&gt; The word Dru in the name refers to the [[hindu]] [[deity]] [[dhruva]], a prince from the [[Hindu]] mythology the god [[Vishnu]] honored with the eternal abode on the Pole Star (Dhruva Nakshatra in [[sanskrit]]).

Dru Yoga aims in creating healing and unity by combining [[Asanas]], [[Pranayama]] (breath) and ancient Eastern tradition of [[Mudras]] (hand gestures).

== History ==
Dru was started in 1978 by Mansukh Patel, Chris Barrington, Rita Goswami, Annie Jones and John Jones at [[Bangor University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://druweb.org/drunews/DYabout.html Dru Yoga and its history in the West]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.groundreport.com/mansukh-patel-an-inspiring-leader/ Mansukh Patel, an inspiring leader], Stephen Vargas,  Mar 23, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; It is inspired by the teachings of [[Francis of Assisi]] and [[Mahatma Gandhi]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.yogaonline.nl/stijl/dru-yoga-2/ Dru yoga], Yoga Magazine, Jenny van den Heuvel, 27 September 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hindu Munnani''' is a [[religious]] and [[cultural]] [[organization]] based in the [[Indian state]] of [[Tamil Nadu]] which was formed to defend [[Hinduism]] and protect Hindu religious monuments.

==History==
Hindu Munnani was founded in 1980&lt;ref name="abouthm"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hindumunnani.org.in|title=About the Hindu Munnani|accessdate=2008-06-15|publisher=Official website of the Hindu Munnani}}&lt;/ref&gt; or 1982&lt;ref name="rsstnp19"&gt;[[#rsstn|K.

G. Rajamohan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, it has been lobbying for the rights of the Hindus, fighting the Islamic right-wing and radical Islamic political groups and vehemently opposing Christian conversions.&lt;ref name="ramagopalan_interview"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/1998/may/22munani.htm|title='Hinduism and fundamentalism are contradiction in terms'|date=1998-05-22 |accessdate=2008-06-16|publisher=Rediff|author=N. Sathiya Moorthy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives==
The Hindu Munnani website describes its objectives as follows:&lt;ref name="objectiveshm"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hindumunnani.org.in|title=Objectives of the Hindu Munnani|accessdate=2008-06-15|publisher=Official website of the Hindu Munnani}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* To wrest Hindu temples from government control and entrust them to the care of a public body.
* To fight for a [[Uniform civil code|Common Civil Code]].
* To strive for compulsory enforcement of [[Family planning in India|family planning]].
* To strive for enaction of Anti-[[Religious conversion|Conversion]] law.
* Ban on [[Cattle slaughter in India|cow slaughter]]

* Repeal of [[Article 370]]
* To protect [[Persecution of Hindus|Hindu rights and interests]].

==Activities==
The Hindu Munnani first gained public awareness in 1982 when it began to mobilize the Hindu population of [[Ramanathapuram district]] in response to the [[1981 Meenakshipuram conversion|Meenakshipuram conversions]] by Ishaatul Islam Sabha of South India &lt;ref name="rajamohan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="katju"&gt;{{cite book | title=Vishva Hindu Parishad and Indian Politics | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b70nKb-8YuMC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;lpg=PA34| last=Katju| first=Manjari| year=2003| pages=34| publisher=Orient Longman | isbn=978-81-250-2476-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the Hindu Munnani has often espoused the cause of Hindus, the Hindu religion and [[Hindu culture]].

However, the most remarkable achievement of the Hindu Munnani was the organization of [[Vinayaka Chathurthi]] processions in Tamil Nadu.&lt;ref name="Chathurthi"&gt;{{cite news|last = Hoskote|first = Ranjit|title = From pedestal to pavement |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/mag/2004/09/12/stories/2004091200270100.htm |work = The Hindu: Magazine|date = 12 September 2004|accessdate = 2008-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chathurthi2"&gt;{{cite journal|author=C.

The victim was later rushed to a private hospital, where he died. His body was taken to Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital (CMCH) where a postmortem was conducted.

His death triggered a [[2016 Coimbatore riots|riot]].

The Hindu Munnani state president said his organisation’s patience was wearing thin, as the state government had failed to prevent a series of attacks on its workers Kadeswara C. Subramaniam, the State president of the Munnani, listed a series of attacks on his cadre including three murders.

== Controversies ==
Right from its genesis, the Hindu Munnani was involved in a number of controversies. Its genesis was coeval with the Meenakshipuram conversions and the Hindu-Muslim and Hindu-Christian riots which followed. On 19 February 1981, about 200 [[Dalit|Dalit families]] in the village of Meenakshipuram in the Tirunelveli district of Tamil Nadu were converted to [[Islam]]&lt;ref name="meenakshipuram1"&gt;{{cite news|title = 'As Muslims, we are now respected' |url=http://specials.rediff.com/news/2006/sep/27sld2.htm |work = Rediff.com|date = 27 September 2006|accessdate = 2008-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the name of their village was changed to Rehmatpuram.&lt;ref name="rsstnp19" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rajamohan" /&gt; The Hindu Munnani was active in organizing a mass movement to bring the converted Dalits back into the Hindu fold.&lt;ref name="rsstnp19" /&gt; In March 1982, when [[religious violence in India|riots]] broke out between Hindus and Christians at Mandaikadu in [[Kanyakumari district]], the Hindu Munnani played an active role.&lt;ref name="rajamohan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rsstnp20"&gt;[[#rsstn|K.

In November 2007, a photo of Tamil actress [[Kushboo]] sitting cross-legged with slippers in front of idols of Hindu goddesses landed the actress in the middle of a huge controversy.&lt;ref name="kushboo_1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Kushboo in trouble again |last=Shankar |first=Settu |url=http://entertainment.oneindia.in/tamil/exclusive/kushboo-insulting-hindu-291107.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130218142911/http://entertainment.oneindia.in/tamil/exclusive/kushboo-insulting-hindu-291107.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=18 February 2013 |work=oneindia.com |date=29 November 2007 |accessdate=2008-06-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A complaint was lodged by Gurumurthy a Hindu Munnani leader.&lt;ref name="kushboo_1" /&gt; The Hindu Munnani President Rama Gopalan said that Kushboo's act was unbecoming of a public figure and demanded a public apology from her.&lt;ref name="kushboo_1" /&gt; In June 2008, the Hindu Munnani threatened to block Kamal Hassan's film ''Dasavatharam'' on the ground that certain scenes in the film affected the sentiments of Hindus.&lt;ref name="kamal_hassan"&gt;{{cite news|title = Hindu Munnani threatens to block "Dasavatharam" release |url=http://www.nowrunning.com/news/news.aspx?it=15392 |work = nowrunning.com|date = 5 June 2008|accessdate = 2008-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1993, on the first anniversary of the [[Babri Masjid]] demolition, there was widespread violence allegidly organised by hindu munnadi in the Kottaimedu area of Coimbatore. Violence also occurred during the fifth anniversary of the demolition in 1997, and also during the aftermath of the [[1998 Coimbatore bombings|Coimbatore bomings]] in 1998.

{{Hinduism_small}}
'''Hindu music''' is [[music]] created for or influenced by [[Hinduism]]. It includes [[Indian classical music]], [[Kirtan]], [[Bhajan]] and other [[musical genre]]s.
[[Raga|Raagas]] are a common form of Hindu music in classical India.

The most common Hindu bhajan in North India is "Om Jai Jagdish Hare." 
The  names of [[Hindu gods|Gods]] are religiously chanted, often including [[Vishnu]] and his incarnations, [[Shiva]] and the Goddess ([[Parvati]], [[Shakti]], [[Vaishnodevi]]).

A very common scale in Hindu music is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7, which can be [[harmonization|harmonized]] into a chord progression.

==Bhajan==
{{Main|Bhajan}}
A '''bhajan''' is a [[Hindu]] [[devotional song]], often of ancient origin. Bhajans are often simple [[songs]] in lyrical language expressing emotions of love for the [[divinity|Divine]], whether for a single [[God]]/[[Devi|Goddess]], or any number of divinities. Many bhajans feature several names and aspects of the chosen deity, especially in the case of Hindu [[sahasranama]]s, which list a divinity's 1008 names. Great importance is attributed to the singing of bhajans with [[Bhakti]], i.e. loving devotion. "Rasanam Lakshanam Bhajanam" means the act by which we feel more closer to our inner self or God, is a bhajan. Acts which are done for the God is called bhajan. 

Traditionally, the music has been [[Indian classical music]], which is based on [[raga]]s and [[tala (music)|tala]] (rhythmic beat patterns) played on the [[Veena]] (or [[Rudra Veena|Been]]), [[Sarangi]] [[Venu]] (flute), [[Mridanga]](or [[Tabla]]) (traditional Indian instruments). The Sikh Scripture contains 31 [[raga]]s and 17 [[tala (music)|tala]]s which form the basis for kirtan music compositions.

Hindus are even said to have achieved [[Moksha]] through devoting music to God. For example in the [[Rig Veda]] [[Gargi]], the wife of [[Yajnavalkya]], through her excellence in veena playing, an incident that caused Sage Yagnavalkya to write the famous verse: 

::"Veena Vadama Tatvagnaha

::Sruthi Jathi Visharada

::Talagnanacha Aprayasena

::Mokshamargam Gachachathi"

("Yagnavalkya Siksha")

There have also been several music-saints (e.g. [[Tyagaraja|Sant Tyagaraja]]) and poet-saints (e.g. [[Ravidas|Sant Ravidas]]).

==Kirtan==
{{Main|Kirtan}}
This is the communal, call-and-response chanting of [[mantra]]s, often with instruments and dance. Kirtans are deeply rooted in Vedic tradition.

==Indian classical music==
{{Main|Indian classical music}}
The origins of '''Indian classical music''' can be found from the oldest of scriptures, part of the [[Hindu]] tradition, the [[Vedas]]. [[Samaveda]], one of the four Vedas, describes [[music]] at length.

The Buddha's hands are in the ''bhūmisparśa mudrā'' (Earth-touching position). [[Haw Phra Kaew]] temple, Viang Chan, [[Laos]]]] 
&lt;!-- comment {{lang-th|เรื่อง Text}} gives Thai: เรื่อง Text with "Thai" as link to Thai language, Thai language link omitted in {{lang|th|เรื่อง text}}.--&gt;
The '''Iconography of Gautama Buddha''' in [[Laos]] and [[Thailand]] is referred to as '''''pang phraputtarup''''' [[:th:ปางพระพุทธรูป]], and a given pose as ''pang'' {{lang-th|ปาง episode}}. These recall specific [[episode]]s during his [[Gautama Buddha#Travels and teaching|travels and teachings]] that are familiar to the Buddhists according to an '''[[iconography]]''' with specific rules; certain ones of these are considered particularly [[wikt:auspicious|auspicious]] for those born on particular days of the week.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usmta.com/Thai-Birthday.htm ''Thai birth day colors and Buddha image'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The Buddha is always represented with certain physical attributes, and in specified dress and specified poses. Each pose, and particularly the position and gestures of the Buddha's hands, has a defined meaning which is familiar to Buddhists.  In other Buddhist countries, different but related iconography is used, for example the [[mudra]]s in Indian art.

==Introduction==
[[Image:Buddha Reclining Bangkok Thailand by D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The Reclining Buddha]]

For Buddhists, the correct depiction of the Buddha is not an [[wikt:anabolism|anabolistic]] matter; Buddhists believe that a properly rendered Buddha image is a [[Hypostasis (religion)|hypostasis]]: an actual spiritual emanation of the Buddha, which possesses supernatural qualities. Although the Buddha is not a god, Buddhists seek to communicate with the supernatural world through Buddha images, making offerings to them and praying before them.
[[Image:Buddhistspraying.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Buddhists venerating a Buddha image ([[Wat Doi Suthep]], Chiang Mai, Thailand)]]

Buddha images are not intended to be naturalistic representations of what Gautama Buddha looked like. There are no contemporary images of him, and the oldest Buddha images date from 500 to 600 years after his lifetime. But Buddhists believe that Buddha images represent an ideal reality of the Buddha, and that every Buddha image stands at the end of a succession of images reaching back to the Buddha himself.

When creating a Buddha image, the artist is expected to be in a spiritual and mental state (''samādhi'') that will enable him to visualise this ideal reality. There is no requirement that every Buddha image be identical, and in fact there is a wide variety of artistic styles and national traditions in representing the Buddha. There are, however, certain rules of representation that must be adhered to.

==Development==
The current range of postures in which the Buddha may be shown, and the gestures which may be depicted, evolved over the first millennium of the Buddhist era (roughly 500 BCE to 500 CE), mainly in [[India]], the original homeland of Buddhism.  The tradition of images that reached South-East Asia had been changed in the later 5th century CE, apparently first at [[Sarnath]] in India.  The new "Sarnath image type" or "Gupta period Buddhist image" differs from earlier Buddha images, such as those in [[Greco-Buddhist art]], in a number of respects: the gaze is lowered, the clinging robes disclose no male genital bulge, the robe lacks folds, and there are different body proportions.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Robert L., pp. 318-319, "The Importance of Gupta-period Sculpture in Southeast Asian Art History", in ''Early Interactions Between South and Southeast Asia: Reflections on Cross-cultural Exchange'', Editors Pierre-Yves Manguin, A. Mani, Geoff Wade, 2011, Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, {{ISBN|9814311162}}, 9789814311168, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FuCYBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA318 google books]&lt;/ref&gt;  

In the early part of this period, the Buddha was usually shown giving a general gesture of benediction, with the right hand held at shoulder-height with the palm facing forward and the fingers together and slightly bent. By the end of the [[Gupta Empire]] (about 550 CE), the canon of representation had become more varied, with the seated meditative position (''dhyāna mudrā'' - see below) becoming common, particularly in [[Sri Lanka]]. By the 7th century CE the canon was largely as it is seen today.
[[Image:Phutthamonthon 001.jpg|thumb|222px|right|Statue of the Buddha with his hand upraised in the ''abhāya mudrā'' position. He is draped with monastic robes, with the right shoulder bare. ([[Phutthamonthon]], Thailand)]]

As Buddhism spread from India to other countries, variations in the depiction of the Buddha evolved. This article describes the canon of Buddha representation in Thailand and Laos. This canon was not formalised until the 19th century, as part of the general project of "modernisation" that followed the Buddhist world's encounter with Western civilisation. A key figure in this process was the Siamese royal prince and Buddhist monk [[Paramanuchit Chinorot]], a son of King [[Rama I]], who in 1814 was appointed administrator of the [[Wat Pho]] royal temple in [[Bangkok]]. At the request of King [[Rama III]], Paramanuchit described and represented 40 different postures of the Buddha in an illustrated treatise called ''Pathama Sambodhikatha''. Some of these, such as "Buddha threading a needle," were new, although justified through reference to the literary accounts of the Buddha's life. Paramanuchit's illustrations were later rendered as bronze miniatures, which can be seen today at [[Wat Phra Kaew]] in Bangkok and serve as templates for the creation of modern Buddhist imagery.

==Attributes of the Buddha==
[[Image:Buddhaimage3.JPG|thumb|250px|left|[[Reclining Buddha]] (Wat Xieng Thong, Luang Phrabāng, Laos)]] [[:th:ปางปรินิพพาน]]

The ''[[Digha Nikaya|Dīgha Nikāya]]'', a [[Pāli]] text of the 1st century BCE, gives a list of 32 physical attributes of the Buddha. Some of these are poetic or fanciful ("legs like an antelope's," "ankles like rounded shells"), while others are more specific: feet with level tread, projecting heels, long and slender fingers and toes, a tuft of hair between the eyebrows. Although it is not required that Buddha images reflect all of these attributes, many of them have acquired canonical status.

Most curiously, the Buddha is said to have had a protuberance on the top of his skull, the ''usnīsa''. This is sometimes shown as a spire or spike, and sometimes only as a small bump. The Buddha always has a serene expression or a faint smile. The Buddha is also always depicted with very [[Stretching (body piercing)|long earlobes]]. This is attributed to his earlier life as a prince, weighed down by material possession, but has since come to symbolize wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2714/why-do-statues-of-buddha-have-long-earlobes Why do statues of Buddha have long earlobes? What's the difference between fat Buddha and regular Buddha? (2007) ''Straight Dope'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Posture and dress==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Buddhaimage1.JPG|thumb|250px|Modern statue of the Buddha near [[Pha That Luang]], Viang Chan, Laos. The Buddha's outstretched hand is in the ''vitarka mudrā'' position. The gesture is intended in this case to be read as an "appeal for peace."]] --&gt;

The Buddha may be depicted in one of four postures:
*Sitting: If seated, the Buddha may be shown in one of three different positions
:In the "heroic posture" (''vīrāsana''), with the legs folded over each other
:In the "adamantine posture" (''vajrāsana''; also known as "[[lotus position]]"), with the legs crossed so that the soles of both feet are turned up
:In the position of a person sitting in a chair (''pralambanāsana'')
*Standing: If standing, the Buddha may be shown either with his feet together, or with one foot forward
*Walking
*[[Reclining Buddha|Reclining]]: The reclining posture may represent the Buddha resting or sleeping, but more usually represents the ''mahāparinabbāna'': the Buddha's final state of enlightenment before his death

[[Image:Buddha Park.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Modern gigantic rendition of the ''reclining Buddha'' in [[Luang Pu Bunleua Sulilat|Bunleua Sulilat]]'s [[Buddha Park]].]]
The Buddha is nearly always depicted wearing a monastic robe, of the type worn by Buddhist monks today. The robe may be shown as worn in the "covering mode" (draped over both shoulders) or in the "open mode" (leaving the right shoulder and breast uncovered). The robe is a representation of the Buddha's humility. (Gautama was originally a prince, who renounced the world to seek enlightenment, and his original robe was made from the shroud of a corpse.) The robe is sometimes shown as diaphanous, transparent or billowing mysteriously, suggesting the spiritual power emanating from the Buddha. Buddha images are often draped with real robes, which are renewed periodically, usually at major festivals. The Buddha may also be shown wearing royal attire, but this is uncommon.

==Hand gestures==
[[Image:Buddhaimage4.JPG|thumb|250px|Statue of "the Buddha meditating." The Buddha's hands are in the ''dhyāna mudrā'' position ([[Wat Xieng Thong]], Luang Phrabāng, Laos)]]

The most important aspect of the iconography of the Buddha is gestures made with the hands, known as ''[[Mudra|mudrā]]''. These gestures have meanings which are known throughout the Buddhist world, and when combined with the postures described above, give a complete representation, usually associated with a particular incident in the life of the Buddha.

The six ''mudrā'' associated with the Buddha are:
*[[Phra Mae Thorani|Touching the earth]] (''Bhūmiśparṣa mudrā'') [[:th:ปางมารวิชัย]] ''pang maa-rá-wí-chai'': the right arm rests on the right thigh with the fingers pointing downwards, but not always touching the earth (as can be seen in the image at the top of this page). The left hand rests in the ''dhyāna mudrā'' position in the Buddha's lap. This ''mudrā'' is called in [[Pali|Pāḷi]] and [[Sanskrit]] "calling the earth to witness (to his fulfilment of the perfections, [[parami|pāramī]]). In Thai it is known as "Buddha subduing [[Mara (demon)|Māra]]" (the demon who tried to prevent him attaining enlightenment by various means). This is by far the most commonly depicted ''mudrā''.
*Meditation (''Dhyāna mudrā'') [[:th:ปางสมาธิ]] ''pang sà-măa-tí'': the hands are shown lying flat in the Buddha's lap, palms upward. This ''mudrā'' is associated with a seated Buddha. It shows that the Buddha is disciplining his mind through mental concentration, a necessary step to achieving enlightenment.
*Charity (''Varana mudrā'') [[:th:ปางประทานพร]] ''pang bprà-taan pon'': the right arm is shown pendent (extended downwards), with the open palm turned to the front and the fingers extended. This ''mudrā'' is usually associated with a standing Buddha. This position can signify either that the Buddha is granting blessings or receiving charitable offerings.
*Fearlessness (''Abhāya mudrā'') [[:th:ปางประทานอภัย]] ''pang bprà-taan à-pai'': either one or both arms are shown bent at the elbow and the wrist, with the palm facing outwards and the fingers pointing upwards. It shows the Buddha either displaying fearlessness in the face of adversity, or enjoining others to do so. Right hand raised is also called "calming animals" [[:th:ปางโปรดสัตว์]] ''pang pròht sàt''; both hands raised is also called "forbidding the relatives" [[:th:ปางห้ามญาติ]] ''pang ham yat''. These '''mudrā'' are usually associated with a standing Buddha, but seated representations are not uncommon.

[[Image:Buddhaimage6.JPG|thumb|250px|Statue of "the Buddha preaching on reason," with the Buddha's hands in the double ''abhāya mudrā'' position (Luang Phrabāng, Laos)]]
*Reasoning and exposition (''Vitarka mudrā''): the arm and hand are positioned in the same manner as in the ''abhāya mudrā'', except that the thumb and forefinger are brought together. The gesture can be made with either the right or left hand (usually the right), but not both. This mudra signifies an appeal to reason, or the giving of instruction. Since the Buddha is appealing to reason, the gesture is often interpreted as an appeal for peace.
*Setting the wheel in motion (''Dharmachakrā mudrā''): the hands are held in front of the chest, with both hands in the ''vitarka mudrā'' position, with the fingers of the left hand resting in the palm of the right hand. This is a less common ''mudrā'' since it refers to a particular episode in the Buddha's life: his first sermon, when he "set the wheel (of his life's work) in motion." It can be used for both seated and standing images.

Over the centuries combinations and variations of these six ''mudrā'' have evolved. For example, the "double ''abhāya mudrā''", with both hands held up in the ''abhāya mudrā'' position, became common in Thailand and Laos in the 16th century, and is now one of the most common representations of the Buddha in south-east Asian countries. It is sometimes interpreted as "Buddha teaching on reason." As artists wished to depict more of the specific incidents in the life of the Buddha, new, secondary ''mudrās'' evolved, such as "Buddha holding an alms bowl", "Buddha receiving a mango" and Buddha performing various miracles. Many of these originated in [[Burma]] and then spread to other parts of the Buddhist world.

{{Islam by country}}
'''[[Islam]]''' is a minority religion in the [[Solomon Islands]]. The religion first entered the country in 1987, when a [[Ghana]]ian missionary belonging to the [[Ahmadiyya]] movement visited [[Guadalcanal]] island on a reconnaissance trip lasting three years. Today, there are two major denominations in the country - [[Ahmadiyya|Ahmadi Muslims]] and [[Sunni Muslims]].&lt;ref name="Melanesia"&gt;{{cite journal | journal=[[Australian Journal of International Affairs]] | title=Muslims in Melanesia: putting security issues in perspective | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis | volume=62 | issue=3 | date=September 2008 | pages=408–429}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2007 report by the [[United States Department of State]]'s [[International Religious Freedom Report]], there are approximately 350 Muslims in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90154.htm | title= International Religious Freedom Report 2007: Solomon Islands | publisher=U.S. Department of State| accessdate=November 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, different reports suggest that there may be 1000 Ahmadi Muslims in the country alone.&lt;ref name="Melanesia"/&gt;

==Sub groups==

===Ahmadiyya===
Islam was first introduced by an Ahmadi Muslim missionary, Hafiz Jibrail from Ghana. He visited the country from 1987 for three years and managed to draw a handful of converts to Islam, after which he left for Ghana. The Community then continued to flourish and practice their faith for a period lasting over a decade, with no external contact from members of the international Ahmadiyya Muslim Community. In the years 2000 to 2005, the Community sent another missionary, as a result of which the Community grew to approximately 1000 members. The Community is headquartered in [[Honiara]], the capital of the Solomon Islands, and is present in the villages of Guadalcanal, [[Russell Islands|Russells]], [[Savo Island|Savo]] and [[Bellona Island|Bellona]] islands.&lt;ref name="Melanesia"/&gt;

===Sunni===
Sunni Muslims first entered the country in 1995 as a result of [[dawah]] efforts from members of the [[Tablighi Jamaat]]. Sunni Muslims have publicly differentiated from Ahmadi Muslims and claim to represent the 'true' orthodox Islam. The Community claims to have more members than the Ahmadiyya Community.&lt;ref name="Melanesia"/&gt;

'''''Israel's Messenger''''' ({{zh|s=以色列信使报|p=Yǐsèliè Xìnshǐbào}}), also known in Chinese as ''Youtai Yuebao'' ({{zh|s=犹太月报|l=''Jewish Monthly''}}), was an English-language newspaper published in [[Shanghai]] from 1904 to 1941. It was established by [[N.E.B. Ezra]], who served as the paper's Editor-in-Chief for more than 30 years until his death in 1936, as the official newspaper of the Shanghai Zionist Association. It was one of China's oldest and most sophisticated Jewish periodicals, which also influenced the Jewish press in India.

==History==
''Israel's Messenger'' was founded in 1904 by the [[Sephardi]] Jewish businessman [[Nissim Elias Benjamin Ezra]] (1883–1936) as the official mouthpiece of the Shanghai Zionist Association, which had been established by Ezra the year before.{{sfn|Bei Gao|2013|p=14}} Ezra served as the paper's Editor-in-Chief for more than 30 years until his death in 1936.{{sfn|Goldstein|1998|p=151}}{{sfn|Cesarani|2014|p=186}} In addition to promoting [[Zionism]], the paper reported on the activities of the Jewish communities in Shanghai and the rest of China, as well as world events. It was published fortnightly, and later monthly.{{sfn|Ristaino|2003|p=131}}

''Israel's Messenger'' was one of China's oldest and most sophisticated Jewish periodicals.{{sfn|Ristaino|2003|p=131}} It was also circulated in the United States, where it successfully positioned itself as the most authoritative Jewish voice from East Asia.{{sfn|Bei Gao|2013|p=90}} The chief editor of the newspaper and other Zionist scholars cooperated with [[Imperial Japan]]. Japanese military officer [[Koreshige Inuzuka]] said he tried to use the Jewish media, including ''Israel's Messenger'', to influence American opinion.{{sfn|Bei Gao|2013|p=90}} Owing to financial difficulties, publication was suspended between February 1910 and September 1918, but the paper survived until its final issue appeared on 17 October 1941.{{sfn|Goldstein|1998|p=252}}

The newspaper influenced the Jewish press in India. The Sargon brothers (Benjamin, Joseph, and David) of [[Bombay]], who were nephews of N.E.B. Ezra, grew up reading ''Israel's Messenger''. Greatly influenced by Ezra's journalistic concepts, the brothers edited the ''Jewish Advocate'' (later renamed the ''Jewish Tribune'') in the 1930s, bringing it to a much higher level of professionalism than the older Jewish newspapers of Bombay.{{sfn|Goldstein|1998|p=151}}

'''Karkota Empire''' (c. 625 - 885 CE) was a major power from the [[Indian subcontinent]]; which originated in the region of [[Kashmir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=OjT4BQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA40&amp;dq=Karko%E1%B9%ADa%20Empire&amp;pg=PA40#v=onepage&amp;q=Karko%E1%B9%ADa%20Empire&amp;f=false|title=Life in India, Issue 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded by Durlabhvardhana during the lifetime of [[Harshavardhan]]. The dynasty marked the rise of Kashmir as a power in [[Northern India]].&lt;ref&gt;Kalhana (1147-1149); Rajatarangini.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Avanti Varman (Utpala dynasty)|Avanti Varman]] ascended the throne of Kashmir on 855 A.D., establishing the [[Utpala dynasty]] and ending the rule of Karkota dynasty.&lt;ref name="Reign"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ancient Indian History and Civilization|first=Sailendra Nath|last=Sen|publisher=New Age International|year=1999|page=295|isbn=978-8122-411-98-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lalitaditya Muktapida]], the dynasty's strongest ruler captured parts of [[Central Asia]], [[Afghanistan]] and [[Punjab]] with Chinese help.{{sfn|Wink|2002|p=243}} According to [[Kalhana]]'s ''[[Rajatarangini]]'', Lalitaditya was able to extend the power of Kashmir beyond the normal mountain limits and in about 740 AD inflicted a defeat upon [[Yashovarman]], the King of [[Kannauj]]. Lalitaditya was able to vanquish the Turks, Tibetans, Bhutias, Kambojas and others.

The Karkota emperors were primarily [[Hindu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.koausa.org/Temples/martand.html |title= Prominent Holy Places in Kashmir|author=Kamlesh Moza}}&lt;/ref&gt; They built spectacular Hindu temples in their capital [[Parihaspur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Animals in stone: Indian mammals sculptured through time  By Alexandra Anna Enrica van der Geer|pages=Ixx|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oQ3quxh9gsgC&amp;pg=PR70 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=India-Pakistan Relations with Special Reference to Kashmir  By Kulwant Rai Gupta|pages=35|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mksji5FVKwsC&amp;pg=PA35 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They however also allowed Buddhism to flourish under them. Stupa, Chaitya and Vihara can be found in the ruins of their capital. [[Martand Sun Temple]] in the [[Anantnag district]] were built by Lalitaditya. It is the oldest known Sun temple in India and was also one of the biggest temple complexes at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yVft0FqSxc0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Karko%E1%B9%ADa+Empire&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjS9Le51bHKAhXDdT4KHUMkAT0Q6AEINjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=karkota&amp;f=false|title=The Hindu-Buddhist Sculpture of Ancient Kashmir and its Influences}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kerista''' was a [[utopian community]] that was started in [[New York City]] in 1956 by John Peltz "Bro Jud" Presmont. Throughout much of its history, Kerista was centered on the ideals of [[polyfidelity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.kerista.com/poly.html |title = Polyfidelity - description of a new type of family structure: |accessdate = 2011-03-12 |last = Furchgott |first = Eve}}&lt;/ref&gt; and creation of [[Intentional community|intentional communities]]. Kerista underwent several incarnations that later became known as the "Old Tribe," which was associated with a fairly large, but fluid membership. What was called the "New Tribe," a period of more stable membership and ideology, began in 1971 based in the [[Haight Ashbury]] district of San Francisco.&lt;ref name="Miller 1999 pp. 134-5"&gt;{{cite book |last=Miller |first=Timothy |authorlink=Timothy Miller |title=The 60s communes : hippies and beyond |publisher=Syracuse University Press |publication-place=Syracuse, NY |year=1999 |isbn=9780815605508 |id={{oclc|249089620|45730879}} |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wVLu4F1aOgcC&amp;pg=PA134#v=twopage&amp;q&amp;f=false |pages=134-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founding==
Kerista was founded by John Presmont after an auditory-hallucination telling him that he was the founder of the next great religion of the world. After time spent in New York in the 50's, and several island experiments in Dominica, Honduras and Belize in the 60's, Jud settled in San Francisco at the end of the 60's.

==Old Tribe==
Kerista-inspired storefronts and communal houses existed in New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco Bay Area throughout the 60's, and was moderately popular. The ideology shared by the Old Tribe was remarkably simple: 'Wash your own dish', 'No one belongs to anyone else', 'Kerista is freedom and love'. The main tenets of the Old Tribe embody the [[hippie]] ideals of 'good vibes' and the 'righteous high', racial and sexual liberation, and a strong tendency towards dropping out of the straight-world and living a non-conformist life of idealism, spontaneity, and fun. In addition, Old Tribers started the use of a Ouija-board for wisdom and guidance, and use of the 'alphabet-board' continued in the New Tribe.

One division occurred in the Old Tribe over the Vietnam War. Jud was a patriotic WWII ex-soldier, and he supported US military intervention. However, the vast majority of the Old Tribe were anti-war. Jud's pro-military beliefs were unpopular in leftist circles, and regularly surprised visitors who expected Jud to be left-of-center.

==New Tribe==
From 1971 until 1991, the community was centered at the '''Kerista Commune''' (not a single physical building), founded in the [[Haight Ashbury]] district of [[San Francisco, California]]. The Keristans maintained a very high profile which included publication of a popular free newspaper and several national media appearances.&lt;ref name="Knull 2005"&gt;{{cite web |last=Knull |first=Roger |title=My Brief Encounter with Kerista; An Outsider's Account |website=Kerista.commune |date=2005-11-23 |url=http://www.kerista.com/nonspeak/rio.html |access-date=2018-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When it was active, Kerista  was a focal point for people interested in alternative and non-monogamous lifestyles. The terms [[polyfidelity]] and [[compersion]] were coined at the Kerista Commune. The commune developed an entire vocabulary around alternative lifestyles—for example their term polyintimacy in their literature was similar to the term popularized as [[polyamory]] years later.  Entrance to the commune was extremely selective and included a 6-month waiting period and a screening for [[Sexually transmitted infection|STDs]].{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

===Social contract standards===
Kerista accumulated a codified social contract over its history that all members were expected to agree and comply with, at all times&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://communalsocieties.hamilton.edu/islandora/object/hamLibCom:5736#page/1/mode/1up|title=Basic 17 standards {{!}} Communal Societies|website=communalsocieties.hamilton.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Starting with a few unwritten rules in 1971 to 26 standards&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.kerista.com/kerdocs/26.html |title = Utopian Social Contract of Kerista Village |accessdate = 2018-01-12 |date = 1979 |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1979, the social contract evolved to 84 standards &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.kerista.com/kerdocs/84.html |title = Social Contract of the Gestalt-O-Rama Do-It-With-Friends Mental Health System |accessdate = 2018-01-12 |last = Eve |first = Even |date = 1984 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by 1983. There were over 100 standards in 1991. 

Examples from the 84 Standards include:
* Total Rationality at All Times
* Search for Truth through the Elimination of Contradictions
* No Jealousy, No Anger, No Rivalry, No Sexism, No Ageism, No Racism, No Classism, No Duplicity, No Alienation, No Profanity, No Flippancy
* Social Tolerance, Equality, Verbality, Participatory Democracy, Accountability, Conviviality, Graceful Distancing
* Positive Attitude towards the ‘Toggle-Switch’ Mode of Decision-Making
* There is One and only One Objective Reality

===Gestalt-O-Rama / Utopian Psychology===

Kerista used a [[Group dynamics|group process]] called Gestalt-O-Rama, loosely taken from [[Fritz Perls]]' concept of [[Gestalt therapy|gestalt]] ("enhanced awareness of sensation, perception, bodily feelings, emotion, and behavior, in the present moment.") For Keristans, gestalt consisted of a lot of conversation in groups. Maintaining personal 'resolve-on-the-lifestyle', a euphemism for being aligned with the social contract, was a daily task for many Keristans. Being 'unresolved-on-the-lifestyle', even momentarily or temporarily,  was worthy of immediate gestalt and possible expulsion from the family or commune.  Practically, a member could be "called out" on any standards violation or non-utopian thought or action by anyone at any time.

===Publications===

Kerista produced [[zine]]s that included [[drawing]]s and [[comics]]. Some concerned day-to-day life. Others presented a lighthearted [[polytheism|polytheistic]] [[mythology]] which revolved around a pantheon of benevolent and technologically adept goddesses and gods. The comic Far Out West, written by one of the founders Eve "Even Eve" Furchgott, claimed to be "The First Utopian Comic Strip."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://comixjoint.com/faroutwest.html|title=Far Out West at Comixjoint.com|website=comixjoint.com|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Features presented in the zine included articles and essays concerning life within the community and their proposed World Plan to establish a functional [[Utopia]]n society on a larger scale. The volume of publications and art work produced by Kerista Commune was quite a bit greater than other groups that were active in the Haight Ashbury during this period.{{Citation needed|reason=Unsupported assertion|date=July 2017}} Kerista claimed singer [[Joan Jett]] as the "Matron Saint" of their community.&lt;ref name="Bull 1989"&gt;{{Cite journal |url={{Google books|h-bxxO5B-xsC|page=122|plainurl=yes}} |first=Bart |last=Bull |authorlink=Bart Bull |title='Saint Joan' |work=SPIN magazine |access-date=2018-08-20 |date=April 1989 |volume=5 |issue=1 |page=122 |issn=0886-3032 |oclc=1001994059}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Work Life / Abacus===

The Keristans shared income and could choose whether to have outside paying jobs or work within the community (which operated several businesses, a legally incorporated church, and an educational non-profit organization)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://communalsocieties.hamilton.edu/islandora/object/hamLibCom:6051#page/1/mode/1up|title=An introduction to utopianism {{!}} Communal Societies|website=communalsocieties.hamilton.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The most successful of the businesses was Abacus, Inc., an early Macintosh computer vendor in San Francisco, which eventually offered a variety of computer hardware, training and services. At its height, Abacus employed over 250 people and had offices in five major California cities. Voted the 33rd and 42nd fastest-growing privately held company in America by [[Inc. (magazine)|Inc. Magazine]] in 1990 and 1991 respectively, Abacus achieved revenues in excess of $25 million per year. Prior to Apple Computer Corporation abandoning the Value-Added Reseller in 1992, Abacus was the top reseller of Macintosh computers in the Bay Area in 1991.

===Membership===

The official{{according to whom|date=December 2017}} website lists 44 people as having joined Kerista at various times during the community's history, though more than this number passed through briefly. The commune population numbered 5 at founding in 1971, and numbered 25 at dissolution in 1991. Before dissolution, there were closer to 30 Keristans in residence.

The commune maintained a very active program of social events and Gestalt-o-rama rap groups, which were open to the public 3-4 nights a week, and were mandatory for Keristans to regularly attend.  The commune functioned a lot like a religious order and was an important focal point for a larger community of people in San Francisco interested in alternative lifestyles. The events sponsored by Kerista were almost always free and non-commercial.

In 1979 and 1980, two children were born in the community. Beginning in 1983, the adult male Keristans had vasectomies to deal with birth control and address global population issues. All male members subsequently had the requirement of having a vasectomy within a set period of time after joining the community.

===Family Life / Polyfidelity / Sleeping Schedule===

The family structure of Kerista was composed of fidelitous groups called B-FICs (Best-Friend Identity Clusters). Keristans practiced non-preferential polyfidelity. Polyfidelity requires consensus to accept a new person into the group, either a man or woman.

Non-preferentiality was an important concept of Keristan polyfidelity, and had lofty goals but was more intended to keep people from coupling-up. Non-preferentiality proved very difficult to achieve. Keristans had a transitional celibacy period after joining a group of three months, sometimes waived.

A single B-FIC was composed of men and women who rotated sleeping with all of the opposite-sex members on a balanced rotational sleeping schedule. The sleeping-schedule assigned each family member to sleep with a different opposite-sex partner each night. Since the BFICs were rarely balanced between men and women (typically more women than men), on any given night several family-members would have no partner to sleep with and were assigned a 'Zero-Night' - when they slept alone. In addition to the programmed sleeping schedule, it was permitted to sleep with any opposite-sex family-member at any time, which was termed a 'freebie'.

===Jud as leader===

Jud exerted clear leadership and unparalleled influence over the daily life and direction of the commune and its members. He was a highly verbal and charismatic man, and had boundless confidence in his own opinion. As the oldest Keristan with many marriages and communal experiments behind him, he often dominated commune discussions. Jud typically got into fights with famous people who came to visit or study Kerista, like Steve Gaskin from The Farm, Mario Savio from the Berkeley Free Speech Movement, and the researcher Robert Weiss.

===Criticism===
After an arranged visit to Kerista by three professors, the New Tribe was criticized for not being egalitarian, notably in Bro Jud's dominance of many commune matters.&lt;ref name="Fellowship for Intentional Community: Tale of Two Communes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ic.org/wiki/tale-two-communes-scholar-errors/|title=Tale of Two Communes: A Scholar and His Errors|last=Cummings|first=Michael|website=Fellowship for Intentional Community|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same professors questioned whether Kerista was feminist, and whether Kerista made only token contributions to philanthropy.&lt;ref name="Fellowship for Intentional Community: Tale of Two Communes" /&gt; A separate dissertation, written by an ex-Keristan, argued that Jud was not the primary problem, and instead criticized Kerista for institutionalizing '...a fetish for purity', describing 'the core psychological process in Kerista was anxiety-producing and ultimately destructive because it centered around the toxic value of purity, which made the commune a bad place to live.'&lt;ref name="Hamelin 2015"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hamelin |first=Lawrence |title=And To No More Settle For Less Than Purity: Reflections on the Kerista Commune |website=Academia.edu |date=2015-08-03 |url=https://www.academia.edu/4897458/And_To_No_More_Settle_For_Less_Than_Purity_Reflections_on_the_Kerista_Commune |publisher=University of Colorado at Denver|access-date=2018-06-27 |pages=57-73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dissolution==

In November 1991, Bro Jud left the Purple Submarine and the Kerista Commune after sharp divisions were exposed within the membership. Conflicts between Abacus and Kerista had grown more acute, as Abacus became more successful and difficult to manage. Other issues discussed during dissolution include allowing less-religious people into the commune and the loosening of superfluous rules.
 
After many incidents with members beginning to confront Jud's behavior, Jud left Purple and Kerista. Within a few months, the community was dissolved by vote. Bro Jud went on to create ''The World Academy of Keristan Education''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.guidestar.org/profile/94-3161422 |title = World Academy of Keristan Education, Inc. |accessdate = 2018-01-12 |date=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Several former members of the commune still live in the San Francisco Bay Area, while a number moved to Hawaii and purchased a block of adjoining parcels of land.

John (Bro Jud) Presmont died on December 13, 2009 in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.kerista.com/ |title = Kerista.commune - Historical Home of the Kerista Commune: |accessdate = 2011-03-12 |quote = John Peltz Presmont passed from this life on Sunday Dec 13, 2009, in San Francisco, CA.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his last years, Jud had been seen regularly on 'The Bro Jud Show' on San Francisco [[public-access television]] [[cable TV]].

==Kerista, Robert A. Heinlein, and ''Stranger in a Strange Land''==
Science-fiction author [[Robert A. Heinlein]], in a 1966 letter to his agent [[Lurton Blassingame]], mentioned Kerista in connection with his 1961 novel ''[[Stranger in a Strange Land]]'':
''{{quotation|I recently learned that it was considered the "New Testament" — and compulsory reading — of a far-out cult called "Kerista." (Kee-''rist''!).  I don't know exactly what "Kerista" is, but its L.A. chapter offered me $100 to speak. (I turned them down.)&lt;ref name="Heinlein Heinlein 1990"&gt;{{cite book |last=Heinlein |first=Robert A |authorlink=Robert A.

The person who invited Heinlein to speak may have been [[Kerry Thornley]], co-founder of [[Discordianism]], who at the time lived in [[Watts, Los Angeles|Watts]]. Thornley had joined Kerista in 1966 and was known{{by whom|date=December 2017}} to be a lifelong science-fiction fan.&lt;ref name="Cusack 2010"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cusack |first=Carole |title=Invented religions : imagination, fiction and faith |publisher=Ashgate |publication-place=Farnham, Surrey, England; Burlington, VT |year=2010 |isbn=9780754693604 |oclc=694146872 |url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/invented-religions-imagination-fiction-and-faith/oclc/694146872/viewport}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''{{quote|Kerista's polyamorous sexual practice was influenced, as was that of the Church of All Worlds, by Robert A. Heinlein's (1907-88) science-fiction novel ''Stranger in a Strange Land'' (1961), in which the Martian-raised human Michael Valentine Smith founded The Church of All Worlds, preached sexual freedom and the truth of all religions, and is martyred by narrow-minded people who are not ready for freedom.&lt;ref name="Cusack 2010"/&gt;}}''

&lt;!-- no stated source; WP is not a soapbox: 
==Critique of the Kerista Commune==

It was obvious to many{{how many}} that the professed egalitarianism of Kerista did not apply to Jud, and that Jud was Kerista's prophet and leader. While this did not result in a different standard of living from other Keristans, Jud had special privileges that few Keristans shared. For example, it was rare for a Keristan to overtly disagree with Jud, instead Keristans more-often acted as apologists for Jud's words and behavior, even when Jud was breaking a commune standard. Jud was intensely active with many member's (and prospective member's) personal lives: including BFIC issues, relations with a member's biological family, their individual psychology, and commune work-assignments. --&gt;

'''Khatri''' is a [[caste]] from the northern [[Indian subcontinent]]. Khatris in India and [[Pakistan]] are mostly from the [[Punjab region]].

Khatris played an important role in India's trans regional trade during the [[Mughal Empire]].&lt;ref name="Gijsbert_Disaporas_2007"&gt;{{cite book |title=Global Indian diasporas |author=Gijsbert Oonk |publisher=Amsterdam University Press |year=2007 |page=43 |isbn=978-90-5356-035-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; They adopted administrative and military roles outside the Punjab region as well.&lt;ref name="John_Kingship_2002"&gt;{{cite book |title=Land and Local Kingship in Eighteenth-Century Bengal |author=John R.

&lt;/ref&gt;

All the [[Sikh Gurus]] were Khatris.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia_Sikhism_2000"&gt;{{cite book |title=The encyclopedia of Sikhism |author=H. S Singha |page=125 |isbn=978-81-7010-301-1 |publisher=Hemkunt Press |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and varna status==
Khatris consider themselves to be of pure [[Vedic]] descent and thus superior to the [[Rajput]]s, who also claim [[Kshatriya]] status. Their standards of literacy and caste status were such during the early years of the [[Sikh]] community that, according to [[W. H. McLeod]], they dominated it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Syan |first=Hardip Singh |year=2013 |title=Sikh Militancy in the Seventeenth Century: Religious Violence in Mughal and Early Modern India |publisher=I.

However, by the time of [[Company rule in India|British arrival]] in India, the Khatris were mostly merchants and scribes. Khatris sources explain this transition as follows: the Mughal emperors terminated the services of Khatris chieftains for moving against the imperial order of widow remarriage.&lt;ref&gt;Syan, Hardip Singh (2013).

Jones quoted that "the Khatris claimed with some justice and increasing insistence, the status of Rajputs, or Kshatriyas, a claim not granted by those above but illustrative of their ambiguous position on the great varna scale of class divisions" &lt;ref name="Kenneth_Hindu"&gt;{{cite book |title=Arya dharm: Hindu consciousness in 19th-century Punjab |author=Kenneth W.

The Khatris of Gujarat and Rajasthan are said to have tailoring skills like "Darji" (tailor) caste.&lt;ref&gt;Indian settlers: the story of a New Zealand South Asian community, p48, Jacqueline Leckie, Otago University Press, 2000/ quote :"Tailoring was a caste occupation that continued in New Zealand by those from Darji and Khatri castes who had been trained in appropriate skills. Bhukandas Masters, a Khatri, emigrated to New Zealand in 1919. He practised as tailor in central Auckland..."&lt;/ref&gt; Dasrath Sharma described Khatris as a mixed ''pratiloma'' caste of low ritual status but suggested that Khatris could be a mixed caste born of Kshatriya fathers and [[Brahmin]] mothers.&lt;ref&gt;Early Chauhān dynasties: a study of Chauhān political history, Chauhān political institutions, and life in the Chauhān dominions, from 800 to 1316 A.D.,  Dasharatha Sharma, p 279, Motilal Banarsidass, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
There are different versions on history of khatris. One of the versions describes that khatris played an important role in India's trans regional trade under the [[Mughal Empire]].&lt;ref name="Gijsbert_Disaporas_2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scott_Diaspora_2002"/&gt; With the patronage of Mughal nobles, the Khatris adopted administrative and military roles outside the Punjab region. According to a 19th-century Khatri legend, the Khatris followed the military profession until the time of the Mughal emperor [[Aurangzeb]]. Several Khatris were killed during the Aurangzeb's Deccan Campaign, and the emperor ordered their widows to be remarried. When the Khatris refused to obey this order, Aurangzeb terminated their military service, and directed them to be shopkeepers and brokers.&lt;ref name="John_Kingship_2002"/&gt; The other version says that the Khatri were engaged in the weaving of silk saris in ancient time period, and subsequently some of them became merchants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Singh, Kumar Suresh|year=1998|title=India's Communities, volume 2 H–M|series=People of India, Anthropological Survey of India|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New Delhi, India|pages=1722, 1729|isbn=978-0-19-563354-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In the All-India meeting of [[Arora]]s in 1936, held by the Khatris at Lahore (Pakistan), it was decided that the Aroras, Soods and Bhatias were Khatri for all intents and purposes.  And, as such, they should be admitted to the Khatri stock.  This interpretation did not find much favour then, but with the lapse of time, it has almost been accepted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://punjabrevenue.nic.in/gaz_hsp4.htm Chapter Iii&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hindu Khatris===
The vast majority of Khatris are Hindu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |author= Gopal Krishan|date= |title= Demography of the Punjab (1849-1947)|url= http://www.global.ucsb.edu/punjab/sites/secure.lsit.ucsb.edu.gisp.d7_sp/files/sitefiles/journals/volume11/no1/6_krishan.pdf|publisher= UCSB|page= 83|access-date= 2018-09-24|quote= "Conversion was negligible from the higher castes such as Brahmins, Aroras, Khatris and Aggarwals."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Hindu Khatris migrated to India after partition and settled in urban areas across India. They were estimated to constitute 9% of the total population of Delhi in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.india-seminar.com/2004/534/534%20sanjay%20kumar.htm|title=534 Sanjay Kumar, A tale of three cities|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sikh Khatris===
All the ten [[Sikh Gurus]] were Khatris.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia_Sikhism_2000"/&gt; Guru Nanak was a Bedi, Guru Angad was a [[Trehan]], Guru Amar Das was a [[Bhalla (tribe)|Bhalla]], and the rest of the Gurus were [[Sodhi]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The A to Z of Sikhism |author=W. H. McLeod |publisher=Scarecrow Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-8108-6828-1 |page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the lifetime of the Gurus, most of their major supporters and Sikhs were Khatris. A list of this is provided by a contemporary of the Sikh Gurus, [[Bhai Gurdas]], in his ''[[Varan Bhai Gurdas]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Bhai Gurdas ''Ji'', Varan Bhai Gurdas Ji, Vaar 8&amp;nbsp;– Pauri 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Khatris influential in the history of Sikhism include:

* [[Bhai Daya Singh]], the first of the [[Panj Pyare]] (the initial members of the [[Khalsa]]), belonged to the Sobti clan of the Khatris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Sikhs in history: a millenium study, with new afterwords |author=Sangat Singh |publisher=Uncommon Books |year=2001 |isbn=978-81-900650-2-3 |page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Hari Singh Nalwa]] (1791–1837), the Commander-in-chief of the Khalsa army of the Sikh Empire.

===Muslim Khatris===
The [[Muslim Khatris]] are originally from Hindu Khatri community who had converted to [[Islam]]. In western districts of the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] ([[Sargodha]], [[Mianwali]], [[Multan]], [[Jhang]], [[Chakwal]], [[Rawalpindi]] and [[Faislabad]]), converted Khatri traders called themselves [[Khawaja]]. Some times they are called [[Punjabi Shaikh|Khawaja Sheikh]].

'''Koreshanity''' is the set of religious/pseudo-scientific beliefs put forth by [[Cyrus Teed]] (also known as Koresh). Followers of this belief were called "Koreshans", and most of them formed a [[utopia]]n communal society called the [[Koreshan Unity]].

==Main beliefs==
The main beliefs of Koreshanity, or ''Koreshan Universalogy'', are put forth in the many writings of [[Cyrus Teed]] and his followers. They are:

* [[File:Model of the universe according to the Koreshans..JPG|thumb|Model of the universe according to Koreshan beliefs]] ''Cellular Cosmogony'', which is Teed's unique form of [[Hollow Earth theory]] which puts forth the idea that the [[Earth]] and [[universe]] are contained within a concave sphere, or 'cell'.  The Koreshans even conducted several experiments, similar to those conducted by believers in a [[Flat Earth]].  The most well known was conducted on the beach of [[Naples, Florida]] (the Koreshan Geodetic Survey of 1897), a town south of the [[Koreshan Unity]] commune at [[Estero, Florida]].  Here is the description of the earth from ''Cellular Cosmogony'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;The [[sun]] is an invisible [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] [[battery (electricity)|battery]] revolving in the [[universe]]'s center on a 24-year cycle. Our visible sun is only a reflection, as is the [[moon]], with the [[star]]s reflecting off seven [[Mercury (element)|mercurial]] discs that float in the sphere's center. Inside the earth there are three separate [[atmosphere]]s: the first composed of [[oxygen]] and [[nitrogen]] and closest to the earth; the second, a [[hydrogen]] atmosphere above it; the third, an aboron (sic) atmosphere at the center. The earth's shell is one hundred miles thick and has seventeen layers. The outer seven are metallic with a gold rind on the outermost layer, the middle five are mineral and the five inward are geologic strata. Inside the shell there is life, outside a void.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* ''Koreshan Premise'', A straight line extended at right angles from a perpendicular post will meet the surface of the earth at a distance proportionate to the height of the perpendicular.

==Other beliefs==
* [[Reincarnation]], the belief that people are reborn.
* [[Immortality]], the belief people will not die.
* [[Celibacy]], the belief of abstaining from any [[Human sexuality|sexual conduct]], which they felt was a scientific method to obtain immortality. 
* [[Collectivism]], the community lived communally, with everyone sharing in the work without being paid.  This began with the first [[commune (intentional community)|commune]] in Chicago, leading to them moving to Estero and building their "New Jerusalem".
* [[Alchemy]], which was an area that Teed had experimented in for years.
* Teed's [[revelation|inspired]] leadership. Teed claimed to be the 'seventh' [[messiah|messianic]] leader ([[Jesus]] was the sixth).

==Koreshan settlement==
[[File:Dr. Teed's House.JPG|thumb|Dr. Teed's House]]  Teed proposed the creation of a "[[New Jerusalem]]" as an ideal commune for his followers, to be located on the Mississippi river.  In 1894 Teed moved to Florida where he accumulated land for yet another community.  He was influenced, according to historian [[Robert S. Fogarty]], by [[Emanuel Swedenborg]], as was [[Thomas Lake Harris]], and these ideas helped craft his own notion of a "new spiritual heaven…called New Jerusalem.".&lt;ref&gt;Robert S. Fogarty, ''All Things New'', page 81&lt;/ref&gt; Teed shows the degree to which the concept of 'New Jerusalem' not only translated into the ideal of creating a heavenly place on earth but the re-labeling of heaven to constitute a New Jerusalem up above.&lt;ref&gt;Fogarty, All Things, page 77&lt;/ref&gt;
The day to day affairs of the settlement were governed by a council of women called "The Seven Sisters." The Seven Sisters lived in a common house referred to as The Planetary Court.

Prior to the death of the last Koreshan the settlement was deeded to the state of [[Florida]] and is now a state historic site. In addition to the historic buildings of the settlement the state park includes canoeing on the Estero river which flows directly next to the settlement as well as the presence of many [[gopher tortoise]]s who make their burrows throughout the park.

==Major works of Koreshanity==

* Cyrus Teed ''Cellular Cosmogony, or, the Earth a Concave Sphere''.  Originally published in 1905, later reprinted in 1975.  Gives the 'scientific' proofs of a concave earth, and details of their Naples experiment.
* Cyrus Teed ''Immortal Manhood''.  Published in 1902, details the relationship of man with God.  The work, along with Cellular Cosmogony, are considered the pivotal works in Koreshan teachings.
* A.W.K. Andrews.  ''The Identification of Israel''. 1882.  Gives the basis for their beliefs in [[reincarnation]] and its importance in building their "New Jerusalem".
* Koreshan Foundation.  ''Koreshanity: the New Age Religion''.  1971.  A fairly recent reprint of 4 works by Teed and J. Augustus Weimar.  Covers their beliefs in [[reincarnation]], male-female duality of God, messianic prophecy, and more.
* Ulysses Morrow.  ''Scientific Experiments on Lake Michigan''.  1899.  Details their first experiments to prove a concave sphere.

==Etymology==
The name comes from the Sanskrit words ''Kurma'' (कूर्म, Kūrma) meaning "turtle" or "tortoise"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ashtangayoga.info/practice/asana-vinyasa-series/primary-series-yoga-chikitsa/item/kurmasana/ | title = Kurmasana - AshtangaYoga.info | accessdate = 2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Asana'' (आसन, Āsana) meaning "posture" or "seat".&lt;ref name="Sinha1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sinha|first=S.C.|title=Dictionary of Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-zzRvh1fRzEC&amp;pg=PA18|accessdate=9 April 2011|date=1 June 1996|publisher=Anmol Publications PVT. LTD.|isbn=978-81-7041-293-9|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

To enter kūrmāsana a practitioner sits with the legs outstretched, feet as wide apart as possible. The knees are bent slightly, keeping the heels in contact with the floor. The body is leaned forward from the hips and the hands slid under the knees. The body leans forward (bending at the hips) to allow the hands and arms to slide sideways and backward (under the knees) until the elbows lie near the back of the knees. The heels are pushed forward and legs are straightened as much as possible. The forehead or chin is brought to touch the floor. The arms are further brought around the back to interlock the hands under the buttocks.{{sfn|Saraswati|1996|p=328}}

==Variations==
Variations of Kūrmāsana include:
*Supta Kūrmāsana(Sleeping Tortoise Pose)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ashtangayoga.info/practice/asana-vinyasa-series/primary-series-yoga-chikitsa/item/supta-kurmasana/ | title = Supta Kurmasana - AshtangaYoga.info | accessdate = 2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Tenzin Lopen Namdak.jpg|thumb|[[Lopon|Lopön]] Tenzin Namdak, [[abbot]] of a [[Bon]] monastery in [[Nepal]]]]
{{Bon}}

[[Lopon|Lopön]] '''Tenzin Namdak''' ({{bo|t=སློབ་དཔོན་བསྟན་འཛིན་རྣམ་དག|w=slob dpon bstan 'dzin rnam dag}}, born 1926 in Khyungpo Karu - {{bo|w=khyung po dkar ru}} - in [[Kham]]) is a Tibetan [[clergy|religious leader]] and the most senior teacher of [[Bon]], in particular of [[Dzogchen]] and the [[Anuttarayoga Tantra#Mother Tantras|Mother Tantras]].

== Early life ==
Tenzin Namdak's father was a farmer in [[Chamdo]] and his uncle, Kelzang Tsültrim ({{bo|w=bskal bzang tshul khrims}}), was the "chant leader" ({{bo|w=oM mdzad}}) among the [[bhikkhu|monks]] at Tengchen Monastery ({{bo|w=steng chen}}). The monastery belonged to the tradition of  Yungdrung Bön ({{bo|w=g.yung drung bon}}) rather than the New Bön tradition ({{bo|bon gsar ma}}) associated with [[Shardza Tashi Gyaltsen]], and had close affiliations with [[Menri Monastery]] and Yungdrung Monastery ({{bo|w=g,yung drung gling}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://treasuryoflives.org/institution/Yungdrung-Ling|title=གཡུང་དྲུང་གླིང་དགོན། - Yungdrung Ling|last=|first=|date=|work=The Treasury of Lives|access-date=2017-10-05|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in [[Ü-Tsang]].

In 1933, at age seven, Tenzin Namdak went to Tengchen and in 1941 he went to Yungdrung Monastery, where he helped execute a series of wall paintings for a new temple. In 1944 he went on pilgrimage to [[Nepal]] including Solu-Khombu, [[Pokhara]], [[Mustang District|Mustang]] and [[Kathmandu]].

In 1933 he returned to Yungdrung Monastery to commence studies in philosophy ({{bo|w=mtshan nyid}}). During 1945–50, he lived a principally [[hermit|eremitic]] existence, cloistered with his tutor and guru Gangru Tsültrim Gyeltsen ({{bo|w=sgang ru tshul khrims rgyal mtshan}}), with whom he studied poetry ({{bo|w=snyan ngag}}), cosmology ({{bo|w=mdzod phug}}), grammar ({{bo|w=sgra}}), monastic discipline ({{bo|w=dul ba}}) and the principal stages on the path to [[Bodhi|enlightenment]] ({{bo|w=sa lam}}).

In 1950, Tenzin Namdak went to Menri Monasteryin [[Ü-Tsang|Tsang]]. On the instruction of his teacher he commenced his studies. In 1953 he was elected to the position of [[lopon|lopön]] (head teacher) and received the degree of [[geshe]].

== Career ==

=== Professorship and retreat ===
Tenzin Namdak left Menri in 1959 due to increasing conflicts between the indigenous [[Tibetan people]] and the encroaching [[Communist Party of China|Han Chinese]] since the [[Battle of Chamdo]] in 1950. He went to Serzhig Monastery on Lake Dangra - a sacred lake for the Bonpo - in northern Tsang, where he remained in spiritual retreat until 1960.

=== Capture and escape ===

After the [[1959 Tibetan uprising]], many [[lama]]s, including the [[14th Dalai Lama]] and [[Rangjung Rigpe Dorje, 16th Karmapa]], along with numerous Tibetan refugees [[Tibetan diaspora|departed their homeland]] to seek refuge in [[India]] and [[Nepal]]. Riding this exodus, Tenzin Namdak tried to reach safety in India in 1960, but was shot and captured by Chinese Communist soldiers and imprisoned for ten months. He later escaped to Nepal via the small principality of Mustang.

=== Collaboration with Snellgrove/Hoffmann ===
While in [[Kathmandu]] in 1961, Tenzin Namdak was invited to London by his colleague, the English [[tibetology|tibetologist]] [[David Snellgrove]], through a [[Rockefeller Foundation]] grant, where he became a visiting scholar at [[SOAS, University of London]]. He resided for a period at the [[University of Cambridge]]. The collaboration with Snellgrove resulted in the publication of ''The Nine Ways of Bön'',&lt;ref name="Snellgrove1980"&gt;{{cite book|last=Snellgrove|first=David L.|title=The Nine Ways of Bon: Excerpts from gZi-brjid|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=aVM9AAAAIAAJ}}|date=1 January 1980|publisher=Prajñā Press|isbn=978-0-87773-739-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; which includes extracts translated from the esteemed ''Ziji'' ({{bo|w=gzi brjid}}, ''The Magnificence''), an extensive [[hagiography]] of the founder of Bon, [[Tonpa Shenrab Miwoche]]. This was the first scholarly study of the Yungdrung Bon tradition conducted in the West. He stayed in England for three years, until 1964.

In 1969 Tenzin Namdak made a second visit to Europe at the invitation of professor Helmut Hoffmann, where he was a visiting scholar at [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]], and with whom he collaborated on the ''Dictionary of Written Tibetan''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dr. Ellen Latzin |url=http://www.badw.de/orga/klassen/kl_phil/k_41_zos/index.html |title=Bayerische Akademie der Wissenschaften - Kommission für zentral- und ostasiatische Studien |publisher=Badw.de |date=2006-12-20 |accessdate=2014-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tibetan Bönpo Foundation ==
During those days a social worker named Dr keppler was working to help the Dorthang Bon community of Nepal. On the accusation of cow slaughter, he was deported from Nepal, but he wanted to continue his service towards the Bon community, since he knew that the Bon community in India was in a needful state and facing discrimination from other fellow Tibetans. The 32nd Menri Trizin,  head of Menri Monastery, had just died and his successor had not yet been appointed. There was no spiritual head of the Bonpos at that time, making it more difficult to contact the community. So through some searching and some information he got from some CTA officials, he met Tenzin Namdak in Delhi(Hauz Khas). There he discussed with Tenzin Namdak about the difficulty faced by the Bon community. Hence he made the blueprint of the Tibetan Bonpo foundation and Tenzin Namdak was suggested as the acting director. At that time Dr Keppler donated Rs 20000 INR for building a Bon monastery in future. Soon after Dr Kepplar arranged funds from the [[Catholic Relief Services]] for the Bonpos to purchase a land where they could rebuild their community. Dolanji was selected.

After difficulties in acquiring the land, Gungthang Tsultrim helped register the land for the organisation "Bod kyi Bonpo Tsokpa" by including Dolanji in the organisation called Tsokpa Chuksum, in which other settlements were registered, such as the Bir settlement in Himachal and Clement Town in Dehradhun etc. Dolanji, near [[Solan district|Solan]] in [[Himachal Pradesh]].

In 1967 the settlement was formally established and registered with the Indian Government under the name of the Tibetan Bönpo Foundation. About seventy families transferred there from [[Manali, Himachal Pradesh|Manali]] and each received a house and a small piece of land, the size depending on size of the family. The Tibetan Bönpo Foundation possessed its own constitution and administration. The Abbot of Menri acted as president. The new settlement at Dolanji was named Topgyel Sarpa ({{bo|w=thob rgyal gsar pa}}) after the village of Topgyel. Most of the inhabitants in the new settlement came from the [[Mount Kailash]] region and Upper Tsang in the west, and from [[Hor]], [[Kongpo]], [[Derge]] and [[Amdo]]([[Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture]]) in the east.

After the death of the abbot of Menri in 1963, Sherap Lodro, abbot of Yungdrung Ling, became the spiritual head of the Bön community in exile. Sherap Lodro came to Dolanji with a band of monks who founded a new monastic community. An intimate prayer chapel and a few small houses were built. In 1969 the successor to the abbot of Menri was established by lot and the office fell to Lungtok Tenpé Nyima ({{bo|w=lung rtogs bstan pa'i nyi ma}}), who was installed as the 33rd Menri Trizin.

Following the death of Yungdrung Ling abbot, Sangye Tenzin assumed the spiritual leadership of the Bönpos. More houses were established, along with a library and abbot's residence. Monastic life was structured around the [[prātimokṣa]] of the Yungdrung Bon [[vinaya]]. The foundation for the principal temple was inaugurated in 1969 and completed in 1978 and named Pel Shenten Menri Ling ({{bo|w=dpal gshen bstan sman ri'i gling}}). The complex was styled the Bönpo Monastic Centre and formed part of the Tibetan Bönpo Foundation.

From 1970-9, Tenzin Namdak continued writing and teaching while in residence at the Bönpo Monastic Centre. Concurrently, he was engaged in the publishing of significant Bönpo texts. From 1967, when the first monks came to Dolanji, teaching had been done by Lopön Sangye Tenzin, the former head teaching master at Menri, and assisted by Tenzin Namdak, who became his successor.

== Lama college and Bönpo monastery ==

When Sangye Tenzin died in 1968, Yongdzin was assigned responsibility for the education of the younger generation of monks. By 1978 a sufficient number of Bönpo texts had been published so that a curriculum could be organized around them. Thus a [[lama]]'s college (shedrup; ''bshad sgrub'') was established in 1978, organized under the guidance of Lopön Rinpoche who served as one of the two professors. The official name of the college is Yungdrung Bön Shedrup Lobnyer Dude (''gyung drung bon bshad sgrub slob gnyer 'dud sde'').

The purpose of the college at Dolanji was to preserve the tradition of philosophy established and developed at Yeru Wensaka (''gyas ru dben sa kha''), where philosophical analysis and [[logic]] were applied to the understanding of ''Do Ngag Semsum'' (''mdo sngags sems gsum''), that is, to the teachings of the [[Sūtra|Sutras]], the [[Tantras]] and [[Dzogchen]]. Unlike the [[Nyingma]]pa tradition, the Bönpos developed a system of logic and [[debate]] specifically relating to the Dzogchen teaching. At [[Menri]] in Tibet, all instruction in [[Tantra]] and [[Dzogchen]] was done in private except for the philosophy college where the monks studied the five scripture system Dozhung Nga (''mdo gzhung lnga'')

* Tsema (''tshad ma'') – [[Pramana]] or logic;
* Parchin (''phar phyin'') – [[Prajnaparamita]] or the Perfection of Wisdom Sutras;
* Uma (''dbu ma'') – [[Madhyamaka]] philosophy;
* Dzopu (''mdzod phug'') – [[Abhidharma]] or [[cosmology]];
* Dulwa ('''dul ba'') – [[Vinaya]] or monastic discipline.

However, in Dolanji students also study Tantra and Dzogchen in the college, as well as the five scriptural systems that pertain to [[Sutra]]. Also included in the curriculum are the secular [[sciences]] (''rignai''; ''rig gnas''), such as [[grammar]], [[poetics]], [[astrology]], and so on. The college has a nine-year term of studies that prepares the student for a degree in [[Geshe]]. The first group of young monks graduated in 1986.

Another Bönpo monastery and college known as Triten Norbutse (''khri brtan nor bu rtse''), located near [[Swayambhu]], west of Kathmandu, Nepal was established under Yongdzin's direction. In 2005 he founded in [[France]] the new bonpo Shenten Dargye Ling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://shenten.org/en/about/about-us |title=About us |publisher=Shenten.org |date= |accessdate=2014-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 he consecrated the [[stupa]] in Shenten Dargye Ling with Lungtok Tenpai Nyima, 33rd Abbot of Menri and consecrated in same year the Great Stupa in Chamma Ling, [[Valle de Bravo]], [[Mexico]] with Nyima and many bonpo teachers and Geshes.

== Third trip to The West ==

In 1989, Yongdzin traveled to England, [[Americas|America]] and Italy, at the invitation of the International Dzogchen Community of [[Chögyal Namkai Norbu]] Rinpoche in those countries. During his six-month trip he presented to interested Western students the Dzogchen teaching according to the Bönpo traditions of the Atri (''a khrid'') and the Zhang Zhung Nyengyu (''shang zhung snyan rgyud'').

In 1991, he visited Germany, England, the Netherlands and Italy. During his visit to these countries he spoke and taught on various [[meditation]] systems and fields of study of the Bön tradition. Later that year he was invited by the [[Dalai Lama]] to represent the Bön tradition at the [[Kalachakra]] [[Initiation]] in New York. In this way, Yongdzin spread Bönpo teachings in many countries. His permanent residences are in Kathmandu, France (Blou) and Dolanji.

Dowd's columns have been described as letters to her mother, whom friends credit as "the source, the fountain of Maureen's humor and her Irish sensibilities and her intellectual take."&lt;ref name="NYmag-dowd"/&gt; Dowd herself has said, "She is in my head in the sense that I want to inform and amuse the reader."&lt;ref name="freshdialogues.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freshdialogues.com/2009/04/03/maureen-dowd-talks-green/|title=Maureen Dowd talks green – from Emerald Isle to Eco-Issues|website=freshdialogues.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dowd's columns are distinguished by an acerbic, often [[polemical]] writing style.&lt;ref name="stiletto"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/04/AR2005110401996.html | title=Sex &amp;amp; the Single Stiletto | first=Howard | last=Kurtz | authorlink=Howard Kurtz | date=2005-10-05 | work=[[The Washington Post]] | pages=C01 | accessdate=2007-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her columns display a critical and irreverent attitude towards powerful, mostly political, figures such as former [[president of the United States|Presidents]] [[George W. Bush]] and [[Bill Clinton]]. Dowd also tends to refer to her subjects by nicknames. For example, she has often referred to Bush as "W." and former Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] as "Big Time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/08/opinion/liberties-west-wing-chaperone.html | title=Liberties; West Wing Chaperone | first=Maureen | last=Dowd | date=2000-10-08 | website=[[The New York Times]] | accessdate=2009-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She has called former President [[Barack Obama]] "[[Spock]]"&lt;ref name="spock"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/30/opinion/30dowd.html | title=As the Nation's Pulse Races, Obama Can't Seem to Find His | last=Dowd | first=Maureen | date=December 30, 2009 | work=[[The New York Times]] | pages=A27 | accessdate=January 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Barry". Dowd's interest in candidates' personalities earned her criticism early in her career: "She focuses too much on the person but not enough on policy."&lt;ref name="NYmag-dowd"/&gt;

Dowd, who perceives her columns to be an exploration of politics, Hollywood, and gender-related topics, often uses popular culture to support and metaphorically enhance her political commentary.&lt;ref name="stiletto" /&gt; In a ''Times'' video debate, she said of the [[North Korean government]], "... you could look at a movie like ''[[Mean Girls]]'' and figure out the way these North Koreans are reacting; you know it's like high school girls with nuclear weapons—they just want some attention from us, you know?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people=[[David Brooks (journalist)|Brooks, David]]; Dowd, Maureen; [[Frank Rich|Rich, Frank]] (speakers) | url=http://video.nytimes.com/video/2006/07/19/opinion/1194817112243/2-bushs-circle-of-trust.html | title=U.S. Politics: What's Next?&lt;!-- see beginning of first video in the series --&gt;—2: Bush's Circle of Trust | format=[[Flash Video]] | website=The New York Times | time=5:05 | date=2006-07-19 | accessdate=2009-05-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dowd's columns have also been described as often being political cartoons that capture a caricatured view of the current political landscape with precision and exaggeration.&lt;ref name="NYmag-dowd"/&gt; For example, in the run-up to the [[U.S. presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential election]] Dowd wrote that [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democratic]] candidate "[[Al Gore]] is so feminized and diversified and [[ecology|ecologically]] correct that he's practically [[lactation|lactating]],"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.motherjones.com/mojoblog/archives/2007/11/6238_maureen_down_re.html | title=Maureen Dowd Rehashes the "Presidential Candidate X is a Wuss" Construct | last=Stein | first=Jonathan | work=MoJo (blog) | publisher=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones and the Foundation for National Progress]] | date=2007-11-19 | accessdate=2009-05-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while referring to the Democratic party as the "mommy party".&lt;ref name="NYmag-dowd"/&gt; In a Fresh Dialogues interview years later she said, "I was just teasing him a little bit because he was so earnest and he could be a little righteous and self important. That’s not always the most effective way to communicate your ideas, even if the ideas themselves are right. I mean, certainly his ideas were right but he himself was – sometimes – a pompous messenger for them."&lt;ref name="freshdialogues.com"/&gt;

In January 2014, Dowd said she ate about one-quarter of a [[Cannabis foods|cannabis-infused chocolate bar]], while touring the legalized [[Cannabis (drug)|recreational cannabis]] industry.&lt;ref name="cannabist2"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Baca|first1=Ricardo|title=NYT’s Maureen Dowd reacts: In quest for fun, risks downplayed|url=http://www.thecannabist.co/2014/06/05/maureen-dowd-reacts-focused-fun-risks/13196/|accessdate=6 June 2014|work=The Cannabist|date=2014-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; She said she was later told she should have only eaten one-sixteenth,&lt;ref name="cannabis-bi"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walker|first1=Hunter|title=Maureen Dowd Got Way Too High And Freaked Out|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/maureen-dowd-too-high-and-freaked-out-2014-6|website=Business Insider|accessdate=June 5, 2014|date=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cannabis-salon"&gt;{{cite web|last1=McDonough|first1=Katie|title=Maureen Dowd ate a large dose of a marijuana chocolate bar, freaked out, wrote about it|url=http://www.salon.com/2014/06/04/maureen_dowd_ate_a_large_dose_of_a_marijuana_chocolate_bar_freaked_out_wrote_about_it/|website=Salon|accessdate=June 5, 2014|date=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was not in the instructions on the label.&lt;ref name="cannabis-slate"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weissman|first1=Jordan|title=The Economic Lesson of Maureen Dowd's Reefer Madness|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2014/06/04/marijuana_edibles_what_maureen_dowd_s_bad_trip_teaches_us_about_the_new.html|website=Slate|accessdate=June 5, 2014|date=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cannabis-wapo"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rosenberg|first1=Alyssa|title=What Maureen Dowd gets right about marijuana|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2014/06/04/what-maureen-dowd-gets-right-about-marijuana/|accessdate=June 5, 2014|work=The Washington Post|date=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; She then described her negative experiences with legal cannabis in a June 3, 2014, ''The New York Times'' [[op-ed]].&lt;ref name="cannabis-salon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cannabis-nyt"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dowd|first1=Maureen|title=Don’t Harsh Our Mellow, Dude|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/04/opinion/dowd-dont-harsh-our-mellow-dude.html|accessdate=June 5, 2014|work=The New York Times|date=2014-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2014, Dowd followed up on this story with another ''New York Times'' op-ed, this time describing a discussion of using consumable cannabis with her "marijuana [[Kesuke Miyagi|Miyagi]]" [[Willie Nelson]].&lt;ref name="cannabis-nyt2"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dowd|first1=Maureen|title=Two Redheaded Strangers|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/21/opinion/sunday/willie-nelson-feels-maureen-dowd-s-pain.html|accessdate=21 September 2014|work=The New York Times|date=2014-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 4, 2014, Dowd published a column about the dominance of men in the film industry; in it, she quoted [[Amy Pascal]], co-chairman of [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dowd|first1=Maureen|title=Frozen in a Niche?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/05/opinion/dowd-frozen-in-a-niche.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=March 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[BuzzFeed]], "leaked emails from Sony" suggested that Dowd had promised to provide the draft column to Pascal's husband, former ''Times'' reporter [[Bernard Weinraub]], prior to the column's publication. BuzzFeed said  the column "painted Pascal in such a good light that she engaged in a round of mutual adulation with Dowd over email after its publication."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/matthewzeitlin/leaked-emails-reveal-maureen-dowd-promised-to-sony-execs-hus#.khYrwZeAom|title=Leaked Emails Suggest Maureen Dowd Promised To Show Sony Exec's Husband Column Before Publication|work=BuzzFeed}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Dowd and Weinraub have denied that Weinraub ever received the column. On December 12, 2014, ''Times'' public editor  Margaret Sullivan concluded, "While the tone of the email exchanges is undeniably gushy, I don’t think Ms. Dowd did anything unethical here."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/12/maureen-dowd-amy-pascal-email-leak-questions/?module=Search&amp;mabReward=relbias%3Aw%2C%7B%221%22%3A%22RI%3A8%22%7D | work=The New York Times | first=Margaret | last=Sullivan | title=Hacked Emails, 'Air--Kissing' -- and Two Firm Denials | date=2014-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2014, it was announced that Dowd would become a staff writer for ''[[The New York Times Magazine]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://observer.com/2014/08/maureen-dowd-named-new-york-times-magazine-staff-writer/|title=Maureen Dowd Named New York Times Magazine Staff Writer|first=Kara|last=Bloomgarden-Smoke|date=11 August 2014|work=Observer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her first article under the new arrangement was published more than a year later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/20/magazine/kate-mckinnon-hates-letting-her-hair-down.html|title=Kate McKinnon Hates Letting Her Hair Down|date=20 September 2015|newspaper=The New York Times|last1=Dowd|first1=Interview by Maureen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 2, 2015, Dowd published a column in the ''Times'' about her niece Tara, who had a stroke at age 41 caused by an arterial dissection in her brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/03/opinion/sunday/maureen-dowd-stroke-of-fate.html?_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first=Maureen | last=Dowd | title=Stroke of Fate | date=2015-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the stroke, Tara had been a very active athlete. The first neurologist who saw Tara told her to cut back on physical activity, but a second neurologist, Dr. [[Louis R. Caplan]], a Harvard neurologist, disagreed with the first neurologist and said that they had misinterpreted the images of her brain and vascular system. He told her to return to exercise, which she did safely.  In the article, Dr. Caplan suggested that going to the emergency rooms was "dangerous" and compared ERs to "local gas stations" where you should not get your brain, a "Rolls-Royce," serviced. He suggested that one should be 'pushy' and since E.R. people have to deal with a lot of organs quickly, and they get little neurology training, you should ask for a neurologist. He said that stroke experts "have had a hard time getting the message across to E.R. personnel that if a stroke is suspected, a vascular image must be taken as well as a brain image, because it shows up first in the vessels that supply and drain the brain". Ultimately he recommended that you should "find an academic medical center that has a specialization in stroke".  These comments unleashed a firestorm of comments from emergency medicine physicians on social media, who thought that Caplan's comments were poorly informed and reckless, particularly sending the message not to go to the ER for symptoms of stroke, which directly contradicts recommendations from the [[American Heart Association]] to "call 9-1-1" when experiencing signs of stroke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strokeassociation.org/STROKEORG/WarningSigns/Stroke-Warning-Signs-and-Symptoms_UCM_308528_SubHomePage.jsp|title=Stroke Warning Signs and Symptoms|website=strokeassociation.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a related column in ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', Dr. David Newman, an ER physician from [[Mount Sinai Hospital (Manhattan)|Mount Sinai]], wrote that Dr. Caplan's comments showed "poor insight" and "narrow expertise", claiming that subspecialty medicine as a whole was expensive and often unnecessarily invasive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-h-newman-md/quiet-fortitude-in-the-er_b_7209372.html | work=The Huffington Post | title=Quiet Fortitude in the ER | date=2015-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mazyar''' ([[Middle Persian]]: ''Māh-Izād''; [[Mazandarani language|Mazandarani]]/{{lang-fa|مازیار|Mazyār}}), was an [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] prince from the [[Qarinvand dynasty]], who was the ruler (''[[ispahbadh]]'') of the mountainous region of [[Tabaristan]] from 825/6 to 839. For his resistance to the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], Mazyar is considered one of the national heroes of [[Iran]] by twentieth-century Iranian nationalist historiography. His name means "protected by the ''[[yazata]]'' of the moon".

== Origin ==
Mazyar belonged to the Qarinvand dynasty, which was descended from [[Sukhra]], a powerful magnate from the [[House of Karen]], who was the ''[[de facto]]'' ruler of the [[Sasanian Empire]] from 484 to 493. However, due to his great influence and power, he was exiled and executed by the Sasanian king [[Kavadh I]] (r. 488–496 &amp; 498–531). Sukhra was survived by eight sons, one of them being Karin, who in return for aiding Kavadh I's son and successor [[Khosrow I]] (r. 531–579) against the [[Western Turkic Khaganate]] in the 550s, received land to the south of [[Amol]] in Tabaristan, thus starting the Qarinvand dynasty.{{sfn|Pourshariati|2008|p=113}}

== Accession, flight, and rise to power ==
Mazyar succeeded his father [[Qarin ibn Vindadhhurmuzd]] in ca. 817. However, his territories were soon invaded by the neighbouring [[Bavandid]] ruler [[Shahriyar I]], who defeated Mazyar and forced him to flee. Mazyar took refuge with his cousin Vinda-Umid, who betrayed him and handed him over to Shahriyar. However, Mazyar managed to escape and reach the court of the [[Abbasid]] [[caliph]] [[al-Ma'mun]]. There he met one of his astrologers, [[Yahya ibn Abi Mansur|Yahya ibn al-Munajjim]], a [[Persian people|Persian]] who had recently converted to [[Islam]] and belonged to the [[Banu Munajjim]] family. Mazyar soon also embraced Islam,{{cref|a}} and al-Ma'mun gave him the title of "Servant of the Commander of the Faithful" (''[[mawla|mawlā]] [[amir al-mu'minin|amīr al-muʾminīn]]'') and the Muslim name of '''Abu'l-Hasan Muhammad'''.{{sfn|Ibn Isfandiyar|1905|pp=145-156}} 

Mazyar was also granted two towns of [[Royan, Iran|Ruyan]] and [[Damavand, Iran|Damavand]] in [[Tabaristan]] as his fief, and was named as the co-governor of Tabaristan with the Abbasid statesman [[Musa ibn Hafs]]. In 822/3, Mazyar returned to Tabaristan with Abbasid reinforcements, and began to deal with his enemies—he had his brother [[Quhyar]] exiled, and did the same to Shahriyar I's son [[Qarin I]], who was his nephew.{{sfn|Rekaya|1997|pp=644-647}} In 825/6, Mazyar invaded the domains of the Bavandids, and captured Shahriyar's son and successor, [[Shapur (Bavandid ruler)|Shapur]]. His uncle, Vinda-Umid, was also defeated, and shortly afterwards killed.{{sfn|Madelung|1984|pp=747–753}} Mazyar thus united the highlands under his own rule.{{sfn|Madelung|1975|pp=204–205}} He then assumed the titles of ''Gil-Gilan'', ''[[Ispahbadh]]'', and ''[[Padishkhwargar]][[shah]]'', all titles used by the 8th-century [[Dabuyids|Dabuyid]] king of Tabaristan, [[Farrukhan the Great]] (r. 712-728).{{sfn|Rekaya|1997|pp=644-647}}

Shapur, knowing that Mazyar planned to have him killed, sent a secret message to Musa, willing to pay him 100,000 [[dirham]]s if he would assert him as his own prisoner. Musa responded by saying his best shot would be to convert to Islam and become a client of the caliph. Musa, nervous of Mazyar learning of his secret communication with Shapur, asked him how he would react if Shapur converted to Islam and offered to become a client of the caliph. Mazyar gave no answer, but had Shapur beheaded the same day, which greatly angered Musa. Mazyar, fearful of the consequences of having Shapur killed without consensus, apologized to Musa.{{sfn|Ibn Isfandiyar|1905|pp=145-156}}

Mazyar now began constructing mosques in several towns, and successfully plundered the territories of the [[Daylamites]], and had a large number of them resettled in the border place of Muzn.{{sfn|Madelung|1975|pp=204–205}} In 826/7, Musa died and was succeeded by his son Muhammad ibn Musa, to whom Mazyar paid no attention.{{sfn|Ibn Isfandiyar|1905|pp=145-156}} Mazyar continued to expand his influence, but his policies were regarded by the Muslims of Tabaristan as oppressive. The Muslims of Tabaristan and the Bavandid prince Qarin I now began complaining to al-Ma'mun about Mazyar's behavior, but did not manage to turn al-Ma'mun against Mazyar.{{sfn|Rekaya|1997|pp=644-647}}

After al-Ma'mun became involved in a war against the [[Byzantine Empire]], Mazyar used the opportunity to imprison Muhammad ibn Musa on the charge of being secretly involved with the [[Alids]]. Al-Ma'mun soon acknowledged Mazyar's rule over Tabaristan and its surrounding regions.{{sfn|Madelung|1975|pp=204–205}} When al-Ma'mun died in 833, he was succeeded by his half-brother [[al-Mu'tasim]], who also acknowledged Mazyar as the ruler of Tabaristan.

However, when the [[Tahirid]] ruler [[Abdallah ibn Tahir]] demanded the payment of the land tax (''[[kharaj]]'') from Mazyar, the latter refused. Abdallah, claiming Tabaristan as his own fief, then demanded that Mazyar should release Muhammad ibn Musa. Mazyar, however, once again refused to obey Abdallah, and the latter went before al-Mu'tasim to accuse Mazyar of infidelity and tyranny.

=== Rebellion ===
Feeling threatened, Mazyar rebelled against the Abbasid Caliphate, an act which was widely supported by the native [[Zoroastrians]], who began plundering the Muslim villages{{sfn|Mottahedeh|1975|p=76}} and the Abbasid-controlled border regions. Mazyar tried to secure the loyalty of the noblemen of Tabaristan and imprisoned anyone he did not trust. According to the medieval historian [[Ibn Isfandiyar]] in his ''Tarikh-e-Tabaristan'', Mazyar is said to have proclaimed: {{Cquote|[[Khaydhar ibn Kawus al-Afshin|Afshin, the son of Kavus]], [[Babak Khorramdin]], and I had made an oath and allegiance that we take the country back from the Arabs and transfer the government and the country back to the family of [[Sasanian Empire|Kasraviyan]].&lt;ref&gt;Said Nafisi, Babak Khorramdin Delawar-e-Azerbaijan (Babak Khorramdin, the brave heat of Azerbaijan), Tabesh Publishers, Tehran 1955, pg 57, actual quote from Ibn Esfandiyar
من (مازیار) و افشين خيدر بن کاوس و بابک هر سه از دير باز عهد و بيعت کرده ايم و قرار داده بر آن که دولت از عرب بازستانيم و ملک و جهانداري با خاندان کسرويان نقل کنيم»&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Abdallah and al-Mu'tasim sent five armies that entered Tabaristan from all sides. Mazyar named his brother [[Quhyar]] as the defender of the Qarinvand mountains, and the Bavandid [[Qarin I]] as the defender of eastern Tabaristan. However, Tabaristan fell quickly to the Abbasid invasion: several cities were taken by surprise, while Qarin I betrayed Mazyar and agreed to aid the Abbasids in exchange for being restored as the ruler of his family's domains. The people of [[Sari, Iran|Sari]] revolted against Mazyar, and Mazyar was betrayed by his brother Quhyar, who captured him and surrendered him to al-Mu'tasim.{{sfn|Madelung|1975|pp=204–205}}

Mazyar was brought to [[Abbasid Samarra|Samarra]], where he was executed. His body later was [[Gibbeting|gibbeted]] along with the body of Babak Khorramdin. Mazyar's brother Quhyar was shortly after killed by his own Daylamite soldiers because of his betrayal  of Mazyar. This marked the end of the Qarivand dynasty. This left the Tahirids as the rulers of Tabaristan, and Qarin I was restored as the ruler of the Bavand dynasty as a Tahirid vassal.{{sfn|Madelung|1984|pp=747–753}}{{sfn|Madelung|1975|pp=205–206}}

==Notes==
{{cnote|a|This seems to have only been nominal, since a few years later, Mazyar, during his rebellion against the Abbasid Caliphate, allowed his Zoroastrian subjects to destroy [[mosque]]s.{{sfn|Babaie|Grigor|2015|p=140}}}}

'''Mithyatva''' means "false belief", and an important concept in [[Jainism]] and [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref name=jljaini&gt;JL Jaini (Editor: FW Thomas), Outlines of Jainism, Jain Literature Society, Cambridge University Press Archive, page 94&lt;/ref&gt; Disappearance (''nivrtti'') is the necessary presupposition of ''mithyatva'' because what is falsely perceived ceases to exist with the dawn of right knowledge. ''Mithyatva'', states Jayatirtha, cannot be easily defined as 'indefinable', 'non-existent', 'something other than real', 'which cannot be proved, produced by [[Avidya (Hinduism)|avidya]] or as its effect', or as 'the nature of being perceived in the same locus along with its own absolute non-existence'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=History of Dvaita School of Vedanta and its Literature|author=B.N.Krishnamurti Sharma|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=167|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=FVtpFMPMulcC&amp;pg=PA260&amp;dq=mithyatva&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gEGwUu_LFIbQ7AaH14BY&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=mithyatva&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mithyatva is a concept in [[Jainism]] distinguishing right knowledge from false knowledge, and parallels the concepts of ''[[Avidya (Hinduism)|Avidya]]'' in the [[Vedanta]] school of Hinduism, ''Aviveka'' in its [[Samkhya]] school, and ''Maya'' in [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref name=jljaini48&gt;JL Jaini (Editor: FW Thomas), Outlines of Jainism, Jain Literature Society, Cambridge University Press Archive, page 48-58&lt;/ref&gt;

The opposite of ''Mithyatva'' (false belief) is ''Samyaktva'' (right belief).&lt;ref name=robertwilliams47&gt;Robert Williams (1998), Jaina Yoga: A Survey of the Mediaeval Śrāvakācāras, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120807754}}, page 47&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jainism==
Mithyatva is an important concept on false knowledge in Jainism.&lt;ref&gt;JL Jaini (Editor: FW Thomas), Outlines of Jainism, Jain Literature Society, Cambridge University Press Archive, pages 48-64, 94-95&lt;/ref&gt; The Jaina scholar [[Hemachandra]] defined Mithyatva as "belief in false divinities, false gurus and false scriptures".&lt;ref name=robertwilliams47/&gt;

[[Jainism]] describes seven types of beliefs - ''mithyatva'', ''sasvadana-samyaktva'', ''mishra-mithyatva'', ''kashopashmika-samyaktva'', ''aupshamika-samyaktva'', ''vedak-samyaktva'' and ''kshayik-samyaktva''. ''Mithyatva'', meaning false or wrong belief, is the soul’s original and beginning less state of deluded world-view, at which stage the soul is in a spiritual slumber, unaware of its own bondage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of Oriental Philosophy|publisher=Global Vision Publishing House|page=329|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZgNHE-48jNcC&amp;pg=PA329&amp;lpg=PA329&amp;dq=types+of+mithyatva&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xQ3l4Opk4d&amp;sig=-XlEHoqdLMAqPgnv2P2lrllw1sA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FymwUqr8K42M7AaZ04FQ&amp;ved=0CGIQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=types%20of%20mithyatva&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Mithyatva'' or "false belief, delusion" are of five kinds in Jainism, according to one classification:&lt;ref name=jljaini/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. M. Joseph (1997), Jainism in South India, International School of Dravidian Linguistics, {{ISBN|978-8185692234}}, page 415&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dravya Samgraha of Nemichandra Siddhanta Chakravartti|author=Nemicandrasiddhantacakravartin|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|pages=74-75|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=svi0gpwC-5sC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=mithyatva&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Zy6wUsGPJeLN7AaJ-IDwDw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=mithyatva&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#''Ekanta'' (one sided belief, not considering other sides or aspects for truth),
#''Viparita'' (belief in the opposite of what is right),
#''Vinaya'' (universally accepting all right or wrong belief/religion without examining them, attending only to conduct),
#''Samsaya'' (when there is doubt whether a course is right or wrong, unsettled belief, skepticism), and
#''Ajnana'' (indifference to right or wrong belief).

[[Śvētāmbara|Svetambara]] Jains classify categories of false belief under ''Mithyatva'' differently: ''Abhigrahika'' (belief limited to their own scriptures that they can defend, but refusing to study and analyse other scriptures); ''Anabhigrahika'' (belief that equal respect must be shown to all gods, teachers, scriptures); ''Abhiniviseka'' (belief of those who can discern but refuse to do so from preconceptions); ''Samsayika'' (state of hesitation or uncertainty between various conflicting, inconsistent beliefs); and ''Anabhogika'' (innate, default beliefs that a person has not thought through on one's own).&lt;ref name=robertwilliams48&gt;Robert Williams (1998), Jaina Yoga: A Survey of the Mediaeval Śrāvakācāras, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120807754}}, pages 47-48&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Digambara]] Jains classify categories of false belief under ''Mithyatva'' into seven: ''Ekantika'' (absolute, one sided belief), ''Samsayika'' (uncertainty, doubt whether a course is right or wrong, unsettled belief, skepticism), ''Vainayika'' (belief that all gods, gurus and scriptures are alike), ''Grhita'' (belief derived purely from habits or default, no self analysis), ''Viparita'' (belief that true is false, false is true, everything is relative or acceptable), ''Naisargika'' (belief that living beings are devoid of consciousness and cannot discern right from wrong), ''Mudha-drsti'' (belief that violence and anger can tarnish or damage thoughts, divine, guru or [[dharma]]).&lt;ref name=robertwilliams48/&gt;

Mithyatva is one of three things, in Jainism, that are harmful stimuli and that distract a person from attaining right belief and correct knowledge. The other two things that distract, are ''[[Maya (Illusion)|Maya]]'' (deceit), and ''Nidana'' (hankering after fame and worldly pleasures).&lt;ref&gt;Robert Williams (1998), Jaina Yoga: A Survey of the Mediaeval Śrāvakācāras, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120807754}}, page 50&lt;/ref&gt;

One Jaina text lists 28 kinds of ''mohaniya'' (deluding) ''karmas'' that prevent the true perception of reality and the purity of the soul, the ''darsana mohaniya karman'' which function to prevent a soul’s insight into its own nature and therefore, deemed destructive, are ''mithyatva karman''. The term, ''mithyatva'', meaning 'perversity', is generally used to denote the idea of ''avidya'' along with ''mithyadarsana'' or ''mithyadrsti'' (wrong view), ''darsanamoha'' (delusion of vision), ''moha'' (delusion) etc.;. The state of ''mithyatva'' is manifested as a fundamental tendency to see things other than as they really are (Tattva Sutra 8:9).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Harmless Souls|author=W.J.

==Hinduism==
{{see also|Avidya (Hinduism)|Ātman (Hinduism)|Maya (illusion)}}
Mithyatva is a concept found in some schools of Hinduism. Other concepts in Hinduism, similar in meaning to Mithyatva, include the concepts of ''[[Avidya (Hinduism)|Avidya]]'' in the [[Vedanta]] school of Hinduism, ''Aviveka'' in its [[Samkhya]] school.&lt;ref name=jljaini48/&gt;

Ignorance begets ''aviveka'' (lack of correct, discriminative knowledge) states Samkhya school of Hinduism. One engages in deeds, good and bad, due to ''aviveka'', earns ''punya'' or becomes a victim of sin and is reborn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Message of the Puranas|author=B.B.Paliwal|publisher=Diamond Pocket Books|page=212|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=TGyzMJYZn-0C&amp;pg=PA212&amp;dq=avivek&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jHyxUtT8DeKAywOKv4GICA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=avivek&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aviveka also means lack of reason or imprudence or indiscretion. Avidya is related concept in Vedanta school of Hinduism. Avidya and aviveka give ''dukkha'' i.e. suffering.

[[Madhusudanah]] in his ''Advaita-siddhi'' gives five definitions of ''mithyatva'' which term is derived from ''mithya'' meaning false or indeterminable. False is something that appears and is later negated or contradicted; the unreal is never an object of experience, the concept of unreal is self-contradictory. Falsity is defined as – not being the locus of either reality or unreality, it is distinct from both reality and unreality. In practice, ''mithyatva'' has three means, – a) that which does not exist in three divisions of time, past, present and future; b) that which is removable by knowledge; and c) that which is identical with the object of sublation. Whereas ''mithya'' is other than real but not real, ''mithyatva'' is identical with sublatability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Perceiving in Advaita Vedanta|author=Bina Gupta|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|pages=131–132|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w-AE8tEDMYYC&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=mithyatva&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Zy6wUsGPJeLN7AaJ-IDwDw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=mithyatva&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mithyatva'' may also be understood as that which is negated even where it is found to exist. The followers of the Advaita School contend that the world-appearance is negated by Brahman-knowledge and hence it is illusory. To the followers of [[Vishishtadvaita]]vada, ''mithya'' is the apprehension of an object as different from its own nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tattvamuktakalpa|author=S.M.Srinivasa Chari|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|pages=261–263|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=un1i5icdpdoC&amp;pg=PA263&amp;dq=mithyatva&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gEGwUu_LFIbQ7AaH14BY&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=mithyatva&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Advaita School considers ''Mithyatva'' to mean falsity of the world. Disappearance (''nivrtti'') is the necessary presupposition of ''mithyatva'' because what is falsely perceived ceases to exist with the dawn of right knowledge. But, ''mithya'' or falsity, or ''mithyatva'' or falsity of the world, cannot be easily defined as indefinable or non-existent or something other than real or which cannot be proved or produced by ''avidya'' (or as its effect) or as the nature of being perceived in the same locus along with its own absolute non-existence. The opponents of the ''Advaita'' do not accept the contention that [[Ātman(Hinduism)|Atman]] is simply consciousness and cannot be the substratum of knowledge, and they insist that existence as the logical concomitant of the absence of non-existence and vice versa, with these two being mutually exclusive predicates, must be admitted. The opposite of unreality must be reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=History of Dvaita School of Vedanta and its Literature|author=B.N.Krishnamurti Sharma|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=167|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=FVtpFMPMulcC&amp;pg=PA260&amp;dq=mithyatva&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gEGwUu_LFIbQ7AaH14BY&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=mithyatva&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''Advaita'' anything which is both cognized and sublated is ''mithya''. ''Mithyatva'' is negated even where it is found. The illusoriness of the world is itself illusory. Once Brahman-knowledge arises both the cognizer and the cognized disappear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Seven Great Untenables:Sapta-viddha Anupapatti|author=John A. Grimes|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|pages=60–62|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QWcgAxQnSAwC&amp;pg=PA60&amp;dq=mithyatva+in+Advaita&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=s-6wUojDO8SYtQbW0YGQBg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=mithyatva%20in%20Advaita&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proof of unreality is impermanence, the permanent one is the Sole Reality. ''Mithyatva'' is apparent reality; at the level of ultimate truth, when, through the understanding of the mithyatva of all limiting adjuncts (upadhis) of name and form i.e., those that pertain to the individual body-mind (''tvam'') and as well to the lordship of [[Brahman]] (''tat''), everything is seen to be not an other to pure Awareness, the distinctions of [[Jiva]] and [[Ishvara]] no longer apply, and it is the ''param Brahman'', the very essential of the Lord Itself, that is the final reality. In ''Advaita'' the method to reveal the unreality (''mithyatva'') of things involves the idea of change and permanence i.e. what deviates and what persists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Method of Early Vedanta|author=Michael Commins|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=260|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=sx12hxoFVqwC&amp;pg=PA260&amp;dq=mithyatva+in+Advaita&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=s-6wUojDO8SYtQbW0YGQBg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=mithyatva%20in%20Advaita&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Mithyatva'' means 'illusoriness'. ''[[Advaita]]'' maintains that Brahman alone is real, the plurality of the universe is because the universe is illusory, the universe can be cognized; whatever that is cognized is illusory. The universe is different from the real as well as the real, the universe is indeterminable. ''Vedanta Desika'' refutes this contention because there is no such entity which is neither real nor unreal.

Rishi Damano Yamayana ([[Rig Veda]] X.xvi.4) insists that all should know about that part of the body which is immortal; the immortal part of the body is the [[Ātman (Buddhism)|Atman]] or [[Brahman]], it is called a part because without it there cannot be life in one’s body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Illumination of Knowledge|author=Ravinder Kumar Soni|publisher=GBD  Books|pages=76, 90|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Illumination_Of_Knowledge.html?id=dXZJXwAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vācaspati Miśra|Vacaspati]] of the ''Bhamati'' school states that whereas illusion conceals, ''mithyatva'' signifies 'concealment', the real nature of the cognized object is concealed resulting in non-apprehension of difference between the real and the unreal objects. Padmapada of the ''Vivarna'' school adds to the sense of concealment the sense of inexpressibility, thus hinting at the sublatability of illusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bhamati and Vivarna Schools of Advaita Vedanta:A Critical Approach|author=Pulasth Soobah Roodumam|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=116|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=2pU2ZQB2wUYC&amp;pg=PA116&amp;dq=mithyatva+in+Advaita&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZwKxUujCJMiGtAacpoH4Cg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=mithyatva%20in%20Advaita&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the term ''anirvacaniya'' is defined by the ''Advaita'' as the nature of being different from ''sat'' and ''asat'' in essence, which is the nature of ''mithyatva'', then the element of difference must be real.

[[Madhavacharya of Sringeri|Madhavacharya]] concludes that difference is not something that falls outside the content of an object or what is generally considered to constitute its essence which in perception is the sum total of its distinction from others.

[[File:Ninian Smart.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Ninian Smart]]
'''Roderick Ninian Smart''' (6 May 1927 – 9 January 2001) was a Scottish writer and university educator. He was a pioneer in the field of secular [[religious studies]]. In 1967 he established the first department of [[religious studies]] in the United Kingdom at the new [[University of Lancaster]] where he was also Pro-Vice-Chancellor, having already chaired one of the largest and most prestigious departments of theology in Britain at the [[University of Birmingham]]. In 1976, he became the first J.F. Rowny Professor in the Comparative Study of Religions at [[University of California, Santa Barbara]]. Smart presented the [[Gifford Lectures]] in 1979–80. In 1996, he was named the Academic Senate's Research Professor, the highest professorial rank at [[UC Santa Barbara]]. In 2000, he was elected President of the [[American Academy of Religion]], while simultaneously retaining his status as President of the Inter Religious Federation for World Peace. Smart held both titles at the time of his death.

Smart became widely known outside the Academy, at least in Britain, when he was editorial consultant for the major [[BBC]] television series, ''[[The Long Search]]'' (1977). His book ''The World's Religions'' (1989) also reached a considerable popular readership. His defence of religious studies as a secular discipline helped the formation of departments in many public universities, especially in the United States. He distanced religious studies from traditional theology in that evaluating truth claims and apology have no role but regarded investigation into the "truth and worth" of religion ''per se'' as a valid academic enterprise in the public arena of [[Public university|state-funded education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Smart|1968|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Ninian Smart was born in [[Cambridge]], England, where his father, [[William Marshall Smart]] (1889–1975) was the [[John Couch Adams|John Couch Adams Astronomer]] in the [[University of Cambridge]].  His mother was Isabel (née Carswell). W. M Smart, who died in 1975, also served as President of the [[Royal Astronomical Society]] (1950).
Both parents were Scottish. They moved to Glasgow in 1937, when W. M. Smart became [[Regius Professor of Astronomy, Glasgow|Regius Professor of Astronomy]] (retiring in 1959).

Smart was one of three brothers, all of whom became professors: [[J. J. C. Smart|Jack]] (1920–2012) became a professor of philosophy; Alastair (1922–1992) was Professor of Art History at the [[University of Nottingham]]. 

Smart attended the [[Glasgow Academy]] before joining the military in 1945, serving until 1948, in the [[British Army Intelligence Corps]] where he learned Chinese (via [[Confucian]] texts) mainly at the London School of Oriental and African Studies and had his first extended contact with Sri Lankan [[Buddhism]]. It was this experience that roused him from what he called his "Western slumber with the call of diverse and noble cultures."&lt;ref name="Smart_2000_20"&gt;{{harvp|Smart|2000|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leaving the army – as a captain – with a scholarship to Queen's College, [[University of Oxford]], he reverted to his Glasgow major, classics and philosophy, mainly because Chinese and Oriental studies in those days had "pathetic curricula". However, for his B.Phil. work he returned to world religions, writing what he later described as "the first dissertation in Oxford on philosophy of religion after World War II".&lt;ref name="Smart_2000_21"&gt;{{harvp|Smart|2000|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Lancaster University Chaplaincy Centre 1024.jpg|thumb|right|Lancaster University's Chaplaincy Centre]]

==Career==
After teaching in the [[University of Wales]] from 1952 until 1955, Smart spent a year as a visiting lecturer at [[Yale University]], where he also studied [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pāli]], the language of the [[Buddhist scriptures]]. In 1956, he was appointed Lecturer in the [[University of London]], then in 1961 at the very young age of 34 – extraordinarily young for a full chair in the British system – he became the first H. G. Wood Professor of Theology at the [[University of Birmingham]] – one of the largest departments of theology, where he also served as head of department. By now author of several publications, including ''Reasons and Faiths'' (1958), based on his B.Phil work and ''World Religions: A Dialogue'' (1960), Smart was a rising star in the newly developing field of Religious Studies, rather than in Theology, despite the name of the chair he occupied. Already known internationally, he received several offers to take up positions in North America, including as Chair of the [[Columbia University|Columbia]] and [[University of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]] Departments, and an invitation to apply for a chair at Oxford. However, he was already involved in a consultative capacity in forming the first major department of Religious Studies at the new [[Lancaster University|Lancaster]], and found himself "cajoled from being adviser to being candidate" for the Chair.

Despite the attraction of prestigious posts elsewhere, he chose [[Lancaster University|Lancaster]] because it represented a "[[tabula rasa]], a new field" where he could practice his ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Smart|2000|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took up appointment in 1967, as Foundation Professor of Religious Studies. His tenure at [[Birmingham University]] had also done much to shift the department from an exclusive focus on [[Christianity]] to encompass [[world religions]]. His successor at Birmingham, [[John Hick]], would emerge as the most well-known exponent of a pluralist [[theology of religions]]. Between 1969 and 1972, he was also Pro-Vice-Chancellor at Lancaster. In 1977, Smart started to divide his time between Lancaster and another new venture, the Religious studies department at the [[University of California|University of California, Santa Barbara]] (1976–98) where he became the first J. F. Rowny Professor in the Comparative Study of Religions at Santa Barbara, from 1988 (he was a professor from 1976). As at Birmingham and Lancaster, he was again also department chair.  He spent six months of each year at each campus. In 1996, he was named Research Professor at Santa Barbara, the highest academic honour.  Toward the end of his career, he was elected President of the [[American Academy of Religion]].  Proud of his [[Scottish identity]], he often wore his [[kilt]] on campus at Santa Barbara, where he was renowned for riding his bicycle very slowly, for "his bow ties and the ever-present flower in his lapel, and most of all the twinkle in his eye."&lt;ref name="Hecht"&gt;{{cite web |author=Richard Hecht|url=http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/senate/inmemoriam/roderickniniansmart.htm |title=In Memoriam: Roderick Ninian Smart |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ucsbuniversitycenterandstorketower.jpg|thumb|right|The University of California at Santa Barbara University Center and Lagoon]]At Lancaster he was respected by his students for being so accessible, for his willingness to engage his formidable intellect without pretension in informal debate over a pint in the bar.{{cn|date=June 2015}}&lt;!-- do not remove this unless you have a proper referenced source to replace it.--&gt;

===Visiting professorships and lectures===
Smart was also visiting professor at [[Varanasi]] in India, [[Yale]], [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|Wisconsin]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[University of Queensland|Queensland]], and the respected Religious Studies department at [[University of Wales, Lampeter|Lampeter]], in Hong Kong and elsewhere. Lectures delivered in Delhi were published as ''The Yogi and the Devotee'' (1968). In 1967, he presented the Heslington Lectures at the [[University of York]], in which he set out his ideas about secular Religious Studies subsequently published as ''Secular Education and the Logic of Religion'' (1967), further developing these in his inaugural lecture at Lancaster, published as ''Concept and Empathy'' (1986). In 1979–80, he presented the prestigious [[Gifford Lectures]], published as ''Beyond Ideology'' (1981).

===Activism===
In addition to teaching, research, and writing, Smart was something of an activist in promoting improved cross-cultural understanding.  In the 1970s, he was involved in several initiatives in Britain to broaden the public [[religious education]] curriculum, previously purely [[Christian]], to include the range of [[world religions]].  He also served on the [[National Schools Council]] advising on broadening the religious education curriculum. The teaching of religion in the state school system in the United Kingdom, which is mandatory, distinguishes teaching about religion from faith-nurture, which is not properly part of the task.  Smart was involved in the Assembly of the World's Religions series of meetings (1985, 1990, 1992) sponsored by [[Sun Myung Moon]], founder of the [[Unification Church|Unification movement]] and served as President of the Inter Religious Federation for World Peace. In 1999, he was co-convener of the First Assembly of the Inter-religious and International Federation for World Peace, established by Moon. Smart reiterated his conviction that without improved understanding of the religious and cultural [[Other (philosophy)|Other]], peace in the world would remain elusive. His concept of religions as [[worldviews]], and his value-free approach to religious studies – that is, refraining from elevating a single understanding of "truth" as some sort of evaluative criterion of religious authenticity-opened up for him the study of non-religious [[ideologies]] or worldviews (he preferred this term because it does not imply that theism is an essential element) as well as of new religious movements, which he saw as one result of globalisation.  He also wrote the foreword for the Unification publication, ''World Scripture,'' edited by [[Andrew Wilson (academic)|Andrew Wilson]], in which he stated that, "it is obvious that as we move toward a world civilization, in which so many cultures and spiritual traditions will impinge on one another, all of us should understand one another."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wilson|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smart was also a member of the International Board of the Global Ethics and Religion Forum, an educational, non-profit NGO dedicated to increasing global ethical responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;The Global Ethics and Religion Forum, [http://www.gerforum.org/ The Global Religion and Ethics Forum.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic honours===
Smart received honorary doctorates from [[Loyola University Chicago|Loyola]] (1970), [[Glasgow University]] (1984), [[Stirling University]] (1986) [[University of Kelaniya]], Sri Lanka (1991), and Lancaster (1995) as well as an Honorary Fellowship from [[the Queen's College, Oxford]] (1999). He was made a Life Member of the International Association for the History of Religion (1995).

In 1994, the volume ''Aspects of Religion'', edited by Peter Masefield and Donald Wiebe, was published in his honour.

===Retirement and death===
Smart officially retired from Lancaster in 1982 (he was Honorary Professor from 1982 to 1989, then Professor Emeritus) and from Santa Barbara in 1998, but remained active as a professor emeritus in both universities, living mainly in [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]], where he died in 2001 from a massive stroke, aged 73.

==Scholarly contribution==
Smart is mainly noted for his contribution in the area of methodology, although he saw his contribution as conceptual as well as methodological, commenting that while expertise in languages was not to be dismissed, it should not be "rated above conceptual insight."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Smart|2000|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secular Religious Studies dates from the mid-1960s, when new departments were established, several in state universities in the United States. At the time, it was only just beginning to earn academic recognition and Smart was a pivotal figure in this process and, as Cunningham comments, "it is difficult not to recall that the emergence of Religious Studies as a higher education subject was then controversial."&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Cunningham, [http://news.independent.co.uk/people/obituaries/article34994.ece Professor Ninian Smart.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Smart's early work involved linguistic analysis, in which he had trained at Oxford. Later, he said that this came close to "cross-cultural study" but had stopped short, since he was still too captive to "our language" and "various assumptions of our culture".&lt;ref name="Smart_2000_21"/&gt; However, when he came to publish this he included later conceptual ideas, expanding his dissertation. Interested in [[Rudolf Otto]]'s concept of the Holy as a key to understanding religion, he found this too restrictive, since [[Buddhism]] is [[non-theistic]]. Instead, he suggested that religious experience can be either [[numinous]] or [[mystical]].  He was also influenced by [[R.C. Zaehner]]'s interest in mysticism, having consulted him at Oxford. He then examined what he took as key religious concepts, such as [[revelation]], [[faith]], [[Religious conversion|conversion]] and [[knowledge]] and analysed what these meant in Christianity, [[Hinduism]], and Buddhism without evaluating any belief in terms of truth or falsity. He was consciously attempting to break out of captivity to Western modes of thought so that for example theism is not taken as an essential component of religion, thus such ideas as [[theophany]] or a single ultimate focus or sacrifice do not necessarily translate from the Christian into other religious contexts.  "She who knows but one religion knows none," said Smart.&lt;ref name="Smart_2000_20"/&gt; Western concern for [[doctrine]] overlooked the importance of [[religious experience]]. Early in his career, he insisted that an [[ideology]] such as [[Marxism]] as well as [[nationalism]] and [[rationalism]] could be considered religious, because they resemble religious traditions in how they function, and therefore properly belong to Religious Studies, the subject matter of which was "non-finite".  

He situated Religious Studies in contrast to [[theology]] as [[agnostic]] on the truth of religious claims but he was critical of [[Peter L. Berger|Peter Berger]] for "assuming the non-existence of God".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Smart|2000|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religious Studies is, however, interested in why people believe that their religious statements or experience is true, thus description, although vital, must "transcend the informative" and engage in dialogue with "the para-historical claims of religions and anti-religious outlooks". It need not be hostile to the type of committed approach pursued in theology "provided it is open, and does not artificially restrict understanding and choice". It is not concerned with evangelising but with elucidating understanding, or meaning. Religious Studies, too, has a vital role to play in combating tribalism, that is, human captivity to its own cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Smart|1968|pp=105–106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religious Studies as a non-confessional, methodologically agnostic discipline takes its place in the secular academy, where it draw heavily on [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], history, [[archaeology]], and other disciplines.  At bottom, it has a place in the public or state sector because, as an aspect of human experience, it is also the study of people – of what they believe, why they believe and act as they do, both individually and within society. It is a constantly changing field because religions change as religious people adapt to new circumstances.  Religious Studies is never exclusively interested in what might be termed orthodoxy—however a religion itself might enforce or police conformity to an official version – but with religion as it is lived, with "religion on the ground," a term he first used in 1978.&lt;ref name="Hecht"/&gt; Responses to modernity, to globalisation, as well as trends towards religious eclecticism, properly concern Religious Studies. Smart did not anticipate a single, eclectic religion emerging but that religions would increasingly borrow from one another and that a global consensus on the value of religion in society would evolve. In interview with Scott London, he said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I … believe we are moving toward a global ideology that has a place for religion and recognizes the contributions of the different traditions. Hopefully, it will have an overarching view as to how we can work together for the promotion of human values and spirituality.&lt;ref name="London"&gt;Scott London, [http://www.scottlondon.com/interviews/smart.html The Future of Religion: An Interview with Ninian Smart.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Dimensions of religion===
Smart is widely known for his seven-part definition of religion, or rather scheme of study; as this approach avoids the problem of defining altogether. Whatever else religion may or may not be – whether theistic or non-theistic, religions possess certain recognisable elements, which can be studied. These dimensions vary in importance but are almost always present. Smart divided these into "historical" and "para-historical," meaning by the latter those dimensions that take the investigation into the experience, or inner lives, or religious people. The "historical" can be studied empirically, the para-historical takes the student into the realm of belief and concepts and requires dialogue and participation; "since the study of man is in an important sense participatory – for one has to enter into men's intentions, beliefs, myths, desires, in order to understand why they act as they do – it is fatal if cultures including our own are described merely externally, without entering into dialogue with them".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Smart|1968|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Smart's sevenfold scheme of study:
#Doctrinal
#Mythological
#Ethical
#Ritual
#Experiential
#Institutional
#Material (added in his 1989 text, ''The World's Religions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rennie|first1=Bryan S|title=The View of the Invisible World: Ninian Smart's Analysis of the Dimensions of Religion and of Religious Experience|url=http://www.westminster.edu/staff/brennie/RennieCSSR28.3.pdf|website=Westminster|publisher=ATLAS|accessdate=17 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
Note:  Smart categorised 1–3 as para-historical and 4–6 as historical.

==Legacy==
Smart’s contribution to Religious Studies continues to influence curricula, syllabi and methodology. In particular, his "dimensions of religion," a framework for comparing religions, has been influential within the academy. His willingness to take seriously what others saw as "illegitimate," such as ideologies and new religious movements, did much to allow Religious Studies to distinguish itself from theology and from any charge of privileging any particular faith or version of a faith. Hecht commented that, "When the definitive history of the study of religion in the 20th century is written..." Ninian Smart "will certainly be seen as a giant among his peers" since Smart's "many books opened religion to scholar and layperson alike".&lt;ref name="Hecht"/&gt; The Ninian Smart Annual Memorial Lecture, created in his honour, alternates between Lancaster and Santa Barbara. At Loyola, he is honoured by the Ninian Smart Award for Excellence in Religious Studies. In April 2001, the Santa Barbara Templeton Research Lecture series was dedicated to the memory of Smart, and a commemorative plaque was presented to the Smart family. He had been due to deliver a Templeton lecture himself.

==Personal life==
Smart married [[Libushka Baruffaldi]] in 1954. Their children were Roderick, Luisabel, Caroline and Peregrine. Smart had eight grandchildren at the time of his death.

Libushka was originally from [[Lake Como]], [[Italy]], where Smart regularly spent his summer vacations at his family home. Ninian and Libushka were the first from the Western academy to have their marriage blessed by [[Sun Myung Moon]] and [[Hak Ja Han|Mrs. Moon]] in August 1992.

Towards the end of his life, Smart described himself as a "Buddhist-[[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian]]", saying, "No religion, it seems to me, contains the whole truth. I think it's mad to think that there is nothing to learn from other traditions and civilizations. If you accept that other religions have something to offer and you learn from them, that is what you become: a Buddhist-Episcopalian or a Hindu-Muslim or whatever".&lt;ref name="London"/&gt;

'''Nur University''' of [[Bolivia]] was established as a [[Bahá'í school]] of higher education in August 1984 and started its first academic year in April 1985.&lt;ref&gt;[https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=es&amp;u=http://www.nur.edu/index.php%3Foption%3Dcom_content%26task%3Dview%26id%3D28%26Itemid%3D267&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3Dbah%25C3%25A1%2527%25C3%25AD%2Bsite:www.nur.edu%26hl%3Den%26biw%3D1183%26bih%3D715%26prmd%3Dimvnslb&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1Jt0UPasEoWx0QHRt4C4Bg&amp;ved=0CCkQ7gEwAQ Nur University Educational Philosophy], Official Website, Universidad Nur&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Following development of the Foundation for the Integral Development of Bolivia (FUNDESIB) in 1982, Nur University received Presidential Decree No. 20441 authorizing its establishment as a private university. It began offering undergraduate programs in 1985 and became Bolivia's first graduate college in 1994.

In 1996, Nur trained 2000 rural teachers as agents of community development in Bolivia and 300 teachers in the La Rioja Province in [[Argentina]].

The Bolivian Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports contracted Nur in 1999 to strengthen the academic and administrative capacities of two state teachers colleges: INSPOC in [[Camiri]] and INS Rafael Chávez Ortiz in [[Portachuelo]].

The university has 4,000 registered students in 17 undergraduate and graduate programs offered full- or part-time or through distance education.

==Accreditation and honors==
In 2000 the university received the highest distinction granted by the Santa Cruz Municipal Government, the Municipal Merit Medal, given for the community service work developed by the university through UNIRSE (University Students in Service to the Community). That same year Nur University received the "Pioneers in Education" prize, granted by the Bolivian Center for Research and Educational Action.

In 2001, the Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports called upon all the private universities in the country to submit to an evaluation process in accordance with the new private university regulations, in which Nur was evaluated as a "Full University".

In 2002 Nur University was selected as a "Center for Educational Excellence" for the Andean region: an initiative launched at the Summit for the Americas, supported by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).

[[File:An offering at Chaitya Bhoomi.png|thumb|An offering at [[Chaitya Bhoomi]].]]
In [[Buddhism]], symbolic '''offerings''' are made to the [[Triple Gem]], giving rise to contemplative gratitude and inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, Harvey (1990), pp. 172-3.&lt;/ref&gt;  Typical material offerings involve simple objects such as a lit candle or oil lamp,&lt;ref&gt;Indaratana (2002), pp. iv, v; Kapleau (1989), p. 193; Khantipalo (1982); Lee &amp; Thanissaro (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; burning incense,&lt;ref&gt;Indaratana (2002), pp. 11-12.&lt;/ref&gt; flowers,&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, Indaratana (2002), pp. 11-12. Harvey (1990), p. 173, and Kariyawasam (1995), chapter 1, both maintain that flowers are the most common form of offering.&lt;/ref&gt; food, fruit, water or drinks.&lt;ref&gt;Kapleau (1989), p. 193; Khantipalo (1982); and, Harvey (1990), p. 175, particularly in regards to Northern Buddhism.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the traditional Buddhist framework of [[karma]] and [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]], offerings lead to the accumulation of merit, which leads to:
:* a better [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]] in the  [[samsara|cycle of birth and death]] (Pali: ''vattagamini-kusala'')  
:* progress towards [[Nibbana|release from suffering]] (Pali: ''vivattagamini-kusala'').&lt;ref&gt;Lee &amp; Thanissaro (1998). See also Harvey (1990), p. 173, who in discussing "offerings" states: "Such acts consequently generate 'merit'."&lt;/ref&gt;

These offerings often act as preparation for [[Buddhist meditation|meditation]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, Indaratana (2002), p. v; Kapleau (1989), pp. 191''ff''.; and Khantipalo (1982).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theravada practices==

Material offerings nurture generosity (Pali:''[[dāna]]'') and virtue (Pali: ''[[sīla]]'').&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, Lee &amp; Thanissaro (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;  The act further honors the Triple Gem (the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], [[Dhamma]] and [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]]), deepening one's commitment to the [[Noble Eightfold Path|Buddha's path]]. For instance, traditional chants (in English and Pali) when offering lit candles (''padīpa pūjā'') and incense (''sugandha pūjā'') to an image of the Buddha are:
&lt;center&gt;
{| style="text-align:left; margin:0px 5px 0px 5px" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10"
|-----
|
With lights brightly shining&lt;br&gt;
Abolishing this gloom&lt;br&gt;
I adore the Enlightened One,&lt;br&gt;
The Light of the [[Trailõkya|three worlds]].&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;
With perfumed incense&lt;br&gt;
And fragrant smoke&lt;br&gt;
I worship the Exalted One,&lt;br&gt;
Who is great and worthy of worship.&lt;ref&gt;Indaratana (2002), p. 11.  See also Harvey (1990), p. 175, who translates the light-offering verse in part as describing the Buddha as "the lamp of the three worlds, dispeller of darkness."&lt;/ref&gt;
|
''{{IAST|Ghanasārappadittena}}''&lt;br&gt;
''{{IAST|Dīpena tama-dhaṃsinā}}''&lt;br&gt;
''{{IAST|Tiloka-dīpaṃ sambuddhaṃ}}''&lt;br&gt;
''{{IAST|Pūjayāmi tamo-nudaṃ}}''&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;
''{{IAST|Ghandha-sambhāra-yuttena}}''&lt;br&gt;
''{{IAST|Dhūpenāhaṃ sugandhinā}}''&lt;br&gt;
''{{IAST|Pūjaye pūjaneyyaṃ taṃ}}''&lt;br&gt;
''{{IAST|Pūjābhajanamuttamaṃ}}''&lt;ref name="Indaratana 2002, p. 12"&gt;Indaratana (2002), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;
|}&lt;/center&gt;

Similarly, a traditional Pali incense-lighting verse speaks of the Buddha's "fragrant body and fragrant face, fragrant with infinite virtues."&lt;ref name="Harvey 1990, p. 175"&gt;Harvey (1990), p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

By contemplating on an offering, one tangibly sees life's impermanence (Pali: ''[[anicca]]''), one of the [[three characteristics]] of all things upon which the Buddha encouraged his disciplines to [[Five remembrances|recollect]].  For instance, the end of a traditional chant (in English and Pali) when offering flowers (''puppha pūjā'') to an image of the Buddha is:
&lt;center&gt;
{| style="text-align:left; margin:0px 5px 0px 5px" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10"
|-----
|
I worship the Buddha with these flowers;&lt;br&gt;
May this virtue be helpful for my emancipation;&lt;br&gt;
Just as these flowers fade,&lt;br&gt;
Our body will undergo decay.&lt;ref&gt;Indaratana (2002), p. 11. Similarly, see Harvey (1990), p. 173; and, Kariyawasam (1995), ch. 1, sect. 2, "Personal Worship."&lt;/ref&gt;

''{{IAST|Kāyo tathā yāti vināsa-bhavam}}''&lt;ref name="Indaratana 2002, p. 12"/&gt;

==Mahayana practices==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 135-S-15-46-16, Tibetexpedition, Opfernde Tibeterin.jpg|Burning of incense before the [[Potala]], 1939|thumb]]
Mahayana material offerings might be imbued with the following symbology:
*the lighting of a candle or an oil lamp represents the light of wisdom illuminating the darkness of ignorance.
*the burning of incense represents the fragrant scent of morality.
*flowers represents the aspiration to achieve the body of the Buddha with the [[thirty-two marks of the Buddha]] as well as the teaching of [[anicca|impermanence]]. Alternately, a Zen verse expresses the desire for the mind's "flowers" to "bloom in the springtime of enlightenment."&lt;ref&gt;Harvey (1990), p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;
*food, fruit, water, drinks represents the nectar of Dharma and the wish to achieve it.

In [[Northern Buddhism]], sacred images have set before them:
* water (representing hospitality, to wash the face and feet)
* scarves (Tib. ''kha-btags'', offering friendship) 
* flowers, incense, lamps, perfume and food (representing one's devoting all their senses to their spiritual practice).&lt;ref name="Harvey 1990, p. 175"/&gt;

==Non-material offerings==

In some traditions, two different types of offerings are identified:
*material or hospitality offerings (Pali: ''amisa-puja''&lt;ref name="Lee &amp; Thanissaro 1998"&gt;Lee &amp; Thanissaro (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; or ''sakkara-puja''&lt;ref&gt;Khantipalo (1982).&lt;/ref&gt;)&lt;ref&gt;See also [[Alms#Buddhism]] regarding the traditional [[Theravada]] offering of providing daily alms to [[bhikkhus]].&lt;/ref&gt;
*practice offerings (Pali: ''patipatti-puja''&lt;ref&gt;Khantipalo (1982); Lee &amp; Thanissaro (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;)

In this context, material offerings are considered ''external'' offerings of "words and deeds."&lt;ref name="Lee &amp; Thanissaro 1998"/&gt;

Practice offerings may be manifested by practicing:
* giving (Pali: ''[[dāna]]'')
* moral conduct (''[[sīla]]'')
* meditation (''[[samādhi (Buddhism)|samādhi]]'') 
* wisdom (''[[Wisdom in Buddhism|pañña]]'')&lt;ref&gt;Khantipalo (1982); and, Nyanaponika (2000), pp. 298-299.  On the other hand, Lee &amp; Thanissaro (1998) identify ''only'' meditation as patipatti-puja.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the [[Pali Canon]], the Buddha declared practice offerings as "the best way of honoring the Buddha"&lt;ref&gt;Kantipalo (1982), ''n''. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; and as the "supreme" offering.&lt;ref name="Lee &amp; Thanissaro 1998"/&gt;  This is primarily an ''internal'' offering for mental development (Pali: ''citta'', ''[[bhāvanā]]'' and ''samādhi'').

Padharias get their name as traditional eaters of roots of [[Scirpus Groussus|''Bid'']] plant. The ' Bid ' root was unknown to almost all the people of Gujarat except Padharia and some other people. The Padharia males needed an amount of 1-1/2 to 2 [[Seer (unit)|seer]] and females needed 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 seer of 'Bid' food to keep themselves up, as noted by British authorities in their survey of 1905.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?ei=qG6_TsnbHsnorAewrdjHAQ&amp;ct=result&amp;id=nlbyAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=padharia&amp;q=padharias#search_anchor] Agricultural ledger, Volume 11, 1905, page 580&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?ei=p2-_TtT1JYjwrQfgss28AQ&amp;ct=result&amp;id=nlbyAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Bid+root+padharia&amp;q=Bid+root#search_anchor] Agricultural ledger, Volume 11, 1905, page 38&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Padmashali''' (also spelt as '''Padmasali''') is a [[Telugu language|Telugu]]-speaking [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[caste]] residing in the [[Indian people|Indian]] [[States and union territories of India|states]] of [[Telangana]], [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Karnataka]], [[Maharashtra]], [[Gujarat]] and [[Tamil Nadu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bfAMAQAAMAAJ|title=Communities, Segments, Synonyms, Surnames and Titles|last=Singh|first=Kumar Suresh|date=1996|publisher=Anthropological Survey of India|year=|isbn=9780195633573|location=|page=1654|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L3YMAQAAMAAJ|title=Identity, ecology, social organization, economy, linkages and development process: a quantitative profile|last=Singh|first=Kumar Suresh|last2=India|first2=Anthropological Survey of|date=1996|publisher=Anthropological Survey of India|year=|isbn=9780195633535|location=|page=109|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The term ''Padmashali'' is derived from two words ''Padma'' and ''Shali'', The [[Padma (attribute)|Padma]] means [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus]] and Shali means [[Weaving|weaver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DAb2jb5redYC|title=The Indian Textile Journal|last=|first=|date=1984|publisher=Business Press|year=|isbn=|location=|page=63|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word Padma referring to the myth of the thread was a lotus which sprang from the navel of [[Vishnu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?redir_esc=y&amp;id=-lY6AAAAMAAJ|title=The loom of interdependence: silkweaving cooperatives in Kanchipuram|last=Arterburn|first=Yvonne J.|date=1982|publisher=Hindustan Pub. Co.|year=|isbn=|location=|page=46|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Padmashalis support their mythological origins and ''[[Puranas]]'' such as ''Kulapurana'' and ''[[Markandeya Purana]]''.&lt;ref name="world" /&gt; 

The Padmashalis and the [[Devanga]]s, who are another caste of weavers, were originally a single caste in ancient times and followed [[Vaishnavism]]. The caste then split due to differences in faith, with the Devangas being influenced by Shaivism and [[Lingayatism]] and accepting Chamundeswari, the fierce form of [[Durga]] as their [[kuladevata|kuladevi]]. The Padmashalis maintained their belief in Vaishnavism. The Padmashalis eventually specialised in weaving clothes of all varieties.&lt;ref name="world"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t5XlI91kP3YC&amp;pg=PA31|title=The World of the Weaver in Northern Coromandel, C.1750-C.1850|last1=P|first1=Swarnalatha|publisher=Orient Longman Private Limited|year=|isbn=978-8-12502-868-0|edition=2005|location=Hyderabad|pages=31–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present==
Their subcastes are further divided into two groups based on [[Sampradaya]], being the Shaivas and the Vaishnavas. While the Shaivas give preference to worshipping [[Shiva]], the Vaishnavas give preference to worship of [[Vishnu]]. These religious and occupational distinctions are no bar, but we don't accept intermarriage and interdining.&lt;ref name="world"/&gt;

They worship local gods such as Gangamma, Chamundeswari and Yellamma. The latter is traditionally considered to be the mother of [[Parasurama]] and is identified with [[Renuka]].&lt;ref name="world"/&gt;

A '''Qareen''' ({{lang-ar|قرين}} ''qarīn'' literally meaning: 'constant companion'), is a spiritual double of human, either part of the human himself or a complementary creature in a [[Malakut|parallel dimension]].&lt;ref&gt;Anwer Mahmoud Zanaty ''Glossary Of Islamic Terms'' IslamKotob page 184&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kelly Bulkeley, Kate Adams, Patricia M. Davis ''Dreaming in Christianity and Islam: Culture, Conflict, and Creativity'' Rutgers University Press 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-813-54610-0}} page 144&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its ghostly nature, the Qareen is classified among the [[Jinn]]-type creatures, although usually not actually a Jinni.&lt;ref&gt;Veena Das, Clara Han ''Living and Dying in the Contemporary World: A Compendium'' Univ of California Press 2015 {{ISBN|978-0-520-27841-7}} page 145&lt;/ref&gt; The Qareen as an accompanying spirit should not be confused with the ''[[Succubus#Qarinah|Qarinah]]'' as a female "childbed demon" also existing in Middle Eastern faith.

==Qareen in Islam==
Qareen are mentioned in [[Sura|Sūrat]] [[az-Zukhruf]]:
"And whosoever turns away from remembering and mentioning the Most Beneficent, we appoint for him Shayatin to be a ''Qaree '' to him." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|43|36|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Several opinions exist on the exact nature of the Qareen. According to one opinion, the Qareen  is actually a [[Shaitan]], who incites humans with waswās ("evil suggestions"), but can became ''good'' in accordance with humans good deeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=''Majmū‘ al-Fatāwá'' |volume=1 |pages=359–361}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, it is said, that the Qareen of [[Muhammad]] became Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamqa.com/en/ref/26226][[IslamQA]]&lt;span&gt;: "Every person has a constant companion from among the &lt;/span&gt;''jinn''&lt;span&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However it is uncertain, whether or not, a Qareen  besides those of Muhammad, can actually become ''good''.

Another opinion holds, that Qareen refers to any type of spirit accompanying humans. Here, the Qareen  refers to both demons, who cast evil suggestions, but also to [[Angels in Islam|angels]], who advises to do good deeds.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly Bulkeley, Kate Adams, Patricia M. Davis ''Dreaming in Christianity and Islam: Culture, Conflict, and Creativity'' Rutgers University Press 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-813-54610-0}} page 144&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.medlinkstudents.com|title=Medlink Students on Qareen|last=Medlink|first=Students|date=23 May 2007|website=www.medlinkstudents.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further the Qareen is depicted as the other self: An integral spirit which is part of the person. A dissent between the inner Qareen and the behavior may cause the same symptoms as [[Exorcism in Islam|Jinn-possession]].&lt;ref&gt;audouin Dupret ''Standing Trial: Law and the Person in the Modern Middle East'' I.B.Tauris 2004 {{ISBN|978-1-860-64997-4}} page 154&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Veena Das, Clara Han ''Living and Dying in the Contemporary World: A Compendium'' Univ of California Press 2015 {{ISBN|978-0-520-27841-7}} page 145&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In Hadith ===
{{POV section|date=March 2018}}
With regard to the ''[[hadith]]'' of Muhammad, "There is none of you who does not have a companion (''Qareen'') appointed for him from among the ''[[jinn]]''." They said, "Even you?" He said, "Even me, but Allah helped me against him ''fa aslama'' [or ''fa aslamu''], so he only tells me to do that which is good." 

There are two well-known views that have been reported. Those who read the phrase as ''fa aslamu'' said that it means, "So I am safe [''aslamu''] from his evil and temptation." Those who read it as ''fa aslama'' said that it means, "The ''Qareen'' became Muslim [''aslama''] and became a believer, so he only tells me to do that which is good."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.islamqa.com/en/ref/23415 Islam Question and Answer - Praying for Jinn Companion to Become Muslim]&lt;/ref&gt;

They differed as to which view is correct. Al-Khattaabi said: The correct version is ''fa aslamu'' [so I am safe]. Al-Qaadi Iyaad thought that ''fa aslama'' [so he became Muslim] was correct, and this is the preferred version, because he then said, "so he only tells me to do that which is good." (Reported by Muslim, 2814). And they differed concerning the report that says ''fa aslama''. It was said that it means he submitted in the sense of surrendering, and it appears in this form (''fa astaslama'' – so he surrendered) in reports narrated elsewhere than in Saheeh Muslim. And it was said that it means that he become a Muslim and a believer. This is the apparent meaning.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Abu Na’eem al-Asbahaani said in Dalaa’il al-Nubuwwah (1/185): It was said ''aslama'' meaning he believed. Muhammad was the only one whose ''Qareen'' became a Muslim and a believer.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Based on this, having one's ''Qareen'' become a Muslim was something that was unique to Muhammad.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Furthermore, there is no evidence that the Companions ([[Sahaba]]) ever tried to convert their ''Qareen'' to become a Muslim.

== Other sources ==
The concept of a ''Qareen'' appears in pre-Islamic literature as well, and reminds to the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] [[Daemon (classical mythology)|daimones]] and the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[guardian angel]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosemary Ellen Guiley, Philip J. Imbrogno ''The Vengeful Djinn: Unveiling the Hidden Agenda of Genies''Llewellyn Worldwide 2011 {{ISBN|978-0-738-72881-0}} page 117&lt;/ref&gt; In Pre-Islamic Arabian the Qareen is said to be able to inspire poets for their works.&lt;ref&gt;Baudouin Dupret ''Standing Trial: Law and the Person in the Modern Middle East'' I.B.Tauris 2004 {{ISBN|978-1-860-64997-4}} page 153&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the seven [[mu'allaqat]]—Arabic poems recognized as masterpieces during the pre-Islamic period—uses the word as a metaphor. To describe his tribe's excellence in battle, poet Amr bin Kulthum says that "every tribe has taken fear of us as a ''qarin'' (or "constant companion")," meaning that their fear of Amr's tribe is always present. This goes further to show the origin of the word ''qareen'', as described in the Arabic dictionary as a 'companion'

The most widely professed '''religion in Croatia''' is [[Christianity]] and a large majority of the [[Demographics of Croatia|Croatian population]] declare themselves to be members of the [[Catholic Church]]. Croatia has no official religion and [[Freedom of religion]] is a right defined by the [[Constitution of Croatia|Constitution]] of [[Croatia]], which also defines all [[religious denomination|religious communities]] as [[separation of church and state|equal in front of the law and separate from the state]].

==History==
In the 16th century, [[Protestantism]] reached Croatia, but was mostly eradicated due to the [[Counter-Reformation]] implemented by the [[Habsburgs]].

==Demographics==
According to the 2011 census 86.28% of Croatians are Catholics, while [[Orthodox Christians]] make up 4.44% of the population, [[Muslims]] 1.47%, and [[Protestants]] 0.34% of the population. 3.81% of Croatians are not religious and atheists, 0.76% are agnostics and sceptics, and 2.17% are undeclared.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Croatian Census 2011|R|accessdate=2014-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Eurostat]] Eurobarometer Poll of 2005, 67% of the population of Croatia responded that "they believe there is a God".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Special EUROBAROMETER 225 "Social values, Science &amp; Technology"|url=http://ec.europa.eu/commfrontoffice/publicopinion/archives/ebs/ebs_225_report_en.pdf#page=11|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2009 Gallup poll, 70% answered yes to the question "Is religion an important part of your daily life?".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gallup.com/poll/128210/Gallup-Global-Reports.aspx | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131014034457/http://www.gallup.com/poll/128210/Gallup-Global-Reports.aspx | archivedate = 2013-10-14 | title = Gallup Global Reports | publisher = [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]] | accessdate = 2013-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, only 24% of the population attends religious services regularly.&lt;ref name="Pew Survey 2017 - Final Topline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/05/09154356/Central-and-Eastern-Europe-Topline_FINAL-FOR-PUBLICATION.pdf |title=Final Topline   |accessdate=19 June 2017 |publisher=Pew}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interaction between Religious and Secular Life==
[[File:Православна црква у Загребу.JPG|200px|thumbnail|[[Zagreb Orthodox Cathedral]]]]
[[File:Zagrebačka džamija.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Central [[Mosque]] in [[Zagreb]].]]
[[Public school (government funded)|Public schools]] allow religious teaching in cooperation with religious communities having agreements with the state, but attendance is not mandated. Religion classes ({{lang-hr|vjeronauk}}) are organized widely in public elementary and secondary schools, most commonly coordinated with the Catholic Church.

The [[public holidays in Croatia]] also include the [[religious festival]]s ({{lang-hr|blagdan}}) of Epiphany, Easter Monday, Corpus Christi Day, Assumption Day, All Saints' Day, Christmas, and St. Stephen's or Boxing Day. The primary holidays are based on the Catholic [[liturgical year]], but other believers are legally allowed to celebrate other major religious holidays.

[[Marriage]]s conducted by the religious communities having agreements with the state are officially recognized, eliminating the need to register the marriages in the civil registry office.

The [[Catholic Church in Croatia]] receives state financial support and other benefits established in [[concordat]]s between the Government and the [[Holy See|Vatican]]. The concordats and other government agreements with non-Catholic religious communities allow state financing for some salaries and pensions for religious officials through government-managed pension and health funds.&lt;ref name="countryreports_croatia"&gt;{{cite web | publisher = CountryReports | year = 2009 | title = "Croatia Religion" - Electronic version | accessdate = September 26, 2009 | url = http://www.countryreports.org/?countryid=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concordats and agreements also regulate public school [[catechism]]s and [[military chaplain]]s.&lt;ref name="countryreports_croatia"/&gt;

In line with the concordats signed with the Roman Catholic Church and in an effort to further define their rights and privileges within a legal framework, the government has additional agreements with the following 14 religious and Faith communities:&lt;ref name="countryreports_croatia"/&gt;

==Legal status==
{{Main|Freedom of religion in Croatia}}
The 2002 Law on the Legal Position of Religious Communities broadly defines religious and Faith communities' legal positions and covers such matters as government funding, tax benefits, and religious education in schools. Matters such as pensions for clergy; religious service in the military, penitentiaries, and police; and recognition of religious and Faith marriages are left to each religious and Faith community to negotiate separately with the Government.&lt;ref name="countryreports_croatia"/&gt;

Registration of religious groups is not obligatory; however, registered groups are granted "legal person" status and enjoy tax and other benefits. The law stipulates that to be eligible for registration, a religious group must have at least 500 believers and be registered as an association for 5 years. All religious and Faith groups in the country prior to passage of the law in 2002 were registered without having to meet these conditions; religious and Faith groups new to the country after passage of the law must fulfill the requirements for the minimum number of believers and time as an association. Religious and Faith groups based abroad must submit written permission for registration from their country of origin.&lt;ref name="countryreports_croatia"/&gt; Minister of Public Administration runs a Registry of religious organizations in Republic of Croatia, currently recognizing 62 religious communities ({{as of|2013|lc=on}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.uprava.hr/default.aspx?id=671 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140714213210/http://www.uprava.hr/default.aspx?id=671 | archivedate = 2014-07-14 | language = Croatian | title = Evidencija vjerskih zajednica u Republici Hrvatskoj | publisher = Ministry of Public Administration | accessdate = 2013-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gervais began his stand-up career in the late 1990s. He has performed five multi-national stand-up comedy tours, and wrote the ''[[Flanimals]]'' book series.

==Career==

===Music===
In 1983, during his final year as a student at UCL (University College London), Gervais and college friend [[Bill Macrae]] formed the [[New wave music|new wave]] pop [[Musical ensemble|duo]], [[Seona Dancing]].

In 2013, Gervais performed a live tour as [[David Brent]] along with a band under the name "Foregone Conclusion". Gervais and the band performed songs written under the Brent character including songs such as "Equality Street" and "[[Free Love Freeway]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/various-artists/73215 |title=Ricky Gervais plays debut David Brent show with former Razorlight star in London |work=[[NME]] |date=14 October 2013 |accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gervais also produced a series of YouTube videos under the title 'Learn Guitar with David Brent', featuring acoustic guitar versions of nine songs.

In 2016, as part of the ''Life on Road'' film promotion, Gervais published the ''David Brent Songbook'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01HBPUIC6/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1 |title=David Brent Songbook eBook: David Brent: Amazon.co.uk: Kindle Store |publisher=Amazon.co.uk |date= |accessdate=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; containing 15 songs.

After the first series of ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]'', Gervais and Merchant returned to [[Xfm]] in November 2001 for a Saturday radio show. This was when the pair first worked with [[Karl Pilkington]], who produced the shows and later collaborated with them on their series of [[podcast]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gigwise.com/news/5930/ricky-gervais-and-stephen-merchant-return-to-xfm|title=Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant Return to Xfm|work=Gigwise |accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2017, Gervais began hosting the weekly radio show ''Ricky Gervais Is Deadly Sirius'' on [[Sirius XM Holdings|Sirius XM]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Spangler|first1=Todd|title=Ricky Gervais on New SiriusXM Talk Show: They ‘Made Me an Offer I Couldn’t Refuse’|url=https://variety.com/2017/digital/news/ricky-gervais-siriusxm-comedy-talk-show-1202593641/|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=21 October 2017|date=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together called "The Podfather Trilogy", they debuted individually at Halloween, Thanksgiving and Christmas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Podfather-Trilogy-Season-Gervais/dp/B002SPXUZC|title=The Podfather Trilogy|publisher=Amazon.co.uk|accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These three were known by Ricky and Steve as "The Fourth Season". In October 2007 another free full-length podcast was released through iTunes; this podcast was originally given out for free during a performance of Gervais' ''[[Fame (comedy)|Fame]]'' stand-up tour in London. On 25 November 2007 Gervais, Merchant and Pilkington released another free full-length podcast, which lasted just over an hour.

In August 2008, Gervais, Merchant and Pilkington recorded their fifth season of [[audiobook]]s, totaling 4 chapters, which were released on 16 September 2008. These audiobooks were described as the 'guide to...' series, covering several topics. As of May 2011, there are 12 "Guides" in total: Medicine, Natural History, Arts, Philosophy, The English, Society, Law &amp; Order, The Future, The Human Body, The Earth, The [[World Cup 2010]], and [[Comic Relief]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=The+ricky+gervais+guide+to|title=The Ricky Gervais Guide to...|publisher=Amazon.co.uk|accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conversations typically begin on topic, but constantly stray away from the topic at hand.

===Television===

====Early television appearances====
[[File:RickyGervaisBAFTA07.jpg|thumb|upright|Gervais at the [[60th British Academy Film Awards]] in 2007]]
Gervais has contributed to the [[BAFTA]]-winning ''[[The Sketch Show]]'' (ITV), penning several sketches. His mainstream-TV debut came in September 1998 as part of [[Channel 4]]'s "Comedy Lab" series of pilots. His one-off show ''[[Golden Years (TV programme)|Golden Years]]'' focused on a [[David Bowie]]–obsessed character called Clive Meadows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/pictures/the-long-funny-career-of-ricky-gervais-20110404/golden-years-1998-0520409Aa|title=The Long, Funny Career of Ricky Gervais|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|first=Tom |last=Eames|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gervais then came to much wider national attention with an obnoxious, cutting persona featured in a topical slot that replaced [[Ali G]]'s segments on the satirical Channel 4 comedy programme ''[[The 11 O'Clock Show]]'' in early 1999, in which his character used as many [[Profanity|expletive]]s as was possible and produced an inordinate amount of politically incorrect statements. Among the other regular featured comedians on the show was [[Mackenzie Crook]], later a co-star of ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]''. Two years later, Gervais went on to present his own comedy chat show for Channel 4 called ''[[Meet Ricky Gervais]]''; it was poorly received and has since been mocked by Gervais himself.

Throughout this time, Gervais also wrote for the BBC sketch show ''[[Bruiser (TV series)|Bruiser]]'' and ''The [[Jim Tavare]] Show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/people/ricky_gervais_person_page.shtml|title=Comedy People A-Z Ricky Gervais
|publisher=BBC|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;''

====''The Office''====
{{Main|The Office (UK TV series)}}
''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]'' started when [[Stephen Merchant]], while on a BBC production course, had to make his own short film. In August 1999 he made a docu-soap parody, set in an office, with help from [[Ash Atalla]], who was shown a 7-minute video called 'The Seedy Boss'. Thus [[David Brent]] was created. Merchant passed this tape on to the BBC's Head of Entertainment [[Paul Jackson (producer)|Paul Jackson]] at the [[Edinburgh Fringe]], who then passed it on to Head of Comedy [[Jon Plowman]], who eventually commissioned a full-pilot script from Merchant and Gervais.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/profiles/story/0,,1250074,.html|title=The Guardian profile: Ricky Gervais
|work=The Guardian|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first six-episode series of ''The Office'' aired in the UK in July and August 2001 to little fanfare or attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msn.com/en-ph/entertainment/people/ricky-gervais/AA3l0x9|title=Ricky Gervais| publisher=[[MSN]] |accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Word-of-mouth, repeats, and DVDs helped spread the word, building up momentum and anticipation for the second series, also comprising six episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/profiles/story/0,,1250074,.html|title=The Guardian profile: Ricky Gervais|work=The Guardian|date=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the success of ''The Office''{{'s}} second series, Gervais was named the [[Radio Times's Most Powerful People in TV Comedy|most powerful person in TV comedy]] by ''[[Radio Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/2631307.stm|title=Gervais crowned 'king of comedy'|date=6 January 2003|publisher=BBC News|location=London|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6tRevTA3J?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2631307.stm|archivedate=13 September 2017|dead-url=no|accessdate=13 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, ''The Office'' won the [[Golden Globe]]s for Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy and Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series – Musical or Comedy for Gervais, who said in a 2015 BBC interview that the award was the gateway to America for him.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation|last=Husam sam Asi|title=What does Ricky Gervais really think of the Golden Globes? - Interview|date=16 January 2016|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfbPlRseDPU|accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Office]]'' brand has since been remade for audiences in [[:sv:Kontoret|Sweden]], [[Le Bureau|France]], [[Stromberg (TV series)|Germany]], [[La Job|Quebec]], [[Os Aspones|Brazil]] and the [[The Office (U.S. TV series)|United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://splitsider.com/2011/05/exploring-the-international-franchises-of-the-office/|title=Exploring the International Franchises of The Office|publisher=Splitsider.com|accessdate=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gervais and Merchant are producers of the American version, and they also co-wrote the episode "[[The Convict]]" for the show's third season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4687784.stm|title=Gervais writing US Office episode|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=25 January 2015|date=7 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gervais has said that the episode "[[Episode Four (The Office, Series One)|Training]]" is his favourite, where Brent plays his guitar and sings.

====''Extras''====
{{Main|Extras (TV series)}}
[[Extras (TV series)|''Extras'']] had its debut on the BBC on 21 July 2005; directed by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, the sitcom ran for twelve episodes and starred Gervais as Andy Millman, a [[Extra (actor)|background artist]]. Millman is more self-aware and intentionally humorous than Gervais' ''The Office'' character David Brent. Guest stars on the first series of ''Extras'' include [[Ross Kemp]], [[Les Dennis]], [[Patrick Stewart]], [[Vinnie Jones]], [[Samuel L. Jackson]], [[Ben Stiller]], [[Kate Winslet]] and [[Francesca Martinez]]. A second series began on 14 September 2006 in the UK and featured appearances by [[Daniel Radcliffe]], [[Diana Rigg|Dame Diana Rigg]], [[Orlando Bloom]], [[Ian McKellen|Sir Ian McKellen]], [[Chris Martin]], [[Keith Chegwin]], [[Robert Lindsay (actor)|Robert Lindsay]], [[Warwick Davis]], [[Ronnie Corbett]], [[Stephen Fry]], [[Richard Briers]], [[Patricia Potter]], [[Sophia Myles]], [[Moira Stuart]], [[David Bowie]], [[Kate Winslet]], [[Robert De Niro]] and [[Jonathan Ross]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2007/dec/28/lastnightstvextras |title=Extras attacked celebrity - with a little help from George Michael, David Tennant et al|work=The Guardian|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:JonathanRossRickyGervais.jpg|thumb|Gervais (right) with [[Jonathan Ross]] at [[Live 8]] in July 2005]]
A Christmas special of ''Extras'' aired on 27 December 2007 in the UK and on 16 December 2007 in the US, featuring guest appearances by [[George Michael]], [[Clive Owen]], [[Gordon Ramsay]], Jonathan Ross and [[David Tennant]].

Gervais was influenced by ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'', in making ''Extras'', particularly in the format of celebrities making fools of themselves or subverting their public personas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/pictures/the-curb-effect-how-larry-david-changed-comedy-forever-20110720/ricky-gervais-0166936|title=Tricky Gervais The Curb Effect How Larry David Changed Comedy Forever |work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Gervais won the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series]] for his portrayal of Andy Millman in the second series of ''Extras''. As Gervais was not present at the awards ceremony, the trophy was accepted on his behalf by [[Steve Carell]], the actor who starred as regional manager [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] – the counterpart to Gervais' David Brent – on [[The Office (U.S. TV series)|the American adaptation of ''The Office'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/lat-accep-carel_johsi3nc20090817152500-photo.html |title=Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert and Steve Carell accept Ricky Gervais' Emmy |publisher=LA Times |date=5 November 2017 |accessdate=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s Chris Tryhorn explained the "few gripes" he had with ''Extras'', "particularly in the second series". "You can forgive Gervais a certain arrogance after the success of ''The Office'', but..." He remarks on the confused tone of the series, taking in the clash between the broad comedy of characters Barry ([[Shaun Williamson]]) and Darren ([[Stephen Merchant]]), and the apparent parody of this style with ''When The Whistle Blows'', and "given their total indulgence of Gervais, the BBC is portrayed as interfering, its comedy department run by a rather crudely [[stereotype]]d gay couple".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/organgrinder/2006/sep/22/extrasworkneededricky|title=Extras work needed, Ricky?|first=Chris |last=Tryhorn|work=The Guardian|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''The Ricky Gervais Show''====
''[[The Ricky Gervais Show (animated series)|The Ricky Gervais Show]]'' is an animated TV show that debuted on US cable network [[HBO]] on 19 February 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/gervais-series-hbo-1013291/|title=Ricky Gervais Gets Animated for New HBO Series|last=Stanhope|first=Kate |date=22 December 2009|work=[[TV Guide]] | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151026214901/http://www.tvguide.com/news/gervais-series-hbo-1013291/ | archivedate=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2010/01/tca-press-tour.html|title=TCA press tour: Ricky Gervais finds comedy gold in a round-headed minion|last=Press|first=Joy |date=14 January 2010|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, the first series began airing on 23 April 2010 on [[Channel 4]]. The show was developed using original podcast recordings from ''[[The Ricky Gervais Show]]'' starring Gervais, [[Stephen Merchant]], and [[Karl Pilkington]]. After receiving a loyal and enthusiastic following in the US, cable channel [[HBO]] recommissioned the show for a second series, which aired in 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/mar/24/ricky-gervais-show-hbo | title=Ricky Gervais Show gets second HBO series | date=24 March 2010 |work=The Guardian | location=London | accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a third series which started airing in April 2012.

====''Life's Too Short''====
{{Main|Life's Too Short (TV series)}}

''[[Life's Too Short (TV series)|Life's Too Short]]'' began airing on [[BBC Two]] on 10 November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sykes|first=Jaine|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/comedy/2011/06/lifes-too-short-1.shtml|title=Life's Too Short |publisher=BBC Blog|accessdate=4 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2TtqePh3xw|title=Tweet That! – Life's Too Short|date=10 October 2011|accessdate=17 October 2011|publisher=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gervais and Stephen Merchant would write this [[observational comedy|observational]] sitcom from an idea by [[Warwick Davis]]. It is described by Gervais as being about "the life of a showbiz [[Dwarfism|dwarf]]" and as "a cross between ''Extras'' and ''The Office''". The show stars actor Davis playing a fictionalized version of himself, as well as Gervais and Merchant.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/aug/24/ricky-gervais-lifes-too-short|title=Ricky Gervais plans Life's Too Short film|date=24 August 2010|accessdate=15 September 2010|work=[[The Guardian]]|first=Ben|last=Child|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Premium cable channel [[HBO]], who co-produced the series with the BBC, had the US rights and began airing the series on 19 February 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/television/Ricky-Gervais-Steven-Merchant-Warwick-Davis-Tease-Life-Too-Short-36112.html|title=Ricky Gervais, Steven Merchant, And Warwick Davis Tease Life's Too Short|publisher=Cinemablend.com|date=17 October 2011|accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/ustv/news/a326379/ricky-gervais-lifes-too-short-heads-for-hbo.html |title=Ricky Gervais 'Life's Too Short' heads for HBO – US TV News |publisher=Digital Spy |date=23 June 2011 |accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''An Idiot Abroad''====
{{Main|An Idiot Abroad}}
''[[An Idiot Abroad]]'' is a travel documentary produced by Gervais and Merchant where a reluctant Pilkington travels around the world, while his reactions to people and places is recorded. Occasionally, Gervais and Merchant call him to surprise him with a new place to visit or a task to do. Pilkington reports back to them and mostly complains about the situation he is in. Gervais said there is no planning, a camera crew follows his friend around recording many hours of film which Gervais edits down to about an hour each episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/11326209|title=Ricky Gervais says show with Karl Pilkington is real|publisher=BBC|accessdate =6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To date two series and a Christmas special have aired, series one involves Pilkington visiting the Seven Wonders of the World, in the second show he chooses to complete tasks from a bucket list provided by Gervais and in the special Warwick Davis joins Pilkington on a journey following Marco Polo's route from Italy to China.

====''Derek''====
{{Main|Derek (TV series)}}
In November 2011, Gervais filmed in London a 35-minute pilot episode for a potential [[comedy-drama]] series called ''[[Derek (TV series)|Derek]]'', which aired on [[Channel 4]] on 12 April 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Plumplard.com |date=August 2004 |url=http://rickygervais.com/thissideofthetruthe.php |title=Ricky Gervais...

British comedian [[Kerry Godliman]] plays Derek's best friend Hannah and David Earl plays Kev.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/derek/episode-guide/series-1/episode-1 |title=Derek |publisher=[[Channel 4]] |date=29 March 2012 |accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gervais said that the series is about "kindness [being] more important than anything else". He added "It's about the forgotten – everyone's forgotten. It's all these arbitrary people who didn't know each other, and they're in there now because they're in the last years of their life. And it's about the people who help them, who themselves are losers and have their own problems. It's about a bunch of people with nothing, but making the most of it, and they're together." He chose to set the sitcom in a retirement home after he watched ''[[Secret Millionaire]]'' – "It was always these people with huge problems who were helping other people. I thought about having Derek help old people because no one cares about old people in this country... I think it's perfect for now."&lt;ref name=independentderek&gt;{{cite news|last=Gilbert|first=Gerard|title='Mock the disabled?

===Stand-up comedy===
Gervais began his stand-up career in the late 1990s; his first successful show took place at the [[Cafe Royal]], as part of the [[2001 Edinburgh Festival Fringe]]. Titled ''Rubbernecker'', the show also featured [[Jimmy Carr]], [[Robin Ince]] and [[Stephen Merchant]].

Gervais later toured the UK in 2003 with his stand-up show ''[[Animals (comedy)|Animals]]''. The ''[[Politics (comedy)|Politics]]'' tour followed a year later. Both of these shows were recorded for release on DVD and television broadcast. The third part of the themed live trilogy, ''[[Fame (comedy)|Fame]]'', took place in 2007. It started in [[Glasgow]] in January and ended in [[Sheffield]] in April. [[Blackpool]] reported selling out of tickets within 45 minutes of them going on sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2006/12/13/4816/what_a_sell-out|title=What a sell-out, Huge demand for Gervais tour}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:RickyGervais.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Gervais performing in 2007]]
''[[Newsnight Review]]'''s panel saw ''Animals'' during its [[UCL Bloomsbury|Bloomsbury]] run and covered it in January 2003. They were not favourable, with ''[[Private Eye]]'' editor [[Ian Hislop]] saying it was "cobbled together...banal...a bit flat".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/review/2654105.stm|title=BBC News, 13&amp;nbsp;January 2003 | date=13 January 2003 | accessdate=27 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this, Gervais closed each show by calling Hislop an "ugly little pug-faced cunt".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/showbiz/news/a179513/ten-things-you-never-knew-about-ricky-gervais.html|title=Ten Things You Never Knew About Ricky Gervais|publisher=Digital Spy|first=Alex |last=Fletcher|accessdate=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/newsnight/review/2654105.stm|title=Newsnight Review discussed Ricky Gervais one man show Animals at the Bloomsbury Theatre in London.|publisher=BBC|accessdate=24 January 2015|date=13 January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Fame'' was the subject of some controversy in January 2007 when Gervais told a story, ostensibly about how people will do anything to become famous, referring to [[Ipswich serial murders|the murder of prostitutes in Ipswich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gervais apologetic over 'killing' joke|url=http://www.ipswichstar.co.uk/news/gervais_apologetic_over_killing_joke_1_112739|website=Ipswich Star|accessdate=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Gervais announced that his next stand up show will be called ''Humanity''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2013-01-17/ricky-gervais-returning-to-stand-up-comedy-i-think-it-will-be-my-angriest-yet|title=Ricky Gervais returning to stand-up comedy: "I think it will be my angriest yet"|work=[[Radio Times]]|accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2014, he said he was too busy to do his tour due to producing two films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2014-12-08/ricky-gervais-why-my-humanity-live-stand-up-tour-is-on-hold-for-now|title=Ricky Gervais Why My Humanity Live Stand Uo Tour is On Hold for Now|work=Radio Times|accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016, Gervais was back doing stand up in London, starting with some low key warm-ups with cast members from ''[[Derek (TV series)|Derek]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2016-03-29/ricky-gervais-is-performing-stand-up-gigs-in-london-this-may|title=Ricky Gervais is performing stand up gigs in London this May|work=Radiotimes|accessdate=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said, "Finally, I'm going to do some stand-up. The first in about six years if you don't count hosting the [[Golden Globes]]."

He continued his ''Humanity'' show throughout 2017 and into 2018; appearing at [[SF Sketchfest]] as part of the tour, which devoted a night in honor of the comedian, alongside comedic legend and mentor [[Christopher Guest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ricky Gervais to appear at SF Sketchfest before taking on ‘Humanity’|url=http://www.sfchronicle.com/performance/article/Ricky-Gervais-to-appear-at-SF-Sketchfest-before-12473686.php|website=SF Chronicle|accessdate=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His next tour and [[Netflix]] special was announced in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2018/04/20/39738/ricky_gervais_announces_his_first_supernature_gigs|title=Ricky Gervais announces his first SuperNature gigs : News 2018 : Chortle : The UK Comedy Guide|first=Powder Blue Internet Business|last=Solutions|website=www.chortle.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Animation====
One of the first animations Gervais voiced was the character of Penguin in [[Robbie the Reindeer]]'s ''Legend of the Lost Tribe''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/episode/n2kph/robbie-the-reindeer-in-legend-of-the-lost-tribe|title=Robbie the Reindeer in Legend of the Lost Tribe|work=Radio Times|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gervais guest-starred in an episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' entitled "[[Homer Simpson, This Is Your Wife]]". He is the only British comic to write and star in a ''Simpsons'' episode. The episode was the highest rated in Sky One's history; it revolved around the angle that Gervais was the episode's sole writer (and the first guest star on the show to also receive a writing credit for the episode of his appearance). Gervais clarified the extent of his input in a joint interview (with Christopher Guest) for ''[[Dazed &amp; Confused (magazine)|Dazed and Confused]]'' magazine (January 2006): "No, all I did was put down a load of observations on an email and they made it look like a ''Simpsons'' script. I'm going to get the credit, but I think everyone in the industry knows it was a joint effort". Asked in a separate interview about how his idea for the episode (in which Homer swaps Marge on a game show) came about, Gervais replied: "I've always been fascinated with reality game shows but I think it was my girlfriend's idea. We watch ''[[Big Brother (UK)|Celebrity Big Brother]]'' at the moment, we watch ''[[I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!|I'm a Celebrity, Get Me out of Here...]]'' we watch all those reality TV shows&amp;nbsp;– ''The Office'' came out of those docu-soaps".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukula.com/TorontoArticle.aspx?SectionID=3&amp;ObjectID=1665&amp;CityID=3|title= Interview at UKULA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gervais, a longstanding ''Simpsons'' fan, presented a segment to mark the show's 20th anniversary on [[BBC Two]]'s ''[[The Culture Show]]'' on 16 June 2007.

In 2012, Gervais made a guest appearance on ''[[Family Guy]]'' in the episode titled "[[Be Careful What You Fish For]]". In the episode, Gervais plays a dolphin named Billy Finn who gives [[Peter Griffin]] a [[Mercedes-Benz]] hood ornament, Peter half-heartedly promises a favor to him. Soon, Billy moves to Quahog but outstays his welcome at Peter's. Peter tries to reunite Billy with his ex-wife in hopes that he will return to the ocean. The episode also featured [[Lucy Davis]]. Both Gervais and Davis starred together in ''The Office''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Be Careful What You Fish For|url= http://www.avclub.com/articles/be-careful-what-you-fish-for,69550/|work= The A.V Club|last= MacFarland|first= Kevin|date= 20 February 2012|accessdate= 15 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In season 8 episode 6 ''The Hero'' of the HBO series ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'', Gervais was a guest at Larry David's dinner table.

[[Louis C.K.]] had Gervais play Dr. Ben, his doctor on two episodes of his series ''[[Louie (U.S. TV series)|Louie]]''.

====Entertainment====
Gervais made a cameo appearance on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in a ''Digital Short'' during which he joked that ''The Office'' was adapted from a Japanese programme of the same name (with [[Steve Carell]] reprising his role as Michael Scott). The sketch re-creates scenes from the American and British pilot episode with Japanese elements (although in an exaggerated way). "It's funny", Gervais laughs at the end, "because it's racist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/ustv/news/a437948/ricky-gervais-to-host-saturday-night-live.html|title=Ricky Gervais to host 'Saturday Night Live'?|date=13 November 2012|publisher=Digital Spy|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His 2011 hosting of the awards was controversial for his edgy jokes that were at the expense of many of the nominees, similar to the New York Friars Club roast style jokes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-12206235|title=Globes host Ricky Gervais explains ceremony absence|date=17 January 2011|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=17 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His jibes were described as setting "a corrosive tone" by one critic, though some celebrities were seen crying from laughter, leaving the overall reaction to be 'mixed'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-12205469|title=Mixed reaction to Ricky Gervais as Golden Globes host|date=17 January 2011|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=17 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/entertainment/post/2011/01/ricky-gervais-opens-golden-globes-with-shot-at-sheen/1|title=Ricky Gervais opens Golden Globes with shot at Sheen|date=16 January 2011|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=17 January 2011|first=Ann|last=Oldenburg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gervais responded, "They are my friends, but I had to play the outsider."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Concert for Diana and Live Earth===
On 1 July 2007, Gervais performed at the [[Concert for Diana]] in [[Wembley Stadium]], a music event celebrating the life of [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Princess Diana]] 10 years after her death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/concertfordiana/timeline/ |title= Concert for Diana - What happened minute by minute|work=BBC News|accessdate=17 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of the event—after a pre-recorded introduction from [[Ben Stiller]]—Gervais appeared along with fellow ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|Office]]'' star [[Mackenzie Crook]]. They performed "[[Free Love Freeway]]", a song previously heard in the fourth episode of series one of ''The Office''. Due to a technical problem, Gervais then had to fill time until he was able to re-introduce [[Elton John]] to close the show, so he did the David Brent dance again, as well as singing the "Little Fat Man" song as performed by [[David Bowie]] in episode two of the second series of ''[[Extras (TV series)|Extras]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.metafilter.com/57740/Pathetic-little-fat-man-noones-bloody-laughing|title=Ricky Gervais Has Lost It|publisher=Metafilter.com|accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2007, following Gervais' appearance at the memorial concert for the Princess of Wales, ''The Guardian'' ran a column by ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' television critic [[Jim Shelley (TV critic)|Jim Shelley]] entitled "Call Me Crazy... But Has Ricky Gervais Lost It?", where he described Gervais as a "tiresome embarrassment". The following week, ''The Guardian'' noted that Gervais had responded with "an exhilaratingly foul-mouthed tirade" on his website, concluding with the sentence "yes I am resting on my fucking laurels you cunt!" In this video, Gervais mocked Jim Shelley typing the words "resting on his laurels" as Gervais jokingly lashed out by stating that he was resting on his laurels and that he was not going to make another show for television, quipping: "What's the point? What is there to beat?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/organgrinder/2007/jul/11/rickygervaishaslostit|title=Ricky Gervais Has Lost It|work=The Guardian|accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 1950, [[Dianetics]] was mentioned in Australia as "the latest craze in Hollywood"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18483835 |title=Hollywood has a cure-all |newspaper=[[The Sunday Herald (Sydney)|The Sunday Herald]] |location=Sydney |date=1 October 1950 |accessdate=13 August 2013 |page=12 Supplement: Sunday Herald Features |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the "Hubbard sub-mind method" was explained under the heading "World of Science".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article42664974 |title=Sub-mind recordings |newspaper=[[The Cairns Post]] |author=Blakeslee, Harold W. |location=Qld. |date=22 April 1950 |accessdate=13 August 2013 |page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this also meant Hubbard, founder of the Dianetics Mental Health movement, was also newsworthy when his wife claimed he was 'hopelessly insane' in their divorce case and this was reported in several major papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article27017179 |title=Says Mental Expert Husband Insane |newspaper=[[The Mercury (Hobart)|The Mercury]] |location=Hobart, Tas. |date=25 April 1951 |accessdate=13 August 2013 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article50105365 |title=Sanity "Expert" Mad, Claims Wife |newspaper=[[The Courier-Mail]] |location=Brisbane |date=25 April 1951 |accessdate=13 August 2013 |page=1 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article45704449 |title=Wife Says Mental Expert "Hopelessly Insane" |newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]] |location=Adelaide |date=25 April 1951 |accessdate=13 August 2013 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 1950s, advertisements mentioning Scientology began to appear in newspapers. Scientology Associates (Mental Health) offered "professional psycho-therapeutic treatments"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article23244044 |title=Advertising |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=13 May 1953 |accessdate=13 August 2013 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; while for "Rev. John R. Farrell, Church of Scientology" it was "Personal Relations. – I will talk to anyone for you about anything".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article71788991 |title=Advertising |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=29 December 1955 |accessdate=13 August 2013 |page=13 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; And in April 1954 the [[Hubbard Association of Scientologists International]] held the First Australian Scientology Congress in [[Prahran, Victoria]], over four days, featuring "American Lecturers, John and Tuck Farrell, and English lecturer, Raymond Kemp, all Doctors of Scientology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article65383944 |title=Advertising |newspaper=[[Healesville Guardian]] |location=Lilydale, Vic. |date=18 March 1955 |accessdate=13 August 2013 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1959, L. Ron Hubbard travelled to Australia and delivered lectures on 7 to 8 November at the Melbourne Congress and the First Melbourne Advanced Clinical Course from 9 to 30 November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hubbard, L.

==Interaction with education==
Through its group [[Citizens Commission on Human Rights]], Scientology is active in the media about what it claims are the dangers of psychiatric drugs and the treatment of ADHD and has arranged at least one anti-psychiatry exhibition in Australia. That exhibition, which opened in [[Sydney]] in September 2006, was criticised by [[Christopher Pyne]], then the federal government's parliamentary secretary for health with special responsibilities for mental health. Pyne told ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;"It's incredibly irresponsible....What if a patient, after seeing this exhibition, decided to stop seeing a psychiatrist? The outcome could be tragic... It's ill-informed and it's dangerous to undermine a highly respected and important part of the medical profession... Patients who see a psychiatrist shouldn't have their faith in psychiatry shaken by crackpot claims."&lt;ref name="MP: No science in Scientology"&gt;{{cite news |title=MP: No science in Scientology |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]] |location=NSW |date=14 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In response, Shelly Wilkins, executive director of the exhibition "said the campaign was not against psychiatrists, but their treatments".&lt;ref name="MP: No science in Scientology"/&gt;

Scientology, through its group [[Narconon]], has run an anti-drug campaign in dozens of schools in Melbourne, giving presentations and handing out brochures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Houlihan, Liam |newspaper=Herald Sun |title=Scientology Lessons |page=15 |date=16 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientology members have also attended events like the [[Big Day Out]] to give out anti-drug information.

One school in Australia, the [[Athena School]] in [[Newtown, New South Wales|Newtown]], Sydney, uses Scientology study technology. The Athena School has 90 pupils ranging from pre-school to year 10. It has eight teachers who have completed six months' training in L. Ron Hubbard teaching techniques but do not hold formal qualifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/06/23/1056220542333.html |author=Burke, Kelly. |title=Scientology class suits shy Hindu |work=Sydney Morning Herald |date=4 July 2003 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023030543/http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/06/23/1056220542333.html |archivedate=23 October 2012 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some children at the school are involved in Scientology community out reach programs operating under different names, including Drug Free Ambassadors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.athena.nsw.edu.au/ethics-and-morals/ |title=Ethics and Morals, Community Work |publisher=The Athens School |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140204015221/http://www.athena.nsw.edu.au/ethics-and-morals/ |archivedate=4 February 2014 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Banning of ''Tom Cruise: An Unauthorized Biography'' by Australian book retailers ==
A book released detailing Tom Cruise's activities within Scientology was banned by the major Australian booksellers in Australia, including [[Dymocks]] and [[Angus and Robertson]], after threats of legal action by the Church of Scientology. The book, ''[[Tom Cruise: An Unauthorized Biography]]'' by British writer [[Andrew Morton (writer)|Andrew Morton]], had been pulled from sale in the UK, and made a number of claims against Cruise and claims about Scientology trying to influence [[Nicole Kidman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2008/01/12/1199988647992.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title=Scientology holds sway in banning Cruise book | date=13 January 2008 | first=Angela | last=Cuming |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104100829/http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2008/01/12/1199988647992.html |archivedate=4 November 2012 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Bryan |last=Seymour |url=http://au.todaytonight.yahoo.com/article/129542 | work=Yahoo!7 | title=Book battle: Scientology and Tom Cruise| date=15 January 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212022950/http://au.todaytonight.yahoo.com/article/129542 |archivedate=12 February 2008 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian arm of publisher [[Pan Macmillan]] had planned to print a local Australian edition, but decided not to, after legal advice that the Church would act against them.&lt;ref name="smh_pan_macmillan"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/books/publisher-dumps-tom-cruise-book/2008/01/15/1200159419934.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1 |author=Tadros, Edmund |title=Publisher dumps Tom Cruise book|work=Sydney Morning Herald |date=15 January 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080124002939/http://www.smh.com.au/news/books/publisher-dumps-tom-cruise-book/2008/01/15/1200159419934.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1 |archivedate=24 January 2008 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in the book not being stocked by the Borders chain in Australia.&lt;ref name="smh_pan_macmillan"/&gt; Though certain bookstores in Australia refused to sell the book due to legal concerns, it was the number one bestseller in Australia for publisher [[AbeBooks]] in 2008,&lt;ref name="abebooks"&gt;{{cite news   | last =[[AbeBooks]]  | title =2008: A Year of Books in Review   | work =Bookseller Digest UK  | publisher =booksellerdigest.abebooks.co.uk  | date =12 January 2009  | url =http://booksellerdigest.abebooks.co.uk/2009/01/2008-a-year-of-books-in-review-.html  | accessdate = 27 March 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423133938/http://booksellerdigest.abebooks.co.uk/2009/01/2008-a-year-of-books-in-review-.html |archivedate=23 April 2009 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the number one most-borrowed non-fiction book at libraries in [[Brisbane]] in September 2008.&lt;ref name="brisbane"&gt;{{cite news | last =The Courier-Mail staff  | title =Top 10 books  | work =[[The Courier-Mail]]  | page =M25  | date =6 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Tom Cruise: An Unauthorized Biography'' was published in January 2008, and reprinted with an update in February 2009. In a ''[[New York Times]]'' review, Janet Maslin wrote "... Mr. Morton has found a number of former Scientologists who are willing to speak freely, and in some cases vengefully, about the group's purported inner workings. Mr. Morton's eagerness to include their voices leads him to push the limits of responsible reporting." Maslin added that Morton "provides a credible portrait extrapolated from the actor's on-the-record remarks and highly visible public behavior."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Maslin | first =Janet  | title =Tom Cruise and His Bully Pulpit | work =[[The New York Times]]  | pages =  | date =10 January 2008 | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/10/books/10masl.html  | accessdate =18 January 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120705014648/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/10/books/10masl.html |archivedate=5 July 2012 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Writing in ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', [[Mark Harris (journalist)|Mark Harris]] gave the book a grade of "C-", and said "Cruise emerges from Morton's takedown moderately scratched but as uncracked as ever."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | last =Harris  | first =Mark  | coauthors =  | title =Review: New Cruise biography comes up empty  | work =[[Entertainment Weekly]] | pages =  | language =  | publisher =[[CNN|CNN.com]] | date =9 January 2008  | url =http://www.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/books/01/09/review.cruise/index.html  | accessdate = 18 January 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080123132502/http://www.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/books/01/09/review.cruise/index.html |archivedate=23 January 2008 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another review in the ''New York Times'' by Ada Calhooun said:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/17/books/review/Calhoun-t.html |title=Scientology's Star |date=17 February 2008 |work =[[The New York Times]] |author=Calhoun, Ada  |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130803163854/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/17/books/review/Calhoun-t.html |archivedate=3 August 2013 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''However shady Scientology may be, Morton's language in "Tom Cruise: An Unauthorized Biography" is extreme. He and his sources compare the church and its leadership to fascists, the Roman Empire, storm troopers, Machiavelli, Orwell's "Animal Farm," Napoleon, Stalinists and North Korea. He also repeatedly invokes Nazism, and quotes without censure the German Protestant Church's comparison of Cruise to Joseph Goebbels.''

Teresa Budasi of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' described the book as "fascinating", although Budasi also brought up a "question as to what's true and what isn’t."&lt;ref name="budasi"&gt;{{cite news|last=Budasi |first=Teresa |coauthors= |title=Review: Cruise bio describes his best role: Scientologist – Focus on 'cult' doesn't make movie star more interesting |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |pages= |language= |publisher= |date=17 January 2008 |url=http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/books/746071,tomrev011708.article |accessdate=18 January 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814032746/http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/books/746071%2Ctomrev011708.article |archivedate=14 August 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Budasi summed up her impression of the work, writing "Morton's book is as much an indictment on Cruise's chosen faith as it is the life story of one of the world's biggest movie stars. And by the end you realize that 'Scientologist' is what will end up being the role of his lifetime."&lt;ref name="budasi" /&gt;  In a review in ''[[The Buffalo News]]'', Jeff Simon wrote of the author: "To give Morton the credit he's clearly due: he is one of the best around at constructing a 250-page gossip column."&lt;ref name="jeffsimon"&gt;{{cite news   | last =Simon  | first =Jeff  | coauthors =  | title =A dangerous man, or a falling star?  | work =[[The Buffalo News]]  | pages =  | language =  | publisher =  | date =19 January 2008  | url =http://www.buffalonews.com/185/story/255378.html  | accessdate = 2008-01-19 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080122111327/http://www.buffalonews.com/185/story/255378.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 22 January 2008 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon its publication, Cruise's lawyer and the [[Church of Scientology]]  released statements which question the truthfulness of assertions made by Morton in the book.  In a 15-page statement released to the press, the Church of Scientology called the book "a bigoted, defamatory assault replete with lies."&lt;ref name="cnnjan162008"&gt;{{cite news   | last = [[Associated Press]]  | first =  | coauthors =  | title = Author of Cruise bio defends book  | work = [[CNN]]  | pages =  | language =  | publisher = [[Time Warner]] | date =16 January 2008  | url =http://www.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/books/01/16/people.tomcruise.ap/  | accessdate =18 January 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080119141931/http://www.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/books/01/16/people.tomcruise.ap/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book was not published in the UK, Australia, or New Zealand due to strict libel laws in those countries.&lt;ref name="titlemsnbc.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21134540/vp/22664012#22664012 |title=msnbc.com Video Player |accessdate=18 January 2008 |date=15 January 2007|format=video |work=[[MSNBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Banning and legal status==
{{See also|Scientology status by country}}
Government criticism of the Church of Scientology was begun by a [[Victoria, Australia|Victorian]] [[civil service|public servant]], Dr [[Eric Cunningham Dax]],&lt;ref name="Garrison, O.V. 1974 p.145"&gt;{{cite book |author=Garrison, Omar V. |date=1974 |title=The Hidden Story of Scientology |publisher=Citadel Press |location=Secaucus NJ |ISBN=0-8065-0440-4 |page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; the founding Chairman of the Mental Hygiene Authority of [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]] (later known as the Mental Health Authority). Giving testimony at the [[Anderson Report]] inquiry in 1964 he stated that 'Since 1961 he had been increasingly concerned by information reaching the Mental Health Authority about people paying large sums of money for "Scientology" courses'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article104295203 |title='Scientology' Perverted Inquiry Told |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |date=28 May 1964 |accessdate=13 August 2013 |page=27 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of these efforts, in 1962, Dax wrote to the Minister of Health in each Australian state, warning of what he considered to be the dangers of this new religion.&lt;ref name="Garrison, O.V. 1974 p.145"/&gt;

In November 1963 [[John Galbally]], member of the [[Victorian Legislative Council]] 'accused the scientology movement of using blackmail and intimidation' which he said 'could lead to suicides'.&lt;ref name="INQUIRY ON GROUP PROMISED"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article104289141 |title=Inquiry on Group Promised |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |date=26 November 1963 |accessdate=13 August 2013 |page=8 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galbally proposed 'a Private Member's Bill to deal with scientology' and the following week the government announced a proposed inquiry.&lt;ref name="INQUIRY ON GROUP PROMISED"/&gt;

===1965 Victorian Board of Inquiry into Scientology===
{{See also|Anderson Report}}
Based on the findings of the 1965 [[Anderson Report|Anderson Inquiry]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Library/Shelf/anderson/index.html |title=Report of the Board of Enquiry into Scientology |author=Anderson, Kevin Victor, Q.C.|date=1965 |publisher=State of Victoria, Australia |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209142835/http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Library/Shelf/anderson/index.html |archivedate=9 February 2014 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; to which Dax contributed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Victoria. Board of Inquiry into Scientology |date=1963–64 |title=Transcript, Board of Inquiry into Scientology |pages=2976, 3207}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Church of Scientology was restricted from forming under that name in Australia. The Attorney General in [[New South Wales]] was one of the first to act and, a week after the report was published, instructed the state's Registrar of Companies 'not to register companies or firms with the word "scientology" in their names'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article105867585 |title=Direction on Scientology |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |date=16 October 1965 |accessdate=13 August 2013 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ban in Victoria lasted from 1965 until 1973, in [[South Australia]] from 1968 to 1973 and in [[Western Australia]] from 1968 until 1972. As a response to the banning of Scientology in WA and SA, Scientology changed its name to the [[Church of the New Faith]], a body incorporated in [[Adelaide]] in 1969, and continued to operate in those two states. However, it closed its Spring St office in Melbourne, Victoria.

The magistrates in the 1983 Victorian Court actions (see below) referenced the Anderson Inquiry, particularly that it was "Uncompromising in its denunciation of Scientology as a profoundly evil movement from which gullible – and the not so gullible – members of the community required protection", that it had "gained publicity in countries and states where the organization was entrenched"; that the leaders of the Scientology movement succumbed to the temptation to avoid "destruction" of the movement by simulating, so as to become accepted as, a religion; that "the ecclesiastical appearance now assumed by the organization is no more than colourable in order to serve an ulterior purpose"; and, ultimately, that Scientology
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"... is, in relation to its religious pretensions, no more than a sham. The bogus claims to belief in the [[efficacy of prayer]] and to being adherent to a creed divinely inspired and also the calculated adoption of the paraphernalia, and participation in ceremonies, of conventional religion are no more than a mockery of religion. Thus scientology as now practiced is in reality the antithesis of a religion. The very adriotness – and alacrity – with which the tenets or structure were from time so cynically adapted to meet a deficiency thought to operate in detraction of the claim to classification as a religion serve to rob the movement of that sincerity and integrity that must be cardinal features of any religious faith".&lt;ref&gt;Victorian Supreme Court Judgement (1983) 1 VR, at pp 108-109. (at p170)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Anderson's tone was strident, but offered in his own defence:
&lt;blockquote&gt;If there should be detected in this Report a note of unrelieved denunciation of scientology, it is because the evidence has shown its theories to be fantastic and impossible, its principles perverted and ill-founded, and its techniques debased and harmful. [...] While making an appeal to the public as a worthy system whereby ability, intelligence and personality may be improved, it employs techniques which further its real purpose of securing domination over and mental enslavement of its adherents. It involves the administration by persons without any training in medicine or psychology of quasi-psychological treatment, which is harmful medically, morally and socially.&lt;ref&gt;''Report...'' p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Victoria this inquiry led to a ban and was legislated in the ''Psychological Practices Act, 1965'', which prohibited using an [[E-meter]] or teaching Scientology for fee or reward. In the understanding that Scientology was a form of [[psychology]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}, this law required anyone practising psychology to register with the newly established Victorian Psychological Council. However, it exempted any religious denomination recognised by the Australian government under the federal Marriage Act since it used a definition of psychology broad enough to include the [[counseling|counselling]] traditionally done by [[priest]]s and [[minister (Christianity)|minister]]s of religion. Although similar laws were later passed in [[Western Australia]] in 1968 (the ''Scientology Act'') and [[South Australia]] (the ''Scientology (Prohibition) Act, 1968'' replaced by the ''Psychological Practices Act, 1973''), the Church remained active in these two States.

In January 1973, the newly elected federal [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government recognised the Church of Scientology as a religious denomination under the Marriage Act, making it effectively exempt from the provisions of the Victorian ''Psychological Practices Act''. Western Australia had already repealed its ''Scientology Act'' in the previous year.

===1983 Victorian Supreme Court===
In 1983, the matter went to the Courts in the State of Victoria and subsequently to the [[High Court of Australia]]. Scientologists argued a $70 payroll tax should not be paid due to its status as a religious organisation. The Commissioner of Pay-Roll Tax in Victoria had ruled that Scientology was not a religion. This decision was upheld in the Supreme Court of Victoria (Judge: Crockett,J) and then on appeal in the Full Court. The judgement concluding Scientology was not a religion relied on the premise that Scientology was a philosophy rather than a religion and that the trappings of religion had only been acquired after its establishment in order to give the organisation the semblance of a religion. Some support of this position was found in Scientologist writings: Scientology's predecessor in Australia was the Hubbard Association of Scientologist International ("H.A.S.I."), This association had published, at some time not earlier than 1961, a magazine which unequivocally asserted "H.A.S.I. is '''non-religious''' -it does not demand any belief or faith nor is it in conflict with faith. People of all faiths use Scientology."

The full bench of the Victorian Supreme Court affirmed that the &lt;blockquote&gt;
"Introduction of a service, ceremonies and other external indicia of a religion is no more than a cynical desire to present Scientology as what it is not for such mundane purposes as acquiring the protection of constitutional guarantees of freedom of religion or obtaining exemption from the burden of taxing laws... The creed and services described in a 1959 booklet called ''Ceremonies of The Founding Church of Scientology'' which had been published in America played absolutely no part in the teaching or practice of Scientology until the late nineteen sixties; These so-called ceremonies were devised and published as a device to enable, with such attendant advantages as would thereby accrue, Scientology to be paraded as a church in the United States and should properly be described as a masquerade and a charade."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|VicRp|10|1983|litigants=Church of the New Faith v Commissioner of Pay-roll Tax (Vic) |parallelcite=[1983] 1 [[Victorian Reports|VR]] 97 |date=5 May 19823 |courtname=[[Supreme Court of Victoria|Supreme Court]] (Vic)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus the Victorian court found that a considerable transformation had ostensibly occurred. The court found that "the ecclesiastical appearance now assumed by the organization is no more than colourable in order to serve an ulterior purpose", namely, the purpose of acquiring the legal status of a religion so that the organization might have the fiscal and other benefits of that status in Australia and elsewhere and the purpose of avoiding the legal disabilities to which the organization was subject by reason of the Psychological Practices Act 1965 (Vict.). He expressed his clear conviction that the purported transformation of Scientology to a religion was
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"No more than a sham, the proclaimed belief in the efficacy of prayer is bogus, and the adoption of the paraphernalia and ceremonies of conventional religion is a mockery. The very adroitness – and alacrity – with which the tenets or structure were from time (to time) so cynically adapted to meet a deficiency thought to operate in detraction of the claim to classification as a religion serve to rob the movement of that sincerity and integrity that must be cardinal features of any religious faith."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Though the court found that at least some parts of Mr. Hubbard's writing contained merely pretended doctrines and practices of Scientology, he also found that members of the Scientology movement are "expected to and, apostates excepted,  accord blind reverence to the written works of Mr. Hubbard. Although the sincerity and integrity of the ordinary members of the Scientology movement are not in doubt, Scientology is no less a sham because there are others prepared to accept and act upon such aims and beliefs as though they were credible when they can not see them for what they are. Gullibility cannot convert something from what it is to something which it is not".&lt;ref&gt;Victorian Supreme Court Judgement (1983) 1 VR, at p 111 (at p141)&lt;/ref&gt;

===1983 High Court Appeal===
All these judgements were subsequently overturned by the Scientologist's appeal to the [[High Court of Australia]] in 1983, in ''[[Church of the New Faith]] v. Commissioner Of Pay-roll Tax''. The court ruled that the government of Victoria could not deny the Church the right to operate in Victoria under the legal status of "religion" for purposes of payroll taxes. All three judges in the case found that the Church of the New Faith (Church of Scientology) was a religion. Justices Mason and Brennan said:

{{quote|Charlatanism is a necessary price of religious freedom, and if a self-proclaimed teacher persuades others to believe in a religion which he propounds, lack of sincerity or integrity on his part is not incompatible with the religious character of the beliefs, practices and observances accepted by his followers.}}

but that:

{{quote|The question to which the evidence was directed was not whether the beliefs, practices and observances of the persons in ultimate command of the organization constituted a religion but whether those of the general group of adherents constituted a religion. The question which the parties resolved to litigate must be taken to be whether the beliefs, practices and observances which the general group of adherents accept is a religion.}}

Justice Murphy said:
{{quote|Conclusion. The applicant has easily discharged the onus of showing that it is religious. The conclusion that it is a religious institution entitled to the tax exemption is irresistible.}}

and

{{quote|The conclusion to which we have ultimately come is that Scientology is, for relevant purposes, a religion. With due respect to Crockett J. and the members of the Full Supreme Court who reached a contrary conclusion, it seems to us that there are elements and characteristics of Scientology in Australia, as disclosed by the evidence, which cannot be denied.&lt;ref name=HCOA&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|40|1983|litigants=Church of the New Faith v Commissioner of Pay-roll Tax (Victoria) |parallelcite=(1983) 154 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 120 |date=27 October 1983 |courtname=[[High Court of Australia|High Court]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Wilson and Deane said:

{{quote|Regardless of whether the members of the applicant are gullible or misled or whether the practices of Scientology are harmful or objectionable, the evidence, in our view, establishes that Scientology must, for relevant purposes, be accepted as "a religion" in Victoria. That does not, of course, mean either that the practices of the applicant or its rules are beyond the control of the law of the State or that the applicant or its members are beyond its taxing powers.}}

The High Court of Australia restored Scientology's tax exempt status in 1983.&lt;ref name="HCOA"/&gt; The High Court's decision, dismissing the earlier judgements, now serves as the current precedent for defining religious groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cdi.gov.au/report/cdi_chap20.htm |title=Australian Charities Definition Inquiry, Chapter 20: The Advancement of Religion |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140124215052/http://cdi.gov.au/report/cdi_chap20.htm |archivedate=24 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the court’s judgment, according to scholar James Richardson: “the Court went on to state that a religion did not have to be theistic, and that a religion involved both belief and behavior, thus avoiding crude dichotomy promulgated by the famous polygamy case in America in 1897. The case is still the leading case in Australia defining religion, and is cited in other courts and countries as well.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Scientology: Sect, Science, or Scam? |journal=Numen |year=2015 |last=Lewis |first=James R. |volume=62 |issue=2 |pages=226-242 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the incident, Australian Church of Scientology vice-president Cyrus Brooks in Sydney continued to criticise Psychiatry and Psychiatric drugs, while the Australian Medical Association President Dr Rosanna Capolingua, speaking on ABC Radio, said if "the girl had had access to appropriate medical treatment it could have changed the course of her life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2007/07/10/1183833476294.html | author=Welsh, Dylan |work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Scientologists 'flat earthers' | date=10 July 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713062941/http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2007/07/10/1183833476294.html |archivedate=13 July 2007 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Queen Street massacre ===
{{Main|Queen Street massacre}}
In the [[Queen Street massacre]] case, the gunman, Frank Vitkovic, had been tested by the Church of Scientology two months before he shot a number of people in the Queen Street Massacre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Pitt, Helen |title=Court sees Video of Queen st Shootings |work=Sydney Morning Herald |date=16 September 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=No rest for the Wicked |work=The Age|date=30 November 1997 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Vitkovic took a personality test carried out by a Church of Scientology volunteer. The results of the test, the Scientology volunteer believed, made her suspect that he might have hit rock bottom. The voluntary worker, Ms Eleanor Simpson, who had no formal training in psychology, believed Vitkovic was extremely depressed. She could recall only one other personality test having a worse result. She did not refer Vitkovic to a psychiatrist but suggested he enrol in the Ups and Downs in Life course run by the Church."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Pitt, Helen |title=Inside the mind of a mass murderer |work=Sydney Morning Herald &lt;!--Spectrum--&gt;|date=8 October 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forensic psychiatrist Dr Alan Bartholomew presented evidence at the Inquest concerning Scientology's testing of gunman [[Frank Vitkovic]]. Bartholomew indicated that the Scientologist's testing of the gunman [[Frank Vitkovic]], though revealing that Vitkovic was suffering a serious mental condition, did not result in his being treated effectively. Bartholomew also stated that the test itself may have contributed to Vitkovic's mental state before he shot eight people in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Hall, J. |title=Queen St.Church to blame |work=Herald |date=4 October 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; While repeating some of these comments the Coroner said in his findings "there is no evidence that Vitkovic was influenced by his being provided with the written results of a Scientology Personality Test".&lt;ref&gt;Hallenstein, 5346/87 20 October 1988&lt;/ref&gt; The Coroner also noted the day before coming into the Church of Scientology Vitkovic was prescribed "appropriate medication" for stress related headaches and hypertension. An alternative interpretation of events is provided by the Director of the Australian Institute of Criminology Adam Graycar:

{{blockquote|In his diary, Vitkovic also confided this advice "Look for people with a history of rejection, loneliness and ill treatment who also have a fascination with guns and you won’t go wrong". The inquest exposed the tortured mind of a young man who saw himself as a failure, inadequate and lonely, tormented by violent fantasies and finally suffused with hatred. He sought refuge in erotic and violent books and videos and cultivated a morbid interest in firearms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aic.gov.au/media_library/conferences/other/graycar_adam/2003-04-sig.pdf |title=Violence in the Workplace: Personal and Political Issues presented at the 2003 Security in Government Conference|author=Adam Graycar |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140212091917/http://www.aic.gov.au/media_library/conferences/other/graycar_adam/2003-04-sig.pdf |archivedate=12 February 2014 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Scientology targets school children in NSW schools ===
After Scientology related material was sent to NSW schools, the NSW Government warned principals about a Church of Scientology attempt to infiltrate primary schools with propaganda videos and booklets aimed at Year 6 students. Education Minister Verity Firth has warned all NSW primary schools after a DVD was distributed about a Scientology organisation called "[[Youth for Human Rights]]". The DVD was sent to various schools for the students, and didn't reveal it was connected to the Church of Scientology.
"It's not appropriate for the Church of Scientology to distribute materials", Ms Firth said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/sunday-telegraph/scientology-targets-school-kids/story-e6frewt0-1225801613371 |title=Scientology targets young kids |author=Squires, Rosie |date=22 November 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120531080634/http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/scientology-targets-school-kids/story-e6frewt0-1225801613371 |archivedate=31 May 2012 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scientology is accused of holding a Taiwanese woman hostage ===

In February 2013, the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] television program, ''[[Lateline]]'', accused the Church Of Scientology of holding a Taiwanese woman, Alice Wu, in isolation in a Sydney property, after she suffered an extreme mental breakdown. It was also suggested the Church had bullied her into signing legal statements she did not necessarily agree to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2013/s3698162.htm | title = Church of Scientology denies holding woman in isolation | last = Cannane| first= Steve| date = 25 February 2013 | publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation | accessdate = 6 April 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130404085516/http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2013/s3698162.htm |archivedate=4 April 2013 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Litigation ==

The Church of Scientology has been involved in a number of lawsuits and threatened legal action during its five decade history in Australia.

* A suit was brought against [[Kevin Victor Anderson|Anderson]] and his assistant Gordon Just who produced the [[Anderson Report]], in 1971. The citations in the Victorian Reports are: Hubbard Association of Scientologists -v- Anderson (1971) VR 788; Hubbard Association of Scientologists v. Anderson (1972) VR 340 [appeal of 1971 VR 740]; Hubbard Association of Scientologists International v Anderson and Just (No 2) (1972) VR 577. The Victorian Parliament passed special legislation to give the two immunity from these writs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Anderson, Kevin |date=1986 |title=Fossil In The Sandstone: The Recollecting Judge |publisher=Spectrum Publications |location=Melbourne. |isbn=0-86786-095-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Church of Scientology requested a tax exemption from wages originating from a religious institution based on the Victoria Pay-roll Tax Act 1971. The High Court asked the question on whether Scientology was to be accepted as a religion, and decided that they were. Scientology met the two criteria that they stipulated for the determination of whether an organization is religious; first “belief in a supernatural Being, Thing or Principle” and second, “the acceptance of canons of conduct in order to give effect to that belief.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last=Carobene |first=Germana |title=Acta Comparanda |language=English, French |url=http://www.observatoire-religion.com/2016/12/scientology-in-a-scholarly-perspective/ |booktitle=The research of a juridical identity for Scientology, according to recent European case law |conference=International Conference – Scientology in a scholarly perspective 24-25th January 2014 |publisher=University of Antwerp, Faculty for Comparative Study of Religions and Humanism |place=Antwerp, Belgium |year=2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216050903/http://www.observatoire-religion.com/2016/12/scientology-in-a-scholarly-perspective/ |archivedate=16 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Scientology also litigated against the [[Australian Security Intelligence Organisation]], which is Australia's domestic intelligence service.&lt;ref name="Woodward HCA"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|38|1982|litigants=Church of Scientology v Woodward |parallelcite=(1982) 154 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 25 |date=19 November 1982 |courtname=[[High Court of Australia|High Court]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Billboard promotion==
Scientology used a notable promotion in Sydney for many years, an "electronic talking billboard" a 33 metre high Volcano billboard situated in the main cinema district on George Street.
The Volcano billboard was "33 metres wide, 10 metres high and projects three-and-a-half-metres from the Metro's facade. It is internally illuminated by 150 special display lamps synchronised to create a stylised simulation of lava flowing down the sides of the volcano. Each eruption heralds the screening of ads on the TV screen. Non-toxic smoke will spew from the crater at regular intervals." The billboard was used to promote Dianetics books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Andrew |last=Hornery |work=Sydney Morning Herald |date= 4 May 1996 |page=13 |title=Scientologists' message goes up in hi-tech smoke}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Smyth, Terry |title=Nightmare on George st |work=Sun Herald |date=26 May 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.suburbia.net/~fun/scn/orgs/syd/volcano.jpg |title=Photograph of Vulcano Billboard |publisher=suburbia.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Corbett, Bryce |title=City Hall Stops for Billboard |work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]|date=23 May 1996 |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sultanganj Buddha''' is a [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]]-[[Pala Empire|Pala]] transitional period sculpture, the largest substantially complete copper Buddha figure known from the time. The statue is dated by archaeologists to between 500 and 700 AD. It is 2.3 m high and 1 m wide and weighs over 500&amp;nbsp;kg. It was found in the [[North India]]n town of [[Sultanganj]], [[Bhagalpur district]], [[Bihar]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/birmingham/content/articles/2006/05/10/sultanganj_buddha_feature.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; in 1861 during the construction  of the [[East Indian Railway]].&lt;ref name="Wingfield"&gt;Wingfield, Christopher (2010) Touching the Buddha: Encounters with a charismatic object. In Museum Materialities: Objects, Engagements, Interpretations, ed. Sandra H. Dudley, Routledge: London &amp; New York, pp.53-70. http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415492188/&lt;/ref&gt; It is now held by [[Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery]], [[Birmingham]], [[England]].

==Description==
The Sultanganj Buddha was cast in pure, unrefined copper by the ''cire perdue'', or [[list-wax casting|lost wax]], technique. It stands with his right hand raised in ''[[abhayamudra]]'' (a gesture of reassurance or protection), and his left hand is held downwards with palm outwards, said to indicate granting a favour. The end of the monastic robe is held between the thumb and forefinger of this hand in the manner that is still practised by [[Theravada|Theravadin]] monks.

==Discovery and later history==
[[File:Sultanganj Buddha found.jpg|thumb|EB Harris with the Sultanganj Buddha. 1861/1862]]
[[File:Sultanganj Buddha.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Stone statue of Buddha from Sultanganj in the [[British Museum]] Lotus petals inscribed with "[[Ye Dharma Hetu]]" mantra]]
E. B. Harris, the railway engineer who discovered the Buddha during excavations that he carried out on ancient remains near the Sultanganj station that he was constructing, published a detailed account of his work, complete with a site plan and photographs. He describes finding the right foot of the Buddha ten feet under the surface, beneath a floor he considered to have been used to conceal the statue after it had been toppled from its former place.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, E. B. (1864) Description of Buddhist Remains Discovered at Sooltangunge, London: privately published.&lt;/ref&gt; Harris sent the statue to Birmingham, the cost of its transport to England being paid by Samuel Thornton, a Birmingham manufacturer of ironmongery. Thornton, himself a former mayor of Birmingham, offered it to the [[Birmingham City Council|Borough Council]] for their proposed Art Museum in 1864. In Birmingham, a town that boasted a thousand trades, the Art Museum was intended to be an exemplar and inspiration for local metalworkers and other artisans.

Over the years, it has been shown in a number of prominent locations throughout [[Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery]] (BMAG) and remains an indispensable display item. It was the foundation donation to the collections and is BMAG's most treasured possession.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bmagic.org.uk/objects/1885A1116&lt;/ref&gt; Harris's report shows him with the Buddha and a number of smaller finds. They included two much smaller standing Buddhas in stone: one is now in the [[British Museum]] and the other in the [[Asian Art Museum of San Francisco]]. A stone Buddha head, also from Sultanganj, is now in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], London.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=5098&amp;partId=1&amp;place=39987&amp;plaA=39987-2-11&amp;page=1 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://searchcollection.asianart.org/view/objects/asitem/id/19594 Asian Art Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O64237/head-of-the-buddha-sculpture-unknown/ Victoria and Albert Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current location==
From 1998 to 2015, the Buddha was the centrepiece of a gallery at Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery dedicated to displaying a number of Buddhas and related artefacts, and Birmingham Museum held an annual 'Buddha Day', when West Midlands-based Buddhist groups from a range of traditions would bless the statue.

During 2015, Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery worked with representatives of a number of faith groups from the city on the creation of a new 'Faith Gallery', and the Sultanganj Buddha was moved from its previous location. It is now displayed in a new gallery that tells the story of the range of faiths that are practiced in Birmingham.

'''Suunism''' ({{Korean|hangul=수운교|hanja=水雲敎|rr=Suungyo}}) is one of the [[Korea]]n [[ethnic religion]]s derived from [[Sinism]].&lt;ref&gt;Lee Chi-ran, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; It is a splinter from [[Cheondoism]] that in turn originated as an organised formation of the [[Donghak]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Chi-ran, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; "''Suwun''" was another name used by [[Choe Je-u]].&lt;ref&gt;Lee Chi-ran, pp. 16-20&lt;/ref&gt; Suwunists claim to have transmitted a purer version of his teaching.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Chi-ran, pp. 16-20&lt;/ref&gt;

The religion's headquarters are located in [[Daejeon]],&lt;ref&gt;Lee Chi-ran, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; where Suwun himself moved in 1929 after having preached in [[Seoul]] since 1923.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Chi-ran, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; The religion focuses on the worship of ''Okhwangsangje [[Haneullim|Hanulim]]'' (the "Great [[Jade Emperor]] of Heaven"),&lt;ref&gt;Lee Chi-ran, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; in order to make the earth a paradise through the reconnection to the One.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Chi-ran, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; An important symbol of the faith is ''Gungeul'' ("Archer Bird").&lt;ref&gt;Lee Chi-ran, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; The doctrine includes belief in the [[Maitreya]].&lt;ref&gt;Lee Chi-ran, pp. 20-21&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tefibi''' (or '''Itj-ibj''' – ''It(.i)ib(.i)''&lt;ref name=oxford&gt;Donald B. Spanel, in [[Donald B. Redford]] (ed), ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt'' vol. 1, Oxford University Press, 2001, pp.&amp;nbsp;154-6.&lt;/ref&gt; – in a more modern reading) was an [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[nomarch]] of the 13th ''[[Nome (Egypt)|nomos]]'' of [[Upper Egypt]] (''"the Upper [[Ficus sycomorus|Sycamore]]"'') during the [[Tenth Dynasty of Egypt|10th Dynasty]] (c. 21st century BCE, during the [[First Intermediate Period]]). In addition, he also was ''hereditary prince, count, wearer of the royal seal, sole companion'' and ''high priest of [[Wepwawet]]''. The main source about his life came from his biography, inscribed on the "tomb III" in [[Asyut]].&lt;ref&gt;[[James Henry Breasted]], ''Ancient Records of Egypt'', vol 1, 1907, The University of Chicago Press, §&amp;nbsp;391 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is generally assumed that Tefibi was the second of a trio of related nomarchs datable to the [[Heracleopolis Magna|Herakleopolite]] period; he was likely preceded by his father Khety and followed by his son, also named [[Khety II (nomarch)|Khety]].&lt;ref name=oxford/&gt;

==Biography==
He was member of a long line of nomarchs in Asyut with strong bonds of loyalty and friendship towards the [[Heracleopolis Magna|Herakleopolite]] dynasty, and seems that he continued the policy of good governance pursued by his father [[Khety I (nomarch)|Khety I]]: in fact, Tefibi praised the safety and the respect of the laws in his ''nomos''.&lt;ref&gt;[[William C. Hayes]], in ''[[The Cambridge Ancient History]]'', vol 1, part 2, 1971 (2008), Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-077915}}, p.&amp;nbsp;469.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When [[11th Dynasty of Egypt|the Thebans]] extended their influences on [[Thinis]] and [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]], the Herakleopolite [[pharaoh]] (who is generally believed to be [[Wahkare Khety]]) and Tefibi rallied their troops, and swiftly regained Thinis.  Their undisciplined soldiers sacked the sacred [[necropolis]], as reported by the king himself in the ''[[Teaching for King Merykare]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, op. cit., p.&amp;nbsp;466-467.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tefibi died during the reign of king [[Merykare]], who installed [[Khety II (nomarch)|Khety II]], son of the deceased, as nomarch in Asyut.

'''The Doctrine of Tenrikyo''' (天理教教典 ''Tenrikyo kyoten'') is the [[doctrine]] of the [[Tenrikyo]] religion, published and sanctioned by [[Tenrikyo Church Headquarters]]. ''The Doctrine of Tenrikyo'' is one of the supplemental texts (準原典 ''jun-genten'') of the Tenrikyo scriptures, along with ''[[The Life of Oyasama]]'' and ''[[Anecdotes of Oyasama]]''.

===Meiji doctrine===
[[File:Inoue Yorikuni.jpg|thumb|150px|[[w:ja:井上頼圀|Inoue Yorikuni]], one of the authors of the Meiji doctrine.]]
In May 1903, Tenrikyo Church Headquarters created a doctrine of the Tenrikyo teachings, referred to as the "[[Meiji period|Meiji]] doctrine" (明治教典) or the "former doctrine" (旧教典) to distinguish it from the doctrine published after [[World War II]].{{sfn|Oyasato Institute for the Study of Religion|1997|pp=882-3}} The doctrine's compilation was part of the church's effort to become an independent Shinto sect at the turn of the century, which would be achieved a few years later in 1908. Because the doctrine had to be authorized by the Shinto Main Bureau, an official government body, the Tenrikyo teachings presented therein conformed to [[State Shinto]] ideology, which promoted [[patriotism]] and reverence for the [[Emperor of Japan|emperor]].{{sfn|Nakajima|1986|p=6}} The Meiji Doctrine was divided into ten chapters – 'Revering God,' 'Respecting the Emperor,' 'Loving the Nation,' 'Morality,' 'Accumulating Virtues,' 'Cleansing of Impurities,' 'Founding of the Teachings,' 'Repayment to God,' 'The Kagura', and 'Peace of Mind.'{{sfn|Oyasato Institute for the Study of Religion|1997|pp=882-3}} [[Tenrikyo Church Headquarters]] compiled the doctrine with the collaboration of scholars Nakanishi Ushirō, [[w:ja:井上頼圀|Inoue Yorikuni]], and Henmi Nakasaburō, who were specialists in religion, ''[[kokugaku]]'', and [[Japanese literature|Japanese classics]] respectively.{{sfn|Nakajima|1986|p=6}}

In the first half of the twentieth century, the Meiji doctrine was used in the schools of Tenrikyo's education system, such as [[Tenri Seminary]]. In 1912, two texts related to this doctrine, a commentary and a reference text, were published.{{sfn|Nakajima|1986|pp=8–9}}

===Restoration===
After [[World War II]] and the assurance of religious freedom under the 1947 [[Constitution of Japan]], a new doctrine based solely on Nakayama Miki's teachings was compiled. This doctrine was originally published by [[Tenrikyo Church Headquarters]] as ''Tenrikyo Kyoten'' (天理教教典) on October 26, 1949, with the authorization of [[Nakayama Shozen]], the Second [[Shinbashira]]. Since then, the ''Tenrikyo Kyoten'' has undergone one revision in 1984.{{sfn|Tenrikyo Church Headquarters|1993|ps=, edition notice.}}

The first English edition of ''The Doctrine of Tenrikyo'' was published in 1954. The current edition is the tenth edition, published in 1993.{{sfn|Tenrikyo Church Headquarters|1993|ps=, edition notice.}}

==Content==
The current ''Doctrine of Tenrikyo'' is primarily based on Tenrikyo's three scriptures, the ''[[Ofudesaki]]'', ''[[Mikagura-uta]]'', and the ''[[Osashizu]]''. Other sources include an early biography of Nakayama Miki by her grandson Nakayama Shinnosuke, Shinnosuke's notes on Miki's teachings, and writings of those who heard Miki's teachings directly. Specifically regarding the [[Service (Tenrikyo)|Service]], the ''Doctrine of Tenrikyo'' refers to ''Hitokotohanashi Dai San Kan,'' and regarding [[Tenri-O-no-Mikoto]], the ''Doctrine of Tenrikyo'' refers to ''A Study on "God," "Tsukihi," and "Parent"'' (「神」「月日」及び「をや」について ''Kami Tsukihi oyobi Oya ni tsuite'').{{sfn|Nakayama|1994|p=1}}

The outline of the Doctrine of Tenrikyo is as follows:

*Part One
**Chapter One: [[Nakayama Miki|Oyasama]]
**Chapter Two: The Path of Single-hearted Salvation
**Chapter Three: [[Tenrikyo creation narrative|The Truth of Origin]]
**Chapter Four: [[God in Tenrikyo|Tenri-O-no-Mikoto]]
**Chapter Five: The Divine Model
*Part Two
**Chapter Six: Divine Guidance
**Chapter Seven: A Thing Lent, A Thing Borrowed

The '''Union of Cambodian Democrats''' was a political alliance in [[Cambodia]], which was formed by three political parties, one of them being the Khmer Nation Party of [[Sam Rainsy]], Prince [[Norodom Ranariddh]] was involved as well. These three political parties called their umbrella group the "Union of Cambodian Democrats".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0DE0DE153AF93BA1575AC0A961958260|title=Cambodian Leaders in Exile Seek International Monitoring of New Elections|author=Crossette, Barbara|publisher=The New York Times|date=September 28, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was created in exile in 1997 after a [[coup d'etat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://my.cambodia.org/profile/kem_sokha|title=Kem Sokha's Page|publisher=Cambodian Information Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leaders of three political parties which united their leadership and political parties together to create the Union of Cambodian Democrats were Sam Rainsy's [[Sam Rainsy Party]], [[Son Sann]]'s [[Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party]] (now led by [[Son Soubert]]) and also prince [[Norodom Ranariddh]]'s [[FUNCINPEC]] party. However, from the late 90's onwards a new political party,the [[Bou Hel]] and [[Ty Chhin]]'s [[Khmer Neutral Party]], became part of the alliance .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0DE0DE153AF93BA1575AC0A961958260 | work=The New York Times | title=Cambodian Leaders in Exile Seek International Monitoring of New Elections | first=Barbara | last=Crossette | date=September 28, 1997 | accessdate=May 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="971">The '''Universal Torah Registry''' is a project of the [[Jewish Community Relations Council|JCRC]] (Jewish Community Relations Council) of [[New York City]], originally established in 1982, designed to protect and secure [[Sefer Torah|Torah scrolls]] of [[Jews|Jewish communities]], from theft.  As these scrolls may be valued at between $5,000 to $20,000, and could fetch similar amounts on the [[black market]], [[synagogue]]s have been a target of thieves.

The UTR currently has approximately 1000 subscribing synagogues nationwide.  Some synagogues and Jewish communities are not aware of this program, and in some communities, religious leaders refuse to endorse the program.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3087">'''Yum Kaax''' (Mayan pronunciation: [jum kaːʃ], 'Lord of the forest') is a [[Yukatek Maya]] name for the god of the wild vegetation and guardian of its animals. 

In the past, this character has wrongly been described as an agricultural deity, or even as the Maya maize god (god E of the codices),&lt;ref&gt;Steele 1977: 1062&lt;/ref&gt; which has become a popular and still existing misconception.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson 1970: 289&lt;/ref&gt; In ethnographic reality, Yum Kaax is a god of wild plants and of animals that are important to hunters. As such, he grants protection of the fields against the incursions of the wild nature he himself represents. &lt;ref&gt;Thompson 1930: 107-108, 173&lt;/ref&gt; This type of deity is also found among indigenous peoples of North America. Invoked by hunters, he is the owner of all the game. He can appear to hunters in an instant and possesses songs that will warrant a hunter success, and allow his arrows to come back to him.

==Role in Mayan Culture==
Pre-Columbian contact, Yum Kaax was considered one of the most important deities in the Maya Pantheon and was used to help those who hunted for their food. Tradition farmers would invoke his name and present him with the first fruits of their fields, carved out from the forest&lt;ref&gt;cf. Thompson 1930: 107-108, 173&lt;/ref&gt;  so that wild animals and vegetation would not destroy their fields. Hunters far out in the wilderness would sometimes take off their shirt, spread it over four stakes in the ground and then crawl underneath to try and find deer. This is a ritual to Yum Kaax so that deer become easier to find. &lt;ref&gt;Muntsch 1943: 34&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mayan beliefs from Yum Kaax==
Mayan Sorcerers have learned many secrets from Yum Kaax, and these would be used to help one get better results while hunting. some of the advice given was: When you go hunting, you must first offer Yum Kaax 5 jars of [[Balché]] or nine of chocozacan. To find game, create a candle of [[Copal]] and follow the flicker of the flame. To select your own private hunting ground, kill a deer and cut off its head and then drag the head around the hunting ground and bury the head with its liver – the area that you have dragged the head over will become your own private hunting ground. &lt;ref&gt;Muntsch 1943: 34&lt;/ref&gt;
