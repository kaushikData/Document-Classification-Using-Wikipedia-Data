The '''''ABC Chinese–English Dictionary''''' or '''''ABC Dictionary''''' (1996), compiled under the chief editorship of [[John DeFrancis]], is the first [[Chinese dictionary]] to [[collation|collate]] entries in single-sort [[alphabetical order]] of [[pinyin]] romanization, and a landmark in the history of Chinese lexicography. It was also the first publication in the [[University of Hawai'i Press]]'s "ABC" (Alphabetically Based Computerized) series of Chinese dictionaries. They republished the ''ABC Chinese–English Dictionary'' in a pocket edition (1999) and desktop reference edition (2000), as well as the expanded ''ABC Chinese–English Comprehensive Dictionary'' (2003) and dual ''ABC Chinese–English/English-Chinese Dictionary'' (2010). Furthermore, the ''ABC Dictionary'' databases have been developed into computer [[application software|applications]] such as [[Wenlin Software for learning Chinese]] (1997).

==History==
[[John DeFrancis]] (1911–2009) was an influential American [[sinology|sinologist]], author of [[Chinese language]] textbooks, [[lexicography|lexicographer]] of [[Chinese dictionary|Chinese dictionaries]], and [[emeritus|Professor Emeritus]] of Chinese Studies at the [[University of Hawai'i at Mānoa|University of Hawai{{okina}}i at Mānoa]]. After he retired from teaching in 1976, DeFrancis was a prolific author of influential works such as ''[[The Chinese Language: Fact and Fantasy]]'' (1984) and ''Visible Speech: The Diverse Oneness of Writing Systems'' (1989).

[[Victor H. Mair]], a sinologist and professor of Chinese at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], first proposed the idea of a computerized pinyin Chinese–English dictionary in his 1986 lexicographical [[review article]] "The Need for an Alphabetically Arranged General Usage Dictionary of Mandarin Chinese." He defined "alphabetically arranged dictionary" to mean a dictionary in which all words (''cí'' 詞) are "interfiled strictly according to pronunciation. This may be referred to as a "single sort/tier/layer alphabetical" order or series." He emphatically does not mean a usual Chinese dictionary collated according to the initial single graphs (''zì'' 字) that are only the beginning syllables of whole words. "With the latter type of arrangement, more than one sort is required to locate a given term. The head character must first be found and then a separate sort is required for the next character, and so on." (1986: 2). Mair's article had two purposes, to call the attention of his colleagues to the critical need for an alphabetically arranged Chinese dictionary and to enlist their help in making it a reality, and to suggest that ''all'' new sinological reference tools should at least include alphabetically ordered indices. "Someone who already knows the pronunciation of a given expression but not its meaning should not be cruelly burdened by having to fuss with radicals, corners, strokes, and what not. Let him go directly to the object of his search instead of having to make endless, insufferable detours in an impenetrable forest of graphs." (1986: 20).

In DeFrancis' Acknowledgements, he says "This dictionary owes its genesis to the initiative of Victor H. Mair", who after unsuccessful attempts to obtain financial support for the compilation of an alphabetically based Chinese–English dictionary, in 1990 organized an international group of scholars who volunteered to contribute towards compiling it. However, "agonizingly slow progress" made it apparent that a fulltime editor was necessary, and in May 1992 John DeFrancis offered to undertake the project centered at the University of Hawai'i (1996: ix).

Along with Prof. DeFrancis overseeing the general planning and supervision of the project as well as its detailed operations, a volunteer team of some 50 contributors – including academics, Chinese language teachers, students, lexicographers, and computer consultants – were involved in the myriad tasks of processing dictionary entries, such as defining, inputting, checking, and proofreading. The University of Hawai'i Press published the ''ABC Chinese–English Dictionary'' in September 1996. UHP republished the original [[paperback]] ''ABC Chinese–English Dictionary'', which had a total 916 pages and was 23&amp;nbsp;cm. high, into the ''ABC Chinese–English Dictionary: Pocket Edition'' (1999, 16&amp;nbsp;cm.) and [[hardback]] ''ABC Chinese–English Dictionary: Desk Reference Edition'' (2000, 23&amp;nbsp;cm.).

In Shanghai, DeFrancis' dictionary was published under the title ''Han-Ying Cidian: ABC Chinese–English Dictionary'' (Hanyu Dacidian Chubanshe, 1997). For reasons of [[political correctness]], the Shanghai edition amended the entry for [[Lin Biao]] (Sawer 2001: 225). It altered the original American edition's "veteran Communist military leader and Mao Zedong's designated successor until mysterious death" to "veteran Communist military leader; ringleader of counterrevolutionary group (during Cultural Revolution)".

Victor H. Mair became general editor of the ABC Chinese Dictionary Series in 1996, and the University of Hawai'i Press has issued ten publications (as of October 2016), including two developments from the ''ABC Chinese–English Dictionary'' (1996) with 71,486 head entries. John DeFrancis and others edited the hardback ''ABC Chinese–English Comprehensive Dictionary'' (2003, 1464 pp., 25&amp;nbsp;cm.), which contains over 196,501 head entries, making it the most comprehensive one-volume dictionary of Chinese. DeFrancis (posthumously) and Zhang Yanyin, professor of Applied Linguistics and Educational Linguistics at the [[University of Canberra]], edited the bidirectional paperback ''ABC Chinese–English/English-Chinese Dictionary'' (2010, 1240 pp., 19&amp;nbsp;cm.). It contains 67,633 entries: 29,670 in the English-Chinese section, 37,963 in the Chinese–English section, which is an abridgment of the ''ABC Chinese–English Comprehensive Dictionary'' and includes improvements such as more usage example sentences.

Computers (namely, the ''C'' in ''ABC Dictionary'') were purposefully involved in almost every stage of dictionary compilation and publication in order to facilitate further advances in electronic lexicography and [[Software development process|software development]]. In 1997, the Wenlin Institute published ''[[Wenlin Software for Learning Chinese]]'' with about 14,000 head entries (version 1.0) and entered into a licensing agreement with the University of Hawai{{okina}}i to utilize the ''ABC Dictionary'' database in Wenlin software. The first edition ''ABC Chinese–English Dictionary'' (1996) was incorporated into Wenlin 2.0 with over 74,000 entries (1998); the second ''ABC Chinese–English Comprehensive Dictionary'' (2003) went into Wenlin 3.0 with over 196,000 entries (2002); and the third edition ''ABC English-Chinese/Chinese–English Dictionary'' (2010) was incorporated into Wenlin 4.0 (2011), which includes 300,000 Chinese–English entries, 73,000 Chinese character entries, and 62,000 English-Chinese entries.

Prior to the alphabetically arranged ''ABC Chinese–English Dictionary'', virtually every Chinese dictionary was based upon character head entries, arranged either by character shape or pronunciation, that subsume words and phrases written with that head character as the first syllable. While pronunciation determines the placement of words within the unconventional ''ABC Dictionary'', Chinese characters still determine the position of words within a standard dictionary. Comparing a Chinese character-based dictionary with the pinyin-based ''ABC Dictionary'' illustrates the difference. ''The Chinese–English Dictionary'' (Wu 1979: 431) locates the head character entry ''lín'' 林 "① forest; woods; grove ② circles …" as one of 14 characters pronounced ''lín'', and alphabetically lists 17 words with ''lín'' as the first syllable, for instance, ''línchǎnpǐn'' 林产品 "forest products", ''línhǎi'' 林海 "immense forest", and ''línyè'' 林業 "forestry". The ''ABC Dictionary'' includes ''lín'' 林 "① forest; woods; grove ② forestry…" as one of 6 characters pronounced ''lín'', followed by alphabetically listed ''lin''-initial headwords from ''línbā'' 淋巴 "lymph" to ''línfēng'' 臨風 "facing against the wind", but then ''ling''-initial words begin to appear with ''líng'' 〇 "zero", and only after another three pages will one find ''lìngzūn'' 令尊 "(courteous) your father" followed by ''línhǎi'' "immense forest" (McGinnis 1997: 568). DeFrancis' ''ABC Chinese–English Dictionary'' is aptly described as having "defied the tyranny of Chinese characters" (Clark 2001: 387).

==Content==
The ''ABC Dictionary'' includes 5,425 different Chinese characters and a total 71,486 lexical entries. The dictionary's most notable feature is being entirely arranged by pinyin in the alphabetical order of complete compound words. For example, ''kuàngquán'' 矿泉 "mineral spring" immediately precedes ''kuángquǎnbìng'' 狂犬病 "rabies", which in turn immediately precedes ''kuàngquánshuǐ'' 矿泉水 "mineral water", even though the first and last words begin with the same character and the middle word with another (Sawer 2001: 224).

The present dictionary has several titles: 
*''ABC Dictionary'' ([[half title|half title page]] 1996: i)
*The ''ABC Chinese–English Dictionary: Alphabetically Based Computerized''—with the last three words encircling [[Chinese calligraphy|Chinese calligraphic]] 电脑拼音编码 [''diànnǎo pīnyīn biānmǎ'' "computer pinyin encoding"] ([[title page]] 1996: iii)
*''ABC (Alphabetically Based Computerized) Chinese–English Dictionary'' ([[Colophon (publishing)|colophon]] 1996: iv),
*''ABC Chinese–English Dictionary'' 漢英詞典‧按羅馬字母順序排列 [''Hàn-Yīng cídiǎn ‧ àn luómǎ zìmǔ shùnxù páiliè'' "Chinese–English Dictionary: according to alphabetically sorted romanization"] ([[front cover]]).

The ''ABC Chinese–English Dictionary'' comprises three main sections: an 18-page [[front matter]], the 833-page [[body matter]] of alphabetically arranged entries, and 64-page [[back matter]] with nine appendices.

The front matter includes a [[Table of contents]]; [[Dedication (publishing)|Dedication]] to "China's Staunchest Advocates of Writing Reform"; Editor's Call to Action; [[Acknowledgment (creative arts and sciences)|Acknowledgments]]; [[Introduction (essay)|Introduction]] with I. Distinctive Features of the Dictionary and II. Selection and Definition of Entries; and User's Guide with I. Arrangement of Entries, II. [[Orthography]], III. Explanatory Notes and Examples, IV. Works Consulted, and V. Abbreviations (1996: i–xix).

The dictionary proper gives alphabetically arranged lexical entries and English translation equivalents, from "'''a'''* 啊 '''{{Smallcaps|part.}}''' [i.e., [[Chinese particle|particle]]] ''used as phrase suffix'' ① (''in enumeration'') … ② (''in direct address and exclamation'') … ③ (''indicating obviousness/impatience'' … ④ (''for confirmation'')" to "'''zúzūn''' 族尊 '''{{Smallcaps|n.}}''' clan seniors" (1996: 1 and 833, usage examples omitted).

The ''ABC Dictionary'' has nine Appendices: I. Basic Rules for Hanyu Pinyin Orthography [promulgated by the State Language Commission in 1988]; II. Historical Chronology [from the [[Shang Dynasty]] c. 1700–1045 BC to the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]] "1912–1949" {{sic}} and [[People's Republic of China]] 1949–]; III. Analytic Summary of Transcription Systems [for [[Pinyin]], [[Wade-Giles]], [[Gwoyeu Romatzyh]], [[Yale romanization of Mandarin|Yale Romanization]], and [[Zhuyin Fuhao]]]; IV. Wade-Giles/Pinyin Comparative Table; V. PY/WG/GR/YR/ZF Comparative Table; VI. Radical Index of Traditional Characters, Notes on [[Kangxi Radicals]], Kangxi Radical Chart, Kangxi Radical Index; VII. Stroke Order List of Recurrent Partials; VIII. Stroke Order Index of Characters with Obscure Radicals; IX. Radical Index of Simplified Characters, with Notes on Selected CASS Radicals [viz. the [[Chinese Academy of Social Sciences]] system of 189 [[Radical (Chinese characters)|radicals]] used in dictionaries like the ''[[Xinhua Zidian]]''], High Frequency CASS Radicals, Simplified/Traditional Radical Conversion Table, CASS Radical Chart, CASS Radical Index [for users who want to look up a Chinese [[logograph]]'s pronunciation, listing the 5,425 characters appearing in the dictionary] (1996: 835–897).

DeFrancis' ''ABC Chinese–English Dictionary'' claims six lexicographical distinctions.
:1. It offers the powerful advantage of arranging entries in single-sort alphabetical order as by far the simplest and fastest way to look up a term whose pronunciation is known. Alone among look-up systems, the ABC Dictionary enables users to find words seen only in transcription or heard but not seen in written form. And, since most dictionary consultation involves characters whose pronunciation is known (not just by native speakers, but also by learners beyond the very beginning level), over time the total saving in time is enormous. (Radical indexes of characters are provided for those cases where the pronunciation of a term is not known.)
:2. It has been compiled with the aid of computers and lends itself to further development in electronic as well as printed form.
:3. It makes use of the latest PRC lexicographical developments in respect to selection of terms and rules of orthography.
:4. It utilizes frequency data from both the PRC and Taiwan to indicate the relative frequency of entries that are complete homographs (identical even as to tones) or partial homographs (identical except for tones) as an aid to student learning and computer inputting.
:5. It presents a unique one-to-one correspondence between transcription and characters that permits calling up on computer the desired characters for any entry by simple uninterrupted typing of the corresponding transcription.
:6. It introduces an innovative typographical format that enables its 71,486 entries (3,578 single-syllable and 68,908 multi-syllable entries) to be packed into about one-sixth less space than would be required by conventional dictionaries, while still providing greater legibility, in part thanks to larger characters. The result is a handy portable work that contains an unparalleled number of entries for its size. (1996: xi)

The main source for ''ABC Dictionary'' entries is the 1989 edition of ''Hanyu Pinyin Cihui'' 汉語拼音詞汇 "[[Hanyu Pinyin]] Romanized Lexicon", a semi-official wordlist of 60,400 entries (without definitions) compiled by members of the PRC State Language Commission. Focusing upon the needs of Western students of Chinese, DeFrancis and the editors eliminated some terms and added others. Their dictionary includes many [[neologisms]] such as ''dàgēdà'' 大哥大 "cellular phone" or ''dǎo(r)yé'' 倒爷 "profiteer; speculator", as well as the modern Chinese practice of incorporating the [[Latin alphabet]] in coining Sino-alphabetic words like ''BP-jī'' BP机 "pager; beeper".

In contrast to most Chinese–English dictionaries, DeFrancis' emphasizes multisyllabic ''cí'' "words" rather than monosyllabic ''zì'' "characters". It only includes monosyllabic character entries that are likely to be encountered as free forms or [[unbound morphemes]] (according to the ''Xiandai Hanyu Pinlü Cidian'' 现代汉语频率词典 "Frequency Dictionary of Contemporary Chinese").

Chinese [[word frequency]] is an important aspect of the ''ABC Dictionary'', and it lists [[homophones]] according to their decreasing occurrence. Frequency orders are based largely on ''Xiandai Hanyu Pinlü Cidian'' for monosyllabic entries and ''Zhongwen Shumianyu Pinlü Cidian'' 中文书面语频率词典 "Dictionary of the Chinese Written Language" for polysyllabic words (1996: xiii). For entries with identical spelling, including tones, arrangement is by order of frequency, indicated by a superscript number before the transcription, a device adapted from Western lexicographic practice to distinguish homonyms. For example, "'''''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;dàomù''''' 盜墓 '''{{Smallcaps|vo.}}''' rob graves" and "'''''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;dàomù''''' 道木 '''{{Smallcaps|n.}}''' railway sleeper [tie]". For entries that are homographic if tones are disregarded, the item of highest usage frequency is indicated by an asterisk following the transcription (see ''a''* 啊 above), for instance, "'''''lìguǐ''''' 厉鬼 '''{{Smallcaps|n.}}''' ferocious ghost" and "'''''lìguì*''''' 立柜 '''{{Smallcaps|n.}}''' clothes-closet; wardrobe; hanging cupboard". While frequency information is useful for students learning vocabulary, the ''ABC Dictionary'' chiefly provides it in order to help determine the default items in computer usage. "Our unique combination of letters, tone marks, and raised numbers provides a simple and distinctive one-to-one correspondence between transcription and character(s) that is intended to facilitate computerized handling of the entries." (1996: xiv).

The ''ABC Dictionary'' format for entries is (1996: xiii):
*the pinyin spelling of the word in large [[Emphasis (typography)|boldface]] type
*the corresponding [[simplified Chinese characters]], and for single-character entries with a contrasting [[traditional Chinese character]], it is given in square brackets given upon the first appearance of each character/morpheme (e.g., "'''''wà''''' 袜[襪] '''{{Smallcaps|n.}}''' socks; stockings; hose")
*parts of speech in boldface [[small caps]] (e.g., '''{{Smallcaps|vp.}}''' [[verb phrase]], '''{{Smallcaps|on.}}''' [[onomatopoeia]]), which is especially useful for Western students of Chinese (e.g., "'''huǎnghū''' 恍惚 '''{{Smallcaps|adj./adv.}}''' ① absentminded ② dimly; faintly; seemingly")
*(optional) usage environments (e.g., ''TW'' Taiwan) or registers (''vulg.'' vulgar) in [[angle brackets]] and [[italics]], for instance, "'''''húlǔ''''' 胡虏 '''{{Smallcaps|n.}}''' {{angle bracket|''derog.''}} northern barbarians"
*translation equivalents in [[Roman type]] (e.g., "'''''huàngdang''''' 晃荡 '''{{Smallcaps|v.}}''' rock; shake; sway"); semicolons separate slightly variant meanings of entries, and circled numbers distinguish more widely different meanings (as in '''''huǎnghū''''' above)
*(optional) example phrases and sentences in semi-bold italicized pinyin, but without characters, which users can find through alphabetic lookup, followed by English renderings in Roman type (e.g., "'''''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;tóutòng''''' 头痛 '''{{Smallcaps|v.}}''' have a headache '''''Zhè shì zhēn ràng rén ~!''''' This gives one a real headache!")

Take the ''[[tao|dao]]'' in [[Daoism]] for an example dictionary entry.
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;dào''''' 道 ① road ② channel ③ way ④ doctrine ⑤ Daoism ⑥ line ♦ '''{{Smallcaps|m.}}''' ''for rivers/topics/etc.'' ♦ '''{{Smallcaps|v.}}''' ① say; speak; talk '''''chángyán dào''''' as the saying goes '''''Tā shuō ~: "..."''''' He said: "..." ② think; suppose (1996: 113) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
This concise entry uses a superscript on ''dào'' to denote [[wikt: 道|道]] as the second most commonly occurring unbound character pronounced ''dào'', gives six English translation equivalents, distinguishes syntactic uses as a [[Chinese classifier|measure word]] and a verb, and gives two characterless usage examples ''chángyán dào'' 常言道 and ''Tā shuōdào'' 他說道.

==Reception==
Reviews of DeFrancis' ''ABC Chinese–English Dictionary'' were published by major [[academic journals]] in linguistics (e.g., ''[[The Modern Language Journal]]''), Asian studies (''[[Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society]]''), and sinology (''[[China Review International]]''). Most reviewers criticized certain aspects, such as the difficulty of looking up a traditional Chinese character, but also highly evaluated the innovative dictionary.

Here are three representative examples of praise: "the most extraordinary Chinese–English dictionary I have ever had such pleasure to look Chinese words up in and to read their English definitions" (Bauer 1997: 307); "The thorough scholarship and fresh outlook make it a valuable contribution to Chinese lexicography, while the high production standards and comprehensive coverage of the colloquial language should make it a favourite of all serious students of Modem Chinese" (Jensen 1998: 144); "This excellent one-volume Chinese–English dictionary is a crowning achievement for John DeFrancis, one of the doyens of Chinese language teaching in the United States" (Sawer 2001: 224).

A common area of complaint involves the ''ABC Dictionary'''s treatment of [[Debate on traditional and simplified Chinese characters|traditional and simplified Chinese characters]]. Dictionary entries give simplified characters for headwords, and only give the traditional form upon the first appearance of each character, and in the appendices. For instance, critics say, "looking up characters in traditional form is a bit more trouble than it might be, you must use a special index" (Chung 1998: 660); and the dictionary is "clearly not designed to be used by anyone who does serious work with nonsimplified characters" (Jensen 1998: 144).

One reviewer panned the ''ABC Dictionary'''s supplementary materials. For instance, saying the front matter's "uncommonly profuse" dedication and Editor's Call to Action reveal "no doubt that [[wikt:ax to grind|axes are being ground]]" about writing reform; the Distinctive Features of the Dictionary "reads like an abstract for a research grant application"; and describing most of the appendices as "a hodgepodge of [[pub quiz]] trivia" (Jensen 1998: 143).

Several evaluations of the ''ABC Chinese–English Dictionary'' mention cases in which using the alphabetically-arranged headword entries is more efficient than using a conventionally arranged dictionary with character head entries that list words written with that character as the first. Robert S. Bauer, a linguist of Cantonese at [[Hong Kong Polytechnic University]] says the dictionary works best when users hear a word pronounced but do not know how to write it in characters, they can very quickly look it up in pinyin order and find the correct characters and meanings. However, to look up an unknown character's pronunciation and meaning, then one needs to use a radical-indexed dictionary. Bauer says "I have generally succeeded in finding almost all the words and expressions I have tried to look up; this I regard as quite remarkable since I cannot say the same about other dictionaries I have been consulting over my more than 25 years of working on Chinese." (1997: 308). Sean Jensen says alphabetical collation is "truly iconoclastic" in the tradition-rich world of Chinese lexicography and describes experimenting with using the dictionary.
&lt;blockquote&gt;I am used to the "old style" dictionaries based on radicals, and I was disposed to approach the ''ABC Dictionary'' with some skepticism. But having used it for two months I have so(sic) say that it is nothing short of wonderful! It is a pleasure to be able to use a Chinese dictionary in the same way that one uses a French or German dictionary. The typography is exceptionally clear, and the sheer quantity of words per page, arranged alphabetically, has the effect of bringing the melodies of spoken Chinese alive. (1998: 144) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Michael Sawer, professor of Chinese at the [[University of Canberra]], says using the ''ABC Dictionary'' does not make it easy to quickly find all the words beginning with the same Chinese character; but it does enable readers to easily find all those pronounced the same (disregarding tonal differences), as well as which among homophonous words is used most frequently (2001: 224).

Taking a contrary view, Karen Steffen Chung, professor of Chinese at [[National Taiwan University]], found using DeFrancis' dictionary less satisfying than traditional dictionaries, where all compounds beginning with the same character are listed together under that character head entry. Giving the [[circular reasoning|circular]] example of a hypothetical dictionary user wanting to find all the compounds beginning with ''shí'' 實 "to realize", which is certainly easier with a customary Chinese dictionary than with the ''ABC'', Chung says that the alphabetic arrangement is unfortunately "its biggest drawback", and while "this may reflect an ideal of treating Chinese primarily as a spoken rather than written language, it also goes against native habit and intuition." (1998: 660).

Scott McGinnis, professor of Chinese at the [[University of Maryland]], explains that users of the ''ABC Dictionary'' who are already familiar with [[written Chinese]] and dictionaries organized by character headings must "forget" what they know about the Mandarin syllabic inventory and focus strictly on the spelling. For some dictionary users, purely pinyin-dependent sequencing such as ''cuānzi'' 镩子 "ice pick" to ''cūbào'' 粗暴 "rude; rough; crude" and ''nǎngshí'' 曩时 "(written) in olden days; of yore" to ''nánguā'' 南瓜 "pumpkin" "may be at least initially confusing" (1997: 568).

Jan W. Walls, professor of Chinese language and culture at [[Simon Fraser University]], describes some minor oversights in the dictionary such as the "'''''dīshì''''' [[wikt:的士|的士]] {{angle bracket|''loan''}} taxi" entry, which might imply the borrowing came directly from English, when it actually is a [[loanword]] from [[Cantonese]] ''dik&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; si&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;'' 的士 transcribing ''[[taxi]]''. But this is a minor point, "merely ''meizhong-buzu'' 美中不足 (defined in ''ABC'' as "blemish in sth. otherwise perfect") that should not detract from the great value of this important work … which is quite likely to become a standard reference work for English-speaking students of Mandarin, and to remain so for quite some time." (1998: 113–114).

The expanded 2003 ''ABC Chinese–English Comprehensive Dictionary'' had fewer academic reviews than the 1996 ''ABC Chinese–English Dictionary''.

Michael Sawer, who also reviewed the original ''ABC Dictionary'', calls this comprehensive dictionary an "outstanding contribution to the field, in many ways better than other comparable dictionaries" (2004: 313). He makes comparisons between the ''ABC Chinese–English Comprehensive Dictionary'' (called "''ABC''") and two bilingual dictionaries aimed more at native speakers of Chinese who are learning English: the ''Han-Ying Da Cidian'' (Wu 1993, "''CED''" Chinese–English Dictionary) and ''Xiandai Hanyu Cidian: Han-Ying Shuangyu'' (CASSIL 2002, "''CCD''" Contemporary Chinese Dictionary).

The 2003 ''ABC'', like the 1996 first edition, is arranged in strict single-sort alphabetical order, while both the ''CED'' and ''CCD'' are in double-sort alphabetic order—that is, the first syllables of each word are arranged in alphabetic order, and then within each tone category in order of different characters. Take for instance, dictionary users wanting to look up ''yìshi'' 意识 "consciousness; mentality". A user who knows the pronunciation begins with ''yì'' can search (in ascending number of strokes) through some eighty characters pronounced ''yì'' before finding 意, and then 意识; or a user who knows that ''yìshi'' is written 意识 can find 意 in the radical index, under the [[radical 61|"heart radical"]] 心, then the 9 remaining strokes in 音, and find the page number for the 意 head entry (Sawer 2004: 310). A great advantage of ''ABC'' is that you can immediately look up a word you have heard but whose exact tone, meaning, and characters are unknown to you. For ''yishi'' in all tonal combinations, this dictionary gives 46 different words, with 意识 easily found. What an ''ABC'' user cannot straightforwardly see (which of course they can in the other two dictionaries) is all the words listed beginning with ''yì'' 意.

''ABC'' gives grammatical information with around 30 tags, including both parts of speech ("V." for verb) and other tags ("ID." for idiom). ''CED'' provides just 11 grammatical tags, while ''CCD'' only marks numerals and classifiers. The comprehensive grammatical tags in ''ABC'' are "a most valuable feature", especially for learners of Chinese, and many words have more than one grammatical function (e.g., '' xuéxí'' 学习 [學習] '''{{Smallcaps|v.}}''' study; learn; emulate ◆ '''{{Smallcaps|n.}}''' learning"). Another useful ''ABC'' grammatical tag is B.F. for "bound form" (as opposed to free form words, mentioned above), but this distinction is not usually indicated in PRC dictionaries such as ''CED'' and ''CCD'' (Sawer 2004: 311).

[[Proper nouns]] receive a particularly ample treatment in ''ABC'' (especially compared with ''CED'' and ''CCD''). These include people's names (e.g., some 15 beginning with the surname [[Li (surname 李)|Lǐ 李]], ranging from the famous poet [[Li Bai]] to the former PRC President [[Li Xiannian]]), names of automobiles (like ''Xiàlì'' 夏利 "[[Daihatsu Charade|Charade]]"), and many [[toponyms]] (''Xiàwēiyí'' 夏威夷 "[[Hawai{{okina}}i]]", spelled with the [[ʻokina]]) (Sawer 2004: 312).

Yanfang Tang, professor of Chinese at the [[College of William and Mary]], says the ''ABC Chinese–English Comprehensive Dictionary'' "stands above its peers as one of the most comprehensive, informative, and useful tools in the study of and dealing with the Chinese language" (2005: 145). This dictionary is a valuable asset for several types of users. Native speakers will particularly benefit from the "authentic and accurate English translations" of Chinese words and phrases, which are an improvement over sometimes "stiff and awkward" translations in previous Chinese–English dictionaries, which were edited predominantly by Anglophone native speakers of Chinese. Chinese–English translators, students of [[Chinese as a foreign language]], and compilers of Chinese language textbooks will find this dictionary indispensable for providing comprehensive linguistic information. Nonnative speakers of Chinese will find the dictionary handy to use, and those who are accustomed to alphabets will find locating a Chinese word in this alphabetically arranged dictionary "almost an act of second nature". Advanced learners of Chinese who have a firm command of pinyin will also benefit, especially in cases when they know how to pronounce a word but do not remember how to write it, and will be able to quickly find the character (2005: 145).

Tang suggests an improvement for future ''ABC Dictionary'' editions. Users who want to look up an unfamiliar character may find the layout of Stroke-Order Index and Radical Index to be "awkward, inconvenient, and time-consuming" because after looking the character up, the index gives the pinyin pronunciation instead of the page (2005: 146).

'''AboutUs.com''' is a [[wiki]] [[Internet domain]] directory. It listed [[websites]] along with information about their content. As a wiki, AboutUs allows Internet users to add entries or modify information. AboutUs.com has since become a wiki for more than just websites. The site now allows pages to be created for people, places, and almost anything else.

[[Ray King (entrepreneur)|Ray King]], [[Jay Westerdal]], and Paul Stahura founded AboutUs in 2005. Later in 2006 a small staff of five people in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Oregon]], [[United States]] developed out the site. The staff expanded to more than thirty people and two continents with an office in [[Lahore]], [[Pakistan]]. From May 2007 to early 2011, [[Ward Cunningham]], developer of the first [[wiki]], was the [[chief technology officer]] of AboutUs.

AboutUs.com attracted at least 1.4 million U.S. visitors in July 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://siteanalytics.compete.com/aboutus.com?metric=uv AboutUs.com People Count according to Compete.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Traffic and revenue started declining sharply and in 2013 AboutUs.com and its assets were sold to Omkarasana LLC, a Colorado Limited Liability Company located in Denver. The new company has since redesigned the website, migrated its infrastructure over to Amazon Web Services, and increased visitors and revenue. There are now approximately four individuals that actively operate the site.

==Website contents==
There were more than ten million entries on AboutUs.com as of March 2008, and new pages are added at a rate of about 25,000 a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.portlandtribune.com/rethinking/story.php?story_id=120430910578805900 |title=Startup mines for riches in collaboration software |first=Jim |last=Redden |work=[[The Portland Tribune]] |date=2008-03-04 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080314015958/http://www.portlandtribune.com/rethinking/story.php?story_id=120430910578805900 |archivedate=2008-03-14 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most entries were created by a [[web robot]] (bot); web searches by users direct the bot to create a page for a web domain. In many cases the content is simply a republication of the contents of the "About us", "About me", or similar page on the website. Such pages typically describe the entity that owns the site, and may include self-promotional information, which AboutUs.com does not restrict. In many other cases the content of an entry consists of the [[whois]] data for the website. As of February 2014, there were more than 20 million entries.

===Data use===
Some websites that analyze domains and traffic link to AboutUs.com as a point of additional reference. Notably, the "[[Whois]]" site [http://www.domaintools.com/ DomainTools] now references the Aboutus.com listing along with standard server information, domain ownership and history, and additional data. AboutUs has also referenced whois data content from the registrars [[Network Solutions]] and [[Register.com]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.domaintools.com/2007/02/network-solutions-and-registercom-join-aboutusorg-project/ Network Solutions and Register.com join AboutUs.com project] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070307191644/http://blog.domaintools.com/2007/02/network-solutions-and-registercom-join-aboutusorg-project/ |date=March 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malware domains===
To prevent users from visiting [[malware]] domains, editors work with [[McAfee]] SiteAdvisor&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siteadvisor.com/sites/MalwareSite McAfee Siteadvisor.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and PHSDL&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.phsdl.net/project_honeypot.php |title=PHSDL - Project Honeypot Spam Domains List |access-date=2008-01-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120105248/http://www.phsdl.net/project_honeypot.php |archive-date=2008-01-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to identify such domains. Once a malware domain is identified, an AboutUs MalwareSite [[Template (programming)|template]] is placed to warn users.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aboutus.com/Template:MalwareSite AboutUs Template:MalwareSite]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popularity==
AboutUs.com is an open directory, and does not restrict website owners from writing in their own comments, or referencing commercial information that is not necessarily notable; webmasters are permitted to engage in self-promotion in terms of highlighting their website's features.

AboutUs.com fills the gap for webmasters by encouraging the posting of information about all websites regardless of notability or commercial interest.

Because of the open editing policy, and inclusion of commercial sites, it has grown rapidly in its content. It is also popular among webmasters or website owners seeking to include their "about us" information on AboutUs.com, as a central point of summary information on the web.

==Funding==
In November 2006, AboutUs closed its initial financing round for one million [[United States dollar|dollars]].&lt;ref&gt;Aliza Earnshaw, [http://www.bizjournals.com/portland/stories/2006/11/13/story2.html?page=1&amp;b=1163394000^1374690 "Startup hits the money with biz wiki"], ''Portland Business Journal'', November 10, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2009, AboutUs secured a $5 million funding round from [[Voyager Capital]].&lt;ref&gt;Aliza Earnshaw, [http://portland.bizjournals.com/portland/stories/2009/01/12/story2.html "AboutUs nabs $5M infusion"], ''Portland Business Journal'', January 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac''''' was published for the years 1855 to 1980, containing information necessary for astronomers, surveyors, and navigators. It was based on the original British publication, ''[[The Nautical Almanac |The Nautical Almanac and Astronomical Ephemeris]]'', with which it merged to form ''[[Astronomical Almanac|The Astronomical Almanac]]'', published from the year 1981 to the present.

==History==
Authorized by Congress in 1849, the American Nautical Almanac Office was founded and attached to the [[Department of the Navy]] with [[Charles Henry Davis]] as the first superintendent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Biographical Encyclopedia of Astronomers |last=Hockey |first=Thomas |year=2009 |publisher=[[Springer Publishing]] |isbn=978-0-387-31022-0 |accessdate=August 22, 2012 |url=http://www.springerreference.com/docs/html/chapterdbid/58342.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac'' was first published in 1852, containing data for the year 1855. Its data was originally calculated by human "computers", such as [[Chauncey Wright]] and [[Joseph Winlock (astronomer)|Joseph Winlock]]. Between 1855 and 1881 it had two parts, the first for the [[Prime Meridian|meridian of Greenwich]] contained data on the [[Sun]], [[Moon]], [[lunar distance (navigation)|lunar distances]], [[Venus]], [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]], and [[Saturn]], which was published separately as ''The American Nautical Almanac''. The second part contained data for the [[Washington meridian|meridian of Washington]] on the Sun, Moon, planets, principal stars, [[eclipse]]s, [[occultation]]s, and other phenomena. Beginning in 1882, data for [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Uranus]], and [[Neptune]] was added to the first part, with eclipses, occultations, and other phenomena forming a separate third part. In 1916, ''The American Nautical Almanac'' ceased to be a reprint of the first part of the ''American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac'', becoming a separately prepared volume for the navigator. In 1937, the ''American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac'' was divided into seven parts, with data for the meridian of Washington substantially reduced, then eliminated beginning in 1951. Data for [[Pluto]] was added in 1950.&lt;ref name=Seidelmann&gt;P. Kenneth Seidelmann, ed., ''Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac'' (Mill Valley, California: University Science Books, 1992) 613–615.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1960, all parts except for a few introductory pages were jointly calculated and typeset by the American Nautical Almanac Office and [[Her Majesty's Nautical Almanac Office]] but published separately within ''The American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac'' and ''The Astronomical Ephemeris'', a new name for the old British title ''The Nautical Almanac and Astronomical Ephemeris''. Beginning in 1981, the title ''The American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac'' and the British title ''The Astronomical Ephemeris'' were completely merged under the single title ''The Astronomical Almanac''.&lt;ref name=Seidelmann/&gt;

'''''An Atlas of Fantasy''''', compiled by [[Jeremiah Benjamin Post]], was originally published in 1973 by [[Mirage Press]] and revised for a 1979 edition by [[Ballantine Books]]. The 1979 edition dropped twelve maps from the first edition and added fourteen new ones. It also included an introduction by [[Lester del Rey]].

To remain of manageable size, the ''Atlas'' excludes advertising maps, cartograms, most disproportionate maps, and alternate history ("might have been") maps, focusing instead on imaginary lands derived from literary sources. It purposefully omits "one-to-one" maps such as [[Thomas Hardy's Wessex]] (which merely renames places in southwest England), but includes [[Barsetshire]] and [[Yoknapatawpha County]], which are evidently considered to be sufficiently fictionalized. The emphasis is on science fiction and fantasy, though Post suggests there exist enough mystery fiction maps to someday create ''The Detectives' Handy Pocket Atlas''. Other maps were omitted due to permission costs or reproduction quality.

The maps are reproduced from many sources, and an Index of Artists is included.

'''Baike.com''' ({{zh|c=互动百科|p=Hùdòng Bǎikē}}), formerly '''Hudong''' and '''Hoodong''', is a for-profit [[social network]] in China, including the world's largest [[Chinese encyclopedia]]/news website.&lt;ref name=CD /&gt;&lt;ref name=nr /&gt; It is China's largest [[wiki]] site, using paid advertising,&lt;ref name="iftf.typepad.com"&gt;[http://iftf.typepad.com/virtualchina/2007/12/innovative-chin.html Innovative Chinese wiki software: interview with Hoodong], 10 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt; with  over 7 million articles and more than 5 million volunteers, as of April 2013.&lt;ref name=CD /&gt;&lt;ref name=nr&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sys-con.com/node/1184616|title=Hudong.com Confirms Expansion into Overseas Market, Invading Wikipedia's territory |work= Hudong.com press release|date=12 November 2009|accessdate=9 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://thenextweb.com/asia/2009/11/24/hudong-thumped-wikipedia-china/ How Hudong Thumped Wikipedia in China], TNW, 24 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
However, Baike.com is a news/[[neologism]] encyclopedia,&lt;ref name=CD /&gt; and hence, it does not restrict articles to only long-term, sourced text with balanced point-of-view content.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} The contributors agree to release their writings with perpetual royalty-free license to publish their content, but it is not free for re-use on other websites.&lt;ref name=HD7 /&gt; {{As of|2017|01}}, it had more than 16 million articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=互动百科|url=http://www.baike.com/|publisher=Hudong Baike|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Baike.com was founded in 2005 by CEO [[Pan Haidong]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://china.bvcapital.com/?p=77 |title=Hoodong: Homegrown Wiki |date=27 November 2007 |work=BV Capital Blog |publisher=BV Capital |accessdate=31 January 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071130082253/http://china.bvcapital.com/?p=77 |archivedate=30 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who had moved back to China after earning a Ph.D. in systems engineering from [[Boston University]] in 2002.&lt;ref name=forbes&gt;{{cite news|title=Why Draper Funded China's Wikipedia|newspaper=Forbes|date=23 August 2011|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/rebeccafannin/2011/08/23/why-draper-funded-chinas-wikipedia/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baike.com, a 2007 RedHerring 100 Asia company, developed its own wiki software platform, called [[HDWiki]], as a rival to [[MediaWiki]]. The system has some [[social networking]]-like interactive features, such as user profile, friends and groups. The first version was released in November 2006 and by November 2007 version 3 with added functions, features, and more stability was released.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fugumobile.com/news/Red_Herring_100_Asia.htm Red Herring 100 Asia, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

The HDWiki software is free for non-commercial use, has been downloaded 200,000 times and currently supports over 1,000 other web sites in China (as of December 2007), consisting mostly of tech researchers, [[open source software]] groups, government, universities, and high school students.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

In 2011, it was announced that [[Draper Fisher Jurvetson]] had invested $15 million in Baike.com.&lt;ref name=forbes /&gt;

On 22 February 2012, Baike.com submitted a complaint to the [[State Administration for Industry and Commerce]] asking for a review of the behavior of [[Baidu]], accusing it of being monopolistic.&lt;ref&gt;Yang, Yang (杨阳 ''Yáng Yáng''). Translated by Guo Wei. "[http://www.eeo.com.cn/ens/Industry/2011/03/04/195125.shtml China's "Wikipedia" Submits Complaint about Baidu]."

([https://www.webcitation.org/mainframe.php Archive])&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2012, the company changed its English name from Hudong to Baike.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.donews.com/original/201212/1705342.shtm |title=互动百科宣布启用新域名及新版LOGO |publisher=[[DoNews]]|date=5 December 2012|accessdate=21 July 2014|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1944">'''Baksı Museum''' is a [[museum]] located in [[Bayburt]], [[Turkey]].  “Baksı” literally means “healer, helper, protector” in the [[Central Asia]]. It is located near the Black Sea. The museum offers contemporary art and traditional handcrafts.  The basic aim of the foundation is, as quoted by founder Professor Hüsamettin Koçan, to "disseminate art and culture by bringing together contemporary and traditional art, to collect, document, classify, preserve and promote works of contemporary and traditional art, to use this base in realizing creation, and to hand local and national cultural values down to future generations" &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.baksi.org/about-baksi/what-kind-of-museum.aspx?lvl1=1|title=Baksı Müzesi|website=en.baksi.org|access-date=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==History==
The museum was the idea of the painter and academic Professor [[Hüsamettin Koçan]], who decided to build a museum in his hometown in the [[Black Sea]] region of Bayburt.&lt;ref name=hur&gt;{{cite news|last=Sanat|first=Milliyet|title=Black Sea museum combines Turkish crafts, contemporary art|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/default.aspx?pageid=438&amp;n=traditional-and-the-contemporary-combines-2010-07-14|accessdate=2014-03-09|newspaper=Huriyet Daily News|date=2010-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The museum was opened in July, 2010, after taking approximately 20 years of preparation. Professor Hüsamettin Koçan said, “I didn’t do this for my own village, I did it for the people who live in my village and everywhere.”

{{Slavery}}
'''Blackbirding''' involves the coercion of people through trickery and [[kidnapping]] to work as [[worker | labourers]]. Generally, persons of European ancestry, or others being paid by them, coerced persons of indigenous ancestry as labourers throughout the Southeast Pacific region through this system. Blackbirders sought laborers for several major industries or plantations.

From the 1860s, blackbirding ships in the [[Pacific Ocean | Pacific]] sought workers to mine the [[guano]] deposits on the [[Chincha Islands]] in Peru.&lt;ref name="Maude1981"&gt;H. E. Maude, ''Slavers in Paradise'', Institute of Pacific Studies (1981)&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1870s the blackbirding trade focused on supplying labourers to Southeast Asian [[plantations]], particularly those for [[sugar-cane]] in [[Queensland]] and [[Fiji]].&lt;ref name="Willoughby"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.museum.vic.gov.au/federation/pdfs/multiw.pdf |last= Willoughby |first= Emma |title= Our Federation Journey 1901–2001 |format= PDF |publisher= Museum Victoria |accessdate= 14 June 2006 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060625205722/http://www.museum.vic.gov.au/federation/pdfs/multiw.pdf |archivedate= 25 June 2006 |df= dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reid Mortensen, (2009), [http://www.paclii.org/journals/fJSPL/vol04/7.shtml "Slaving In Australian Courts: Blackbirding Cases, 1869–1871"], ''Journal of South Pacific Law'', 13:1, accessed 7 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The first documented practice of a major blackbirding industry for sugar-cane labourers occurred between 1842 and 1904.{{cn|date=October 2018}} [[Indigenous peoples|Indigenous]] persons of nearby [[Pacific islands]] or northern [[Queensland]] were recruited or coerced by blackbirding colonial Europeans. In the early days of the [[Pearling in Western Australia|pearling industry in Western Australia]] at [[Karratha, Western Australia|Nickol Bay]] and [[Broome, Western Australia|Broome]], local [[Aboriginal Australians|Aborigines]] were blackbirded from the surrounding areas.

Blackbirding has continued to the present day in [[developing countries]]. One example is the kidnapping and coercion at gunpoint of indigenous people in [[Central America]] to work as [[plantation economy| plantation labourer]]s in the region. They are exposed to heavy [[pesticide]] loads and do hard labour for very little pay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== Etymology ==
The term may have been formed directly as a contraction of "blackbird catching"; "blackbird" was a slang term for the local indigenous people.&lt;!-- Where? A slang term by whom? --&gt;

== Blackbirding in Polynesia in the 1860s ==
[[File:Map OC-Polynesia.PNG|thumb|Geographic definition of Polynesia, surrounded by a pink line]]

For several months between 1862–63, crew on Peruvian ships (and a few Chilean ships under the Peruvian flag) combed the smaller islands of [[Polynesia]], from [[Easter Island]] in the eastern Pacific to the Ellice Islands (now [[Tuvalu]]) and the southern atolls of the Gilbert Islands (now [[Kiribati]]), seeking workers to fill an extreme labour shortage in Peru.&lt;ref name="Maude1981"/&gt;

In 1862 J. C. Byrne, an Irish speculator, persuaded countrymen to financially back a scheme to bring "colonists" from the [[New Hebrides]] to Peru as [[indentured]] agricultural workers. The first ship, ''Adelante'', was fitted and on 15 June 1862 set out across the Pacific. Calling in at [[Penrhyn (atoll)|Tongareva]] (Penrhyn) in the northern [[Cook Islands]], Byrne found the one island in the Pacific where the population was willing to leave because of a severe coconut [[famine]]. He took 253 recruits; by September, they were working in Peru as plantation field laborers and [[domestic worker|domestic household servants]].

Almost immediately other speculators and ship owners fitted out ageing ships that traveled to Polynesia to transport "willing colonists". From September 1862 to April 1863, no less than 30 ships set out. As profit was the main motive, many ship captains resorted to dishonest tactics and kidnapping to fill their ships.

===Tonga===
In June 1863 about 350 people were living on {{okina}}'Ata atoll in [[Tonga]], in a village called Kolomaile. Its remains were visible a century later. Captain Thomas James McGrath of the Tasmanian whaler ''Grecian'', having decided that the new [[slave trade]] was more profitable than whaling, went to the atoll and invited the islanders on board for trading. However, once almost half of the population was on board, he ordered the ship's doors and rooms locked, and the ship sailed away. 144 persons would never return. The ''Grecian'' also tried to take slaves from the Lau group, but was unsuccessful.  McGrath captured only 30 people from [[Niuafo'ou|Niuafou{{okina}}ou]]; this was the second island in [[Tonga]] to be affected. ([['Uiha|{{okina}}Uiha]] was the third island he approached, but there the islanders reversed roles and ambushed the ship ''Margarita''.)

The ''Grecian'' never reached Peru. Probably near [[Pukapuka]] (Cook Islands), McGrath met another slaver, the ''General Prim'', which had left [[Callao]] in March. Its captain was willing to take over the 174 Tongans to quickly return to port, where it arrived on 19 July. Meanwhile, the Peruvian government, under pressure from foreign powers and shocked that its labour plan had turned into a slave trade, had on 28 April 1863 cancelled all licenses. The islanders on board ''General Prim'', and other ships were not allowed to land. They were transferred to other ships chartered by the Peruvian government to return them to their homeland.

By the time the ''Adelante'' (on which the Tongans were put) finally left on 2 October 1863, many of the Tongans had already died or were dying from [[contagious diseases]]. Captain Escurra of the ''Adelante'' (formerly a successful slaver), pocketed his fee of $30/head, but dumped the Tongans on uninhabited [[Cocos Island]]. He later claimed that the 426 [[kanakas]] were affected with [[smallpox]] and a danger to his crew. When the whaler ''Active'' visited the island on 21 October, its crew found some 200 Tongans still alive. A month later the Peruvian warship ''Tumbes'' went to rescue the remaining 38 survivors and took them to [[Paita]], where they were apparently absorbed into the local population.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

===Ellice Islands===
The Rev. A. W. Murray, the earliest European missionary in Tuvalu,&lt;ref&gt;Murray A.W., 1876. ''Forty Years' Mission Work''. London: Nisbet&lt;/ref&gt; described the practices of blackbirders in the [[Tuvalu|Ellice Islands]]. He said they promised islanders that they would be taught about God while working in coconut oil production, but the slavers' intended destination was the [[Chincha Islands]] in Peru. Rev. Murray reported that in 1863, about 180 people&lt;ref&gt;the figure of 171 taken from Funafuti is given by Laumua Kofe, Palagi and Pastors, ''Tuvalu: A History'', Ch. 15, Institute of Pacific Studies, University of the South Pacific and Government of Tuvalu, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; were taken from [[Funafuti]] and about 200 were taken from [[Nukulaelae]],&lt;ref&gt;the figure of 250 taken from Nukulaelae is given by Laumua Kofe, Palagi and Pastors, ''Tuvalu: A History'', Ch. 15, U.S.P./Tuvalu (1983)&lt;/ref&gt; leaving fewer than 100 of the 300 recorded in 1861 as living on Nukulaelae.&lt;ref&gt;W.F. Newton, ''The Early Population of the Ellice Islands'', 76(2) (1967) ''The Journal of the Polynesian Society,'' 197–204.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;the figure of 250 taken from Nukulaelae is stated by Richard Bedford, Barrie Macdonald &amp; Doug Monro, ''Population Estimates for Kiribati and Tuvalu'' (1980) 89(1) Journal of the Polynesian Society 199&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other islands===
[[Bully Hayes]], an [[United States of America|American]] ship-captain who achieved notoriety for his activities in the Pacific from the 1850s to the 1870s, is described{{by whom|date=July 2018}} as arriving in [[Papeete]], [[Tahiti]] in December 1868 on his ship ''Rona'' with 150 men from [[Niue]]. Hayes offered them for sale as contract or [[indentured labourers]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;
James A. Michener &amp; A. Grove Day, "Bully Hayes, South Sea Buccaneer", in ''Rascals in Paradise'', London: Secker &amp; Warburg 1957.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The expansion of plantations in [[Fiji]] and in [[Samoa]], as well as sugar plantations in Australia, also created market destinations for blackbirders. Ships also called at the islands of [[Melanesia]] and [[Micronesia]], taking off their workers for other places. In 1871 the first Anglican [[Bishop of Melanesia]], [[John Patteson (bishop)|John Patteson]], was killed on [[Nukapu]] island (one of the [[Solomon Islands]]) by indigenous people five days after blackbirders had killed one man and abducted five others there.

So many ships entered the blackbirding trade (with adverse effects on islanders) that the British Navy sent ships from [[Australia Station]] into the Pacific to suppress the trade. (By 1808 both [[Slave Trade Act 1807|Great Britain]] and the [[Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves|United States]] had prohibited the African slave trade.) However, the ships of the [[Australian Squadron]] ([[HMS Basilisk (1848)|''HMS Basilisk'']], [[HMS Beagle (1872)|''HMS Beagle'']], [[HMS Conflict (1873)|''HMS Conflict'']], [[HMS Renard (1873)|''HMS Renard'']], [[HMS Sandfly (1872)|''HMS Sandfly'']] and [[HMS Rosario (1860)|''HMS Rosario'']]) did not succeed in suppressing the blackbirding trade.

== In Australia{{anchor|Australia}} ==
From the 1860s, the demand for labour in [[Queensland]], Australia, resulted in blackbirding in the region. [[Queensland]] was a self-governing [[British colony]] in northeastern Australia until 1901, when it became a state of the [[Commonwealth of Australia]]. Over a period of 40 years, from the mid-19th century to the early 20th century, traders "recruited" Kanaka labourers for the sugar cane fields of Queensland, from the [[New Hebrides]] (now [[Vanuatu]]), [[Papua New Guinea]], the [[Solomon Islands]] and the [[Loyalty Islands]] of [[New Caledonia]] as well as [[Niue]].  The Queensland government tried to regulate the trade: it required every ship engaged in recruiting labourers from the Pacific islands to carry a person approved by the government to ensure that labourers were willingly recruited and not kidnapped.  Although, such government observers were often corrupted by bonuses paid for labourers 'recruited,' or blinded by alcohol, and did little or nothing to prevent sea-captains from tricking islanders on-board or otherwise engaging in kidnapping with violence.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; [[Joe Melvin]], an investigative journalist who, undercover, in 1892 joined the crew of Queensland blackbirding ship ''Helena'', found no instances of intimidation or misrepresentation and concluded that the Islanders recruited did so "willingly and cannily".&lt;ref&gt;Peter Corris, 'Melvin, Joseph Dalgarno (1852–1909)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/melvin-joseph-dalgarno-7556/text13185, published first in hardcopy 1986, accessed online 9 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The generally coercive recruitment was similar to the [[press-gang]]s once employed by the [[Royal Navy]] in England. Some 55,000 to 62,500 Kanakas were brought to Australia.&lt;ref name="AHRC"&gt;Tracey Flanagan, Meredith Wilkie, and Susanna Iuliano. [http://www.hreoc.gov.au/racial_discrimination/forum/Erace/south_sea.html "Australian South Sea Islanders: A Century of Race Discrimination under Australian Law"], Australian Human Rights Commission.&lt;/ref&gt;

These people were referred to as Kanakas (the [[Kanak people|French equivalent ''Canaques'']] is still used to refer to the ethnic [[Melanesians]] in New Caledonia) and came from the [[Pacific Ocean|Western Pacific]] islands: from [[Melanesia]], mainly the [[Solomon Islands]] and the [[New Hebrides]], with a small number from the [[Polynesia]]n and Micronesian islands such as [[Tonga]] (mainly [['Ata]]), [[Kiribati]], [[Tuvalu]], and [[Loyalty Islands]]. Many of the workers were effectively slaves, but they were officially called "indentured labourers" or the like. Some [[Australian Aboriginal]] people, especially from [[Cape York Peninsula]], were also kidnapped and transported south to work on the farms.

The methods of blackbirding were varied. Some labourers were willing to be taken to Australia to work, while others were tricked or forced. In some cases blackbirding ships (which made huge profits) would entice entire villages by luring them on board for trade or a religious service, and then setting sail. Many died during the voyage due to unsanitary conditions,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} and in the fields due to the hard manual labour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.premiers.qld.gov.au/About_the_department/publications/multicultural/Australian_South_Sea_Islander_Training_Package/ |title=Queensland Government, ''Australian South Sea Islander Training Package'' |accessdate=2016-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012203315/http://www.premiers.qld.gov.au/About_the_department/publications/multicultural/Australian_South_Sea_Islander_Training_Package/ |archivedate=12 October 2006 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The question of how many Islanders were kidnapped or "blackbirded" is unknown and remains controversial. Official documents and accounts from the period often conflict with the oral tradition passed down by the descendants of workers. Stories of blatantly violent kidnapping tended to relate to the first 10–15 years of the trade.

The majority of the 10,000 Pacific Islanders remaining in Australia in 1901 were compulsorily repatriated from 1906–08 under the ''[[Pacific Island Labourers Act 1901]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?sdID=86 |title=Documenting Democracy |publisher=Foundingdocs.gov.au |date= |accessdate=9 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091026225820/http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?sdID=86 |archivedate=26 October 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who were married to an Australian were exempt from compulsory repatriation. Today, the descendants of those who remained are officially referred to as [[South Sea Islanders]]. A 1992 census of South Sea Islanders reported around 10,000 descendants living in Queensland. Fewer than 3,500 were reported in the 2001 Australian census.&lt;ref name="AHRC"/&gt;

== In Fiji ==
[[File:Melanesian Cultural Area.png|thumb|Map of [[Melanesia]]]]

The blackbirding era began in [[Fiji]] in 1865 when the first [[New Hebrides|New Hebridean]] and [[Solomon Island]] labourers were transported there to work on cotton plantations. The [[American Civil War]] had cut off the supply of cotton to the international market when the Union blockaded southern ports. Cotton cultivation was potentially an extremely profitable business. Thousands of European planters flocked to Fiji to establish plantations but found the natives unwilling to adapt to their plans. They sought labour from the [[Melanesia]]n islands. On 5 July 1865 [[Ben Pease]] received the first licence to provide 40 labourers from the [[New Hebrides]] to [[Fiji]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.janesoceania.com/oceania_blackbirding1/index.htm |title=The Story of Blackbirding in the South Seas – Part 2 |author=Jane Resture| publisher=Janesoceania.com |date= |accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] and [[Queensland]] governments tried to regulate this recruiting and transport of labour. Melanesian labourers were to be recruited for a term of three years, paid three pounds per year, issued with basic clothing and given access to the company store for supplies. Most Melanesians were recruited by deceit, usually being enticed aboard ships with gifts, and then locked up. The living and working conditions for them in Fiji were worse than those suffered by the later [[Demographics of India|Indian]] [[indenture]]d labourers. In 1875, the chief medical officer in Fiji, Sir [[William MacGregor]], listed a mortality rate of 540 out of every 1000 labourers. After the expiry of the three-year contract, the government required captains to transport the labourers back to their villages, but most ship captains dropped them off at the first island they sighted off the Fiji waters. The British sent warships to enforce the law (Pacific Islanders' Protection Act of 1872) but only a small proportion of the culprits were prosecuted.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

A notorious incident of the blackbirding trade was the 1871 voyage of the [[brig]] ''Carl'', organised by Dr James Patrick Murray,&lt;ref name="G. Elmslie, 1979"&gt;R. G. Elmslie, 'The Colonial Career of James Patrick Murray', ''Australian and New Zealand Journal of Surgery'', (1979) 49(1):154-62&lt;/ref&gt; to recruit labourers to work in the plantations of Fiji.  Murray had his men reverse their collars and carry black books, so to appear to be church [[missionaries]].  When islanders were enticed to a religious service, Murray and his men would produce guns and force the islanders onto boats.  During the voyage Murray shot about 60 islanders.  He was never brought to trial for his actions, as he was given immunity in return for giving evidence against his crew members.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="G. Elmslie, 1979"/&gt; The captain of the ''Carl'', Joseph Armstrong, was later sentenced to death.&lt;ref name="G. Elmslie, 1979"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Sydney Morning Herald'', 20–23 Nov 1872, 1 March 1873&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1879, British planters arranged for the transport of [[Indian indenture system|Indian indentured labourers]] in Fiji. The number of Melanesian labourers declined, but they were still being recruited and employed in such places as sugar mills and ports, until the start of the [[First World War]]. In addition, as recounted by writer Jack London, the British and Queensland ships often used black crews, sometimes recruited among the islanders. Most of the Melanesians recruited were males. After the recruitment ended, those who chose to stay in Fiji took Fijian wives and settled in areas around [[Suva]]. Their multi-cultural descendants identify as a distinct community but, to outsiders, their language and culture cannot be distinguished from native Fijians.

Descendants of Solomon Islanders have filed land claims to assert their right to traditional settlements in Fiji: a group living at [[Tamavua-i-Wai]] in Fiji received a [[High Court of Fiji|High Court]] verdict in their favour on 1 February 2007. The court refused a claim by the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] to force the islanders to vacate the land on which they had been living for seventy years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fijitimes.com/story.aspx?id=56292 |title=Solomon Islands descendants win land case |publisher=Fijitimes.com |date=2 February 2007 |accessdate=9 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Resistance ==
Islanders fought back and sometimes were able to resist those engaged in blackbirding. Historic events in Melanesia are being assessed in the context of blackbirding, and with the addition of new material from indigenous oral histories and interpreting to acknowledge indigenous agency.&lt;ref name="kolshus"/&gt; The practice of blackbirding attracted significant public attention in Great Britain after native people killed Anglican missionary [[John Coleridge Patteson]], Bishop of Melanesia, in September 1871 on Nukapu in what is now Temotu Province, [[Solomon Islands]]. His death from the beginning was interpreted as resistance by local people to kidnapping and forced labor. Patteson is considered a martyr by the [[Anglican Church]]. A few days before his death, one of the local men had been killed by blackbirders and five others were abducted.&lt;ref name="kolshus"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/00223344.2010.530813 | volume=45 | issue=3 | title=Reassessing the death of Bishop John Coleridge Patteson | year=2010 | journal=The Journal of Pacific History | pages=331–355 | last1 = Kolshus | first1 = Thorgeir | last2 = Hovdhaugen | first2 = Even}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a 2010 article argues for a larger role of women in the event and a different precipitating event. When Patteson tried to persuade islanders to release their children to him to be educated in a distant Christian mission school, Niuvai, wife of the [[paramount chief]], and other women did not want to lose their children to him. Niuvai persuaded the men to kill the bishop.&lt;ref name="kolshus"/&gt; An alternative theory is that Patteson had disrupted the local hierarchy, and especially threatened the patriarchal order.&lt;ref name="kolshus"/&gt;

At the time, Patteson's death caused outrage in England and contributed to the government's cracking down to try to control the abusive aspects of blackbirding. Great Britain annexed Fiji as a way to suppress such slavery.

==Representation in popular culture==
American author [[Jack London]] recounted in his memoir, ''[[The Cruise of the Snark]]'' (1907), an incident at [[Langa Langa Lagoon]] [[Malaita]], [[Solomon Islands]], when the local islanders attacked a "recruiting" ship:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;still bore the tomahawk marks where the [[Malaita]]ns at Langa Langa several months before broke in for the trove of rifles and ammunition locked therein, after bloodily slaughtering Jansen's predecessor, Captain Mackenzie. The burning of the vessel was somehow prevented by the black crew, but this was so unprecedented that the owner feared some complicity between them and the attacking party. However, it could not be proved, and we sailed with the majority of this same crew. The present skipper smilingly warned us that the same tribe still required two more heads from the Minota, to square up for deaths on the Ysabel plantation. (p 387)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/logofsnark00londrich/logofsnark00londrich_djvu.txt |title=The Log of the Stark |date= |accessdate=9 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In another passage from the same book, he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Three fruitless days were spent at Su'u. The Minota got no recruits from the bush and the bushmen got no heads from the Minota. (p 270)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Breakdowns''''' is a collected volume of [[underground comix|underground comic strips]] by American cartoonist [[Art Spiegelman]].  The book is made up of strips dating to before Spiegelman started planning his graphic novel ''[[Maus]]'', but includes the strip "Maus" which presaged the graphic novel, and "Prisoner on the Hell Planet" which is reproduced in ''Maus''.  The original edition of 1977 is subtitled ''From Maus to Now''; the expanded 2008 edition is subtitled ''Portrait of the Artist as a Young %@&amp;*!''.{{sfn|McGlothlin|2011|p=45}}

==Overview==

The original 1977 edition was made up of short, experimental strips, some of which were autobiographical, made between 1972 and 1977.{{sfn|Brodzki|2011|p=51}}  At that stage in his career, Spiegelman was more interested in the formal elements of the comics medium than in its content or storytelling aspects.  He experimented with and explored the relation of panels to each other on the page, pictorial manipulation, and how far one could take a story formally before it became incoherent.{{sfn|Young|2003|p=28}}  He parodied and paid homage to his cartoon heroes, notably [[Chester Gould]]'s ''[[Dick Tracy]]'', ''[[Rex Morgan, M.D.]]'', and [[Winsor McCay]]'s ''[[Dream of the Rarebit Fiend]]''.{{sfn|Young|2003|p=28–29}}

The cover depicts Spiegelman drinking a bottle of [[India ink]]{{sfnm|1a1=McGlothlin|1y=2011|1p=45|2a1=Heller|2y=2002|2p=46}} over repeated variants of the same image.  The title is written in shaky block letters, implying both visual and [[Mental breakdown|psychological breakdowns]].{{sfn|Heller|2002|p=46}}

===''Portrait of the Artist as a Young %@&amp;*!'' (2008)===

The expanded 2008 edition made use of a swirl or squiggle motif.  The seemingly tossed-off squiggle is used in a variety of contexts.  It is first introduced as the expression of surprise of the character on the cover slipping on a copy of the first edition of ''Breakdowns'' (rather than a clichéd banana peel).  At other times it is used to represent the artist himself, or the squiggles he makes as a youth learning to draw.{{sfn|McGlothlin|2011|p=45}}

Spiegelman depicts himself in the vest that has become synonymous with his image since ''Maus'',  in contrast to his appearance in the comics from the original ''Breakdowns''.{{sfn|McGlothlin|2011|p=45}}

==Publication history==

''Breakdowns'' was originally published in an edition that sold less than 3000 copies{{sfn|Blau|2008}} in 1977 by Belier Press as ''Breakdowns: From Maus to Now'', collecting strips that had appeared between 1972 and 1977 in various underground publications, including ''[[Arcade (comics magazine)|Arcade]]'', which Spiegelman had co-edited.  Unusually for American comics at the time, it was published in hardcover.{{sfn|Weiner|2003|p=36}}

It was republished by in an expanded edition [[Pantheon Books]] in 2008 and retitled ''Breakdowns: Portrait of the Artist as a Young %@&amp;*!'', with a new introductory comic and long afterward from which nearly doubles the length of the original book.{{sfn|Mercer|2008}}  When Spiegelman had been working on ''[[In the Shadow of No Towers]]'', a book with many of the formal concerns of ''Breakdowns'', his editor at [[Pantheon Books]], Dan Frank, approached him to reprint ''Breakdowns''.{{sfn|Lorah|2008}}

==Style and analysis==

Spiegelman visually relates the story of a boy who bullied him and spat on his mother in his youth, echoing with irony the well-known [[Charles Atlas]] advertisements such as "The Insult that Made a Man out of Mac" that ran in comic books.  He fills the dialog balloons with text from [[Viktor Shklovsky]]'s essay "Art as Technique".{{sfn|Alber|Heinze|2011|pp=235, 237}}

==Reception and legacy==

The volume failed to capture a wide audience.  Spiegelman says this indifference was the impetus to take on ''[[Maus]]''.{{sfn|Brodzki|2011|p=51}}

!{{rh}}| Offline storage&lt;ref&gt;JavaScript frameworks currently only have the ability to support offline storage by taking advantage of pre-installed browser extensions such as [[Google Gears]]. If a user does not have one of these supported extensions installed in their browser already then offline support will be unavailable to the framework. JavaScript framework developers interested in implementing Gears may want to start with the [https://code.google.com/apis/gears/design.html Gears Getting Started Guide].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10653">[[File:Allidina-Visram.jpg|thumbnail|right|Allidina Visram school in Mombasa, pictured above in 2006, was the location of the FECB "Kilindini" codebreaking outpost during World War II]]
'''The Far East Combined Bureau''', an outstation of the British [[Government Code and Cypher School]], was set up in [[Hong Kong]] in March 1935, to monitor Japanese, and also Chinese and Russian (Soviet) intelligence and radio traffic. Later it moved to [[Singapore]], [[Colombo]] (Ceylon), [[Kilindini]] (Kenya), then returned to Colombo.

==Hong Kong==
The FECB was located in an office block in the [[HMS Tamar (shore station)|Naval dockyard]], with an armed guard at the door (which negated any attempt at secrecy). The intercept site was on [[Stonecutters Island]], four miles across the harbour, and manned by a dozen [[RAF]] and [[Royal Navy|RN]] ratings (plus later four Army signallers). The codebreaking or Y section had [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[Russian language|Russian]] interpreters, under RN Paymaster Arthur (Harry) Shaw, with Dick Thatcher and Neil Barnham. The FECB was headed by the Chief of Intelligence Staff (COIS) Captain John Waller, later by Captain F. J. Wylie.

Shaw had been dealing direct with GC&amp;CS and the C-in-C Far East in [[Shanghai]], but found that Waller expected that everything should go through him, and paid little regard to keeping sources secret. So by 1936 the two most senior naval officers were barely on speaking terms. Colonel Valentine Burkhart found when he arrived in 1936 that the bureau was involved in “turf wars”, although they eventually accepted that they had no control over the use of intelligence reports.

Initially the Y section was to focus on the three main [[Japanese naval codes|Japanese Navy codes and cyphers]]; the Japanese Naval General Cypher, the Flag Officer code and the "tasogare" or basic naval reporting code used to report the sailings of individual ships. In 1938 a section was set up to attack Japanese commercial systems and so to track supply convoys. From 1936 many messages were sent back to London, to be deciphered by [[John Tiltman]], who broke the first version of [[JN-25]] in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2001) pp 130-133&lt;/ref&gt;

== Singapore ==
In August 1939, shortly before the outbreak of war with Germany, the FECB moved to Singapore on [[HMS Birmingham (C19)|HMS ''Birmingham'']] for fear of Japanese attack. A skeleton staff of a codebreaker (Alf Bennett) and four intercept operators were left at Hong Kong, and they were captured by the Japanese on Christmas Day 1941.

FECB went to [[Seletar Airport|Seletar Naval Base]], and the intercept station to [[Kranji]]. An RAF "Y" interception unit, 52 Wireless Unit, arrived in Singapore in early November 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2000) page 95&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Bletchley Park]] was concentrating on German Enigma cyphers, many of the Japanese naval section  in [[Hut 7]] moved to FECB, Singapore. By May 1940 there were forty people working solely on JN-25, who could read simple messages. The new codebook JN-25B was introduced on 1 December 1940, but was broken immediately as the additives were not changed.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2000) page 79&lt;/ref&gt;

There was interchange with [[Station CAST]] at [[Corregidor]], which was better placed to intercept IJN messages, as FECB could only receive the Combined Fleet in home waters at night. FECB also collaborated with the [[United States Army|US Army]] Station 6 intercept site at [[Fort William McKinley|Fort McKinley]] near [[Manila]]. FECB was sent one of the American Purple machines from Bletchley Park in a warship. Supposed to be sent only by warship or military transport, it was trans-shipped at [[Durban]] to the freighter ''Sussex''. The ship’s Master said he landed it at the Naval Store Singapore at the end of December 1941, but the Naval Stores Officer denied any knowledge of it; hopefully it was destroyed or dumped in the sea. But the Hollerith [[tabulating machine]] (minus a key part, which had to borrowed from the [[Indian Railways|Indian State Railways]] in [[Mumbai|Bombay]]) arrived safely in Colombo.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2000) page 105-107&lt;/ref&gt;

FECB also cooperated with Kamer 14 (Room 14), the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands|Dutch]] unit at the [[Bandung Technical College]] in [[Java]]. Initially some of the FECB people went there after the fall of Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2000) page 106 &amp; (2001) pp133-138&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lieutenant]]-[[Commander]] [[Leo Brouwer (naval officer)|Leo Brouwer]] RNN, a Japanese linguist at Kamer 14 was evacuated to Colombo, then Kilindini, and later [[Hut 7]].

==Colombo, Ceylon==
With the Japanese advance down the Malay Peninsula, the Army and RAF codebreakers went to the [[Wireless Experimental Centre]] in Delhi, India.

The RN codebreakers went to Colombo, Ceylon in January 1942, on the troopship HMS Devonshire (with 12 codebreakers' cars as deck cargo). Pembroke College, an Indian boys school, was requisitioned as a combined codebreaking and wireless interception centre. The FECB worked for Admiral Sir [[James Fownes Somerville|James Somerville]], commander-in-chief of the [[Royal Navy]]'s [[Eastern Fleet]]. 

Initially the Bureau wanted to move to Australia, but were reportedly told by the Director of Signals Communication, Lieutenant Commander J. B. Newman that facilities were not available (though many have since been baffled why they were told that).{{sfn|Bou|2012|p=29}}

==Kilindini, Kenya==
In April 1942 most of the RN codebreakers at Colombo moved to [[Kilindini]] near [[Mombasa]] in [[Kenya]], because of a Japanese task force [[Indian Ocean raid|attack]] on Colombo. Two codebreakers and the civilian wireless operators were left in Colombo. An Indian boys school at [[Allidina]] about a mile outside Mombasa and overlooking the Indian Ocean was requisitioned, hence the name ''HMS Allidina''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coastweek.com/codes.htm coastweek.com ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Radio reception was even worse than at Colombo, with only the strongest Japanese signals received. In addition, [[FRUMEL]] &amp;ndash; the US-Australian-British unit based in [[Melbourne, Australia|Melbourne]] that replaced CAST &amp;ndash; was reluctant to exchange material. The American commander Rudolph Fabian was a difficult man to work with, was prejudiced against the British and had a personality clash with [[Eric Nave]] (although Nave was Australian, he was a Royal Navy officer). There were also complaints about Fabian and Frumel from MacArthur's headquarters, although MacArthur was not particularly concerned.{{sfn|Bou|2012|p=44}}

But in September 1942 Kilindini was able to break the Japanese Merchant Shipping Code ([[JN-40]]), because a message was sent twice with extra data. It was a transposition cypher, not a super-enciphered code like JN-25. They also broke JN-152 a simple transposition and substitution cypher for navigation warnings and the previously impenetrable JN-167, another merchant shipping cypher.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2000) page 195 &amp; (2001) pp140-143&lt;/ref&gt; These successes enabled Allied forces e.g. submarines to attack Japanese supply ships, and resulted in the Japanese merchant marine suffering 90 per cent losses by August 1945.

==Return to Colombo==
FECB then moved back to Colombo; the move began in August 1943, with the advance party arriving in Ceylon on 1 September. Eight Wren Typex operators were killed in February 1944, when their ship the ''Khedive Ismail'' en route from Kenya to Ceylon was sunk by a Japanese submarine.{{sfn|Smith|2015|p=233}}

The location chosen was the [[Anderson Golf Course]] six miles from Colombo HQ, hence the name ''HMS Anderson''. Bruce Keith had wanted an up-country site for better reception, but the Chief of Intelligence staff for HQ Eastern Fleet insisted that the codebreakers should be within easy reach of headquarters. While reception was better than at Kilindini, it was affected by a nearby 33 Kv power line and the Racecourse Aerodrome.{{sfn|Smith|2000|p=207}}

== Arthur Shaw == 
Paymaster Arthur (Harry) Shaw was a [[Royal Navy]] codebreaker at the FECB on Hong Kong and then Singapore. He founded the FECB, and headed the diplomatic section. His rank was Paymaster Captain, later Lieutenant Commander. When a RN language student in Japan in the 1920s, he achieved 810 out of 1000 (81%) in a test at the British Embassy ([[Eric Nave]] got 910){{sfn|Jenkins|1992|pp=44,46}}

==Other British stations== 
*[[Wireless Experimental Centre]], Delhi

==Conclusion==
Smith wrote that: ''Only now are the British codebreakers (like [[John Tiltman]], [[Hugh Foss]] and [[Eric Nave]]) beginning to receive the recognition they deserve for breaking Japanese codes and cyphers''.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2001) page 151&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1149">The '''''Fasti vindobonenses''''' are two sets of [[late antique]] [[Roman consul|consular]] annals ("fasti"), found in the ''[[Vindobona|Vindobonensis]]'' manuscript MS. 3416, together with the [[Chronography of 354]]. They were previously known as ''Anonymus Cuspiniani'', since they were published by [[Johannes Cuspinianus]] in 1553, and are part of the ''[[Consularia Italica]]'' collection.

The first collection is entitled '''''Fasti vindobonenses priores''''' and covers the periods 44 BC – AD 403 and 455 – 493. The second is called '''''Fasti vindobonenses posteriores''''' and covers the period 44 BC – AD 397, 439 – 455 and 495 – 539.

Later additions were included for years 390 – 473 in a copy conserved in the ''Sangallensis'' MS. 878.

'''FindAnyFilm''' is an online film search service, which aggregates film and film availability information into one place. Users are able to find [[movies]] based on search terms including titles, [[actors]], genres, or cinema names.

It was launched on 28 January 2009, by the [[UK Film Council]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukfilmcouncil.org.uk/news?show=15134&amp;page=1&amp;step=10 "Film fans lives revolutionised with launch of new site FindAnyFilm.com by UK Film Council" press release]&lt;/ref&gt; the UK Government backed lead agency for film in the [[UK]] which ensures that the economic, cultural and educational aspects of film are effectively represented at home and abroad. The site’s aims include raising the awareness of and promoting the use of legal mediums for viewing films&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/scienceandtechnology/technology/4582014/FindAnyFilm-hopes-to-expand-the-horizons-of-movie-goers.html Telegraph: FindAnyFilm hopes to expand the horizons of movie-goers]&lt;/ref&gt; – working towards the eradication of [[Copyright infringement|piracy]].
Details of over 30,000 individual film records are held on the site. It targets film fans in the UK, but holds details on films made in over 60 different languages – ranging from [[English language|English]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Hindi]], [[Arabic]], [[French language|French]] and [[Cantonese]].

Visitors to the site can search for a film they would like to see, and then choose their preferred viewing medium including [[DVD]], [[Blu-ray]], [[cinemas]], via legal [[downloads]], and through seven days of forthcoming [[television]] listings. 

Film listings are segmented into 20 genres (including [[Action film|action]], [[World Cinema|foreign]], [[classic]], [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]], [[bollywood]] and [[drama]]), and users can also search by requesting a mood, location or using a phrase such as ‘fairy tale ending’.

The '''Florida Photographic Collection''' is a nationally recognized component of the [[State Archives of Florida]] and contains over a million images, and over 6,000 movies and [[video tapes]]. Over 200,000 of the photographs are available through the [[Florida Memory Program]] web site.

"Featuring over 200,000 digitized photographs from the State Archives of Florida, the Florida Photographic Collection is the most complete online portrait of Florida available--one that draws its strength from family pictures, the homes of Floridians, their work, and their pastimes." &lt;ref name="Florida Photographic Collection"&gt;{{cite web

The collection spans a wide range of visual images from copies of mid 15th century maps to current photographs. Topics of note are rocket launches from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Canaveral]], [[Land Speed Record]] attempts on [[Daytona Beach]] and a vast number on holidaymaking.

Representatives from the [[de facto]] [[Roberto Micheletti|Micheletti]] government and deposed [[President of Honduras|President]] [[Manuel Zelaya]] reached the agreement after several weeks of diplomatic [[dialogue]] in late 2009.

== Dialogue ==
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}

The Guaymuras dialogue began after the failure of the [[San José accord]] to achieve a diplomatic solution to the [[2009 Honduran constitutional crisis]].  The dialogue involved representatives from both Roberto Michelleti and Manuel Zelaya,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB20001424052748703746604574461110907147706 |work=The Wall Street Journal |first=Lanny J. |last=Davis |title=A New Solution For Honduras |date=2009-10-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109223413/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB20001424052748703746604574461110907147706.html |archivedate=November 9, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was facilitated initially by [[Oscar Arias]].

== Agreement ==

On 30 October 2009, the [[Organization of American States]] announced that representatives from both Micheletti and Zelaya had reached an agreement that would place the decision to restore Zelaya to the presidency in the hands of the National Congress.&lt;ref name="“OAS Announces Agreement"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20091030/ap_on_re_la_am_ca/lt_honduras_coup |title=Honduras' ousted president, government sign pact |date=2009-10-30 |publisher=AP via Yahoo News |accessdate=2009-10-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091101051553/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20091030/ap_on_re_la_am_ca/lt_honduras_coup |archivedate=November 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The content and image of the signed accord was released to the public.&lt;ref name = "GuaymurasFirmado"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://docs.google.com/fileview?id=0B08-H8hU7cI_YjhhY2EzZWQtOGU4Zi00ZjQyLThjOGItNzlhNmQ2ODExMzYw&amp;hl=en | title = GuaymurasFirmado | date = 2009-10-30 | accessdate=2009-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Diálogo Guaymuras"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.latribuna.hn/web2.0/?p=57987&amp;cpage=1 | title = Diálogo Guaymuras | date = 2009-10-31 | publisher = LaTribuna.hn | accessdate = 2009-10-31 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100902203139/http://www.latribuna.hn/web2.0/?p=57987 | archivedate = 2010-09-02 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Text of Agreement==

'''Preamble'''

We,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tiempo.hn/secciones/crisis-politica/6635-el-proximo-jueves-debe-estar-formado-el-gobierno-de-unidad |language=es |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091103072813/http://www.tiempo.hn/secciones/crisis-politica/6635-el-proximo-jueves-debe-estar-formado-el-gobierno-de-unidad |archivedate=November 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hondurascoup2009.blogspot.com/2009/10/tegucigalpa-san-jose-accord-translation.html translation used is from this source checked to original Spanish]&lt;/ref&gt; Honduran citizens, men and women convinced of the necessity to strengthen the state of law, to aid our constitution and the laws of our Republic, deepen democracy and assure a climate of peace and tranquility for our people, have carried out a frank and intense process of political dialogue to seek a negotiated and peaceful exit to the crisis in which our country has been submerged in recent months.

As fruit of this dialogue in which has predominated the wisdom, tolerance, and patriotic spirit of all the participants, we have drafted a political accord that will permit the reestablishment of civic harmony and assure a proper climate for democratic governability in our country. This accord, we are sure, will define the road to peace, reconciliation, and democracy, urgent demands of Honduran society.

The agreement on this accord demonstrates yet again, that Honduran men and women are capable of successfully carrying out dialogue and thanks to that and by means of it, reach the high goals that society demands and the country requires.

In virtue of the forgoing, we have agreed on the following accords:

===The Government of National Reconciliation and Unity===

To achieve reconciliation and strengthen democracy, we will form a Government of Unity and National Reconciliation made up of representatives of the various political parties and social organizations, recognized for their capabilities, honesty, aptness, and willingness to dialogue, who will occupy the distinct secretariates and subsecretariates, as well as other dependencies of State, in conformity with article 246 and following of the constitution of the Republic of Honduras.

In light of the fact that before the 28 of June, the Executive Power had not submitted a General Budget of Income and Expenses for consideration to the National Congress, in conformity with that established in article 205, number 32 of the Constitution of the Republic of Honduras, this government of unity and national reconciliation will respect and function on the basis of the general budget, recently approved by the National Congress for fiscal year 2009.

===Renouncing the convocation of a National Constituent Assembly or reforming the unreformable articles of the Constitution.===

To achieve reconciliation and fortify democracy, we reiterate our respect for the Constitution and the laws of our country, abstaining from making calls for the convening of a National Constituent Assembly, in direct or indirect manner and renouncing also promoting or aiding any popular poll with the goal of reforming the Constitution in order to permit presidential re-election, modify the form of government or contravene any of the irreformable articles of our Magna Carta.

In particular, we will not make public declarations nor exercise any type of influence inconsistent with articles 5; 373 and 373 [sic: 374?] of the Constitution of the Republic of Honduras, and we reject energetically every manifestation contrary to the spirit of said articles and of the special law that regulates the referendum and the plebiscite.

===The General Elections and the transfer of Government===

To achieve reconciliation and fortify democracy, we reiterate that, in conformity with the articles 44 and 51 of the Constitution of the Republic of Honduras, the vote is universal, obligatory, egalitarion, direct, free and secret, and it corresponds to the Supreme Electoral Tribunal, with full autonomy and independence, to supervise and execute everything related to the electoral acts and processes.

At the same time, we make a call to the Honduran people to peacefully participate in the next general elections and to avoid all kinds of demonstrations that would oppose the elections or their results, or promote insurrection, antijuridical conduct, civil disobedience or other acts that could produce violent confrontations or transgressions of the law.

With the goal of demonstrating the transparency and legitimacy of the electoral process, we ask urgently that the Supreme Electoral Tribunal that it authorize and accredit the presence of international missions from now until the declaration of the results of the general elections, as well as the transfer of powers that will take place, in conformity with Article 237 of the Constitution of the Republic, the 27 of January 2010.

===The Armed Forces and National Police===

To reach reconciliation and fortify democracy, we affirm our will to comply in all its measures with article 272 of the Constitution of the Republic of Honduras, according to which the Armed Forces remain at the disposition of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal from one month before the general elections, for the purpose of guaranteeing the free exercise of suffrage, the custody, transparency, and guarding of the electoral materials and all the other aspects of security of the process. We reaffirm the professional, apolitical, obedient and non-deliberative character of the Honduran Armed Forces. In the same way, we agree that the national police should be strictly subject to that prescribed in its special legislation.

===Executive Power===

To achieve reconciliation and fortify democracy, in the spirit of the themes of the proposed San Jose Accord, both negotiating commissions have decided, respectfully, that the National Congress, as an institutional expression of popular sovereignty, in the use of its powers, in consultation with the points that the Supreme Court of Justice should consider pertinent and in conformity with the law, should resolve in that proceeding in respect to "return the incumbency of Executive Power to its state previous to the 28 of June until the conclusion of the present governmental period, the 27 of January of 2010". The decision that the National Congress adopts should lay the foundations to achieve social peace, political tranquility and governability that society demands and the country needs".

===The Verification Commission and the Truth Commission===

To achieve reconciliation and fortify democracy, we are disposed to the creation of a Commission of Verification of the promises assumed in this Accord, and of those that shall derive from it, coordinated by the Organization of American States (OAS). Said commission will be made up of two members of the international community and two members of the national community, these last will be sought one by each of the parties.

The Verification Commission will be charged with giving witness of the strict completion of all of the points of this Accord, and will receive for this the full cooperation of Honduran public institutions.
Incompletion of any of the commitments contained in this Accord, proven and declared by the Verification Commission, will produce the activation of measures that the Commission will establish against the transgressor or transgressors.

With the goal of clarifying the deeds that occurred before and after the 28 of June 2009, there will also be created a Truth Commission that will identify the acts that led to the present situation, and provide to the Honduran people elements to avoid that those deeds will be repeated in the future.
This Commission of Dialogue recommends that the next Government, in the framework of a national consensus, constitutes the said Truth Commission in the first half of the year 2010.

===The normalisation of relations of the Republic of Honduras with the International Community===

On committing ourselves to faithfully comply with the promises assumed in the present Accord, we respectfully ask the immediate revocation of those measures and sanctions adopted at a bilateral or multilateral level, that in any manner would affect the reinsertion and full participation of the Republic of Honduras in the international community and its access to all forms of cooperation.

We make a call to the international community that it should reactivate as soon as possible the projects of cooperation in effect with the Republic of Honduras and continue with the negotiation of future ones. In particular, we ask urgently that, on the request of competent authorities the international cooperation be made effective that might be necessary and opportune for the Verification Commission and the future Truth Commission to assure the faithful completion and follow-through of the commitments acquired in this Accord.

===Final Dispositions===

Any difference in interpretation or application of the present Accord will be submitted to the Verification Commission, which will determine, in keeping with that disposed in the Constitution of the Republic of Honduras and in the legislation in effect and through an authentic interpretation of the present Accord, the solution that corresponds.

Taking into account that the present Accord is a product of the understanding and fraternity among Honduran men and women, we ask vehemently that the international community respect the sovereignty of the Republic of Honduras, and fully observe the time-honored principle in the Charter of the United Nations of non-interference in the internal affairs of other States.

===Calendar of completion of the Accords===

Given the immediate entrance into effect of this accord from the date of its signing, and with the goal of clarifying the timetable for completion and follow-through of the commitments acquired to reach national reconciliation, we agree on the following calendar of completion:

*30 of October 2009
1. Signing and entry into effect of the accord.
2. Formal delivery of the accords to Congress for the effects of point 5, of "Executive Power".

*First half of 2010

===Final Declaration===

In the name of reconciliation and the patriotic spirit that has convened us at the table of dialogue, we commit to complete in good faith the present Accord and that which derives from it.

The world is witness to that demonstration of unity and peace, to which we commit our civic conscience, and patriotic devotation. Together, we shall know to demonstrate our valor and determination to fortify the State of Law and construct a tolerant, pluralistic, and democratic society.

We sign the present Accord in the city of Tegucigalpa, Honduras, the 30th of October 2009.

===Acknowledgement===

We take advantage of the occasion to thank the accompaniment of the good offices of the international community, in particular the OAS, and its Secretary General, Jose Miguel Insulza, the Missions of Chancellors of the Hemisphere; the President of Costa Rica, Oscar Arias Sanchez; the ultimate government of the United States, its president Barack Obama; and its Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton.

"By that day, point No. 5 has to be resolved," he added, referring to the clause of the agreement that covers his return to office.  In fact, the accord did not establish a firm deadline by which Congress has to make a final decision on Zelaya's reinstatement, [[Organization of American States]] Political Affairs Secretary [[Victor Rico]] noted following Zelaya's comments.

'''Hachette''' ({{IPA-fr|a.ʃɛt}}) is a [[France|French]] [[publishing|publisher]].

== History ==
It was founded in 1826 by [[Louis Hachette]] as '''Brédif''', a bookshop and publishing company. It became '''L. Hachette et Compagnie''' on 1 January 1846, '''Librairie Hachette''' in 1919, and '''Hachette SA''' in 1977. It was acquired by the [[Lagardère Group]] in 1981. In 1992 the publishing assets of Hachette SA were grouped into a subsidiary called '''Hachette Livre''' ({{IPA-fr|a.ʃɛt liːvʁ}}), the flagship imprint of [[Lagardère Publishing]]. Hachette has its headquarters in the [[15th arrondissement of Paris|15th arrondissement]] of Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hachette.com/en/key-dates.html "Hachette Livre: Key Dates"]. Retrieved on 12 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996 it merged with the [[Hatier]] group. In 2004, Hachette acquired dictionary publisher [[Éditions Larousse]]. In 2006, it expanded into the United States when it purchased [[Time Warner]]'s book-publishing division, which was then renamed [[Hachette Book Group USA]]. In June 2013, Hachette announced that it would acquire [[Hyperion Books]] from [[The Walt Disney Company | Disney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-28/hachette-will-acquire-disney-s-hyperion-book-publishing-business.html|title=Hachette Will Acquire Disney’s Hyperion Book Publishing Business|author=Edmund Lee|date=28 June 2013|work=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the largest English-language publishers, known as the "[[Georg_von_Holtzbrinck_Publishing_Group#See_also|Big Five]]".

In 2018, it announced its ''Robinson Millenials'' label, under which it would be publishing [[webcomic]]s in partnership with [[Hiveworks Comics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Robinson, une nouvelle collection de bandes dessinées en partenariat avec Hiveworks|url=https://www.hachette.fr/actualites/robinson-une-nouvelle-collection-de-bandes-dessinees-en-partenariat-avec-hiveworks|website=hachette.fr|publisher=Hachette Livre|language=French|date=25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporate affairs==
Hachette has its headquarters in the [[Beaugrenelle]] district in the [[15th arrondissement of Paris|15th arrondissement]] of Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hachette.com/en/ Hachette Livre], Hachette.com. Retrieved 17 April 2011. "Hachette Livre 43, quai de Grenelle 75905 Paris Cedex 15"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Malakoff"&gt;{{cite web |last=Gary |first=Nicolas |url=http://www.actualitte.com/actualite/monde-edition/societe/hachette-migrera-des-services-de-sa-direction-a-malakoff-19048.htm |title=Hachette migrera des services de sa direction à Malakoff |website= actualitte.com |date= May 17, 2010 |accessdate= January 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hachette's head office previously occupied a building at the intersection of Saint-Germain and Saint-Michel in the [[Saint-Germain-des-Prés]] area. It later moved to its current location.&lt;ref&gt;Launet, Edouard. "[http://www.liberation.fr/culture/0101600620-pas-de-quartier-pour-les-editeurs Pas de quartier pour les éditeurs]." ''[[Libération]]''. 2 November 2009. Retrieved on 21 January 2012. "Chacun se souvient aussi du spectaculaire départ du groupe Hachette, abandonnant son énorme QG au coin des boulevards Saint-Michel et Saint-Germain pour le quai de Grenelle, dans le XVe."&lt;/ref&gt;

Hachette planned to lease {{convert|9900|sqm|sqft}} of space at a building in [[Malakoff]], [[Hauts de Seine]] around 2011, even though the building in the 15th arrondissement was being renovated.&lt;ref name="Malakoff"/&gt;

In June 2014, the company's U.S. affiliate in conjunction with [[Perseus Books Group]], and [[Ingram Content Group]], announced a three-way deal whereby Hachette would buy Perseus and then sell the company's client services businesses to Ingram. Financial details of the deal were not disclosed.&lt;ref name="HachettePerseus"&gt;{{cite news|title=Perseus Books Group being acquired by Hachette|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/63029-hbg-buying-perseus-ingram-to-get-distribution-biz.html|accessdate=20 September 2014|publisher=''Publishers Weekly''}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in August 2014, the deal was called off because Hachette and the other parties involved decided the deal was too complicated.&lt;ref name="HachettePerseusCancelled"&gt;{{cite news|title=Hachette Calls Off Perseus Book Purchase|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/hachette-calls-off-perseus-book-purchase-1407446685?mod=WSJ_GoogleNews|accessdate=9 August 2014|publisher=''Wall Street Journal''}}{{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deal eventually went through in April 2016 with Perseus's publishing assets and imprints going to Hachette, and distribution assets to Ingram.&lt;ref&gt;Natasha Onwuemezi, "Perseus sale to Hachette Book Group completed", ''The Bookseller'', [http://www.thebookseller.com/news/perseus-sale-hachette-book-group-confirmed-325625 1 April 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1843">'''''Harris v. Blockbuster, Inc.''''', 622 [[Federal Supplement|F. Supp. 2d]] 396 (N.D. Tex. Apr. 15, 2009)&lt;ref&gt;http://amlawdaily.typepad.com/Blockbusterdecision.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; established precedent in the district that 
when a contract has a clause that authorizes one party to make changes to the "contract" without notification, that it is illusory and hence the entire "contract" is void.

==Judgment==
On April 15, 2009, the District Court for the Northern District of Texas ruled that Blockbuster Online's Terms and Conditions were unenforceable because they gave Blockbuster too much discretion in modifying the terms of the agreement. Following the reasoning in a Fifth Circuit case, [[Morrison v. Amway Corp.]], and consistent with a Ninth Circuit case, ''[[Douglas v. US District Court ex rel Talk America]]''&lt;ref&gt;No. 06-75424 (9th Cir. July 18, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; the court found that Blockbuster's arbitration provision was illusory, because there was nothing in the Terms and Conditions that would prevent Blockbuster from "unilaterally changing any part of the contract."

==Significance==
Some websites' "terms and conditions" may be deemed an illusory contract and unenforceable if the language can be changed at any time by the company without notifying users and giving them a chance to reject the new changes.

The '''Indie Photobook Library''' is a collection of over 2,000 self-published and indie-published [[photo-book]]s that promotes, showcases, and preserves photobook formats like photography exhibition catalogs, print-on-demand photobooks, artist books, zines, photobooks printed on newsprint, limited edition photobooks, and non-English language photography books.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://lenscratch.com/2012/09/larissa-leclair-and-indie-photobook/|title=Larissa Leclair and the Indie Photobook Library|last=Smithson|first=Aline|date=2012-09-12|work=LENSCRATCH|access-date=2018-03-16|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.indiephotobooklibrary.org/about-the-ipl/|title=About the iPL|last=|first=|date=|website=Indie Photobook Library|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was acquired by the [[Beinecke Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library]] in 2016.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ai-ap.com/publications/article/19756/the-indie-photobook-library-moves-to-yale.html|title=The Indie Photobook Library Moves to Yale|last=Roalf|first=Peggy|date=November 18, 2016|work=DART: Design Arts Daily|access-date=2018-03-16|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Larissa Leclair started the collection in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://lenscratch.com/2012/09/larissa-leclair-and-indie-photobook/|title=Larissa Leclair and the Indie Photobook Library|date=2012-09-12|work=LENSCRATCH|access-date=2018-04-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first inspired by Leclair's frustration, in 2009, with not having a centralized place to find self-published photobooks. Prior to its acquisition by the Beinecke, Leclair regularly organized exhibits drawn from the collection,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/3793463/the-indie-photo-book-in-the-21st-century/|title=The Indie Photo Book in the 21st Century|last=Moakley|first=Paul|date=Nov 13, 2012|website=Time|language=en-us|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it has traveled within the U.S., and to Canada, Guatemala, China, Mexico, the Philippines, and Australia.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

The collection was closed to submissions in 2016, so serves as a unique snapshot of artistic self-publishing from around 2008 to 2016.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It also served as a center for advocacy for self-published photobooks during a time period that saw self-publishing rise as an important alternative to the large expensive photobooks produced by traditional publishing houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.printmag.com/imprint/the-photo-book-will-rise-again/|title=The Photo Book Will Rise Again|last=Rapp|first=Alan|date=July 2, 2010|work=Print (magazine)|access-date=March 16, 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 the collection was acquired by the [[Beinecke Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library]] at [[Yale University]], where it complements existing collections in the history of photography.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.yale.edu/2016/11/16/ipl-collection-adds-beinecke-s-strengths-photobooks-and-modern-trends-self-publishing|title=iPL collection adds to Beinecke’s strengths in photobooks and modern trends in self-publishing|last=Morand|first=Michael|date=2016-11-16|work=YaleNews|access-date=2018-03-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action''' ('''JCPOA'''; {{lang-fa|برنامه جامع اقدام مشترک |barnāmeye jāme'e eqdāme moshtarak}}, [[acronym]]: {{lang|fa|برجام}} '''BARJAM'''&lt;ref&gt;{{IPA-fa|bæɾˈdʒɒːm|pron}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tehrantimes.com/index_View.asp?code=248149 |title=Zarif: We've never claimed nuclear deal only favors Iran |work=[[Tehran Times]] |date=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;), known commonly as the '''Iran nuclear deal''' or '''Iran deal''', is an agreement on the [[nuclear program of Iran]] reached in [[Vienna]] on 14 July 2015 between [[Iran]], the [[P5+1]] (the five [[permanent members of the United Nations Security Council]]—[[China]], [[France]], [[Russia]], [[United Kingdom]], [[United States]]—plus [[Germany]]),{{efn|The P5+1 are also sometimes referred to as the "E3+3", for the "[[EU three]]" countries (France, the UK, and Germany) plus the three non-EU countries (the U.S., Russia, and China). The terms are interchangeable; this article uses the "P5+1" phrase.&lt;ref&gt;Joshua Keating, [https://foreignpolicy.com/2009/09/30/you-say-p51-i-say-e33/ "You say P5+1, I say E3+3"], ''Foreign Policy'' (30 September 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Lewis, [http://lewis.armscontrolwonk.com/archive/7773/e3eu3-or-p51 "E3/EU+3 or P5+1"], ''Arms Control Wonk'' (13 July 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;}} and the [[European Union]].

Formal negotiations toward the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action on Iran's nuclear program began with the adoption of the [[Joint Plan of Action]], an interim agreement signed between Iran and the P5+1 countries in November 2013. For the next twenty months, Iran and the P5+1 countries engaged in negotiations, and in April 2015 agreed on an [[Iran nuclear deal framework]] for the final agreement. In July 2015, Iran and the P5+1 confirmed agreement on the plan along with the "Roadmap Agreement" made between Iran and the IAEA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/945169931|title=Iran's nuclear program and international law : from confrontation to accord|last=Daniel,|first=Joyner,|isbn=9780190635718|edition=First|location=New York, NY|oclc=945169931}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the agreement, Iran agreed to eliminate its stockpile of medium-[[enriched uranium]], cut its stockpile of low-enriched uranium by 98%, and reduce by about two-thirds the number of its [[gas centrifuge]]s for 13 years. For the next 15 years, Iran will only enrich uranium up to 3.67%. Iran also agreed not to build any new [[pressurized heavy-water reactor|heavy-water facilities]] for the same period of time. Uranium-enrichment activities will be limited to a single facility using first-generation centrifuges for 10 years. Other facilities will be converted to avoid [[Nuclear proliferation|proliferation]] risks. To monitor and verify Iran's compliance with the agreement, the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) will have regular access to all Iranian nuclear facilities. The agreement provides that in return for verifiably abiding by its commitments, Iran will receive relief from U.S., European Union, and [[United Nations Security Council]] nuclear-related economic [[Sanctions against Iran|sanctions]].

On 13 October 2017, U.S. President Donald Trump announced that the United States would not make the certification provided for under [[Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015|U.S. domestic law]], but stopped short of terminating the deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heavy.com/news/2017/10/trump-iran-live-stream-strategy-nuclear-deal/|title=LIVE STREAM: President Trump Announces Iran Nuclear Deal Strategy|first=Chris|last=Bucher|date=13 October 2017|publisher=Heavy.com |accessdate=6 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 April 2018, the United States and Israel stated that Iran did not disclose a past [[Project Amad|covert nuclear weapons program]] to the IAEA, which was required in the 2015 deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-30/trump-hints-at-u-s-ending-iran-deal-after-netanyahu-speech|title=Trump Hints He Plans to Quit the Iran Nuclear Deal|date=2018-04-30|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2018-04-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/pm-expected-to-reveal-how-iran-cheated-world-on-nuke-program-1.6045495|title=Trump: Netanyahu's Speech on Iran Deal Proves That I Was 100% Right on Iran Deal|last=Tibon|first=Amir|date=2018-04-30|work=Haaretz|access-date=2018-04-30|last2=Landau|first2=Noa|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[IAEA]] inspectors spend 3,000 calendar days per year in Iran, installing tamper-proof seals and collecting surveillance camera photos, measurement data and documents for further analysis. IAEA Director Yukiya Amano stated (in March 2018) that the organization has verified that Iran is implementing its nuclear-related commitments.&lt;ref&gt;Amano, Yukia (5 March 2018).

==Background==
{{see also|Nuclear program of Iran|Nuclear proliferation}}
A [[nuclear weapon]] uses a [[fissile material]] to cause a [[nuclear chain reaction]]. The most commonly used materials have been [[uranium 235]] (U-235) and [[plutonium 239]] (Pu-239). Both [[uranium 233]] (U-233) and [[reactor-grade plutonium]] have also been used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Holdren |first=John |author2=Matthew Bunn |title=Managing Military Uranium and Plutonium in the United States and the Former Soviet Union |journal=Annual Review of Energy and the Environment |year=1997 |volume=22 |pages=403–496 |doi=10.1146/annurev.energy.22.1.403 |url=http://belfercenter.hks.harvard.edu/files/mmup.pdf |accessdate=29 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ynUBAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA26 |last=Barnaby |first=Frank |editor=Barnaby |editor2=Douglas Holdstock |title=Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Retrospect and Prospect |page=25 |isbn=9781135209933 |date=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BelferManaging&gt;{{cite web |url=http://belfercenter.hks.harvard.edu/files/mmup.pdf |title=Managing military uranium and plutonium in the United States and the Former Soviet Union |author=Matthew Bunn |author2=John P. Holdren |pages=403–409}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of uranium or plutonium needed depends on the sophistication of the design, with a simple design requiring approximately 15&amp;nbsp;kg of uranium or 6&amp;nbsp;kg of plutonium and a sophisticated design requiring as little as 9&amp;nbsp;kg of uranium or 2&amp;nbsp;kg of plutonium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucsusa.org/nuclear-weapons/nuclear-terrorism/fissile-materials-basics |title=Weapon Materials Basics (2009) |author=Union of Concerned Scientists}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plutonium is almost nonexistent in nature, and natural uranium is about 99.3% [[uranium 238]] (U-238) and 0.7% U-235. Therefore, to make a weapon, either uranium must be [[uranium enrichment|enriched]], or plutonium must be produced. Uranium enrichment is also frequently necessary for [[nuclear power]]. For this reason, uranium enrichment is a [[dual-use technology]], a technology which "can be used both for civilian and for military purposes".&lt;ref name="Schneider &amp; Thränert"&gt;Jonas Schneider &amp; Oliver Thränert, [http://www.css.ethz.ch/publications/pdfs/CSSAnalyse151-EN.pdf Dual Use: Dealing with Uranium Enrichment], ''CSS Analyses in Security Policy'', No. 151 (April 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; Key strategies to prevent [[nuclear proliferation|proliferation of nuclear arms]] include limiting the number of operating uranium enrichment plants and controlling the export of [[nuclear technology]] and [[fissile material]].&lt;ref name=BelferManaging/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schneider &amp; Thränert"/&gt;

Iranian development of [[nuclear technology]] began in the 1970s, when the U.S. [[Atoms for Peace]] program began providing assistance to [[Iran]], which was then led by the [[Shah of Iran|Shah]].&lt;ref name="NTI"&gt;[http://www.nti.org/country-profiles/iran/nuclear/ "Country Profiles: Iran: Nuclear"], [[Nuclear Threat Initiative]] (last updated July 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Iran signed the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons]] (NPT) in 1968 as a non-nuclear weapons state and ratified the NPT in 1970.&lt;ref name="NTI"/&gt;

In 1979 the [[Iranian Revolution]] took place, and Iran's nuclear program, which had developed some baseline capacity, fell to disarray as "much of Iran's nuclear talent fled the country in the wake of the Revolution."&lt;ref name="NTI"/&gt; Ayatollah [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] was initially opposed to nuclear technology; and Iran engaged in a [[Iran–Iraq War|costly war with Iraq]] from 1980 to 1988.&lt;ref name="NTI"/&gt;

Starting in the later 1980s, Iran restarted its nuclear program, with [[Pakistan and weapons of mass destruction|assistance from Pakistan]] (which entered into a [[Iran–Pakistan relations|bilateral agreement with Iran]] in 1992), China (which did the same in 1990), and Russia (which did the same in 1992 and 1995), and from the [[Abdul Qadeer Khan|A.Q. Khan]] network.&lt;ref name="NTI"/&gt; Iran "began pursuing an indigenous [[nuclear fuel cycle]] capability by developing a uranium mining infrastructure and experimenting with uranium conversion and enrichment".&lt;ref name="NTI"/&gt; According to the nonpartisan [[Nuclear Threat Initiative]], "[[United States Intelligence Community|U.S. intelligence agencies]] have long suspected Iran of using its civilian nuclear program as a cover for clandestine weapons development."&lt;ref name="NTI"/&gt; Iran, in contrast, "has always insisted that its nuclear work is peaceful".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-33518524 Iran nuclear talks: 'Historic' agreement struck], BBC News (14 July 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2002, the Paris-based [[National Council of Resistance of Iran]], an Iranian dissident group, publicly revealed the existence of two undeclared nuclear facilities, the [[Arak, Iran|Arak]] heavy-water production facility and the [[Natanz]] enrichment facility.&lt;ref name="NTI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GuardianTimeline"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/02/iran-nuclear-talks-timeline "Iran nuclear talks: timeline"], ''The Guardian'' (14 July 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2003, Iranian President [[Mohammad Khatami]] acknowledged the existence of the facilities and asserted that Iran had undertaken "small-scale enrichment experiments" to produce low-enriched uranium for nuclear power plants.&lt;ref name="NTI"/&gt; In late February, [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) inspectors visited Natanz.&lt;ref name="GuardianTimeline"/&gt; In May 2003, Iran allowed IAEA inspectors to visit the Kalaye Electric Company, but refused to allow them to take samples, and an IAEA report the following month concluded that Iran had failed to meet its obligations under the previous agreement.&lt;ref name="GuardianTimeline"/&gt;

In June 2003, Iran—faced with the prospect of being referred to the [[UN Security Council]]—entered into diplomatic negotiations with France, Germany, and the United Kingdom (the EU 3).&lt;ref name="NTI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GuardianTimeline"/&gt; The United States refused to be involved in these negotiations.&lt;ref name="GuardianTimeline"/&gt; In October 2003, the Tehran Declaration was reached between Iran and the EU 3; under this declaration Iran agreed to cooperate fully with the IAEA, sign the Additional Protocol, and temporarily suspend all uranium enrichment.&lt;ref name="NTI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GuardianTimeline"/&gt; In September and October 2003, the IAEA conducted several facility inspections.&lt;ref name="NTI"/&gt; This was followed by the Paris Agreement in November 2004, in which Iran agreed to temporarily suspend enrichment and conversion activities, "including the manufacture, installation, testing, and operation of centrifuges, and committed to working with the EU-3 to find a mutually beneficial long-term diplomatic solution".&lt;ref name="NTI"/&gt;

In August 2005, [[Iranian presidential election, 2005|Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], a hard-liner, was elected [[president of Iran]]. He accused Iranian negotiators who had negotiated the Paris Accords of treason.&lt;ref name="GuardianTimeline"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hadley&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2010/11/iran-primer-the-george-w-bush-administration.html |title=Iran Primer: The George W. Bush Administration |author=Hadley, Stephen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next two months, the EU 3 agreement fell apart as talks over the EU 3's proposed Long Term Agreement broke down; the Iranian government "felt that the proposal was heavy on demands, light on incentives, did not incorporate Iran's proposals, and violated the Paris Agreement".&lt;ref name="NTI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GuardianTimeline"/&gt; Iran notified the IAEA that it would resume uranium conversion at [[Esfahan]].&lt;ref name="NTI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GuardianTimeline"/&gt;

In February 2006, Iran ended its voluntary implementation of the Additional Protocol and resumed enrichment at Natanz, prompting the IAEA Board of Governors to refer Iran to the UN Security Council.&lt;ref name="NTI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GuardianTimeline"/&gt; After the vote, Iran announced it would resume enrichment of uranium.&lt;ref name="GuardianTimeline"/&gt; In April 2006, Ahmadinejad announced that Iran had nuclear technology, but stated that it was purely for power generation and not for producing weapons.&lt;ref name="GuardianTimeline"/&gt; In June 2006, the EU 3 joined China, Russia, and the United States, to form the P5+1.&lt;ref name="GuardianTimeline"/&gt; The following month, July 2006, the UN Security Council passed its first resolution demanding Iran stop uranium enrichment and processing.&lt;ref name="GuardianTimeline"/&gt; Altogether, from 2006 to 2010, the UN Security Council subsequently adopted six resolutions concerning Iran's nuclear program: 1696 (July 2006), 1737 (December 2006), 1747 (March 2007), 1803 (March 2008), 1835 (September 2008), and 1929 (June 2010).&lt;ref name="CRS2015report"/&gt; The legal authority for the IAEA Board of Governors referral and the Security Council resolutions was derived from the IAEA Statute and the [[United Nations Charter]].&lt;ref name="CRS2015report"/&gt; The resolutions demanded that Iran cease enrichment activities and imposed sanctions on Iran, including bans on the transfer of nuclear and missile technology to the country and freezes on the assets of certain Iranian individuals and entities, in order to pressure the country.&lt;ref name="NTI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GuardianTimeline"/&gt; However, in Resolution 1803 and elsewhere the Security Council also acknowledged Iran's rights under Article IV of the NPT, which provides for "the inalienable right ... to develop research, production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes".&lt;ref name="CRS2015report"&gt;Paul K.

Beeman]] of the University of Minnesota, as well as [[Henry D. Sokolski]], executive director of the [[Nonproliferation Policy Education Center]], agree with this interpretation of the NPT.&lt;ref name="Beeman"/&gt; The U.S. position was unclear before 2006, but after that time the U.S. has taken the position that Iran does not have the right to uranium enrichment because this activity is not specifically cited in the NPT.&lt;ref name="DahlNPT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Beeman"/&gt; In testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in October 2013, Sherman stated, "the U.S. position that that article IV of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty does not speak about the right of enrichment at all [and] doesn't speak to enrichment, period. It simply says that you have the right to research and development. And many countries such as Japan and Germany have taken that [uranium enrichment] to be a right. But the United States does not take that position. ... We do not believe there is an inherent right by anyone to enrichment."&lt;ref name="Beeman"/&gt; The U.S. officials has also made the additional argument that whatever Iran's rights under the NPT might be, they were superseded by a series of UN Security Council resolutions demanding "that Iran suspend enrichment and reprocessing activities until 'confidence is restored in the purely peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear program.'"&lt;ref name="DahlNPT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Samore"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Beeman"/&gt; U.S. Secretary of State Kerry has said: "We do not recognize a right to enrich. It is clear ... in the nonproliferation treaty, it's very, very (clear) that there is no right to enrich. [The Iranians] have the ability to negotiate it, but they could only gain that capacity to have some enrichment as some countries do, if they live up to the whole set of terms necessary to prove its (sic) a peaceful program."&lt;ref name="Politi"/&gt; In March 2011 testimony before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, then-U.S. Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] expressed a similar position, indicating that Iran should be permitted to enrich uranium under IAEA supervision once the international concerns over its nuclear program are resolved.&lt;ref name="Davenport"/&gt;}}

In July 2006, Iran opened the Arak heavy water production plant, which led to one of the Security Council resolutions.&lt;ref name="NTI"/&gt; In September 2009, U.S. President Barack Obama, revealed the existence of an underground enrichment facility in Fordow, near [[Qom]] saying, "Iran's decision to build yet another nuclear facility without notifying the IAEA represents a direct challenge to the basic compact at the center of the non-proliferation regime."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2009/09/25/a-growing-concern-iran-refusing-live-those-international-responsibilities |title=A Growing Concern that Iran is Refusing to Live Up to Those International Responsibilities}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israel threatened to take military action against Iran.&lt;ref name="GuardianTimeline"/&gt;

In a February 2007 interview with the ''[[Financial Times]]'', IAEA director general [[Mohamed ElBaradei]] said that military action against Iran "would be catastrophic, counterproductive" and called for negotiations between the international community and Iran over the Iranian nuclear program.&lt;ref name="Dombey"&gt;Daniel Dombey, [https://web.archive.org/web/20140904220229/http://www.iaea.org/newscenter/transcripts/2007/ft190207.html Transcript of the Director General's Interview on Iran and DPRK], ''Financial Times'' (19 February 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; ElBaradei specifically proposed a "double, simultaneous suspension, a time out" as "a confidence-building measure", under which the international sanctions would be suspended and Iran would suspend enrichment.&lt;ref name="Dombey"/&gt; ElBaradei also said, "if I look at it from a weapons perspective there are much more important issues to me than the suspension of [enrichment]," naming his top priorities as preventing Iran from "go[ing] to industrial capacity until the issues are settled"; building confidence, with "full inspection" involving Iranian adoption of the [[Additional Protocol]]; and "at all costs" preventing Iran from "moving out of the [treaty-based non-proliferation] system".&lt;ref name="Dombey"/&gt;

A November 2007 U.S. [[National Intelligence Estimate]] assessed that Iran "halted its nuclear weapons program" in 2003; that estimate and subsequent U.S. Intelligence Community statements also assessed that the Iranian government at the time had was "keeping open the 'option' to develop nuclear weapons" in the future.&lt;ref name="CRS Report"&gt;Kenneth Katzman &amp; Paul K. Kerr, [https://fas.org/sgp/crs/nuke/R43333.pdf "Report: Iran Nuclear Agreement"], [[Congressional Research Service]] (30 July 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; A July 2015 [[Congressional Research Service]] report said, "statements from the U.S. intelligence community indicate that Iran has the technological and industrial capacity to produce nuclear weapons at some point, but the U.S. government assesses that Tehran has not mastered all of the necessary technologies for building a nuclear weapon."&lt;ref name="CRS Report"/&gt;

However, in a 2006 nuclear negotiation with European powers, Rouhani said that Iran had used the negotiations to dupe the Europeans, saying that during the negotiations, Iran managed to master the conversion of uranium [[yellowcake]] at Isfahan.

After several rounds of negotiations, on 24 November 2013, the [[Joint Plan of Action]], an interim agreement on the Iranian nuclear program, was signed between Iran and the P5+1 countries in [[Geneva]], Switzerland.

[[File:P5+1 Ministers With Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif in Vienna.jpg|thumb|Foreign Ministers from the P5+1 nations, the European Union, and Iran in [[Vienna]], Austria, on November 24, 2014]]
The agreement between the P5+1+EU and Iran on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) is the culmination of 20 months of "arduous" negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;Jethro Mullen &amp; Nic Robertson, [http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/14/politics/iran-nuclear-deal/ "Landmark deal reached on Iran nuclear program"], CNN (14 July 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gordon"&gt;Michael R.

The agreement followed the [[Joint Plan of Action]] (JPA), an interim agreement between the P5+1 powers and Iran that was agreed to on 24 November 2013 at [[Geneva]]. The Geneva agreement was an interim deal,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/kerry-in-geneva-raising-hopes-for-historic-nuclear-deal-with-iran/2013/11/23/53e7bfe6-5430-11e3-9fe0-fd2ca728e67c_story.html "Iran, world powers reach historic nuclear deal"], ''The Washington Post''&lt;/ref&gt; in which Iran agreed to roll back parts of its nuclear program in exchange for relief from [[sanctions against Iran|some sanctions]].

An [[Iran nuclear deal framework]] was reached on 2 April 2015. Under this framework Iran agreed tentatively to accept restrictions on its nuclear program, all of which would last for at least a decade and some longer, and to submit to an increased intensity of [[Nuclear program of Iran#International Atomic Energy Agency|international inspections]] under a framework deal. These details were to be negotiated by the end of June 2015. The negotiations toward a Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action were extended several times until the final agreement, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, was finally reached on 14 July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Pamela Dockins |title=Iran Nuclear Talks Extended Until July 7 |url=http://www.voanews.com/content/zarif-rejoins-iran-nuclear-talks/2842656.html |publisher=Voice of America |date=30 June 2015 |accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Paul Richter |url=http://www.latimes.com/world/middleeast/la-fg-iran-nuclear-talks-extended-20150707-story.html |title=Iran nuclear talks extended again; Friday new deadline |date=7 July 2015 |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The JCPOA is based on the framework agreement from three months earlier.

Subsequently the negotiations between Iran and the P5+1 continued. In April 2015, a [[Iran nuclear deal framework|framework]] deal was reached at [[Lausanne]]. Intense marathon negotiations then continued, with the last session in [[Vienna]] at the [[Palais Coburg]] lasting for seventeen days.&lt;ref name="FinalDays"&gt;Karen DeYoung &amp; Carol Morello, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/long-days-and-short-tempers-the-path-to-a-final-nuclear-deal/2015/07/15/bb90235c-2b1d-11e5-bd33-395c05608059_story.html "The path to a final Iran nuclear deal: Long days and short tempers"], ''The Washington Post'' (15 July 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; At several points, negotiations appeared to be at risk of breaking down, but negotiators managed to come to agreement.&lt;ref name="FinalDays"/&gt; As the negotiators neared a deal, U.S. Secretary of State [[John Kerry]] directly asked Iranian Foreign Minister [[Mohammad Javad Zarif]] to confirm that he was "authorized to actually make a deal, not just by the [Iranian] president, but by the supreme leader?"&lt;ref name="FinalDays"/&gt; Zarif gave assurances that he was.&lt;ref name="FinalDays"/&gt;

Ultimately, on 14 July 2015, all parties agreed to a landmark comprehensive nuclear agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/07/14/politics/iran-nuclear-deal/index.html |title=Landmark deal reached on Iran nuclear program |author=Jethro Mullen and Nic Robertson, CNN |date=14 July 2015 |publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the announcement, shortly before 11:00 GMT, the agreement was released to the public.&lt;ref name="fulltext"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eeas.europa.eu/statements-eeas/2015/150714_01_en.htm |title=European Union&amp;nbsp; – EEAS (European External Action Service) – Joint statement by EU High Representative Federica Mogherini and Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif Vienna, 14 July 2015 |publisher=Europa (web portal)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final agreement's complexity shows the impact of a public letter written by a bipartisan group of 19 U.S. diplomats, experts, and others in June 2015, written when negotiations were still going on.&lt;ref name="BroadLetter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JuneLetter"&gt;[http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/public-statement-on-u.s.-policy-toward-the-iran-nuclear-negotiations "Public Statement on U.S. Policy Toward the Iran Nuclear Negotiations Endorsed by a Bipartisan Group of American Diplomats, Legislators, Policymakers, and Experts"], Washington Institute for Near East Policy (24 June 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; That letter outlined concerns about the several provisions in the then-unfinished agreement and called for a number of improvements to strengthen the prospective agreement and win their support for it.&lt;ref name="BroadLetter"/&gt; After the final agreement was reached, one of the signatories, Robert J. Einhorn, a former U.S. Department of State official now at the [[Brookings Institution]], said of the agreement: "Analysts will be pleasantly surprised. The more things are agreed to, the less opportunity there is for implementation difficulties later on."&lt;ref name="BroadLetter"/&gt;

The final agreement is based upon (and buttresses) "the rules-based nonproliferation regime created by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and including especially the [[IAEA safeguards]] system".&lt;ref name="Carnegie"&gt;George Perkovich, Mark Hibbs, James M.

On 19 August 2015, the Associated Press reported that an [[Anonymous source|anonymous]] official had given the AP an unsigned, preliminary draft of one of the confidential bilateral IAEA-Iran agreements.

The following day, IAEA Director General [[Yukiya Amano]] issued a statement stating: "I am disturbed by statements suggesting that the IAEA has given responsibility for nuclear inspections to Iran. Such statements misrepresent the way in which we will undertake this important verification work ... the arrangements are technically sound and consistent with our long-established practices. They do not compromise our [[IAEA safeguards|safeguards standards]] in any way.

According to former IAEA officials, this is an established procedure. Such swipe samples collected at suspect sites under managed access would likely be divided into six packages: three are taken by the IAEA for analysis at its Seibersdorf Analytical Lab and two to be sent to the IAEA's Network of Analytical Labs (NWAL), which comprises some 16 labs in different countries, and another package to be kept under joint IAEA and Iran seal at the IAEA office in Iran a backup and control sample if re-analysis might be required at a later stage. The process ensures the integrity of the inspection operation and the samples for all parties."&lt;ref&gt;Kelsey Davenport &amp; Daryl G.

Arms control expert Jeffrey Lewis of the [[Monterey Institute of International Studies]] stated that the procedures referred to in the AP report were consistent with expert practice: "There are precedents for just providing photos and videos. When [[South Africa and weapons of mass destruction|the South Africans disabled their nuclear test shaft]], they video-recorded it and sent the IAEA their video. I don't care who takes a swipe sample or who takes a photograph, so long as I know where and when it was taken, with very high confidence, and I know that it hasn't been tampered with."&lt;ref name="Fisher IAEA"/&gt; Lewis expressed the opinion that "the point of the leak was to make the IAEA agreement on Parchin sound as bad as possible, and to generate political attention in Washington."&lt;ref name="Fisher IAEA"/&gt; On 21 September 2015, both the [[Associated Press]] and [[Reuters]] noted that under the arrangement between Iran and the IAEA, Iranian technicians, instead of the IAEA's experts, would take environmental samples.

** Specifically, the JCPOA establishes the following [[dispute resolution]] process: if a party to the JCPOA has reason to believe that another party is not upholding its commitments under the agreement, then the complaining party may refer its complaint to the Joint Commission, a body created under the JCPOA to monitor implementation.&lt;ref name="Key Excerpts"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Panda"&gt;Ankit Panda, [http://thediplomat.com/2015/07/how-the-iran-deals-snap-back-mechanism-will-keep-tehran-compliant/ "How the Iran Deal's 'Snap Back' Mechanism Will Keep Tehran Compliant"], ''The Diplomat'' (15 July 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; If a complaint made by a non-Iran party is not resolved to the satisfaction of the complaining party within thirty-five days of referral, then that party could treat the unresolved issue as grounds to cease performing its commitments under the JCPOA, notify the [[United Nations Security Council]] that it believes the issue constitutes significant non-performance, or both.&lt;ref name="Panda"/&gt; The Security Council would then have thirty days to adopt a resolution to continue the lifting of sanctions. If such a resolution is not adopted within those thirty days, then the sanctions of all of the pre-JCPOA nuclear-related UN Security Council resolutions would automatically be re-imposed. Iran has stated that in such a case, it would cease performing its nuclear obligations under the deal.&lt;ref name="fulltext"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Panda"/&gt; The effect of this rule is that any [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|permanent member of the Security Council]] (United States, United Kingdom, China, Russia and France) can veto any ongoing sanctions relief, but no member can veto the re-imposition of sanctions.
** Snapback sanctions "would not apply with retroactive effect to contracts signed between any party and Iran or Iranian individuals and entities prior to the date of application, provided that the activities contemplated under and execution of such contracts are consistent with this JCPOA and the previous and current UN Security Council resolutions".&lt;ref name="Kagan"/&gt;

Ankit Panda of ''[[The Diplomat]]'' states that this will make impossible any scenario where Iran is non-compliant with the JCPOA yet escapes re-imposition of sanctions.&lt;ref name="Panda"/&gt; Mark Dubowitz of the [[Foundation for Defense of Democracies]] (which opposes the agreement) argues, however, that because the JCPOA provides that Iran could treat reinstatement of sanctions (in part or entirely) as grounds for leaving the agreement, the United States would be reluctant to impose a "snapback" for smaller violations: "The only thing you'll take to the Security Council are massive Iranian violations, because you're certainly not going to risk the Iranians walking away from the deal and engaging in nuclear escalation over smaller violations."&lt;ref name=Dubowitz&gt;{{cite news |author=Jackie Northam |url=https://www.npr.org/2015/07/20/424571368/if-iran-violates-nuke-deal-a-look-at-how-sanctions-would-snap-back |title=A Look At How Sanctions Would 'Snap Back' If Iran Violates Nuke Deal |publisher=NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At that time, in 2030, it is understood that people involved in the 1979 revolution will no more be politically active.&lt;ref name="foreignaffairs" /&gt;

Some critics of the treaty consider as plausible that at its expiration Iran could make a bomb.&lt;ref name="foreignaffairs" /&gt;

In the same time, with this treaty Iran also ratified the Additional Protocol of the NPT and so, be subject to inspection and oversight by the IAEA after this delay.&lt;ref name="foreignaffairs" /&gt;

===Expert reactions===
Following the unveiling of the agreement, "a general consensus quickly emerged" among nuclear experts and watchdogs that the agreement "is as close to a best-case situation as reality would allow".&lt;ref name="MehtaOpall-Rome"&gt;Aaron Mehta &amp; Barbara Opall-Rome, [http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense/policy-budget/2015/07/18/experts-praise-iran-deal-despite-congressional-concerns/30261893/ "Experts Praise Iran Deal, Despite Congressional Concerns"], ''[[Defense News]]'' (18 July 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2015, 75 arms control and nuclear nonproliferation experts signed a statement endorsing the deal as "a net-plus for international nuclear nonproliferation efforts" that exceeds the historical standards for arms control agreements.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Crowley, [http://www.politico.com/story/2015/08/nuclear-experts-fall-in-behind-obama-iran-121459 "Nuclear experts fall in behind Obama: The deal with Iran exceeds historical standards for arms control agreements, 75 experts say"], ''Politico'' (18 August 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]]'' invited top international security experts to comment on the final agreement.&lt;ref name="Mecklin"&gt;John Mecklin, [http://thebulletin.org/experts-assess-iran-agreement-20158507 "The experts assess the Iran agreement of 2015"], ''Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists'' (14 July 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Jeffrey Lewis (academic)|Jeffrey Lewis]], arms control expert and director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the [[Monterey Institute of International Studies]], reviewed the final agreement and gave it a positive assessment, saying that he would give it an "A" grade.&lt;ref name="Fisher"&gt;Max Fisher, [https://www.vox.com/2015/7/15/8967147/iran-nuclear-deal-jeffrey-lewis "'I would give it an A': Why nuclear experts love the Iran deal"], Vox (15 July 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; While Lewis was skeptical about the chances of a workable deal emerging in 2014, during the negotiations, Lewis said that the final agreement was "a good deal because it slows down [the Iranian] nuclear program ... And it puts monitoring and verification measures in place that mean if they try to build a bomb, we're very likely to find out, and to do so with enough time that we have options to do something about it. There's a verifiable gap between their bomb option and an actual bomb. That's why it's a good deal."&lt;ref name="Fisher" /&gt; Lewis said that the final agreement was very similar to the April 2015 framework agreement.&lt;ref name="Fisher" /&gt; Lewis does not believe that the agreement will fundamentally alter the U.S.-Iranian relationship, seeing the agreement instead as "a really straightforward measure to slow down an enrichment program that was going gangbusters".&lt;ref name="Fisher" /&gt;
* [[Lawrence Korb]] and Katherine Blakeley, senior fellow and policy analyst, respectively, at the [[Center for American Progress]], wrote that the agreement was "one of the most comprehensive and detailed nuclear arms agreements ever reached".&lt;ref name="Mecklin" /&gt; Korb and Blakeley wrote, "a good look at the three main legs of the agreement shows that this deal is, in fact, a good one, for the United States and for the international community."&lt;ref name="Mecklin" /&gt; Korb and Blakey said that the agreement "precludes Iranian development of a nuclear weapon by shutting down all of the pathways Iran might use to accumulate enough nuclear material to make a weapon" and praised components of the agreement which keep Iran subject to the constraints of the [[Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty]], provides for robust IAEA monitoring and verification, and links the phased lifting of nuclear-related sanctions to IAEA verification of Iranian compliance.&lt;ref name="Mecklin" /&gt;
* [[Frank von Hippel]], senior research physicist and professor of public and international affairs emeritus at the Program on Science and Global Security at [[Princeton University]], wrote, "The July 14 agreement is a political miracle" in which "Iran has agreed to back away from the nuclear-weapon threshold in exchange for a lifting of nuclear-related sanctions."&lt;ref name="Mecklin" /&gt; Von Hippel wrote, "The Obama administration argues—and I agree—that the ratcheting back of Iran's enrichment capacity will give the world a much longer warning time should Iran attempt to build a bomb."&lt;ref name="Mecklin" /&gt; Von Hippel suggested that once the first ten years of the agreement were complete, "One option that should be explored is multinational ownership and management of Iran's enrichment complex by a group of countries—perhaps including the United States."&lt;ref name="Mecklin" /&gt;
* [[Frederick H. Fleitz]], former CIA nonproliferation analyst and currently of the [[Center for Security Policy]], wrote, "The provisions of this agreement ... contains minor concessions by Iran but huge concessions by the United States that will Iran to continue its nuclear program with weak verification provisions. Conditions for sanctions relief will be very easy for Iran to meet. Iran will not only continue to enrich uranium under the agreement, it will continue to develop advanced centrifuges that will reduce the timeline to an Iranian nuclear bomb."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/14/iran-nuclear-deal-much-worse-than-experts-predicted.html |title=Iran nuclear deal much worse than experts predicted |author=Fleitz, Fred}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* William H. Tobey, senior fellow at Harvard University's [[Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs]], was critical of the agreement, writing that given Iranian hostility to the United States and Israel, the agreement provides little "more than a speed bump on the path to Iran's nuclear ambition".&lt;ref name="Mecklin" /&gt; Tobey wrote that that "speed bump" is not "a good trade for at least $150 billion in sanctions relief".&lt;ref name="Mecklin" /&gt;
* Kingston Reif, director for disarmament and threat reduction policy at the [[Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation]], said that although the JCPOA is "not perfect", it "will be a net plus for nonproliferation and will enhance U.S. and regional security".&lt;ref name="Mecklin" /&gt; Reif wrote that it was "clear that Tehran had to retreat from many of its initial demands, including in the areas of the scale of uranium enrichment it needed, the intrusiveness of inspections it would tolerate, and the pace of sanctions relief it would demand".&lt;ref name="Mecklin" /&gt; Reif also wrote that the JCPOA "will keep Iran further away from the ability to make nuclear weapons for far longer than the alternative of additional sanctions or a military strike possibly could", and as a result, the threat of regional proliferation throughout the Middle East was diminished.&lt;ref name="Mecklin" /&gt; Reif added: "A perfect deal was not attainable. Overall, it's a very strong and good deal, but it wasn't negotiations that resulted in a score of 100-0 for the [United States]. That's not how international negotiations go. ... The monitoring and verification regime in this deal is the most comprehensive and intrusive regime that has ever been negotiated."&lt;ref name="MehtaOpall-Rome"/&gt;
* [[Siegfried S. Hecker]] of the [[Center for International Security and Cooperation]] at [[Stanford University]] wrote, "the Iran nuclear deal was hard-won and is better than any other reasonably achievable alternative."&lt;ref name="Mecklin" /&gt; Hecker wrote, "Iran agreed to considerably greater restrictions on its program than what I thought was possible."&lt;ref name="Mecklin" /&gt; Hecker's view is that it is "imperative that the international community develops a credible and decisive response in the event of an Iranian violation of the agreement".&lt;ref name="Mecklin" /&gt; He noted, "this agreement was one of the most technically informed diplomatic negotiations I have seen," with both sides advised by "world-class nuclear scientists": U.S. Secretary of State Kerry by U.S. Secretary of Energy Moniz, and Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif by [[Atomic Energy Organization of Iran]] chief [[Ali-Akbar Salehi]].&lt;ref name="Mecklin" /&gt;
* [[Zia Mian]] of the Program on Science &amp; Global Security at [[Princeton University]] wrote that the JCPOA offers three "important lessons for those wanting to make progress towards nuclear disarmament and a more peaceful world".&lt;ref name="Mecklin" /&gt; The first lesson was, "nuclear diplomacy can work. But it requires hard political work of many kinds"; Mian praised both the "creative technical and policy analysis work from within and outside governments to create options for negotiators to find common ground" as well as "the patient grassroots work to engage and mobilize public constituencies that brought to power leaders in the United States and in Iran willing to engage with each other and to take risks for a more peaceful relationship between their countries".&lt;ref name="Mecklin" /&gt; The second lesson was, "International nuclear politics is bound to domestic politics, for good and ill. The Iran agreement has come despite determined hostility from conservatives within the United States, Israel, Saudi Arabia, the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Gulf states]], and Iran. Seeing the world as a hierarchy shaped by power and fear, and locked in rigid, exclusivist national or religious identities, they press for advantage and privilege or to maintain the status quo. Sharing a propensity for mistrust, coercion, and violence, they would risk war with those they see as enemies rather than try dialogue and possible agreement on a peaceful future based on the ideals of equity and respect for others. These opponents will derail the Iran deal if they can."&lt;ref name="Mecklin" /&gt; The third lesson is, "nuclear disarmament issues do not exist in isolation"; Mian called for more foreign minister-level talks in the Middle East, rather than expanded U.S. military assistance in the region.&lt;ref name="Mecklin" /&gt;
* [[Ernest Moniz]], [[United States Secretary of Energy|U.S. Secretary of Energy]] and a nuclear physicist and former professor at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] who was a key member of the U.S. negotiating team, stated that the JCPOA helps put Iran further from a nuclear weapon not only in the first fifteen years, with "lots of very, very explicit constraints on the program that roll back current activities", but also beyond that period, because the agreement commits Iran to join the [[Additional Protocol]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/2015/07/15/423263262/u-s-energy-secretary-deal-keeps-iran-further-away-from-a-nuclear-weapon "U.S. Energy Secretary: Deal Keeps Iran Further Away From A Nuclear Weapon"], ''All Things Considered'', NPR (15 July 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kristina Peterson &amp; Amy Harder, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-nuclear-physicist-answering-lawmakers-questions-on-iran-deal-1437084084 "The Nuclear Physicist Answering Lawmakers' Questions on Iran Deal"], ''The Wall Street Journal'' (16 July 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Former IAEA Deputy Director [[Olli Heinonen]] and former Iraq weapons inspector David Albright expressed concerns with the length of a review process for inspecting undeclared facilities, stating that a delay up to a maximum of 24 days was too long.&lt;ref name="VerificationNYT"&gt;{{cite news |title=Verification Process in Iran Deal Is Questioned by Some Experts |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/23/world/middleeast/provision-in-iran-accord-is-challenged-by-some-nuclear-experts.html |author=Gordon, Michael |work=The New York Times |date=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heinonen said, "it is clear that a facility of sizable scale cannot simply be erased in three weeks' time without leaving traces," but said there was a risk that the Iranians could hide small-scale work, such as creating uranium components of a nuclear weapon, particularly because they have experience with cheating.&lt;ref name="VerificationNYT"/&gt; Albright said that activities on "a small scale", such as experiments with [[high explosive]]s or a small plant to make centrifuges operation could possibly be cleared out in 24 days.&lt;ref name="VerificationNYT"/&gt; Former U.S. State Department official Robert J. Einhorn, who took part in P5+1 nuclear talks with Iran from 2009 to 2013, said, "a limit shorter than 24 days would have been desirable," but "it is probably the case that the greater the significance of a covert activity, the more difficult it will be to remove evidence of it in 24 days."&lt;ref name="VerificationNYT"/&gt; U.S. Energy Department officials said that if the Iranians attempted to conduct centrifuge test, uranium conversion, or other activities, contamination would be generated that is very difficult to conceal.&lt;ref name="VerificationNYT"/&gt;
* At a September 2015 panel discussion at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA) with [[Albert Carnesale]] (a former [[SALT I]] negotiator), [[Dalia Dassa Kaye]] (of the RAND Corporation), and Aslı Bâli and Steven Spiegel of UCLA, the panelists came a general consensus that the JCPOA "should be given a chance to work" and "despite its flaws, the agreement was worth pursuing and that the alternative would have been no agreement at all."&lt;ref name="McInerny"&gt;Peggy McInerny, [http://www.international.ucla.edu/institute/article/156987 "Give nuclear agreement with Iran a chance, say experts"], UCLA International Institute (21 September 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Henner Fürtig]], a senior member of [[German Institute of Global and Area Studies]] and a professor at the [[University of Hamburg]] wrote that the accord contains multiple victories for all sides. It is a "triumph of international diplomacy" and "rarely reached consensus" for the United Nations and the UNSC, but "it is no panacea" resolving other conflicts in the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Henner |last=Fürtig |title=The Nuclear Agreement with Iran: Successful Settling of an International Crisis |url=https://giga.hamburg/en/system/files/publications/gf_international_1506.pdf |journal=GIGA Focus |publisher=German Institute of Global and Area Studies |issn=2196-3940 |number=6 |year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In popular culture===
The American TV series ''[[Madam Secretary (TV series)|Madam Secretary]]'' built a whole [[Madam Secretary (season 1)|season]] around the negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Robin |last=Wright |url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/madam-secretary-and-the-real-iran-deal |title="Madam Secretary" and the Real Iran Deal |work=The New Yorker |date=4 May 2015 |access-date=19 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five years before the deal, in ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]''{{'}}s [[24 (season 8)|season 8]], the negotiations between the United States leaders and "President Hassan" of ''Islamic republic of Kamistan'' to abandon his nuclear technology programme was shown, which drew comparison to the US-Iran dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=James |last=Reinl |url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/world/americas/un-finds-tv-show-too-hot-to-handle |title=UN finds TV show too hot to handle |work=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]] |date=7 February 2010|access-date=19 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the deal was contrarily to ''[[Homeland (TV series)|Homeland]]''{{'}}s [[Homeland (season 3)|season 3]] plot that "fueled nuclear paranoia" against Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=John |last=Hendel |url=http://theweek.com/articles/455575/how-obamas-iran-deal-screwed-homelands-third-season |title=How Obama's Iran deal screwed up Homeland's third season |work=The Week |date=26 November 2013|access-date=19 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the deal, a joke began circulating in Iran that the name of city of [[Arak, Iran|Arak]] would change to "Barack" in honor of Obama, and that in return, the United States would change the name of [[Manhattan]] borough to "''Mash Hassan''" ({{lang-fa|مش حسن}}) which is a very casual way of referring to Rouhani.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ali |last=Omidi |url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/11/iran-us-syria-direct-bilateral-talks.html |title=Will Rouhani and Zarif defy Khamenei by holding direct talks with US on Syria? |work=Al-Monitor |date=17 November 2015|access-date=1 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Javad Zarif]]'s efforts in the negotiations drew comparisons to mythological [[Arash the Archer]], and two former Prime Ministers: [[Mohammad Mosaddegh]], who led the withdrawal of foreigners and [[nationalization of the Iranian oil industry]] and was overthrown by [[1953 Iranian coup d'état|American–British coup d'état]], because both fought foreigners for Iran's rights; and [[Amir Kabir]], because both faced domestic hostility through their way to gain more interest for the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Arash |last=Karimi |url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/07/zarif-popular-foreign-minister-nuclear-deal.html |title=Zarif's domestic popularity soars with nuclear deal |work=Al-Monitor |date=14 July 2015|access-date=1 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* According to [[Vice President of Iran|First Vice President]] [[Eshaq Jahangiri]]'s interview on 6 August 2015, an Iranian government poll indicates that 80%-88% of Iranians support the Iran deal, whereas 4% oppose it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.entekhab.ir/fa/news/219000 |title=جهانگیری: مخالفان توافق هسته ای 4 درصد هستند، پس لحن طلبکارانه نداشته باشند و در حد همان 4 درصد حرف بزنند |publisher=Entekhab |author=Entekhab |date=6 August 2015 |accessdate=14 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A poll conducted 27 May to 29 May 2015, by private [[Virginia]]-based Information and Public Opinion Solutions LLC (iPOS), suggests that a 63% majority of Iranians favor a deal, with 12% conditional approval (they would support it only if certain advantages for Iran are contained within a final agreement). Answering "If Iran and the West reach a nuclear deal, do you agree or disagree (with) a normalization of relations between Iran and the US?", 52% agreed and 20% disagreed. The poll was conducted by phone with a random sample of 680 Iranians 18-years-old and older.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nationalinterest.org/feature/sorry-hardliners-iran-wants-nuclear-deal-13068 |title=Iran Wants a Nuclear Deal |publisher=[[The National Interest]] |author=Geneive Abdo |accessdate=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Germany====
* A July 2015 nationally representative survey of German adults conducted by YouGov Germany Omnibus found that overall, "63% of Germans support the deal to curb Iran's nuclear program, while only 18% oppose it and 20% don't know."&lt;ref name="JordanYouGov"/&gt;

As provided for in the JCPOA, the agreement was formally endorsed by the UN Security Council,&lt;ref name="Thomson"&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/iran-nuclear-deal-un-security-council-likely-to-vote-next-week-1.3152376 "Iran nuclear deal: UN Security Council likely to vote next week: US diplomats to promote deal to UN counterparts in coming days"], CBC, Thomson Reuters (15 July 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sengupta"&gt;Somini Sengupta, [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/16/world/consensus-gives-security-council-momentum-in-mideast-but-question-is-how-much.html Consensus Gives Security Council Momentum in Mideast, but Question Is How Much], ''The New York Times'' (16 July 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; incorporating it into [[Public international law|international law]].&lt;ref name="UNSCScheduled"&gt;CBS News/Associated Press, [http://www.cbsnews.com/news/un-security-council-vote-iran-nuclear-deal-resolution-us-congress-objections/ Iran deal set to become international law] (17 July 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UNSCRes"&gt;Somini Sengupta, [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/21/world/middleeast/security-council-following-iran-nuclear-pact-votes-to-lift-sanctions.html "U.N. Moves to Lift Sanctions on Iran After Nuclear Deal"], ''The New York Times'' (20 July 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; There was initially disagreement on if the deal is legally binding on the United States.{{efn|The extent to which the JCPOA is legally binding on the United States—i.e., whether a future president could lawfully repudiate the JCPOA once it goes into effect—is a matter of dispute. Legal scholars [[Bruce Ackerman]] of [[Yale Law School]] and David Golove of the [[New York University School of Law]] argue that the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015 had the effect of making the agreement (once implemented) into a [[congressional-executive agreement]].&lt;ref name="Nelson"&gt;Steven Nelson, [https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/07/15/iran-deal-may-bind-next-president "Iran Deal May Bind Next President: Scholars say the nuclear agreement could be binding under domestic and international law"], ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' (15 July 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Golove states that the president cannot "ignore commitments [made by him or by a past president] in congressional-executive agreements without congressional authority to do so", and believes that the agreement is binding under international law, irrespective of any White House declaration, because it contains no provision saying otherwise.&lt;ref name="Nelson"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Golove, [https://www.justsecurity.org/14154/presidential-authority-conclude-iran-nuclear-agreement-and-senates-self-defeating-bill/ "Presidential Authority to Conclude an Iran Nuclear Agreement—and the Senate's Self-Defeating Bill"], Just Security (20 August 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; Ackerman agrees, arguing, "Presidents do not have the power to repudiate congressional-executive agreements without strictly following the procedures laid out by Congress in its original authorizing legislation."&lt;ref name="Nelson"/&gt; Others, such as Michael Ramsey of the [[University of San Diego School of Law]], argue that unless Congress expressly approves of the agreement via a resolution of approval (which is unlikely), the agreement is nonbinding under domestic law, so that "this president can implement to the extent of his statutory and constitutional authority [and] future presidents can refuse to follow."&lt;ref name="Nelson"/&gt; Ramsey points out, however, that even if the agreement is a nonbinding executive agreement under domestic law, it may still be binding under international law, since domestic invalidity is not a defense to failure to follow an international agreement.&lt;ref name="Nelson"/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The position of the U.S. government is different. Secretary of State Kerry stated in a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, "with respect to the talks, we've been clear from the beginning. We're not negotiating a, quote, 'legally binding plan.' We're negotiating a plan that will have in it a capacity for enforcement."&lt;ref&gt;Michael J. Glennon, [https://www.justsecurity.org/21130/iran-nuclear-deal-dispensability-obligation/ "The Iran Nuclear Deal: The Dispensability of Obligation"], Just Security (16 March 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; (Kerry also said that a future president is, as a practical matter, unlikely to "turn around and just nullify it" given the international agreement from the other P5+1 powers.&lt;ref name="SchwartzBinding"&gt;Felicia Schwartz, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/iran-nuclear-deal-if-reached-wouldnt-be-legally-binding-kerry-says-1426115097 "Iran Nuclear Deal, If Reached, Wouldn't Be 'Legally Binding,' Kerry Says"], ''The Wall Street Journal'' (11 March 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;) Several legal scholars support this argument. [[John B. Bellinger III]] argues: "The next president will have the legal right under both domestic and international law to scrap the JCPOA and reimpose U.S. nuclear sanctions on Iran."&lt;ref name="Laub"&gt;Zachary Laub, [http://www.cfr.org/iran/binding-iran-deal/p36828 "How Binding Is the Iran Deal?"] (interview with John B. Bellinger III), Council on Foreign Relations (23 July 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Bellinger states that "such an action would be inconsistent with political commitments made by the Obama administration and would likely cause a major rift with U.S. allies and Iran to resume its nuclear activities," but that "would not constitute a violation of international law, because the JCPOA is not legally binding".&lt;ref name="Laub"/&gt; [[Orde Kittrie]] of [[Arizona State University]] similarly writes that the JCPOA is a kind of "nonbinding, unsigned political" agreement considered "more flexible than treaties or other legally binding international agreements".&lt;ref name="Kittrie"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/congress-can-rewrite-the-iran-deal-1439419154 |title=Congress Can Rewrite the Iran Deal |work=The Wall Street Journal |author=[[Orde Kittrie]] |date=12 August 2015 |accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On 15 July 2015, the [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations|American ambassador to the UN]], [[Samantha Power]], circulated a fourteen-page draft to Council members.&lt;ref name="Sengupta" /&gt; On 20 July 2015, the Security Council unanimously approved the fourteen-page resolution—[[United Nations Security Council resolution]] 2231&lt;ref name="Res2231"&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/sc/inc/pages/pdf/pow/RES2231E.pdf "United Nations Security Council Resolution 2231 (2015)"], adopted by the Security Council at its 7488th meeting, on 20 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt;—in a 15–0 vote.&lt;ref name="UNSCRes" /&gt; The resolution delays its official implementation for 90 days, to allow for U.S. Congressional consideration under the [[Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015]].&lt;ref name="UNSCScheduled" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UNSCRes" /&gt; The resolution lays out the steps for terminating sanctions imposed by seven past [[United Nations Security Council resolution|Security Council resolutions]], but retains an [[arms embargo]] and ballistic missile technology ban.&lt;ref name="Thomson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UNSCRes" /&gt; The resolution also did not affect the sanctions imposed separately by the United States and the European Union.&lt;ref name="UNSCRes" /&gt; The resolution also codifies the "snapback" mechanism of the agreement, under which all Security Council sanctions will be automatically reimposed if Iran breaches the deal.&lt;ref name="Thomson" /&gt;

Speaking immediately after the vote, Power told the Security Council that sanctions relief would start only when Iran "verifiably" met its obligations. Power also called upon Iran "to immediately release all unjustly detained Americans", specifically naming [[Amir Hekmati]], [[Saeed Abedini]], and [[Jason Rezaian]], were imprisoned by Iran was detained at the time, and [[Robert A. Levinson]], who has been missing in the country.&lt;ref name="UNSCRes" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Samantha Power, U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations, [http://usun.state.gov/briefing/statements/245067.htm "Explanation of Vote at a UN Security Council Vote on Resolution 2231 on Iran Non-proliferation"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723001412/http://usun.state.gov/briefing/statements/245067.htm |date=23 July 2015 }} U.S. State Department (20 July 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Hekmati, Abedini, and Rezaian were subsequently released in a January 2016 prisoner exchange, which Secretary of State Kerry said had been accelerated by the nuclear agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Pearson &amp; Elise Labott, [http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/16/middleeast/iran-jason-rezaian-prisoners-freed/ 5 Americans released by Iran, 4 as part of prisoner swap], CNN (16 January 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Approved by European Union===
On the same day that the Security Council approved a resolution, the European Union formally approved the JCPOA via a vote of the EU [[Foreign Affairs Council]] (the group of EU foreign ministers) meeting in [[Brussels]]. This sets into motion the lifting of certain EU sanctions, including those prohibiting the purchase of Iranian oil.&lt;ref name="UNSCRes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Emmott"&gt;Robin Emmott &amp; Francesco Guarascio, [https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/20/us-iran-nuclear-eu-idUSKCN0PU0S520150720 "Europe backs Iran nuclear deal in signal to U.S. Congress"], Reuters (20 July 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; The EU continues its sanctions relating to human rights and its sanctions [[Export control|prohibiting the export]] of ballistic missile technology.&lt;ref name="UNSCRes" /&gt; The approval by the EU was seen as a signal to the U.S. Congress.&lt;ref name="Emmott" /&gt;

On 22 May 2015, President Obama signed the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015 into law;{{efn|The Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015, Pub.L. 114–17, was an amendment to the [[Atomic Energy Act of 1954]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.congress.gov/114/plaws/publ17/PLAW-114publ17.pdf "Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015"], Pub.L. 114–17.&lt;/ref&gt;}} this legislation passed by the Senate in a 98-1 vote and the House in a 400-25 vote, and was approved by President Obama on 22 May 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.davispolk.com/sites/default/files/2015-05-29_Iran_Nuclear_Agreement_Review_Act_Becomes_Law.pdf "Iran Nuclear Review Act Becomes Law"], [[Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell]] LLP (29 May 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Act, once a nuclear agreement was negotiated with Iran, Congress had  sixty days in which it could pass a resolution of approval, a resolution of disapproval, or do nothing.&lt;ref name="Weisman" /&gt; The Act also included additional time beyond the sixty days for the president to veto a resolution and for Congress to take a vote on whether to override or sustain the veto.&lt;ref name="Liptak"&gt;Kevin Liptak, [http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/14/politics/iran-nuclear-deal-congress-obama-block/ "Now that he has a deal with Iran, Obama must face Congress"], CNN (14 July 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Republicans could only defeat the deal if they mustered the two-thirds of both houses of Congress needed to override an expected veto by Obama of any resolution of disapproval.&lt;ref name="Weisman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Page" /&gt;

On 19 July 2015, the State Department officially transmitted to Congress the JCPOA, its annexes, and related materials.&lt;ref name="StateTransmittal"&gt;[https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2015/07/245051.htm "Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action"], United States Department of State (19 June 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; These documents included the Unclassified Verification Assessment Report on the JCPOA and the [[United States Intelligence Community|Intelligence Community]]'s Classified Annex to the Verification Assessment Report.&lt;ref name="StateTransmittal" /&gt; The sixty-day review period began the next day, 20 July,&lt;ref name="StateTransmittal" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eric Bradner, [http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/19/politics/john-kerry-iran-deal-congress/ "State Dept. sends Iran deal to Congress"], CNN (19 July 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weisman"&gt;Jonathan Weisman &amp; Julie Hirschfeld Davis, [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/15/world/middleeast/congress-iran-nuclear-deal.html "Republican Lawmakers Vow Fight to Derail Nuclear Deal"], ''The New York Times'' (14 July 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; and ended 17 September.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Zengerle, [https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/08/04/us-iran-nuclear-congress-idUSKCN0Q922020150804 "House to vote on Iran deal disapproval resolution"], Reuters (4 August 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[Ted Cruz]] introduced a [[Simple resolution|resolution]] seeking a delay in the review period, arguing that the sixty-day congressional review under the Act should not begin until the Senate obtains a copy of all bilateral Iran-IAEA documents.

====Obama administration====
The [[international community]] had long sought a landmark diplomatic agreement with Iran on its nuclear program, and such an agreement was also a long-sought [[Foreign policy of the Barack Obama administration|foreign-policy goal of the Obama administration]].&lt;ref&gt;Maya Rhodan, [http://time.com/3956880/iran-nuclear-deal/ "Western Powers Reach Long-sought Nuclear Deal With Iran"], ''Time'' (14 July 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/Iran_Nuclear_Proposals "History of Official Proposals on the Iranian Nuclear Issue"], Arms Control Association (last updated 14 July 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laurence Norman &amp; Jay Solomon, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/iran-world-powers-reach-nuclear-deal-1436861667 Iran, World Powers Reach Nuclear Deal], ''The Wall Street Journal'' (14 July 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

In comments made in the [[East Room]] of the White House on 15 July 2015, President Obama urged Congress to support the agreement, saying "If we don't choose wisely, I believe future generations will judge us harshly, for letting this moment slip away."&lt;ref name="Shear"&gt;Michael D.

{{quote|With respect to Iran, it is a [[Iranian civilization|great civilization]], but it also has an authoritarian theocracy in charge that is anti-American, anti-Israeli, anti-Semitic, sponsors terrorism, and there are a whole host of real profound differences that we [have with] them ... [T]heir argument was, 'We're entitled to have a peaceful nuclear program.' ...&amp;nbsp;You know, I have a lot of differences with [[Ronald Reagan]], but where I completely admire him was his recognition that [we] were [[START I|able to verify an agreement]] that [was negotiated] with the [[Evil Empire speech|evil empire]] [the [[Soviet Union]]] that was [[Cold War|hellbent on our destruction]] and was a far greater existential threat to us than Iran will ever be ... I had a lot of disagreements with [[Richard Nixon]], but he understood there was the prospect, the possibility, that [[1972 Nixon visit to China|China could take a different path]]. You test these things, and as long as we are preserving our security capacity—as long as we are not giving away our ability to respond forcefully, militarily, where necessary to protect our friends and our allies—that is a risk we have to take. It is a practical, common-sense position. It's not naïve; it's a recognition that if we can in fact resolve some of these differences, without resort to force, that will be a lot better for us and the people of that region.&lt;ref name="Friedman"/&gt;}}

Also on 15 July, Vice President Joe Biden met with Senate Democrats on the Foreign Relations Committee on Capitol Hill, where he made a presentation on the agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Deirdre Walsh &amp; Ted Barrett, [http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/15/politics/iran-deal-white-house-democrats-congress/ "WH dispatches Joe Biden to lock down Iran deal on Capitol Hill"], CNN (16 July 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 July, Obama devoted his [[Weekly Radio Address of the President of the United States|weekly radio address]] to the agreement, stating, "this deal will make America and the world safer and more secure" and rebutting "a lot of overheated and often dishonest arguments about it".&lt;ref name="WeeklyRadio"&gt;[https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/07/18/weekly-address-comprehensive-long-term-deal-iran "Weekly Address: A Comprehensive, Long-Term Deal with Iran"], White House Office of the Press Secretary (18 July 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Obama stated "as [[commander-in-chief]], I make no apology for keeping this country safe and secure through the hard work of diplomacy over the easy rush to war."&lt;ref name="WeeklyRadio"/&gt; On 23 July, President Obama met in the [[White House Cabinet Room]] with about a dozen undecided House Democrats to speak about the agreement and seek their support.&lt;ref name="July23Hrg"/&gt;

The debate over the agreement was marked by acrimony between the White House and with Republicans inside and outside of Congress.

And so when you get rhetoric like this, maybe it gets attention and maybe this is just an effort to push [[Donald Trump|Mr. Trump]] out of the headlines, but it's not the kind of leadership that is needed for America right now."&lt;ref name="AddisAbbaRemarks"&gt;[https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/07/27/remarks-president-obama-and-prime-minister-hailemariam-desalegn-ethiopia "Remarks by President Obama and Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn of Ethiopia in Joint Press Conference, National Palace Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"], White House Office of the Press Secretary (27 July 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 August, Obama gave a speech before an audience of around 200 at [[American University]], marking a new phase in the administration's campaign for the agreement.&lt;ref name="AmericanSpeech"&gt;Julie Hirschfeld Davis, [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/06/us/politics/obama-urges-critics-of-iran-deal-to-ignore-drumbeat-of-war.html "It's Either Iran Nuclear Deal or 'Some Form of War,' Obama Warns"], ''The New York Times'' (5 August 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AmericanSpeechTranscript"&gt;[https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/08/05/remarks-president-iran-nuclear-deal Remarks by the President on the Iran Nuclear Deal, American University, Washington, D.C.], White House Office of the Press Secretary (5 August 2015). Another transcript of this speech was also printed by [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/08/05/text-obama-gives-a-speech-about-the-iran-nuclear-deal/ ''The Washington Post''].&lt;/ref&gt; Obama stated: "Let's not mince words: The choice we face is ultimately between diplomacy and some form of war—maybe not tomorrow, maybe not three months from now, but soon. How can we in good conscience justify war before we've tested a diplomatic agreement that achieves our objectives?"&lt;ref name="AmericanSpeech"/&gt; In his speech, Obama also invoked a speech made by [[John F. Kennedy]] at American University in 1963 in favor of the [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]].&lt;ref name="AmericanSpeech"/&gt; Obama also said that the opponents of the agreement were the same people who created the "drumbeat of war" that led to the [[Iraq War]] and criticized "knee-jerk partisanship that has become all too familiar, rhetoric that renders every decision made to be a disaster, a surrender".&lt;ref name="AmericanSpeech"/&gt;

New York Senator [[Chuck Schumer]], a senior Democrat, made a different assessment of prospects for war by distinguishing between nuclear and non-nuclear aspects of the agreement. In each case he asked whether we are better off with the agreement or without it and his conclusion was: "...&amp;nbsp;when it comes to the nuclear aspects of the agreement within ten years, we might be slightly better off with it. However, when it comes to the nuclear aspects after ten years and the non-nuclear aspects, we would be better off without it." Then Schumer assessed the Iranian government, saying, "Who's to say this dictatorship will not prevail for another ten, twenty, or thirty years? To me, the very real risk that Iran will not moderate and will, instead, use the agreement to pursue its nefarious goals is too great." And, finally, Schumer concluded: "I will vote to disapprove the agreement, not because I believe war is a viable or desirable option, nor to challenge the path of diplomacy. It is because I believe Iran will not change, and under this agreement it will be able to achieve its dual goals of eliminating sanctions while ultimately retaining its nuclear and non-nuclear power."&lt;ref name="schumer"/&gt;

In the same speech, Obama stated: "Just because Iranian hard-liners chant '[[Death to America]]' does not mean that that's what all Iranians believe. In fact, it's those hard-liners who are most comfortable with the status quo. It's those hard-liners chanting 'Death to America' who have been most opposed to the deal. They're making common cause with the Republican caucus."&lt;ref name="AmericanSpeechTranscript"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Collins Remark"&gt;Eliza Collins, [http://www.politico.com/story/2015/08/barack-obama-stands-by-comparison-republicans-iranian-hardliners-121225.html "President Obama stands by comments linking Republicans to Iranian hard-liners"], ''Politico'' (10 August 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; This statement was criticized by congressional Republican leaders. Senate Majority Leader [[Mitch McConnell]] called it "crass political rhetoric" that was a strategy to "Demonize your opponents, gin up the base, get the Democrats all angry, and rally around the president." McConnell said "This is an enormous national security debate that the president will leave behind, under the Constitution, a year and a half from now, and the rest of us will be dealing with the consequences of it. So I wish he would tone down the rhetoric and let's talk about the facts" and promised that Republicans would discuss the agreement respectfully in September.&lt;ref name="McConnellCommonCause"&gt;{{cite news |author=Michael McAuliff |title=Mitch McConnell Scolds Obama To Tone Down Iran Rhetoric |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mitch-mcconnell-scolds-obama-on-iran-rhetoric_55c3a13ae4b0f1cbf1e41c2f |date=6 August 2015 |publisher=[[The Huffington Post]] |accessdate=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cnn08062015"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1508/06/wolf.02.html |title=Transcripts |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=6 August 2015 |accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Republican Senator [[Bob Corker]], the chairman of Foreign Relations Committee, asserted that the president was "trying to shut down debate by saying that those who have legitimate questions, legitimate questions—are somehow unpatriotic, are somehow compared to hardliners in Iran".&lt;ref name="thehill08062015"&gt;{{cite news |author=Jordain Carney |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/250425-corker-obama-trying-to-shut-down-iran-debate |title=Corker: Obama 'trying to shut down' Iran debate |work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |date=6 August 2015 |accessdate=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The president subsequently stood by his statement, with White House Press Secretary [[Josh Earnest]] calling it a "statement of fact"&lt;ref name="McConnellCommonCause"/&gt; and the president saying in an interview, "Remember, what I said was that it's the hard-liners in Iran who are most opposed to this deal.

I didn't say that they were equivalent."&lt;ref name="Collins Remark"/&gt; In the same interview, Obama said: "A sizable proportion of the Republicans were opposed before the ink was even dry on the deal."&lt;ref name="Collins Remark"/&gt;

In comments made at the Aspen Security Forum in [[Aspen, Colorado]] in July 2015, [[Director of National Intelligence]] [[James Clapper]] said that the JCPOA will improve the U.S. ability to monitor Iran, saying "[The agreement] puts us in a far better place in terms of insight and access" than no agreement.&lt;ref name="ClapperAspen"&gt;Eliza Collins, [http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/clapper-iran-deal-gives-us-access-insight-120616.html "Clapper: Iran deal gives U.S. access, insight"], ''Politico'' (24 July 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; While Clapper remains "concerned about compliance and deceit", but "pointed out that during the negotiation period [Iran] complied with rules" negotiated under the interim agreement (the Joint Plan of Action).&lt;ref name="ClapperAspen"/&gt;

On 11 August 2015, an open letter endorsing the agreement signed by 36 retired military [[general officer|generals]] and [[admiral]]s, titled "The Iran Deal Benefits U.S. National Security: An Open Letter from Retired Generals and Admirals", was released.&lt;ref name="GeneralsLetter"&gt;Karen DeYoung, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/retired-generals-and-admirals-back-iran-nuclear-deal/2015/08/11/bd26f6ae-4045-11e5-bfe3-ff1d8549bfd2_story.html?hpid=z1 "Dozens of retired generals, admirals back Iran nuclear deal"], ''The Washington Post'' (11 August 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GeneralsLetterText"&gt;[https://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/documents/world/read-an-open-letter-from-retired-generals-and-admirals-on-the-iran-nuclear-deal/1689/ "Read: An open letter from retired generals and admirals on the Iran nuclear deal"] (letter released 11 August 2015), reprinted by ''The Washington Post''.&lt;/ref&gt; The letter, signed by retired officers from all five branches of the [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. armed services]], said that the agreement was "the most effective means currently available to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons", and said, "If at some point it becomes necessary to consider military action against Iran, gathering sufficient international support for such an effort would only be possible if we have first given the diplomatic path a chance. We must exhaust diplomatic options before moving to military ones."&lt;ref name="GeneralsLetterText"/&gt; The signers included General [[James Cartwright|James E.

The above letter was answered on 25 August 2015, by a letter signed by more than 200 retired generals and admirals opposing the deal.&lt;ref&gt;Emma-Jo Morris, [http://irantruth.org/more-than-200-retired-generals-admirals-sign-letter-opposing-the-iran-deal/ "More Than 200 Retired Generals &amp; Admirals Sign Letter Opposing the Iran Deal"], IranTruth.org (26 August 2015, subsequently updated).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OtherGeneralsLetter"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/retired-generals-and-admirals-urge-congress-to-reject-iran-deal/2015/08/26/8912d9c6-4bf5-11e5-84df-923b3ef1a64b_story.html |title=Retired generals and admirals urge Congress to reject Iran nuclear deal |author=Morello, Carol |work=The Washington Post |date=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wpost08252015"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/documents/world/read-an-open-letter-from-retired-generals-and-admirals-opposing-the-iran-nuclear-deal/1703/ |title=Read: An open letter from retired generals and admirals opposing the Iran nuclear deal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The letter asserted: "The agreement does not 'cut off every pathway' for Iran to acquire nuclear weapons. To the contrary, it provides Iran with a legitimate pathway for doing exactly that simply by abiding by the deal. ... The JCPOA would threaten the national security and vital interests of the United States and, therefore, should be disapproved by the Congress."&lt;ref name="wpost08252015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="time08272015"/&gt; This letter was organized by [[Leon Edney|Leon A.

Boykin]], former Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence; and Lieutenant General [[Thomas McInerney]], former vice commander of U.S. Air Forces in Europe.&lt;ref name="OtherGeneralsLetter"/&gt;

Retired Marine Corps General [[Anthony Zinni]] said that he had refused requests from both sides to sign their letters, saying to ''Time'' magazine: "I'm convinced that 90% of the guys who signed the letter one way or the other don't have any clue about whether it's a good or bad deal. They sign it because somebody's asked them to sign it." As to the JCPOA Zinni said: "The agreement's fine, if you think it can work. But if this is a Neville Chamberlain then you're in a world of shit."&lt;ref name="time08272015"&gt;Mark Thompson, [http://time.com/4013966/iran-nuclear-vote-generals/ "Retired Generals Wage Letter War Over Iran Nuclear Deal Vote"], ''Time'' (27 August 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 August, retired Senators [[Carl Levin]] of Michigan, a Democrat, and [[John Warner]] of Virginia, a Republican, co-wrote an op-ed in support of the agreement—titled "Why hawks should also back the Iran deal"—published in ''[[Politico]]''.&lt;ref name="LevinWarner"&gt;Carl Levin &amp; John Warner, [http://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2015/08/levin-warner-military-option-iran-nuclear-deal-000198 "Why hawks should also back the Iran deal"], ''Politico'' (13 August 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Levin and Warner, both past chairmen of the Senate Armed Services Committee, argued, "If we reject the agreement, we risk isolating ourselves and damaging our ability to assemble the strongest possible coalition to stop Iran" in the event that military action was needed in the future.&lt;ref name="LevinWarner"/&gt; Levin and Warner wrote, "The deal on the table is a strong agreement on many counts, and it leaves in place the robust deterrence and credibility of a military option. We urge our former colleagues not to take any action which would undermine the deterrent value of a coalition that participates in and could support the use of a military option. The failure of the United States to join the agreement would have that effect."&lt;ref name="LevinWarner"/&gt; On 14 August, retired senators [[Richard Lugar]] of Indiana, a Republican, and [[J. Bennett Johnston]] of Louisiana, a Democrat, also wrote in support of the agreement.&lt;ref name="LugarJohnston"&gt;Richard Lugar &amp; J.

If Washington walks away from this hard-fought multilateral agreement, its dependability would likely be doubted for decades."&lt;ref name="LugarJohnston"/&gt; They also wrote: "Tehran would be the winner of this U.S. rejection because it would achieve its major objective: the lifting of most sanctions without being required to accept constraints on its nuclear program. Iran could also claim to be a victim of American perfidy and try to convince other nations to break with U.S. leadership and with the entire international sanctions regime."&lt;ref name="LugarJohnston"/&gt;

On 17 August 2015, a group of 75 arms control and nuclear nonproliferation experts issued a joint statement endorsing the agreement.&lt;ref name="ACA Letter"&gt;[http://www.armscontrol.org/files/Nonpro_Specialist_statement_on_Iran_Deal_Aug_2015.pdf "The Comprehensive P5+1 Nuclear Agreement With Iran: A Net-Plus for Nonproliferation: Statement from Nuclear Nonproliferation Specialists"], Arms Control Association (17 August 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Crowley Experts"&gt;Michael Crowley, [http://www.politico.com/story/2015/08/nuclear-experts-fall-in-behind-obama-iran-121459.html "Nuclear experts fall in behind Obama: The deal with Iran exceeds historical standards for arms control agreements, 75 experts say"], ''Politico'' (18 August 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; The statement says, "the JCPOA is a strong, long-term, and verifiable agreement that will be a net-plus for international nuclear nonproliferation efforts" and that the JCPOA's "rigorous limits and transparency measures will make it very likely that any future effort by Iran to pursue nuclear weapons, even a clandestine program, would be detected promptly, providing the opportunity to intervene decisively to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon".&lt;ref name="ACA Letter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Crowley Experts"/&gt; The letter was organized through the nonpartisan [[Arms Control Association]].&lt;ref name="Crowley Experts"/&gt; Among the 75 signatories are the [[Valerie Plame]] and [[Joseph C. Wilson]]; former IAEA director-general [[Hans Blix]]; [[Morton H. Halperin]]; and experts from the [[Brookings Institution]], [[Stimson Center]], and other [[think tank]]s.&lt;ref name="ACA Letter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Crowley Experts"/&gt; On 3 September, an open letter to President Obama signed by 56 people was issued criticizing the JCPOA as "unverifiable". The letter said: "Guided by our experience with U.S. and foreign nuclear weapons programs—as well as with the history and practice of arms control, nonproliferation, and intelligence matters, we judge the current JCPOA to be a very bad deal indeed."&lt;ref name="Goodenough"&gt;Paul Goodenough, [http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/patrick-goodenough/arms-control-experts-obama-your-iran-deal-not-verifiable-very-bad "Arms Control Experts to Obama: Your Iran Deal Is 'Not Verifiable'"], CNS News (3 September 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Signers included Boykin; Bolton; ex-CIA director [[James Woolsey]], former national security advisor [[Robert McFarlane]]; [[Paula A.

Paul Robinson]].&lt;ref name="Goodenough"/&gt;

Foreign diplomats are also involved in the congressional debate. The [[List of Israeli ambassadors to the United States|Israeli ambassador to the United States]] [[Ron Dermer]] appeared on cable television shows to attack the agreement, while ambassadors from European nations, including Sir [[Peter Westmacott]], the [[List of Ambassadors of the United Kingdom to the United States|British ambassador to the United States]], "came on to say the precise opposite".&lt;ref&gt;Peter Foster, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/barackobama/11748409/Barack-Obamas-big-gamble-Will-Iran-deal-secure-his-presidential-legacy.html "Barack Obama's big gamble: Will Iran deal secure his presidential legacy?"], ''The Daily Telegraph'' (18 July 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Dermer also lobbied members of Congress on Capitol Hill against the agreement,&lt;ref&gt;Deb Riechmann, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/hearing-on-iran-nuclear-deal-opens-with-sharp-gop-criticism/2015/07/23/2003439e-309d-11e5-8f36-18d1d501920d_story.html "Dermer becomes PM's pointman as battle over Iran deal moves to DC"], ''The Washington Post'', Associated Press (19 July 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; while diplomats from France, Britain, and Germany made the rounds on Capitol Hill to advocate for the agreement.&lt;ref name="DeYoungHrg"&gt;Karen DeYoung, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/hearing-on-iran-nuclear-deal-opens-with-sharp-gop-criticism/2015/07/23/2003439e-309d-11e5-8f36-18d1d501920d_story.html "Senate opponents of Iran deal draw hard lines against White House"], ''The Washington Post'' (23 July 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 August, P5+1 diplomats held "a rare meeting of world powers' envoys on Capitol Hill" with about 30 Senate Democrats to urge support for the agreement, saying, "If Congress rejects this good deal, and the U.S. is forced to walk away, Iran will be left with an unconstrained nuclear program with far weaker monitoring arrangements, the current international consensus on sanctions would unravel, and international unity and pressure on Iran would be seriously undermined."&lt;ref name="Hudson Diplomats"&gt;John Hudson, [https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/08/06/p51-nations-press-senate-democrats-to-support-iran-deal/ "P5+1 Nations Press Senate Democrats to Support Iran Deal"], ''Foreign Policy'' (6 August 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

On ''[[Meet the Press]]'' on 6 September 2015, former Secretary of State [[Colin Powell]] expressed support for the nuclear agreement with Iran, saying that it was "a pretty good deal".&lt;ref name="Colin Powell"&gt;Alexandra Jaffe, [http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/iran-nuclear-talks/colin-powell-iran-deal-pretty-good-deal-n422551 "Colin Powell: Iran Deal Is a 'Pretty Good Deal'"], NBC News (6 September 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Powell said that various provisions accepted by Iran—such as the reduction in centrifuges and the uranium stockpile and the agreement to shut down its plutonium reactor—were "remarkable changes" that stopped the Iranian pathway to a nuclear weapons program. Powell also defended the verification provisions of the agreement, saying: "I think a very vigorous verification regime has been put into place."&lt;ref name="Colin Powell"/&gt;

Former Ambassador [[Dennis Ross]], a longtime American negotiator in the Middle East, wrote that he was not yet convinced by either proponents or opponents of the agreement.&lt;ref name="Ross"&gt;Dennis Ross, [http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/07/iran-deal-enforcement-120786.html "How to Make Iran Keep its Word"], ''Politico'' (29 July 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Ross wrote that the United States should be focused on "deterring the Iranians from cheating" (e.g., by producing highly enriched uranium) after year fifteen of the agreement.&lt;ref name="Ross"/&gt; Ross wrote, "President Obama emphasizes that the agreement is based on verification not trust. But our catching Iran cheating is less important than the price they know they will pay if we catch them. Deterrence needs to apply not just for the life of the deal."&lt;ref name="Ross"/&gt; As part of a deterrence strategy, Ross proposed transferring to Israel the U.S. [[Massive Ordnance Penetrator]] (MOP) "[[bunker buster]]" bomb at some point before year fifteen of the agreement.&lt;ref name="Ross"/&gt; In a 25 August op-ed in ''The Washington Post'', Ross and [[David H. Petraeus]] again argued for transferring the MOP to Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Ross &amp; David H. Petraeus, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/how-to-put-some-teeth-into-the-nuclear-deal-with-iran/2015/08/25/6f3db43c-4b35-11e5-bfb9-9736d04fc8e4_story.html "How to put some teeth into the nuclear deal with Iran"], ''The Washington Post'' (25 August 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Jewish American]] community was divided on the agreement. On 19 August 2015, leaders of the Reform Jewish movement, the largest Jewish denomination in the United States, issued a lengthy public statement expressed a neutral position on the agreement.&lt;ref name="Shalev"&gt;Chemi Shalev, [http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/.premium-1.671996 "Reflecting Deep Divisions, Reform Movement Abstains From 'Yes' or 'No' on Iran Deal"], ''Haaretz'' (19 August 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://urj.org/about/union/pr/2015/?syspage=article&amp;item_id=118381 "Reform Jewish Movement Response to Iran Deal: Address Important Concerns, Focus on the Day After"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150821235705/http://urj.org/about/union/pr/2015/?syspage=article&amp;item_id=118381 |date=21 August 2015 }}, Union for Reform Judaism (20 August 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; The statement, signed by the leaders of the [[Union for Reform Judaism]], [[Central Conference of American Rabbis]], [[Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism]] and Association of Reform Zionists of America, reflected what [[Rabbi]] [[Richard Jacobs (rabbi)|Rick Jacobs]], president of the URJ, called "deep divisions within the movement".&lt;ref name="Shalev"/&gt; On 20 August 2015, a group of 26 prominent current and foreign American Jewish communal leaders published a full-page ad in ''The New York Times'' with a statement backing the agreement; signers included three former chairs of the [[Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations]] as well as former AIPAC executive director [[Tom Dine]].&lt;ref&gt;Nathan Guttman, [http://forward.com/news/319481/full-page-new-york-times-ad-backs-iran-deal/ "26 Top Jewish Leaders Back Iran Deal in New York Times Ad"] (20 August 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Separately, a group of 340 rabbis organized by [[Ameinu]] issued a public letter to Congress on 17 August 2015, in support of the agreement, saying: "We, along with many other Jewish leaders, fully support this historic nuclear accord."&lt;ref name="Rabbi Letter"&gt;[http://www.jta.org/2015/08/17/news-opinion/politics/340-u-s-rabbis-sign-letter-supporting-iran-deal "340 U.S. rabbis sign letter supporting Iran deal"], Jewish Telegraphic Agency (17 August 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; The signers were mostly Reform rabbis, but included at least 50 rabbis from the Conservative movement and at least one Orthodox rabbi.&lt;ref&gt;Lauren Markoe, [http://ncronline.org/news/politics/340-rabbis-urge-congress-approve-iran-nuclear-deal "340 rabbis urge Congress to approve Iran nuclear deal"], Religion News Service (17 August 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent rabbis who signed this letter included [[Sharon Brous]], [[Burton Visotzky]], [[Nina Beth Cardin]], [[Lawrence Kushner]], [[Sharon Kleinbaum]], and [[Amy Eilberg]].&lt;ref name="Rabbi Letter"/&gt; In a separate letter released 27 August, eleven Democratic Jewish former members of Congress urged support for the agreement; the letter noted the signatories' pro-Israel credentials and said that the agreement "halts the immediate threat of a nuclear-armed Iran", while a rejection of the deal would "put Iran back on the path to develop a nuclear weapon within two to three months".&lt;ref name="JTAJewishExCongressman"&gt;Jewish Telegraphic Agency, [http://www.jta.org/2015/08/27/news-opinion/politics/11-former-jewish-congressmen-back-iran-deal-190-former-generals-oppose "11 Jewish ex-congressmen back Iran deal; 190 former generals oppose"] (27 August 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Signatories included former Senator [[Carl Levin]] and former Representatives [[Barney Frank]], [[Mel Levine]], [[Steve Rothman]], and [[Robert Wexler]].&lt;ref name="JTAJewishExCongressman"/&gt;

Conversely, a group of 900 rabbis signed an open letter written by [[Kalman Topp]] and Yonah Bookstein in late August, calling upon Congress to reject the agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Aron Chilewich, [http://www.jewishjournal.com/irandeal/article/more_than_900_rabbis_sign_letter_opposing_iran_nuclear_deal "More than 900 rabbis sign letter opposing Iran nuclear deal"], ''The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles'' (27 August 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Orthodox Union]] and [[American Jewish Committee]] also announced opposition to the agreement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forward.com/news/breaking-news/318167/orthodox-rabbis-to-join-lobbying-push-against-iran-deal/ "Orthodox Rabbis to Join Lobbying Push Against Iran Deal"], Jewish Telegraphic Agency (30 July 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://forward.com/news/breaking-news/318591/american-jewish-committee-opposes-iran-nuclear-deal "American Jewish Committee Opposes Iran Nuclear Deal"], Jewish Telegraph Agency (5 August 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman Catholic Church has expressed support for the agreement. In a 14 July 2015 letter to Congress, Bishop [[Oscar Cantú]], chairman of the Committee on International Justice and Peace of the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]], stated that the JCPOA was "a momentous agreement" which "signals progress in global nuclear non-proliferation".&lt;ref name="Rotondaro"&gt;Vinnie Rotondaro, [http://ncronline.org/news/peace-justice/signs-seamless-garment-catholic-support-iran-nuke-deal "Signs of 'seamless garment' in Catholic support for Iran nuke deal"], ''National Catholic Reporter'' (13 August 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cantú Letter"&gt;[http://www.usccb.org/news/2015/15-109.cfm "Bishop Cantú Welcomes Iran Nuclear Deal, Urges Congress To Endorse Result of Negotiations"], United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (14 July 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Cantú wrote that Catholic bishops in the United States "will continue to urge Congress to endorse the result of these intense negotiations because the alternative leads toward armed conflict, an outcome of profound concern to the Church".&lt;ref name="Rotondaro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cantú Letter"/&gt;

On 25 August 2015, a group of 53 Christian faith leaders from a variety of denominations sent a message to Congress urging them to support the agreement.&lt;ref name="Toosi2"&gt;Nahal Toosi, [http://www.politico.com/story/2015/08/christian-leaders-back-iran-group-121689.html "Group of Christian leaders backs Iran deal"], ''Politico'' (24 August 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; The Christian leaders wrote: "This is a moment to remember the wisdom of Jesus who proclaimed from the [[Sermon on the Mount]], 'Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called children of God' ([[Matthew 5:9]]). ... There is no question we are all better off with this deal than without it."&lt;ref name="Toosi2"/&gt; The letter was coordinated by a [[Quaker]] group, the [[Friends Committee on National Legislation]].&lt;ref name="Toosi2"/&gt; Signatories to the letter included [[Jim Wallis]] of [[Sojourners]]; [[John C.

Nicholas Burns]] of Harvard's Belfer Center, the [[Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs]] and leading figure on Iranian nuclear matters during the second Bush administration, said that this was implausible given that Iran has 19,000 centrifuges, stating: "If I could get an ideal solution, or you could, where the Iranians submitted to every demand we had, I would take that. In a real world, you have to make real-world decisions."&lt;ref name="Seib"/&gt; Similarly, Michael A. Levi of the Maurice R. Greenberg Center for Geoeconomic Studies at the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] argued in the August–September 2011 edition of the journal ''[[Survival (journal)|Survival]]'', "it is far from clear that zero enrichment is a realistic goal" and stated, "the goal of current U.S. policy, even if it is not typically articulated this way", is "limited enrichment, in which Iran has some non-trivial enrichment capability, but is unable to produce a bomb (or small arsenal) without risking strong international retaliation, including military destruction of its enrichment infrastructure".&lt;ref&gt;Michael A.

One area of disagreement between supporters and opponents of the JCPOA is the consequences of walking away from an agreement, and whether renegotiation of the agreement is a realistic option.&lt;ref name="Areas of Dispute"/&gt; Senator [[Chuck Schumer]], Democrat of New York, an opponent of the agreement, called for the U.S. government to keep sanctions in place, strengthen them, and "pursue the hard-trodden path of diplomacy once more, difficult as it may be".&lt;ref name="schumer"/&gt; Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, said that he believed that it was "hyperbole" to say that the agreement was the only alternative to war.&lt;ref name="Areas of Dispute"/&gt; President Obama, by contrast, argued that renegotiation of the deal is unrealistic, stating in his American University speech, "the notion that there is a better deal to be had. ... relies on vague promises of toughness" and stated, "Those making this argument are either ignorant of Iranian society, or they are not being straight with the American people. ... Neither the Iranian government, or the Iranian opposition, or the Iranian people would agree to what they would view as a total surrender of their sovereignty."&lt;ref name="AmericanSpeechTranscript"/&gt; Obama also argued, "those who say we can just walk away from this deal and maintain sanctions are selling a fantasy. Instead of strengthening our position, as some have suggested, Congress' rejection would almost certainly result in multi-lateral sanctions unraveling," because "our closest allies in Europe or in Asia, much less China or Russia, certainly are not going to enforce existing sanctions for another five, 10, 15 years according to the dictates of the U.S. Congress because their willingness to support sanctions in the first place was based on Iran ending its pursuit of nuclear weapons. It was not based on the belief that Iran cannot have peaceful nuclear power."&lt;ref name="AmericanSpeechTranscript"/&gt; Secretary of State Kerry has echoed these remarks, saying in July 2015 that the idea of a "'better deal,' some sort of unicorn arrangement involving Iran's complete capitulation . ... is a fantasy, plain and simple, and our intelligence community will tell you that".&lt;ref name="Areas of Dispute"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Lucy Westcott, [http://www.newsweek.com/john-kerry-congress-there-no-better-iran-deal-362124 "With an Eye on Congress, Kerry Says There Is No Better Iran Deal"], ''Newsweek'' (11 August 2015) (Kerry: "When I hear a senator or a congressman stand up and say, 'Well, we should get a better deal,' that is not going to happen. There isn't a 'better deal' to be gotten. You can't just sit there and say, 'I say no, let's not do this deal, we'll just go get a better one' and not take into account the history of the road that has been traveled.").&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[Al Franken]], Democrat of Minnesota, a supporter of the agreement wrote: "Some say that, should the Senate reject this agreement, we would be in position to negotiate a "better" one.

On 28 July 2015, Representative [[Sander M. Levin]], Democrat of Michigan, the longest-serving Jewish member now in Congress, announced in a lengthy statement that he would support the JCPOA, saying, "the agreement is the best way" to stop Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon and that a rejection of the agreement would lead the international sanctions regime to "quickly fall apart", as "sanctions likely would not be continued even by our closest allies, and the United States would be isolated trying to enforce our unilateral sanctions as to Iran's banking and oil sectors."&lt;ref name="Steinhauer Levin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://levin.house.gov/press-release/levin-statement-iran-nuclear-agreement "Levin Statement on the Iran Nuclear Agreement"] (28 July 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Melissa Nann Burke &amp; David Shepardson, [http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2015/07/28/iran-nuclear-deal-sander-levin/30784675/ "Rep.

According to an Associated Press report, the classified assessment of the [[United States Intelligence Community]] on the agreement concludes that because Iran will be required by the agreement to provide international inspectors with "unprecedented volume of information about nearly every aspect of its existing nuclear program", Iran's ability to conceal a covert weapons program will be diminished.&lt;ref name="Dilanian"&gt;Ken Dilanian, [http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_IRAN_NUCLEAR_DEAL_INTELLIGENCE?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT "US officials say they can tell if Iran is cheating on deal"]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Associated Press (12 August 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DemirjianIntel"&gt;Karoun Demirjian, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/08/13/house-dems-pounce-on-intel-assessment-of-iran-deal/ "House Dems pounce on intel assessment of Iran deal"], ''The Washington Post'' (13 August 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; In a 13 August letter to colleagues, ten current and former Democratic members of the [[House Select Committee on Intelligence]] (including House Minority Leader [[Nancy Pelosi]] and Intelligence Committee ranking member [[Adam Schiff]]) referred to this assessment as a reason to support the agreement, writing, "We are confident that this monitoring and the highly intrusive inspections provided for in the agreement—along with our own intelligence capabilities—make it nearly impossible for Iran to develop a covert enrichment effort without detection."&lt;ref name="DemirjianIntel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DemIntelligenceLetter"&gt;[http://democrats.intelligence.house.gov/press-release/current-and-former-house-intelligence-committee-members-urge-colleagues-review "Current and Former House Intelligence Committee Members Urge Colleagues to Review Intelligence Community Assessments of Iran Nuclear Deal"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150817124341/http://democrats.intelligence.house.gov/press-release/current-and-former-house-intelligence-committee-members-urge-colleagues-review |date=17 August 2015 }}, United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Democratic Office (13 August 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; The ten members also wrote "You need not take our word for it" and referred members to the classified assessment itself, which is located in an office in the [[United States Capitol|Capitol basement]] and is available for members of Congress to read.&lt;ref name="DemirjianIntel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DemIntelligenceLetter"/&gt;

====Congressional votes====
A resolution of disapproval was initially expected to pass both the House and Senate, meaning, "the real challenge for the White House is whether they can marshal enough Democrats to sustain the veto."&lt;ref name="FrenchHurdle"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Julie Hirschfeld Davis, [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/18/world/middleeast/lobbying-fight-over-iran-nuclear-deal-centers-on-democrats.html "Lobbying Fight Over Iran Nuclear Deal Centers on Democrats"], ''The New York Times'' (17 August 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Two-thirds of both houses (the House of Representatives and the Senate) are required to override a veto, meaning that one-third of either house (146 votes in the House, or 34 in the Senate) could sustain (uphold) President Obama's veto of a resolution of disapproval.&lt;ref name="Phillips"&gt;Amber Phillips, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/07/14/whip-count-where-the-senate-stands-on-the-iran-deal/ "Whip count: Where the Senate stands on the Iran deal"], ''The Washington Post'' (5 August 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lauren French"&gt;Lauren French, [http://www.politico.com/story/2015/08/barack-obama-iran-deal-liberals-congress-win-121304.html "Liberals poised to give Barack Obama a win on Iran"], ''Politico'' (13 August 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

By early September 2015, 34 Senators had publicly confirmed support for the deal, a crucial threshold because it ensured that the Senate could sustain (i.e., uphold) any veto of a resolution of disapproval.&lt;ref name="PhillipsVotes"&gt;Amber Phillips, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/07/14/whip-count-where-the-senate-stands-on-the-iran-deal/ "President Obama's Iran deal nears a major symbolic victory"], ''The Washington Post'' (8 September 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[Barbara Mikulski]] of Maryland announced support on 2 September, a day after [[Chris Coons]] of Delaware and [[Bob Casey, Jr.]] of Pennsylvania also announced support, reaching 34 votes and assuring that an eventual disapproval resolution passed in the Senate could not override an Obama veto.&lt;ref name=2Sept&gt;{{cite news |publisher=NPR |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/09/02/436902008/sen-mikulskis-support-ensures-iran-deal-will-withstand-gop-challenge |title=Obama Secures Enough Support For Iran Deal In Congress |date=2 September 2015 |first=Brakkton |last=Booker |accessdate=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the following day, 38 Democratic senators supported the deal, 3 were opposed, and 5 were still undecided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/09/03/us/ap-us-congress-iran-nuclear-vote-count.html |title=A Look at Where Senate Democrats Stand on the Iran Deal |work=The New York Times |date=3 September 2015 |accessdate=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 8 September, all senators had made a commitment on the agreement, with 42 in support (40 Democrats and two independents) and 58 opposed (54 Republicans and four Democrats).&lt;ref name="PhillipsVotes"/&gt; It is possible for senators in support of the agreement to kill the disapproval resolution outright in the Senate by effectively [[filibuster]]ing it, making it unnecessary for Obama to veto a disapproval resolution at all.&lt;ref name="PhillipsVotes"/&gt; However, this is only possible if at least 41 vote to do so, and several senators in support of the agreement, including Coons, "have suggested they'd prefer an up-or-down vote on the deal instead of blocking it altogether".&lt;ref name="PhillipsVotes"/&gt;

The apparent success of a strategy to marshal congressional support for the deal, linked to a carefully orchestrated rollout of endorsements (although [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Democratic Senate Whip]] [[Dick Durbin]] and other officials disputed the suggestion of coordination&lt;ref name=DeBonis11Sept&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-sen-durbin-spent-his-summer-saving-the-iran-deal/2015/09/12/6095386c-5880-11e5-abe9-27d53f250b11_story.html |title=How Sen.

In televised remarks made on 23 July 2015, Iranian President [[Hassan Rouhani]] rejected domestic criticism of the JCPOA from Iranian hardliners, "such as the [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps]] and its allies", which "have criticized the accord as an invasive affront to the country's sovereignty and a capitulation to foreign adversaries, particularly the United States".&lt;ref name="RouhaniJuly23"&gt;Thomas Erdbrink &amp; Rock Gladstone, [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/24/world/middleeast/irans-president-defends-nuclear-deal-in-blunt-remarks.html "Iran's President Defends Nuclear Deal in Blunt Remarks"], ''The New York Times'' (23 July 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; In remarks described by ''The New York Times ''as "blunt" and uncharacteristically frank, Rouhani claimed a popular mandate to make an agreement based on [[Iranian presidential election, 2013|his election in 2013]] and warned that the alternative was "an economic Stone Age" brought on by sanctions which (as the ''Times'' described) have "shriveled oil exports and denied the country access to the [[Global financial system|global banking system]]".&lt;ref name="RouhaniJuly23"/&gt; On 26 July, a two-page, top-secret directive sent to Iranian newspaper editors from Iran's [[Supreme National Security Council]] surfaced online.&lt;ref name="Naji"&gt;Kasra Naji, [https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-33668390 "Iran nuclear: Media ordered to be positive about deal"], [[BBC Persian Television|BBC Persian]] (26 July 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; In the document, newspapers are instructed to avoid criticism of the agreement and to avoid giving the impression of "a rift" at the highest levels of government.&lt;ref name="Naji"/&gt; The [[BBC]] reported that the document appears to be aimed at constraining criticism of the JCPOA by Iranian hardliners.&lt;ref name="Naji"/&gt;

On 3 September, Iranian supreme leader Khamenei said that the Majlis should make the final decision on the agreement.&lt;ref name="SolomonSept3"&gt;Jay Solomon, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/irans-ali-larijani-says-parliament-must-approve-nuclear-agreement-1441304205 "Iran Leaders Say Parliament Will Have Final Say on Fate of Nuclear Deal"], ''The Wall Street Journal'' (3 September 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, [[Ali Larijani]], the [[List of Speakers of the Parliament of Iran|speaker of the parliament]], said that he support the agreement and that: "The agreement needs to be discussed and needs to be approved by the Iranian parliament. There will be heated discussions and debates."&lt;ref name="SolomonSept3"/&gt;

[[Abbas Milani]] and [[Michael McFaul]] wrote: "those [in Iran] supporting the deal include moderates inside the government, many opposition leaders, a majority of Iranian citizens, and many in the Iranian American diaspora—a disparate group that has rarely agreed on anything until now."&lt;ref name="WhatIraniansThink"&gt;Abbas Milani &amp; Michael McFaul, [https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/08/iran-deal-politics-rouhani-khamenei/400985/ "What the Iran-Deal Debate Is Like in Iran"], ''The Atlantic'' (11 August 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Within the government, Rouhani and Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, who negotiated the agreement, "are now the most vocal in defending it against Iranian hawks".&lt;ref name="WhatIraniansThink" /&gt; Also vocally supporting the agreement are former presidents Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and Mohammad Khatami and moderates within parliament.&lt;ref name="WhatIraniansThink" /&gt; The agreement is also supported by most prominent opposition leaders, including [[Mir-Hossein Mousavi]], a [[Iranian presidential election, 2009|2009 presidential candidate]] who is under house arrest for his role as a leader of the [[Iranian Green Movement|Green Movement]].&lt;ref name="WhatIraniansThink"/&gt;

Conversely, "the most militantly authoritarian, conservative, and anti-Western leaders and groups within Iran oppose the deal."&lt;ref name="WhatIraniansThink"/&gt; The anti-agreement coalition in Iran includes former president [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], former head of [[Atomic Energy Organization of Iran]] [[Fereydoon Abbasi]], ex-nuclear negotiator [[Saeed Jalili]]; and various conservative clerics and [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps|Revolutionary Guard]] commanders.&lt;ref name="WhatIraniansThink"/&gt; This group has "issued blistering attacks on the incompetence of Iran's negotiating team, claiming that negotiators caved on many key issues and were outmaneuvered by more clever and sinister American diplomats".&lt;ref name="WhatIraniansThink"/&gt;

Iranian defense minister Hossein Dehqan said on 2 September that Iran would not allow the IAEA to visit every site or facility that it wishes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13940611000185 "DM: Iran Not to Allow IAEA to Inspect Every Site"] Fars News Service, 2 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Majlis special commission for examining the JCPOA]], has invited [[Ali Shamkhani]], as well as members of former [[List of Iranian nuclear negotiators|nuclear negotiation team]] including [[Ali Bagheri]] and [[Fereydoon Abbasi]] to comment on the deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://en.mehrnews.com/news/110062/Parl-begins-10th-session-on-reviewing-JCPOA |title=Parl. begins 10th session on reviewing JCPOA |publisher=[[Mehr News Agency]] |date=13 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the session, [[Saeed Jalili]], ex-chief negotiator has slammed the deal, stating "approximately 100 absolute rights" of Iran were conceded to the opposing side. He believes the deal is "unacceptable" because Iran makes an "exceptional [nuclear case], replacing 'permission' with 'right' under the [[nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty|NPT]], and accepting unconventional measures".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/09/jalili-jcpoa-nuclear-concessions.html |author=Arash Karami |title=Former Iran deal negotiator slams concessions in nuclear deal |publisher=[[Al-Monitor]] |date=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also believes that the deal has crossed the [[Red line (phrase)|red lines]] drawn by the [[Supreme leader of Iran]].

In the Iranian media, the leading reformist newspapers, ''[[Etemad]]'' and ''[[Shargh]]'', "continue to write approvingly of the negotiations and their outcome".&lt;ref name="Kangarlou"&gt;Tara Kangarlou, [http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/8/13/why-tehrans-debate-over-nuclear-pact-mirrors-washingtons.html "Tehran's debate over nuclear pact mirrors Washington's"], Al-Jazeera (13 August 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, the leading conservative paper ''[[Ettelaat]]'' has criticized the agreement.&lt;ref name="Kangarlou"/&gt; The most "bombastic and hard-line criticism of the deal" has come from ''[[Kayhan]]'', which is edited by [[Hossein Shariatmadari]] and closely associated with Khamenei, the supreme leader.&lt;ref name="Kangarlou"/&gt;

The agreement is supported by many Iranian dissidents, including [[Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate, human rights activist, and Iranian exile [[Shirin Ebadi]], who "labeled as 'extremists' those who opposed the agreement in Iran and America".&lt;ref name="WhatIraniansThink"/&gt; Likewise, dissident journalist and former [[political prisoner]] [[Akbar Ganji]] expressed hope, "step-by-step nuclear accords, the lifting of economic sanctions and the improvement of the relations between Iran and Western powers will gradually remove the warlike and securitized environment from Iran."&lt;ref name="WhatIraniansThink"/&gt; Citing [[Human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran|Iran's human rights situation]] and the "lack of [[Freedom of religion in Iran|religious]] and political freedom in the country", some dissidents opposed the agreement, including [[Ahmad Batebi]], [[Nazanin Afshin-Jam]], and [[Roozbeh Farahanipour]], who signed an open letter arguing, "more pressure should be applied to the regime, not less."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/08/14/iranian-dissidents-against-the-iran-deal.html "Iranian Dissidents Against the Iran Deal"], The Daily Beast (14 August 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 October, ''The New York Times'' and many other major U.S. news sources reported that the Iranian Parliament had approved the JPCOA by a vote of 161 votes in favor, 59 against and 13 abstentions. Major Iranian news sources including [[Fars News Agency]] and [[Press TV]], referred to as a semi-official government source by U.S. media, reported that what was actually approved was a document consisting of the text of the JPCOA, supplemented by text unilaterally added by Iran and not agreed by the P5+1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Iran's Parliament Backs Details of Nuclear Deal |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/world/middleeast/irans-parliament-backs-details-of-nuclear-deal.html |date=13 October 2015 |accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=ISNA - Iranian lawmakers approve JCPOA details |url=http://isna.ir/en/news/94072113595/Iranian-lawmakers-approve-JCPOA-details |date=23 October 2015 |accessdate=9 December 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151023004004/http://isna.ir/en/news/94072113595/Iranian-lawmakers-approve-JCPOA-details |archivedate=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=ایسنا - جزئیات برجام در مجلس تصویب شد |url=http://isna.ir/fa/news/94072113545/%2525D8%2525AC%2525D8%2525B2%2525D8%2525A6%2525DB%25258C%2525D8%2525A7%2525D8%2525AA-%2525D8%2525A8%2525D8%2525B1%2525D8%2525AC%2525D8%2525A7%2525D9%252585-%2525D8%2525AF%2525D8%2525B1-%2525D9%252585%2525D8%2525AC%2525D9%252584%2525D8%2525B3-%2525D8%2525AA%2525D8%2525B5%2525D9%252588%2525DB%25258C%2525D8%2525A8-%2525D8%2525B4%2525D8%2525AF&amp;usg=ALkJrhgDB4RNIlnjzRTR0Fi3jhiXRrdMIA |date=9 December 2015 |accessdate=9 December 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151209062230/http://isna.ir/fa/news/94072113545/%D8%AC%D8%B2%D8%A6%DB%8C%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A8%D8%B1%D8%AC%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D9%85%D8%AC%D9%84%D8%B3-%D8%AA%D8%B5%D9%88%DB%8C%D8%A8-%D8%B4%D8%AF%26usg%3DALkJrhgDB4RNIlnjzRTR0Fi3jhiXRrdMIA |archivedate=9 December 2015 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=PressTV-مجلس جزییات برجام را تصویب کرد |url=http://www.presstv.com/DetailFa/2015/10/13/433192/Iran-&amp;edit-text= |date=9 December 2015 |accessdate=9 December 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151209062411/http://www.presstv.com/DetailFa/2015/10/13/433192/Iran-%26edit-text%3D |archivedate=9 December 2015 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=گزارش فارس از متن و حاشیه نشست امروز "خانه ملت" تصویب جزئیات طرح برجام در مجلس/ اجازه طرح پیشنهادات داده نشد |url=http://www.farsnews.com/13940719000295 |date=16 October 2015 |accessdate=9 December 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016034120/http://www.farsnews.com/13940719000295 |archivedate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tasnimnews.com/fa/news/1394/07/21/887165/%D9%85%D8%AC%D9%84%D8%B3-%D8%AC%D8%B2%D8%A6%DB%8C%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%B7%D8%B1%D8%AD-%D8%A7%D8%AC%D8%B1%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D8%A8%D8%B1%D8%AC%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%B1%D8%A7-%D8%AA%D8%B5%D9%88%DB%8C%D8%A8-%DA%A9%D8%B1%D8%AF-%D9%85%D8%AA%D9%86-%D9%85%D8%B5%D9%88%D8%A8%D9%87 |title=مجلس جزئیات طرح اجرای برجام را تصویب کرد + متن مصوبه}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adoption Day===
On 18 October 2015, EU High Representative Mogherini and Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif jointly announced "Adoption Day" for the JCPOA, noting actions taken and planned by the EU, Iran, the IAEA, and the United States, and stating, "All sides remain strongly committed to ensuring that implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action can start as soon as possible."&lt;ref&gt;[http://eeas.europa.eu/statements-eeas/2015/151018_01_en.htm "Joint Statement by EU High Representative Federica Mogherini and Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif"], Brussels, 18 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deterring Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons==

Some argue that deterrence is the key to ensuring not just that Iran is in compliance with the agreement but also to preventing them from developing nuclear weapons.&lt;ref name="wpost08282015"&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Dennis Ross]] and [[David Petraeus]] |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/how-to-put-some-teeth-into-the-nuclear-deal-with-iran/2015/08/25/6f3db43c-4b35-11e5-bfb9-9736d04fc8e4_story.html |title=How to put some teeth into the nuclear deal with Iran |date=25 August 2015 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Assistant Secretary for Nonproliferation Robert Einhorn, a supporter of the agreement, wrote it would be better to have permanent or longer-term restrictions on Iran's enrichment program, but preventing a nuclear-armed Iran is possible, "provided the United States and key partners maintain a strong and credible deterrent against a future Iranian decision to go for the bomb".&lt;ref name="Brookings082015"&gt;{{cite web |author=Robert J. Einhorn |url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/reports2/2015/08/iran-nuclear-deal-battleground-issues-einhorn |title=The battleground-issues |publisher=[[Brookings Institution]] |date=August 2015 |accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Michael Eisenstadt, Director of the Military and Security Studies Program at the [[Washington Institute for Near East Policy]], "deterring Iran from developing or acquiring nuclear weapons will remain the core imperative driving U.S. policy in the coming years".&lt;ref name="winep07292015"&gt;{{cite web |author=Michael Eisenstadt |url=http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/the-nuclear-deal-with-iran-regional-implications |title=The Nuclear Deal with Iran: Regional Implications |publisher=[[Washington Institute for Near East Policy]] |date=29 July 2015 |accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four days after the JCPOA was adopted, Khamenei delivered a speech, highlighting his [[Khamenei's fatwa against nuclear weapons|fatwa]] and rejecting the claim that the nuclear talks rather than Iran's religious abstinence prevented Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. He said:

{{quote|The Americans say they stopped Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. They know it's not true. We had a fatwa (religious ruling), declaring nuclear weapons to be religiously forbidden under Islamic law. It had nothing to do with the nuclear talks.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news |title=Ayatollah Ali Khamenei criticises 'arrogance' of the United States following nuclear deal |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/11748176/Ayatollah-Ali-Khamenei-criticises-arrogance-of-the-United-States-following-nuclear-deal.html  |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=18 July 2015 |accessdate=24 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a letter&lt;ref name="nytimes08202015"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/08/20/world/middleeast/document-obamas-letter-to-congressman-nadler.html |title=Obama's Letter to Congressman Nadler |date=20 August 2015 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; addressed to Representative [[Jerrold Nadler]], Democrat of New York, President Barack Obama raised the issue about U.S. ability to deter Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons:

{{quote|The JCPOA, moreover, does not remove any of our options when it comes to preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. As I have repeatedly emphasized, my Administration will take whatever means are necessary to achieve that goal, including military means. Should Iran seek to dash toward a nuclear weapon, all of the options available to the United States—including the military option—will remain available through the life of the deal and beyond.&lt;ref name="nytimes08202015"/&gt;}}

Ambassador [[Dennis Ross]], former top Mideast official, and General [[David Petraeus]], former CIA director, wrote in a ''Washington Post'' op-ed, "Bolstering deterrence is essential in addressing key vulnerabilities" of the agreement. Petraeus and Ross asserted that if Iran decide to race toward a nuclear weapon "there is a need not to speak of our options but of our readiness to use force", since the threat of force is far more likely to deter the Iranians. They said the president could resolve their concerns by stating that he would use military force to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, including producing highly enriched uranium, even after the deal ends in 15 years. It is "critically important for the president to state this clearly, particularly given his perceived hesitancy to use force", they said.&lt;ref name="wpost08282015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="thehill08272015"&gt;{{cite news |author=Kristina Wong |url=http://thehill.com/policy/defense/252135-petraeus-still-making-up-mind-on-iran-deal |title=Petraeus still making up his mind on Iran deal |work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |date=27 August 2015 |accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same letter, Obama detailed the possible non-military unilateral and multilateral responses to be employed should Iran violate the agreement, however, the president made it clear: "Ultimately, it is essential that we retain the flexibility to decide what responsive measures we and our allies deem appropriate for any non-compliance."&lt;ref name="nytimes08202015"/&gt; Flexibility meant that Obama rejected specifying "the penalties for smaller violations of the accord" in advance.&lt;ref name="nytimes08232015"&gt;{{cite news |author=[[David E.

The open letter, which was signed by more than 100 former U.S. ambassadors and high-ranking State Department officials endorsing the agreement, begins with the words: "The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) with Iran stands as a landmark agreement in deterring the proliferation of nuclear weapons."&lt;ref name="DiplomatsLetter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fallows"/&gt; In contrast, [[Michael Mandelbaum]], the Christian A. Herter Professor at the [[Johns Hopkins University]], [[School of Advanced International Studies]], wrote that nuclear nonproliferation in the Middle East ultimately depended "not on the details of the Vienna agreement but on the familiar Cold-War policy of deterrence". Mandelbaum added that if President Obama will leave office without Iran building the bomb, "the responsibility for conducting a policy of effective deterrence will fall on his successor."&lt;ref name="ainrerest07302015"&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Michael Mandelbaum]] |url=http://www.the-american-interest.com/2015/07/30/its-the-deterrence-stupid/ |title=It's the Deterrence, Stupid |date=30 July 2015 |work=[[The American Interest]] |accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harvard law professor [[Alan Dershowitz]] expressed his view on deterring Iran from pursuing nuclear weapons as follows: "Nothing currently on the table will deter Iran.

Diplomacy has already failed because Russia and China are playing both sides."&lt;ref name="dershowitz07292015"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Alan Dershowitz]] |title=The Case Against the Iran Deal: How Can We Now Stop Iran from Getting Nukes?

With the prospective lifting of some sanctions, the agreement was expected to have a significant impact on both the [[economy of Iran]] and global markets. The energy sector is particularly important, with Iran having nearly 10 percent of global [[oil reserves]] and 18 percent of natural gas reserves.&lt;ref name= "Krauss"&gt;Clifford Krauss, [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/15/business/international/iran-nuclear-deal-oil-prices.html  "A New Stream of Oil for Iran, but Not Right Away"], ''The New York Times'' (14 July 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Millions of barrels of Iranian oil might come onto global markets, lowering the price of [[crude oil]].&lt;ref name= "Krauss" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Faucon"&gt;Bill Spindle, Nicole Friedman &amp; Benoît Faucon, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/oil-prices-fall-as-nuclear-deal-paves-way-for-iran-exports-1436861774 "Iran Deal Raises Prospect of Fresh Oil Glut"], ''The Wall Street Journal'' (14 July 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the impact would not be immediate, because Iran would not be able to implement measures that are needed to lift sanctions until the end of 2015.&lt;ref name= "Faucon" /&gt; Technology and investment from global integrated oil companies were expected to increase capacity from Iran's oil fields and refineries, which have been in "disarray" in recent years, plagued by mismanagement and underinvestment.&lt;ref name= "Krauss" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Faucon" /&gt; Senior executives from oil giants [[Royal Dutch Shell]], [[Total S.A]], and [[Eni]] met with the Iranian oil minister in Vienna in June, the month before the JCPOA was announced, and sought business opportunities in Iran.&lt;ref name= "Faucon" /&gt;

The economic impact of a partial lifting of sanctions extends beyond the energy sector; ''The New York Times'' reported that "consumer-oriented companies, in particular, could find opportunity in this country with 81 million consumers," many of whom are young and prefer Western products.&lt;ref name= "Krauss" /&gt; Iran is "considered a strong [[emerging market]] play" by investment and trading firms.&lt;ref name="Krauss" /&gt;

French [[Automotive industry|auto manufacturer]] [[PSA Peugeot Citroën]] was one of the first Western companies to re-establish commercial ties following the deal.&lt;ref&gt;Jason Chow, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/peugeot-in-talks-to-re-establish-auto-manufacturing-in-iran-1436901032 "Peugeot in Talks to Re-Establish Auto Manufacturing in Iran"], ''The Wall Street Journal'' (15 June 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016, after the end of a four year restriction, Iranian banks—except [[Qarzol-Hasaneh Mehr Iran Bank|Mehr]], [[Bank Ansar|Ansar]] and [[Bank Saderat Iran|Saderat]] banks—&lt;ref name="SWIFT"/&gt; reconnected to the [[SWIFT]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-banks-swift-idUSKCN0VQ1FD | first = Andrew | last = Torchia |publisher= Reuters |title=Iranian banks reconnected to SWIFT network after four-year hiatus |date= 17 February 2016|access-date= 21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, many Iranian observers including critics of [[Government of Hassan Rouhani (2013–present)|Rouhani's administration]], economists and private sector representatives claimed the news was false. According to ''[[Financial Times]]''{{'}}s report, Iran's banks are indeed being reconnected to SWIFT but there have been "too few" transactions because european and US banks are "worried about the risks" of dealing with them and "scarred by a string of multibillion-dollar fines".&lt;ref name= "SWIFT"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/04/iran-jcpoa-swift-sanctions-cbi-seif.html | first =Khatereh | last = Vatankhah |publisher= Al-Monitor |title= How sanctions relief became a tool in Iran's domestic battles |date=21 April 2016 |access-date= 21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three months after implementation, Iran was unable to tap about $100 billion held abroad. One 15 April 2016, [[Central Bank of the Islamic Republic of Iran|Central Bank of Iran]] Governor [[Valiollah Seif]] said in an interview with [[Bloomberg Television]] that Iran has gotten "almost nothing" from the accord. He also met [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of Treasury]] [[Jack Lew]] on the sidelines of his Washington's trip to discuss the concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-15/iran-seeks-access-to-its-100-billion-via-u-s-financial-system | first =Kambiz | last = Foroohar |publisher= Bloomberg |title= Iran Seeks Access to Its $100 Billion Via U.S. Financial System |date=15 April 2016 |access-date= 21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Josh Earnest]], the White House Press Secretary, said that "the agreement that's included in the JCPOA does not include giving Iran access to the US financial system or to allow the execution of so-called [[U-turn (banking)|U-turn transactions]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Iran deal excludes access to US financial system: White House |url=http://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2016/04/15/460963/US-Iran-nuclear-deal-sanctions-JCPOA/ |date=15 April 2016 |accessdate= 8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 April 2016, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] decided on ''[[Bank Markazi v. Peterson]]'' and ruled that almost $2 billion of [[Iranian frozen assets]] must be given to families of people killed in the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombings]]. The court accused Iran of being responsible for the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-iran-idUSKCN0XH1R6 | first = Lawrence | last = Hurley |publisher= Reuters |title= U.S. Supreme Court rejects Iran bank's bid to avoid payout to attack |date=20 April 2016 |access-date= 21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iranian foreign minister [[Mohammad Javad Zarif|Zarif]] called the ruling "highway robbery", lashing the court for its previous ruling of holding Iran responsible for [[9/11]], adding that the Supreme Court is "the Supreme Court of the United States, not the Supreme Court of the world.

On 27 November 2016, [[Schlumberger]], the largest oil service company in the world, announced that it had signed a preliminary deal to study an Iranian oil field. According to Schlumberger's spokesperson, this was a memorandum of understanding with the state-run National Iranian Oil Company "for the non-disclosure of data required for a technical evaluation of a field development prospect".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1= Faucon |first1=Benoit |title= Schlumberger Signs Early Oil Deal With Iran |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/schlumberger-signs-early-oil-deal-with-iran-1480284897 |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=27 November 2016 |accessdate=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scientific====
{{see also|Science and technology in Iran}}
In July 2015, Richard Stone wrote in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' in July 2015 that if the agreement is fully implemented, "Iran can expect a rapid expansion of scientific cooperation with Western powers. As its nuclear facilities are repurposed, scientists from Iran and abroad will team up in areas such as [[nuclear fusion]], [[astrophysics]], and radioisotopes for [[cancer therapy]]."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Stone, [http://www.sciencemag.org/content/349/6246/356.summary "In Depth: Nuclear Diplomacy: Iran nuclear deal holds 'goodies' for scientists"], ''Science'', Vol. 349 no. 6246 pp. 356–57, [[doi:10.1126/science.349.6246.356]].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Diplomatic====
In August 2015, the [[Embassy of the United Kingdom, Tehran|British embassy in Tehran]] reopened almost four years after it was closed after [[2011 attack on the British Embassy in Iran|protesters attacked the embassy in 2011]].&lt;ref name= "Embassy Reopening"&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-34031615 "British embassy in Tehran reopens four years after closure"], BBC News (23 August 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; At a reopening ceremony, Hammond said that since Rouhani's election as president, British-Iranian relations had gone from a "low point" to steady "step-by-step" improvement.&lt;ref name= "Embassy Reopening" /&gt; Hammond said: "Last month's historic nuclear agreement was another milestone, and showed the power of diplomacy, conducted in an atmosphere of mutual respect, to solve shared challenges. Re-opening the embassy is the logical next step to build confidence and trust between two great nations."&lt;ref name= "Embassy Reopening"/&gt; The [[BBC News|BBC]]'s diplomatic correspondent, Jonathan Marcus, reported that the nuclear agreement "had clearly been decisive in prompting the UK embassy to be reopened", stating that British-Iranian "ties have slowly been warming but it is clearly the successful conclusion of the nuclear accord with Iran that has paved the way for the embassy reopening".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-34005241 "UK embassy in Tehran to reopen after thaw in British-Iranian relations"], BBC News (20 August 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, ''The Observer'' revealed that the White House had hired an Israeli intelligence firm in May 2017 to search for unsavory information on Obama administration officials [[Ben Rhodes (White House staffer)|Ben Rhodes]] and Colin Kahl. Former UK Foreign Secretary [[Jack Straw]] said that these efforts by Trump and Netanyahu appear to have been intended "not so much to discredit the [Iran] deal but to undermine those around it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Townsend|first1=Mark|last2=Borger|first2=Julian|title=Revealed: Trump team hired spy firm for 'dirty ops' on Iran arms deal|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/05/trump-team-hired-spy-firm-dirty-ops-iran-nuclear-deal|accessdate=10 May 2018|publisher=The Observer|date=5 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continued tensions===
After the adoption of the JCPOA, the United States imposed several new non-nuclear [[U.S. sanctions against Iran|sanctions against Iran]], some of which were condemned by Iran as possible violations of the deal. According to [[Seyed Mohammad Marandi]], professor at the [[University of Tehran]], the general consensus in Iran while the negotiations were taking place was that the United States would move towards increasing sanctions on non-nuclear areas. He said that these post-JCPOA sanctions could "severely damage the chances for the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action bearing fruit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://english.irib.ir/analysis/commentaries/item/220843-%E2%80%98the-only-thing-washington-has-not-blamed-iran-for-is-global-warming%E2%80%99 |title=The only thing Washington has not blamed Iran for is global warming}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.rt.com/op-edge/327666-iran-washington-global-sanctions/ |title=The only thing Washington has not blamed Iran for is global warming |publisher=RT International}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{POV statement|Sources appear to be Russian and Iranian propaganda organs RT and IRIB|date=January 2016}}

As part of the exchange, the U.S. government dropped charges and [[Interpol red notice]]s against "14 Iranians for whom it was assessed that extradition requests were unlikely to be successful." Senior U.S. officials defended the agreement as a good deal for the U.S., but some Justice Department officials and FBI and DHS agents were critical because this disrupted the National Counterproliferation Initiative efforts "to lure top Iranian targets into traveling internationally in order to arrest them".&lt;ref&gt;Josh Meyer, [http://www.politico.com/story/2017/04/24/obama-iran-nuclear-deal-prisoner-release-236966 Obama's hidden Iran deal giveaway], ''Politico'' (24 April 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continued criticism===
{{Main|Criticism of the Iran nuclear deal}}
Shahi Hamid of ''The Atlantic'' wrote that the agreement "had a narrow—if understandable—focus on the minutia of Iran's nuclear program", and "[t]he Obama administration repeatedly underscored that the negotiations weren't about Iran's other activities in the region: They were about the nuclear program."&lt;ref&gt;Shadi Hamid, [https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/07/iran-nuclear-deal-consequences-obama/398780/ "Was the Iran Deal Worth It?"], ''The Atlantic'' (16 July 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. government and observers noted from the time that the framework was entered into in April 2015 "that the United States and Iran still find themselves on opposite sides of most of the conflicts that have pitched the Arab world into chaos" and that the agreement was "unlikely" to cause Iran to become a firm partner of the West.&lt;ref&gt;Doyle McManus, [http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-0405-mcmanus-mideast-foreign-policy-chaos-20150405-column.html "Nuclear deal unlikely to make Iran a docile U.S. partner"], ''Los Angeles Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The narrow nuclear non-proliferation focus of the deal was criticized by the agreement's opponents (such as Lawrence J. Hass of the [[American Foreign Policy Council]]), who argued that the agreement was faulty because it did not address anti-Semitism and threats against Israel, hostility and rhetoric against America and the West in general, illegal missile testing, supplying of arms to terrorist groups, and efforts to destabilize ongoing conflicts in Syria and Yemen.&lt;ref name="USNews-Gamble"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/world-report/2015/04/07/obamas-iran-nuclear-deal-will-likely-embolden-tehrans-anti-americanism |title=Obama's Ill-Advised Gamble: The president's approach to Iran is unlikely to outlast him |last1=Haas |first1=Lawrence J. |date=7 April 2015 |work=U.S. News and World Report |access-date= 13 March 2016 |quote=Now with Iran, the question is whether the past will prove prologue—or Obama's gamble will bear fruit. Anyone would hope that a nuclear deal, which will boost Iran's economy by lifting sanctions, would moderate the regime, thus easing Israeli worries, reducing Sunni-Shiite infighting and stabilizing the region.&lt;br /&gt;The smart money, however, would bet that the deal, which paves the way for eventual Iranian nuclear weaponry, will embolden the regime to double-down on its anti-Americanism, anti-Semitism and hegemonic activism. That, in turn, will force a change in approach to Iran by whoever follows Obama in the Oval Office.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015 ''The Wall Street Journal'' noted that Iran had recently carried out ballistic missile tests, announced the conviction of [[The Washington Post|''Washington Post'']] journalist [[Jason Rezaian]], launched military operations to maintain Bashar al-Assad's administration in Syria, and continued shipping arms and money to Houthi rebels in Yemen, the latter two actions fueling fears of a broader regional war.&lt;ref name="WSJ-Tensions"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/despite-nuclear-accord-u-s-iran-tensions-are-on-the-rise-1444688916?cb=logged0.3923896870723993 |title=Despite Nuclear Accord, U.S.-Iran Tensions Are on the Rise: Conviction of U.S. journalist, testing of ballistic missiles heighten concerns among deal's U.S. critics |last1=Solomon |first1=Jay |date=12 October 2015 |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |access-date=13 March 2016 |quote=Tensions between the United States and Iran, rather than easing as a result of July's nuclear accord, are increasing over a wide spectrum of issues tied to the broader Middle East security landscape and to domestic Iranian politics, current and former U.S. officials say. Just in the past two days, Iran has test-fired a ballistic missile and announced the conviction of American journalist Jason Rezaian, fueling suspicions the historic nuclear agreement has allowed Tehran's Islamist clerics to step up their long-held anti-U.S. agenda. Washington's closest Mideast allies, particularly Israel and Saudi Arabia, are more broadly concerned about Iran's ability to use the diplomatic cover provided by the nuclear accord—and the promised release of tens of billions of dollars of frozen oil revenues—to strengthen its regional position and that of its allies. Iran last month launched a joint military operation with Russia in Syria aimed at stabilizing the administration of President Bashar al-Assad, Tehran's closest regional ally, according to Iranian and Russian officials. Iran has also continued to ship arms and money to Houthi rebels in Yemen, who seized the country's capital this year but are now facing an expansive counteroffensive led by Saudi Arabia, according to Arab officials. Fears are mounting in Washington and Europe that these two conflicts could fuel a much broader regional war, in which Iran and Saudi Arabia are the chief protagonists. ... Mr. Obama's critics in Washington are accusing the White House of having been duped by Moscow and Tehran in the late stages of the talks.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the administration was also accused of whitewashing Iran's failure to cooperate fully with the IAEA investigation into the possible military dimensions of its past nuclear work.&lt;ref name="WSJ-Adoption"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/iran-nuclear-deal-formally-adopted-1445195172 |title=Iran Nuclear Deal Formally Adopted: U.S. plays down some concerns that Iran hasn't done enough to answer IAEA questions |last1=Schwartz |first1=Felicia |last2=Solomon |first2=Jay |date=19 October 2015 |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |access-date=13 March 2016 |quote=Concerns from opponents of the deal continued to grow, however, as senior administration officials during the weekend played down the importance of a United Nations probe into whether Tehran has attempted to secretly develop the technologies needed to build atomic weapons. The U.N.'s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, is committed under the deal to release a report by year-end about the status of Iran's alleged weaponization work. U.S. officials over the weekend said the IAEA report would have no bearing on moves by the international community to lift sanctions. The shifting U.S. position is stoking criticism from Republicans, who say the White House is essentially agreeing to whitewash the weaponization issue. They also charged Iran with growing more belligerent since the July nuclear agreement, with Tehran testing a ballistic missile this month and convicting a Washington Post journalist of espionage. 'In a key test of its commitment to the nuclear agreement, Iran has given minimum cooperation to international inspectors attempting to determine the extent of Iran's past bomb work,' said Rep. Ed Royce (R, Calif.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. 'If this is what the last 90 days look like, the next few years look like a disaster.'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015, ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, "[a]nyone who hoped that Iran's nuclear agreement with the United States and other powers portended a new era of openness with the West has been jolted with a series of increasingly rude awakenings over the past few weeks."&lt;ref name="NYT-RudeAwakening"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/04/world/middleeast/backlash-against-us-in-iran-seems-to-gather-force-after-nuclear-deal.html?smprod=nytcore-iphone&amp;smid=nytcore-iphone-share&amp;_r=2 |title=Backlash Against U.S. in Iran Seems to Gather Force After Nuclear Deal |last1=Erdbrink |first1=Thomas |date=3 November 2015 |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Times'' reported, variously, that the Iranian government had invited a Lebanese-American to visit the country, and then arrested him for spying; the Ayatollah made a public statement that the slogan "Death to America" was "eternal"; a wave of anti-American billboards went up in the capital; a backlash by political hard-liners began and the Revolutionary Guard intelligence apparatus "started rounding up journalists, activists and cultural figures"; state media circulated conspiracy theories about the United States, including that the CIA had downed a Russian civilian passenger jet in Egypt; Iranian and Lebanese citizens in Iran holding dual American citizenship were targeted for arrest on charges of "spying"; clothing manufacturers were prohibited from selling items featuring the American or British flags; and a state-sponsored demonstration was held outside the former [[Embassy of the United States, Tehran|U.S. embassy in Tehran]] on the anniversary of the takeover and hostage crisis in 1979.&lt;ref name="NYT-RudeAwakening" /&gt;

''[[Business Insider]]'' reported that a variety of factors made it more likely that Iran's stance would harden once the agreement was in place, with one Iran expert saying that Iran's "nice, smiling face" would now disappear as the country pursued more adversarial stances, and policy analysts saying that by negotiating the deal with the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, Obama had "made an investment in the stability of the [IRGC] regime".&lt;ref name="BusinessInsider-McDonalds"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/iran-nuclear-deal-backlash-2015-11 |title='McDonald's diplomacy': The nuclear deal has emboldened Iranian hardliners – and that shouldn't be a surprise |last=Bertrand |first=Natasha |date=7 November 2015 |publisher=Business Insider|access-date=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[National Review]]'' wrote that the U.S. administration's unwillingness to acknowledge any Iranian noncompliance had left the Iranians in control, and that the deal was undermining international security by emboldening Iran to act as a regional hegemon, at the expense of U.S. influence and credibility.&lt;ref name="NR-Disaster"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/429680/iran-nuclear-deal-worse-ever |title=The Obama Administration Races to Finalize a Bad Nuclear Deal |last=Fleitz |first=Fred |date=13 January 2016 |work=National Review |access-date=13 January 2016 |quote=The refusal by the United States and its allies to hold Iran accountable for launching ballistic missiles, failing to cooperate with the investigation, and amending the nuclear deal is a clear sign that they plan to ignore any Iranian noncompliance to protect the agreement. This means the nuclear agreement is essentially meaningless and puts Iran in the driver's seat. Iran also knows that the president and his Democratic supporters in Congress will never allow new sanctions to be imposed. This fecklessness has already been interpreted by Tehran as American weakness. This is why Iran has expanded its support to Syrian president Assad since July. This is why Iran continues to hold four innocent Americans prisoner and arrested another one plus a U.S. green-card holder last fall. This is why Iran has tested ballistic missiles and appears to be harassing U.S. naval vessels in the Persian Gulf. The profound damage the nuclear deal is causing to international security by emb oldening Iran, increasing its profile in the Middle East as a regional hegemon, and severely undermining American influence and credibility is now becoming clear.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Wall Street Journal'' editorial page editor Paul Gigot argued in February 2016 that Iran's prohibited missile tests, capture of U.S. naval personnel, and other provocations were a sign that rapprochement hoped for by Iran's Western negotiating partners was not going to happen, saying the government had no interest in accommodating U.S. interests, seeking instead to humiliate the United States and spread propaganda.

[[James S. Robbins]], an American political commentator and a senior fellow on the [[American Foreign Policy Council]], criticized the nuclear deal as "impotent" because it does not limit Iran's ballistic missile program, and UNSC Resolution 2231, which was adopted along with the deal, weakened the limits Iran's ballistic missile program that had been imposed by previous UNSC resolutions.&lt;ref name="USNews-ImpotentDeal"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/world-report/articles/2016-03-15/iran-missile-test-reveals-weakness-of-nuclear-deal |title=Iran Shoots a Hole in the Nuclear Deal: Iran's recent missile test highlights one more weakness in the Obama administration's nuclear accord. |last1=Robbins |first=James S. |work=U.S. News &amp; World Report |access-date=25 March 2015 |quote=The United States is quickly discovering how tragically impotent the nuclear deal with Iran is.

It seems that the nuclear deal may make it difficult, if not impossible, to rein in Tehran's ballistic missile ambitions.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 March 2016, Olli Heinonen, former Deputy Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, wrote "the International Atomic Energy Agency's most recent report on Iran's nuclear activities provides insufficient details on important verification and monitoring issues," and said that the report's lack of detailed data prevented the international community from verifying whether Iran was complying with the deal.&lt;ref name="FDDviaHKS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://belfercenter.hks.harvard.edu/publication/26374/iaeas_latest_report_falls_short.html |title=The IAEA's Latest Report Falls Short |last=Heinonen |first=Olli |date=4 March 2016 |via=Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, Harvard Kennedy School |publisher=Foundation for the Defense of Democracies |quote=The International Atomic Energy Agency's most recent report on Iran's nuclear activities provides insufficient details on important verification and monitoring issues.

On 20 March 2017, the Trump administration formally certified that Iran was in compliance with JCPOA, but added that the country will be subject to non-nuclear, terrorism related, sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/11/11/can-trump-walk-away-from-iran-deal.html|title=Can Trump walk away from the Iran deal?|first=Michael|last=Rubin |authorlink=Michael Rubin |date=11 November 2016|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=6 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Trump administration refused to recertify Iran's compliance in October 2017, however, citing multiple violations.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-iran-nuclear-deal-announcement-live-updates/|title=Trump: W.H.

===Violations===
On 9 November 2016 [[Deutsche Welle]], citing an alleged source from the IAEA, reported that "Iran has violated the terms of its nuclear deal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= UN agency IAEA reports Iran has again violated terms of nuclear deal |url=http://www.dw.com/en/un-agency-iaea-reports-iran-has-again-violated-terms-of-nuclear-deal/a-36331576 | work = Deutsche Welle |accessdate= 11 November 2016 |quote=Iran has violated the terms of its nuclear deal, according to the UN's nuclear monitoring agency.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 December 2016, the U.S. Senate voted to renew the [[Iran and Libya Sanctions Act|Iran Sanctions Act (ISA)]] for another decade. The Obama Administration and outside experts said the extension would have no practical effect and risked antagonizing Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=1 December 2016 |title= The Senate Vote to Extend Iran Sanctions Is A Symbolic Move that Could Antagonize Tehran | first =Jessica | last = Schulberg | work =The Huffington Post |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/senate-vote-iran-sanctions-act-extension_us_58406bfce4b09e21702d5ace}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah [[Ali Khamenei|Khamenei]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-nuclear-usa-sanctions-idUSKBN13Q5JW |title= US, Iran nuclear deal: USA sanctions |accessdate= 2 December 2016 |deadurl=yes | work = Reuters |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202010625/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-nuclear-usa-sanctions-idUSKBN13Q5JW |archivedate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Hassan Rouhani|Rouhani]],&lt;ref name= tasnim-isa/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=4 December 2016 |title= President Rouhani Warns of Iran's Firm Response to Implementation of ISA by Washington |url=http://en.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13950914000416 |publisher= Fars News Agency |accessdate= 6 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman said that the extension of sanctions would be a breach of the nuclear deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= US Senate Vote to Extend Iran Sanctions Contrary to JCPOA: Spokesman |date=2 December 2016 |publisher= Tasnim News Agency |url=https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2016/12/02/1255461/us-senate-vote-to-extend-iran-sanctions-contrary-to-jcpoa-spokesman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Iranian officials said that Iran might ramp up uranium enrichment in response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Why Iran's nuclear program is back on US agenda | first =Howard | last = LaFranchi |date= 1 December 2016 | work = The Christian Science Monitor |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Foreign-Policy/2016/1201/Why-Iran-s-nuclear-program-is-back-on-US-agenda}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In January 2017, representatives from Iran, P5+1 and EU gathered in Vienna's Palais Coburg hotel to address Iran's complaint about the US congressional bill.&lt;ref name=tasnim-isa&gt;{{cite news | title=JCPOA Joint Commission Meeting Concludes with Press Release |url=https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2017/01/11/1293517/jcpoa-joint-commission-meeting-concludes-with-press-release |publisher= [[Tasnim News Agency]] |location= 12th Avenue, Mirzaye Shirazi Street, Tehran, Iran |date=11 January 2017 |access-date= 31 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Trump administration said that Trump personally lobbied dozens of European officials against doing business with Iran during the May [[2017 Brussels summit]]; this likely violated the terms of the JCPOA, which expressly states that the U.S. may not pursue "any policy specifically intended to directly and adversely affect the normalization of trade and economic relations with Iran". The Trump administration certified in July 2017 that Iran had upheld its end of the agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Aleem |first=Zeeshan |url=https://www.vox.com/2017/7/21/16003746/trump-iran-deal-zarif |title=Iran says the US is violating the nuclear deal.

The IAEA, EU, Russia and China have all affirmed that Iran is respecting the limitations on its nuclear program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/31/iran-nuclear-deal-trump-un|title=Iran is adhering to nuclear deal limits, UN says, despite Donald Trump claim|first=Julian|last=Borger|date=1 September 2017|newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=6 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IAEA, the foremost authority on the matter, has repeatedly deemed Iran in compliance with the nuclear deal. The U.S. State Department has also certified that Iran is holding up its end of the bargain, and a host of experts affirmed these findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=14 June 2017 |author=John Kruzel |url=http://www.politifact.com/georgia/statements/2017/jun/14/karen-handel/iran-complying-nuclear-deal-yes-small-hiccups/ |title=Iran complying with the nuclear deal, with 'small hiccups' |publisher=PolitiFact |accessdate=6 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; IAEA Director General Amano said that "Iran is subject to the world's most robust nuclear verification regime."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/pressreleases/statement-by-iaea-director-general-yukiya-amano|title=Statement by IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano|date=13 October 2017 |publisher=IAEA |accessdate=6 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to [[David Makovsky]], a Middle East scholar at the [[Washington Institute for Near East Policy]], Iran was not in compliance, because under the terms of the deal, Iran was supposed to reveal all of its research into nuclear weapons, and that based on evidence presented by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on April 30, 2018, "it seems clear that they did not."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/5262607/netanyahu-trump-iran-deal-speech/|title=Netanyahu's Iran Deal Speech Really Had an Audience of One|website=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal Status==
In a letter sent to then U.S. Representative Mike Pompeo, the U.S. State Department said that the JCPOA "is not a treaty or an executive agreement, and is not a signed document".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/iran-nuclear-deal-not-signed-document-not-binding/|title=A Trip Down Memory Lane: In 2015 the Obama Administration Said the Iran Deal Wasn’t Even a ‘Signed Document’|last=French|first=David|date=10 May 2018|website=National Review|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180513074547/https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/iran-nuclear-deal-not-signed-document-not-binding/|archive-date=13 May 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=14 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Congressional Research Service, different definitions for 'treaty' are used in international law and in domestic U.S. law.  Under the [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]] "The term "[[treaty]]" has a broader meaning under international law than under domestic law. Under international law, "treaty" refers to any binding international agreement. Vienna Convention, art. 1(a). Under domestic law, "treaty" signifies only those binding international agreements that have received the advice and consent of the Senate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R44761.pdf|title=Withdrawal from International Agreements: Legal Framework, the Paris Agreement, and the Iran Nuclear Agreement|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Denial of Re-certification==
{{see also|Iran's 2018 lawsuit at ICJ against the United States}}
On 13 October 2017, U.S. President Donald Trump announced that he would not make the certification required under the [[Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015|Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act]], accusing Iran of violating the "spirit" of the deal and calling on the U.S. Congress and international partners to "address the deal's many serious flaws so that the Iranian regime can never threaten the world with nuclear weapons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-iran-nuclear-deal-announcement-live-updates/|title= Trump: W.H. "cannot and will not" certify Iran's compliance| work =CBS News |accessdate= 6 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Declaring that he would not decide to certify the deal, President Trump left it to Congress whether to reimpose sanctions on Iran and "blow up" the deal. However, Trump's aides sought to enact rules indicating how the United States could "reimpose sanctions" and the president listed three items which could provide such a "trigger" for leaving the deal: Iran's intercontinental ballistic missile, Iranian rejection of "an extension of the deal's existing constraint on its nuclear activities", and "evidence that Iran could manufacture a bomb in less than 12 months". Trump described the deal as "one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1= Landler |first1=Mark |last2=E.

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani stated that getting out from the Iran nuclear deal would "carry a high cost" for the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1= Millward|first1=David|title=Iranian president Hassan Rouhani warns US would pay "high cost" for scrapping nuclear deal |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/09/18/iranian-president-hassan-rouhani-warns-us-would-pay-high-cost/|work=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also he said that no president was allowed to "single-handedly revoke" the deal signed by the UN.&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;{{cite news |last1= Shugerman|first1=Emily|title= ran nuclear deal: EU condemns Donald Trump's decision to decertify agreement |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/iran-nuclear-deal-trump-eu-federica-mogherini-netanyahu-israel-a7999556.html|newspaper= The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Trump said that he "cannot and will not" recertify the nuclear deal with Iran, Theresa May, Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel supported the deal in a joint statement. The European Union's foreign policy chief, Mogherini said that the agreement was working well and that no one country could break the deal concluded by Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China and the European Union. She suggested a "collective process" for keeping the deal. Russia's foreign minister confirmed that Iran was abiding by the nuclear deal.&lt;ref name="independent" /&gt;

===Consequences of US withdrawal===
The Iranian currency dropped significantly right after Trump announced the US withdrawal. The leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, stated: "I said from the first day: don't trust America".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Iran warns Trump: 'You've made a mistake'|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44057306|work=BBC News|date=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American flag was set on fire in Iran's Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/video_and_audio/headlines/44055625/iranian-politicians-set-fire-to-us-flag-in-parliament|title=Video experience headlines|website=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next evening, May 9, according to [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] sources, Iranian Revolutionary Guard [[Quds Force]]s based in Syria launched rockets at Israeli military targets. Reporters for CNN said that, "if confirmed," it appears to be "the first time Iranian forces have fired rockets directly at Israeli forces."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Liebermann|first1=Oren|last2=Abdelaziz|first2=Salma|title=Netanyahu says Iran 'crossed a red line' after Israel pounds Iranian targets in Syria|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/05/09/middleeast/israel-rockets-syria/index.html|accessdate=10 May 2018|publisher=CNN|date=10 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ali Khamenei's conditions for Europe to preserve the JCPOA===

Following the U.S. withdrawal from JCPOA, Iran supreme leader [[Ali Khamenei]] presented 7 conditions for Europe to meet its commitments.  Among these conditions, he said European powers must set up steps to preserve business relations with Iranian banks and purchase Iranian oil despite U.S. pressure.  He also said there was no need to hold new discussions about Iran's [[ballistic missile]] program and regional activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Staff|first1=Reuters|title=Iran's top leader sets 7 conditions to remain in nuclear deal -official website|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/iran-nuclear-khamenei-conditions/irans-top-leader-sets-7-conditions-to-remain-in-nuclear-deal-official-website-idUSL5N1SU6LJ|accessdate=10 May 2018|publisher=Reuters|date=23 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Klondike Big Inch Land''' promotion was a  [[marketing]] promotion run by the [[Quaker Oats Company]] in 1955 and created by Bruce Baker, a Chicago advertising executive.

== Inception ==
Quaker Oats bought 19.11 acres of land in the [[Yukon Territory]] of [[Canada]] for the price of $1000 USD and printed up 21 million deeds for one square inch of land.  On advice of counsel, Quaker Oats set up and transferred the land to the Great Klondike Big Inch Land Company to make the company the registered owner and manager of the deeds.

Starting on January 1955, 93 newspapers across the United States ran advertisements that read "Get a real deed to one square inch of land in the Yukon gold rush country" and, "You'll actually own one square inch of Yukon land".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Folks still make claims in Sgt. Preston's Yukon|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1946&amp;dat=19860920&amp;id=tlkiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XqgFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1066,5068721|accessdate=30 December 2012|newspaper=The Montreal Gazette|date=1986-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The promotion was tied to the ''[[Challenge of the Yukon|Sergeant Preston of the Yukon]]'' radio show which Quaker Oats was sponsoring at the time.

== Obtaining Deeds ==
The promotion instructed people to mail a form along with a box top from either Quaker Puffed Wheat, Quaker Puffed Rice or Muffets Shredded Wheat to the Quaker Oats company.  In turn, a 5 by 8 inch deed to one square inch of land in the Klondike was sent back.  In February 1955, Quaker Oats was blocked from trading the deed for a box top by the Ohio Securities Division until it received a state license for the "sale" of foreign land.&lt;ref name="Akron Beacon"&gt;{{cite web|last=Price|first=Mark J.|title=Local history: Quaker Oats prize creates Yukon land rush in 1955|url=http://www.ohio.com/lifestyle/history/local-history-quaker-oats-prize-creates-yukon-land-rush-in-1955-1.257639|publisher=Akron Beacon Journal Online|accessdate=30 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; To get around the injunction, the company stopped the trade-in offer and instead put one of the deeds in each box of cereal produced.

Since none of the deeds were actually registered, the documents were never legally binding and owners of these deeds were never actual owners of any land.  The deed excluded mineral rights on the property.&lt;ref name="Yahoo 1955 Quaker Oats" /&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=June 2015}}

== Afterwards ==
Due to $37.20 in back taxes, the land was repossessed by the Canadian government in 1965, and the Great Klondike Big Inch Land Company dissolved in 1966.  The land is now part of the [[Dawson City, Yukon|Dawson City]] Golf Course.&lt;ref name="Yahoo 1955 Quaker Oats"&gt;{{cite web|last=Summers|first=Vincent|title=1955 Quaker Oats Yukon Land Giveaway: Deeds on "eBay"|url=http://voices.yahoo.com/1955-quaker-oats-yukon-land-giveaway-deeds-ebay-2889211.html?cat=27|accessdate=30 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130217032350/http://voices.yahoo.com/1955-quaker-oats-yukon-land-giveaway-deeds-ebay-2889211.html?cat=27|archivedate=17 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=June 2015}}

To this day, Yukon officials receive letters and phone calls about the deeds. The land office of the Yukon currently contains an 18-inch thick file folder of correspondence regarding the promotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Klondike Big Inch|url=http://www.yukoninfo.com/klondikebiginch.htm|accessdate=30 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lady Lever Art Gallery''' is a [[museum]] founded and built by the industrialist and philanthropist [[William Lever, 1st Viscount Leverhulme]] and opened in 1922. The Lady Lever Art Gallery is set in the garden village of [[Port Sunlight]], on the [[Wirral Peninsula|Wirral]] and one of the [[National Museums Liverpool]].&lt;ref name=NML&gt;[http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/ National Museums Liverpool]&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum is a significant surviving example of late [[Victorian era|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian]] taste. It houses major collections of fine and decorative art that are an expression of Lord Leverhulme’s personal taste and collecting interests. The collection is strong in British 19th-century painting and sculpture, spilling over to include late 18th-century and early 20th works. There are important collections of English furniture, [[Wedgwood]], especially [[jasperware]], and [[Chinese ceramics]], and smaller groups of other types of objects, such as Ancient Greek vases and Roman sculpture. The majority of objects were part of the original donation, but the collection has continued to expand at a modest rate. The museum displays mostly mixed paintings, sculpture and furniture together, and there are five "Period Rooms" recreating typical period interiors from large houses.

==History==
Lever began collecting art in the late 19th century, largely to use in advertising for the popular Sunlight Soap brand (manufactured a few minutes' walk from the gallery) that helped to create his fortune.  As he grew richer his collections began to expand, his confidence grew as well and he developed a taste for collecting. He mostly collected British art, but he was also fascinated by Chinese art,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/ladylever/collections/chinese/ "Chinese collection - online catalogue", A record of the collection formed by the 1st Viscount Leverhulme (1851-1925)"]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roman sculpture]] and [[Greek vases]], which he had chosen to collect to show styles that had influenced British artists in the eighteenth and the nineteenth centuries.

In 2015 part of the museum was closed for building works, with little of the ceramics collections on display, but most of the other collections. A touring exhibition visited museums in Japan and elsewhere. The redeveloped South End galleries were restored to their original architecture style as part of a £2.8 million restoration project in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[https://vimeo.com/107707831 "Exciting plans for the Lady Lever Art Gallery"], from National Museums Liverpool&lt;/ref&gt; The work included opening up original doorways to increase the circulation of visitors, improving the lighting and restoring some of the original vaulted ceilings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=South End galleries - Lady Lever Art Gallery, Liverpool museums|url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/ladylever/about/new-galleries.aspx|website=www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collection==
The Gallery has good representation of several trends in [[Victorian painting]], including the [[Pre-Raphaelite]]s, both during the period of the Brotherhood and in their subsequent careers. Concern with social conditions, classical revivalism and later historical painting are all represented. There are important works by [[John Everett Millais|Millais]], [[Ford Madox Brown]], [[William Holman Hunt]], [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], [[Burne-Jones]], [[Frederic Leighton, 1st Baron Leighton|Lord Leighton]], and many others.  The museum has what appears to be the largest display in any museum of paintings by [[William Etty]].  Earlier works include those by Turner, [[Constable]], [[Thomas Gainsborough|Gainsborough]] and [[Joshua Reynolds|Reynolds]].

Much of the Wedgwood collection was from the collection of [[Dudley Marjoribanks, 1st Baron Tweedmouth]], bought in 1905. This in turn was partly formed from the collection of [[Charles Darwin]], [[Josiah Wedgwood]]'s grandson.  It is probably the best collection of jasperware in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/ladylever/collections/wedgwood/index.aspx Collections, "Wedgwood"], www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

The collection includes:
*''[[A Dream of the Past: Sir Isumbras at the Ford]]''
*''[[Bubbles (painting)|Bubbles]]''
*''[[Cromwell on his Farm]]''
*''[[The Black Brunswicker (Millais)|The Black Brunswicker]]''
*''[[The Blessed Damozel]]''
*''[[The Scapegoat (painting)|The Scapegoat]]''
*''[[The Beguiling of Merlin]]''
* Several examples of [[New Sculpture]] including works by:
**[[Edward Onslow Ford]]
**[[John Gibson (sculptor)|John Gibson]]
**[[William Goscombe John]]
**[[F. W. Pomeroy]]

==The Building==
Commissioned in 1913 from architects William and Segar Owen, the ''Lady Lever Art Gallery'' was built in the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=The Public Catalogue Foundation. Coord.: Siobhan|title=Oil paintings in public ownership in national museums of Liverpool.|date=2013|publisher=The Public Catalogue Foundation|location=[S.l.]|isbn=978-1-909475-08-3|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The building was opened in 1922 by [[Princess Beatrice of the United Kingdom|Princess Beatrice]], the youngest daughter of [[Queen Victoria]].

There are eight [[sovereign state]]s that have successfully detonated [[nuclear weapon]]s.&lt;ref name="nuclearweapons1"/&gt; [[United Nations Security Council#Permanent members|Five]] are considered to be '''nuclear-weapon states''' (NWS) under the terms of the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons]] (NPT).

Since the NPT entered into force in 1970, three states that were not parties to the Treaty have conducted [[nuclear testing|nuclear tests]], namely [[India and weapons of mass destruction|India]], [[Pakistan and weapons of mass destruction|Pakistan]], and [[North Korea and weapons of mass destruction|North Korea]].

Viotti - 2010, p 312&lt;/ref&gt; and the former [[Soviet]] republics [[Belarus]], [[Kazakhstan]], and [[Ukraine]].

According to [[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]] Nuclear Notebook, the total number of nuclear weapons worldwide is estimated at 9,220 in 2017.&lt;ref name=thebulletin-2017&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thebulletin.org/nuclear-notebook-multimedia |title=Nuclear Notebook |publisher=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |year=2017 |accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Weapons of mass destruction}}
The following is a list of [[Sovereign state|states]] that have admitted the possession of nuclear weapons or are presumed to possess them, the approximate number of [[warhead]]s under their control, and the year they tested their first weapon and their force configuration. This list is informally known in global politics as the "Nuclear Club".&lt;ref&gt;"Nuclear club", ''Oxford English Dictionary'': "nuclear club n. the nations that possess nuclear weapons." The term's first cited usage is from 1957.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jane Onyanga-Omara, [https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/01/06/nine-nations-possess-nuclear-weapns/78350588/ "The Nuclear Club: Who are the 9 members?"], ''USA TODAY'', 6 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of Russia and the United States (which have subjected their nuclear forces to independent verification under various treaties) these figures are estimates, in some cases quite unreliable estimates. In particular, under the [[Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty]] thousands of Russian and U.S. nuclear warheads are inactive in stockpiles awaiting processing. The fissile material contained in the warheads can then be recycled for use in [[Nuclear reactor technology|nuclear reactors]].

From a high of 68,000 active weapons in 1985, {{as of|2016|lc=on}} there are some 4,000 active nuclear warheads and 10,100 total nuclear warheads in the world.&lt;ref name="nuclearweapons1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/programs/ssp/nukes/nuclearweapons/nukestatus.html |title=Federation of American Scientists: Status of World Nuclear Forces |publisher=Fas.org |date= 2016|accessdate=2017-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the decommissioned weapons were simply stored or partially dismantled, not destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Webster, Paul (July/August 2003). "[https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2009/sep/06/nuclear-weapons-world-us-north-korea-russia-iran Nuclear weapons: how many are there in 2009 and who has them?]" ''The Guardian'', 6 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also noteworthy that since the dawn of the [[Atomic Age]], the delivery methods of most states with nuclear weapons has evolved with some achieving a [[nuclear triad]], while others have consolidated away from land and air deterrents to submarine-based forces.

"Deployed" indicates the total of deployed strategic and non-strategic warheads. Because the number of non-strategic warheads is unknown for many countries, this number should be taken as a minimum. When a range of weapons is given (e.g., 0–10), it generally indicates that the estimate is being made on the amount of fissile material that has likely been produced, and the amount of fissile material needed per warhead depends on estimates of a country's proficiency at nuclear weapon design.|group=nb}}

These five states are known to have detonated a nuclear explosive before 1 January 1967 and are thus nuclear weapons states under the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons]]. They also happen to be the [[UN Security Council]]'s permanent members with veto power on UNSC resolutions.

===United States===
{{Main article|Nuclear weapons and the United States|United States and weapons of mass destruction}}
The United States developed the first nuclear weapons during [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]] in cooperation with the United Kingdom and Canada as part of the [[Manhattan Project]], out of the fear that [[Nazi Germany]] would develop them first. It tested the first nuclear weapon on July 16, 1945 ("[[Trinity site|Trinity]]") at 5:30 am, and remains the only country to have used nuclear weapons in war, [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|devastating]] the Japanese cities of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]]. It was the first nation to develop the [[hydrogen bomb]], testing an experimental prototype in 1952 ("[[Ivy Mike]]") and a deployable weapon in 1954 ("[[Castle Bravo]]"). Throughout the [[Cold War]] it continued to modernize and enlarge its nuclear arsenal, but from 1992 on has been involved primarily in a program of [[Stockpile stewardship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Chuck|last=Hansen|title=U.S. nuclear weapons: The secret history|location=Arlington, TX |publisher=Aerofax|year=1988|isbn=978-0-517-56740-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Chuck|last=Hansen|title=The Swords of Armageddon: U.S. nuclear weapons development since 1945|location=Sunnyvale, CA |publisher=Chukelea Publications|year=1995|url=http://www.uscoldwar.com/|accessdate=2016-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen I.

===Russian Federation (formerly part of the Soviet Union)===
{{Main article|Russia and weapons of mass destruction|Strategic Missile Troops}}
{{See also|Soviet atomic bomb project}}
The Soviet Union tested its first nuclear weapon ("[[RDS-1]]") in 1949. This crash project was developed partially with information obtained via [[espionage]] during and after World War II. The Soviet Union was the second nation to have developed and tested a [[nuclear weapon]]. The direct motivation for Soviet weapons development was to achieve a balance of power during the Cold War. It tested its first megaton-range hydrogen bomb ("[[RDS-37]]") in 1955. The Soviet Union also tested the most powerful explosive ever detonated by humans, ("[[Tsar Bomba]]"), with a theoretical yield of 100 megatons, intentionally reduced to 50 when detonated. After its dissolution in 1991, the Soviet weapons entered officially into the possession of the Russian Federation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=David|last=Holloway|title=Stalin and the bomb: The Soviet Union and atomic energy, 1939-1956|location=New Haven, CT |publisher=Yale University Press|year=1994|isbn=978-0-300-06056-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet nuclear arsenal contained some 45,000 warheads at its peak (in 1986); the Soviet Union built about 55,000 nuclear warheads since 1949.&lt;ref name="NorrisKristensenGlobal" /&gt;

===United Kingdom===
{{Main article|Nuclear weapons and the United Kingdom|United Kingdom and weapons of mass destruction}}
The United Kingdom tested its first nuclear weapon ("[[Operation Hurricane|Hurricane]]") in 1952. The UK had provided considerable impetus and initial research for the early conception of the atomic bomb, aided by Austrian, German and Polish physicists working at British universities who had either fled or decided not to return to Nazi Germany or Nazi controlled territories. The UK collaborated closely with the United States and Canada during the Manhattan Project, but had to develop its own method for manufacturing and detonating a bomb as U.S. secrecy grew after 1945. The United Kingdom was the third country in the world, after the United States and Soviet Union, to develop and test a nuclear weapon. Its programme was motivated to have an independent deterrent against the Soviet Union, while also maintaining its status as a [[great power]]. It tested its first hydrogen bomb in 1957 ([[Operation Grapple]]), making it the third country to do so after the United States and Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Margaret|last=Gowing|title=Independence and deterrence: Britain and atomic energy, 1945-1952 |location=London |publisher=Macmillan |year=1974|isbn=978-0-333-15781-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Lorna|last=Arnold|title=Britain and the H-bomb|location=Basingstoke |publisher=Palgrave|year=2001|isbn=978-0-312-23518-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK maintained a fleet of [[V bomber]] [[strategic bombers]] and [[ballistic missile submarine|ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs)]] equipped with nuclear weapons during the Cold War. It currently maintains a fleet of four [[Vanguard class submarine|'Vanguard' class]] ballistic missile submarines equipped with [[Trident missile|Trident II missiles]]. In 2016, the UK House of Commons voted to renew the British nuclear weapons system with the [[Dreadnought-class submarine|''Dreadnought''-class submarine]], without setting a date for the commencement of service of a replacement to the current system.

===France===
{{Main article|France and weapons of mass destruction|Force de dissuasion}}
France tested its first nuclear weapon in 1960 ("[[Gerboise Bleue]]"), based mostly on its own research. It was motivated by the [[Suez Crisis]] diplomatic tension ''vis-à-vis'' both the Soviet Union and the [[Free World]] allies United States and United Kingdom. It was also relevant to retain great power status, alongside the United Kingdom, during the post-colonial Cold War (see: [[Force de frappe]]). France tested its first hydrogen bomb in 1968 ("[[Canopus (nuclear test)|Opération Canopus]]"). After the Cold War, France has disarmed 175 warheads with the reduction and modernization of its arsenal that has now evolved to a dual system based on [[submarine-launched ballistic missiles]] (SLBMs) and medium-range air-to-surface missiles ([[Rafale]] fighter-bombers).

China tested its first nuclear weapon device ("[[596 (nuclear test)|596]]") in 1964 at the [[Lop Nur]] test site. The weapon was developed as a deterrent against both the United States and the Soviet Union. Two years later, China had a fission bomb capable of being put onto a [[nuclear missile]]. It tested its first hydrogen bomb ("[[Chinese nuclear test No. 6|Test No. 6]]") in 1967, a mere 32 months after testing its first nuclear weapon (the shortest fission-to-fusion development known in history).&lt;ref&gt;John Wilson Lewis and Xue Litai, ''China Builds the Bomb'' (Stanford, Calif.: Stanford University Press, 1988). {{ISBN|0-8047-1452-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country is currently thought to have had a stockpile of around 240 warheads, though because of the limited information available, estimates range from 100 to 400.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070104084829/http://www.cdi.org/issues/nukef%26f/database/nukearsenals.cfm] [https://web.archive.org/web/20030225013334/http://cns.miis.edu:80/research/china/nuc/nstock.htm][http://www.armscontrolwonk.com/387/how-many-chinese-nuclear-weapons-redux-3]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norris, Robert S. and [[Hans M.

===India===
{{Main article|India and weapons of mass destruction}}

India is not a party to the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]]. India tested what it called a "[[Peaceful nuclear explosions|peaceful nuclear explosive]]" in 1974 (which became known as "[[Smiling Buddha]]"). The test was the first test developed after the creation of the NPT, and created new questions about how civilian nuclear technology could be diverted secretly to weapons purposes ([[Dual-use technology#Nuclear|dual-use technology]]). India's secret development caused great concern and anger particularly from nations, such as Canada, that had supplied [[CIRUS|its nuclear reactors]] for peaceful and power generating needs. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=18 MAY 1974 - SMILING BUDDAH|url=https://www.ctbto.org/specials/testing-times/18-may-1974-smiling-buddah|website=CTBTO|accessdate=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian officials rejected the NPT in the 1960s on the grounds that it created a world of nuclear "haves" and "have-nots", arguing that it unnecessarily restricted "peaceful activity" (including "peaceful nuclear explosives"), and that India would not accede to international control of their nuclear facilities unless all other countries engaged in [[unilateral disarmament]] of their own nuclear weapons. The Indian position has also asserted that the NPT is in many ways a neo-colonial regime designed to deny security to post-colonial powers.&lt;ref&gt;George Perkovich, ''India's Nuclear Bomb: The Impact on Global Proliferation'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1999), 120-121, and 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Even after its 1974 test, India maintained that its nuclear capability was primarily "peaceful", but between 1988 and 1990 it apparently weaponized two dozen nuclear weapons for delivery by air.&lt;ref&gt;George Perkovich, ''India's Nuclear Bomb: The Impact on Global Proliferation'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1999), 293–297.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998 India tested weaponized nuclear warheads ("[[Operation Shakti]]"), including a [[Thermonuclear weapon|thermonuclear device]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/India/IndiaShakti.html|title=India's Nuclear Weapons Program: Operation Shakti|year=1998|accessdate=2006-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2005, U.S. President [[George W.

===Pakistan===
{{Main article|Pakistan and weapons of mass destruction}}
Pakistan also is not a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Pakistan covertly developed nuclear weapons over decades, beginning in the late 1970s. Pakistan first delved into nuclear power after the establishment of its first nuclear power plant near [[Karachi]] with equipment and materials supplied mainly by western nations in the early 1970s. Pakistani President [[Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto]] promised in 1971 that if India could build nuclear weapons then Pakistan would too, according to him: "We will develop Nuclear stockpiles, even if we have to eat grass."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Sublettle | first =Carey | title =Historical Background: Zulfikar Ali Bhutto | work =Nuclear weapons archives | publisher =Federation of American Scientists (FAS) | date =15 October 1965|url=http://www.nuclearweaponarchive.org/Pakistan/PakOrigin.html | accessdate =19 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed that Pakistan has possessed nuclear weapons since the mid-1980s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nti.org/country-profiles/pakistan/ NTI Pakistan Profile], retrieved 22 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The United States continued to certify that Pakistan did not possess such weapons until 1990, when sanctions were imposed under the [[Larry Pressler#Pakistan and the Pressler Amendment|Pressler Amendment]], requiring a cutoff of U.S. economic and military assistance to Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iie.com/research/topics/sanctions/pakistan.cfm |title=Case Studies in Sanctions and Terrorism: Pakistan |publisher=Iie.com |date= |accessdate=2009-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, Pakistan conducted its first [[Chagai-I|six nuclear tests]] at the [[Ras Koh Hills]] in response to the five tests conducted by India a few weeks before.

In 2004, the Pakistani metallurgist [[Abdul Qadeer Khan]], a key figure in Pakistan's nuclear weapons program, confessed to heading an international [[black market]] ring involved in selling nuclear weapons technology. In particular, Khan had been selling [[gas centrifuge]] technology to North Korea, Iran, and Libya. Khan denied complicity by the Pakistani government or Army, but this has been called into question by journalists and IAEA officials, and was later contradicted by statements from Khan himself.&lt;ref&gt;See [[A.Q. Khan#Investigation, dismissal, confession, pardon and aftermath|A.Q. Khan: Investigation, dismissal, confession, pardon and aftermath]], for citations and details.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of early 2013, Pakistan was estimated to have had a stockpile of around 140 warheads,&lt;ref name="NucDec2017"/&gt; and in November 2014 it was projected that by 2020 Pakistan would have enough fissile material for 200 warheads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/Pakistan-to-have-200-nuclear-weapons-by-2020-US-think-tank/articleshow/45250170.cms | title=Pakistan to Have 200 Nuke Weapons by 2020: US Think Tank | publisher=The Times of india | date=November 2014 | accessdate=2014-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===North Korea===
{{Main article|North Korea and weapons of mass destruction}}
{{update section|date=June 2018}}
North Korea was a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, but announced a withdrawal on January 10, 2003, after the United States accused it of having a secret [[uranium enrichment]] program and cut off energy assistance under the 1994 [[Agreed Framework]]. In February 2005, North Korea claimed to possess functional nuclear weapons, though their lack of a test at the time led many experts to doubt the claim. However, in October 2006, North Korea stated that, in response to growing intimidation by the United States, it would conduct a nuclear test to confirm its nuclear status. North Korea reported a successful nuclear test on October 9, 2006 (see [[2006 North Korean nuclear test]]). Most U.S. intelligence officials believed that the test was probably only partially successful with a [[nuclear weapon yield|yield]] of less than a kiloton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2007/3/28/83234.shtml |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120904054137/http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2007/3/28/83234.shtml |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-09-04 |title=CIA's Hayden: North Korea Nuke Test 'Was a Failure' |publisher=Newsmax.com |date=2007-03-28 |accessdate=2009-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; North Korea conducted a second, higher yield test on 25 May 2009 (see [[2009 North Korean nuclear test]]) and a third test with still higher yield on 12 February 2013 (see [[2013 North Korean nuclear test]]). North Korea claimed to have conducted its first hydrogen-bomb test on 5 January 2016, though measurements of seismic disturbances indicate that the detonation was not consistent with a hydrogen bomb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=North Korea Test Shows Technical Advance |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=January 7, 2016 |volume=CCLXVII |issue=5 |page=A6}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 3 September 2017, North Korea detonated a device which caused a magnitude 6.1 tremor, consistent with a low-powered [[Thermonuclear weapon|thermonuclear]] detonation; NORSAR estimates the yield at 250 kilotons&lt;ref&gt;{{cit web|url=https://www.norsar.no/press/latest-press-release/archive/the-nuclear-explosion-in-north-korea-on-3-september-2017-a-revised-magnitude-assessment-article1548-984.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; of TNT.

==States formerly possessing nuclear weapons==
Nuclear weapons have been present in many nations, often as staging grounds under control of other powers. However, in only one instance has a nation given up nuclear weapons after being in full control of them. The [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|fall of the Soviet Union]] left several [[Post-Soviet states|former Soviet republics]] in physical possession of nuclear weapons, though not operational control which was dependent on Russian-controlled electronic [[Permissive Action Link]]s and the Russian command and control system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MNanc3lYUsQC |chapter=Why Ukraine gave up nuclear weapons : nonproliferation incentives and disincentives |author=William C.

===South Africa===
{{Main article|South Africa and weapons of mass destruction}}
South Africa produced six nuclear weapons in the 1980s, but dismantled them in the early 1990s.

In 1979, there was a detection of a putative covert nuclear test in the Indian Ocean, called the [[Vela incident]]. It has long been speculated that it was a test by Israel, in collaboration with and support of South Africa, though this has never been confirmed. South Africa could not have constructed such a nuclear bomb until November 1979, two months after the "double flash" incident.
South Africa signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fas.org/nuke/guide/rsa/nuke/index.html Nuclear Weapons Program (South Africa)], [[Federation of American Scientists]] (May 29, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Von Wielligh, N. &amp; von Wielligh-Steyn, L.

'''''Los Olvidados''''' ({{IPA-es|los olbiˈðaðos|pron}}, [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "The Forgotten Ones"), known in the U.S. as '''''The Young and the Damned''''', is a 1950 [[cinema of Mexico|Mexican film]] directed by [[Luis Buñuel]].&lt;ref name="imdb"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042804/|title=The Young and the Damned|publisher=IMDb|accessdate=19 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Óscar Dancigers, the producer, asked Buñuel to direct this film after the success of the 1949 film ''[[El Gran Calavera]]''. Buñuel already had a script ready titled ''¡Mi huerfanito jefe!'' about a boy who sells lottery tickets. However, Dancigers had in mind a more realistic and serious depiction of children in poverty in [[Mexico City]].

After conducting some research, Jesús Camacho and Buñuel came up with a script that Dancigers was pleased with. The film can be seen in the tradition of [[social realism]], although it also contains elements of [[surrealism]] present in much of Buñuel's work.

''Los Olvidados'' was widely criticized upon its initial release, but earned the [[Best Director Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Director]] award at the [[1951 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4106/year/1951.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Reckless |accessdate=2009-01-14|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now considered a masterpiece of Latin American cinema.

==Cast==
* [[Stella Inda]] as Pedro's Mother
* [[Miguel Inclán]] as Don Carmelo, the blind man
* [[Alfonso Mejía]] as Pedro
* [[Roberto Cobo]] as "El Jaibo"
* [[Alma Delia Fuentes]] as Meche
* '''Francisco Jambrina''' as the principal of the rural school
* '''Jesús Navarro''' as Julián's father
* '''Efraín Arauz''' as "Cacarizo"
* '''Jorge Pérez''' as "Pelón"
* '''Javier Amézcua''' as Julián
* '''Mário Ramírez''' as "Ojitos" ("Little Eyes"), the lost boy
* [[Ernesto Alonso]] as Narrator (uncredited)

==Plot==
The film is about a group of destitute children and their misfortunes in a [[Mexico City]] slum. El Jaibo escapes [[adolescence|juvenile]] jail and reunites with the street gang that he leads. They attempts to rob a [[blindness|blind]] [[street musician]] and, failing at first, later track him down, beat him, and destroy his instruments.

With the help of Pedro, El Jaibo tracks down Julián, the youngster who supposedly sent him to jail. El Jaibo puts his unharmed arm in a sling, hides a rock in it and confronts Julián, who denies that he reported him to the police and refuses to fight El Jaibo because it wouldn't be a fair fight. As Julián starts to walk away, El Jaibo hits him in the back of the head with the rock. He then beats Julián heavily with a stick and takes his money. El Jaibo warns Pedro not to report the crime and shares Julián's money with Pedro to make him an [[accomplice]].

Pedro's mother resents her son's behavior, and shows that she doesn't love or care for him. Pedro is saddened by this, vows to start behaving better and finds work as apprentice to a blacksmith. One day, El Jaibo comes to talk with him about their secret and, unbeknownst to Pedro, steals a customer's knife from the blacksmith's table. Pedro is accused of the crime and sent to a juvenile rehabilitation program, the "farm school," where he gets into a fight and kills two chickens. The principal tests Pedro by handing Pedro a 50 [[Mexican peso|pesos]] bill to run errands with. Pedro accepts and leaves with the intention to complete the errands. As soon as he leaves, he encounters El Jaibo, who steals the money. Upset that his attempt to be good was foiled again, Pedro tracks down El Jaibo and fights him. The fight ends in a stalemate, but Pedro announces to the crowd that it was El Jaibo who killed Julián. El Jaibo flees, but the blind man has heard the accusation and tells the police.

Pedro tracks El Jaibo down once again to murder him. El Jaibo kills Pedro. While fleeing, El Jaibo encounters the police and, as he tries to run away, the police shoot and kill him. Meche and her grandfather find Pedro's body in their shed. Not wanting to get involved, they dump his body down a garbage-covered cliff. On their way, they pass Pedro's mother, who, though once unconcerned with her disobedient child, is now searching for him.

== Alternate ending ==

In 2002, it was announced that an alternate ending for ''Los Olvidados'' (labeled "the happy ending") was discovered at the Film Warehouse of the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]], and it would be restored digitally in order to show it to the public. On July 8, 2005, it was re-screened with the alternate ending in a few selected venues and included in subsequent DVD releases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =La Jornada| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Restrenan en pantalla grande Los olvidados, con final inédito| work =| publisher =| date =8 July 2005| url =http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2005/07/08/a10n1esp.php| format =| doi =| accessdate =3 October 2011| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20100612102042/http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2005/07/08/a10n1esp.php| archivedate =12 June 2010| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

  | accessdate = 3 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the International Cinematographic Festival in Saltillo, Coahuila, Mexico, on February 3, 2011, the last surviving member of the cast, Alfonso Mejía (Pedro), introduced the alternative ending to the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | last = Vanguardia
  | first =

  | coauthors = 
  | title = Un 'olvidado' en Saltillo
  | work =

  | url = http://www.vanguardia.com.mx/unolvidadoensaltillo-643875.html
  | doi = 
  | accessdate = 3 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Mejía, Buñuel was "pressured by the censorship in Mexico, and urged  to film an alternative ending, a conventional ending, to maintain the image of a progressive Mexico, where no one was poor or illiterate" (you can view the interview {{YouTube|mM4_El2XbvQ|here}}).

The alternative ending begins with El Jaibo and Pedro fighting in an abandoned warehouse. Pedro pushes El Jaibo from the roof, where he falls to his death. Pedro frisks the body for the money El Jaibo stole from him (in contrast to the original ending, where Pedro is murdered by El Jaibo). Pedro returns to the farm school with the money that the principal entrusted to him.

== Analysis ==
Thematically, ''Los Olvidados'' is similar to Buñuel's earlier Spanish film, ''[[Las Hurdes]]''. Both films deal with the never-ending cycle of poverty and despair. ''Los Olvidados'' is especially interesting because although “Buñuel employed … elements of [[Italian neorealism]],” a concurrent movement across the Atlantic Ocean marked by “outdoor locations, nonprofessional actors, low budget productions, and a focus on the working classes,” ''Los Olvidados'' is not a neorealist film (Fernandez, 42).  “Neorealist reality is incomplete, conventional, and above all rational,” Buñuel  wrote in a 1953 essay titled "Poetry and Cinema."  “The poetry, the mystery, all that completes and enlarges tangible reality is utterly lacking.” (Sklar, 324)  ''Los Olvidados'' contains such surrealistic shots as when “a boy throws an egg at the camera lens, where it shatters and drips” or a scene in which a boy has a dream in slow-motion (Sklar, 324). The surrealist dream sequence was actually shot in reverse and switched in post-production. Buñuel does not romanticize the characters, and even the abused blind man is revealed to have cruel habits of preying on children and selling fake elixirs.

==Reception==
===Initial===
''Los Olvidados'' was largely disparaged by the Mexican press upon its release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/93547%7C0/Los-Olvidados.html|title=Los Olvidados|last=Steffen|first=James|publisher=Turner Classic Movies, Inc.|accessdate=April 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Juan Carlos Ibáñez and Manuel Palacio write, "The film was so harsh and innovative, so critical and daring in its statements that during its first screenings, spectators openly aired their indignation towards the features of Mexican identity presented by Buñuel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RFcRMkd-CvIC&amp;pg=PA53|title=The Cinema of Latin America|page=53|editor1-last=Elena|editor1-first=Alberto|editor2-last=López|editor2-first=Marina Díaz|publisher=Columbia University Press|date=2012|isbn=0231501943}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work was also criticized as overly bleak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.empireonline.com/movies/los-olvidados/review/|title=Los Olvidados Review|last=Parkinson|first=David|magazine=Empire|date=June 14, 2006|accessdate=April 16, 2017|quote=The Mexican critics [...] denounced Buñuel for failing to alleviate the misery with some optimistic fantasy [...]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retrospective===
Many critics have since proclaimed ''Los Olvidados'' a masterpiece. It currently holds a 94% score on the website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 33 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The work placed 110th in the 2012 ''[[Sight &amp; Sound]]'' critics' poll of the greatest films ever made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6b209ea3/sightandsoundpoll2012|title=Votes for Los Olvidados (1950)|publisher=British Film Institute|accessdate=April 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
''Los Olvidados'' has been cited as an influence on films such as ''[[Amores perros]]'' (2000), ''[[Pixote]]'' (1980), and ''[[City of God (2002 film)|City of God]]'' (2002).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/feb/16/worldcinema.drama|title=Los Olvidados|last=Bradshaw|first=Peter|newspaper=The Guardian|date=February 15, 2007|accessdate=April 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Widely regarded as one of the most accomplished forgers in history, Hofmann is especially noted for his creation of documents related to the history of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]].&lt;ref name="Form and Meaning in the History of the Book: Selected Essays"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barker|first1=Nicolas|title=Form and Meaning in the History of the Book: Selected Essays|date=2003|publisher=British Library|location=London|isbn=0-7123-4777-1|chapter=A Scandal in America}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE6DD1639F932A25751C0A961948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all "Dealer In Mormon Fraud Called A Master Forger"] from ''[[The New York Times]]''; [http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node=Mark%20Hofmann Mark Hofmann] from [[Everything2]]; [http://www.lib.udel.edu/ud/spec/exhibits/forgery/hoaxes.htm Forging a Collection] from [[University of Delaware|University of Delaware Library]]&lt;/ref&gt; When his schemes began to unravel, he constructed [[bomb]]s to murder two people in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]].

==Early life==
Mark Hofmann was born in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]]. He was raised in [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) by two devoutly religious parents.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Lindsey, ''A Gathering of Saints: A True Story of Money Murder and Deceit'' (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1988), 41. That his grandmother "was the product of a polygamous Mormon union sixteen years after the 1890 church manifesto abolishing polygamy...was a secret that members of Mark's family seldom discussed."&lt;/ref&gt; Hofmann was a below-average high school student, but he had many hobbies including magic, electronics, chemistry, and stamp and coin collecting.&lt;ref&gt;Lindsey, 55.&lt;/ref&gt; He and his friends were said to have made bombs for fun on the outskirts of [[Murray, Utah]].&lt;ref&gt;Lindsey, 55. Hofmann graduated 573 in a class of 700.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hofmann, while still a teenage coin collector, he forged a rare [[mint mark]] on a [[Dime (United States coin)|dime]] and was told by an organization of coin collectors that it was genuine.&lt;ref&gt;Lindsey, 370. Hofmann decided that if experts said the coin was genuine, then it ''was'' genuine, and he was cheating no one to whom he sold it.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like many young men in the LDS Church, Hofmann volunteered to spend two years as an [[Mormon missionary|LDS missionary]], and in 1973 the church sent him to the England Southwest [[Mission (LDS Church)|Mission]], where he was based in [[Bristol, England|Bristol]]. Hofmann told his parents that he had baptized several converts; he did not tell them that he had also perused [[Fawn M. Brodie]]'s biography of [[Joseph Smith]], ''[[No Man Knows My History]]''. While in England, Hofmann also enjoyed investigating bookshops and buying early Mormon material as well as books [[Criticism of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|critiquing Mormonism]].&lt;ref&gt;Lindsey, 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Hofmann later told [[prosecutor]]s that he had lost his faith in the LDS Church when he was about fourteen.&lt;ref name="Turley"&gt;Richard Turley, "Victims: The LDS Church and the Mark Hofmann Case" (Urbana and Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 1992), 205–206, 316.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Metcalfe|first1=Brent|title=Brent Metcalfe – Early Years, Mark Hofmann, the Salamander Letter, and the Bombings|url=http://mormonstories.org/brent-metcalfe-mark-hofmann-salamander-letter-bombings/|website=Mormon Stories|accessdate=August 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He'd learned that his maternal grandparents had continued to secretly practice [[Mormonism and polygamy|polygamy]] for more than a decade after the church publicly ended the practice (it was not [[Second Manifesto|fully renounced]] until 1904).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Naifeh  | first1 = Steven  | author1link = Steven Naifeh  | last2 = Smith | first2 = Gregory White| author2link = Gregory White Smith  | title = The Mormon Murders  | origyear = 1988  | year = 2005  | publisher = [[St. Martin's Press]]  | pages= 77–78| isbn = 0-312934-10-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A former girlfriend believed he performed his mission only because of social pressure and the desire not to disappoint his parents.&lt;ref&gt;Lindsey, 243.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Hofmann returned from his mission, he enrolled as a [[pre-med]] major at [[Utah State University]]. In 1979, he married Doralee Olds, and the couple eventually had four children.&lt;ref&gt;Lindsey, 58. Hofmann was a "hands-on father … who pushed strollers, changed diapers, and attended local ward meetings with a baby on his arm." Worrall, 233.&lt;/ref&gt; Dorie Olds Hofmann filed for [[divorce]] in 1987 and became co-founder of a holistic healing company.

==Forgeries==

===Anthon Transcript forgery===
{{See also|Anthon Transcript}}
[[Image:Ref. Egyptian.jpg|right|thumb|Hofmann forgery of Reformed Egyptian document, LDS archives. Note the columnar arrangement and the "Mexican Calendar" described by Anthon]]

In 1980, Hofmann claimed that he had found a 17th-century [[King James Version|King James Bible]] with a folded paper gummed inside.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Lindsey, ''A Gathering of Saints: A True Story of Money Murder and Deceit'' (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1988), 65–66.&lt;/ref&gt; The document seemed to be the transcript that Joseph Smith's scribe [[Martin Harris (Latter Day Saints)|Martin Harris]] had presented to [[Charles Anthon]], a [[Columbia College of Columbia University|Columbia]] [[classics]] professor, in 1828. According to the Mormon scripture [[Joseph Smith–History]], the transcript and its unusual [[reformed Egyptian]] characters were copied by Smith from the [[golden plates]] from which he translated the [[Book of Mormon]].

Hofmann constructed his version to fit Anthon's description of the document, and its discovery made Hofmann's reputation. [[Dean Jessee]], an editor of [[The Joseph Smith Papers|Joseph Smith's papers]] and the best-known expert on handwriting and old documents in the Historical Department of the LDS Church, concluded that the document was a Smith [[holograph]]. The LDS Church announced the discovery of the [[Anthon Transcript]] in April and purchased it from Hofmann for more than $20,000.&lt;ref&gt;Lindsey, 68–69.&lt;/ref&gt; Appraised by the LDS Church for $25,000, it was purchased on October 13 in exchange for several artifacts the church owned in duplicate, including a $5 [[gold]] Mormon coin, [[State of Deseret|Deseret]] [[banknote]]s, and a first edition of the Book of Mormon. Assuming the document to be genuine, prominent Mormon academic [[Hugh Nibley]] predicted that the discovery promised "as good a test as we'll ever get of the authenticity of the Book of Mormon" because he thought the paper might be translated.&lt;ref&gt;Lindsey, 66–69.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zoology]] professor [[Barry Fell]] soon after claimed to have decoded the text.&lt;ref&gt;Lindsey, 70–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hofmann promptly dropped out of school and went into business as a dealer in rare books. He soon fabricated other historically significant documents and became noted among LDS Church history buffs for his "discoveries" of previously unknown materials pertaining to the [[Latter Day Saint movement]]. These deceived not only members of the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] — notably [[Gordon B. Hinckley]], then the ''[[de facto]]'' president of the church due to the poor health of more senior leaders&lt;ref&gt;"Lindsey, 101: "At seventy-two, Hinckley had begun filling the role that would increasingly dominate his life, his role as de facto president of the church."&lt;/ref&gt; — but also document experts and distinguished historians.&lt;ref&gt;Some LDS apologists dispute the fact that the church was deceived by Hofmann's forgeries. However, on October 18, 1995, after Hofmann's arrest, Hinckley said, "I frankly admit that Hofmann tricked us .... We bought those documents only after the assurance that they were genuine .... I am not ashamed to admit that we were victimized. It is not the first time the Church has found itself in such a position. Joseph Smith was victimized again and again. The Savior was victimized. I am sorry to say that sometimes it happens." [http://www.meridianmagazine.com/critics/081106sal.html Meridian Magazine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206195544/http://meridianmagazine.com/critics/081106sal.html |date=2010-02-06 }}, November 2006. Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith, ''The Mormon Murders: A True Story of Forgery, Deceit, and Death'' (St. Martin's, 2005), 435–37. "Early in the investigation friends of Mark Hofmann and Steven Christensen repeatedly told the detectives that they had been present when Hofmann and Christensen received telephone calls from Gordon Hinckley. Toll records showed Hofmann placed several calls to Hinckley's office from his car telephone during the week before the bombings .... But Hinckley spoke of Hofmann as if he barely recognized his name. Repeatedly when he was asked about the document, Hinckley answered: "''I can't remember''." Lindsey, 267.  As Simon Worrall has written, Hofmann "had fooled the most powerful men in the Mormon Church ....They were seers, endowed with the power of discernment, who, according to the Book of Mormon could 'translate all records that are of ancient date.' Yet when Gordon B. Hinckley and the president of the Church, Spencer W. Kimball, had looked at the Anthon Transcript, they had been no more able to translate Hofmann's forged hieroglyphics than if they had been in Swahili.  As Hofmann remembered how tears had come to their eyes, he felt a surge of sadistic pleasure." Simon Worrall, ''The Poet and the Murderer: A True Story of Literary Crime and the Art of Forgery'' (New York: Dutton, 2002), 104. [[Roger Launius]], in a review of [[Linda Sillitoe]] and Allen Roberts, ''Salamander: The Story of the Mormon Forgery Murders'', 2nd ed. (Salt Lake City: Signature Books, 2006) in the ''John Whitmer Historical Association Journal'' 8 (1988), writes, "Equally intriguing, why was the Mormon historical community so unwilling to accept the facts of the case and only reluctantly acknowledged that Hofmann was a murderer and that his documents were fakes? I suspect it has something to do with an unwillingness to admit that Hofmann had tricked them."&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Richard and Joan Ostling]], Hofmann was by this time a "closet [[apostate]]" motivated not only by greed but also by "the desire to embarrass the church by undermining church history."&lt;ref&gt;Richard N. Ostling and Joan K. Ostling, ''Mormon America: The Power and the Promise'' (HarperSanFrancisco, 1999), 253; Worrall, 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Joseph Smith III blessing===
During the early 1980s, a significant number of new Mormon documents came into the marketplace.  Sometimes the church received these as donations, and others it purchased. According to the Ostlings, "The church publicized some of the acquisitions; it orchestrated public relations for some that were known to be sensitive; others it acquired secretly and suppressed."&lt;ref&gt;Ostling, 252–53. "Gordon B. Hinckley, the second counselor in the First Presidency, largely handled policy in these matters and directed the public relations responses of the church."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, Hofmann arrived at the headquarters of the LDS Church with a document which supposedly provided evidence that Smith had designated his son [[Joseph Smith III]], rather than [[Brigham Young]], as his successor. In a forged [[cover letter]], purportedly written by [[Thomas Bullock (Mormon)|Thomas Bullock]] and dated January 27, 1865, Bullock chastises Young for having all copies of the blessing destroyed. Bullock writes that although he believes Young to be the legitimate leader of the LDS Church, he would keep his copy of the blessing. Such a letter, if true, would portray Young and, by extension, the LDS Church, in an unfavorable light. In February 1981, Hofmann tried to sell the letter to the chief archivist of the LDS Church.&lt;ref&gt;Turley, 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Hofmann expected the church to "buy the blessing on the spot and ''bury'' it."&lt;ref&gt;Lindsay, 75.&lt;/ref&gt; When the archivist balked at the price, Hofmann offered it to the [[Community of Christ|Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]] (RLDS Church; now known as the Community of Christ), which had always claimed that the line of succession had been bestowed on Smith's descendants but had never had written proof. A scramble to acquire the document occurred, and Hofmann, posing as a faithful Mormon, presented it to his church in exchange for items worth more than $20,000.&lt;ref&gt;Lindsey, 80–81.&lt;br/&gt; In 2011, it was revealed that Hofmann had tape-recorded himself pitching the bogus document to the RLDS Church archives. ({{citation |url= http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/news/52289687-75/hofmann-church-lds-recording.html.csp |newspaper= Salt Lake Tribune |date= July 29, 2011 |title= Mark Hofmann tape-recorded RLDS scam while it was in progress |last= Jensen |first= Derek P. }})&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Hofmann also ensured that the document would be made public. The next day, a ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' headline read, "Mormon Document Raises Doubts on Succession of Church's Leaders,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70912F8395D0C7A8DDDAA0894D9484D81 |work= The New York Times |title= Mormon Document Raises Doubts On Succession Of Church's Leaders |date= March 19, 1981 |accessdate= May 12, 2010 |first= Wallace |last= Turner}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the LDS Church was forced to confirm the discovery and publicly present the document to the RLDS Church.&lt;ref&gt;Lindsey, 80–81.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the race by the Utah and [[Missouri]] churches to acquire the blessing document, Hofmann discovered "a lever to exercise enormous power over his church," a power to "menace and manipulate its leaders with nothing more sinister than a sheet of paper."&lt;ref&gt;Lindsey, 298&lt;/ref&gt; Salt Lake County District Attorney's investigator Michael George believed that, after Hofmann had successfully forged the blessing, his ultimate goal was to create the [[lost 116 pages]] of the Book of Mormon, which he could have filled with inconsistencies and errors, sell them "to the church to be hidden away" and then — as he had done often with embarrassing documents — "make sure its contents were made public."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Lindsey, ''A Gathering of Saints'' (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1988), 300. "It was possible, George thought, that Hofmann could have destroyed Mormonism. Perhaps that is what he wanted to do—and to get rich at the same time."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Salamander letter===
Perhaps the most notorious of Hofmann's Mormon forgeries, the [[Salamander letter]], appeared in 1984. Supposedly written by Harris to [[W. W. Phelps (Mormon)|W. W. Phelps]], the letter presented a version of the recovery of the gold plates that contrasted markedly with the church-sanctioned version of events. Not only did the forgery intimate that Smith had been practicing "money digging" through magical practices, but it also replaced the angel that Smith said had appeared to him with a white salamander.&lt;ref&gt;Lindsey, 118–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the letter had been purchased for the church and become public knowledge, LDS Church [[apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostle]] [[Dallin H. Oaks]] asserted to Mormon educators that the words "white salamander" could be reconciled with Smith's [[Angel Moroni]] because, in the 1820s, the word ''salamander'' might also refer to [[Salamander (legendary creature)|a mythical being thought to be able to live in fire]], and a "being that is able to live in fire is a good approximation of the description Joseph Smith gave of the Angel Moroni."&lt;ref&gt;"1985 CES Doctrine and Covenants Symposium" (August 16, 1985), 22–23, at [http://www.utlm.org/onlinebooks/trackingconfessions2.htm Utah Lighthouse Ministry website].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, [[Jerald and Sandra Tanner]], critics of the LDS Church, became the first to declare the letter a forgery despite the fact that it, as well as others of Hofmann's "discoveries," would have strengthened the Tanners' arguments against the veracity of official Mormon history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utlm.org/onlinebooks/trackingreview.htm?FACTNet Utah Lighthouse Ministry website.] A visibly shaken Hofmann paid the Tanners a personal visit. "Why you of all people?"  he asked. (Lindsey, 136).&lt;/ref&gt; Document expert [[Kenneth W. Rendell]] later said that while there was "the absence of any indication of forgery in the letter itself, there was also no evidence that it was genuine."&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth W. Rendell, ''Forging History: The Detection of Fake Letters and Documents'' (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1984), 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other Mormon forgeries===
No one is certain how many forged documents Hofmann created during the early 1980s, but they included a letter from Joseph Smith's mother, [[Lucy Mack Smith]], describing the origin of the Book of Mormon;&lt;ref&gt;The LDS Church publicized this Hofmann creation through a press conference on August 23, 1982. The forgery was a letter complete with an 1828 [[Palmyra (town), New York|Palmyra, New York]], [[postmark]]. At the press conference, [[Dean Jessee]] asserted that a Hofmann forgery seemed authentic not only for Lucy Smith's handwriting but also for the period postmark and correct postage. Lindsey, 95–97.&lt;/ref&gt; letters from [[Martin Harris (Latter Day Saints)|Martin Harris]] and [[David Whitmer]], two of the [[Three Witnesses]], each giving a personal account of their visions;&lt;ref&gt;Lindsey, 95, 97.&lt;/ref&gt; a contract between Smith and [[Egbert Bratt Grandin]] for the printing of the first edition of the Book of Mormon; and two pages of the original Book of Mormon manuscript taken in dictation from Smith to [[Oliver Cowdery]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Dallin H. Oaks]], [http://www.lds.org/ensign/1987/10/recent-events-involving-church-history-and-forged-documents "Recent Events Involving Church History and Forged Documents"], ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', October 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, Hofmann bypassed the LDS Church's historical department and sold to [[Gordon B. Hinckley]], a member of the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] of the church, an 1825 Joseph Smith [[holograph]] purporting to confirm that Smith had been treasure hunting and practicing black magic five years after his [[First Vision]]. Hofmann had the signature authenticated by Charles Hamilton, the contemporary "dean of American autograph dealers," sold the letter to the church for $15,000, and gave his word that no one else had a copy.&lt;ref&gt;Lindsey, 100–06.&lt;/ref&gt; Then Hofmann leaked its existence to the press, after which the church was virtually forced to release the letter to scholars for study, despite previously denying it had it in its possession.&lt;ref&gt;Allan D. Roberts, [http://library.dixie.edu/info/Collections/truth/truth.htm "The Truth is the Most Important Thing: A Look at Mark W. Hofmann, the Mormon Salamander Man"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205124630/http://library.dixie.edu/info/Collections/truth/truth.htm |date=2008-02-05 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

To make this sudden flood of important Mormon documents seem plausible, Hofmann explained that he relied on a network of tipsters, had methodically tracked down modern descendants of early Mormons, and had mined collections of 19th-century letters that had been saved by collectors for their [[postmarks]] rather than for their contents.&lt;ref&gt;Lindsey, 95, 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Oath of a Freeman"===
In addition to documents from Mormon history, Hofmann also forged and sold signatures of many famous non-Mormons, including [[George Washington]], [[John Adams]], [[John Quincy Adams]], [[Daniel Boone]], [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]], [[Andrew Jackson]], [[Mark Twain]], [[Nathan Hale]], [[John Hancock]], [[Francis Scott Key]], [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[John Milton]], [[Paul Revere]], [[Myles Standish]], and [[Button Gwinnett]], whose signature was the rarest, and therefore the most valuable, of any signer of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]].&lt;ref&gt;Lindsey, 377.&lt;/ref&gt; Hofmann also forged a previously unknown poem in the hand of [[Emily Dickinson]].&lt;ref&gt;A book has been written about the forged poem, which was sold by [[Sotheby's]] in 1997, long after Hofmann had been committed to prison. Simon Worrall, ''The Poet and the Murderer'' (New York: Dutton, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; But Hofmann's grandest scheme was to forge what was perhaps the most famous missing document in American colonial history, the "[[Oath of a Freeman]]". The one-page "Oath" had been printed in 1639, the first document to be printed in [[Thirteen Colonies|Britain's American colonies]]; but only about fifty copies had been made, and none of these was extant. A genuine example was probably worth over one million dollars in 1985, and Hofmann's agents began to negotiate a sale to the [[Library of Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;Brian Innes, ''Fakes &amp; Forgeries: The True Crime Stories of History's Greatest Deceptions'' (Pleasantville, New York: Reader's Digest, 2005), 132–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murders==
Despite the considerable amounts of money Hofmann had made from document sales, he was deeply in debt, in part because of his increasingly lavish lifestyle and his purchases of genuine first-edition books.&lt;ref&gt;Lindsey, 147. For instance, Hofmann paid $22,500 for a first edition of ''The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes'' to add to a collection he was building for his wife.&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to clear his debts, he attempted to broker a sale of the "McLellin collection"—a supposedly extensive group of documents written by [[William E. McLellin]], an early Mormon [[Apostle (Mormonism)|apostle]] who eventually broke with the LDS Church. Hofmann hinted that the McLellin collection would provide revelations unfavorable to the LDS Church. But Hofmann had no idea where the McLellin collection was, nor did he have the time to forge a suitably large group of documents.&lt;ref&gt;There actually were two surviving collections of McLellin papers, neither of which Hofmann knew of. One was discovered by a Salt Lake City reporter shortly after Hofmann was injured by his own bomb. The documents were interesting—McLellin described Joseph Smith "as a corrupt, even murderous dictator who seduced young girls under the guise of divine revelation"—but the documents were not as spectacularly anti-Mormon as Hofmann had implied. Robert Lindsey, ''A Gathering of Saints: A true Story of Money Murder and Deceit'' (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1988), 254–56; [http://signaturebooks.com/2010/07/the-william-e-mclellin-papers/ Introduction to the Signature Books edition of the McLellin Papers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140310033033/http://signaturebooks.com/2010/07/the-william-e-mclellin-papers/ |date=2014-03-10 }}  Church archives also held McLellin journals, which had been institutionally forgotten and were not revealed to exist until after Hofmann's trial. [http://www.utlm.org/newsletters/no83.htm#TURLEY'S%20BOMBSHELL! "Mormon Leaders Suppress 'Key" Item In Murder Case", from the Utah Lighthouse Ministry website] Hofmann obtained on consignment from document expert Kenneth W. Rendell, two pieces of a second-century A.D. Egyptian Book of the Dead, written on papyrus, which he then cut up and passed off as material from the McLellin Papers. Rendell, 132.&lt;/ref&gt; Those to whom Hofmann had promised documents or repayments of debts began to hound him, and the sale of the "Oath of a Freeman" was delayed by questions about its authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;Lindsey, 249–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to buy more time, Hofmann began constructing bombs. On October 15, 1985, he first killed document collector Steven Christensen, the son of a locally prominent clothier, [[Mac Christensen]].&lt;ref&gt;Mac Christensen was founder of the Utah-area Mr. Mac clothing stores.&lt;/ref&gt; Later the same day, a second bomb killed Kathy Sheets, the wife of Christensen's former employer. As Hofmann had intended, police initially suspected that the bombings were related to the impending collapse of an investment business of which Sheets's husband, J. Gary Sheets, was the principal and Christensen his protégé.&lt;ref&gt;Lindsey, 179–82. On the afternoon following the bombings, Hofmann met with LDS Church apostle [[Dallin Oaks]] about the McLellin collection, a meeting which fellow document collector Brent Metcalfe believed had religious significance to Hofmann. "He's just killed two people. And what does he do? He goes down to the church office building and meets with Dallin Oaks. I can't even imagine the rush, given Hofmann's frame of reference, that this would have given him. To be standing there in front of one of God's appointed apostles, after murdering two people, and this person doesn't hear any words from God, doesn't intuit a thing. For Hofmann that must have been an absolute rush. He had pulled off the ultimate spoof against God." Simon Worrall, ''The Poet and the Murderer: A True Story of Literary Crime and the Art of Forgery'' (New York: Dutton, 2002), 232.&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, Hofmann himself was severely injured when a bomb exploded in his car. Although police quickly focused on Hofmann as the suspect in the bombings, some of Hofmann's business associates went into hiding, fearing they might also become victims.&lt;ref&gt;Lindsey, 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial and sentencing==
During the bombing investigation, police discovered evidence of the forgeries in Hofmann's basement. They also found the engraving plant where he had had the forged plate for the "Oath of a Freeman" made. (Hofmann had made two significant errors in his "Oath," creating a version impossible to have been set in type.&lt;ref&gt;Innes, 134–37.&lt;/ref&gt;)

Document examiner George Throckmorton analyzed several Hofmann documents that had previously been deemed authentic and determined they were forgeries. Three letters purportedly written from an Illinois prison by Joseph Smith used different ink, paper, and writing instruments. (Because the letters had been authenticated by different experts, the inconsistencies had earlier escaped detection.)  Throckmorton also discovered that some documents, supposedly written by different people, had similar writing styles and that they had been written with homemade [[iron gall ink]] that looked cracked like alligator skin under a microscope, although authentic period ink did not.&lt;ref&gt;Lindsey, 260, 270–71, 274–75.&lt;/ref&gt; Investigators also found that a poem used to authenticate the handwriting in the Salamander Letter had been forged by Hofmann and inserted in a ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' once owned by Martin Harris.&lt;ref&gt;Lindsey, 288–91.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hofmann was arrested in January 1986 and charged on four indictments totaling 27 counts, including first-degree murder, delivering a bomb, constructing or possessing a bomb, theft by deception,  and communication fraud. A fifth indictment, containing an additional five counts of theft by deception, was added later in January.&lt;ref name="Turley"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Salamander: The Story of the Mormon Forgery Murders|author1=Linda Sillitoe|author2=Allen Roberts|publisher=[[Signature Books]]|location=Salt Lake City|date=2006|pages=157–159}}&lt;/ref&gt; He initially maintained his innocence. However, at a preliminary hearing, prosecutors produced voluminous evidence of his forgeries and debts, as well as evidence linking him to the bombs.

Hofmann not only faced the prospect of the [[death penalty]] in Utah, but was indicted on federal charges of possession of an [[National Firearms Act#Criminal penalties|unregistered]] [[Uzi|machine gun]]. New York prosecutors also sought an indictment for the fraudulent sale of the "Oath of a Freeman." In January 1987, Hofmann pleaded guilty to two counts of second-degree murder, one count of theft by deception for forging the Salamander Letter, and one count of fraud for the bogus sale of the McLellin collection. Hofmann agreed to confess his forgeries in open court, in return for which prosecutors in Utah and New York dropped additional charges against him. He was sentenced to five years to life in prison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crimelibrary.com/criminal_mind/forensics/mormon_forgeries/index.html The Mormon Forgery Murders] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140403044421/http://www.crimelibrary.com/criminal_mind/forensics/mormon_forgeries/index.html |date=2014-04-03 }} at [[Crime Library]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Naifeh and White, 491, 521–523.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, before the Utah Board of Pardons, Hofmann said that he thought planting the bomb that killed Kathy Sheets was "almost a game … at the time I made the bomb, my thoughts were that it didn't matter if it was Mrs. Sheets, a child, a dog … whoever" was killed. Within the hour the parole board, struck by Hofmann's "callous disregard for human life," decided that he would indeed serve his "natural life in prison."&lt;ref&gt;Lindsey, 373–74. Hofmann also told Investigator Michael George that he was bewildered by the attention paid to his murder victims: "I don't feel anything for them. My philosophy is that they're ''dead''. They're not suffering. I think life is basically worthless. They could have died just as easily in a car accident. I don't believe in God. I don't believe in an afterlife. ''They don't know they're dead''." (378) In Sillitoe's first edition of ''Salamander'' (1988), Hofmann is quoted as referring to Mr. Sheets,
not Mrs. Sheets. (513)&lt;/ref&gt;

After Hofmann was imprisoned, he was [[Disciplinary council|excommunicated]] by the LDS Church and his wife filed for divorce. Hofmann attempted [[suicide]] in his cell by taking an overdose of antidepressants. He was revived but not before spending twelve hours lying on his right arm, blocking its circulation, and causing muscle atrophy.  His forging hand was thereby permanently disabled.&lt;ref&gt;Worrall, 248: "The massive overdose of antidepressants he took soon after Dorie Olds filed for divorce [in 1987] left him lying unconscious for twelve hours on his prison cot with his right arm trapped under him. As a result of the blockage to his circulation, the muscles of his arm are atrophied.  The forearm is withered almost to the bone."&lt;/ref&gt;

Hofmann, [[Utah Department of Corrections]] offender number 41235, was originally incarcerated at [[Utah State Prison]] in [[Draper, Utah|Draper]]. However, in 2016, he was transferred to [[Central Utah Correctional Facility]] in [[Gunnison, Utah|Gunnison]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fox13now.com/2016/09/19/notorious-bomber-mark-hofmann-moved-to-gunnison-prison/|title=Notorious bomber Mark Hofmann moved to Gunnison prison|last=Winslow|first=Ben|publisher=[[KSTU]]|date=2016-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
As a master forger, Hofmann deceived a number of renowned document experts during his short career. Some of his forgeries were accepted by scholars for years, and an unknown number of them may still be in circulation.&lt;ref&gt;"'Mark Hofmann was unquestionably the most skilled forger this country has ever seen,' said Charles Hamilton, a New York document dealer who is widely regarded as the nation's pre-eminent detector of forged documents. He was the first to determine that the widely publicized ''Hitler Diaries'' of several years ago were fakes. Mr. Hamilton said Mr. Hofmann 'perpetrated by far the largest monetary frauds through forgery that this country has ever had,' adding, 'He fooled me - he fooled everybody.'"

In August 1987, the sensationalist aspects of the Hofmann case led apostle [[Dallin H. Oaks]] to believe that church members had witnessed "some of the most intense LDS Church-bashing since the turn of the [20th] century." A student of Mormonism, [[Jan Shipps]], agreed that press reports "contained an astonishing amount of innuendo associating Hofmann's plagiarism with Mormon beginnings. Myriad reports alleged secrecy and cover-up on the part of LDS general authorities, and not a few writers referred to the way in which a culture that rests on a found scripture is particularly vulnerable to the offerings of con-artists."&lt;ref&gt;Jan Shipps, ''Sojourner in the Promised Land: Forty Years Among the Mormons'' (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 2000), pp. 107–08. See also John Brooke, ''Refiner's Fire: The Making of Mormon Cosmology, 1644–1844'' (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Ostlings, the Hofmann forgeries could only have been perpetrated "in connection with the curious mixture of paranoia and obsessiveness with which Mormons approach church history."&lt;ref&gt;Richard N. Ostling and Joan K. Ostling, ''Mormon America: The Power and the Promise'' (HarperSanFrancisco, 1999), 252.&lt;/ref&gt; After Hofmann's exposure, the LDS Church tried to correct the record, but the "public relations damage as well as the forgery losses meant the church was also a Hofmann victim."&lt;ref&gt;Ostling, 254.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Lindsey (journalist)|Robert Lindsey]] has also suggested that Hofmann "stimulated a burst of historical inquiry regarding Joseph Smith's youthful enthusiasm for magic [that] did not wither after his conviction".&lt;ref&gt;Subsequently, the LDS Church raised higher barriers to scholars' access to church archives. According to Lindsey, The Mark Hofmann affair emboldened many scholars to penetrate deeper into Mormon history that its most conservative leaders wanted left unexplored, and that church leaders were unlikely to be able to fully contain the fires of intellectual curiosity that Hofmann helped fan. Lindsey, 372–73.  In contrast, apostle [[Dallin H. Oaks]] argued that LDS Church policies restricting access to its archives were similar to those of other large archives such as the [[Huntington Library]]. Dallin H. Oaks, "Recent Events Involving Church History and Forged Documents," ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', (October 1987), p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mehmed V Reşâd''' ([[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]]: محمد خامس ''Meḥmed-i ẖâmis'', {{lang-tr|Beşinci Mehmet Reşat}} or {{lang|tr|Reşat Mehmet}}) (2 November 1844 – 3 July 1918) was the 35th and penultimate [[List of sultans of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Sultan]]. He was the son of Sultan [[Abdulmejid I]].&lt;ref&gt;''Abdulmecid'', Coskun Cakir, '''Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire''', ed.  Gábor Ágoston, Bruce Alan Masters, (Infobase Publishing, 2009), 9.&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded by his half-brother [[Mehmed VI]]. His nine-year reign was marked by the cession of the Empire's [[North Africa]]n territories and the [[Dodecanese Islands]], including [[Rhodes]], in the [[Italo-Turkish War]], the traumatic loss of almost all of the Empire's European territories west of Constantinople in the [[First Balkan War]], and the entry of the Empire into [[World War I]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/help/digitized-books/world-war-i-declarations/ww1-gazettes/Ottoman-declaration-against-Russia-France-and-England-1-OCR-SPLIT.pdf|title=Rusya Fransa ve İngiltere devletleriyle hal-i harb ilanı hakkında irade-i seniyye [Imperial Decree Concerning the Declaration of a State of War with the States of Russia, France, and the United Kingdom], Nov. 11, 1914 (29 Teşrin-i Evvel 1330), Takvim-i Vekayi, Nov. 12, 1914 (30 Teşrin-i Evvel 1330).|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which would ultimately lead to the end of the [[Ottoman Empire]].

==Birth==
He was born at the [[Topkapı Palace]], Constantinople.&lt;ref name="Chisholm"&gt;''The Encyclopædia Britannica'', Vol.7, edited Hugh Chisholm, (1911), 3; "''Constantinople, the capital of the Turkish Empire..''".&lt;/ref&gt; Like many other potential heirs to the throne, he was confined for 30 years in the [[Seraglio|Harems]] of the palace. For nine of those years he was in solitary confinement. During this time he studied poetry of the old Persian style and was an acclaimed [[poet]]. On his ninth birthday he was ceremoniously circumcised in the special Circumcision Room (Sünnet Odasi) of Topkapı Palace.

==Reign==
His reign began on 27 April 1909, but he was largely a figurehead with no real political power, as a consequence of the [[Young Turk Revolution]] in 1908 (which [[Second Constitutional Era|restored the Ottoman Constitution and Parliament]]) and especially the [[1913 Ottoman coup d'état]], which brought the dictatorial triumvirate of the [[Three Pashas]] to power.

Under his rule, the Ottoman Empire lost all its remaining territory in North Africa ([[Tripolitania]], [[Cyrenaica]] and [[Fezzan]]) to [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] in the [[Italo-Turkish War]] and nearly all its European territories (except for a small strip of land west of Constantinople) in the [[First Balkan War]]. The sudden loss of these enormous swathes of land, which had been Ottoman territory for centuries and were ceded to its opponents within a span of only two years, was deeply shocking to the Ottoman Turks and resulted in massive popular backlash against the government, culminating in the [[1913 Ottoman coup d'etat]].

Mehmed V's most significant political act was to formally declare [[jihad]] against the [[Triple Entente|Entente Powers]] ([[Allies of World War I]]) on 14 November 1914, following the Ottoman government's decision to join the [[First World War]] on the side of the [[Central Powers]].&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Sondhaus, ''World War One: The Global Revolution'', (Cambridge University Press, 2011), 91.&lt;/ref&gt; He was actually said to look with disfavor on the pro-German policy of [[Enver Pasha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1922|wstitle=Mahommed V.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was the last genuine proclamation of jihad in history by a [[Caliph]], as the [[Caliphate]] lasted until 1924. The proclamation had no noticeable effect on the war, despite the fact that many [[Muslims]] lived in Ottoman territories. Some [[Arabs]] eventually [[Middle Eastern theatre of World War I|joined the British forces]] against the Ottomans with the [[Arab Revolt]] in 1916.

Mehmed V hosted [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]], his [[World War I]] ally, in [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] on 15 October 1917. He was made [[Generalfeldmarschall]] of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] on 27 January 1916, and of the [[German Empire]] on 1 February 1916.

==Death==
Mehmed V died at [[Yıldız Palace]] on 3 July 1918 at the age of 73, only four months before the end of World War I.&lt;ref&gt;''Mehmed V'', Selcuk Aksin Somel, '''Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire''', 371.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, he did not live to see the downfall of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. He spent most of his life at the [[Dolmabahçe Palace]] and [[Yıldız Palace]] in Istanbul. His grave is in the [[Eyüp]] district.

'''''National Lampoon 1964 High School Yearbook Parody''''' is an American humor book that was first published in 1973. It was a spin-off from ''[[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]]'' magazine. The book was a parody of a high school yearbook from the early 1960s. It was edited by [[P. J. O'Rourke]] and [[Douglas Kenney|Doug Kenney]] and art-directed by [[David Kaestle]]. Much of the writing was by [[P. J. O'Rourke]] and [[Douglas Kenney|Doug Kenney]]. The "literary magazine" was written by [[Sean Kelly (writer)|Sean Kelly]]; the sports page was by [[Christopher Cerf (musician and television producer)|Christopher Cerf]]; and the Principal's Letter and the "In Memorium" piece were both by [[Ed Subitzky]].

The book, as it was originally published, appeared to be a genuine 1964 yearbook from '''"[[Estes Kefauver|C. Estes Kefauver]] High School"''': the ''Kefauver Kaleidoscope''. Senator Kefauver himself had only died the year before, in 1963.  The school is located in "Dacron, Ohio" (a reference to the city [[Akron, Ohio]],&lt;ref&gt;Akron is the metropolitan area nearest Sandusky, Ohio--setting of ''The King of Sandusky'', a fictionalised account of O'Rourke's  childhood&lt;/ref&gt;  and to inexpensive synthetic fabric [[Dacron]].)

The parody is closely based on the Toledo, Ohio's [[DeVilbiss High School (Toledo, Ohio)|DeVilbiss High School]] yearbook, called the ''Pot 'o Gold''.  O'Rourke attended DHS for a couple of years in the early 1960s.  The swim team photo caption contains the names of a number of O'Rourke's friends from Devilbiss.  Like many great parodies, the Lampoon yearbook is only a degree or two from the original.

The publication also included a copy of the school newspaper, a [[basketball]] program, a [[report card]], a [[diploma]], [[School detention|detention]] slips and a fake [[Identity document|ID]]. According to apparent inscriptions, the book belonged to "Larry Kroger", class of '64. The character Larry Kroger went on to become the college freshman [[protagonist]] (played by [[Tom Hulce]]) of the comedy movie ''[[National Lampoon's Animal House]]'', released in 1978. The character "Mandy Pepperidge" also makes her first appearance in the Yearbook and reappears in the film (played by [[Mary Louise Weller]]). 
 
Five years after the Yearbook parody, in 1978, the National Lampoon published the ''[[National Lampoon Sunday Newspaper Parody]]'', a fake Sunday newspaper which also claimed to originate in "Dacron, Ohio" but was contemporary, being dated Sunday February 12, 1978.

'''The Orange County Regional History Center''' is a private [[non-profit]] [[museum|history museum]] located in downtown [[Orlando, Florida]], [[United States]]. Located in the historic [[Old Orange County Courthouse (Florida)|Orange County Courthouse]], the five-story museum consists of exhibits presenting local and regional history starting from 12,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web | title = About Us | publisher = The Orange County Regional History Center | url = http://www.thehistorycenter.org/support/about | accessdate =2012-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Permanent Exhibitions"&gt;{{cite web | title = Permanent Exhibitions | publisher = The Orange County Regional History Center | url = http://www.thehistorycenter.org/exhibits/permanent | accessdate = 2009-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1892, a red-brick courthouse was built in the newly established city limits of Orlando.  In 1927, a neoclassical building, now the current home of the History Center, was added and became the main courthouse. When the red-brick courthouse was demolished in 1957, the Board of County Commissioners established a historical commission to carry on the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Orange County Courthouses 1892: The Red Victorian Courthouse. | publisher = Ninth Judicial Circuit Court of Florida | url = http://www.ninthcircuit.org/about/history/orange-county-courthouses/1892}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976 the  Orange County Historical Museum in Orlando’s Loch Haven Park opened and became the precursor to the History Center. In 1995, Orange County debuted its current, high-rise courthouse, and a task force of community leaders unanimously recommended that the 1927 courthouse become a larger, regional history museum. The Orange County Regional History Center opened in September 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Orange County Courthouses 1927: Classical Temple to Justice. | publisher = Ninth Judicial Circuit Court of Florida | url =  http://ninthcircuit.org/about/history/orange-county-courthouses/1927}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The History Center is housed in the historic 1927 Orange County courthouse and home to the [[Historical Society of Central Florida]]’s collections. The five-story building was built for nearly $1 million by Orlando’s first registered architect, Murry S. King. Construction began in May 1926, and the building was dedicated on October 12, 1927. After King’s death in 1926, work on the building was completed by his son, James B. King. The jail was housed on the top floor with quarters for the jailor and his wife, an infirmary.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehistorycenter.org/about/history-center/&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Joseph L. Brechner Research Center==
The Orange County Regional History Center has its own library and archives, located in the Joseph L. Brechner Research Center, which is free to the public by appointment.

The Joseph L. Brechner Research Center, located on the fifth floor of the History Center, was created through a donation from the late Marion Brody Brechner in honor of her husband, an award-winning journalist and freedom-of-information advocate.

The Brechner Research Center houses the special collections of the Historical Society of Central Florida, a research library, and archives. The Research Center’s library and archives feature more than 5,000 volumes.&lt;ref&gt;http://brechner.org/Brechner_Legacy.asp#TheLegacycontinues&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibits==
The History Center has both traveling exhibitions and permanent exhibitions on display. The museum collections are housed throughout three of the five floors of the building with the Atrium and Emporium Gift Shop on the first floor and the Joseph L. Brechner Research Center and Library on the fifth floor.

'''RIM Charts''' is a set of charts compiled by [[Recording Industry Association of Malaysia]] (RIM) which rank the most-streamed singles in Malaysia. The charts are based on reports submitted by major digital music providers such as [[Apple Music]], [[Spotify]], [[KKBox]] and [[Deezer]], and aggregated by BMAT, a company which provides music monitoring services.&lt;ref name="rimchartsreturn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rim.org.my/main/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=480&amp;Itemid=1|title=PRESS RELEASE (03 MARCH 2017): RIM ANNOUNCES THE RETURN OF RIM CHARTS|date=March 9, 2017|accessdate=July 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current number one song is "[[Thank U, Next (song)|thank u, next]]" by [[Ariana Grande]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rim.org.my/main/images/stories/RIM/chart/47_i_dm2.pdf|title=Top 20 Most Streamed International &amp; Domestic Singles In Malaysia|language=English|work=[[Recording Industry Association of Malaysia]]|publisher=Recording Industry Association of Malaysia|accessdate=November 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
RIM has begun publishing charts since mid-1996, at the time where singles market were almost non-existent in Malaysia. The chart is, therefore, more focused on charting albums based on weekly sales. On October 1996, RIM started incorporating electronic point-of-sale (EPOS) into its chart, compiling data from more than 50 retail stores such as Salem Power Station, Music Valley and CD Rama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=October 26, 1996 |first=Alexandra |last=Nuvich |title=Malaysia Leads Asia with EPOS Charts |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=108 |issue=43 |page=5 |url=https://books.google.com.my/books?id=xwkEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA5&amp;lpg=PA5&amp;dq=malaysia+rim+charts&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=71-BMieizv&amp;sig=YPAM06iuuNzEr4p0dFiYsYW73pw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi4tMidpPvUAhUFvo8KHcXcANE4ChDoAQgxMAM#v=onepage&amp;q=malaysia%20rim%20charts&amp;f=false |accessdate=July 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the charts were discontinued in 2006 owing to dwindling album sales in relation to public disinterest to buy album as a whole and difficulties to tabulate the charts due to insufficient information from the retailers on the physical sales.&lt;ref name="rimchartsreturnstar2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.star2.com/entertainment/music/music-news/2017/03/12/the-rim-charts-are-back/|title=Malaysia’s RIM Charts are back|date=March 12, 2017|accessdate=July 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, digital music consumption in Malaysia accounted for RM 72.7 mil revenue (39.2%) to the Malaysian music industry in 2016, of which RM31.1mil is contributed from audio streaming alone. From this statistics, RIM stated that the digital music chart "has now clearly grown to the point where an official chart is needed".&lt;ref name="rimchartsreturnstar2"/&gt; The first number-one song on this revived chart (week ending February 9, 2017) was "[[Shape of You]]" by [[Ed Sheeran]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rim.org.my/main/images/stories/RIM/chart/6_i_dm.pdf|title=“Top 20 Most Streamed International &amp; Domestic Singles In Malaysia (Week 6 2017)”|language=English|work=[[Recording Industry Association of Malaysia]]|publisher=Recording Industry Association of Malaysia|accessdate=July 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, while the first number-one local song (during the same week period) was Wanita Terakhir by Fattah Amin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rim.org.my/main/images/stories/RIM/chart/6_domestic.pdf|title=“Top 10 Most Streamed Domestic Singles In Malaysia (Week 6 2017)”|language=English|work=[[Recording Industry Association of Malaysia]]|publisher=Recording Industry Association of Malaysia|accessdate=July 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Compilation ==
Currently, the main RIM Chart lists the Top 20 most streamed songs in Malaysia, with a separate chart for the Top 10 most streamed domestic songs.&lt;ref name="rimchartsreturnstar2"/&gt; Only streams that are played for more than 30 seconds are included in the chart, and while both paid tier (premium) and free tier (ad-supported) streams are included, the numbers are not cumulative, meaning the charts will only monitor what the most streamed songs are for that given week. Airplay or internet simulcasting is excluded from the charts, however, playlists created by third parties are included in the charts. In addition, plays from radio features of certain on-demand streaming services (e.g. Spotify’s radio feature) will not be counted for chart purposes.&lt;ref name="rimchartsreturn"/&gt;

The '''rose fish''' (''Sebastes norvegicus''), also known as the '''ocean perch''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fooduniversity.com/foodu/seafood_c/resources/ocean%20fin/Cold%20Water/perch/PerchAtlantic.html food university]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.askthemeatman.com/ocean_perch.htm ask the meat man]&lt;/ref&gt; '''Atlantic redfish''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rtlinternational.co.uk/atlantic-red-fish/ RTL international]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brownetrading.com/recipes-and-resources/brownes-species-spotlight/atlantic-redfish/ Browne trading]&lt;/ref&gt; '''Norway haddock''', '''red perch''', '''red bream''', '''golden redfish''' or '''''hemdurgan''''', is a deep sea species of [[Sebastidae|rockfish]] from the North Atlantic. It is a large, slow-growing, late-maturing fish and the subject of a fishery.

==Taxonomy==
Misleadingly, it is sometimes called [[Ballan wrasse|bergylt]], [[Bream (disambiguation)|bream]], or [[Lutjanidae|snapper]], though it is unrelated to all of these. In the past, the scientific name ''Sebastes marinus'' was frequently used, but this is actually a [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonym]] of ''[[Painted comber|Serranus scriba]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ITIS |id=166745 |taxon=Sebastes marinus |accessdate=24 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Behaviour==
This [[food fish]] lives off the coasts of northern Europe and eastern North America. Adults are found off the coast at depths of {{convert|100|to|1000|m|abbr=on}};&lt;ref name=fishbase&gt;{{FishBase|genus=Sebastes|species=norvegicus|year=2012|month=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; juveniles may be found in coastal waters such as fjords. The adults are slow-moving, gregarious fish, of some commercial importance. They can reach {{convert|1|m|abbr=on}}, though most only are about half that length.&lt;ref name=fishbase/&gt; They are [[viviparous]]. Individuals live up to 75 years and enter reproduction rather late.&lt;ref name="gp1"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100818214829/http://marktcheck.greenpeace.at/3445.html Greenpeace: Rotbarsch]&lt;/ref&gt; While the young fish are of [[brown]]ish color, the adults are bright red.

The rose fish appeared on a 15-[[pfennig]] stamp of [[West Germany]] in 1964.

== Fishery ==
One of the main fishing areas of the rose fish is the [[Irminger Sea]] between [[Iceland]] and southeastern [[Greenland]].
While annual catches during the 1980s and 90s were less than 20 kilotons, this has increased dramatically since 1999, to between 40 and 60 kilotons. In 2000, almost 80 kilotons were caught. Since then, annual catch has declined back to between 40 and 60 kilotons. The meat of this fish is almost always sold filleted, often frozen.

Since the mid-2000s, populations have been considered severely overfished.&lt;ref name="gp1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dradio.de/dlf/sendungen/umwelt/332118/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.greenpeace.de/themen/meere/fischerei/welcher-fisch-darf-auf-den-teller&lt;/ref&gt; According to Greenpeace, some populations are no longer reproducing sufficiently, and their chances of recovery are slim.&lt;ref name="gp1" /&gt; In 2010, [[Greenpeace International]] added the rose fish to its seafood red list.&lt;!-- "The Greenpeace International seafood red list is a list of fish that are commonly sold in supermarkets around the world, and which have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries." --&gt;&lt;ref name="greenpeace"&gt;{{cite web|title=Red List - Seafood to avoid at the grocery store|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/oceans/seafood/red-list-of-species/|website=Greenpeace International|publisher=Greenpeace|accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also on [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]]'s list of fish species to avoid, unless the fishery is certified by [[Marine Stewardship Council|MSC]].&lt;ref name="wwf"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kalaopas - Puna-ahven|url=http://wwf.fi/kalaopas/#puna-ahven|website=WWF Finland|publisher=WWF Finland|accessdate=19 February 2016|language=Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.de/eu-demand-for-fish-exceeds-sustainable-supply/a-17546155|title=EU demand for fish exceeds sustainable supply|last=Kinkartz|first=Sabine|date=5 April 2014|publisher=Deutsche Welle|accessdate=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of November 2014, there is one MSC-certified fishery for ''Sebastes norvegicus''.&lt;ref&gt;https://fisheries.msc.org/en/fisheries/isf-iceland-golden-redfish-blue-ling-and-tusk/@@view&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ships of the royal navy.jpg|right|thumb|Cover of 2006 edition.]]

'''''Ships of the Royal Navy''''' is a naval history reference work by [[J. J. Colledge]] (1908–1997); it provides brief entries on all recorded ships in commission in the [[Royal Navy]] from the 15th century, giving location of constructions, date of launch, tonnage, specification and fate.

It was published in two volumes by Greenhill Books. Volume 1, first published in 1969, covers major ships; Volume 2, first published in 1970, covers Navy-built [[naval trawler|trawlers]], [[Naval drifter|drifters]], [[Tugboat|tugs]] and requisitioned ships including [[Auxiliary cruiser|Armed Merchant Cruisers]].

The book is the standard single-volume reference work on ships of the Royal Navy, and Colledge's conventions and spellings of names are used by museums, libraries and archives. For more data on the ships of the pre-1863 British Navy, see ''[[British Warships in the Age of Sail]]''.

A revised third version of the Volume 1 work was published in 2003 which added the ships of the late 20th century. The revision was conducted by [[Ben Warlow]]. A fourth edition was published in 2006, reinstating some of the smaller vessels that the third edition had omitted.  A further revised fourth edition was published in 2010 to include requisitioned ships, e.g. [[Armed merchantman|Armed merchant cruisers]], [[Merchant aircraft carrier]]s, as well as small craft, e.g. [[landing craft]] and [[Admiralty]]-built trawlers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3122">The '''Siberian Chronicles''' (''Сибирские летописи'' in [[Russian language|Russian]]) are the [[Russia]]n [[chronicle]]s of the late 16th - 18th centuries on the [[history of Siberia]]. They include the [[Yesipov Chronicle]], [[Kungur Chronicle]], [[Remezov Chronicle]], [[Stroganov Chronicle]], and others. These chronicles represent a valuable source on the early history of the Russian [[Siberia]]. Some of the chronicles were compiled later, such as ''Записки к Сибирской истории служащие'' (Notes, Dedicated to the History of Siberia) and ''Новая Сибирская летопись'' (New Siberian Chronicle) by I.Cherepanov, ''Летопись г. Иркутска с 1652 г. до наших дней'' (Chronicle of the City of [[Irkutsk]] from 1652 to present day) by P.Pezhemsky, ''Краткая летопись Енисейского и Туруханского края Енисейской губернии'' (A Brief Chronicle of the [[Yenisey]] and [[Turukhansk]] [[Krai]]s of the Yenisey [[Guberniya]]) (1594–1893) by A.I.Kytmanov. Altogether, there are more than forty known Siberian Chronicles.

The questions of origins and authenticity of the Siberian Chronicles were dealt with in different ways by the Russian [[historiographer]]s. The traditional scheme of development of the Siberian chronicle-writing was proposed by [[Sergei Bakhrushin]]. He thought that [[Yermak Timofeyevich|Yermak]]'s companions compiled the so-called ''Написание, како приидоша в Сибирь...'' (Notes on How We Came to Siberia) in 1621, which didn't survive to this day. Based on these notes, they compiled the so-called ''Синодик Тобольского собора'' in 1622, or [[Synodikon]] of the [[Tobolsk]] [[Cathedral]] (синодик, from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''synodikón'', which means a list of the dead submitted to church for remembrance in prayer). A chronicler [[Savva Yesipov]] compiled his own chronicle in 1636 based on the ''Notes...'' and ''Synodikon''. In mid-17th century, they compiled the Stroganov Chronicle based on the ''Notes...'' and [[archive]]s of the [[Stroganovs]], which has no immediate connection with the Yesipov Chronicle. In the late 16th - second half of the 17th century, they compiled the Kungur Chronicle based on verbal narrations of Yermak's companions and [[folklore]] of the late 16th century. The Remezov Chronicle was compiled in the late 17th century. Around that time, the so-called ''Описание Новые Земли Сибирского государства'' (Description of the New Lands of the Siberian State) was written by Nikifor Venyukov.

'''''The Navigator''''', written by [[Zadok Cramer]] and first published in 1801, was a guide for settlers and travelers moving westward into or through the interior of the United States during the first half of the 19th century.  

Its subject matter is described on its title page:

{{blockquote| 
"''The Navigator'';
containing directions for navigating
The [[Monongahela River|Monongahela]], [[Allegheny River|Allegheny]], [[Ohio River|Ohio]] and [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] Rivers;
with an ample account of these much admired waters,
from the head of the former to the mouth of the latter;
and a concise description of their
towns, villages, harbors, settlements, &amp;c.
With maps of the Ohio and Mississippi.
To which is added an appendix,
containing an account of Louisiana, 
and of the Missouri and Columbia Rivers
as discovered by the voyage under [[Lewis and Clark|Louis and Clarke]].
Eighth Edition--Improved and Enlarged."
}}

Cramer enlarged, corrected and expanded it through 12 editions in 25 years.  Though priced at one dollar it was very popular.  

The eighth edition was published in 1814, contained 369 pages, as well as dozens of maps detailing the navigable waterways and all their hazards.  

In 1966 a [[facsimile]] version of the eighth edition was printed and bound in [[hardcover]] by Readex Microprint Corporation, and was assigned the [[Library of Congress]] Catalog Card number 66-26332.

The '''''Wernigerode Armorial''''' ([[Bavarian State Library]] Cod.icon. 308 n, known in German as '''''Wernigeroder Wappenbuch''''' or '''''Schaffhausensches Wappenbuch''''') is an [[armorial]] compiled in southern Germany (possibly near [[Nördlingen]])&lt;ref&gt;The localisation at Nördlingen is based on a stamp on the cover, the motive "lamb 22a" according to ''Die Schwenke-Sammlung gotischer Stempel- und Einbanddurchreibungen nach Motiven geordnet und nach Werkstätten bestimmt und beschrieben von Ilse Schunke'', Berlin, 2 vols (1979-1996),Beiträge zur Inkunabelkunde 3.&lt;/ref&gt; in the late 15th century (between 1486–1492).

The book was formerly in possession of the ''Schaffhauser'' family of Schaffhausen, [[Ehingen am Ries]], near Nördlingen, later kept in the Stolberg library of [[Wernigerode]]&lt;ref&gt;H. Herricht, Die ehemalige Stolberg-Wernigerodische Handschriftenabteilung. Die Geschichte einer kleinen feudalen Privatsammlung. Halle/Saale 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; (signature Zi 33), with the dissolution of this library in 1927/8 passing into the private possession of Otto Hupps, and finally bought by the Bavarian State Library in 1949. The manuscript is the first of originally two volumes; the second volume has been lost. A third volume consists of a register to vols. 1 and 2, kept in the Halle University Library (signature Halle, UuLB: Zi 33).

It is an important witness of the transitional period from medieval to classical (early modern) conventions of [[heraldry]] (e.g. the [[Papal coats of arms|papal arms]] are shown with the [[keys of Peter]] crossing behind the shield, a fashion which only gradually became adopted by the popes themselves during the 16th century, while the crossing keys above the shield were first used a few decades earlier, [[Pope Martin V|c. 1420s]]).&lt;ref name="Woodward153"&gt;John Woodward, ''A Treatise on Ecclesiastical Heraldry'', 1894, [https://archive.org/stream/atreatiseoneccl00woodgoog#page/n248/mode/2up p. 153f.]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 261 folia it presents various [[coats of arms]], as was the custom at the time in order of descending rank, beginning with a number of purely fictitious or symbolic coats of arms, that  [[Shield of the Trinity|of God]], of [[Jesus Christ]], of [[Death]], of the "first arms" of kings ''Abysay, Sabytay, Banabias'', of "King Alphonsus of Castilia", "the holy King Job", the "holy knight Eustachius", followed by the (real) royal arms of Sweden, Austria and Thuringia, and the [[attributed arms]] of the [[Nine Worthies]].

After this, the armorial presents the actual coats of arms in use at the time, beginning with the [[papal coats of arms|papal arms]] of [[Innocent VIII]], the imperial arms of [[Habsburg Austria]] and the [[Reichsadler|Imperial Eagle]] of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], the royal arms of [[kingdom of France|France]] (already attributed to Godfrey above), [[kingdom of England|England]] and Greece.  More royal and ducal arms are given, partly real and partly fictitious, including those of the [[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]], [[Wessex]](?), Italy (kingdom of Naples), Ireland, Outremer (the [[Jerusalem Cross]]), and of "Calistria, queen of the Amazons", Brittany, "the great Khan", Arabia, Nineveh, Granada,&lt;!--needs more work--&gt;
[[Bavaria]], [[Hessen]], [[Bavaria-Straubing]] and the [[Duke of Teck]], [[Lorenzo de' Medici]], the "Sultan of Jerusalem", some "eastern empires" such as Persia, India, [[Prester John]], "Constantine" (Byzantium, showing the arms of the [[Latin Empire]]), Cathay (China), [[kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], [[Aragon]], Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Iceland, Poland, Antiochia, Ethiopia, Salerno, Castilia, Troy, Nebuchadnezzar, Nero. 

After this preface, the book begins a more realistic listing of the heraldry of its time, beginning on fol. 20v, organized as follows:
The arms of the territories and noble families of the [[kingdom of Spain]], of the high nobility of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], [[Burgundy]], [[Savoy]], [[Milan]] and [[kingdom of Naples|Naples]] (ff. 20-29); the higher nobility of the Holy Roman Empire in the duchies of [[Kleve]], [[Geldern]], [[Liegnitz]], [[Werdenberg (Holy Roman Empire)|Werdenberg]], [[Württemberg]], the [[Habsburg]] territories, and the arms of various counts (foll. 29-85). 
This is followed by the arms of lower nobility and certain notable bourgeois families (foll. 86-255) and the arms of [[imperial city|imperial cities]] (foll. 257-262).

'''William "Billy" Suhr''' (b. March 31, 1896 [[Kreuzberg (Ahr)]] &amp;ndash; d. January 19, 1984 [[Mt. Kisco, NY]]) was an American art conservator who led the conservation department of the [[Frick Collection]] from 1935 to 1977.&lt;ref name=in&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stoner |first1=Joyce Hill |last2= |first2= |date=1981 |title=Pioneers in American Museums: William Suhr [Interview] |url= |journal=Museum News |volume=60 |issue= |pages=30–35 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Born to [[Midwestern]] [[Americans|American]] citizens living in Germany, William Suhr began his career as an apprentice to a stone mason, "specializing" in stone [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]]s.&lt;ref name=in&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ny&gt;{{cite news |last=Brenson |first=Michael |date={{date|1984-1-20|mdy}} |title=William Suhr, Restorer of Art |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/20/obituaries/william-suhr-restorer-of-art.html?mcubz=2 |work=New York Times |location=New York |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
After three years there, he began studying at the [[Prussian Academy of Arts]], where he met and befriended [[art historian]] Max Deri, who introduced him to the art of [[conservation and restoration]].&lt;ref name=in&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Since there were no formal restoration schools at the time, he was essentially self-taught. Working independently in [[Berlin]], he built up his reputation through collaborations with art dealing firm [[Thomas Agnew &amp; Sons]].&lt;ref name=in&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Career==
Suhr's success in Berlin caught the attention of [[Wilhelm Valentiner]], formerly of the [[Kaiser Friedrich Museum]], who became director of the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]] in 1924.&lt;ref name=ed&gt;{{cite book |last=Munhall |first=Edgar |date=1996 |title=Remembering Billy Suhr |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Remembering_Billy_Suhr.html?id=QBKwpwAACAAJ |location=New York |publisher=s.n. |page=15 |isbn= |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927, Suhr accepted Valentiner's invitation to join him in [[Detroit]], where he continued his conservation practice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt0489r57d/ Online Archive of California: Getty Research Institute: Finding aid for the William Suhr papers, 1846-2003, (bulk 1928-1982)]&lt;/ref&gt; He worked there until 1935, at which time [[Frederick Mortimer Clapp]] offered him a job as permanent conservator at the [[Frick Collection]] in [[New York City]]. In this role, he was able to take commissions from the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], including an extensive restoration of [[Robert Campin]]'s [[Mérode Altarpiece]], now housed at [[The Cloisters]].&lt;ref name=in&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to his Frick Collection colleague [[Edgar Munhall]], Suhr's clients included [[Jules Bache]], [[Alfred Smith Barnes|Alfred Barnes]], [[Mildred Barnes Bliss]], [[Walter Chrysler]], [[Kenneth Clark]], [[Stephen Carlton Clark|Stephen Clark]], [[Chester Dale]], [[Joseph Duveen, 1st Baron Duveen]], [[Edsel Ford]], [[Helen Clay Frick]], [[William Randolph Hearst]], [[Edward James]], [[Samuel Henry Kress]], [[Paul Mellon]], [[John D. Rockefeller, Jr.]], and [[Georges Wildenstein]]. Though he dealt primarily with artwork by [[Old Masters]], he also helped conserve works by contemporary artists [[Salvador Dalí]] and [[Lyonel Feininger]].&lt;ref name=ed&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his forty years at the Frick Collection, he kept meticulous records of the conservation procedures he performed, including more than 95 cleaning reports complete with treatment plans, thorough descriptions, and before-and-after photographs.&lt;ref name=ed&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

Suhr retired from the Frick Collection in 1977. He passed away in 1984, survived by his wife Henriette.&lt;ref name=ny&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; His papers are held at the [[Getty Research Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives2.getty.edu:8082/xtf/view?docId=ead/870697/870697.xml Getty Research Institute: Finding Aid for the William Suhr Papers, 1846-2003 (bulk 1927-1982)]&lt;/ref&gt; His letters are held at the [[Archives of American Art]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/william-suhr-letters-9987 Archives of American Art: Finding Aid for William Suhr Letters, 1927-1959]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

First published in 1906, by [[A &amp; C Black|Adam &amp; Charles Black]], the original ''Writers’ &amp; Artists’ Yearbook'' was an 80-page booklet, costing one [[shilling]]. It gave details of seven literary agents and 89 publishers.&lt;ref Name=BBC/&gt; It has been published on an annual basis since, expanding over time to include information for illustrators and photographers.&lt;ref Name=BBC/&gt; A&amp;C Black became part of [[Bloomsbury Publishing]] in 2000, and other titles in its reference division include ''[[Who's Who (UK)|Who's Who]]'', ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack|Wisden]]'' and ''[[Black's Medical Dictionary]]''.&lt;ref name="A &amp; C Black"&gt;{{cite news|last=Neill|first=Graeme|title=Coleman to leave A &amp; C Black for Magi|url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/coleman-leave-c-black-magi.html|accessdate=2 March 2014|newspaper=The Bookseller|date=2 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Articles offering advice first appeared in the 1914 yearbook.

In 2004, Bloomsbury launched the ''Children's Writers' and Artists' Yearbook'' that includes articles and advice specifically focused on the children's book market. It contains articles from many successful children's authors across different genres from picture books to YA novels. The latest 2018 edition includes advice from Quentin Blake, Michael Morpurgo, Anne Fine, Michael Rosen, Sarah Mussi, and Sally Green amongst others. 

=== Website and competitions ===

In 2007, ''Writers' &amp; Artists' Yearbook'' launched an associated website (www.writersandartists.co.uk). Initially this was only accessible to anyone purchasing the print edition.&lt;ref name="website launch"&gt;{{cite web|title=New website with free resources for writers and artists|url=http://www.publishers.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=554:new-website-with-free-resources-for-writers-and-artists&amp;catid=80:general-news&amp;Itemid=1617|publisher=Publishers Association|accessdate=2 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the website was relaunched and now includes blogs from guest authors and a social networking feature that enables authors and artists to add a public profile.&lt;ref name=Bookseller&gt;{{cite news|last=Gallagher|first=Victoria|title=Writers and Artists Yearbook launches social networking|url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/writers-and-artists-yearbook-launches-social-networking.html|accessdate=2 March 2014|date=7 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This free website offers a community platform, an extensive collection of free advice articles on the writing and publishing process, ways to contact publishers and the best advice on how to get your book publisher, along with a shop where you can purchase not only the ''Writers' &amp; Artists' Yearbook'', but additional books that offer helpful advice and expertise for writers of fiction, non-fiction, poetry, stage and screen.
