'''Qualification''' for the '''2012 [[United States Women's Curling Championship]]''' took place in one round in January in [[Marshfield, Wisconsin|Marshfield]], [[Wisconsin]]. The number of entrants to the national championships was cut down to ten teams through a challenge round.

==Qualification System==
Teams qualified for the women's nationals either by qualifying automatically as one of the top four teams on the [[World Curling Tour]] Order of Merit or by qualifying through the challenge round. The four teams that qualified automatically to the championships, an increase from last year's two teams qualified through the Order of Merit, were chosen based on the Order of Merit upon the conclusion of the [[Curl Mesabi Cash Spiel]].&lt;ref name="rulebook"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usacurl.org/curlingrocks//images//crb_6.pdf|title=2011–12 USCA Championships Rules and Procedures|author=[[United States Curling Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This year, the teams are those skipped by [[Erika Brown]], [[Rebecca Hamilton]], [[Patti Lank]], and [[Alexandra Carlson]].&lt;ref name="oomqual"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usacurl.org/curlingrocks//index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1387&amp;Itemid=108|title=Qualified teams, 2012 Nationals|publisher=[[USA Curling]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other six spots in the nationals will be awarded through competition in the challenge round.&lt;ref name="rulebook"/&gt;

The challenge round was held with the double knockout provision in place. The double knockout provision states that a team is eliminated from qualifying for the nationals if the team has at least two losses in their win-loss record. If there are teams with less than two losses, they will play each other until the number of teams still able to qualify matches the number of qualification spots available.

===Challenge Round===
Since there are more than ten teams registered to the nationals this year, the teams that did not qualify directly for the nationals competed to earn one of six remaining spots in the nationals through the challenge round, which was held from January 19 to 22 in [[Marshfield, Wisconsin]].&lt;ref name="rulebook"/&gt; The challenge round was held in a knockout format, as decided by the organizing committee.&lt;ref name="berth allocations"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usacurl.org/curlingrocks//index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1383&amp;Itemid=1|title=Berth allocations announced for Men's qualifiers; schedules set|publisher=[[United States Curling Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The teams that advanced from the challenge round were those skipped by [[Maureen Stolt]], [[Cassandra Potter]], [[Janice Langanke]], [[Allison Pottinger]], [[Aileen Sormunen]], [[Kimberly Wapola]].

==Challenge Round==
The challenge round was held from January 19 to 22 at the [[Marshfield Curling Club]] in [[Marshfield, Wisconsin|Marshfield]], [[Wisconsin]]. It was held in a triple knockout format.&lt;ref name="berth allocations"/&gt; Teams skipped by [[Maureen Stolt]], [[Cassandra Potter]], [[Janice Langanke]], [[Allison Pottinger]], [[Aileen Sormunen]], and [[Kimberly Wapola]] advanced to the Nationals.

'''Qualification''' for the '''2014 [[United States Men's Curling Championship]]''' consisted of three different paths. Four teams qualified directly through the High Performance Program or the Order of Merit system. The number of the remaining entrants to the national championships was cut down to six teams through a challenge round held in early January.

==Qualification system==
Teams can qualify to participate in the men's national championship through the High Performance Program, through the [[World Curling Tour]] Order of Merit, or through a challenge round.

Two spots in the nationals were awarded to two teams on the [[United States Curling Association]]'s High Performance National Program. The teams qualified through the High Performance Program were those skipped by [[John Shuster]] and [[Pete Fenson]]. Two more spots were awarded to the top two men's teams on the World Curling Tour Order of Merit standings table at the year's end. The teams qualified through the Order of Merit were those skipped by [[Heath McCormick]] and [[Brady Clark (curler)|Brady Clark]].

The remaining six spots in the nationals will be awarded to the teams that earn qualification spots through the [[#Challenge Round 2|challenge round]]. The challenge round will be held in a triple knockout format.

==Challenge Round==
The challenge round for the men's nationals will be held from January 9 to 12 at the [[Four Seasons Curling Club]] in [[Blaine, Minnesota|Blaine]], [[Minnesota]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teamusa.org/USA-Curling/Features/2014/January/07/Challenge-Round-begins-Thursday|title=Challenge Round begins Thursday|date=7 January 2014|publisher=[[USA Curling]]|accessdate=9 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
''[[The St. Louis American]]'' called the world premiere production of ''27'' a "flawless commissioned portrait of Gertrude Stein,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stlamerican.com/entertainment/living_it/article_47cc059e-f883-11e3-bbad-0019bb2963f4.html|title=Opera Theatre St. Louis stages flawless commissioned portrait of Gertrude Stein|work=The St. Louis American|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Ray Mark Rinaldi of ''[[The Denver Post]]'' said that the opera "tells a great American story, as well as American opera in the 21st century" suggesting that "it is every century's job to define the century before it, and ''27'' isn't afraid to do that with certainty and depth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.denverpost.com/artmosphere/2014/06/24/27-tells-american-story-touching-american-way/11181/|title=''27'' tells a great American story, about Gertrude Stein as well as American opera in the 21st century|work=Artmosphere|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her review for the ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'', Sarah Bryan Miller called the work "serious fun" praising Gordon's creation of "hummable tunes and recurring themes, drama and sweetness, in a well-wrought score. Vavrek is Steinian without stealing Stein and keeps the story moving, for a clever, witty libretto,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stltoday.com/entertainment/arts-and-theatre/opera-review-opera-theatre-s-is-serious-fun/article_d0793253-c2ca-50d6-bb42-29a34c027469.html|title=Opera review: Opera Theatre's '27' is serious fun|author=|work=stltoday.com|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Anne Midgette]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote that "[Gordon] clearly found much to inspire him in this libretto and subject, to judge from a score that has an engaging vitality from the opening bars, and is delightfully studded with allusions (a touch of ''[[Lakmé]]'', a hint of ''[[Vanessa (opera)|Vanessa]]'') and adroit vocal ensembles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/style/wp/2014/06/18/gertrude-stein-sings-in-new-opera-in-st-louis/|title=Gertrude Stein sings in new opera in St. Louis|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heidi Waleson of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' commented that "[t]he first thing that you notice about Ricky Ian Gordon's ''27'', an opera about Gertrude Stein that recently had its world premiere at Opera Theatre of Saint Louis, is that it moves. Royce Vavrek, the librettist, taking his cue from Stein's own short phrases and cells of text, created a playful, quick-witted libretto that pushed Mr. Gordon beyond his trademark melodies into a brighter, friskier style."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/opera-review-gertrude-stein-in-st-louis-1403562334|title=Opera Review: Gertrude Stein in St. Louis|date=23 June 2014|work=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critic Scott Cantrell of ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'' wrote that "''27'' is an unabashedly populist treatment of a yeasty artistic period, in musical idioms that wouldn't have raised an eyebrow in 1920s Paris,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/entertainment/columnists/scott-cantrell/20140618-gertrude-stein-alice-b.-toklas-come-to-operatic-life-in-st.-louis.ece|title=Gertrude Stein, Alice B. Toklas come to operatic life in St. Louis|work=The Dallas Morning News|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and further described Gordon's score as "tuneful, Frenchified neoclassicism" likening it to the work of [[Lennox Berkeley]] and [[Aaron Copland]].

All five singers received unanimous praise, with Blythe garnering rapturous notices for her portrayal of Stein, and Futral celebrated for her performance as Toklas: "It is no small matter that the piece was written for Stephanie Blythe, an outsize personality herself, whose grand, multifaceted mezzo brings the character to vibrant life." (Waleson, ''Wall Street Journal'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/opera-review-gertrude-stein-in-st-louis-1403562334|title=Opera Review: Gertrude Stein in St. Louis|date=23 June 2014|work=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Stephanie Blythe is Gertrude; Elizabeth Futral is Alice. Individually and together, they are brilliant, as is the rest of the cast." (Robert W. Duffy, St. Louis Public Radio)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/reflection-27-opera-theatre-again-uses-powerful-art-challenge|title=Reflection: In ''27'', Opera Theatre Again Uses Powerful Art To Challenge|author=Robert W. Duffy|publisher=News.stlpublicradio.org|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[A] good vehicle for Blythe, who can handle the turns and whose natural magnetism goes a long way toward helping us understand the power Stein had over her world. Futral, one of the better singing actresses working today, makes the relationship believable." (Rinaldi, ''Denver Post'') "[W]ith sublime, powerful, expressive voices, superstars Stephanie Blythe and Elizabeth Futral were a joy to behold, deserving of their robust ovations. [...] Remember the names Theo Lebow, Tobias Greenhalgh and Daniel Brevik. They excelled at portraying all the male characters distinctively and effortlessly, showcasing solid acting and strong singing in intricate, demanding supporting roles." (Lynn Venhaus, ''[[Belleville News-Democrat]]'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bnd.com/2014/06/24/3272626/opera-theatre-review-veteran-and.html|title=Metro-east news from Belleville, IL|work=Belleville News-Democrat|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Aluth Sahal Mangalle''' or the '''New Rice Festival''' is a [[harvest festival]] of the [[Maha kannaya]] in [[Sri Lanka]]. The first batch of new rice after being plucked, [[threshed]] and [[winnowed]] is offered to the Lord Buddha and deities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sridaladamaligawa.lk/annual-new-rice-festival-sri-dalada-maligawa Annual New Rice Festival of Sri Dalada Maligawa]&lt;/ref&gt;

Every January [[Poya Day]], new rice festival commences. Rice and paddy donated to [[Temple of the Tooth]] are stored at [[Kundasale]] [[Pallekele]] in a separate location allocation and distribution of Rice and paddy to [[Devales]] relevant, is done. A traditional procession takes place from the Palace to Kundasale headed by [[Diyawadaered]] to the sacred tooth relic.

Only after the new rice festival at the Sri Dalada Maligawa and offering rice to the sacred tooth relic, can the farmers around the country collect their harvest and commence their own new rice festivals in the respective villages.

The most important new rice festival that happens afterwards is the Aluth Sahal Mangalle at the [[Sri Maha Bodhi]] in [[Anuradhapura]].

This festival was started by a king called Sri weera parakrama narendrasinghe in 1707. Diyawadana Nilame does the main part in this festival. This is about the first harvest in paddy situated in kundasale. Diyawadana nilame and the rest of the people got Kundasale with perahara and take the harvest and come back to the temple of tooth relic. This is done in nice fashion always, according to the tradition these traditions are done in much respect, for tooth relic of Lord Buddha. A man called Nakath Mohottala also does a main part in this festival. He prepares an agenda called 'Nakth pathraya' and whole things were done on it.

The '''American-led intervention in the Syrian Civil War''' refers to US support of [[Syrian opposition]] and the [[Rojava|Federation of Northern Syria]] during the course of the [[Syrian Civil War]], and active involvement of US military against the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] and against the [[al-Nusra Front]] from 2014. Since 2017, the US and some other Coalition nations have also targeted military positions of the Syrian Government.

The [[United States]] first supplied the rebels of the [[Free Syrian Army]] with non-lethal aid (including food rations and pickup trucks), but quickly began providing training, cash, and intelligence to selected Syrian rebel commanders. During the [[Syrian Civil War]], which began in 2011, two US programs attempted to assist the Syrian rebels. One was a military program that planned to train and equip 15,000 Syrian rebels, but was canceled in 2015 after spending $500 million and producing only a few dozen fighters.&lt;ref name=nyt-3-8-17/&gt; A $1 billion covert program  run by the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] was more successful, but was decimated by Russian bombing and canceled in mid-2017 by the [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Trump administration]].&lt;ref name=nyt-3-8-17&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/02/world/middleeast/cia-syria-rebel-arm-train-trump.html|title=Behind the Sudden Death of a $1 Billion Secret C.I.A.

According to a report by Amnesty International, the US-led coalition has provided falsified data to conceal the actual number of civilian deaths resulting from their bombing campaigns and is "deeply in denial" about civilian casualties in Raqqa.

US State Department cables indicate that regime change was a secret goal of the American government in the years leading up to the civil war, even during the period when Barack Obama was publicly engaging with Bashar Al-Assad. A 2006 memorandum by [[William Roebuck]] of the embassy in Damascus stated:&lt;blockquote&gt;We believe Bashar's weaknesses are in how he chooses to react to looming issues, both perceived and real, such as...the potential threat to the regime from the increasing presence of transiting Islamist extremists. This cable summarizes our assessment of these vulnerabilities and suggests that there may be actions, statements and signals that the USG can send that will improve the likelihood of such opportunities arising.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Roebuck, who went on to be [[Chargé d'affaires|charge d'affair]] of the Libyan embassy under Obama, also considered the advantages of promoting religious sectarianism in Syria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5s7SCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT280&amp;lpg=PT280&amp;dq=roebuck,+overreact&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mIGJx-n11s&amp;sig=TqehusGIId8di8bHyX8PwyD7BtQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiO_vago7rbAhVKVxQKHRmjAGAQ6AEIXjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=roebuck,%20overreact&amp;f=false|title=The WikiLeaks Files: The World According to US Empire|last=Naiman|first=Robert|last3=|date=2015-09-15|publisher=Verso Books - Random House|year=|isbn=9781781689448|location=|pages=|language=en|chapter=Chapter 10 "Syria"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the start of the [[Arab Spring]] in 2011, [[Civil uprising phase of the Syrian Civil War|protests]] in Syria against the Assad administration were violently suppressed and a civil war began.&lt;ref name="ISW-2011-12"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Holliday |first1=Joseph |title=The Struggle for Syria in 2011 – An Operational and Regional Analysis |url=http://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Struggle_For_Syria.pdf |publisher=[[Institute for the Study of War]] |accessdate=20 September 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6SibrK1K7?url=http://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Struggle_For_Syria.pdf |archivedate=20 September 2014 |date=December 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2012 there were several armed opposition groups operating in the country, including the [[Free Syrian Army]], formed in July 2011 by officers who defected from the [[Syrian Armed Forces]].

The al-Nusra Front was eclipsed by its own creator, and [[al-Qaeda]] severed its ties to the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] in February 2014, after an eight-month power struggle.&lt;ref name="Politico-2014-5-23"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Abouzeid |first1=Rania |title=The Jihad Next Door – The roots of Iraq's newest civil war |url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/06/al-qaeda-iraq-syria-108214_full.html |accessdate=20 September 2014 |date=23 June 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6SicnSsTj?url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/06/al-qaeda-iraq-syria-108214_full.html |archivedate=20 September 2014 |newspaper=[[Politico]] |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== July 2014 rescue mission ===
{{Main|2014 American rescue mission in Syria}}
&lt;!--Summarize and condense. Main article already included--&gt;
Following the abduction of a number of foreigners in Syria, on 4 July 2014, the U.S. carried out an operation to rescue foreign hostages being held by ISIL. U.S. airstrikes were conducted against an ISIL military base known as the "Osama bin Laden Camp" while at the same time, two dozen [[US special forces]] soldiers parachuted from helicopters near an ISIS building, thought to be for high-value prisoners. No prisoners were found in the building and the soldiers were quickly engaged by ISIL forces dispatched from [[Raqqa]], which started a three-hour firefight.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/11049814/The-failed-US-mission-to-try-and-rescue-James-Foley-from-Islamic-State-terrorists.html|title=The failed US mission to try and rescue James Foley from Islamic State terrorists|date=21 August 2014|accessdate=19 September 2014|last = Sherlock|first = Ruth|last2 = Malouf|first2 = Carol|last3 = Ensor|first3 = Josie|location = [[Erbil]], [[Iraqi Kurdistan]]|newspaper = [[The Daily Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. forces concluded that the hostages were no longer at the site and abandoned the rescue attempt. At least five ISIL fighters were killed and one U.S. soldier was wounded. Jordanian forces were also reportedly involved in the operation, with one Jordanian soldier reportedly wounded, but Jordanian involvement was not confirmed. Later on, it was reported that the hostages had been moved 24 hours before the attempted rescue.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt; Following the mission, it was still unclear whether the operation failed due to bad intelligence or whether ISIL forces were alerted in advance of the mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/world/middleeast/la-fg-us-syria-hostage-failed-rescue-mission-20140820-story.html|title=Rising danger prompted U.S. effort to rescue James Foley, other hostages|date=22 August 2014|accessdate=19 September 2014|last = Hennessey|first = Kathleen|last2 = Hennigan|first2 = W.J.|newspaper = [[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 August 2014, the U.S. began sending [[Aerial reconnaissance|surveillance flights]], including [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drones]], over Syria to gather intelligence on ISIL targets.

=== Preparations for American airstrikes ===
In his address to the nation on 10 September 2014, U.S. President Obama announced his intention to bomb ISIL targets in Syria and called on Congress to authorize a program to train and arm rebels who were fighting ISIL and the Syrian forces of [[Bashar al-Assad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/09/obama-strike-wherever-it-exists-2014910223935601193.html|title=Obama outlines plan to target IS fighters|publisher=[[Al Jazeera]]|date=11 September 2014|accessdate=24 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time, he authorized direct attacks against the militant group in Syria. In his address, he said the United States were going on offensive, launching "a steady, relentless effort to take out" the group "wherever they exist." Obama also announced creating of a broader coalition against ISIL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Miller|first=Zake|title=Obama Says U.S. Will Bomb ISIS in Syria, Train Rebels|url=http://time.com/3319658/obama-isis-speech-iraq-syria/|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=10 September 2014|accessdate=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commenting on Obama's address, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman {{Interlanguage link multi|Alexander Lukashevich|2=ru|3=Лукашевич, Александр Казимирович|preserve=1}} opposed the U.S. intervention against ISIL in Syria "without the consent of the legitimate government" and said that "this step, in the absence of a UN Security Council decision, would be an act of aggression, a gross violation of international law". [[Ali Haidar (politician)|Ali Haidar]], Syrian minister of national reconciliation, said that "any action of any kind without the consent of the Syrian government would be an attack on Syria".&lt;ref name="russiasyr"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-29154481|title=Russia warns US against strikes on Islamic State in Syria|work=[[BBC News]]|date=11 September 2014|accessdate=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 September, the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] approved Obama's plan to train and arm the Syrian rebels in their fight against ISIL. In a statement following the House vote, Obama said that the United States wouldn't send military troops to Syria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Keefe|first=Ed|title=House approves Obama's Iraq-Syria military strategy amid skepticism|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/congress-poised-to-approve-obamas-iraq-syria-military-strategy-amid-skepticism/2014/09/17/c2494df2-3e85-11e4-b0ea-8141703bbf6f_story.html|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=17 September 2014|accessdate=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Senate|Senate]] gave final congressional approval to Obama's proposal the next day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carter|first1=Chelsea J.|last2=Starr|first2=Barbara|title=Obama: ISIS threat against U.S., allies 'doesn't frighten us'|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/09/18/world/meast/isis-threat/|date=19 September 2014|accessdate=23 September 2014|publisher = CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. did not request permission from the Syrian government, nor did it coordinate its actions with the Syrian government, provide direct notification to the Syrian military or give indication of timing on specific targets, but it did notify the Syrian U.N. representative, which the Syrian government confirmed.&lt;ref name="voasyriaairstrikes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/us-arab-partners-air-strikes-islamic-state-syria/2459099.html|title=US: Syria Won't, Can't Stop Militant Safe Havens|publisher=[[Voice of America]]|date=23 September 2014|accessdate=23 September 2014|last = Pande|first = Aru|last2 = Babb|first2 = Carl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the airstrikes began, the United States also informed [[Iran]], the Assad government's largest regional ally, of their intention to launch airstrikes. It did not share specific timing or targets of strikes with the Iranian government but reportedly assured it that the US would not strike any Syrian government targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/23/us-syria-crisis-usa-iran-idUSKCN0HI2F220140923|title=Exclusive: U.S. told Iran of intent to strike Islamic State in Syria|publisher=Reuters|date=23 September 2014|accessdate=23 September 2014|last = Hafezi|first = Parisa|last2 = Charbonneau|first2 = Louis|last3 = Mohammed|first3 = Arshad|editor-last = Goller|editor-first = Howard|location = [[Headquarters of the United Nations|United Nations, New York City]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 June, as part of Russia's campaign to pressure the US to agree to closer cooperation over Syria, Russian military aircraft bombed, with cluster bombs, a military outpost in al-Tanf that was garrisoned by the New Syrian Army in south east Syria. US and British special forces based in Jordan regularly worked with Syrian rebels at the al-Tanf outpost, the airstrike happened 24 hours after a detachment of 20 British special forces left the outpost. After the airstrike took place, US commanders warned Russia that the garrison was part of the international coalition against IS and therefore shouldn't be attacked, but 90 minutes later, nearby US warplanes observed Russian jets dropping a second barrage of bombs on the outpost, killing 4 rebel soldiers. A US spy plane overhead tried to contact the Russian pilots on emergency frequencies, but the Russians did not answer. US officials demanded an explanation from Moscow, but they were told the Russian pilots struck the outpost because they thought it was ISIL base, Russian officials then said that Jordan had approved the strikes in advance, but Jordan denied it. Moscow also claimed its air command headquarters in Syria was unable to call off the strikes because the US had not given them the precise position of the outpost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/07/22/russia-bombed-sas-outpost-in-syria/|title=SAS  outpost in Syria 'bombed by Russians just hours after troops left'|publisher=the telegraph|date=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.militarytimes.com/story/military/2016/06/23/why-did-russia-bomb-american-backed-syria-rebels/86289354/|title=Russia's attack on U.S.-backed rebels in Syria puzzles, frustrates the Pentagon|publisher=military.com|date=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 June, as part of the [[2016 Abu Kamal offensive]] — the offensive by the New Syrian Army and several hundred other rebels from different factions that aims to capture [[Abu Kamal]] and sever ISISs transit link between Syria and Iraq; Pentagon-trained rebel forces entered the al-Hamdan air base — {{convert|3|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on|0}} northwest of the border town Abu Kamal following intense clashes. This followed significant advances into ISIL-held territory near the Abu Kamal border crossing, the NSA (New Syrian Army) said it had captured a number of IS positions on the outskirts of Abu Kamal, but a raid into the town at dawn was reported to have been repelled by militants. Fighting continued around the town, as coalition airstrikes were carried out on IS hidehouts; the NSA also said it was co-ordinating the assault with Iraqi government forces, who were advancing on the border from the other side. NSA issued a statement saying "the NSA maintains control of the desert, the approaches to Abu Kamal, and maintains freedom of manoeuvre". later on that day, IS militants ambushed the rebels, inflicting heavy casualties and seizing weapons according to a rebel source. IS retook the airbase from the NSA and continued to advance against the rebels, recapturing some of the outposts the NSA had captured south of the town; coalition helicopters dropped in "foreign" airborne troops on the southern edge of Abu Kamal to help the rebels in their advance, coalition jets also carried out 8 airstrikes on IS targets in the Abu Kamal area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-36660861|title=Syria conflict: Rebels 'move on IS-held town near Iraq border'publisher=BBC News|date=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2016/06/29/world/middleeast/ap-ml-syria.html?_r=0|title=IS Repels Advance by US-Backed Syria Rebels Near Iraq Border|publisher=New York Times|date=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/06/isil-retakes-syria-border-town-backed-rebels-160629132742057.html|title=ISIL retakes Syria border town from US-backed rebels|publisher=Aljazeera|date=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/06/29/isis-repels-attack-by-us-backed-syrian-rebels-near-iraq-border.html|title=ISIS repels attack by US-backed Syrian rebels near Iraq border|publisher=fox news|date=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A contributing reasons for the failure of the operation was the withdrawing of air support at a critical moment, the aircraft assigned to the operation were ordered in the middle of the operation to leave the area and instead fly to the outskirts of Fallujah, where a large convoy of IS fighters had been seen trying to escape across the desert after the [[Battle of Fallujah (2016)|city was recaptured]] by the Iraqi army, and U.S. commanders decided that the convoy represented a "strategic target."

=====March 2017=====
[[File:US SOF near Manbij.png|thumb|[[United States special operations forces]] near Manbij, acting as advisors to the [[Syrian Democratic Forces]], March 2017]]
On 8 March, various news outlets reported that conventional US troops as part of an amphibious task force left their ships in the Middle East and deployed to Syria, where they established an outpost from which they can provide artillery support for U.S.-backed local forces who are preparing an assault Raqqa in the battle to liberate the city from IS militants. The deployment marks a new escalation in the U.S. war in Syria, and puts more conventional U.S. troops in the battle, that until now had primarily used Special Operations units. The force is part of the [[11th Marine Expeditionary Unit|11th MEU]], 400  [[United States Marine Corps|US Marines]] from the Battalion Landing Team [[1st Battalion, 4th Marines]] will crew an artillery battery of M-777 Howitzers; whilst additional infantrymen from the unit will provide security, while resupplies will be handled by part of the expeditionary force's combat logistics element. A defense official with direct knowledge of the operation said the Marines were flown from [[Djibouti]] to [[Kuwait]] and then into Syria. There are 900 US soldiers and Marines deployed to Syria in total (500 special forces troops were already on the ground to train and support the SDF); under the existing limits put in place by the Obama administration, the formal troop cap for Syria is 503, but commanders have the authority to temporarily exceed that limit to meet military requirements. There are approximately 100 [[75th Ranger Regiment (United States)|US Army Rangers]] in [[Stryker]]s and armored Humvees deployed in and around Manbij, US officials said. They are there to discourage Syrian, Russian, or Turkish troops from making any moves that could shift the focus away from an assault on IS militants, specifically preventing them inadvertently coming under fire. The US believes the pressure on ISIS in Raqqa is working, a US official said that intelligence indicates some ISIS leadership and operatives continue to try to leave the city. He added that there is also US intelligence that indicates the city is laced with trenches, tunnels, roadside bombs and houses and buildings wired to explode, which if correct indicates that the US has likely been able to gather intelligence from both overhead surveillance aircraft and people on the ground. However, the official also noted that "Raqqa will probably not be the final battle against ISIS" and added that the group still has some personnel dispersed in areas south and east of the city. According to the official the US estimates that ISIS could have roughly as many as 4,000 fighters in Raqqa. An official told ''the Guardian'' that in addition, the US is preparing to send hundreds of troops to Kuwait to be ready to fight Isis there if needed and the number would be fewer than 1,000. The ''Independent'' reported that Colonel John Dorrian, a spokesperson for Operation Inherent Resolve, said the artillery unit and the Army Rangers would not have a frontline role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2017/03/08/marines-have-arrived-in-syria-to-fire-artillery-in-the-fight-for-raqqa/|title=Marines have arrived in Syria to fire artillery in the fight for Raqqa|publisher=Washington post|date=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/08/politics/marines-raqqa-assault-syria/ |title=US Marines join local forces fighting in Raqqa|work=CNN|date=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/09/us-troops-arrival-syria-intensifies-struggle-for-influence|title=Arrival of US troops intensifies struggle for influence in Syria|publisher=the Guardian|date=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/09/world/middleeast/us-troops-syria.html?_r=0|title=U.S. Is Sending 400 More Troops to Syria|publisher=New York Times|date=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/09/us-sends-hundreds-of-marines-to-syria-to-support-fight-against-isis|title=US sends hundreds of marines to Syria to support fight against Isis|publisher=the Guardian|date=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/us-marine-corps-syria-raqqa-isis-stronghold-assault-attack-donald-trump-islamic-state-a7620236.html|title=US marines sent to Syria to help assault on Isis' Raqqa stronghold|publisher=the Independent|date=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Washington Post'' reported that on the night of 21 March, hundreds of Kurdish and Arab SDF fighters and an undisclosed number of U.S. Special Operations troops as their advisers launched a large-scale heliborne assault on IS around the area of the [[Tabqa Dam]] with the eventual goal of taking the dam. They were inserted on the southern bank of the Euphrates river behind IS's defenses to take them by surprise, Col Joe Scrocca, the spokesman for the U.S.-led campaign in Iraq and Syria said that as a result they did not come under fire. The following day, there was heavy fighting in the area; Scrocca added that the ground forces were supported by helicopter gunships, US Marine 155mm artillery and U.S. airstrikes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2017/03/22/u-s-troops-syrian-fighters-insert-behind-isis-lines-to-retake-key-dam-in-syria/|title=U.S. troops, Syrian fighters insert behind ISIS lines to retake key dam in Syria|publisher=Washington Post|date=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the groups targeted by U.S. airstrikes was the [[Khorasan (Islamist group)|Khorasan Group]], an [[Islamic extremism|extremist]] group of suspected al-Qaeda "core" members who were alleged to have been plotting an attack against the U.S. and other Western nations.&lt;ref name=voasyriaairstrikes/&gt; The strikes targeted Khorasan training camps, explosives and munitions production facilities, communications facilities, as well as command and control facilities. The group has been claimed to possess advanced bomb making skills and their plot is claimed to involve a bomb made of a nonmetallic device such as a toothpaste container or clothes dipped in explosive material.&lt;ref name="khorasanairstrikes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/22/world/meast/al-qaeda-syria-khorasan/|title=Source: Al Qaeda group in Syria plotted attack against U.S. with explosive clothes|publisher=CNN|date=23 September 2014|accessdate=23 September 2014|last = Levis|first = Josh|last2 = Cruickshank|first2 = Paul|last3 = Lister|first3 = Time}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group is reportedly led by [[Muhsin al-Fadhli]], a leader of [[al-Qaeda]] and &lt;span&gt;a close confidant of &lt;/span&gt;[[Osama bin Laden]].&lt;ref name=khorasanairstrikes/&gt; Intelligence officials expressed concern that the group may include militants who were taught by [[Ibrahim al-Asiri]], the chief bomb maker for [[al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula]], who is known for his sophisticated bomb making techniques that nearly downed two Western airliners.&lt;ref name=khorasanairstrikes/&gt;

On 21 May 2015, the United States admitted it "probably" killed two children in bombings near [[Harem, Syria|Harem]] on 4 and 5 November 2014.

===Results===
According to CJTF-OIR, by May 2016, ISIL has lost 25% of the territory it possessed in Syria since the campaign began, mostly due to advances by YPG/SDF forces with heavy Coalition air support.&lt;ref&gt;Jim Michaels, [https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/05/17/exclusive-isil-loses-45-territory-iraq-20-syria/84499682/ "ISIL loses 45% of territory in Iraq, 20% in Syria "], USA Today, 19 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Overall the American-led air campaign against ISIL is estimated by the Pentagon to have struck 32,000 targets (including 164 tanks, 400 Humvees, and 2,638 pieces of oil infrastructure) and killed 50,000 militants, with approximately 1/3 of these losses taking place in Syria.&lt;ref name="Airstrikes in Iraq and Syria that were funded by India" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Starr.

Prior to 20 October, the United States and its coalition partners fighting against ISIL in Syria, had not provided any supplies to Kurdish forces in their fight against ISIL.&lt;ref name=CNNairdrop/&gt; Much of the reason for US having to airdrop supplies was due to the Turkish government's refusal to allow supplies to pass through their border into Kobanî.

In March 2017, the [[Donald Trump Administration]] deployed an additional 400 [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] in Syria to expand the fight against ISIS in the [[Northern Raqqa offensive (November 2016)|Raqqa offensive]] where they could provide artillery support for U.S.-backed local forces that were preparing an assault on Raqqa to liberate the city from IS militants. The deployment marked a new escalation in the U.S. war in Syria, and put more conventional U.S. troops in the battle that, until then, had primarily used Special Operations units. The 400 Marines were part of the [[11th Marine Expeditionary Unit|11th MEU]] from the Battalion Landing Team [[1st Battalion, 4th Marines]]. They manned an artillery battery of M-777 Howitzers whilst additional infantrymen from the unit provided security and resupplies were handled by part of the expeditionary force's combat logistics element.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.salon.com/2017/03/09/more-troops-in-syria-trump-orders/|title=More troops in Syria: Trump orders boots on the ground to battle ISIS|work=Salon|date=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Raqqa campaign (2016–2017)|Raqqa campaign]] alone, this small artillery battalion fired over 40,000 shells (including 34,033 155mm), more than were used in the entire [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] and only 20,000 fewer than all those fired by the U.S. military in [[Operation Desert Storm]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marinecorpstimes.com/news/your-marine-corps/2018/02/06/these-marines-in-syria-fired-more-artillery-than-any-battalion-since-vietnam/ These Marines in Syria fired more artillery than any battalion since Vietnam.] Marines Corps Times.

Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov referred to the Sharyat attack as "an act of aggression under a completely invented pretext".

''''' BH Dani''''' stands for '''''Bosanskohercegovački Dani''''' ({{IPA-sh|bosanskoxěrt͡segoʋat͡ʃkiː dâːni|bs}}; [[English language|English]] translation: Bosnian-Herzegovinian Days) is a [[Bosnian language]] weekly magazine published in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].

==Editorial==
''BH Dani'' focuses on exposing corruption in the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. Another favourite subject is Rijaset, the governing body of [[Bosnian Muslims]] and its [[Grand Mufti]] [[Mustafa Cerić]]. The magazine ardently criticizes what they perceive as the rampant corruption and nepotism in the Islamic community of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and often gives the platform to those who oppose Mufti Cerić and his appointees. Due to its frequent criticism of Bosnian Muslim sympathy towards Arab volunteers who came to join the Bosnian Army following massacres on Bosnian Muslims by Serb and, to a lesser extent, Croat forces in the 1992-1995 [[Bosnian War]], it is seen by some as an [[Islamophobia|anti-Muslim]] publication.

{{Campaignbox Second Persian invasion of Greece}}

The '''Battle of Artemisium''', or '''Battle of Artemision''', was a series of naval engagements over three days during the [[second Persian invasion of Greece]]. The battle took place simultaneously with the more famous land battle at [[Battle of Thermopylae|Thermopylae]], in August or September 480 BC, off the coast of [[Euboea]] and was fought between an alliance of [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[city-state]]s, including [[Sparta]], [[History of Athens|Athens]], [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]] and others, and the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] of [[Xerxes I]].

The Persian invasion was a delayed response to the defeat of the [[first Persian invasion of Greece]], which had been ended by the Athenian victory at the [[Battle of Marathon]]. King [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]] had amassed a huge army and navy, and set out to conquer all of [[Greece]]. The Athenian general [[Themistocles]] proposed that the Allied Greeks block the advance of the Persian army at the pass of [[Thermopylae]] and simultaneously block the Persian navy at the Straits of [[Artemisium]]. An Allied naval force of 271 [[trireme]]s was thus dispatched to await the arrival of the Persians.

Approaching Artemisium towards the end of summer, the Persian navy was caught in a gale off the coast of [[Magnesia Prefecture|Magnesia]] and lost around a third of their 1200 ships. After arriving at Artemisium, the Persians sent a detachment of 200 ships around the coast of Euboea in an attempt to trap the Greeks, but these were caught in another storm and shipwrecked. The main action of the battle took place after two days of smaller engagements. The two sides fought all day, with roughly equal losses; however, the smaller Allied fleet could not afford the losses.

After the engagement, the Allies received news of the defeat of the Allied army at Thermopylae. Since their strategy required both Thermopylae and Artemisium to be held, and given their losses, the Allies decided to withdraw to [[Salamis Island|Salamis]]. The Persians overran and gained control over [[Phocis]], then [[Boeotia]], and finally entered [[Attica]] where they captured the now-evacuated Athens. However, seeking a decisive victory over the Allied fleet, the Persians were later defeated at the [[Battle of Salamis]] in late 480 BC. Fearing being trapped in Europe, Xerxes withdrew with much of his army to Asia, leaving [[Mardonius (general)|Mardonius]] to complete the conquest of Greece. The following year, however, saw an Allied army decisively defeat the Persians at the [[Battle of Plataea]], thereby ending the Persian invasion.

== Sources ==
{{Main|Herodotus}}

The main source for the Greco-Persian Wars is the Greek historian [[Herodotus]]. Herodotus, who has been called the 'Father of History',&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, On the Laws I, 5&lt;/ref&gt; was born in 484 BC in [[Halicarnassus]], Asia Minor (then under Persian overlordship). He wrote his 'Enquiries' (Greek—''Historia''; English—''[[Histories (Herodotus)|(The) Histories]]'') around 440–420 BC, trying to trace the origins of the Greco-Persian Wars, which would still have been relatively recent history (the wars finally ending in 450 BC).&lt;ref name = hxvi/&gt; Herodotus's approach was entirely novel, and at least in Western society, he does seem to have invented 'history' as we know it.&lt;ref name = hxvi/&gt; As Holland has it: "For the first time, a chronicler set himself to trace the origins of a conflict not to a past so remote so as to be utterly fabulous, nor to the whims and wishes of some god, nor to a people's claim to manifest destiny, but rather explanations he could verify personally."&lt;ref name = hxvi&gt;Holland, pp. ''xvi''–''xvii''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some subsequent ancient historians, despite following in his footsteps, criticised Herodotus, starting with [[Thucydides]].&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War, e.g. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Thuc.+1.22 I, 22]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Fin15&gt;Finley, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Thucydides chose to begin his history where Herodotus left off (at the [[Siege of Sestos]]), and therefore evidently felt that Herodotus's history was accurate enough not to need re-writing or correcting.&lt;ref name = Fin15/&gt; [[Plutarch]] criticised Herodotus in his essay "On The Malignity of Herodotus", describing Herodotus as "''Philobarbaros''" (barbarian-lover), for not being pro-Greek enough, which suggests that Herodotus might actually have done a reasonable job of being even-handed.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, p. ''xxiv''.&lt;/ref&gt; A negative view of Herodotus was passed on to Renaissance Europe, though he remained well read.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.loyno.edu/history/journal/1998-9/Pipes.htm|title=Herodotus: Father of History, Father of Lies|accessdate=2008-01-18|author=David Pipes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080127105636/http://www.loyno.edu/history/journal/1998-9/Pipes.htm |archivedate = January 27, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the 19th century, archaeological finds that support his version of events have considerably rehabilitated his reputation.&lt;ref name = h377&gt;Holland, p. 377.&lt;/ref&gt; The prevailing modern view is that Herodotus generally did a remarkable job in his ''Historia'', but that some of his specific details (particularly troop numbers and dates) should be viewed with skepticism.&lt;ref name = h377/&gt; Nevertheless, there are still some historians who believe Herodotus made up much of his story.&lt;ref&gt;Fehling, pp. 1–277.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sicilian historian [[Diodorus Siculus]], writing in the 1st century BC in his ''[[Bibliotheca historica|Bibliotheca Historica]]'', also provides an account of the Greco-Persian wars, partially derived from the earlier Greek historian [[Ephorus]]. This account is fairly consistent with Herodotus's.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Diod.+11.28 XI, 28–34],&lt;/ref&gt; The Greco-Persian wars are also described in less detail by a number of other ancient historians including Plutarch, [[Ctesias of Cnidus]], and are referred to by other authors, such as the playwright [[Aeschylus]]. Archaeological evidence, such as the [[Serpent Column]], also supports some of Herodotus's specific claims.&lt;ref&gt;Note to Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+9.81 IX, 81]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
{{Main|Greco-Persian Wars|Second Persian invasion of Greece}}

The Greek city-states of [[Athens]] and [[Eretria]] had supported the unsuccessful [[Ionian Revolt]] against the Persian Empire of [[Darius I]] in 499-494 BC. The Persian Empire was still relatively young, and prone to revolts amongst its subject peoples.&lt;ref name = h47&gt;Holland, p47–55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="h203"/&gt; Moreover, Darius was an usurper, and had spent considerable time extinguishing revolts against his rule.&lt;ref name = h47/&gt; The Ionian revolt threatened the integrity of his empire, and Darius thus vowed to punish those involved (especially those not already part of the empire).&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+5.105 V, 105]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = h171/&gt; Darius also saw the opportunity to expand his empire into the fractious world of Ancient Greece.&lt;ref name = h171&gt;Holland, 171–178&lt;/ref&gt; A preliminary expedition under [[Mardonius (general)|Mardonius]] in 492 BC, to secure the land approaches to Greece, re-conquered [[Thrace]], and forced [[Macedon]] to become a fully subordinate client kingdom part of Persia.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+6.44.1 VI, 44]&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2011|pp=135-138}}{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2011|pp=342-345}} It had been made a vassal or ally as early as the late 6th century BC, but remained having autonomy.{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2011|pp=342-345}} Mardonius' campaign of 492 BC changed this.{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2011|pp=342-345}}

In 491 BC, Darius sent emissaries to all the Greek city-states, asking for a gift of '[[earth and water]]' in token of their submission to him.&lt;ref name = h178&gt;Holland, pp178–179&lt;/ref&gt; Having had a demonstration of his power the previous year, the majority of Greek cities duly obliged. In Athens, however, the ambassadors were put on trial and then executed by throwing them in a pit; in Sparta, they were simply thrown down a well.&lt;ref name = h178/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.133.1 VII, 133]&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that [[Sparta]] was also effectively at war with Persia.&lt;ref name = h178/&gt;

Darius thus put together an amphibious task force under [[Datis]] and [[Artaphernes (son of Artaphernes)|Artaphernes]] in 490 BC, which [[Siege of Naxos (490 BC)|attacked Naxos]], before receiving the submission of the other [[Cyclades|Cycladic Islands]]. The task force then moved on Eretria, which it besieged and destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+6.100.1 VI, 101]&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, it moved to attack Athens, landing at the bay of [[Marathon, Greece|Marathon]], where it was met by a heavily outnumbered Athenian army. At the ensuing [[Battle of Marathon]], the Athenians won a remarkable victory, which resulted in the withdrawal of the Persian army to Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+6.113 VI, 113]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Map Greco-Persian Wars-en.svg|thumb|left|300px|A map showing the Greek world at the time of the battle]]

Darius therefore began raising a huge new army with which he meant to completely subjugate Greece; however, in 486 BC, his [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] subjects revolted, indefinitely postponing any Greek expedition.&lt;ref name = h203&gt;Holland, p203&lt;/ref&gt; Darius then died whilst preparing to march on Egypt, and the throne of Persia passed to his son Xerxes I.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, pp206–206&lt;/ref&gt; Xerxes crushed the Egyptian revolt, and very quickly restarted the preparations for the invasion of Greece.&lt;ref name = h208&gt;Holland, pp208–211&lt;/ref&gt; Since this was to be a full-scale invasion, it required long-term planning, stock-piling and conscription.&lt;ref name = h208/&gt; Xerxes decided that the [[Hellespont]] would be bridged to allow his army to cross to Europe, and that a canal should be dug across the isthmus of [[Mount Athos]] (rounding which headland, a Persian fleet had been destroyed in 492 BC).&lt;ref name = h213/&gt; These were both feats of exceptional ambition, which would have been beyond any contemporary state.&lt;ref name = h213&gt;Holland, pp213–214&lt;/ref&gt; By early 480 BC, the preparations were complete, and the army Xerxes had mustered at [[Sardis]] marched towards Europe, crossing the Hellespont on two [[pontoon bridge]]s.&lt;ref name=VII35&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.35.1 VII, 35]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Athenians had also been preparing for war with the Persians since the mid-480s BC, and in 482 BC the decision was taken, under the guidance of the Athenian politician [[Themistocles]], to build a massive fleet of [[trireme]]s that would be necessary for the Greeks to fight the Persians.&lt;ref name = h217&gt;Holland, p217–223&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Athenians did not have the manpower to fight on land and sea; and therefore combating the Persians would require an alliance of Greek city states. In 481 BC, Xerxes sent ambassadors around Greece asking for earth and water, but making the very deliberate omission of Athens and Sparta.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.32.1 VII, 32]&lt;/ref&gt; Support thus began to coalesce around these two leading states. A congress of city states met at [[Corinth]] in late autumn of 481 BC,&lt;ref name=VII145&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.145.1 VII, 145]&lt;/ref&gt; and a confederate alliance of [[History of Greece|Greek city-states]] was formed. It had the power to send envoys asking for assistance and to dispatch troops from the member states to defensive points after joint consultation. This was remarkable for the disjointed Greek world, especially since many of the city-states in attendance were still technically at war with each other.&lt;ref name = h226&gt;Holland, p226&lt;/ref&gt;

The 'congress' met again in the spring of 480 BC. A [[Thessaly|Thessalian]] delegation suggested that the allies could muster in the narrow [[Vale of Tempe]], on the borders of Thessaly, and thereby block Xerxes's advance.&lt;ref name = h248&gt;Holland, pp248–249&lt;/ref&gt; A force of 10,000  [[hoplite]]s was dispatched to the [[Vale of Tempe]], through which they believed the Persian army would have to pass. However, once there, they were warned by [[Alexander I of Macedon]] that the vale could be bypassed through the [[Sarantaporos_(Thessaly)|Sarantoporo Pass]], and that the army of Xerxes was overwhelming, the Greeks retreated.&lt;ref name=VII173&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.173.1 VII, 173]&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards, they received the news that Xerxes had crossed the Hellespont.&lt;ref name = h248/&gt;

Themistocles therefore suggested a second strategy to the allies. The route to southern Greece ([[Boeotia]], [[Attica]] and the [[Peloponnesus]]) would require the army of Xerxes to travel through the very narrow pass of [[Thermopylae]]. The pass could easily be blocked by the Greek hoplites, despite the overwhelming numbers of Persians. Furthermore, to prevent the Persians bypassing Thermopylae by sea, the Athenian and allied navies could block the straits of Artemisium. This dual strategy was adopted by the congress.&lt;ref name = h255&gt;Holland, pp255–257&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Peloponnesian cities made fall-back plans to defend the [[Isthmus of Corinth]] should all else fail, whilst the women and children of Athens were evacuated ''en masse'' to the Peloponnesian city of [[Troezen]].&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+8.40 VIII, 40]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prelude ==
The Allied fleet sailed north to Cape Artemisium once it became known that the Persian army was advancing along the coast past [[Mount Olympus]], probably around late July or the beginning of August.&lt;ref name = h257&gt;Holland, p257–258&lt;/ref&gt; The Allies took up station at Artemisium, most likely beaching their ships at the headland, from which they could quickly launch them as needed.&lt;ref name = h264&gt;Holland, p264–269&lt;/ref&gt; The Allies sent three ships to [[Skiathos]] as scouts to provide warning of the approach of the Persian fleet but &lt;ref name = VII179&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.179 VII, 179]&lt;/ref&gt; two weeks passed without sight. Finally, ten [[Sidon]]ian triremes arrived off Skiathos, and the main Allied fleet was informed by a fire-beacon lit on the island.&lt;ref name = VII179/&gt;&lt;ref name = VII183&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.183 VII, 183]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Allied patrol ships themselves were caught unaware and two were captured, whilst one ran aground.&lt;ref name = h264/&gt; According to Herodotus, in the ensuing confusion, unsure whether or not the beacon heralded the arrival of the whole Persian fleet, as a precaution the whole Allied fleet launched into the straits of Artemisium.&lt;ref name = h264/&gt;&lt;ref name = VII183/&gt; Once it became clear that the Persian fleet was not going to arrive that day, they decided to sail to [[Chalcis]], halfway down on the western coast of Euboea, leaving men on the heights of [[Euboea]] to warn of the actual arrival of the Persian ships.&lt;ref name = VII183/&gt;

Historians suggest that the Allies may have misinterpreted the Persian movements and come to the mistaken conclusion that the Persians were sailing east around Skiathos, aiming to sail around the eastern side of Euboea.&lt;ref name = L123&gt;Lazenby, pp123–125&lt;/ref&gt; The signals sent by fire beacons must have been very simplistic, and potentially interpreted wrongly; alternatively, the signallers may have genuinely believed that the Persian fleet was sailing to the east of Skiathos.&lt;ref name = L123/&gt; If the Persians sailed around the outer, eastern side of Euboea, they could head straight to Attica, and thereby cut off the Allied fleet's line of retreat.&lt;ref name = L123/&gt; Furthermore, the Persians had enough ships to attempt to both attack the Straits of Artemisium, and sail around Euboea.&lt;ref name = h264/&gt; The withdrawal to Chalcis therefore gave the Allies the opportunity to escape from the Straits of Euboea if the Persians did travel around the outside of Euboea, but also allowed them to return to Artemisium if necessary. In this context, the watchers left on Euboea could inform the Allies if the Persian fleet did indeed sail east of Euboea.&lt;ref name = L123/&gt; The Allied fleet thus continued to wait at Chalcis.&lt;ref name = h264/&gt; Nevertheless, the Allies, undoubtedly anxious about facing a Persian fleet that so greatly outnumbered them, may have somewhat overreacted.&lt;ref name = h264/&gt;

[[File:Thermopylae &amp; Artemisium campaign map.png|thumb|300px|right|Map showing Greek &amp; Persian advances to Thermopylae and Artemisium]]

Around ten days later, the Persian army arrived at Thermopylae, and the Allies at Chalcis were informed by a ship, captained by Abronichus, which had been appointed to liaise between the army and the fleet.&lt;ref name = h264/&gt; However, there was still no sign of the Persian fleet, and the first day the Persians spent at Thermopylae passed without them launching an attack.&lt;ref name = h271&gt;Holland, pp271–273&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, the Persian fleet finally drew near to Artemisium, heading for the Gap of Skiathos (between the coast of [[Magnesia Prefecture|Magnesia]] and [[Skiathos]]), when a summer gale (a 'Hellesponter' - probably a north-easterly storm&lt;ref name = L128/&gt;) broke, driving the Persian fleet onto the mountainous coast.&lt;ref name = h271/&gt;&lt;ref name=VII188&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.188 VII, 188]&lt;/ref&gt; The storm lasted two days, wrecking approximately one third of the Persian ships.&lt;ref name = h271/&gt;&lt;ref name = h276&gt;Holland, pp276–281&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, at Thermopylae, the Persians had continued to wait for the Greeks to disperse, also choosing not to attack during the storm.&lt;ref name = h271/&gt;

The day after the storm finished, the Allied fleet returned to Artemisium to protect the flank of the army at Thermopylae.&lt;ref name = h271/&gt; The following day, (the fifth since the Persians had arrived at Thermopylae) the Persian army began their attacks on the Allied army at Thermopylae. The same day, the Persian fleet finally appeared through the Gap of Sciathos, and began mooring on the coast opposite Artemisium, at Aphetae.&lt;ref name = h276/&gt; According to Herodotus, 15 Persian ships blundered into the Allied lines, and were captured.&lt;ref name = VII194&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.194 VII, 194]&lt;/ref&gt; Although clearly storm damaged, the Persian fleet still probably outnumbered the Allies by nearly 3:1.&lt;ref name = h276/&gt; As a result, the Allies contemplated withdrawing completely.&lt;ref name = VIII4&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+8.4 VIII, 4]&lt;/ref&gt; The Euboeans, not wanting to be abandoned to the Persians, bribed Themistocles to try to ensure that the Allied fleet remained.&lt;ref name = VIII4/&gt; Since the joint operation at Thermopylae and Artemisium was his strategy in the first place, it is likely this is exactly what Themistocles wanted, and this bribe allowed him in turn to bribe the Spartan and Corinthian admirals, [[Eurybiades]] and [[Adeimantus of Corinth|Adeimantus]] to remain at Artemisium.&lt;ref name = h276/&gt;

Later on that day, a deserter from the Persian fleet, a Greek called Scyllias, swam into the Allied camp. He brought bad news for the Allies — whilst most of the Persian fleet was undergoing repairs, the Persians had detached 200 seaworthy ships to sail around the outer coast of Euboea, to block the escape route of the Allied fleet.&lt;ref name = h276/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+8.7 VIII, 7]&lt;/ref&gt; The Persians did not want to attack the Allies yet, because they thought the Allies would simply flee, and so they sought to trap them.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+8.6 VIII, 6]&lt;/ref&gt; The Allies resolved to go and meet this detachment, to prevent being trapped, though they planned to leave by nightfall to prevent the Persians becoming aware of their plans.&lt;ref name = VIII9&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+8.9 VIII, 9]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Allies most likely realised that this situation presented them with an opportunity to destroy an isolated part of the Persian fleet.&lt;ref name = L128/&gt;&lt;ref name = h276/&gt; Herodotus is not clear on where the Allies planned to meet this detachment, only that they resolved to do so. One possibility is that they planned to sail down the Straits of Euboea, and hope that the other Allied ships, patrolling the coast of Attica,&lt;sup&gt;[[#Notes|[Note 1]]]&lt;/sup&gt; followed the Persians as they entered the Straits of Euboea from the south; then the Persians might themselves be caught in a trap.&lt;ref name = h276/&gt; Alternatively, the Allies may have planned to ambush the detachment as it passed by Artemisium, on its journey from Aphetae.&lt;ref name = L128/&gt; Either way, they decided to make a demonstration towards the Persian lines during what remained of the day, to convince the Persians that they were planning to stay at Artemisium.&lt;ref name = L128&gt;Lazenby, pp128–130&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = h276/&gt; Herodotus also suggests that this was an opportunity for them to assess Persian seamanship and tactics.&lt;ref name = VIII9/&gt; The Allies probably waited until late afternoon so that there was little chance of being drawn into a full scale engagement; they did not want to suffer casualties before sailing to meet to the Persian detachment.&lt;ref name = L128/&gt; These decisions finally led to the beginning of the battle.&lt;ref name = h276/&gt;

=== Chronology ===
The exact chronology of the battles of Thermopylae and Artemisium, and their relation to each other is somewhat unclear. The chronology below represents an estimated reconstruction of the time-line, following Lazenby and Holland.&lt;ref name = L118&gt;Lazenby, pp118–121&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holland, p396&lt;/ref&gt;

== Opposing forces ==

=== Persian fleet ===
Herodotus gives a detailed description of the Persian fleet that assembled at Doriskos in spring 480 BC (see table).&lt;ref name = VII89/&gt; However, after the fleet was struck the storm off the coast of Magnesia, approximately one third of the fleet was lost.&lt;ref name=VII188/&gt; Thus, by Herodotus's reckoning, the Persian fleet would have had approximately 800 triremes at Artemisium.&lt;ref name = h276/&gt;

Some modern scholars have accepted these numbers, especially since the ancient sources are unusually consistent on this point.&lt;ref&gt;Köster (1934)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holland, p320&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = L93&gt;Lazenby, pp93–94&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors reject this number, with 1,207 being seen as more of a reference to the combined Greek fleet in the [[Iliad]], and generally claim that the Persians could have launched no more than around 600 warships into the Aegean.&lt;ref name = L93/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Green, p61&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burn, p331&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Greek fleet ===
Herodotus claims there were 280 ships in the Greek fleet at the Battle of Artemisium, made up of the following contingents (numbers in parentheses refer to [[Penteconter (ship)|Penteconters]], other ships are all Triremes):

The Athenians had been building up a large fleet since 483 BC, ostensibly for their ongoing conflict with Aegina.&lt;ref name = h221/&gt;&lt;ref name = L83/&gt;  However, it is probable that this build up, initiated by Themistocles, was also made with a future conflict with the Persians in mind.&lt;ref name = h221&gt;Holland, p221&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = L83&gt;Lazenby, p83&lt;/ref&gt; The Athenians initially requested command of the Allied fleet, but let [[Eurybiades]] of Sparta command it to preserve unity.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, p258&lt;/ref&gt;

== Strategic and tactical considerations ==
Strategically, the Allied mission was simple. The fleet needed to protect the flank of the army at Thermopylae, whilst not being cut off themselves.&lt;ref name = L128/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holland, p255&lt;/ref&gt; For the Persians, the strategic situation was equally simple, although with more options. They needed to force their way through either one of Thermopylae or Artemisium (since holding both was necessary for the Allied effort), or to outflank either position.&lt;ref name = L128/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lazenby, pp137–138&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = L125&gt;Lazenby, p125&lt;/ref&gt; Outflanking the Straits of Artemisium was theoretically much easier than outflanking Thermopylae, by sailing around the east coast of Euboea.&lt;ref name = L125/&gt; The Greek position at Artemisium may have been chosen in order to watch for such attempts. If narrowness of the channel had been the only determinant, the Allies could have found a better position near the city of [[Oreus|Histiaea]].&lt;ref name = L125/&gt;

The Persians were at a significant tactical advantage, outnumbering the Allies and having "better sailing" ships.&lt;ref name = L138/&gt; The "better sailing" that Herodotus mentions was probably due to the superior seamanship of the crews;&lt;ref name = L138/&gt; most of the Athenian ships (and therefore the majority of the fleet) were newly built, and had inexperienced crews.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, pp222–224&lt;/ref&gt; The most common naval tactics in the Mediterranean area at the time were ramming (triremes were equipped with a ram at the bows), or boarding by ship-borne marines (which essentially turned a sea battle into a land one).&lt;ref name = L34&gt;Lazenby, pp34–37&lt;/ref&gt; The Persians and Asiatic Greeks had by this time begun to use a manoeuver known as ''diekplous''. It is not entirely clear what this was, but it probably involved sailing into gaps between enemy ships and then ramming them in the side.&lt;ref name = L34/&gt; This maneuver would have required skilled sailing, and therefore the Persians would have been more likely to employ it.  The Allies, however, developed tactics specifically to counter this.&lt;ref name = L34/&gt;

Herodotus suggests that the Allied ships were heavier and, by implication, less maneuverable.&lt;ref name = VIII60&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+8.60 VIII, 60]&lt;/ref&gt; Their weight would further reduce the likelihood of the Allied ships employing the ''diekplous''.&lt;ref name = L34/&gt; The source of this heaviness is uncertain; possibly the Allied ships were bulkier in construction.&lt;ref name = L34/&gt; Another suggestion is that the heaviness was caused by the weight of fully armoured hoplite marines.&lt;ref name = L34/&gt; The Allies may have had extra marines on board if their ships were less maneuverable, since boarding would then be the main tactic available to them (at the cost of making the ships even heavier).&lt;ref name = L34/&gt; Indeed, Herodotus refers to the Greeks capturing ships, rather than sinking them.&lt;ref name = VIII11/&gt;

== Battle ==

=== First day ===
[[Image:Trireme.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Sketch reconstruction of a Greek [[Trireme]]]]

When the Persians saw the Allied fleet rowing towards them, they decided to seize the opportunity to attack, even though it was late in the day, as they thought they would win an easy victory.&lt;ref name = VIII10&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+8.10 VIII, 10]&lt;/ref&gt; They quickly advanced on the much smaller Allied fleet.&lt;ref name = VIII10/&gt; However, the Allies had come up with a tactic for this situation, where they turned their ''"bows on to the barbarians, [and] they drew their sterns together in the middle"''.&lt;ref name = VIII11&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+8.11 VIII, 11]&lt;/ref&gt; This is usually taken to mean that they formed into a circle, with their rams pointing outwards;&lt;ref name = h276/&gt;&lt;ref name = L138&gt;Lazenby, pp138–140&lt;/ref&gt; Thucydides reports that in the [[Peloponnesian War]], Peloponnesian fleets twice adopted a circular formation, with their sterns together.&lt;ref name = L138/&gt; However, Herodotus does not actually use the word circle, and Lazenby points out the difficulty of forming a circle of 250 ships (the Peloponnesian fleets had 30–40 ships).&lt;ref name = L138/&gt; It is thus possible the Allies formed into more of a crescent formation, with the wings drawn back to prevent the Persian ships sailing around the Allied line.&lt;ref name = L138/&gt; Whatever the case, it seems likely that this maneuver was intended to negate the superior Persian seamanship, and perhaps specifically the use of ''diekplous''.&lt;ref name = L138/&gt;&lt;ref name = VIII11/&gt;

Having assumed this formation upon the giving of a prearranged signal, the Allied ships moved suddenly outwards from this position at a second signal, rowing into the Persian ships and catching them off guard.&lt;ref name = h276/&gt; Their superior seamanship negated, the Persians came off worst from the encounter with 30 of their ships captured or sunk.&lt;ref name = VIII11/&gt; During the battle a Greek ship, captained by [[Antidorus of Lemnos]], defected to the Allies.&lt;ref name = VIII11/&gt; Nightfall then ended the battle, with the Allies having fared better than they possibly expected to.&lt;ref name = h276/&gt;

During the night, another storm broke (this time probably a thunder-storm, possibly with a south easterly wind),&lt;ref name = L128/&gt; preventing the Allies from setting off southwards to counter the Persian detachment sent around the outside of Euboea.&lt;ref name = h276/&gt; However, the storm also hit the Persian detachment of ships, driving them off course and onto the rocky coast of 'the Hollows' of Euboea.&lt;ref name = VIII13&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+8.13 VIII, 13]&lt;/ref&gt; This part of the Persian fleet was thus also shipwrecked, losing most of the ships.&lt;ref name = VIII14&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+8.14 VIII, 14]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second day ===
The following day, which was also the second day of Battle of Thermopylae, the Persian fleet, now recovering from the two storms, declined to attack the Allies, and instead attempted to make the fleet seaworthy again.&lt;ref name = h276/&gt;&lt;ref name = VIII14/&gt; News of the shipwreck off Euboea reached the Allies that day, as well as a reinforcement of 53 ships from Athens.&lt;ref name = VIII14/&gt;

Again waiting until late afternoon, the Allies took the opportunity to attack a patrol of Cilician ships, destroying them, before retreating as night fell.&lt;ref name = VIII14/&gt; These ships were possibly survivors of the wrecked detachment sent around Euboea, or were perhaps anchored in an isolated harbour.&lt;ref name = L138/&gt;

=== Third day ===
On the third day of the battle the Persian fleet was ready to attack the Allied lines in full force.&lt;ref name = VIII15&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+8.15 VIII, 15]&lt;/ref&gt; Seeing the Persian fleet assemble, the Allies attempted to block the Straits of Artemisium as best they could, and waited for the Persians to attack.&lt;ref name = h276/&gt; The Persians formed their ships into a semicircle and tried to enclose the Allied fleet, upon which the Allies rowed forward and joined battle.&lt;ref name = VIII16&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+8.16 VIII, 16]&lt;/ref&gt; The battle raged all day long, with the Allies hard put to defend their line.&lt;ref name = h276/&gt; When the fleets finally disengaged at nightfall, both sides had suffered roughly equal losses.&lt;ref name = VIII16/&gt; However, the smaller Allied fleet could scarcely afford such losses;&lt;ref name = h276/&gt; half the Athenian ships (the largest contingent in the fleet) were damaged or lost.&lt;ref name = VIII17&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+8.17 VIII, 17]&lt;/ref&gt;

Returning to Artemisium, the Allies saw that they would probably not be able to hold the line for another day, such were their losses.&lt;ref name = h276/&gt; They thus debated whether they should withdraw from Artemisium, whilst they awaited news from Thermopylae.&lt;ref name = h276/&gt; Themistocles ordered the men to slaughter and barbecue the flocks of the Euboeans, so that they would not fall into Persian hands.&lt;ref name = VIII19&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+8.19 VIII, 19]&lt;/ref&gt; Abronichus arrived on the liaison ship from Thermopylae and told the Allies of the [[Battle of Thermopylae#Third day|destruction of the Allied rearguard]] at Thermopylae.&lt;ref name = VIII21&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+8.21 VIII, 21]&lt;/ref&gt; Since holding the Straits of Artemisium now no longer held any strategic purpose, and given their losses, the Allies decided to evacuate immediately.&lt;ref name = VIII21/&gt;

The Persians were alerted to the withdrawal of the Greeks by a boat from [[Oreus|Histiaea]], but did not at first believe it.&lt;ref name=VIII23&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+8.23 VIII, 23]&lt;/ref&gt; They sent some ships to see if this was the case, and finding that it was, the whole fleet set sail for Artemisium in the morning.&lt;ref name=VIII23/&gt; The Persians then sailed on to Histiaea and sacked the surrounding region.&lt;ref name=VIII23/&gt;

The Allied fleet sailed to [[Salamis Island|Salamis]], off the coast of Attica, to assist with the evacuation of the remaining Athenians. En route, Themistocles left inscriptions addressed to the [[Ionia]]n Greek crews of the Persian fleet on all springs of water that they might stop at, asking them to defect to the Allied cause:&lt;ref name = VIII22&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+8.22 VIII, 22]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Men of Ionia, that what you are doing is not proper, campaigning against your fathers and wishing to enslave Greece. It would be best if you came on our side. But if this is not possible, at least during the battle stand aside and also beg the [[Caria]]ns to do the same with you. But if you can not do either the one or the other, if you are chained by higher force and you can not defect during the operations, when we come at hand, act purposely as cowards remembering that we are of the same blood and that the first cause of animosity with the barbarians came from you."''&lt;ref name = VIII22/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following Thermopylae, the Persian army burned and sacked the Boeotian cities that had not submitted to them—[[Plataea]] and [[Thespiae]]—and then marched on the now evacuated city of Athens.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+8.50 VIII, 50]&lt;/ref&gt;
Meanwhile, the Allies (for the most part Peloponnesian) prepared to defend the Isthmus of [[Corinth]], demolishing the single road that led through it, and building a wall across it.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+8.71 VIII, 71]&lt;/ref&gt; As at Thermopylae, to make this an effective strategy required the Allied navy to stage a simultaneous blockade, barring the passage of the Persian navy across the [[Saronic Gulf]], so that troops could not be landed directly on the Peloponnese.&lt;ref name = "h299"&gt;Holland, pp299–303&lt;/ref&gt; However, instead of a mere blockade, Themistocles persuaded the Allies to seek a decisive victory against the Persian fleet. Luring the Persian navy into the Straits of Salamis in September, the Allied fleet was able to destroy much of the Persian fleet, which essentially ended the threat to the Peloponnese.&lt;ref name = "h327"&gt;Holland, pp327–334&lt;/ref&gt;

Fearing that the Greeks might attack the bridges across the Hellespont and trap his army in Europe, Xerxes retreated with much of the army back to Asia.&lt;ref name = VIII97&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+8.97 VIII, 97]&lt;/ref&gt; He left a hand picked force under [[Mardonius (general)|Mardonius]] to complete the conquest the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, p327–329&lt;/ref&gt; However, under pressure from the Athenians, the Peloponnesian Allies eventually agreed to try to force Mardonius to battle, and marched on Attica.&lt;ref name = h338/&gt; Mardonius withdrew to Boeotia to lure the Greeks into open terrain and the two sides eventually met near the city of Plataea.&lt;ref name = h338&gt;Holland, pp338–341&lt;/ref&gt; There, at the [[Battle of Plataea]] in August 479 BC, the Greek army won a decisive victory, destroying much of the Persian army, and ending the invasion of Greece.&lt;ref name = h338/&gt; Meanwhile, at the near-simultaneous naval [[Battle of Mycale]] the Greeks destroyed much of the remaining Persian fleet, thereby reducing the threat of further invasions.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, p357–359&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance ==
Considered by itself, Artemisium was a relatively insignificant battle. The Allies did not defeat the Persian navy, nor prevent it from advancing further along the coast of Greece.&lt;ref name = h276/&gt; Conversely, neither did the Persians destroy the Greek fleet, nor irreparably weaken it.&lt;ref name = h294&gt;Holland, p294–295&lt;/ref&gt; The battle was thus an indecisive one, which pleased neither side.&lt;ref name = h276/&gt;&lt;ref name = h294/&gt;

Nevertheless, in the wider context of the Greco-Persian wars, it was a very significant battle for the Allies. The Allies had demonstrated to themselves that they could stand up to the Persian navy, even having the better of some encounters.&lt;ref name = h276/&gt; For many of the Allied crews, it was their first taste of battle, and the experience gained was invaluable at the forthcoming [[Battle of Salamis]].&lt;ref name = h317&gt;Holland, p317&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, fighting the Persians at Artemisium allowed the Greek admirals to see how the Persian fleet performed, and gave them insights into how it might be beaten.&lt;ref name = h317/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holland, p303&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the events before and during Artemisium were crucial in cutting down the size of the Persian fleet (even if this was not all due to military action), meaning that the odds faced by the Allies at the Battle of Salamis were not overwhelming.&lt;ref name = h276/&gt;&lt;ref name = VIII13/&gt;&lt;ref name = L150&gt;Lazenby, p150&lt;/ref&gt; As the poet [[Pindar]] put it, Artemisium was ''"where the sons of the Athenians laid the shining foundation-stone of freedom"''.&lt;ref name = L150/&gt;

== Notes ==
# Herodotus does not explicitly mention other ships. Since there were at probably 100 more ships at the [[Battle of Salamis]] than at Artemisium, Holland assumes that the remainder were patrolling the coast of Attica.&lt;ref name = h276/&gt;

'''''Ben Franklin in Paris''''' is a [[musical theatre|musical]] with a book and lyrics by [[Sidney Michaels]], and music by Mark Sandrich, Jr. with two songs contributed by [[Jerry Herman]].&lt;ref name="Jerry Herman"&gt;{{Citation |title=Jerry Herman: The Lyrics: A Celebration |last=Herman  |first=Jerry |authorlink= |author2=Kenneth Bloom | chapter=Chapter 11: Miscellaneous |year=2003 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York, New York |isbn=0-415-96768-6 |page= |pages=259–260 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Premise==
The story is a somewhat [[fiction]]alized account of [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s adventures in the [[France|French]] capital. Seeking support for the Colonies' war against [[United Kingdom|England]], he arrives in [[Paris, France|Paris]], where he enlists the aid of an old friend, Madame la Comtesse Diane de Vobrillac, a confidante to [[King Louis XVII]]. Franklin's hopes of winning the king's support seem dashed when [[United Kingdom|British]] forces capture [[Philadelphia]] but rally when the Colonists are victorious at [[Battle of Saratoga|Saratoga]]. At home, his son William, the [[governor]] of [[New Jersey]], sides with the enemy, and the [[traitor]]ous act upsets the elder Franklin's plans. To regain the upper hand, he offers to marry Diane, but she rejects him. Knowing he faces death by hanging, Franklin nevertheless decides to go to England, hoping his act of martyrdom will win him posthumous support. Diane learns of the plan and intercedes with the King, who eventually welcomes Franklin in his new position of the [[Ambassador]] of the [[United States|United States of America]] to [[France]].

==Production==
After 13 previews, the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production, directed and [[choreographed]] by [[Michael Kidd]], opened on October 27, 1964 at the [[Lunt-Fontanne Theatre]], where it closed on May 1, 1965 after 215 performances.&lt;ref name=vault/&gt;

The '''Bitburg controversy''' involved a ceremonial visit by U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] to a German military cemetery in [[Bitburg]], a town in extreme western Germany near the border with [[Luxembourg]], in May 1985, designed to commemorate the end of [[World War II]] in Europe 40 years earlier. The visit aroused considerable criticism, both in the United States and around the world, when it became known that members of the [[Waffen-SS]], the military arm of [[Nazi Germany]]'s [[Schutzstaffel|SS (''Schutzstaffel'')]], were also buried there. The entire SS was judged to be a criminal organisation at the [[Nuremberg trials]]. That Reagan had not been scheduled to visit former Nazi concentration-camp sites compounded the controversy, and a trip to [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]] was later added to his itinerary.

==Controversy==
Reagan was scheduled to attend the [[11th G7 summit|G7 economic summit]] in [[Bonn]] the week of the 40th anniversary of [[V-E Day]]. [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic of Germany)|West German Chancellor]] [[Helmut Kohl]] saw an opportunity to demonstrate the strength of the friendship that existed between (West) Germany and its former foe. During a November 1984 visit to the [[White House]], Kohl appealed to Reagan to join him in symbolizing the reconciliation of their two countries at a German military cemetery. It was suggested that the Kolmeshöhe Cemetery, near Bitburg, was both suitably close and relevant, as 11,000 Americans attached to a nearby airbase lived in harmony with the same number of Germans.

Reagan agreed, and later told an aide he felt he owed Kohl, who despite considerable public and political opposition had stood steadfast with Reagan on the deployment of [[Pershing II]] missiles in West Germany. In February 1985, then White House Deputy Chief of Staff [[Michael Deaver]] made a planning visit to Bitburg. At Kolmeshöhe Cemetery, the 32 rows of headstones were covered with snow. Deaver was usually very skillful in carrying out his role as public relations director for Reagan, but this time he and his team failed to notice that among them were 49 members of the [[Waffen-SS]]. A decision was made by the Reagan team not to include a visit to a [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camp]], as had been previously suggested by Kohl. The President said he didn't want to risk "reawakening the passions of the time" or offend his hosts by visiting a concentration camp. {{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

On April 11, 1985, then White House Press Secretary [[Larry Speakes]] informed the media of the planned visit to Bitburg. When asked who was buried at Kolmeshöhe, Speakes said he thought both American and German soldiers were there. Reporters soon discovered that no American servicemen were in the cemetery (in fact, the remains of all U.S. soldiers had long since been removed from German soil) and that Waffen-SS graves were located close to the proposed ceremony. When questioned, Bitburg Mayor Theo Hallet pointed out, all German military cemeteries were likely to contain at least a few SS graves. Such distinctions, though, failed to placate those who were opposed to Reagan's visit on moral and political grounds. Decorations and memorials on the Waffen-SS graves were removed just prior to Reagan's visit, and replaced right after.&lt;ref name=native&gt;{{cite book|title=20th Century Journey: A Native's Return|publisher=Little Brown|year=1990|author=William L. Shirer}}&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed, page(s) needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

This planned visit caused a great deal of anger outside of Germany. Many prominent government officials, [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] officers, and celebrities, protested the planned visit. [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] survivor and author [[Elie Wiesel]] spoke out on the topic at an unrelated [[White House]] ceremony, saying, "I... implore you to do something else, to find another way, another site. That place, Mr. President, is not your place." 53 senators (including 11 Republicans), signed a letter asking the president to cancel, and 257 representatives (including 84 Republicans) signed a letter urging Chancellor Kohl to withdraw the invitation. Former Army S/Sgt. Jim Hively mailed his World War II decorations, including a Silver Star and a Bronze Star, to Reagan in protest. The [[Ramones]] recorded the song "[[Bonzo Goes to Bitburg|My Brain Is Hanging Upside Down (Bonzo Goes to Bitburg)]]," which alludes to ''[[Bedtime for Bonzo]]'', a movie from Reagan's film career that co-starred a chimpanzee, and [[Frank Zappa]] recorded "[[Civilization Phaze III|Reagan at Bitburg]]". [[Robyn Hitchcock]]'s song "The President" from his album ''[[Element of Light]]'' also makes reference to the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Robins|first=Wayne|title=Robyn Hitchcock: A View From Rock's Underground|newspaper=Newsday|year=1988|accessdate=May 5, 2015|url=http://fucktheusa.info/archive/88/020788.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207111718/http://fucktheusa.info/archive/88/020788.html|archivedate=February 7, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chancellor Kohl responded in an interview with ''[[The New York Times]]'': "I will not give up the idea. If we don't go to Bitburg, if we don't do what we jointly planned, we will deeply offend the feelings of [my] people." A poll revealed that 72% of West Germans thought the visit should go forward as planned. Kohl admitted that rarely had German-American relations been so strained, and in the days leading up to the visit, the White House and the Chancellery were each blaming the other. The White House claimed that the Germans had given assurances that nothing in the Bitburg visit would be an "embarrassment" for the President: "As clumsily as we handled it, Kohl &amp;. Co. have surpassed us in spades." A German official said: "The Americans also have a responsibility toward the president. They must also check on the history that is beneath the ground. It was not very intelligent."{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Reagan defended himself by saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;These [SS troops] were the villains, as we know, that conducted the persecutions and all. But there are 2,000 graves there, and most of those, the average age is about 18. I think that there's nothing wrong with visiting that cemetery where those young men are victims of [[Nazism]] also, even though they were fighting in the German uniform, [[conscription|drafted]] into service to carry out the hateful wishes of the Nazis. They were victims, just as surely as the victims in the [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]]&lt;ref name="buchanan.org"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080511153332/http://www.buchanan.org/pma-99-1105-wallstjl.html Pat Buchanan'S Response To Norman Podhoretz'S Op-Ed – Buchanan Campaign Press Releases – T H E I N T E R N E T B R I G A D E – Official Web Site&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Reagan was criticized for this statement by opponents of the visit. Equating Nazi soldiers with Holocaust victims, responded Rabbi [[Alexander M. Schindler]], president of the [[Union for Reform Judaism|Union of American Hebrew Congregations]], was "a callous offense for the Jewish people." Some critics claimed that Communications Director [[Pat Buchanan]] wrote the statement, which he denies.&lt;ref name="buchanan.org"/&gt; Kohl confirmed an earlier press comment that in the last days of the war he was able to avoid service in the SS because he was only 15, "but they hanged a boy from a tree who was perhaps only two years older with a sign saying "traitor" because he had tried to run away rather than serve."

Kohl made a call to the White House days before Reagan's visit to make sure the President was not wavering in the face of criticism, not to mention pressure from wife, [[Nancy Reagan|Nancy]]. The Chancellor's aide, [[Horst Teltschik]] later said: "Once we knew about the SS dead at Bitburg – knowing that these SS people were seventeen to eighteen years of age, and knowing that some Germans were forced to become members of the SS, having no alternative – the question was, Should this be a reason to cancel?" Reagan aide [[Robert McFarlane]] later said: "Once Reagan learned that Kohl would really be badly damaged by a withdrawal, he said 'We can't do that; I owe him.'" Prior to sending Deaver back to West Germany for the third time, just two days before the scheduled visit, Reagan told his deputy chief of staff: "I know you and Nancy don't want me to go through with this, but I don't want you to change anything when you get over there, because history will prove I'm right. If we can't reconcile after forty years, we are never going to be able to do it."{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

There was one announced change: an added visit to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp.

On Sunday 5 May, Reagan and Kohl appeared at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. The U.S. President's speech there, according to ''Time'', was a "skillful exercise in both the art of eulogy and political damage control." Reagan said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;All these children of God, under bleak and lifeless mounds, the plainness of which does not even hint at the unspeakable acts that created them. Here they lie, never to hope, never to pray, never to live, never to heal, never to laugh, never to cry.... And then, rising above all this cruelty, out of this tragic and nightmarish time, beyond the anguish, the pain and suffering, and for all time, we can and must pledge: never again.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Reagan spent only eight minutes at the Kolmeshöhe Cemetery. Along with Kohl, 90-year-old General [[Matthew Ridgway]], who had commanded the 82nd Airborne in World War II, and ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' ace and former head of NATO, General [[Johannes Steinhoff]], Reagan placed a wreath at a wall of remembrance. After placing the wreath, and standing at attention in honour while a short trumpet salute sounded Steinhoff, in an unscripted act, turned and shook hands with Ridgway. Reagan smiled, and firmly shook General Steinhoff's hand. Kohl later thanked Steinhoff for his actions.

Security was heavy for the three-mile route from the NATO airbase at Kolmeshöhe, lined with 2,000 policemen – one posted every twelve feet: few protesters showed up. When Reagan arrived at the cemetery, [[Michael Moore]] and a Jewish friend of his whose parents were at Auschwitz were there with a banner that read "We came from Michigan, USA to remind you: They killed my family".&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Michael. Here Comes Trouble: Stories From my Life. Grand Central Pub, 2011, p. 335.&lt;/ref&gt; They were shown live on TV networks across the country. Reagan made one last appearance with Kohl at the airbase, before 7,500 spectators waving American and West German flags. Kohl thanked the President for staying the course: "This walk... over the graves of soldiers was not an easy walk. I thank you personally as a friend that you undertook this walk with me." Reagan responded: "This visit has stirred many emotions in the American and German people too. Some old wounds have been reopened, and this I regret very much, because this should be a time of healing."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vlib.us/amdocs/texts/reagan051985.html Ronald Reagan: Remarks at a Joint German-American Military Ceremony at Bitburg Air Base in the Federal Republic of Germany; May 5, 1985&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bristol International Balloon Fiesta''' is held annually in England.  Teams from the UK and other parts of the world bring their [[hot air balloons]] to the site and participate in mass ascents where as many as 100 balloons may launch at a time.

The event was first held in 1979 and is now one of the largest in Europe. It is common to have crowds of over 100,000 on each of the four days of the festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bristol/content/articles/2008/03/20/balloon_fiesta2008_feature.shtml|title=Balloon Fiesta features|publisher=BBC|accessdate=27 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It takes place in a large country estate [[Ashton Court]].  Mass launches are made twice a day, at 6am and 6pm, subject to weather conditions.
[[File:Map ashton court.png|thumb|220px|Location of [[Ashton Court]], where Fiesta takes place]]
One popular attraction is the [[night glow]], when balloons are inflated and glow to music after dark. These are held on the opening Thursday night at approx 9:30pm, followed by a spectacular fireworks display. There is another night glow at the same time followed by the fireworks on the Saturday night. Some people see these as the highlight of the fiesta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bristol/content/articles/2004/08/04/fiesta_nightglowguide_feature.shtml|title=Balloon Fiesta Night Glow punter guide|publisher=BBC|accessdate=27 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The balloon makers [[Cameron Balloons]] are near to the fiesta site, in [[Bedminster, Bristol|Bedminster]], and make many of the special shaped balloons, which have included [[Rupert Bear|Rupert the Bear]], The Scottish Piper, [[Liquorice allsorts#Bertie Bassett|Bertie Bassett]], the [[Tesco]] Trolley, [[Despicable Me (franchise)|Stuart the Minion]], and the [[BBC One 'Balloon' idents|BBC One Balloon]]. Many shapes have also attended the fiesta from abroad, over the years a [[UFO]] and a [[beaver]] have travelled from the USA, a [[Kiwi|kiwi bird]] from New Zealand, and an upside down balloon from the Netherlands.

In the past, the fiesta used to be held in the second week of September, but due to cancellations of flights and the muddy ground because of bad weather, it has been moved in the start of August. This has had a great effect as more flights manage to fly; cancellations are now normally due to high winds.

[[Image:Bristol international Balloon fiesta 403.JPG|thumb|The nightglow is one of the most popular parts of the fiesta.]]
In 2003, the weight of crowds returning from the Balloon Fiesta and [[Ashton Court festival]] put such a great strain on the [[Clifton Suspension Bridge]] that it was decided to close the bridge to all traffic, including pedestrians, during these events from 2004 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Suspension bridge shut for events | work=BBC News | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bristol/4633715.stm | accessdate=2007-03-25 | date=2005-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, the event has diversified to include small scale air displays, attracting the likes of [[The Blades (aerobatic team)|The Blades]], [[Eurofighter Typhoon#Airshow displays|Typhoon display team]] and the [[Red Arrows]].

On 10 August 2013 they broke a balloon fiesta record after 74 balloons landed in one field near the former [[Somerdale Factory]] in [[Keynsham]].

[[File:Flickr - Israel Defense Forces - The Combat Engineering Corps Newest Recruits.jpg|thumb|right|Israeli [[Combat Engineering]] soldier clears a minefield]]

'''Demining''' or '''mine clearance''' is the process of removing [[land mine]]s from an area, while '''minesweeping''' describes the act of detecting mines. There are two distinct types of mine detection and removal: military and humanitarian.

Minesweepers use many tools in order to accomplish their task. Tools have historically included many trained animals, including dogs and rats, but most often in the modern world minesweepers rely on metal detectors or vehicles with a wide variety of mechanical tools attached to them. Other methods have been developed to detect mines, including the use of trained marine mammals, bacteria, acoustics, and other more exotic methods.

== Military mine clearance ==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2013}}
[[File:Defense.gov News Photo 110721-A-DK678-581 - A U.S. Army soldier throws a grappling hook to clear a potential mine field before advancing during a field training exercise at Fort Bragg N.C..jpg|thumb|A US soldier clears a mine using a [[grappling hook]] during training]]
[[File:DeminingRoscheiderHof.webm|thumbtime=248|thumb|Demining after WWII, May 1945 (reenactment)]]
In the combat zone, the process is referred to as '''mine clearance'''. According to the doctrine of the U.S. and other armies, mine clearance is carried out by [[combat engineering|combat engineers]].

The military priority is to breach the minefield quickly in order to create a safe path for troops or ships. Speed is vital, both for tactical reasons and because units attempting to breach the minefield may be under enemy fire. Both anti-personnel mines and anti-tank mines must be removed, although only in the lanes through which troops or vehicles are planned to advance.

The risk to [[sapper]]s is far greater because they may be called upon to perform clearance as tactics dictate, including operating under any weather conditions and on schedule; they can also be under enemy fire. Commanders may accept casualties in the process. Furthermore, it is accepted that mine clearance will be imperfect due to speed and there may be casualties from undiscovered mines. One advantage is that, in military operations, sappers are generally dealing with recently laid mines that respond predictably to clearance, have not 'migrated', and have not degraded (unless old stock was used; old mines can become unstable). In this they are often aided by [[technical intelligence]] on the current adversary's mines, which are usually of a single type.

In these mine clearance operations, the methods that are applied for detection and removal are quicker, but less exhaustive. These methods include those that detect and remove in a single action, such as mechanical demining, [[carpet bombing]], burning of the land or the use of [[Bangalore torpedo]]es or [[mine-clearing line charge]]s.

In times of relative peace, the process of mine removal is referred to as '''demining'''. This is a thorough, time-intensive process that seeks to locate any and all mines so that the land or sea area may be safely returned to normal use. It is vital that this process be exhaustive. Even if only a small handful of mines remain undiscovered, incomplete demining can actually lead to an increase in civilian mine casualties as local people re-occupy an area they previously avoided in the belief that it has been made safe. In this context demining is one of the tools of [[mine action]]. Coordinated by [[Mine Action Coordination Center]]s run by the [[United Nations]] or a host government, civilian [[mine clearance agencies]] are tasked with the demining. In post-conflict areas, minefields are often contaminated with a mixture of [[explosive remnants of war]] (ERW) that includes [[unexploded ordnance]] as well as landmines. In that context, the humanitarian clearance effort is often referred to as battle area clearance.

In some situations, clearing landmines is a necessary condition before other humanitarian programs can be implemented.&lt;ref name="drmyths"&gt;'[http://www.mech.uwa.edu.au/jpt/demining/info/myths.html Landmines - Some Common Myths]" Demining Research website. University of Western Australia, updated January, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; A large-scale international effort has been made to test and evaluate existing and new technologies for humanitarian demining, notably by the EU, US, Canadian and Japanese governments and by the Mine Action Centres of affected countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itep.ws |title=International Test and Evaluation Program for Humanitarian Demining (ITEP) |publisher=Itep.ws |date= |accessdate=September 10, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310031206/http://www.itep.ws/ |archivedate=March 10, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://serac.jrc.it/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=blogsection&amp;id=7&amp;Itemid=51 |title=Serac Unit - :Metal detector Trials |publisher=Serac.jrc.it |date= |accessdate=September 10, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604015421/http://serac.jrc.it/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=blogsection&amp;id=7&amp;Itemid=51 |archivedate=June  4, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, Afghanistan and Iraq is consuming the largest amount of demining funds, with 24.8% and 15.1% respectively of the global spending on humanitarian demining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mineaction.org/pms/visualization |title=Portfolio of Mine Action Projects - graphs and charts |publisher=[[UNMAS]] |accessdate=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current humanitarian demining methods ==
The main methods used for humanitarian demining on land are: manual detection using [[metal detector]]s and prodders, detection by specially trained mine detection dogs, and mechanical clearance using armored vehicles fitted with [[mine flail|flails]], [[tiller]] or similar devices. There is an organization, [[APOPO]], that is training African rats to detect landmines much as dogs do, offering a local solution to countries in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apopo.org/newsite/content/index.htm|title=A P O P O|publisher=A P O P O|date=|accessdate=September 10, 2009| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080802214756/http://www.apopo.org/newsite/content/index.htm| archivedate = August 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many circumstances, the only method that meets the United Nations' requirements for effective humanitarian demining, the International Mine Action Standards (IMAS),&lt;ref name="gichd.ch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gichd.ch/42.0.html|title=International Mine Action Standards (IMAS) project|publisher=Gichd.ch|date=|accessdate=September 10, 2009| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061212141823/http://www.gichd.ch/42.0.html| archivedate=December 12, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; is manual detection and disarmament.&lt;ref name="drwhatis"&gt;"[http://www.mech.uwa.edu.au/jpt/demining/info/what-is.html What Is Demining?]" Demining Research website.

=== Manual detection with a metal detector ===
[[File:Detecteur de metal 501607 fh000007.jpg|thumb|Foerster Minex 2FD 4.500 [[metal detector]] used by the [[French army]].]]
Metal detectors were first used, after their invention by the Polish officer [[Józef Kosacki]].&lt;ref&gt;''The History of Landmines'' by Mike Croll published in Great Britain in 1998 by Leo Cooper, Pen &amp; Sword Books Ltd. {{ISBN|0-85052-628-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allies used his invention, known as the [[Polish mine detector]], to clear the German mine fields during the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]] when 500 units were shipped to [[Field Marshal Montgomery]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Polish Contribution to The Ultimate Allied Victory in The Second World War" Tadeusz Modelski, Worthing, England 1986, Page 221&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vSYDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA93&amp;dq=popular+science+june+1941&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=cT2TTNqUB9Ofnwfn49ywCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true Popular Science, May 1943, ''Detector Spots Buried Mines'']&lt;/ref&gt; The "Polish" mine detector was later used together with the [[ERA mine-locator]] for detecting beach mines.&lt;ref&gt;The Royal Engineers Journal 1962-76 p34 "One man uses the early "Polish" mine-detector whilst others use the ERA mine-locator."&lt;/ref&gt;

The first step in manual demining is to scan the area with [[metal detector]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gichd.org/fileadmin/pdf/LIMA/metal_detector_handbook.pdf |title=Metal detector handbook for humanitarian demining |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=November 8, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303171513/http://www.gichd.org/fileadmin/pdf/LIMA/metal_detector_handbook.pdf |archivedate=March 3, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which are sensitive enough to pick up most mines but which also yield about one thousand [[false positive]]s for every mine.&lt;ref name="drwhatis" /&gt; Some mines, referred to as [[minimum metal mine]]s, are constructed with as little metal as possible - as little as {{convert|1|g|oz}} - to make them difficult to detect. Mines with no metal at all have been produced, but are rare. Areas where metal is detected are carefully probed to determine if a mine is present; the probing must continue until the object that set off the metal detector is found.

=== Dogs ===
Well-trained [[dog]]s can sniff out explosive chemicals like [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]] in landmines, and are used in several countries.&lt;ref name="drdogs"&gt;[http://www.mech.uwa.edu.au/jpt/demining/k9/dogs-in-use.html "Mine Detection Dogs in Use"]. Demining Research website. University of Western Australia, updated March 28, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rats ===
Like dogs, [[giant pouched rat]]s are being trained to sniff out chemicals like [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]] in landmines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apopo.org|title=APOPO|publisher=APOPO|date=|accessdate=September 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; These rats are currently working in minefields in [[Mozambique]] and are trained in Tanzania by [[APOPO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reliefweb.int/rw/res.nsf/db900SID/OCHA-7FBE3S?OpenDocument |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20080612000625/http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/res.nsf/db900SID/OCHA-7FBE3S?OpenDocument |dead-url=yes |archive-date=June 12, 2008 |title=ReliefWeb » Vacancy » Management of APOPO Mine Action Operations |publisher=Reliefweb.int |date=July 31, 2008 |accessdate=September 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rats are called [[HeroRATS]].

These animals also have the advantage of being far lower mass than the human or dogs. They are less likely to set off small mines intended to injure or kill people, if the bomb-sniffing animal crosses directly over the top of a buried mine.

=== Mechanical clearance ===
Special machines effectively combine mine detection and removal into one operation. In the past, these machines were applied in both mine clearance and demining but are now generally used only for demining. They can be used to verify land that is not expected to be contaminated or as an extra layer of security after an area has been cleared by another method, such as dogs.

The machines consist of a special vehicle that is driven through the minefield, deliberately detonating the mines it drives over. These vehicles are designed to withstand the explosions with little damage. Some are operated directly with armour to protect the driver; some are operated under remote control.
*[[Mine roller]]s and [[mine flail]]s. The roller method originated during [[World War I]] and the flail method during [[World War II]] but both are still used. Neither system is completely reliable and both will leave undetonated mines, requiring the minefield to be rechecked by another method. Mine flail effectiveness can approach 100% in ideal conditions, but clearance rates as low as 50–60% have been reported.&lt;ref name="Geneva Report" &gt;{{cite journal|title=A Study of Mechanical Application in Demining|publisher=Geneva International Centre for Humanitarian Demining|year=2004|url=http://www.gichd.org/fileadmin/pdf/publications/Mechanical_study/Mechanical_study_complete.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=July 23, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is well below the 99.6% standard set by the United Nations for humanitarian demining.&lt;ref name="drwhatis" /&gt;
*[[Mine plow]] - a device in front of a tank that excavates the ground, exposing any mines or turning them upside down, which significantly lessens their effects if they explode.
**The two of the above are sometimes combined on the same vehicle.
*Modified long-armed demining [[bulldozer]]s are being used in a number of countries. They have the capability to remove vegetation before demining and can withstand antipersonnel and antitank landmines. Their long arms provide the benefit of reducing damage to the main body, especially to the operator's cab. The operator is protected from directional mines with {{convert|3|in|cm|adj=mid|-thick}} [[bulletproof glass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.film.hitachi.jp/en/movie/movie705.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070507105101/http://www.film.hitachi.jp/en/movie/movie705.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=May  7, 2007 |title=Hitachi Now: The Challenge of Demining (Part 1) Returning fertility to the land and putting a smile on the face of the children |publisher=Film.hitachi.jp |date= |accessdate=September 10, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/gadgets/notag/japanese-contraption-safely-removes-landmines-8998.php|title=Japanese Contraption Safely Removes Landmines|publisher=Gizmodo.com|date=March 30, 2004|accessdate=September 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ud2006.net/en/schedule/speaker/amemiya.html|title=Kiyoshi Amemiya: Invited Speaker – The 2nd International Conference for Universal Design in Kyoto 2006|publisher=Ud2006.net|date=|accessdate=September 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

Recently, armies have developed armored demining vehicles, and specially [[armored bulldozer]]s, that are remote controlled. This eliminates risk to the operator. Notable examples are the [[Caterpillar D7]] MCAP (United States) and [[Raam HaShachar]] [[Caterpillar D9]]N (Israel).

== Personal protective equipment ==
[[File:Spezialschuhe eines Minenraeumanzuges.jpg|thumb|Shoes of [[protective clothing]]]]
Deminers may be issued [[personal protective equipment]] (PPE) such as helmets, visors, armoured gloves, vests and boots, in an attempt to protect them if a mine is set off by accident. IMAS specifies standards for such equipment but draws attention to its limitations and states that at close quarters, antipersonnel fragmentation mines and antitank mines overmatch PPE currently available.&lt;ref name="gichd.ch"/&gt; PPE can afford significant protection against antipersonnel blast mines, and these are more common. Related technologies that have been developed to improve safety include large, pillow-like pads strapped to the bottoms of shoes that distribute weight and dull the impact of footsteps, as very slight disturbances of the ground can tip off old, unstable, or intentionally sensitive mine triggers.  First developed in 1954 by the British as overshoes that are first inflated by the combat soldier, this specialized footwear has become a needed item for some demining operations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=sdwDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA106&amp;dq=1954+Popular+Mechanics+January&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Pv4YT5SlG5PoggekxISEDA&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "Inflatable Sneakers for Mine Field Distributes Weight Safely."] ''Popular Mechanics'', November 1954, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Removal methods ==

=== Removal methods in demining ===
In demining, once an object has been detected it is removed by one of the following methods: 
* Manual disarmament.
* Remote burning of the explosive. Where possible, it is better to burn the explosive without detonation. [[Diethylene triamine]] (a close relative of [[ethylenediamine]]) reacts with TNT to generate heat. The compound that results from this reaction can then be combusted without detonation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanitarian-demining.org/demining/pubs/neutral/insituchem.asp |title=Humanitarian-demining.org |publisher= |accessdate=22 April 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060408184828/http://www.humanitarian-demining.org/demining/pubs/neutral/insituchem.asp |archivedate= 8 April 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been reported that this amine is [[hypergolic]] with TNT, [[Tetryl]], [[Composition B]] and other TNT based explosives, but it does not react in the same way with RDX or [[PETN]]-based explosives. Other nitrogen-containing organic ligands (e.g. [[pyridine]], [[diethylamine]] and [[pyrole]]) are known to be hypergolic with TNT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanitarian-demining.org/demining/pubs/neutral/eudem.asp |title=Humanitarian-demining.org |publisher= |accessdate=22 April 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050310215138/http://www.humanitarian-demining.org/demining/pubs/neutral/eudem.asp |archivedate=10 March 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Setting the mine on fire while avoiding high-order detonation. This can be done by cutting holes in the mine without detonating its contents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mech.uwa.edu.au/jpt/demining/tech/pn-chem/ecm.html|title=Electrochemical Machining for UXO Neutralisation|publisher=Mech.uwa.edu.au|date=|accessdate=September 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Removal methods in mine clearance ===
Some removal methods that are not applied in humanitarian demining, but are common in mine clearance, include:
* The [[Bangalore Torpedo]] of World War II — the predecessor to the [[mine-clearing line charge]] that clears a path through a minefield. This can also be done using the [[Antipersonnel Obstacle Breaching System]] or [[Giant Viper]], a hose-pipe filled with explosives and carried across a minefield by a rocket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Pike|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/munitions/apobs.htm|title=Mk7 Antipersonnel Obstacle Breaching Systems (APOBS)|publisher=Globalsecurity.org|date=January 25, 2006|accessdate=September 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Helicopter]]s dragging a plow to overturn or detonate mines. This has the problem of bringing down the helicopter when the plow snags onto objects such as large rocks, but has been corrected by use of pressure-sensitive plow rakes which release when over-pressured. This does, however, affect its effectiveness as mines planted in hard ground or near rocks will not be detonated.
* [[Cattle]] and other heavy livestock are often left to graze in mined areas in order to facilitate mine detonation.
* The Nazi Germans used captured civilians who were chased across minefields to detonate the explosives. According to Laurence Rees, "[[Curt von Gottberg]], the SS-Obergruppenfuhrer who, during 1943, conducted another huge anti-partisan action called [[Operation Cottbus|Operation Kottbus]] on the eastern border of [[BSSR|Belorussia]], reported that 'approximately two to three thousand local people were blown up in the clearing of the minefields'."&lt;ref&gt;Laurence Rees (1999). ''[[War of the Century|War of the century: when Hitler fought Stalin]]''. [[BBC Books]]. p.118. {{ISBN|0-563-38477-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Case study ==
Along the China-Vietnam border are numerous minefields. These are the legacy of border clashes in the 1980s. The mines are mainly anti-personnel, and have kept large areas of arable land from use by local farmers. A typical demining process deployed by the Chinese is as follows. Firebreaks are dug around the minefield to be cleared. Then engineers would set the minefield on fire with flamethrowers. Key factors of this burning process are: thick vegetation covering the minefields; most anti-personnel mines are buried very close to the ground level; the mines are made of mostly either wood, thin metal or plastic. This burning process would usually destroy about 90% of the mines, as the mines are either detonated or melted. Mines which have trip wires would have these wires burned off. Demining teams then would plow the area with mine detectors. When the teams have cleared the mines, they would walk over the field hand in hand themselves to show to the locals that all the mines have been cleared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icbl.org/lm/2004/china|title=China , Landmine Monitor Report 2004|publisher=Icbl.org|date=|accessdate=September 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Detection methods under development ==
In 2003, the Rand Corporation published a comprehensive report on innovative methods of landmine detection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.rand.org/pubs/monograph_reports/MR1608/index.html |series= Monograph/Reports |title= Alternatives for Landmine Detection |publisher=RAND |date=2003 |accessdate= September 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Advanced electromagnetic methods ===

==== Ground penetrating radar ====
Conventional metal detectors rely on electromagnetic signals with frequencies of the order of 10–100&amp;nbsp;kHz, which are not sensitive to plastic or wooden mine bodies and the high explosive block itself. The only part of a low-metal mine that they may be able to detect is the detonator. Much higher frequency signals (of the order of 1&amp;nbsp;GHz) are employed in Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) and these signals are also sensitive to the non-metallic parts of the mine. Unfortunately, as they are also affected by innocuous objects such as tree roots and stones and by local changes in soil moisture, it is difficult to distinguish a mine on a GPR image.

==== Dual-sensor ====
A hybrid approach employing both GPR and metal detector sensors in a single instrument has been developed by several companies and research organisations.

=== Biological detection ===

==== Honey bees ====
{{main article|Trained hymenoptera}}
Research by the University of Montana has revealed that [[honey bee]]s can, with minimal training, be used to detect landmines with a far greater accuracy and far higher clearance rate than dogs or rats.&lt;ref name="Journal of Mine Action"&gt;[http://maic.jmu.edu/JOURNAL/7.3/focus/bromenshenk/bromenshenk.htm "Bees used in Area Reduction and Mine Detection"]. Jerry J. Bromenshenk et al. Journal of Mine Action. Issue 7.3. December 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mammals ====
Recent experiments with the [[Gambian giant pouched rat]], also known as the African giant pouched rat, have indicated that it has the required sensitivity to smell, can be trained reliably with food-reward incentives, and is typically too small to set off the mines.&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;[http://www.aegis.com/news/re/2004/RE040956.html "Move Over Sniffer Dogs, Here Come Africa's Rats."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051205100017/http://www.aegis.com/news/re/2004/RE040956.html |date=2005-12-05 }} Reuters, September 27, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; These rats also offer a local solution to many African countries because they are indigenous to East Africa. These rats are trained by a non-profit, research organization called [[APOPO]] and are called HeroRATs.
Additionally, experiments with [[electrode-guided rat]]s suggest that demining could one day be accomplished by guiding "ratbots" into areas that humans are unable to reach.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/1961798.stm "Here Come the Ratbots"]. BBC News, May 1, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Engineer Thrishantha Nanayakkara and colleagues at the University of Moratuwa in Sri Lanka have come up with a method where a [[dwarf mongoose]] is trained to detect landmines by smell and guided by a remote-controlled robot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/channel/tech/mg19826535.900-mongooserobot-duo-sniff-out-landmines-on-the-cheap.html|title=Mongoose-robot duo sniff out landmines|publisher=Technology.newscientist.com|date=April 26, 2008|accessdate=September 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~thrish/Books/Hedem_chap.pdf |title=A Human-Animal-Robot Cooperative System for Anti-Personal Mine Detection |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=September 10, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327111331/http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~thrish/Books/Hedem_chap.pdf |archivedate=March 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[U.S. Navy Marine Mammal Program]] uses [[California_sea_lion#Intelligence_and_trainability|sea lions]] and [[Military dolphin|dolphins]], among other species, in the detection of [[seamines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spawar.navy.mil/sandiego/technology/mammals/mine_hunting.html|title=Mine Hunting Systems of the U.S. Navy Marine Mammal Program|publisher=Spawar.navy.mil|date=|accessdate=September 10, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414132416/http://www.spawar.navy.mil/sandiego/technology/mammals/mine_hunting.html|archivedate=April 14, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Plants ====
The [[mustard plant|mustard]] ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'', one of the best-studied plants in the world, normally turns red under harsh conditions. But using a combination of natural mutations and genetic manipulation, scientists from Danish [[biotechnology]] company Aresa Biodetection, created a strain that only changes color in response to the [[nitrous oxide]] that leaks from landmines and other explosives. Because nitrous oxide can also be formed by [[denitrifying bacteria]], there is some risk of false positives using this technique, and researchers are attempting to make the plant less sensitive. The plants would aid demining by indicating the presence of mines through color change, and could either be sown from [[aircraft]] or by people walking through demined corridors in minefields. As of February 2005, no studies have been conducted with actual landmines, though successful studies have been done in greenhouses. In order to prevent the spread of this [[genetically modified organism]] into the wild, the plants have been further modified so that they will only sprout when provided with an external growth factor.&lt;ref name="acf"&gt;[http://www.acfnewsource.org/science/mine_sniffing_plants.html Mine-sniffing Plants] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060105182641/http://www.acfnewsource.org/science/mine_sniffing_plants.html |date=January 5, 2006 }}.

==== Bacteria ====
A [[bacterium]], known as a [[bioreporter]], has been genetically engineered to [[fluoresce]] under [[ultraviolet light]] in the presence of [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]]. Tests involving spraying such bacteria over a simulated minefield successfully located mines. In the field, this method could allow for searching hundreds of acres in a few hours, which is much faster than other techniques, and could be used on a variety of terrain types. While there are some false positives (especially near plants and water drainage), even three ounces of TNT were detectable using these bacteria. Unfortunately, there is no strain of bacteria capable of detecting [[RDX]], another common explosive, and the bacteria may not be visible under desert conditions. Also, well-constructed munitions that have not had time to corrode may be undetectable using this method.&lt;ref name="burlage"&gt;R.S. Burlage, M. Hunt, J. DiBenedetto, and M. Maston.

=== Nuclear detection ===

There are two principal techniques to detect land mines through nuclear reactions. Both rely on the use of [[neutron]]s.

The first such technique relies on the fact that the vast majority of [[explosive]]s used in land mines are very [[nitrogen]] rich when compared with other materials. To detect such anomalies one may make use of the nuclear reaction

:&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;(n, γ)&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N (10.8 MeV)

In practice a detection system using this reaction works by subjecting the mine to [[thermal neutrons]] while searching for the characteristic gamma ray emitted from the excited state in nitrogen-15; these photons will only be observed when an object containing nitrogen is being subjected to the neutron irradiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull432/article4.pdf |title=IAEA.org |publisher= |accessdate=22 April 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927002301/http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull432/article4.pdf |archivedate=27 September 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; One possible neutron source is [[californium]]-252 which undergoes spontaneous [[Nuclear fission|fission]]. A better neutron source is to use a sealed tube electrostatic D-T neutron generation tube, this has the advantage that the [[tritium]] is much less [[radiotoxic]] than the californium so in the event of an accident such as an explosion, the nuclear mine detection equipment would pose a smaller threat to humans. This type of explosive detection has been proposed for use in [[airport security]] and for the detection of explosives in [[truck]]s coming into [[military]] bases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nuke.hun.edu.tr/~lo/ak-drug.pdf |title=Aydin Karahan, "Drug and Explosive Detection" |publisher= |accessdate=22 April 2017 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050213120534/http://www.nuke.hun.edu.tr/~lo/ak-drug.pdf |archivedate=13 February 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/issues/2003/Jun/Fast_Neutron.htm NDM Article - Fast Neutron Technology Used for Explosive Detection&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061008234043/http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/issues/2003/Jun/Fast_Neutron.htm |date=October 8, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bath.ac.uk/~lh226/idaho.pdf Batch.ac.uk] {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative way of spotting land mines through nuclear reactions with the help of neutrons is that of measuring the thermalization of neutrons. In this technique the soil is irradiated by fast neutrons and the flux of thermal neutrons scattering back is measured. The motivation for this technique is that explosives contain much higher concentrations of hydrogen, which is a very effective moderator of neutrons.&lt;ref&gt;356 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE, VOL. 53, NO. 1, FEBRUARY 2006

=== Acoustic detection ===
It is possible to detect land mines by directing [[sound waves]] at the area to be demined, which causes the land mines to vibrate, and then using a laser to search for vibrations on the surface by means of the Doppler shift - this technique is termed [[scanning laser doppler vibrometry]]. Such devices have been constructed, e.g., at the [[University of Mississippi]],&lt;ref name="SLDV Miss"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/8859/28004/101109LGRS2004836257.pdf|format=PDF|title=Laser Doppler Vibrometer-Based Acoustic Landmine Detection Using the Fast M-Sequence Transform, N Xiang and J M Sabatier, IEEE Geosci. and Remote Sens.

=== Drones ===
Since January 2016 British scientists are developing [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drones]] with advanced imaging technology to more cheaply and effectively map and speed up the clearing of minefields. The [[Find A Better Way]] charity, working since 2011 to advance technologies that will enable safer and more efficient clearance of landmines, teamed up with scientists at the [[University of Bristol]] to develop drones fitted with [[hyperspectral imaging]] technology that can quickly identify landmines buried in the ground. John Fardoulis, project researcher from Bristol University states that "the maps [their] drones will generate should help deminers focus on the places where mines are most likely to be found". Their intended drones will be able to perform flyovers and gather images at various wavelengths which, according to Dr John Day from the University of Bristol, could indicate explosive chemicals seeping from landmines into the surrounding foliage as "chemicals in landmines leak out and are often absorbed by plants, causing abnormalities" which can be detected as "living plants have a very distinctive reflection in the near infrared spectrum, just beyond human vision, which makes it possible to tell how healthy they are".&lt;ref name="newatlas"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lavars|first1=Nick|title=Imaging drones to spot signs of explosive chemicals leaking from landmines|url=http://newatlas.com/drones-landmines-bristol/42732/|publisher=New Atlas|accessdate=20 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2015 $1 million [[Drones for Good]] competition, Spanish company [[CATUAV]] was selected as a finalist for a drone fitted with optical sensors to scan war-affected regions of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] for landmines buried during the 1990s.&lt;ref name="newatlas"/&gt;&lt;!--aerial photographs from the drone are run through a post-processing programme that provides a mosaic map of the area and determines the probability of landmines.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wasmi|first1=Naser Al|title=UAE entrants offer positive alternatives uses for drones in competition|url=http://www.thenational.ae/uae/technology/uae-entrants-offer-positive-alternatives-uses-for-drones-in-competition|publisher=The National|accessdate=20 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adams|first1=Derek|title=Drones for Good awards to give $1 million to UAVs that do things other than killing and spying|url=http://www.t3.com/news/drones-for-good-awards|publisher=T3|accessdate=20 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kennedy|first1=David|title=How these drones for disaster relief and eliminating landmines are aiming to rebrand the controversial technology|url=http://business.financialpost.com/fp-tech-desk/how-these-drones-for-disaster-relief-and-eliminating-landmines-are-aiming-to-rebrand-the-controversial-technology?__lsa=0180-ebbe|publisher=Financial Post|accessdate=20 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dutch Mine Kafon project, led by designer &lt;!--Afghanistan-born--&gt;Massoud Hassani is working on a drone system that can quickly detect and clear land mines. The unmanned airborne de-mining system called [[Mine Kafon Drone]] uses a three step process to autonomously map, detect and detonate land mines. It flies above potentially dangerous areas, generating a 3D map, and uses a metal detector to pinpoint the location of mines. The drone can then place a detonator above the mines using its robotic gripping arm, before retreating to a safe distance. The firm claims its drone is safer, 20 times faster and up to 200 times cheaper than current technologies and might clear mines globally in 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vincent|first1=James|title=This drone can detect and detonate land mines|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/19/12222104/landmine-detecting-drone-mine-kafon-drone|publisher=The Verge|accessdate=20 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Liberatore|first1=Stacy|title=Land mine-hunting drone aims to rid the world of EVERY ground explosive in under 10 years|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3734014/Land-hunting-drone-aims-rid-world-ground-explosive-10-years-Firm-claims-20-times-faster-traditional-techniques.html|publisher=Dailymail|accessdate=20 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Myers|first1=Joe|title=This drone could help remove all landmines around the world in 10 years|url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/08/this-is-a-landmine-hunting-drone|publisher=World Economic Forum|accessdate=20 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project raised funds on the [[crowdfunding]] site [[Kickstarter]] with their goal set at €70,000 and receiving over €100,000 above it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mine Kafon Drone on Kickstarter|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/massoudhassani/mine-kafon-drone|accessdate=20 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Encino Oak Tree''', also known as the '''Lang Oak''', was a 1,000-year-old California live oak tree, ''[[Quercus agrifolia]]'', in the [[Encino, Los Angeles, California|Encino]] section of [[Los Angeles, California]].  It was designated as a [[Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument]] (HCM #24) in 1963.  

==History of the oak==
The ''Los Angeles Times'' once wrote of the Encino oak: "When the famed Lang oak tree of Encino was but a sapling, the Mayan Empire was crumbling and Vikings were sacking English sea towns."&lt;ref name=Times&gt;{{cite news|author=Steve Padilla|title=Ancient Oak May Be Out on a Limb Nature: The 1,000-year-old Encino landmark is threatened by disease and drought. Experts differ over what to do|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=1991-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was already 100 years old when [[Pope Urban II]] launched the first Crusade.  And when the first Europeans passed through Encino in 1769 as part of the Portola Expedition, the tree was already more than 700 years old.&lt;ref name=Guide&gt;{{cite book|author=Judson Grenier (Editor-in-chief)|title=A Guide to Historic Places in Los Angeles County, p. 96|publisher=Kendall/Hunt Publishing Co.|year=1978|isbn=0-8403-7501-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Encino landmark==
As Encino was developed into a residential community in the mid-20th century, the Encino oak became recognized as a landmark, known for its size and longevity.  It was recognized as "the oldest known tree in the city of Los Angeles."&lt;ref name=Rense&gt;{{cite news|author=Rip Rense|title=L.A. Stories; An Elder Statesman Rooted in History|publisher=Angeles Times|date=1996-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A California live oak tree is considered to be old at 300 years, and arborists considered the Encino tree's longevity to be extraordinary.  One arborist noted, "It's just like standing next to a dinosaur."&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;

The majestic California live oaks were such an impressive presence in the pre-urban Encino that the community was named after the Spanish word for "oak."  The Encino oak was the most magnificent of the community's oaks, so large that Louise Avenue was split to accommodate its enormous {{convert|150|ft|adj=on}} canopy, {{convert|8|ft|adj=on}} diameter, and {{convert|24|ft|adj=on}} circumference.&lt;ref name=Guide/&gt;&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;  It has been said that the Encino oak "creates a woodsy atmosphere more resembling a whole forest than just a single tree."&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;

In 1958, the oak was threatened when a developer planned to bulldoze the tree to build a road.  Local residents formed a group called Encino Save the Oaks and the developer eventually donated the tree to the city.  It was declared a Historic-Cultural Monument in 1963. In the years following its designation as a monument, the tree was a tourist attraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Gloria Lopez|title=A Crook in the Road|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=1985-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Threatened by slime flux and other ailments==
By the 1990s, the tree was in a weakened condition.  Some attributed its condition to the Encino Reservoir, built in 1921, for cutting off the natural water flow to the tree.  Others blamed it on air pollution from traffic on nearby Ventura Boulevard.  It also suffered from oak-root fungus.&lt;ref name=Rense/&gt;  In 1991, it was diagnosed with [[slime flux]], a tree ailment caused by bacteria that generate fermentation inside the tree and send toxic sap oozing through the bark.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;  Arborists reported that the tree desperately needed special care to save it.  Arborists and city officials argued over the proper treatment for the ailing tree, with one arborist suggesting the city chisel small holes in the bark to release the toxic sap that was slowly killing the oak.  Others suggested the drilling would put too much stress on the tree, which should be allowed to heal itself.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;

Efforts to save the ailing oak became a publicized cause.  In 1996, the ''Times'' reported on the oak: "His skin is mottled, some of his limbs are held together with pins, and his great, shaggy head hangs from its own weight.  Old Lang is in trouble."&lt;ref name=Rense/&gt;  In 1997, the Encino oak was honored at an Arbor Day ceremony attended by Wirt Morton, the great-great-grandson of National Arbor Day founder J. Sterling Morton, who on seeing the giant oak said: "I've never seen anything as phenomenal as that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Sylvia L. Oliande|title=Encino; Lang Oak Honored on State Arbor Day|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=1997-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Stacy Brown|title=Grand-old Tree: Lang Oak Praised on Arbor Day|publisher=Daily News (Los Angeles, CA)|date=1997-03-08|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-83858687.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death in El Niño rains==
On February 7, 1998, an [[El Niño]] storm "delivered the death blow, felling the ailing tree with storm winds."&lt;ref name=Ribbon&gt;{{cite news|author=Agnes Digggs|title=Valley Roundup; Encino; Piece of Lang Oak Tree to Be Unveiled at Park|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=1999-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Tree Dies, but Not Its Legacy|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=1998-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Peter Hartlaub|title=Arboreal Landmark Succumbs to Rain: 1,000-Year-Old Oak Collapses in Encino|publisher=Daily News (Los Angeles, CA)|date=1998-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Editorial: Goodbye to a Landmark|publisher=Daily News (Los Angeles, CA)|date=1998-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As news of the tree’s demise spread, onlookers gathered, some crying and taking branches as mementos.&lt;ref name=Storm&gt;{{cite news|author=Evelyn Larrubia|title=Storm's Oldest Casualty; History: Residents come to mourn as workers cut up 1,000-year-old Lang Oak, toppled in Saturday's rains. Encino landmark was declared a state monument in 1963|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=1998-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Evelyn Larrubia|title=If a Tree Falls in the Valley, We All Hear It|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=1998-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After decades of being threatened by development and pollution, one resident noted the irony that "now it goes because of nature."&lt;ref name=Storm/&gt;  As souvenir-hunters sought to take pieces of the tree, police officers guarded it until its remains could be removed. One officer noted: "It got out of control.  It's sad that we had to take two policemen off the street to watch a tree."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Eric Slater|title=After the Fall; Police Say Souvenir Seekers Are Barking Up Wrong Tree|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=1998-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the weeks following the tree's death, city officials debated what should be done with the tree's remains, leading the ''Times'' to ask: "How many bureaucrats, City Council aides, homeowners, urban planners and arborists does it take to decree the fate of a fallen king, the mighty oak of Ventura Boulevard?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Eric Slater|title=Officials Trim Options to Recycle Fallen Oak; Landmark: Meetings continue on what to do with 1,000-year-old Encino tree's trunk.

The city also unveiled an {{convert|8|x|6|ft|adj=on}} oval slice of the tree in an April 1999 ribbon-cutting ceremony.&lt;ref name=Ribbon/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Eric Slater|title=Tribute to Fallen Oak Will Be a Chip Off the Old Block|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=1998-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jesse Hiestand|title=Encino Planting Future Symbols: Community Picks 5-Tree Tribute for Histori Lang Oak|publisher=Daily News (Los Angeles, CA)|date=1998-04-18|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-83819081.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Exploration Mission-1''' or '''EM-1''' (previously known as '''Space Launch System 1''' or '''SLS-1''') is the uncrewed first planned flight of the [[Space Launch System]] and the second flight of the [[Orion (spacecraft)|Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle]]. The launch is planned for June 2020 from [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|Launch Complex 39B]] at the [[Kennedy Space Center]].&lt;ref name=2020-slip /&gt; The Orion spacecraft will spend approximately 3 weeks in space, including 6 days in a [[retrograde orbit]] around the [[Moon]].&lt;ref name="Nov15"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/feature/the-ins-and-outs-of-nasa-s-first-launch-of-sls-and-orion |title=The Ins and Outs of NASA's First Launch of SLS and Orion |publisher=[[NASA]] |editor-first=Daniel |editor-last=Huot |date=27 November 2015 |accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is planned to be followed by [[Exploration Mission 2]] in 2023.

==Mission overview==
[[File:Orion Exploration Mission-1 Animation.webm|thumb|left|Animation of EM-1]]
[[File:Orion Service Module (cropped).jpg|thumb|Orion spacecraft with the [[Delta Cryogenic Second Stage|ICPS]] in orbit]]
[[File:EM1-Mission-Map_Update.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|EM-1 will send an uncrewed Orion capsule 1.3 million miles over 25.5 days. It will deploy 13 CubeSats and re-enter at 24,000mph (mach 32).]]

The Block 1 version of SLS used on this mission will consist of two [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster#Five-segment booster|five-segment Solid Rocket Boosters]], four [[Space Shuttle Main Engine|RS-25D]] engines built for the Space Shuttle program and an [[Delta Cryogenic Second Stage|Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage]].&lt;ref name=Jody/&gt; EM-1 is intended to demonstrate the integrated spacecraft systems prior to a crewed flight, and in addition, test a high speed reentry (11&amp;nbsp;km/s) on Orion's thermal protection system.&lt;ref name=Jody/&gt;

On 16 January 2013, NASA announced that the [[European Space Agency]] will build the [[Orion Service Module]] based on its [[Automated Transfer Vehicle]], so the flight could also be regarded as a test of ESA hardware as well as American, and of how the ESA components interact with the American Orion components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/exploration/systems/mpcv/orion_feature_011613.html |title=Engineers resolve Orion will 'lose weight' in 2015 |publisher=NASA |date=16 January 2013 |accessdate=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Exploration Flight Test 1]] (EFT-1) flight article was consciously constructed in a way that if all the missing components (seats, life support systems) were added, it would not meet the mass target. It was planned that subsequent capsules would be modified to be lighter, based on manufacturing experience.

In January 2015 NASA and Lockheed announced that some components in the EM-1 capsule would be up to 25 percent lighter compared to the previous one. This would be achieved by changes to the primary structure - the EM-1 article would be welded together from 3 panels for the cone, as opposed to 6 panels used for the [[Exploration Flight Test 1|EFT-1]] article. The total number of welds was reduced from 19 to 7,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.waaytv.com/space_alabama/orion-program-manager-talks-eft--in-huntsville/article_17894640-9b43-11e4-b731-1feb498f3882.html |title=Orion program manager talks EFT-1 in Huntsville |work=Space Alabama |publisher=WAAY |first=Josh |last=Barrett |date=13 January 2015 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/YKKUw |archivedate=18 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus saving the additional mass of the weld material. Other savings would be due to revisiting its various components and wiring. For EM-1 the capsule will be outfitted with complete life support system and crew seats, but will be left uncrewed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.waff.com/story/27841631/engineers-resolve-orion-will-lose-weight-in-2015 |title=Engineers resolve Orion will 'lose weight' in 2015 |publisher=WAFF |date=13 January 2015 |accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in February 2017 NASA announced that [[Robert M. Lightfoot Jr.]], the agency's Acting Administrator, had asked the Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate to study the feasibility of redesigning the mission to include a crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-to-study-adding-crew-to-first-flight-of-sls-and-orion |title=NASA to Study Adding Crew to First Flight of SLS and Orion |publisher=NASA |editor-first=Brian |editor-last=Dunbar |date=15 February 2017 |accessdate=15 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crewed version===
The mission will be uncrewed, however NASA did initiate a study to investigate a crewed version of the mission. A crewed version of EM-1 would be composed of a crew of two astronauts, and will be much shorter than the uncrewed version due to safety reasons. The study investigated a crewed mission even with the possibility of further delays to the launch.&lt;ref name="warner"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-kicks-off-study-to-add-crew-to-first-flight-of-orion-sls-as-progress-continues-to-send |title=NASA Kicks Off Study to Add Crew to First Flight of Orion, SLS |publisher=NASA |last=Warner |first=Cheryl |accessdate=27 February 2017 |date=24 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 May 2017 NASA revealed that it will not be sending astronauts to space for Orion's EM-1 mission following a months-long feasibility study.&lt;ref name="uncrewed"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2017/05/nasa-em-1-uncrewed-costs-main-reason/ |title=NASA will not put a crew on EM-1, cites cost – not safety – as main reason |work=[[NASASpaceFlight.com]] |first=Chris |last=Gebhardt |date=12 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Originally EM-1 was planned to follow a [[circumlunar trajectory]] without entering orbit around the Moon.&lt;ref name=HEOC/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jody&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spirit.as.utexas.edu/~fiso/telecon/Singer_4-25-12/Singer_4-25-12.pdf |title=Status of NASA's Space Launch System |publisher=NASA Marshall Space Flight Center |last=Singer |first=Jody |date=25 April 2012 |accessdate=5 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chronology==
{{EM1 chronology}}

==Orion payloads==

[[NASA]] has partnered with the [[German Aerospace Center]] (DLR) and the [[Israel Space Agency]] (ISA) in conjunction with [[StemRad]] and [[Lockheed Martin]] to perform the Matroshka AstroRad Radiation Experiment (MARE), which will measure tissue dose deposition and test the effectiveness of the AstroRad radiation vest in a radiation environment beyond [[low Earth orbit]]. While radiation shielding strategies of the past have relied on storm shelters in which astronauts can seek refuge as solar storms erupt, the AstroRad's ergonomic design provides a mobile protection system with the same shielding factor as storm shelters without hindering the astronauts’ ability to perform mission sensitive tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-israeli-space-agencies-join-forces-to-protect-astronauts-from-radiation-1523969713 |title=U.S., Israeli Space Agencies Join Forces to Protect Astronauts From Radiation |last=Pasztor |first=Andy |date=17 April 2018 |work=Wall Street Journal |access-date=21 June 2018 |language=en-US |issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crew compartment of the unmanned EM-1 [[Orion (spacecraft)|Orion spacecraft]] will include two female anthropomorphic [[imaging phantom|phantoms]] which will be exposed to the intense radiation environment along the lunar orbit, including solar storms and galactic [[cosmic ray]]s. One phantom will be shielded with the AstroRad and the other will be left unprotected. The phantoms provide the opportunity to precisely measure radiation exposure not only at the surface of the body, but also at the exact location of sensitive organs and tissues inside the human body. Radiation exposure will be measured with implementation of both passive and active [[dosimeter]]s intentionally distributed throughout the inside of the anthropomorphic phantoms at precise locations of sensitive tissues and high stem cell concentrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=https://ispcs.com/wp-content/uploads/Thomas-Berger-ISPCS-2017-FINAL-1.compressed.pdf |title=Exploration Missions and Radiation |conference=International Symposium for Personal and Commercial Spaceflight. 11-12 October 2017.

On 17 March 2016, the [[Democratic Federation of Northern Syria|Federation of Northern Syria - Rojava]] was unilaterally declared a federation of [[Regions of Rojava|autonomous cantons]] modelled after the [[Cantons of Switzerland]], namely [[Afrin Region|Afrin Canton]], [[Jazira Region|Jazira Canton]] and [[Euphrates Region|Kobanî Canton]] as well as [[Shahba Canton|Shahba region]]. The federation is considered by its protagonists to be a model for Syria as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/analysis-kurds-syria-rojava-1925945786|title=ANALYSIS: 'This is a new Syria, not a new Kurdistan'|work=MiddleEastEye|date=21 March 2016|accessdate=11 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move was dismissed by the Syrian government and disapproved by Turkey and the United States.&lt;ref name=Kurds-declare&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-35830375|title=Syria conflict: Kurds declare federal system|work=BBC News|date=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016, the Secretary-General of the [[Arab League]], [[Ahmed Aboul Gheit]], came out in an interview as one of the first regional politicians taking a public stand for the federalization of Syria. He said that the establishment of a federal system in Syria would "guarantee to preserve the institutions and unity" and that a federal system would be "the most appropriate solution and will protect the country from destruction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=أمين جامعة الدول العربية: النظام الفدرالي هو الحل الأنسب لسوريا|url=http://aranews.org/2016/09/%d8%a3%d9%85%d9%8a%d9%86-%d8%ac%d8%a7%d9%85%d8%b9%d8%a9-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%af%d9%88%d9%84-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b9%d8%b1%d8%a8%d9%8a%d8%a9-%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%86%d8%b8%d8%a7%d9%85-%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%81%d8%af%d8%b1/|work=ARA News|date=28 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2016, a Russian initiative for federalization with a focus on northern Syria was reported, which at its core called to turn the existing institutions of the [[Democratic Federation of Northern Syria|Federation of Northern Syria - Rojava]] into legitimate institutions of Syria; also reported was its rejection for the time being by the Syrian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Syria rejects Russian proposal for Kurdish federation|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/10/turkey-russia-mediates-between-kurds-and-assad.html|publisher=Al-Monitor|date=24 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Syrian peace process#First round of Astana talks (January 2017)|multilateral peace talks in Astana]] in January 2017, Russia offered a draft for a future constitution of Syria, which would inter alia turn the "Syrian Arab Republic" into the "Republic of Syria", introduce decentralized authorities as well as elements of federalism like "association areas", strengthen the parliament at the cost of the presidency, and realize [[Secularism in Syria|secularism]] by abolishing Islamic jurisprudence as a source of legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Syria Opposition Rejects Russian Draft of New Constitution|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-01-25/syria-opposition-rejects-russian-draft-of-new-constitution|publisher=Bloomberg|date=25 January 2017|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Syrian draft constitution recognizes Kurdish language, no mentions of federalism|url=http://www.rudaw.net/english/middleeast/syria/26012017|publisher=Rudaw|date=26 January 2017|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=رووداو تنشر مسودة الدستور السوري التي أعدها خبراء روس|url=http://www.rudaw.net/mobile/arabic/middleeast/syria/250120172|publisher=Rudaw|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Moscow invites Kurds and Syrian opposition to explain Astana|url=http://aranews.net/2017/01/moscow-invites-kurds-and-syrian-opposition-to-explain-astana/|publisher=[[ARA News]]|date=26 January 2017|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same month, [[United Kingdom]] [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[Boris Johnson]] said that "implementation of an [[Dayton Agreement|Dayton style]] accord in Syria and introduction of some form of a federal solution in Syria (...) may indeed be the right way forward or the only way forward in the end of all this."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UK Foreign Secretary says federalism best solution for Syria|url=http://aranews.net/2017/01/uk-foreign-secretary-says-federalism-best-solution-for-syria/|publisher=[[ARA News]]|date=27 January 2017|accessdate=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical antecedents==
[[File:French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon map en.svg|thumb|Map showing the states of the French Mandate from 1921 to 1922]]
During the [[French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon|French mandate]], Syria was subdivided into various autonomous entities, most of which bore the designation "[[Constituent state|state]]" (in French ''État''; in Arabic ''Dawlat''):
*the [[Alawite State|State of the Alawites]]
*the [[Al-Jazira Province|Province of Jazira]]
*the [[Jabal Druze State]] (originally called the State of Souaida)
*the [[State of Aleppo]]
*the [[State of Damascus]]
*the [[Greater Lebanon|State of Greater Lebanon]]
*the [[Hatay State|State of Hatay]] (originally called the [[Sanjak of Alexandretta]])
*the [[State of Syria (1924–30)|State of Syria]]

These autonomous entities did not correspond to the [[Administrative divisions of the Ottoman Empire|administrative division]] of [[Ottoman Syria]]. Two of these states, Hatay and Lebanon, were subsequently detached from Syrian territory.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6212">The '''Fur Rendezvous Festival''' (usually called '''Fur Rendezvous''', '''Fur Rondy''', or simply '''Rondy''') is an annual [[Winter Carnival|winter festival]] held in [[Anchorage, Alaska]] in late February. The self-styled "largest winter festival in North America", Fur Rendezvous is highly anticipated by many Anchorage-area residents as marking the beginning of the end of a long winter and the approach of spring. In 2012, Fur Rendezvous was selected as the number one winter carnival in the world by the National Geographic Traveler. &lt;ref&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20120421232245/http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/travel/winter-trips/winter-carnivals/ Winter Carnivals]", National Geographic Traveler, January/February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and Origins ==
The name "Fur Rendezvous" derives from [[Flea market|swap meet]]s at which [[Trapping (Animal)|fur trappers]] would gather to sell their winter harvests. In early Anchorage, these usually took place in mid-February.

In 1935, Anchorage had a population of only about 3,000 and was very isolated, so to bring the community together and lift [[Seasonal affective disorder|spirits]], resident Vern Johnson organized a three-day sports tournament, called the ''Winter Sports Carnival'', timed to coincide with the rendezvous, which brought increased activity. As the [[fur trade]] was then the second-largest industry in Alaska, folding it into the event seemed natural, and it was renamed the ''Winter Sports Tournament and Fur Rendezvous'' from 1937, and later just Fur Rendezvous.

It was common for miners and trappers to have beards in the early days, so a "law" was even made that all men had to grow beards for this event or suffer a fine!  This was considered to be part of the fun, because most men participated in it.

Fur Rendezvous was canceled during the [[World War II|war]] years, but resumed in 1946, when the festival began to draw visitors from [[Outside (Alaska)|Outside]], and has been held every year since. Since 1955 the event has been run by the non-profit '''Greater Anchorage, Inc.'''

Traditionally Fur Rendezvous lasted ten days, but since 2004 it has extended through early March, in order to lead into the [[Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race]] and draw more visitors.

== Events ==
The original Winter Sports Carnival included [[skiing]], [[hockey]], [[basketball]], [[boxing]], and a [[Dogsled racing|sled dog race]] for children, as well as a [[bonfire]] and torchlight [[parade]]. Modern Rondy has well over 100 events; some of the more significant include:
* Rondy Grand Prix - The Oldest Street Race in the U.S.
* Official Fur Rondy Fur [[Auction]] - the descendant of the original fur trade rendezvous, present since the earliest days.
* Miners' and Trappers' Charity Ball and [[Mr. Fur Face]] beard contest (since 1950) - Beards are grown as long as possible and they are dyed, decorated and shaped for this contest.
* [[World Championship Sled Dog Race]] (since 1946, with a women's race since 1953) -  This three-day, 75-mile [[sled dog race]] brings [[musher]]s from across Alaska and the world. However, it is sometimes canceled in recent years due to warm weather, with the most recent cancellation being in 2006.
* World Championship Dog Weight Pull (since 1967) - [[sled dogs]] attempt to pull the greatest weight
* Miss Fur Rendezvous [[beauty pageant|pageant]] (from at least late 1950s [https://books.google.com/books?um=1&amp;q=%22miss+fur+rendezvous%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books] through mid 1970s [http://consortiumlibrary.org/archives/CollectionsInv/GtoJ/GAIFURR.wpd.html]), also called Miss Fur Rondy
* [[Snow sculpture|Snow Sculpture]] Competition
* Fur Rondy [[Carnival]]
* Frostbite Footrace - [[Costume]]d competitors run through downtown Anchorage
* Rondy Grand Parade
* Running of the Reindeer - a whimsical annual event, started in 2008, that sends "herds" of people running down a four-block downtown street, with a group of reindeer released behind them, charging through the runners in a spoof of Pamplona's [[Running of the Bulls]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20170130062230/http://www.furrondy.net/events/running-reindeer Running of the Reindeer listing], official Fur Rondy website. Accessed 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rondy on Ice - [[figure skating]] show
* World [[ice bowling|Ice Bowling]] Championships

Many events tend toward the whimsical, such as the [[Outhouse]] Races (in which teams build outhouses and pull them on skis with a rider inside), [[ice bowling]], or even [[snowshoe]] [[softball]] matches. Others focus on [[Alaska Native]] culture, such as the Multi-Tribal Gathering and Native Arts and Crafts Show.

==Pins==
Since 1939, promotional [[pin]]s have been created and sold each year to raise money for the event. These pins have become popular collectibles, and older or rare pins can sell well in excess of $100. The Anchorage University [[Kiwanis Club]] sells pins and booster buttons dressed as Keystone Cops for the duration of the festival. During the parade the Keystone Cops, or "Rondy Kops," playfully detain attendees in a mobile jail until pins or buttons are purchased in exchange for their release.

'''Gerrards Cross Tunnel''' is a [[railway tunnel]] in [[Gerrards Cross]], [[Buckinghamshire]], on the [[Chiltern Main Line]]. The purpose of the tunnel was to enable a new [[Tesco]] supermarket to be built over the railway line. Plans were initially met with anger by local residents, and the council refused planning permission but this decision was overturned by [[John Prescott]].

During construction of the tunnel, it [[Structural failure|partially collapsed]] on 30 June 2005. No-one was injured in the accident, although a train heading towards the tunnel when it collapsed had to perform an emergency stop. Early reports suspected the cause was the backfilling operation; the [[Health and Safety Executive]] are yet{{when|date=May 2018}} to release their findings owing to legal issues.&lt;ref name="FOI 2017"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/375739/response/938345/attach/html/3/201702198%20Ben%20Kinglsey%20Whatdotheyknow.com%20Freedom%20of%20information%20response.DOCX.docx.html | title=Freedom of Information request Ref 201702198 | publisher=whatdotheyknow.com | date=15 February 2017 | accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the incident, the construction continued in 2007 with different contractors building the tunnel. The store opened in November 2010, fourteen years after the project was commissioned.

In July 1998, however, [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]] John Prescott overturned the council's ruling on the basis of the recommendations of an independent planning inspector. Due to a lack of space in the area, Tesco had proposed building over the railway line, which would free up a large area of land suitable for the development.&lt;ref name="guardian1" /&gt;

The work was let under a [[Design-build|design and build]] contract to Jackson Civil Engineering, who announced the store would be designed by White Young Green, and specialist supplier Reinforced Earth Company.&lt;ref name="nce4"&gt;{{Citation|last=Hansford|first=Mark|title=Tesco finally restarts work at Gerrards Cross tunnel collapse site | periodical =New Civil Engineer|url=http://www.nce.co.uk/tesco-finally-restarts-work-at-gerrards-cross-tunnel-collapse-site/1965393.article |publication-date=14 January 2009 |publisher=[[EMAP]] |accessdate=17 June 2009}} {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work started on site in early 2003.&lt;ref name="bucks1"&gt;{{Citation|last=Cain|first=Rebecca|title=Controversial Gerrards Cross Tesco store opened today|date=29 November 2010|accessdate=12 January 2011|publisher=[[Bucks Free Press]]|url=http://www.bucksfreepress.co.uk/news/8708434.Controversial_Tesco_store_opens_to_flood_of_shoppers/}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time Jackson Civil Engineering were part of the Peterhouse Group, which was subsequently bought by [[Babcock International Group]] in 2004, after the Jackson Civil Engineering division had been sold in a management buyout.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Reece|first=Damian|title=Babcock grows with £105m Peterhouse buy|date=23 March 2004|accessdate=12 January 2011|publisher=[[The Independent]]|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/babcock-grows-with-pound105m-peterhouse-buy-567294.html|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Management Buy Out |publisher=Jackson |accessdate=12 January 2011 |url=http://www.jackson-civils.co.uk/news/news_archive_MBO.htm }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Babcock were still subject to the parent company guarantee that Peterhouse Group had entered into when the contract to build the tunnel was let.&lt;ref name="babcock"&gt;{{Citation|title=Annual Report and Accounts 2009 |publisher=Babcock International Group PLC |page=31 |url=http://www.babcock.co.uk/uploads/financial/Babcock_AR2009.pdf |accessdate=12 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101212063124/http://babcock.co.uk/uploads/financial/Babcock_AR2009.pdf |archivedate=12 December 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design used [[precast concrete]] sections, each of which made up half of a [[three-pinned arch]]. These segments were connected to each other at the middle of the arch, and material then built back up over the arch, known as backfilling. The method of construction was not unique. "There are eight tunnels like this in Britain," said James Ford of [[Chiltern Railways]], "and something like a thousand worldwide."&lt;ref name="guardian1"/&gt; At the time of collapse, construction work on the tunnel segments had finished, and the backfilling operation was taking place.&lt;ref name="nce1"&gt;{{citation |last=Wynne|first=Alexandra|title=Cross purpose | periodical =New Civil Engineer|url=http://www.nce.co.uk/news/geotechnical/cross-purpose/1995578.article |publication-date=19 March 2009 |publisher=[[EMAP]] |accessdate=17 June 2009}} {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundations had been built and the steel frame of the supermarket erected.

==Service disruption==
Service was disrupted for two months after the collapse, until 22 August 2005, so material could be removed from site. The line was closed and [[Public transport bus service#Specialist services|rail replacement bus services]] were operated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Probe after Tesco tunnel collapses onto railway|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-354255/Probe-Tesco-tunnel-collapses-railway.html|accessdate=3 January 2011|newspaper=[[Daily Mail]]|date=1 July 2005|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 29 precast concrete segments that had collapsed were removed, together with another 16 segments that were damaged.&lt;ref name="nce1"/&gt; Extensive design checks were carried out to ensure that the sections of tunnel lining that had not collapsed were safe. 15,000 tonnes of material were removed from the area which had suffered the collapse, and 12,000 tonnes of backfill was removed from the undamaged sections.&lt;ref name="nce2"&gt;{{citation |title=No early opening for Tesco at Gerrards Cross| periodical =New Civil Engineer |url=http://www.nce.co.uk/no-early-opening-for-tesco-at-gerrards-cross/540465.article |publication-date=1 October 2005 |publisher=[[EMAP]] |accessdate=17 June 2009}} {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the railway line reopening, approval was not given to carry on with the work as originally proposed.

"The tunnel has collapsed. We've now got to assess today why that happened," said Robin Gisby, head of operations for Network Rail.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; "Experts are in there right now and they will work through the tunnel and decide what was the cause of the delay. Then we're going to make it safe, then we're going to work out how we're going to clear up the considerable problem we've got. There's a couple of thousand tonnes of material in there that we've got to move. We've got to get the concrete structure, that has collapsed, out. We've probably got to do all of that by road. Although we brought the material in by rail, we don't think we can get it out by rail, but we won't assess that until later on today and through the night. I think that's going to be at least a week's work, possibly longer, before we can restore rail services on this route. Passengers are being advised to travel via alternative routes and buses have also been ordered. We are currently putting arrangements in place to minimise disruption."&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

At the time of the accident, James Ford added that no further work would be carried out on the tunnel unless it had been certified as safe. "As to whether or not Tesco plans to continue building above the tunnel, we just don't know," he said. "What we do know is that there will be no further work, or anything that could have an effect on it, unless Network Rail and the HSE are satisfied that it's safe to do so. Network Rail will consult us if this situation arises. Tesco may, however, choose to continue work on parts of the supermarket project that are not directly connected to the tunnel."&lt;ref name="guardian1" /&gt;

==Investigation==
[[File:Denham Golf Club Station - geograph.org.uk - 89693.jpg|thumb|right|A train was forced to make an emergency stop after passing through [[Denham Golf Club railway station|Denham Golf Club]] – the last station before the tunnel]]
The initial investigations into the cause of collapse focused on the [[fill dirt|backfilling]] operation. The tunnel segments allowed for substantial vertical settlement during construction, and it was vital that the material was built up evenly on both sides and over the crown of the arch. Shortly after the incident, however, Gisby said that "something" about the backfilling "is not right." The chief executive of Jackson Civil Engineering, however, said that the process used was "in line with what the design allowed. There was a strict loading regime in place."&lt;ref name="nce4" /&gt; [[Geotechnical engineering|Geotechnical engineers]] commenting in the wake of the incident expressed surprise at the difference in fill levels on either side of the arch, and doubts were expressed that the backfilling had been in accordance with the method statement. "The collapse was probably due to too much load on the crown of the arch and not enough fill on the sides," the head of a specialist consulting firm said.&lt;ref name="nce4" /&gt;

"Units [appear to] have failed by creating a hinge in the concrete section. The hinge has rotated downwards, which is consistent with the crown of the arch moving downwards under excessive load and/or the sides of the arch moving outwards under too little lateral restraint. This problem would have been made worse if there was a significant difference in the level of the fill on the two sides. At the section that is still standing the central hinge has bent down indicating an imbalance between the vertical and horizontal loads and a failure by outward spreading of the arch."&lt;ref name="nce4" /&gt; He added that heavy rainfall, which had hit Gerrards Cross several days before the collapse, may have made the problem worse. "It is possible that rainfall increased the vertical load on the tunnel. At the same time, if the fill at the sides is not completely free draining, it could have led to a reduction in the passive pressure available from the fill on the sides."&lt;ref name="nce4" /&gt; Another construction specialist said: "You could trigger failure if you go straight from full depth fill over one section straight to no fill; that is, a section that's fully flexed next to one that's unflexed."&lt;ref name="nce4" /&gt;

The Health and Safety Executive launched an investigation into the collapse in 2005. Owing to the complex nature&lt;ref name="FOI 2010"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/gerrards_cross_tunnel_collapse_r#incoming-121179 | title=Freedom of Information request | publisher=whatdotheyknow.com | date=18 October 2010 | accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the probe, it remained open until 2015. A final report has been prepared, but has not yet been made public pending resolution of legal issues.&lt;ref name="FOI 2017" /&gt;

==Aftermath==
The incident brought protests from local residents and the council. The local [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[w:Member of Parliament (UK)|MP]], [[Dominic Grieve]], said: "If this particular disaster encourages Tesco to not go ahead with the scheme, everyone in Gerrards Cross will be absolutely delighted."&lt;ref name="guardian1" /&gt; Peter Hardy, the leader of South Bucks district council, added after the landslide that there would be "further years of disruption ... It would be better to abandon the project. I'm not against Tesco as such, but as a council, we want the inquiry into the collapse of the tunnel to be open and transparent. We want to know why such a hugely complex engineering process has been deemed necessary to build a relatively small new Tesco store. And we want something positive back from Tesco."&lt;ref name="guardian1" /&gt;

There were protests by local residents against the store. One protester said they were "fighting to get Tesco to tell us exactly why the tunnel collapsed, and to stop them from succeeding in winning further planning permission to continue work on the store." Some were less opposed to the store. "People here like to have a go at Tesco," an estate agent said. "I suppose most of us would have preferred a [[Marks &amp; Spencer]] food hall, but we'll all shop in Tesco anyway."&lt;ref name="guardian1" /&gt;

[[File:New Supermarket at Gerrards Cross - geograph.org.uk - 29078.jpg|thumb|An image showing the store being erected shortly after construction restarted. [[Tesco]] appointed a new team to continue the design and construction of the tunnel and store.]]

In 2006, Tesco appointed a new team to carry out the design and construction of the tunnel and store. [[Costain Group|Costain]] were assigned as main [[General contractor|contractor]] and [[Scott Wilson Group|Scott Wilson]] as lead designer.&lt;ref name="nce4" /&gt; In light of the collapse, a far more cautious approach was taken to the design. Precast concrete arch sections were used, but these simply act as formwork for a 600mm thick in-situ concrete continuous arch, a much more robust structure. To further reduce the loading on the tunnel, [[Piling#Piled walls|piled walls]] have been installed either side of the tunnel, and a lighter fill material&amp;mdash;including foamed concrete&amp;mdash;used over the top of the arch.&lt;ref name="nce1" /&gt;

The store opened in late November 2010,&lt;ref name=opened&gt;{{cite news|last=Abell|first=Jack|title=Tesco finally opens its doors|url=http://gerrardscross.buckinghamshireadvertiser.co.uk/2010/12/tesco-finally-opens-its-doors.html|accessdate=13 December 2010|date=3 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 5 years later than originally planned,&lt;ref name="guardian1" /&gt; and 14 years after the project started.&lt;ref name=opened/&gt; The store manager, Lizzie Field, said: "We are really pleased to support our local community at a time when so many people are looking for jobs, and there is so much competition between applicants. The quality of applicants was fantastic and my new team and I are already enjoying working together."&lt;ref name=opening/&gt; When the store opened, the ''[[Bucks Free Press]]'' reported that there was still opposition to the "controversial" store. The newspaper reported that "some have complained about dust coming from the site, as well as traffic delays while roadworks were carried out."&lt;ref name=opening/&gt; A local resident, who protested against the project since it was announced, said: "It's been very very frustrating. I won't be using the store and a lot of people in Gerrards Cross feel the same way. I think the traffic situation is going to be horrendous."&lt;ref name=opening&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.bucksfreepress.co.uk/news/8625371.Tesco_to_finally_open_after_14_year_controversy/| title = Tesco to finally open after 14 year controversy| publisher = ''[[Bucks Free Press]]''| accessdate = 8 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gestation crates 3.jpg|thumb|300px|Gestation crates, used on modern pig-production facilities, commonly referred to as [[Factory farming|factory farms]]]]
A '''gestation crate''', also known as a '''sow stall''', is a metal enclosure in which a [[pig farming|farmed]] [[domestic pig#Glossary of terms|sow]] used for breeding may be kept during pregnancy and after parturition in order to keep her piglets safe in a small space setting.&lt;ref name=Pond2011p151ff&gt;Wilson G.

Sow stalls contain no bedding material and are instead floored with slatted plastic, concrete or metal to allow waste to be efficiently collected below. This waste is then flushed into open-air pits known as [[Anaerobic lagoon|lagoons]].&lt;ref name=Kaufmann2&gt;Marc Kaufmann, [https://web.archive.org/web/20110724013229/http://www.pmac.net/AM/pigs_in_crates.html "In Pig Farming, Growing Concern, Raising Sows in Crates Is Questioned"], ''The Washington Post'', 18 June 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Tietz, [https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/boss-hog-the-dark-side-of-americas-top-pork-producer-20061214 "Boss Hog"], ''Rolling Stone'', 14 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; A few days before giving birth, sows are moved to farrowing crates where they are able to lie down, with an attached crate from which their piglets can nurse.

There were 5.36 million breeding sows in the United States as of 2016, out of a total of 50.1 million pigs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/usda/nass/HogsPigs//2000s/2007/HogsPigs-12-27-2007.pdf "U.S. Hog Inventory up 4 Percent"], ''Quarterly Hogs and Pigs'',  National Agricultural Statistics Service, 27 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Most pregnant sows in the US are kept in gestation crates.&lt;ref name=Pond2011p151ff/&gt; The crates are banned for new installations only in Canada, so many sows are still confined in Canadian pig breeding facilities.

==Usage==

===Pregnancy===
[[File:Gestation crate (Farm Sanctuary).jpg|thumb|Sows used for breeding in 6.6 ft &amp;times; 2.0 ft (2 m &amp;times; 60 cm) gestation crates]]

Between 60 and 70 percent of sows are kept in crates during pregnancy in the United States.&lt;ref name=Webster2&gt;J. Webster, ''Animal Welfare: A Cool Eye Towards Eden'', Oxford: Blackwell Science Ltd, cited in [https://web.archive.org/web/20060822182809/http://www.hsus.org/farm/resources/research/practices/gestation_crates.html#003 An HSUS Report: Welfare Issues with Gestation Crates for Pregnant Sows], Humane Society of the United States.&lt;/ref&gt; Each pregnancy lasts for three months, three weeks, and three days. Sows will have an average of 2.5 litters every year for two or three years, most of which is spent in the crates.&lt;ref name=Kaufmann2/&gt;&lt;ref name=SwineNews&gt;[http://mark.asci.ncsu.edu/Swine_News/2006/February/February06.pdf "Obtaining optimal reproductive efficiency"] (pdf), ''Swine News'', North Carolina State Cooperative Extension Service, February 2006, Volume 29, Number 1.&lt;/ref&gt; They give birth to between five and eight litters before being culled from the herd. Some older sows may reach a size at which they have to sleep on their chests, unable to lie on their sides as pigs usually do.&lt;ref name=Kaufmann1&gt;Marc Kaufmann, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/25/AR2007012501785.html "Largest Pork Processor to Phase Out Crates"], ''The Washington Post'', 26 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The floors are slatted to allow excrement and other waste to fall into a pit below.

===Birth{{anchor|farrowing}}===
[[File:Piglets Nursing in a Farrowing Crate.jpg|thumb|Nursing sow in a farrowing crate]]

A few days before giving birth, sows are moved to [[farrowing crates]], which are slightly wider so they can lie down to nurse.  Crates have 18-in. (46-cm) "troughs" on each side where the piglets can safely lie without being in danger of sow overlay (when the sow lies down on top of a piglet).

Piglet survival also depends on selection pressure.  Groups of piglets bred for higher survival showed no difference in mortality when weaned in farrowing crates and outdoor systems.&lt;ref&gt;E. M. Baxter, et al., "Breeding for improved pre-weaning piglet survival in alternative farrowing systems," Proceedings of the 41st congress of the International Society for Applied Ethology (F. Galindo and L. Alvarez, eds.), 2007, Merida, Mexico.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Piglet Mortality====
Although farrowing crates have been used based on the assumption that they reduce piglet mortality rates, there is little published evidence in support of this claim. The most comprehensive publication to date on this subject concluded that there is no significant effect of housing on overall piglet mortality, the authors stating that “Despite the fact that the crate system has been considered to reduce piglet mortality mainly through a reduction of crushing, there is not much scientific evidence for this when considering the few large surveys that compare the mortality rate in commercial herds“. The review goes on to describe several large studies dating from as early as 1983, the majority of which found no difference in piglet mortality rates between loose and crated sows. The review also details an argument as to why piglet mortality rates have been reported to be somewhat higher in a comparably small number of studies, citing methodological flaws.&lt;ref name=Pedersen&gt;L.J. Pedersen, http://www.wageningenacademic.com/doi/pdf/10.3920/978-90-8686-771-4_05 "Housing of sows during farrowing: a review on pen design,
welfare and productivity", retrieved January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations on usage==

=== European Union ===
In the European Union, the crates must not be used after the fourth week of pregnancy following a 2013 EU Directive. They are illegal at all times in the United Kingdom and Sweden.&lt;ref name="theguardian1"/&gt;

===New Zealand===
The use of gestation crates following mating will be phased out in New Zealand by 2015. However the crates are still legal for up to 4 weeks after farrowing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10691325|title=Sow crates to be phased out by 2015 - National - NZ Herald News|date=1 December 2010|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|publisher=NZPA|accessdate=1 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review lead by the Ministry for Primary Industries, in 2016, found that "The current code of welfare allows for up to 5% of sows to be retained in crates for a further week (following the 4 week maximum in crates post-farrowing) as nurse sows. This
practice enables slowly growing or poorly performing piglets to be properly weaned. It has
been noted that industry does not accept or comply with this requirement and some
producers are exceeding both the maximum 5% of sows allowed to be retained for this
purpose and the amount of time that they are being retained (i.e. greater than the one
week maximum as stated in the code)." And "The current code requires that sows in any farrowing system constructed after 3 December 2010, must be provided with material that can be manipulated until farrowing (to allow
the sow to perform nesting behaviour which she is extremely motivated to do). It has been
noted by NAWAC during this review that industry disagrees with this requirement and
does not comply with this minimum standard."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |url=http://www.mpi.govt.nz/document-vault/11959|title=NAWAC review of the use of Farrowing Crates for Pigs in New Zealand|date=14 March 2016|work=[[Ministry for Primary Industries (New Zealand)|Ministry for Primary Industries]]|publisher=MPI|accessdate=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corporate policies===
Over 60 major food companies have policies to eliminate their use.&lt;ref&gt;http://cratefreefuture.com/pdf/Gestation%20Crate%20Elimination%20Policies.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Smithfield Foods]], the largest pork producer in the United States, said in January 2007 that it will phase out gestation crates from its 187 piggeries over the next ten years because of concerns from its customers. In 2009 the company stated it would no longer be able to phase them out in ten years due to recent low sales,&lt;ref name=Kaufmann1/&gt; but reversed the decision in 2011 after intense pressure from the [[Humane Society of the United States]].&lt;ref name="smithfield_recommit"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hamptonroads.com/2011/12/smithfield-end-use-gestation-crates-2017|title=Smithfield to end use of gestation crates by 2017|author=Walzer, Philip|date=9 December 2012|accessdate=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012 [[McDonald's]] announced that it would begin working with suppliers to phase out the use of gestation crates in response to pressure from the Humane Society of the United States and other animal advocates. McDonald's purchases around one percent of all pork in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/14/business/mcdonalds-vows-to-help-end-use-of-sow-crates.html | work=The New York Times | first=Stephanie | last=Strom | title=McDonald's Vows to Help End Use of Sow Crates | date=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Welfare issues==
[[File:Gestation crates 5.jpg|thumb|Gestation crates 5|thumbnail|A [[Pig|sow]] will stay in a gestation crate for the four-month period of her pregnancy.]]
Animal welfare advocates regard the use of gestation crates as one of the most inhumane features of intensive animal production.&lt;ref name="Kaufmann1"/&gt; [[Temple Grandin]] of [[Colorado State University]]'s Department of Animal Science said in 2007: "... basically you’re asking a sow to live in an airline seat."&lt;ref name=Shapiro&gt;Shapiro, Paul. [http://www.globegazette.com/articles/2007/01/10/opinion/doc45a44853758c8203994884.txt Pork industry should phase out gestation crates (Guest View)], ''Globe Gazette'', 10 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pork producers argue that gestation crates are needed because sows that are housed together in pens will fight, injuring or killing their fellow penmates. The same effect could be achieved with larger pens that kept the animals separate, but allowed them more freedom of movement. There are also other ways of reducing, but not eliminating, aggression besides gestation crates. These include eliminating overcrowding, not mixing pigs from different litters, providing straw or other bedding material, and providing sufficient food that not only meets nutritional needs but satisfies the appetite.&lt;ref&gt;SA Weaver and MC Morris, "Science, pigs and politics: an New Zealand perspective on the phase-out of sow stalls," ''Journal of Agricultural and Environmental Ethics'' 17 (2003), 51–66.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other important means to reduce aggression among sows rely on alternative feeding methods, as many sows will compete with each other for food.  These include trickle feeding systems, individual feeding stalls, and electronic sow feeding equipment, all of which resolve feed competition among pigs.&lt;ref&gt;Gonyou HW. 2003. Group housing: alternative systems, alternative management. Advances in Pork Production 14:101-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early veterinary studies seemed to support the use of gestation crates. According to the [[U.S. National Pork Producers Council]], which promotes pork as a food product and is a leading proponent of gestation crates, the [[American Veterinary Medical Association]] "recognize[s] gestation stalls and group housing systems as appropriate for providing for the well-being of sows during pregnancy."&lt;ref name=Kaufmann1/&gt; While the practice of immobilizing the animals in crates limits fighting, it subsequently increases the animals' stress levels, causing other health problems. The American Association of Swine Veterinarians adopted a position statement in 2002 specifying five standards of sow welfare and concluding, "Current scientific literature indicates that individual gestation stalls meet each of the aforementioned, provided the appropriate level of stockmanship is administered."&lt;ref&gt;"AASV Position Statement: Pregnant Sow Housing." Accessed 31 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Washington Post'' reported in 2001 that researchers have not found sows in gestation crates to have elevated levels of [[stress hormone]]s. The paper notes that this suggests their overall health is not compromised. Some producers in Europe use a “free access” maternity pen configuration in which sows are in individual pens for the first four weeks of pregnancy but can “unlock” the stall by backing out and entering a common area. The producers observed that pregnant pigs will stay in the individual pens more than 90 percent of the time, and return to the same stall more than 90 percent of the time.&lt;ref name="Salek-Johnson"&gt;{{cite news|last=Salek-Johnson|first=Janeen|title=Individual pens for sows’ safety|url=http://thegazette.com/2012/09/30/individual-pens-for-sows-safety/|accessdate=10 January 2014|newspaper=[[The Gazette (Cedar Rapids)|The Gazette]]|date=30 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

However, other veterinary studies contradict those earlier studies. A 1997 report of the Scientific Veterinary Committee of the European Union, where a gestation crate ban went into effect in 2013, noted that because "overall welfare appears to be better when sows are not confined throughout gestation, sows should be preferably be kept in groups."&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"&gt;Tim Carman, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/food/pork-industry-gives-sows-room-to-move/2012/05/25/gJQAISlxyU_story.html "Pork industry gives sows room to move"], ''The Washington Post'', 29 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise in 2008, the Pew Commission on Industrial Farm Animal Production, after 2.5 years of research, recommended "the phase-out, within 10 years, of all intensive confinement systems that restrict natural movement and normal behaviors, including swine gestation crates."&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt;

Many studies have shown that sows in crates exhibit behavior such as bar-biting, head weaving, and tongue rolling, indicating chronic frustration. Sows in crates bite the bars, chew even when they have no food, and press their water bottles obsessively, all reportedly signs of boredom. The ''Post''(uncited reference) writes that a report by veterinarians for the [[European Union]] concluded that abnormal behavior in sows "develop[s] when the animal is severely or chronically frustrated. Hence their development indicates that the animal is having difficulty in coping and its welfare is poor."&lt;ref name=Kaufmann2/&gt; This behavior, such as bar-biting and other stereotypic behavior can also lead to other physical trauma, such as sores from frequent contact with the metal bars, and mouth sores from sham-chewing and bar-biting.&lt;ref&gt;Mendl MT. 1991. The effects of alternative forms of intensive pig husbandry on measures of pig welfare. In: Bradley A and Sckofield WL (eds.), Proceedings of the First Association of Veterinary Students Animal Welfare Symposium (Cambridge, U.K.: Association of Veterinary Students).&lt;/ref&gt; They also show behavior that indicates [[learned helplessness]], according to Morris, such as remaining passive when poked or when a bucket of water is thrown over them.&lt;ref name=Morris&gt;Morris, Michael C. [http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~nezumi1/sowstalls.html "Sow stalls and farrowing crates – ethically, scientifically and economically indefensible"], ''[[Organic New Zealand]]'', 62, no. 1, Jan/Feb 2003, 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt;  A review by the Scientific Veterinary Council of the [[European Commission]] states that repetitive "[[Stereotypy (non-human)|stereotypical]]" behavior has been found in "every detailed study" of pigs in gestation crates, but not in any other housing systems examined.&lt;ref name="svc"&gt;SVC (Scientific Veterinary Committee) (1997).  The welfare of intensively kept pigs.  Commission of the European Communities, Directorate-General for Agriculture, Brussels.[http://ec.europa.eu/food/fs/sc/oldcomm4/out17_en.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt; A 2004 literature review by animal scientists determined that sows in stalls exhibited more "stereotypical" behavior than sows in group housing, but that animals housed in stalls had lower injury rates and higher farrowing rates.&lt;ref&gt;McGlone, J.J. et al. "Compilation of the Scientific Literature Comparing Housing Systems for Gestating Sows and Gilts Using Measures of Physiology, Behavior, Performance, and Health," Professional Animal Scientist April 2004 vol. 20 no. 2 105-117.&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies have shown that "sow behavior has been shown to differ among housing systems; often it seems to be the non-housing component (i.e., direction of bar, other substances present) of the system that is responsible for the behavior displayed by the sow."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Salak-Johnson|first=Janeen|title=The Reality of Sow Stalls|url=http://www.pork.org/filelibrary/SowHousing/2007SowHousingForum/Proceedings/JaneenJohnson.pdf|accessdate=10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other health related issues are to be found among pigs confined within gestation crates as opposed to group housing systems.  Some of these include urinary tract infections, respiratory disease,&lt;ref name=Tillon1&gt;Tillon JP and Madec F. 1984 [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/16708998_Diseases_affecting_confined_sows._Data_from_epidemiological_observationsTillon "Diseases affecting confined sows: data from epidemiological observations"].

According to John Webster, head of the Veterinary School at [[Bristol University]] in the United Kingdom, "Sows on concrete in confinement stalls suffer abuse according to all the Five Freedoms." These include freedom from hunger, discomfort, pain, distress, and freedom to express normal behavior.&lt;ref name=Webster1&gt;Webster J. 2005. [http://103.9.88.89/app/2014-06-22/Animal%20Welfare%20%20Limping%20Towards%20Eden%20John%20Webster%20(UFAW%20Animal%20Welfare)%20(2005).pdf "Animal Welfare: Limping Towards Eden"] (Oxford, U.K.: Blackwell Publishing, pp. 12, 116).&lt;/ref&gt;  Sows that have to lay on concrete flooring can experience excessive heat loss and chronic physical discomfort,&lt;ref name=Webster1/&gt; while this same concrete flooring can contribute to foot injuries,&lt;ref name=Kornegay1/&gt; joint pain complications,&lt;ref name=Fredeen1/&gt; and skin lesions &lt;ref name=Webster2/&gt; - due to the pigs prolonged contact with an unusually hard surface and chronic inactivity.&lt;ref&gt;Webster J. 2005.

Poor cardiovascular health, bone density issues, and poor muscle health all have been attributed to lack of exercise.&lt;ref name=Marchant1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Commission1/&gt;  The decreased amount of muscle mass  makes even simple movements difficult,&lt;ref&gt;Marchant JN, Broom DM. 1993. The effects of dry sow housing conditions on lying behaviour of sows. [In] Nichelmann M, Wierenga HK, Braun S, editors. ''Proceedings of the [[International Congress on Applied Ethology]]''; Darmstadt: KTBL; p 455-58.&lt;/ref&gt; while  one study found that crated sows had two thirds the bone density of non-crated sows, with researchers concluding that weakened bones led to a higher incidence of broken bones or injuries&lt;ref name=Marchant1/&gt; and another study finding that a common factor in mortality cases was leg weakness.&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, G., Vraa-Anderson, L. and Mousing, J. (1995) Causes of mortality among sows in Danish pig herds. ''[[Veterinary Record]]'', 137: 395-399&lt;/ref&gt;  The lameness contributed to these weakened bones is also in part due to the hardness of the concrete flooring, which inevitably leads to a higher incidence of injuries to the feet and or legs,&lt;ref name=Sather1&gt;Sather AP and Fredeen HT. 1982. "The effect of confinement housing upon the incidence of leg weakness in swine". ''Canadian Journal of Animal Science'' 62:1119-28.

Sows flourish in pen gestation. ''National Hog Farmer'', 15 March.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stalder K and Baas T. 2005. Screen gilts for feet and leg disorders. ''National Hog Farmer'', 15 February.&lt;/ref&gt;  This same flooring is thought to contribute to toe lesions,&lt;ref name=Kornegay1/&gt; with some reports claiming that up to 80% of crated sows suffer from this illness.&lt;ref name=Tillon1/&gt;  Due to lack of exercise, sows may develop a number of additional physical conditions that compromise their overall well-being.  Urinary tract infections may develop as a result of the pigs immobility, which causes them to drink less frequently and consequently develop bacteria within the urinary tract.&lt;ref name=Tillon1/&gt;  Though this same illness is contributed to the fact that sows are forced to lie, or sit, in their own feces&lt;ref name=Sather1/&gt; - another reason some think there is a higher incidence of respiratory disease among sows confined in gestation crates.&lt;ref name=Tillon1/&gt;

In a symposium held in 2002 on swine housing and well being, Edmond A. Pajor, Associate Professor at [[Purdue University]], told the audience that "In gestation stalls, sows are prevented from performing many of the behavior patterns that pigs would perform in more natural or less restricted conditions resulting in a negative impact on sow welfare."&lt;ref&gt;Pajor EA. 2002. Group housing of sows in small pens: advantages, disadvantages and recent research. In: Reynells R (ed.), Symposium on Swine Housing and Well-being (Beltsville, MD: [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]], pp. 37-44). www.ces.purdue.edu/pork/sowhousing/swine_02.pdf. Accessed 19 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Sundberg, a veterinarian and vice president of the U.S. National Pork Board, a leading proponent of gestation crates, told ''[[The Washington Post]]'': "Farmers treat their animals well because that's just good business. The key to sow welfare isn't whether they are kept in individual crates or group housing, but whether the system used is well managed." Sundberg said: "[S]cience tells us that she [a sow] doesn't even seem to know that she can't turn ... She wants to eat and feel safe, and she can do that very well in individual stalls."&lt;ref name=Kaufmann2/&gt;

{{russianterm
| russian = гла́сность
| rusr = glasnost'
| literal meaning = publicity
}}
In the [[Russian language]] the word '''''Glasnost''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|g|l|æ|z|n|ɒ|s|t}}; {{lang-ru|гла́сность}}, {{IPA-ru|ˈɡɫasnəsʲtʲ|IPA|ru-glasnost.ogg}}) has several general and specific meanings. It has been used in Russian to mean "openness and transparency" since at least the end of the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |language=Russian |title=Словарь Академии Российской. Часть II |year=1790 |publisher= Императорская Академия Наук|location= СПб.|page= 72|url=http://www.runivers.ru/bookreader/book10108/#page/100/mode/1up |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the [[Russian Empire]] of the late-19th century, the term was particularly associated with reforms of the judicial system, ensuring that the press and the public could attend court hearings and that the sentence was read out in public. In the mid-1980s, it was popularised by [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] as a political slogan for increased government transparency in the [[Soviet Union]].

==Historical usage==
"For centuries", [[human rights]] activist [[Lyudmila Alexeyeva]] has explained, the word ''glasnost'' has been in the Russian language: "It was in the dictionaries and lawbooks as long as there had been dictionaries and lawbooks. It was an ordinary, hardworking, non-descript word that was used to refer to a process, any process of justice or governance, being conducted in the open."&lt;ref&gt;Alexeyeva, Lyudmila and Paul Goldberg ''The Thaw Generation: Coming of Age in the Post-Stalin Era'', Pennsylvania: University of Pittsburgh Press, 1990, pp. 108-109.&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1960s, however, as Alexeyeva recounts, it acquired a new and topical importance.

==Glasnost in the USSR==
===Glasnost and the dissidents===
On 5 December 1965, a key event in the emergence of the Soviet civil rights movement, often known as the [[Glasnost meeting| Glasnost rally]], took place in Moscow when protesters on Pushkin Square led by [[Alexander Yesenin-Volpin]] demanded access to the closed trial of [[Yuli Daniel| Yuly Daniel]] and [[Andrei Sinyavsky]]. They specifically asked for "glasnost", i.e. the admission of the public, independent observers and foreign journalists, to the trial, something that was required in the newly issued, but not widely available, Code of Criminal Procedure. With a few specified exceptions, Article 111 of the Code stated that judicial hearings in the USSR should be held in public.

Such protests against closed trials continued throughout the post-Stalin era. [[Andrei Sakharov]], famously, did not travel to Oslo to receive his [[Nobel Peace Prize]] because he was standing outside a court building in Vilnius (Lithuania), demanding access to the 1976 trial of [[Sergei Kovalev]], an editor of the ''[[Chronicle of Current Events]]'' and prominent rights activist.&lt;ref&gt;https://chronicleofcurrentevents.net/2016/03/07/38-2-before-the-trials-of-kovalyov-and-tverdokhlebov/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Glasnost and Gorbachev===
In 1986, aware of the term's historical and more recent resonance, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and his advisers adopted "glasnost" as a political slogan, together with the obscure "[[perestroika]]".

Glasnost was taken to mean increased openness and [[Transparency (social)|transparency]] in government institutions and activities in the [[Soviet Union]] (USSR).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = | first = | authorlink = | title = Milestones in Glasnost and Perestroyka: Politics and People | publisher = Brookings Institution Press | year = 1991 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-8157-3623-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Glasnost'' apparently reflected a commitment to getting Soviet citizens to discuss publicly the problems of their system and seek solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/907585907|title=The world transformed : 1945 to the present|last=H.|first=Hunt, Michael|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780199371020|location=|pages=315|oclc=907585907}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gorbachev encouraged popular scrutiny and criticism of leaders, as well as a certain level of exposure by the mass media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/907585907|title=The world transformed : 1945 to the present|last=H.|first=Hunt, Michael|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780199371020|location=|pages=316|oclc=907585907}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics, especially among legal reformers and dissidents, regarded the Soviet authorities' new slogans as vague and limited alternatives to more basic liberties. 

Alexei Simonov, president of the Glasnost Defence Foundation, would define the term as follows: "Glasnost is a tortoise crawling towards Freedom of Speech".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gdf.ru&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Various meanings of Gorbachev's "glasnost"====
Between 1986 and 1991, when the USSR attempted and failed to reform itself, glasnost was frequently linked with other generalised concepts such as [[perestroika]] (literally: restructuring or regrouping) and [[Demokratizatsiya (Soviet Union)|demokratizatsiya]] (democratisation). Gorbachev often appealed to glasnost when promoting policies aimed at reducing corruption at the top of the Communist Party and the Soviet government, and moderating the abuse of administrative power in the [[Central Committee]].

The ambiguity of "glasnost" defines the distinctive five-year period (1986–1991) at the end of the USSR's existence. There was decreasing pre-publication and pre-broadcast [[censorship]] and greater [[freedom of information]].

The "Era of Glasnost" saw greater contact between Soviet citizens and the Western world, particularly the [[United States]]: restrictions on travel were loosened for many, allowing increased business and cultural interchange{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}.

====International Relations under Glasnost====
Gorbachev's interpretation of "glasnost" can best be summarized, translated, and explained in English as "openness". While associated with [[freedom of speech]], the main goal of this policy was to make the country's management transparent, and circumvent the narrow circle of bureaucrats who previously exercised complete control of the economy. 

Soviet history under Stalin was re-examined; censored literature in the libraries was made more widely available;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ib.hu-berlin.de/~pbruhn/glasnost.htm Glasnost] im sowjetischen Bibliothekswesen (by Peter Bruhn)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;А.П. Шикман: ''Совершенно несекретно'' in: Советская библиография, 1988,6 (231), P.3-12&lt;/ref&gt; and there was a greater freedom of speech for citizens and openness in the media.

Propaganda about the supposedly higher quality of consumer goods and quality of life in the [[United States]] and [[Western Europe]] began to be transmitted to the Soviet population,&lt;ref name="ScottChapter8"&gt;{{cite book|title=Dismantling Utopia: How Information Ended the Soviet Union|last=Shane|first=Scott|publisher=Ivan R. Dee|year=1994|isbn=1-56663-048-7|location=Chicago|pages=212 to 244|chapter=Letting Go of the Leninist Faith|quote=All this degradation and hypocrisy is laid not just at the feet of Stalin but of Lenin and the Revolution that made his rule possible.}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with western [[popular culture]].&lt;ref name="ScottChapter7"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shane|first=Scott|title=Dismantling Utopia: How Information Ended the Soviet Union|year=1994|publisher=Ivan R. Dee|location=Chicago|isbn=1-56663-048-7|pages=182 to 211|chapter=A Normal Country: The Pop Culture Explosion|quote=...market forces had taken over publishing...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Glasnost in Russia since 1991==

The outright prohibition of censorship was enshrined in Article 29 of the new 1993 Constitution of the Russian Federation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.constitution.ru/search/index.html?cx=partner-pub-7056500280970989%3A2czdvm-pse9&amp;cof=FORID%3A10&amp;ie=windows-1251&amp;q=censorship&amp;sa.x=0&amp;sa.y=0 Constitution of the Russian Federation, 1993, Article 29, point 5]&lt;/ref&gt; This did not end attempts by officials to restrict access to information in post-Soviet Russia or pressure by the authorities on media outlets not to publicise or discuss certain events or subjects. Monitoring of the infringement of media rights in the years from 2004 to 2013 would find that instances of censorship were the most commonly reported type of violation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mediaconflictsinrussia.org/search ''Russia - Conflicts in the Media since 2004, a database. Censorship.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

There were also periodic concerns about the extent of glasnost in court proceedings, as restrictions were placed on access to certain cases for the media and for the public

'''Goose pulling''' (also called '''gander pulling''', '''goose riding''', '''pulling the goose''' or '''goose neck tearing'''&lt;ref name="brooke-hitching"&gt;Edward Brooke-Hitching. ''Fox Tossing, Octopus Wrestling, and Other Forgotten Sports'', p.102. Simon and Schuster, 2015. {{ISBN|978-1-4711-4899-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[blood sport]] practiced in parts of the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], [[England]], and [[North America]] from the 17th to the 19th centuries. It originated in the 12th century in [[Spain]] and was spread around Europe by the [[Tercio | Spanish Third]]. The sport involved fastening a live goose with a well-greased head to a rope or pole that was stretched across a road. A man riding on horseback at a full gallop would attempt to grab the bird by the neck in order to pull the head off.&lt;ref name="Bird"&gt;"Dutch".

Greenwood Publishing Group, 2000. {{ISBN|978-0-313-29911-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes a live hare was substituted.&lt;ref name="Vickers"&gt;{{cite book|last=Vickers|first=Anita|title=The new nation|page=147|year=2002|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-31264-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is still practiced today, using a dead goose, in parts of Belgium and in [[Grevenbicht]] in the Netherlands&lt;ref name="ganstrekken"&gt;{{cite news|title=Dierenpartij wil komaf maken met ganstrekken|url=http://demorgen.be/dm/nl/990/Buitenland/article/detail/176081/2008/02/18/Dierenpartij-wil-komaf-maken-met-ganstrekken.dhtml|work=De Morgen Buitenland|date=2008-02-18|accessdate=2010-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of [[Shrove Tuesday]] and in some towns in Germany as part of the [[Shrove Monday]] celebrations. It is referred to as ''Ganstrekken'' in the Netherlands, ''Gansrijden'' in Belgium and ''Gänsereiten'' in Germany using a dead goose that has been humanely killed by a veterinarian.

==The practice==

=== Spain ===

In [[El Carpio de Tajo]] goose pulling is practised on every July 25th to celebrate the liberation ([[Reconquista]]) from the Arabs in 1141.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eickenscheidt-nienhausen.de/300/archiv/14_9.pdf Artikel zum Gänsereiten].&lt;/ref&gt; Later, during the [[Francoist Spain|dictatorship of Franco]], the use of live geese was prohibited by a new animal protection law. Instead of geese, ribbons tied to sticks were used, which the riders had to insert into metal rings. When democracy returned to Spain, the use of geese was again allowed. 

=== Netherlands ===

Goose pulling is attested in the Netherlands as early as the start of the 17th century; the poet [[Gerbrand Adriaensz Bredero]] referred to it in his 1622 poem ''Boerengeselschap'' ("Company of Peasants"), describing how a party of peasants going to a goose-pulling contest near Amsterdam end up in a brutal brawl, leading to the lesson that it is best for townspeople to stay away from peasant pleasures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dutch literature in the age of Rembrandt: themes and ideas|last=Schenkeveld|first=Maria A|page=80|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|year=1991|isbn=978-90-272-2216-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the use of live geese was banned in the 1920s, the practice still arouses some controversy. In 2008 the Dutch [[Party for Animals]] (PvdD) proposed that it should be banned; the organisers, Folk Verein Gawstrèkkers Beeg, rejected the proposal, pointing out that there was no question of cruelty to animals because the geese were already dead.&lt;ref name="ganstrekken" /&gt;

=== Belgium ===

Belgian goose pulling is accompanied by an elaborate set of customs. The rider who succeeds in pulling off the goose's head is "crowned" as the "king" for one year and given a crown and mantle. At the end of his "king year" the ruling king has to treat his "subjects" to a feast of beer, drinks, cigars and bread pudding or sausages held either at his home or at a local pub. The kings compete with each other to become the "emperor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Het abc van het gansrijden |url=http://www.nieuwsblad.be/article/detail.aspx?articleid=GP2M7ASP |work=het Nieuwsblad |date=2010-02-13 |accessdate=2010-05-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611190716/http://www.nieuwsblad.be/article/detail.aspx?articleid=GP2M7ASP |archivedate=2011-06-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Children participate as well; in 2008, the children's goose pulling tournament in [[Lillo, Antwerp|Lillo]] near [[Antwerp]] was won by a 14-year-old who won 390 euros and a trip to the [[Plopsaland De Panne|Plopsaland]] theme park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Michaël (14) wint gansrijden voor kinderen |url=http://www.nieuwsblad.be/Article/Detail.aspx?ArticleID=HD1UVEJ5_2 |work=het Nieuwsblad |date=2008-08-05 |accessdate=2010-05-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611190844/http://www.nieuwsblad.be/Article/Detail.aspx?ArticleID=HD1UVEJ5_2 |archivedate=2011-06-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Germany ===

In [[Wattenscheid]] it is believed that the custom was brought by Spanish soldiers who were stationed in 1598 and 1599 during the [[Eighty Years' War]] and later in the [[Thirty Years' War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.donews.de/oldstuff/Archiv/G/Gansereiter/gansereiter.html so Bochum's Stadtarchivar ''Eduard Schulte'' in his study from 6 February 1925, cited by donews.de – Karneval mit den Gänsereitern]&lt;/ref&gt;

In some other places of Germany it was forbidden. In [[Dortmund]] and [[Essen]] rattraps are used.

=== United Kingdom ===

The sport appears to have been relatively uncommon in Britain, as all references are to it as a curiosity practiced somewhere else. The 1771 Philip Parsons locates it in "Northern parts of England" and assumes it is unknown in [[Newmarket, Suffolk|Newmarket]] in Southern England. Parsons described how it was carried out in England:

{{quote|In the Northern parts of England it is no unusual diversion, to tie a rope across a street, and let it swing about the distance of ten yards&lt;!--30 feet??--&gt; from the ground. To the middle of this a living cock is tied by the legs. As he swings in the air, a set of young people ride one after another, full speed, under the rope, and rising in the stirrups, catch at the animal's head, which is close clipped and well soaped, in order to elude the grasp. Now he who is able to keep his seat in his saddle, and his hold of the bird's head, so as to carry it off in his hand, bears away the palm, and becomes the noble hero of the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Parsons|first=Philip|title=Newmarket: or, An essay on the turf|publisher=R. Baldwin and J. Dodsley|year=1771|pages=174–5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7kBAAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22essay%20on%20the%20turf%22%201771&amp;pg=PA174#v=onepage&amp;q=%22essay%20on%20the%20turf%22%201771&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a satirical letter to ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' in 1845 it is regarded as a barbarous practice known only to the bloodthirsty Spaniards, like [[bull-fighting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wyEIAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA121&amp;dq=goose+pulling+England&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=cpLhS57qC835-AbP69jwDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CGIQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=goose%20pulling%20England&amp;f=false|title=Sports for Queens|work=Punch|date=1845|volume=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The serious work ''Observations on the popular antiquities of Great Britain'', of 1849, calls it "Goose-riding" and says it has been "practiced in [[Derbyshire]] within the memory of persons now living", and that the [[antiquary]] [[Francis Douce]] (1757–1834) had a friend who remembered it "when young" in [[Edinburgh]] in [[Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Observations on the popular antiquities of Great Britain: chiefly illustrating the origin of our vulgar and provincial customs, ceremonies, and superstitions, Volume 2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rDcFAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA419&amp;dq=goose+pulling+England&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=1I7hS_iAEILK-Qbw8tj1Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|author1=Brand, John|author2=Ellis, Sir Henry|author3=Halliwell-Phillipps, James Orchard|publisher=Bohn|location=London|year=1849}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

From these references it would appear to have died out in Britain by the end of the 18th century.

=== United States ===

The Dutch settlers of North America brought it to their colony of [[New Netherland]] and from there it was transmitted to English-speaking Americans. Goose-pulling was taken up by those at the lower levels in American society,&lt;ref name="Vickers" /&gt; though it could attract the interest of all social strata. In the pre-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] South, slaves and whites competed alongside each other in goose-pulling contests watched by "all who walk in the fashionable circles."&lt;ref name="Parsons"&gt;{{cite book|last=Parsons|first=Charles Grandison|title=Inside view of slavery: or A tour among the planters|pages=136–7|publisher=John P. Jewett and Co|year=1855}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Grandison Parsons described the course of one such contest held in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]] in the 1850s:

{{quote|At the appointed time, rude whisky tents, and festive seats, and shades, were prepared around the "pulling course;" and thousands of spectators – ladies as well as gentlemen, the elite as well as the vulgar – assembled to engage in or witness the favorite sport...

Tickets were issued by the proprietor of the gander, at fifty cents each, to all gentlemen present who wished for them, and they entered their names as "pullers". The pullers were to start about ten rods [about 50 m / 165 ft] from the gander, on horseback, riding at full speed, and as they passed along under the gander, they had the privilege of pulling off his head – which would entitle them to the additional privilege of eating him...

One entered the list – a "gentleman of property and standing" – and dashed over the course. The poor gander – seeming quite resigned to his fate, or not comprehending his danger, and not knowing how to "dodge" – had his neck seized by the first rider; but being well oiled, and his head so small, and his strength not yet exhausted, he slipped his head through the puller's hand without suffering much from the twist... After this he kept a sharp look out, and many pullers passed by without being able to grapple his neck. The game went on, and the pullers increased, till the jaded gander could elude their grasp no longer. An old Cracker – with a sandpaper glove on – pulled off his head at last, amid the shouts of a wondering host of intoxicated competitors.&lt;ref name="Parsons" /&gt;}}

The prizes of a goose-pulling contest were trivial – often the dead bird itself, other times contributions from the audience or rounds of drinks. The main draw of such contests for the spectators was the betting on the competitors, sometimes for money or more often for alcoholic drinks.&lt;ref name="Vickers" /&gt; One contemporary observer commented that "the whoopin', and hollerin', and screamin', and bettin', and excitement, beats all; there ain't hardly no sport equal to it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bartlett|first=John Russell|title=Dictionary of Americanisms: A glossary of words and phrases usually regarded as peculiar to the United States|pages=166–7|publisher=Little, Brown, and Company|year=1859}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goose-pulling contests were often held on [[Shrove Tuesday]] and [[Easter Monday]], with competitors "engaged in this sport not just for its excitement but also to prove they were "real men," physically strong, brave, competitive and willing to take risks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pleck|first=Elizabeth Hafkin|title=Celebrating the family: ethnicity, consumer culture, and family rituals|page=76|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2000|isbn=978-0-674-00279-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike some other contemporary blood sports, goose pulling was often frowned upon. In [[New Amsterdam]] (modern [[New York (state)|New York]]) in 1656, [[Director-General of New Netherland|Director General]] [[Pieter Stuyvesant]] issued ordinances against goose pulling, calling it "unprofitable, heathenish and pernicious."&lt;ref name="Bird" /&gt; Many contemporary writers professed disgust at the sport; an anonymous reviewer in the ''[[Southern Literary Messenger]]'', writing in 1836, described goose pulling as "a piece of unprincipled barbarity not infrequently practised in the South and West."&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous, review of ''Georgia Scenes''. ''Southern Literary Messenger'', p. 289, vol. II, no. 4. March 1836&lt;/ref&gt; William Gilmore Simms described it as "one of those sports which a cunning devil has contrived to gratify a human beast. It appeals to his skill, his agility, and strength; and is therefore in some degree grateful to his pride; but, as it exercises these qualities at the expense of his humanity, it is only a medium by which his better qualities are employed as agents for his worser nature."&lt;ref name="Simms" /&gt;

The sport was challenging, as the oiling of the goose's neck made it difficult to retain a grip on it, and the bird's flailing made it difficult to target in the first place. Sometimes the organisers would add an extra element of difficulty; one writer describing an event in the American South witnessed "a nigger, with a long whip in hand ... stationed on a stump, about two rods [10 m / 32 ft] from the gander, with orders to strike the horse of the puller as he passed by."&lt;ref&gt;p. 157. INSIDE VIEW OF SLAVERY: OR A TOUR AMONG THE PLANTERS, by C.G. PARSONS, 1855.&lt;/ref&gt; The reaction of the startled horse would make it even more difficult for the puller to grab the goose as he went by. Many riders missed altogether; others broke the goose's neck without snapping off the head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Forret|first=Jeff|title=Race relations at the margins: slaves and poor whites in the antebellum Southern countryside|page=62|publisher=LSU Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0-8071-3145-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American poet and novelist [[William Gilmore Simms]] wrote that

{{quote|It is only the experienced horseman, and the experienced sportsman, who can possibly succeed in the endeavor. Young beginners, who look on the achievement as rather easy, are constantly baffled; many find it impossible to keep the track; many lose the saddle, and even where they succeed in passing beneath the saplings without disaster, they either fail altogether in grasping the goose, which keeps a constant fluttering and screaming; or, they find it impossible to retain their grasp, at full speed, upon the greasy and eel-like neck and head which they have seized.&lt;ref name="Simms"&gt;{{cite book|title=As good as a comedy: or, The Tennesseean's story|last=Simms|first=William Gilmore|page=115|publisher=A. Hart|year=1852}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Goose-pulling largely died out in the United States after the Civil War, though it was still occasionally practised in parts of the South as late as the 1870s; a local newspaper in [[Osceola, Arkansas]] reported of an 1870s picnic that "after eats, gander-pulling was engaged in. Mr. W.P. Hale succeeded in pulling in twain the gander's breathing apparatus, after which dancing was resumed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cochran|first=Robert|title=Our own sweet sounds: a celebration of popular music in Arkansas|page=17|year=2005|publisher=University of Arkansas Press|isbn=978-1-55728-793-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variant called "rooster pulling" has survived in [[New Mexico]] for some time. A rooster was buried in the sand up to its neck, and riders would try to pull it up as they rode past. This was later done with bottles buried in the sand. "Rooster racing in the Hispanic villages of northern New Mexico exists only in the history books and in the minds of a few men and women who ... still recall the popular sport of yesteryear".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=94|last=Garcia|first=Nasario|title=Grandma's Santo on Its Head: Stories of Days Gone By in Hispanic Villages of New Mexico|year=2013|location=Albuquerque|publisher=University of New Mexico Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Great Stockholm Fire of 1625''' was among the first known large scale fires in Stockholm prior to the city plan changes of the 17th-century. The fire began in the evening of September 1, 1625 in [[Kåkbrinken]], and devastated the southwestern parts of [[Stadsholmen]]. It lasted three days and reportedly destroyed a fifth of the [[infrastructure]] of Stockholm at the time. The fire resulted in the building of a new city over the burnt areas, and a new tightened organisation of inspection of the fire prevention measures in the city.

'''Grimeborn''' is an annual [[East London]] [[musical theatre]] and [[opera festival]] which coincides with the world famous [[East Sussex]] [[Glyndebourne Opera Festival]].  Founded by Arcola Theatre’s artistic director [[Mehmet Ergen]] in 2007, the festival is held at [[Arcola Theatre]] in Dalston, East London. It takes place in and around August, and is considered a dynamic alternative to the traditional "summer season".{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

==History==
The festival's name is a [[punning]] reference to Glyndebourne, as it deliberately supports emerging performers and writers, rather than the polished, prestigious output of Glyndebourne. The "grime" comes from it having a "dirtier" backdrop in a converted textile factory in the congested bustle of [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]] as opposed to the scenic gardens of [[East Sussex]]. The festival showcases new and experimental works. Many{{Who|date=August 2010}} see Grimeborn as the fashionable alternative to Glyndebourne, due to its E8 location.

Originally devised as a contemporary contribution to the [[Battersea Arts Centre]]'s (BAC) Opera Festival. The BAC Opera Festival's  Artistic Director at the time, Tom Morris, asked Ergen, who was working at the BAC as an Associate Producer, to create something different from normal operatic preconceptions, in a manner similar to that of the Tête à Tête opera company at the [[Riverside Studios]] who were also taking the stage at the BAC Opera Festival that year. Grimeborn is an opera and musical theatre festival in its own right, with the Arcola Theatre its exclusive host. The 2010 Grimeborn programme was curated by director and actor [[Andrew Steggall]] who also oversaw the festival's first outing in 2007. He considers the festival to be "a testing ground for young opera and musical theatre practitioners".{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4377">'''Gumblar''' is a malicious [[JavaScript]] [[Trojan horse (computing)|trojan horse]] file that redirects a user's [[Google search]]es, and then installs [[rogue security software]].  Also known as '''Troj/JSRedir-R'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1009_3-10244529-83.html |title='Gumblar' attacks spreading quickly |accessdate=26 July 2012 |author=Matthew Broersma}}&lt;/ref&gt; this [[botnet]] first appeared in 2009. 

==Infection==
===Windows Personal Computers===
Gumblar.X infections were widely seen on systems running older Windows operating systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.f-secure.com/v-descs/trojan-downloader_js_gumblar_x.shtml|title=Trojan-Downloader:JS/Gumblar.X Description - F-Secure Labs|website=www.f-secure.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Visitors to an infected site will be redirected to an alternative site containing further malware. Initially, this alternative site was gumblar.cn, but it has since switched to a variety of domains. The site sends the visitor an infected [[PDF]] that is opened by the visitor's browser or [[Acrobat Reader]]. The PDF will then exploit a known vulnerability in Acrobat to gain access to the user's computer. Newer variations of Gumblar redirect users to sites running fake anti-virus software.

The virus will find FTP clients such as [[FileZilla]] and [[Dreamweaver]] and download the clients' stored passwords. Gumblar also enables  promiscuous mode on the network card, allowing it to sniff local network traffic for FTP details. It is one of the first viruses to incorporate an automated [[Network Packet Sniffer|network sniffer]].

===Servers===
Using passwords obtained from site admins, the host site will access a website via FTP and infect that website. It will download large portions of the website and inject malicious code into the website's files before uploading the files back onto the server. The code is inserted in any file that contains a '''&lt;body&gt;''' tag, such as HTML, PHP, JavaScript, ASP and ASPx files. The inserted PHP code contains base64-encoded [[JavaScript]] that will infect computers that execute the code. In addition, some pages may have [[Iframe|inline frames]] inserted into them. Typically, iframe code contains hidden links to malicious websites.

The virus will also modify [[.htaccess]] and HOSTS files, and create images.php files in directories named 'images'. The infection is not a server-wide exploit. It will only infect sites on the server that it has passwords to.

==Gumblar variants==
Different companies use different names for Gumblar and variants. Initially, the malware was connecting to gumblar.cn domain but this server was shut down in May 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.computerweekly.com/Articles/2009/05/15/236069/reports-of-gumblars-death-greatly-exaggerated.htm|title=Reports of Gumblar's death greatly exaggerated|last=Binning|first=David|date=15 May 2009|work=Computer Weekly|accessdate=2009-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many badware variants have emerged after that and they connect to other malicious servers via iframe code.

Gumblar resurfaced in January 2010, stealing [[FTP]] usernames and passwords and infecting [[HTML]], [[PHP]] and [[JavaScript]] files on webservers to help spread itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://justcoded.com/article/gumblar-family-virus-removal-tool/|title =Gumblar-family virus removal tool}}&lt;/ref&gt; This time it used multiple domains, making it harder to detect/stop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =http://labs.sucuri.net/db/malware/malware-entry-mwjs151|title=Sucuri  MW:JS:151 Gumblar malware - domains used}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Universe expansion2.png|thumb|241px|According to the Big Bang model, the [[universe]] expanded from an extremely dense and hot state and continues to expand today. A common analogy explains that [[space]] itself is expanding, carrying [[galaxy|galaxies]] with it, like spots on an inflating balloon.

{{Physical cosmology|history}}
The began with the [[Big Bang]]'s development from observations and theoretical considerations. Much of the theoretical work in cosmology now involves extensions and refinements to the basic Big Bang model.

==Ancient philosophy and medieval temporal finitism==
In [[medieval philosophy]], there was much debate over whether the universe had a finite or infinite past (see [[Temporal finitism]]). The philosophy of [[Aristotle]] held that the universe had an infinite past, which caused problems for medieval [[Jewish philosophy|Jewish]] and [[Early Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosophers]] who were unable to reconcile the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] conception of the eternal with the [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] [[Creation according to Genesis|view of creation]].&lt;ref name=Feldman&gt;{{cite journal|title=Gersonides' Proofs for the Creation of the Universe|author=Seymour Feldman|journal=Proceedings of the American Academy for Jewish Research|volume=35|date=1967|pages=113–137|doi=10.2307/3622478|publisher=Proceedings of the American Academy for Jewish Research, Vol. 35|jstor=3622478}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, a variety of logical arguments for the universe having a finite past were developed by [[John Philoponus]], [[Al-Kindi]], [[Saadia Gaon]], [[Al-Ghazali]] and [[Immanuel Kant]], among others.&lt;ref name=Craig&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Whitrow and Popper on the Impossibility of an Infinite Past|first=William Lane|last=Craig|journal=The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science|volume=30|issue=2|date=June 1979|pages=165–170 [165–6]|doi=10.1093/bjps/30.2.165|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1225 treatise ''De Luce'' (''On Light''), English theologian [[Robert Grosseteste]] explored the nature of matter and the cosmos. He described the birth of the universe in an explosion and the crystallization of matter to form stars and planets in a set of nested spheres around Earth. ''De Luce'' is the first attempt to describe the heavens and Earth using a single set of physical laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/news/history-a-medieval-multiverse-1.14837?WT.ec_id=NATURE-20140313]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1610, [[Johannes Kepler]] used the dark night sky to argue for a finite universe. Seventy-seven years later, [[Isaac Newton]] described large-scale motion throughout the universe.

The description of a universe that expanded and contracted in a cyclic manner was first put forward in a poem published in 1791 by [[Erasmus Darwin]]. [[Edgar Allan Poe]] presented a similar cyclic system in his 1848  essay titled ''[[Eureka: A Prose Poem]]''; it is obviously not a scientific work, but Poe, while starting from metaphysical principles, tried to explain the universe using contemporary physical and mental knowledge. Ignored by the scientific community and often misunderstood by literary critics, its scientific implications have been reevaluated in recent times.

According to Poe, the initial state of matter was a single "Primordial Particle". "Divine Volition", manifesting itself as a repulsive force, fragmented the Primordial Particle into atoms. Atoms spread evenly throughout space, until the repulsive force stops, and attraction appears as a reaction: then matter begins to clump together forming stars and star systems, while the material universe is drawn back together by gravity, finally collapsing and ending eventually returning to the Primordial Particle stage in order to begin the process of repulsion and attraction once again. This part of Eureka describes a Newtonian evolving universe which shares a number of properties with relativistic models, and for this reason [[Poe]] anticipates some themes of modern cosmology.&lt;ref name=Cappi&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Edgar Allan Poe's Physical Cosmology|first=Alberto|last=Cappi|journal=[[Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society]]|volume=35|date=1994|pages=177–192|bibcode=1994QJRAS..35..177C}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Early 20th century scientific developments==
Observationally, in the 1910s, [[Vesto Melvin Slipher|Vesto Slipher]] and later, [[Carl Wilhelm Wirtz]], determined that most spiral nebulae (now correctly called [[spiral galaxy|spiral galaxies]]) were receding from Earth. Slipher used [[spectroscopy]] to investigate the rotation periods of planets, the composition of planetary atmospheres, and was the first to observe the radial velocities of galaxies. Wirtz observed a systematic redshift of nebulae, which was difficult to interpret in terms of a cosmology in which the universe is filled more or less uniformly with stars and nebulae. They weren't aware of the cosmological implications, nor that the supposed nebulae were actually galaxies outside our own [[Milky Way]]. {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Also in that decade, [[Albert Einstein]]'s theory of [[general relativity]] was found to admit no [[static universe|static cosmological solutions]], given the basic assumptions of cosmology described in the [[Big Bang#Theoretical underpinnings|Big Bang's theoretical underpinnings]]. The universe (i.e., the space-time metric) was described by a [[metric tensor]] that was either expanding or shrinking (i.e., was not constant or invariant). This result, coming from an evaluation of the field equations of the general theory, at first led Einstein himself to consider that his formulation of the field equations of the general theory may be in error, and he tried to correct it by adding a [[cosmological constant]].  This constant would restore to the general theory's description of space-time an invariant metric tensor for the fabric of space/existence.  The first person to seriously apply general relativity to cosmology without the stabilizing cosmological constant was [[Alexander Friedmann]]. Friedmann derived the expanding-universe solution to general relativity field equations in 1922. Friedmann's 1924 papers included "''Über die Möglichkeit einer Welt mit konstanter negativer Krümmung des Raumes''" (''About the possibility of a world with constant negative curvature'') which was published by the Berlin Academy of Sciences on 7 January 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Friedman |first=A. |authorlink= |date=1922 |title=Über die Krümmung des Raumes |journal=Zeitschrift für Physik |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=377–386 |doi=10.1007/BF01332580 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |bibcode = 1922ZPhy...10..377F }} (English translation in: Gen. Rel. Grav. 31 (1999), 1991–2000.) and {{cite journal |last=Friedman |first=A. |authorlink= |date=1924 |title=Über die Möglichkeit einer Welt mit konstanter negativer Krümmung des Raumes |journal=Zeitschrift für Physik |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=326–332 |doi=10.1007/BF01328280 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |bibcode = 1924ZPhy...21..326F }} (English translation in: Gen. Rel. Grav. 31 (1999), 2001–2008.)
&lt;/ref&gt; Friedmann's equations describe the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker]] universe.

In 1927, the [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] priest [[Georges Lemaître]] proposed an expanding model for the universe to explain the observed redshifts of spiral nebulae, and calculated the [[Hubble law]]. He based his theory on the work of Einstein and [[De Sitter]], and independently derived Friedmann's equations for an expanding universe.  Also, the red shifts themselves were not constant, but varied in such manner as to lead to the conclusion that there was a definite relationship between amount of red-shift of nebulae, and their distance from observers.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

In 1929, [[Edwin Hubble]] provided a comprehensive observational foundation for Lemaître's theory. Hubble's experimental observations discovered that, relative to the Earth and all other observed bodies, galaxies are receding in every direction at velocities (calculated from their observed red-shifts) directly proportional to their distance from the Earth and each other. In 1929, Hubble and [[Milton Humason]] formulated the empirical Redshift Distance Law of galaxies, nowadays known as [[Hubble's law]], which, once the redshift is interpreted as a measure of recession speed, is consistent with the solutions of Einstein's General Relativity Equations for a homogeneous, isotropic expanding space.  The isotropic nature of the expansion was direct proof that it was the space (the fabric of existence) itself that was expanding, not the bodies in space that were simply moving further outward and apart into an infinitely larger preexisting empty void. It was this interpretation that led to the concept of the expanding universe. The law states that the greater the distance between any two galaxies, the greater their relative speed of separation. This discovery later resulted in the formulation of the Big Bang model.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

In 1931, Lemaître proposed in his "''hypothèse de l'atome primitif''" (hypothesis of the primeval atom) that the universe began with the "explosion" of the "primeval [[atom]]" — what was later called the Big Bang. Lemaître first took [[cosmic ray]]s to be the remnants of the event, although it is now known that they originate within the local [[galaxy]]. Lemaître had to wait until shortly before his death to learn of the discovery of [[cosmic microwave background radiation]], the remnant radiation of a dense and hot phase in the early universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Georges Lemaître, Father of the Big Bang |url=http://www.amnh.org/education/resources/rfl/web/essaybooks/cosmic/p_lemaitre.html |publisher=American Museum of Natural History |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117044852/http://www.amnh.org/education/resources/rfl/web/essaybooks/cosmic/p_lemaitre.html |archivedate=17 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Big Bang theory vs. Steady State theory===
Hubble's Law suggested that the universe was expanding, contradicting the [[cosmological principle]] whereby the universe, when viewed on sufficiently large distance scales, has no preferred directions or preferred places.  Hubble's idea allowed for two opposing hypotheses to be suggested. One was Lemaître's Big Bang, advocated and developed by [[George Gamow]]. The other model was [[Fred Hoyle]]'s [[Steady State theory]], in which new matter would be created as the galaxies moved away from each other. In this model, the universe is roughly the same at any point in time. It was actually Hoyle who coined the name of Lemaître's theory, referring to it  as "this 'big bang' idea" during a radio broadcast on 28 March 1949, on the [[BBC]] [[Third Programme]]. It is popularly reported that Hoyle, who favored an alternative "[[steady state universe|steady state]]" cosmological model, intended this to be pejorative, but Hoyle explicitly denied this and said it was just a striking image meant to highlight the difference between the two models.&lt;ref&gt;

 |ref=harv
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Hoyle repeated the term in further broadcasts in early 1950, as part of a series of five lectures entitled ''The Nature of The Universe''. The text of each lecture was published in [[The Listener (British magazine)|''The Listener'']] a week after the broadcast, the first time that the term "big bang" appeared in print.&lt;ref&gt;The book in question can [no longer] be downloaded here: [http://www.nap.edu/books/0309093139/html/136.html]&lt;/ref&gt; As evidence in favour of the Big Bang model mounted, and the consensus became widespread, Hoyle himself, albeit somewhat reluctantly, admitted to it by formulating a new cosmological model that other scientists later referred to as the "Steady Bang".&lt;ref&gt;Rees, M., Just Six Minutes, Orion Books, London (2003), p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

==1950 to 1990s==
[[File:WMAP power spectrum.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Comparison of the predictions of the standard Big Bang model with experimental measurements. The power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background radiation anisotropy is plotted in terms of the angular scale (or [[multipole moment]]) (top).]]

From around 1950 to 1965, the support for these theories was evenly divided, with a slight imbalance arising from the fact that the Big Bang theory could explain both the formation and the observed abundances of [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]], whereas the Steady State could explain how they were formed, but not why they should have the observed abundances. However, the observational evidence began to support the idea that the universe evolved from a hot dense state. Objects such as [[quasars]] and radio galaxies were observed to be much more common at large distances (therefore in the distant past) than in the nearby universe, whereas the Steady State predicted that the average properties of the universe should be unchanging with time. In addition, the discovery of the [[cosmic microwave background]] radiation in 1964 was considered the death knell of the Steady State, although this prediction was only qualitative, and failed to predict the exact temperature of the CMB. (The key big bang prediction is the black-body spectrum of the CMB, which was not measured with high accuracy until COBE in 1990). After some reformulation, the Big Bang has been regarded as the best theory of the origin and evolution of the cosmos. Before the late 1960s, many cosmologists thought the infinitely dense and [[physical paradox|physically paradoxical]] [[Gravitational singularity|singularity]] at the starting time of Friedmann's cosmological model could be avoided by allowing for a universe which was contracting before entering the hot dense state, and starting to expand again. This was formalized as [[Richard Tolman]]'s [[oscillating universe]]. In the sixties, [[Stephen Hawking]] and others demonstrated that this idea was unworkable,{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} and the singularity is an essential feature of the physics described by Einstein's gravity. This led the majority of cosmologists to accept the notion that the universe as currently described by the physics of general relativity has a finite age. However, due to a lack of a theory of [[quantum gravity]], there is no way to say whether the singularity is an actual origin point for the universe, or whether the physical processes that govern the regime cause the universe to be effectively eternal in character.

Through the 1970s and 1980s, most cosmologists accepted the Big Bang, but several puzzles remained, including the non-discovery of anisotropies in the CMB, and occasional observations hinting at deviations from a black-body spectrum; thus the theory was not very strongly confirmed.

==1990 onwards==
Huge advances in Big Bang cosmology were made in the 1990s and the early 21st century, as a result of major advances in [[telescope]] technology in combination with large amounts of satellite data, such as [[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]], the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] and [[WMAP]]. 

In 1990, measurements from the [[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]] satellite showed that the spectrum of the CMB matches a 2.725 K [[black-body]] to very high precision; deviations do not exceed 2 parts in {{val|100000}}. This showed that earlier claims of spectral deviations were incorrect, and essentially proved that the universe was hot and dense in the past, since no other known mechanism can produce a black-body to such high accuracy. Further observations from COBE in 1992 discovered the very small anisotropies of the CMB on large scales, approximately as predicted from Big Bang models with [[dark matter]]. From then on, models of [[non-standard cosmology]] without some form of Big Bang became very rare in the mainstream astronomy journals.

In 1998, measurements of distant supernovae indicated that the expansion of the universe is accelerating, and this was supported by other observations including ground-based CMB observations and large galaxy redshift surveys. In 1999-2000, the [[BOOMERanG]] and Maxima balloon-borne
CMB observations showed that the geometry of the universe is close to flat, then in 2001 the
[[2dFGRS]] galaxy redshift survey estimated the mean matter density around 25-30 percent of critical density. 
 
From 2003 to 2010, [[NASA]]'s [[WMAP]] spacecraft took very detailed pictures of the universe by means of the cosmic microwave background radiation. The images can be interpreted to indicate that the universe is 13.7 billion years old (within one percent error) and that the [[Lambda-CDM model]] and the [[Inflation (cosmology)|inflationary theory]] are correct. No other cosmological theory can yet explain such a wide range of observed parameters, from the ratio of the elemental abundances in the early universe to the structure of the cosmic microwave background, the observed higher abundance of [[active galaxies|active galactic nuclei]] in the early universe and the observed masses of [[clusters of galaxies]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

In 2013 and 2015, ESA's [[Planck_(spacecraft)|Planck]] spacecraft released even more detailed images of the cosmic microwave background, showing consistency with the [[Lambda-CDM model]] to still higher precision. 

Much of the current work in cosmology includes understanding how galaxies form in the context of the Big Bang, understanding what happened in the earliest times after the Big Bang, and reconciling observations with the basic theory. Cosmologists continue to calculate many of the parameters of the Big Bang to a new level of precision, and carry out more detailed observations which are hoped to provide clues to the nature of [[dark energy]] and [[dark matter]], and to test the theory of [[General Relativity]] on cosmic scales.

'''Kakao M''' ({{korean|hangul=카카오M}}; formerly '''Seoul Records''', '''YBM Seoul Records''' and '''LOEN Entertainment''') is a South Korean entertainment company established by Min Yeong-bin in 1978. It is currently one of the largest co-publisher companies in South Korea.

==History==

=== 1978–2008: Founding of Seoul Records ===
Kakao M was founded as Seoul Records in 1978 by Min Yeong-bin as a subsidiary of YBM Sisa, a company mainly involved in creating language-learning tapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ybm.co.kr/sisa/photo.aspx?seq=14&amp;Page=1|title=1978 - Founding of "Seoul Records"|publisher=[[YBM Group]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228214818/http://www.ybm.co.kr/sisa/photo.aspx?seq=14&amp;Page=1|archivedate=2013-12-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was officially registered in 1982, and in 1984 it began to produce and distribute records of classical and traditional music. It was registered as a [[venture capital]] company in 1999 when it began to sell albums while operating an online shop. In 2000, the company's name was changed to YBM Seoul Records and it began to operate on [[KOSDAQ]]. The company joined the [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry|IFPI]] in 2003. Korean conglomerate [[SK Telecom]] bought a 60% share of the company in 2005, and YBM Seoul Records subsequently became part of SK Group.&lt;ref name="Prometheus Global Media"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/1411719/korean-telco-takes-control-of-seoul-records|title=Korean Telco Takes Control Of Seoul Records|date=May 27, 2005|work=[[billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|accessdate=August 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2008–2016: Name change to LOEN Entertainment ===
As of 2008, the company has been known as LOEN Entertainment. '''LOEN''' stands for: '''Live On Entertainment Networks''' and
'''LOve + ENtertainment'''

Kakao M took charge of SK Telecom's online music distribution service, [[melon (online music service)|MelOn]], in 2009. MelOn is currently the most used online music sales site in South Korea.&lt;ref name="terms.naver"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=651823&amp;mobile&amp;categoryId=2058|title=(주)로엔엔터테인먼트 (LOEN Entertainment, Inc.)|work=[[naver|Naver Terms]] |publisher= [[Naver Corporation]]|date=2012-08-25|accessdate=2012-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chosun Ilbo"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://biz.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2013/05/13/2013051301997.html|title=로엔 vs KT뮤직... 음원株 '지각변동' (LOEN versus KT Music...

On December 18, 2013, Kakao M acquired 70% of shares in [[Starship Entertainment]], making it as an independent subsidiary of the company.&lt;ref name=" LOENStarship" /&gt;

On January 11, 2016, Kakao M was acquired by [[Kakao]] Corporation.&lt;ref name="Chosun" /&gt;&lt;ref name="reuters" /&gt;

On May 11, 2017, Kakao M announced its strategic [[Korean drama|drama]] production alliance with [[CJ E&amp;M]]'s drama production subsidiary [[Studio Dragon|Studio Dragon Corporation]]. Among the plans under the alliance is producing dramas based on [[Web fiction#Web novel|web novels]] and [[webtoon]]s on [[KakaoPage]] and [[Daum (web portal)|Daum]] Webtoons (which copyrights are managed by ''Podotree'', the web literature subsidiary of Kakao).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.soompi.com/2017/05/10/loen-entertainment-create-new-drama-production-company-studio-dragon/|title=Loen Entertainment To Create New Drama Production Company With Studio Dragon|author=U. Kim|work=[[Soompi]]|publisher=[[Viki (website)|Viki Inc.]]|date=May 10, 2017|accessdate=June 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Kakao M first entered the drama production industry three years ago through the cable-web drama ''Another Parting'', which starred [[Seo In-guk]] and [[Wang Ji-won]].) On August 25, Kakao M announced that its joint venture with Studio Dragon will be called as '''Mega Monster'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dt.co.kr/contents.html?article_no=2017082502101231043001|title=카카오, `로엔` 주축 자체 제작 동영상 강화|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;    

The company has also signed actress [[Kim So-hyun]] through setting up her own independent label, '''E&amp;T Story Entertainment''', which is led by her long-time manager Park Chan-woo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.mk.co.kr/newsRead.php?no=851779&amp;year=2017|title=배우 김소현, 로엔과 손잡고 독립 레이블 설립|date=December 26, 2017|work=[[Maeil Business Newspaper]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon approval by the company's board of directors in a December 20 meeting, the company is known as '''Kakao M Corporation''' &lt;!---It depends if the company name should be stylized as uppercase '''K''' ("Kakao M") or lowercase '''K''' ("kakao M"), just like its parent company.--&gt; ({{ko-hhrm|주식회사 카카오엠}}) since March 23, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.news.naver.com/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=105&amp;oid=028&amp;aid=0002403489|title=로엔엔터테인먼트 사명 ‘카카오M’으로 변경|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The letter '''M''' in the new corporate name stands for three things: '''Melon''' (the company's flagship online music service), '''Music''' (the company's core business) and '''Media''' (another business that the company will advance to in the future). The company will now also have a corporate [[Advertising slogan|catchphrase]], ''We Entertain''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.soompi.com/2017/12/20/loen-entertainment-changes-name-kakao-m/|title=Loen Entertainment Changes Its Name To kakao M|date=December 20, 2017|work=[[Busan Ilbo]] News20 via [[Soompi]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://vip.mk.co.kr/news/view/21/28/615797.html|title=(주)로엔엔터테인먼트 수시공시의무관련사항(공정공시)|date=December 20, 2017|work=[[Maeil Business Newspaper]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barely a month before the company's relaunch under its new name, Sean Seong-hoon Park resigned from both his positions as CEO of the company and chief strategy officer of [[Kakao|its parent company]], and later moved to [[Netmarble Games]].

==Controversies==

===Price fixing===
'''2011'''&lt;br&gt;
Kakao M, along with then-parent [[SK Telecom]], was one of the 15 companies fined and sued by the [[Fair Trade Commission (South Korea)|Korean FTC]] for [[Fair Trade Commission (South Korea)#2011 music price fixing scandal.5B1.5D|price rigging in 2011]]. The company was fined $9.6 million for its role in the scheme.&lt;ref name="allkpop"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.allkpop.com/article/2011/03/koreas-fair-trade-commission-fines-15-music-distributors-for-collectively-rigging-prices|title=Korea's Fair Trade Commission fines 15 music distributors for collectively rigging prices|date=March 1, 2011|work=[[allkpop]]|accessdate=July 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2016'''&lt;br&gt;
On October 9, 2016, the [[Supreme Court of South Korea]] handed out a 100 million won fine each to Kakao M and its closest competitor [[Genie Music]] (then known as KT Music) for colluding in price fixing, dating back to a case filed in 2008. Co-CEO Shin Won-soo, who was the sole CEO at the time being, was also sentenced to pay 10 million won.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/biz/2016/10/123_215715.html|title=Loen, KT Music fined for music source price-fixing|date=October 9, 2016|work=[[The Korea Times]]|accessdate=October 12, 2016|author=Yoon Sung-won}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Incredible'' promotion conflict===
In 2013, Kakao M made a deal with [[C-JeS Entertainment]] to promote and distribute [[Junsu]]'s second [[studio album]] ''[[Incredible (XIA album)|Incredible]]''. Days before the album's release, C-Jes was reportedly notified by Kakao M that they would distribute the album but had scrapped plans for promotional marketing and broadcasting Junsu's upcoming showcase on MelOn, although they would be able to broadcast it on [[1theK Originals|LOEN TV]]. Promotional banners regarding the album's release on MelOn also disappeared from Kakao M's social media accounts. C-JeS subsequently threatened to remove mentions of Kakao M from Junsu's upcoming showcase and to file for a civil appeal to the [[Fair Trade Commission (South Korea)|Fair Trade Commission]] and Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.nate.com/view/20130709n20424|title=씨제스 "로엔, 준수 홍보 파기는 갑의 횡포"- 로엔 "긴급회의 중"|website=네이트뉴스|language=ko-KR|access-date=2016-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, Kakao M stated that they were still in discussions regarding the album's promotion and that nothing had been confirmed prior to the relevant article's release. They pointed to the showcase event page on MelOn's homepage still being up as evidence that promotions were going ahead as planned. C-JeS responded saying that they had begun receiving pre-orders for the album and entries for the showcase event without a response from Kakao M.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.nate.com/view/20130709n28441|title=김준수 계약파기? 로엔 측 "계약 협의단계일뿐…결정된 사항無"|website=네이트뉴스|language=ko-KR|access-date=2016-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.nate.com/view/20130709n33221|title=김준수 측, 로엔 해명 재반박 "협의단계일 뿐이었다고?"|website=네이트뉴스|language=ko-KR|access-date=2016-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following media attention, the two companies met on July 8 and resolved the dispute. ''Incredible'' was promoted and distributed by Kakao M as planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thestar.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2013/07/10/2013071001298.html|title=XIA 준수 측, "로엔과 원만한 합의..예정대로"  :: THE STAR|website=thestar.chosun.com|access-date=2016-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Karlsruhe Congress''' was an international meeting of chemists held in [[Karlsruhe]], Germany from 3 to 5 September 1860. It was the first international conference of chemistry worldwide.

== The meeting ==

The Karlsruhe Congress was called so that European chemists could discuss matters of chemical nomenclature, notation, and atomic weights. The organization, invitation, and sponsorship of the conference were handled by [[Friedrich August Kekulé von Stradonitz|August Kekulé]], [[Charles-Adolphe Wurtz|Adolphe Wurtz]], and [[Karl Weltzien]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Leicester | first = Henry M. | title = The Historical Background of Chemistry | publisher = John Wiley and Sons | year = 1956 | pages = 191&amp;ndash;192 | isbn = 0-486-61053-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As an example of the problems facing the delegates, Kekulé's ''Lehrbuch der Organischen Chemie'' gave nineteen different formulas used by chemists for [[acetic acid]], as shown in the figure on this page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kekulé | first = A. | title = Lehrbuch der Organischen Chemie … , vol. 1 | publisher = Ferdinand Enke | place = Erlangen, (Germany) | year = 1861 | page = 58 | language = German |url = https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=njp.32101058262955;view=1up;seq=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The French chemist [[Auguste Laurent]] also listed many different contemporary representations of acetic acid (''acide acétique'') in his book:  {{cite book|last1=Laurent|first1=Auguste|title=Méthode de Chimie|date=1854|publisher=Mallet-Bachelier|location=Paris, France|pages=27-28|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kwZBAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA27#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Karlsruhe meeting ended with no firm agreement on the vexing problem of atomic and molecular weights. However, on the meeting's last day reprints of [[Stanislao Cannizzaro]]'s 1858 paper on atomic weights,&lt;ref&gt;See:

Cannizzaro's efforts exerted a heavy and, in some cases, an almost immediate influence on the delegates. [[Lothar Meyer]] later wrote that on reading Cannizzaro's paper, "The scales seemed to fall from my eyes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Moore | first = F. J. | title = A History of Chemistry | publisher = McGraw-Hill | year = 1931 | pages = 182&amp;ndash;184 | isbn = 0-07-148855-3 }} (2nd edition)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cannizzaro, Stanislao (1891) with Arthur Miolati, trans., and Lothar Meyer, ed. ''Abriss eines Lehrganges der theoretischen Chemie'' [Outline of a Course of Theoretical Chemistry] (Leipzig, (Germany):  Wilhelm Engelmann, 1891), [https://books.google.com/books?id=gCozAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA59#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 59.]  On p. 59, Lothmar Meyer wrote:  ''"Nach Schluss der Versammlung vertheilte Freund ''Angelo Pavesi'' im Auftrage des Verfassers eine kleine ziemlich unscheinbare Schrift, den hier wiedergegeben "Sunto" etc. ''Cannizzaro's'', der schon einige Jahre früher erschienen, aber wenig bekannt geworden war.  Auch ich erhielt ein Exemplar, das ich einsteckte, um es unterwegs auf der Heimreise zu lesen.  Ich las es wiederholt auch zu Hause und war erstaunt über die Klarheit, die das Schriftchen über die wichtigsten Streitpunkte verbreitete.  Es fiel mir wie Schuppen von den Augen, die Zweifel schwanden, und das Gefühl ruhigster Sicherheit trat an ihre Stelle."''  (At the conclusion of the meeting, friend ''Angelo Pavesi'', on behalf of the author, distributed a small, inconspicuous pamphlet, Cannizzaro's "Sunto" etc. [which is] reproduced here [Note:  "Sunto" refers to:  Stanislao Cannizzaro (1858) [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433062756915;view=1up;seq=331 "Lettera del Prof. Stanislao Cannizzaro al Prof. S. de Luca; Sunto di un corso di filosofia chimica fatto nella Reale Università di Genova dal Professore S. Cannizzaro,"] ''Il Nuovo Cimento'', '''7''' : 321–366.], which had appeared a few years earlier but has been little known. I too received a copy, which I pocketed to read on the way home.  I also read it at home repeatedly and was amazed at the clarity that the pamphlet spread about the main issues.  It was as if the scales fell from my eyes, the doubts faded, and the feeling of calmest assurance took its place.)&lt;/ref&gt;

An important long-term result of the Karlsruhe Congress was the adoption of the now-familiar atomic weights. Prior to the Karlsruhe meeting, and going back to [[John Dalton|Dalton's]] work in 1803, several systems of atomic weights were in use.&lt;ref&gt;An example of the confusion is provided by the table of atomic weights in the various prevailing systems, which appears in:  {{cite book|last1=Gehler|first1=Johann Samuel Traugott|editor1-last=Gmelin|editor2-last=Littrow|editor3-last=Muncke|editor4-last=Pfaff|title=Johann Samuel Traugott Gehler's Physikalisches Wörterbuch, 9. Band, 3. Abtheilung|trans-title=Johann Samuel Traugott Gehler's Physical Dictionary, vol. 9, part 3|date=1840|publisher=E.B. Schwickert|location=Leipzig, (Germany)|pages=1909-1912|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044089527675;view=1up;seq=321|language=German}}  In the tables of pages 1911–1912, Column C presents the relative atomic weights of the known elements, assigning to hydrogen (''Wasserstoff'') an atomic weight of 1.  Column D contains the same relative atomic weights as column C, except that oxygen (''Sauerstoff'') is assigned a relative atomic weight of 100.  (Gehler says of columns C and D:  ''"In den Columnen C und D finden sich die Atomgewichte, wie sie sich nach den so eben entwickelten Grundsätzen als die wahrscheinlichsten ergeben möchten, … "''  (In columns C and D are found the atomic weights, as they would result from the principles [that have been] developed just now as the most probable ones … )  But this system assigns to oxygen an atomic weight of 8 and to carbon (''Kohlenstoff'') an atomic weight of 6.)  Column E presents the relative atomic weights according to [[Jöns Jacob Berzelius|Berzelius]], who assigned to hydrogen atoms (''das Atomgewicht des einfachen Wasserstoffatoms'' (the atomic weight of single hydrogen atoms)) a value of 0.5 and who found oxygen to have a value of 8.01 — about 16 times greater than that of the hydrogen atom, which is correct.  Column F contains the same relative atomic weights as column E, except that oxygen is assigned a relative atomic weight of 100.&lt;/ref&gt; In one case, a value of 1 was adopted as the weight of hydrogen (the base unit), with 6 for carbon and 8 for oxygen. As long as there were uncertainties over atomic weights then the compositions of many compounds remained in doubt. Following the Karlsruhe meeting, values of about 1 for hydrogen, 12 for carbon, 16 for oxygen, and so forth were adopted. This was based on a recognition that certain elements, such as hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen, were composed of [[diatomic molecule]]s and not individual atoms.

Ihde has argued&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ihde, Aaron J. |title=The Karlsruhe Congress: A Centennial Retrospective |journal=Journal of Chemical Education |year=1961 |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=83&amp;ndash;86 |url=http://search.jce.divched.org/JCEIndex/FMPro?-db=jceindex.fp5&amp;-lay=wwwform&amp;combo=karlsruhe&amp;-find=&amp;-format=detail.html&amp;-skip=0&amp;-max=1&amp;-token.2=0&amp;-token.3=10 |doi=10.1021/ed038p83 |format= |bibcode=1961JChEd..38...83I }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt; that the Karlsruhe meeting was the first international meeting of chemists and that it led to the eventual founding of the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC).

'''Lunar New Year''' is the beginning of a year whose months are coordinated by the [[moon cycles|cycles of the moon]].  The whole year may account to a purely [[lunar calendar]] or a [[lunisolar calendar]].

==Celebrations==
The following [[East Asia]]n Lunar New Year celebrations are, or were historically, based on the traditional [[Chinese lunisolar calendar]] (occurring in late January or early February):&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/10-lunar-new-year-facts-help-answer-your-pressing-questions-n710646 |title=10 Lunar New Year facts to help answer your pressing questions |last=Wamg |first=Frances Kai-Hwa |date=2017-01-23 |work=NBC News |access-date=2018-02-14 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Chinese New Year]] 
* [[Japanese New Year#Little New Year|Japanese New Year]] (prior to 1873)
* [[Korean New Year]] ''(Seollal)''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=DuBois |first1=Jill |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JklBlOQhkTcC&amp;dq |title=Korea |volume=Volume 7 of Cultures of the world |edition=illustrated, revised |publisher=Marshall Cavendish |year=2004 |page=114 |isbn=978-0761417866 |accessdate=2015-02-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Tsagaan Sar|Mongolian New Year]] ''(Tsagaan Sar)'' – may be celebrated a month later
* [[Losar|Tibetan New Year]] ''(Losar)'' – celebrated a month later
* [[Tết|Vietnamese New Year]] ''(Tết)'' 

These [[South Asia]]n traditional lunisolar celebrations are observed according to the local lunisolar calendars. They are influenced by Indian tradition, which marks the solar new year on the sun's entry into Aries in April. 
* [[Ugadi]] and [[Gudi Padwa]], Lunisolar new year's day celebrated by the Deccan people of India
* [[Sajibu nongma panba|Meitei Cheiraoba]], Lunisolar new year's day celebrated by [[Meitei people]] 
* [[Kashmiri Pandit festivals#Navreh|Kashmiri New Year]] ''(Navreh)'', Lunisolar new year's day celebrated by [[Kashmiri Pandit]]s
* [[Nyepi]], in [[Bali]], [[Indonesia]]

These [[South and Southeast Asian New Year]] celebrations have dates based on the solar cycle ("solar new year"), but are part of the local lunisolar calendar system or were historically observed according to the local lunisolar calendars, and thus do not generally align with the first day of the lunisolar year. They are influenced by Indian (''Indic'') tradition (occurring on 13/14 April):
* [[Thingyan|Burmese New Year]] ''(Thingyan)'': New year falls in April, but is not the first day of the [[Burmese_calendar#New_Year's_Day|Burmese lunisolar calendar year]]; similar to Dai, Cambodian, Lao, Sri Lankan, Nepali, Bengali, Tamil and Thai new years
* [[Cambodian New Year]] ''(Chaul Chnam Thmey)'', similar to Burmese, Dai, Lao, Sri Lankan, Nepali, Odia, Bengali, Malayalee, Tamil and Thai new years
* [[Lao New Year]], similar to Burmese, Dai, Cambodian, Sri Lankan, Nepali, Bengali, Odia, Malayalee, Tamil and Thai new years
* [[Bisket Jatra|Nepali New Year]], similar to Burmese, Dai, Cambodian, Sri Lankan, Bengali, Odia, Thai, Malayalee, Tamil and Lao new years
* [[Pana Sankranti|Odia New Year]] ''(Pana Sankranti)'', similar to Burmese, Dai, Cambodian, Sri Lankan, Nepali, Bengali, Thai, Malayalee, Tamil and Lao new years 
* [[Sinhalese New Year|Sinhala and Tamil New Year]], similar to Burmese, Dai, Cambodian, Lao, Nepali, Bengali, Odia, Malayalee, Tamil and Thai new years
* [[Songkran (Thailand)|Thai New Year]] ''(Songkran)'', similar to Burmese, Dai, Cambodian, Lao, Sri Lankan, Bengali, Odia, Malayalee, Tamil and Nepali new years
* [[Pohela Boishakh]] ''(Bengali New Year)'', similar to Burmese, Dai, Cambodian, Lao, Sri Lankan, Odia, Malayalee, Tamil and Nepali new years
* [[Puthandu]] ''(Tamil New Year)'', similar to Burmese, Dai, Cambodian, Lao, Sri Lankan, Odia, Malayalee and Nepali new years
* [[Water-Sprinkling Festival]] ''([[Dai people|Dai]] New Year)'', similar to Burmese, Bengali, Cambodian, Lao, Sri Lankan, Odia, Malayalee, Tamil and Nepali new years 
* [[Sangken]], similar to Burmese, Bengali, Cambodian, Lao, Sri Lankan, Dai, Odia, Malayalee, Tamil and Nepali new years
* [[Vishu]], ''(Malayalee New Year)'', similar to Burmese, Dai, Bengali, Cambodian, Lao, Sri Lankan, Odia, Malayalee, Tamil and Nepali new years
* [[Maithili New Year]], in [[Mithila, Nepal]]

Lunar New Year celebrations that originated in [[Western Asia]] fall on other days:
* [[Islamic New Year]] or Muslim New Year is not lunisolar but follows a purely lunar calendar of 12 months that retrogresses through the Gregorian and Julian calendar years.  The day of Muslim New Year may thus fall in any season on the calendar.
* In Jewish (Rabbinical and Karaite) and Samaritan religious and secular traditions, there are several holy days and festivals that are lunar new year observances.  Each tradition uses a slightly different version of the [[Hebrew Calendar]] but they are all lunisolar, so the days always fall in the same season.
** [[Rosh Hashanah]] in the Rabbinic Jewish tradition begins with the new moon of the month of Tishrei and inaugurates a new calendar year. Karaite Jews and Samaritans observe 1 Tishrei as the holiday ''Yom Teruah'' (meaning "Day of Noise," whereas Rosh Hashanah means "Head of the Year").  It is an autumn holy day.
** 1 Nissan/Abib is the first day of the new year in Karaite tradition and begins a 15-day celebration culminating in the [[Passover]] holiday. Rabbinic Judaism calls this the New Year for Kings and similarly numbers Nissan as the first month. Nissan/Abib begins in the spring.
** 1 Elul is the date on which the Samaritan calendar advances. It corresponds to the [[Rosh Hashanah LaBehema|New Year for Animal Tithes]] in the Rabbinic tradition.  This is a very late summer/early autumn holiday.

'''Open Engagement''' is an international conference and artist project focusing on [[Social practice#Art and social practice|art and social practice]]. Directed and founded by [[Jen Delos Reyes]] in 2007, the conference incorporates workshops, exhibitions, residencies, pedagogy, curatorial practice and collaborative projects.

The conference is free of charge and has hosted over 700 presenters, taking place in two countries over the past seven years. Since the first Open Engagement conference in 2007, the event has become a locus for people interested in socially engaged art.&lt;ref&gt;http://badatsports.com/index.php?s=open+season&amp;x=0&amp;y=0&lt;/ref&gt; The conference offers a primary site where practitioners convene annually to take stock of the field, playing host to artists and activists.

==History==

'''2007'''&lt;br/&gt;
The initial conference, born out of Delos Reyes' graduate studies at the [[University of Regina]], was hosted by the University, the Dunlop Art Gallery, The Mackenzie Art Gallery and local Regina residents from October 11–13, 2007. Each of the three days focused on a unique theme of exploration; October 11, You are all that I see: Art and everyday experience; October 12, It takes two: Collaborations, collectives, other team relationships; October 13. I’ll call you: Long-term relationships, communities, and connectivity. Over 40 national and international contributors were present during this first conference. The contributors were selected through an open call for submissions, participating alongside three keynote presenters.&lt;ref&gt;http://jendelosreyes.com/openengagement/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2010'''&lt;br/&gt;
In 2010 Open Engagement moved to [[Portland State University]], planned in conjunction with the Art and Social Practice students, continuing under the leadership of Delos Reyes. The artists involved in Open Engagement: Making Things, Making Things Better, Making Things Worse, challenged traditional ideas of what art is and does. The artists' projects mediated the contemporary frameworks of art as service, as social space, as activism, as interactions, and as relationships.
 
Over 150 presenters were accepted through an open call for submissionS. Featured keynote presenters were [[Mark Dion]], [[Nils Norman]], and [[Amy Franceschini]].&lt;ref&gt;http://openengagement.info/home/archive&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2011'''&lt;br/&gt;
Open Engagement 2011 explored broadly art and social practice. Through conversations, interviews, open reflection on experiences, and related projects created for or presented at the conference, five themes were examined: Peoples and Publics, Social Economies, In Between Places, Tracking and Tracing, and Sentiment and Strategies. 2011’s keynote presenters were [[Julie Ault]], [[Fritz Haeg]], and Pablo Helguera.

In 2011 Open Engagement also played host to the [[Bureau for Open Culture]], Bad at Sports, an exhibition by the [[Bruce High Quality Foundation University]], and concurrent summits on art and
education and social practice/participatory programs and practices arising at museums. The summits featured representatives from [[Otis College of Art and Design]], the [[University of California, Santa Cruz|University of California Santa Cruz]], [[Maryland Institute College of Art|MICA]], [[California College of the Arts]], The Walker, [[Portland Art Museum]], [[Hammer Museum|The Hammer]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;Delos Reyes, Jen. 2012. Open Engagement: An Anthology. Portland: Publication Studio.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2012'''&lt;br/&gt;
The 2012 Open Engagement featured presentations from keynote speakers [[Tania Bruguera]], Shannon Jackson and Paul Ramirez Jonas. The work by these artists and scholars informed
the conference themes: Politics, Economies, Education, and Representation.&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.frieze.com/open-engagement-2012-portland/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2013'''&lt;br/&gt;
Open Engagement 2013 featured keynote presenters Claire Doherty,&lt;ref&gt;http://badatsports.com/2013/episode-417-claire-doherty/&lt;/ref&gt; Tom Finkelpearl, and
[[Michael Rakowitz]]. They were brought together to reflect on the themes of publics, contexts, and institutions in relation to the current state of socially engaged art, education, and institutional practice.

The conference included dozens of panels, workshops, and lectures, as well as a continuation of the socially engaged art in art institutions summit as well as a public conversation with [[Creative Time]] on the roles of the Creative Time Summit and Open Engagement.

'''2014'''&lt;br /&gt;
Open Engagement 2014 featured keynote presenters [[J. Morgan Puett]] and [[Mierle Laderman Ukeles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://temporaryartreview.com/in-defense-of-the-possible-at-open-engagement/|title=In Defense of the Possible at Open Engagement {{!}} Temporary Art Review|website=temporaryartreview.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; These and other artists, scholars and conference participants reflected on the theme of Life/Work. In 2014 the conference became mobile and was hosted by Queens Museum in the borough of Queens, New York City.  

'''2015'''&lt;br /&gt;
In 2015, Open Engagement moved to Pittsburgh to explore the themes of place and revolution. [http://www.abladeofgrass.org/ A Blade of Grass] was the year's organizational partner and the conference featured keynote presentations by [[Emily Jacir]] and [[Rick Lowe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abladeofgrass.org/lay-of-the-land/open-engagement-2015-heads-to-pittsburgh/|title=Open Engagement 2015 Heads to Pittsburgh - A Blade of Grass|work=A Blade of Grass|access-date=2018-11-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2016'''&lt;br /&gt;
The 2016 iteration of Open Engagement took place at the Oakland Museum of California. The 2016 conference theme, POWER, was guided by the curatorial vision of René de Guzman and featured keynote speakers [[Angela Davis]] and [[Suzanne Lacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://museumca.org/2016/open-engagement-power|title=Open Engagement—POWER {{!}} Oakland Museum of California|website=museumca.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2017'''&lt;br /&gt;
Open Engagement 2017 took place at the University of Illinois at Chicago and a constellation of sites across the city. The conference theme JUSTICE was guided by the curatorial vision of Romi Crawford and Lisa Yun Lee. Featured presenters included [[Theaster Gates]], Maria Gaspar, [[Maria Varela]], [[Ai-jen Poo]], Marisa Jahn and Laurie Jo Reynolds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://arts.uchicago.edu/event/open-engagement-2017-%E2%80%94-justice|title=Open Engagement 2017 — JUSTICE {{!}} UChicago Arts {{!}} The University of Chicago|website=arts.uchicago.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paris La Défense – Une Ville En Concert''' was a concert held by musician [[Jean-Michel Jarre]] on the district of [[La Défense]] in [[Paris]] on [[Bastille Day]], July 14, 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Historical Dictionary of French Theater|first=Edward|last=Forman|publisher=Scarecrow Press||location=Plymouth|year=2010|page=139|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9pz5Smxi-KsC|isbn=9780810849396|oclc=705622337}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 2.5 million people standing in front of the pyramidal stage all the way down to the [[Arc de Triomphe]] witnessed this event, setting a new ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'' entry for Jarre. The concert was funded by the [[Mairie de Paris]], the [[Ministry of Culture (France)|Ministry of Culture]] and a small cluster of high-profile Parisian business concerns. Later, a concert video as well as a photobook of the event were released.

The show featured new tracks from the [[Waiting for Cousteau]] album, and vast grotesque marionettes created by [[Trinidadian]] [[Peter Minshall]]. A [[VHS]] cassette of the concert was released in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|title=Jean Michel Jarre: Paris La Defense - A City In Concert|people=Mike Mansfield (Director), Jean-Michel Jarre (Performer)|format=VHS video|publisher=Genesis Home Video|date=1992|oclc=873205684}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6487">[[File:Point of view bias.jpg|thumb|Point of view. Two people are looking at the same object and interpreting it differently due to a different point of view]]
In [[philosophy]], a '''point of view''' is a specified or stated manner of consideration,&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/point_of_view "Point of view"], Dictionary.com Unabridged. Random House, Inc. 31 Aug. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  an attitude how one sees or thinks of something,&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/point_of_view "Point of view"] The American Heritage® Dictionary of Idioms by Christine Ammer. Houghton Mifflin Company. 31 Aug. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; as in "from my personal point of view". This figurative usage of the expression as attested since 1760.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/point_of_view "Point of view."] Online Etymology Dictionary. Douglas Harper, Historian. 31 Aug. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In this meaning, the usage is synonymous with one of the meanings of the term '''perspective'''.&lt;ref name="Campos, Gutiérrez, p. 2"&gt;Campos, Gutiérrez, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LMPS14 /&gt;

==Analysis==
Margarita Vázquez Campos and Antonio Manuel Liz Gutiérrez in their work, "The Notion of Point of View", give a comprehensive analysis of the structure of the concept. They point out that despite being crucial in many discourses, the notion has not been adequately analyzed, though some important works do exist.&lt;ref name="Campos, Gutiérrez, p. 2"/&gt; They mention that early classical Greek philosophers, starting from [[Parmenides]] and [[Heraclitus]] discussed the relation between "appearance" and reality, i.e., how our points of view are connected with reality.&lt;ref&gt;Campos-Gutiérrez, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; They specifically point out [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s  ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]''. They consider Wittgenstein's theory of "pictures" or "models" (Wittgenstein used the German word ''Bild'', which means both "picture" and "model") as an illustration of the relationship between points of view and reality.&lt;ref&gt;Campos, Gutiérrez, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the "point of view" is highly multifunctional and ambiguous. Many things may be judged from certain personal, traditional or moral points of view (as in "the beauty is in the eye of the beholder"). Our knowledge about reality is often relative to a certain point of view.&lt;ref name="Campos, Gutiérrez, p. 2"/&gt;

Vázquez Campos and Manuel Liz Gutierrez suggested to analyse the concept of "point of view" using two approaches: one based on the concept of "[[propositional attitude]]s", the other on the concepts of "location" and "access".&lt;ref&gt;Manuel Liz, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

===Propositional attitudes===
{{expand section|date=August 2015}}
The internal structure of a point of view may be analysed similarly to the concept of a  propositional attitude. A propositional attitude is an attitude, i.e., a mental state held by an agent toward a [[proposition]]. Examples of such attitudes are "to believe in something", "to desire something", "to guess something", "to remember something", etc. Vazques Campos and Gutierrez  suggest that points of view may be analyzed as structured sets of propositional attitudes.&lt;ref&gt;Campos, Gutiérrez, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; The authors draw on [[Christopher Peacocke]]'s ''Sense and Content''.&lt;ref name=LMPS14/&gt;

Within this approach one may carry out [[ontology|ontological]] classification of various distinctions, such as individual vs. collective points of view, personal vs. non-personal,  non-conceptual vs. conceptual, etc.&lt;ref name=LMPS14&gt;Manuel Liz &amp; Margarita Vázquez, [https://www.academia.edu/913996/C2._Cognitive_Science_Two_approaches_to_the_notion_of_Point_of_View_Manuel_Liz_and_Margarita_V%C3%A1zquez "Two approaches to the notion of Point of View"], extended abstract for: [http://www.clmps2011.org/fileadmin/user_upload/VolumeOfAbstracts_FINAL.pdf ''14th Congress of Logic, Methodology and Philosophy of Science''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150920152028/http://www.clmps2011.org/fileadmin/user_upload/VolumeOfAbstracts_FINAL.pdf |date=2015-09-20 }}, July 19–26, 2011 (retrieved August 31, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Location and access===
{{expand section|date=August 2015}}
{{See also|Privileged access|Emic and etic}}
Whereas propositional attitudes approach is to analyze points of view internally, the "location/access" approach analyzes points of view externally, by their role. The term "access" refers to the statement of Liz Gutierrez that "points of views, or perspectives, are ways of having access to the world and to ourselves", and the term "location" is in reference to the provided quotation of [[Jon Moline]] that points of view are "ways of viewing things and events from certain locations". Moline rejects the notion that points of view are reducible to some rules based on some theories, maxims or dogmas. Moline considers the concept of "location" in two ways: in a direct way as a vantage point, and in an extended way, the way how a given vantage point provides a perspective, i.e., influences the perception.&lt;ref&gt;Moline, Jon, "On Points of View", American Philosophical Quarterly, 1968, vol. 5, 191–298. (as cited by Manuel Liz)&lt;/ref&gt;

This approach may address [[epistemology|epistemological]] issues, such as [[relativism]], existence of the absolute point of view, compatibility of points of view (including "[[faultless disagreement]]"), possibility of a point of view without a bearer, etc.&lt;ref name=LMPS14/&gt;

A '''pōwhiri''' (called a '''pōhiri''' in eastern dialects, and pronounced '''pōwiri''' in the Taranaki-Wanganui area) is a [[Māori culture|Māori]] welcoming [[ceremony]] involving speeches, dancing, singing and finally the ''[[hongi]]''. It is used to both welcome guests onto a [[marae]] or during other ceremonies, such as during a dedication of a building (where the owners or future users of the building might be welcomed). A pōwhiri may not be performed for every group of manuhiri (visitors); a ''mihi whakatau'' ("informal greeting to visitors") may be used instead. Pōwhiri is often used for special visitors or for ''tūpāpaku'' (the body of the deceased) for a [[tangihanga]] (funeral). However, pōwhiri are also often performed for tourist groups as part of special events.

For most non-Māori speakers the ''[[wero]]'', an aggressive challenge of the visitor at the beginning of the ceremony, is the most spectacular part of the pōwhiri.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11234005|title=Cheeky challenge sets off global media frenzy|date=8 April 2014|last=Tapaleao|first=Vaimoana|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|accessdate=8 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nzte.govt.nz/en/how-nzte-can-help/te-kete-tikanga-maori-cultural-kit/p%C5%8Dwhiri-welcome-ceremony/|title=Pōwhiri - Welcome Ceremony|date=14 May 2013|publisher=[[New Zealand Trade and Enterprise]]|accessdate=8 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this part of the ceremony, three Māori warriors&lt;ref name=teara /&gt; will advance cautiously towards the guests with ceremonial weapons and perform threatening gestures and grimaces, calling out battle screams and generally giving an impression of being ready to explode into violence against the visitors at any moment. The first warrior represents the realm of Tumatauenga, the Atua (God) of War. The third Warrior represents Rongo the Atua of Peace (Rangimarie).{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}  It is the final warrior who offers the rautapu, a signal that the manuhiri (guests) may enter the Marae-atea. Historically, it has roots in both showing off the martial prowess of the [[iwi]]'s warriors, as well as testing the steadfastness of the visitors. By accepting the ''rautapu'', a leaf or carved effigy, that the lead warrior will place on the ground before the visitors as a symbolic offering of peace, this part of the ceremony is concluded.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} 
On some occasions the pōwhiri begins before{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} the [[Karanga (Māori culture)|karanga]] (the call), at other times it begins after the karanga has started

At some point, the karanga and the pōwhiri will be taking place at the same time. For the pōwhiri, the kaikaranga (female caller) usually stands to the side and slightly to the front of the remainder of the [[tangata whenua]] (hosts). Those who take part in the pōwhiri include elders and young people (men/women). After the manuhiri (guests) and tangata whenua are seated, both sides will have speakers usually beginning with the tangata whenua, and final speaker from the manuhiri will often present [[Koha (custom)|koha]] to the tangata whenua. It is usually placed on the ground by the final speaker from the manuhiri. Once the speaker is seated, someone from the tangata whenua will pick it up.

The ceremonial [[Tapu (Polynesian culture)|tapu]] is lifted when tangata whenua and manuhiri make physical contact with [[hongi]] or shaking hands.&lt;ref name=teara&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/marae-protocol-te-kawa-o-te-marae/page-2|title=Marae protocol – te kawa o te marae - Pōwhiri process|last=Keane|first=Basil|date=21 August 2013|work=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]|accessdate=8 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Death of Jesus}}
{{Gospel Jesus}}

In the New Testament, the '''Sanhedrin trial of Jesus''' refers to the trial of [[Jesus]] before the [[Sanhedrin]] (a Jewish judicial body) following [[Arrest of Jesus|his arrest]] in [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]] and prior to his [[Pilate's court|dispensation by Pontius Pilate]]. It is an event reported by all four [[canonical gospels]] of the [[New Testament]], although [[John's Gospel]] does not explicitly mention a Sanhedrin trial in this context.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Mark|14:53–65|NIV}}, {{bibleverse||Matthew|26:57–68|NIV}}, {{bibleverse||Luke|22:63–71|NIV}}, and {{bibleverse||John|18:12–24|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jesus is generally quiet, does not mount a defense, and rarely responds to the accusations, but is condemned by the Jewish authorities when he will not deny that he is the [[Son of God]]. The Jewish leaders then take Jesus to [[Pontius Pilate]], the governor of [[Roman Judaea]], and ask that he be tried for claiming to be the [[Jesus, King of the Jews|King of the Jews]].

The trial as depicted in the [[Synoptic Gospels]] is temporally placed informally on Thursday night and then again formally on Friday morning. Although some believe this informally happened Wednesday night and then again finally on Thursday morning, with him eventually being taken off the cross Thursday night, being the beginning of the Jews 'day of preparation', according to account in the [[Gospel of John|Gospel of John.]]

==Trial==
In the narrative of all the canonical gospels, after the [[Kiss of Judas|betrayal]] and arrest of Jesus, he is taken to the Sanhedrin. From a historical perspective, in the era in which the narrative is set, the Sanhedrin body was an ''[[ad hoc]]'' gathering, rather than a fixed court.&lt;ref&gt;[[Raymond E. Brown|Brown, Raymond E.]] ''An Introduction to the New Testament'' Doubleday 1997 {{ISBN|0-385-24767-2}}, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; The portrayal of the Sanhedrin body contradicts that of Jewish tradition and texts, which portray the Sanhedrin to be an established court based in Jerusalem with strict guidelines on how to function&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/the-sanhedrin|title=The Sanhedrin|website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;. An entire [[Sanhedrin (tractate)|tractate]] explaining the Sanhedrin and its laws can be found in both the [[Mishnah|Mishna]] and [[Gemara]]. 

In the four canonical gospels, Jesus was tried and condemned by a majority of the Sanhedrin members, although at least one member, [[Joseph of Arimathea]], dissented from this decision.&lt;ref&gt;Luke 23:50-51&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus was [[Mocking of Jesus|mocked]] and beaten and condemned for making the claim of being the Son of God.&lt;ref name=Craig396 &gt;''Jesus and the Gospels: An Introduction and Survey'' by Craig L. Blomberg 2009 {{ISBN|0-8054-4482-3}} pages 396-400&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CEvans487 &gt;''The Bible Knowledge Background Commentary: Matthew-Luke, Volume 1'' by Craig A. Evans 2003 {{ISBN|0-7814-3868-3}} page 487-500&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Holman608 &gt;''Holman Concise Bible Dictionary'' 2011 {{ISBN|0-8054-9548-7}} pages 608-609&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Gospel accounts vary with respect to some of the details, they agree on the general character and overall structure of the trials of Jesus.&lt;ref name=GBromiley1050 &gt;''The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia'' by Geoffrey W. Bromiley 1982 {{ISBN|0-8028-3782-4}} pages 1050-1052&lt;/ref&gt;

[[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#26:57|Matthew 26:57]] states that Jesus was taken to the house of [[Caiaphas]] the [[High Priest]], where the scribes and the elders were gathered together. [[Matthew 27:1]] adds that, the next morning, the priests held another meeting. [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#14:53|Mark 14:53]] states that Jesus was taken that night "to the high priest" (without naming the priest), where all the chief priests and the elders gathered, and [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#15:1|Mark 15:1]] adds that another consultation was held among the priests the next morning. [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#22:54|Luke 22:54]] states that Jesus was taken to "the high priest's house" (without naming the priest), where he was mocked and beaten that night. It is added in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#22:66|22:66]] that, "as soon as it was day", the chief priests and scribes gathered together and led Jesus away into their council.&lt;ref name=Craig396 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CEvans487 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Holman608 /&gt;

In [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#18:12|John 18:12-14]], however, Jesus is first taken to [[Annas]], the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was the [[List of High Priests of Israel|high priest]] at that time. Annas is believed to have been the former high priest, and it appears that Caiaphas sought Annas' confirmation of Caiaphas' actions. In [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#18:28|18:24]], Jesus is sent from Annas to Caiaphas the high priest, and [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#18:28|18:28]] states that, in the morning, Jesus was led from Caiaphas to [[Pontius Pilate]] in the [[Praetorium#Biblical reference|Praetorium]].&lt;ref name=Craig396 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CEvans487 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Holman608 /&gt;

In all four Gospel accounts, the trial of Jesus before the priests and scribes is interleaved with the [[Denial of Peter]] narrative, where [[Apostle Peter]], who has followed Jesus, denies knowing him three times.&lt;ref name=Bromiley105 &gt;''Theological dictionary of the New Testament'' by Gerhard Kittel, Geoffrey William Bromiley, Gerhard Friedrich 1980 {{ISBN|0-8028-2248-7}} page 105&lt;/ref&gt; [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#22:61|Luke 22:61]] states that as Jesus was bound and standing at the priest's house Peter was in the courtyard. Jesus "turned and looked straight at him", and Peter remembered the words Jesus had spoken to him: "Before the [[rooster]] crows today, you will disown me three times."&lt;ref name=Craig396 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CEvans487 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Holman608 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bromiley105 /&gt;

In the Gospel accounts, Jesus speaks very little, and gives very infrequent and indirect answers to the questions of the priests, prompting an officer to slap him. In [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#26:62|Matthew 26:62]], the lack of response from Jesus prompts the high priest to ask him: "Answerest thou nothing?" In the Gospel accounts, the men that hold Jesus at the high priest's house mock, blindfold, insult and beat him, at times slapping him and asking him to guess who had hit him that time.&lt;ref name=Craig396 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CEvans487 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Holman608 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#26:67|Matthew 26:67]] [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#14:65|Mark 14:65]] [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#22:63|Luke 22:63-65]] [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#18:22|John 18:22]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#14:55|Mark 14:55–59]] states that the chief priests had sought witness against Jesus to put him to death but did not find any, so they arranged false witness against him, but their witnesses did not agree together. [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#14:61|Mark 14:61]] states that the high priest then asked Jesus: "Art thou the [[Christ]], the Son of the Blessed?" And Jesus said "I am", at which point the high priest tore his own robe in anger and accused Jesus of blasphemy. In [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#26:63|Matthew 26:63]], the high priest asks: "tell us whether you are the Christ, the Son of God." Jesus responds "You have said it", prompting the High Priest to tear his own robe,&lt;ref name=Craig396 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CEvans487 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Holman608 /&gt; breaking [[Mosaic Law]] ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Leviticus#21:10|Leviticus 21:10]]).

In [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#22:67|Luke 22:67]], Jesus is asked: "If thou art the Christ, tell us. But he said unto them, If I tell you, ye will not believe". But, in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#22:70|22:70]], when asked "Are you then the Son of God?", Jesus answers "You say that I am", affirming the title Son of God.&lt;ref&gt;''Luke's presentation of Jesus: a christology'' by Robert F. O'Toole 2004 {{ISBN|88-7653-625-6}} page 166&lt;/ref&gt; At that point, the priests say "What further need have we of witness? for we ourselves have heard from his own mouth", and they decide to condemn Jesus.&lt;ref name=Craig396 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CEvans487 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Holman608 /&gt;

Thereafter, in [[Pilate's Court]], the Jewish elders ask Pontius Pilate to judge and condemn Jesus, accusing him of claiming to be the [[Jesus, King of the Jews|King of the Jews]]. Such a claim would be considered treasonous, being a direct challenge to the Roman authorities.&lt;ref name=Holman608 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12114">'''Show Me Shorts''' is [[New Zealand]]'s leading international short film festival. It screens a selection of short films from New Zealand and around the world in cinemas nationwide each Spring.

Show Me Shorts is a charitable (not-for-profit) organisataion that has three aims:

1.     To connect New Zealanders with the best short films from around the world

2.     To celebrate excellence in short film making

3.     To foster the New Zealand short film community

Each year approximately 50 top short films are selected and contend for awards. Both international and [[New Zealand]] films are eligible. The festival awards are then presented to the top filmmakers at the opening night and awards ceremony in [[Auckland]].

Show Me Shorts is New Zealand’s first [[Academy Awards]]®-accredited festival, with the Best Film and Best International Film award winners becoming eligible for nomination for the [[Academy Award|Oscars]]®.

The programme covers a diverse range of themes and subjects including documentary, sci-fi, horror, drama, animation and comedy. Judges from the local film industry decide the winners of the awards.

As of 2014, Show Me Shorts Film Festival also accepts music videos as part of a new New Zealand music video competitive category.

There are a number of supporting events such as a lab for screenwriters and filmmaker talks for aspiring filmmakers that run as part of the festival.

== History ==
Show Me Shorts Film Festival Trust is a registered charitable trust founded in [[Auckland]], New Zealand in 2006 by Gina Dellabarca, Tamara Liebman, Katrin Hagen and Kate Nicholson.

The first screenings took place at Auckland's Academy Cinema in November, 2006. The following year the festival expanded to a full week in Auckland, plus screenings in Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin. Every year since then, more locations and venues have been added to the circuit. There are now over 20 regular venues across New Zealand.

In 2013 Show Me Shorts gained Academy Awards-accreditation for their Best International Film Award. This milestone recognised the quality of the programming, and allowed the festival to provide a pathway to the Oscars for filmmakers. In 2016 the festival additionally acquired Academy Awards-accreditation for their Best International Film Award.

In 2014 the Opening Night and Awards Ceremony took place at the iconic picture palace, The Civic, in Auckland. This venue has since become a fixture for the festival.

The '''Teatro delle Dame''', also known as the '''Teatro Alibert''' (its original name), was a theatre in Rome built in 1718 and located on what is now the corner of Via D'Alibert and [[Via Margutta]]. In the course of its history it underwent a series of reconstructions and renovations until it was definitively destroyed by a fire in 1863. In their 18th-century heyday, the Teatro delle Dame and its rival, the [[Teatro Capranica]], were the leading opera houses in Rome and saw many world premieres performed by some of the most prominent singers of the time. 
==History==
The theatre was built by Antonio D'Alibert for the performance of ''[[opera seria]]''. It was a project long planned by his father Jacques D'Alibert (1626–1713) who had been the secretary to [[Queen Christina of Sweden]] and had managed the [[Tor di Nona|Teatro Tordinona]]. The Teatro Tordinona was Rome's first public theatre but was demolished in 1697 on the orders of [[Pope Innocent XII]] who considered public theatres a corrupting influence on the populace. 
[[File:Teatro delle Dame floor plan, 1760-61.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|Floor plan of the theatre in 1761]]
The Teatro Alibert (as it was then called) was constructed in wood on a piece of land formerly used for playing [[pallacorda]] (a game similar to [[real tennis]]). According to the Italian theatre historian Saverio Franchi, the architect supervising the construction was probably Matteo Sassi (1646–1723).&lt;ref name = "Franchi"&gt;Franchi, Saverio (1997). [https://books.google.com/books?id=HCUwopOtrLgC&amp;pg=PR48 ''Drammaturgia romana''], Vol. 2, pp. xxvii; xlviii. Edizioni di Storia e Letteratura {{it}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it was inaugurated in 1718 with the premiere of [[Francesco Mancini (composer)|Francesco Mancini]]'s opera ''Alessandro Severo'', the Teatro Alibert was the largest theatre in Rome with seven tiers of 32 boxes each. In 1720 [[Francesco Galli Bibiena]] enlarged and redesigned the interior, reshaping the auditorium into a "phonetic curve" (midway between a rectangle and a horseshoe).&lt;ref name = "Nicassio"&gt;Nicassio, Susan Vandiver (2002). [https://books.google.com/books?id=poDHquurm24C&amp;pg=PA82 ''Tosca's Rome: The Play and the Opera in Historical Perspective''], pp. 81–82. University of Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Lynn"&gt;Lynn, Karyl Charna (2005). [https://books.google.com/books?id=eQK2AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA241 ''Italian Opera Houses and Festivals''], p. 241. Scarecrow Press&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatre was an artistic success but not a financial one. Matters were not helped by the [[Jubilee (Christianity)|Jubilee Year]] of 1725 when all Roman theatres were closed for the duration. Antonio D'Alibert went bankrupt and the Roman authorities put the theatre up for auction in 1726. It was bought by a consortium of Roman nobility and renamed the Teatro delle Dame.&lt;ref name = "Franchi" /&gt; The theatre's management eventually passed to the [[Knights of Malta]], with whom some members of the consortium had close links. The order was to maintain control of the theatre until well into the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Markstrom, Kurt Sven (2007). [https://books.google.com/books?id=GpedtmXE6tIC&amp;pg=PA137 ''The Operas of Leonardo Vinci, Napoletano''], pp. 137–138. Pendragon Press&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1730s, the building underwent extensive renovation and embellishment designed by the architect [[Ferdinando Fuga]] and reopened in 1738 with a performance of [[Nicola Logroscino]]'s opera ''Quinto Fabio''. 

By the 19th century, the Teatro delle Dame (like its rival the [[Teatro Capranica]]) had ceased being a leading opera house in the city. Operas were still performed there, but it was increasingly used for public balls, acrobatic shows, and plays written in the local [[Roman dialect]].&lt;ref name = "Groppi" /&gt; Prince Alessandro [[Torlonia]] acquired the theatre in 1847 and had it reconstructed in brick with an even larger stage which could accommodate equestrian shows. On the night of 15 February 1863, the theatre caught fire yet again and was completely destroyed. Later, an inn known as the Locanda Alibert was constructed on the site. In the early 2000s the Locanda Alibert building was completely restructured and turned into a congress and event centre.&lt;ref&gt;Costantini, Emilia (14 December 2005).

==Opera premieres==
[[File:Teresa Bertinotti.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Teresa Bertinotti]], the first woman to sing at the Teatro delle Dame]]
Throughout most of the 18th century, women were forbidden to perform on stage in the [[Papal States]]. During that period operas were sung at the Teatro delle Dame by all-male casts with [[castrati]] singing the female roles. Amongst the famous castrato singers to appear there were [[Farinelli]], [[Giacinto Fontana]] ("Farfallino"), [[Giovanni Carestini]], and [[Luigi Marchesi]]. From 1798 when Rome came under [[Roman Republic (18th century)|French rule]], women began appearing on the theatre's stage—the first one was the soprano [[Teresa Bertinotti]].&lt;ref name = "Groppi" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Nicassio" /&gt;

'''''Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl''''' is an original [[radio play]] by author [[Meyer Levin]] (1905–1981). It was adapted from Levin’s original stage dramatization of the same name, adapted from ''[[The Diary of a Young Girl]]'', [[Anne Frank]]'s diary. It aired on [[CBS Radio|CBS]] on September 18, 1952, the eve of [[Rosh Hashanah]], to critical acclaim, and again in November 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center at Boston University|url=http://www.bu.edu/phpbin/search/?t=gotlieb&amp;col=gotlieb&amp;dir=0&amp;maps=0&amp;q=Meyer+Levin&amp;Search=Search}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meyer Levin==
Author Meyer Levin was born in 1905 to Jewish immigrants in [[Chicago]]. He began a [[journalism]] career at the age of 16 when he started reporting for the ''[[Chicago Daily News]]''. In 1943 Levin was based in [[London]] as a [[war correspondent]]. He followed the stories of American Jewish soldiers and Germany’s genocidal campaign. Levin was one of the first American journalists to enter a work camp, [[Ohrdruf]], then Bergen-Belsen, [[Dachau]], and more. He suffered tremendous guilt as witness to the atrocities and wrote of his inability to tell the story of the Jews of Europe. That changed when he encountered ''The Diary of Anne Frank'', the first personal diary to emerge from the war. Levin wrote to [[Otto Frank]] and met with him before leaving Europe, inquiring into the American publication and dramatic rights. He was the first to see the dramatic potential of the Diary.
&lt;ref name="In Search"&gt;{{cite book|last=Levin|first=Meyer|title=In Search|year=1950|publisher=Authors Press|location=Paris, France|pages=524}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anne Frank Fonds|url=http://www.annefrank.ch/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==The Reappearance==
Producer [[Jennifer Strome]] discovered the Radio Play script in 1999 while researching Levin’s life story. She met a member of Levin’s family and was captivated by Levin’s history with the ''Diary of Anne Frank'' stage play. She contacted Levin’s son Mikael Levin who introduced her to his mother, French author [[Tereska Torres]], and to Levin’s vast collection of books and films. 

With permission from Torres, Strome began her research in earnest at the Howard Gotleib Archival Research Center of rare book and manuscript collections at [[Boston University]]. More than 50 boxes of personal letters, trial transcripts, and articles belonging to Meyer Levin were made available. It was there that she came across Levin’s original, annotated script for the Radio Play, a document Levin’s family had never seen. It is a historical piece of literature that had fallen into obscurity after what appeared as a controversy between Levin and Otto Frank.

Strome's effort to restore Levin's radio play as part of Anne Frank's legacy of dramatic adaptations resulted in a North American Educational Initiative, [http://annefrankunites.org annefrankunites.org], as a contribution to the fight against intolerance. Strome was authorized by the Anne Frank Fonds, Basel Switzerland ([http://AnneFrank.ch AnneFrank.ch]) to provide the materials with Limited Use July 15th 2013-2015.

==2009 Live Performance ==
On September 14, 2009, Strome produced a private, live performance of Levin’s Radio Play at the [[Museum of Jewish Heritage]]--A Living Memorial to the Holocaust in NYC. It was the first time the play was heard since its original air date in 1952. This performance marks the first time that the [[Anne Frank Fonds]] in Basel, Switzerland, acknowledged Meyer Levin’s work on the Diary. The Museum performance was followed by a panel discussion moderated by Neil Baldwin, PhD and featuring author Cynthia Ozick and Strome.

'''Tim Soar''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[fashion designer]], [[graphic designer]], [[event planner]] and [[DJ]].

==Career==
Soar began his creative career working with designer [[Neville Brody]] on an interiors project POST Design.  This was followed by independent practice as a graphic designer, and then in the design company STAC collaborating with photographer [[Andrew Catlin]]. His work was focussed in music, producing artwork for numerous international record sleeves, publications and campaigns.

==Career as a DJ==
While working with Neville Brody, Soar became involved in the music industry and began working as a DJ. Soar had residencies at a number of venues and clubs across London. He was also involved in the writing and arrangement of [[23 Skidoo (band)|23 Skidoo]]'s song ''Just Like Everybody''. He was also part of the band called Toll, which released the album ''Christ Knows'' in 2006.

==Design label==
In 2005, Soar launched the Tim Soar design label and this was described as “really well-made menswear that mixes minimalism, sportswear, tailoring, and unusual fabrications.”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://londonfashionweek.co.uk/designers_profile.aspx?DesignerID=1162|title=London Fashion Week - Tim Soar|website=londonfashionweek.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview, Soar described his foray from music to fashion design with these words:&lt;blockquote&gt;I felt that I had something to say about modern menswear and that it was time to move on from the flippant to something more serious. I was tired of seeing gimmicky menswear that was badly made and did not fit correctly. I set out to produce clothes that are a synthesis of minimalism and the avant garde made to the highest possible standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.notjustalabel.com/designer/soar|title=Soar {{!}} NOT JUST A LABEL|website=www.notjustalabel.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The first collection was presented by the London-based B-Store, the second collection by [[Liberty (department store)|Liberty]], and has continued with packed shows at each [[London Fashion Week]] since Spring/Summer 09.

The '''Top League Championship''' is Japan's highest-level knockout tournament for [[rugby union]] clubs. Held annually, the leading teams from the [[Top League]] regular season qualify for the playoffs to decide the Cup title. From 2018 onward, the All-Japan Rugby Football Championship has doubled as the Top League Championship Cup. Previously, teams competed for the Lixil Cup, from 2014 to 2016,&lt;ref name= jt-2014/&gt; and Microsoft Cup (prior to 2009).

The Top League competition is a Japanese industrial league that presently consists of sixteen teams, all owned by major companies. 

{{toc level|3}}

Initially sponsored by [[Microsoft Japan]], the knockout tournament was first contested by the top eight teams from the Top League in 2004. It was considered a separate competition to the Top League for the first three seasons but was officially integrated for the 2006–07 season. The number of teams was also cut to four to give a format of two semi-finals and a final, and from that time onward until the 2016–17 season the winner of the knockout cup was recognised as the Top League champion.

There were no title-play-offs in 2016–17, and the team on top of the league after the round-robin stage won the Top League title.

For the 2006–07 season the tournament was expanded to fourteen teams and the Top League and Microsoft Cup competitions were combined. Only the top four teams on the regular season table progressed to title play-offs and the winner of the knockout competition was awarded both the Microsoft Cup and the Top League title.

Video referee (TMO) decisions were introduced for the 2009 Cup series. The naming rights partnership with Microsoft for the knockout competition ended after the 2009 Cup final.

'''USS ''N-3'' (SS-55)''' was a [[United States N class submarine|''N''-class coastal defense submarine]] of the [[United States Navy]].  Her keel was laid down on 31 July 1915 by the [[Seattle Construction and Drydock]] Company. She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 21 February 1917 sponsored by Miss Bertha Coontz, daughter of the [[commandant]] of [[Puget Sound Navy Yard]], and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 26 September 1917 with Lieutenant William R. Munroe in command. ''N-3'' was the last submarine constructed in Seattle.

==Service history==
Following sea trials in [[Puget Sound]], ''N-3'', with sister ships {{USS|N-1|SS-53|3}} and {{USS|N-2|SS-54|3}}, departed the Navy Yard on 21 November 1917. The three submarines arrived at [[New London, Connecticut]], on 7 February 1918.  From here, ''N-3'' patrolled along the [[New England]] coast and off [[Long Island]]. On 23 July, a British steamer mistook ''N-3'' as a German [[U-boat]] and fired on her at a range of only 50&amp;nbsp;yards.  Although hit by a six-inch shell, the submarine suffered only slight damage and after repairs at sea, was able to proceed to [[New York Navy Yard]] under her own power. Following permanent repairs, ''N-3'' returned to the Submarine School, New London for patrol and training duty through 1920.

Departing New London on 1 June 1921, ''N-3'' sailed for [[Toledo, Ohio]]. One of the first submarines to navigate the [[St. Lawrence River]] and the [[Great Lakes]], she put in at [[City of Halifax|Halifax, Nova Scotia]], [[Montreal]], Quebec, and [[Port Dalhousie]] before arriving [[Toledo, Ohio]], on 25 June. She remained there for 11 days, open to the public for inspection. Departing on 6 July, she returned to New London, arriving on 20 July, and from there cruised along the East Coast from Halifax to [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], conducting training cruises. Departing New London, she sailed for the [[Philadelphia Navy Yard]], where she decommissioned on 30 April 1926. She was struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] on 18 December 1930 and was scrapped in mid-1931.

The first ''' Woman's World's Fair ''' was held in [[Chicago]] in 1925. The idea of the completely women-run fair was to display the progress of ideas, work, and products of twentieth-century women.

== Description ==
The first Women's World's Fair was held April 18–25 of 1925 in Chicago at the [[680 N Lake Shore Drive|American Furniture Mart Building]] and officially opened by First Lady [[Grace Coolidge]].{{sfn|Kane|1997|page=125}}&lt;ref name=Am_Insur&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |last2= |first2= |date= |title=1925 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AxvxAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=The+first+Woman%E2%80%99s+World+Fair+was+held+in+Chicago+on+April+18%E2%80%9325,+1925.&amp;dq=The+first+Woman%E2%80%99s+World+Fair+was+held+in+Chicago+on+April+18%E2%80%9325,+1925. |journal=Journal of American Insurance |publisher= |volume=40 |issue= |page=8 |quote=First Woman's World Fair opened April 18 in Chicago by Mrs. Calvin Coolidge, First Lady of the U.S. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The eight-day fair was the idea of [[Helen Bennett (journalist)|Helen Bennett]]{{sfn|Ganz|2012|page=101}} and [[Ruth Hanna McCormick]]. It was run entirely by women and consisted of 280 booths representing some seventy women occupations. The fair drew about 200,000 visitors, earning a net of some $50,000.&lt;ref name=Sawyers&gt;{{cite news |last=Sawyers  |first=June |date=May 15, 1988 |title=A Fair First In The Women's Movement |url= http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1988-05-15/features/8803160977_1_women-s-movement-cow-helen-bennett |newspaper= Chicage Tribune |location= Chicago, Il|access-date=September 4, 2015|quote=On April 25, 1925, the first Woman's World Fair closed a successful eight-day run at the Furniture Mart on North Lake Shore Drive. The fair, which highlighted women`s achievements in art, commerce and industry, attracted more than 200,000 visitors, presented more than 100 exhibitions of women in business and earned a net income of $50,000. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fair's purpose was to display women's ideas, work, and products for the twentieth century. At the 1876 [[Centennial Exposition]] there had been a Women's Pavilion funded and organized by women and in particular [[Elizabeth Duane Gillespie]]. The building was over {{convert|200|sqft}} and it was in the shape of a [[Maltese cross]].&lt;ref name=firstww&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/centennialexposi00ingr#page/116/mode/2up/search/gillespie+pavilion Women's pavilion], The Centennial Exposition, Page 116, Retrieved 11 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The Chicago World's Fair of 1893 demonstrated some women's handicrafts in a sewing exhibit, but this fair was to show the progress women had made in seventy industries since then.{{sfn|Kane|1997|page=125}} A side benefit of the fair was that it raised money for the women's [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] organizations. The exhibits showed women's accomplishments in the arts, literature, science, and industry. These exhibits were also an inspiration to young women in their new careers. One of the exhibitors was [[Illinois Bell Telephone Company]]. Others were newspapers, manufacturers, hospitals, banks, and retail stores. Many local enterprises had employment opportunities.{{r|Enc_of_Chicago}}

Women lawyers, inventors, and artists had booths demonstrating women's contributions in these fields. As an example, American sculptor [[Harriet Whitney Frishmuth]] was represented by her 1920 bronze work ''Joy of the Waters''.{{sfn|Gerdts|1989|page=128}} Women's organizations were represented by the [[Women's Trade Union League]], Business and Professional Women's Club, the Visiting Nurse Association, the [[YWCA]], [[Hull House]], the Illinois Club for Catholic Women, and the Auxiliary House of the Good Shepherd.&lt;ref name=Enc_of_Chicago&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Woman's World's Fair, 1925 |URL= http://encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1374.html |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Chicago |author=Maureen A.

== Speeches ==
A group of about one thousand women from [[Sycamore, Illinois]], on April 23 had breakfast with famous women. An all woman's orchestra furnished music. The speakers were women of notoriety which included women authors, business women, and various women artisans. The speeches were limited to five minutes. The main speaker was [[Nellie Tayloe Ross]], the only state governor there. Another speaker was the collector of internal revenue of Chicago. Another was the secretary of the Cabinet Department of Commerce for President [[Herbert Hoover]]. The medical profession was represented by Dr. [[Alice Hamilton]] of [[Harvard University]]. The legal profession was represented by Judge [[Kathryn Sellers]] of [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref name=True_Repub&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Woman's World's Fair in Chicago |url= |newspaper=The True Republican |location=Sycamore, Illinois |date=April 29, 1925 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Program ==
Whiting Hall was visited by the women after the speeches. The booths where artistically decorated showing some of a hundred or so different occupations in which women were employed. Some of these were antique needlework, pottery, silver fox farming, and goat breeding. Examples that received special attention were nurses and welfare workers. A key note was emphasis on earnestness, punctuality and thoroughness in whatever line of work was undertaken.&lt;ref name=True_Repub/&gt;

A unique feature of the first Woman's World's Fair was a daily program. There was a particular topic for each day. Besides being instructive it was entertaining. Music and dancing were especially emphasized each day. Bennett was the general director of the fair. The woman's fair was a success and held for three additional years.&lt;ref name=Enc_of_Chicago/&gt;&lt;ref name=True_Repub/&gt;

Women have engaged in [[philosophy]] throughout the field's history. While there were women [[philosopher]]s since ancient times, and a relatively small number were accepted as philosophers during the [[ancient philosophy|ancient]], [[Medieval philosophy|medieval]], [[Modern philosophy|modern]] and [[Contemporary philosophy|contemporary]] eras, particularly during the 20th and 21st century, almost no woman philosophers have entered the philosophical [[Western canon]].&lt;ref name="Duran, Jane 2005"&gt;Duran, Jane. Eight women philosophers: theory, politics, and feminism. University of Illinois Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="read.hipporeads.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://read.hipporeads.com/why-i-left-academia-philosophys-homogeneity-needs-rethinking/#|title=Why I Left Academia: Philosophy’s Homogeneity Needs Rethinking - Hippo Reads|author=|date=|website=read.hipporeads.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[ancient philosophy]] in the West, while academic philosophy was typically the domain of male philosophers such as [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], female philosophers such as [[Hipparchia of Maroneia]] (active ca. 325 BC), [[Arete of Cyrene]] (active 5th–4th century BC) and [[Aspasia of Miletus]] (470–400 BC) were active during this period. Notable [[medieval philosophy|medieval philosophers]] include [[Hypatia]] (5th century), [[St. Hildegard of Bingen]] (1098-1179) and [[St. Catherine of Sienna]] (1347-1380). Notable [[Modern philosophy|modern philosophers]] included [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] (1759-1797) and [[Sarah Margaret Fuller]] (1810-1850). Influential [[Contemporary philosophy|contemporary philosophers]] include [[Susanne Langer]] (1895–1985), [[Hannah Arendt]] (1906–1975), [[Simone de Beauvoir]] (1908–1986), [[Mary Midgley]] (born 1919), [[Mary Warnock]] (born 1924), [[Julia Kristeva]] (born 1941), [[Patricia Churchland]] (born 1943) and [[Susan Haack]] (born 1945).

In the early 1800s, some colleges and universities in the UK and US began [[Mixed-sex education#Higher-education institutions|admitting women]], giving rise to new generations of female academics. Nevertheless, [[U.S. Department of Education]] reports from the 1990s indicate that [[philosophy]] is one of the least proportionate fields in the [[humanities]] with respect to gender.&lt;ref name="Salary, Promotion 1997"&gt;"Salary, Promotion, and Tenure Status of Minority and Women Faculty in U.S. Colleges and Universities."National Center for Education Statistics, Statistical Analysis Report, March 2000; U.S. Department of Education, Office of Education Research and Improvement, Report # NCES 2000–173;1993 National Study of Postsecondary Faculty (NSOPF:93). See also "Characteristics and Attitudes of Instructional Faculty and Staff in the Humanities." National Center For Education Statistics, E.D. Tabs, July 1997. U.S. Department of Education, Office of Education Research and Improvement, Report # NCES 97-973;1993 National Study of Postsecondary Faculty (NSOPF-93).&lt;/ref&gt; Women make up as little as 17% of philosophy faculty in some studies.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;U.S. Department of Education statistics in above-cited reports seem to put the number closer to 17%, but these numbers are based on data from the mid-1990s. [[Margaret Urban Walker]]'s more recent article (2005) discusses the data problem and describes more recent estimates as an "(optimistically projected) 25–30 percent."&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, ''[[Inside Higher Education]]'' described the philosophy "...discipline’s own long history of [[misogyny]] and [[sexual harassment]]" of women students and professors.&lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/05/19/unofficial-internet-campaign-outs-professor-alleged-sexual-harassment-attempted|title=Unofficial Internet campaign outs professor for alleged sexual harassment, attempted assault|author=|date=|website=insidehighered.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jennifer Saul]], a professor of philosophy at the [[University of Sheffield]], stated in 2015 that women are "...leaving philosophy after being harassed, assaulted, or retaliated against."&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2015/jan/05/philosophy-is-for-posh-white-boys-with-trust-funds-why-are-there-so-few-women|title=Philosophy is for posh, white boys with trust funds' – why are there so few women?|first1=Rebecca|last1=Ratcliffe|first2=Claire|last2=Shaw|date=5 January 2015|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1990s, the [[Canadian Philosophical Association]] claimed that there is gender imbalance and [[gender bias]] in the academic field of philosophy.&lt;ref name="nas.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nas.org/articles/women_in_philosophy_problems_with_the_discrimination_hypothesis|title=Women in Philosophy: Problems with the Discrimination Hypothesis - National Association of Scholars|author=|date=|website=www.nas.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013, a US sociology professor stated that "out of all recent citations in four prestigious philosophy journals, female authors comprise just 3.6 percent of the total." The editors of the [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] have raised concerns about the underrepresentation of women philosophers, and they require editors and writers to ensure they represent the contributions of women philosophers.&lt;ref name="nas.org"/&gt; According to Eugene Sun Park, "[p]hilosophy is predominantly white and predominantly male. This homogeneity exists in almost all aspects and at all levels of the discipline."&lt;ref name="read.hipporeads.com"/&gt; Susan Price argues that the philosophical "...canon remains dominated by white males—the discipline that...still hews to the myth that genius is tied to gender."&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/05/reviving-the-female-canon/393110/|title=Reviving the Female Canon|first=Susan|last=Price|date=13 May 2015|website=theatlantic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Saul, "[p]hilosophy, the oldest of the [[humanities]], is also the malest (and the whitest).  While other areas of the humanities are at or near gender parity, philosophy is actually more overwhelmingly male than even mathematics."&lt;ref name="salon.com"/&gt;

==Representation and working climate==
[[File:Martha Nussbaum wikipedia 10-10.jpg|thumb|right|200px|American philosopher [[Martha Nussbaum]], who completed a PhD in philosophy at [[Harvard University]] in 1975, alleges that she encountered a tremendous amount of discrimination at Harvard, including sexual harassment and problems getting childcare.&lt;ref name="berkeley.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globetrotter.berkeley.edu/people6/Nussbaum/nussbaum-con1.html|title=Conversation with Martha C. Nussbaum, p. 1 of 6|work=berkeley.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]
In the early 1990s, the [[Canadian Philosophical Association]] claimed that "...there is compelling evidence" of "...philosophy’s gender imbalance" and "bias and partiality in many of its theoretical products." In 1992, the association recommended that "fifty percent of [philosophy]...positions should be filled by women.”&lt;ref name="nas.org"/&gt; In a 2008 article “Changing the Ideology and Culture of Philosophy: Not by Reason (Alone),” MIT philosophy professor [[Sally Haslanger]] stated that the top twenty graduate programs in philosophy in the US have from 4 percent to 36 percent women faculty.&lt;ref name="nas.org"/&gt; In June 2013, Duke University professor of sociology Kieran Healy stated that "out of all recent citations in four prestigious philosophy journals, female authors comprise just 3.6 percent of the total." The editors of the [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] have raised concerns about the underrepresentation of women philosophers; as such, the encyclopedia “encourage[s] [their] authors, subject editors, and referees to help ensure that SEP entries do not overlook the work of women or indeed of members of underrepresented groups more generally.”&lt;ref name="nas.org"/&gt;

In 2014, philosophy professors Neven Sesardic and Rafael De Clercq published an article entitled "Women in Philosophy: Problems with the Discrimination Hypothesis." The article states that a "...number of philosophers attribute the underrepresentation of women in philosophy largely to [[gender bias|bias against women]] or some kind of wrongful [[discrimination]]". Evidence cited includes "gender disparities that increase along the path from undergraduate student to full-time faculty member"; "anecdotal accounts of discrimination in philosophy"; "research on gender bias in the evaluation of manuscripts, grants, and curricula vitae in other academic disciplines"; "psychological research on implicit bias"; "psychological research on [[stereotype threat]]" and the "...relatively small number of articles written from a feminist perspective in leading philosophy journals".&lt;ref name="nas.org"/&gt; Sesardic and De Clercq argue that "proponents of the discrimination hypothesis, who include distinguished philosophers ...have tended to present evidence selectively."&lt;ref name="nas.org"/&gt;

American philosopher [[Sally Haslanger]] stated in 2008 that "...it is very hard to find a place in philosophy that isn’t actively hostile towards women and minorities, or at least assumes that a successful philosopher should look and act like a (traditional, white) man.”&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/25/philosphy-women-warnock-baggini-debate|title=Does philosophy have a problem with women?|first1=Mary|last1=Warnock|first2=Julian|last2=Baggini|date=25 July 2015|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haslanger states that she experienced “occasions when a woman’s status in graduate school was questioned because she was married, or had a child (or had taken time off to have a child so was returning to philosophy as a ‘mature’ student), or was in a long-distance relationship". American philosopher [[Martha Nussbaum]], who completed a PhD in philosophy at [[Harvard University]] in 1975, alleges that she encountered a tremendous amount of discrimination during her studies at Harvard, including sexual harassment and problems getting childcare for her daughter.&lt;ref name="berkeley.edu"/&gt;

In July 2015, British philosopher [[Mary Warnock]] addressed the issue of the representation of women in British university philosophy departments, where 25% of faculty are women. Warnock stated she is "... against intervention, by [[Hiring quota|quota]]s or otherwise, to increase women’s chances of employment" in philosophy.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt; She also argues that "... there is nothing intrinsically harmful about this imbalance" and she states that she does not "...believe it shows a conscious bias against women." &lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt; Philosopher [[Julian Baggini]] states that he believes that there is "...little or no conscious discrimination against women in philosophy". At the same time, Baggini states that there may be a "...great deal of unconscious bias" against women in philosophy, because philosophy generally does not address issues of gender or ethnicity.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt;

===Allegations of sexual harassment===
In 2014, ''[[Inside Higher Education]]'' described the philosophy "...discipline’s own long history of misogyny and sexual harassment."&lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"/&gt; On March 28, 2011, the blog ''New APPS'' published a post examining the allegations of persistent [[sexual harassment]] faced by women professors in philosophy, due largely to "serial harassers" continuing to work in the field despite widespread knowledge of their actions. The post proposed that, since institutional procedures seemed to have been ineffective at removing or punishing harassers, philosophers should socially shun known offenders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newappsblog.com/2011/03/what-is-to-be-done-about-sexual-harassment-in-the-philosophy-profession.html What is to be done about sexual harassment in the philosophy profession? – New APPS: Art, Politics, Philosophy, Science].

According to Heidi Lockwood, an associate professor of philosophy at [[Southern Connecticut State University]], there is a "...power “asymmetry” between professors and students – even graduate students"; as well, she noted that "...even when colleges and universities have blanket prohibitions against professor-student sexual relationships, as does Yale,...institution-specific policies leave students vulnerable [to sexual advances from faculty] at conferences."&lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"/&gt;
 
According to an August 2013 article in ''Salon'', a tenured male University of Miami philosopher resigned after allegedly "...sending emails to a [female] student in which he suggested that they have sex three times."&lt;ref name="salon.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2013/08/15/philosophy_has_a_sexual_harassment_problem/|title=Philosophy has a sexual harassment problem|author=|date=15 August 2013|website=salon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jennifer Saul]], a professor of philosophy at the [[University of Sheffield]], set up a blog for women philosophers in 2010. She received numerous allegations of [[sexual harassment]] by male philosophy faculty, including a "job candidate who said she was sexually assaulted at the annual APA meeting where job interviews take place", an "undergraduate whose professor joked publicly about dripping hot wax on her nipples" and a "... lesbian who found herself suddenly invited, after she came out, to join in the sexualizing of her female colleagues." Saul states that philosophy departments failed to deal with the allegations.&lt;ref name="salon.com"/&gt; In 2013, the [[American Philosophical Association]] formed a committee to study the allegations of sexual harassment of women students and professors by male philosophy faculty.&lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"/&gt; Saul states that one of the allegations was regarding a "...distinguished visiting speaker whose first words are: “Show me a grad student I can fuck”." &lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Saul states that women are "...leaving philosophy after being harassed, assaulted, or retaliated against." &lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; In 2014, ''Inside Higher Education'' reported allegations that a [[Yale University]] philosophy professor had sexually harassed a woman; the "alleged victim says she reported the professor to Yale, with no real result".&lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"/&gt;
In an interview with ''Inside Higher Ed'', the alleged victim stated that she "...suffers from [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] that impedes everyday life, not only from the alleged attack but also from the “browbeating” she endured as she attempted to report the professor, again and again, to Yale officials."&lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"/&gt;

In 1993, the [[American Philosophical Association]]'s sexual harassment committee set out guidelines for addressing this issue in philosophy departments. The APA guidelines, which were revised in 2013, stated that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apaonline.org/?harassment|title=Statement on Sexual Harassment - The American Philosophical Association|author=|date=|website=www.apaonline.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or sexually directed remarks constitute sexual harassment when submission to such conduct is made a condition of academic or employment decisions, or when such conduct persists despite its rejection."
*"Sexual harassment is a serious violation of professional ethics, and should be regarded and treated as such by members of the profession. Sexual harassment is a form of prohibited discrimination when an institution or individual employee is aware of a sexually hostile environment and condones, tolerates or allows that environment to exist. Colleges and universities should supply clear, fair institutional procedures under which charges of sexual harassment on campus can be brought, assessed, and acted on."
*"Complaints of sexual harassment at APA-sponsored activities should be brought to the chair of the committee for the defense of professional rights of philosophers or, if they arise in the context of placement activities, to the APA ombudsperson. Complaints of sexual harassment by or against APA staff members should be brought to the chair of the board."

===Black women===
[[File:Angela Davis en Bogotá, Septiembre de 2010.jpg|thumb|right|160px|[[Angela Davis]] (born 1944) is an American [[Activism|political activist]], philosopher and author. Her research interests include [[African-American studies]] and the philosophy of punishment and prisons.]]
There are few black women philosophers, which includes women of African and Caribbean ancestry, [[African-American]]s and other individuals from the [[African diaspora]]. According to philosopher [[Sally Haslanger]], the "numbers of philosophers of color, especially women of color, is even more appalling"; in a 2003 study, there "...was insufficient data for any racial group of women other than white women to report." &lt;ref name="opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/02/women-in-philosophy-do-the-math/?_r=0|title=Women in Philosophy? Do the Math|first=Sally|last=Haslanger|date=|website=nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the "...representation of scholars of color is plausibly worse than in any other field in the academy, including not only physics, but also engineering."&lt;ref name="opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com"/&gt;  According to professor L.K. McPherson, there is a "gross underrepresentation of blacks in philosophy."&lt;ref name="newappsblog.com"&gt;L.K. McPherson. On Black Underrepresentation and Progress in the Profession. December 12, 2011. http://www.newappsblog.com/2011/12/new-apps-on-black-underrepresentation-and-progress-in-the-profession.html&lt;/ref&gt;  McPherson states that there is a "...willful, not necessarily a conscious, preference among many members of the philosophy profession largely to maintain the status quo in terms of: the social group profiles of members; the dynamics of prestige and influence; and the areas and questions deemed properly or deeply 'philosophical.' None of this is good for black folk."&lt;ref name="newappsblog.com"/&gt;

The first black woman in the US to do a PhD in philosophy was [[Joyce Mitchell Cook]], who obtained her degree in 1965 from [[Yale University]]. LaVerne Shelton was also one of the earliest black women to receive a PhD in philosophy. Other notable women include [[Angela Davis]], a political activist who specializes in writing about [[feminism]], [[critical theory]], [[Marxism]], [[popular music]], [[social consciousness]], and the philosophy of punishment and prisons; [[Kathryn Gines]], the founding director of the Collegium of Black Woman Philosophers, who specializes in [[continental philosophy]], [[Africana philosophy]], [[Race theory|philosophy of race]] and Black [[feminist philosophy]]; [[Anita L. Allen]], the first African-American woman to complete both a JD and a PhD in philosophy, who focuses on political and legal philosophy, and who in 2010 was appointed by [[President Obama]] to sit on the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues; and [[Adrian Piper]], an analytical philosopher who received a PhD in philosophy from Harvard; Jaqueline Scott, who received a PhD in philosophy from [[Stanford University]], and who specializes in [[Nietzsche]], nineteenth-century philosophy, race theory and [[African-American philosophy]].

=== Asian women ===
Few Asian women are recognized in contemporary Western philosophy. In a [[The New York Times|New York Times]] interview&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/04/06/asian-american-woman-philosopher/|title=Asian, American, Woman, Philosopher|last=Yancy|first=George|last2=Lee|first2=Emily S.|date=2015-04-06|website=Opinionator|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[George Yancy]], Korean-American philosopher Emily S. Lee, assistant professor of philosophy at [[California State University, Fullerton]], states, "I wonder if some of my experiences occur from being Asian-American, in the ways people stereotypically assume that I must specialize in certain areas of philosophy or behave in specific ways, such as being quiet and subdued." She postulates that the social forces that stereotype and encourage Asian-Americans to enter more lucrative and secure fields (such as engineering or medicine) combined with influences within the field of philosophy discouraging Asian-American youths from continuing their study in the field has led to the extremely small population of Asian-American female philosophers. [[University of Washington]] philosophy professor Carole Lee's report in the [[American Philosophical Association]]'s newsletter on Asian and Asian-American Philosophers and Philosophies suggests&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.apaonline.org/resource/collection/2EAF6689-4B0D-4CCB-9DC6-FB926D8FF530/AsianV14n1.pdf|title=Asian Americans, Positive Stereotyping, and Philosophy|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Asian women face conflicting stereotypes, making it difficult for them to fit into the field of philosophy: "Women are stereotyped as submissive rather than aggressive and as being bad at math: they lack both characteristics associated with philosophy." On the other had, "Asian Americans are stereotyped as being mathematical; however, they are characterized in ''passive'' rather than aggressive terms." Philosopher David Kim offers the explanation that a lack of Asian American mentors in philosophy and "derogation of philosophical thought that resonates with their identity" may also contribute to the wide disparity.

==Reports from the US ==
[[U.S. Department of Education]] reports indicate that [[philosophy]] is one of the least proportionate fields in the [[humanities]] with respect to gender.&lt;ref name="Salary, Promotion 1997"/&gt; Although reports indicate that philosophy as a professional field is disproportionately male, no clear, unequivocal data exists on the number of women currently in philosophy, or indeed, on the number of men in philosophy, and it is debatable how to define what it means to be ‘in philosophy.’ This can variously be defined as the current number of Ph.D. holders in philosophy, the current number of women teaching philosophy in two- and four- year institutions of higher learning either/both full-time and/or part-time (no one [[data set]] exists which measures these), or the current number of living women with publications in philosophy. The lack of clear data makes it difficult to establish gender proportions, but the consensus among those who have tried to arrive at an estimate is that women make up between 17% and 30% of academically employed philosophers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The [[National Center for Education Statistics]]' 2000 report, "Salary, Promotion, and Tenure Status of Minority and Women Faculty in U.S. Colleges and Universities," estimates in Table 23 that the total number of "History and Philosophy" U.S. citizens and full-time faculty who primarily taught in 1992 was 19,000, of which 79% were men (i.e. 15,010 men in history and philosophy), 21% were women (3,990). They add, "In fact, men were at least twice as likely as women to teach history and philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;NCES (2000), previously cited.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Anita L Allen.JPG|thumb|left|180px|[[Anita L. Allen]] (born 1953) is a professor of law and professor of philosophy at the [[University of Pennsylvania Law School]].]]
In their 1997 report, "[http://nces.ed.gov/pubs97/97973.pdf Characteristics and Attitudes of Instructional Faculty and Staff in the Humanities]," NCES notes, that about "one-half of full-time instructional faculty and staff in 4-year institutions in English and literature (47 percent) and foreign languages (50 percent) were female in the fall of 1992, compared with less than one-half of instructional faculty and staff in history (24 percent) and philosophy and religion (13 percent) (table 4)." In this report they measure Philosophy and Religion in the same data set, and estimate the total number of full-time instructional Philosophy and Religion faculty and staff in 4-yr institutions to be 7,646. Of these, 87.3% are male (6675 men),
12.7 are female (971 women).&lt;ref&gt;NCES (1997), previously cited.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1997 report measures History Full-time instructional faculty and staff in 4-yr institutions to be 11,383; male:76.3 (8,686 men);
female: 23.7 (2,697 women). The numbers of women in philosophy from the two studies are not easily comparable, but one rough method may be to subtract the number of women in history in the 1997 report from the number of women estimated to be in 'history and philosophy' in the 2000 report. Doing so suggests that as a rough estimate, 1,293 women are employed as instructors of philosophy.

The 1997 report indicates that a large portion of all humanities instructors are part-time.&lt;ref&gt;NCES (1997): "Forty-two percent of all instructional faculty and staff were employed part time by their institution in the fall of 1992. Forty-five percent of [all U.S.] humanities faculty were employed part time."&lt;/ref&gt; Part-time employees are disproportionately female but not majority female.&lt;ref&gt;NCES (1997): "Part-time faculty members were more likely to be female (45 percent) than full-time faculty (33 percent), although the majority of both part- and full-time faculty were male (55 percent and 67 percent, respectively)."&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, considerations of full-time employees only necessarily leave out data on many women working part-time to remain active in their field. In 2004, the percentage of Ph.D.s in philosophy, within the U.S., going to women reached a record high percentage: 33.3%, or 121 of the 363 doctorates awarded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norc.uchicago.edu/issues/sed-2004.pdf Hoffer, T.B., V.

However, all chapters focus broadly on issues minorities face in the profession, philosophical issues regarding minorities, and work done by minority philosophers, as well as issues that are specific to that school’s philosophy department. MAP’s short-term goals include providing a space for students to discuss and work on these issues, and long-term goals include contributing to the culture of academic philosophy and increasing participation and recognition of minorities in philosophy. In recent years, MAP has fostered collaborative work between chapters, establishing "connections between chapters that benefit both members and departments long-term,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mapforthegap.com/uploads/2/2/3/2/22328318/eoy_report_.pdf|title=Minorities and Philosophy End of Year Report|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; increased work on inclusive pedagogy, and organized efforts to bring philosophy into communities outside of university campuses, such as prisons and elementary schools.

The Committee on the Status of Women is a committee of the [[American Philosophical Association]] devoted to the assessment and reporting on the status of women in philosophy.&lt;ref name="apaonlinecsw.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apaonlinecsw.org/mission|title=Mission - APA Committee on the Status of Women|author=|date=|website=www.apaonlinecsw.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently chaired by [[Hilde Lindemann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apaonlinecsw.org/members|title=Committee Members - APA Committee on the Status of Women|author=|date=|website=www.apaonlinecsw.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2007, the Committee on the Status of Women co-sponsored a session on the central question "Why Are Women Only 21% of Philosophy".&lt;ref name="lemmingsblog.blogspot.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lemmingsblog.blogspot.com/2007/04/apa-report-status-of-women-in.html|title=APA Report: the Status of Women in Philosophy|author=|date=|website=lemmingsblog.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this session, Sharon Crasnow suggested that the low numbers of women in philosophy may be due to:
* Differential treatment: male and female university students may be treated differently in the  classroom.
* Vicious circle: female students do not feel inclined to study philosophy because of a lack of contact with female philosophy professors. 
* Misleading statistics: university administrators focus on gender representation in the humanities overall, which obscures the disparity in philosophy.&lt;ref name="lemmingsblog.blogspot.com"/&gt;

The blog [[Jennifer Saul#Distinguished Woman Philosopher Award|Feminist Philosophers]] hosts the Gendered Conference Campaign, which works toward increasing the representation of women at philosophy conferences and in edited volumes. The blog states that "all-male events and volumes help to perpetuate the stereotyping of philosophy as male.

==History==
While there were women philosophers since the earliest times, and some were accepted as philosophers during their lives, almost no woman philosophers have entered the philosophical [[Western canon]].&lt;ref name="Duran, Jane 2005"/&gt;  Historians of philosophy are faced with two main problems. The first being the exclusion of women philosophers from history and philosophy texts, which leads to a lack of knowledge about women philosophers among philosophy students. The second problem deals with what the canonical philosophers had to say about philosophy and women's place in it. In the past twenty-five years there has been an exponential increase in feminist writing about the history of philosophy and what has been considered the philosophical canon.&lt;ref&gt;Witt, Charlotte and Shapiro, Lisa, "Feminist History of Philosophy", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2015 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2015/entries/feminism-femhist/&gt;.
  http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-femhist/&lt;/ref&gt; According to Eugene Sun Park, "[p]hilosophy is predominantly white and predominantly male. This homogeneity exists in almost all aspects and at all levels of the discipline." &lt;ref name="read.hipporeads.com"/&gt; According to [[Jennifer Saul]], a professor of philosophy at the University of Sheffield, "[p]hilosophy, the oldest of the humanities, is also the malest (and the whitest).  While other areas of the humanities are at or near gender parity, philosophy is actually more overwhelmingly male than even mathematics."&lt;ref name="salon.com"/&gt;
[[File:Emilie_Chatelet_portrait_by_Latour.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Émilie du Châtelet]] (1706-1749)]]
In the May 13, 2015 issue of ''The Atlantic'', Susan Price notes that even though Kant's first work in 1747 cites [[Emilie du Chatelet|Émilie Du Châtelet]], a philosopher who was a "...scholar of Newton, religion, science, and mathematics", "her work won’t be found in the 1,000-plus pages of the new edition of The Norton Introduction to Philosophy." &lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"/&gt; The Norton Introduction does not name a female philosopher until the book begins to cover the mid-20th century. Scholars argue that women philosophers are also absent from the "...other leading anthologies used in university classrooms." &lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"/&gt; Price states that university philosophy anthologies do not usually mention 17th century women philosophers such as [[Margaret Cavendish]], [[Anne Conway (philosopher)|Anne Conway]], and [[Lady Damaris Masham]].&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"/&gt; Price argues that the philosophical "...canon remains dominated by white males—the discipline that some say still hews to the myth that genius is tied to gender."&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"/&gt; Amy Ferrer, executive director of the American Philosophical Association, states that “...women have been systematically left out of the canon, and that women coming in have not been able to see how much influence women have had in the field."&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"/&gt; ''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', which as published in 1967, had "...articles on over 900 philosophers, [but it] did not include an entry for [[Mary Wollstonecraft|Wollstonecraft]], [[Hannah Arendt|Arendt]] or [[Simone de Beauvoir|de Beauvoir]]. "[T]hese women philosophers were scarcely even marginal" to the canon set out at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2017/entries/feminism-femhist/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first1=Charlotte|last1=Witt|first2=Lisa|last2=Shapiro|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=11 July 2018|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Explaining the very small number of women philosophers, American academic and social critic [[Camille Paglia]] (born 1947) argues that "...women in general are less comfortable than men in inhabiting a highly austere, cold, analytical space, such as the one which philosophy involves. Women as a whole ...are more drawn to practical, personal matters. It is not that they inherently lack a talent or aptitude for philosophy or higher mathematics, but rather that they are more unwilling than men to devote their lives to a frigid space from which the natural and the human have been eliminated."&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/ten-great-female-philosophers-the-thinking-womans-women-299061.html|title=Ten great female philosophers: The thinking woman's women|author=|date=|website=independent.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paglia claims that "[t]oday's lack of major female philosophers is not due to lack of talent but to the collapse of philosophy", because, in her view, philosophy "... as traditionally practised may be a dead genre" that "belongs to a vanished age of much slower and rhetorically formal inquiry."&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt;

===Ancient philosophy===

[[File:Hipparchia of Maroneia Villa Farnesina.jpg|thumb|right|200px| [[Hipparchia of Maroneia]]. Detail from a Roman wall painting in the [[Villa Farnesina]] in [[Rome]].]]
Some of the earliest philosophers were women, such as [[Hipparchia of Maroneia]] (active ca. 325 BC), [[Arete of Cyrene]] (active 5th–4th century BC) and [[Aspasia of Miletus]] (470–400 BC). Aspasia appears in the philosophical writings of [[Plato]], [[Xenophon]], Aeschines Socraticus and [[Antisthenes]]. Some scholars argue that Plato was impressed by her intelligence and wit and based his character [[Diotima of Mantinea|Diotima]] in the ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'' on her.&lt;ref name="Wider1986"&gt;K. Wider, "Women philosophers in the Ancient Greek World", 21–62&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sykoutris"&gt;I. Sykoutris, ''Symposium (Introduction and Comments)'', 152–153&lt;/ref&gt; [[Socrates]] attributes to the (possibly fictional) [[Diotima of Mantinea]] his lessons in the art of Eros (or philosophical searching). [[Plato]]'s final views on women are highly contested, but the ''Republic'' suggests that women are equally capable of education, intellectual vision, and rule of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garside|first1=Christine|title=Plato on Women|journal=Feminist Studies|date=1975|pages=131–138|jstor=3177773|volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Jacobs, William "Platon on Female Emancipation and the Traditional Family"'&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jacobs|first1=William|title=Plato on Female Emancipation and the Traditional Family|journal=Apeiron|date=June 1978|volume=12|issue=1|pages=29–31|doi=10.1515/apeiron.1978.12.1.29|jstor=40913404}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable philosophers include:
*[[Theano of Croton]] (6th century BC)
*[[Aristoclea of Delphi]] (6th century BC)
*[[Sosipatra of Ephesus]] (4th century BC)
*[[Nicarete of Megara]] (flourished around 300 BC)

[[Medieval philosophy]] dates from the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD to the Renaissance in the 16th century. [[Hypatia]] (AD 350 – 370 to 415) was a [[Greeks|Greek]] [[mathematician]], astronomer, and philosopher in [[Roman Egypt|Egypt]], then a part of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name="socrates"&gt;{{Cite book|title= Ecclesiastical History|last= Scholasticus|first= Socrates |authorlink= Socrates Scholasticus |year= |publisher= |location= |isbn= |url = http://cosmopolis.com/alexandria/hypatia-bio-socrates.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the head of the [[Neoplatonic]] school at [[Alexandria]], where she taught [[philosophy]] and [[astronomy]].&lt;ref&gt;Krebs, ''Groundbreaking Scientific Experiments, Inventions, and Discoveries''; ''The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, 2nd edition, Cambridge University Press, 1999: ''"Greek Neoplatonist philosopher who lived and taught in Alexandria."''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Women of Mathematics: A Biobibliographic Sourcebook |last1=Mueller |first1=I. |authorlink= |author2=L.S.

*[[Moderata Fonte]] (1555–1592), critic of religion, feminist

===Modern philosophy===
The 17th century marks the beginning of the [[modern philosophy]] era, which ended in the early 20th century. During the 17th century, various women philosophers argued for the importance of education for women and two women philosophers influenced [[René Descartes]] and during the early part of the 18th century, two women philosophers commented on [[John Locke]]’s philosophy. [[Laura Bassi]] (1711–1778) was the first woman to earn a university chair in a scientific field. [[Olympe de Gouges]] (1748–1793) demanded that French women be given the same rights as men, a position also taken by [[Judith Sargent Murray]] (1751–1820) in her essay "[[On the Equality of the Sexes]]" and [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] in her essay ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792). During the 19th century, [[Harriet Martineau]] (1802–1876)  criticized the state of women's education and [[Harriet Taylor Mill]] (1807–1858), [[Sarah Margaret Fuller]] (1810-1850) and [[Antoinette Brown Blackwell]] (1825–1921) called for [[women's rights]]. [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]] (1860–1935) argued that women were oppressed by an [[androcentrism|androcentric]] culture. Near the start of the 20th century, [[Mary Whiton Calkins]] (1863–1930) was the first woman to become president of the [[American Philosophical Association]]. Women thinkers such as [[Emma Goldman]] (1869–1940), an [[anarchism|anarchist]], and
[[Rosa Luxemburg]] (1871–1919), a [[Marxist theory|Marxist theorist]], are known for their political views.

====17th century====
*[[Marie de Gournay]] (1565–1645) was a critic of religion, proto-feminist, translator and novelist who insisted that women should be educated.
*[[Anna Maria van Schurman]] (1607–1678) was a multilinguist known for her defense of [[female education]]. 
*[[Elisabeth of the Palatinate|Elisabeth of Bohemia]] (1618–1680) influenced many key figures and philosophers, most notably [[René Descartes]], who she corresponded with. She questioned Descartes' idea of [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]], or the mind being separate from the body, and his theories regarding communication between the mind and body. 
*[[Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle-upon-Tyne|Margaret Cavendish]] (1623–1673) was a philosopher and writer who addressed gender, power, manners, scientific methods, and philosophy.
*[[Anne Conway (philosopher)|Anne Conway]] (1631-1679) was an [[English people|English]] [[philosopher]] whose work, in the tradition of the [[Cambridge Platonists]], was an influence on [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]]. Conway's thought is original as it is [[rationalist philosophy]], with hallmarks of gynocentric concerns and patterns, and in that sense it was unique among seventeenth-century systems.&lt;ref name="Duran2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jane Duran|title=Eight Women Philosophers: Theory, Politics, And Feminism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aIzVEF6J6SYC&amp;pg=PA73|accessdate=13 January 2013|year=2006|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0-252-03022-2|pages=73–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Damaris Cudworth Masham]] (1659–1708) was an English philosopher, [[proto-feminist]], and advocate for women's education. 
*[[Mary Astell]] (1666–1731) was an English [[feminism|feminist]] writer and [[rhetorician]] known for advocacy of equal [[educational opportunities for women]], which earned her the title of "first English feminist."&lt;ref name="litencyc"&gt;Batchelor, Jennie.

*[[Catharine Trotter Cockburn]] (1679–1749) published her first major philosophical work, ''A Defence of Mr. Lock[e]'s [[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' in 1702, at the age of 23. Much of the scholarly interest in her writing centres on [[gender studies]]. 
*[[Émilie du Châtelet]] (1706–1749) was a [[France|French]] mathematician, [[physicist]], and author during the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. She translated and commented on [[Isaac Newton]]'s work ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]''. She criticized [[John Locke]]’s philosophy and emphasizes the necessity of the verification of knowledge through experience. She also theorized about [[free will]] and on the way to do [[metaphysics]].&lt;ref&gt;Hagengruber (2011: 8-12,24,53,54)&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Laura Bassi]] (1711–1778) was an Italian philosopher and physicist who was the first woman in the world to earn a university chair in a scientific field of studies. She received a doctoral degree from the [[University of Bologna]] in May 1732,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Laura Bassi| work = MacTutor Biography| publisher = University of St Andrews| url = http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Bassi.html| accessdate = 30 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the third academic qualification ever bestowed on a woman by a university,&lt;ref name="Findlen, Paula"&gt;Findlen, Paula.

*[[Catharine Macaulay]] (1731–1791) was an English historian and writer. She attacked [[Edmund Burke]]'s ''[[Thoughts on the Cause of the Present Discontents]]'', calling it "a poison...".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hill|1992|p=74}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In her 1790 ''Letters on Education'', she argued along the lines that [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] would do in 1792, that the apparent weakness of women was due to their mis-education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Walters, Margaret|year=2006|title=Feminism: A Very Short Introduction|location=USA|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-280510-X|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Olympe de Gouges]] (1748–1793) was a French playwright and political [[activism|activist]] whose [[feminism|feminist]] and [[Abolitionism in France|abolitionist]] writings reached a large audience. She was an early feminist who demanded that French women be given the same rights as French men. In her ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen]]'' (1791), she challenged the practice of [[patriarchy|male authority]] and the notion of male–female inequality. 
*[[Judith Sargent Murray]] (1751–1820) was an early [[United States|American]] advocate for women's rights, an essayist, [[playwright]], [[poet]], and letter writer. She was one of the first American proponents of the idea of the equality of the sexes—that women, like men, had the capability of intellectual accomplishment and should be able to achieve economic independence. Among many other influential pieces, her landmark essay "[[On the Equality of the Sexes]]" paved the way for new thoughts and ideas proposed by other [[Feminism|feminist]] writers of the century. The essay predated [[Mary Wollstonecraft]]'s ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' which was published in 1792.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hughes|first1=Mary|title=An Enlightened Woman: Judith Sargent Murray and the Call to Equality|journal=[[Pittsburgh Undergraduate Review|Undergraduate Review]]|date=2011|volume=7|issue=21|url=http://vc.bridgew.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1196&amp;context=undergrad_rev|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[Mary Wollstonecraft]] (1759-1797) was an English writer, philosopher, and advocate of [[women's rights]]. She is regarded as one of the founding [[feminist philosophy|feminist philosophers]]. In ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792), her most famous and influential work,&lt;ref&gt;Tomalin, 144–155; Wardle, 115ff; Sunstein, 192–202.&lt;/ref&gt; she argues that women are not naturally inferior to men, but appear to be only because they lack education. She suggests that both men and women should be treated as rational beings and imagines a [[social order]] founded on reason.

====19th century====
*[[Harriet Martineau]] (1802–1876) was an English [[social theorist]] and political writer, often cited as the first female [[sociologist]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2002"&gt;Hill, Michael R.

Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-94528-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote books and essays from a sociological, holistic, religious, domestic, and feminine perspective.  In ''Society in America'', she criticised the state of women's education, stating that the "intellect of women is confined by an unjustifiable restriction" of access to education; she urged women to become well-educated and free.
*[[Harriet Taylor Mill]] (1807–1858) was a philosopher and [[women's rights]] advocate. In [[John Stuart Mill]]'s autobiography, he claimed she was the joint author of most of the books and articles published under his name. He stated that "when two persons have their thoughts and speculations completely in common it is of little consequence, in respect of the question of originality, which of them holds the pen." Together, they wrote "Early Essays on Marriage and Divorce", published in 1832.&lt;ref name=Tong&gt;{{cite book|author=Tong, Rosemarie|title=Feminist Thought: A More Comprehensive Introduction|year=2009|publisher=Westview Press (Perseus Books)|isbn=978-0-8133-4375-4|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The debate about the nature and extent of her collaboration is ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/search/searcher.py?query=harriet+taylor+mill|title=Search (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)|author=|date=|website=plato.stanford.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Sarah Margaret Fuller]] (1810-1850) was an American journalist, critic, philosopher and [[women's rights]] advocate. Her book ''[[Woman in the Nineteenth Century]]'' is considered the first major [[feminism|feminist]] work in the United States. She was an advocate of women's rights and, in particular, women's education and the right to employment. Many other advocates for women's rights and feminism, including [[Susan B. Anthony]], cite Fuller as a source of inspiration.
*[[Antoinette Brown Blackwell]] (1825–1921) was the first woman to be ordained as a mainstream Protestant minister in the [[United States]]. She was a well-versed public speaker on controversial issues such as [[abolition of slavery]] and she sought to expand [[women's rights]]. In 1873 Blackwell founded the Association for the Advancement of Women.
*[[Victoria, Lady Welby]] (1837–1912) was a self-educated English [[philosopher of language]]. She was published articles in the leading English language academic journals of the day, ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'' and ''[[The Monist]]''. She published her first philosophical book, ''What Is Meaning?  Studies in the Development of Significance'' in 1903, following it with ''Significs and Language: The Articulate Form of Our Expressive and Interpretive Resources'' in 1911. Welby's concern with the problem of meaning included (perhaps especially) the everyday use of language, and she coined the word ''significs'' for her approach. Welby's theories on signification anticipated contemporary [[semantics]], [[semiotics]], and [[semiology]]. 
*[[Bertha von Suttner]] (1843–1914) was a [[Czechs|Czech]]-[[Austrians|Austrian]] [[Pacifism|pacifist]] and novelist. In 1905 she was the first woman to be awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/lists/women.html|title=Nobel Prize Awarded Women|author=|date=|website=www.nobelprize.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suttner's pacifism was influenced by the writings of [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Henry Thomas Buckle]], [[Herbert Spencer]], [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]] (Tolstoy praised ''Die Waffen nieder!'').&lt;ref name="weop"&gt;''Bertha von Suttner'' by [[Irwin Adams]]. ''The World Encyclopedia of Peace''. Edited by [[Ervin László]], [[Linus Pauling]] and [[Jong Youl Yoo]]. Oxford : Pergamon, 1986. {{ISBN|0-08-032685-4}}, (vol. 3, pp. 201–4).&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[Helene von Druskowitz]] (1856–1918) was an Austrian philosopher, writer and music critic. She was the second woman to obtain a Doctorate in Philosophy, which she obtained in [[Zürich]]. She usually published under a male alias because of the predominant [[sexism]] of the era.
*[[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]] (1860–1935) was an American [[feminist]], [[sociologist]], novelist, writer and [[social reform]]er. Her short story "[[The Yellow Wallpaper]]" became a bestseller. The story is about a woman who suffers from mental illness after three months of being closeted in a room by her husband. She argued that the domestic environment oppressed women through the patriarchal beliefs upheld by society.&lt;ref&gt;Ann J. Lane, ''To Herland and Beyond'', 230.&lt;/ref&gt; Gilman argued that women's contributions to civilization, throughout history, have been halted because of an [[androcentrism|androcentric]] culture. She argued that women were the underdeveloped half of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Davis and Knight, ''Charlotte Perkins Gilman and Her Contemporaries'', 206.&lt;/ref&gt; She believed economic independence would bring freedom and equality for women.

====Early 20th century====
*[[Mary Whiton Calkins]] (1863–1930) was an American [[philosopher]] and [[psychologist]]. She was also the first woman to become president of the [[American Psychological Association]] and the [[American Philosophical Association]]. Calkins studied psychology under [[William James]] and studied at [[Harvard University]], which allowed her to attend courses but refused to register her as a student, because she was a woman. She published her doctoral dissertation in 1896, and Harvard's Department of Philosophy and Psychology recommended that she be granted her PhD, but Harvard's President and board refused, as she was a woman. The President believed women should not study with men.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Furumoto | first1 = L | year = 1980 | title = Mary Whiton Calkins (1863-1930) | url = | journal = Psychology of Women Quarterly | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 55–68 | doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.1981.tb01033.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Furumoto | first1 = L | year = 1979 | title = Mary Whiton Calkins (1863-1930) fourteenth president of the American Psychological Association | url = | journal = Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 346–356 | doi=10.1002/1520-6696(197910)15:4&lt;346::aid-jhbs2300150408&gt;3.0.co;2-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; James was astonished at the university's decision, as he described her performance as "the most brilliant examination for the Ph.D. that we have had at Harvard." &lt;ref name="Hilgard, E.

*[[Emma Goldman]] (1869–1940) was an [[anarchism|anarchist]] known for her political activism, writing and speeches. She played a pivotal role in the development of [[anarchist political philosophy]] in the first half of the 20th century. She was viewed as a [[free-thinking]] "rebel woman" by admirers, and denounced by critics as an advocate of violent revolution.&lt;ref name="Voices"&gt;{{cite book |last=Streitmatter|first=Rodger|title=Voices of Revolution: The Dissident Press in America|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|year =2001|location=New York|pages=122–134|isbn=0-231-12249-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her writing and lectures spanned a wide variety of issues, including [[atheism]], [[freedom of speech]], [[militarism]], [[capitalism]], marriage, [[free love]], and homosexuality. Although she distanced herself from [[first-wave feminism]] and its efforts toward [[women's suffrage]], she developed ways of incorporating gender politics into anarchism. 
*[[Rosa Luxemburg]] (1871–1919) was a [[Marxist theory|Marxist theorist]], [[Philosophy|philosopher]], [[Economics|economist]] and [[Revolutionary socialism|revolutionary socialist]] of [[Polish-Jewish]] descent. While Luxemburg defended Marx's materialism dialectics and his conception of history, she called for spontaneous [[grass roots]]-based [[class struggle]].

===Contemporary philosophy===
[[File:Hannah_arendt-150x150.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Hannah Arendt]] (1906–1975) considered herself a political theorist, but she is often described as a philosopher.]]
[[Contemporary philosophy]] is the present period in the history of [[Western philosophy]] beginning at the end of the 19th century with the [[professionalization]] of the discipline and the rise of [[Analytic philosophy|analytic]] and [[continental philosophy]]. Some influential women philosophers from this period include:
*[[Ayn Rand]] (1905-1982) developed a philosophical system she named [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]], which affirms [[objective reality]] and advocates holding [[reason]] as absolute.&lt;ref&gt;http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/objectivity.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/reason.html&lt;/ref&gt; In [[ethics]], Rand championed [[rational egoism]] and [[individualism]].&lt;ref&gt;http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/self-interest.html&lt;/ref&gt; In [[politics]], she advocated for [[individual rights]] and [[capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/individual_rights.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/capitalism.html&lt;/ref&gt; In [[esthetics]],  she upheld [[romanticism]].&lt;ref&gt;http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/romanticism.html&lt;/ref&gt; Rand regards [[Aristotle]] as her sole major philosophical influence.&lt;ref&gt;http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/aristotle.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Susanne Langer]] (1895–1985) was an American [[philosopher]] of [[philosopher of mind|mind]] and of [[philosopher of art|art]], who was influenced by [[Ernst Cassirer]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead]]. She was one of the first women to achieve an academic career in [[philosophy]] and the first woman to be popularly and professionally recognized as an American philosopher. Langer is best known for her 1942 book entitled ''[[Philosophy in a New Key]]''. It argued that there is a basic and pervasive human need to symbolize, to invent meanings, and to invest meanings in one’s world.&lt;ref name="gardner1"&gt;{{Citation|author=[[Howard Gardner]]|title=Art, Mind, and Brain: A Cognitive Approach to Creativity|chapter=Philosophy in a New Key Revisited: An Appreciation of Susanne Langer |publisher=Basic Books|pages=48–54|location=New York|url=http://www.anthonyflood.com/gardnerlanger.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Hannah Arendt]] (1906–1975) was a [[Germany|German]]-born [[Americans|American]] [[Jewish assimilation|assimilated]] [[Jews|Jewish]] [[political theory|political theorist]]. Though often described as a philosopher, she rejected that label on the grounds that philosophy is concerned with "man in the singular" and instead described herself as a political theorist because her work centers on the fact that "men, not Man, live on the earth and inhabit the world."&lt;ref&gt;Arendt, Hannah. ''The Human Condition''. 2nd ed. Chicago: University of Chicago, 1998.&lt;!-- isbn needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Her works deal with the nature of [[power (sociology)|power]], and the subjects of politics, [[direct democracy]], [[authority]], and [[totalitarianism]]. The [[Hannah Arendt Prize]] is named in her honor.
[[File:Simone de Beauvoir.jpg|thumb|right|160px|[[Simone de Beauvoir]] (1908–1986) was a French writer, intellectual, [[Existentialism|existentialist philosopher]], political activist, [[feminist]] and [[social theorist]].]]
*[[Simone de Beauvoir]] (1908–1986) was a French writer, intellectual, [[Existentialism|existentialist philosopher]], political activist, [[feminist]] and [[social theorist]]. Though she did not consider herself a philosopher, she had a significant influence on both [[feminist existentialism]] and [[feminist theory]].&lt;ref name="plato.stanford"&gt;Bergoffen, Debra, "Simone de Beauvoir", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Fall 2010 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2010/entries/beauvoir/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; De Beauvoir wrote novels, essays, biographies, autobiography and [[monograph]]s on philosophy, politics and social issues. She is known for her 1949 treatise ''[[The Second Sex]]'', a detailed analysis of women's oppression and a foundational tract of contemporary [[feminism]].
*[[Elizabeth Anscombe]] (1919–2001), usually cited as G. E. M. Anscombe, was a British [[analytic philosophy|analytic philosopher]]. Anscombe's 1958 article "[[Modern Moral Philosophy]]" introduced the term "[[consequentialism]]" into the language of analytic philosophy, and had a seminal influence on contemporary [[virtue ethics]]. Her monograph ''[[Intention (book)|Intention]]'' is generally recognised as her greatest and most influential work, and the continuing philosophical interest in the concepts of [[Intention (philosophy)|intention]], [[Action (philosophy)|action]] and [[practical reasoning]] can be said to have taken its main impetus from this work.  [[Mary Warnock]] described her in 2006 as "the undoubted giant among women philosophers" while [[John Joseph Haldane|John Haldane]] said she "certainly has a good claim to be the greatest woman philosopher of whom we know".&lt;ref name="Haldane"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haldane|first=John|title=In Memoriam: G. E. M. Anscombe (1919–2001)|journal=The Review of Metaphysics|date=June 2000|volume=53|issue=4|pages=1019–1021|jstor=20131480}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Mary Midgley]] (born 1919) is an English [[ethics|moral philosopher]]. A senior lecturer in philosophy at [[Newcastle University]], she is known for her work on science, ethics and [[animal rights]]. Midgley strongly opposes [[reductionism]] and [[scientism]], and any attempts to make science a substitute for the humanities—a role for which it is, she argues, wholly inadequate. She has written extensively about what philosophers can learn from nature, particularly from animals. ''The Guardian'' has described her as a fiercely combative philosopher and the UK's "foremost scourge of 'scientific pretension.'"&lt;ref name=brown2001&gt;{{cite web|last=Brown|first=Andrew|title=Mary, Mary, quite contrary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/saturday_review/story/0,3605,421561,00.html|work=The Guardian|date=13 January 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Mary Warnock]] (born 1924) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[philosopher]] of [[ethics|morality]], [[philosophy of education|education]] and [[philosophy of mind|mind]], and writer on [[existentialism]]. From 1984 to 1991, she was [[Master (college)|Mistress]] of [[Girton College, Cambridge]]. Warnock studied at [[Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford|Lady Margaret Hall]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], and was made an Honorary Fellow in 1984. She delivered the [[Gifford Lectures]], entitled "Imagination and Understanding," at the [[University of Glasgow]] in 1992. She has written extensively on [[ethics]], [[existentialism]] and [[philosophy of mind]].&lt;ref name=Honderich&gt;{{cite book|last=Honderich|first=Ted|title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy|year=1995|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-866132-0|page=907|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Philippa Foot]] (1920-2010) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]], most notable for her works in [[ethics]]. She was one of the founders of contemporary [[virtue ethics]], inspired by the ethics of [[Aristotle]]. Her later career marked a significant change in view from her work in the 1950s and '60s, and may be seen as an attempt to modernize [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] ethical theory, to show that it is adaptable to a contemporary world view, and thus, that it could compete with such popular theories as modern [[deontology|deontological]] and [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] ethics.  Some of her work was crucial in the re-emergence of [[normative ethics]] within [[analytic philosophy]], especially her critique of [[consequentialism]] and of [[non-cognitivism]]. A familiar example is the continuing discussion of an example of hers referred to as the [[trolley problem]]. Foot's approach was influenced by the later work of [[Wittgenstein]], although she rarely dealt explicitly with materials treated by him.
*[[Patricia Churchland]] (born 1943) is a Canadian-American [[philosopher]] noted for her contributions to [[neurophilosophy]] and the [[philosophy of mind]]. She is UC President's professor of philosophy emerita at the [[University of California, San Diego]] (UCSD), where she has taught since 1984. Educated at the [[University of British Columbia]], the [[University of Pittsburgh]], and the [[University of Oxford]], she taught philosophy at the [[University of Manitoba]] from 1969 to 1984.
*[[Susan Haack]] (born 1945) is distinguished professor in the humanities, professor of philosophy, and professor of law at the University of Miami. She earned her PhD at [[Cambridge University]]. She has written on [[logic]], the [[philosophy of language]], [[epistemology]], and [[metaphysics]]. Her [[pragmatism]] follows that of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]]. Haack's major contribution to philosophy is her [[epistemology|epistemological]] theory called [[foundherentism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Aune | first1 = B. | title = Haack's ''Evidence and Inquiry''| journal = Philosophy and Phenomenological Research | volume = 56 | issue = 3 | pages = 627–632 | doi = 10.2307/2108389 | year = 1996 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Flage | first1 = D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5655">This page lists the official '''World Champions &amp;ndash; Professional Latin''' of the '''[[World Dance Council]]''' ('''WDC'''). The championships are authorized and organized under the auspices of the WDC, and held annually in the last quarter of each year. The competition comprises five dances: [[Rhumba|rumba]], [[Samba (ballroom dance)|samba]], [[Pasodoble|paso doble]], [[Cha-cha-cha (dance)|cha-cha-cha]] and [[Jive (dance)|jive]], as defined in [[ballroom dancing]] terms.

Official World Championships have been held in the Latin section of [[ballroom dancing]] since they were organised by the [[International Council of Ballroom Dancing|ICBD]] in 1959. The ICBD was renamed [[World Dance &amp; DanceSport Council|WD&amp;DSC]] and has been renamed again to its present title. The WDC represents all the major professional [[DanceSport]] countries. Unofficial world championships were held, usually in Paris, by several organisers pre-[[World War II]]. Some of these events included one or two Latin dances in the same competition as ballroom dances. As these events had no official standing, they are not noticed here. There is one earlier international Latin dance championship; it started in 1953 at the Elsa Wells International Dance Championships in London (see [[International Latin American Dance Champions]]). Both series have continued annually.

{{World-Scrabble-Championship | year=1993 | date-from=27 August 1993 | date-to=30 August 1993 | location=[[New York City|New York]] | winner=Mark Nyman | winning word wet | number-of-players=64 | sponsor=Hasbro | next=1995 | previous=1991 }}

The '''World Scrabble Championship 1993''' was the second World Scrabble Championship. The winner was Mark Nyman,&lt;ref name=wsc1993&gt;{{cross-tables tournament|tid=1408|tname=WSC 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; representing the United Kingdom, as this was before the countries of the UK were given individual representation.

The first 15 rounds used modified [[Swiss tournament|Swiss]] pairing. After this, players #1 and #3 and players #2 and #4 played a best-of-five semifinal to determine the finalists while the remaining 64 players played three more games. The semifinals were followed by a best-of-five finals while the two other semifinalists played a best-of-five match to determine third and fourth place.

The first game of the finals looked like it would go Nyman's way when he [[Bingo (Scrabble)|bingoed]] with [[wikt:mutagenic|MUTAGENIC]] from an MU on his second play and then challenged off Wapnick's [[wikt:dox|DOX]]. But Nyman later played a phony of his own ([[wikt:verging|VERGINGS]]) and then got stuck with the Q while Wapnick drew both blanks and won by 38.

In game two, Wapnick drew both blanks again and won by almost 100 points, aided by the 102-point [[wikt:dysuric|DYSURIC]].

Game three was tight until Nyman played two successive bingos and went on to a 530-victory. The fourth game again started close, until Wapnick scored 212 points on three successive turns (though he missed a 107-point bingo in the process) and took a seemingly insurmountable 174-point lead. A few turns later, Wapnick had the opportunity to take a 212 point lead with [[wikt:helm|HELMING]], but the play would have opened a triple-triple line with both blanks unseen so he opted for a more conservative 41-point play and still led by 170. Against the odds, Nyman came back with a 50-point X play and bingos with both blanks and went on to a devastating 9-point victory.

The key point in the final game came when Wapnick, holding a blank, played [[wikt:stum|STUM]] instead of [[wikt:smur|SMUR]] (of which he was unsure). Nyman then bingoed with [[wikt:bedawin|BEDAWIN]] setting up an S-hook on the O column. Unable to play a bingo ending in S because of his STUM play, Wapnick instead played GROANERs when he could have blocked the O column with ORANGiER. Sure enough, Nyman drew an S and played [[wikt:velure|VELURES]] for 91 points then coasted to an easy win to become the first non-North American to win the world championship.
