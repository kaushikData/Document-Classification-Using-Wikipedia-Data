The '''1998 Sydney water crisis''' involved the suspected contamination by the microscopic pathogens ''[[cryptosporidium]]'' and ''[[giardia]]'' of the [[water supply]] system of [[Sydney|Greater Metropolitan Sydney]], between July and September 1998.

Following routine water sampling and testing, over a series of weeks low level contaminates were found at [[Prospect Reservoir|Prospect]], {{NSWcity|Potts Hill}}, [[Sydney Hospital]], the [[Art Gallery of New South Wales|NSW Art Gallery]], [[Macquarie Street, Sydney|Macquarie Street]], [[Centennial Park, Sydney|Centennial Park]], {{NSWcity|Surry Hills}}, {{NSWcity|Rhodes}}, {{NSWcity|Enfield}}, {{NSWcity|Palm Beach}} and water treatment facilities at [[Warragamba Dam|Warragamba]], Nepean, {{NSWcity|North Richmond}}, {{NSWcity|Orchard Hills}}, [[Woronora]], [[Macarthur, New South Wales|Macarthur]], the [[Illawarra]] and Prospect. The reliability of these test results was subsequently called into doubt.&lt;ref name="McClennanFinalVol2"/&gt; Precautionary [[Boil-water advisory|"boil water" alerts]] were raised covering several suburban areas for the period of the crisis.

In response to the crisis, the [[Government of New South Wales]] established a Commission of Inquiry, chaired by [[Judge|jurist]] [[Peter McClellan]] {{post-nominals|country=AUS|QC}} as [[Commissioner]]. McClennan handed down his final report to the [[Premier of New South Wales|NSW Premier]] making ninety{{endash}}one recommendations that led to the reorganisation of water supply and water management functions and agencies in Greater Metropolitan Sydney via the establishment of the [[Sydney Catchment Authority]] with responsibility for [[drainage basin|catchments]], [[dam]]s, and bulk supply [[reservoir (water)|reservoirs]]; while [[Sydney Water]] maintained management of water supply distribution, water treatment and [[sewerage]], and stormwater management. Both the Chairman and Managing Director of Sydney Water stood down during and following the crisis.

==Background==

===Sydney's water supply network===
{{As of|1998}}, [[Sydney Water]] supplied approximately {{convert|1500|ML}} of water each day to more than 3.8&amp;nbsp;million people in the Sydney, [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]] and Illawarra regions. A network of nine major dams plus several minor storage reservoirs was used to collect and store water which, in turn, was delivered to a network of over {{convert|20000|km}} of water mains, 165 pumping stations and 261 service reservoirs. The water supply was drawn from catchments on four main river systems the [[Upper Nepean Scheme|Upper Nepean]], the Warragamba, the [[Shoalhaven Scheme|Shoalhaven]] and the [[Woronora Dam|Woronora]] with minor supplies drawn from the [[Hawkesbury River]], and tributaries of the [[Grose River|Grose]], [[Fish River (Oberon)|Fish]] and [[Duckmaloi River|Duckmaloi]] rivers.&lt;ref name="McClennanFinalVol2"/&gt;{{rp|page=38}}

Since late 1996 all of Sydney's water supply has been filtered. Eleven water treatment plants are used to filter drinking water supplied to Sydney, Illawarra and the Blue Mountains. Seven of these facilities are owned and operated by Sydney Water. These are located at Orchard Hills, Cascade, North Richmond, Nepean, Warragamba, {{NSWcity|Linden}} and Greaves Creek. The remaining four privately owned and operated plants at Prospect, Macarthur, Illawarra and Woronora provide filtered water under contract to Sydney Water. These four plants provide more than 90% of Sydney's drinking water. Up to 80% is supplied through the Prospect plant alone. The water is distributed from Prospect to Pipe Head by tunnels and mains, with some areas supplied directly from these mains. From Pipe Head, water for the inner city, suburbs south of [[Port Jackson|Sydney Harbour]] and [[Inner West Sydney|inner western suburbs]] is carried by tunnel and mains to two large service reservoirs at Potts Hill and then by two tunnels (the Pressure Tunnel and City Tunnel) which terminate at {{NSWcity|Waterloo}} and Dowling Street pumping stations. Two pumping stations one at Prospect and one at {{NSWcity|West Ryde}} supply water for the [[North Shore (Sydney)|northern suburbs]] and the [[Northern Beaches|northern beaches]]. The water for Ryde is supplied from Pipe Head.&lt;ref name="McClennanFinalVol2"/&gt;{{rp|page=38}}

==Timeline of event==
Low levels of cryptosporidium and giardia were first detected in the water supply on 21 July. The levels were within acceptable health limits. In days following, much higher levels were recorded, and on 27 July the first "boil water" alert (in which residents were instructed to boil their tap water before use) was declared for the eastern [[Sydney central business district]]. On 29 July a "boil water" alert was issued for the south of [[Port Jackson|Sydney Harbour]] and on 30 July a Sydney-wide "boil water" alert was issued.

The [[Sydney Water|Sydney Water Corporation]] announced the water safe to drink again on 4 August.

The contamination was caused by low-quality [[raw water]] entering the dam. This was attributed to moderate rainfall in July, followed by heavy rainfall in August and September (after decreasing storage levels since mid-July 1997) which caused pulses of the raw water to enter the dam.

The incident was highly publicised and caused major public alarm. Three successive "boil water" notices in which residents were instructed to boil their tap water before use affected up to three million residents.

The lack of cases of cryptosporidiosis, giardiasis or any other health problem which might be attributed to tainted water led to suggestions the microbes were either not an infectious type, or not as prevalent as measured. An inquiry after the event revealed the publicity as an exaggeration of fact, with Australian Water Technologies, part of Sydney Water, severely overestimating levels of cryptosporidium and giardia present in the water, with the recorded levels exposed as not harmful to human health. The handling of the crisis by Sydney Water, a state-government owned corporation since 1995, was heavily criticised, causing the resignation of both the [[Chairman]] and the [[Managing Director]] and bringing up issues of private vs. public ownership and scientific uncertainty.

==Outcomes==
The Premier, [[Bob Carr]], established the '''Sydney Water Inquiry''' and appointed Sydney jurist [[Peter McClellan]] {{post-nominals|country=AUS|QC}} as Commissioner. McClellan delivered a series of interim reports to the Premier, which were tabled in [[Parliament of New South Wales|Parliament]]. The final report was delivered in December 1998 and detailed 91 recommendations for action by Sydney Water, NSW Health and other state and federal government agencies, including the National Health and Medical Research Commission.&lt;ref name="McClennanFinalVol2"&gt;{{cite web |author=McClennan, Peter |authorlink=Peter McClellan |date=December 1998 |title=Sydney Water Inquiry: Final Report |volume=Volume 2 |edition=Fifth Report |publisher=[[Department of Premier and Cabinet (New South Wales)|NSW Premier's Department]] |isbn=0-7313-3073-0 |location=Sydney |url=http://www.dpc.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0016/15361/05_Fifth_Report_-_Final_Report_Volume_2_-_December_1998.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=16 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chairman of Sydney Water, [[David Hill (businessman)|David Hill]] resigned ten days after the final crisis event, denied any responsibility, and claimed he was leaving only to concentrate on his political career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.greenleft.org.au/node/16791 |title=David Hill: from Giardia to Labor MP? |work=[[Green Left Weekly]] |author1=Francis, Geoff |author2=Hicks, Peter |date=16 September 1998 |accessdate=16 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sydney Catchment Authority]] was created in 1999 as result of the crisis, assuming control of Sydney's catchments and dams, while Sydney Water maintained responsibility for water treatment and distribution and for sewage collection, treatment and disposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sydney Water Inquiry Continues |journal=Health Steam |date=December 1998 |first= |last= |volume= |issue=12 |pages= |id= |url=http://www.waterquality.crc.org.au/hsarch/HS12a.htm |accessdate= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528105811/http://www.waterquality.crc.org.au/hsarch/HS12a.htm |archivedate=28 May 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''AIDS Services of Austin''' (ASA) is a [[non-profit]] [[AIDS service organization]] that addresses [[HIV]] and [[AIDS]] in [[Central Texas]]. Founded in 1987, ASA is the region’s oldest and largest community-based organization addressing the local AIDS crisis. Annually, they provide direct care services to over 1,500 people and HIV prevention education to over 10,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asaustin.org/about-us/ |title=About ASA |publisher=AIDS Services of Austin |accessdate=2013-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===1980s===
[[Image:Ann-aids-walk.jpg|thumb|[[Ann Richards]] speaks at the first AIDS Walk Austin in 1988]]
The first HIV case in Austin was reported in the summer of 1983, known at the time as GRID, or [[Gay-Related Immune Deficiency]].  In the first months of the outbreak, there was no local organization dedicated to the quickly growing crisis.  In August 1983, Paul Clover founded the [http://www.waterloocounseling.org/ Waterloo Counseling Center] to serve the gay community through queer-positive, affordable mental health services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hivplusmag.com/NewsStory.asp?id=18955&amp;sd=10/06/2008 |title=Counseling Center Marks 25th Anniversary |work=HIVPlusmag.com |date=2008-10-06 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311113300/http://www.hivplusmag.com/NewsStory.asp?id=18955&amp;sd=10%2F06%2F2008 |archivedate=2012-03-11 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Austin AIDS Project was started at Waterloo but would grow, in just four years, to the point where an organization dedicated to AIDS was needed.

==== Volunteer Beginnings ====
In 1987 the Austin AIDS Project was incorporated as AIDS Services of Austin. Throughout ASA’s history, volunteers have been instrumental to its growth. One of the volunteer groups formed was the Rubber Fairies, a group which distributed condoms and provided safer sex education. Their efforts garnered praise in an article on Splash Days in a July 1988 issue of [[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]], a national news magazine reporting on the LGBT community.

Another volunteer organization, the [http://octopusclub.org/ Octopus Club], was organized by Lew Aldridge in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/column?oid=oid:770305|title=After a Fashion|last=MacMillan Moser|first=Stephen|date=2009-04-24|newspaper=[[Austin Chronicle]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Octopus Club raises funds through events such as ArtErotica, OctoTea Dance and the Oscar Parties for ASA’s Paul Kirby Emergency Relief Fund.

== Early Politics of AIDS ==
In the fall of 1986, the Texas Commissioner of Health proposed quarantining gay men suspected of having HIV and AIDS. [[Glen Maxey]] from the Austin AIDS Project organized medical experts to testify before the Texas Legislature against quarantine. On the day the quarantine proposal was withdrawn, Maxey stepped onto the steps of the Texas Department of Health to a throng of cameras. Interviewed by [[Dan Rather]] for the [[CBS Evening News]], Maxey was outed as a gay activist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=MacMillan King |first=Michael |title=Capitol Chronicle: A Profile in Courage |url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/column?oid=oid%3A83929 |newspaper=[[Austin Chronicle]] |date=2001-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would go on to become the first openly gay legislator in Texas, landing the first state funding earmark for community-based AIDS service organizations.

===1990s===
In response to the unique legal issues faced by people living with HIV and AIDS, ASA started the Capital Area AIDS Legal Project, or CAALP, in 1990, primarily to provide wills and other life-planning documents. Their objectives have changed with the epidemic, and today CAALP offers a full array of pro bono legal services to people living with HIV and AIDS.

With the advent of life-prolonging antiretroviral drug therapies, people with HIV were living longer. Pervasive fear of infection remained, but people now needed long-term care and services. Fear and discrimination caused some physicians, especially dentists, to refuse medical and dental treatment to people living with HIV.  In response, in 1992 ASA founded the Jack Sansing Dental Clinic, which still provides quality, affordable dental care.

== Programs and Services ==

=== Case Management ===

Case management seeks to assist persons who have difficulty accessing or remaining in primary medical care and for delivering and coordinating HIV and other supportive services. Case management facilitates continuity of care by coordinating client access to an array of services, such as primary medical care, access to health insurance, help with daily living skills, housing, transportation, financial assistance, psychosocial and spiritual support, vocational and educational training and services, mental health programs, substance abuse treatment and legal assistance.[[Image:Amos Ewing - Food Bank.jpg|thumb|A volunteer in the Helping Hands Food Bank]]

=== Helping Hands Food Bank and Medical Nutrition Therapy ===

The Helping Hands Food Bank empowers people living with HIV and AIDS with the tools to help manage their health through a nutritious diet that is custom tailored to their unique needs. Beyond food, this program offers personal and household hygiene items. The grocery program is open to clients twice a month and serves 450 individuals annually.

Medical Nutrition Therapy, furnished by a licensed and registered dietitian, is available to clients at high risk. This one-on-one treatment involves individualized, in-depth care provided over time, especially nutritional counseling, provision of nutritional supplements, and education.

=== Testing and Linkage to Care (TLC) ===

ASA’s TLC program offers free HIV testing services, counseling, and connections to needed community resources.  It is designed to assist individuals in evaluating how their behavior may put them at risk for HIV infection and provide a safe, compassionate, and resource-rich space to discuss challenges and successes in reducing their risk.

=== The Jack Sansing Dental Clinic ===

ASA’s Jack Sansing Dental Clinic provides routine and emergency dental care for people living with HIV and AIDS. This includes oral examination, treatment planning, oral surgery, root canal treatment, periodontal therapy, restorative dentistry, removable prosthodontics, treatment of infection and preventative oral health care.

For those with suppressed immune systems due to HIV or AIDS, proper dental care is of the utmost importance.

=== Capital Area AIDS Legal Project (CAALP) ===

A volunteer-based organization, CAALP provides free legal assistance to individuals affected by HIV/AIDS whose income is at or below 125% of the federal poverty guidelines. Since 1990, CAALP has helped more than 3,000 people living with HIV in central Texas.

Through referrals to local volunteer attorneys in the community, CAALP undertakes to assist people with a broad range of civil legal issues, including but not limited to, life planning, insurance, discrimination, confidentiality, immigration, public benefits, landlord-tenant disputes, probate and family law.

=== The Paul Kirby Emergency Relief Fund ===

ASA provides emergency relief for individuals when no other sources of funding exist. The Paul Kirby Emergency Relief Fund is the last resort for case managers to assist clients, with much of the funding going for essentials like food, utilities, rent and prescription medication.

Paul Kirby was one of Austin AIDS Project’s earliest volunteers. He started AAP’s first newsletter, helped organize one of the first support groups for people living with HIV and AIDS and was one of ASA’s founding board members. The vast majority of the Fund is thanks to the Octopus Club, an all-volunteer, grassroots organization dedicated to making a difference through raising money for the Fund.

=== The PATH Risk Reduction Program ===

Comprehensive Risk &amp; Counseling Services, commonly known as the PATH Program, provides individual and couples counseling to reduce the transmission of HIV. PATH primarily serves people living with HIV and AIDS, but is also open to HIV- people who report high risk of acquiring the virus. PATH is a harm reduction counseling program, meaning that PATH counselors assess each individual’s readiness for change and clients guide the process by identifying problems and goals to address those problems.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3822">'''askMyGP''' is an online [[general practitioner]] consultation platform  launched in 2011 by GP Access Ltd, based in Leicestershire. 

It aims to improve patient access to healthcare and cut down on unnecessary appointments. The company claims only 30% of patients seeking help need a face-to-face appointment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=NHS app: Will it cut down on wasted appointments? |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-44676493 |accessdate=19 October 2018 |publisher=BBC |date=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It gives patients the option of submitting a symptom-related questionnaire online to a GP.  In January 2018 it was said to have managed 29,000 patient episodes in a dozen practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=AskMyGP launches web app to banish NHS Choices search gremlins |url=https://www.digitalhealth.net/2018/01/askmygp-free-web-app-nhs-choices/ |accessdate=19 October 2018 |publisher=Digital Health |date=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A pilot scheme backed by the [[Health and Social Care Board]] was introduced in Northern Ireland in 2016. This gave patients the option of explaining their symptoms to a receptionist by telephone or completing the same questionnaire on line themselves. 70% of the patients at a [[Falls Road, Belfast]] practice said it was an improvement. The algorithm gives GPs more information about the patient’s ailment than the traditional eight-to-10-minute face-to-face consultation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Doctors in north say new app could shorten appointment waiting lists |url=http://www.irishnews.com/lifestyle/2016/07/06/news/doctors-in-north-say-askmygp-could-shorten-appointment-waiting-lists-592080/ |accessdate=19 October 2018 |publisher=Irish News |date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was introduced to the Riverside Group Practice in [[Portadown]] in 2016. The chair of the [[British Medical Association]]'s Northern Ireland GP committee, said: "We introduced AskmyGP nine months ago at the practice where I work and there were complaints during the first two weeks while everyone got used to it, but now all the patients love it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Patients hit out at 'miracle' AskmyGP scheme to cut doctor workloads |url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/patients-hit-out-at-miracle-askmygp-scheme-to-cut-doctor-workloads-35370086.html |accessdate=19 October 2018 |publisher=Belfast Telegraph |date=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When tried at a practice in [[Ipswich]] it wasn’t favoured by all the staff at the surgery, but it was reported that "The ability to signpost to the free NHS physiotherapy self-referral service saves face to face surgery appointments.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Online triage system askmyGP trialled at Ipswich’s Barrack Lane Medical Centre to cut waiting times |url=http://www.ipswichstar.co.uk/news/online-triage-system-askmygp-trialled-at-ipswich-s-barrack-lane-medical-centre-to-cut-waiting-times-1-5146988 |accessdate=19 October 2018 |publisher=Ipswich Star |date=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A single-handed GP with almost 5,000 patients in [[Shotts]], [[Lanarkshire]] signed up to it when she could not recruit partners to the practice. 60-70% of patients now use it and this has enabled the practice to expand without recruiting another doctor as the work can now be managed by a multidisciplinary team of advanced nurse practitioner, advanced practice physiotherapist, mental health worker and nurses skilled in long-term management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=GP calls off recruitment attempts after introducing e-consultations |url=http://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/news/gp-topics/it/gp-calls-off-recruitment-attempts-after-introducing-e-consultations/20037623.article |accessdate=19 October 2018 |publisher=Pulse |date=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bethor''' is an [[Olympian spirit]] in the [[Grimoire]] known as the ''[[Arbatel de magia veterum]]''. He rules over [[Planets in astrology#Jupiter|Jupiter]].

{{quote|The affairs of Jupiter are administered by BETHOR, who responds quickly when called. The person dignified by his character may be exalted to illustrious positions and may obtain large treasures. He reconciles the Spirits of the Air to man, so that they will give true answers, transport precious stones and compose medicines having miraculous effects. BETHOR also grants familiars of the firmament, and can prolong life to seven hundred years, subject to the will of God, which qualification imparts an air of caution.

'''Body-centred countertransference''' involves a psychotherapist's experiencing the physical state of the patient in a clinical context.&lt;ref&gt;Louise Phillips, ''Mental Illness and the Body'' (2006) p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; Also known as [[Countertransference#Body-centred countertransference|somatic countertransference]], it can incorporate the therapist's gut feelings, as well as changes to breathing, to heart rate and to tension in muscles.&lt;ref&gt;Su Fox, ''Relating to clients'' (2008) p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

==Various approaches==

[[Dance therapy]] has understandably given much weight to the concept of somatic countertransference.&lt;ref&gt;Patrizia Pallaro, 'Somatic countertransference', in ''Authentic Movement'' vol 2 (2007) Chap 7&lt;/ref&gt; Jungian [[James Hillman]] also emphasised the importance of the therapist using the body as a sounding-board in the clinical context.&lt;ref&gt;Pallaro, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-[[Wilhelm Reich|Reichian]] therapies like [[bioenergetic analysis]] have also stressed the role of the body-centered countertransference.&lt;ref&gt;Katya Bloom, ''The Embodied Self'' (2006) p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some evidence that [[Narcissism|narcissistic]] patients and those suffering from [[Borderline personality disorder]] create more intense embodied countertransferences in their therapists,&lt;ref&gt;Tamara Latawec, ''When the Professional is Personal'' (2008) p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; their personalities favouring such non-verbal communication by impact&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (1990) p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; over more verbalised, less somatic interactions.

==Orbach==

[[Susie Orbach]] has written emotively of what she described as "wildcat sensations in my own body...a wildcat countertransference"&lt;ref&gt;Susie Orbach, 'Speaking Bodies' in ''Bodies'' (London 2009) 48-76, p. 50-1&lt;/ref&gt; in the context of body countertransference. She details her [[Joseph J. Sandler#Role responsiveness and actualization|role responsiveness]] to one patient who evoked in her what she called "an unfamiliar body experience...this purring, reliable and solid body"&lt;ref&gt;Orbach, p. 52-5&lt;/ref&gt; to counterbalance the fragmented body image of the patient herself.

==The Irish experience==
===In female trauma therapists===
Irish psychologists at NUI Galway and University College Dublin&lt;ref&gt;Egan, J. &amp; Carr, A. (2005).  [[Burnout (psychology)|Burnout]] in female counsellor/therapists of the NCS: Studies I, II and III. Papers presented at the 35th Annual conference of the psychological society of Ireland, Derry, Nov 17-20th&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Egan, J. &amp; Carr, A. (2008).  Body-centred countertransference in female [[trauma therapists]]. Eisteach, 8, 22-27.&lt;/ref&gt; have recently begun to measure body-centred countertransference in female trauma therapists using their recently developed 'Egan and Carr Body-Centred Countertransference Scale' (2005), a sixteen symptom measure.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lenus.ie/hse/bitstream/10147/121271/1/BodycentredCounter.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

Their research was influenced by developments in the psychotherapy world which was beginning to see a therapist's role in a therapeutic dyad as reflexive; that a therapist uses their bodies and 'self' as a tuning fork to understand their client's internal experience and to use this attunement as another way of being empathic with a client's internal world.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, M. (2006).  The analyst's body as a tuning fork:  Embodied resonance in countertransference.  Journal of Analytical Psychology, 51, 109-124&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wosket, V.  (1999).  The therapeutic use of self.  London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;  Pearlman and  Saakvitne's seminal book on [[vicarious traumatization]] and the effect of trauma work on therapists has also been an important directional model for all researchers studying the physical effects of trauma work on a therapist.&lt;ref&gt;Pearlman, L. A., &amp; Saakvitne, K. W. (1995). Trauma and the therapist: Countertransference and vicarious traumatization in psychotherapy with incest survivors.  New York: Norton&lt;/ref&gt; 

High levels of body-centred countertransference have since been found in both Irish female trauma therapists and clinical psychologists.&lt;ref&gt;Booth, A., Trimble, T., &amp; Egan, J. (2010).  Body-centred countertransference in a sample of Irish Clinical Psychologists.  The Irish Psychologist, 36, 284-289.&lt;/ref&gt;  This phenomenon is also known as 'somatic countertransference' or 'embodied countertransference' and it links to how [[mirror neurons]] might lead to 'unconscious automatic somatic countertransference' as a result of [[postural mirroring]] by the therapist.&lt;ref&gt;Egan, J. &amp; Carr, A. (2008).  Body-centred countertransference in female trauma therapists. Eisteach, 8, 22-27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rothschild, B. (2006).  Help for the helper: self-care strategies for managing burnout and stress. London:  W. W. Norton &amp; Company.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Loughran (2002) found that 38 therapists out of 40 who had responded to a questionnaire (which was distributed to a sample of 124 therapists) on a therapist's use of body as a medium for transference and countertransference communication reported that they had experienced bodily sensations (nausea or churning stomach, sleepiness, shakiness, heart palpitations, sexual excitement, etc.) while in session with patients.&lt;ref&gt;Loughran, E. H. (2002). The therapists's use of body as a medium for [[transference]] and countertransference communication. Unpublished Doctor of Psychology Dissertation.  Wright Institute:  California.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Frequency of symptom occurrence===

A list of the frequency of occurrence of body-centred countertransference symptoms reported by trauma therapists (Sample A: 35 Female Irish Trauma therapists&lt;ref&gt;Egan, J. &amp; Carr, A. (2008).  Body-centred countertransference in female trauma therapists. Eisteach, 8, 22-27.&lt;/ref&gt;) and Irish clinical psychologists (Sample B: 87 Irish Clinical Psychologists&lt;ref&gt;Booth, A., Trimble, T., &amp; Egan, J. (2010).  Body-centred countertransference in a sample of Irish Clinical Psychologists.  The Irish Psychologist, 36, 284-289.&lt;/ref&gt;)in the previous six months 'when in-session with a client' is given below in order of frequency:
{{Col-begin}}
{{Col-2}}
#Sleepiness (A; 92%, B; 76%)
#Muscle Tension (A; 83%, B; 79%)
#Yawning (A; 65%, B; 77%)
#Unexpected shift in body (A; 77%, B; 57%)
#Tearfulness (A; 71%, B; 61%)
#Headache (A; 54%, B; 53%)
#Stomach Disturbance (A; 41%, B; 46%)
#Throat Constriction (A; 34%, B; 36%)
{{Col-3}}
#Raised Voice (A; 29%, B; 33%)

#Loss of voice (A; 32%, B; 18%)
#Aches in joints (A; 37%, B; 18%)
#Nausea (A; 23%, B; 18%)
#Numbness (A; 29%, B; 15%)
#Sexual Arousal (A; 26%, B; 11%)
#Genital pain (A; 6%, B; 2%)
{{Col-end}}

===Somatization===

A small but significant relationship was found between female trauma therapists' level of body-centred countertransference and number of sick leave days taken, suggesting a possible relationship between uncensored body-centred countertransference and [[somatization]]. This relationship was not however found in [[clinical psychologists]] who were working mainly with a non-trauma population. Therapists have noted the connection between a tendency for some clients to express emotional discomfort by focusing on [[bodily symptoms]] rather than being able to put their emotional distress into words.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lenus.ie/hse/bitstream/10147/121822/1/SomatizationDis.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  It is thought that such processes are more common in people who have experienced [[childhood abuse]] and trauma.&lt;ref&gt;Pribor, E. F., Yutzy, S. H., Dean, J. T., Wetzel, R. D.  (1993).  [[Briquet's syndrome]], dissociation and abuse.  American Journal of Psychiatry, 150, 1507-1511.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Recent research which measured female [[genital arousal]] in response to rape cues found that women when listening to rape, consent or violence developed genital arousal more frequently than men. It also might explain the relatively frequent reported experience of sexual arousal amongst Irish female trauma therapists.&lt;ref&gt;Suschinsky, K. D. &amp; Lalumiere, M. L. (2010).  Prepared for anything?  An investigation of female genital arousal in response to rape cues.  Psychological Science OnlineFirst@  10.1177/0956797610394660&lt;/ref&gt;  Further validation of body-centred countertransference in psychologists and therapists is on-going in both [[NUI Galway]] and Trinity College Dublin.

==Cautions==

Therapists have been warned against assuming too automatically that their body-feelings always involve somatic resonance to the client, as opposed to being produced from their own feelings/experiences - the same problem appearing with countertransference generally.&lt;ref&gt;Christiane Sanderson, ''Counselling Adult Survivors of Child Sexual Abuse'' (2006) p. 136-7 and p. 395&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Envisioned in 1978, the Cardiothoracic Center of Monaco opened its doors in April 1987. With support from Monegasque authorities, the CCM was designed to address the shortage of beds in cardiology in the [[Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur|PACA]] region, but also to offer patients from all around the Mediterranean cutting-edge equipment. This small hospital is managed by Professor V. Dor, Dr JJ Pastor and G. Nervo.  Since 2010, [[Gilles Dreyfus]] is the medical director.

The CCM has been used for humanitarian purposes.&lt;ref&gt;William Spindler, [http://www.unhcr.org/4df8bd326.html Monaco's Prince Albert visits young Iraqi refugee recovering from heart surgery], ''UNCHR'', 15 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, CCM was nominated by [[Siemens]] to be the first Siemens European Reference Center Cardiovascular Medicine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medical.siemens.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/NewsView~q_catalogId~e_-11~a_categoryId~e_12754~a_catTree~e_100011,1011114~a_langId~e_-11~a_pageId~e_136393~a_storeId~e_10001.htm Siemens partners with Cardiothoracic Center of Monaco], ''Siemens.com'', 20 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3982">The '''Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters''' (CRED) is a research unit of the [[Université catholique de Louvain]] (UCL). It is situated at the School of Public Health of the Brussels campus of the university.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucl.ac.be/bruxelles/ Site de l'UCL à Bruxelles]&lt;/ref&gt;

CRED has been active for over thirty years in the fields of international [[disaster]] and conflict health studies, with research and training activities linking relief, rehabilitation and development. It promotes research, training and technical expertise on humanitarian [[emergency|emergencies]], with a special focus on [[public health]] and [[epidemiology]].

==History==
In 1971, Professor Michel F. Lechat, an [[epidemiologist]] at the Université catholique de Louvain, initiated a research programme to study health issues in disaster situations. Two years later he established CRED as a non-profit institution with international status. Since 1980, CRED has been a [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) [[WHO Collaborating Centre|Collaborating Centre]].

Following the retirement of Professor Lechat in 1992, Professor [[Debarati Guha-Sapir]]&amp;mdash;a researcher in the programme since 1984&amp;mdash;became CRED's director.

==Goals==
CRED promotes research and provides an evidence base to the international community on the burden of disease and related health issues arising from disasters and conflicts to improve preparedness and responses to humanitarian emergencies.

CRED trains field managers, students, relief personnel and health professionals in the management of short- and long-term humanitarian emergencies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aphes.be APHES - Assessing Public Health in Emergency Situations]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Focus==
CRED’s research focuses on humanitarian and emergency situations with major impacts on human health. These include all types of natural disasters such as [[earthquake]]s, [[flood]]s, [[windstorm]]s, [[famine]]s and [[drought]]s; and human induced disasters creating mass displacement of people from civil strife and conflicts.		
   
CRED focuses on health aspects and the burden of disease arising from disasters and complex emergencies. CRED also promotes research on the broader aspects of humanitarian crises, such as human rights and humanitarian [[law]], socio-economic and [[environmental issues]], early warning systems, mental health care, and the special needs of women and children.

CRED is actively involved in stimulating debates on the effectiveness of various [[humanitarian]] interventions. It encourages scientific and policy discussions on existing and potential interventions and their impacts on acute and chronic [[malnutrition]], human survival, [[morbidity]], [[infectious disease]]s, and [[mental health]].

The CRED team works in four main areas:
* [[Natural disasters]] &amp; their impacts
* [[War|Conflict]] &amp; [[health services research|health research]]
* [[Database]] &amp; information support
* [[Capacity building]] &amp; training

==The team==
CRED’s multinational and multidisciplinary team includes experts in [[medicine]] and [[public health]], [[Informatics (academic field)|informatics]] and database management, [[psychology]], [[nutritional science]]s, [[sociology]], [[economics]] and [[geography]]. The working languages are [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]].

'''Cowpox''' is an infectious disease caused by the cowpox virus. The virus, part of the orthopoxvirus genus, is closely related to the ''[[vaccinia]]'' virus. The virus is [[Zoonosis|zoonotic]], meaning that it is transferable between species, such as from animal to human. The transferral of the disease was first observed in dairymaids who touched the [[udder]]s of infected [[cow]]s and consequently developed the signature pustules on their hands.&lt;ref name="dermnetnz.org"&gt;[http://dermnetnz.org/viral/cowpox.html Vanessa Ngan, "Viral and Skin Infections"], 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Cowpox is more commonly found in animals other than bovines, such as rodents. Cowpox is similar to, but much milder than, the highly contagious and often deadly [[smallpox]] disease.&lt;ref name="dermnetnz.org"/&gt; Its close resemblance to the mild form of smallpox and the observation that dairy farmers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2018/02/01/582370199/whats-the-real-story-about-the-milkmaid-and-the-smallpox-vaccine|title=What's The Real Story About The Milkmaid And The Smallpox Vaccine?|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-02-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; were immune from smallpox inspired the first [[smallpox vaccine]], created and administered by English physician [[Edward Jenner]].&lt;ref name="sc.edu"&gt;[http://www.sc.edu/library/spcoll/nathist/jenner.html Thomas Cooper Library, University of South Carolina:  "Edward Jenner and the Discovery of Vaccination"], exhibition, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

The word “[[vaccination]],” coined by Jenner in 1796,&lt;ref name="sc.edu"/&gt; is derived from the Latin root ''vaccinus'', meaning of or from the cow.&lt;ref name="Abbas2003"&gt;{{cite book |title=Cellular and Molecular Immunology |first=K. |last=Abbas |edition=Fifth |location=Philadelphia |publisher=Saunders |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-7216-0008-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Once vaccinated, a patient develops [[antibodies]] that make them immune to cowpox, but they also develop [[Immunity (medical)|immunity]] to the smallpox virus, or ''[[Variola virus]]''. The cowpox vaccinations and [[smallpox vaccine|later incarnations]] proved so successful that in 1980, the [[World Health Organization]] announced that smallpox was the first disease to be eradicated by vaccination efforts worldwide.&lt;ref name="Abbas2003" /&gt; Other [[orthopox]] viruses remain prevalent in certain communities and continue to infect humans, such as the '''cowpox virus''' ('''CPXV''') in Europe, vaccinia in Brazil, and [[monkeypox virus]] in Central and West Africa.

Naturally occurring cases of cowpox were not common, but it was discovered that the vaccine could be “carried” in humans and reproduced and disseminated human-to-human. Jenner's original vaccination used lymph from the cowpox pustule on a milkmaid, and subsequent “arm-to-arm” vaccinations applied the same principle. As this transfer of human fluids came with its own set of complications, a safer manner of producing the vaccine was first introduced in Italy, The new method used cows to manufacture the vaccine using a process called “retrovaccination,” in which a heifer was inoculated with humanized cowpox virus, and it was passed from calf to calf to produce massive quantities efficiently and safely. This then led to the next incarnation, “true animal vaccine,” which used the same process but began with naturally-occurring cowpox virus, and not the humanized form.

This method of production proved to be lucrative and was taken advantage of by many [[entrepreneurs]] needing only calves and seed lymph from an infected cow to manufacture crude versions of the vaccine. W. F. Elgin of the National Vaccine Establishment presented his slightly refined technique to the Conference of State and Provincial Boards of Health of North America. A [[tuberculosis]]-free calf, stomach shaved, would be bound to an operating table, where incisions would be made on its lower body. Glycerinated lymph from a previously inoculated calf was spread along the cuts. After a few days, the cuts would have scabbed or crusted over. The crust was softened with sterilized water and mixed with glycerin, which disinfected it, then stored hermetically-sealed in capillary tubes for later use.

At some point, the virus in use was no longer cowpox, but vaccinia. Scientists have not determined exactly when the change or mutation occurred, but the effects of vaccinia and cowpox virus as vaccine are nearly the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Willrich|first=Michael|title=Pox|date=2011|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The virus is found in [[Europe]], and mainly in the [[UK]]. Human cases today are very rare and most often [[Feline zoonosis|contracted from]] domestic [[cat]]s. The virus is not commonly found in [[cattle]]; the reservoir hosts for the virus are [[woodland]] [[rodent]]s, particularly [[vole]]s. From these rodents, domestic cats contract and transmit the virus to humans.&lt;ref name="Chomel2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chomel|first1=Bruno|title=Emerging and Re-Emerging Zoonoses of Dogs and Cats|journal=Animals|volume=4|issue=3|year=2014|pages=434–445|issn=2076-2615|doi=10.3390/ani4030434|pmid=26480316|pmc=4494318}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Symptoms in cats include [[lesion]]s on the face, neck, forelimbs, and paws, and less commonly upper [[respiratory tract infection]]s.&lt;ref name=Mansell_2005&gt;{{cite book|editor=August, John R.|chapter=Cutaneous manifestations of viral disease|author1=Mansell, Joanne K. |author2=Rees, Christine A. |title=Consultations in Feline Internal Medicine Vol. 5|publisher=Elsevier Saunders|year=2005|isbn=978-0-7216-0423-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Symptoms of infection with cowpox virus in humans are localized, [[pustular]] lesions generally found on the hands and limited to the site of introduction.  The [[incubation period]] is 9 to 10 days. The virus is prevalent in late summer and autumn.

==Origin==
[[File:Cowpox Engraving (detail).png|right|thumb|Cowpox (vaccina) pustules on a cow's udder]]

===Discovery===
In the years from 1770 to 1790, at least six people who had contact with a cow had independently tested the possibility of using the cowpox vaccine as an immunization for smallpox in humans. Amongst them were the English farmer [[Benjamin Jesty]], in [[Dorset]] in 1774 and the German teacher [[Peter Plett]] in 1791.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Plett PC |title=[Peter Plett and other discoverers of cowpox vaccination before Edward Jenner] |language=German |journal=Sudhoffs Arch |volume=90 |issue=2 |pages=219–32 |year=2006 |pmid=17338405 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jesty inoculated his wife and two young sons with cowpox, in a successful effort to immunize them to smallpox, an epidemic of which had arisen in their town. His patients who had contracted and recovered from the similar but milder cowpox (mainly milkmaids), seemed to be [[immune]] not only to further cases of cowpox, but also to smallpox. By scratching the fluid from cowpox lesions into the skin of healthy individuals, he was able to immunize those people against smallpox. Reportedly, farmers and people working regularly with cattle and horses were often spared during smallpox outbreaks. Investigations by the [[British Army]] in 1790 showed that [[cavalry|horse-mounted troops]] were less infected by smallpox than [[infantry]], due to probable exposure to the similar horse pox virus (''[[Variola equina]]''). By the early 19th century, more than 100,000 people in Great Britain had been vaccinated. The arm-to-arm method of transfer of the cowpox vaccine was also used to distribute Jenner's vaccine throughout the Spanish Empire. Spanish king Charles IV's daughter had been stricken with smallpox in 1798, and after she recovered, he arranged for the rest of his family to be vaccinated. In 1803, the king, convinced of the benefits of the vaccine, ordered his personal physician Francis Xavier de Balmis, to deliver it to the Spanish dominions in North and South America. To maintain the vaccine in an available state during the voyage, the physician recruited 22 young boys who had never had cowpox or smallpox before, aged three to nine years, from the orphanages of Spain. During the trip across the Atlantic, de Balmis vaccinated the orphans in a living chain. Two children were vaccinated immediately before departure, and when cowpox pustules had appeared on their arms, material from these lesions was used to vaccinate two more children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jonathan B. |last=Tucker |title=Scourge: The Once and Future Threat of Smallpox |year=2001 |location=New York |publisher=Atlantic Monthly Press |page=31 |isbn=978-0-87113-830-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1796, British medical practitioner Edward Jenner tested the theory that cowpox could protect someone from being infected by smallpox. Although cowpox originates on the udder of cows, Jenner took his sample from a milkmaid, Sarah Nelmes. Jenner extracted the pus of one of the lesions formed by cowpox on Nelmes to another individual who never had smallpox, James Phipps. He eventually developed a scab and fever that was manageable. Approximately six weeks later, Jenner then introduced an active sample of the smallpox virus into Phipps to test the theory. After being observed for an extended amount of time, it was recorded that Phipps did not receive a reaction from it. Although Jenner was not the first person to conceive the notion of cowpox protecting against the smallpox virus, his experiment proved the theory.  This vaccination worked temporarily. It was later discovered that the cowpox vaccination only worked temporarily against the invasion of smallpox and the procedure would need to be repeated several times through ones' lifetime to remain smallpox free. In later years, Jenner popularized the experiment, calling it a vaccination from the Latin for cow, vacca. The amount of vaccinations among people of that era increased drastically. It was widely considered to be a relatively safer procedure compared to the mainstream inoculation. Although Jenner was propelled into the spotlight from the vaccination popularity, he mainly focused on science behind why the cowpox allowed persons to not be infected by smallpox.The honor of the discovery of the vaccination is widely accepted to be given to Benjamin Jesty. He is considered to be the first to use cowpox as a vaccination, though the term vaccination was not invented yet. During the midst of the smallpox outbreak, Jesty transferred pieces of cow udder which he knew had been infected with cowpox into the skin of his family members in the hopes of protecting them. Jesty did not publicize his findings, and Jenner, who performed his first inoculation 22 years later and publicized his findings, assumed credit. It is said that Jenner made this discovery by himself, possibly without knowing previous accounts 20 years earlier. Although Jesty may have been the first to discover it, Jenner made vaccination widely accessible and has therefore been credited for its invention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science and the practice of medicine in the nineteenth century|last=|first=|publisher=Cambridge|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposition===
The majority of the population at the time accepted the up-and-coming vaccination. However, there were still opposition from individuals who were reluctant to change from the inoculations. In addition, there became a growing concern from parties who were worried about the unknown repercussions of infecting a human with an animal disease. One way individuals expressed their discontent was to draw comics that sometimes depicted small cows growing from the sites of vaccination. Others publicly advocated for the continuance of the inoculations; however this was not because of their discontent for the vaccinations. Some of their reluctance had to do with an apprehensiveness for change. They had become so familiar with the process, outcome, positives, and negatives of inoculations that they did not want to be surprised by the outcome or effects of the vaccinations. Jenner soon eased their minds after extensive trials. However, others advocated against vaccinations for different reason. Because of the high price of inoculation, Jenner experienced very few common folk who were not willing to accept the vaccination. Due to this, Jenner found many subjects for his tests. He was able to publish his results in a pamphlet in 1798: ''An Inquiry into the Causes and Effects of Variolae Vaccinae, a Disease, Discovered in some of the Western Counties of England particularly Gloucestershire, and known by the Name of Cow Pox.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Medicine and Society in Early Modern Europe|last=Lindemann|first=Mary|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical use==
[[File:The cow pock.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|In ''The Cow-Pock—or—the Wonderful Effects of the New Inoculation!'' (1802), [[James Gillray]] caricatured recipients of the vaccine developing cow-like appendages.]]
After inoculation, vaccination using the cowpox virus became the primary defense against smallpox. After infection by the cowpox virus, the body (usually) gains the ability to recognize the similar smallpox virus from its [[antigens]] and is able to fight the smallpox disease much more efficiently.

The cowpox virus contains 186 thousand base pairs of DNA, which contains the information for about 187 genes. This makes cowpox one of the most complicated viruses known. Some 100 of these genes give instructions for key parts of the human immune system, giving a clue as to why the closely related smallpox is so lethal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Pete |last=Moore |title=Killer Germs: Rogue Diseases of the Twenty-First Century |year=2001 |location=London |publisher=Carlton |isbn=978-1-84222-150-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The vaccinia virus now used for smallpox vaccination is sufficiently different from the cowpox virus found in the wild as to be considered a separate virus.&lt;ref&gt;Yuan, Jenifer [http://www.stanford.edu/group/virus/pox/history.html The Small Pox Story]&lt;/ref&gt;

===British Parliament===
While the vaccination's popularity increased exponentially, so did its monetary value. This was realized by the British Parliament, which compensated Jenner 10,000 pounds for the vaccination. In addition, they later compensated Jenner an additional 20,000 pounds. In the coming years, Jenner continued advocacy for his vaccination over the still popular inoculation. Eventually, in 1840, the inoculation became banned in England and was replaced with the cowpox vaccination as the main medical solution to combat smallpox. The cowpox vaccination saved the British Army thousands of soldiers, by making them immune to the effects of smallpox in upcoming wars. The cowpox also saved the United Kingdom thousands of pounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Edward Jenner and the history of smallpox and vaccination|journal=Ncbi|volume=18|issue=1|pages=21–5|via=|pmc=1200696|pmid=16200144|date=January 2005|author=Riedel S|doi=10.1080/08998280.2005.11928028}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kinepox===
Kinepox is an alternative term for the [[smallpox vaccine]] used in early 19th-century America. Popularized by Jenner in the late 1790s, kinepox was a far safer method for inoculating people against smallpox than the previous method, [[variolation]], which had a 3% fatality rate.

In a famous letter to [[Meriwether Lewis]] in 1803, [[Thomas Jefferson]] instructed the [[Lewis and Clark expedition]] to "carry with you some matter of the kine-pox; inform those of them with whom you may be, of its efficacy as a preservative from the smallpox; &amp; encourage them in the use of it..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.library.csi.cuny.edu/dept/history/lavender/jefflett.html | title = Jefferson's Instructions to Lewis and Clark (1803) | accessdate = 2007-08-10 | website =  | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070807100953/http://www.library.csi.cuny.edu/dept/history/lavender/jefflett.html | archivedate = 2007-08-07 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson had developed an interest in protecting [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]]s from smallpox, having been aware of [[epidemic]]s along the [[Missouri River]] during the previous century. A year before his special instructions to Lewis, Jefferson had persuaded a visiting [[delegation]] of North American Indian chieftains to be vaccinated with kinepox during the winter of 1801–1802. Unfortunately, Lewis never got the opportunity to use kinepox during the pair's expedition, as it had become inadvertently inactive—a common occurrence in a time before vaccines were [[stabilizer (chemistry)|stabilized]] with [[preservatives]] such as [[glycerol]] or kept at refrigeration temperatures.

==Prevention==
Today, the virus is found in Europe, mainly in the UK. Human cases are very rare (though in 2010 a laboratory worker contracted cowpox&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | title=Cowpox infection in US lab worker called a first|url=http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/bt/smallpox/news/apr2712cowpox.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;) and most often [[Feline zoonosis|contracted from domestic cats]]. Human infections usually remain localized and self-limiting, but can become fatal in [[immunosuppressed]] patients. The virus is not commonly found in cattle; the reservoir hosts for the virus are woodland rodents, particularly voles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author8=Andreas K.,Gudrun W., Hans-peter G., Angelika P. Andreas N. | title = Rat-to-Elephant-to-Human Transmission of Cowpox Virus | journal = EID Journal |volume=14 |issue = 4 |pages = 670–671 | year = 2008 | doi=10.3201/eid1404.070817 | pmid = 18394293 | pmc = 2570944 | author=Kurth Andreas}}&lt;/ref&gt; Domestic cats contract the virus from these rodents. Symptoms in cats include lesions on the face, neck, forelimbs, and paws, and, less commonly, upper respiratory tract infections. Symptoms of infection with cowpox virus in humans are localized, pustular lesions generally found on the hands and limited to the site of introduction. The incubation period is 9 to 10 days. The virus is most prevalent in late summer and autumn.

Immunity to cowpox is gained when the smallpox vaccine is administered. Although the vaccine now uses vaccinia virus, the poxviruses are similar enough that the body becomes immune to both cow- and smallpox.

Mostly redundant, but some of this info may be useful with a better source.

===Science of cowpox===
Cowpox originates on the udders or teats of cows. It is classified as a zoonotic disease, which means it can be transferred from animals to humans and vice versa. Cowpox is an infectious disease. Cowpox symptoms are similar in whichever host they infect: cow, cat, human. Cowpox symptoms include round, pus filled lesions on the skin at the site of infection. In most cases of humans, the lesions develop on the inner and outer parts of the hand and fingers. In some cases, the infected person can develop a mild fever or inflammation around the lesions. Cowpox can be transferred from human to human by contact of the infected site to another individual. It is very similar in pathology and structure in contrast to small pox. However, cowpox has increased activity in between the ectoderm and endoderm layers of the human skin. Cowpox includes both A type bodies and B type inclusion bodies which largely impacts the pathology of the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://virus.stanford.edu/pox/2000/cowpox_virus.html|title=Cowpox Virus|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7792">An estimated 275 Australians develop diabetes every day. The 2005 Australian AusDiab Follow-up Study (Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle Study) showed that 1.7 million Australians have diabetes but that up to half of the cases of type 2 diabetes remain undiagnosed.

== Type 2 ==
Type 2 diabetes is the most common type of diabetes, and majority of those affected are diagnosed with Type 2. Type 2 diabetes is classified as a lifestyle disease which is impacted by environmental and hereditary factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.diabetesaustralia.com.au/Understanding-Diabetes/What-is-Diabetes/Type-2-Diabetes/|title = Type 2 Diabetes|date = 2015|accessdate = |website = Diabetes Australia|publisher = National Diabetes Services Scheme}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of diabetes is significantly affected by the lifestyle the individual has. It is associated with the individuals' diet and activity level. The population who are most at risk are those who adopt a sedentary lifestyle at a young age. some things to take into consideration if you feel that you are at risk of Type 2 diabetes.

=== Prevention ===

* Maintaining a healthy weight
* Regular physical activity
* Managing blood pressure
* Managing cholesterol levels
* Quit/ Avoid smoking&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.diabetesaustralia.com.au/Understanding-Diabetes/What-is-Diabetes/Type-2-Diabetes/|title = Type 2 Diabetes|date = 2015|accessdate = |website = Diabetes Australia|publisher = Australian Government: National Diabetes Service Scheme}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there is no direct cure for Type 2 diabetes the Australian Government: Department of Health&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/F01F92328EDADA5BCA257BF0001E720D/$File/brochure%20PA%20Guidelines_A5_18-64yrs.PDF|title = Australia's Physical Activity and Sedentary Behaviour Guidelines for Adults (18-64)|date = 2014|accessdate = |website = Physical Activity and Sedentary Behaviour|publisher = Australian Government: Department of Health}}&lt;/ref&gt; has put in place guidelines to assure that children and adolescents receive the suggested period of time engaging in physical activity. Some of their suggestions are as follows:
* shift from a low to moderate activity level
* participate in more vigorous activity rather than moderate intensity exercise- you will save time and therefore have more time for friends and family
* avoid long periods of screen time (devices including TV, Phone, etc.)
* avoid long sitting sessions

== Diabetes facts ==
Other facts about diabetes include:

* Every year 0.8% of adults developed diabetes.
* Every day in Australia approximately 275 adults develop diabetes.
* Those with pre-diabetes were 10-20 times more likely to develop diabetes than were those with normal blood glucose levels.
* [[Obesity]], [[hypertension]], [[dyslipidaemia]], physical inactivity and the [[metabolic syndrome]] each increased the risk for developing diabetes.&lt;ref&gt;ELM Barr, DJ Magliano, PZ Zimmet, KR Polkinghorne, RC Atkins, DW Dunstan, SG Murray, JE Shaw 2006, AusDiab 2005 The Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle Study International Diabetes Institute, Melbourne, Australia&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2007-08 approximately 520,000 people had diabetes and CVD meaning only 42% of diabetics did not have CVD. CVD is the major cause of mortality in people suffering from diabetes with CVD accounting for 80% of deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.aihw.gov.au/diabetes-indicators/cardiovascular-disease/|title = Cardiovascular disease|date = 2015|accessdate = 2015-04-13|website = Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW)|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease an update|author1=Sowers, J.R. |author2=Epstein, M. |author3=&amp; Frohlich, E.D. |date = 2001|journal = Journal of the American Heart Association|doi = 10.1161/01.HYP.37.4.1053|pmid = |volume=37 |pages=1053–1059}}&lt;!--|access-date = 2015-04-13 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Diabetes Federation has estimated that currently 194 million people worldwide, or 5.1% within the adult population have diabetes; this will jump to 333 million, or 6.3%, by 2025. Type 2 Diabetes makes up approximately 85% to 95% of all diabetes in developed countries, and is even higher in developing countries.

The European Region, with 48 million, and Western Pacific Region, with 43 million, has the most number of people with diabetes currently. In 2025, the region with the largest number of people with diabetes will to change to the South-East Asian Region with approximately 82 million sufferers.

Right now the age group with the greatest number of people suffering from diabetes are the 40- to 59-year-olds. Due to the ageing population, by 2025 there will be 146 million people aged 40–59 and 147 million people aged 60 or older with diabetes.

In 2003, the number of people with diabetes in urban areas was 78 million and by 2025 it is said to increase to 182 million urban and 61 million rural people with diabetes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.idf.org/sites/default/files/IDF_Diabetes_Atlas_2ndEd.pdf|title = Diabetes Atlas|date = 2003|accessdate = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Epidemiology ===
A [[University of Alberta]] study, conducted in 2006, noted that 60% of Aborigines over the age of 35 in Western Australia tested positive for [[Type 2 diabetes|diabetes]].&lt;ref name="canada"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5ieXed7l8XssHRLx1_B9Iuq7SfjuQ|title=International study links aboriginal health, lifestyle, local decision-making|accessdate=5 July 2009|date=3 July 2009|work= |publisher=The Canadian Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study conducted by the International Diabetes Institute at [[Monash University]] showed that Asians, Pacific Islanders, and Middle Eastern immigrants who moved to Australia were diagnosed with diabetes at a higher level than the average.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Obesity in Australia|url = http://oia.ncsu.edu/sites/oia.ncsu.edu/files/Bob%20Gibson%20Sept%2016.pdf|website = |accessdate = April 6, 2015|last = Gibson|first = Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increase was explained by the adoption of a [[Western diet]] in place of a more healthy "traditional" diet more common in their native countries, as well as adopting a more sedentary lifestyle which is ubiquitous in developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://oia.ncsu.edu/sites/oia.ncsu.edu/files/Bob%20Gibson%20Sept%2016.pdf|title = Obesity in Australia|date = |accessdate = April 6, 2015|website = |publisher = |last = Gibson|first = Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Diabetes Services Scheme===
The National Diabetes Services Scheme (NDSS) is an institution funded by the Australian Government that delivers diabetes-related products at affordable prices and provides information and support services to people with type 1, type 2, gestational and other types of diabetes; the number one national peak body for diabetes in Australia, [[Diabetes Australia]], runs this scheme. State and territory diabetes organisations are also assisting in the arrangements and planning of services for this scheme. The National Diabetes service aim is to ensure appropriate, reliable and affordable access to diabetes-related products and services to support people suffering from diabetes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.search.informit.com.au.ipacez.nd.edu.au/fullText;dn=549923122948267;res=IELAPA|title = The National Diabetes Services Scheme|last = Thompson|first = Madeline|date = 7 July 2012|journal = Australian Pharmacist|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:ERDLatorFig2.jpg|thumb|Photo of an ERDLator in field operation by the 88th Supply and Service Battalion at Sui Doi, Vietnam, in 1969.]]

The '''ERDLator''' was a field [[water treatment]] device developed during [[World War II]]&lt;ref name="army.mil"&gt;[http://www.apgea.army.mil/dehe/pgm31/JAMEDD%20FHP%20and%20Mil.%20DW%20Supp.pdf W.

Belvoir]], Virginia.

Technically named the "Water Purification Unit, Van-Type, Body Mounted, Electric Motor Driven",&lt;ref name = "Army"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ps4XAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=%22TM+5-4610-218-34+Technical+Manual%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiv7cOC3IbUAhXC7yYKHcesCUUQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22TM%205-4610-218-34%20Technical%20Manual%22&amp;f=false|title= US Army TM 5-4610-218-34 Water Purification Unit, Van Type Body Mounted, Electric Motor Driven|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the acronym was incorporated into the name of the purification device itself, creating the name by which it was most widely known, ERDLator, pronounced "erd-a-later".

The device was introduced into the field as a van-type body-mounted mobile unit,&lt;ref name = "Army"/&gt; and proved vitally important to the operational effectiveness of deployed units under harsh field conditions, providing not only the water needed for survival, but clean potable water for staying healthy. This passage from a description of the [[United States Marine Corps]] Engineer Battalion illustrates the ERDLator's significance:
:"One of the most important units was the water supply platoon.  This platoon operated...water purification plants called Erdalators {{sic}} that could remove silt and suspended matter, filter, and purify even contaminated stream water.  Producing from 1-3,000 gallons (about 4,000 to 12,000 liters) per day -- the larger number was achieved using separate large rubberized settling tanks -- one unit could adequately supply an infantry battalion under adverse conditions" &lt;ref name = "GA"&gt;Oscar E. 'Ed' Gilbert with Duncan Anderson, consulting editor, 2006, ''The U.S. Marine Corps in the Vietnam War, III Marine Amphibious Force 1965-75'', Osprey Publishing Ltd., p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

ERDLator units of several production capacities were used for field water purification during the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report | author      = ARMY CONCEPT TEAM IN VIETNAM | date        = December 6, 1967 | title       = WATER SUPPLY IN THE REPUBLIC OF VIETNAM | url         = http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/825260.pdf | publisher   = U.S. Defense Technical Information Center | format      = pdf|pages=A-30, A-34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The unit was replaced in 1979&lt;ref name="army.mil"/&gt; by the [[Reverse Osmosis Water Purification Unit]] (ROWPU) ("Row-pew"), also developed by a U.S. Army laboratory.

[[File:Eddystonelighthouse.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Eddystone, with current lighthouse and stub of previous tower.]]
The '''Eddystone''', or the '''Eddystone Rocks''', are a seaswept and heavily eroded group of rocks some 9 statute miles (14 kilometres) southwest of [[Rame Head]] in [[Cornwall]], [[England]], [[United Kingdom]]. Formerly a treacherous hazard for ships in the approaches to the [[English Channel]] and the port city of [[Plymouth]], the rocks have played host to four iterations of the [[Eddystone Lighthouse]], and are still home to the current [[lighthouse]] and the stub of its immediate predecessor.&lt;ref name=osinfo&gt;{{cite web | title = Get A Map | url = http://getamap.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/getamap/frames.htm?mapAction=gaz&amp;gazName=g&amp;gazString=SX3830333632 | publisher = [[Ordnance Survey]] | accessdate = September 6, 2006 }} View at 1:50000 scale.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=thinfo&gt;{{cite web | title = Eddystone Lighthouse | url = http://www.trinityhouse.co.uk/interactive/gallery/eddystone.html | publisher = [[Trinity House]] | accessdate = September 6, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the nearest point on the mainland to the Eddystone is in Cornwall, the rocks fall within the city limits of Plymouth, and hence within the county of [[Devon]].&lt;ref name="osinfo"/&gt;

There have been four lighthouses on the Eddystone Rocks. Winstanley (two versions; the second however just replaced the top of the structure), Rudyard, Smeaton and finally the Douglass Lighthouse, which is the present one. When the Douglass Lighthouse was completed the people of Plymouth, grateful for the countless lives which had been saved since the introduction of the lighthouses, paid for the dismantling of the Smeaton Lighthouse from the red rocks of Eddystone  and reassembly at Plymouth Hoe, where it is a popular tourist attraction today.

A traditional sea-shanty "The Eddystone Light" chronicles a fictional encounter between the lighthouse keeper and a mermaid. [[The Seekers]], [[the Weavers]], and [[Peter, Paul and Mary]] have recorded the shanty.

== Geology ==
Eddystone rock is something of an anomaly in the geology of the [[Cornubian batholith|South West region]]; it is composed of [[garnet]]iferous [[gneiss]]ic rock which is part of a considerable underwater outcrop of [[mica]]-[[schist]]s and [[granite|granitoid]] gneisses which have not been found elsewhere in [[South West England]].

[[Radiometric dating|Isotopic ages]] suggest that the last period of deformation was during the end of the [[Devonian]], but their highly [[Metamorphic rock|metamorphosed]] state indicates they likely have an older ancestry, a relic of earlier [[orogeny|tectonic activity]], probably of  [[Precambrian]] age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dewey, Henry|title=British Regional Geology, South-West England|year=1975|publisher=British Geological Survey|isbn=0-11-880713-7|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''European Agency for Safety and Health at Work''' ('''EU-OSHA''') is a decentralised [[agency of the European Union]] with the task of collecting, analysing and disseminating relevant information that can serve the needs of people involved in safety and health at work. Set up in 1994 by Council Regulation (EC) No 2062/94 of 18 July 1994,&lt;ref&gt;[https://osha.europa.eu/en/about/regulations list of EU-OSHA Founding Regulations]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=CELEX:01994R2062-20050804 Council Regulation (EC) No 2062/94 of 18 July 1994 establishing a European Agency for Safety and Health at Work]&lt;/ref&gt; EU-OSHA is based in [[Bilbao]], [[Spain]], where it has a staff&lt;ref&gt;[https://osha.europa.eu/en/about/organisation/staff list of the current staff of the EU-OSHA]&lt;/ref&gt; of [[occupational safety and health]], communication and administrative specialists. Dr [[Christa Sedlatschek]] is the current Director of EU-OSHA,&lt;ref&gt;[https://osha.europa.eu/en/about/director_corner Short profile of Dr Christa Sedlatschek at EU-OSHA's website]&lt;/ref&gt; following on from Dr [[Jukka Takala]] in September 2011.

EU-OSHA collects, analyses and disseminates information related to occupational safety and health across the EU and contributes to an evidence base which policymakers can use to establish future policies regarding occupational safety and health. EU-OSHA publishes a monthly newsletter, [[OSHmail]], which deals with occupational health and safety topics, and provides in-depth publications,&lt;ref&gt;[http://osha.europa.eu/en/publications Publications section of the EU-OSHA]&lt;/ref&gt; such as detailed reports, regarding occupational safety and health information.

EU-OSHA works through diverse networks spanning the EU, with its main activities covering three distinct areas: analysis and research, prevention, and campaigning and awareness raising. EU-OSHA was given an important role in the European strategy on Health and Safety at Work (2007–12)&lt;ref&gt;[https://osha.europa.eu/en/eustrategy EU Strategy on Safety and Health at Work]&lt;/ref&gt; and this was reflected in the EU-OSHA Strategy&lt;ref&gt;[https://osha.europa.eu/en/publications/work_programmes/strategy2009-2013/view EU-OSHA Strategy 2009-13, replacing the multi-annual work programme 2005-2008.]&lt;/ref&gt; and Annual Management Plan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://osha.europa.eu/en/publications/corporate/2013-annual-management-plan-work-programme/view 2013 Annual Management Plan &amp; Work Programme of EU-OSHA]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Networks ==
EU-OSHA works in partnership with a wide range of organisations. The [[Directorate-General Employment, Social Affairs &amp; Inclusion]] is its reference at the [[European Commission]]. At a national level, EU-OSHA is represented by a network of "focal points"&lt;ref&gt;[https://osha.europa.eu/en/oshnetwork/focal-points EU-OSHA national focal points network web section]&lt;/ref&gt; in over 30 countries across [[Europe]]. Focal points are usually the primary safety and health organisation of a particular country. Each focal point operates a tripartite national network to ensure that information on safety and health at work can be effectively collected and disseminated.

EU-OSHA emphasises the importance of a tripartite approach, whereby EU-OSHA works in partnership with governments, employers and workers' representatives. This tripartite structure (Governing Board&lt;ref&gt;[https://osha.europa.eu/en/about/organisation/governingboard Composition of the current Governing Board of the EU-OSHA]&lt;/ref&gt;) is key to the way EU-OSHA carries out its campaigns. Through its campaigns EU-OSHA also works with companies and associations in the public and private sector, and with the [[Enterprise Europe Network]] (EEN), a business support network that aims to help small businesses in the European marketplace.

== Main activities ==
=== Analysis and research ===
EU-OSHA is responsible for contributing to the evidence base through commissioning, collecting and publishing studies on occupational safety and health as well as monitoring, collating and analysing statistical information on occupational safety and health risks in workplaces across the EU.

In 2005, EU-OSHA established the [[European Risk Observatory]] (ERO) to try to identify and predict such risks. To achieve this aim, the ERO "provides an overview of safety and health at work in Europe, describes the trends and underlying factors, and anticipates changes in work and their likely impact on occupational safety and health". ERO identifies research areas for prioritisation and indicates the appropriate action that policy and decision makers should take.

In 2009, EU-OSHA carried out an EU-wide survey, the European enterprise survey on new and emerging risks (ESENER). The survey involved approximately 36,000 interviews with managers and health and safety representatives and aimed to get an insight into how European companies were managing health and safety issues. The survey was particularly concerned with "new" psychosocial risks, "such as work-related stress, violence and bullying", and highlighted that these risks are a growing concern.&lt;ref&gt;EU-OSHA – European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, European Survey of Enterprises on New and Emerging Risks - [https://osha.europa.eu/en/publications/reports/esener1_osh_management/view Managing safety and health at work, 2010 ]&lt;/ref&gt; ESENER has provided policy makers with information relevant to the creation of future policies in the area of health and safety and has revealed issues of particular concern that require prioritisation. EU-OSHA has produced a number of follow-up studies&lt;ref&gt;EU-OSHA – European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, 2012 [https://osha.europa.eu/en/publications/reports/esener-summary/view A summary of four secondary analysis reports: Understanding workplace management of safety and health, psychosocial risks and worker participation through ESENER]&lt;/ref&gt; analysing the results of the ESENER and plans to carry out a second survey in 2014.

EU-OSHA is also running an innovative project known as Foresight, which aims to look beyond current safety and health risks to anticipate the potential areas of future concern. Foresight involves looking at the possible scenarios that may arise with technological or wider societal change, and the effect these changes may have on occupational safety and health. The project aims to stimulate debate, and to make it clear to policy- and decision makers what the implications of particular courses of action are. The project also suggests how possible future risks may be avoided. The first Foresight project is concerned with producing "sets of scenarios for 2020, covering a range of ''new technologies in green jobs'' and the impact they could have on workers' safety and health".&lt;ref&gt;[https://osha.europa.eu/en/publications/reports/green-jobs-foresight-new-emerging-risks-technologies/view "Foresight on new and emerging risks associated with new technologies by 2020"], EU-OSHA – European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, Green jobs and occupational safety and health (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prevention ===
EU-OSHA aims to create a culture of risk prevention and is involved with designing practical instruments that can be used by companies of micro, small and medium sizes that will help them to assess workplace risks and to share knowledge and good practices on safety and health. As part of this aim EU-OSHA has created an online interactive risk assessment project ([http://www.oiraproject.eu/ OiRA]), launched in September 2011. The OiRA provides "an easy-to-use and cost-free web application" that allows users to create online risk assessment tools. It is an interactive tool that can be used by any micro or small enterprise to carry out a risk assessment.

=== Campaigning and awareness-raising ===
EU-OSHA is active in raising awareness about [[occupational safety and health]] and these issues are promoted primarily through Healthy Workplaces Campaigns, which have been run with partners in the EU's Member States since 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[https://osha.europa.eu/en/campaigns "EU-OSHA campaigns web page"]&lt;/ref&gt; Each campaign runs for two years and has a different focus. The current campaign, Working together for risk prevention, is concerned with encouraging "managers, workers and other stakeholders to join forces to improve safety and health". As part of each campaign EU-OSHA produces "information, practical guides and tools, and publicity material freely available, translated into more than 20 European languages" The campaigns run in partnership between EU-OSHA and more than 80 campaign partners,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.healthy-workplaces.eu/en/about/campaign-partners#mainContent&lt;/ref&gt; as well as through the agencies' network of national focal points and the [[Enterprise Europe Network]].

Linked to and acting as an annual focus for campaigns, EU-OSHA is coordinating the European Week for Safety and Health at Work, held each year in October, when events such as training sessions, conferences and workshops are held. Such events are organised across Europe by the focal points in Member States.

EU-OSHA, along with six national safety and health organisations, participates in a consortium that has produced a number of animated films which aim to convey the importance of health and safety in the workplace. The main character in these films – known as Napo&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.napofilm.net/ Napo official website]&lt;/ref&gt; – is essentially a typical employee who can be the victim of situations over which he has no control but he can also identify hazards or risks, and make good suggestions to improve safety and work organisation. The films are all language-free, making them widely accessible, and have won a number of awards. Napo has become somewhat of a mascot for EU-OSHA's campaigning activities, and is now being used to introduce health and safety issues to children in primary schools (Napo for teachers&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.napofilm.net/en/napo-for-teachers Study resources for teachers on the Napo website]&lt;/ref&gt;).

[[File:Fertility Clinic near Chennai.jpg|thumb|250px|Fertility Clinic near [[Chennai]], India]]
'''Fertility clinics''' are [[medical clinic]]s that assist couples, and sometimes individuals, who want to become [[parent]]s but for medical reasons have been unable to achieve this goal via the natural course. Clinics apply a number of diagnosis tests and sometimes very advanced medical treatments to achieve [[Fertilisation|conceptions]] and [[pregnancy|pregnancies]].

==Clinic staff==
Fertility clinics are staffed with trained personnel including reproductive endocrinologists, [[embryologist]]s, [[sonographer]]s, and [[nurse]]s.  Additional specialists from [[acupuncture]], [[hypnotherapy]], and [[nutrition]] may also be part of the team.

==Diagnosis==
Fertility clinics look to both males and females for diagnosis of fertility problems. Diagnosis has shown that fertility problems arise 35% of the time from males, 35% from female, 20% from combined issues, and 10% from unexplained causes. For the male, [[semen collection]] is a standard diagnostic test to ascertain problems with the [[semen quality]], while females may undergo a number of tests including an ovulation analysis, x-ray of fallopian tubes and uterus, and laparoscopy.&lt;ref&gt;How is Infertility Diagnosed? - [http://www.asrm.org/Patients/faqs.html American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM)]&lt;/ref&gt; They may also perform [[ultrasound]]s by a sonographer and advanced pregnancy tests.

==Treatment==
Treatment may include ovulation induction, surgical interventions, [[artificial insemination]], such as [[intrauterine insemination]] (IUI), [[in vitro fertilization]] (IVF), or the use of an [[egg donor]] or a [[sperm donor]]. In vitro fertilization is the most well known of the [[assisted reproductive technology]] procedures performed at a fertility clinic. Advanced male infertility treatments such as TESA (Testicular Epididymal Sperm Aspiration) is also provided by fertility clinics these days.

==Comparing clinics==
The Centers for Disease Control requires outcome data be reported to the Society of Assisted Reproductive Technology (SART) which is the organization that compiles statistics.&lt;ref&gt;Patient Benefits - [http://www.sart.org/PatientBenefits.html Society of Assisted Reproductive Technology (SART)]&lt;/ref&gt; Fertility clinics are often compared by these IVF success rates.  However, it's important to note that SART puts a caution at bottom of each report that reads "Patient characteristics vary among programs; therefore, these data should not be used for comparing clinics."  A consultation with many fertility clinics is always a good option to get a more complete comparison for a patients specific situation and needs. 

==In fiction==
[[Medical drama]]s set in a fertility clinic include "[[Inconceivable]]" which ran for two episodes in 2005 before being cancelled, and "[[The Family Man (UK TV series)|The Family Man]]", a British series in three parts. Furthermore, [[Private Practice (TV series)|Private Practice]] is set in a clinic that offers fertility services to a large extent.

==Signs and symptoms==

The changes in fibrocystic breast disease are characterised by the appearance of [[fibrous]] [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] and a lumpy, [[cobblestone]] texture in the breasts. These lumps are smooth with defined edges, and are usually free-moving in regard to adjacent structures. The bumps can sometimes be obscured by irregularities in the breast that are associated with the condition. The lumps are most often found in the upper, outer sections of the breast (nearest to the [[armpit]]), but can be found throughout the breast. Women with fibrocystic changes may experience a persistent or intermittent breast aching or [[breast tenderness]] related to periodic swelling.  Breasts and [[nipples]] may be tender or [[itch]]y.

Symptoms follow a periodic trend tied closely to the [[menstrual cycle]]. Symptoms tend to peak in the days and, in severe cases, weeks before each [[Menstruation|period]] and decrease afterwards. At peak, breasts may feel full, heavy, swollen, and tender to the touch. No complications related to [[breastfeeding]] have been found.

==Pathophysiology==
[[Image:Fibrocystic changes of breast - cytology 1.jpg|thumb| [[Micrograph]] showing [[apocrine metaplasia]] associated with FCC. [[FNA specimen]]. [[Pap stain]].]]

The exact mechanism of the condition is not fully understood, though it is known to be tied to [[hormone]] levels, as the condition usually subsides after [[menopause]] and is also related to the menstrual cycle.  Post-menopausal women placed on [[hormone replacement therapy]] (HRT) have also reported symptoms of FBC indicating hormones may play a role.

Fibrocystic breast changes is a cumulative process, caused partly by the normal hormonal variation during a woman's monthly cycle. The most important of these hormones are [[estrogen]], [[progesterone]] and [[prolactin]].

These hormones directly affect the breast tissues by causing cells to grow and multiply.&lt;ref name="Medicine Net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/fibrocystic_breast_condition/page2.htm#13whatcauses |title=Fibrocystic Breast Condition}}2010/04/13, MedicineNet.com&lt;/ref&gt; Many other hormones such as [[Thyroid-stimulating hormone|TSH]], [[insulin]], [[growth hormone]] and growth factors such as [[TGF-beta]] exert direct and indirect effects amplifying or regulating cell growth. Years of such fluctuations eventually produce small [[breast cyst|cysts]] and/or areas of dense or fibrotic tissue. Multiple small cysts and an increasing level of breast pain commonly develop when a woman hits her 30s. Larger cysts usually do not occur until after the age of 35.&lt;ref name="USA Today"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthscout.com/ency/68/167/main.html#CausesandRiskFactorsofFibrocysticBreastDisease |title=Fibrocystic Breast Condition}}2010/04/13&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, presumably driven by aberrant growth signals, such lesions may accumulate epigenetic, genetic and karyotypic changes such as modified expression of hormone receptors and loss of heterozygosity.

Several variants of fibrocystic breast changes may be distinguished and these may have different causes and genetic predispostions. Adenosis involves abnormal count and density of lobular units, while other lesions appear to stem mainly from ductal epithelial origins.

There is preliminary evidence that [[iodine deficiency]] contributes to fibrocystic breast changes by enhancing the sensitivity of breast tissue to [[estrogen]].&lt;ref name="Cannvan Netten2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cann|first1=Stephen A.|last2=van Netten|first2=Johannes P.|last3=van Netten|first3=Christiaan|title=Hypothesis: iodine, selenium and the development of breast cancer|journal=Cancer Causes and Control|volume=11|issue=2|year=2000|pages=121–127|issn=0957-5243|doi=10.1023/A:1008925301459|pmid=10710195|type=review}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PizzornoMurray2012-p1371"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Joseph E.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is mostly done based on symptoms after exclusion of breast cancer. Nipple fluid aspiration can be used to classify cyst type (and to some extent improve breast cancer risk prediction) but it is rarely used in practice. [[Biopsy]] or fine needle aspiration are rarely warranted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Benign Breast Disease: When  To Treat, When To Reassure, When To Refer | journal=Cleveland Clinic Journal of Medicine | volume=69 | issue=5 | pages=424–439 | date=May 2002 | doi=10.3949/ccjm.69.5.425 | last1=Vaidyanathan | first1=L. | last2=Barnard | first2=K. | last3=Elnicki | first3=D M. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fibrocystic breast disease is primarily diagnosed based on the symptoms, clinical [[breast exam]] and on a physical exam. During this examination, the doctor checks for unusual areas in the breasts, both visually and manually. Also, the [[lymph nodes]] in the axilla area and lower neck are examined. A complete and accurate [[medical history]] is also helpful in diagnosing this condition. If the patient's medical history and physical exam findings are consistent with normal breast changes, no additional tests are considered but otherwise the patient will be asked to return a few weeks later for reassessment.&lt;ref name="Fibrocystic breasts"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/fibrocystic-breasts/DS01070/DSECTION=tests-and-diagnosis |title=Tests and diagnosis |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100322230705/http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/fibrocystic-breasts/DS01070/DSECTION%3Dtests-and-diagnosis |archivedate=2010-03-22 |df= }}2010/04/13&lt;/ref&gt; Women may detect lumps in their breasts during self-examination as well.

===Imaging===
In order to establish whether the lump is a cyst or not, several imaging tests may be performed. [[Mammography]] is usually the first imaging test to be ordered when unusual breast changes have been detected during a physical examination. A diagnostic mammography consists in a series of [[x-rays]] that provide clear images of specific areas of the breast.

[[Ultrasounds]] and [[MRIs]] are commonly performed in conjunction with mammographies as they produce clear images of the breast and clearly distinguish between fluid-filled breast cysts and solid masses. The ultrasound and MRI exams can better evaluate dense tissue of the breast; hence it is often undergone by young patients, under 30 years old.

===Biopsy===
The breast [[biopsy]] is usually the test used to confirm the suspected diagnosing. After imaging tests have been performed and have revealed unusual areas or lumps in the breast, a breast biopsy will be ordered. This test consists in removing a sample of breast tissue which is then looked at under a [[microscope]]. The specialist analyzing the tissue sample will be able to conclude if the breast changes are benign or malignant or whether breast fibrocystic disease is present.

There are four main types of breast biopsies that may be performed. A fine-needle aspiration biopsy is usually ordered when the doctor is almost certain that the lump is a cyst.&lt;ref name="Health Concerns"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lef.org/protocols/prtcl-145a.shtml#diag |title=Diagnosing Fibrocystic Breast Disease}}2010/04/13&lt;/ref&gt; This test is generally performed in conjunction with an ultrasound which is helpful in guiding the needle into a small or hard to find lump. The procedure is painless and it consists in inserting a thin needle into the breast tissue while the lump is palpated.

The core-needle biopsy is normally performed under local [[anesthesia]] and in a physician's office. The needle used in this procedure is slightly larger than the one used for a fine-needle biopsy because the procedure is intended to remove a small cylinder of tissue that will be sent to the [[laboratory]] for further examination.

A newer type of breast biopsy is the [[stereotactic]] biopsy that relies on a three-dimensional x-ray to guide the needle biopsy of non-palpable mass. The biopsy is performed in a similar manner, by using a needle to remove tissue sample but locating the specific area of the breast is done by x-raying the breast by two different angles. Surgical biopsy is a procedure performed to remove the entire lump or a part of it for laboratory analyzing. It may be painful and it is done under local anesthesia.

==Treatment==
{{main|Mastodynia#Treatments for cyclical breast pain}}

Most women with fibrocystic changes and no symptoms do not need treatment, but closer follow-up may be advised.&lt;ref name="Cancer Org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.org/docroot/CRI/content/CRI_2_6X_Non_Cancerous_Breast_Conditions_59.asp#Types_of_non-cancerous_breast_conditions |title=Types of non-cancerous breast conditions }}2010/04/13&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no widely accepted treatment or prevention strategy for fibrocystic condition. When treatment of symptoms is necessary it follows the same strategies as treatment for [[mastodynia|cyclical breast pain]].

It is controversial whether benign breast conditions improve or worsen with [[oral contraceptives]] or [[hormone replacement therapy]].&lt;ref name="pmid22334232"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gadducci A, Guerrieri ME, Genazzani AR |title=Benign breast diseases, contraception and hormone replacement therapy |journal=Minerva Ginecologica |volume=64 |issue=1 |pages=67–74 |date=February 2012  |pmid=22334232 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few small-scale studies have indicated that the fibrocystic condition may be improved by dietary changes (especially by a reduced intake of [[caffeine]] and related [[methylxanthines]] or by a reduced intake of salt) and by vitamin supplements.&lt;ref&gt;Ethel Sloane, ''Biology of Women'', Cengage Learning, 2002, [https://books.google.com/books?id=kqcYyk7zlHYC&amp;pg=PA200 p. 200-201]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tentative evidence shown beneficial effects of iodine supplementation in women with fibrocystic breast changes.&lt;ref name="Cannvan Netten2000"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Iodine-HealthProfessional/|title=Iodine: Fact Sheet for Health Professionals|publisher=NIH|accessdate=2015-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kessler JH |title=The effect of supraphysiologic levels of iodine on patients with cyclic mastalgia |journal=The Breast Journal |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=328–36 |year=2004 |pmid=15239792 |doi=10.1111/j.1075-122X.2004.21341.x |type=Randomized Controlled Trial}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prognosis==
There are usually no adverse side effects to this condition. In almost all cases it subsides after [[menopause]]. A possible complication arises through the fact that [[cancerous]] tumors may be more difficult to detect in women with fibrocystic changes.

===Breast cancer risk===
Breast cancer risk is elevated for defined fraction of lesions. Except for people with a strong family history of breast cancer,  where the risk is two-fold, nonproliferative lesions have no increased risk. Proliferative lesions also have approximately a 2-fold risk. In particular, atypical [[hyperplasia]] is associated with an increased risk of developing breast cancer.&lt;ref&gt;Ethel Sloane, ''Biology of Women'', Cengage Learning, 2002, [https://books.google.com/books?id=kqcYyk7zlHYC&amp;pg=PA200 p. 200]&lt;/ref&gt; Atypical lobular hyperplasia is associated with the greatest risk, approximately 5-fold and especially high relative risk of developing premenopausal breast cancer. Atypical ductal hyperplasia is associated with 2.4-fold risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Marshall | first1 = LM| last2 = Hunter | first2 = DJ| last3 = Connolly | first3 = JL| last4 = Schnitt | first4 = SJ| last5 = Byrne | first5 = C| last6 = London | first6 = SJ| last7 = Colditz | first7 = GA| year = 1997| title = Risk of breast cancer associated with atypical hyperplasia of lobular and ductal types| journal = Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers &amp; Prevention| volume = 6 | issue = 5 | pages = 297–301| pmid = 9149887}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, a New England Journal of Medicine article &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 16034008| year = 2005| author1 = Hartmann| first1 = L. C.| title = Benign breast disease and the risk of breast cancer| journal = New England Journal of Medicine| volume = 353| issue = 3| pages = 229–37| last2 = Sellers| first2 = T.

W.| doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa044383}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that for women with a strong familial history of breast cancer,  the risk of future breast cancer is roughly doubled,  independent of histological status.   The article further states "The relative risk of breast cancer for the cohort was 1.56 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.45 to 1.68), and this increased risk persisted for at least 25 years after biopsy. The relative risk associated with atypia was 4.24 (95 percent confidence interval, 3.26 to 5.41), as compared with a relative risk of 1.88 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.66 to 2.12) for proliferative changes without atypia and of 1.27 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.15 to 1.41) for nonproliferative lesions. The strength of the family history of breast cancer, available for 4808 women, was a risk factor that was independent of histologic findings. No increased risk was found among women with no family history and nonproliferative findings. In the first 10 years after the initial biopsy, an excess of cancers occurred in the same breast, especially in women with atypia."

It is not well understood whether the lesions are precursors of breast cancer or only indication of increased risk, for most types of lesions the chance of developing breast cancer is nearly the same in  the affected and unaffected breast (side) indicating only coincidence of risk factors. For atypical lobular hyperplasia there is high incidence of ipsilateral breast cancers indicating a possible direct [[carcinogenesis|carcinogenetic]] link.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Page | first1 = D.

==Epidemiology==
The estimated figures for the prevalence of fibrocystic breast changes in women over lifetime vary widely in the literature, with estimates ranging from about 30 to 60 %&lt;ref name="Norwood1990"&gt;{{cite journal| author =Susan L. Norwoord | title = Fibrocystic Breast Disease An Update and Review | journal = JOGNN – Journal of Obstetric Gynecologic, &amp; Neonatal Nursing | volume = 19 | issue = 2 | pages = 116–121 | date = March 1990 | doi=10.1111/j.1552-6909.1990.tb01629.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; over about 50 to 60 %&lt;ref name="McGarryTong2012-p86"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kelly A. McGarry|author2=Iris L. Tong|title=The 5-Minute Consult Clinical Companion to Women's Health|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fR-Gh78xyp8C&amp;pg=PA86|date=6 July 2012|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=978-1-4511-1654-0|pages=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; to about 60 to 75% of all women.&lt;ref name="Smith2008-p371"&gt;{{cite book|author=Roger P. Smith|title=Netter's Obstetrics and Gynecology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1QDjYKwKAsYC&amp;pg=PA371|date=1 December 2008|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=978-1-4377-2137-9|pages=371}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The condition is most common among women between 30 and 50 years of age.&lt;ref name="Smith2008-p371"/&gt;

==Terminology==
In [[ICD-10]] the condition is called ''diffuse cystic mastopathy'', or, if there is epithelial proliferation, ''fibrosclerosis of breast''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apps.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10online/ Disorders of breast (N60-N64)] in [[ICD-10]].&lt;/ref&gt; Other names for this condition include ''chronic cystic mastitis'', ''fibrocystic mastopathy''  and ''mammary dysplasia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Atlantic Women’s Specialists | title=Fibrocystic Breast Changes | url=http://www.awsphysicians.com/health-topics/article/6/Fibrocystic-Breast-Changes.php| accessdate = 21 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The condition has also been named after several people (see [[eponym]]s below). Since it is a very common disorder, some authors have argued that it should not be termed a "disease",&lt;ref name="pmid16034013"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Santen RJ, Mansel R |title=Benign breast disorders |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=353 |issue=3 |pages=275–85 |date=July 2005 |pmid=16034013 |doi=10.1056/NEJMra035692 |url=|pmc=2383044 }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas others feel that it meets the criteria for a disease. It is not a classic form of [[mastitis]] (breast inflammation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Ultrasound Characterization of Breast Masses| journal= Indian Journal of Radiology and Imaging | volume = 19 | issue= 3 | pages=242–247 | date=August 2009 | doi=10.4103/0971-3026.54878| pmid= 19881096 | pmc= 2766883 | last1= Gokhale | first1= Sudheer }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eponyms===
This entity has historically also been termed ''Bloodgood’s disease'', ''Cooper's disease'' (after [[Astley Cooper|Sir Astley Paston Cooper, 1st baronet]]), ''Phocas' disease'', ''Reclus’ disease'' and ''Reclus’ syndrome'' (after [[Paul Reclus]]), ''Reclus-Schimmelbusch disease'', ''Schimmelbusch disease'' and ''Tillaux-Phocas disease''.&lt;ref&gt;{{WhoNamedIt|synd|1891}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5641">The '''Case Fresno''' is the name assigned by the [[Catalonia]] media and public opinion to the [[Federation of International Roller Sports]] (FIRS) assembly held at [[Fresno, California|Fresno]], [[California]], on 26 November 2004. It meant that for the first time in history, an international sport team that had been accepted provisionally was later not accepted definitely. At the same time, it was the first time that a regional sport team (Catalonia) had been registered with the opposition of the state the region belonged to ([[Spain]]). The Spanish sport organizations actively lobbied against the Catalonia membership among the members of the assembly. At the Fresno assembly, the membership application was rejected (8–114). However, the [[Federació Catalana de Patinatge]] brought the case to the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] (TAS) at [[Lausanne]], which admitted irregularities in the assembly (notably the lack of secrecy in the vote), invalidated the vote, and forced the FIRS to repeat the vote following the FIRS statute rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tas-cas.org/fr/pdf/catalans.PDF |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-11-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051019233616/http://www.tas-cas.org/fr/pdf/catalans.PDF |archivedate=2005-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An extraordinary FIRS assembly was held in Rome on November 24, 2005, and again rejected the membership application of the Catalan federation (125–43).

After being granted a temporary membership, Catalonia played the World Championship B, at [[Macau]], ([[China]]), in October 2004, winning it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurosport.es/home/pages/v4/l6/s155/sport_lng6_spo155_sto650587.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-11-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050426230823/http://www.eurosport.es/home/pages/v4/l6/s155/sport_lng6_spo155_sto650587.shtml |archivedate=2005-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Catalonia qualified to play the full World Championship, where it played in the same group as Spain.

==Spain's opposition==
Some [[Catalonia|Catalan]] media have denounced the pressions by the Spanish government and sport organizations on the members of the assembly [http://catalanhockey.blogspot.com/2004/11/plot-reveals.html].

Representatives from [[Chile]] [http://usuarios.lycos.es/fresno05/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=19] or [[Italy]] (Sabatino Aracu, member of [[Forza Italia]]) [http://www.forzaitalia.org/gruppo/deputati/leggiComunicati.asp?codiceDeputato=17&amp;news_id=2341] would allegedly suffered from such pressions or receive instructions from their national governments.

The [[Czech Republic]] representative Radek Pavelec admitted that his federation had received pressures from the Spanish government [http://catalanhockey.blogspot.com/2004/11/plot-reveals.html].

In addition, a letter of the Consejo Superior de Deported (CSD, the Spanish Council for Sports) to the [[Colombia]]n federation in which the Spaniards were asking for the vote against Catalonia has been made public. In that letter the CSD stated that the recognition of [[Catalonia]] would alter the Spanish sport national unity and would create a wrong precedent.
The same letter was sent to some other South American federations [http://usuarios.lycos.es/fresno05/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=65].

The [[Germany|German]] representative admitted that she was contacted by the German MP for Sport demanding the vote against Catalonia. Literally he asked her to make sure she was coming back from Fresno with a "no" against Catalonia.

==Repetition of the vote in Rome==

On 29 November 2005, the FIRS assembly, meeting in Rome, he repeated the final vote on the admission of the Catalan Federation of Skating.

In this case the method of voting was secret and the president of the Catalan Ramon Basiana was able to defend the nomination.

The '''German Society for Hygiene and Microbiology''' ({{lang-de|Deutsche Gesellschaft für Hygiene und Mikrobiologie}}, DGHM), formerly known as the '''Society for Microbiology''', is a German [[medical society]], which works to advance research in the fields of [[infectious diseases]] and [[microbiology]]. It was founded in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;Arnd Schweitzer, ''Deutsche Gesellschaft für Hygiene und Mikrobiologie 1906–2006'', Inst. für Hygiene u. Mikrobiologie, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7847">The '''Global Food Safety Initiative''' ('''GFSI''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mygfsi.com/|title=MyGFSI - Global Food Safety Initiative|website=MyGFSI}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a private organization, established and managed by the international trade association, the [[Consumer Goods Forum]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theconsumergoodsforum.com/ The Consumer Goods Forum]&lt;/ref&gt; under [[Law of Belgium|Belgian law]] in May 2000. The GFSI maintains a scheme to benchmark food safety standards for manufacturers as well as [[farm assurance]] standards.

==About==
The Global Food Safety Initiative is a business-driven initiative for the continuous improvement of [[food safety]] management systems to ensure [[confidence]] in the delivery of safe food to consumers worldwide. GFSI provides a platform for collaboration between some of the world’s leading food safety experts from retailer, manufacturer and food service companies, service providers associated with the food supply chain, international organizations, academia and government.

The initiative was launched in 2000 following a number of food safety crises when consumer confidence was at an all-time low. Since then, experts from all over the world have been collaborating in numerous Technical Working Groups to tackle current food safety issues defined by GFSI stakeholders.

Key activities within GFSI include the definition of food safety requirements for food safety schemes through a benchmarking process. This process is thought to lead to recognition of existing food safety schemes and enhances confidence, acceptance and implementation of third party certification along the entire food supply chain.

GFSI’s current focus is on extending the requirements to cover all scopes of the global food [[supply chain]] "from [[farm to fork]]". 
Other important current activities include the development of a capacity building programme for small and/or less developed businesses to facilitate their access to local markets and a continuous focus on food safety auditor competence to bring industry experts in collaboration with key stakeholders to a common consensus on the skills, knowledge and attributes that a competent auditor should possess.

==Benchmarking==
Within GFSI, [[benchmarking]] is a “procedure by which a food safety-related scheme is compared to the GFSI Guidance Document".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mygfsi.com/gfsifiles/Guidance_Document_Sixth_Edition_Version_6.1.pdf|title=MyGFSI - Page not found|publisher=}}{{dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Back in 2000, food safety was a top of mind issue for companies due to several high-profile recalls, quarantines and negative publicity about the food industry. There was also extensive audit fatigue through the industry, as retailers performed inspections or audits themselves or asked a third party to do this on their behalf. These were often carried out against food safety schemes that lacked international certification and accreditation, resulting in incomparable auditing results.

CEOs of global companies came together at The Consumer Goods Forum (CIES at the time) and agreed that consumer trust needed to be strengthened and maintained through a safer supply chain. GFSI was created to achieve this through the harmonisation of food safety standards that would help reduce audit duplication throughout the supply chain. At the time, there was no existing scheme that could be qualified as “global” that could be adopted by all. GFSI therefore chose to go down the route of benchmarking, developing a model that determines equivalency between existing food safety schemes, whilst leaving flexibility and choice in the marketplace.

This benchmarking model is based on the GFSI Guidance Document, a multi-stakeholder document that was drafted with input from food safety experts from all over the world, and defines the process by which food safety schemes may gain recognition by GFSI and gives guidance to these schemes. GFSI drives continuous improvement through the Guidance Document, which is updated on a regular basis with global industry input to ensure that the requirements for food safety management schemes are robust. GFSI does not undertake any certification or accreditation activities.

The GFSI objectives are to:
* Reduce food safety risks by delivering equivalence and convergence between effective food safety management systems
* Manage cost in the global food system by eliminating redundancy and improving operational efficiency
* Develop competencies and capacity building in food safety to create consistent and effective global food systems
* Provide a unique international stakeholder platform for collaboration, knowledge exchange and networking&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mygfsi.com/about-gfsi/vision-mission-and-objectives.html|title=MyGFSI - Page not found|publisher=}}{{dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==
GFSI has recognized a number of food safety management schemes that fulfill the criteria of the GFSI Guidance Document. The GFSI Guidance Document is regularly revised by GFSI to reflect improvements in best practices. GFSI is not a scheme in itself and does not carry out any accreditation or certification activities.

The status of recognition is achieved through a comprehensive benchmarking process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mygfsi.com/about-gfsi/certification.html|title=MyGFSI - How to achieve certification|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once a standard has gained formal recognition by the GFSI Board of Directors, this standard is deemed to meet all of the requirements in the Guidance Document.

Certification according to a GFSI recognized scheme can be achieved through a successful [[Certification|third party audit]] against any of the following schemes recognized by the GFSI:

'''Health care in Colombia''' refers to the prevention, treatment, and management of illness and the preservation of mental and physical well being through the services offered by the [[Medicine in Colombia|medical]], [[nursing]], and [[allied health]] professions in the [[Republic of Colombia]].

==Health issues==
[[Tropical diseases]] are important issues in Colombia because they area major causes of death. [[Malaria]] affects nearly 85% of the national territory, mainly the [[Pacific ocean]] coast, the [[Amazon Rainforest|Amazon jungle]] and eastern [[savanna]]s, with an estimated of 250,000 cases/year and a [[mortality rate]] of 3/100,000.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;http://web.unab.edu.co/editorialunab/revistas/medunab/pdfs/ed719.pdf  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529034430/http://web.unab.edu.co/editorialunab/revistas/medunab/pdfs/ed719.pdf |date=May 29, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The main agent is ''[[Plasmodium vivax]]'' with 66% of the cases, except on the Pacific coast, where ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]'' causes 75% of the cases.

[[Yellow fever]] and [[Dengue fever]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medicosgeneralescolombianos.com/sitio/guias/Dengue.htm Guia De Atencion Del Dengue]&lt;/ref&gt; are major public health concerns, because of their high [[epidemic]] potential, high mortality rate and wide distribution of ''[[Aedes aegypti]]''. The Colombian government develops [[vaccination]] campaigns against yellow fever on a regular basis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.disaster-info.net/desplazados/informes/fiebreamarilla/fiebreamarillaene2004.htm Documento Publicado por Salud y Desplazamiento http://pagina.de/desplazados&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Common lancehead.jpg|thumb|[[Bothrops atrox]] is the main cause of death for [[snakebite]] in Colombia.]]
[[Chagas disease]] is [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] to the [[Santander Department]] and nearby areas. Other diseases such as [[Leishmania]], [[rabies]], [[Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus]] and [[West nile virus]] are also present in Colombia.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;  [[Snakebite]]s are a big concern, because of the shortage in [[antivenom]] supplies countrywide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.col.ops-oms.org/docs/estadisticasmps/MORDEDURA%20SERPIENTES%202004.ppt |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926135528/http://www.col.ops-oms.org/docs/estadisticasmps/MORDEDURA%20SERPIENTES%202004.ppt |archivedate=2007-09-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first graduated medical doctor, Alvaro de Aunón came to New Granada  from [[Seville]] [[Spain]],  in 1597 and stayed for a short time. The first [[Pharmacy|drug-store]] in Colombia was opened at the same time, in the main square of Bogotá by Pedro Lopez Buiza.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abcmedicus.com/especialidad/medicos/2/id/55/historia_medicina_colombiana.html Historia medicina colombiana&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102161706/http://www.abcmedicus.com/especialidad/medicos/2/id/55/historia_medicina_colombiana.html |date=2010-01-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1636, Rodrigo Enriquez de Andrade started the first faculty of medicine in the New Granada, at St Bartholomew's College with little success because of the prejudices against the medical career in the Spanish culture, where it was considered vulgar and proper of lower-class people. Most of the medical practice in the country was provided by people without formal education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.compumedicina.com/historia/hm_main.shtml Historia de la Medicina - Compumedicina&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203174026/http://www.compumedicina.com/historia/hm_main.shtml |date=2007-02-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first medical book written in Colombia was "''Tratado de medicina y modelo de curar en estas partes de Indias''" ({{lang-en|Treatise on Medice and Models for Curing in These Parts of the Indies}}) by Pedro Fernandez de Valenzuela (1662).

In 1740, don Vicente Tomás Cansino started the medical program at [[Our Lady of the Rosary University]]. The medical care at the time was made almost exclusively in the particular homes of the sick people due lo the lack of health institutions. The first hospital in Colombia was San Pedro Hospital, in the capital city [[Bogotá]]. The hospital started functioning in 1564, built by bishop [[Juan de los Barrios]]. In 1739 the [[Hospital San Juan de Dios, Bogota]] was opened,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scc.org.co/documents/hospital%20san%20juan.pdf SINTITUL-4&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307235714/http://www.scc.org.co/documents/hospital%20san%20juan.pdf |date=2008-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; built by fray Pedro Pablo Villamor.

In 1877, [[Anna Galvis Hotz]] became the first Colombian woman to become a [[Doctor of Medicine]] having graduated the [[University of Bern]] in [[Switzerland]] since women could not attend university in Colombia at the time. In 1925, [[Paulina Beregoff]] became the first woman to become a Doctor of Medicine from a Colombian institution, the Russian-American graduated from the [[University of Cartagena]]. In 1945, [[Inés Ochoa Pérez]] became the first Colombian woman to become a Doctor of Medicine from a Colombian institution having graduated from the [[National University of Colombia]].

Health standards in Colombia have improved greatly since the 1980s. A 1993 reform transformed the structure of public health care funding by shifting the burden of subsidy from providers to users. As a result, employees have been obligated to pay into health plans to which employers also contribute. Although this new system has widened population coverage by the social and health security system from 21% (pre-1993) to 56% in 2004 and 66% in 2005, health disparities persist, with the poor continuing to suffer relatively high mortality rates.

The [[refractive surgery]] [[keratomileusis]] was developed by [[Ignacio Barraquer]] in 1964 in Bogotá. On January 10, 1985, Dr. Elkin Lucena performed the first successful [[In vitro fertilization]], that allowed the birth of the first Latin American [[test tube baby]] Carolina Mendez. On December 14, 1985 the Dr. Alberto Villegas performed the first [[heart transplant]] in Latin America to Antonio Yepes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.compumedicina.info/cursos/p0005.htm Historia de la Cirugía.

On May 20, 1994  Dr. [[Manuel Elkin Patarroyo]] received the [[Prince of Asturias Awards]] by his technical and scientific research in the development of synthetic [[malaria vaccine]].

In 2002 Colombia had 58,761 physicians, 23,950 nurses, and 33,951 dentists; these numbers equated to 1.35 physicians, 0.55 nurses, and 0.78 dentists per 1,000 people, respectively. In 2005 Colombia was reported to have only 1.1 physicians per 1,000 people, as compared with a Latin American average of 1.5.

== Status of public health ==
General government spending on health accounted for 20.5% of total government expenditures and for 84.1% of total health expenditures (private expenditures made up the balance) in 2003. Total expenditures on health constituted 5.6 percent of gross domestic product in 2005. The per capita expenditure on health care in 2005 at an average exchange rate was US$150.&lt;ref name=cp&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Colombia.pdf Colombia country profile]. [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (February 2007). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt;

Urban and rural residents experienced significant differences in access to health care. The coverage in the three largest cities—Bogotá, Medellín, and Cali—was almost 95 percent. At the rural level, the best services were delivered by the departments in the coffee-growing areas. At the bottom of the scale—in terms of quality and coverage—were the rural areas in the non-Andean regions as well as the marginal neighborhoods in medium-sized and small cities.

Since 2001–2 Colombia has halved its homicide rate, which was more than 60 per 100,000 inhabitants, or 28,837, in 2002, one of the world’s highest homicide rates. In 2006, a total of 17,206 violent deaths were recorded, the lowest figure since 1987. Other than homicide, heart disease is the main cause of premature death, followed by strokes, respiratory diseases, road accidents, and diabetes. Waterborne diseases such as cerebral malaria and leishmaniasis are prevalent in lowland and coastal areas. Child immunization for measles in 2004 as a percentage of children under 12 months of age was 92 percent.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;

Acquired immune deficiency syndrome ([[AIDS]]) is the fifth-leading cause of death in the working-age population. According to Colombia’s National Health Institute data reported in 2003, nearly 240,000 people — mostly women and young people — or 0.6 percent of the population had been infected with the virus since AIDS arrived in Colombia in October 1983. Estimates of the number of people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), adults and children (0–49 years of age), in 2005 ranged from 160,000 to 310,000. The comparable figure for women (15–49 years of age) was 62,000. The number of AIDS and [[hepatitis B]] cases has been rising. In 2005, the estimated HIV adult prevalence rate (15–49 years of age) was 0.6 percent. As of 2006, between 5,200 and 12,000 people had died from AIDS. Services provided by the new Multisectoral National Plan, launched in July 2004, include integrated care for people living with HIV and provision of antiretroviral drugs. Under the plan, about 12,000 people have been receiving combined antiretroviral therapy (approximately 54% of those requiring it).&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;

== Law 100 of 1993 ==
The national constitution was reformed in 1991 and with this purpose the general system of social security was reformed with the implementation of Law 100, which widely extended health coverage to the population; the economic resources to finance this reform, however,  were insufficient, causing the collapse of many public health institutions and affecting the income of the medical staff.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deslinde.org.co/Dsl36/dsl36_la_ley_100.htm La Ley 100&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
The law 100 of 1993 is divided into four books:
* First book: About [[Pension]] regulations.
* Second book: About the general system of [[healthcare]]
* Third book: About [[Occupational safety and health]]
* Fourth book: About Complementary social services

The reform of the Colombian healthcare had three main goals: 
* The achievement of an [[antitrust]] policy, to avoid the statal health [[monopoly]].
* The incorporation of private health providers into the healthcare market
* The creation of a [[subsidy|subsidiated]] healthcare sector covering the poorest population.

The general principles of the law determine that healthcare is a public service that must be granted under conditions of proficiency, universality, [[social solidarity]] and participation.  Article 153 of the law mandates that [[health insurance]] be compulsory, that health providers must have administrative autonomy, and that health users must have free choice of health providers.

== SISBEN ==
The System for the Selection of Beneficiaries for Social Programs (El Sistema de Seleccion de Beneficiarios para Programas Sociales), the national system of identification of beneficiaries for social subsidy, classifies the people according to the residential properties that should receive public services.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iadb.org/sds/doc/776eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="estrato"&gt;CONGRESO DE COLOMBIA.

Most of the social subsidies and public health programs are focused in strata 1 and 2 (and the newly introduced stratum 0 &lt;ref&gt;http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-1757051&lt;/ref&gt;). The fraudulent expedition of low level SISBEN ID cards is currently one of the major problems in the healthcare system. Regional politicians are often accused of providing them in exchange for votes to people that are not genuinely in need. Wrong identification of beneficiaries and political issues present a challenge to the system which is preventing people in need from receiving the subsidies and benefits designed for them.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

== EPS ==
The National Health Superintendent (Superintendencia de Salud) defines which organizations may qualify as EPS according to a number or requirements, including infrastructure, capital, number of users, functionality and covering.  The function of the EPS is to sell health service packages to the public, and contract such services with the healthcare-providing institution.

Some EPS providers offer a "Plan Complementario" that offers more expanded coverage and priority service to the patient.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iX-Z9swtTyA&lt;/ref&gt;

Most EPS providers also offer "Medicina Prepagada" that offers the highest level of medical attention and priority service to the patient at much higher costs.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qyw0qoWXCU&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health professionals and the healthcare system ==
As of October 1, 2014, there were '''3,620''' health establishments in [[Colombia]], including [[hospital]]s, [[clinic]]s and ambulance services.

The '''hedonic treadmill''', also known as '''hedonic adaptation''', is the observed tendency of [[human]]s to quickly return to a relatively stable level of [[happiness]] despite major positive or negative events or life changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
|last=  Rosenbloom| first=  Stephanie| url=  https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/08/business/08consume.html?pagewanted=all

According to this theory, as a person makes more money, expectations and desires rise in tandem, which results in no permanent gain in happiness. Brickman and Campbell coined the term in their essay "Hedonic Relativism and Planning the Good Society" (1971).&lt;ref name="Brickman1971"/&gt; During the late 1990s, the concept was modified by [[Michael Eysenck]], a British psychologist, to become the current "hedonic treadmill theory" which compares the [[pursuit of happiness]] to a person on a [[treadmill]], who has to keep walking just to stay in the same place.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} The concept dates back centuries, to such writers as [[St. Augustine]], cited in [[Robert Burton (scholar)|Robert Burton]]'s 1621 ''[[Anatomy of Melancholy]]'': "A true saying it is, ''Desire hath no rest'', is infinite in itself, endless, and as one calls it, a perpetual rack, or horse-mill."{{synthesis inline|date=May 2016}}

The '''hedonic''' (or '''happiness''') '''set point''' has gained interest throughout the field of [[positive psychology]] where it has been developed and revised further.&lt;ref name="Lykken1996"/&gt; Given that hedonic adaptation generally demonstrates that a person's long-term happiness is not significantly affected by otherwise impacting events, positive psychology has concerned itself with the discovery of things that can lead to lasting changes in happiness levels.
{{Hedonism}}

==Overview==
Hedonic adaptation is a process or mechanism that reduces the affective impact of emotional events. Generally, hedonic adaptation involves a happiness "set point", whereby humans generally maintain a constant level of happiness throughout their lives, despite events that occur in their environment.&lt;ref name="Brickman1971"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brickman |last2=Campbell|title=Hedonic relativism and planning the good society|date=1971|publisher=Academic Press|location=New York|pages=287–302}} in M.&amp;nbsp;H. Apley, ed., ''Adaptation Level Theory: A Symposium,'' New York: Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kuhn2011"/&gt; The process of hedonic adaptation is often conceptualized as a treadmill, since one must continually work to maintain a certain level of happiness. Others conceptualize hedonic adaptation as functioning similarly to a thermostat (a [[negative feedback]] system) that works to maintain an individual's happiness set point. One of the main concerns of positive psychology is determining how to maintain or raise one's happiness set point, and further, what kind of practices lead to lasting happiness.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Hedonic adaptation can occur in a variety of ways. Generally, the process involves cognitive changes, such as shifting values, goals, attention and interpretation of a situation.&lt;ref name="Frederick1999"/&gt; Further, neurochemical processes desensitize overstimulated hedonic pathways in the brain, which possibly prevents persistently high levels of intense positive or negative feelings.&lt;ref name="Solomon1974"/&gt; The process of adaptation can also occur through the tendency of humans to construct elaborate rationales for considering themselves deprived through a process social theorist [[Gregg Easterbrook]] calls "abundance denial".&lt;ref&gt;Easterbrook, Gregg.  ''The Progress Paradox: How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse'' (Random House, 2003). {{ISBN|0812973038}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major theoretical approaches==

===Behavioral/psychological approach===
The "Hedonic Treadmill" is a term coined by Brickman and Campbell in their article "Hedonic Relativism and Planning the Good Society" (1971), describing the tendency of people to keep a fairly stable baseline level of happiness despite external events and fluctuations in demographic circumstances.&lt;ref name="Brickman1971"/&gt; The idea of relative happiness had been around for decades when in 1978 Brickman et al. began to approach hedonic pleasure within the framework of Helson's adaptation level theory, which holds that perception of stimulation is dependent upon comparison of former stimulations.&lt;ref name="Brickman1978"/&gt; The hedonic treadmill functions similarly to most [[adaptation]]s that serve to protect and enhance perception. In the case of hedonics, the sensitization or desensitization to circumstances or environment can redirect motivation. This reorientation functions to protect against complacency, but also to accept unchangeable circumstances, and redirect efforts towards more effective goals. Frederick and Lowenstein classify three types of processes in hedonic adaptation: shifting adaptation levels, [[Desensitization (psychology)|desensitization]], and [[sensitization]]. Shifting adaptation levels occurs when a person experiences a shift in what is perceived as a "neutral" stimulus, but maintains sensitivity to stimulus differences. For example, if Sam gets a raise he will initially be happier, and then habituate to the larger salary and return to his happiness set point. But he will still be pleased when he gets a holiday bonus. Desensitization decreases sensitivity in general, which reduces sensitivity to change.  Those who have lived in war zones for extended periods of time may become desensitized to the destruction that happens on a daily basis, and be less affected by the occurrence of serious injuries or losses that may once have been shocking and upsetting. Sensitization is an increase of hedonic response from continuous exposure, such as the increased pleasure and selectivity of connoisseurs for wine, or food.&lt;ref name="Frederick1999"/&gt;

Brickman, Coates, and Janoff-Bulman were among the first to investigate the hedonic treadmill in their 1978 study, "Lottery Winners and Accident Victims: Is Happiness Relative?". Lottery winners and paraplegics were compared to a control group and as predicted, comparison (with past experiences and current communities) and [[habituation]] (to new circumstances) affected levels of happiness such that after the initial impact of the extremely positive or negative events, happiness levels typically went back to the average levels.&lt;ref name="Brickman1978"/&gt; This interview-based study, while not longitudinal, was the beginning of a now large body of work exploring the relativity of happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Best Walking Machine aka Treadmills on Amazon
|author=Mytoneonline|url= https://mytoneonline.com/best-walking-machine-amazon |accessdate=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brickman and Campbell originally implied that everyone returns to the same neutral set point after a significantly emotional life event.&lt;ref name="Brickman1971"/&gt; In the literature review, "Beyond the Hedonic Treadmill, Revising the Adaptation Theory of Well-Being" (2006), Diener, Lucas, and Scollon concluded that people are not hedonically neutral, and that individuals have different set points which are at least partially heritable. They also concluded that individuals may have more than one happiness set point, such as a [[life satisfaction]] set point and a [[Subjective well-being|subjective well being]] set point, and that because of this, one's level of happiness is not just one given set point but can vary within a given range. Diener and colleagues point to longitudinal and cross-sectional research to argue that happiness set point can change, and lastly that individuals vary in the rate and extent of adaptation they exhibit to change in circumstance.&lt;ref name="Diener2006"/&gt;

In a longitudinal study conducted by Mancini, Bonnano, and Clark, people showed individual differences in how they responded to significant life events, such as marriage, divorce and widowhood. They recognized that some individuals do experience substantial changes to their hedonic set point over time, though most others do not, and argue that happiness set point can be relatively stable throughout the course of an individual's life, but the life satisfaction and subjective well being set points are more variable.&lt;ref name="Mancini2011"/&gt;

Similarly, the longitudinal study conducted by Fujita and Diener (2005) described the life satisfaction set point as a "soft baseline". This means that for most people, this baseline is similar to their happiness baseline. Typically, life satisfaction will hover around a set point for the majority of their lives and not change dramatically. However, for about a quarter of the population this set point is not stable, and does indeed move in response to a major life event.&lt;ref name="Fujita2005"/&gt;
Other longitudinal data has shown that subjective well being set points do change over time, and that adaptation is not necessarily inevitable. In his archival data analysis, Lucas found evidence that it is possible for someone's subjective well-being set point to change drastically, such as in the case of individuals who acquire a severe, long term disability.&lt;ref name="Lucas2003"/&gt;  However, as Diener, Lucas, and Scollon point out, the amount of fluctuation a person experiences around their set point is largely dependent on the individual's ability to adapt.&lt;ref name="Diener2006"/&gt;

After following over a thousand sets of twins for 10 years, Lykken and Tellegen (1996) concluded that almost 50% of our happiness levels are determined by genetics.&lt;ref name="Lykken1996"/&gt; Headey and Wearing (1989) suggested that our position on the spectrum of the stable [[Trait theory|personality traits]] ([[Revised NEO Personality Inventory|neuroticism, extraversion, and openness]] to experience) accounts for how we experience and perceive life events, and indirectly contributes to our happiness levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Headey|first1=Bruce|last2=Wearing|first2=Alexander J.|title=Understanding Happiness: A Theory of Subjective Well-being|date=1992|publisher=Longman Cheshire|isbn=9780582875081|url=http://www1.eur.nl/fsw/happiness/hap_bib/freetexts/headey_b_1992.pdf|language=en|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160515202531/http://www1.eur.nl/fsw/happiness/hap_bib/freetexts/headey_b_1992.pdf|archivedate=2016-05-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research on happiness has spanned decades and crossed cultures in order to test the true limits of our hedonic set point.

==Major empirical findings==
In general there is conflicting evidence on the validity of the hedonic treadmill, if people always return to a baseline level of happiness or if some events have the ability to change this baseline for good. While some researchers believe life events change people's baseline for good over the course of one's life, others believe people will always return to their baseline.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

In recent large panel studies divorce, death of a spouse, unemployment, disability and similar events have been shown to change the long-term subjective well-being, even though some adaptation does occur and inborn factors affect this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-8721.2007.00479.x|title=Adaptation and the Set-Point Model of Subjective Well-Being. Does Happiness Change After Major Life Events?|author1=Richard E. Lucas|volume=16|issue=2|pages=75-79|date=April 1, 2007|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2007.00479.x|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aforementioned Brickman study (1978), researchers interviewed 22 lottery winners and 29 [[paraplegia|paraplegics]] to determine their change in happiness levels due to their given event (winning lottery or becoming paralyzed). The event in the case of lottery winners had taken place between one month and one and a half years before the study, and in the case of paraplegics between a month and a year. The group of lottery winners reported being similarly happy before and after the event, and expected to have a similar level of happiness in a couple of years. These findings show that having a large monetary gain had no effect on their baseline level of happiness, for both present and expected happiness in the future. They found that the paraplegics reported having a higher level of happiness in the past than the rest (due to a nostalgia effect), a lower level of happiness at the time of the study than the rest (although still above the middle point of the scale, that is, they reported being more happy than unhappy) and, surprisingly, they also expected to have similar levels of happiness than the rest in a couple of years. One must note that the paraplegics did have an initial decrease in life happiness, but the key to their findings is that they expected to eventually return to their baseline in time.&lt;ref name="Brickman1978"/&gt;

Some research suggests that hedonic setpoints can potentially be raised with new compounds like [[NSI-189]].&lt;ref&gt;http://investor.neuralstem.com/2013-04-22-FDA-Approves-Neuralstem-To-Treat-Final-Cohort-In-NSI-189-Phase-Ib-Trial-In-Major-Depressive-Disorder{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; This could potentially have critical implications for the treatment of dysthymia and depression. Other research suggests that resilience to suffering is partly due to a decreased fear response in the amygdala and increased levels of BDNF in the brain. New genetic research have found that changing a gene could increase intelligence and resilience to depressing and traumatizing events.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.futuretimeline.net/blog/2015/08/17-2.htm#.VuviaVnD9qU Cites: {{cite journal|last1=McGirr|first1=Alexander|last2=Lipina|first2=Tatiana V|last3=Mun|first3=Ho-Suk|last4=Georgiou|first4=John|last5=Al-Amri|first5=Ahmed H|last6=Ng|first6=Enoch|last7=Zhai|first7=Dongxu|last8=Elliott|first8=Christina|last9=Cameron|first9=Ryan T|last10=Mullins|first10=Jonathan GL|last11=Liu|first11=Fang|last12=Baillie|first12=George S|last13=Clapcote|first13=Steven J|last14=Roder|first14=John C|title=Specific Inhibition of Phosphodiesterase-4B Results in Anxiolysis and Facilitates Memory Acquisition|journal=Neuropsychopharmacology|date=2015|volume=41|issue=4|pages=1080–1092|doi=10.1038/npp.2015.240|pmid=26272049|pmc=4748432}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could have crucial benefits for those suffering from anxiety and [[PTSD]]. 
 
Recent research reveals certain types of brain training can increase brain size. The hippocampus volume can affect mood, hedonic setpoints, some forms of memory. A smaller hippocampus has been linked to depression and dysthymia.&lt;ref&gt;http://psychcentral.com/news/2015/07/06/recurrent-depression-linked-to-smaller-hippocampus/86512.html&lt;/ref&gt; Certain activities and environmental factors can reset the hedonic setpoint and also grow the hippocampus to an extent. London taxi drivers' hippocampi grow on the job, and the drivers have a better memory than those who didn't become taxi drivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/677048.stm|date = 14 March 2000|work = BBC NEWS |title = Taxi drivers' brains 'grow' on the job}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the posterior hippocampus seemed to be the most important for enhanced mood and memory.

Lucas, Clark, Georgellis, and Diener (2003) researched changes in baseline level of [[well-being]] due to marital status, birth of first child, and layoff. While they found that a negative life event can have a greater impact on a person's psychological state and happiness set point than a positive event, they concluded that people completely adapt, finally returning to their baseline level of well-being, after divorce, losing a spouse, the birth of a child, and for women losing their job. They did not find a return to baseline for marriage or for layoffs in men. This study also illustrated that the amount of adaptation depends on the individual.&lt;ref name="Lucas2003"/&gt;

Wildeman, Turney, and Schnittker (2014) studied the effects of [[imprisonment]] on one's baseline level of well-being. They researched how being in jail affects one's level of happiness both short term (while in prison) and long term (after being released). They found that being in prison has negative effects on one's baseline well-being; in other words one's baseline of happiness is lower in prison than when not in prison. Once people were released from prison, they were able to bounce back to their previous level of happiness.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Wildeman, Kristin Turney, and Jason Schnittker, [http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/jclc/vol104/iss1/4 "The Hedonic Consequences of Punishment Revisited"], 103 J. Crim. L. &amp; Criminology 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

Silver (1982) researched the effects of a traumatic accident on one's baseline level of happiness. Silver found that accident victims were able to return to a happiness set point after a period of time. For eight weeks, Silver followed accident victims who had sustained severe [[spinal cord injuries]]. About a week after their accident, Silver observed that the victims were experiencing much stronger negative emotions than positive ones. By the eighth and final week, the victims' positive emotions outweighed their negative ones. The results of this study suggest that regardless of whether the life event is significantly negative or positive, people will almost always return to their happiness baseline.&lt;ref&gt;Silver (1982).

Fujita and Diener (2005) studied the stability of one's level of subjective well-being over time and found that for most people, there is a relatively small range in which their level of satisfaction varies. They asked a panel of 3,608 German residents to rate their current and overall satisfaction with life on a scale of 0-10, once a year for seventeen years. Only 25% of participants exhibited shifts in their level of life satisfaction over the course of the study, with just 9% of participants having experienced significant changes. They also found that those with a higher mean level of life satisfaction had more stable levels of life satisfaction than those with lower levels of satisfaction.&lt;ref name="Fujita2005"/&gt;

==Applications==

===Happiness set point===
The concept of the happiness set point (proposed by [[Sonja Lyubomirsky]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/21/fashion/happiness-inc.html | title = Happiness Inc.|work = The New York Times|date= 19 April 2013|last = Weil|first = Elizabeth}}&lt;/ref&gt;) can be applied in clinical psychology to help patients return to their hedonic set point when negative events happen. Determining when someone is mentally distant from their happiness set point and what events trigger those changes can be extremely helpful in treating conditions such as depression. When a change occurs, clinical psychologists work with patients to recover from the depressive spell and return to their hedonic set point more quickly. Because acts of kindness often promote long-term well-being, one treatment method is to provide patients with different altruistic activities that can help a person raise his or her hedonic set point.&lt;ref name="Sheldon2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Elias|first1=Marilyn|title=Psychologists now know what makes people happy|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/health/2002-12-08-happy-main_x.htm|work=USA Today|date=December 8, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can in turn be helpful in reducing reckless habits in the pursuit of well-being.&lt;ref name=Mathews&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vacounseling.com/hedonic-treadmill/ |title=The Hedonic Treadmill: From Overconsumption to Minimalism |last=Mathews |first=John |publisher=Virginia Counseling |date=2015 |website=Virginia Counseling}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, helping patients understand that long-term happiness is relatively stable throughout one's life can help to ease anxiety surrounding impactful events.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

===Resilience research===
Hedonic adaptation is also relevant to resilience research. Resilience is a "class of phenomena characterized by patterns of positive adaptation in the context of significant adversity or risk," meaning that resilience is largely the ability for one to remain at their hedonic setpoint while going through negative experiences. Psychologists have identified various factors that contribute to a person being resilient, such as positive attachment relationships (see [[Attachment Theory]]), positive self-perceptions, self-regulatory skills (see [[Emotional self-regulation]]), ties to prosocial organizations (see [[prosocial behavior]]), and a positive outlook on life.&lt;ref&gt;Masten, A. S., Cutuli, J. J., Herbers, J. E., &amp; Reed, M.-G. J. (2009). Resilience in development. In C. R. Snyder &amp; S. J. Lopez (Eds.), Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology, 2nd ed. (pp. 117–131). New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; These factors can contribute to maintaining a happiness set point even in the face of adversity or negative events.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

==Critical views==
One critical point made regarding our individual set point is to understand it may simply be a genetic tendency and not a completely determined criterion for happiness, and it can still be influenced.&lt;ref name="Lykken1996"/&gt; In a study on moderate to excessive drug intake on rats, Ahmed and Koob (1998), sought to demonstrate that the use of [[mind-altering drugs]] such as [[cocaine]] could change an individual's hedonic set point. Their findings suggest that drug usage and addiction lead to neurochemical adaptations whereby a person needs more of that substance to feel the same levels of pleasure. Thus, drug abuse can have lasting impacts on one's hedonic set point, both in terms of overall happiness and with regard to pleasure felt from drug usage.&lt;ref name="Ahmed1998"/&gt;

Genetic roots of the hedonic set point are also disputed. Sosis (2014) has argued the "hedonic treadmill" interpretation of twin studies depends on dubious assumptions. Pairs of identical twins raised apart aren't necessarily raised in substantially different environments. The similarities between twins (such as intelligence or beauty) may invoke similar reactions from the environment. Thus, we might see a notable similarity in happiness levels between twins even though there aren't happiness genes governing affect levels.&lt;ref name="Sosis2014"/&gt;

Further, hedonic adaptation may be a more common phenomenon when dealing with positive events as opposed to negative ones. [[Negativity bias]], where people tend to focus more on negative emotions than positive emotions, can be an obstacle in raising one's happiness set point. Negative emotions often require more attention and are generally remembered better, overshadowing any positive experiences that may even outnumber negative experiences.&lt;ref name="Lykken1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Baumeister2001"/&gt; Given that negative events hold more psychological power than positive ones, it may be difficult to create lasting positive change.

Headey (2008) concluded that an internal [[locus of control]] and having "positive" personality traits (notably low [[neuroticism]]) are the two most significant factors affecting one's subjective well-being. Headey also found that adopting "non-zero sum" goals, those which enrich one's relationships with others and with society as a whole (i.e. family-oriented and altruistic goals), increase the level of subjective well-being. Conversely, attaching importance to zero-sum life goals (career success, wealth, and social status) will have a small but nevertheless statistically significant negative impact on people's overall subjective well-being (even though the size of a household's [[disposable income]] does have a small, positive impact on subjective well-being). Duration of one's education seems to have no direct bearing on life satisfaction. And, contradicting set point theory, Headey found no return to homeostasis after sustaining a disability or developing a chronic illness. These disabling events are permanent, and thus according to [[cognitive model]] of [[Depression (mood)|depression]], may contribute to depressive thoughts and increase neuroticism (another factor found by Headey to diminish subjective well-being). Disability appears to be the single most important factor affecting human subjective well-being. The impact of disability on subjective well-being is almost twice as large as that of the second strongest factor affecting life satisfaction—the personality trait of [[neuroticism]].&lt;ref name="Headey2008"/&gt;

'''Henry Harrington Janeway''' (19 March 1873 – 1 February 1921) was an American [[physician]] and pioneer of [[History of radiation therapy|radiation therapy]].

== Life ==
Janeway was born in [[New Brunswick, New Jersey]], on 19 March 19th 1873, and died at his home in [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale-on-Hudson]], [[New York (state)|New York]] on 1 February 1921. Janeway was the son of LTC Jacob Jones Janeway (1840 - 1926), a successful New Jersey wallpaper manufacturer and philanthropist, and  Eliza A Harrington Janeway (1843 - 1925). He married Elizabeth Ayers Buckley and they had five children. Elizabeth was the daughter of Dr. [[Lucius Duncan Buckley]] and Katherine La Rue Mellick.{{fact|date=December 2016}}

He was educated in the [[Rutgers Preparatory School]] and graduated from [[Rutgers College]] in 1889 followed by post-graduate courses at [[Sheffield Scientific School]], [[Yale University]] under Professor [[Russell Henry Chittenden]].{{fact|date=December 2016}} Then followed four years in the College of Physicians and Surgeons, [[Columbia University]], after which (1898) he entered Roosevelt Hospital in the surgical division under [[Charles McBurney (surgeon)|Charles McBurney]].{{fact|date=December 2016}} He studied in the clinics of Roosevelt, Skin and Cancer and Lying-in Hospitals.{{fact|date=December 2016}} His first five years were given to general practice in [[New Brunswick, New Jersey]].{{fact|date=December 2016}}

In 1907 he became associated with his father-in-law, Dr. Bulkley, in his dermatological practice. He remained with him for two years, and during that time made investigations in skin and cancer pathology and wrote articles upon this subject.{{fact|date=December 2016}}

In 1909 he was appointed chief of the Laboratory for Experimental Research of Physicians and Surgeons. He did work in blood-pressure, shock and in surgery of the oesophagus and stomach.{{fact|date=December 2016}} In 1914 he was appointed Attending Surgeon and Chief of the Radium Department at Memorial Hospital, New York City, where he developed and advanced the use of radium as a therapeutic agent.{{fact|date=December 2016}}

Janeway's work with radium in uterine cancer was most notable. He was the first man in this country to advocate radium as the agent of choice in cervical carcinoma; the technique of burying radium emanation in the cervix was original with him and, in fact, all his work with radium emanation needles was primarily original.{{fact|date=December 2016}}

His work on conservative surgery plus radium was early recognized.{{fact|date=December 2016}} Various procedures, such as the use of dental-modeling compound for improving technique in applying radium, originated in his clinic.&lt;ref name = "Radium"&gt;This section is sourced from ''Radium'' (March 1921).

==Publications==
Janeway's clinical and experimental observations were published in medical journals of his time. His report on ''Radium Therapy in Cancer, at the Memorial Hospital (1915-1916)'', which appeared in book form in 1917 was the most comprehensive work of its type published in the United States.{{fact|date=December 2016}} Its first chapter, "Physical Considerations Relative to the Application of Radium", was written by [[Gioacchino Failla]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Janeway, M.D.|first1=Henry Harrington|url=https://archive.org/details/radiumtherapyin00janegoog|title=Radium Therapy in Cancer at the Memorial Hospital New York|date=August 1917|publisher=Paul B.

== The Janeway Medal and Lectures==
[[File:JanewayMedal-front.jpeg|thumbnail|left|Janeway Medal (front)]]
In 1933, the [[American Radium Society]] founded the annual Janeway Lecture in his honor. The lecturers are chosen for their "outstanding scientific contributions" with the lecture taking place at the society's annual general meeting.  The first Janeway Lecture, "Early Experience in Radium Therapy" was given by the pathologist [[James Ewing (pathologist)|James Ewing]]. Since 1937 each Janeway Lecturer is also presented with the Janeway Medal, originally struck in bronze but in 1971 changed to gold.&lt;ref&gt;[[American Radium Society]]. [https://web.archive.org/web/20130427093840/http://www.americanradiumsociety.org/past-meetings/janeway-lectures/ Janeway Lectures]&lt;/ref&gt; The medal was designed by Edward H. Skinner, the American Radium Society's president-elect at the time, and Stephanie Prince, a young artist from Kansas City, Missouri. The design is based on Norse mythology and depicts [[Odin]] standing before the giant [[Mimir]] seeking to drink from the well of knowledge. The obverse depicts the ravens [[Huginn and Muninn|Hugin]] (Reflection) and [[Huginn and Muninn|Munin]] (Remembrance) which became the symbol of the American Radium Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Del Rogato|first1=J.A.|url=http://www.ajronline.org/doi/pdf/10.2214/ajr.108.2.429|title=The Janeway Medal and Its Allegory|journal=American Journal of Roentgenology, Radium Therapy and Nuclear Medicine|date=1970|volume=108|pages=429–430|doi=10.2214/ajr.108.2.429}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16607">The '''Himalayan Cataract Project''' (HCP) was created in 1994 by Dr. Geoffrey Tabin and Dr. [[Sanduk Ruit]] with a goal of establishing a sustainable [[eye care]] infrastructure in the [[Himalaya]]. HCP empowers local doctors to provide ophthalmic care through skills-transfer and education. From its beginning, HCP responds to a pressing need for eye care in the Himalayan region. With programs in [[Nepal]], [[Tibet]], [[China]], [[Bhutan]], [[India]], [[Sikkim]], and [[Pakistan]] they have been able to restore sight to tens of thousands of blind people every year since 1994.&lt;ref name="outdoorutah1"&gt;[http://www.outdoorutah.com/adventurejournal/index.php/dr-geoffrey-tabin-giving-eyesight-to-the-blind ]{{dead link|date=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, HCP's assistance has been requested for a pilot study on eye care services in twelve Millennium Research Villages in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. The Millennium Villages Project was established in part to prove that successful implementation of the [[UN]] [[Millennium Development Goals]] is possible in the poorest, most underserved areas of the developing world. HCP has agreed to provide comprehensive eye care in each of the Villages (5,000 per village) and to demonstrate that the costs of these services will fit within the complex U.N. Health Budget for the Millennium Villages Project. So far, interventions have taken place in [[Uganda]], [[Ethiopia]], and [[Ghana]] with effective delivery of interventions such as cataract surgeries, refraction and distribution of glasses.

== Background ==
According to [[World Health Organization|WHO]] estimates, the most common causes of blindness around the world in 2002 were:
# [[cataract]]s (47.9%),
# [[glaucoma]] (12.3%),
# age-related [[macular degeneration]] (8.7%),
# [[cornea]]l opacity (5.1%), and
# [[diabetic retinopathy]] (4.8%),
# [[childhood blindness]] (3.9%),
# [[trachoma]] (3.6%)
# [[onchocerciasis]] (0.8%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/blindness/causes/en/|title=Causes of blindness and visual impairment|publisher=[[World Health Organization]]|accessdate=19 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suffering from blindness affects not only the blind person but also members of his/her family. Where there are few paved roads and where terrain is rugged and mountainous, a blind person has incredible difficulty moving around and depends on a caretaker. There are no social services available to the blind, and individuals who are blind cannot contribute to family income. A blind person, unable to care for themselves in such a harsh environment requires a help of a family member, which essentially takes two people out of being able to contribute to family income, or community life. With sight restored, many patients would be able to return to work and to traditional roles in their families and societies.

== Objectives ==
* teach ophthalmic care at all levels
* establish a first-rate eye care infrastructure through creating centers of excellence and mentoring facilities
* making all facilities financially self-sustaining
* addressing eye care from the public health level up to subspecialty care

In 1993, there were 15,000 cataract surgeries performed in Nepal,{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} only 1000 of which utilized intraocular lenses. Most of these 1000 modern surgeries were performed by HCP's Co-Director, Dr. Sanduk Ruit, who brought microsurgery with intraocular lens technology to the region. Before this technology, cataract surgery consisted of intracapsular cataract extraction, in which the entire lens and capsule are removed from the eye and the patient is given cumbersome thick eyeglasses that provide no peripheral vision and distorted direct vision. At that time, the second and third leading etiologies of blindness after cataracts were aphakia due to the loss of these thick glasses, and failed cataract surgery.

In contrast, in 2003, over 118,000 cataract surgeries were performed in Nepal{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} and over 98 percent were done with microsurgery and lens implants. Nepal is the only country in the Himalayan region performing more cataract surgery than the annual rate of new cataract blindness.

==Skills-Transfer Program==
The Himalayan Cataract Project has trained well over thirty surgeons to perform modern sight-restoring cataract surgery through a unique skills-transfer program. HCP utilizes a team approach, where a doctor, a nurse, and an ophthalmic assistant trains for 4–8 weeks at Tilganga. The surgeon takes an intensive microsurgical course, gaining dexterity under the microscope, while the team develops into a finely-tuned unit. The team then returns to its remote clinic, where it prescreens several hundred patients who are blind from cataracts. The HCP teaching surgeons follow and set up a high-volume skills-transfer cataract camp. The teaching surgeons operate on the first eye of each patient, while the training surgeon assists. Then the training surgeon operates on the second eye of each patient while the HCP surgeon assists. In the course of a typical skills-transfer eye camp, more than five hundred blind people will have their sight restored and each local team and surgeon will perform over 100 cataract surgeries. This is more surgeries than an American ophthalmology resident usually does in a three-year residency program. At the conclusion of the session, the Himalayan Cataract Project donates the operating microscope, surgical instruments, intraocular lenses, and consumables needed to perform an additional 500 surgeries. The HCP then follows up with additional training at the local surgeon’s hospital every year for the next three years. Several of the surgeons we have trained are now performing more than 1000 sight-restoring cataract surgeries per year, and have gone on to train other ophthalmologists. The cost of a skills-transfer program, including all equipment and supplies, is usually around US$25,000.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

==High-volume Remote [[Cataract surgery|Cataract Surgery]] Camps==
The Himalayan Cataract Project travels into remote areas where medicine has not yet reached, extending eye care to those who perhaps need it most. In these remote villages where the population is too small to warrant training a doctor, the HCP performs high-volume cataract surgery camps. These camps differ from skills-transfer camps in that the focus is not to train physicians, but to provide eye care to as many people as possible. The goal of these camps is to move patients from total blindness before surgery to having good ambulatory vision on the following day after their eye-patch is removed. Complete vision is typically recovered within one month.

The cost of one sight restoring surgery, including the intraocular lenses, is $12 US, the most cost-effective intervention in all of medicine. The Himalayan Cataract Project teams are able to run remote eye camps for an average of $4,000 USD . Donors such John and Cecily Leach, who donated the HCP cataract camp bus provide a mobile clinic that gets medical teams to remote locations. Since 1994, Tilganga eye camps have examined nearly 150,000 patients and performed 25,000 eye camp cataract surgeries.

These programs also reach to Tibet, China, Bhutan, Sikkim, India, West Bengal, and Pakistan and are also rapidly improving eye care by establishing a sustainable eye care infrastructure. Through performing remote cataract camps, HCP has directly restored sight to tens of thousands of blind people in those regions. But the project’s impact goes much further because the HCP’s focus has been on training indigenous surgeons to perform modern cataract surgery.

==Cost-Recovery==
All of the Himalayan Cataract Project’s facilities strive to be completely financially self-sustaining through a unique cost-recovery program in which the wealthy patients subsidize the poor patients.

One third of the patients pay the full US$100 for a complete work-up, modern cataract surgery, and all post-operative care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/09/0926_030926_cataract_2.html |title=In Nepal, Doctors Cure Blindness Among Poor |publisher=National Geographic |date=2003-09-26 |accessdate=2014-07-24 |last=Handwerk |first=Brian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty percent of the patients pay a smaller amount based on what they are able to pay. The remaining third of the patients receive the cataract surgical care entirely free. With this model, the facilities are able to cover all costs.

==Tilganga Institute of Ophthalmology==
[[Tilganga Institute of Ophthalmology]] (TIOC) is the flagship of the Nepal Eye Program and the current facility was opened in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tilganga.org/index.php |title=Tilganga Institute of Ophthalmology |publisher=Tilganga.org |date=2011-09-18 |accessdate=2014-07-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226002000/http://www.tilganga.org/index.php |archivedate=26 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/8.30/helthrpt/hstories/hr061102.htm |accessdate=7 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070624113826/http://www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/8.30/helthrpt/hstories/hr061102.htm |archivedate=24 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a non profit, community based, non-government organization that is committed to providing eye care services and implementing the Vision 2020 concept of elimination of avoidable blindness. TEC's goal is to act as a model for treatment, research and training, in cooperation with all other eye care centres and organizations in Nepal.

==Dr. Sanduk Ruit==
Dr. [[Sanduk Ruit]] grew up in a remote village in Eastern Nepal. He attended school in India and completed his three-year ophthalmology residency at the prestigious All India Institute of Medical Sciences in Delhi, India. He also completed fellowships in microsurgery in the Netherlands and Australia as well as additional ophthalmic training at the Wilmer Eye Institute of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and the University of Michigan. In 1986 Dr. Ruit met Professor Fred Hollows from Sydney, Australia while Hollows visited Nepal as a World Health Organization consultant. He went on to study with him for 14 months at Sydney’s Prince of Wales Hospital. Hollows was Ruit’s mentor and inspiration in the work that he does. The two men believed in the right of people with treatable blindness to have their sight restored, and that people in developing countries deserved access to the same quality of care and technology as those in the Developed World. They shared an ambitious vision: the elimination of avoidable blindness in the Himalayan region, a process they believed needed to be driven by local people.

When Dr. Ruit returned to Nepal he was instrumental in the formation of the '''Nepal Eye Program''' and worked on a large epidemiological survey of blindness in Nepal. He was the first Nepali doctor to perform cataract surgery with intraocular lens implants and pioneered the use of microsurgical extra-capsular cataract extraction with posterior chamber lens implants in remote eye camps. Although other important international organizations sponsored eye camps in the region providing eye care and training local ophthalmologists, the camps established by Dr. Ruit were the first to introduce the use of intraocular lenses in cataract surgery. Put simply, this is the removal of the cataract and insertion of a plastic intraocular lens.&lt;ref name="outdoorutah1"/&gt;

==Dr. Geoffrey Tabin==
Dr. Geoffrey Tabin is Professor of Ophthalmology &amp; Visual Sciences and Director of the Division of International Ophthalmology at the John A Moran Eye Center at the University of Utah.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://keck.usc.edu/en/Students/Calendars/Events_Calendar/Detail/_/2011__spring__mountaineering_and_medicine_4-26-11 |title="Leadership Lessons From the Top of the World" A Lecture and Reception Featuring Mountaineers Conrad Anker and Dr. Geoff Tabin |publisher=Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California |date=2010-09-22 |accessdate=2014-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from Yale University and earned a Masters in Philosophy at Oxford on a Marshall Scholarship. He received his MD from Harvard Medical School in 1985. His background in philosophy and ideas of improving health care delivery came together after a climbing trip to Nepal on which he became the first ophthalmologist to summit Mt. Everest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/09/0926_030926_cataract.html |title=In Nepal, Doctors Cure Blindness Among Poor |publisher=National Geographic |date=2003-09-26 |accessdate=2014-07-24 |last=Handwerk |first=Brian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Tabin and Dr. Ruit vowed to add their own efforts to those of other existing eye care programs, with a goal of overcoming treatable and preventable blindness in the Himalayan region in their lifetime. Dr. Ruit established the Tilganga Eye Centre in 1994 as the first outpatient cataract surgery facility in the Himalayan region. In 1995 Dr. Ruit and Dr. Tabin formally began the '''Himalayan Cataract Project''' as a charitable foundation to support their work. From the start, the projects of the Tilganga Eye Centre have been a central focus of the Himalayan Cataract Project.

Dr. Tabin spends at least three months per year in Asia working with his Nepalese counterparts directing '''Tilganga Eye Centre'''’s efforts to provide an international standard of eye care and participating in the outreach programs. As the director of the Himalayan Cataract Project, he has over ten years experience administering an international charitable organization. He is a leader in both the local ophthalmologic community and the American Academy of Ophthalmology. Dr. Tabin is also the distinguished recipient of the 2008 Outstanding Humanitarian Service Award &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aao.org/newsroom/release/20081109c.cfm |accessdate=7 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110212221856/http://www.aao.org/newsroom/release/20081109c.cfm |archivedate=12 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; given by the [[American Academy of Ophthalmology]] in recognition of his international humanitarian efforts.

The '''jebena''' ({{lang-am|ጀበና}} ǧäbäna), is a container used to brew [[coffee]] in the [[Ethiopia]]n and [[Eritrea]]n traditional [[coffee ceremony]].

==Overview==
[[File:Jebena in Asmara, Eritrea.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Jebena with various colorful designs for sale in [[Asmara]], Eritrea]]
[[File:Coffee_pot_at_eritrean_restaurant.jpg|thumb|left|150px|An Eritrean jebena]]
The jebena is usually made of clay and has a neck and pouring spout, and a handle where the neck connects with the base. The jebenas used in Ethiopia commonly have a spout, whereas those utilized in Eritrea usually do not.{{cn|date=August 2015}}

Typically, when the coffee boils up through the jebena's neck, it is poured in and out of another container to cool it. The liquid is then poured back into the jebena until it bubbles up. To pour the coffee from the jebena a filter made from horsehair or other material is placed in the spout of the jebena to prevent the grounds from escaping. In Ethiopia, a small pottery cup called a ''sini'' or ''finjal'' is used to contain the coffee poured from the jebena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethiopianrestaurant.com/ethiopian_coffee.html |title=Ethiopian Coffee Ceremony: Jebena and Cini |website=ethiopianrestaurant.com |publisher= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140208053239/http://www.ethiopianrestaurant.com/ethiopian_coffee.html |archive-date=February 8, 2014 |access-date=February 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ethiopia they use a slightly different variation, theirs having a separate spout lower on the pot for pouring out the coffee.
In Eritrea the jebena has only one spout at the top where they pour in the water and grinds and pour out the coffee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-cultures-eritrea-and-ethiopia/|title=Coffee Cultures: Eritrea and Ethiopia - I Need Coffee|date=2015-04-29|work=I Need Coffee|access-date=2018-04-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Economics of Quality in Health Care==
Michael Kobernick Jillian Shank  Jefferson Medical College

As a result of years of research with the RAND Corporation and Harvard University, Joseph Newhouse has become extremely passionate about the instability of our nation's health care system.  In his 2002 article,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=12117124 |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.21.4.13| volume=21 | title=Why is there a quality chasm? | year=2002 | journal=Health Aff (Millwood) | pages=13–25 | last1 = Newhouse | first1 = JP}}&lt;/ref&gt; he describes the healthcare systems of the United States as “obtaining less value from the resources it uses than other industries”.  Prior to proceeding with an explanation of Newhouse’s issues that lead to poor performance, it is important to understand the definitions of quality from the Institute of Medicine (IOM) and in economic terms.  The IOM defines quality as the gap between the actual and potential performance of the US Healthcare system.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

In economic terms, Alan M. Garber and Jonathan Skinner have explored the principles of productive and allocative inefficiency.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal | last1 = Garber | first1 = A.M. | last2 = Skinner | first2 = J. | year = 2008 | title = Is American healthcare uniquely inefficient? | url = http://www.montana.edu/cstoddard/320/garber_skinner.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Economic Perspectives | volume = 2 | issue = 4| pages = 27–50 | doi=10.1257/jep.22.4.27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Productive efficiency refers to the impact of inputs like “physicians, nurses, hospital beds, and capital” on American health care and the authors ask if the impact is greater in other countries (more efficient).  Allocative efficiency refers to the benefits from the “marginal dollar spent on health care” and asks the question do the benefits realized “exceed the opportunity cost of other goods” not purchased like raising salaries, a new car, or better education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Antos | first1 = J. | last2 = Bertko | first2 = J. | last3 = Chernew | first3 = M. | last4 = Cutler | first4 = D. | last5 = Goldman | first5 = D. | last6 = Kocher | first6 = B. | last7 = McClellan | first7 = M. | last8 = McGlynn | first8 = E. | last9 = Pauly | first9 = M. | last10 = Shortell | first10 = S. | year = 2010 | title = Bending the curve through health reform implementation | url = | journal = American Journal of Managed Care | volume = 16 | issue = 11| pages = 804–12 | pmid = 21348552 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The authors found that “nearly all countries fall short of ideal in productive efficiency” and the United States system lags behind (is less efficient) other countries most of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Garber | first1 = A. | last2 = Skinner | first2 = J. | year = | title = Is American Healthcare Uniquely Inefficient | url = https://www.dartmouth.edu/~jskinner/documents/garber_skinner_jep_2008.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Economic Perspectives | volume = 22 | issue = 4| pages = 27–50 | doi=10.1257/jep.22.4.27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They found that the U.S. has a high degree of allocative inefficiency, when compared with other high-income countries.  The causes are “high prices for inputs, poorly restrained incentives for overutilization, and a tendency to adopt expensive medical innovations rapidly, even when evidence of effectiveness is weak or absent”.&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Medicine. (2001). Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the Twenty-first Century.  Washington: National Academy Press. Retrieved February 13, 2014 from {{cite web|url=http://www.iom.edu/~/media/Files/Report%20Files/2001/Crossing-the-Quality-Chasm/Quality%20Chasm%202001%20%20report%20brief.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221001955/http://iom.edu/~/media/Files/Report%20Files/2001/Crossing-the-Quality-Chasm/Quality%20Chasm%202001%20%20report%20brief.pdf |archivedate=2015-02-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Combining the quality definition by the IOM and economic terms, Newhouse suggests the reasons for poor this performance stem from the following: consumer ignorance, technological change, administered prices, the difficulty in assessing the performance of a given provider, and the role of the private sector.  Consumer ignorance is associated with the inability to evaluate if the care provided is correct care and deferral of agency to the physician. The consumer is unable to assure high performance.  In focusing on technology, Newhouse indicates that each health care system must keep up with new devices, medicine, and even abide by nationwide use of the EMR to make the most informed decisions for each individual.  This rapid pace of change is often difficult to keep up with, resulting in poor quality.  Administered prices are determined between the insurer and provider leading to the input cost adapting to the payment, not necessarily the needs of the patient or quality of care.  Newhouse thinks a fixed price for goods and services might assure quality, as opposed to the DRG in which the hospital makes the most money by providing the minimum service.  Measuring performance is difficult as many outcomes are subjective; without accurate measurement the ability to assess the provider is limited.  Finally, Newhouse cites public sector policy, such as, creating barriers to entry into health care professions or using public funding for services result in politically based decisions often not in the best interest of overall quality.

Newhouse’s endeavors successfully delineate the reasons for the quality chasm.  He has a few suggestions:  greater use of technology to provide better information to the physician during decision making, use of computer decision support systems, better health services research, and better financial incentive design and research.

Other researchers and health care planners have attempted ways of crossing the quality chasm by improving the organization of health care for individuals.  Organizational improvements include the primary care medical home, accountable care organizations,  and allowing consumers to share in the savings of health payments after selecting coverage that leads to lower costs and higher quality . Some think increasing government regulation may result in improved access to care, reducing social disparities, training of more primary care providers, and enhancing the verification of provider competence in new technologies.  As projected by Newhouse, programs to validate the provision of evidence-based care will enhance the safety of health care, as well as, medication reconciliation, check lists in the operating rooms, and care transition management.&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Medicine. (2014). Crossing the Quality Chasm: The IOM Health Care Quality  Initiative.  Washington: National Academy Press. Retrieved February 13, 2014 from {{cite web|url=http://www.iom.edu/Global/News%20Announcements/Crossing-the-Quality-Chasm-The-IOM-Health-Care-Quality-Initiative.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928012943/http://www.iom.edu/Global/News%20Announcements/Crossing-the-Quality-Chasm-The-IOM-Health-Care-Quality-Initiative.aspx |archivedate=2011-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional programs to address Newhouse’s problems include payment reform in Medicare to restructure programs, offering a wider range of services, and moving from fee for service to fee for value, which then may result in enhanced engagement of the consumer.5 Increasing the roles and responsibilities of the independent payment advisory board may assist in payment reform as well,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Newhouse | first1 = J | year = 2002 | title = Why is there a Quality Chasm? | url = | journal = Health Affairs | volume = 21 | issue = 4| pages = 13–23 | doi=10.1377/hlthaff.21.4.13|pmid=12117124}}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to utilizing an electronic medical record to develop reporting systems that may be used for physician and patient evaluation and care gap closure.  Increased competition amongst health plans through an insurance exchange may lead to better quality and pricing.  Newhouse does an excellent job of describing the problems surrounding the quality chasm and suggesting many interventions to try and cross it.

'''Kaptai Lake''' is the largest man made lake in [[Bangladesh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Kaptai_Lake|title=Kaptai Lake - Banglapedia|website=en.banglapedia.org|access-date=2016-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located in the [[Kaptai Upazila]] under [[Rangamati District]] of [[Chittagong Division]]. The lake was created as a result of building the [[Kaptai Dam]] on the [[Karnaphuli River]], as part of the Karnaphuli [[Hydro-electric]] project. The Kaptai Lake's average depth is {{convert|100|ft|m}} and maximum depth is {{convert|490|ft|m}}.

==History==
Construction of the reservoir for the hydro-electric plant began in 1956 by the Government of [[East Pakistan]].&lt;ref name="Jaijaidin"&gt;Daily JaiJaiDin, January 10, 2008. Page 10.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, {{convert|54000|acre|km2}} of farmland in the [[Rangamati District]] went under water and created the lake.
The hydro-electric project was funded by the United States. The project was finished in 1962.
International Engineering Company and Utah International Inc. received the contract for construction of the dam. The dam is 670.8 meters long, and 54.7 meters high. The dam has a {{convert|745|ft|m}} long spillway containing 16 gates. Through the spillway {{convert|5250000|cuft/s|m3/s|abbr=on}} of water can pass.
[[File:A family visit at Kaptai Lake.jpg|thumb|A family visit at  Kaptai Lake]]
The land that went under water as a result of the dam construction, was 40% of the total arable land in the area. Along with that, {{convert|29|sqmi|km2}} of the Government-owned forest, and {{convert|234|sqmi|km2}} of other forest land went under water. About 18,000 families with a total of almost 100 thousand people were also displaced. The palace of the king of the [[Chakma people|Chakmas]] was also flooded and is now under water.&lt;ref name="Jaijaidin" /&gt;

==Ecological disaster==
The ecological damage of the lake recently assessed shows that water pollution due to the use of fertilisers and pesticides around the lake is affecting life in the water. In 1966, the share of big fishes in the total fish production was 78%, by 1993 it had come down to 2%. Also, more than five tons of human excrements and other wastes are reported to flow into the lake every day. As 85% of the population living around the lake depends on the water for drinking, cooking, washing and bathing, health risks have increased sharply.

'''Live Well Network''' is a home, health and lifestyle [[high definition television|high definition]] [[digital subchannel]] network owned by [[ABC Owned Television Stations]], part of the [[Disney–ABC Television Group]], a subsidiary of [[The Walt Disney Company]]. The network launched as '''Live Well HD Network''' on April 27, 2009, and is available on [[digital subchannel]]s of all [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]][[owned and operated station|-owned-and-operated station]]s.

The channel aired home, health and lifestyle programming and was similar to [[Ion Life]], which launched in 2007, with [[American Public Television]]'s [[Create (TV network)|Create]] serving as its main competitor. The network ended most national distribution on April 15, 2015, with [[Media General]] being the last to remove the network on their stations on May 29. Live Well Network continues to air in HD on the second subchannel of the seven ABC-owned television stations (WLS in Chicago airs it in standard definition).&lt;ref name="lwn-variety"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/abc-sticks-with-live-well-digital-channel-adds-comedy-net-1201408301|title=ABC Sticks with Live Well Digital Channel, Adds Comedy Net|last=Littleton|first=Cynthia|date=January 18, 2015|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=April 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it will not produce any new episodes of Live Well programming.&lt;ref name=laff&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/currency/exclusive-comedy-multicast-net-launching-abc-scripps/137199|title=Exclusive: Comedy Multicast Net Launching on ABC, Scripps|last=Lafayette|first=Jon|work=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|date=January 18, 2015|accessdate=January 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
ABC Owned Television Stations (ABCOTS) began development of a potential subchannel network in 2007. To appeal to non-ABC affiliates, it was decided not to use ABC branding in any way.&lt;ref name=adwk&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bachman|first1=Katy|title=ABC Multicasts Live Well HD Channel|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/television/abc-multicasts-live-well-hd-channel-113613|accessdate=December 4, 2014|work=Ad Week|date=October 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Live Well Network was launched on April 27, 2009 in high definition on ABC's owned-and-operated stations as part of the stations' subchannels.&lt;ref name=bc1&gt;[http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/209986-ABC_O_Os_Launch_Digital_Network.php ABC O&amp;Os Launch Digital Network], ''Broadcasting &amp; Cable'', April 27, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediaweek.com/mw/content_display/news/local-broadcast/e3i18f9fdff77fbe360c575973113dc907b ABC Multicasts Live Well HD Channel], ''Mediaweek'', October 25, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wls&gt;{{cite news|title=Live Well HD Network debuts|url=http://abc7chicago.com/archive/6779492/|accessdate=December 4, 2014|work=ABC7 Chicago|publisher=ABC Inc., WLS-TV Chicago|date=April 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the network only had three hours of original programming that are looped throughout the day which was all sourced from ABC stations.&lt;ref name=adwk/&gt; In September 2010, [[Belo]] became the first non-ABC group to sign on with the network, adding it to their stations on November 8, 2010. Not all of the Belo-owned stations originally aired the network in [[16:9|widescreen]] (unlike the ABC group), which led the network to drop the "HD" from its branding to become simply "Live Well Network".&lt;ref name=bc2&gt;{{cite news|last1=Malone|first1=Michael|title=Adds ABC's Live Well Network|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/457792-Belo_Adds_ABC_s_Live_Well_Network.php|accessdate=December 3, 2014|work=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|publisher=NewBay Media|date=September 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two LWN owned and operated stations, [[WJRT]] and [[WTVG]], were sold to [[Lilly Broadcasting]] closing on April 1, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Exclusive: New GMs For Former ABC O&amp;Os in Flint, Toledo|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/466051-Exclusive_New_GMs_For_Former_ABC_O_Os_in_Flint_Toledo.php|accessdate=August 18, 2014|work=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|date=March 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 26, 2011, it was announced that a deal has been reached to air the network on nine [[E. W. Scripps Company|Scripps]]-owned stations (several, but not all of them, are ABC affiliates).&lt;ref name=bc3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/468841-Scripps_Stations_On_Board_With_ABC_S_Live_Well_Network.php|title=Scripps Stations On Board With ABC'S Live Well Network|publisher=Broadcastingcable.com|date=May 26, 2011|accessdate=November 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2011, the network picked up [[CBC Television]]'s [[Steven and Chris]] for broadcast starting that fall.&lt;ref name=bc0&gt;{{cite news|last1=Baysinger|first1=Tim|title='Steven and Chris' to Debut on Live Well Network|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/news-articles/steven-and-chris-debut-live-well-network/112388|accessdate=August 1, 2014|work=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|publisher=NewBay Media, LLC|date=August 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On January 9, 2012, [[Citadel Communications]] announced that it would be adding Live Well to all five (5) of its major network-affiliated stations (four of them ABC affiliates), bringing the network's reach to around 55% U.S. television households.&lt;ref name=bc4&gt;{{cite news|last=Malone|first=Michael|title=Citadel Communications Stations Grab Live Well|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/478731-Citadel_Communications_Stations_Grab_Live_Well.php|accessdate=January 14, 2012|newspaper=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|date=January 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Young Broadcasting]] announced the addition of most of their stations to the network as of the end of January 2012; carriage agreements were maintained when Young was purchased by [[Media General]] in November 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/479562-Young_Broadcasting_Stations_Look_to_Live_Well.php|title=Young Broadcasting Stations Look to Live Well|last=Malone|first=Michael|date=January 23, 2012|publisher=''Broadcasting &amp; Cable''|accessdate=January 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2012, many ABC affiliates switching to the Live Well Network dropped [[Retro Television Network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marcucci|first1=Carl|title=Luken RTV affiliate losses not a big hit|url=http://rbr.com/luken-rtv-affiliate-losses-not-a-big-hit/|accessdate=February 18, 2015|work=Radio-TV Business Report|publisher=Streamline RBR, Inc|date=October 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1-hour two-week LWN block was broadcast on [[Soapnet]] weeknights from 11 PM to 12 AM (ET/PT) starting on July 30, 2012 through Friday, August 10, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SOAPnet Presents Live Well Network Original Programming, Beg.

The network lost affiliates in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] and [[Jackson, Tennessee]] in March 2013 as a result of the sale of [[Newport Television]]'s stations to [[Nexstar Media Group|Nexstar Broadcasting]] (Nexstar generally does not carry subchannel networks in any form; [[WHBF-TV]] in [[Rock Island, Illinois]], acquired by Nexstar in September 2013, eventually dropped LWN at the start of 2014, but it has since been replaced by a standard-definition simulcast of a sister station in the market). 

[[KMCI-TV]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri]] removed the network in favor of [[Bounce TV]] in October 2013, while [[Salt Lake City, Utah]]'s [[KSL-TV]] would add [[Cozi TV]] at LWN's expense in January 2014. On February 17, 2014, [[KMOV]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] dropped the network, as new owner [[Meredith Corporation]] plans on using the bandwidth for [[ATSC M/H]] [[Mobile television|mobile DTV]], better known by the brand name Dyle (the subchannel was later re-launched to allow the launch of a replacement [[MyNetworkTV]] affiliate for the St. Louis area).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/news4stlouis|title=KMOV Facebook Page|accessdate=February 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Phoenix Metropolitan Area|Phoenix]] DMA is the largest TV market that did not have a Live Well Network affiliate, since Scripps-owned [[KNXV-TV]] (an ABC affiliate) switched to [[Antenna TV]] in January 2014, citing viewer demand for the classic TV network as the reason for dropping Live Well.&lt;ref name=KNXV&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc15.com/dpp/about_us/news_releases/abc15-to-launch-antenna-tv-arizona-january-1|title=ABC15 to launch Antenna TV Arizona January 1|date=December 20, 2013|publisher=''KNXV-TV''|accessdate=January 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 9, 2014, network vice president Peggy Allen and ABC Owned Television Stations president Rebecca Campbell jointly announced to Live Well Network's staff that they planned to shut down the network in January 2015. Campbell and Allen stated that despite the success of the network, the division wanted to prioritize "local content" and its "core local news brands".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Downey|first=Kevin|title=No Life Left In Live Well Network|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/76896/no-life-left-in-live-well-network|accessdate=June 9, 2014|work=TV News Check|date=June 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=thr-lwndemise&gt;{{cite web|last=Block|first=Alex|title=Live Well Network's Demise Follows Advertiser Resistance, CBS Plans (Analysis)|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/live-well-networks-demise-follows-710477|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=June 9, 2014|accessdate=June 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the network's shows might move over to the [[FYI (U.S. TV channel)|fyi]] cable network, a network ABC holds a half-interest in with [[Hearst Corporation]] via the [[A&amp;E Networks]] [[joint venture]].&lt;ref name=bc&gt;{{cite news|last1=Malone|first1=Michael|title=ABC to Discontinue Live Well Network|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/local-tv/abc-discontinue-live-well-network/131646|accessdate=August 1, 2014|work=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|publisher=NewBay Media, LLC|date=June 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the shows from ABC's stations are expected to end production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lazare|first1=Lewis|title=ABC to shutter Live Well Network founded in Chicago|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/chicago/news/2014/06/09/abc-to-shutter-live-well-network-founded-in.html|accessdate=December 4, 2014|work=Chicago Business Journal|publisher=American City Business Journals|date=June 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 13, 2015 via an announcement by Green Bay affiliate [[WBAY-TV]] (and later confirmed by Chicago media writer [[Robert Feder]]), ABC announced that the network would be extended for two further months from their previous close date of January 16, 2015 with a revised program schedule to allow their remaining affiliates additional time to find subchannel programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|publisher=WBAY-TV|date=January 13, 2015|title=Live Well Network Lives On|url=http://wbay.com/2015/01/13/live-well-network-lives-on/|accessdate=January 14, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150115011611/http://wbay.com/2015/01/13/live-well-network-lives-on/|archivedate=January 15, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.robertfeder.com/2015/01/16/abcs-live-well-network-isnt-dead-yet|title=ABC’s Live Well Network isn’t dead yet|last=Feder|first=Robert|date=January 16, 2015|work=RobertFeder.com|publisher=[[Chicago Tribune]]|accessdate=January 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Two days later, ABCOTS and the [[E. W. Scripps Company]] announced a pickup of Katz Broadcasting's new subchannel [[Laff (TV network)|Laff]], including the DT3 subchannels of the ABC O&amp;O stations, as of April 15, 2015; within that announcement, ABCOTS stated that Live Well Network would continue on their eight stations on their DT2 subchannels in HD, but no longer be distributed outside of ABC O&amp;O stations.&lt;ref name="lwn-variety"/&gt;&lt;ref name=laff/&gt; As of April 15, 2015, WBAY and all of the former Young stations now owned by Media General continued to run the network, with no mention of any new alternate programming for those subchannels. On May 29, 2015, Comcast was informed that Media General was dropping Live Well from their stations beginning May 30, 2015. Subsequently, the signal was pulled off the Media General stations at the close of business on May 29, with those stations either carrying still text cards apologizing for the end of the network and announcements of replacement programming to come, or carrying alternate station programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forums.xfinity.com/t5/XfinityTV-and-Equipment/Live-Well-Albany-Green-Bay-Knoxville-Lansing-Nashville-Richmond/m-p/2532985|title=Live Well – Albany, Green Bay, Knoxville, Lansing, Nashville, Richmond|date=May 29, 2015|accessdate=April 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programming==
Many of the network's shows were produced by the local [[ABC Owned Television Stations]].&lt;ref name=bc/&gt; Initially, the network only had three hours of original programming that looped throughout the day, all sourced from ABC stations.&lt;ref name=adwk/&gt; The network expanded to six hours of original programming on January 11, 2011 when six more half-hour shows were added. This allowed the programming block to loop three times daily; with rotating episodes to ensure a given episode would not air more than twice in a day.&lt;ref name=wbez&gt;{{cite news|last1=Feder|first1=Robert|title=Even in tough times, ABC 7 succeeds with 'Live Well HD'|url=http://www.wbez.org/blog/robert-feder/even-tough-times-abc-7-succeeds-live-well-hd|accessdate=December 5, 2014|work=wbez.org|publisher=Chicago Public Media|date=January 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By July 2011, the network was scheduling 18 hours of original programming with 1 hour set aside for local programming. In September 2011, 3 hours of children's E/I shows were added.&lt;ref name=tnc1&gt;{{cite news|last1=McAvoy|first1=Kim|title=Diginets Struggle For Place On TV's Frontier|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/52778/diginets-struggle-for-place-on-tvs-frontier/page/3|accessdate=February 18, 2015|work=TVNewsCheck|date=July 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014, [[WPVI-TV|WPVI]]-TV [[Philadelphia]] and LWN were seeking participants for a pilot episode of ''Pop the Question'', a reality series featuring wedding proposals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Green|first1=Jessica|title=6ABC and Live Well Network Are Doing a Philly Casting Call for Their New Dream Proposal Series |url=http://www.phillymag.com/philadelphia-wedding/2014/02/20/6abc-live-well-network-philly-casting-call-new-dream-proposal-series/|accessdate=December 10, 2014|work=Philadelphia Magazine|publisher=Metro Corp|date=February 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[FYI (U.S. TV network)|FYI]], a cable specialty channel partly owned by Disney through [[A&amp;E Networks]], may take on some of the Live Well Network programs with the network's contraction.&lt;ref name=bc/&gt; ''Sweet Retreats'' was picked up starting on {{dts|2014|10|10}} by FYI.&lt;ref name=tfc&gt;{{cite news|title=Listings show only premieres|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/listings/2014/10/10/premieres/|accessdate=December 10, 2014|work=The Funton Critic|date=October 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The network broadcasts in a lower-[[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] form of [[720p]] [[high definition video|HD format]] in order to preserve bandwidth for the main HD station signal and additional [[480i]] digital subchannels.

Cable carriage is also featured in the ABC O&amp;O markets (e.g., [[Xfinity]] in [[Chicago]], [[Fresno, California|Fresno]], [[Houston]], [[Philadelphia]] and [[San Francisco]]; [[Spectrum (cable service)|Spectrum]] in [[Los Angeles]] and the [[Research Triangle]]; [[Altice USA]] in [[New York City]]), either as the full [[high definition television|HD]] feed or a [[480i]] [[standard definition television|standard definition]] version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/209602-Comcast_Adds_27_HD_Networks_in_Houston.php |title=Comcast Adds 27 HD Networks in Houston &amp;#124; Cable Television News &amp;#124; Broadcast Syndication &amp;#124; Programming |publisher=Multichannel.com |date=April 20, 2009 |accessdate=November 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/209517-Cablevision_Hits_100_HD_Channels.php |title=Cablevision Hits 100 HD Channels &amp;#124; Cable Television News &amp;#124; Broadcast Syndication &amp;#124; Programming |work=MultiChannel News|date=April 20, 2009|accessdate=November 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of December 2017, WLS-TV only carries a standard definition version of the network due to a channel sharing agreement with [[UniMas]] station [[WXFT-DT]] which requires a high definition broadcast of that station.

'''Maria Abbey''' was a [[Nursing|nurse]] during the [[American Civil War]]. In [[Mary G. Holland]]'s collection of letters from Civil War nurses, titled, ''Our Army Nurses: Stories from Women in the Civil War'', Abbey recounts her experience as a wartime nurse.&lt;ref name="Our Army Nurses"&gt;{{cite book|last=Holland|first=Mary Gardner|title=Our Army Nurses:Stories from Women in the Civil War|location=Roseville|publisher=Edinborough Press|year=2002|isbn=9781889020044|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was called to the service after hearing [[Reverend H. W. Beecher]] speak of the duty of [[Woman|women]] to help during the war.&lt;ref name="Our Army Nurses"/&gt; She heard this [[sermon]] in April 1861, the Sunday after the battle at [[Fort Sumter]], and enlisted with six other women by the first day of May.&lt;ref name="Our Army Nurses"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A Veteran Nurse"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=SDU18980817.2.21|title=A Veteran Nurse|website=California Digital Newspaper Collection|language=en|access-date=2017-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; These women were some of the first to respond to the call for nurses.&lt;ref name="A Veteran Nurse"/&gt;

Her service began at [[Union Hospital (Washington, D.C.)|Union Hospital]] at [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]]. Immediately, Abbey noticed the lack of structure and organization of the hospital, largely due to the immense need for help.&lt;ref name="Our Army Nurses"/&gt; Ultimately, the hospital environment proved to be too much physical and emotional stress for Abbey, who left September 3, 1861.&lt;ref name="Our Army Nurses"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A Veteran Nurse"/&gt;

This did not stop Abbey from aiding the war effort. Abbey opened her own home to be used as a private hospital for two years, maintained by herself. The house continued to operate as a hospital even after Abbey moved.&lt;ref name="Our Army Nurses"/&gt; She reportedly never expected payment for her services.&lt;ref name="Our Army Nurses"/&gt;

The '''Maternity package''' ({{lang-fi|äitiyspakkaus}}, {{lang-sv|moderskapsförpackning}}) is a kit granted by the [[Finnish social security]] institution [[Kela (Finnish)|Kela]], to all expectant or adoptive parents who live in [[Finland]] or are covered by the Finnish [[social security]] system. The package contains children's clothes and other necessary items, such as [[Diaper|nappies]], bedding, cloth, gauze towels and child-care products.{{sfn|Kela: Maternity package}} It was first issued in 1938{{sfn|Korppi-Tommola|2006|p=15}} to parents with a low income, and contained a blanket, crib sheets, diapers, and fabric which parents could use to make clothing for the baby.{{sfn|United Press International|2013}}

Since 1949 it has been given to all mothers-to-be, provided they visited a doctor or municipal pre-natal clinic before the end of their fourth month of pregnancy, and the pregnancy has lasted at least 154 days.{{sfn|BBC|2013}} The contents of the package are updated approximately every year.{{sfn|Kela: Maternity grant}}

Following a [[BBC]] story in June 2013, the "baby box" began to receive international attention. Similar packages, commercial or state-sponsored, are being trialled around the world.

==Package==
[[File:Finnish maternity package of 2014.jpg|alt=Picture of some of the items inside the maternity package in 2014.|left|thumb|300x300px|Parts of the maternity package in 2014.]]

In 1949, the box given was standard to all expectant mothers who visited a doctor before the fourth month of pregnancy{{sfn|United Press International|2013}} per the Finnish Maternity Grants Act. A baby bottle was added to the package, but was removed in later packages to encourage [[breastfeeding]].{{sfn|United Press International|2013}}{{sfn|Tierney|2013}} The requirement to visit a doctor as a prerequisite to receiving the package was done in order ensure that the woman received adequate [[prenatal care]].{{sfn|Lee|2013}}

The box containing the package transforms into a crib in which many newborns have their first naps.{{sfn|Lee|2013}} A mother may choose to take the maternity package, or a cash grant of 140 euros, but 95% of Finnish mothers choose the box because it's worth significantly more.{{sfn|Lee|2013}} The maternity package can either be applied for online, on Kela's website, or by completing and returning a form.{{sfn|Kela: Maternity grant}}

The current package contents include bodysuits, a sleeping bag, outdoor gear, bathing products for the baby, nappies and cream, bedding and a small mattress (allowing the box to be used as a crib),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.bbc.com/news/magazine-22751415|title=Why Finnish babies sleep in cardboard boxes|last=Lee|first=Helena|date=2013-06-04|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2014-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; a hooded bath towel, nail scissors, hairbrush, toothbrush, wash cloth, muslin squares, a picture book, teething toy, bra pads, and condoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-magazine-monitor-23138306|title=Royal baby: William and Catherine get Finnish baby box|date=2013-07-02|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2014-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The maternity package is not a commercial product, and therefore Kela cannot sell it.{{sfn|Kela: Maternity grant}} [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|Prince William]] and [[Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge]] received a maternity package as a gift from Kela in 2013. [[Crown Princess Victoria]] and [[Prince Daniel, Duke of Västergötland|Prince Daniel]] of [[Sweden]] were given one in 2012.{{sfn|BBC|2013}}

==Effects==
The program resulted in increased prenatal care for pregnant women, and decreased [[infant mortality]].{{sfn|United Press International|2013}} The program is now considered a part of the [[culture of Finland]].{{sfn|Tierney|2013}}

==Similar programs in other countries==  
In July 2015, [[Argentina]]'s Ministry of Health under then-president [[Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner]] introduced "Plan Qunita" which distributes maternity packages to parents of newborn babies. At the rollout of the program, about 144,000 Qunitas were issued.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lanacion.com.ar/1810982-que-es-el-plan-qunita-que-anuncio-hoy-la-presidenta-cristina-kirchner|title=Qué es el plan Qunita que anunció hoy la presidenta Cristina Kirchner|last=|first=|date=16 July 2015|work=LA NACION|access-date=5 August 2018|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebubble.com/qunita-plan-scandal/|title=The scandal around baby crib handouts, or, ‘The Qunita Plan,’ explained|date=2016-02-17|publisher=The Bubble|accessdate=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Scottish National Party]] leader [[Nicola Sturgeon]] pledged to implement a similar scheme in [[Scotland]] in her party's manifesto for the [[Scottish general election, 2016|2016 election]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/thesnp/pages/5540/attachments/original/1461753756/SNP_Manifesto2016-accesible.pdf?1461753756|title=Manifesto 2016|last=|first=|date=2016|website=Scottish National Party|page=4|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=27 April 2017|quote=Every new-born in Scotland will be entitled to a ‘baby box’, offering essential items for a child’s first weeks – adapting the successful Finnish model which has helped to improve lives for babies and toddlers.}}&lt;/ref&gt; which saw the SNP returned as a minority government. After a three-month pilot scheme in [[Clackmannanshire]] and [[Orkney]], the Scottish "baby box" began to be issued to all parents with newborns in summer 2017,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-38470905|title=Scottish baby box pilot scheme launched|date=2017-01-01|accessdate=2017-01-01|website=[[BBC News Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; with over 52,000 such boxes issued in the first twelve months of the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-45189506|title=More than 52,000 baby boxes given out in scheme's first year|date=2018-08-15|accessdate=2018-10-07|website=[[BBC News Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2017, it was announced that the [[United States|U.S.]] state of [[New Jersey]] would become the first state in the country to adopt the baby box program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/26/health/new-jersey-baby-boxes-safe-sleep/index.html|title=New Jersey gives out free baby boxes|last=CNN|first=Tal Trachtman Alroy|website=CNN|access-date=2017-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''NATO EPVAT testing''' is one of the three recognized classes of procedures used in the world to control the safety and quality of [[ammunition|firearms ammunition]].

Beside this, there are also the ''[[Commission Internationale Permanente pour l'Epreuve des Armes à Feu Portatives]]'' (C.I.P.) class of procedures and the [[Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers' Institute]] (SAAMI) class of procedures.

EPVAT Testing is described in [[Classified information#Classification levels|unclassified]] documents by [[NATO]], more precisely by the AC/225 Army Armaments Group (NAAG).&lt;ref name="dstan.mod.uk"&gt;[http://www.dstan.mod.uk/standards/defstans/05/101/01000100.pdf Proof of Ordnance, Munitions, Armour and Explosives, Ministry of Defence Defence Standard 05-101 Part 1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716024825/http://www.dstan.mod.uk/standards/defstans/05/101/01000100.pdf |date=2011-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

EPVAT is an abbreviation for "Electronic Pressure Velocity and Action Time". Action Time here means the (short amount of) time required between the ignition of the primer and the projectile leaving the barrel. This is a comprehensive procedure for testing ammunition using state-of-the-art instruments and computers. The procedure itself is described in NATO document AC/225 (Com. III/SC.1)D/200.

Unlike the C.I.P. procedures aiming only at the user's safety, the NATO procedures for ammunition testing also includes comprehensive functional quality testing in relation with the intended use. That is, not only the soldier's safety is looked at, but also his capacity to incapacitate the enemy. As a result, for every ammunition order by NATO, a complete acceptance approval on both safety and functionality is performed by both NATO and the relevant ammunition manufacturers in a contradictory fashion.

For this, a highly accurate and indisputable protocol has been defined by NATO experts using a system of reference cartridges.&lt;ref name="dstan.mod.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dstan.mod.uk/standards/defstans/05/101/02000100.pdf Proof of Ordnance, Munitions, Armour and Explosives, Ministry of Defence Defence Standard 05-101 Part 2] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100408095542/http%3A//www.dstan.mod.uk/standards/defstans/05/101/02000100.pdf |date=2010-04-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://www.dstan.mod.uk/standards/defstans/05/101/03000100.pdf Proof of Ordnance, Munitions, Armour and Explosives, Ministry of Defence Defence Standard 05-101 Part 3] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716024840/http://www.dstan.mod.uk/standards/defstans/05/101/03000100.pdf |date=2011-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The civilian organisations C.I.P. and SAAMI use less comprehensive test procedures than NATO, but NATO test centres have the advantage that only a few chamberings are in military use. The C.I.P. and SAAMI proof houses must be capable of testing hundreds of different chamberings requiring lots of different test barrels, etc..

== NATO Reference cartridges system ==
In this system, the ammunition manufacturers, in close cooperation with NATO, have set aside a batch (also termed "lot") of ammunition they consider to be of very good quality and representative of ammunition that should be delivered to the armies in the following years. This batch is maintained at approved NATO test centres and distributed to the manufacturers involved. When a new batch (lot) is delivered, a set of 20 reference cartridges are fired to see how they behave with the local equipment and with the current atmospheric conditions. Results are then compared to the reference values, as maintained by NATO and correctors (delta values) are computed. Then, the current batch (lot) of ammunition is fired and the correctors are applied on the measured value giving a result "comparable" to the reference itself.

This test is performed under normal conditions but also by simulating [[Polar climate|cold polar]] {{convert|-54|°C|°F}} or hot [[desert]] {{convert|52|°C|°F}} [[List of weather records|conditions]] using special cooling equipment and [[oven]]s to cool or heat the ammunition under test to the appropriate levels of humidity and temperatures required.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/ndia/2007smallarms/5_9_07/Geddes_1120am.pdf NATO Small Arms Ammunition Interchangeability via Direct Evidence Testing]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Proofing ==
{{see also|Small arms ammunition pressure testing|Proof test}}

The minimum proof and performance requirements for small arms ammunition of NATO calibres are covered in [[STANAG]]s as follows:
* 5.56 mm. STANAG 4172 and NATO Manual of Proof and Inspection AC/225 (LG/3-SG/1) D/8.
* 7.62 mm. STANAG 2310 and NATO Manual of Proof and Inspection AC/225 (LG/3-SG/1) D/9.
* 9 mm. STANAG 4090 and NATO Manual of Proof and Inspection AC/225 (P111-SP1) D/170(REV).
* 12.7 mm. STANAG 4383 and NATO Manual of Proof and Inspection AC/225 (LG/3-SG/1) D/11.

Each weapon and component considered vulnerable to the effects of a rapid change in pressure, for example barrels, breech blocks and bolts, will be tested by firing one dry round at a corrected minimum of 25% over pressure and one oiled round at a corrected minimum of 25% over pressure. 25% over pressure means 25% in excess of the Service Pressure (P&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;). The Service Pressure is defined as the mean pressure generated by the Service Cartridge at a temperature of {{convert|21|°C|°F}}. Such a high pressure proof is conducted with both the weapon and ammunition conditioned to an ambient temperature of {{convert|21|°C|°F}}.

Each weapon will be individually tested, from an ammunition lot that produces a minimum corrected mean chamber pressure in accordance with the table below:&lt;ref name="dstan.mod.uk"/&gt;

''The above proof round pressure requirements for the 9 mm and 12.7 mm rounds established by the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|British Ministry of Defence]] are higher than the current (2008) C.I.P. proof round pressure requirement legislation for the civilian equivalent [[9mm Parabellum]] (C.I.P. P&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; rating 235 MPA / (34,083 psi) and [[.50 Browning]] (C.I.P. P&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; rating 370 MPA / (53,663 psi) rounds.&lt;ref name="C.I.P. TDCC1"&gt;[http://www.cip-bobp.org/homologation/uploads/tdcc/tab-iv/tabivcal-en-page28.pdf C.I.P. TDCC sheet 9mm Luger]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="C.I.P.

TDCC sheet 50 Browning]&lt;/ref&gt; The 9×19mm NATO and 12.7×99mm NATO rounds can be regarded as [[overpressure ammunition]]''

Unlike the civilian C.I.P. test procedures NATO EPVAT testing procedures for the "NATO chamberings" require the pressure sensor or transducer to be mounted ahead of the case mouth. The advantage of this mounting position is that there is no need to drill the cartridge case to mount the transducer. Drilling prior to firing is always a time consuming process (fast quality control and feedback to production is essential during the ammunition manufacturing process). The disadvantage of this mount is that the pressure rises much faster than in a drilled cartridge case. This causes high frequency oscillations of the pressure sensor (approx 200&amp;nbsp;kHz for a Kistler 6215 transducer) and this requires [[Filter (signal processing)|electronic filtering]] with the drawback that filtering also affects the lower harmonics where a peak is found causing a slight error in the measurement. This slight error is not always well mastered and this causes a lot of discussion about the filter order, cutoff frequency and its type ([[Bessel filter|Bessel]] or [[Butterworth filter|Butterworth]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a300525.pdf Technical Report ARCCD-TR-95005 5.56 MM M856 TRACER MINI ROUND ROUND ROBIN STUDY, ARDEC/CCAC, October 1995 by Lascelles A.

'''Neonatal infections''' are infections of the [[Infant|neonate]] (newborn) acquired during [[prenatal development]] or in the first four weeks of life (neonatal period).&lt;ref name="Medline"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002271.htm |title=Neonate |publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine |editors=Neil K.

Editorial team |date=December 4, 2013 |accessdate=January 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neonatal infections may be contracted by [[Vertically transmitted infection|mother to child]] [[transmission (medicine)|transmission]], in the [[Vagina|birth canal]] during [[childbirth]], or contracted after birth.&lt;ref name="Merck"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/pediatrics/infections-in-neonates/overview-of-neonatal-infections |title=Overview of Neonatal Infections |author=Mary T. Caserta |publisher=Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Corporation |date=October 2015 |accessdate=January 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some neonatal infections are apparent soon after delivery, while others may develop in the [[Postpartum period|postnatal period]]. Some neonatal infections such as [[HIV/AIDS|HIV]], [[hepatitis B]], and [[malaria]] do not become apparent until much later.

There is a higher risk of infection for [[Preterm birth|preterm]] or [[low birth weight]] neonates. [[Infant respiratory distress syndrome]] is often a condition of preterm neonates that can have long-term negative consequences, it can also arise following an infection. In some instances, neonatal respiratory tract diseases may increase the susceptibility to future respiratory infections and inflammatory responses related to lung disease.&lt;ref name="Pryhuber2015" /&gt;

[[Antibiotics]] can be effective for neonatal infections, especially when the [[pathogen]] is quickly identified. Instead of relying solely on culturing techniques, pathogen identification has improved substantially with advancing technology; however, [[Infant mortality|neonate mortality]] reduction has not kept pace and remains 20% to 50%.&lt;ref name="Florin2011"&gt;{{cite book |last=Florin |first=Todd |title=Netter's pediatrics |publisher=Elsevier Saunders |location=Philadelphia, PA |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-4377-1155-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; While preterm neonates are at a particularly high risk, all neonates can develop infection. Neonatal infection may also be associated with [[premature rupture of membranes]] (breakage of the [[amniotic sac]]) which substantially increases the risk of [[neonatal sepsis]] by allowing passage for bacteria to enter the womb prior to the birth of the infant.&lt;ref name="SantoshamChan2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Medscape"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/978352-clinical |title=Neonatal Sepsis Clinical Presentation |publisher=WebMD LLC |authors=Ann L Anderson-Berry, Linda L Bellig, Bryan L Ohning |date=December 31, 2015 |accessdate=January 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neonatal infection can be distressing to the family and it initiates concentrated effort to treat it by [[clinicians]]. Research to improve treatment of infections and prophylactic treatment of the mother to avoid infections of the infant is ongoing.

==Causes ==
In industrialized countries, [[Medical treatment|treatment]] for neonatal infections takes place in the [[neonatal intensive care unit]]. The causes and reasons for neonatal infection are many. The origin of infectious [[bacteria]] and some other [[pathogen]]s is often the [[mother|maternal]] [[gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal]] and [[Genitourinary system|genitourinary tract]]. Many of the maternal infections with these organisms are [[asymptomatic]] in the mother. Other maternal infections that may be transmitted to the infant in [[vertical transmission|utero]] or during birth are bacterial and viral [[Sexually transmitted infection|sexually transmitted infections.]]&lt;ref name="MacDonald2015" /&gt; The infant's ability to resist infection is limited by its immature [[immune system]]. The causative agents of neonatal infection are bacteria, viruses, and [[Fungus|fungi]]. In addition, the immune system of the neonate may respond in ways that can create problems that complicate treatment, such as the release of [[Cytokine|inflammatory chemicals]]. Congenital defects of the immune system also affect the infants ability to fight off the infection.&lt;ref name="Isaacs2014" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Leveno | first = Kenneth | title = Williams manual of pregnancy complications | publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical | location = New York | year = 2013 | isbn = 9780071765626 |page=507 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bacteria===
[[File:Listeria monocytogenes PHIL 2287 lores.jpg|thumb|Listeria monocytogenes]]
[[Streptococcus agalactiae|Group B streptococcus]] are typically identified as the cause of the majority of early-onset infections in the neonate.&lt;ref name="MacDonald2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LiHuang2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Li|first1=Shunming|last2=Huang|first2=Jingya|last3=Chen|first3=Zhiyao|last4=Guo|first4=Dan|last5=Yao|first5=Zhenjiang|last6=Ye|first6=Xiaohua|title=Antibiotic Prevention for Maternal Group B Streptococcal Colonization on Neonatal GBS-Related Adverse Outcomes: A Meta-Analysis|journal=Frontiers in Microbiology|volume=8|pages=374|year=2017|issn=1664-302X|doi=10.3389/fmicb.2017.00374|pmid=28367139|pmc=5355432}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ohlsson|first1=A|last2=Shah|first2=VS|title=Intrapartum antibiotics for known maternal Group B streptococcal colonization.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=10 June 2014|issue=6|pages=CD007467|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD007467.pub4|pmid=24915629}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This pathogen is [[vertically transmitted infection|vertically transmitted]] (transmitted directly from the mother) to the infant.&lt;ref name="Bennett2015"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bennett |first=John |title=Mandell, Douglas, and Bennett's principles and practice of infectious diseases |publisher=Elsevier/Saunders |location=Philadelphia, PA |year=2015 |isbn=978-1-4557-4801-3 |postscript=; Access provided by the [[University of Pittsburgh]].}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Human gastrointestinal tract|Enteric]] [[bacilli]] that originate from the [[Human digestive system|digestive system]] of the mother have become as prevalent as the group B streptococcus pathogens and are currently as likely to cause infection. With the advances in preventing group B streptococcus infections, β-lactam-resistant ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' infections have increased in causing neonatal deaths in very low birthweight and premature infants.&lt;ref name="Bennett2015" /&gt; Infections with ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' are also diagnosed, but not as frequently as group B streptococcus infections.&lt;ref name="SantoshamChan2013" /&gt;

''[[Listeria monocytogenes]]'' can also cause infection acquired from [[Foodborne illness|tainted food]] and present in the mother.&lt;ref name="Florin2011" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Listeria (Listeriosis) |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |url=https://www.cdc.gov/listeria/index.html |date=22 October 2015 |accessdate=2015-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of this pathogen can sometimes be determined by the symptoms that appear as a [[Gastrointestinal disease|gastrointestinal illness]] in the mother. The mother acquires infection from ingesting food that contains [[animal product]]s such as [[hot dog]]s, [[pasteurization|unpasteurized]] [[milk]], [[Smoked meat|delicatessen meats]], and [[cheese]].

Neonatal infection can also occur in term and post-term infants.&lt;ref name="SiriwachirachaiSangkomkamhang2014"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Siriwachirachai |first1=Thitiporn |last2=Sangkomkamhang |first2=Ussanee S |last3=Lumbiganon |first3=Pisake |last4=Laopaiboon |first4=Malinee |last5=Siriwachirachai |first5=Thitiporn |title=Antibiotics for meconium-stained amniotic fluid in labour for preventing maternal and neonatal infections |year=2014 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD007772.pub3 |pmid=25374369 |postscript=; Access provided by the University of Pittsburgh |journal=Reviews|issue=11 |pages=CD007772 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Infections that develop one month after the birth of the infant are more likely due to [[Gram-positive bacteria]] and [[Staphylococcus|coagulase positive staphylococci]].&lt;ref name="Fanaroff2013" /&gt;
Acquired maternal infection and subsequent inflammation from ''[[Ureaplasma urealyticum infection|Ureaplasma urealyticum]]'' is accompanied by a strong immune response and is correlated with the need for prolonged [[mechanical ventilation]].&lt;ref name="Pryhuber2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MacDonald2015" /&gt;

''[[Clostridium tetani]]'' can cause a generalised form of [[neonatal tetanus|tetanus]] in the neonate. This usually occurs when the mother has not been vaccinated against tetanus and the baby has not acquired passive immunity. The umbilical cord region is the most susceptible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wpro.who.int/immunization/factsheets/tetanus_nt/en/|title=Tetanus and neonatal tetanus (NT)|website=WHO Western Pacific Region|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503223407/http://www.wpro.who.int/immunization/factsheets/tetanus_nt/en/|archivedate=2014-05-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other bacterial pathogens include ''[[Streptococcus agalactiae]]'', ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'', ''[[Viridans streptococci]]'', ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'', ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'', and ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]''.&lt;ref name="BaucellsMercadal Hally2015"/&gt;

===Viruses===

==== HIV ====
[[HIV|Human immunodeficiency virus]] type I (HIV) infection can occur during labor and delivery, in utero through mother-to-child transmission or postnatally by way of breastfeeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fetal and neonatal secrets|last=Polin|first=Richard|publisher=Elsevier Saunders|year=2014|isbn=978-0-323-09139-8|location=Philadelphia|pages=|postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transmission can occur during pregnancy, delivery or breastfeeding. Most transmission occurs during delivery. In women with low detectable levels of the virus, the incidence of transmission is lower.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Transmission risk can be reduced by:
*providing antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy and immediately after birth
*delivery by caesarean section
*not breastfeeding 
*antiretroviral prophylaxis in infants born to mothers with HIV.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/cdna-song-HIV.htm|title=Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV)|last=Health|first=Australian Government Department of|website=www.health.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A low number of women whose HIV status are unknown until after the birth, do not benefit from interventions that could help lower the risk of mother-to-child HIV transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/cda-cdi3503d.htm|title=Australian Paediatric Surveillance Unit annual report, 2010|last=Ageing|first=Australian Government Department of Health and|website=www.health.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cytomegalovirus ====
Sixty percent of mothers of preterm infants are infected with [[Human cytomegalovirus|
cytomegalovirus]] (CMV). Infection is [[asymptomatic]] in most instances but 9% to 12% of postnatally infected low birth weight, preterm infants have severe, sepsis-like infection. CMV infection duration can be long and result in [[pneumonitis]] in association with [[fibrosis]]. CMV infection in infants has an unexpected effect on the [[Neutropenia|white blood cells]] of the [[immune system]] causing them to prematurely age. This leads to a reduced [[Immunity (medical)|immune response]] similar to that found in the elderly.&lt;ref name="Pryhuber2015" /&gt;

==== HSV ====
[[Herpes simplex virus]] (HSV) can infect the infant during birth. Most women with HVS [[Herpes genitalis|genital herpes]] develop asymptomatic infection during pregnancy. HVS [[inoculation]] from mother to fetus has a high likelihood of occurring. Mothers who are treated with antiviral prophylaxis are less prone to have an active, symptomatic case at the time of birth. Mothers who have received prophylactic [[Antiviral drug|antiviral medication]] have been shown to be less likely to require a cesarean section. At delivery, mothers treated with antiviral medication are less likely to have a viral shedding at the time of birth.&lt;ref name="HollierWendel2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hollier|first1=Lisa M|last2=Wendel|first2=George D|last3=Hollier|first3=Lisa M|year=2008|title=Third trimester antiviral prophylaxis for preventing maternal genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) recurrences and neonatal infection|journal=Reviews|issue=1|pages=CD004946|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004946.pub2|pmid=18254066|postscript=; Access provided by the University of Pittsburgh.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Zika ====
[[Zika fever]] is caused by a virus that is acquired by the mother and then transmitted to the infant in utero. The CDC is concerned with the potential that this viral infection may cause [[microcephaly]] in newborns.&lt;ref name="saude 21014"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portalsaude.saude.gov.br/index.php/cidadao/principal/agencia-saude/21014-ministerio-da-saude-confi%20rma-relacao-entre-virus-zika-e-microcefalia|title=Ministério da Saúde confirma relação entre vírus Zika e microcefalia|author=Leonardo Aguiar|work=Portal da Saúde – Ministério da Saúde – http://www.saude.gov.br|access-date=2016-02-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129082949/http://portalsaude.saude.gov.br/index.php/cidadao/principal/agencia-saude/21014-ministerio-da-saude-confi%20rma-relacao-entre-virus-zika-e-microcefalia|archive-date=2016-01-29|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oliveira16"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oliveira Melo|first=A.

==== Rubella ====
Congential rubella is still a risk with higher risk among immigrant women from countries without adequate vaccination programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/cda-cdi3503d.htm|title=Australian Paediatric Surveillance Unit annual report, 2010|last=Ageing|first=Australian Government Department of Health and|website=www.health.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Other ====
Other viral infections such as [[Human respiratory syncytial virus|respiratory syncytial virus]] (RSV), [[Human metapneumovirus|metapneumovirus]] (hMPV), [[rhinovirus]], [[Human parainfluenza viruses|parainfluenza]] (PIV), and [[Coronavirus|human coronavirus]] in the neonatal period are associated with recurrent [[Wheeze|wheezing]] in later childhood. RSV infections can be prolonged. Premature infants born at less than 32 weeks [[gestation]] have more days of cough and wheeze at 1 year of age than those uninfected with RSV.&lt;ref name="Pryhuber2015" /&gt;

===Fungi===
In very low birth weight infants (VLBWI), systemic fungus infection is a [[hospital-acquired infection]] with serious consequences. The pathogens are usually ''[[Candida albicans]]'' and ''[[Candida parapsilosis]]''. A small percentage of fungal infections are caused by ''[[Aspergillus]]'', ''[[Zygomycota|Zygomycetes]]'', ''[[Malassezia]]'', and ''[[Trichosporon]]''.&lt;ref name="Martin2015"&gt;{{cite book |last=Martin |first=Richard |title=Fanaroff and Martin's neonatal-perinatal medicine : diseases of the fetus and infant |publisher=Elsevier/Saunders |location=Philadelphia, PA |year=2015 |isbn=978-1-4557-5617-9 |postscript=; Access provided by the University of Pittsburgh.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cloherty2012" /&gt; Infection is usually late-onset. Up to 9% of VLBWI with birth weights of &lt;1,000 g develop these fungus infections leading to sepsis or meningitis. As many as one-third of these infants can die. Candidiasis is associated with retinopathy, prematurity and negative neurodevelopmental consequences. Candida can colonize the gastrointestinal tract of low birthweight infants (LBI). This gastrointestinal colonization is often a precursor to a more serious invasive infection. The risk of serious candida infection increases when multiple factors are present. These are: [[thrombocytopenia]], the presence of candidal dermatitis, the use of systemic steroids, birth weights of &lt;1,000 g, presence of a central catheter, postponing enteral feeding, vaginal delivery, and the amount of time broad-spectrum antibiotics were given.&lt;ref name="Cloherty2012"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cloherty |first=John |title=Manual of neonatal care |publisher=Wolters Kluwer Health/Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |location=Philadelphia |year=2012 |isbn=978-1-60831-777-6 |postscript=; Access provided by the University of Pittsburgh.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Protozoans ===
Infants born with [[malaria]] can be infected with a variety of [[species]]; ''[[Plasmodium vivax]]'', ''[[Plasmodium malariae]]'', ''[[Plasmodium ovale]]'', and ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]''. In most instances of congenital marlaria is caused by ''P. vivax'' and ''P. falciparum''. Women living in areas where malaria is prevalent and common are repeatedly exposed to malaria. In response to maternal infection, mothers develop antimalarial [[Antibody|antibodies]]. It is probable that the antibodies present in the mother offers protection for the baby. Bacterial infection can develop with malaria.&lt;ref name="Martin2015" /&gt;

Infants that are infected by the protozoan''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]'' in utero can be born with [[chorioretinitis]] or ocular toxoplasmosis. Globally, it is the most common cause of infections of the back of the eye. (posterior segment). The most common sign is decreased vision in one eye. Other signs and symptoms may appear after the neonatal period and include: chorioretinitis development later in life, intracranial calcification hydrocephalus or central nervous system abnormalities.&lt;ref name="TorgersonMastroiacovo2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Torgerson |first1=Paul R |last2=Mastroiacovo |first2=Pierpaolo |title=The global burden of congenital toxoplasmosis: a systematic review |journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization |volume=91 |issue=7 |year=2013 |pages=501–508 |url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/91/7/12-111732.pdf |issn=0042-9686 |doi=10.2471/BLT.12.111732 |access-date=16 January 2016 |pmid=23825877 |pmc=3699792}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Risk factors ==
Risk factors are those conditions which increase the likelihood that an infant will be born with or develop an infection. &lt;!--Antibiotics can be effective, and methods of pathogen identification is faster, yet mortality remains 20% to 50%.&lt;ref name="Florin2011" /&gt; Neonatal infections are more likely to occur among black infants; early onset sepsis is twice as common among black infants compared to white infants.&lt;ref name="Fanaroff2013" /&gt;--&gt;

The risk for developing catheter-related infections is offset by the increased survival rate of premature infants that have early onset sepsis. Intravenous administration of prophylactic immunoglobin enhances immunity of the immature infant and is used for treatment.&lt;ref name="Fanaroff2013" /&gt;

==Mechanism==
[[File:Chorioamnionitis - intermed mag.jpg|thumb|Chorioamnionitis]]
Inflammation accompanies infection and is likely to complicate [[Therapy|treatment]] and recovery. Inflammation is linked to reduced growth of the [[lung]]s of the premature baby.&lt;ref name="Pryhuber2015" /&gt;

===Pathogenesis===
The recent identification of the presence of [[microorganism]]s in maternal-infant body fluids that were previously thought to be sterile has provided one explanation for the presence of the inflammatory response in both the mother and infant. Sixty-one percent of pregnant women with [[chorioamnionitis]], or inflammation of the [[amniotic fluid]], were found to be infected by microorganisms. Often, [[Coinfection|more than one]] pathogen was present. In fifteen percent of pregnant women inflammation was still evident even though there was no evidence of pathogens. This may indicate that there are other causes. A high percentage, 51% to 62%, of pregnant women who had chorioamnionitis also had inflammation of the [[placenta]].&lt;ref name="Pryhuber2015" /&gt;
&lt;!-- ===Pathophysiology === --&gt;

==Diagnosis ==
[[Diagnosis]] of infection is based upon the recovery of the pathogen or pathogens from the typically [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterile]] sites in the mother or the baby. Unfortunately, as many half of pregnant women are asymptomatic with a gonorrhea infection and other sexually transmitted infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pelvic Inflammatory Disease Empiric Therapy |publisher=Medscape |date=2015 |first1=Ritu |last1=Kumar |first2=Michael Stuart |last2=Bronze |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/2011881-overview# |accessdate=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zakher"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zakher |first1=Bernadette |last2=Cantor MD |first2=Amy G. |last3=Daeges |first3=Monica |last4=Nelson MD |first4=Heidi |title=Review: Screening for Gonorrhea and Chlamydia: A Systematic Review for the U.S. Prevententive Services Task Force |journal=Annals of Internal Medicine |pages=884–894 |date=December 16, 2014 |volume=161 |issue=12 |doi=10.7326/M14-1022|pmid=25244000 |citeseerx=10.1.1.691.6232 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kenner2014"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kenner |first=Carole |title=Comprehensive neonatal nursing care |publisher=Springer Publishing Company, LLC |location=New York, NY |edition=5th |year=2014 |isbn=978-0-8261-0975-0}} Access provided by the University of Pittsburgh.&lt;/ref&gt; Samples are obtained from [[urine culture|urine]], [[blood culture|blood]] or [[cerebrospinal fluid]].

===Viral infection===
Symptoms and the isolation of the virus pathogen the upper respiratory tract is diagnostic. Virus identification is specific immunologic methods and PCR. The presence of the virus can be rapidly confirmed by the detection of the virus antigen. The methods and materials used for identifying the RSV virus has a specificity and sensitivity approaching 85% to 95%. Not all studies confirm this sensitivity. Antigen detection has comparatively lower sensitivity rates that approach 65% to 75%.&lt;ref name="Mayhall2012"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mayhall |first=C |title=Hospital epidemiology and infection control |publisher=Wolters Kluwer Health/Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |location=Philadelphia |year=2012 |isbn=978-1-60831-300-6 |postscript=; Access provided by the University of Pittsburgh.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Neonatal sepsis ===
{{Main|Neonatal sepsis}}
Neonatal sepsis of the newborn is an infection that has spread through the entire body. The inflammatory response to this systematic infection can be as serious as the infection itself.&lt;ref name="Pryhuber2015" /&gt; In infants that weigh under 1500 g, [[sepsis]] is the most common cause of death. Three to four percent of infants per 1000 births contract sepsis. The mortality rate from sepsis is near 25%.&lt;ref name="Florin2011" /&gt; Infected sepsis in an infant can be identified by culturing the blood and spinal fluid and if suspected, intravenous antibiotics are usually started. Lumbar puncture is controversial because in some cases it has found not to be necessary while concurrently, without it estimates of missing up to one third of infants with meningitis is predicted.&lt;ref name="Fanaroff2013" /&gt; 
&lt;!-- ===differential diagnosis === --&gt;

==Prevention==
To reduce neonatal infection, screening of pregnant women for HIV, hepatitis B, and syphilis, is available in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Infectious diseases in pregnancy screening: programme overview; Detailed guidance |publisher=GOV.UK

Because GBS bacteria can colonize the lower reproductive tract of 30% of women, typically pregnant women are tested for this pathogen from 35 to 37 weeks of pregnancy. Before delivery treatment of the mother with antibiotics reduces the rate of neonatal infection.&lt;ref name="SantoshamChan2013" /&gt; Prevention of the infection of the baby is done by treating the mother with penicillin. Since the adoption of this prophylatic treatment, infant mortality from GBS infection has decreased by 80%.&lt;ref name="Florin2011" /&gt;

Mothers with symptomatic [[Herpes simplex virus|genital herpes]] and who are treated with antiviral prophylaxis are less prone to have an active, symptomatic case at the time of birth and it may be able to reduce the risk of passing on HSV during birth. Cesarean delivery reduces the risk of infection of the infant.&lt;ref name="HollierWendel2008" /&gt;

[[Breastfeeding]] has been shown to protect the neonate from some infections. .&lt;ref name="pmid10394490"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kunz C, Rodriguez-Palmero M, Koletzko B, Jensen R | title = Nutritional and biochemical properties of human milk, Part I: General aspects, proteins, and carbohydrates | journal = Clinics in Perinatology | volume = 26 | issue = 2 | pages = 307–33 | date = June 1999 | pmid = 10394490 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid10394491"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rodriguez-Palmero M, Koletzko B, Kunz C, Jensen R | title = Nutritional and biochemical properties of human milk: II.

==Treatment==
Neonatal infection treatment is typically started before the diagnosis of the cause can be confirmed. 
Neonatal infection can be prophylactically treated with antibiotics.&lt;ref name="MacDonald2015" /&gt; Maternal treatment with antibiotics is primarily used to protect against group B streptococcus.&lt;ref name="Fanaroff2013" /&gt;

Women with a history of [[Herpes simplex virus|genital herpes]], can be treated with antiviral drugs to prevent symptomatic lesions and viral shedding that could infect the infant at birth. The antiviral medications used include acyclovir, penciclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir. Only very small amounts of the drug can be detected in the fetus. There are no increases in drug-related abnormalities in the infant that could be attributed to acyclovir. Long-term effects of antiviral medications have not been evaluated for their effects after growth and development of the child occurs. Neutropenia can be a complication of acyclovir treatment of neonatal HSV infection, but is usually transient.&lt;ref name="HollierWendel2008" /&gt; Treatment with immunoglobulin therapy has not been proven to be effective.&lt;ref name="OhlssonLacy2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ohlsson |first1=Arne |last2=Lacy |first2=Janet B |last3=Ohlsson |first3=Arne |title=Intravenous immunoglobulin for suspected or proven infection in neonates |year=2015 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001239.pub5 |pmid=25815707 |journal=Reviews|issue=3 |pages=CD001239 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neonates are prone to infection in the first month of life. Some organisms such as ''[[S. agalactiae]]'' (group B streptococcus or GBS) are more prone to cause these occasionally fatal infections. Risk factors for GBS infection include:
* prematurity (birth before 37 weeks gestation)
* a sibling who has had a [[group B streptococcus|GBS]] infection
* prolonged labour or rupture of membranes

Untreated sexually transmitted infections are associated with congenital and perinatal infections in neonates, particularly in the areas where rates of infection remain high. The overall perinatal mortality rate associated with untreated syphilis, for example, is 30%.&lt;ref name="WHO-STI"&gt;{{cite web |title=Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs110/en/ |volume=Fact sheet 110 |date=May 2013 |accessdate=2013-08-30 |publisher=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

{{Further|Perinatal mortality}}

Up to 3.3 million newborns die each year and 23.4% of these die of neonatal infection. About half of the deaths caused by sepsis or pneumonia happen in the first week postpartum. In industrialized countries, prophylactic antibiotic treatment of the mothers identified with group B streptococcus, early identification of sepsis in the newborn, and administration of antibiotics to the newborn has reduced mortality.&lt;ref name="SantoshamChan2013" /&gt; Neonatal herpes in North America is estimated to be from 5&amp;nbsp;– 80 per 100,000 live births. HSV has a lower prevalence in mothers outside the United States. In the United Kingdom the incidence is much lower and estimated to be 1.6 per 100,000 live births. Approximately 70% to 80% of infected infants are born to mothers with no reported history of HSV infection.&lt;ref name="HollierWendel2008" /&gt;

Regions with low neonatal mortality include Europe, the Western Pacific, and the Americas, which have sepsis rates that account for 9.1% to 15.3% of the total neonatal deaths worldwide. This is in contrast with the 22.5 to 27.2% percentage of total deaths in resource-poor countries such as Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, India, Pakistan, and China.&lt;ref name="SantoshamChan2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Santosham |first1=Mathuram |last2=Chan |first2=Grace J. |last3=Lee |first3=Anne CC |last4=Baqui |first4=Abdullah H. |last5=Tan |first5=Jingwen |last6=Black |first6=Robert E. |title=Risk of Early-Onset Neonatal Infection with Maternal Infection or Colonization: A Global Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis |journal=PLoS Medicine |volume=10 |issue=8 |year=2013 |pages=e1001502 |issn=1549-1676 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001502 |pmid=23976885 |pmc=3747995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, the proportions of pregnant women who are newly screened positive for hepatitis B, syphilis, and HIV have remained constant since 2010 at about 0.4%, 0.14% and 0.15%, respectively. Estimated prevalence levels among pregnant women for hepatitis B and HIV, including previous diagnoses, were higher at 0.67% and 0.27%. Pregnant women evaluated as susceptible to rubella due to low antibody levels have increased by over 60%, to about 7.2%.  However, this increase is probably due to changes in testing methods and evaluation criteria.&lt;ref name="GB2014"&gt;{{cite report |title=Infection reports; HIV – STIs Antenatal screening for infectious diseases in England: summary report for 2014 |volume=9 |issue=43 |date=4 December 2015 |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/482642/hpr4315_ntntlscrng.pdf |website=Infection reports Volume 9 Number 43 Published on: 4 December 2015 HIV – STIs Antenatal screening for infectious diseases in England: summary report for 2014 |publisher=Public Health England |accessdate=8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In North America, prior to the 1950s, group A β-hemolytic streptococcus (GAS) was the most common pathogen associated with neonatal sepsis prior to the 1960s. In the past twenty years, the most common pathogen causing sepsis is coagulase-negative staphylococci that exist as biofilms associated with infected central venous or arterial catheters.&lt;ref name="MacDonald2015" /&gt; Infections can be fatal and contribute to long-term morbidity and disability among the infants who survive into childhood.&lt;ref name="MacDonald2015" /&gt; Neonatal sepsis effects 128 cases per 1000 live births.

Expectant mothers with HVS have a 75% chance of at least one flare-up during their pregnancy.&lt;ref name="HollierWendel2008" /&gt; In limited studies it was found that infants in Africa born to mothers with malaria have a 7% of acquiring congenital malaria.&lt;ref name="Martin2015" /&gt;

=== Early-onset infections ===

Early onset sepsis can occur in the first week of life. It usually is apparent on the first day after birth. This type of infection is usually acquired before the birth of the infant. [[Premature rupture of membranes]] and other [[Obstetric labor complication|obstetrical complications]] can add to the risk of early-onset sepsis. If the amniotic membrane has been ruptured greater than 18 hours before delivery the infant may be at more risk for this complication. Prematurity, low birth weight, chorioamnionitis, maternal urinary tract infection and/or maternal fever are complications that increase the risk for early-onset sepsis. Early onset sepsis is indicated by serious respiratory symptoms. The infant usually suffers from pneumonia, hypothermia, or shock. The mortality rate is 30 to 50%.&lt;ref name="Fanaroff2013" /&gt;

=== Late onset infections ===

Infections that occur after the first week of life but before the age of 30 days are considered late onset infections. Obstetrical and maternal complications are not typically the cause of these late onset infections; they are usually acquired by the infant in the hospital neonatal intensive care unit. The widespread use of broad-spectrum antibiotics in the nursery intensive care unit can cause a higher prevalence of invasive antibiotic resistant bacteria.&lt;ref name="Fanaroff2013" /&gt; Meconium aspiration syndrome has a mortality rate just over 4%. This accounts for 2% for all neonatal deaths.&lt;ref name="SiriwachirachaiSangkomkamhang2014" /&gt;

==Research==
The susceptibility to risk of infection and immune deficiencies are active areas of research. Studies regarding the role of viruses in neonatal infections are lacking. Research also continues into the role and protective effect of gut, skin and other human microbiomes and the colonization during the neonatal period.&lt;ref name="Pryhuber2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pryhuber |first1=Gloria S. |title=Postnatal Infections and Immunology Affecting Chronic Lung Disease of Prematurity |journal=Clinics in Perinatology |volume=42 |issue=4 |year=2015 |pages=697–718 |issn=0095-5108 |doi=10.1016/j.clp.2015.08.002 |postscript=; Access provided by the University of Pittsburgh. |pmid=26593074 |pmc=4660246}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fanaroff2013"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fanaroff |first=Avroy |title=Klaus &amp; Fanaroff's care of the high-risk neonate |publisher=Elsevier/Saunders |location=Philadelphia, PA |year=2013 |isbn=978-1-4160-4001-9 |postscript=; Access provided by the University of Pittsburgh.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The comparison between resource rich countries and resource poor countries makes it somewhat difficult to compare the diagnosis success since industrialized regions are able to confirm the diagnosis and presence of pathogens in the clinical laboratory. Clinical testing may not be available in all settings and clinicians must rely on the signs of infection in the newborn. Research data from Africa and Southeast Asia is scarce.&lt;ref name="SantoshamChan2013" /&gt;

The result of some research has been the identification of diagnostic tools and procedures that could identify mothers with group B streptococcus infection in resource-poor regions. These procedures would be easy and inexpensive to use. Those mothers who are identified as being infected could then be prophylactly treated prior to the birth of the baby.&lt;ref name="SantoshamChan2013" /&gt;

Probiotic administration of Lactobacillus species has shown some success.&lt;ref name="BaucellsMercadal Hally2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baucells |first1=B.J. |last2=Mercadal Hally |first2=M. |last3=Álvarez Sánchez |first3=A.T. |last4=Figueras Aloy |first4=J. |title=Asociaciones de probióticos para la prevención de la enterocolitis necrosante y la reducción de la sepsis tardía y la mortalidad neonatal en recién nacidos pretérmino de menos de 1.500g: una revisión sistemática |journal=Anales de Pediatría |volume=85 |issue=5 |pages=247–255 |year=2015 |issn=1695-4033 |doi=10.1016/j.anpedi.2015.07.038|pmid=26611880 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A GBS vaccine is currently being tested but not currently available. Vaccination is estimated to being able to prevent 4% of GBS infections for preterm births and 60–70% for neonatal GBS infections in the US. The projected benefits of maternal vaccination is the prevention of 899 cases of GBS disease and 35 deaths among infants. The  cost savings in the prevention of GBS may be over 43 million dollars. Vaccination may be especially beneficial in low to middle income countries where screening and prophylactic treatment is not possible. Analysts project that GBS vaccination would prevent 30–54% of infant GBS cases. Screening, prophylactic antibiotics and vaccine would prevent 48% of infection.&lt;ref name="CorteseScicchitano2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cortese|first1=Francesca|last2=Scicchitano|first2=Pietro|last3=Gesualdo|first3=Michele|last4=Filaninno|first4=Antonella|last5=De Giorgi|first5=Elsa|last6=Schettini|first6=Federico|last7=Laforgia|first7=Nicola|last8=Ciccone|first8=Marco Matteo|title=Early and Late Infections in Newborns: Where Do We Stand?

'''The Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000''' is a repealed statute of [[New South Wales]] (NSW). The Act was repealed by the ''[[Work Health and Safety Act 2011]]''.

The NSW Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000, No 40. (OHS Act) provides the rules and legislation to be abided by all workplaces, to ensure the health, safety and welfare of all persons at work in the state of [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]].

The full OHS Act 2000, including regulations, reviews and amendments can be found at the NSW Legislation website.&lt;ref name= legislation &gt;NSW Legislation OHS Act 2000 http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/fullhtml/inforce/act+40+2000+FIRST+0+N&lt;/ref&gt;

==Long title==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"An Act to secure the health, safety and welfare of persons at work; to repeal the Occupational Health and Safety Act 1983; and for other purposes."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Introduction==
The Act was agreed upon on 2 June 2000 and commenced on 1 September 2001. This Act replaced the previous OHS Act 1983 and contains new provisions that require employers to consult with employees on health, safety and welfare matters.&lt;ref name= legislation /&gt;
The OHS Act is implemented by [[WorkCover Authority of New South Wales|WorkCover NSW]], and applies to all workplaces in NSW, (except as otherwise stated in the Act). Through WorkCover, industry codes of practice are made under the OHS Act, which provide practical guidance and advice on how to achieve the standards required by the OHS Act and the Occupational Health and Safety Regulation 2001. The Minister responsible for the OHS Act, including the approval of the codes of practice is the Minister for Finances and Services. The Minister for Resources and Energy is responsible for sections of the Act that relate to coal or mining workplaces 
.&lt;ref&gt;WorkCover NSW http://www.une.edu.au/od/files/SummaryOHSAct2000.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 
The specific roles and functions of WorkCover are set out in the Workplace Injury Management and Workers Compensation Act 1998 
.&lt;ref&gt;NSW Legislation Workplace Injury Management and Workers Compensation Act 1998 No. 86 http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/maintop/view/inforce/act+86+1998+cd+0+N&lt;/ref&gt; WorkCover can also provide assistance, education, and advice on interpretation of guidelines and issuing of guidelines of the OHS Act and related Regulations.

==Objectives==

The objectives of the OHS Act are:&lt;ref name="legislation"/&gt;

*	to secure and promote the health, safety and welfare of people at work,
*	to protect people at a place of work against risks to health or safety,
*	to promote a safe and healthy work environment that protects workers from injury and illness and that is adapted to their physiological and psychological needs,
*	to provide for consultation and co-operation between employers and employees in achieving the objects of this Act,
*	to ensure that risks to health and safety at a place of work are identified, assessed and eliminated or controlled,
*	to develop and promote community awareness of occupational health and safety issues,
*	to provide a legislative framework that allows for progressively higher standards of occupational health and safety that take account of changes in technology and work practices,
*	to deal with the impact of particular classes or types of dangerous goods.

==Summary==

The Act provides:

*	General requirements for health, safety and welfare, which must be met by all places of work in NSW
*	Definitions of employees and employers, what classifies as a “risk” at work

==Legal Implementation of the OHS Act 2000==

Any breaches of the OHS Act and its Regulations may be dealt with in a court of Law. The OHS Act may also provide assistance to the Courts in making decisions regarding penalties. For example, in the Industrial Court of NSW, cases were heard regarding an incident at an Oil Seed extraction industry where a bin caught fire, causing explosions which led to the injury of workers and members of the fire brigade, including fatal burns.

Investigations were carried out by WorkCover Australia and prosecutions brought against the Oil Seed Company, Caines Pty Limited and Ors, and the [[NSW Fire Brigade]]. The Court found that the employer Caines Pty, the managers of this company and the NSW Fire Brigade had breached Sections 15(1) and 16(1) of the OHS Act and had failed to ensure the health, safety and welfare of their employees. Penalties were decided upon based on section 12 of the OHS Act. A full description of the cases and the outcomes can be found at LawLink NSW - The NSW Industrial Relations Commission Judicial Decisions website &lt;ref&gt;LawLink NSW http://www.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulations and related Legislation==

To date, only one Regulation has been made under the Act, The Occupational Health and Safety Regulation 2001.&lt;ref name="sydney.edu.au"&gt;The University of Sydney OHS website: http://sydney.edu.au/ohs/ohs_manual/legislation.shtml#2&lt;/ref&gt; This Regulation commenced on 1 September 2001 and applies to all places of work except where otherwise stated in the Regulation.&lt;ref name="legislation.nsw.gov.au"&gt;NSW Legislation OHS Regulation 2001 http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/fullhtml/inforce/subordleg+648+2001+FIRST+0+N&lt;/ref&gt; This Regulation consolidates previous Regulations, for example those related to Manual Handling and Hazardous substances.&lt;ref name="legislation.nsw.gov.au"/&gt;

The Regulation contains guidelines on risk management, workplace consultation, hazardous substances and processes, certification, licenses and permits, among other important matters.&lt;ref name="sydney.edu.au"/&gt;

There are many other associated legislation in NSW which also contain legal requirements regarding health and safety at work, including the Workers Compensation and Injury Management legislation, the Dangerous Goods Act 1975 and the Poisons and Therapeutic Goods Act 1966.&lt;ref name="sydney.edu.au"/&gt;

It was repealed by the [[Work Health and Safety Act 2011]] as of 1 January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/fullhtml/inforce/act+40+2000+FIRST+0+N&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paracelsianism''' (also ''Paracelsism''; German ''{{lang|de|Paracelsismus}}'') was an  [[early modern]] [[History of medicine|medical]] movement based on the theories and therapies of [[Paracelsus]]. 
It developed in the second half of the 16th century, during the decades following Paracelsus' death in 1541, and it flourished during the first half of the 17th century, representing one of the most comprehensive alternatives to [[learned medicine]], the traditional system of [[therapeutics]] derived from [[Galen]]ic [[physiology]]. 
Based on the principle of maintaining harmony between the [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]], Man; and [[Macrocosm and microcosm|macrocosm]], Nature.

Paracelsianism fell rapidly into decline in the later 17th century, but left its mark on medical practices; it was responsible for the widespread introduction of [[Mineral spa|mineral therapies]] and several other formerly [[esoteric]] techniques.

'''Phil Harvey''' (born April 25, 1938) is an American [[entrepreneur]], [[philanthropist]] and [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] who has set up large-scale programs that deliver subsidized [[contraceptives]] in poor countries. Harvey is the founder and former president of [[DKT International]], the [[Washington, D.C.]]-based charity that implements [[family planning]] and [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] prevention programs in 19 countries across [[Africa]], [[Asia]] and [[Latin America]]. He is the chief sponsor of the Liberty Project which raises awareness about [[freedom of speech]] issues in the U.S. Harvey is also the president of [[Adam &amp; Eve (business)|Adam &amp; Eve]], the [[North Carolina]]–based company that sells [[sex toys]], [[adult films]] and [[condoms]]. Consequently, he has been called "one of the most influential figures in the American [[sex industry]] today".&lt;ref name=Reefer&gt;{{cite book|title=Reefer madness: sex, drugs, and cheap labor in the American black market|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|author=Eric Schlosser|year=2004|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s4FeZmuBAqsC|isbn=0-618-44670-2|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over these years, Harvey has used profits from Adam &amp; Eve to supplement support from international donors to protect millions of poor couples from [[unwanted pregnancies]] and [[HIV]] infections. In 2013, [[DKT International]] provided 23.6 million couple years of protection (CYPs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dktinternational.org |title=DKT International Family Planning and HIV Prevention |publisher=Dktinternational.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Harvey was born in [[Evanston, Illinois]] to William Dow Harvey and Lucy Smith Harvey as the youngest of five siblings on April 25, 1938. He attended [[Harvard College]] from 1957 and received his bachelor's degree in 1961 in [[Slavic languages]] and literature. Between 1960 and 1962, he did his military service based in [[Ft. Meade]], Maryland, before joining the international charity [[CARE (relief agency)|CARE]] in 1963 to work in India. His five years' work with CARE on large-scale feeding programs for rapidly growing numbers of Indian children convinced Harvey of the importance of [[family planning]] and planted the first seeds in his mind of starting an initiative that could address the issue on a global scale.

Harvey returned to the U.S. in 1969 and enrolled in the [[University of North Carolina]]'s master's degree program in family planning administration. One of his classmates was Tim Black, a British physician (who went on to found [[Marie Stopes]] [[Marie Stopes International|International]], a large [[United Kingdom|British]] charity also focused on family planning services). Harvey and Black founded Population Services International in 1970 which today works in almost 70 countries with an annual budget of $683 million (2011). Harvey served as executive director of PSI from 1970 to 1977 and remained on the PSI Board until 2003.

He co-founded Population Services International (PSI) with Tim Black in 1970. He co-founded Adam &amp; Eve in 1972 and continues as its president. He founded [[DKT International]] in 1989 and stepped down as its president and chief executive on Dec. 31, 2013.

==Business and non-profit enterprises==
Harvey's operational philosophy is unique: it combines [[altruism]] with strong business models. Adam &amp; Eve is one of the largest sex product companies in the world. Harvey's share of profits from it support [[DKT International]] which sells low-priced [[contraceptives]] by using business channels that are found in every corner of the world, including in low-resource settings. Special projects, such as those with the military in [[Ethiopia]] (which obliges all soldiers to carry condoms when they leave the base) or with local medical practitioners in India who make a small profit selling condoms, extend and supplement this approach and ensure the products are widely available.

===History===
Harvey realized the potential of [[mail order]] when, at the University of North Carolina, he joined forces with Tim Black to begin selling condoms through the mail. Their efforts to expand the range of products led to the evolution of the sex products business: in Harvey's own words, "(w)e tried to get our customers to buy leisure wear, shipbuilding kits, belt buckles, model airplanes, but they just yawned at that stuff. Every time we put something with erotic appeal in the catalog, the bells would ring."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nerve.com / By Steve Almond |url=http://www.alternet.org/story/13650 |title=Sex Aid: Porn to Save the Third World |publisher=Alternet |date=2002-07-21 |accessdate=2014-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Profit from their mail-order business provided the funds to launch [[Population Services International]] in 1970.

Between 1977 and 2007, Harvey was involved in several legal battles with the U.S. and New York state governments in which he both challenged and defended himself against governments he believed were debasing First Amendment rights. As executive director of PSI in 1977, Harvey took on New York Governor Hugh Carey in a landmark reproductive health case that went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. In ''Carey vs. Population Services International'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/printer_friendly.pl?page=us/431/678.html|title=CAREY v. POPULATION SERVICES INTERNATIONAL|date=June 9, 1977|last=United States Supreme Court|authorlink=Supreme Court of the United States|website=Findlaw|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Court found unconstitutional, under the First and Fourteenth Amendments, the New York Education Law that made it a crime (1) for any person to sell or distribute any contraceptives to persons under 16; (2) for anyone other than a licensed pharmacist to distribute contraceptives to anyone; and (3) for anyone, including licensed pharmacists, to advertise or display contraceptives. The 1977 ruling, in combination with subsequent rulings, confirmed that the protection of rights and privacy are not limited to married adults. A syllabus of the 1977 ruling noted that New York State had "conceded that there is no evidence that teenage extramarital sexual activity increases in proportion to the availability of contraceptives."

In 1986, Adam and Eve's offices in Carrboro, North Carolina were raided by 37 armed local law enforcement agents. For the next six years, Harvey defended himself against multiple indictments for obscenity brought by the Reagan Administration's Department of Justice under Attorney General Edwin Meese. Ultimately, he prevailed in the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals in 1992 after initiating proactive litigation against the U.S. government. Harvey documented this story in his 2001 book "The Government vs. Erotica: The Siege of Adam &amp; Eve."
Wrote Nadine Strossen, then-president of the American Civil Liberties Union, in the foreword of "The Government vs. Erotica": "Phil Harvey not only survived the government's relentless efforts to bully him out of business, as it had done to other businesspeople who also sold constitutionally protected materials to adults who sought those materials. Even more inspiringly, Phil Harvey and his impressive legal team secured new legal precedents and prosecutorial policies that will protect other individuals and businesses from similar government harassment and oppression."

In 1987, while embroiled in the prosecutions of the Reagan Administration, Harvey challenged the U.S. government for its "[[Mexico City Policy]]", an on-again, off-again policy first enacted by President [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1984 which requires all non-governmental organizations (NGOs) receiving federal funding to refrain from performing or promoting abortion services as a method of family planning in other countries. In ''DKT Memorial Fund Ltd. vs. [[United States Agency for International Development|USAID]]'', Harvey and two foreign NGOs fought to have the Mexico City Policy overturned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=DKT Memorial Fund v. Agency for International Development, 13 February 1987 |journal=Annual Review of Population Law |year=1988 |issue=15 |page=43 f. |pmid=12346727}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit|DC Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals]] ruling contributed to the policy being used only against foreign NGOs, while not invoked against U.S. NGOs. The policy was removed by President Bill Clinton in 1993, re-imposed by George W. Bush in 2001 and removed again by Barack Obama in 2009.

In 1989, Harvey founded [[DKT International]], named for the late [[Deep Tyagi|D.K. Tyagi]], an early pioneer of family planning in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.motherjones.com/commentary/notebook/2002/11/ma_158_01.html|title=Mother Jones|work=Mother Jones|accessdate=4 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, DKT International refused to accept the U.S. government's policy that all NGOs receiving federal funds to fight AIDS or sex trafficking adopt an organization-wide policy opposing prostitution and sex trafficking. Harvey believed that the pledge was a form of coerced speech and that it would interfere with HIV prevention efforts. DKT challenged the pledge as a violation of First Amendment rights, with the support of the American Civil Liberties Union. Judge Emmet G. Sullivan ruled in favor of DKT in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in 2006, but the District of Columbia Court of Appeals reversed the decision the following year. The issue, through a separate case, was argued before the U.S. Supreme Court on April 22, 2013 and that Court, in a 6-2 decision, held that the requirement was an unconstitutional infringement of organizations' free speech rights. The policy is therefore null and void.

On December 31, 2013, Harvey stepped down as president of DKT after 24 years. He continues to serve DKT as chairman of the Board of Directors.

'''Registered Health Information Administrator''' ('''RHIA'''), previously known as Registered Record Administrator, is a professional certification administered by the [[American Health Information Management Association]] (AHIMA) in the [[United States]]. Passing the exam results in certification for [[health information management]].

==History==

At the time known as the American Medical Record Association (AMRA), AHIMA began offering the Registered Record Administrator (RRA) certification in the 1970s.  In 2000 AHIMA renamed the certification from RRA to Registered Health Information Administrator (RHIA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Flite|first1=Cathy|last2=Harman|first2=Laurinda|title=Code of Ethics: Principles for Ethical Leadership|journal=Perspectives in Health Information Management|date=Winter 2013|volume=10|pmc=3544144|pmid=23346028|pages=1d}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Davis /&gt;

==Roles==
The RHIA certification focuses on preparing members for careers in health information and medical records management, including management of the processes and systems that capture and report on health care-related data so that it can be used to evaluate care performance.&lt;ref name=Abdelhaki /&gt;  They design and manage health information systems to ensure they meet medical, legal, and ethical standards. Seeing that each patient's medical record is complete, kept confidential, and safeguarded from individuals not involved with the medical care of the patient are primary responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Health Information Administrator|url=http://www.mshealthcareers.com/careers/healthinfoadmin.htm|website=Mississippi Hospital Association Health Careers Center|publisher=Mississippi Hospital Association|accessdate=2015-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A RHIA certification is a preferred qualification for positions including Health Information Management Director, Clinical Documentation Improvement Professional (CDIP), and Registered Health Information Administrator.&lt;ref name=Davis /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Malec|first1=Brian|title=Careers in Health Information Technology|date=2015|publisher=Springer Publishing Company|location=New York City, NY|isbn=978-0-8261-2993-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RV2CBAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 a RHIA-certified professional in New York City would earn from $45,000 to $75,000 with a bachelor's degree, and up to $100,000 with a master's degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gibson|first1=Claudia|title=PROGNOSIS: JOB-HEAVY|url=https://nypost.com/2009/05/11/prognosis-job-heavy/|accessdate=2015-08-04|publisher=New York Post|date=2009-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===RHIA vs. RHIT===
AHIMA also offers a [[Registered Health Information Technician]] (RHIT) certification for coding professionals with two-year associate degrees and with less emphasis on management responsibilities. In 2005 researchers found that the differences in these certifications, in addition to other accreditations offered by AHIMA and the need for ongoing training, contributed to inconsistent medical record coding.&lt;ref name=nih&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Malley|first1=Kimberly|last2=Cook|first2=Karon|last3=Price|first3=Matt|last4=Wildes|first4=Kimberly|last5=Hurdle|first5=John|last6=Ashton|first6=Carol|title=Measuring Diagnoses: ICD Code Accuracy|journal=Health Services Research|date=October 2005|volume=40|pages=1620–1639|pmc=1361216|pmid=16178999|doi=10.1111/j.1475-6773.2005.00444.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Certification==
To be eligible for RHIA certification, an individual must complete a bachelor's degree in a health information management program accredited by the [[Commission on Accreditation for Health Informatics and Information Management Education]] (CAHIIM) or graduate from a foreign association that has a reciprocity agreement with AHIMA.&lt;ref name=Abdelhaki&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abdelhak|first1=Mervat|last2=Grostick|first2=Sara|last3=Hanken|first3=Mary Alice|title=Health Information: Management of a Strategic Resource|date=Dec 24, 2014|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=69X1BQAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=%22registered+health+information+administrator%22&amp;ots=XX0OULKKy8&amp;sig=T39tZxTdR_XbiKjTDtisTzoYTjU#v=onepage&amp;q=%22registered%20health%20information%20administrator%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=2015-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students focus on a core content area: technology, management development, clinical data management, performance improvement, external forces, clinical foundations, or privacy and security.&lt;ref name=Davis&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Nadinia|last2=LaCour|first2=Melissa|title=Health Information Technology|publisher=Elsevier Health Services|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=FrbwAwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=how+many+people+have+rhia+certification&amp;ots=aKfcT4H5sZ&amp;sig=IPXG8s0odq_bpMK0sFK7eEnryQM#v=onepage&amp;q=rhia&amp;f=false|accessdate=2015-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to industry demand for health information administrators, some programs began offering accelerated, CAHIIM-accredited postbaccalaureate certificates in health information administration in 2000 to allow experienced enrollees, such as former nurses or business analysts with [[Masters of Business Administration | Masters of Business Administration (MBA)]], to more quickly take the RHIA exam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Condon|first1=Jim|last2=Barefield|first2=Amanda|title=Assessment of Success on the RHIA Certification Examination: A Comparison of Baccalaureate Program Graduates and Postbaccalaureate Certificate Program Graduates|journal=Perspectives in Health Information Management|date=Fall 2012|volume=9|pmc=3510645|pmid=23209451|pages=1–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A temporary Proviso has been implemented by the CCHIIM that any Registered Health Information Technicians (RHIT) who meet the following eligibility requirements will be eligible to sit for the RHIA examination during the timeframe of July 1, 2017 through 2021:
* Have at least a baccalaureate degree from a regionally accedited institution or nationally recognized accreditor; and
* Have received their RHIT credential on or before August 31, 2018; and
* Have complied with the Standards for Maintenance of the RHIT credential.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ahima.org/certification/RHIA|title=Registered Health Information Administrator (RHIA)|website=www.ahima.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ongoing education===
Maintaining a RHIA certification requires 30 hours of continuing education units (CEUs) every two years. Of the 30 hours, 80% (or 24 hours) must be in one of the core content areas.&lt;ref name=Davis /&gt;

'''''The Discovery of the Unconscious: The History and Evolution of Dynamic Psychiatry''''' is a 1970 book by the Swiss medical historian [[Henri Ellenberger|Henri F. Ellenberger]]. In this study of the history of dynamic psychiatry,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Web05|Webster 2005]]. p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Ellenberger provides an account of the early history of psychology covering such figures as [[Franz Anton Mesmer]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Carl Jung]], [[Alfred Adler]], and [[Pierre Janet]]. The work has become a classic, and has been credited with demolishing the myth of Freud's originality and encouraging scholars to question the scientific validity of [[psychoanalysis]]. Critics have questioned the reliability of some of Ellenberger's judgments.

==Summary==
{{cleanup section||reason=Section is currently based on secondary sources discussing the work. It should be based principally on the book itself|date=June 2018}}
''The Discovery of the Unconscious'' is a study of the history of dynamic psychiatry that covers the early history of psychology and the work of Freud, Jung, Adler,&lt;ref name="Gay"&gt;[[#Gay95|Gay 1995]]. p. 754.&lt;/ref&gt; and Janet.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ree07|Reed 2007]]. p. 494.&lt;/ref&gt; Ellenberger's chapter on Adler uses unpublished materials, including "Kindheit und Jugend Alfred Adlers bis zum Kontakt mit Sigmund Freud", a manuscript by the Adler researcher  Hans Beckh-Widmanstetter.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gay95|Gay 1995]]. p. 760.&lt;/ref&gt; Ellenberger shows that Freud was dependent on earlier writers, especially Janet.&lt;ref name="Eysenck"&gt;[[#Eys86|Eysenck 1986]]. p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; He describes [[psychoanalysis]] and [[analytical psychology]] as forms of [[hermeneutics]] (the art or science of interpretation), comparing both disciplines to the philosophical schools of Graeco-Roman antiquity.&lt;ref name="Stevens"&gt;[[#Ste91|Stevens 1991]]. pp. 178, 267.&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud, according to Ellenberger, was heir to the Protestant ''Seelsorge'' or "Cure of Souls", a practice that arose after Protestant reformers abolished the ritual of confession. During the 19th century, the idea of unburdening oneself by confessing a shameful secret was gradually transferred from religion to medicine, influencing Mesmer's [[animal magnetism]], and eventually Freud.&lt;ref name="Webster"&gt;[[#Web05|Webster 2005]]. p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ellenberger argues that evaluating Freud's contributions to psychiatry is made difficult by a legend involving two main features that developed around Freud: the first being, "the theme of the solitary hero struggling against a host of enemies, suffering the 'slings and arrows of outrageous fortune' but triumphing in the end", and the second, "the blotting out of the greatest part of the scientific and cultural context in which psychoanalysis developed". The first aspect rested on exaggeration of the [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitism]] Freud encountered, as well as overstatement of the hostility of the academic world and the Victorian prejudices that hampered psychoanalysis. The second aspect led to Freud being credited with the achievements of others.&lt;ref name="Webster" /&gt;

==Influence and reception==
The psychoanalyst [[Joel Kovel]] wrote that ''The Discovery of the Unconscious'' "contains an elaborate survey of the history of psychoanalytic schools through the first half of the century", but while he considered the book "useful because of its encyclopaedic nature", he concluded that it has "little critical value or real historical analysis."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kov91|Kovel 1991]]. p. 349.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frank Sulloway]]'s ''[[Freud, Biologist of the Mind]]'' (1979) was partly inspired by ''The Discovery of the Unconscious''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wel94|Welsh 1994]]. p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; The psychologist [[Hans Eysenck]], writing in ''[[Decline and Fall of the Freudian Empire]]'' (1985), called ''The Discovery of the Unconscious'' a "classic" and an "excellent book which unveils many of the myths which have accumulated around Freud".&lt;ref name="Eysenck" /&gt;

The critic [[Frederick Crews]] considered ''The Discovery of the Unconscious'' part of a body of research demonstrating that Freud "was misled by his drive toward heroic fame." Crews wrote that the Ellenberger reveals "the derivative and curiously atavistic position of psychoanalysis in nineteenth century psychiatry", adding that "No one who ponders the entirety of Ellenberger's subtly ironic narrative can fail to come away with a sense that psychoanalysis was a high-handed improvisation on Freud's part."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cre86|Crews 1986]]. p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; Crews also credited Ellenberger with a biographical understanding of Freud that "set a standard that contemporary scholars are still trying to match",&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cre96|Crews 1996]]. p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt; and with demolishing the myth of Freud's originality and encouraging subsequent scholars to question the scientific validity of psychoanalysis.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cre96|Crews 1996]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian [[Peter Gay]] described ''The Discovery of the Unconscious'' as useful despite Ellenberger's lack of sympathy for Freud.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gay86|Gay 1986]], p. 459.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in ''[[Freud: A Life for Our Time]]'' (1988), Gay called the book "a rather swollen but thoroughly researched nine-hundred-page volume, with long chapters on the early history of psychology, and on Jung, Adler, and Freud." Gay added that, "Though far from elegant, though opinionated and not always reliable in its quick judgments (such as its verdict that Freud was the quintessential Viennese), it is a rich source of information." Gay commented that Ellenberger's book is far more comprehensive than [[Lancelot Law Whyte]]'s ''[[The Unconscious Before Freud]]'' (1960).&lt;ref name="Gay" /&gt;

The psychiatrist [[Anthony Stevens (Jungian analyst)|Anthony Stevens]] made use of Ellenberger's concept of "creative illness", a rare condition whose onset usually occurs after a long period of intense intellectual work, in his account of Jung.&lt;ref name="Stevens" /&gt; The historian Paul Robinson described Ellenberger's chapter on Freud as "irreverent", writing that Ellenberger's book paved the way for much of the criticism of Freud that followed in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rob93|Robinson 1993]]. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The historian of science Roger Smith called ''The Discovery of the Unconscious'' "a magisterial - and readable - historical study".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smi97|Smith 1997. p. 988.]]&lt;/ref&gt; The psychologist [[Louis Breger]] wrote that ''The Discovery of the Unconscious'' is "extremely valuable", and that Ellenberger places Freud's work in context as well as providing illuminating discussions of Adler, Jung, and Janet.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bre00|Breger 2000]]. p. 384.&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher [[Mikkel Borch-Jacobsen]] and the psychologist [[Sonu Shamdasani]] called the book a "monumental work".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bor12|Borch-Jacobsen 2012]]. p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vocational rehabilitation''', also abbreviated '''VR''' or '''voc rehab''', is a process which enables persons with functional, psychological, developmental, cognitive, and emotional disabilities or impairments or health disabilities to overcome barriers to  accessing, maintaining, or returning to employment or other useful occupation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vocational Rehabilitation Association of the UK|url=http://www.vra-uk.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vocational rehabilitation can require input from a range of health care professionals and other non-medical disciplines such as disability employment advisers and [[Career counseling|career counselors]].  Techniques used can include:
* assessment, appraisal, program evaluation, and research.
* goal setting and intervention planning.
* provision of health advice and promotion, in support of returning to work.
* support for self-management of health conditions.
* making adjustments to the medical and psychological impact of a disability.
* [[Medical case management|case management]], referral, and service co-ordination.
* [[psychosocial]] interventions.

[[File:Vinbudin.JPG|thumb|right|Inside a Reykjavik Vínbúð]]
'''Vínbúð''' ({{IPA-is|ˈviːn.puð}}, ''wine shop'') is a chain of 46 stores run by the [[Iceland]]ic [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] and [[tobacco]] [[monopoly]] [[ÁTVR]], locally called '''ríkið''' ({{IPA-is|ˈriːkɪð|lang}}, ''the State''). It is Iceland's [[Alcohol monopoly|sole legal vendor of alcohol]] for off-premises consumption, though in practice, most bars and restaurants will not prevent you from leaving with purchased drinks. High licensing fees make this an expensive option however, and alcohol is always at least twice as expensive outside the Vínbúð.

Iceland has very high [[tax]]es on alcohol. Historically, this was to curtail consumption. Tax rates in stores are not a percentage of price (such as a [[sales tax]] or income tax) but are proportionate to the alcohol content.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="246444">[[Well-being]] is a much-studied topic in psychology, especially [[positive psychology]]. Related concepts are [[eudaimonia]], [[happiness]], [[flourishing]], [[quality of life]], [[contentment]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graham|first1=Michael C.|title=Facts of Life: ten issues of contentment|date=2014|publisher=Outskirts Press|isbn=978-1-4787-2259-5|pages=6–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[meaningful life]].
{{TOC limit|2}}

== Theories ==
Central theories are [[Ed Diener|Diener's]] [[tripartite model of subjective well-being]], [[Carol Ryff|Ryff's]] [[Six-factor Model of Psychological Well-being]], [[Corey Keyes|Corey Keyes']] work on [[flourishing]], and [[Martin Seligman|Seligman]]'s contributions to [[positive psychology]] and his theories on ''authentic happiness'' and [[Martin Seligman#PERMA|P.E.R.M.A.]]

Positive psychology is concerned with [[eudaimonia]], "the good life" or [[flourishing]], living according to what holds the greatest value in life – the factors that contribute the most to a well-lived and fulfilling life. While not attempting a strict definition of the good life, positive psychologists agree that one must live a [[Happiness|happy]], engaged, and meaningful life in order to experience "the good life". [[Martin Seligman]] referred to "the good life" as "using your signature strengths every day to produce authentic happiness and abundant gratification".&lt;ref&gt;Seligman, M.E.P. (2009). Authentic Happiness. New York: Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Christopher Peterson (psychologist)|Christopher Peterson]], "eudaimonia trumps hedonism".&lt;ref name="Peterson2008"&gt;Christopher Peterson (2008), [https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-good-life/200805/what-is-positive-psychology-and-what-is-it-not ''What Is Positive Psychology, and What Is It Not?'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Research on positive psychology, well-being, eudaimonia and happiness, and the theories of Diener, Ryff, Keyes and Seligmann cover a broad range of levels and topics, including "the biological, personal, relational, institutional, cultural, and global dimensions of life."{{sfn|Seligman|Csikszentmihalyi|2000}}

The pursuit&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;http://thriving.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/Catalino - Prioritizing Positivity (Simon-Thomas Lecture).pdf&lt;/ref&gt; of happiness predicts both positive emotions and less depressive symptoms. People&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; who prioritize happiness are more psychologically able, all else held equal.

== Methodology of study ==

=== Well-being measurement ===
Different ways of measuring well-being reveal different contributing factors. The correlation between two of these, life satisfaction and happiness, in the World Values Survey (1981–2005) is only 0.47.&lt;ref name="internationaljournalofwellbeing.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://internationaljournalofwellbeing.org/index.php/ijow/article/viewFile/364/477 |title=A statistical meta-analysis of the wellbeing literature |website=internationaljournalofwellbeing.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are different, but related concepts which are used interchangeably outside of academia. Typically, life satisfaction, or evaluative wellbeing is measured with Cantril’s self-anchoring ladder, a questionnaire where wellbeing is rated on a scale from 1–10. Happiness or hedonic/Affective well-being measurement is measured with the positive and negative affect schedule (PANAS), a more complex scale.

=== Limitations ===
The UK Government's Department of Health compiled a factsheet in 2014, in which it is stated that the key limitations to well-being, quality of life and life satisfaction research are that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wellbeing-and-health-policy|title=Wellbeing and health policy - GOV.UK|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* There are numerous associations and correlations in the body of evidence, but few causal relationships, since existing longitudinal datasets "''do not use consistent wellbeing and predictor measures at different time points''";
* After controlling for mental health status, not many of the found associations are still significant;
* Subgroup analyses are rare;
* There are too few studies to conduct meta-analyses;
* There are too few interventional studies.

== Major factors ==

=== For evaluative well-being (life satisfaction) ===
Mental health is the strongest&lt;ref&gt;[http://cep.lse.ac.uk/_new/research/wellbeing/causes_and_effects_of_wellbeing.as ]{{dead link|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; individual predictor of life satisfaction. Mental illness is associated&lt;ref name=pmid26321990&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Garaigordobil M | title = Predictor variables of happiness and its connection with risk and protective factors for health | journal = Frontiers in Psychology | volume = 6 | pages = 1176 | year = 2015 | pmid = 26321990 | doi = 10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01176 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with poorer well-being. In fact, mental health is the strongest determinant of quality of life at a later age.

Studies&lt;ref name=pmid10784456&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mendlowicz MV, Stein MB | title = Quality of life in individuals with anxiety disorders | journal = The American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 157 | issue = 5 | pages = 669–82 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10784456 | doi = 10.1176/appi.ajp.157.5.669 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have documented the relationship between anxiety and quality of life.

The VOXEU&lt;ref name="voxeu1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voxeu.org/article/origins-happiness|title=Origins of happiness: Evidence and policy implications|first1=Andrew|last1=Clark|first2=Sarah|last2=Fleche|first3=Richard|last3=Layard|first4=Nattavudh|last4=Powdthavee|first5=George|last5=Ward | name-list-format = vanc |date=12 December 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; analysis of happiness showed the principal determinants of an adult’s life satisfaction to be income, parenting, family break up, mother's mental health and schooling.
The factors that explain life satisfaction roughly map (negatively) to those factors that explain misery. They are first and foremost diagnosed depression/anxiety, which explains twice as much as the next factor, physical health (number of medical conditions), that explains just as much variance in subjective well-being between people, as income and whether someone is partnered.
These factors count twice as much as each of whether someone is employed and whether they are a non-criminal, which in turn are 3 times as important as years of education.

Overall, the best predictor of an adult's life satisfaction is their emotional health as a child as reported by the mother and child. It trumps factors like the qualifications that someone gets and their behaviour at 16 as reported by the mother. A child and therefore an adult's emotional health is most affected itself by a mother's mental health, which is just over twice as important as family income.
2/3 as important as family income is parent's involvement, which is 0.1 partial correlation coefficients more important than aggressive parenting (negative), father's unemployment (negative), family conflict (negative) and whether the mother worked in the subject's 1st year of life.

Whether the mother worked thereafter has 0 correlation with well-being, however. In terms of non-family factors, the place where someone goes to secondary school matters a fair bit more than observed family background altogether, which in turn is slightly more important than the place where someone went to primary school.

=== For affective well-being (happiness) ===

The main determinants of affective well-being, by correlation and effect size are:&lt;ref name="internationaljournalofwellbeing.org"/&gt;

# Corruption index (-0.54)
# Public service quality (0.40)
# GDP per capita (although, there is evidence of publication bias) (0.39)
# Economic freedom (0.35)
# Human rights violations (-0.33)
# Political and economic violence (-0.28)
# Life expectancy at birth (0.27)
# Unemployment (0.19)
# Are you married (0.07)

Determinants that correlate highly with one another, for instance, alternative ways of measuring corruption, are excluded from this list.

== Biological factors ==

=== Gender ===
Over the last 33 years, a significant decrease in women's happiness leads researchers to believe that men are happier than women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stevenson |first=B. |last2=Wolfers |first2=J. |year=2009|title=The paradox of declining female happiness |journal=American Economic Journal: Economic Policy |volume= 1 |issue=2 |pages=190–225. |doi=10.1257/pol.1.2.190 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, a Pew Research Centre survey found that more women are satisfied with their lives than men, overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://science.howstuffworks.com/life/men-or-women-happier.htm|title=Are men or women happier?|date=20 May 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research has found no gender gap in happiness.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Happiness Inequality in the United States |first1=Betsey |last1=Stevenson |first2=Justin |last2=Wolfers |year=2008 |journal=[[Journal of Legal Studies]] |volume=37 |issue=S2 |pages=S33–S79 |doi=10.1086/592004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of these findings could be due to the way men and women differ in calculating their happiness. Women calculate the positive self-esteem, closeness in their relationships and religion. Men calculate positive self-esteem, active leisure and mental control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reid | first1 = A. | year = 2004 | title = Gender and sources of subjective well-being | url = | journal = Sex Roles | volume = 51 | issue = 11/12| pages = 617–629 | doi = 10.1007/s11199-004-0714-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, neither men nor women are at greater risk for being less happy than the other. Earlier in life, women are more likely than men to fulfill their goals (material goals and family life aspirations), thereby increasing their [[life satisfaction]] and overall happiness. However, it is later in life that men fulfill their goals, are more satisfied with their family life and financial situation and, as a result, their overall happiness surpasses that of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Plagnol A, Easterlin R |title=Aspirations, attainments, and satisfaction: life cycle differences between American women and men |journal=Journal of Happiness Studies |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=601–619 |year=2008 |doi=10.1007/s10902-008-9106-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Possible explanations include the unequal division of labor within the household,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mencarini L, Sironi M |title=Happiness, Housework and Gender Inequality in Europe |journal=European Sociological Review |volume=0 |issue=2 |pages=1–17 |year=2010 |doi=10.1093/esr/jcq059 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or that women experience more variance (more extremes) in emotion but are ''generally'' happier.&lt;ref name="EcoAgeHap" /&gt; Effects of gender on well-being are paradoxical: men report feeling less happy than women,{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} however, women are more susceptible to depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Strickland B |title=Women and depression |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=132–5 |year=1992 |jstor=20182155 |doi=10.1111/1467-8721.ep10769766}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study was conducted by Siamak Khodarahimi to determine the roles of gender and age on positive psychology constructs – psychological hardiness, emotional intelligence, self-efficacy and happiness – among 200 Iranian adolescents and 200 young adults who were questioned through various tests. The study found that the males of the sample showed significantly higher rates in psychological hardiness, emotional intelligence, self-efficacy and happiness than females, regardless of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Khodarahimi|first1=Siamak | name-list-format = vanc |title=The Role of Gender on Positive Psychology Constructs in a Sample of Iranian Adolescents and Young adults|journal=Applied Research in Quality of Life|date=5 February 2013|volume=9|issue=1|pages=45–61|doi=10.1007/s11482-013-9212-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Determining whether emotions have a genetic trait or not were studied by David Lykken and Auke Tellegen. They found that up to 80% of a long-term sense of [[well-being]] is due to heredity. Basically, our families are important to our eventual emotional lives as adults because they provide us with genetic material that largely determines our base [[emotional]] responsiveness to the world. Therefore, [[genetics|genetic]] makeup is far more important to the long-term quality of our emotional lives than is learned behavior or the quality of our early childhood environment, at least as found in our current socio-economic paradigm.&lt;ref name="Lykken"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lykken D, Tellegen A | year = 1996 | title = Happiness is a stochastic phenomenon | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 7 | issue = 3| pages = 186–189 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.1996.tb00355.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining theoretical 20%, however, still leaves room for significant change in thoughts and behavior from environmental/learned sources that should not be understated, and the interpretation of variance in twin studies is controversial, even among clinical psychologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://vaughanbell.net/nature-vs-nurture-is-a-lie/ |title= Nature vs nurture is a lie | last1 = Bell | first1 = Vaughan | name-list-format = vanc | journal = The Psychologist | date = July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual differences in both overall Eudaimonia, identified loosely with [[self-control]], and in the facets of eudaimonia are inheritable. Evidence from one study supports 5 independent genetic mechanisms underlying the Ryff facets of this trait, leading to a genetic construct of eudaimonia in terms of general self-control, and four subsidiary biological mechanisms enabling the psychological capabilities of purpose, agency, growth, and positive social relations.&lt;ref name="pmid22432931"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Archontaki D, Lewis GJ, Bates TC | title = Genetic influences on psychological well-being: a nationally representative twin study | journal = Journal of Personality | volume = 81 | issue = 2 | pages = 221–30 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 22432931 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-6494.2012.00787.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neurology===
It is generally accepted that happiness is at least in part mediated through [[dopaminergic]], [[adrenergic]] and [[serotonergic]] metabolism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dfarhud D, Malmir M, Khanahmadi M | title = Happiness &amp; Health: The Biological Factors- Systematic Review Article | journal = Iranian Journal of Public Health | volume = 43 | issue = 11 | pages = 1468–77 | date = November 2014 | pmid = 26060713 | pmc = 4449495 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A correlation has been found between [[hormone]] levels and happiness. [[SSRI]]s, such as Prozac, are used to adjust the levels of [[serotonin]] in the [[Major depressive disorder|clinically unhappy]]. Researchers, such as [[Bruce K. Alexander|Alexander]], have indicated that many peoples usage of narcotics may be the unwitting result of attempts to readjust hormone levels to cope with situations that make them unhappy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alexander |first1=Bruce K. | title=Rat Park |journal=Psychopharmacology |year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A positive relationship has been found between the volume of gray matter in the right [[precuneus]] area of the brain and the subject's subjective happiness score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sato W, Kochiyama T, Uono S, Kubota Y, Sawada R, Yoshimura S, Toichi M | title = The structural neural substrate of subjective happiness | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 5 | issue =  | pages = 16891 | date = November 2015 | pmid = 26586449 | pmc = 4653620 | doi = 10.1038/srep16891 | bibcode = 2015NatSR...516891S }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Meditation]] based interventions, including [[mindfulness]], have been found to correlate with a significant gray matter increase within the [[precuneus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kurth F, Luders E, Wu B, Black DS | title = Brain Gray Matter Changes Associated with Mindfulness Meditation in Older Adults: An Exploratory Pilot Study using Voxel-based Morphometry | journal = Neuro | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 23–26 | year = 2014 | pmid = 25632405 | pmc = 4306280 | doi = 10.17140/NOJ-1-106 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hölzel BK, Carmody J, Vangel M, Congleton C, Yerramsetti SM, Gard T, Lazar SW | title = Mindfulness practice leads to increases in regional brain gray matter density | journal = Psychiatry Research | volume = 191 | issue = 1 | pages = 36–43 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 21071182 | pmc = 3004979 | doi = 10.1016/j.pscychresns.2010.08.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kurth F, MacKenzie-Graham A, Toga AW, Luders E | title = Shifting brain asymmetry: the link between meditation and structural lateralization | journal = Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 55–61 | date = January 2015 | pmid = 24643652 | pmc = 4994843 | doi = 10.1093/scan/nsu029 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fox KC, Nijeboer S, Dixon ML, Floman JL, Ellamil M, Rumak SP, Sedlmeier P, Christoff K | title = Is meditation associated with altered brain structure?

=== Neuroscience's findings ===
[[Neuroscience]] and brain imaging have shown increasing potential for helping science understand happiness and sadness. Though it may be impossible to achieve any comprehensive objective measure of happiness, some physiological correlates to happiness can be measured. [[Stefan Klein]], in his book ''The Science of Happiness'', links the dynamics of [[Neurobiology|neurobiological]] systems (i.e., dopaminergic, opiate) to the concepts and findings of positive psychology and social psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Stefan | last = Klein | authorlink = Stefan Klein | title = The Science of Happiness | publisher = Marlowe &amp; Company | year = 2006 | isbn = 1-56924-328-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nobel prize]] winner [[Eric Kandel]] and researcher Cynthia Fu described very accurate diagnoses of [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] just by looking at fMRI brain scans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wnyc.org/shows/radiolab/episodes/2008/12/05 |title=Diagnosis – Radiolab |publisher=Wnyc.org |access-date=2011-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By identifying [[neural correlate]]s for [[emotions]], scientists may be able to use methods like [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|brain scans]] to tell us more about the different ways of being "happy". Richard Davidson has conducted research to determine which parts of the brain are involved in [[positive emotions]]. He found that the left prefrontal [[cortex (anatomy)|cortex]] is more activated when we are happy and is also associated with greater ability to recover from negative [[emotion]]s as well as enhanced ability to suppress negative emotions. Davidson found that people can train themselves to increase activation in this area of their brains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Luz A, Dunne J, Davidson R | year = 2007 | chapter = Meditation and the neuroscience of consciousness | veditors = In Zelazo P, Moscovitch M, Thompson E | title = Cambridge Handbook of Consciousness | publisher = Cambridge University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that our [[brain]] can change throughout our lives as a result of our experiences; this is known as [[neuroplasticity]].

The evolutionary perspective offers an alternative approach to understanding happiness and quality of life. Key guiding questions are: What features are included in the brain that allow humans to distinguish between positive and negative states of mind? How do these features improve humans' ability to survive and reproduce? The evolutionary perspective claims that the answers to these questions point towards an understanding of what happiness is about and how to best exploit the capacities of the brain with which humans are endowed. This perspective is presented formally and in detail by the evolutionary biologist [[Bjørn Grinde]] in his book ''[[Darwinian Happiness]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Grinde | first = Bjørn | name-list-format = vanc | year = 2002 | title = Happiness in the perspective of evolutionary psychology | journal = Journal of Happiness Studies | volume = 3 | pages = 331–354 | doi = 10.1023/A:1021894227295 | issue = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal factors ==

=== In relation with age ===

==== In adolescence ====
There has been a significant focus in past research on adulthood, in regards to well-being and development and although eudaimonia is not a new field of study, there has been little research done in the areas of adolescence and youth. Research that has been done on this age group had previously explored more negative aspects than well-being, such as problem and risk behaviours (i.e. drug and alcohol use).

Researchers who conducted a study in 2013 recognized the absence of adolescents in eudaimonic research and the importance of this developmental stage. Adolescents rapidly face cognitive, social and physical changes, making them prime subjects to study for development and well-being. The ''eudaimonic identity theory'' was used in their research to examine the development of identity through self-discovery and self-realization. They emphasize the personal value found in discovering and appeasing one's “''daimon''” ([[Daemon (classical mythology)|daemon]]) through subjective experiences that develop eudaimonic happiness from aligning with one's true self.&lt;ref name = "Coatsworth_2013"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Coatsworth JD, Sharp EH | title = The best within us: Positive psychology perspectives on eudaimonia | date = 2013 | publisher = American Psychological Association | location  = Washington, DC }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|250}}

Researchers focused their studies on PYD ([[positive youth development]]) and the ''eudaimonic identity theory'' in the context of three developmental elements: ''self-defining activities'', ''personal expressiveness'' and ''goal-directed behaviours''.

They determined that adolescents sample multiple ''self-defining activities''; these activities aid in identity formation, as individuals choose activities that they believe represents who they are. These ''self-defining activities'' also help determine the adolescent's social environments. For example, an adolescent involved in sports, would likely surround themselves with like-minded active and competitive people.

''Personal expressiveness'', as coined by psychologist A. S. Waterman, are the activities that we choose to express and connect with our “''daimon''” through subjective experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Waterman AS |title=Two conceptions of happiness: Contrasts of personal expressiveness (eudaimonia) and hedonic enjoyment|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1993|volume=64|issue=4|pages=678–691|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.64.4.678}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, ''goal-directed behaviours'', are developed through goal setting, where individuals work towards identity establishment. Adolescents recognize their passions, abilities and talents and aim to fulfill their goals and behave in a way that appeases their true self.&lt;ref name = "Coatsworth_2013" /&gt;{{rp|251}}

The study on adolescents was conducted in Italy, Chile and the United States, which produced slightly varied outcomes. Outcomes were contingent on availability, access and choice of opportunities (activities).&lt;ref name = "Coatsworth_2013" /&gt;{{rp|254}} Socioeconomic context also affected the results, as not all individuals could access the activities that may be more in-line with their true selves.

The Personally Expressive Activities Questionnaire (PEAQ) was used to conduct the study. Adolescence was the youngest age group that the PEAQ was used on. The PEAQ asked adolescents to self-report on activities they participate in and describe themselves with ''self-defining activities''.&lt;ref name = "Coatsworth_2013" /&gt;{{rp|260}} It was reported that 80% of adolescents defined themselves with two to four ''self-defining activities'' signifying an understanding in adolescence of self-concept through the domains of leisure, work and academia.&lt;ref name = "Coatsworth_2013" /&gt;{{rp|255}}

Leisure activities were found to have the largest impact on individuals because these activities were the most self-directed of the three domains, as adolescents had the choice of activity, and were more likely to be able to align it with their true selves. The study found that subjective experiences were more important than the activities themselves and that adolescents reported higher levels of well-being. They reported that when adolescents express themselves through ''self-defining activities'' across multiple domains, they have a clearer image of themselves, of what they want to achieve and higher wellness. ''Goal-setting'' was found to be a unique predictor; when adolescents work towards goals set by themselves and accomplish them, they are likely to have a clearer emerging identity and higher well-being. Researchers found that more adolescents were happy when they were involved in self-chosen activities because the activities were chosen in line with their true self.&lt;ref name = "Coatsworth_2013" /&gt;{{rp|257–259}}

==== In midlife ====
The [[midlife crisis]] may mark the first reliable drop in happiness during an average human's life. Evidence suggests most people generally become happier with age, with the exception of the years 40 – 50, which is the typical age at which a ''crisis'' might occur. Researchers specify that people in both their 20s and 70s are happier than during midlife, although the extent of happiness changes at different rates. For example, feelings of stress and anger tend to decline after age 20, worrying drops after age 50, and enjoyment very slowly declines in adulthood but finally starts to rise after age 50.&lt;ref name=NYSciHap/&gt;&lt;ref name=GuardianHappiness&gt;{{cite news|last=Bakalar |first=Nicholas | name-list-format = vanc |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/01/health/research/01happy.html?_r=1 |title=The Guardian, Happiness May Come With Age, Study Says.

Well-being in late life is more likely to be related to other contextual factors including proximity to death.&lt;ref name=pmid18605841&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gerstorf D, Ram N, Estabrook R, Schupp J, Wagner GG, Lindenberger U | title = Life satisfaction shows terminal decline in old age: longitudinal evidence from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP) | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 44 | issue = 4 | pages = 1148–59 | date = July 2008 | pmid = 18605841 | pmc = 3551350 | doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.44.4.1148 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid18361663&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gerstorf D, Ram N, Röcke C, Lindenberger U, Smith J | title = Decline in life satisfaction in old age: longitudinal evidence for links to distance-to-death | journal = Psychology and Aging | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 154–68 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18361663 | pmc = 3482430 | doi = 10.1037/0882-7974.23.1.154 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However most of this terminal decline in well-being could be attributed to other changes in age-normative functional declines including physical health and function.&lt;ref name=pmid24660795&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Burns RA, Mitchell P, Shaw J, Anstey KJ | title = Trajectories of terminal decline in the well-being of older women: the DYNOPTA project | journal = Psychology and Aging | volume = 29 | issue = 1 | pages = 44–56 | date = March 2014 | pmid = 24660795 | doi = 10.1037/a0035370 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, there is growing debate that assumptions that a single population estimate of age-related changes in well-being truly reflects the lived experiences of older adults has been questioned. The use of growth mixture modelling frameworks has allowed researchers to identify homogenous groups of individuals who are more similar to each other than the population based on their level and change in well-being and has shown that most report stable well-being in their late life and in the decade prior to death.&lt;ref name=pmid25108532&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Burns RA, Byles J, Magliano DJ, Mitchell P, Anstey KJ | title = The utility of estimating population-level trajectories of terminal wellbeing decline within a growth mixture modelling framework | journal = Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology | volume = 50 | issue = 3 | pages = 479–87 | date = March 2015 | pmid = 25108532 | doi = 10.1007/s00127-014-0948-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings are based on decades of data, and control for cohort groups; the data avoids the risk that the drops in happiness during midlife are due to populations' unique midlife experiences, like a war. The studies have also controlled for income, job status and parenting (as opposed to [[childlessness]]) to try to isolate the effects of age.

Researchers found support for the notion of age changes inside the individual that affect happiness.
This could be for any number of reasons. Psychological factors could include greater awareness of one's self and preferences; an ability to control desires and have more realistic expectations – unrealistic expectations tend to foster unhappiness; moving closer to death may motivate people to pursue personal goals; improved social skills, like forgiveness, may take years to develop – the practice of forgiveness seems linked to higher levels of happiness; or happier people may live longer and are slightly overrepresented in the elderly population. Age-related chemical changes might also play a role.&lt;ref name=GuardianHappiness/&gt;&lt;ref name=GuardAge/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite news|last=Bakalar |first=Nicholas  | name-list-format = vanc |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/01/health/research/01happy.html?_r=1 |title=The Guardian, Happiness May Come With Age, Study Says |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2010-05-31 |access-date=2011-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EcoAgeHap&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/17722567 |title=Age and happiness: The U-bend of life|publisher=The Economist |date=2010-12-16 |access-date=2011-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other studies have found older individuals reported more health problems, but fewer problems overall. Young adults reported more anger, anxiety, depression, financial problems, troubled relationships and career stress. Researchers also suggest depression in the elderly is often due largely to passivity and inaction – they recommend people continue to undertake activities that bring happiness, even in old age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The activity restriction model of depressed affect suggests that stressors that disrupt traditional activities of daily life can lead to a decrease in mental health. The elderly population is vulnerable to activity restriction because of the disabling factors related to age. Increases in scheduled activity as well as social support can decrease the chances of activity restriction.&lt;ref&gt;Lopez, S. J., Snyder, C. R. "The Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology". Oxford University Press, 2009. p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In relation with depression and languishing ===
A study by Keyes found that there are major costs of depression, which 14% of adults experience annually: it impairs social roles; it costs billions each year due to work absenteeism, diminished [[productivity]], and [[healthcare]] costs; finally, depression accounts for at least one-third of [[suicides]]. Therefore, it is important to study flourishing to learn about what is possible if issues such as depression are tackled and how the ramifications of focusing on the positive make life better not just for one person, but also for others around them.&lt;ref name = "Keyes_2002" /&gt;

Flourishing has significant positive aspects magnified when compared to languishing adults and when languishing adults are compared to depressed adults, as explained by Keyes. For example, languishing adults have the same amount of chronic [[disease]] as those that are depressed whereas flourishing adults are in exceptionally better [[physical health]]. Languishing adults miss as many days at work as depressed adults and, in fact, visit [[Physician|doctors]] and [[therapists]] more than depressed adults.&lt;ref name="(2001).

==== Positive psychology interventions (PPI) in patients ====
A [[Strength-based practice|strengths-based approach]] to personal positive change aims to have clinical psychology place an equal weight on both positive and negative functioning when attempting to understand and treat distress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Duckworth AL, Steen TA, Seligman ME | title = Positive psychology in clinical practice | journal = Annual Review of Clinical Psychology | volume = 1 | issue =  | pages = 629–51 | year = 2005 | pmid = 17716102 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.1.102803.144154 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This rationale is based on empirical findings. Because positive characteristics interact with negative life events to predict disorder the exclusive study of negative life events could produce misleading results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cohen LH, McGowan J, Fooskas S, Rose S | title = Positive life events and social support and the relationship between life stress and psychological disorder | journal = American Journal of Community Psychology | volume = 12 | issue = 5 | pages = 567–87 | date = October 1984 | pmid = 6496413 | doi = 10.1007/BF00897213 | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/n2527h6pr72571x1/ | doi-broken-date = 2018-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, psychologists are looking to use positive psychology to treat patients. Amy Krentzman, among the others, discussed positive intervention as a way to treat patients. She defined positive intervention as a therapy or activity primarily aimed at increasing positive feelings, positive behaviors, or positive cognitions, as opposed to focusing on negative thoughts or dysfunctional behaviors. A way of using positive intervention as a clinical treatment is to use positive activity interventions. Positive activity interventions, or PAIs, are brief self-administered exercises that promote positive feelings, thoughts, and behaviors. Two widely used PAIs are “Three Good Things” and “Best Future Self.” “Three Good Things” requires a patient to daily document, for a week, three events that went well during the day, and the respective cause, or causes (this exercise can be modified with counterfactual thinking, that is, adding the imagination of things had them been worse&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?dq=gratitude+counterfactual&amp;ei=YB2eVeC2I8Ll8AXNjYfoCA&amp;hl=en&amp;id=Qz4nhZ3ZMmgC&amp;lpg=PA332&amp;ots=CGH8m_Ee_j&amp;pg=PA332&amp;sa=X&amp;sig=pSTwZDyMo3_feDWFMeADTsaiWDY&amp;source=bl&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA|title=The Psychology of Gratitude|first1=Robert A.|last1=Emmons|first2=Michael E.|last2=McCullough | name-list-format = vanc |date=26 February 2004|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;). “Best Future Self” has a patient “think about their life in the future, and imagine that everything has gone as well as it possibly could. They have worked hard and succeeded at accomplishing all of their life goals. Think of this as the realization of all of their life dreams.” The patient is then asked to write down what they imagined. These positive interventions have been shown to decrease depression,&lt;ref name="Krentzman_2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bolier L, Haverman M, Westerhof GJ, Riper H, Smit F, Bohlmeijer E | title = Positive psychology interventions: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies | journal = BMC Public Health | volume = 13 | pages = 119 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23390882 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2458-13-119 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and interventions focusing on strengths and positive emotions can, in fact, be as effective in treating disorder as other more commonly used approaches such as [[cognitive behavioral therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Seligman ME, Steen TA, Park N, Peterson C | title = Positive psychology progress: empirical validation of interventions | journal = The American Psychologist | volume = 60 | issue = 5 | pages = 410–21 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16045394 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.60.5.410 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sin2009&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sin NL, Lyubomirsky S | title = Enhancing well-being and alleviating depressive symptoms with positive psychology interventions: a practice-friendly meta-analysis | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychology | volume = 65 | issue = 5 | pages = 467–87 | date = May 2009 | pmid = 19301241 | doi = 10.1002/jclp.20593 | url = http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~sonja/papers/SL2009.pdf | access-date = 2017-06-14 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120120164432/http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~sonja/papers/SL2009.pdf# | archive-date = 2012-01-20 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the apparent effect of PPIs cannot be caused by [[publication bias]], according to a [[meta-analysis]] on 49 studies (2009). PPIs studied included producing gratitude letters, performing optimistic thinking, replaying positive life experiences, and socializing with people.&lt;ref name=Sin2009 /&gt;

Also, in a newer meta-analysis (39 studies, 6,139 participants, 2012), the [[standardized mean difference]] was 0.34 higher for subjective well-being, 0.20 for psychological well-being and 0.23 for depression. Three to six months after the intervention, the effects for subjective well-being and psychological well-being were still significant, so effects seem fairly sustainable. However, in high-quality studies the positive effect was weaker, though positive, so authors considered further high-quality studies necessary to strengthen the evidence. They claimed that the above-mentioned meta-analysis (2009) did not put enough weight on the quality of studies.
PPIs found positive included blessings, kindness practices, taking personal goals, and showing gratitude.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The interventions called "Gratitude Journaling" and "Three Good Things" seem to operate via gratitude.&lt;ref name="Krentzman_2013"/&gt; There is evidence that, when gratitude journaling, focussing on quality over quantity as well as people more than possessions, yields greater benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/tips_for_keeping_a_gratitude_journal|title=Tips for Keeping a Gratitude Journal|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also evidence of a diminished effect from gratitude journaling if it is done more than once or twice a week. Journaling sans gratitude is effective in decreasing negative emotions in general, which suggests that the act of journaling, rather than gratitude alone, is involved in the treatment effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/research/action/romantic-relationships.aspx|title=Breakups aren't all bad: Coping strategies to promote positive outcomes|website=www.apa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Positive psychology seeks to inform clinical psychology of the potential to expand its approach, and of the merit of the possibilities. Given a fair opportunity, positive psychology might well change priorities to better address the breadth and depth of the human experience in clinical settings.

==== Post-traumatic growth ====
[[Posttraumatic growth]] (PTG) is a possible outcome after a traumatic event, besides [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD). Following a traumatic event, for instance rape, incest, cancer, attack, or combat, "it is normal to experience debilitating symptoms of depression and anxiety."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Reivich K, Shatte A |year=2003|title=The Resilience Factor: Seven Essential Skills For Overcoming Life's Inevitable Obstacles|publisher=Three Rivers Press|edition=Reprint|pages=9–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person who shows PTG however, will experience these negative outcomes for a time and then show an increase in well-being, higher than it was before the trauma occurred. [[Martin Seligman]], a founder of positive psychology, emphasizes that "arriving at a higher level of psychological functioning than before" is a key point in PTG.&lt;ref name="Seligman_2011"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Seligman ME |year=2011|title=Flourish: A visionary new understanding of happiness and wellbeing|location=New York, NY|publisher=Free Press|chapter=Ch. 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; If instead an individual experiences a depressive period but recovers from an incident and returns to their normal level of psychological functioning, they are demonstrating [[Psychological resilience|resilience]].&lt;ref name="Seligman_2011"/&gt; This suggests that in PTG, the trauma acts as a turning point for the person to achieve greater well-being. Seligman recognizes "the fact that trauma often sets the stage for growth" and given the right tools, individuals can make the most of that opportunity."&lt;ref name="Seligman_2011"/&gt;

When reflecting on a traumatic growth, Seligman suggests using the following five elements to facilitate PTG: understand the response to trauma, reduce anxiety, utilize constructive disclosure, create a trauma narrative, and articulate life principles and stances that are more robust to challenge.&lt;ref name="Seligman_2011"/&gt; Someone experiencing PTG will achieve elements of Seligman’s "good life" theory, including a more meaningful and purposeful valuing of life, improved positive relationships, accomplishment, and a more optimistic and open mindset according to the [[Broaden-and-build|broaden-and-build theory]].&lt;ref name="pmid8827649"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tedeschi RG, Calhoun LG | title = The Posttraumatic Growth Inventory: measuring the positive legacy of trauma | journal = Journal of Traumatic Stress | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 455–71 | date = July 1996 | pmid = 8827649 | doi = 10.1002/jts.2490090305 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Post-traumatic growth in constructive journalism ====
The phenomenon of PTG is applicable to many disciplines. The construct is important not only for just soldiers, emergency responders, and survivors of traumatic events, but on average, for everyday citizens facing typical adversity. One way to expose citizens to stories of PTG is through constructive journalism. Constructive journalism, as defined by PhD student Karen McIntyre at University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, is "an emerging style of journalism in which positive psychology techniques are applied to news work with the aim of engaging readers by creating more productive news stories, all while maintaining core journalistic functions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | vauthors = McIntyre K |year=2014|title=My current research focus is the subject of my dissertation: constructive journalism|url=http://karenmcintyre.org/research-2/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cathrine Gyldensted, an experienced reporter with a Masters in applied positive psychology and coauthor of two books, demonstrated that typical news reporting, which is associated with negative valence, harms mood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis | vauthors = Gyldensted C |year=2011|title= Innovating News Journalism through Positive Psychology|type=Master Thesis|publisher=University of Pennsylvania|url=http://repository.upenn.edu/mapp_capstone/20/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using PTG to focus on victims' strengths and instances of overcoming adversity encourages readers to implement similar ideals in their own lives. "So the goal of positive psychology in well-being theory is to measure and to build human flourishing."&lt;ref name="Seligman_2011" /&gt; Combining positive psychology constructs like PTG, PERMA, and "broaden and build" with journalism could potentially improve affect and inspire individuals about the benefits of positive psychology.

PERMA not only plays a role in our own personal lives but also can be used for public major news stories. With this model, journalists can instead focus on the positives of a story and ask questions about how conflicts or even tragedies have brought people together, how someone has experienced post-traumatic growth, and more. News stories then shift the perspective from a victimizing one to an uplifting one. Positive psychology is slowly but steadily making its way through news reporting via constructive journalism. PERMA helps journalists ask the right questions to continue that progress by bringing the focus of a potentially negative story to the positives and solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://positivepsychologynews.com/news/cathrine-gyldensted/2013072426851|title=Hurricane Sandy, Utoya, Homelessness: Constructive News out of Loss}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Affect - ratio of positive to negative affect ====
Fredrickson and Losada postulated in 2005 that the [[ratio]] of positive to negative [[affect (psychology)|affect]], known as the [[critical positivity ratio]], can distinguish [[individual]]s that flourish from those that do not. Languishing was characterized by a ratio of positive to negative affect of 2.5. Optimal functioning or flourishing was argued to occur at a ratio of 4.3. The point at which flourishing changes to languishing is called the [[Losada line]] and is placed at the positivity ratio of 2.9. Those with higher ratios were claimed to have broader behavioral repertoires, greater [[flexibility (personality)|flexibility]] and resilience to [[adversity]], more social [[resources]], and more optimal functioning in many areas of their life.&lt;ref name="Frederickson, B.L., &amp; Losada, M.F."&gt;Fredrickson, B. L., &amp; Losada, M. F. (2005). Positive affect and complex dynamics of human flourishing. American Psychologist, 60, 678-686.&lt;/ref&gt; The model also predicted the existence of an upper limit to happiness, reached at a positivity ratio of 11.5. Fredrickson and Losada claimed that at this limit, flourishing begins to disintegrate and productivity and creativity decrease. They suggested as positivity increased, so to "appropriate negativity" needs to increase. This was described as time-limited, practicable [[feedback]] connected to specific circumstances, i.e. [[constructive criticism]].&lt;ref name="Frederickson, B.L., &amp; Losada, M.F." /&gt;

This positivity ratio theory was widely accepted until 2013, when Nick Brown, a graduate student in applied positive psychology, co-authored a paper with [[Alan Sokal]] and Harris Friedman, showing that the mathematical basis of the paper was invalid.&lt;ref name=pmid23855896&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brown NJ, Sokal AD, Friedman HL | title = The complex dynamics of wishful thinking: the critical positivity ratio | journal = The American Psychologist | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 801–13 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 23855896 | doi = 10.1037/a0032850 | arxiv = 1307.7006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fredrickson partially retracted the paper, agreeing that the math may be flawed, but maintaining that the empirical evidence is still valid.&lt;ref name=pmid23855895&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fredrickson BL | title = Updated thinking on positivity ratios | journal = The American Psychologist | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 814–22 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 23855895 | doi = 10.1037/a0033584 }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Brown and colleagues insist there is no evidence for the critical positivity ratio whatsoever.&lt;ref name=pmid25197848&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brown NJ, Sokal AD, Friedman HL | title = The persistence of wishful thinking | journal = The American Psychologist | volume = 69 | issue = 6 | pages = 629–32 | date = September 2014 | pmid = 25197848 | doi = 10.1037/a0037050 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In relation with basic emotions ===
Most [[psychologist]]s focus on a person's most basic [[List of emotions|emotions]]. There are thought to be between seven and fifteen basic [[emotion]]s. The [[emotion]]s can be combined in many ways to create more subtle variations of [[emotional]] experience. This suggests that any attempt to wholly eliminate negative emotions from our life would have the unintended consequence of losing the variety and subtlety of our most profound emotional experiences. Efforts to increase positive emotions will not automatically result in decreased negative [[emotion]]s, nor will decreased negative emotions necessarily result in increased positive emotions.&lt;ref&gt;Schimmack, U. (2005). The structure of subjective well-being. In M. Eid &amp; R. Larsen (Eds.) The science of subjective well-being. New York, NY, US: Guilford Press, pp. 97–123.&lt;/ref&gt; Russell and Feldman Barrett (1992) described emotional reactions as core affects, which are primitive emotional reactions that are consistently experienced but often not acknowledged; they blend pleasant and unpleasant as well as activated and deactivated dimensions that we carry with us at an almost unconscious level.&lt;ref name=pmid10353204&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Russell JA, Barrett LF | title = Core affect, prototypical emotional episodes, and other things called emotion: dissecting the elephant | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 76 | issue = 5 | pages = 805–19 | date = May 1999 | pmid = 10353204 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.76.5.805 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence suggests negative emotions can be damaging. In an article titled "The undoing effect of positive emotions", [[Barbara Fredrickson]] et al. hypothesized positive emotions undo the cardiovascular effects of negative emotions. When people experience [[Stress (medicine)|stress]], they show increased [[heart rate]], higher [[blood sugar]], [[immune suppression]], and other adaptations optimized for immediate action. If unregulated, the prolonged physiological activation can lead to illness, [[coronary heart disease]], and heightened mortality. Both lab and survey research substantiate that positive emotions help people under stress to return to a preferable, healthier physiological baseline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fredrickson BL, Mancuso RA, Branigan C, Tugade MM | title = The Undoing Effect of Positive Emotions | journal = Motivation and Emotion | volume = 24 | issue = 4 | pages = 237–258 | date = December 2000 | pmid = 21731120 | pmc = 3128334 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research shows that improved mood is one of the various benefits of physical exercise.&lt;ref name=Fox&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,197466,00.html Best Benefit of Exercise?

==== Behavioral repertoire ====
The [[broaden-and-build]] theory of positive emotions suggests positive emotions (e.g. [[happiness]], [[Interest (emotion)|interest]], [[Anticipation (emotion)|anticipation]])&lt;ref name="IPP2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Compton|first=William C | name-list-format = vanc |title=An Introduction to Positive Psychology|publisher=[[Wadsworth Publishing]]|year=2005|pages=23–40|chapter=2|isbn=0-534-64453-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; broaden one's awareness and encourage novel, varied, and exploratory thoughts and actions. Over time, this broadened behavioral repertoire builds skills and resources. For example, curiosity about a landscape becomes valuable navigational knowledge; pleasant interactions with a stranger become a supportive friendship; aimless physical play becomes exercise and physical excellence. Positive emotions are contrasted with negative emotions, which prompt narrow survival-oriented behaviors. For example, the negative emotion of [[anxiety]] leads to the specific [[fight-or-flight response]] for immediate survival.&lt;ref name="IPP2"/&gt;

==== Elevation ====
After several years of researching [[disgust]], [[Jonathan Haidt]], and others, studied its opposite; the term "elevation" was coined. Elevation is a pleasant moral emotion, involving a desire to act morally and do "good". As an emotion it has a biological basis, and is sometimes characterized by a feeling of expansion in the chest or a tingling feeling on the skin.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Haidt|Haidt, Jonathan]] (2005). ''[[The Happiness Hypothesis]]''. Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haidt, J. (2003). [http://faculty.virginia.edu/haidtlab/articles/haidt.elevation-and-positive-psychology.manuscript.html Elevation and the positive psychology of morality]. In C. L. M. Keyes &amp; J. Haidt (Eds.) ''Flourishing: Positive Psychology and the Life Well-lived''. Washington DC: American Psychological Association. (pp.&amp;nbsp;275–289).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The concept of "flourishing" ===
{{Main|Flourishing}}

The term flourishing, in positive psychology, refers to optimal human functioning. It comprises four parts: goodness, generativity, growth, and [[psychological resilience|resilience]] (Fredrickson, 2005).&lt;ref name=pmid16221001&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fredrickson BL, Losada MF | title = Positive affect and the complex dynamics of human flourishing | journal = The American Psychologist | volume = 60 | issue = 7 | pages = 678–86 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 16221001 | pmc = 3126111 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.60.7.678 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Fredrickson (2005), goodness is made up of: happiness, contentment, and effective performance; generativity is about making life better for future generations, and is defined by “broadened thought-action repertoires and behavioral flexibility”; growth involves the use of personal and social assets; and resilience reflects survival and growth after enduring a hardship.&lt;ref name=pmid16221001/&gt; A flourishing life stems from mastering all four of these parts. Two contrasting ideologies are languishing and psychopathology. On the mental health continuum, these are considered intermediate mental health disorders, reflecting someone living an unfulfilled and perhaps meaningless life. Those who languish experience more emotional pain, psychosocial deficiency, restrictions in regular activities, and missed workdays.&lt;ref name=pmid16221001/&gt; 
	
Fredrickson &amp; Losada (2005) conducted a study on university students, operationalizing positive and negative affect.&lt;ref name=pmid16221001/&gt; Based on a mathematical model which has been strongly criticized,&lt;ref name=pmid23855896/&gt; and now been formally withdrawn by Fredrickson as invalid,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/a0034435 |title='Positive affect and the complex dynamics of human flourishing': Correction to Fredrickson and Losada (2005) |journal=American Psychologist |volume=68 |issue=9 |page=822 |year=2013 |last1=Fredrickson |first1=Barbara L |last2=Losada |first2=Marcial F | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fredrickson &amp; Losada claimed to have discovered a [[critical positivity ratio]], above which people would flourish and below which they would not. Although Fredrickson claims that her experimental results are still valid,&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Fredrickson, B. L. (2013). [http://www.unc.edu/peplab/publications/Fredrickson%202013%20Updated%20Thinking.pdf Updated thinking on positivity ratios]. American Psychologist. Electronic publication ahead of print.&lt;/ref&gt; these experimental results have also been questioned due to poor statistical methodology, and [[Alan Sokal]] has pointed out that "given [Fredrickson and Losada's] experimental design and method of data analysis, no data whatsoever could possibly give any evidence of any nonlinearity in the relationship between "flourishing" and the positivity ratio — much less evidence for a sharp discontinuity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://retractionwatch.wordpress.com/2013/09/19/fredrickson-losada-positivity-ratio-paper-partially-withdrawn/|title=Fredrickson-Losada "positivity ratio" paper partially withdrawn|publisher=Retraction Watch|date=September 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study surveyed a U.S. sample of 3,032 adults, aged 25–74. Results showed 17.2 percent of adults were flourishing, while 56.6 percent were moderately mentally healthy. Some common characteristics of a flourishing adult included: educated, older, married and wealthy. The study findings suggest there is room for adults to improve as less than 20 percent of Americans are living a flourishing life. (Keyes, 2002).&lt;ref name = "Keyes_2002"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Keyes CL | year = 2002 | title = The Mental Health Continuum: From Languishing to Flourishing in Life | url = | journal = Journal of Health &amp; Social Behavior | volume = 43 | issue = 2| pages = 207–222 | doi=10.2307/3090197| jstor = 3090197 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benefits from living a flourishing life emerge from research on the effects of experiencing a high ratio of positive to negative affect. The studied benefits of positive affect are increased responsiveness, "broadened behavioral repertoires", increased instinct, and increased perception and imagination.&lt;ref name=pmid16221001/&gt; In addition, the good feelings associated with flourishing result in improvements to immune system functioning, cardiovascular recovery, lessened effects of negative affect, and frontal brain asymmetry.&lt;ref name=pmid16221001/&gt; Other benefits to those of moderate mental health or moderate levels of flourishing were: stronger psychological and social performance, high resiliency, greater cardiovascular health, and an overall healthier lifestyle (Keyes, 2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Keyes CL | title = Promoting and protecting mental health as flourishing: a complementary strategy for improving national mental health | journal = The American Psychologist | volume = 62 | issue = 2 | pages = 95–108 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17324035 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066x.62.2.95 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The encountered benefits of flourishing suggest a definition: "[flourishing] people experience high levels of emotional, psychological and social well being due to vigor and vitality, self-determination, continuous self- growth, close relationships and a meaningful and purposeful life" (Siang-Yang, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;70).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Siang-Yang | first1 = T. | year = 2006 | title = Applied Positive Psychology: Putting Positive Psychology into Practice | url = | journal = Journal of Psychology &amp; Christianity | volume = 25 | issue = 1| pages = 68–73 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Happiness ===
==== Happiness measurement ====
===== Oxford Happiness Questionnaire =====
Psychologists Peter Hills and [[Michael Argyle (psychologist)|Michael Argyle]] developed the Oxford Happiness Questionnaire&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meaningandhappiness.com/oxford-happiness-questionnaire/214/ Oxford Happiness Questionnaire] by Michael Argyle and Peter Hills, a survey of current level of happiness. See also discussion in Hills, P., &amp; Argyle, M. (2002). The Oxford Happiness Questionnaire: a compact scale for the measurement of psychological well-being. ''Personality and Individual Differences'', 33, 1073–1082.&lt;/ref&gt; as a broad measure of psychological well-being. The approach was criticized for lacking a theoretical model of happiness and for overlapping too much with related concepts such as [[self-esteem]], sense of purpose, social interest, [[kindness]], sense of [[humor]] and aesthetic appreciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Todd B. | last = Kashdan | url = http://mason.gmu.edu/~tkashdan/publications/happy.PDF | title = The assessment of subjective well-being (issues raised by the Oxford Happiness Questionnaire) | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | year = 2004 | pages = 1225–1232 | volume = 36 | doi = 10.1016/S0191-8869(03)00213-7 | issue = 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Satisfaction with Life Scale =====
"Happiness" encompasses different emotional and mental phenomena. One method of assessment is [[Ed Diener]]'s Satisfaction with Life Scale. According to Diener, this five-question survey corresponds well with impressions from friends and family, and low incidence of [[Depression (mood)|depression]].&lt;ref name=NYSciHap/&gt;{{clarify|date=June 2014}}

Rather than long-term, big picture appraisals, some methods attempt to identify the amount of positive affect from one activity to the next. Scientists use beepers to remind volunteers to write down the details of their current situation. Alternatively, volunteers complete detailed diary entries each morning about the day before.&lt;ref name=NYSciHap/&gt; A discrepancy arises when researchers compare the results of these short-term "experience sampling" methods, with long-term appraisals. Namely, the latter may not be very accurate; people may not know what makes their life pleasant from one moment to the next. For instance, parents' appraisals mention their children as sources of pleasure, while "experience sampling" indicates parents were not enjoying caring for their children, compared to other activities.&lt;ref name=NYSciHap/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/daniel_kahneman_the_riddle_of_experience_vs_memory.html |title=Daniel Kahneman: The riddle of experience vs. memory &amp;#124; Video on |publisher=Ted.com |access-date=2011-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist [[Daniel Kahneman]] explains this discrepancy by differentiating between happiness according to the "experiencing self" compared to the "remembering self": when asked to reflect on experiences, [[List of memory biases|memory biases]] like the Peak-End effect (e.g. we mostly remember the dramatic parts of a vacation, and how it was at the end) play a large role. A striking finding was in a study of [[colonoscopy]] patients. Adding 60 seconds to this invasive procedure, Kahneman found participants reported the colonoscopy as ''more'' pleasant. This was attributed to making sure the colonoscopy instrument was not moved during the extra 60 seconds – movement is the source of the most discomfort. Thus, Kahneman was appealing to the remembering self's tendency to focus on the end of the experience. Such findings help explain human error in [[affective forecasting]] – people's ability to predict their future emotional states.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;
[[File:Mrs. Humphrey Devereux by John Singleton Copley.jpg|thumb|upright|The "remembering self" may not be the best source of information for pleasing the "experiencing self".]]

==== Changes in happiness levels ====
[[File:Daniel KAHNEMAN.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Daniel Kahneman]]]]
Humans exhibit a variety of abilities. This includes an ability of emotional ''Hedonic Adaptation'', an idea suggesting that beauty, fame and money do not generally have lasting effects on happiness (this effect has also been called the [[Hedonic treadmill]]). In this vein, some research has suggested that only recent events, meaning those that occurred within the last 3 months, affect happiness levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Suh E, Diener E, Fujita F | title = Events and subjective well-being: only recent events matter | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 70 | issue = 5 | pages = 1091–102 | date = May 1996 | pmid = 8656337 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.70.5.1091 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tendency to adapt, and therefore return to an earlier level of happiness, is illustrated by studies showing lottery winners are no happier in the years after they've won.&lt;ref name=NYSciHap/&gt; Other studies have shown [[Paraplegia|paraplegics]] are nearly as happy as control groups that are not paralyzed,&lt;ref name=Seligman2002&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Seligman | first1 = Martin E. P. | name-list-format = vanc | authorlink = Martin Seligman|title = Authentic Happiness: Using the New Positive Psychology to Realize Your Potential for Lasting Fulfillment | year = 2002 | publisher = Free Press | location = New York | isbn = 0-7432-2297-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; after equally few years. Daniel Kahneman explains: "they are not paraplegic full time... It has to do with allocation of attention". Thus, contrary to our [[impact bias]]es, lotteries and paraplegia do not change experiences to as great a degree as we would believe.

However, in a newer study (2007), winning a medium-sized lottery prize had a lasting mental wellbeing effect of 1.4 GHQ points on Britons even two years after the event.&lt;ref name=jgao&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gardner J, Oswald AJ | title = Money and mental wellbeing: a longitudinal study of medium-sized lottery wins | journal = Journal of Health Economics | volume = 26 | issue = 1 | pages = 49–60 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 16949692 | doi = 10.1016/j.jhealeco.2006.08.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, adaptation can be a very slow and incomplete process. Distracting life changes such as the death of a spouse or losing one's job can show measurable changes in happiness levels for several years.&lt;ref name=NYSciHap/&gt; Even the "adapted" paraplegics mentioned above did ultimately report lower levels of pleasure (again, they were happier than one would expect, but not fully adapted).&lt;ref name=Diener&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/significant-results/201304/5-myths-positive-psychology|title=5 Myths of Positive Psychology| first = Robert | last = Biswas-Diener | name-list-format = vanc |work=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, adaptation is a complex process, and while it ''does'' mitigate the emotional effects of many life events it cannot mitigate them entirely.

===== Happiness set point =====
The happiness set point idea is that most people return to an average level of happiness – or a set point – after temporary highs and lows in emotionality. People whose set points lean toward positive emotionality tend to be cheerful most of the time and those whose set points tend to be more negative emotionality tend to gravitate toward pessimism and anxiety. Lykken found that we can influence our level of well-being by creating environments more conductive to feelings of happiness and by working with our genetic makeup.&lt;ref name="Lykken" /&gt; One reason that subjective well-being is for the most part stable is because of the great influence genetics have. Although the events of life have some effect on subjective well-being, the general population returns to their set point.&lt;ref&gt;Lopez, S. J., Snyder, C. R. "The Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology". Oxford University Press, 2009. p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:LyubomirskyHappiness.jpg|thumb|right|In the recipe for one person's happiness, it is nonsensical to blame one ingredient (because all are necessary). However, when comparing two people's happiness, ingredients like genetics can account for as much as half the difference.]]
In her book ''[[The How of Happiness]]'', [[Sonja Lyubomirsky]] similarly argued people's happiness varies around a genetic set point. [[Robert Biswas-Diener|Diener]] warns, however, that it is nonsensical to claim that "happiness is influenced 30–50% by genetics". Diener explains that the recipe for happiness for an individual always requires genetics, environment, and behaviour too, so it is nonsensical to claim that an individual's happiness is due to only one ingredient.

Only differences in happiness can be attributed to differences in factors. In other words, Lyubomirsky's research does not discuss happiness in one individual; it discusses differences in happiness between two or more people. Specifically, Lyubomirsky suggests that 30–40% of the difference in happiness levels is due to genetics (i.e. [[heritable]]). In other words, still, Diener says it makes no sense to say one person's happiness is "due 50% to genetics", but it does make sense to say one person's difference in happiness is 50% due to differences in their genetics (and the rest is due to behaviour and environment).&lt;ref name="Lykken" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Diener/&gt;

Findings from twin studies support the findings just mentioned. Twins reared apart had nearly the same levels of happiness thereby suggesting the environment is not entirely responsible for differences in people's happiness.&lt;ref name="Lykken" /&gt; Importantly, an individual's baseline happiness is not ''entirely'' determined by genetics, and not even by early life influences on one's genetics. Whether or not a person manages to elevate their baseline to the heights of their genetic possibilities depends partly on several factors, including actions and habits. Some happiness-boosting habits seem to include gratitude, appreciation, and even altruistic behavior.&lt;ref name=NYSciHap/&gt; Other research-based habits and techniques for increasing happiness are discussed on this page.

Besides the development of new habits, the use of antidepressants, effective exercise, and a healthier [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]] have proven to affect mood significantly. There is evidence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://faunalytics.org/veganism-help-reduce-stress-anxiety/|title=Does Veganism Help Reduce Stress and Anxiety? - Faunalytics|date=25 May 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that a vegan diet reduces stress and anxiety. [[Exercise]] is sometimes called the "miracle" or "wonder" drug – alluding to the wide variety of proven benefits it provides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=American Association of Kidney Patients|title=Physical Activity and Exercise: The Wonder Drug|url=http://www.aakp.org/aakp-library/Physical-Activity-and-Exercise/|access-date=2017-06-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927221329/http://www.aakp.org/aakp-library/Physical-Activity-and-Exercise/#|archive-date=2011-09-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pimlott N | title = The miracle drug | journal = Canadian Family Physician Medecin De Famille Canadien | volume = 56 | issue = 5 | pages = 407, 409 | date = May 2010 | pmid = 20463262 | pmc = 2868602 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is worth mentioning that a recent book, ''[[Anatomy of an Epidemic]]'', challenges the use of non-conservative usage of medications for mental patients, specially with respect to their long-term positive feedback effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thersa.org/__data/assets/file/0009/407961/20110706MartinSeligman.mp3|title=Seligman, Martin E.P.

[[Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche]] has said that neuro scientists have found that with meditation, an individual's happiness baseline can change.&lt;ref name="timesofindia.indiatimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/science-has-proved-that-meditation-can-improve-quality-of-life-buddhist-master/articleshow/58200304.cms|title=Science has proved that meditation can improve quality of life: Buddhist master - Times of India|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and meditation has been found to increase happiness in several studies.A study on Brahma Kumaris [[Raja yoga]] meditators showed them having higher [[happiness]] (Oxford happiness questionnaire) than the control group.&lt;ref name=pmid24298493&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ramesh MG, Sathian B, Sinu E, Kiranmai SR | title = Efficacy of rajayoga meditation on positive thinking: an index for self-satisfaction and happiness in life | journal = Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research | volume = 7 | issue = 10 | pages = 2265–7 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 24298493 | doi = 10.7860/JCDR/2013/5889.3488 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Evidences against the happiness set point theory =====
In recent large panel studies divorce, death of a spouse, unemployment, disability and similar events have been shown to change the long-term subjective well-being, even though some adaptation does occur and inborn factors affect this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2007.00479.x |jstor=20183166 |title=Adaptation and the Set-Point Model of Subjective Well-Being |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=75–9 |year=2016 |last1=Lucas |first1=Richard E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fujita and Diener found that 24% of people changed significantly between the first five years of the study and the last five years. Almost one in four people showed changes in their well-being over the years; indeed sometimes those changes were quite dramatic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fujita F, Diener E | title = Life satisfaction set point: stability and change | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 88 | issue = 1 | pages = 158–64 | date = January 2005 | pmid = 15631581 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.88.1.158 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce Headey found that 5–6% of people dramatically increased their life satisfaction over a 15- to 20-year period and that the goals people pursued significantly affected their life satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Headey | first1 = B. | year = 2008 | title = Life goals matter to happiness: A revision of set-point theory | url = | journal = Social Indicators Research | volume = 86 | issue = 2| pages = 312–231 | doi = 10.1007/s11205-007-9138-y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Personal training to increase happiness =====
The easiest and best possible way to increase one's happiness is by doing something that increases the ratio of positive to negative emotions. Contrary to some beliefs, in many scenarios, people are actually very good at determining what will increase their positive emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thayer RE, Newman JR, McClain TM | title = Self-regulation of mood: strategies for changing a bad mood, raising energy, and reducing tension | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 67 | issue = 5 | pages = 910–25 | date = November 1994 | pmid = 7983582 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.67.5.910 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been many techniques developed to help increase one's happiness.

A first technique is known as the "Sustainable Happiness Model (SHM)." This model proposes that long-term happiness is determined upon: (1) one's genetically determined [[#Happiness set point|set-point]], (2) circumstantial factors, and (3) intentional activities. Lyubomirsky, Sheldon and Schkade suggest to make these changes in the correct way in order to have long-term happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lyubomirsky S, Sheldon KM, Schkade D | year = 2005 | title = Pursuing happiness: The architecture of sustainable change | url = | journal = Review of General Psychology | volume = 9 | issue = 2| pages = 111–131 | doi = 10.1037/1089-2680.9.2.111 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another suggestion of how to increase one's happiness is through a procedure called "Hope Training." Hope Training is primarily focused on hope due to the belief that hope drives the positive emotions of well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| vauthors = Lopez SJ, Floyd RK, Ulven JC, Snyder CR |year=2000|contribution=Hope therapy: Building a house of hope|editor=C.R. Snyder|title=The handbook of hope: Theory, measures, and applications|pages=123–148|location=New York|publisher=Academic Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; This training is based on the hope theory, which states that well-being can increase once people have developed goals and believe themselves to achieve those goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Rand, Kevin L., &amp; Cheaven, Jennifer S|year=2009|contribution=Hope theory|title=Oxford handbook of positive psychology|edition=2nd |editors= Lopez, Shane, J., Snyder, C.R. |location=New York, NY, US|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=323–333}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main purposes of hope training is to eliminate individuals from false hope syndrome. False hope syndrome particularly occurs when one believes that changing their behavior is easy and the outcomes of the change will be evidenced in a short period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/1467-8721.00076 |title=The False-Hope Syndrome |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=9 |issue=4 |page=128 |year=2016 |last1=Polivy |first1=Janet |last2=Herman |first2=C. Peter  | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are coaching procedures based on positive psychology, which are backed by scientific research, with availability of intervention tools and assessments that positive psychology trained coaches can utilize to support the coaching process. Positive psychology coaching uses scientific evidence and insights gained in these areas to work with clients in their goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Biswas-Diener | first = Robert | name-list-format = vanc |year=2010|title=Practicing Positive Psychology Coaching: Assessment, Diagnosis, and Intervention | isbn = 978-0-470-53676-6|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Time and happiness ====
[[File:Slavyansky-Family portrait.jpg|thumb|A portrait commemorating a family's day together]]
[[Philip Zimbardo]] suggests we might also analyze happiness from a "time perspective". He suggested the sorting of people's focus in life by valence (positive or negative) and also by their time perspective (past, present, or future orientation). Doing so may reveal some individual conflicts, not over whether an activity is enjoyed, but whether one prefers to risk delaying gratification further. Zimbardo also believes research reveals an optimal balance of perspectives for a happy life; commenting, our focus on reliving positive aspects of our past should be high, followed by time spent believing in a positive future, and finally spending a moderate (but not excessive) amount of time in enjoyment of the present.&lt;ref name=ZimbardoTime&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/philip_zimbardo_prescribes_a_healthy_take_on_time.html |title=Philip Zimbardo prescribes a healthy take on time &amp;#124; Video on |publisher=Ted.com |access-date=2011-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The "flow" ===
In the 1970s Csikszentmihalyi's started to study ''[[Flow (psychology)|flow]]'', a state of absorption where one's abilities are well-matched to the demands at-hand. Flow is characterized by intense concentration, loss of self-awareness, a feeling of being perfectly challenged (neither bored nor overwhelmed), and a sense "time is flying". Flow is intrinsically rewarding; it can also assist in the achievement of goals (e.g., winning a game) or improving skills (e.g., becoming a better chess player).&lt;ref name=Csikszentmihalyi1990&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Csikszentmihalyi | first1 = Mihaly | title = Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience | year = 1990 | publisher = Harper &amp; Row | location = New York | isbn = 0-06-016253-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anyone can experience flow, in different domains, such as play, creativity, and work.

Flow is achieved when the challenge of the situation meets one's personal abilities. A mismatch of challenge for someone of low skills results in a state of anxiety; insufficient challenge for someone highly skilled results in boredom.&lt;ref name=Csikszentmihalyi1990/&gt; The effect of challenging situations means that flow is often temporarily exciting and variously stressful, but this is considered [[Eustress]], which is also known as "good" stress. Eustress is arguably less harmful than [[chronic stress]], although the pathways of stress-related systems are similar. Both can create a "wear and tear" effect; however, the differing physiological elements and added psychological benefits of eustress might well balance any wear and tear experienced.

Csikszentmihalyi identified nine indicator elements of flow:
1. Clear goals exist every step of the way, 2. Immediate feedback guides one's action, 3. There is a balance between challenges and abilities, 4. Action and awareness are merged, 5. Distractions are excluded from consciousness, 6. Failure is not worrisome, 7. Self-consciousness disappears, 8. Sense of time is distorted, and 9. The activity becomes "[[autotelic]]" (an end in itself, done for its own sake)&lt;ref name="In zone"&gt;{{cite web |title="In the zone": enjoyment, creativity, and the nine elements of "flow" |publisher=MeaningandHappiness.com|url=http://www.meaningandhappiness.com/zone-enjoyment-creativity-elements-flow/26/|access-date=2010-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; His studies also show that flow is greater during work while happiness is greater during leisure activities.&lt;ref name="Lopez, S. J. 2009. p. 200"&gt;Lopez, S. J., Snyder, C. R. ''The Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology''. Oxford University Press, 2009. p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Health ===

==== Addiction ====
Arguably, some people pursue ineffective shortcuts to feeling good. These shortcuts create positive feelings, but are problematic, in part because of the lack of effort involved. Some examples of these shortcuts include shopping, drugs, chocolate, loveless sex, and TV. These are problematic pursuits because all of these examples have the ability to become addictive. When happiness comes to us so easily, it comes with a price we may not realize. This price comes when taking these shortcuts is the only way to become happy, otherwise viewed as an [[addiction]].&lt;ref name="Krentzman_2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Krentzman AR | title = Review of the application of positive psychology to substance use, addiction, and recovery research | journal = Psychology of Addictive Behaviors | volume = 27 | issue = 1 | pages = 151–65 | date = March 2013 | pmid = 22985057 | pmc = 3531570 | doi = 10.1037/a0029897 }} (Date is for advance online publication. The final form was published in March 2013.)&lt;/ref&gt; A review by Amy Krentzman on the Application of Positive Psychology to Substance Use, Addiction, and Recovery Research, identified, in the field of positive psychology, three domains that allow an individual to thrive and contribute to society.

One of these, A Pleasant Life, involves good feelings about the past, present, and future. To tie this with addiction, they chose an example of [[alcoholism]]. Research on positive affect and alcohol showed a majority of the population associates drinking with pleasure. The pleasure one feels from alcohol is known as somatic pleasure, which is immediate but a short lived sensory delight. The researchers wanted to make clear pleasure alone does not amount to a life well lived; there is more to life than pleasure. Secondly, the Engaged Life is associated with positive traits such as strength of character. A few examples of character strength according to ''Character Strength and Virtues: A Handbook and Classification'' by [[Martin Seligman|Seligman]] and Peterson (2004) are bravery, integrity, citizenship, humility, prudence, gratitude, and hope, all of which are shown in the rise to recovery. To descend into an addiction shows a lack of character strength; however, rising to recovery shows the reinstatement of character strengths, including the examples mentioned above. Thirdly, the Meaningful Life is service and membership to positive organizations. Examples of positive organizations include family, workplace, social groups, and society in general. Organizations, like [[Alcoholics Anonymous]], can be viewed as a positive organization. Membership fosters positive affect, while also promoting character strengths, which as seen in the Engaged Life, can aid in beating addiction.&lt;ref name="Krentzman_2013"/&gt;

==== Emotional health ====
Researcher Dianne Hales described an ''emotionally healthy'' person as someone who exhibits flexibility and adaptability to different circumstances, a sense of meaning and affirmation in life, an "understanding that the self is not the center of the universe", compassion and the ability to be unselfish, an increased depth and satisfaction in intimate relationships, and a sense of control over the mind and body.&lt;ref name=twsMay18&gt;{{cite news | first = Dianne | last = Hales | name-list-format = vanc  |title= An Invitation to Health, Brief: Psychological Well-Being 2010–2011 Edition | publisher = Wadsworth Cengage Learning  |page=26 |year= 2010 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=oP91HVIMPRIC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mental health ====
[[Richard Layard|Layard]] and others show that the most important influence on happiness is mental health.&lt;ref name="voxeu1"/&gt;

L.M. Keyes and Shane Lopez illustrate the four typologies of mental health functioning: flourishing, struggling, floundering and languishing. However, complete mental health is a combination of high emotional well-being, high psychological well-being, and high social well-being, along with low mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;Keyes, C.L.M., &amp; Lopez, S.J. (2002). Toward a science of mental health: Positive directions in diagnosis and interventions. In C.R. Snyder &amp; S.J. Lopez (Eds.), ''Handbook of positive psychology'' (pp. 45–59). London: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although health is part of well-being, some people are able to maintain satisfactory wellbeing despite the presence of psychological symptoms.&lt;ref name= Bos&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bos EH, Snippe E, de Jonge P, Jeronimus BF | title = Preserving Subjective Wellbeing in the Face of Psychopathology: Buffering Effects of Personal Strengths and Resources | journal = PLOS One | volume = 11 | issue = 3 | pages = e0150867 | year = 2016 | pmid = 26963923 | pmc = 4786317 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0150867 | url = http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0150867 | bibcode = 2016PLoSO..1150867B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Physical health ====
Meta-analyses published between 2013 and 2017 show that exercise is associated with reductions in depressive symptoms, fatigue and QoL plus improvements in attention, hyperactivity, impulsivity, social functioning, schizophrenic symptoms, and verbal fluency in various special populations. However, aerobic exercise has no significant effect on anxiety disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kspope.com/ethics/exercise-meta-analyses.php|title=Meta-Analyses: Exercise's Psychological &amp; Physical Effects on Health, Disorders, &amp; Quality of Life|website=kspope.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 a study conducted by Andrew Steptow and Michael Marmot at University College London, found that happiness is related to biological markers that play an important role in health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Steptoe A, Wardle J, Marmot M | title = Positive affect and health-related neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and inflammatory processes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 102 | issue = 18 | pages = 6508–12 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15840727 | pmc = 1088362 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0409174102 | bibcode = 2005PNAS..102.6508S }}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers aimed to analyze whether there was any association between well-being and three biological markers: heart rate, [[cortisol]] levels, and plasma fibrinogen levels. The participants who rated themselves the least happy had cortisol levels that were 48% higher than those who rated themselves as the most happy. The least happy subjects also had a large plasma fibrinogen response to two stress-inducing tasks: the Stroop test, and tracing a star seen in a mirror image. Repeating their studies three years later Steptow and Marmot found that participants who scored high in positive emotion continued to have lower levels of cortisol and fibrinogen, as well as a lower heart rate.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

In Happy People Live Longer (2011),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Frey BS | title = Psychology. Happy people live longer | journal = Science | volume = 331 | issue = 6017 | pages = 542–3 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21292959 | doi = 10.1126/science.1201060 | bibcode = 2011Sci...331..542F }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruno Frey reported that happy people live 14% longer, increasing longevity 7.5 to 10 years and [[Richard Davidson]]'s bestseller (2012) ''The Emotional Life of Your Brain'' argues that positive emotion and happiness benefit long-term health.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

However, in 2015 a study building on earlier research found that happiness has no effect on mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liu B, Floud S, Pirie K, Green J, Peto R, Beral V | title = Does happiness itself directly affect mortality? The prospective UK Million Women Study | journal = Lancet | volume = 387 | issue = 10021 | pages = 874–81 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 26684609 | pmc = 5075047 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(15)01087-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "This "basic belief that if you're happier you're going to live longer. That's just not true."&lt;ref name=Harriet20151213&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/health/unsw-research-finds-happy-people-do-not-live-longer-when-ill-health-is-removed-from-equation-20151209-glj3rl.html |title=UNSW research finds happy people do not live longer when ill health is removed from equation |last=Alexander |first=Harriet  | name-list-format = vanc |date=13 December 2015 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |access-date=15 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consistent results are that "apart from good health, happy people were more likely to be older, not smoke, have fewer educational qualifications, do strenuous exercise, live with a partner, do religious or group activities and sleep for eight hours a night."&lt;ref name=Harriet20151213/&gt;

Happiness does however seem to have a protective impact on immunity. The tendency to experience positive emotions was associated with greater resistance to [[Common cold|colds]] and [[Influenza|flu]] in interventional studies irrespective of other factors such as smoking, drinking, exercise, and sleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cohen S, Doyle WJ, Turner RB, Alper CM, Skoner DP | title = Emotional style and susceptibility to the common cold | journal = Psychosomatic Medicine | volume = 65 | issue = 4 | pages = 652–7 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12883117 | doi = 10.1097/01.PSY.0000077508.57784.DA }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cohen S, Alper CM, Doyle WJ, Treanor JJ, Turner RB | title = Positive emotional style predicts resistance to illness after experimental exposure to rhinovirus or influenza a virus | journal = Psychosomatic Medicine | volume = 68 | issue = 6 | pages = 809–15 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17101814 | doi = 10.1097/01.psy.0000245867.92364.3c }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Positive emotional states have a favorable effect on mortality and survival in both healthy and diseased populations. Even at the same level of smoking, drinking, exercise, and sleep, [[Happiness|happier]] people seem to live longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chida Y, Steptoe A | title = Positive psychological well-being and mortality: a quantitative review of prospective observational studies | journal = Psychosomatic Medicine | volume = 70 | issue = 7 | pages = 741–56 | date = September 2008 | pmid = 18725425 | doi = 10.1097/PSY.0b013e31818105ba }}&lt;/ref&gt; Interventional trials conducted to establish a [[Causality|cause-effect relationship]] indicate positive emotions to be associated with greater resistance to objectively verifiable [[Common cold|colds]] and [[Influenza|flu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cohen S, Doyle WJ, Turner RB, Alper CM, Skoner DP | title = Emotional style and susceptibility to the common cold | journal = Psychosomatic Medicine | volume = 65 | issue = 4 | pages = 652–7 | date = 2003-08-01 | pmid = 12883117 | doi = 10.1097/01.psy.0000077508.57784.da }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cohen S, Alper CM, Doyle WJ, Treanor JJ, Turner RB | title = Positive emotional style predicts resistance to illness after experimental exposure to rhinovirus or influenza a virus | journal = Psychosomatic Medicine | volume = 68 | issue = 6 | pages = 809–15 | date = 2006-12-01 | pmid = 17101814 | doi = 10.1097/01.psy.0000245867.92364.3c }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Alternative medicine ====
Health consumers sometimes confuse the terms "wellness" and "well-being". Wellness is a term more commonly associated with alternative medicine which may or may not coincide with gains in subjective well-being. In 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tga.gov.au/australian-government-response-review-medicines-and-medical-devices-regulation|title=Australian Government Response to the Review of Medicines and Medical Devices Regulation| publisher = Australian Government Department of Health. Therapeutic Goods Administration|date=15 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Australian Government reviewed the effectiveness of numerous complementary therapies: they found low-moderate quality evidence that the Alexander technique, Buteyko, massage therapy (remedial massage&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amt.org.au/downloads/submissions/Evidence-Based-Massage-2009.pdf |title=Evidence based massage |website=www.amt.org.au |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;), tai chi and yoga are helpful for certain health conditions. On the other hand, the balance of evidence indicates that homeopathy, aromatherapy, bowen therapy, Feldenkrais, herbalism, homeopathy, iridology, kinesiology, pilates, reflexology and rolfing shiatsu were classed as ineffective.

==== Fruit and vegetable consumption ====
There is growing evidence that a diet rich in fruits and vegetables is related to greater happiness, life satisfaction, and positive mood as well. This evidence cannot be entirely explained by demographic or health variables including [[Socioeconomic status|socio-economic status]], [[Physical exercise|exercise]], [[smoking]], and [[body mass index]], suggesting a causal link.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Conner TS, Brookie KL, Richardson AC, Polak MA | title = On carrots and curiosity: eating fruit and vegetables is associated with greater flourishing in daily life | journal = British Journal of Health Psychology | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | pages = 413–27 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 25080035 | doi = 10.1111/bjhp.12113 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further studies have found that fruit and vegetable consumption predicted improvements in positive mood the next day, not vice versa. On days when people ate more fruits and vegetables, they reported feeling calmer, happier, and more energetic than normal, and they also felt more positive the next day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = White BA, Horwath CC, Conner TS | title = Many apples a day keep the blues away--daily experiences of negative and positive affect and food consumption in young adults | journal = British Journal of Health Psychology | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 782–98 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 23347122 | doi = 10.1111/bjhp.12021 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cross-sectional study|Cross-sectional studies]] worldwide support a relationship between happiness and fruit and vegetable intake. Those eating fruits and vegetables each day have a higher likelihood of being classified as “very happy,” suggesting a strong and positive correlation between fruit and vegetable consumption and happiness.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rooney C, McKinley MC, Woodside JV | title = The potential role of fruit and vegetables in aspects of psychological well-being: a review of the literature and future directions | journal = The Proceedings of the Nutrition Society | volume = 72 | issue = 4 | pages = 420–32 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 24020691 | doi = 10.1017/S0029665113003388 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether it be in South Korea,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kye SY, Park K | title = Health-related determinants of happiness in Korean adults | journal = International Journal of Public Health | volume = 59 | issue = 5 | pages = 731–8 | date = October 2014 | pmid = 25033934 | doi = 10.1007/s00038-014-0588-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Iran,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fararouei M, Brown IJ, Akbartabar Toori M, Estakhrian Haghighi R, Jafari J | title = Happiness and health behaviour in Iranian adolescent girls | journal = Journal of Adolescence | volume = 36 | issue = 6 | pages = 1187–92 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 24215965 | doi = 10.1016/j.adolescence.2013.09.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chile,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Piqueras JA, Kuhne W, Vera-Villarroel P, van Straten A, Cuijpers P | title = Happiness and health behaviours in Chilean college students: a cross-sectional survey | journal = BMC Public Health | volume = 11 | issue =  | pages = 443 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21649907 | pmc = 3125376 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2458-11-443 }}&lt;/ref&gt; USA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Boehm JK, Williams DR, Rimm EB, Ryff C, Kubzansky LD | title = Association between optimism and serum antioxidants in the midlife in the United States study | journal = Psychosomatic Medicine | volume = 75 | issue = 1 | pages = 2–10 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 23257932 | pmc = 3539819 | doi = 10.1097/PSY.0b013e31827c08a9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or UK,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Blanchflower |first1=David G. |last2=Oswald |first2=Andrew J. |last3=Stewart-Brown |first3=Sarah  | name-list-format = vanc |title=Is Psychological Well-Being Linked to the Consumption of Fruit and Vegetables? |journal=Social Indicators Research |volume=114 |issue=3 |year=2012 |pages=785–801 |doi=10.1007/s11205-012-0173-y }}&lt;/ref&gt; greater fruit and vegetable consumption had a positive association with greater happiness, independent of factors such as [[smoking]], [[Physical exercise|exercise]], [[body mass index]], and [[Socioeconomic status|socio-economic factors]].

The documentary ‘food matters’ includes claims of well-being benefits of raw foods, which has been disputed as pseudoscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beyondveg.com/tu-j-l/raw-cooked/raw-cooked-1i.shtml |title=Digestive Leukocytosis-What a Close Reading of Kouchakoff Reveals |publisher=Beyondveg.com |date= |access-date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hedonic well-being ===
Eudaimonic well-being has been found to be empirically distinguishable from hedonic well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10902-015-9683-z |title=Revisiting the Empirical Distinction Between Hedonic and Eudaimonic Aspects of Well-Being Using Exploratory Structural Equation Modeling |journal=Journal of Happiness Studies |volume=17 |issue=5 |page=2023 |year=2015 |last1=Joshanloo |first1=Mohsen }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Joshanloo M | title = A New Look at the Factor Structure of the MHC-SF in Iran and the United States Using Exploratory Structural Equation Modeling | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychology | volume = 72 | issue = 7 | pages = 701–13 | date = July 2016 | pmid = 26990960 | doi = 10.1002/jclp.22287 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Identity ===
Individual roles play a part in cognitive well-being. Not only does having social ties improve cognitive well-being, it also improves psychological health.&lt;ref name="Thoits 1992 237"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thoits|first=Peggy | name-list-format = vanc |title=Identity Structures and Psychological Well-Being: Gender and Marital Status Comparisons|journal=Social Psychology Quarterly|date=September 1992|volume=55|issue=3|page=237|doi=10.2307/2786794|jstor=2786794}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having multiple identities and roles helps individuals to relate to their society and provide the opportunity for each to contribute more as they increase their roles, therefore creating enhanced levels of cognitive well-being. Each individual role is ranked internally within a [[hierarchy]] of salience. [[Salience (neuroscience)|Salience]] is “...the subjective importance that a person attaches to each identity”.&lt;ref name="Thoits 1992 237"/&gt;

Different roles an individual has have a different impact on their well-being. Within this hierarchy, higher roles offer more of a source to their well-being and define more meaningfulness to their overall role as a human being.

[[Ethnic Group|Ethnic identity]] may play a role in an individual's cognitive well-being. Studies have shown that “...both social psychological and developmental perspectives suggest that a strong, secure ethnic identity makes a positive contribution to [[cognitive]] well-being”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Phinney | first1 = Jean S. | last2 = Horenczyk | first2 = Gabriel | last3 = Liebkind | first3 = Karmela | last4 = Vedder | first4 = Paul | name-list-format = vanc | title = Ethnic Identity, Immigration, and Well-Being: An Interactional Perspective | journal = Journal of Social Issues |date=September 2001|volume=57|issue=3|pages=493–510|doi=10.1111/0022-4537.00225}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those in an acculturated society may feel more equal as a human being within their culture, therefore experiencing increased well-being.

=== Optimism and helplessness ===
[[File:Fluorescent Lamp.jpg|thumb|left|[[J.B. MacKinnon]] recommended taking full responsibility for one small, but clear improvement for the world (the way energy-saving activists did by promoting a new kind of lamp). Inspired by sociological research, MacKinnon said "vertical agitation" helps reduce feelings of helplessness.]]

[[Learned optimism]] refers to development of one's potential for a [[sanguine]] outlook.{{clarify|date=May 2018}} Optimism is learned as personal efforts and abilities are linked to personally desired outcomes. In short, it is the belief one can influence the future in tangible and meaningful ways. Learned optimism contrasts with [[learned helplessness]], which consists of a belief, or beliefs, one has no control over what occurs, and that something external dictates outcomes, e.g., success. Optimism is learned by consciously challenging negative [[Intrapersonal communication|self talk]]. This includes self talk on any event viewed as a personal failure that permanently affects all areas of the person's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.paid.2012.12.004 |title=Great expectations: A meta-analytic examination of optimism and hope |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |volume=54 |issue=7 |page=821 |year=2013 |last1=Alarcon |first1=Gene M |last2=Bowling |first2=Nathan A |last3=Khazon |first3=Steven  | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intrapersonal, or internal, dialogues influence one's feelings. In fact, reports of happiness are correlated with the general ability to "rationalize or explain" social and economic inequalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Conservatives Happier Than Liberals | first = Jeanna
 | last = Bryner | name-list-format = vanc |work=LiveScience.com|url=http://www.livescience.com/health/080507-liberal-conservative.html|access-date=2008-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hope]] is a powerful positive feeling, linked to a learned style of goal-directed thinking. Hope is fostered when a person utilizes both ''pathways thinking'' (the perceived capacity to find routes to desired goals) and ''agency thinking'' (the requisite motivations to use those routes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | veditors = Snyder CR | year = 2000 | title = Handbook of hope: Theory, measures, and applications. | location = San Diego, CA | publisher =  Academic Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author and journalist [[J.B. MacKinnon]] suggested the cognitive tool of "Vertical Agitation" can assist in avoiding helplessness (e.g., paralysis in the face of Earth's many problems). The concept stemmed from research on denial by sociologist [[Stanley Cohen (sociologist)|Stanley Cohen]]. Cohen explained: in the face of massive problems people tend towards learned helplessness rather than confronting the [[Cognitive dissonance|dissonant]] facts of the matter. Vertical Agitation involves focusing on one part of a problem at a time, while holding oneself accountable for solving the problem – all the way to the highest level of government, business and society (such as advocating strongly for something: [[Compact fluorescent lamp|eco-friendly lightbulbs]]). This allows each individual in society to make vital "trivial" (read: small) changes, without being intimidated by the work needed to be done as a whole. Mackinnon added: a piecemeal approach also keeps individuals from becoming too 'holier than thou' (harassing friends and family about ''every'' possible improvement), where widespread practice of Vertical Agitation would lead to much improvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utne.com/environment/Eco-Uncertainty-JB-MacKinnon-Explore.aspx |title=In an Age of Eco-Uncertainty: Vertical Agitation, Eco-Douchebags, Cohen' s Rule, and Lifestyle as Social Change |publisher=Utne.com |access-date=2011-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Well-being has traditionally focused on improving physical, [[emotional]] and mental quality of life with little understanding of how dependent they all are on financial health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=de Chavez|first1=Anna Cronin|last2=Backett-Milburn|first2=Kathryn|last3=Parry|first3=Odette|last4=Platt|first4=Stephen | name-list-format = vanc |title=Understanding and researching wellbeing: Its usage in different disciplines and potential for health research and health promotion|journal=Health Education Journal|date=27 July 2016|volume=64|issue=1|pages=70–87|doi=10.1177/001789690506400108}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, financial stress often manifests itself in physical and [[emotional]] difficulties that lead to increased healthcare costs and reduced productivity.&lt;ref name="rodalenews.com"&gt;{{cite web | authors = Main E | date = 2 March 2010 | title = Why financial stress is the costliest for your health | url = http://www.rodalenews.com/stress-health-problems | work = Rodale Wellness }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work = PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) | date = April 2014 | title = Employee financial wellness survey: 2014 results. | url = http://www.pwc.com/en_US/us/private-company-services/publications/assets/pwc-employee-financial-wellness-survey-2014-results.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; A more inclusive paradigm for well-being would acknowledge money as a source of [[empowerment]] that maximizes physical and [[emotional]] health by reducing financial [[stress (psychological)|stress]].&lt;ref name="rodalenews.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first1 = Alyssa | last1 = Brown | first2 = Lindsey | last2 = Sharpe | date = 7 July 2014 | name-list-format = vanc | work = Gallup | title = Americans' financial well-being is lowest, social highest. | url = http://www.gallup.com/poll/172109/americans-financial-lowest-social-highest.aspx }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | vauthors = Taylor M, Jenkins S, Sacker A | year = 2009 | title = Financial capability and wellbeing: Evidence from the BHPS. | publisher = UK Financial Services Authority | url = http://hb.betterregulation.com/external/OP34.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a model would provide individuals with the financial knowledge they need, as well as enable them to gain valuable insight and understanding regarding their financial habits, as well as their thoughts, feelings, fears and attitudes about money.

It has been argued that money cannot effectively "buy" much happiness unless it is used in certain ways, and that "Beyond the point at which people have enough to comfortably feed, clothe, and house themselves, having more money – even a lot more money – makes them only a little bit happier."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bennett|first1=Drake | name-list-format = vanc | title = Happiness: A buyer’s guide | url = http://archive.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2009/08/23/happiness_a_buyers_guide/ |access-date=1 April 2017|work=The Boston Globe|date=23 August 2009|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''[[Stumbling on Happiness]]'', psychologist [[Daniel Gilbert (psychologist)|Daniel Gilbert]] described research suggesting money makes a significant difference to the poor (where basic needs are not yet met), but has a greatly diminished effect once one reaches middle class (i.e. the [[Easterlin paradox]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Easterlin RA, McVey LA, Switek M, Sawangfa O, Zweig JS | title = The happiness-income paradox revisited | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 107 | issue = 52 | pages = 22463–8 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 21149705 | pmc = 3012515 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1015962107 | url = http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2010/12/08/1015962107 | bibcode = 2010PNAS..10722463E }}&lt;/ref&gt; Every dollar earned is just as valuable to happiness up to a $75,000 annual income,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://80000hours.org/articles/money-and-happiness/|title=Everything you need to know about whether money makes you happy - 80,000 Hours|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; thereafter, the value of each additional dollar earns a diminishing amount of happiness. According to the latest&lt;ref name="liu.se"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iei.liu.se/nek/730g80/artiklar/1.421852/Happywhatmakesus.pdf|title=Linköping University|website=www.iei.liu.se}}&lt;/ref&gt; systematic review of the economic literature on life satisfaction, one's perception of their financial circumstances fully mediates the effects of objective circumstances on one’s well-being. People overestimate the influence of wealth by 100%.&lt;ref name=Aknin09&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/17439760903271421 |title=From wealth to well-being? Money matters, but less than people think |journal=The Journal of Positive Psychology |volume=4 |issue=6 |page=523 |year=2009 |last1=Aknin |first1=Lara B |last2=Norton |first2=Michael I |last3=Dunn |first3=Elizabeth W | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor of Economics [[Richard Easterlin]] noted that [[job satisfaction]] does not depend on salary. In other words, having extra money for luxuries does not increase happiness as much as enjoying one's job or social network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Easterlin R |year=2008|title=Income and happiness: towards a unified theory|journal=The Economic Journal|volume=11|issue=473|pages=465–484|doi= 10.1111/1468-0297.00646|url=http://www.uvm.edu/~pdodds/files/papers/others/everything/easterlin2001a.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert is thus adamant, people should go to great lengths to figure out which jobs they would enjoy, and to find a way to do one of those jobs for a living (that is, provided one is also attentive to social ties).

Unemployment is detrimental to individual well-being. However, that does not hold true in countries where unemployment is widespread. Psychology Today&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-mindful-self-express/201110/preserving-mental-health-during-unemployment|title=Preserving Mental Health During Unemployment|website=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; reports that the impact of unemployment is dampened in those for whom work is less central to their identity, those who receive less criticism and less negative judgments from others, those who can meet their immediate financial obligations and those who do not see their unemployment as high stress and negative. Other protective factors include the expectation of reemployment, routines that structure one's time and evaluating oneself as worthy, competent and successful. According to the latest&lt;ref name="liu.se"/&gt; systematic review of the economic literature on life satisfaction, unemployment is worse for wellbeing for those that are right wing or live in high income countries. Not all unemployment is bad, however: international data from sixteen Western countries indicates that retirement at any age yields large increases in subjective well-being that returns to trend by age 70.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10902-012-9399-2|title=Subjective Well-Being and Retirement: Analysis and Policy Recommendations | first = Elizabeth Mokyr | last = Horner | name-list-format = vanc |date=1 February 2014|publisher=|journal=Journal of Happiness Studies|volume=15|issue=1|pages=125–144|via=link.springer.com|doi=10.1007/s10902-012-9399-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Executive coaching, a workplace intervention for well-being and performance, is proven to work in certain contexts, according to a 2013 independent quantitative scientific summary synthesising high quality scientific research on coaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leadingchangenetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Structuring-and-Understanding-the-Coaching-Industry.pdf |title=Structure and understanding |website=leadingchangenetwork.org |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; It tells us that standard effect sizes for the outcomes of performance/skills, well-being, coping, goal-attainment and work/career attitudes range from 0.43 to 0.74.

A more recent study has challenged the [[Easterlin paradox]]. Using recent data from a broader collection of countries, a positive link was found between GDP and well-being; and there was no point at which wealthier countries' subjective well-being ceased to increase. It was concluded economic growth does indeed increase happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Stevenson, B., Wolfers, J.|year=2008|title=Economic growth and subjective well-being: Reassessing the Easterlin paradox|journal=Brookings Papers on Economic Activity|volume=39|issue=1|pages=1–102|doi=10.3386/w14282|url=http://users.nber.org/~jwolfers/papers/EasterlinParadox.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wealth is strongly correlated with life satisfaction but the correlation between money and emotional well-being is weak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kahneman D, Deaton A | title = High income improves evaluation of life but not emotional well-being | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 107 | issue = 38 | pages = 16489–93 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 20823223 | pmc = 2944762 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1011492107 | bibcode = 2010PNAS..10716489K }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pursuit of money may lead people to ignore leisure time and relationships, both of which may cause and contribute to happiness.&lt;ref name=Aknin09/&gt; The pursuit of money at the risk of jeopardizing one's personal relationships and sacrificing enjoyment from one's leisure activities seems an unwise approach to finding happiness.

Money, or its hectic pursuit, has been shown to hinder people's [[savoring]] ability, or the act of enjoying everyday positive experiences and emotions. In a study looking at working adults, wealthy individuals reported lower levels of savoring ability (the ability to prolong positive emotion) relative to their poorer peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Quoidbach J, Dunn EW, Petrides KV, Mikolajczak M | title = Money giveth, money taketh away: the dual effect of wealth on happiness | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 21 | issue = 6 | pages = 759–63 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20483819 | doi = 10.1177/0956797610371963 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have routinely shown that nations are happier when people's needs are met.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/2010/07/14/world-happiest-countries-lifestyle-realestate-gallup-table.html |title=Forbes article "Table: The World's Happiest Countries" |publisher=Forbes.com |date=2010-07-14 |access-date=2011-11-12 |first=Francesca |last=Levy  | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some studies suggest, however, that people are happier after spending money on experiences, rather than physical things,&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dunn EW, Aknin LB, Norton MI | title = Spending money on others promotes happiness | journal = Science | volume = 319 | issue = 5870 | pages = 1687–8 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18356530 | doi = 10.1126/science.1150952 | bibcode = 2008Sci...319.1687D }}&lt;/ref&gt; and after spending money on others, rather than themselves.&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt; However, purchases that buy ‘time’, for instance, cleaners or cooks typically increase individual well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Whillans AV, Dunn EW, Smeets P, Bekkers R, Norton MI | title = Buying time promotes happiness | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 114 | issue = 32 | pages = 8523–8527 | date = August 2017 | pmid = 28739889 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1706541114 | url = http://www.pnas.org/content/114/32/8523 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lottery winners report higher levels of happiness immediately following the event. But research shows winner's happiness levels drop and return to normal baseline rates within months to years. This finding suggests money does not cause long-term happiness (1978).&lt;ref name="Brickman_1978"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brickman P, Coates D, Janoff-Bulman R | title = Lottery winners and accident victims: is happiness relative? | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 36 | issue = 8 | pages = 917–27 | date = August 1978 | pmid = 690806 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.36.8.917  }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in a more recent British study on lottery prizes between £1,000 and £120,000, a positive effect even two years after the event was found, the return to normal being only partial and varying.&lt;ref name=jgao /&gt;

Degree of ownership also matter:
“...housing property rights matter for subjective well-being. Specifically, using subjective well-being data from China, the authors find that homeownership is associated with higher levels of life satisfaction, although this happiness premium is larger for people who have full ownership compared to those who have only a minor ownership stake in their home.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2016.10.001 |title=Institutions and well-being |journal=European Journal of Political Economy |volume=45 |page=1 |year=2016 |last1=Bennett |first1=Daniel L |last2=Nikolaev |first2=Boris |last3=Aidt |first3=Toke S  | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the latest&lt;ref name="liu.se"/&gt; systematic review of the economic literature on life satisfaction, living in rural areas seems to have some association with well-being, because the included studies tend to control for income and rural areas tend to be poor. Income has a high effect on happiness and incomes are higher in urban areas, so chasing a rural lifestyle at the expense of income may be a ‘grass is always greener’ move.

Adults who live with parents also tend to have&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/hack/living-at-home-with-your-parents/8135918|title=Adults living with their parents are Australia’s least happy, survey finds|first=Ange|last=McCormack | name-list-format = vanc |date=20 December 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; poorer levels of well-being.

=== Mindfulness ===
{{Main|Mindfulness (psychology)}}
[[File:Rollercoaster Tornado Avonturenpark Hellendoorn Netherlands.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Researchers recommend attending to the past to find fond memories, and the future to find hope, but ultimately focussing mostly on the present.&lt;ref name=ZimbardoTime/&gt; Daydreaming usually precedes drops in happiness. Mindfulness and activities that bring focus to the present (like roller coasters) may bring happiness partly by shifting people's focus away from the slightly saddening question "Am I happy?".&lt;ref name=GilbertWandering/&gt;&lt;ref name=KillingsworthMoment/&gt;]]

[[Mindfulness (psychology)|Mindfulness]] is an intentionally focused awareness of one's immediate experience. "Focused awareness" is a conscious moment-by-moment attention to situational elements of an experience: i.e., thoughts, emotions, physical sensations, and surroundings. An aim of mindfulness is to become grounded in the present moment; one learns to observe the arising and passing of experience. One does not judge the experiences and thoughts, nor do they try to "figure things out" and draw conclusions, or change anything – the challenge during mindfulness is to simply observe.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, J. (2003) Insight Meditation: The Practice of Freedom, Shambala, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Gunaratana H | year=1992|title=Mindfulness in Plain English|publisher=Wisdom Publications|quote="It should be noted that mindfulness is not an evolving term.

Ellen J. Langer argued people slip into a state of "mindlessness" by engaging in rote behavior, performing familiar, scripted actions without much cognition, as if on autopilot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Wayne | last1 = Weiten | first2 = Dana S. | last2 = Dunn | first3 = Elizabeth Yost | last3 = Hammer | name-list-format = vanc |title=Psychology Applied to Modern Life|year=2009|publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning|page=521}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates of focusing on present experiences also mention research by Psychologist [[Daniel Gilbert (psychologist)|Daniel Gilbert]], who suggested daydreaming, instead of a focus on the present, may impede happiness.&lt;ref name=GilbertWandering&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Killingsworth MA, Gilbert DT | title = A wandering mind is an unhappy mind | journal = Science | volume = 330 | issue = 6006 | pages = 932 | date = November 2010 | pmid = 21071660 | doi = 10.1126/science.1192439 | bibcode = 2010Sci...330..932K }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=When the Mind Wanders, Happiness Also Strays | first = John | last = Tierney | name-list-format = vanc | publisher = The New York Times | date = 2010-11-15|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/16/science/16tier.html?_r=1&amp;hp|access-date=2010-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow researcher, Matt Killingsworth, found evidence to support the harm of daydreaming. Fifteen thousand participants from around the world provided over 650 000 reports (using an online application on their phones that requested data at random times). Killingsworth found people who reported daydreaming soon reported less happiness; daydreaming is extremely common.&lt;ref name=KillingsworthMoment&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ted.com/talks/matt_killingsworth_want_to_be_happier_stay_in_the_moment.html |title=Matt Killingsworth: Want to be happier? Stay in the moment|work=ted.com|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zimbardo (see "Time Perspectives" above) bestowed the merits of a present-focus, and recommended occasional recall of past positive experiences. Reflecting on past positive experiences can influence current mood, and assist in building positive expectations for the future.

There is research that suggests a person's focus influences level of happiness, where thinking too much about happiness can be counter-productive. Rather than asking: "Am I happy?" – which when posed just 4 times a day, starts to decrease happiness, it might well be better to reflect on one's values (e.g., "Can I muster any hope?").&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"&gt;{{cite AV media|url=http://www.cbc.ca/ideas/episodes/2011/06/20/say-no-to-happiness/|publisher=CBC Ideas|title=Say no to happiness|time=about 10 minutes in| first = Todd | last = Kashdan | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; Asking different questions can assist in redirecting personal thoughts, and perhaps, lead to taking steps to better apply one's energies. The personal answer to any particular question can lead to positive actions, and hopefulness, which is a very powerful, and positive feeling. Hopefulness is more likely to foster happiness, while feelings of hopelessness tend to undermine happiness.

Todd Kashdan, researcher and author of "Designing Positive Psychology", explained early science's findings should not be overgeneralized or adopted too uncritically.

=== Personality ===
The modifiable personality traits which might cause greater well-being have yet to be critically synthesised.

[[Ed Diener]] et al. (1999) suggested this equation: positive emotion – negative emotion = subjective well-being. Since tendency to positive emotion has a correlation of 0.8 with [[extroversion]] and tendency towards negative emotion is indistinguishable from [[neuroticism]], the above equation could also be written as extroversion – neuroticism = happiness. These two traits could account for between 50% to 75% of happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Diener | first1 = Ed | last2 = Suh | first2 = Eunkook M. | last3 = Lucas | first3 = Richard E. | last4 = Smith | first4 = Heidi L. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Subjective well-being: Three decades of progress.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=1 January 1999 |volume=125|issue=2|pages=276–302|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.125.2.276}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are all referring to the [[Big Five personality traits]] model of personality.

An emotionally stable (the opposite of [[Neuroticism|Neurotic]]) [[personality psychology|personality]] correlates well with happiness. Not only does emotional stability make one less prone to negative emotions, it also predicts higher social intelligence – which helps to manage relationships with others (an important part of being happy, discussed below).&lt;ref name="EcoAgeHap"/&gt;

Cultivating an [[Extroversion|extroverted]] [[temperament]] may correlate with happiness for the same reason: it builds relationships and support groups. Some people may be fortunate, from the standpoint of [[Personality psychology|personality theories]] that suggest individuals have control over their long-term behaviors and cognitions. Genetic studies indicate genes for personality (specifically [[extroversion]], [[neuroticism]] and [[conscientiousness]]), and a general factor linking all 5 traits, account for the heritability of [[subjective well-being]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weiss A, Bates TC, Luciano M | title = Happiness is a personal(ity) thing: the genetics of personality and well-being in a representative sample | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 205–10 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18315789 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02068.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research suggests there is a happiness gene, the 5-HTT gene.&lt;ref name="Journal of Human Genetics"&gt;{{cite web|last=Nordqvist|first=Christian| name-list-format = vanc |title=Happiness Gene Located | url = http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/224536.php | publisher=Medical News Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Purpose in life ===
Purpose in life refers broadly to the pursuit of life satisfaction. It has also been found that those with high purpose in life scores have strong goals and sense of direction. They feel there is meaning to their past and present life, and hold beliefs that continue to give their life purpose. Research in the past has focused on purpose in the face of adversity (what is awful, difficult, or absurd in life). Recently, research has shifted to include a focus on the role of purpose in personal fulfillment and self-actualization.

The [[self-control]] approach, as expounded by [[C. R. Snyder]], focusses on exercising self-control to achieve self-esteem by fulfilling goals and feeling in control of our own success. This is further reinforced by a sense of intentionality in both efforts and outcomes.&lt;ref name="FeldmanSnyder2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Feldman|first1=David B.|last2=Snyder|first2=C. R.  | name-list-format = vanc  |title=Hope and the Meaningful Life: Theoretical and Empirical Associations Between Goal–Directed Thinking and Life Meaning|journal=Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology|volume=24|issue=3|year=2005|pages=401–421|issn=0736-7236|doi=10.1521/jscp.24.3.401.65616}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[intrinsic motivation]] approach of [[Viktor Frankl]] emphasized finding value in three main areas: creative, experiential, and attitudinal. Creative values are expressed in acts of creating or producing something. Experiential values are actualized through the senses, and may overlap the hedonistic view of happiness. Attitudinal values are prominent for individuals who are unable to pursue the preceding two classes of values. Attitudinal values are believed to be primarily responsible for allowing individuals to endure suffering with dignity.&lt;ref name="FeldmanSnyder2005"/&gt;

A personal sense of responsibility is required for the pursuit of the values that give life meaning, but it is the realization that one holds sole responsibility for rendering life meaningful that allows the values to be actualized and life to be given true purpose. Determining what is meaningful for one's self provides a sense of autonomy and control which promotes self-esteem.&lt;ref name="FeldmanSnyder2005"/&gt;

Purpose in life is positively correlated with education level and volunteerism. However, it has also been found to decrease with age.
Purpose in life is both highly individual, and what specifically provides purpose will change over the course of one's lifetime.&lt;ref name="RyffSinger2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ryff|first1=Carol D.|last2=Singer|first2=Burton H.  | name-list-format = vanc  |title=Know Thyself and Become What You Are: A Eudaimonic Approach to Psychological Well-Being|journal=Journal of Happiness Studies|volume=9|issue=1|year=2006|pages=13–39|issn=1389-4978|doi=10.1007/s10902-006-9019-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All three of the above theories have self-esteem at their core. Self-esteem is often viewed as the most significant measure of psychological well-being, and highly correlated with many life-regulating skills. Purpose in life promotes and is a source of self-esteem; it is not a by-product of self-esteem.

=== Self-efficacy ===
[[Self-efficacy]] refers to a belief that one's ability to accomplish a task is a function of personal effort. Low self-efficacy, or a disconnect between ability and personal effort, is associated with [[Depression (mood)|depression]]; by comparison, high self-efficacy is associated with positive change, including overcoming abuse, overcoming eating disorders, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. High self-efficacy also has positive benefits for one's [[immune system]], aids in stress management, and decreases pain.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; A related concept, [[Personal effectiveness]], is primarily concerned with planning and the implementation of methods of accomplishment.

=== Sports ===
According to Bloodworth and McNamee sports and physical activities are a key contributor to the development of people's well-being. The influence of sports on well-being is conceptualized within a framework which includes impermanence, its [[hedonistic]] shallowness and its [[epistemological]] inadequacy.{{clarify|date=February 2015}} Researching the effect of sport on well-being is difficult as some societies are unable to access sports, a deficiency in studying this phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bloodworth | first1 = Andrew | first2 = Mike | last2 = McNamee | name-list-format = vanc |title=Sport, physical activity and well-being: An objectivist account|journal=Sport, Education and Society|date=August 2012|volume=17|issue=4|page=18|doi=10.1080/13573322.2011.608948}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Suffering ===
{{Quote box|align=left|width=30%| quoted=1 |quote= Research has shown it is possible to help suffering people by building their strengths. In addition, prevention researchers have discovered strengths act as buffers against mental illness. The strengths that represent major strides in prevention include: courage, future mindedness, optimism, faith, work ethic, hope, honesty, perseverance, and the capacity for flow and insight.&lt;ref name=PennUniPPC/&gt;}}

[[File:Dalai Lama and Seattle Mayor Norm Rice, 1993.jpg|thumb|right|According to Peterson, the Buddhist saying that "life is suffering" can be understood as a reality that humans must accept, as well as a call to cultivate virtues.]]
In reference to the Buddhist saying "Life is suffering", researcher and clinical psychologist [[Jordan Peterson]] suggested this view as realistic, not pessimistic, where acceptance of the reality life is harsh, provides a freedom from the expectation one should always be happy. This realization can assist in the management of inevitable suffering. To Peterson, virtues are important because they provide people with essential tools to escape suffering (e.g., the strength to admit [[cognitive dissonance|dissonant]] truths to themselves). Peterson maintained suffering is made worse by false philosophy (i.e., denial that natural suffering is inevitable).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvo.org/TVO/WebObjects/TVO.woa?videoid%3F713852509001 |title=TVO.ORG &amp;#124; Video &amp;#124; TVO – Jordan Peterson on The Necessity of Virtue |publisher=TVO |date=2011-01-14 |accessdate=2011-02-07 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[Martin Seligman|Seligman]] believes positive psychology is "not a luxury", saying "most of Positive Psychology is for all of us, troubled or untroubled, privileged or in privation, suffering or carefree. The pleasures of a good conversation, the strength of gratitude, the benefits of kindness or wisdom or spirituality or humility, the search for meaning and the antidote to "fidgeting until we die" are the birthrights of us all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.authentichappiness.sas.upenn.edu/newsletter.aspx?id=52 |title=Martin P Seligman.

Positive coping is defined as "a response aimed at diminishing the physical, emotional, and psychological burden that is linked to stressful life events and daily hassles"&lt;ref name="Snyder, C. R. 1999 pp. 3-19"&gt;Snyder, C. R., &amp; Dinoff, B. L. (1999). Coping: Where have you been? In C. R. Snyder (Ed.), ''Coping: The psychology of what works'' (pp. 3–19). New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It is found that proper coping strategies will reduce the burden of short-term stress and will help relieve long-term stress. Stress can be reduced by building resources that inhibit or buffer future challenges. For some people, these effective resources could be physiological, psychological or social.&lt;ref name="Snyder, C. R. 1999 pp. 3-19"/&gt;

=== Terror management ===
[[Terror management theory]] maintains that people suffer [[cognitive dissonance]] (anxiety) when they are reminded of their inevitable death. Through terror management, individuals are motivated to seek consonant elements – symbols which make sense of mortality and death in satisfactory ways (i.e. boosting self-esteem).

Research has found that strong belief in religious ''or'' secular meaning systems affords psychological security and hope. It is moderates (e.g. agnostics, slightly religious individuals) who likely suffer the most anxiety from their meaning systems. Religious meaning systems are especially adapted to manage anxiety about death or dying because they are unlikely to be disconfirmed (for various reasons), they are all encompassing, and they promise literal immortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vail KE, Rothschild ZK, Weise DR, Solomon S, Pyszczynski T, Greenberg J | title = A terror management analysis of the psychological functions of religion | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Review | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 84–94 | date = February 2010 | pmid = 19940284 | doi = 10.1177/1088868309351165 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://doubtreligion.blogspot.com/2011/03/episode-81-sacrificial-lambs.html|title=Reasonable Doubts: Episode 81 Sacrificial Lambs|author=Fletcher|work=doubtreligion.blogspot.com}}{{self-published inline|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether emotional effects are beneficial or adverse seems to vary with the nature of the belief. Belief in a benevolent God is associated with lower incidence of general anxiety, social anxiety, paranoia, obsession, and compulsion whereas belief in a punitive God is associated with greater symptoms. (An alternative explanation is that people seek out beliefs that fit their psychological and emotional states.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Silton NR, Flannelly KJ, Galek K, Ellison CG | title = Beliefs about God and mental health among American adults | journal = Journal of Religion and Health | volume = 53 | issue = 5 | pages = 1285–96 | date = October 2014 | pmid = 23572240 | doi = 10.1007/s10943-013-9712-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Citizens of the world's poorest countries are the most likely to be religious, and researchers suggest this is because of religion's powerful coping abilities.&lt;ref name=GallupE&gt;[http://www.gallup.com/poll/142727/religiosity-highest-world-poorest-nations.aspx Religiosity Highest in World's Poorest Nations], Gallup Global Reports, August 31, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gallup.com/poll/116449/Religion-Provides-Emotional-Boost-World-Poor.aspx Religion Provides Emotional Boost to World’s Poor], Gallup Global Reports, March 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Luke Galen also supports terror management theory as a partial explanation of the above findings.

The capacity for loving attachments and relationships, especially with parents, is the strongest predictor of well-being later in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vaillant|first1=George E. | name-list-format = vanc |authorlink1=George Eman Vaillant|title=Triumphs of Experience|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674067424|page=191|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pPobx78zuj8C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA191#v=onepage&amp;q=loving%20relationship&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 April 2017|language=en|date=2012-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marriage ===
[[Martin Seligman|Seligman]] writes: "Unlike money, which has at most a small effect, marriage is robustly related to happiness... In my opinion, the [[Correlation does not imply causation|jury is still out on what causes]] the proven fact married people are happier than unmarried people." (pp.&amp;nbsp;55–56&lt;ref name="Seligman2002"/&gt;). Married persons report higher levels of happiness and well-being than single people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Orden SR, Bradburn NM |title=Dimensions of Marriage Happiness |journal=American Journal of Sociology |volume=73 |issue=6 |pages=715–731 |date=May 1968 |jstor=2775777 |doi=10.1086/224565}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other data has shown a spouse's happiness depends on the happiness of their partner. When asked, spouses reported similar happiness levels to each other. The data also shows the spouses' happiness level fluctuates similarly to one another. If the husband is having a bad week, the wife will similarly report she had a bad week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hoppmann CA, Gerstorf D, Willis SL, Schaie KW | title = Spousal interrelations in happiness in the Seattle Longitudinal Study: considerable similarities in levels and change over time | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 47 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–8 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 21038942 | pmc = 3133667 | doi = 10.1037/a0020788 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is little data on alternatives like [[polyamory]], although one study stated wife order in polygyny did not have a substantial effect on life or marital satisfaction over all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gwanfogbe PN, Schumm WR, Smith M, Furrow JL |title=Polygyny and marital/life satisfaction: An exploratory study from rural Cameroon |journal=Journal of Comparative Family Studies |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=55–71  |date=January 1997|jstor=41603479}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study also found younger wives were happier than older wives.

On the other hand, at least one large study in Germany found no difference in happiness between married and unmarried people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200303/marriage-is-not-the-key-happiness|title=&lt;/font&gt;Marriage Is Not the Key to Happiness| first = Anne | last = Becker | name-list-format = vanc |work=Psychology Today|date=March 18, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have shown that married couples are consistently happier and more satisfied with their life than those who are single.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Diener E, Suh EM |year=2000|title=Culture and subjective well-being|location=&lt;/font&gt;Cambridge, MA|publisher=MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some research findings have indicated that marriage is the only real significant bottom-up predictor of life satisfaction for men and women, and that those people who have a higher life satisfaction prior to marriage, tend to have a happier marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Diener, M., &amp; Diener McGavran, M.

Larsen|title=The science of subjective well-being|pages=347–375|location=New York|publisher=Guilford Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-reported satisfaction typically drops as the years of marriage roll on, particularly for couples who have children compared to those who do not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/meet-catch-and-keep/201710/defy-the-odds-heres-how-keep-your-relationship-happy|title=Defy the Odds: Here's How to Keep Your Relationship Happy|website=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons for this decline include a drop in affectionate behaviour. One team of researcher from Northwestern University who summarised the literature in 2013, identifies that this trend does not reverse throughout the marital period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/eli-finkel/documents/InPress_FinkelSlotterLuchiesWaltonGross_PSci_000.pdf |title=A Brief Intervention to Promote Conflict Reappraisal Preserves Marital Quality Over Time |website=faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surprisingly, there has been a steady decline in the positive relationship between marriage and well-being in the United States since the 1970s. This decline is due to women reporting being less happy than previously and single men reporting being happier than previously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Glenn ND, Weaver CN | year = 1988 | title = The changing relationship of marital status to reported happiness | url = | journal = Journal of Marriage and the Family | volume = 50 | issue = 2| pages = 317–324 | doi=10.2307/351999| jstor = 351999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research does exist, however, suggesting that compared to single people, married people have better physical and psychological health and tend to live longer.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.socec.2005.11.043 |title=Does marriage make people happy, or do happy people get married? |journal=The Journal of Socio-Economics |volume=35 |issue=2 |page=326 |year=2006 |last1=Stutzer |first1=Alois |last2=Frey |first2=Bruno S  | name-list-format = vanc  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With this, a two-factor theory of love was developed by Barnes and Sternberg. This theory is composed of two components: passionate love and companionate love. Passionate love is considered to be an intense longing for a loved one. This love is often experienced through joy and sexual fulfillment, or even through rejection. On the other hand, companionate love is associated with affection, friendship and commitment. Stutzer and Frey (2006) found that the absence of loneliness and the emotional support that promotes self-esteem are both important aspects that contribute to individual well-being within marriage.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Both passionate and companionate love are the foundations for every variety of love that one may experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Barnes ML, Sternberg RJ | year=1997|contribution=A hierarchical model of love and its prediction of satisfaction in close relationships|editors=R. J. Sternberg &amp; M. Hojjatt|title=Satisfaction in close relationships|pages=79–101|location=New York|publisher=Guilford Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; When passionate and companionate love are compromised in a marital relationship, satisfaction is decreased and the likelihood of divorce increases.&lt;ref name=pmid26168263&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sullivan KT, Pasch LA, Lawrence E, Bradbury TN | title = Physical aggression, compromised social support, and 10-year marital outcomes: Testing a relational spillover model | journal = Journal of Family Psychology | volume = 29 | issue = 6 | pages = 931–7 | date = December 2015 | pmid = 26168263 | doi = 10.1037/fam0000125 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the lack of positive support and validation increases the risk for divorce.

Because of the expansive research done on the significance of social support within a marriage, it is important to understand that this research was inspired by a theory called the attachment theory perspective. Attachment theory stresses the importance of support and care giving in a relationship for the development of trust and security. Attachment theory, as conceptualized by Collins and Feeney (2000) is an interpersonal, transactional process that involves one partners caregiving responses.&lt;ref name=pmid10870908&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Collins NL, Feeney BC | title = A safe haven: an attachment theory perspective on support seeking and caregiving in intimate relationships | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 78 | issue = 6 | pages = 1053–73 | date = June 2000 | pmid = 10870908 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.78.6.1053 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Parenthood ===
While the mantle of parenting is sometimes held as the necessary path of adulthood, study findings are actually mixed as to whether parents report higher levels of happiness relative to non-parents. Folk wisdom suggests a child brings partners closer; research has found couples actually become less satisfied after the birth of the first child.&lt;ref name=Twenge03&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1741-3737.2003.00574.x |title=Parenthood and Marital Satisfaction: A Meta-Analytic Review |journal=Journal of Marriage and Family |volume=65 |issue=3 |page=574 |year=2003 |last1=Twenge |first1=Jean M |last2=Campbell |first2=W. Keith |last3=Foster |first3=Craig A  |name-list-format = vanc  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The joys of having a child are overshadowed by the responsibilities of parenthood.&lt;ref name=Evenson05&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Evenson RJ, Simon RW | title = Clarifying the relationship between parenthood and depression | journal = Journal of Health and Social Behavior | volume = 46 | issue = 4 | pages = 341–58 | date = December 2005 | pmid = 16433280 | doi = 10.1177/002214650504600403 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on quantitative self-reports, researchers found parents prefer doing almost anything else to looking after their children. By contrast, parents' self-report levels of happiness are higher than those of non-parents. This may be due to already happy people having more children than unhappy people. In addition, it might also be that, in the long-term, having children gives more meaning to life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

By contrast, many studies found having children makes parents less happy. Compared with non-parents, parents with children have lower levels of well-being and life satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Umberson D, Gove W |title=Parenthood and psychological well-being: theory, measurement, and stage in the family life course |journal=Journal of Family Issues |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=440–462 |year=1989 |doi=10.1177/019251389010004002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, parents report more feelings of depression&lt;ref name=Evenson05/&gt; and anxiety&lt;ref name=McLanahan87&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McLanahan S, Adams J |title=Parenthood and psychological well-being |journal=Annual Review of Sociology |volume=13 |pages=237–257 |year=1987 |jstor=2083248 |doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.13.1.237}}&lt;/ref&gt; than non-parents. However, when adults without children are compared to empty nest parents, parenthood is positively associated with emotional well-being.&lt;ref name=Evenson05/&gt; People found parenthood to be more stressful in the 1970s than they did in the 1950s. This is thought to be because of social changes in regards to employment and marital status.&lt;ref name=McLanahan87/&gt;

Males apparently become less happy after the birth of a child due to added economic pressure and taking on the role of being a parent.&lt;ref name=Twenge03/&gt; A conflict between partners can arise when the couple does not desire traditional roles, or has an increasing number of roles.&lt;ref name=Twenge03/&gt; Unequal responsibilities of child-rearing between men and women account for this difference in satisfaction. Fathers who worked and shared an equal part in child-raising responsibilities were found to be the least satisfied.&lt;ref&gt;Ferri, E., Smith, K. (1996). ''Parenting in the 1990s''. London: Family Policy Studies Centre.&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that single parents have higher levels of distress and report more mental health problems than married persons.&lt;ref name=Evenson05/&gt;

Researchers implemented the Huta &amp; Ryan Scale: Four Eudaimonic Measurement Questionnaire to analyze the participants eudaimonic motives, through motivation towards activities. The investigation was conducted on Canadian university undergraduates. The four eudaimonic pursuits as described by Huta &amp; Ryan are: 
# "Seeking to pursue excellence or a personal ideal" 
# "Seeking to use the best in yourself" 
# "Seeking to develop a skill, learn, or gain insight into something" 
# "Seeking to do what you believe in".&lt;ref name="Huta"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huta|first1=Veronika|title=Huta, Veronika. "Linking Peoples' Pursuit of Eudaimonia and Hedonia with Characteristics of Their Parents: Parenting Styles, Verbally Endorsed Values, and Role Modeling. |journal=Journal of Happiness|date=2011|volume=13|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study determined that participants derived well-being from eudaimonic pursuits only if their parents had role modeled eudaimonia, but not if their parents had merely verbally endorsed eudaimonia.&lt;ref name="Huta"/&gt;

Studies were also conducted on responsiveness and demandingness. The studies participants were American university undergraduates. The terms are described as follows; responsiveness satisfies the basic psychological need for autonomy. This is relevant to eudaimonia because it supports and implements the values of initiative, effort, and persistence, and integration of one's behaviour's values, and true-self. Autonomy is an important psychological factor because it provides the individual with independence. Demandingness cultivates many of the qualities needed for eudaimonia, including structure, self-discipline, responsibility, and vision. Responsiveness and demandingness are reported to be good aspects of parenting. The studies report both of these qualities as important factors to well-being.&lt;ref name="Huta"/&gt;

The study addressed parenting style by assessing and using adaptions of Baumrind's Parent Behaviour Rating Interview. Adaptions of this interview were made into a seventy-five question based survey; participants answered questions organized into fifteen subscales. The study determined that eudaimonically oriented participants reported their parents had been both demanding and responsive towards them. A [[multiple regression]] showed that demandingness and responsiveness together explained as much as twenty-eight percent of the variance in eudaimonia, this suggests parenting played a major role in the development of this pursuit. This supported the expectation that eudaimonia is cultivated when parents encourage internal structure, self-discipline, responsibility, and vision, and simultaneously fulfill a child's needs for autonomy. The research concludes that parents who want their children to experience eudaimonia must firstly themselves "mentor" their children in the approaches to attain eudaimonia. To encourage eudaimonia verbally is not sufficient enough to suffice eudaimonia into adulthood. Parents must clearly role model eudaimonia for it to truly be present in the child's life.&lt;ref name="Seligman_2011"/&gt;

=== Social ties ===
In the article "Finding Happiness after Harvard", [[George Eman Vaillant|George Vaillant]] concluded a study on what aspects of life are important for "successful living". In the 1940s, Arlie Bock, while in charge of the Harvard Health Services, started a study, selecting 268 Harvard students from graduating classes of 1942, '43, and '44. He sought to identify the aspects of life contributing to "successful living". In 1967, the psychiatrist George Vaillant continued the study, undertaking follow-up interviews to gauge the lives of many of the students. In 2000, Vaillant again interviewed these students as to their progress in life. Vaillant observed: health, close relationships, and how participants dealt with their troubles. Vaillant found a key aspect to successful living is healthy and strong relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shenk J |title=Finding happiness After Harvard |journal=Wilson Quarterly |volume=33 |pages=73–74 |date=Autumn 2009 |url=http://www.wilsonquarterly.com/article.cfm?AT=0&amp;AID=1501 |access-date=2017-06-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121027190526/http://www.wilsonquarterly.com/article.cfm?AT=0&amp;AID=1501# |archive-date=2012-10-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A widely publicized study from 2008 in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' reported happiness in [[social network]]s may spread from person to person.&lt;ref name=Fowler08&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fowler JH, Christakis NA | title = Dynamic spread of happiness in a large social network: longitudinal analysis over 20 years in the Framingham Heart Study | journal = BMJ | volume = 337 | issue = 768 | pages = a2338 | date = December 2008 | pmid = 19056788 | pmc = 2600606 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.a2338 | author1-link = James H. Fowler }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers followed nearly 5000 individuals for 20 years in the long-standing [[Framingham Heart Study]] and found clusters of happiness and unhappiness that spread up to 3 degrees of separation on average. Happiness tended to spread through close relationships like friends, siblings, spouses, and next-door neighbors; researchers reported happiness spread more consistently than unhappiness through the network. Moreover, the structure of the social network appeared to affect happiness, as people who were very central (with many friends, and friends of friends) were significantly happier than those on the network periphery. People closer with others are more likely to be happy themselves.&lt;ref name=Fowler08/&gt; Overall, the results suggest happiness can spread through a population like a virus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/05/health/05happy-web.html|title=Strangers May Cheer You Up, Study Says  |publisher=New York Times|date=December 5, 2008 | first=Pam | last=Belluck | name-list-format = vanc |access-date=2010-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rob Stein,[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/04/AR2008120403537.html "Happiness Can Spread Among People Like a Contagion, Study Indicates,"] ''[[The Washington Post]]'', December 5, 2008, Page A08&lt;/ref&gt; Having a best friend buffers one's negative life experiences.

Neuroeconomist Paul Zak studies morality, oxytocin, and trust, among other variables. Based on research findings, Zak recommends: people hug others more often to get into the habit of feeling trust. He explains "eight hugs a day, you'll be happier, and the world will be a better place".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/paul_zak_trust_morality_and_oxytocin.html|title=Trust, morality -- and oxytocin?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, Anderson et al. found that [[sociometric status]] (the amount of respect one has from face-to-face peer group) is significantly and causally related to happiness as measured by [[subjective well-being]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Anderson C, Kraus MW, Galinsky AD, Keltner D | title = The local-ladder effect: social status and subjective well-being | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 23 | issue = 7 | pages = 764–71 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 22653798 | doi = 10.1177/0956797611434537 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Institutional factors ==

=== Education ===

==== Education and intelligence ====
Research suggests neither a good education nor a high IQ reliably increases happiness.&lt;ref name=NYSciHap&gt;{{cite news |last=Wallis |first=Claudia | name-list-format = vanc  | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1015902-1,00.html |title=Science of Happiness: New Research on Mood, Satisfaction |publisher=TIME |date=2005-01-09 |accessdate=2011-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101115020515/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C1015902-1%2C00.html |archivedate=2010-11-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Anders Ericsson]] argued an IQ above 120 has a decreasing influence on success. Presumably, IQs above 120 do not additionally cause other happiness indicators like success (with the exception of careers like [[Theoretical physics]], where high IQs are more predictive of success). Above that IQ level, other factors, like social skills and a good mentor, matter more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Making of an Expert

[[Martin Seligman]] has said: "As a professor, I don't like this, but the cerebral virtues—curiosity, love of learning—are less strongly tied to happiness than interpersonal virtues like kindness, gratitude and capacity for love."&lt;ref name=NYSciHap/&gt;

=== Educational goals ===
John White (2013) investigated the educational goals at public schools in Britain. School-education involves both cognitive and conceptual [[learning]], but also the development social skills and personal development. Ideally, children develop self-confidence, and create purpose for themselves. According to White, in the past schools only focused on [[knowledge]] and [[education]] but now [[United Kingdom|Britain]] has moved to a broader direction. White's Every Child Matters initiative seeks to enhance children's well-being across the range of children's services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=White|first=John| name-list-format = vanc |title=Education in Well-Being|journal=The Oxford handbook of happiness|pages=540–550}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Physical education ====
As a basic building block to a better existence, positive psychology aims to improve the quality of experiences. Within its framework, students could learn to become excited about physical activity. Playing comes natural to children; positive psychology seeks to preserve this zest (a sense of excitement and motivation for life)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.positive-living-now.com/increase-your-happiness-add-some-zest-to-your-life/|title = Increase your happiness: add some zest to your life|date = January 18, 2013|accessdate = April 6, 2015|website = Positive-Living-Now|publisher = |last = Minarik|first = Susan K.}}&lt;/ref&gt; for movement in growing and developing children. If offered in an interesting, challenging and pleasurable way physical activity would thus internalize an authentic feeling of happiness in students. Positive psychology's approach to physical activity could give students the means of acquiring an engaged, pleasant and meaningful life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cherubini|first=Jeffrey| name-list-format = vanc |title=Positive Psychology and Quality Physical Education|journal=Journal of Physical Education, Recreation &amp; Dance|date=September 2009|volume=80|issue=7|pages=42–47, 51|doi=10.1080/07303084.2009.10598356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== School education ====
&lt;!-- I don't object to the addition of this study, but it is not appropriately concise, and should accordingly be drastically cut down. --&gt;
Positive psychology is beneficial to schools and students because it encourages individuals to strive to do their best, whereas scolding has the opposite effect. Clifton and Rath&lt;ref name="Clifton, D 2005, pp. 47-51"&gt;Clifton, D, Rath, T 2005, ‘Every moment matters’, How full is your bucket? Positive strategies for work and life, Gallup Press, New York, pp. 47–51&lt;/ref&gt; discussed research conducted by Dr. Elizabeth Hurlock in 1925, where fourth, fifth and sixth graders were either praised, criticized or ignored, based on their work on math problems. Praised students improved by 71%, those criticized improved by 19%, and students provided with no feedback improved a mere 5%. Praise seems an effective method of fostering improvement.

According to Clifton and Rath&lt;ref name="Clifton, D 2005, pp. 47-51"/&gt; ninety nine out of one hundred people prefer the influence of positive people. The benefits include: increased productivity, and contagious positive emotions, which assists one in working to the best of her, or his, abilities. Even a single negative person can ruin the entire positive vibe in an environment. Clifton and Rath&lt;ref name="Clifton, D 2005, pp. 47-51"/&gt; cited ‘positive emotions as an essential daily requirement for survival’.

In 2008, in conjunction with the Positive Psychology Center at the University of Pennsylvania, a whole-of-school implementation of Positive Psychology was undertaken by Geelong Grammar School (Victoria, Australia). This involved training of teaching staff in the principles and skills of positive psychology. Ongoing support was provided by The Positive Psychology Center staff, who remained in-residence for the entire year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Seligman M, Ernst R, Gillham J, Reivich K, Links M |title=Positive education: positive psychology and classroom interventions |journal=Oxford Review of Education |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=293–311 |year=2009 |doi=10.1080/03054980902934563 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Staats, Hupp and Hagley (2008) used positive psychology to explore academic honesty. They identified positive traits displayed by heroes, then determined if the presence of these traits in students predicted future intent to cheat. The results of their research: ‘an effective working model of heroism in the context of the academic environment’ (Staats, Hupp &amp; Hagley, 2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Staats S, Hupp JM, Hagley AM | title = Honesty and heroes: a positive psychology view of heroism and academic honesty | journal = The Journal of Psychology | volume = 142 | issue = 4 | pages = 357–72 | date = July 2008 | pmid = 18792648 | doi = 10.3200/JRLP.142.4.357-372 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== School grades of children ====
According to a study reported in the ''NY Post'' newspaper, 48% of parents reward their children's good grades with cash or something else of meaning. Among many families in the United States, this is controversial. Although psychology experts support the offer of reward for good behavior as a better alternative than the use of punishment for bad behavior, in some circumstances, families cannot afford to give their children an average of 16 dollars for every good grade earned. Alternatives for money include allowing a child extra time on a computer or staying up later than usual. Some psychology experts believe the best reward is praise and encouragement because material rewards can cause long-term negative effects for children.
 
A study, regarding rewards for children, conducted in 1971 by psychologist, Edward L. Deci, at the University of Rochester, is still referenced today. Featured in the ''New York Times'', it focused on the short- and long-term effects of rewards for positive behavior. Deci suggested rewards for positive behavior is an effective incentive for only a short period. At the outset, rewards can support motivation to work hard and strive towards personal goals. However, once rewards cease, children showed less interest in the task relative to participants who never received rewards. Deci pointed out, at a young age, children's natural instinct is to resist people who try to control their behavior, which he cited as support for his conclusion rewards for good behavior have limited effectiveness.

In contrast, the ''New York Times'' featured research findings that supported the merits of offering rewards to children for good behavior. Expert economists argued children experiencing trouble with their behavior or schoolwork should have numerous helpful options, including rewards. Although children might well experience an initial attraction to financial or material, a love for learning could develop subsequently. Despite the controversy regarding the use of rewards, some experts believe the best way to motivate a child is to offer rewards at the beginning of the school year, but if unsuccessful they recommend teachers and parents stop using the reward system. Because of individual differences among children, no one method will work for everyone. Some children respond well to the use of rewards for positive behavior, while others evidence negative effects. The results seem to depend on the person.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==== Youth development ====
[[Positive Youth Development]] focuses on the promotion of healthy development rather than viewing youth as prone to problems needing to be addressed. This is accomplished through programs and efforts by communities, schools, and government agencies.&lt;ref name="website- Aspe.hhs.gov"&gt;{{cite web|title=Positive Youth Development in the U.S.: Research Findings on Evaluations of Positive Youth Development Programs|url=http://aspe.hhs.gov/HSP/PositiveYouthDev99/index.htm|accessdate=April 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Work ===
{{Main|Happiness at work}}

It has been argued that [[happiness at work]] is one of the driving forces behind positive outcomes at work, rather than just being a resultant product.&lt;ref name="Boehm &amp; Lyubomirsky 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Boehm JK, Lyubomirsky S |title=Does Happiness Promote Career Success? |journal=Journal of Career Assessment |volume=16 |issue=1 |year=2008 |pages=101–16 |doi=10.1177/1069072707308140 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite a large body of positive [[psychological research]] into the relationship between happiness and productivity,&lt;ref name="test3"&gt;Carr, A.: "Positive Psychology: The Science of Happiness and Human Strengths" Hove, Brunner-Routledge 2004{{page needed|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="test4"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Isen |first1=A. |chapter=Positive Affect and Decision-making |editor1-first=Michael |editor1-last=Lewis |editor2-first=Jeannette M. |editor2-last=Haviland-Jones | name-list-format = vanc |title=Handbook of Emotions |edition=2nd  |pages=417–36 |location=New York |publisher=Guilford Press |year=2000 |isbn=978-1-57230-529-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid11392858&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Buss DM | title = The evolution of happiness | journal = The American Psychologist | volume = 55 | issue = 1 | pages = 15–23 | date = January 2000 | pmid = 11392858 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.55.1.15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; happiness at work has traditionally been seen as a potential by-product of positive outcomes at work, rather than a pathway to success in business. However a growing number of scholars, including Boehm and Lyubomirsky, argue that it should be viewed as one of the major sources of positive outcomes in the workplace.&lt;ref name="Boehm &amp; Lyubomirsky 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid16351326&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lyubomirsky S, King L, Diener E | title = The benefits of frequent positive affect: does happiness lead to success? | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 131 | issue = 6 | pages = 803–55 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16351326 | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.131.6.803 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Human Resource Management ====
A practical application of positive psychology is to assist individuals and organizations in identifying strengths so as to increase and sustain well-being. Therapists, counselors, coaches, various psychological professionals, HR departments, business strategists, and others, are using new methods and techniques to broaden and build upon the strengths of a wide population of individuals. This includes those not suffering from mental illness or disorder. &lt;!-- The phrase "broaden and build" is a reference to the prominent positive psychology theory of Barbara Fredrickson. --&gt;

==== Workplace ====
{{main|Positive psychology in the workplace}}
Positive psychology has been implemented in business management practice, but has faced challenges. Wong &amp; Davey (2007)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.regent.edu/acad/global/publications/sl_proceedings/2007/wong-davey.pdf |title=Wong &amp; Davey (2007) |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; noted managers can introduce positive psychology to a workplace, but they might struggle with positive ways to apply it to employees. Furthermore, for employees to welcome and commit to positive psychology, its application within an organization must be transparent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=P. Alex |last1=Linley |first2=Susan |last2=Harrington  | name-list-format = vanc  |title=Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology and Work |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JR51T4KHf3AC&amp;pg=PA327 |year=2010 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-533544-6 |page=327}}&lt;/ref&gt; Managers must also understand the implementation of positive psychology will not necessarily combat any commitment challenges that exist. However, with its implementation employees might become more optimistic and open to new concepts or management practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pambritton.com/what-is-happiness-psychology-and-why-should-smart-entrepreneurs-care/|title=What Is Happiness Psychology and Why Should Smart Entrepreneurs Care?|last=Britton|first=Pam| name-list-format = vanc |accessdate=11 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their article "The Benefits of Frequent Positive Affect: Does Happiness Lead to Success?",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lyubomirsky S, King L, Diener E | title = The benefits of frequent positive affect: does happiness lead to success? | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 131 | issue = 6 | pages = 803–55 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16351326 | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.131.6.803 | url = http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/bul-1316803.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; S. Lyubomirsky et al. report: "Study after study shows that happiness precedes important outcomes and indicators of thriving, including fulfilling and productive work".

Positive psychology, when applied correctly, can provide employees with a greater opportunity to use skills and vary work duties. However, changing work conditions and roles can lead to stress among employees if they are improperly supported by management. This is particularly true for employees who must meet the expectations of organizations with unrealistic goals and targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Snyder, C &amp; Lopez, J.|year=2002|title= Handbook of Positive Psychology|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=http://www.deakin.eblib.com.au/patron/FullRecord.aspx?p=271581&amp;userid=WEAuOX57P1tMHeNgDQM4dA%3d%3d&amp;tstamp=1273278299&amp;id=9E207671A9591844A5DE424F74A348322954B1F4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas and Tasker (2010) showed less worker autonomy, fewer opportunities for development, less-enriched work roles, and lower levels of supervisor support reflected the effect of industry growth on job satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thomas JC, Tasker TE | year = 2010 | title = Life, liberty, work, and the pursuit of happiness | url = | journal = Psyccritiques | volume = 55 | issue = 51| pages = | doi = 10.1037/a0022089 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Can an organization implement positive change? Lewis et al. (2007) developed [[appreciative inquiry]] (AI), which is an integrated, organizational-level methodology for approaching [[organizational development]]. Appreciative inquiry is based on the generation of organizational resourcefulness, which is accomplished by accessing a variety of human psychological processes, such as: positive emotional states, imagination, social cohesion, and the social construction of reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lewis S, Passmore J, Cantore S |title=Positive psychology and managing change |journal=The Psychologist |volume=21 |issue=11 |pages=932–4 |year=2008 |doi= |url=http://www.mendeley.com/research/positive-psychology-managing-change/#}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A relatively new practice in the workplace is recruiting and developing people based on their strengths (what they love to do, are naturally good at and energises them). Standard Chartered Bank pioneered this approach in the early 2000s. More and more organisations are realising the benefit of recruiting people who are in their element in the job as opposed to simply having the right competencies for the job. Aviva, Morrisons (a large UK supermarket) and Starbucks have all adopted this approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://engagingminds.co.uk/sbr/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/How-strengths-based-recruitment-transforms-organisations.pdf|title=How Strengths-based Recruitment Transforms Organisations|work=engagingminds.co.uk|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist [[Howard Gardner]] has extensively researched the merit of undertaking good work at one's job. He suggested young generations (particularly in the United States) are taught to focus on the selfish pursuit of money for its own sake, although having money does not engender happiness, and psychological studies show that there is a strong correlation between the wealthy and experience of intensively negative emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.webmd.com/balance/news/20060630/study-money-wont-make-you-happy|title=Study: Money Won't Make You Happy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gardner's proposed alternatives loosely follow the pleasant/good/meaningful life classifications outlined above; he believes young people should be trained to pursue excellence in their field, as well as engagement (see flow, above) in accordance with their moral belief systems.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Gardner, TVOpodcast ''Excellence in education'', http://www.tvo.org/TVOsites/WebObjects/TvoMicrosite.woa?bi?1260050400000&lt;/ref&gt;

== Societal factors ==
[[File:Child well-being is better in more equal rich countries.jpg|thumb|Child well-being is better in more equal rich countries.]]

=== Criminology ===

==== Offender rehabilitation ====
Traditional work with offenders has focused on their deficits (e.g., with respect to socialization, and schooling) and other "criminogenic" risk-factors. Rehabilitation more often than not has taken the form of forced treatment or training, ostensibly for the good of the offender, and the community. Arguably, this approach has shortcomings, suggesting a need to make available additional positive options to treatment staff so they can best assist offenders, and so that offenders can better find their way forward. Positive psychology has made recent inroads with the advent of the "Good Lives Model", developed by Tony Ward, Shadd Maruna, and others. With respect to rehabilitation: "Individuals take part ... because they think that such activities might either improve the quality of their life (an intrinsic goal) or at least look good to judges, parole boards and family members (an extrinsic goal)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Tony | last1 = Ward | first2 = Shadd | last2 = Maruna  | name-list-format = vanc |title=Rehabilitation|location=London, New York|publisher=Routledge |year=2007|page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Positive criminology and positive victimology ====
[[Positive criminology]] and positive victimology are conceptual approaches, developed by the Israeli criminologist Natti Ronel and his research team, that follow principles of positive psychology and apply them into the fields of criminology and victimology, respectively. Positive criminology and victimology both place an emphasis on social inclusion and on unifying and integrating forces at individual, group, social and spiritual levels that are associated with the limiting of crime and recovery from victimization. In traditional approaches the study of crime, violence and related behaviors emphasizes the negative aspects in people's lives that are associated with deviance, criminality and victimization. A common understanding is that human relationships are affected more by destructive encounters than by constructive or positive ones. Positive criminology and victimology argue that a different approach is viable, based on three dimensions – social integration, emotional healing and spirituality – that constitute positive direction indicators.

=== Economics ===
{{merge|Happiness_economics|discuss=Talk:Happiness_economics#Merger proposal|date=April 2018}}
In [[economics]], the term well-being is used for one or more [[Numerical data|quantitative]] measures intended to assess the [[quality of life]] of a group, for example, in the [[capabilities approach]] and the [[Happiness economics|economics of happiness]]. As with the related [[cognate]] terms '[[wealth]]' and 'welfare', economics sources often contrast the state with its opposite.&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of Economic Literature'' [[JEL classification codes#Health, education, and welfare JEL: I Subcategories|Health, education, and welfare JEL: I Subcategories]] at JEL: I3 - Welfare and Poverty.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Adam Smith]], 1776.

=== Political views ===
Psychologists in the happiness community feel politics should promote population happiness. Politics should also consider level of human happiness among future generations, concern itself with life expectancy, and focus on the reduction of suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brülde B |title=Happiness, Morality, and Politics |journal=Journal of Happiness Studies |volume=11 |issue=5 |pages=567–583 |date=October 2010 |doi=10.1007/s10902-010-9207-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on political affiliation, some studies argue conservatives, on average, are happier than liberals.

== Cultural factors ==
{{main|Culture and positive psychology}}

=== Culture ===
People base their own well-being in relation to their environment and the lives of others around them. Well-being is also subject to how one feels other people in their environment perceive them, whether that positively or negatively. Whether or not other cultures are subject to internal culture appraisal is based on that culture's type. According to Diener and Suh,
{{quote|[[Collectivistic]] cultures are more likely to use norms and the social appraisals of others in evaluating their subjective well-being, whereas those [individualistic] societies are more likely to heavily weight the internal [frame of reference] arising from one’s own happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Diener|first1=Ed|last2=Suh|first2=Eunkook M. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Culture and subjective well-being|date=2003|publisher=MIT|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=978-0-262-54146-6|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Different views on well-being ===
Various cultures have various perspectives on the nature of positive human functioning. For example, studies on [[aversion to happiness]], or fear of happiness, indicates that some individuals and cultures are averse to the experience of happiness, because they believe happiness may cause bad things to happen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Joshanloo|first1=Mohsen|last2=Weijers|first2=Dan | name-list-format = vanc |title=Aversion to Happiness Across Cultures: A Review of Where and Why People are Averse to Happiness|journal=Journal of Happiness Studies|date=15 December 2013|volume=15|issue=3|pages=717–735|doi=10.1007/s10902-013-9489-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Empirical evidence indicates that there are fundamental differences in the ways well-being is construed in Western and non-Western cultures, including the Islamic and East Asian cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Joshanloo|first1=Mohsen|title=A Comparison of Western and Islamic Conceptions of Happiness|journal=Journal of Happiness Studies|date=15 December 2012|volume=14|issue=6|pages=1857–1874|doi=10.1007/s10902-012-9406-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exploring various cultural perspectives on well-being, Joshanloo (2014) identifies and discusses six broad differences between Western and non-Western conceptions of well-being. For example, whereas Western cultures tend to emphasize the absence of negative emotions and autonomy in defining well-being, Eastern cultures tend to emphasize virtuous or religious activity, self-transcendence, and harmony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Joshanloo|first1=Mohsen|title=Eastern Conceptualizations of Happiness: Fundamental Differences with Western Views|journal=Journal of Happiness Studies|date=21 March 2013|volume=15|issue=2|pages=475–493|doi=10.1007/s10902-013-9431-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eunkook M. Suh (University of California) and Shigehiro Oishi (University of Minnesota; now at University of Virginia) examined the differences of happiness on an international level and different cultures' views on what creates well-being and happiness. In a study, of over 6,000 students from 43 nations, to identify mean life satisfaction, on a scale of 1–7, the Chinese ranked lowest at 3.3; and Dutch scored the highest at 5.4. When asked how much subjective well-being was ideal, Chinese ranked lowest at 4.5, and Brazilians highest at 6.2, on a scale of 1–7. The study had three main findings: (1) People living in individualistic, rather than collectivist, societies are happier; (2) Psychological attributes referencing the individual are more relevant to Westerners; (3) Self-evaluating happiness levels depend on different cues, and experiences, from one's culture.&lt;ref name="free-books-online.org"&gt;{{cite web| vauthors = Eunkook S |year=2002|title=Subjective Well-Being Across Cultures|accessdate= November 23, 2012|url=http://free-books-online.org/psychology/cross-cultural-psychology/subjective-well-being-across-cultures/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110408081703/http://free-books-online.org/psychology/cross-cultural-psychology/subjective-well-being-across-cultures/|archivedate=April 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The results of a study by Chang E. C. showed that Asian Americans and Caucasian Americans have similar levels of optimism but Asian Americans are far more pessimistic than Caucasian Americans. However, there were no major differences in depression across cultures. On the other hand, pessimism was positively linked to [[problem solving]] behaviors for Asian Americans, but was negatively linked for Caucasian Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Lopez SJ, Snyder CR | title = The Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2009 | page = 53 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religion and spirituality ===
Religiousness and spirituality are closely related but distinct topics. [[Religion]] is any organized, and often [[Institutionalisation|institutionalized]], system of cultural practices and beliefs pertaining to the meaning of human existence. It occurs within a traditional context such as a formal religious institution.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;[[Raymond Paloutzian|Paloutzian, R. F.]], &amp; Park, C. L. (Eds.). (2005). Handbook of the psychology of religion and spirituality. New York, NY, US: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spirituality]], on the other hand, is a general term applied to the process of finding meaning and a better understanding of one's place in the universe. It is the individual or collective search for that which is sacred or meaningful in life.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = George LK, Larson DB, Koenig HG, McCullough ME | year = 2000 | title = Spirituality and health: What we know, what we need to know | url = | journal = Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology | volume = 19 | issue = 1| pages = 102–116 | doi=10.1521/jscp.2000.19.1.102}}&lt;/ref&gt; One may therefore be religious but not spiritual, and vice versa.

==== Religion ====
{{see also|Psychology of religion|}}

There have been some studies of how [[Religion and happiness|religion relates to happiness]]. Causal relationships remain unclear, but more religion is seen in happier people. Consistent with PERMA, religion may provide a sense of meaning and connection to something bigger, beyond the self. Religion may also provide community membership and hence relationships. Another component may have to do with ritual.&lt;ref&gt;2009 article in Frontiers in Evolutionary Neuroscience{{full citation needed|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religion and happiness have been studied by a number of researchers, and [[religion]] features many elements addressing the components of happiness, as identified by [[positive psychology]]. Its association with happiness is facilitated in part by the social connections of organized religion,&lt;ref name=Routledge2012&gt;{{cite web | title = Are Religious People Happier Than Non-religious People?

There are a number of mechanisms through which religion may make a person happier, including social contact and support that result from religious pursuits, the mental activity that comes with optimism and volunteering, learned coping strategies that enhance one's ability to deal with stress, and psychological factors such as "reason for being." It may also be that religious people engage in behaviors related to good health, such as less [[substance abuse]], since the use of psychotropic substances is sometimes considered abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baetz M, Toews J | title = Clinical implications of research on religion, spirituality, and mental health | journal = Canadian Journal of Psychiatry.

The ''[[Handbook of Religion and Health]]'' describes a survey by Feigelman (1992) that examined happiness in Americans who have given up religion, in which it was found that there was little relationship between religious disaffiliation and unhappiness.&lt;ref&gt;Koenig. Harold G., Larson, David B., and Mcculloug, Michael E. – ''[[Handbook of Religion and Health]]'' (see [[Handbook of Religion and Health|article]]), p. 122, Oxford University Press (2001), {{ISBN|0-8133-6719-0}}&lt;br /&gt;Feigelman et al. (1992) examined happiness in Americans who have given up religion. Using pooled data from the General Social Surveys conducted between 1972 and 1990, investigators identified more than 20,000 adults for their study. Subjects of particular interest were “disaffiliates”—those who were affiliated with a religion at age 16 but who were not affiliated at the time of the survey (disaffiliates comprised from 4.4% to 6.0% of respondents per year during the 18 years of surveys). “Actives” were defined as persons who reported a religious affiliation at age 16 and a religious affiliation at the time of the survey (these ranged from 84.7% to 79.5% of respondents per year between 1972 and 1990). Happiness was measured by a single question that assessed general happiness (very happy, pretty happy, not too happy). When disaffiliates (n = 1,420) were compared with actives (n = 21,052), 23.9% of disaffiliates indicated they were “very happy, ” as did 34.2% of actives. When the analysis was stratified by marital status, the likelihood of being very happy was about 25% lower (i.e., 10% difference) for married religious disaffiliates compared with married actives. Multiple regression analysis revealed that religious disaffiliation explained only 2% of the variance in overall happiness, after marital status and other covariates were controlled. Investigators concluded that there was little relationship between religious disaffiliation and unhappiness (quality rating 7)&lt;/ref&gt; A survey by Kosmin &amp; Lachman (1993), also cited in this handbook, indicates that people with no religious affiliation appear to be at greater risk for depressive symptoms than those affiliated with a religion.&lt;ref&gt;Koenig. Harold G., Larson, David B., and Mcculloug, Michael E. – ''[[Handbook of Religion and Health]]''(see [[Handbook of Religion and Health|article]]), p. 111, Oxford University Press (2001)&lt;br /&gt;Currently, approximately 8% of the U.S. population claim no religious affiliation (Kosmin &amp; Lachman, 1993). People with no affiliation appear to be at greater risk for depressive symptoms than those affiliated with a religion. In a sample of 850 medically ill men, Koenig, Cohen, Blazer, Pieper, et al. (1992) examined whether religious affiliation predicted depression after demographics, medical status, and a measure of religious coping were controlled. They found that, when relevant covariates were controlled, men who indicated that they had "no religious affiliation" had higher scores on the [[Hamilton Depression Rating Scale]] (an observer-administered rating scale) than did men who identified themselves as moderate Protestants, Catholics, or nontraditional Christians.&lt;/ref&gt; A review of studies by 147 independent investigators found, "the correlation between religiousness and depressive symptoms was -.096, indicating that greater religiousness is mildly associated with fewer symptoms."&lt;ref name=PsyB129 /&gt;

The [[Legatum Prosperity Index]] reflects the repeated finding of research on the science of happiness that there is a positive link between religious engagement and well-being: people who report that God is very important in their lives are on average more satisfied with their lives, after accounting for their income, age and other individual characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;The 2008 Legatum Prosperity Index, Summary p. 40.&lt;br&gt; Research suggests that religious people's happiness is less vulnerable to fluctuations in economic and political uncertainty, personal unemployment and income changes. The Prosperity Index identifies similar effects at the country level, with a number of highly religious countries reporting higher levels of happiness than might be expected based on the standard of living alone: this effect is most pronounced in Mexico, El Salvador, the Dominican republic, Indonesia, Venezuela and Nigeria.&lt;/ref&gt;

Surveys by [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]], the [[National Opinion Research Centre]] and the [[Pew Research Center|Pew Organisation]] conclude that spiritually committed people are twice as likely to report being "very happy" than the least religiously committed people.&lt;ref&gt;[[Is Religion Dangerous?]]p156, citing [[David Myers (academic)|David Myers]] ''The Science of Subjective Well-Being'' Guilford Press 2007&lt;/ref&gt; An analysis of over 200 social studies contends that "high religiousness predicts a lower risk of depression and drug abuse and fewer suicide attempts, and more reports of satisfaction with sex life and a sense of well-being.
However, the links between religion and happiness are always very broad in nature, highly reliant on scripture and small sample number. To that extent there is a much larger connection between religion and suffering (Lincoln 1034)."&lt;ref name=PsyB129&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Smith TB, McCullough ME, Poll J | title = Religiousness and depression: evidence for a main effect and the moderating influence of stressful life events | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 129 | issue = 4 | pages = 614–36 | date = July 2003 | pmid = 12848223 | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.129.4.614 }}&lt;/ref&gt; And a review of 498 studies published in peer-reviewed journals concluded that a large majority of them showed a positive correlation between religious commitment and higher levels of perceived well-being and self-esteem and lower levels of [[hypertension]], depression, and clinical delinquency.&lt;ref&gt;[[Is Religion Dangerous?]] cites similar results from the''Handbook of Religion and Mental Health'' [[Harold Koenig]] (ed.) {{ISBN|978-0-12-417645-4}}{{page needed|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A meta-analysis of 34 recent studies published between 1990 and 2001 found that religiosity has a salutary relationship with psychological adjustment, being related to less psychological distress, more life satisfaction, and better [[self-actualization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hackney |first1=Charles H. |last2=Sanders |first2=Glenn S. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Religiosity and Mental Health: A Meta-Analysis of Recent Studies |journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion |volume=42 |issue=1 |year=2003 |pages=43–55 |doi=10.1111/1468-5906.t01-1-00160 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, a recent systematic review of 850 research papers on the topic concluded that "the majority of well-conducted studies found that higher levels of religious involvement are positively associated with indicators of psychological well-being (life satisfaction, happiness, positive affect, and higher morale) and with less depression, suicidal thoughts and behaviour, drug/alcohol use/abuse."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moreira-Almeida A, Neto FL, Koenig HG | title = Religiousness and mental health: a review | journal = Revista Brasileira De Psiquiatria | volume = 28 | issue = 3 | pages = 242–50 | date = September 2006 | pmid = 16924349 | doi = 10.1590/S1516-44462006005000006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there remains strong disagreement among scholars about whether the effects of religious observance, particularly attending church or otherwise belonging to religious groups, is due to the spiritual or the social aspects—i.e. those who attend church or belong to similar religious organizations may well be receiving only the effects of the social connections involved. While these benefits are real enough, they may thus be the same one would gain by joining other, secular groups, clubs, or similar organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert D. Putnam]] makes this argument in his book (with David Campell) ''American Grace'' (New York: Simon and Schuster, 2012).{{page needed|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religiousness has often been found to correlate with positive health attributes. People who are more religious show better emotional well-being and lower rates of delinquency, alcoholism, drug abuse, and other social problems.&lt;ref name = "Donahue_1995"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Donahue MJ, Benson PL | year = 1995 | title = Religion and the well-being of adolescents | url = | journal = Journal of Social Issues | volume = 51 | issue = 2| pages = 145–160 | doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.1995.tb01328.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six separate factors are cited as evidence for religion's effect on well-being: religion (1) provides social support, (2) supports healthy lifestyles, (3) promotes personality integration, (4) promotes generativity and altruism, (5) provides unique coping strategies, and (6) provides a sense of meaning and purpose.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Emmons, R. A. (1999) ''The psychology of ultimate concerns: Motivation and spirituality in personality.'' New York: Guilford.&lt;/ref&gt; Many religious individuals experience emotions that create positive connections among people and allow them to express their values and potential. These four emotions are known as "sacred emotions," which are said to be (1) gratitude and appreciation, (2) forgiveness, (3) compassion and empathy, and (4) humility.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Emmons, R. A., (2005). Emotion and Religion. In: Handbook of the psychology of religion and spirituality. Paloutzian, Raymond F. (Ed), Park, Crystal L. (Ed), New York, NY, US: Guilford Press, 2005. pp. 235–252.&lt;/ref&gt;

Social interaction is necessarily a part of the religious experience. Religiosity has been identified to correlate positively with prosocial behavior in trauma patients, and prosocial behavior is furthermore associated with well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;id=2012-03828-001|title = The relation between trauma exposure and prosocial behavior.|last = Frazier|first = Patricia | name-list-format = vanc |date = May 2013|journal = Psychological Trauma: Theory, Research, Practice, and Policy|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also has stronger associations with well-being in individuals genetically predisposed towards social sensitivity in environments where religion prioritizes social affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Religion and Well-being The Moderating Role of Culture and the Oxytocin Receptor (OXTR) Gene|url = http://jcc.sagepub.com/content/42/8/1394|journal = Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology|date = 2011-11-01|access-date = 2015-04-12|issn = 0022-0221|pages = 1394–1405|volume = 42|issue = 8|doi = 10.1177/0022022111412526|first = Joni Y.|last = Sasaki|first2 = Heejung S.|last2 = Kim|first3 = Jun|last3 = Xu | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been linked to greater resilience against stress&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://hdl.handle.net/1805/14103|title = Religiosity and Spirituality as Resiliency Resources: Moderation, Mediation, or Moderated Mediation?|last1 = Reuter|first1 = Kirby K.|last2 = Bigatti|first2 = Silvia M. | name-list-format = vanc |date = March 2014|journal = Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion|doi = 10.1111/jssr.12081| hdl = 1805/14103|pmid = |volume=53 |pages=56–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as higher measures of self-actualization&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Graff RW, Ladd CE | title = POI correlates of a religious commitment inventory | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychology | volume = 27 | issue = 4 | pages = 502–4 | date = October 1971 | pmid = 5115658 | doi = 10.1002/1097-4679(197110)27:4&lt;502::AID-JCLP2270270431&gt;3.0.CO;2-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and success in romantic relationships and parental responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Religion or spirituality has positive impact on romantic/marital relationships, child development, research shows|url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/12/141208105320.htm|access-date = 2015-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These benefits, while being correlational, may come about as a result of becoming more religiously involved. The benefit of having a secure social group likely plays a key part in religion's positive effects. One form of Christian counseling uses religion through talk therapy and assessments to promote mental health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://search.proquest.com/docview/1268720312?accountid=14816|title = Clinical Appraisal of Spirituality: In Search of Rapid Assessment Instruments (RAIs) for Christian Counseling|last = Greggo|first = Stephen P | name-list-format = vanc |date = 2012|journal = Journal of Psychology and Christianity|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another instance, people who were not Buddhist, but were exposed to Buddhist concepts, scored higher on measures of outgroup acceptance and prosociality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Study finds being exposed to Buddhist concepts reduces prejudice and increases prosociality – The Mirror Post|url = http://www.themirrorpost.com/2015/04/study-finds-being-exposed-to-buddhist.html|website = www.themirrorpost.com|accessdate = 2015-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect was found not only in Western countries, but also in places where Buddhism is prevalent, indicating a general association of Buddhism with acceptance. This finding seems to indicate that merely encountering a religious belief system such as Buddhism may allow some of its effects to be transferred to nonbelievers.

However, many disagree that the benefits the religious experience are due to their beliefs, and some find there to be no conclusive psychological benefits of belief at all. For example, the health benefit that the elderly gain from going to church may in fact be the'' ''reason they are able to go to church; the less healthy cannot leave their homes. Meta analysis has found that find studies purporting the beneficial results of religiosity often fail to fully represent data correctly due to a number of issues such as self-report bias, the use of inappropriate comparison groups, and the presence of criterion contamination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Does religious belief promote prosociality?

Religion has power as a cohesive social force, and whether or not it is always beneficial is debated. Irrespective of a group's beliefs, many find that simply belonging to a tight social group reduces anxiety and mental health problems. In addition, there may be a degree of self-selectivity amongst the religious; the behavioral benefits they display may simply be common aspects of those who choose to or are able to practice religion. As a result, whether or not religion can be prescribed scientifically as a means of self-betterment is unclear.

==== Spirituality ====
While religion is often formalised and community-oriented, [[spirituality]] tends to be individually based and not as formalised. In a 2014 study, 320 children, ages 8–12, in both public and private schools, were given a Spiritual Well-Being Questionnaire assessing the correlation between spirituality and happiness. Spirituality – and not religious practices (praying, attending church services) – correlated positively with the child's happiness; the more spiritual the child was, the happier the child was. Spirituality accounted for about 3–26% of the variance in happiness.&lt;ref name = "Holder_2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Holder |first1=Mark D. |last2=Coleman |first2=Ben |last3=Wallace |first3=Judi M. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Spirituality, Religiousness, and Happiness in Children Aged 8–12 Years |journal=Journal of Happiness Studies |volume=11 |issue=2 |year=2008 |pages=131–50 |doi=10.1007/s10902-008-9126-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meditation has been found to lead to high activity in the brain's left prefrontal cortex, which in turn has been found to correlate with happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shontell|first1=Alyson|title=A 69-year-old monk who scientists call the 'world's happiest man' says the secret to being happy takes just 15 minutes a day|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-be-happier-according-to-matthieu-ricard-the-worlds-happiest-man-2016-1|website=Business Insider|accessdate=3 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study using the Oxford happiness questionnaire on Brahma Kumaris [[Raja yoga]] meditators showed them having higher happiness than the control group.&lt;ref name=pmid24298493/&gt; [[Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche]] has said that neuro scientists have found that with meditation, an individual's happiness baseline can change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/science-has-proved-that-meditation-can-improve-quality-of-life-buddhist-master/articleshow/58200304.cms|title=Science has proved that meditation can improve quality of life: Buddhist master|work=Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many people describe themselves as both religious and spiritual, but [[spirituality]] represents just one particular function of religion. Spirituality as related to positive psychology can be defined as "a search for the sacred".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pargament KI | year = 1999 | title = The psychology of religion and spirituality? Yes and no. | url = | journal = International Journal for the Psychology of Religion | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 3–16 | doi=10.1207/s15327582ijpr0901_2}}&lt;/ref&gt; What is defined as sacred can be related to God, life itself, or almost any other facet of existence. It simply must be viewed as having spiritual implications which are transcendent of the individual.&lt;ref name="Snyder, C. R. 2002"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Snyder, C. R., Lopez, Shane|year=2002|title=Handbook of Positive Psychology|location= New York|publisher= Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spiritual well-being addresses this human need for [[Self-transcendence|transcendence]] and involves social as well as existential well-being. Spiritual [[well-being]] is associated with various positive outcomes such as better physical and psychological well-being, lower anxiety, less depression, [[self-actualization]], positive relationships with parents, higher rates of positive personality traits and acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nelson|first=James M. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Psychology, Religion, and Spirituality|date=2009|publisher=Springer Science + Business Media, LLC|location=New York|page=359}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have cautioned to differentiate between correlative and causal associations between spirituality and psychology.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Schuurmans-Stekhoven | first1 = James | year = 2011 | title = Is it God or just the data that moves in mysterious ways?

Reaching the sacred as a personal goal, also called spiritual striving, has been found to correlate highest with well-being compared to other forms of striving.&lt;ref name=jstor27522349/&gt; This type of striving can improve a sense of self and relationships and creates a connection to the transcendent&lt;ref name="Snyder, C. R. 2002"/&gt; Additionally, multiple studies have shown that self-reported spirituality is related to lower rates of mortality and depression and higher rates of happiness.&lt;ref name = "Holder_2008" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fehring RJ, Miller JF, Shaw C | title = Spiritual well-being, religiosity, hope, depression, and other mood states in elderly people coping with cancer | journal = Oncology Nursing Forum | volume = 24 | issue = 4 | pages = 663–71 | date = May 1997 | pmid = 9159782 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Strawbridge WJ, Cohen RD, Shema SJ, Kaplan GA | title = Frequent attendance at religious services and mortality over 28 years | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 87 | issue = 6 | pages = 957–61 | date = June 1997 | pmid = 9224176 | pmc = 1380930 | doi = 10.2105/ajph.87.6.957 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, most research on spirituality examines ways in which spirituality can help in times of crisis. Spirituality has been found to remain constant when experiencing traumatic events and/or life stressors such as accidents, war, sickness, and death of a loved one. When confronted with an obstacle, people might turn to prayer or meditation. [[Coping (psychology)|Coping]] mechanisms involving spirituality include meditative meditation, creating boundaries to preserve the sacred, spiritual purification to return to the righteous path, and spiritual reframing which focuses on maintaining belief. One clinical application of spirituality and positive psychology research is the "psychospiritual intervention," which represents the potential that spirituality has to increase well-being.&lt;ref name="Snyder, C. R. 2002" /&gt; These coping mechanisms that aim to preserve the sacred have been found by researchers to increase well-being and return the individual back to the sacred.&lt;ref name="Snyder, C. R. 2002"/&gt;

Overall, spirituality is a process that occurs over a lifetime and includes searching, conserving, and redefining what is sacred in an extremely individualized manner. It does not always have a positive effect and in fact has been associated with very negative events and life changes. Research is lacking in spirituality but it is necessary because spirituality can assist in enhancing the experiences of the uncontrollable parts of life.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

== Other factors ==

=== Modernity ===
Much research has pointed at the rising rates of depression, leading people to speculate that modernization may be a factor in the growing percentage of depressed people. One study found that women in urban America were much more likely to experience depression than those in rural Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Colla J, Buka S, Harrington D, Murphy JM | title = Depression and modernization: a cross-cultural study of women | journal = Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology | volume = 41 | issue = 4 | pages = 271–9 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16520885 | doi = 10.1007/s00127-006-0032-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies have found a positive correlation between a country's GDP per capita, as quantitative measure of modernization, and lifetime risk of a mood disorder trended toward significance (p=0.06).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hidaka BH | title = Depression as a disease of modernity: explanations for increasing prevalence | journal = Journal of Affective Disorders | volume = 140 | issue = 3 | pages = 205–14 | date = November 2012 | pmid = 22244375 | pmc = 3330161 | doi = 10.1016/j.jad.2011.12.036 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many people believe it is the increased number of pressures and expectations, increased isolation, increased individualism, and increased inactivity that contribute to higher rates of depression in modern societies.

That is not to say weather is never a factor for happiness. Perhaps the changing norms of sunlight cause [[seasonal affective disorder]], which undermines level of happiness.

== Additional future research ==
Positive psychology research and practice is currently conducted and developed in various countries throughout the world. To illustrate, in Canada, Charles Hackney of Briercrest College applies positive psychology to the topic of personal growth through martial arts training; [[Paul T. P. Wong|Paul Wong]], president of the International Network on Personal Meaning,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://meaning.ca/ |title=International Network on Personal Meaning and Meaning of Life |publisher=Meaning.ca |date=1999-03-15 |accessdate=2011-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; is developing an existential approach to positive psychology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Wong PT | year = 2009 | chapter = Existential positive psychology | veditors = Lopez SJ | title = Encyclopedia of positive psychology | volume = 1 | pages = 361–368 | location = Oxford, UK | publisher = Wiley Blackwell }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Wong PT, Ivtzan I, Lomas T | year = 2016 | chapter = Good work: A meaning-centred approach | veditors = Oades LG, Steger MF, Fave AD, Passmore J | title = The Wiley Blackwell handbook of the psychology of positivity and strengths-based approaches at work | location = West Sussex, UK | publisher = Wiley Blackwell }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is framed in the [[second wave positive psychology]] (PP 2.0).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wong PT | year = 2011 | title = Positive psychology 2.0: Towards a balanced interactive model of the good life | url = | journal = Canadian Psychology | volume = 52 | issue = 2| pages = 69–81 | doi = 10.1037/a002251 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Ivtzan I, Lomas T, Hefferon K, Worth P | year = 2015 | title = Second wave positive psychology: Embracing the dark side of life. | location = London, UK | publisher = Routledge }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Mention MAPP program in England, school based on positive psychology in Australia, etc.--&gt;

The research program ‘Understanding Positive Emotions’ at Human Science Lab, [[London]], investigates how material [[well-being]] and [[perceptual]] well-being work as relative determinants in conditioning our [[mind]] for positive emotions.&lt;ref name="Understanding Positive Emotions"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://humansciencelab.org.uk| title=Understanding Positive Emotions |publisher=Human Science Lab | access-date=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cognitive and behavioral change, although sometimes slight and complex, can produce an 'intense affect'.

Isen (2009) remarked that further progress requires suitable research methods, and appropriate theories on which to base contemporary research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Isen AM |year=2009|contribution=Positive Affect as a Source of Human Strength| veditors = Snyder CR, Lopez SJ |title=Handbook of positive psychology|pages=179–195|location=New York|publisher=Oxford University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chang (2008) suggested that researchers have a number of paths to pursue regarding the enhancement of emotional intelligence, even though emotional intelligence does not guarantee the development of positive affect; in short, more study is required to track the gradient of positive affect in psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| vauthors = Chang KB | year=2008|chapter=Can We Improve Emotional Intelligence|title=Emotional Intelligence; Perspectives on Educational and Positive Psychology|publisher=Peter Lang Publishing Inc.|location= New York|pages=25–45|isbn=9781433101960}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States history==

=== Agricultural Work- 1800-1850 ===
The first enforceable hours' law in the [[United States]] was in 1874 when [[Massachusetts]] enacted a law which limited the amount of time that women and children could work each week.&lt;ref name="eh.net"&gt;http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/whaples.work.hours.us&lt;/ref&gt; This limit was set at sixty hours per week. Similar laws were later adopted by about half of the country's states. Only men in exceptionally hazardous jobs were covered in early legislation and most had no limit to the number of hours their employees could have them work.

Ten-hour workdays were accepted in the [[agriculture]] industry during certain seasons and six-day [[workweeks]] were not unheard of. Bakers did not win the right to work less than ten hours per day until 1905 with the court case of ''[[Lochner v. New York]]''.

The general [[presumption]] during this period was that the courts would allow regulation of labor concerning women and children, who were thought to be incapable of [[bargaining]] on an [[equal footing]] with employers and in special need of protection. Men were allowed freedom of contract unless it could be proven that [[Regulation|regulating]] their hours served a higher good for the population at large.&lt;ref name="eh.net" /&gt;

=== Industrial Work-life 1850's-1970 ===
During the turn of the twentieth century, the push for an [[eight-hour day|eight-hour workday]] was geared primarily toward raising the hourly wage. The idea was that by maintaining the current weekly pay while lowering working hours, a fairer rate of pay would result. The slogan, "Whether you work by the piece or work by the day, decreasing the hours increases the pay," seemed to carry the mood of the day.&lt;ref name="eh.net" /&gt;

The early twentieth century laid the groundwork for the idea of work-life balance. Advancements in social sciences would move the focus towards the impact of long hours on the physical and mental health of the employee.

At this time, however, the new information was used to enhance [[productivity]] for the company. The shorter hours movement began to focus on the fact that an overworked employee is more prone to injury or mistake and becomes less productive. Josephine Goldmark wrote a book in 1912 detailing this fact and the [[Public Works Administration|Federal Public Works Act]] was passed the same year.

This new act required a 40-hour workweek for employees of government contracted firms. Over the next ten years, the government passed legislation requiring a 40-hour work week for individual industries nearly every time the issue arose in court.&lt;ref name="eh.net" /&gt;

When the employees of the [[steel]] industry failed to obtain a reduction from their 84-hour work week in 1919, the industry soon allowed their employees an eight-hour workday, a four-hour-per-day reduction—a move brought about by much "arm-twisting" on the part of President Harding.&lt;ref name="eh.net" /&gt;

By the 1920s, the average work week was fifty hours and was considered a great stride and well-earned award for America's working man. (Whaples) The push for fewer hours had come to a close, but they had one more hurdle to overcome. The new concentration was on the ability to work half a day on Saturdays or have the day off completely. The ability to have two days of rest was unprecedented but was considered vital to finalize an [[ethical]] work schedule. Pressure was put on businesses to make the change, especially in industries and cities with a large number of [[Jew]]ish workers ([[Shabbat|Jewish Sabbath]] is on Saturday), and they finally achieved this goal by the end of the decade. Where only thirty-two firms had a five-day workweek in 1920, nearly half had adopted the practice by 1927.&lt;ref name="eh.net" /&gt;

Their success was short-lived. In the 1920s, the workers were coaxed into believing that they wanted to work longer hours and that they would be harmed by measures that limited how many hours they were allowed to work. Social scientists would later name this force the "gospel of consumption." Beginning in the 1920s, advertisers persuaded Americans that happiness would not come from [[Leisure|leisure time]], but from purchasing commodities, and he concluded that this made it easier for managers to "allow" workers to make more money by working longer hours.&lt;ref name="eh.net" /&gt;

[[Social scientists]] would conclude that a new work ethic began as Americans left the [[Scarcity (social psychology)|psychology of scarcity]] and adopted one of abundance. Some argue that this mentality of consumption or "[[consumerism]]" persists to this day.&lt;ref name="eh.net" /&gt;

During the twentieth century, the average workweek has changed drastically. In 1900, the average workweek in manufacturing was approximately fifty-three hours. However, the workweek is responsive to business conditions. During the [[Great Depression]], the average number of hours for production workers in manufacturing dropped to 34.6 each week. During [[World War II]], hours worked rose to forty-five each week.

The normal range of hours worked during the four decades after [[World War II]] was thirty-nine to forty-one hours; (Whaples) however, starting in the 1990s, factory workweek hours began to exceed forty-one hours. As previously mentioned, Americans work approximately 47.1 hours each week; some employees work up to seventy hours. Therefore, it is safe to state that the average number of hours Americans presently work each week is the highest it has been in nearly seventy-five years.

In 1900, only nineteen percent of women of working age were in the [[labor force]]. In 1999 sixty percent of women worked outside the home. Even if the hours worked were slightly higher at the turn of the century, most households were supported by one paycheck. "In 1900, eighty percent of American children had a working father and a stay-at-home mother; however, by 1999, that figure was only twenty-four percent."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bls.gov/opub/cwc/&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Great Depression, working hours were reduced. By 1932, approximately fifty percent of Americans were working a shortened work week. Instead of reducing wages, employers decided to lay off many workers and attempted to protect the employees that remained by encouraging them to job share.

[[President Herbert Hoover]]'s Commission for Work Sharing pushed voluntary hours reductions, and it is estimated that nearly three to five million jobs had been saved. (Whaples) Companies such as [[Sears]], [[General Motors]], and [[Standard Oil]] reduced the number of days worked each week, and Akron began a six-hour workday. The AFL began to call for a federally mandated 30-hour workweek.&lt;ref name="eh.net" /&gt;

By 1933, some experts were predicting that the "thirty-hour workweek was within a month of becoming federal law."&lt;ref name="eh.net" /&gt; Congress began hearings on mandating the 30-hour workweek, and the Senate even passed the bill (which was written by [[Hugo Black]] and sponsored in the House by [[William Connery]]) fifty-three to thirty.

Newly elected President, [[Franklin Roosevelt]] initially supported the bill, but had second thoughts when he realized that the bill had a provision to forbid importation of goods produced by workers who worked longer than thirty hours a week. Instead, Roosevelt began to support the [[National Industrial Recovery Act]]. Labor leaders were encouraged to support the NIRA instead of the Black-Connery Thirty-Hour Bill with a guarantee of [[Trade union|union]] organization and [[collective bargaining]]. With the threat of a mandated 30-hour work week, businesses "fell into line."&lt;ref name="eh.net" /&gt; When specifics codes for the NIRA were drawn up, shorter hours were no longer a genuine concern.&lt;ref name="eh.net" /&gt;

After the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] ended, the average weekly hours worked began to rise. (According to the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]], in 1934 the average hours worked each week was approximately thirty-four hours). During World War II, hours increased by approximately ten hours a week but, in the aftermath of the war, weekly work hours averaged forty hours.&lt;ref name="eh.net" /&gt;

=== Informational Work-life 1970 - Present ===
With [[automation]] of the workplace in "full swing" by the 1970s, large numbers of women began entering the work force and an "awareness of stress rose to the forefront".&lt;ref name="cqp" /&gt; In the publication ''Type A Behavior and Your Heart'', [[cardiologist]]s Meyer Friedman and Ray H. Rosenman wrote about the "hurry sickness" common to "[[workaholic]]s"—people who had no friends and who "never relaxed or went to [[museums]]".&lt;ref name="cqp"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://library.cqpress.com/cqresearcher/document.php?id=cqresrre1995080400&amp;PHPSESSID=9shh40qo0hl1u1vteqkm9jid83|title=Job Stress|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1970s, Professor [http://www.oresundsynergy.com/robert-karasek/ Robert Karasek] of the [[University of Lowell]] (now known as [[University of Massachusetts Lowell]]) developed a method for analyzing stress-producing factors in the workplace. It has been widely employed to examine workplace pressures and their relationship with research data on coronary heart disease, [[Musculoskeletal disorder|musculoskeletal illnesses]], psychological strain and absenteeism. Karasek explains, "In situations where an individual has high demands on him and low control, the undesirable stress of work and other situations becomes problematic."&lt;ref name="cqp" /&gt;

The 1980s brought new complaints of work-life balance related [[Psychological stress|stress]]. This time period was given such names as "the [[Me generation|ME generation]]," "the age of [[narcissism]]" and "the pursuit of loneliness."&lt;ref name="cqp" /&gt; The number of cases of emotional [[depression (mood)|depression]] in the United States was believed to have doubled between 1970 and 1990.

"What you do is what you are" was the common and unhealthy assumption. According to 'The Workaholic Syndrome', written by Judith K. Sprankle and Henry Ebel, "By their sheer numbers and the consequently narrowing opportunities at every upward run of the organizational ladder, the [[baby-boomers]] have been compelled to do more, to move faster, to compete harder. They, in turn, have set the pace for other age groups. The signs of increased stress are legion and have been intensified by an economic climate that mandates that if we marry at all, we marry a working spouse."&lt;ref name="cqp" /&gt;

In the late 1980s, the "[[computer revolution]]" was not only responsible for [[corporate]] [[Layoff|downsizing]], but also increased the demand of employee output. Social critic [[Jeremy Rifkin]] states, "Back in the agriculture-based society, people were more attuned to generatively,&lt;ref name="cqp" /&gt; and middle-stress disorders and [[diseases of affluence]] were not part of life. They weren't triggered until the [[Industrialisation|Industrial Age]], and now the [[Information Age]] has worsened them. Nowadays, instead of seconds, it's nanoseconds. We have moved from designing a schedule that real people can execute in whatever time it takes them, to a program which people can monitor but can't affect."&lt;ref name="cqp" /&gt;

In the 1980s, the number of [[workers' compensation]] claims for "gradual [[Psychological stress|mental stress]]" began to rise. Claims rose from 1,844 cases in 1981 to 15,688 in 1999 in the state of [[California]] alone. Because of the large number of cases as well as evidence of numerous cases of fraud, efforts were made in the early 1990s to reform the [[workers compensation]] program. Led by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Governor of California]] [[Pete Wilson]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] [[State assembly]] Speaker [[Willie Brown (politician)|Willie Brown]], the new law stated that claimants had to prove that stress was at least 51 percent of the reason for their illness.&lt;ref name="cqp" /&gt;

Unfortunately, because of these reforms some feel that it is now extremely difficult to be approved for workers compensation. John Burton, dean of the school of management and labor relations at [[Rutgers University]] feels that part of the reason for the decline is that "a number of states made it difficult to get stress into the system.

So even if the stress is out there, it's not showing up (in the compensation statistics). Some of it shows up in the rising violence, which is a crude proxy for the stress out there."&lt;ref name="cqp" /&gt;

==American Laws and Policies Regarding Labor==

===Family and Medical Leave Act===
The 1990s saw the introduction of additional laws designed to help the American worker. One current law that guarantees employees time off is the [[Family and Medical Leave Act]] of 1993 signed under U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]]. According to the Family and Medical Leave Act, any "eligible" employee is entitled to twelve weeks of leave for immediate family member need and medical reasons during a twelve-month period. An employee's spouse, children, and parents are considered [[immediate family]].

The term "parent" does not include an employee's in-laws or children over the age of eighteen unless they are "incapable of self-care" because of mental or physical [[disability]] that limits one or more of the "major life activities."&lt;ref name="esa"&gt;http://www.dol.gov/esa&lt;/ref&gt; Employees are eligible to take FMLA leave if they have worked for their employer for at least twelve months, have worked at least 1,250 hours during the previous twelve months, and have worked at a company with a minimum of fifty employees that work either at that work site or at work sites within a seventy-five mile radius.

Employers may select one of four options for determining the required twelve-month period. They can decide to determine eligibility by the calendar year, by any fixed twelve-month "leave year" such as a fiscal year, a year required by state law, or a year starting on the employee's "anniversary" date, by the twelve-month period measured forward from the date when an employee's first FMLA leave begins, or by a "rolling" twelve-month period measured backward from the date an employee uses FMLA leave.

Pregnancy disability leave or [[Maternity leave in the United States|maternity leave]] for the birth of a child would be considered qualifying FMLA leave. This law, however, does not guarantee [[paid time off]]; the FMLA only requires [[unpaid leave]]. However, the law permits an employee to elect, or the employer to require the employee, to use accrued paid leave, such as vacation or sick leave, for some or all of the FMLA leave period. It is unlawful for any employer to deny the right of any eligible employee the use of FMLA leave.&lt;ref name="esa" /&gt;

===Small Necessities Leave Act===
In addition to the [[Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993|Family Leave and Medical Act]], there are many other federal and state statutes that allow employees legal time off from work. [[Massachusetts]] enacted the [http://wiki.williams.edu/display/handbooks/Small+Necessities+Leave+Act Small Necessities Leave Act] in 1998 which expanded upon the rights guaranteed by the FMLA.

The Small Necessities Leave Act allows eligible employees a total of twenty-four hours of unpaid leave during any twelve-month period, "over and above" the leave granted by the FMLA. This act allows an employee to participate in school activities directly related to the "educational advancement" of his/her child. This includes parent-teacher conferences, "back to school" activities, and even interviewing for a new school.

The term "school" includes any public or private [[Elementary school (United States)|elementary]] or [[Secondary education in the United States|secondary schools]], [[Head Start (program)|Head Start programs]], and licensed children's [[day care]] centers. (Gallitano) The SNLA also allows employees to attend routine medical or dental appointments with their children. In addition, the employee is allowed to accompany an "elderly relative" to medical or dental appointments or any other services that provide [[professional services]] related to [[elder care]]. (The elderly relative must be at least sixty years old and be related by blood or marriage to the employee) The SNLA includes time off to arrange for professional care at a nursing home or rehabilitation facility.

The eligibility required for leave under the Small Necessities Leave Act is the same as for eligibility under the Family and Medical Leave Act and, like the FMLA, the employer is permitted to choose the method for determining which twelve-month period will apply when calculating the twenty-four hours of leave that may be taken by the employee. Leaves of absences can be taken intermittently.

For example, if the employee needs to take off two hours in the morning to attend a [[parent-teacher conference]], the employer may not require the employee to take time off in blocks of half or full days. Also, the employer is given the option of requesting [[certification]] (from a physician or school, for example) for leave requests.&lt;ref name="conn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.connkavanaugh.com|title=Conn Kavanaugh : Boston Law Firm - MA Law Firm - Boston Lawyer - MA Lawyer -  Homepage|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Massachusetts Maternity Leave Statute===
Massachusetts created the [http://www.mass.gov/mcad/resources/employers-businesses/emp-guidelines-maternity1-gen.html Massachusetts Maternity Leave] Statute in 1972. This law provides eight weeks of leave to female employees who have met certain criteria. This statute applies to all employers having six or more employees. Those eligible under the Massachusetts statute must be [[full-time]] employees who have completed three months of work. It also applies when an eligible female adopts a child under eighteen years old (or under twenty-three if the child is mentally or physically [[disabled]]). The employer can decide if this leave will be paid or unpaid. If the leave is unpaid, the employer must permit the employee to use accrued paid sick, vacation, or personal time, but the employer may not require the employee to use that accrued time.&lt;ref name="conn" /&gt;

===Wage and Hour Law and "Day of Rest" Statute===
[[Massachusetts]] also has a statute, known as the Wage and Hour Law, which creates a number of additional [[Labor rights|rights for employees]] regarding time off. [[Massachusetts law]] requires employers to provide a thirty-minute meal break to every employee who works more than six hours a day; it does not require that the meal break be paid. Another form of time off from work that is governed by the statute is the creation of "[[legal holidays]]."

Massachusetts law presently includes eleven [[Public holidays in the United States|legal holidays]]. If employees are required to work on a [[legal holiday]] (such as [[retail]] employees) they must be paid at a rate of one and a half times their normal pay rate. Massachusetts also has a "Day of Rest" statute that provides that all employees are entitled to one day off from work in seven calendar days.&lt;ref name="conn" /&gt;

===Short- and long-term disability===
Many employers offer short and /or long-term [[disability insurance]] to their employees. These plans offer wage replacement benefits for employees who are not able to work based on a physical or mental condition. There are no laws requiring an employer to grant paid vacations to its employees in Massachusetts. However, nearly all employers provide paid [[Annual leave|vacation]] benefits in some form in order to remain competitive.

===Exemption status===
Besides the different compensation structures between exempt and [http://topics.hrhero.com/exempt-vs-non-exempt-employees/ nonexempt workers] (for example, exempt employees are excluded from [[minimum wage]] and are paid a salary rather than minimum wage; whereas, nonexempt employees must be paid at least the federal minimum wage for each hour worked), there are differences in [[overtime]] requirements and expectations.

Exempt employees are usually expected to work the number of hours necessary to complete their tasks, regardless of whether that requires thirty-five or fifty-five hours per week. On the other hand, nonexempt employees must be paid overtime if they work more than forty hours per week. If an exempt employee's "tasks" are extensive and [[time-consuming]], he/she is required to put in an indeterminable number of hours at the workplace. If staying late or coming in early is required to do the job, exempt employees are frequently expected to do just that. This could cut down on the amount of time he/she has for family, friends, or leisure activities, increase stress, and could even lead to [[Occupational Burnout]].

== Global Comparisons ==
Work-life balance has been a controversial issue for workers across the United States for decades.Long work hours are based partly on some business's long operating schedules, while many European countries do not.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/OPINION/05/25/cooper.vacation.europe/index.html|title=America can learn from Europe on work-life balance|last=Cooper|first=Cary|date=May 25, 2011|website=CNN|publisher=Cable News Network. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.|access-date=December 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[OECD Better Life Index]] the United States ranked 28th in work-life balance while European nations dominate this category.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/topics/work-life-balance/|title=OECD Better Life Index|last=OECD|first=OECD|date=2015|website=OECD Better Life Index|publisher=OECD|access-date=December 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Countries adopt [[welfare state]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;, which determines the role the government takes to preserve the well being of the citizen. The United States developed a limited welfare state in 1930.

[[Denmark]], [[Sweden]] and [[Norway]] are ranked in the top 10 countries with the best work-life balance and have all adopted the Social-Democratic [[welfare state|Welfare State]] Regime . This system promotes many appealing benefits for single men, women and families. In Denmark new parents are guaranteed 52 weeks of paid leave and universal childcare facilities. Sweden also has an attractive [[parental leave]] insuring workers 480 days of paid parental leave. For the Swedish long work hours have been replaced with 6-hour workdays with 1% of the population working more than 50 hours a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mydomaine.com/countries-with-best-work-life-balance-2016|title=These 10 Countries Have the Best Work/Life Balance|newspaper=MyDomaine|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other countries like Spain, Germany and the Netherlands are leading in successful work-life balance by adopting the Mediterranean and Conservative Regimes.  Within this welfare state there's a focus on traditional [[family values]] and [[gender norm]]. According to Dr. Deirdre Anderson of Cranfield School of Management "women's place in the labor market is fairly low" compared to the United States, which allows time for family and additional source of income.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/osagi/pdf/FPW/worklife/Work-Life-Trends-in-Europe,-Deidre-Anderson.pdf|title=Work life trends in Europe Work life trends in Europe|last=Anderson|first=Deirdre|date=September 11, 2010|website=un.org|publisher=Cranfield University|access-date=December 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Spain gender norms have created the availability of part-time jobs that are typically "employed" by women. The Netherlands follows the same approach on part-time employment as Spain and has "more than half of the working population work part time".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Another benefit of work-life balance within this welfare state is the approach on [[vacation Days|vacation days]]. Germans are required by law to have 20 paid days off a year and their Dutch counterparts also are insured 20 vacation days.

The common factor between the nations that have prosperous work-life balance is [[flexible working hours]], parental leave and [[child care]] policies.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Gender and Work-life Balance ==
A study conducted in 2009 concluded that 39% of working women and 45% of working men experience issues with work-life balance.&lt;ref&gt;http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=edb&amp;AN=73464856&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site{{full citation needed|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Full-time male employees worked an average of 8.4 hours per day in 2014, compared with the 7.8 hours worked by women. But nearly 8 million more women than men worked part-time last year. 2013 and 2014 states that 57 percent of women participated in the labor force. Since 1975, the rate of working mothers has risen from 47.4 percent to 70.3 percent.

Women became more prominent in the professional workforce during the 1970s even after getting married and having children.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=edselc&amp;AN=edselc.2-52.0-84960091529&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site{{full citation needed|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today women make up 47 percent of the labor force, compared to 38 percent in 1970. Mothers entering the workforce was a shift in traditional values for women and mothers, however in the 2010s, 70% of high school students surveyed believed that mothers could have a healthy relationship with their mother, as opposed to 53% in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Studies show the paid family leave and paid sick days are the issues women care about over any other work-life policy issue.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=edb&amp;AN=45730221&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site{{full citation needed|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a poll conducted in November 2008, 35% of women felt that issues in work-life balance for women would be best addressed through paid family leave and sick days.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Both genders actually feel that these concerns better address work-life balance with growing concerns of watching children, older family members, and ill family members.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The United States is the only high-income country that does not guarantee the right to paid maternity leave.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;
