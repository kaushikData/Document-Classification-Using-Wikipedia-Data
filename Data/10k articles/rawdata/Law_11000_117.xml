The '''11th Panchen Lama controversy''' is a dispute about the current legitimate holder of the [[Panchen Lama]] title, a political and religious leadership position in [[Tibet]] and [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. After the death of the [[10th Panchen Lama]], a dispute between the Chinese leadership and the exiled [[14th Dalai Lama]] resulted in two competing candidates. The search committee process involving monks in Tibet under the strict supervision of the Chinese communist regime was disrupted when the Dalai Lama, according to the Tibetan tradition, unilaterally announced his selection of [[Gedhun Choekyi Nyima]]. The leadership in China spirited Nyima away to prevent his being taken to India by the Dalai Lama's supporters and reverted to the [[Qing Dynasty]]'s [[Golden Urn]] process to select [[Gyaincain Norbu]].[[File:Sign about Panchen Lama, Manali.jpg|thumb|419x419px|Sign referring to the disappearance of the 11th Panchen Lama chosen &amp; recognized by the [[14th Dalai Lama]] of Tibet, [[Gedhun Choekyi Nyima]] in [[Manali, Himachal Pradesh]], India]] 

==Selection of the Panchen Lama==
Three days after the death of the 10th Panchen Lama, the Premier of the State Council published decision on how the 11th Panchen Lama would be selected based on the feedback gathered from the committee of [[Tashi Lhunpo Monastery]] and monks on January 30th 1989. &lt;ref name="Goldstein101"&gt;Goldstein 1997, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://zh.wikisource.org/zh-hans/%E5%9B%BD%E5%8A%A1%E9%99%A2%E5%85%B3%E4%BA%8E%E7%AC%AC%E5%8D%81%E4%B8%96%E7%8F%AD%E7%A6%85%E5%A4%A7%E5%B8%88%E6%B2%BB%E4%B8%A7%E5%92%8C%E8%BD%AC%E4%B8%96%E9%97%AE%E9%A2%98%E7%9A%84%E5%86%B3%E5%AE%9A | title = 国务院关于第十世班禅大师治丧和转世问题的决定}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.sohu.com/20050412/n225154033.shtml |title = 第十世班禅大师的圆寂和遗言}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Five years after the death of the [[10th Panchen Lama]], ordinarily, the 11th Panchen Lama would have already been identified.&lt;ref name="Hilton6"&gt;Hilton 2000, pg. 6&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Nechung Oracle]] in [[Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh|Dharamsala]] had been consulted on the matter.&lt;ref name="Hilton9"&gt;Hilton 2000, pg. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Tibetans would not consider a candidate for the eleventh incarnation legitimate unless he were identified according to Tibetan traditional means, including a search by the tenth's senior staff based on [[dream]]s and [[omen]]s, and formal recognition of the result by the Dalai Lama.  On the other hand, the leaders of the Chinese government wanted the process to demonstrate their authority.  Beijing planned to have the traditional group of monks follow traditional methods, but to identify a group of candidates, not only one, and then to use the [[Golden Urn]] to randomly select one of them, and to exclude the Dalai Lama from the process altogether.&lt;ref name="Goldstein1001"&gt;Goldstein 1997, pp. 100-1&lt;/ref&gt;  

However, Beijing later allowed [[Tashilhunpo Monastery]]'s [[Chadrel Rinpoche]], the head of the search team, to communicate with the Dalai Lama, currently exiled and an opponent of the regime, in hopes that a mutually acceptable process and candidate could be accomplished.  At the end of 1994, twenty-five candidates had been identified, and Chadrel sent the Dalai Lama detailed information on all of them; but Chadrel also wrote that all signs pointed to [[Gedhun Choekyi Nyima]] as the true reincarnation. In February 1995, the Dalai Lama replied to Chadrel that his own divinations confirmed Gedhun Choekyi Nyima.  Chadrel intended to publicly mimic the process that occurred in identifying the [[Choekyi Gyaltsen|tenth Panchen Lama]] in 1949: the urn would not be used; China would be first to publicly name the choice; and then the Dalai Lama would confirm it.  However, in March 1995, Chinese officials insisted on drawing a name from three to five slips in the urn.  On May 14, 1995, the Dalai Lama preempted the drawing by publicly announcing that Gedhun Choekyi Nyima was the eleventh Panchen Lama.&lt;ref name="Goldstein1026"&gt;Goldstein 1997, pp. 102-6&lt;/ref&gt;  

In November 1995, the Chinese government selected a different boy, [[Gyaincain Norbu]], using the [[Golden Urn]].  This decision was immediately denounced by the Dalai Lama.  China holds Gedhun Choekyi Nyima in a place whose location has not been divulged to the public.&lt;ref name="Goldstein109"&gt;Goldstein 1997, pg. 109&lt;/ref&gt; 

In May 1997, Chadrel was sentenced to six years in prison for [[splittism]] and betraying state secrets.&lt;ref name="Goldstein107"&gt;Goldstein 1997, pg. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Auctioneers Act 1845''' (citation 8 &amp; 9 Vict., c.15) was an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] to the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], passed during the reign of [[Queen Victoria]] on 8 August 1845, with the [[long title]] "An Act to impose a new duty on the licence to be taken out by all auctioneers in the United Kingdom".  

The initial Act instituted a [[tax]] on [[license]]s for [[auctioneers]] to raise [[Financial capital|capital]]. This was repealed, however, by the [[Finance Act 1949]]. 

Only one section of the Act remains in British [[law]] - Section 7, which states that auctioneers must place a board with their full [[name]] and [[house|residence]] that is "publicly visible and [[legible]]" in the room where the [[auction]] takes place before, during and after the auction. This was to allow people to make formal [[complaint]]s against auctioneers in cases of [[fraud]] or other offenses. This section was expanded by the [[Auctions (Bidding Agreements) Act 1927]], to impose a penalty of 20 [[pounds sterling]] upon any auctioneer who failed to follow the Act.

{{refimprove|date=August 2016}}
In [[common law]] jurisdictions, a '''bill of particulars''' is a detailed, formal, written statement of charges or claims by a [[plaintiff]] or the [[prosecutor]] given upon the [[defendant]]'s formal request to the court for more detailed information. A bill of particulars may be used in either [[criminal defense]] or in [[civil litigation]].

==Use==
In [[criminal law]], defense [[Lawyer|attorneys]] may file a motion requesting a bill of particulars from [[prosecutor|prosecuting attorneys]].  However, prosecuting attorneys cannot request the same of the defense.  This request may be part of an omnibus motion, [[motion in limine]], or similar motion.

In a [[civil action]] such as a [[tort]] or [[breach of contract]] case, either attorney or party can request it. It is rarely used in [[United States|American]] [[small claims]] cases. It is not entirely clear whether this can be done in practice in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] on the [[Allocation questionnaire]]. An insufficient response to a request for a bill of particulars may be grounds for dismissal of the claim, or other sanctions against the responding party.  In civil cases, a bill of particulars is a [[pleading]], which "amplifies" the [[complaint]], but can also act as a discovery device or tool.

==In U.S. law==
The [[Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure]] provide in rule 7(f) that "the court may direct the government to file a bill of particulars".

In U.S. state law, the bill of particulars was abolished in nearly all court systems in the 1940s and 1950s due to the widespread recognition that much of the information requested could be obtained more efficiently through the [[Discovery (law)|discovery]] process. Today, only a minority of U.S. states, like [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Illinois]], [[California]] (CCP 454), and [[Virginia]], use the bill of particulars, and even there motions for a bill of particulars may be disfavored or disused. In Illinois, for instance, it is more common for defendants to file a motion to dismiss under the Illinois Code of Civil Procedure § 2-615, claiming the pleaded facts to be insufficient to support the causes of action alleged. It has been observed, however, that the motion for a bill of particulars may have strategic advantages over a § 2-615 motion, because the latter, even where successful, usually results in the plaintiff being given an opportunity to refile. A bill of particulars, however, once submitted, confines the pleader to any causes of action or defenses in the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kinnally|first1=Patrick M.|title=The Occasional Litigator's Guide to Making the Most of Pleadings and Motions|journal=Illinois Bar Journal|date=August 2004|volume=92|issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The closest modern equivalent, though rarely used, is the [[motion for a more definite statement]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6880">'''Books of authority''' is a term used by legal writers to refer to a number of early legal [[textbook]]s that are excepted from the rule that textbooks (and all books other than [[statute]] or [[law report]]) are not treated as authorities by the courts of [[England and Wales]] and other [[common law]] jurisdictions.

These books are treated by the courts as authoritative statements of the law as it was at the time at which they were written, on the authority of their authors alone. Consequently, they are treated as authoritative statements of the law as it is at the present time, unless it is shown that the law has changed, and may be cited and relied on in court as such.

The statements made in these books are presumed to be evidence of judicial decisions which are no longer [[Extant literature|extant]]. The primary reason for this practice is the difficulty associated with ascertaining the law of the medieval and early modern periods.

On the subject of this practice, [[William Blackstone]] said:

{{cquote|Besides these reporters, there are also other authors, to whom great veneration and respect is paid by the students of the common law. Such are [[Ranulf de Glanvill|Glanvill]] and [[Henry de Bracton|Bracton]], [[Britton (law)|Britton]] and [[Fleta]], [[Ralph de Hengham|Hengham]] and [[Thomas de Littleton|Littleton]], [[Nicholas Statham|Statham]], [[Robert Broke|Brooke]], [[Anthony Fitzherbert|Fitzherbert]] and [[William Staunford|Staundeforde]], with some others of antient date; whose treatises are cited as authority, and are evidence that cases have formerly happened, in which such and such points were determined, which are now become settled and first principles. One of the last of these methodical writers in point of time, whose works are of any intrinsic authority in the courts of justice, and do not depend on the strength of their quotations from older authors, is the same learned judge we have just mentioned, [[Sir Edward Coke]];&lt;ref&gt;[[William Blackstone]], [[Commentaries on the Laws of England]], Book I, pp. 72 - 73&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The '''U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission''' ('''CFTC''') is an [[Independent agencies of the United States government|independent agency of the US government]] created in 1974, that regulates [[futures contract|futures]] and [[option (finance)|option]] markets.

The Commodities Exchange Act ("CEA"), {{UnitedStatesCode|7|1}} ''et seq.'', prohibits fraudulent conduct in the trading of futures contracts.  The stated mission of the CFTC is to foster open, transparent, competitive, and financially sound markets, to avoid systemic risk, and to protect the market users and their funds, consumers, and the public from fraud, manipulation, and abusive practices related to derivatives and other products that are subject to the [[Commodity Exchange Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cftc.gov/About/MissionResponsibilities/index.htm |title=Missions &amp; Responsibilities |accessdate=April 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008]] and since 2010 with the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]], CFTC has been transitioning to bring more transparency and stricter regulation to the multitrillion dollar swaps market.&lt;ref name=wsj&gt;{{cite news |last1= Ackermann |first=Andrew |date=April 9, 2014 |title=Senate Panel Approves Three Nominees to CFTC - WSJ  |url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB20001424052702304819004579489384108138464 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019105655/https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB20001424052702304819004579489384108138464 |archive-date=October 19, 2015 |access-date=April 14, 2018|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

[[Futures contracts]] for agricultural [[commodities]] have been traded in the U.S. for more than 150 years and have been under Federal regulation since the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' the [[Futures Trading Act of 1921]], Declared unconstitutional in [[Hill v. Wallace]] 259 U.S. 44 (1922), the [[Grain Futures Act]] of 1922 and [[Board of Trade of City of Chicago v. Olsen]] 262 US 1 (1923).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Grain Futures Act]] of 1922 set the basic authority and was changed by the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936 (7 U.S.C. 1 et seq.).&lt;ref&gt;{{CRS|article = Report for Congress: Agriculture: A Glossary of Terms, Programs, and Laws, 2005 Edition |url=http://ncseonline.org/nle/crsreports/05jun/97-905.pdf|author= {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810044532/http://ncseonline.org/nle/crsreports/05jun/97-905.pdf |date=August 10, 2011 }} Jasper Womach |publisher=ncseonline.org|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cftc.gov/cftc/cftchome.htm |publisher=CFTC |title=About}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Futures Markets: Their Purpose, Their History, Their Growth, Their Successes and Failures |author=Dennis W. Carlton |journal=Journal of Futures Markets |year=1984 |volume=4 |number=3 |pages=237–71 |url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdlink?did=391718211&amp;sid=2&amp;Fmt=2&amp;clientId=13392&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD |doi=10.1002/fut.3990040302}}&lt;/ref&gt; trading in futures contracts has expanded rapidly beyond traditional physical and agricultural commodities into a vast array of financial instruments, including foreign currencies, U.S. and foreign government securities, and U.S. and foreign stock indices.

Congress created the CFTC in 1974 as an independent agency with the mandate to regulate. The [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission Act of 1974]] (P.L. 93-463) created the CFTC to replace the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]]'s [[Commodity Exchange Authority]] as the independent federal agency responsible for regulating commodity futures and [[Option (finance)|option]] markets in the United States.  The Act made extensive changes in the basic authority of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) of 1936, which itself had made extensive changes in the original [[Grain Futures Act of 1922]].  (7 U.S.C. 1 et seq.).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{CRS|article = Report for Congress: Agriculture: A Glossary of Terms, Programs, and Laws, 2005 Edition|url = http://ncseonline.org/nle/crsreports/05jun/97-905.pdf|author= {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810044532/http://ncseonline.org/nle/crsreports/05jun/97-905.pdf |date=August 10, 2011 }} Jasper Womach |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CFTC's mandate was renewed and expanded in December 2000 when Congress passed the [[Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000]], which instructed the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) and the CFTC to develop a joint regulatory regime for [[single-stock futures]], the products of which began trading in November 2002. As of 2003 the growth in the value of [[Derivative (finance)|swaps]] had exploded since their introduction in the late 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Governing Global Finance: Financial derivatives, liberal states and transformative capacity |author=William D. Coleman |series=GHC Working Paper 01/2 |year=2003 |url=http://www.healthagingandsociety.mcmaster.ca/institute-on-globalization-and-the-human-condition/documents/IGHC-WPS_01-2_Coleman.pdf |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]], expanded the CFTC's authority into the [[derivatives market|swaps markets]], to prohibit the reckless use of manipulative schemes without -as in the past- having to prove the specific intent of the accused to affect prices and the existence of an artificial price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Antidisruptive Practices Authority, 78 FR 31890|url=http://www.cftc.gov/ucm/groups/public/@lrfederalregister/documents/file/2013-12365a.pdf|work=Federal Register|publisher=CFTC|accessdate=March 13, 2014|date=May 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McGonagle /&gt;

==Responsibilities==
The CFTC assures utility of the futures markets by encouraging their competitiveness and efficiency, ensuring their integrity, protecting market participants against manipulation, abusive trading practices, and fraud, and ensuring the financial integrity of the [[Clearing (finance)|clearing process]]. The CFTC like the SEC, does not directly regulate the safety and soundness of individual firms, with the exception of newly regulated swap dealers and major swap participants, for whom it sets capital standards pursuant to Dodd-Frank.&lt;ref name=murphy&gt;{{cite web|last=Murphy|first=Edward V|title=Who Regulates Whom and How? An Overview of U.S. Financial Regulatory Policy for Banking and Securities Markets |url=https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43087.pdf |publisher=Congressional Research Service|accessdate=March 14, 2014|pages=51|format=CRS Report for Congress,7-5700|date=May 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Through oversight, the CFTC enables the futures markets to serve the function of [[price discovery]] and offsetting price risk.

As of 2014 the CFTC oversees 'designated contract markets' (DCMs) or [[exchange (organized market)|exchanges]], [[Swap Execution Facility|swap execution facilities]] (SEFs), derivatives [[Clearing house (finance)|clearing organizations]], [[Trade Repository|swap data repository]], [[derivative|swap]] dealers, [[futures commission merchant]]s, [[commodity pool operator]]s and other intermediaries. The CFTC coordinates its work with foreign regulators, such as its UK counterpart, the [[Financial Conduct Authority]], which supervises the [[London Metal Exchange]].&lt;ref name=McGonagle&gt;{{cite web|title=Testimony of Vincent McGonagle, Director Division of Market Oversight, Commodity Futures Trading Commission Before the Financial Institutions and Consumer Protection Subcommittee Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs |url=https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opamcgonagle011514|date=January 15, 2014|accessdate=March 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two actions by the CFTC in 1998 led some market participants to express concerns that the CFTC might modify the "Swap Exemption" and attempt to impose new regulations on the swap market.&lt;ref name="wg_otc_deriv"&gt;{{citation|title=Over-the-Counter Derivatives Markets and the Commodity Exchange Act |url=http://www.ustreas.gov/press/releases/reports/otcact.pdf |publisher=President's [[Working Group on Financial Markets]] |work=press release |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101013165049/http://www.ustreas.gov/press/releases/reports/otcact.pdf |archivedate=October 13, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; First, in a February 1998 comment letter addressing the SEC's "broker-dealer lite" proposal, the CFTC stated that the SEC's proposal would create the potential for conflict with the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) to the extent that certain OTC derivative instruments fall within the ambit of the CEA and are subject to the exclusive statutory authority of the CFTC.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Jean A. Webb, Secretary, CFTC, to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC (February 26, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1998 the CFTC issued a 'concept release' requesting comment on whether regulation of OTC derivatives markets was appropriate and, if so, what form such regulation should take.&lt;ref&gt;Over-the-Counter Derivatives, 63 Fed. Reg. 26,114 (May 12, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; Legislation enacted in 1999 at the request of the [[US Treasury]], the [[Federal Reserve Board]], and the SEC limited the CFTC's rulemaking authority with respect to swaps and hybrid instruments until March 30, 1999, and froze the pre-existing legal status of swap agreements and hybrid instruments entered into in reliance on the 'Swap Exemption', the 'Hybrid Instrument Rule', the 'Swap Policy Statement, or the 'Hybrid Interpretation'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-105publ277/html/PLAW-105publ277.htm | title= Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1999, § 760, as enacted in Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1999, Pub.

Shortly after Congress had passed this legislation prohibiting CFTC from regulating derivatives, Born resigned.&lt;ref name="the_warning"/&gt; She later commented the failure of [[Long-Term Capital Management]] and the subsequent bailout as being indicative what she had been trying to prevent.&lt;ref name="the_warning"/&gt;&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Born was the focus of an October 2009 Frontline documentary titled "The Warning" and was also chronicled in the documentary ''[[Inside Job (2010 film)|Inside Job]]''. The two films recount her attempts to investigate and regulate the OTC [[derivative (finance)|derivative]]s market (PBS Frontline The Warning)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Crude oil derivatives and futures: speculation or fundamentals ===
Since 1991 the CFTC has given secret exemptions from hedging regulations to 19 major banks and market participants, allowing them to accumulate essentially unlimited positions.&lt;ref name=CFTC2009&gt;{{cite web|location=Washington, DC.|author=David Stawick, Secretary of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission|title=FR Doc. E9-6187|date=March 17, 2009 |url=http://www.cftc.gov/LawRegulation/FederalRegister/ProposedRules/e9-6187.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These exemptions came to light only after the 2008 financial crisis had unfolded and Congress requested information on market participants.  A trader or bank granted an exemption as a bona-fide hedger can affect the price of a commodity without being either its producer or consumer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-12-15/cftc-urged-to-curb-commodity-speculation-as-wall-street-resists.html | work=Bloomberg |first1=Silla | last1=Brush | first2=Asjylyn | last2=Loder | title=Wall Street Pushes for Delay in U.S. Rules to Curb Commodities Speculation | date=December 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2007 during the [[subprime mortgage crisis]], the CFTC began investigating transportation, storage and trading of U.S. crude oil for price manipulation, which included a probe of U.S. crude oil futures.&lt;ref name=Bloomberg2008&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Probes Crude Oil Trading for Price Manipulation|date=May 30, 2008|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601082&amp;sid=ad.d2jiev_EA&amp;refer=canada|author1=Matthew Leising|author2=Alexander Kwiatkowski|publisher=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Crude oil futures in December 2007 were at ,0 US (Yedlin June 5, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; By May 2008, when the price of crude oil futures showed a meteoric rise of 40% to a record $US 135 a barrel there were concerns that the record prices may have been the result of "manipulation or fraud".&lt;ref name=Bloomberg2008 /&gt;
Michael Haigh, head of U.S. commodities research in New York at [[Société Générale]] SA, and former CFTC associate chief economist, said in an interview "It's unprecedented for the CFTC to say that they are in the midst of an investigation.[..] "They may be under pressure from Congress to look at this market given the high prices." Some argued that crude oil market fundamentals drive the price, not the speculative market.&lt;ref name= Yedlin2008witchhunt&gt;{{cite news|title=Witch hunt won't fix oil price|author=Deborah Yedlin|publisher=Calgary Herald|date=June 5, 2008|location=Calgary, Alberta}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
On June 25, 2008 Speaker Pelosi sent a letter to President Bush calling on him to direct the CFTC to use its emergency powers to take immediate action to curb excessive speculation in energy markets, to investigate all energy contracts and that despite growing reports of excessive speculation in energy markets, the CFTC refused to take actions they have taken in the past.&lt;ref name="speaker.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.speaker.gov/legislation?id=0230#emergency |title=Energy Markets Emergency Act |publisher=Speaker Nancy Pelosi |date=June 26, 2008 |accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Energy Markets Emergency Act of 2008]] was a failed bill that would have attempted to curb excessive speculation in the energy futures markets.

In a campaign speech August 2008 presidential candidate [[Barack Obama]] argued that [[loophole]]s in CFTC regulations contributed to [[wikt:skyrocketing|skyrocketing]] prices and lack of transparency on oil markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.barackobama.com/pdf/factsheet_energy_speech_080308.pdf |title=Barack Obama and Joe Biden: New energy for America |format=PDF |publisher=Obama for America |date=August 3, 2008 |accessdate=May 3, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017172925/http://www.barackobama.com/pdf/factsheet_energy_speech_080308.pdf |archivedate=October 17, 2008 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010 Reuters reported that of the "40 major figures in the oil industry, including traders and analysts at some of the largest banks, trading houses and oil companies" interviewed, the vast majority (73 percent) thought increased speculation boosted prices beyond what supply and demand fundamentals dictated.&lt;ref name=reuters20100427 /&gt; [[Peregrine Financial Group]] analyst Phil Flynn argued that in terms of supply and demand fundamentals, oil markets were only the messenger.&lt;ref name=reuters20100427&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/04/27/us-oil-speculation-survey-idUSTRE63Q1FJ20100427|author=David Sheppard |date=April 27, 2010|publisher=Reuters| title=Financial speculation seen boosting oil price: Financial speculators in oil are costing consumers at least $300 billion a year, according to almost 75 percent of industry players surveyed by Reuters.|accessdate=February 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By April the CFTC began to "rein in" speculation in energy and commodity trading, especially oil, and proposed limiting the number of futures contracts financial players can hold at any one time."&lt;ref name=reuters20100427 /&gt;

===Foreign Exchange rates===
In November 2014, the CFTC and the UK Financial Conduct Authority fined six banks for manipulating the [[foreign exchange market]]; JPMorgan, Chase, Citigroup, HSBC, RBS, and UBS paid roughly $1.2 billion to FCA and $1.5 billion, or about $300 million apiece to the CFTC.&lt;ref name=cnbc&gt;{{cite news|author1=Lee Brodie|title=Bank scandal sparks CFTC outrage, aggression|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/102179542|accessdate=December 27, 2014|work=CNBC|publisher=NBC UNiversal|date=November 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regulating digital currencies===
In March 2014 the CFTC acknowledged it was considering the regulation of Bitcoin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=U.S. swaps watchdog says considering bitcoin regulation|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/11/us-bitcoin-regulation-idUSBREA2A1W020140311 |accessdate=March 11, 2014|newspaper=Reuters.com|date=March 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CFTC could treat Bitcoin transactions as swaps, futures, or spot transactions, otherwise Bitcoin would likely be a commodity under the CEA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United States: Bitcoin And The CFTC: "Spot"ing The Jurisdictional Hook |url=http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/299120/Commodities+Derivatives+Stock+Exchanges/Bitcoin+And+The+CFTC+Spoting+The|work=Business and Finance|publisher=Mondaq.com|accessdate=March 13, 2014|author=Todd P. Zerega, Thomas Watterson|date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October, CFTC's Global Markets Advisory Committee discussed [[virtual currency|virtual currencies]]. Mark Wetjen wrote in an OpEd by the WSJ afterwards that ["bitcoin] could play a fascinating role in the derivatives markets as well as financial services."&lt;ref name=wsj1114&gt;{{cite news|author1=Mark Wetjen|title=Bringing Commodities Regulation to Bitcoin|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/mark-wetjen-bringing-commodities-regulation-to-bitcoin-1415060058|accessdate=December 27, 2014|work=WSJ|date=November 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that a swap contract on Bitcoin that had been listed for trading by one registered trading platform was recently presented to CFTC.

In 2015, the CFTC ruled that bitcoin had been properly defined and was lawfully tradable under federal regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bitcoin Futures Flourish Under CFTC Approval, but Danger Still Looms |url=https://whistleblowerjustice.net/bitcoin-futures-flourish-under-cftc-approval-but-danger-still-looms/ |website=Whistleblower Justice Network |accessdate=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in view of the market volatility and magnitude of profitability, the CFTC noted several risks associated with trading virtual currencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Understand the Risks of Virtual Currency Trading |url=https://www.cftc.gov/sites/default/files/idc/groups/public/@customerprotection/documents/file/customeradvisory_urvct121517.pdf |website=Commodities Futures Trading Commission |accessdate=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the CFTC cited the US SEC’s warning against token sales and initial coin offerings (ICOs) that can “improperly entice investors with promises of high returns”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Investor Bulletin: Initial Coin Offerings |url=https://www.sec.gov/oiea/investor-alerts-and-bulletins/ib_coinofferings |publisher=US Securities and Exchange Commission |accessdate=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==

The Commission consists of five [[Commissioners of the CFTC|Commissioners]] appointed by the President of the United States to serve staggered five-year terms. The President, with the consent of the [[United States Senate]], designates one of the Commissioners to serve as Chairman. No more than three Commissioners at any one time may be from the same political party.

The Chairman's staff includes the [[Office of the Inspector General]], which conducts audits of CFTC programs and operations, and the Office of International Affairs, the focal point for the Commission's global regulatory coordination efforts.

The Office of External Affairs (OEA) is the Commission's liaison with news media, producer and market user groups, educational groups, and the general public. OEA provides information about the regulatory mandate, the economic role of the futures markets, new market instruments, market regulation, enforcement actions, and customer protection initiatives.

Violations may involve commodity futures or option trading on domestic commodity exchanges, or the improper marketing of commodity investments. The Division may, at the direction of the Commission, file complaints before the agency's administrative law judges or in the [[U.S. District Courts]]. Alleged criminal violations of the Commodity Exchange Act or violations of other Federal laws which involve commodity futures trading may be referred to the Justice Department for prosecution. The Division also provides expert help and technical assistance with case development and trials to U.S. Attorneys' Offices, other Federal and state regulators, and international authorities. The director of the Division of Enforcement until 2008 was [[Gregory Mocek]], followed by [[David Meister]] until October 2013, followed byGretchen L. Lowe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CFTC Announces Gretchen L.

====Office of Chief Economist====
The Office of the Chief Economist is an independent office with responsibility for providing expert economic advice to the Commission. Its functions include policy analysis, economic research, expert testimony, education, and training. As of 2014 the office is held by Sayee Srinivasan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CFTC Announces Sayee Srinivasan as the Acting Chief Economist |url=http://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/pr6794-13|work=Press room|publisher=CFTC|accessdate=March 13, 2014|date=December 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Office of the General Counsel====
The Office of the General Counsel (OGC) is the Commission's legal advisor. OGC staff represents the Commission in appellate litigation and certain trial-level cases, including bankruptcy proceedings which involve futures industry professionals. As the Commission's legal advisor, OGC reviews all substantive regulatory, legislative, and administrative matters presented to it and advises the Commission on the application and interpretation of the Commodity Exchange Act and other administrative statutes. OGC also assists the Commission in performing its adjudicatory functions. Head as of April 2013 is Jonathan L. Marcus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CFTC Announces Jonathan L. Marcus as General Counsel|url=http://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/pr6562-13|work=Press Room|publisher=CFTC |accessdate=March 13, 2014|date=April 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Office of the Executive Director====
The Office of the Executive Director (OED) formulates and implements the management and administrative policies and functions of the agency. OED staff formulate the agency's budget, supervise the allocation and use of agency resources, promote management controls and financial integrity, and develop and maintain the agency's automated information systems. The Office of Proceedings, which is under the administrative direction of OED, provides an inexpensive and expeditious forum for handling customer complaints against people or firms registered with the [[National Futures Association]] (NFA) through its reparations program. The Office of Proceedings also hears and decides enforcement cases brought by the Commission.

It is responsible for recording and monitoring the trading of [[futures contract]]s on United States [[futures exchange]]s. The CFTC has the authority to fine, suspend, or sue the company or individual in a [[United States federal courts|federal court]] in cases of misconduct, [[fraud]], or if a rule breaking occurs.

The CFTC publishes weekly reports containing details of holdings for market-segments, which have 20 or more reportable participants. The reports are released every Friday (including data from the previous Tuesday) and contain data on open interest split by reportable and non-reportable [[open interest]] as well as commercial and non-commercial open interest. This type of report is referred to as the '[[Commitments of Traders|Commitments of Traders Report]]', COT-Report or simply COTR.

The CFTC is authorized to regulate [[commodity pool]]s and commodity trading advisors. Many [[hedge fund]]s operate as commodity pools. In an address to the [[Securities Industry Association]] in 2004, Sharon Brown-Hruska, acting director of the CFTC, said that 65 of the top 100 hedge funds in 2003 were commodity pools, and 50 out of the 100 largest hedge funds were CTAs in addition to being commodity pools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cftc.gov/opa/speeches04/opabrown-hruska-22.htm |title=Hedge Funds 101: A Primer for Regulators |publisher=Commodity Futures Trading Commission |date=November 30, 2004 |accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Office of the Whistleblower====
In 2012, [[Christopher Ehrman]], a SEC veteran was selected to run the new Office of the Whistleblower for the CFTC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/riskandcompliance/2013/10/18/qa-christopher-ehrman-director-cftcs-whistleblower-office/|title=Q&amp;A: Christopher Ehrman, Director, CFTC's Whistleblower Office|author=Rachel Louise Ensign|work=WSJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview published in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', Mr. Ehrman is quoted: "One is just understanding enforcement. I'm an enforcement guy and I did investigations and brought cases for a number of years. I understand what folks in enforcement are looking for. Whistleblower complaints have no intrinsic value. When they're just sitting here with me, they just don't mean anything. They're valuable to the enforcement division so that they can bring investigations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cftc.gov/ConsumerProtection/WhistleblowerProgram/index.htm|title=CFTC's Whistleblower Program}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website for the program claims that "information that was first submitted to the CFTC after July 21, 2010 – the date of enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act – is eligible for a whistleblower award". And continues to explain "The information, however, can be about conduct that happened at any time".

Under the program, the CFTC will issue rewards to whistleblowers who provide original information that leads to CFTC enforcement actions or “related actions” with total civil penalties in excess of $1 million. A whistleblower may receive a reward of between 10-30 percent of the total sanctions imposed.

The CFTC announced its first award of approximately $240,000 to a whistleblower on May 20, 2014.  The second award of approximately $290,000 was announced on September 29, 2015.

==Funding/budget==
Unlike the other four main financial regulators, the CFTC does not have self-funding. A transaction fee has been "requested" for several years but Congress has not taken any legislative action. During the government shut down in October 2013, SEC and Federal Reserve stayed open, but "futures and most swaps markets were left with essentially no cop on the beat".&lt;ref name=Chilton /&gt;

In 2007, the CFTC's  budget was $98 million and it had 437 full-time equivalent employees (FTEs). After 2008, funding increased by 80% to $205 million and 687 FTEs for fiscal year (FY) 2012, but was cut to $180.4 million and 682 FTEs for FY 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=House panel sticks with CFTC funding cut|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/19/us-usa-cftc-funding-idUSBRE85I1FD20120619|accessdate=March 14, 2014|newspaper=Reuters.com|date=Jun 19, 2012|quote=Georgia Republican Jack Kingston faulted the CFTC for not preventing or foreseeing the collapse of M.F. Global last year or J.P. Morgan's loss of more than $2 billion in derivatives trade this year. "We spent a lot of money. What did we get for it? Zero," said Kingston, adding, "We're not seeing brilliance."}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 CFTC's performance was severely affected by limited resources and had to delay cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=CFTC Backs Off, Lacking Funding|url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB20001424052702303843104579169901294571302 |accessdate=March 14, 2014|newspaper=WSJ.com|date=November 1, 2013|author=Jean Eaglesham}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current, FY 2014 funding of $215m did not keep up with CFTC's increasing swaps market oversight and regulation, equivalent to tens of trillions of dollars in formerly dark market trading, according to outgoing Commissioner Bart Chilton in his last speech.&lt;ref name=Chilton&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement of Commissioner Bart Chilton on the President's FY 2015 Budget |url=http://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/chiltonstatement030414|work=Press Room|publisher=CFTC|accessdate=March 14, 2014 |date=March 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Obama administration's latest budget proposal for FY 2015 requested $280m, which is $35m less than the request for the previous year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obama to Request 30% Bump in CFTC Funding|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/obama-to-request-30-bump-in-cftc-funding-1393639312|accessdate=March 14, 2014 |newspaper=WSJ|date=February 28, 2014|author=Andrew Ackerman}}&lt;/ref&gt; and would fund "100 less employees than we need" per Chilton, who called the budget "woefully insufficient" for CFTC's more than 40-fold increased purview.&lt;ref name=Chilton /&gt;
In February 2014, Commissioner Scott D. O'Malia dissented from the FY 2014 spending plan saying that it did not allocate enough funding to new technology investments, but allocated too much to swap dealer oversight, duplicating the work of the self-regulatory [[National Futures Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement of Dissent by Commissioner Scott D.

The '''Convention on the recognition of registered partnerships ({{Lang-fr|Convention sur la reconnaissance des partenariats enregistrés}})''' is a multilateral convention, drafted by the [[International Commission on Civil Status]] which provides the acceptance in other countries of any form of [[registered partnership]], which is not a marriage&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ciec1.org/Conventions/Conv32Ang.pdf |title=Convention on the recognition of registered partnerships |publisher=[[International Commission on Civil Status]] |accessdate=9 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320051432/http://www.ciec1.org/Conventions/Conv32Ang.pdf |archivedate=20 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Parties to the convention should recognize the partnership, as well as the consequences regarding [[name change]] not only towards other state parties, but with regards to partnerships in any state. The partnership can be between partners of the same or of opposite sex.

==Reservations==
State parties can make reservations regarding
*applicability to persons of the opposite sex
*acceptance of partnerships of any state (rather than states parties to the treaty)
*the consequences regarding name changes

== Member states and signatories ==
The convention has been ratified only by Spain and has been signed only by Spain and Portugal. Having not been ratified by two states, it therefore has not entered into force.

'''David Gene Grimes, II''' (born June 6, 1953) is an [[insurance]] agent and Mediator in [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]], [[Alabama]], who is a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] former member of the [[Alabama House of Representatives]] from District 73 in [[Montgomery County, Alabama|Montgomery County]].

==Background==

A native of [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], Grimes graduated in 1974 from [[Troy State University]] in [[Troy, Alabama|Troy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/candidate/biography/27557/david-grimes#.U2FroctOUfg|title=David Grimes' Biography|publisher=[[Project Vote Smart]]|accessdate=April 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alabama and entered into the life insurance business in 1981. He and his wife, the former Barbara Calhoun (born 1956), a native of [[Opelika, Alabama|Opelika]], Alabama, have two sons: JD and Tyler. He is a member and [[deacon]] of the Trinity [[Presbyterian Church in America|Presbyterian Church]] in Montgomery. He has coached [[Little League]] baseball and served as a board member of the [[YMCA]]'s Camp Chandler. Grimes is affiliated with both [[Rotary International]] and the [[Lions Clubs International|Lions Club]].&lt;ref name=campaigns&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/CandidateDetail.html?CandidateID=28117|title=David Grimes|publisher=ourcampaigns.com|accessdate=April 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political life==

In 2002, Grimes challenged the long-term incumbent state Representative, fellow Republican [[Perry O. Hooper, Jr.]], son of the former [[Chief Justice]] of the [[Alabama Supreme Court]], [[Perry O. Hooper, Sr.]] Grimes defeated Hooper, 3,582 (52.3 percent) to 3,273 (47.8 percent), and was then unopposed in the [[general election]].&lt;ref name=campaigns/&gt; Hooper's defeat is attributed in part to a $12,000 fine in 2001 from the Alabama Ethics Commission.&lt;ref name=ddaily&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legacy.decaturdaily.com/decaturdaily/news/060716/loyalty.shtml|title=Candidates in GOP runoff for PSC 2 question loyalty|publisher=''Decatur Daily'', [[Decatur, Alabama]], July 16, 2006|accessdate=April 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grimes was reelected in 2006 and ran unsuccessfully in 2008 for the [[United States House of Representatives]] from [[Alabama's 2nd congressional district]]. In 2010, he barely won re-nomination to a third term over fellow Republican Jeremy Walker, 2,963 (50.7 percent) to 2,885 (49.3 percent). He then narrowly lost the general election to the Democrat [[Joe Hubbard]], 8,104 (50.9 percent) to  7,817 (49.1 percent).&lt;ref name=campaigns/&gt;

In [[U.S. presidential election, 2012|2012]], Grimes endorsed the candidacy of [[Mitt Romney]] for [[President of the United States]], who won the [[electoral vote]]s of Alabama. Grimes ran unsuccessfully for state House District 77 in 2014. He lost to the incumbent [[African American]] Democrat, Representative [[John Knight (Alabama politician)|John F. Knight, Jr.]]&lt;ref name=campaigns/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5136">'''Debtor-in-possession financing''' or '''DIP financing''' is a special form of [[financing]] provided for companies in [[financial distress]], typically during restructuring under corporate bankruptcy law (such as [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11]] [[Bankruptcy in the United States|bankruptcy]] in the US or [[Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act|CCAA]] in Canada&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Canada Income Tax Act: Enforcement, Collection, Prosecution, 4th Ed.|author=Lyndon Maither, B.C.|publisher=Lyndon Maither|isbn=9781300772286|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mrxbeR2IiXgC|page=319}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Usually, this debt is considered senior to all other [[debt]], [[Stock|equity]], and any other [[Security (finance)|securities]] issued by a company&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Vault Guide to Bankruptcy Law Careers|author1=Stuhl, S.A.|author2=Vault (Firm)|date=2003|publisher=Vault Incorporated|isbn=9781581312577|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=96kIg4mRZQkC|page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; — violating any ''absolute priority rule'' by placing the new financing ahead of a company's existing debts for payment.&lt;ref name="google3"&gt;{{cite book|title=Subnational Insolvency: Cross-Country Experiences and Lessons|author=Liu, L.|date=2008|publisher=World Bank|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FUQRqYb_oj0C|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DIP financing may be used to keep a business operating until it can be sold as a [[going concern]],&lt;ref name="google4"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Canada Income Tax Act: Enforcement, Collection, Prosecution, 6th Edition: |author=Lyndon Maither, B.C.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jZjeAgAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; if this is likely to provide a greater return to creditors than the firm's closure and a [[liquidation]] of assets. It may also give a troubled company a new start, albeit under strict conditions. In this case, "debtor in possession" financing refers to debt incurred while in bankruptcy, and "exit financing" is debt incurred upon emerging from reorganisation under bankruptcy law.&lt;ref name="google5"&gt;{{cite book|title=Commercial Aviation: Bankruptcy and Pension Problems Are Symptoms of Underlying Structural Issues|author=Hecker, J.E.Z.|date=2006|publisher=DIANE Publishing Company|isbn=9781422304327|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NhDjMtWwvwMC|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Two notable examples are the government financing of [[Chrysler]]&lt;ref name="google6"&gt;{{cite book|title=Financial Audit: Office of Financial Stability (Troubled Asset Relief Program) Fiscal Year 2009 Financial Statements|author=Engel, G.T.|date=2010|publisher=DIANE Publishing Company|isbn=9781437926811|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D3NU3Ohs0hsC|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[General Motors]]&lt;ref name="google7"&gt;{{cite book|title=Troubled Asset Relief Program (SIGTARP): Quarterly Report to Congress by the Office of the Special Inspector General (SIGTARP)(October 26, 2010)|author=Barofsky, N.|date=2011|publisher=DIANE Publishing Company|isbn=9781437942019|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7tcGqgQvLTYC|page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; during their respective 2009 bankruptcies.

==American law vs. French law==
The willingness of governments to allow lenders to place debtor-in-possession financing claims ahead of an insolvent company's existing debt varies; US bankruptcy law expressly allows this&lt;ref name="google8"&gt;{{cite book|title=Use of TARP Funds in the Support and Reorganization of the Domestic Automotive Industry|author=Warren, E.|date=2010|publisher=DIANE Publishing Company|isbn=9781437923698|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FODXmeZA6xgC|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; while French law had long treated the practice as ''soutien abusif'', requiring employees and state interests be paid first even if the end result was liquidation instead of corporate restructuring.&lt;ref name="google9"&gt;{{cite book|title=Corporate Restructuring: Lessons from Experience|author1=Pomerleano, M.|author2=Shaw, W.|author3=Bank, W.|date=2005|publisher=World Bank|isbn=9780821359280|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7MbS7-At5XAC|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14594">A '''decree''' is a rule of [[law]] usually issued by a [[head of state]] (such as the [[president]] of a [[republic]] or a [[monarch]]), according to certain procedures (usually established in a constitution). It has the force of law. The particular term used for this concept may vary from country to country. The ''[[executive order]]s'' made by the [[President of the United States]], for example, are decrees (although a decree is not exactly an order). In non-legal [[English language|English]] usage, however, the term refers to any [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] decision.{{dubious|date=June 2013}} Documents or archives in the format of royal decrees or farming were issued by rulers.{{clarify|date=June 2018}}

==Decree by jurisdiction==

===Belgium===
{{Main|Decree (Belgium)}}
In [[Belgium]], a decree is a law of a [[Communities, regions and language areas in Belgium|community or regional]] parliament, e.g. the [[Flemish Parliament]].

===France===
{{See also|Politics of France}}
The word ''décret'', literally "decree", is an old legal usage in France and is used to refer to executive orders issued by the French [[President of France|President]] or [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]]. Any such order must not violate the [[Constitution of France|French Constitution]] or [[Civil Code of France|Civil Code]], and a party has the right to request an order be annulled in the French [[Conseil d'Etat (France)|Council of State]]. Orders must be ratified by Parliament before they can be modified into legislative Acts. Special orders known as ''décret-loi'', literally "decree-act" or "decree-law",&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/decree-law "decree-law"] in the Random House Dictionary.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/decree-law "decree-law"] in the Merriam-Webster Dictionary.&lt;/ref&gt; usually considered an illegal practice under the 3rd and 4th Republic, were finally abolished and replaced by the ordinances under the 1958 Constitution.

Except for the reserve powers of the President (as stated in Art. 16 of the 1958 Constitution, exercised only once so far), the executive can issue decrees in areas that the Constitution grants as the responsibility of Parliament only if a law authorizes it to do so. In other cases, orders are illegal and, should anyone sue for the order's annulment, it would be voided by the Council of State. There exists a procedure for the Prime Minister to issue [[ordonnance|ordinances]] in such areas, but this procedure requires Parliament's express consent (see Art 38 of the 1958 Constitution).

Orders issued by the Prime Minister take two forms:
*Orders (''décrets simples'');
*Orders-in-council (''décrets en Conseil d'État''), when a statute mandates the advisory consultation of the [[Council of State (France)|Council of State]].

Sometimes, people refer to ''décrets en Conseil d'État'' improperly as ''décrets du Conseil d'État''. This would imply that it is the Council of State that takes the decree, whereas the power of decreeing is restricted to the president or prime minister; the role of the administrative sections of the Council is purely advisory.

Decrees may be classified into:
*[[Regulation]]s, which may be:
**Application decrees (''décrets d'application''), each of which must be specifically authorized by one or more [[statute]]s to determine some [[implementation]] conditions of this or these statutes; these constitute [[secondary legislation]] and are roughly equivalent to British [[statutory instruments]];
**Autonomous regulations (''règlement autonomes''), which may be taken only in areas where the Constitution does not impose statute law (passed by the [[Legislature]]); these constitute [[primary legislation]];
*Particular measures, such as the nomination of high-level [[French Civil Service|civil servants]].

Only the prime minister may issue regulatory or application decrees. Presidential decrees are  generally nominations, or exceptional measures where law mandates a presidential decree, such as the dissolution of the [[French National Assembly]] and the calling of new legislative elections.

Decrees are published in the ''[[Journal Officiel de la République Française]]'' or "French Gazette".

===Catholic Church===
{{canon law}}
{{main|Decree (canon law)|Canon law (Catholic Church)}}
{{see also|Decretal|Decretum Gratiani}}
A decree ([[Ecclesiastical Latin|Latin]]: ''decretum'') in the usage of the [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] of the [[Catholic Church]] has various meanings. Any [[papal Bull]], [[papal brief|Brief]], or [[Motu Proprio]] is a decree inasmuch as these documents are legislative acts of the [[Pope]]. In this sense the term is quite ancient. The [[Roman Congregations]] were formerly empowered to issue decrees in matters which come under their particular jurisdiction, but were forbidden from continuing to do so under [[Pope Benedict XV]] in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;René Metz, ''What is Canon Law?''&lt;/ref&gt; Each [[ecclesiastical province]], and also each [[diocese]] may issue decrees in their periodical [[synods]] within their sphere of authority. 

Canon 29 of the 1983 Code of Canon Law offers a definition of general decrees:
{{quote|General decrees, by which a competent legislator makes common provisions for a community capable of receiving a law, are true laws and are regulated by the provisions of the canons on laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P4.HTM Canon 29], [[1983 Code of Canon Law]]; accessed 30 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Holy See===
{{main|Law of Vatican City|Decretal|Decree (canon law)}}
{{see also|Canon law (Catholic Church)}}
The [[Holy See]] uses decrees from the [[pope]] such as  [[papal bull]], [[papal brief]] or [[motu proprio]] as legislative acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2007-02-17|work=[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04670a.htm|title=Decree}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Italy ===
{{main|Law of Italy}}
According clause 77 of the [[Italian Constitution]], "The Government may not, without an enabling act from the Houses, issue decrees having the force of ordinary law.
When in extraordinary cases of necessity and urgency the Government adopts provisional measures having the force of law, it must on the same day present said measures for confirmation to the Houses which, even if dissolved, shall be summoned especially for this purpose and shall convene within five days.
The decrees lose effect from their inception if they are not confirmed within sixty days from their publication. The Houses may however regulate by law legal relationships arising out of not confirmed decrees."

The effectiveness for sixty days produces the effects immediately, giving rights or expectations whose legal basis was in fact precarious, especially when the conversion law never intervened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero|title = Sanatoria del condono decaduto: a favore dei centri di recupero ma a rischio di incostituzionalità |journal= Diritto&amp;Giustizia edizione online |date=2000| url= https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89286997}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portugal===

# Decree ({{lang-pt|decreto}}): is an act issued by the Government of Portugal to an approve international agreement whose approval is not within the competence of the [[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|Assembly of the Republic]] or has not been submitted to it or within the Government administrative jurisdiction laid down in Article 199 of the Constitution in relation to a statute that requires this decree;
# Regulatory decree ({{lang-pt|decreto regulamentar}}): is an act issued by the Government of Portugal, under its administrative jurisdiction laid down in Article 199 of the Constitution, to make the necessary regulations for the proper execution of the laws and to take all actions and decisions necessary to promote economic and social development and to meet the community needs;

===Iran===

According to the article 110 of the [[Constitution of Iran|constitution]], the [[Supreme Leader of Iran|supreme leader]] delineates the general policies of the Islamic Republic.

===Russia===
{{main|Decree of the President of Russia}}
After the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]], a government proclamation of wide meaning was called a "decree" (Russian: декрет, dekret); more specific proclamations were called ''ukaz''. Both terms are usually translated as 'decree'.

According to the [[Constitution of Russia|Russian Federation's 1993 constitution]], an ''[[Ukaz]]'' is a Presidential decree. Such ukazes have the power of laws, but may not alter the Russian constitution or the regulations of existing laws, and may be superseded by laws passed by the [[Federal Assembly of Russia|Federal Assembly]].

The [[Government of Russia]] can also issue decrees formally called Decisions (Постановления) or Orders (Распоряжения) and may not contradict the constitution/laws or presidential decrees.

===Saudi Arabia===
Royal decrees are the source of law in Saudi Arabia.

===Spain===
In Spain, decrees come in a number of forms:

*Royal decree
*[[Royal Decree-Law (Spain)|Royal Decree-Law]]
*[[Royal Legislative Decree (Spain)|Royal Legislative Decree]]

=== United Kingdom ===
{{main|Order-in-Council}}
In the [[United Kingdom]], Orders-in-Council are either primary legislation deriving their authority from the [[Royal Prerogative]], promulgated by the Privy Council in the name of the Monarch; or secondary legislation, promulgated by a Minister of the Crown using authority granted by an Act of Parliament or other primary legislation. Both are subject to [[Judicial review in English law|judicial review]], the former with some exceptions.

===United States===
{{main|Law of the United States}}
In US legal usage, during the 19th and early 20th centuries, a '''decree''' was an order of a [[court of equity]] determining the rights of the parties to a suit, according to equity and good conscience. Since the 1938 procedural merger of law and equity in the federal courts under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the term ''judgment'' (the parallel term in common law) has generally replaced ''decree''. This is now true also in most state courts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/decree West's Encyclopedia of American Law] (2d ed. 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''decree'' has had a similar usage in admiralty, probate, and divorce law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.law.com/Default.aspx?selected=449 Law.com].&lt;/ref&gt;

A decree is often a final determination, but there are also interlocutory decrees. A ''final decree'' fully and finally disposes of the whole litigation, determining all questions raised by the case, and it leaves nothing that requires further judicial action; it is also appealable. An ''interlocutory decree'' is a provisional or preliminary decree that is not final and does not fully determine the suit, so that some further proceedings are required before entry of a final decree.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thelawdictionary.org/decree/ Black's Law Dictionary Free Online Legal Dictionary 2d ed.]&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually not appealable, although preliminary injunctions by federal courts are appealable even though interlocutory.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/preliminary_injunction Cornell Law School], Legal Information Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Executive order]]s, which are instructions from the President to the executive branch of government, are decrees in the general sense in that they have the force of law, although they cannot override statute law or the Constitution and are subject to judicial review.

==Other uses of the term==
In some jurisdictions, certain types of [[court orders]] by [[judge]]s are referred to as decrees, e.g. a [[divorce]] decree.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9880">:''For the [[Ffestiniog Railway]]'s use of the word "deviationist", see [[Ffestiniog Railway#The Llyn Ystradau Deviation]].''
In [[political ideology]], a '''deviationist''' is a person who expresses a deviation: an abnormality or departure. In [[Stalinism | Stalinist]] ideology and practice, deviationism is an expressed belief which does not accord with official party doctrine for the time and area. Accusations of deviationism often led to [[purge]]s.  Forms of deviationism included [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionism]], [[dogmatism]], [[bourgeois nationalism]], and [[rootless cosmopolitanism]].

[[Mao Zedong]] in a 1953 speech referred to both "[[left-wing politics|left]]" and "[[right-wing politics|right]]" deviationists.&lt;ref&gt;Mao Zedong, [http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-5/mswv5_28.htm Refute Right Deviationist Views That Depart From the General Line], June 15, 1953. Online at Marxists.org. Accessed online 2009-10-11.&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, in 1976, the so-called [[Gang of Four]] would strike out against "rightist deviationism" in China.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trotskyism==
[[Leon Trotsky]] believed that Lenin's pre-1917 idea of the "[[dictatorship of the proletariat]]" needed to be re-worded to emphasize the importance of the proletariat's leadership in such an alliance, because the [[peasant]]ry were [[dialectical]]ly less capable of leadership. In order to finish a socialist revolution, the revolution would have to be world-wide. This is in sharp contrast to [[Joseph Stalin]]'s idea of "socialism in one country;" Trotsky felt that if a socialist nation-state was isolated, it would soon be destroyed by outside imperialist forces. Trotsky emphasized the importance of soviets (independent councils of workers) and the idea that a communist society will be a "workers' democracy."

According to Trotskyist doctrine,&lt;ref&gt;James Burnham, ''The Managerial Revolution'', Indiana University Press, Bloomingham 1966, p.v.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Soviet Union]] became a "degenerated workers state" and the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (CPSU) as "bureaucratic centralist." Trotskyites considered the Soviet degenerated workers state still as "revolutionary workers' state" or "proletarian dictatorship." As such, the Soviet state was "[[Progressivism|historically progressive]]" in relation to "reactionary capitalism." Hence it was the duty of revolutionists in all nations, even if they were opponents of Stalin and his regime, to defend the Soviet Union against any "imperialist" state, including their own fatherland. Another revolution was necessary however to unseat the Stalinists, who would destroy the workers state until it became fully capitalist.

==Browderism==
Before [[World War II]] the [[Communist Party USA]] (CPUSA) had always received directives and funds from the [[Soviet Union]] via courier. Moscow's most effective control had been through [[Comintern]] representatives.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Budenz, ''Men Without Faces: The Communist Conspiracy in the USA,'' Harper and Brothers, New York, 1948, pp. 4-5, 55, 68-69, 78-81.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Earl Browder]], CPUSA leader, accepted the [[Hitler-Stalin pact]] of August 1939 without hesitation. Comintern did find it necessary to fine-tune the CPUSA’s stance.  Immediately after the Pact, [[Georgi Dimitrov]], chief of the Comintern, sent a ciphered message to Browder explaining that the CPUSA’s line supporting the Pact was not fully correct because while it broke with President [[Franklin Roosevelt]]’s policy of supporting Britain, France, and [[Lend-Lease]] aid, it failed to take the additional step of breaking with FDR’s domestic policies as well. Browder and the CPUSA immediately made the required changes in its policies, and in 1940 the CPUSA did its best to oppose FDR’s reelection to the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey Klehr, John Earl Haynes, and Kyrill M. Anderson, ''The Soviet World of American Communism,'' New Haven: Yale University Press, 1998, pp. 71–84.&lt;/ref&gt;

World War II reduced the direct organization ties of CPUSA to Comintern and drastically reduced the volume of communications. Postal communications was less reliable and often delayed and subject to government inspection. International cable traffic was routinely reviewed by war-time security officials. Travel to the USSR became increasingly difficult. In 1940 the [[Jerry Voorhis#Record and campaigns|Voorhis Act]] was passed imposing regulatory requirements on domestic American organizations with foreign government ties. To avoid the Voorhis Act, in November 1940, CPUSA, with Comintern permission, severed its official membership in the Communist International, and the last officially designated CPUSA representative in Moscow left in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Klehr, Haynes, and Anderson, The Soviet World, pp. 87–88.&lt;/ref&gt;

Browder developed the doctrine of indefinite collaboration with capitalism and the [[Harry Bridges]] doctrine of postwar extension of the no-strike pledge.

The wartime coalition gave Browder the vision of an Americanized Communist Party working with other American parties to solve the urgent questions facing the nation. To this end he began a policy of naturalizing the party, relaxing its discipline, and moderating its sectarianism. He transformed the wartime tactic of national unity into a postwar strategy and argued the possibility that progressive capitalism, to save itself, would embark on policies favorable to the workers at home and to the Soviet Union abroad.

In April 1945, however, [[Jacques Duclos]] of the [[French Communist Party]], formerly high in the Comintern, published a repudiation of Browderism.&lt;ref&gt;
Jaques Duclos, [http://www.marxists.org/history/usa/parties/cpusa/1945/04/0400-duclos-ondissolution.pdf ''On the Dissolution of the Communist Party of the United States,''.] Published in ''Cahiers du Communisme,'' April 1945. Reprinted in [[William Z. Foster]] et al. ''Marxism-Leninism vs. Revisionism.'' (New York: New Century Publishers, Feb. 1946), pp. 21-35 in original.
&lt;/ref&gt;
Publication of the attack by the ''New York World-Telegram'' panicked the CPUSA into drastic action against Browder: they unceremoniously expelled him in February 1946.

==Titoism==
[[Titoism]] is a form of Leninism based on the regime of Marshal [[Josip Broz Tito]] post-[[World War II]] in [[Yugoslavia]]. While formerly heading a [[Comintern]] [[liberation movement]], after the war Tito broke with [[Moscow]] and insisted Yugoslavia was to be non-aligned with neither [[NATO]] nor the [[Warsaw Pact]]. Tito called for "national unity" and "self-management" which enabled Yugoslavia to form relationships independent of the [[superpower]]s with other governments during the [[Cold War]].

==Maoism==
Maoism mixes orthodox Marxism–Leninism with [[populism]]. Named after its originator [[Mao Zedong]], the ideology relies on militant, insurrectionary and populist strategies in [[community organizing|movement organizing]] (People’s Wars, [[Cultural Revolution]], Peasant Uprising, etc.). Like Stalin, Mao’s China relied on Five-Year Plans, the best-known of which was the [[Great Leap Forward]]. 

This view of the CCP contrasted sharply with the view of [[Moscow]] whose [[ideology]] was in line with orthodoxy of [[historical materialism]] of Marxism's early thinkers, that socialist societies must be preceded by capitalist societies, which would provide the material basis for a socialist economy. This orthodox theory of Marxism relied heavily on a dialectical "force of history" that would inevitably bring about the "objective conditions" necessary for a [[proletariat|proletarian]] revolution to succeed. Any ideological concepts running counter to this thesis, that is, any formulations which called for skipping stages of historic development were considered in the orthodox view as adventuristic and [[counter revolutionary]].&lt;ref&gt;Foreign Influence - Weather Underground Organization (WUO).

Maoist deviationism inspired students and other young people who looked to the [[Chinese Red Guards]] as a model of [[activism]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Costello, U.S. Anti-Revisionism [http://marxists.architexturez.net/history/erol/1960-1970/index.htm Third Wave, 1960-1970], Encyclopedia of Anti-Revisionism On-Line.

Retrieved March 16, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; While some of these young activists were drawn to the [[Progressive Labor Party (United States)|Progressive Labor Party]] (PLP), the full flowering of American Maoism would not come until the proliferation of new groups such as the [[Students for a Democratic Society]] (SDS), [[Weather Underground]] (WUO), [[Black Panthers]] (BPP) and the [[Communist Party (Marxist–Leninist) (USA)|Communist Party (Marxist–Leninist)]] (CP-ML) after 1969.

==Other types of deviationism==

The term has also been used with respect to other [[ideology|ideologies]]. In 2002 the Religious Affairs Minister of [[Brunei]] in Southeast Asia used the same term to describe what he considered to be incorrect, presumably non-mainstream [[Islam]]ic teachings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bahaindex.com/en/news/1-general-news/2348-beware-of-deviationist-teachings-warns-religions-minister Beware Of Deviationist Teachings, Warns Religions Minister], 23 October 2002, BruDirect.com; reproduced on bahaindex.com, The [[Baha'i]] Faith Index.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44282">A '''duopoly''' (or '''twinstick''', referring to "stick" as [[jargon]] for a [[Radio masts and towers|radio tower]]) is a situation in [[terrestrial television|television]] and [[radio industry|radio]] broadcasting in which two or more stations in the same city or community share [[common ownership]].

==United States==
In the [[United States]], the practice of duopolies has been frowned upon when using public airwaves, on the premise that it gives too much influence to one company. However, rules governing radio stations are less restrictive than those for television, allowing as many as six radio stations under common ownership in the largest U.S. [[media market]]s.&lt;ref name="FCClocal"&gt;{{cite web|title=FCC revives local television ownership rules|url=http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Mass_Media/News_Releases/1999/nrmm9019.html|work=[[Federal Communications Commission]]|date=August 5, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ownership of television stations with overlapping coverage areas was normally not allowed in the United States prior to 2002, even those that were not duopolies under the present legal definition, by way of being located in separate albeit adjacent markets; this required broadcasters to apply for crossownership waivers in some cases to retain full-power stations based in adjacent markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FCC grant of request for waiver of the duopoly rule for WCAU-TV (Philadelphia) / WNBC (New York City)|url=http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Mass_Media/News_Releases/nrmm5081.txt|work=Federal Communications Commission|date=July 25, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Non-commercial educational]] broadcasters, mainly those that were [[Network affiliate#Member stations|members]] of the Public Broadcasting Service ([[PBS]]), were the only licensees allowed to sign-on or acquire a second television station that did not repeat the parent station's signal in the same market where they already owned a station (some of these acquired stations were originally licensed as commercial outlets).

On August 5, 1999, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] voted 4-1 to allow common ownership of two television stations within a single market by one company,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=F.C.C. Eases Limits on TV Station Ownership|url=http://emoglen.law.columbia.edu/LIS/archive/barbecue/tv-station-ownership.html|author=Bill Carter|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[Columbia University]]|date=August 6, 1999|accessdate=February 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; so long as eight unique station owners remain in the market once the duopoly is formed, and the four highest-rated stations (based on local monthly viewership reports for the market) remain under separate ownership.&lt;ref name="FCClocal"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Business of News: A challenge for journalism's next generation|url=http://www.carnegie.org/pdf/businessofnews2.pdf|author=Cynthia Gorney|publisher=Carnegie Corporation of New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FCC only requires the severance of an existing duopoly in which a once lower-rated station falls within the ratings criteria that prohibits such ownership over time if an ownership transaction is under review (such as a piecemeal or group sale of stations, or necessary license transfers during an ownership transaction involving the stations' existing owner); a company is required to sell one of the stations in the duopoly to another licensee if it is no longer compliant with one or both provisions.

Once a duopoly is formed, the acquiring company takes over the operations of its new property.  The operations of the two stations are usually consolidated into one facility, depending on the size and age of the facility chosen to house their operations. Since the stations involved in the duopoly are not restricted by FCC law from consolidating their operations, duplicative jobs at one of the stations are often terminated as the consolidation takes effect.

News departments are also often consolidated into a singular operation, with anchoring and reporting staffs from the respective stations often being folded into one unit, subject to hiring determinations made by management; anchors and reporters are usually shared between the two stations, though in some cases, certain anchors may be employed to appear only on each station's own newscasts. In some cases (like with [[WHDH (TV)|WHDH]] and [[WLVI]] in [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]], when the former's owner [[Sunbeam Television]] formed a duopoly with WLVI after purchasing the station from [[Tribune Broadcasting]] in 2006), the junior partner's news department is shut down completely, with the senior partner subsequently taking over production of its news content using only their existing staff. In many cases, news programming on a junior partner is structured to avoid direct competition with a senior partner affiliate of either [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[NBC]] or [[CBS]] (one notable exception involves [[WTTV]] and [[WXIN (TV)|WXIN]] in [[Indianapolis]], which carry competing morning and evening newscasts as Tribune Broadcasting opted to launch a separate slate of newscasts for WTTV when it became a CBS affiliate in January 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CBS affiliation switch means major changes at WTTV|url=http://www.ibj.com/cbs-affiliation-switch-means-major-changes-at-wttv/PARAMS/article/48994|author=Anthony Schoetle|work=[[Indianapolis Business Journal]]|publisher=[[American City Business Journals]]|date=August 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than shift those seen on sister [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliate WXIN to the station; WXIN and WTTV largely maintain their own anchors, but share a news department and most reporting staff). This situation is uncommon in duopolies involving only [[Big Three television networks|Big Three]] affiliates, as stations affiliated with those networks are more inclined to carry newscasts in overlapping time periods in order to fulfill local programming requirements included in affiliation agreements.

Certain [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] programs are also shared between the stations, in the form of either same-day repeat airings of programs seen on the one which holds primary rights or separated runs of programs that air on each station, although each station maintains separate syndication inventories as well. The junior partner, unless it is affiliated with a major network, may also be used to carry network (and occasionally, first-run syndicated) programs that the senior partner is unable to broadcast because of long-form [[breaking news]] or [[severe weather]] coverage or a locally produced [[television special|special]] airing in a scheduled program's normal timeslot, or in the case of certain non-prime time network programs, because the senior partner chooses not to carry it on its regular schedule to carry other scheduled programming.

Although the FCC bars common ownership of any of the four major broadcast networks (ABC, NBC, CBS and Fox), it does not prohibit duopolies involving stations affiliated individually with any two of them, unless both are among the four highest-rated in the market at the time of a sale. As such, several Big Four duopolies exist based on certain market conditions that originally allowed them to be formed under the criteria (such as a company having acquired one of the major network stations as a low-rated affiliate of a smaller network prior to an affiliation switch or the ratings of a non-English station placing among the top four over a Big Four network affiliate). While most duopolies are made up of a senior partner that is affiliated with one of the four major networks and an affiliate of a minor network (such as [[The CW]] and [[MyNetworkTV]]) or an [[Independent station (North America)|independent station]] as the junior partner, those in which both stations are major network affiliates typically involve a Fox station (which serves as the junior partner in all but a few instances) and an ABC, CBS or NBC affiliate, with some limited arrangements where two Big Three affiliates are jointly owned or managed.

One of the few markets where two major network duopolies exist in some form is [[Jacksonville, Florida]], where two companies once owned the licenses of the Big Four stations they respectively controlled. In 2000, the [[Gannett Company]], owner of NBC affiliate [[WTLV]], purchased ABC affiliate [[WJXX]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/121399/bus_1h10TV25.html|title=Changing the channel|last=Patton|first=Charlie|date=December 13, 1999|work=The Florida Times-Union|accessdate=February 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had struggled in the local ratings since its sign-on in February 1997 (when it took the ABC affiliation from [[WCWJ|WJKS]] through a [[1994 United States broadcast TV realignment#Other station group deals|group affiliation deal]] with the [[Allbritton Communications Company]]) due to its status as a relatively new station and issues with signal interference from PBS station [[WJCT (TV)|WJCT]] on its [[Mediacom]] cable channel slot. The following year, [[iHeartMedia|Clear Channel Communications]] created a legal duopoly involving its existing Fox affiliate WAWS (now [[WFOX-TV]]) and WTEV-TV (now [[WJAX-TV]]), a [[UPN]] affiliate that it had been managing under a local marketing agreement since 1994; WTEV's viewership gradually rose after it became a CBS affiliate in July 2002, putting it in the top four threshold with WAWS, resulting in [[Newport Television]] – upon purchasing the Clear Channel television group in 2007 – restructuring the operation as a virtual duopoly by selling WTEV to shell licensee High Plains Broadcasting (WFOX and WJAX are now respectively owned by the [[Cox Media Group]] and Bayshore Television, LLC, but remain under common management though an LMA in which WJAX is the junior partner).

The use of [[digital subchannel]]s has been termed an "instant duopoly," because of the ease by which a single digital station can deliver multiple channels of programming from different networks at the same time. One station can carry four or more [[standard-definition television|standard definition]] digital channels; multiple [[high-definition television|high definition]] feeds typically require too large a bitrate size to be carried on different subchannels of the same station simultaneously without loss of image quality.

===Virtual duopolies===
Some broadcasting companies have used [[loophole]]s to establish duopolies in smaller markets by way of a [[local marketing agreement|local marketing agreement, shared services agreement or joint sales agreement]]; where a station effectively [[Brokered programming|brokers]] its entire airtime to the owner of another station in the market, which becomes responsible for handling its programming and advertising sales – and in effect, operations. These are termed as "virtual duopolies" as the station's license is held by one company, while its operations are handled by another. Through a 2014 FCC ruling, joint sales agreements in which the senior partner sells a minimum of 15% of the advertising time for its junior partner are counted toward ownership caps.&lt;ref name=tvnc-wrongway&gt;{{cite web|title=FCC Moving The Wrong Way On JSAs|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/64074/fcc-moving-the-wrong-way-on-jsas|website=TVNewsCheck|publisher=NewsCheckMedia|accessdate=September 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some larger broadcasting companies have controversially built business models around the practice, by funding the acquisition of stations by what are effectively [[shill]] companies or [[shell corporation]]s; for example, [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]] operates the stations of [[Cunningham Broadcasting]] and [[Deerfield Media]] under LMAs or SSAs. Nearly all of Cunningham's stock is held by trusts in the name of Sinclair's founders and owners, the Smith family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Family's TV Clout in Bush's Corner|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A25406-2004Oct11.html|author=Howard Kurtz|author2=Frank Ahrens|newspaper=''[[The Washington Post]]''|page=A1|date=October 12, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Nexstar Media Group]] funds the purchase of stations by [[Mission Broadcasting]], which forms duopolies with their stations through shared services agreements with a Nexstar station.&lt;ref name=nyt-change&gt;{{cite web|title=You Can Change the Channel, but Local News Is the Same|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/business/media/local-tv-stations-cut-costs-by-sharing-news-operations.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=1&amp;ref=business|author=Brian Stelter|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|accessdate=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the senior partner may acquire a station's physical assets and intellectual property (such as the station's facilities and programming rights), but spin off the license itself to a shell corporation and enter into an agreement to operate the station, making it the ''de facto'' owner, but not the legal owner. Following the purchase, the station's operations and programming are often merged into that of its new parent station.&lt;ref name=nyt-change/&gt;&lt;ref name="hsb-tvswap"&gt;{{cite news|title=Execs explain TV swap, but some see it as blurry|url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/content/20090820_Execs_explain_TV_swap_but_some_see_it_as_blurry|author=Erika Engle|work=[[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]]|publisher=Oahu Publications|date=August 20, 2009|accessdate=December 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a company that acquires an existing legal duopoly that is no longer complies with FCC rules on  duopoly ownership may spin off the junior partner station's license to a shell, rather than sell one of the stations to a licensee that would also assume operational responsibilities, allowing the restructured duopoly to remain under common operation through a resulting management agreement.

In some cases, the use of an adjacent-market [[city of license]] has been used on a secondary station to avoid a limit on the number of stations controlled by the same broadcaster in the same market. Occasionally, those arrangements cross international borders. For instance, [[radio station]] [[WLYK]] in [[Cape Vincent (town), New York|Cape Vincent, New York]] in the United States is operated from the Canadian studios of [[Kingston, Ontario]]'s [[CIKR-FM]], a broadcaster already at the two-station limit in its own market, under an LMA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=102.7 The Lake WLYK|url=http://www.1027thelake.com/page/feedback.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Broadcasters such as [[Entravision Communications Corporation|Entravision]] have often entered into local marketing agreements with Mexican border stations (such as [[Tecate]]'s [[XHDTV-TDT]] for content directed at [[San Diego, California|San Diego]]).

===Failing station waivers===
It is also possible to obtain a "failing station waiver," which can exempt a broadcaster from some portion of the existing restrictions on common ownership in order to acquire and operate a station which otherwise would be economically non-viable or would be forced to [[dark (broadcasting)|cease operations]].

Requests for failing station waivers have historically met with variable reception; in general, a prospective buyer is on the same wavelength with the FCC on failing-station policies if it can demonstrate to the Commission that:
* The failing station consistently received less than 4% of all local all-day audience share;
* the station is in poor financial condition, normally operating at a loss for at least the previous three years;
* the merger will produce public interest benefits, and;
* the in-market buyer is the only suitable candidate as a sale to an out-of-market buyer would result in an artificially depressed price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FCC application to assign the license for KNIN-TV (CW 9 Caldwell, Idaho) to Journal Broadcast Corp (KIVI-TV)|url=http://www.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2008/db1110/DA-08-2471A1.txt|work=Federal Communications Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Waivers under these criteria were granted to sell [[WASV-TV]] in [[Asheville, North Carolina|Asheville]] to [[Media General]], owner of CBS affiliate [[WSPA-TV]] in that market,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FCC application for assignment of WASV-TV, Asheville, North Carolina|url=http://ftp.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Mass_Media/Orders/2002/da020103.pdf|work=Federal Communications Commission|date=January 15, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[KWBA-TV|KWBA]] in [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] to the [[Journal Communications|Journal Broadcast Group]], owner of that market's ABC affiliate [[KGUN-TV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Epic fail: FCC gives Tucson a "failing station" TV duopoly|url=https://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080603-epic-fail-fcc-gives-tucson-a-failing-station-tv-duopoly.html|author=Matthew Lasar|work=ArsTechica|date=June 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FCC green lights sale of KWBA to KGUN owner|url=http://www.azbiz.com/articles/2008/06/06/media_technology/inside_media/doc48497d44733b5027858362.txt|author=David Hatfield|work=Inside Tucson Business''|date=June 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar waiver was refused to [[KNIN-TV]] in [[Boise, Idaho|Boise]] as the station, a CW affiliate at the time the waiver application was filed, appeared to have reasonable prospects of financial break-even without a takeover by Journal-owned ABC affiliate [[KIVI-TV]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Journal Boise duop dropped|url=http://www.rbr.com/tv-cable/tv_deals/11178.html|work=Radio-Television Business Report|date=November 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; that decision was subsequently appealed, with the waiver being granted upon further review (Journal Broadcast Group would eventually be required to sell KNIN in 2014, as the station's financial condition improved enough in its post-2011 existence as a Fox affiliate to make it unsuitable for the [[E. W. Scripps Company]] – which was in the process of purchasing Journal's broadcasting unit in a deal in which Journal simultaneously merged with Scripps' publishing unit – to acquire it under a renewed waiver, in addition to the fact that it could not acquire it legally as the market had fewer than eight unique owners&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=FCC Okays Scripps/Journal Merger|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/washington/fcc-okays-scrippsjournal-merger/136355|author=John Eggerton|work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]|date=December 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

===Low-power TV stations===
[[Low-power broadcasting|Low-power]] and [[Class A television service|Class A]] television stations are not subject to ownership caps in the United States, as their broadcast signals do not reach as many homes as full-power stations. In areas with high [[cable television]] penetration, this distinction is essentially meaningless. LPTV stations were also exempt from [[Digital television transition in the United States|digital television transition]] requirements imposed on full-service broadcasters upon the June 2009 digital conversion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtv2009.gov/lowpower}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FCC consumer facts: Low Power television service|url=http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/consumerfacts/lptv.html|work=Federal Communications Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As such, low-power stations can also be formed to create duopolies; for instance, [[Weigel Broadcasting]] maintains triopolies in three markets surrounding the southern part of [[Lake Michigan]] ([[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]]; [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, Wisconsin]]; and [[South Bend, Indiana]]) using a combination of full-power and low-power television stations. In Chicago, it maintains one full-power signal (independent station [[WCIU-TV]]) and two low-power stations ([[WWME-CD]] and [[WMEU-CA]], the flagship stations of the [[Me-TV]] digital subchannel network). In Milwaukee, Weigel has two full-power stations (CBS affiliate [[WDJT-TV]] and full-power independent station [[WMLW-TV]]) and two low-power stations (Me-TV station [[WBME-CD]] and [[Telemundo]] affiliate [[WYTU-LD]], though the latter station uses a subchannel of WMLW as its main conduit for cable carriage). Weigel also takes advantage of digital subchannel broadcasting heavily and airs [[This TV]] in Milwaukee and South Bend, and [[Bounce TV]] in Chicago and Milwaukee; the company had also previously executed time share agreements on other subchannels with ethnic broadcasters, and in Milwaukee, a local real estate agency to air programming.

A similar situation exists in [[Lima, Ohio]], where [[Block Communications]] controls a quadropoly of stations owned by itself ([[WLIO]], a full-powered NBC affiliate which also carries Fox and MyNetworkTV on a digital subchannel) and low-power stations owned by West Central Ohio Broadcasting, Inc. (which owns ABC affiliate [[WLQP-LP]]/[[WOHL-CD]], and CBS affiliate [[WLMO-LP]]) under an LMA. One of the latter company's heads, Allan J. Block, is the chairman of Block Communications.&lt;ref name="tvbr-mvptowcob"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rbr.com/tv-cable/tv_deals/11550.html|title=Phipps flips Lima low-power cluster|date=November 29, 2008|work=Television Business Report|accessdate=December 1, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601041600/http://www.rbr.com/tv-cable/tv_deals/11550.html|archivedate=June 1, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group is the sole over-air provider of secular network television programming in the Lima market, though area cable systems also carry out-of-market affiliates from [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]], [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]] and [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]].

==Canada==
===Radio===
In radio, [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) policy generally allows broadcasters to operate no more than three radio stations in any given market, of which no more than two may be on the same radio band — that is, a company may own two AM stations and an FM station, or two FM stations and an AM station, but may not own three AMs or three FMs. However, in major metropolitan markets where a large number of radio stations are already broadcasting, the limit is increased to four stations with a maximum of two on each band. A company may also exceed these limits if it owns stations broadcasting in both English and French; for instance, in the [[Montreal]] media market, [[Bell Media Radio]] owns six radio stations, of which two operate in French and four in English.

===Television===
Officially, CRTC policy mandates that a broadcaster may only own one television station in a particular language in any given market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Decision CRTC 2000-221 (para. 11)|url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2000/DB2000-221.HTM|work=[[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]]|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are two types of exemptions which may be granted:
# small markets, in which one or more stations may be in financial jeopardy due to limited advertising revenue;
# large markets, in which one or more stations may be in financial jeopardy due to audience fragmentation or the cost of programming rights.

The policy does not prevent companies from owning multiple stations in a market provided that the stations broadcast in different languages. In recent years, this has been interpreted as meaning that a single company may own both an English-language station and one or more multicultural stations with some English-language content, which in itself may be considered a form of "exemption". [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]/[[Ici Radio-Canada Télé|Radio-Canada]] [[owned-and-operated station]]s (O&amp;Os) are also often deployed in pairs in major cities on both television and radio, separated only by language. In addition, the policy is not interpreted as preventing a single company from owning both a "commercial" general-interest station and an educational station in the same market, even if the latter airs advertising, as with [[CTV Two Alberta|Access]] in Alberta.&lt;ref name="ctvchum"&gt;{{cite web|title=Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2007-165 (para. 29)|url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/archive/eng/Decisions/2007/db2007-165.htm|work=Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the small and large market exemptions have a financial criterion in common, there are notable differences between the two. A small market twinstick may involve major network affiliates licensed to the same community, and is not obligated to provide distinct local news programming on the two stations, while in a large market the stations must be licensed to serve different communities or different programming niches, and ''cannot'' merge their news programming into a single operation. Small market twinsticks commonly share their branding across both stations, while twinsticks in large markets generally do not. As well, while small market twinsticks generally involve private [[network affiliate|affiliate]]s, major market twinsticks are virtually always owned-and-operated stations of their associated networks or [[television system|systems]].

In a few isolated cases, the CRTC has permitted "triple-sticks", or [[triopoly (disambiguation)|triopolies]], where a single broadcaster operates ''three'' stations in a market. These are only possible under unusual circumstances which are discussed as they arise below.

====History====
Twinsticks were first allowed in 1967, as a way to help expand [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] service to smaller markets. In the original twinstick model, the second station was a rebroadcaster of a CTV station in a larger market, to which the small market's existing [[CBC Television|CBC]] affiliate would be granted the advertising sales rights.

As the company's advertising revenue grew, the CTV transmitter would eventually become an originating station in its own right, and in theory would eventually be sold to another broadcaster. However, in many cases the subsequent sale never happened, as the community's economic growth failed to lend itself to competition between multiple television broadcasters. In other markets where the CRTC had licensed competing broadcasters, such as [[Northern Ontario]], twinstick mergers were subsequently allowed to permit the survival of both television stations after similar economic difficulties were encountered.

With the cross-national [[concentration of media ownership|consolidation]] of media ownership, nearly all of the original twinstick stations no longer share ownership with their former twin stations. However, the second type of twinstick, involving media consolidation in larger markets, began to arise in the 1990s.

====Small markets====
Up until February 2010, twinsticks of this type outside of [[Quebec]] involved CTV and CBC Television affiliates. Currently both small-market twinsticks in English Canada consist of [[Global Television Network|Global]] and CTV affiliates.
* [[Lloydminster]] – [[CITL-TV|CITL]] and [[CKSA-TV|CKSA]] ([[Newcap Broadcasting]])
* [[Thunder Bay]] – [[CHFD-TV|CHFD]] and [[CKPR-TV|CKPR]] ([[Dougall Media]])

Within Quebec, twinsticks may consist of any combination of Ici Radio-Canada Télé, [[TVA (TV network)|TVA]] and [[V (TV network)|V]] affiliates:
* [[Gatineau]] – [[CHOT-DT|CHOT]] and [[CFGS-DT|CFGS]] ([[RNC Media]])
* [[Rouyn-Noranda]] – [[CKRN-DT|CKRN]] and [[CFEM-DT|CFEM]] (RNC Media)

From 1997 to 2002, CTV directly owned several CBC twinstick stations that it had inherited from [[Baton Broadcasting]] ([[CKNC-TV|CKNC]], [[CHNB-TV|CHNB]], [[CJIC-TV|CJIC]] and [[CFCL-TV|CFCL]] in Northern Ontario, which were part of the [[CTV Northern Ontario|MCTV]] system, and [[CKBI-TV|CKBI]] and [[CKOS-TV|CKOS]] in [[Saskatchewan]]); these were sold to the CBC in 2002.

One "triple-stick" also exists, in which a single company, [[Télé Inter-Rives]], operates all three licensed stations in [[Rivière-du-Loup]]: [[CKRT-TV|CKRT]], [[CIMT-TV|CIMT]] and [[CFTF-TV|CFTF]]. An unofficial triple-stick also exists in the Rouyn-Noranda area, as RNC Media, the licensed owner of that city's twinstick, also operates [[CFVS-DT|CFVS]], the sole station licensed to the nearby city of [[Val-d'Or]]; in actual practice, all three stations serve both cities. These unusual situations arise because of the unique circumstances of francophone television stations in Quebec: with virtually no sources for [[broadcast syndication|syndicated programming]], the stations are effectively constrained to network programming at all times, and both TVA and Radio-Canada maintain direct editorial control of local newscasts on all of their affiliates{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}&lt;!-- this may have been true of certain SRC affils in the past - e.g. those owned by TQS (for conflict-of-interest reasons) - but I don't think it was ever a requirement for all SRC or TVA affils --&gt; – meaning that despite being owned by a single company, the stations are still able to meet the guiding principles behind the CRTC's policies on media ownership.

As noted above, historically, twinstick operations were locally owned. With the cross-national consolidation of media ownership in Canada, however, most twinstick operations are now owned by major media conglomerates. The [[Thunder Bay Television]] stations (CHFD/CKPR) are the sole remaining locally owned twinstick anywhere in English Canada. The aforementioned Télé Inter-Rives is similarly unique in Quebec, although it is itself ''partially'' owned by [[Quebecor]].

Until August 2008, [[Cogeco]] owned three twinsticks in Quebec: [[CKTV-TV|CKTV]] and [[CFRS-TV|CFRS]] in [[Saguenay, Quebec|Saguenay]], [[CKSH-TV|CKSH]] and [[CFKS-TV|CFKS]] in [[Sherbrooke]] and [[CKTM-TV|CKTM]] and [[CFKM-TV|CFKM]] in [[Trois-Rivières]]. These twinsticks were dissolved when Radio-Canada decided to acquire its former affiliates (CKTV, CKSH and CKTM), while the V affiliates (CFRS, CFKS and CFKM) were acquired by [[Remstar Corporation]], the new owner of V (then known as TQS).

====Major markets====
In the mid-1990s, the CRTC also began to allow private companies operating in large markets to acquire smaller stations. In all such cases, the twinsticks are permitted because a diversity of broadcast voices already exists in the market,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Decision CRTC 2000-221 (para. 12)|url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2000/DB2000-221.HTM|work=Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the stations are normally licensed to serve different communities in the metropolitan market or different programming niches. The stations must also be operated independently of each other, although they are permitted to cross-promote each other's programming. They may also air a very limited amount of common programming, although in practice this privilege is rarely used.

Currently, [[Bell Media]] operates twinsticks in three major markets, using the CTV and [[CTV Two]] brands:
* [[Ottawa]] – [[CJOH-DT|CJOH]] and [[CHRO-DT|CHRO]]
* [[Toronto]]-[[Barrie]] – [[CFTO-DT|CFTO]] and [[CKVR-DT|CKVR]]
* [[Vancouver]]-[[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]] – [[CIVT-DT|CIVT]] and [[CIVI-DT|CIVI]]

In addition to these "true" twinsticks, in some areas, Bell Media has taken a twinstick-type approach with two stations deemed to be in ''adjacent'' media markets, but which in practice serve both markets. For example, Bell operates both CTV station [[CKCO-DT]] in [[Kitchener, Ontario]] and CTV Two station [[CFPL-DT]] in [[London, Ontario|London]], about {{convert|100|km|mi}} away. Both have been carried on the [[Very high frequency|VHF]] band of basic cable throughout much of [[southwestern Ontario]] for several decades. Hence, presumably as a result of this duplicated coverage, their current owner has elected to continue airing distinct programming on both stations (on the other hand, Kitchener is also about 100&amp;nbsp;km from Toronto; nevertheless both CKCO and Toronto's CFTO operate as CTV stations).

Finally, in some markets, Bell Media operates both a local over-the-air CTV station, and a provincial or regional cable channel that broadcasts CTV Two programming. In Alberta, CTV stations [[CFCN-DT|CFCN]] in [[Calgary]] and [[CFRN-DT|CFRN]] in [[Edmonton]] co-exist with [[CTV Two Alberta]], which is officially licensed as the provincial educational broadcaster and is therefore technically exempt from the CRTC's common ownership policy&lt;ref name="ctvchum"/&gt; (prior to September 2011, CTV Two Alberta also operated over-the-air transmitters in Calgary and Edmonton). In the [[Maritime Provinces]], Bell Media operates both the over-the-air [[CTV Atlantic]] group of stations and the cable-only [[CTV Two Atlantic]], which have been jointly owned (under various parent companies) since the latter's launch in 1983.

====Previous examples====
[[Canwest]]&lt;!-- Shaw is not applicable here; Canwest divested all of the "secondary" stations before Shaw ever got control of it. --&gt; operated the [[CIII-DT|CIII]]/[[CHCH-DT|CHCH]] twinstick in Toronto-[[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] and the [[CHAN-DT|CHAN]]/[[CHEK-DT|CHEK]] twinstick in Vancouver-Victoria until 2009, under the [[Global Television Network|Global]] and [[E! (Canadian TV system)|E!]] brands. These two sets of twinsticks were separated as a result of E!'s demise in August 2009, with Canwest retaining the Global O&amp;Os (CIII and CHAN) and selling off the E! stations (CHCH and CHEK). Additionally, Canwest previously owned the now-defunct [[CHCA-TV|CHCA]] in [[Red Deer, Alberta|Red Deer]], which was available on cable and via rebroadcast transmitters in both Calgary and Edmonton, where Canwest respectively already owned [[CICT-DT|CICT]] and [[CITV-DT|CITV]]. This was not considered a true twinstick as CHCA was not based in the larger markets, and did not have permission to solicit local advertising in those markets. It did, however, have [[simultaneous substitution]] rights.

[[CHUM Television]] operated the [[CITY-DT|CITY]]/CKVR twinstick in Toronto-Barrie and the [[CKVU-DT|CKVU]]/CIVI twinstick in Vancouver-Victoria under the [[Citytv]] and [[CTV Two|A-Channel]] brands prior to its acquisition by [[CTVglobemedia]] in 2006. Following this acquisition, [[Rogers Media]] briefly held twinsticks in Vancouver (CKVU and [[CHNU-DT|CHNU]]) and Winnipeg ([[CHMI-DT|CHMI]] and [[CIIT-DT|CIIT]]), formed from its newly acquired Citytv stations and its [[Omni Television|Omni]]-branded religious stations; these two sets of twinsticks were dissolved in 2008 following the sales of CHNU and CIIT to [[S-VOX]].

Unlike the situation in smaller markets, this type of "[[concentration of media ownership|consolidation]]" twinstick had been increasingly common up to the late 2000s, concurrently with the rise of secondary television systems (such as CH/E! and A-Channel) launched by their parent companies to complement their primary networks or systems (such as Global and Citytv). This trend was partially reversed in 2009 with the demise of E! and the subsequent dissolution of the Global/E! twinsticks.

====Multiple languages====
In many major markets, the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] operates both [[CBC Television]] (English) and [[Ici Radio-Canada Télé]] (French) stations, as listed below. Prior to the CBC decommissioning all of its television rebroadcasters in 2012, both networks were available over-the-air in numerous other markets not listed below, but one or both of the transmitters was a rebroadcaster of a station originating in a different city; these were not usually considered true twinsticks. Nevertheless, both networks continue to be available as part of the basic programming tier on all cable and satellite providers nationwide.
* [[Edmonton]] – [[CBXT-DT|CBXT]] and [[CBXFT-DT|CBXFT]]
* [[Montreal]] – [[CBMT-DT|CBMT]] and [[CBFT-DT|CBFT]]
* Ottawa – [[CBOT-DT|CBOT]] and [[CBOFT-DT|CBOFT]]
* [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]] – [[CBKT-DT|CBKT]] and [[CBKFT]]
* Toronto – [[CBLT-DT|CBLT]] and [[CBLFT-DT|CBLFT]]
* Vancouver – [[CBUT-DT|CBUT]] and [[CBUFT-DT|CBUFT]]
* [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] – [[CBET-DT|CBET]] and [[CBEFT]]
* [[Winnipeg]] – [[CBWT-DT|CBWT]] and [[CBWFT-DT|CBWFT]]

In Toronto, Edmonton and [[Calgary]], Rogers Media's acquisition of the Citytv system put those stations in twinsticks with the multilingual [[Omni Television]] stations. In Toronto, Omni Television has its own twinstick, giving the company a nominal "triple-stick" in that market. The two Omni stations in Toronto each serve different segments of the market's multicultural audience, and thus are ''also'' permitted under the language exemption.
* [[Calgary]] – [[CKAL-DT|CKAL]] and [[CJCO-DT|CJCO]]
* Edmonton – [[CKEM-DT|CKEM]] and [[CJEO-DT|CJEO]]
* Toronto – [[CFMT-DT|CFMT]], [[CJMT-DT|CJMT]] and [[CITY-DT|CITY]]
* Vancouver – [[CKVU-DT|CKVU]] and [[CHNM-DT|CHNM]]

In Montreal, Canwest owned both Global station [[CKMI-DT|CKMI]] and multicultural station [[CJNT-DT|CJNT]] until August 2009, when the latter was sold to [[Channel Zero Inc.|Channel Zero]].

CTV was formerly a part-owner of the francophone [[V (TV network)|V]] network (formerly TQS) in Quebec, meaning that V's owned-and-operated [[CFJP-DT|CFJP]] in Montreal was a partial twinstick with CTV's [[CFCF-DT|CFCF]] for most of the 2000s. CFCF was, in fact, the original ''owner'' of TQS, meaning that the stations were once a true twinstick under the language exemption, although the two stations went through very different sequences of ownership changes after 1995.

==Triopolies and quadropolies==
[[NBCUniversal]] formerly owned three full-power stations in [[Los Angeles]], NBC owned-and-operated station [[KNBC]], [[Telemundo]] O&amp;O [[KVEA]] and [[Spanish language]] independent station [[KWHY-TV]], before selling KWHY to the [[Alex Meruelo|Meruelo Group]] in January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FCC decision on transfer of existing Telemundo O&amp;O stations to NBC-Telemundo's TN Acquisition Corp|url=http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/MB/Orders/2002/fcc02113r.txt|work=Federal Communications Commission|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NBC Universal to Sell LA Station KWHY-TV to Meruelo|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/nbc-universal-sell-la-station-76275|author=George Szalai|newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=January 26, 2012|accessdate=October 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FCC allows common ownership of three full-power television stations if there are 18 stations that are licensed within the market; as such, Los Angeles and [[San Francisco]] are the only two U.S. markets which can legally have a true full-power triopoly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=FCC adopts media ownership rules|url=http://money.cnn.com/2003/06/02/news/companies/fcc_rules/|work=[[CNNMoney]]|date=June 2, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Federal Communications Commission otherwise only permits common ownership of three full-power television stations within one market if the tertiary station is licensed under a [[broadcast relay station#satellite station|satellite station]] waiver (the FCC constitutes a full-power station that is licensed as a satellite as the same entity as its parent station, and therefore does not count them toward market ownership caps). A unique instance exists in [[Austin, Texas]], involving the ''de facto'' triopoly of NBC affiliate [[KXAN-TV]], CW affiliate [[KNVA]] and MyNetworkTV affiliate [[KBVO (TV)|KBVO]], the latter of which signed on in 1991 as a [[Llano, Texas|Llano]]-based satellite of KXAN to serve western portions of the market where reception of that station's UHF signal was impaired by the [[Texas Hill Country|hilly terrain]] within the area. Even though KBVO was converted into a separately programmed station in October 2009 (and therefore no longer acts as a KXAN repeater, even by way of a subchannel), the FCC granted Media General permission to acquire its license under an existing satellite waiver during that company's merger with [[LIN Media]] in 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Consent to Transfer Control of Licenses by Shareholders of Media General, Inc. and Shareholders of LIN Media, LLC to Post-Merger Shareholders of Media General, Inc.|url=https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-14-1810A1.docx|work=Federal Communications Commission|date=December 12, 2014|accessdate=February 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (without the waiver, Media General/LIN would have been forced to sell either KBVO or KNVA, which would not have been viable in any event, since there are not enough unique full-power station owners in the Austin market to permit a second legal duopoly with an owner of one of the market's three English language [[KTBC (TV)|major]] [[KVUE|network]] [[KEYE-TV|affiliates]] and neither would have likely had long-term financial survivability as a standalone station).

In addition, the FCC permits common ownership of three television stations if there are low-powered stations that are involved.

In 2013, through its acquisition of stations from [[Newport Television]], Nexstar and Mission Broadcasting formed a full-power virtual quadropoly made up of two legal duopolies in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], consisting of NBC affiliate [[KARK-TV]] and MyNetworkTV affiliate [[KARZ-TV]] (which Nexstar already owned), and Fox affiliate [[KLRT-TV]] and CW affiliate [[KASN]] (another existing duopoly that was acquired by Mission). Through the resulting local marketing agreement with Nexstar, the operations of KLRT and KASN were consolidated into KARK/KARZ's facilities; 30 employees were laid off as part of the consolidation.&lt;ref name=ab-klrtkarkmerge&gt;{{cite news|title=Almost 30 Lose Jobs at KARK, KLRT as TV Owners Consolidate|url=http://www.arkansasbusiness.com/article/90480/at-least-25-lose-jobs-at-kark-klrt-as-tv-owners-consolidate|accessdate=January 29, 2013|newspaper=[[Arkansas Business Publishing Group|Arkansas Business]]|date=January 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar virtual quadropoly in the [[Mobile, Alabama]]-[[Pensacola, Florida]] market was formed through another acquisition from Newport, this time by Sinclair, consisting of Pensacola-based ABC affiliate [[WEAR-TV]] and MyNetworkTV affiliate [[WFGX]] (which were both already owned by Sinclair and licensed to the beach community of [[Fort Walton Beach, Florida|Fort Walton Beach]]), and Mobile-based NBC affiliate [[WPMI]] and Pensacola-licensed independent station [[WJTC]] (owned by Deerfield, and operated by Sinclair under a local marketing agreement). Unlike the quadropoly in Little Rock, Sinclair has not consolidated all four stations into one facility and each duopoly maintains their own studios in different parts of the market (WEAR/WFGX on the Florida side, WPMI/WJTC on the Alabama side). Similarly structured virtual triopolies (many of which are run by Nexstar and Sinclair) also exist in a few markets, in which either an existing owner-operator of a legal duopoly also manages a tertiary station owned by a separate if indirectly related licensee, or owns-operates one station and runs two others that are owned by different licensees.

In Canada, at least one community ([[Rivière-du-Loup]], [[Quebec]]) has all three of its local [[French language]] stations – [[CKRT-DT]], [[CIMT-DT]] and [[CFTF-DT]] – under common ownership, however such levels of common ownership are for the most part strongly discouraged by the CRTC unless the stations serve remote communities or separately carry programming in different languages (such as Rogers Media's aforementioned triopoly in Toronto, consisting of the English-language CITY-DT and multicultural stations CFMT-DT and CJMT-DT). 

In Mexico, media concentration is endemic and it is not uncommon for as many as four stations to be operated by one entity. [[Televisa]] owns four [[Mexico City]] stations ([[XEW-TV|XEW]], [[XHTV-TV|XHTV]], [[XHGC-TV|XHGC]] and [[XEQ-TV|XEQ]]) while [[Azteca (multimedia conglomerate)|Azteca]], Mexico's second-largest broadcaster, owns three ([[XHIMT-TV|XHIMT]], [[XHDF-TV|XHDF]] and [[XHTVM-TV|XHTVM]]). These stations, in turn, feed large numbers of full-power affiliates. The largest Mexican network is the Televisa-owned [[Canal de las Estrellas]], which feeds its programming to more than 100 stations nationwide.

The '''Elbert H. Parsons Law Library''' (also known as the '''May and Cooney Dry Goods Company Building''') is a historic commercial building in [[Huntsville, Alabama]].  It was built in 1913 by the May and Cooney Dry Goods company to replace their building which was destroyed by a fire in 1911.  The store occupied the building until 1931, when they went bankrupt due to the [[Great Depression]].  [[J. C. Penney]] moved into the building in 1934 and remained until 1966, when it moved to "The Mall" on University Drive.  In 1973, it was purchased by the county and renovated to house a public [[law library]].

The building is a three-story structure with the façade faced in white glazed [[terra cotta]].  The street level has a large arch, decorated with a line of [[bay leaf]] clusters surrounded by alternating green and red blocks.  The inside of the arch was converted from a storefront to large glass panes with a single central entrance in the 1973 renovation.  The second and third floors each have five one-over-one [[sash window]]s, with the third floor windows slightly smaller than the second.  The building is topped with a projecting course of bay leaf [[garland]]s, a set of five colored panels in line with the windows, and a [[corbel]]ed [[cornice]] with several rows of geometric designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bayer |first=Linda |title=May and Cooney Dry Goods Company |url={{NRHP url|id=80000720}} |work=Historic Resources of Downtown Huntsville |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=August 2, 2014 |date=May 31, 1979 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6RXTYOyWb?url=http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/nrhp/text/80000720.pdf |archivedate=August 2, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }} ''See also:'' {{cite web|title=Accompanying photos |url={{NRHP url|id=80000720|photos=y}} |accessdate=August 2, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6RXTZ65Ux?url=http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/nrhp/photos/80000720.pdf |archivedate=August 2, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ernst Maurits Henricus Hirsch Ballin''' (born 15 December 1950) is a retired [[Netherlands|Dutch]] politician of the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] (CDA). 

Hirsch Ballin served as [[Ministry of Security and Justice (Netherlands)|Minister of Justice]] and [[Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations|Minister for Suriname and Netherlands Antilles Affairs]] from 7 November 1989 until 27 May 1994 in the [[Third Lubbers cabinet|Cabinet Lubbers III]]. And as acting [[Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations|Minister of the Interior]] from 10 January 1994 until 18 January 1994 following the death of [[Ien Dales]]. He became a [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|Member of the House of Representatives]] from 17 May 1994 until 1 June 1995 and served as a [[Senate (Netherlands)|Member of the Senate]] from 13 June 1995 until 1 November 2000 when he resigned to become a [[Council of State (Netherlands)|Member of the Council of State]] serving from 1 November 2000 until 22 September 2006 when he resigned to become [[Ministry of Security and Justice (Netherlands)|Minister of Justice]] in the [[Third Balkenende cabinet|Cabinet Balkenende III]] following the resignation of [[Piet Hein Donner]]. After the [[Dutch general election, 2006|Dutch general election of 2006]] and the inauguration of the [[Fourth Balkenende cabinet|Cabinet Balkenende IV]] he remained [[Ministry of Security and Justice (Netherlands)|Minister of Justice]] serving from 22 September 2006 until 14 October 2010. He became again acting [[Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations|Minister of the Interior and Kingdom Relations]] from 23 February 2010 until 14 October 2010 following the resignation of [[Guusje Ter Horst]].

After the [[Dutch general election, 2010|Dutch general election of 2010]], he made an appeal to his party not to work with [[Party for Freedom]] (PVV) to begin a [[2010 Dutch cabinet formation|cabinet formation]] for a new cabinet. After the success of the formation he was not offered a new position in the new [[First Rutte cabinet|Cabinet Rutte]], and returned as a [[Professor]] at the [[University of Amsterdam]] and the [[Tilburg University]] as a legal scholar.

Hirsch Ballin is also an active member of the Justice Leadership Initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://justiceleaders.org/leaders/ernst-hirsch-ballin/|title=Ernst Hirsch Ballin - Justice Leadership|publisher=justiceleaders.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Early life===
Hirsch Ballin was born to a [[Jewish]] father Prof. Dr. Ernst Danny Hirsch Ballin, and a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] mother. After completing his secondary education, he studied law at the [[University of Amsterdam]] and became a practicing [[Catholic Church|Catholic]].

He graduated in 1974, and he received a [[Master of Laws]] degree. He received a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree in 1979 for his dissertation on public law and policy, which focussed on fundamental issues surrounding the work of the Advisory Council on Government Policy (WRR).

Hirsch Ballin was a research assistant in constitutional law at the [[University of Amsterdam]] from 1974 to 1977. He was subsequently employed as a legal officer at the [[Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations|Ministry of Justice]]. In 1981 he was appointed [[professor]] of constitutional and administrative law at [[Tilburg University]].

===Politics===
[[Image:Ernst Hirsch Ballin.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Hirsch Ballin in 2009.]]

From 7 November 1989 to 27 May 1994 Hirsch Ballin served as [[Ministry of Justice (Netherlands)|Minister of Justice]] and [[Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations|Minister for Suriname and Netherlands Antilles Affairs]] in the [[Netherlands cabinet Lubbers-3|Cabinet Lubbers III]]. In 1994 he offered his resignation, after turmoil about the Dutch Criminal Investigation Department.

After the [[Netherlands cabinet Kok-1|Cabinet Kok I]] with a coalition of the [[Dutch Labour Party]], [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] and [[Democrats 66]] came to power the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] was pushed to the opposition and Hirsch Ballin became a [[House of Representatives of the Netherlands|Member of the House of Representatives]] a post he held until 1995.

During this period he was also [[professor]] of legislative issues at the [[Tilburg University]]. In 1995 he was appointed [[professor]] of [[international law]] at the same university and later became [[Senate of the Netherlands|Member of the Senate]]. He was elected as a member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.knaw.nl/en/members/members/6715 |title=Ernst Hirsch Ballin |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |date= |accessdate=17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 Hirsch Ballin was appointed to the [[Dutch Council of State]] and he resigned as a [[Senate of the Netherlands|Member of the Senate]].

Hirsch Ballin has held numerous other positions, among them government commissioner for the review of legislation, member of the Board of the [[Netherlands Atlantic Association]], member of Committee 2004 (for the relationship between the [[Netherlands]], the [[Netherlands Antilles]] and [[Aruba]]) and deputy justice on the Central Appeals Tribunal and the ''Administrative Court for Trade and Industry''. He has been editor of the Dutch administrative law journal "Nederlands Tijdschrift voor Bestuursrecht" and the book series European and [[International Law]].

On 23 May 2008 satirical cartoonist [[Gregorius Nekschot]] was arrested which caused (inter)national controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.rtl.nl/(/actueel/rtlnieuws/binnenland/)/components/actueel/rtlnieuws/2008/05_mei/15/binnenland/0515_2315_gregorius_nekschot_cartoonist_opgepakt.xml/ Cartoonist Gregorius Nekschot opgepakt], [[RTL Nederland|RTL Nieuws]]&lt;/ref&gt; Hirsch Ballin wanted to pass a bill on blasphemy, but failed. He was accused of causing the cartoonist to be brought to court for blasphemy to get a verdict to bypass the parliament.

===Family===
Ernst Hirsch Ballin is married; he and his wife have two children.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4003">'''Financial assistance''' in [[law]] refers to assistance given by a [[company (law)|company]] for the purchase of its own [[stock|shares]] or the shares of its [[Holding company|holding companies]].  In many jurisdictions such assistance is prohibited or restricted by law. For example all [[European Union|EU]] member states are required to restrict financial assistance by public companies up to the limit of the company's distributable reserves,&lt;ref&gt;Recital 5 of the EU [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2006:264:0032:0036:EN:PDF Directive 2006/68/EC of 6 September 2006 amending the Second Directive on Company Law] and Article 23 of the [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:1977L0091:20070101:EN:PDF Second Directive on Company Law]&lt;/ref&gt; although some members go further, for example, [[Belgium]], [[Bulgaria]], [[France]], and [[The Netherlands]]&lt;ref&gt;Article 207c, Second Book of the Civil Code of the Netherlands&lt;/ref&gt; restrict financial assistance by all companies. Where such assistance is given in breach of applicable law it will render the relevant transaction [[void (law)|void]] and may constitute a [[Crime|criminal offence]].&lt;ref&gt;See for example section 151(3) of the Companies Act 1985 of the United Kingdom&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Outline==
The assistance can be of a variety of different types. The most common type of assistance is a financial [[surety|guarantee]] for a loan and/or third party [[security interest|security]] to allow a borrower to borrow money to buy shares which is routinely given (to the extent legally possible) after a [[leveraged buyout]] in support of the new owner's acquisition debt. It would also normally include a gift or loan from the company or any other act which reduces the net assets of the company to a material extent &lt;ref&gt;See Companies Act 1985 s152(1)(a)&lt;/ref&gt; where this is done for the purpose of the acquisition of shares in itself or its parent.

The rationale for such laws is purely economic; it is based upon the premise that if a company supports the purchase of its own shares, it causes a ''de facto'' diminution in the company's value in the hands of other shareholders (who are assumed to continue their ownership following the transaction).  Conflicting concerns have also been expressed, namely that such financial assistance artificially inflates a share's price above its market level.

Although the authorities are unclear, it seems that financial assistance may also have been a crime under the English [[common law]] prior to its codification by statute.&lt;ref&gt;See ''R v Lorang'' (1931) 22 Cr App R 167; 75 Sol Jo 121&lt;/ref&gt; If that is correct, then laws against financial assistance may be much more prevalent than is normally assumed, and would also apply in many of the English speaking [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth countries]].

Laws against financial assistance are sometimes controversial because of the difficulties they can cause in the context of a [[leveraged buyout]], and some jurisdictions which have enacted them have later repealed them.&lt;ref&gt;For example the United Kingdom [[Companies Act 2006]] reverted UK law to the minimum level of regulation required under [[EU directive]] 77/91/EEC by abolishising the prohibition for private (but not public) companies, see s677 et seq&lt;/ref&gt;  Some jurisdictions provide for so-called "whitewash" procedures,&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [[Companies Act 1985]] ss155-158 for the procedure in the United Kingdom&lt;/ref&gt; whereby the shareholders can authorise transactions that would otherwise be void for financial assistance.  Most jurisdictions which prohibit financial assistance permit the company to purchase its own shares and hold them in [[treasury stock|treasury]], and the company can then issue them again on terms that would have been prohibited if they had sought to provide financial assistance in an equivalent manner for a third party purchase.

{{Conflict of laws}}
'''Forum shopping''' is a [[Colloquialism|colloquial]] term for the practice of [[litigant]]s having their [[legal case]] heard in the [[court]] thought most likely to provide a favorable judgment. Some [[jurisdiction (area)|jurisdiction]]s have, for example, become known as "plaintiff-friendly" and so have attracted litigation even when there is little or no connection between the legal issues and the jurisdiction in which they are to be litigated. In reality, every litigant who files a lawsuit engages in forum shopping when he chooses a [[legal jurisdiction]] to file suit. 

Examples include the attraction of foreign litigants to the [[United States]] due to its expansive acceptance of [[personal jurisdiction]] and favorable litigation climate, and the [[United Kingdom]] for its [[Libel tourism|stricter defamation laws]] and generous [[divorce]] settlements.

The term has become adopted in a wider context for the activity of repeatedly seeking a [[venue (law)|venue]] or willing listener for a concern, complaint or action, until one is found.

== Related notions ==
When a case is filed before a court, the court decides whether it has personal and [[subject matter jurisdiction]], and if so, whether it is the most appropriate forum or venue. Under the doctrine of ''[[forum non conveniens]]'', Latin for "inappropriate forum", a judge has a discretion to transfer a case if the court selected is not the most convenient one. If the courts in two states would accept civil jurisdiction, the plaintiff must be able to show that justice requires the trial to take place in the forum suggested by the plaintiff.

The plaintiff might have selected one forum on the following grounds:
*The forum is not convenient to the defendant or his witnesses. There may be problems of expense of travel, health, or visa or entry permit.
*The court, the judge, or the law is most likely to favour the plaintiff's case.

The defendant may take the following actions to seek a [[change of venue]]:
*The defendant may petition the forum court that it should reject the jurisdiction and petition to transfer the case to an allegedly more convenient forum; or
*If a case has been filed in another jurisdiction, the defendant may seek [[injunction|injunctive]] relief against the plaintiff in a second state, requiring that the plaintiff discontinue the action in the first forum and instead submit the case for hearing in this allegedly more convenient forum.

In both instances, the first step is to determine whether the first instance forum is the natural forum, or whether the forum has the closest connection with the action and the parties. The court adjudicates whether there is another forum that is more appropriate under the [[comity|doctrine of comity]]. The current forum court must respect the right of a foreign court to assume jurisdiction. A court must balance the interests of the parties, since there is injustice not only when a plaintiff is allowed to pursue the action in a forum inconvenient to the defendant, but also when a plaintiff is not allowed a timely trial.

Generally, the court will not grant a petition to transfer or an injunction if the grant unjustly will deprive the plaintiff of advantages in the first instance forum. Nevertheless, a real and substantial connection between the venue and the cause(s) of action should exist to provide defendants some protection against being pursued in jurisdictions that have little or no connection with the transaction or the parties.

If the alternative court concludes that another court has assumed jurisdiction either without considering whether an alternative forum was available or has reached an obviously unreasonable conclusion on the merits, then an [[injunction]] would sometimes be a reasonable response. If, on the other hand, the alternative court has reasonably concluded that no more convenient forum was available, then comity requires it to respect the decision of the court that has already assumed jurisdiction and dismiss the application for an injunction and transfer. In cases where there is a sound argument to be made in favour of both courts, the court in the second venue should not arbitrarily claim a better right to decide for both jurisdictions. In most cases the adherence of the foreign court to principles resembling those applied in the second venue court will be obvious; if the foreign court has adhered, then the second venue court should refuse relief.

The term has become adopted in a wider context for the activity of repeatedly seeking a venue or willing listener for a concern, complaint or action, until one is found.

== Child custody ==
{{See also|International child abduction|Parental child abduction|International Parental Kidnapping Crime Act|Conflict_of_laws#International_child_abduction|Child custody|Anton Salonen incident}}

In child custody cases, where a parent is able to file a child custody case in more than one state, a claim of forum shopping made against the parent who filed the custody case moved to a state due to its more favorable laws is not likely to succeed. In one case{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}, a court expressly acknowledged that the plaintiff had chosen to move to the state in order to benefit from the liberal divorce laws in that state. The court found that was perfectly appropriate and did not justify a stay or dismissal of the case.

Forum shopping may be seen as inappropriate when it is intended to secure a more sympathetic forum in a child custody case. Some courts have noted that the [[Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction|Hague Abduction Convention]] was designed to deter parents from engaging in international forum shopping in custody cases.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} Specifically, the Hague Convention attempts to prevent situations in which a parent dissatisfied with current custodial arrangements flees with the child to another country to re-litigate the merits of custody and to obtain a more favorable custody order. Nonetheless, at times, it may be in the best interests of a child to remove the child from a forum which does not apply the best interests test in child custody cases to a forum which has a "better" law and practice in such cases.

In a child custody dispute a pregnant women can legally engage in forum shopping before she gives birth, by giving birth in different a state/country that the child was conceived in. The mother has to move before (not after) her child is born in order to avoid a legal mess in the state/country where the child was conceived in.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816173000/http://www.nycdivorcelawyer.net/nyc_divorce_articles.php?entry_id=204 |title=Anna Nicole Smith and The Legal Rights of Unborn Children&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Anna Nicole Smith]] gave birth in the Bahamas in order to legally circumvent United States law governing paternity and Custody, laws which rightfully give preference to the biological father under the US Supreme Court decision of Stanley v. Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816173000/http://www.nycdivorcelawyer.net/nyc_divorce_articles.php?entry_id=204 |title=Anna Nicole Smith and The Legal Rights of Unborn Children&lt;/ref&gt;

For example a British women that gets pregnant in the United States can give birth to her child in the UK. She than makes her child that is born in the UK, live in the UK until child custody ends at age 18. She will also prohibit her child from visiting the United States before child custody ends, in order to avoid a child custody dispute in the US legal system. This is because the courts in the United Kingdom are most likely to provide the British mother a more favorable child custody judgment.

== United States ==
The [[United States]] has attracted foreign [[litigant]]s wishing to take advantage of the more generous awards of [[damages]] and [[alimony]], extensive [[discovery (law)|discovery]] rules, and the [[contingent fee]] system. In addition, the [[Foreign Trade Antitrust Improvements Act]], the [[Alien Tort Claims Act]], and many state [[product liability]] laws create legal rights that often do not exist in other jurisdictions.

=== By the plaintiff ===
A plaintiff frequently can choose to file his case in one of several jurisdictions by picking a [[Federal Government of the United States|federal]] rather than a [[U.S. state|local jurisdiction]], a local rather than federal jurisdiction, or one of several geographic localities. The defendant in a civil case can be sued in a jurisdiction where he lives or where the cause of action occurred. In the United States, the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas|district court for the eastern district of Texas]] in [[Marshall, Texas]], has become a popular forum for [[patent]] lawsuits, since it found in favor of the plaintiff 78% of the time; the national average is 59%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/24/business/24ward.html |title=So Small a Town, So Many Patent Suits |work=New York Times |date=September 24, 2006 |author=Julie Creswell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== By the civil defendant ===
A defendant can resort to various procedures or theories to have a case removed from the court wherein the plaintiff originally filed it. The defendant may invoke the [[removal jurisdiction]] of a federal court to take a claim out of the state court, request for a [[change of venue]] because the case was brought in the improper court within the jurisdiction, and move for ''forum non conveniens'' on the ground that the case was brought in an inappropriate forum based on the locations of the parties or evidence.

=== In criminal cases ===
Forum shopping also happens, albeit less frequently, in U.S.&amp;nbsp;federal [[criminal law|criminal]] trials, especially as certain [[United States district court|districts]] and [[United States court of appeals|circuits]] are widely thought to favor the government in particular issues or trials. It is often claimed that the U.S.&amp;nbsp;federal trials of alleged [[terrorism|terrorists]] were forum shopped.

Criminal defendants have much less power to change the forum in which the case against them has been brought. Generally, they can do so only where they can show that localized notoriety or publicity makes it unlikely that an impartial jury can be selected in the district in which charges were brought.

=== Efforts to discourage forum shopping ===
Courts may object to forum shopping for several reasons. The fair resolution of a case hinging on technical differences from one jurisdiction to the next would offend the sense of justice, and more practically, judges may fear that having the reputation of a forum favorable to certain types of plaintiffs will delay the timely dispensation of justice in other cases by increasing their workload.

Under the [[Erie doctrine|''Erie'' doctrine]], a federal court hearing a case under the [[diversity jurisdiction]] must apply the law of the state in which the court is sitting. Under the choice of law, the law of the state which has the closest nexus to the case is applied.

Parties to a [[contract (conflict)|contract]] may seek to prevent forum shopping by inserting a [[forum selection clause]] or a [[choice of law clause]] in their contract. Such clauses are now generally enforced by the courts.
Reduction by means of a unique judgement between both the plaintiff and the defendant.

== Philippines ==
Forum shopping is considered a serious offense which can be made by a complainant. The law in the [[Philippines]] explicitly prohibits the filing of more than one case for the same cause of action in any forum or court of law so that the courts will not be clogged by complaints of people who may file more than one complaint in an effort to gain a favorable decision in any of the numerous cases filed.

== England and Wales ==
{{main|Libel tourism}}
In England and Welsh law, laws on [[libel]] can be considered to be more favourable to the plaintiff than in other jurisdictions, leading to a form of forum shopping sometimes called "defamation shopping" or "libel tourism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Libel tourism laws: spoiling the holiday and saving the First Amendment?|last=Staveley-O’Carroll|first=Sarah|pages=255&amp;ndash;264|journal=New York University Journal of Law &amp; Liberty|date=2009|volume=4|issue=252|accessdate=31 May 2015|url=http://www.law.nyu.edu/sites/default/files/ECM_PRO_062709.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/afe77e0c-7204-11e3-bff7-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3bjieu8GJ|work=[[Financial Times]]|place=London|title=UK Defamation Act aims to end trivial claims and libel tourism|date=31 December 2013|first=John|last=Aglionby|accessdate=31 May 2015|quote='It does not go as far as many reformers had hoped, but it brings increased protection in certain areas, for example for internet service providers and academic journals, and limits so-called forum shopping,' Mr Terry said. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Libel Tourism:International Forum Shopping for Defamation Claims|publisher=Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs|last=Bell|first=Avi|isbn=978-965-218-070-4|accessdate=31 May 2015|page=4|quote=For several reasons, defamation shopping has become one of the most popular forms of forum shopping.|url=http://jcpa.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/libeltourism.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|page=7|url=http://www.commonlawreview.cz/on-selecting-jurisdiction-in-internet-defamation-cases|journal=Common Law Review|first=Deborah|last=Azar|title=On selecting jurisdiction in Internet defamation cases|place=Prague, Czech Republic|quote=I will conclude that England is preferable to most US jurisdictions when considering jurisdiction for plaintiffs in cases of internet defamation.|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Atlantic Star'' [1973] QB 364 at 381–382, [[Lord Denning MR]] famously stated:

{{quote|You may call this "forum shopping" if you please, but if the forum is England, it is a good place to shop in, both for the quality of the goods and the speed of service.}}

'''Forward Commitment Procurement''' (FCP) is a [[procurement]] model that is designed to be used to deliver cost effective environmental products and services to the [[public sector]] and help to create the market conditions in which the environmental goods and services sector can thrive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Whyles |first1=Gaynor |last2=van Meerveld |first2=Hendrik |last3=Nauta |first3=Joram |year=2015 |title=    Forward Commitment Procurement: a practical methodology that helps to manage risk in procuring innovative goods and services. |journal=Innovation: The European Journal of Social Sciences |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=293-311 |doi=10.1080/13511610.2015.1024638}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Apostol |first=Ramona |year=2017 |title=Trials and Tribulations in the Implementation of Pre-Commercial Procurement in Europe |publisher=Springer |page=154 |isbn=9789462651562}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Uyarra |first=Elvira |chapter=The impact of public procurement of innovation |editor-last=Edler |editor-first=Jakob, ''et al.'' |year=2016 |title=Handbook of Innovation Policy Impact |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing |page=374 |isbn=9781784711856}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Model==
The model was conceived and developed by the [[UK Government]]'s Environmental Innovation Advisory Group (EIAG) 2003-2008)&lt;ref&gt;EIAG was established by [[David Sainsbury, Baron Sainsbury of Turville|Lord Sainsbury]] in 2003 and jointly managed by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR) (previously Department of Trade and Industry) and the Department of Environmental Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) and supported by a joint BERR/DEFRA secretariat).&lt;/ref&gt; to address a key market failure identified by EIAG, namely the lack of market pull for environmental innovations.&lt;ref&gt;Environmental Innovation: Bridging the gap between environmental necessity and economic opportunity. First report of the Environmental innovations Advisory Group, November 2006. Published by DTI in association with DEFRA. DTI/Pub 8442/2.5K/11/06 NP&lt;/ref&gt;

The first report of EIAG &lt;ref&gt;Environmental Innovation: Bridging the gap between environmental necessity and economic opportunity. First report of the Environmental innovations Advisory Group, November 2006. Published by DTI in association with DEFRA. DTI/Pub 8442/2.5K/11/06 NP&lt;/ref&gt; identified the Government as a key player in the environmental market, with a special responsibility as custodian of the common good to provide intelligent and effective supply chain management that could help to unlock investment in new environmental products and services.

As such, the public sector provides a lead market for environmental products and services, and this, coupled with the fact that the Government is a major purchaser of environmental goods and services, led EIAG to focus its activities on "how Government and its agencies can improve on the way they manage the supply chain in this sector" Jack Frost, Chairman of EIAG (2003–2008).&lt;ref&gt;Chairman’s report: Environmental Innovation: Bridging the gap between environmental necessity and economic opportunity. First report of the Environmental innovations Advisory Group, November 2006. Published by DTI in association with DEFRA. DTI/Pub 8442/2.5K/11/06 NP&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In essence then, our analysis turns the problem of innovation on its head. It is the lack of credible articulated demand that is at the root of the relative failure of innovation in the UK environmental goods and services sector not any lack of research, invention or innovative aspirations. EIAG believes the solution lies in Government taking action to mobilise the supply chain to deliver environmental innovations. And this means moving from a focus on R&amp;D and technology push to a focus on intelligent supply chain management.&lt;ref&gt;Page 12. Environmental Innovation: Bridging the gap between environmental necessity and economic opportunity. First report of the Environmental innovations Advisory Group, November 2006. Published by DTI in association with DEFRA. DTI/Pub 8442/2.5K/11/06 NP&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

EIAG developed FCP as a supply chain management tool primarily for use by public sector policy makers and procurers, although the approach it is equally relevant to, and has been picked up by, private sector bodies such as the New Swindon Company in a project concerning innovative combined cooling, heat and power (CCHP) plant and services. FCP in fact mirrors the approach taken by businesses to stimulate suppliers to invest in new products and services to meet their future needs.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Private sector companies actively manage their supply chains by clearly articulating their future needs and providing a credible promise of future sales to provide security their suppliers need in order to make investments.&lt;ref&gt;Page 20.

Published by DTI in association with DEFRA. DTI/Pub 8442/2.5K/11/06 NP&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"The public sector, as both custodian of the common good and a major purchaser of environmental goods and services, is a natural lead market for environmental products and services. JERA have pioneered FCP as a practical mechanism to enable public sector organisations to fulfill this role, while at the same time delivering the cost effective solutions they need to pressing problems such as climate change and economic and social sustainability". Gaynor Whyles, Director JERA Consulting&lt;ref&gt;jera consulting website&lt;/ref&gt;

The FCP approach has been well received:

• FCP was recommended by the UK Sustainable Procurement Task Force &lt;ref&gt;Procuring the Future, UK Sustainable Procurement Task Force&lt;/ref&gt; and adopted by the UK Government in their Sustainable Procurement Action Plan [http://www.sustainable-development.gov.uk/publications/pdf/SustainableProcurementActionPlan.pdf].
• The Commission on Environmental Markets and Economic Performance called for the UK Government to scale up and replicate the FCP model in the public sector.&lt;ref&gt;Commission on Environmental Markets and Economic Performance: Report November 2007. Published by DEFRA&lt;/ref&gt;
• The EIAG FCP demonstration project (see below) was highlighted by HM Treasury in the publication ‘Transforming Government Procurement’ as an example of how innovation can be harnessed to improve services and value for money &lt;ref&gt;Transforming Government Procurement, HM Treasury, January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/media/E/6/government_procurement_pu147.pdf.].
• And highlighted as a best practice case study in 'Finding and Procuring Innovative Solutions, OGC/DIUS Report, 2007', [http://www.ogc.gov.uk/documents/Finding_and_Procuring_Innovative_Solutions_(3).pdf]

== Definition ==
The Forward Commitment Procurement model involves providing the market with advance information of future needs in outcome terms, early engagement with potential suppliers and - most importantly - the incentive of a Forward Commitment: an agreement to purchase a product or service that currently does not exist, at a specified future date, providing it can be delivered to agreed performance levels and costs.&lt;ref&gt;paraphrased from Box 2.11, page 43 Commission on Environmental Markets and Economic Performance: Report November 2007. Published by DEFRA.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Forward Commitment Procurement (FCP) Model
The FCP concept is simple and addresses a common “[[Catch-22 (logic)|catch 22]]”. Sustainability objectives often require new products that are either not available in the market or are available at excessive cost. These products do not receive the investment required to enter and be competitive in the market because the need for them is not expressed to suppliers in a credible way.

By making the market aware of genuine needs and requirements and offering to buy products which meet these needs once they are available at a price commensurate with their benefits we can unlock this stalemate and unlock investment.

Essentially, FCP is a tool to allocate and manage risk more effectively. It achieves this by providing business with crucial market information on performance and price coupled with assurances on future sales to reduce market risks.

This enables business to invest against technical/development risk which it is best placed to handle. The results in the customer getting what it needs, when it wants it at an affordable price. If suppliers cannot deliver to the required specification, the customer is no worse off (other than opportunity costs) and continues to purchase the existing technology.

== The EIAG Forward Commitment Procurement Project ==
The Forward Commitment Procurement project (managed on behalf BERR and DEFRA by Gaynor Whyles of JERA Consulting Ltd (previously JPS Consulting) from June 2005) set out to design and test a supply chain management tool for the public sector, in line with public procurement regulations, that would create the necessary market pull for environmental products and services and hence create the conditions that would support investment in the environmental industries sector.

The project involved:
• designing a supply chain management approach and procurement process that was in line with public procurement regulations
• testing this through a demonstration project
• designing a mechanism to enable the scale up and replication of the approach

The EIAG FCP demonstration project was undertaken in partnership with Her Majesties Prison Services (HMPS) and the Office of Government Commerce (OGC). The role of OGC was to provide professional public procurement expertise and advice to the EIAG Project Manager to ensure that the FCP model was compliant with public procurement regulations and reflected best practice. The FCP model built upon and made practical guidance published by OGC in its information leaflet entitled Capturing Innovation (OGC, 2004)[http://www.ogc.gov.uk/documents/capturing_innovation.pdf.]

== FCP Demonstration Project: Zero Waste Prison Mattress ==
HMPS were buying in the order of 60,000 highly flame retardant, polyurethane foam mattresses and pillows per year and disposing of around 40,000, mainly to landfill, but with a significant number also being disposed of as clinical waste. The combined cost of supply and disposal was estimated to be well in excess of £3 million per year. In short, the way in which mattresses were disposed of was costly and environmentally unsustainable and out of step with HMPS sustainable development policy. There had been several attempts to find a solution none of which had delivered a meaningful result. HMPS had an 'unmet need' for a cost effective and environmentally sustainable solution.

Further consideration of the problem led HMPS to identify the following requirement:
“HMPS aspires to a zero waste prison mattress that meets or exceeds current operational requirements and delivers whole life cycle cost efficiencies. By 2012, HMPS wants all its mattresses and pillows not classified as hazardous waste to be recycled, repurposed or reused instead of going to landfill; and to reduce to 2 per cent pa the number of mattresses disposed of as hazardous or clinical waste”.&lt;ref&gt;Call for innovative solutions and information. PROSPECTUS for the market sounding exercise regarding: A Zero Waste Mattress System for HM Prison Services (HMPS. Innovation in the delivery of environmental sustainability throughout the life cycle of prison mattresses&lt;/ref&gt;

This requirement was then communicated to the market in a market sounding exercise in the form of a 'call for innovation and information', designed and managed by the EIAG FCP team. (Market sounding is a way of “assessing the reaction of the market to a proposed requirement and procurement approach, in order to bring supplier perspectives to public sector procurements at an early stage”.&lt;ref&gt;Early Market Engagement: principles and examples of best practice, Office of Government Commerce Guide 2006&lt;/ref&gt; This exercise involved the publication of a Prior Information Notice in the Official Journal of the European Union and the engagement of intermediaries, such as the BERR funded Knowledge Transfer Networks, trade bodies and similar, to communicate notification of the call to the potential supply chain.

Detailed information on the requirement, the context for the call and the scale of the market opportunity were provided in a market sounding prospectus, and HMPS offered to consider a ‘forward [[commitment contract]]’ to enable the take up of innovative solutions.&lt;ref&gt;Call for innovative solutions and information. PROSPECTUS for the market sounding exercise regarding: A Zero Waste Mattress System for HM Prison Services (HMPS). Innovation in the delivery of environmental sustainability throughout the life cycle of prison mattresses&lt;/ref&gt;

Over 36 high quality responses were received, and from which a range of options were identified. A directory of companies and organisations that responded to the call was published on the HMPS procurement website to assist supply chain development and a 'Concept Viability' [http://www.ogc.gov.uk/documents/sd006.pdf] workshop involving a cross section of the supply chain that submitted responses was held to discuss the options available and inform the HMPS mattress procurement strategy.

The market engagement process led HMPS to adopt a completely different approach to the procurement of its mattresses and pillows. HMPS is at the concluding stages of a procurement exercise for a 'cradle to cradle' managed service to supply zero waste mattress and pillows. The final stage of evaluation is underway and HMPS is confident that all of the shortlisted bids will be able to deliver the requirement (see above), and in addition estimates that it will save between £3-£5 million over the life of the contract.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
“[[Sustainable procurement]] has been talked about for years but the Prison Service launching a competition for zero waste mattresses was one of the few truly innovative examples CEMEP came across” Julie Hill, Member of the Commission on Environmental Markets and Economic Performance, from issue 18 of Inside Track magazine, Autumn 2007.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== The Forward Commitment Procurement Process &lt;ref&gt;Unpublished. Personal communications GM Whyles, JERA Consulting Ltd&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}==
Although all FCP projects are unique, they usually involve:
• identification of an unmet need
• placing this need in the context of a procurement i.e. a market opportunity
• offering a forward commitment contract where required
• articulating the requirement in outcome terms to potential suppliers, providing sufficient time for the market to respond
• assisting the development of a supply chain
• providing the supply chain with information on, and where possible a route to, the wider market
• using outcome based procurement specifications
• ensuring procurement processes are accessible to and do nor preclude small and medium-sized companies
• use of the competitive dialogue process
• use of a forward commitment procurement contract where required

Forward Commitment Procurement works best where there is:
• a high level of leadership and staff commitment
• a genuine need that current technology, products or commercial models cannot deliver
• and / or cannot be delivered affordably
• a procurement opportunity sufficient scale to stimulate the delivery of a solution
• the ability to make a forward commitment of sufficient strength to generate the required market pull
• potential for aggregation of demand within the organisation, region, and with other public sector bodies

== Current Forward Commitment Procurement Projects ==
At the time of writing (May 8) a number of FCP projects are getting underway. This include projects involving NHS Trusts, NHS Purchasing Supply Agency (NHS PASA), South West Regional Development Agency (SWRDA), Swindon Borough Council, New Swindon Company, and are addressing a range of environmental unmet needs such as ultra efficient lighting systems, innovative CCHP, water efficiency, and sustainable waste management solutions.

The '''Frame of Government of Pennsylvania''' was a constitution for the [[Province of Pennsylvania]], a [[proprietary colony]] granted to [[William Penn]] by [[Charles II of England]]. The Frame of Government has lasting historical importance as an important step in the [[history of democracy|development of American and world democracy]].

==Background==

William Penn, as an English [[Quaker]], sought to construct a new type of Community with [[religious toleration]] and a great deal of [[Freedom (political)|political freedom]]. It is believed that Penn’s political philosophy is embodied in the [[West Jersey]] Concessions and Agreements of 1677, which is an earlier practical experience of government constitution prior to the establishment of Pennsylvania. Although his authorship of the Concession is questioned, it is believed that he gave his full consent to it as the trustee of that colony. In the Concession, all legislative power was granted to an assembly selected by the "inhabitants, freeholders and proprietors" of the colony. A commission was to be appointed by the assembly as its executive. The government structure in West Jersey demonstrated the enlightened constitutional theory that Penn had been promoting.

Also under the influence of republican political theory and [[humanism]], the first version of the Frame of Government of Pennsylvania (now known as the Frame of 1682) incorporated a few pioneering ideas, which were later developed into important elements of modern constitutionalism. It required capital punishment to be applied to a strictly limited scope of criminal offenses only, including murder and treason. Freedom of worship in the colony was to be absolute. The assembly could bring a request of impeachment of the governor before the council for its trial.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Unconstitutional laws should be invalidated, although it did not specifically grant courts the power to declare the unconstitutionality. It included an amendment process where six-sevenths of the legislature and the governor had to approve any change. However, the government structure speculated by the Frame of 1682 was far less liberal than that in West Jersey Concessions and Agreements of 1677.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==The Frame of 1682==

[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/17th_century/pa04.asp The Frame of 1682] constituted a parliament consisting of two houses. The upper house, or the council, consisted of 72 members who were the first fifty purchasers of 5,000 acres or more in the colony and had the exclusive power to propose legislation. They were also authorized to nominate all officers in church and state and supervise financial and military affairs through committees. The lower house, or the assembly, consisted of smaller landowners. It had no power to initiate legislation but could accept or reject the council’s legislative proposal only. The two-house parliament assists the governor with his executive functions.

Commentators believe that the Frame of 1682 was significantly influenced by Penn’s supporters, primarily the earliest landholders in the colony. Little direct evidence suggested that they imposed a pressure upon the government constitution process. However, it is believed that the earliest settlers, who heavily invested in Pennsylvania, demanded a voice in constructing the framework of government.

[[William Markham (Governor)|William Markham]], a trusted deputy executive of Penn in the colony for many years, commented:

''"I knew very well [the Frame of Government] was forced upon him by friends who unless they received all that they demanded would not settle the country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=William Markham to Governor Benjamin Fletcher, Calendar of State Papers, Colonial Series, America, and West Indies|year=1696–97}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''

This partly explained Penn’s deviation from his political ideas on government constitution to accommodate the demands of the settlers.

One of the most controversial provisions in the Frame of 1682 was if the governor should be allowed a veto to legislation presented by the parliament. To attract colonists, Penn had at first reserved himself only a single vote in the council and no power to reject legislation passed by the assembly. However, the Frame of 1682, in its final form, granted the proprietor a greater power – he was allowed a treble vote in the council and a veto in the legislative process.

In December 1682, an assembly of 42 men was convened to ratify the Frame of 1682. Although leading Quakers secured their places in the assembly, their proposal to establish a proprietary government was adamantly opposed by the non-Quakers in the assembly, including representatives from the [[Lower Counties]], which had been under the light control of the deputy governors appointed by the [[Duke of York]] (later [[James II of England|James II &amp; VII]].) In particular, they rejected the monopoly of the council in initiating legislation and requested a more powerful assembly. As a result, the Frame of 1682 was voted down.

==The Frame of 1683==

An assembly convened in 1683 to model a new frame of government in place of the rejected Frame of 1682. The tension which resulted in the rejection of the Frame of 1682 remained – although leading Quakers dominated the council, half of the seats in the assembly were occupied by non-Quakers from the Lower Counties who were steadfastly against the concentration of power to Quaker elites.

The proprietor’s voting power in the legislative process remained one of the major concerns in framing the government. As provided in the colonial charter granted by the King, laws were to be made by the proprietor. Thus, it would be a violation of the charter if the proprietor did not possess a veto power in legislation. Over lengthy debate, Penn managed to convince the assembly that the proprietor’s veto power was necessary, but guaranteed that he would exercise the power only with the council’s advice and consent.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archon.klnpa.org/psa/?p=collections/classifications&amp;id=71 PA State Archives – RG-21 – Series Titles – Proprietary Government&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Once again, the assembly sought to enlarge its role and insisted that it be granted to power to initiate legislation, as it demanded when it rejected the Frame of 1682. Although it was regarded as unacceptable to both the proprietor and the council, they conceded that the assembly is allowed to confer with the council before passing a law. A compromised frame of government, or the [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/17th_century/pa05.asp Frame of 1683], was eventually approved by the assembly. It provided that all laws should be passed "by the Governor and the freemen in Council and Assembly met", and granted the governor a right to approve or veto.

However, the proprietary governance speculated by the Frame of 1683 did not function effectively after Penn returned to England in 1684. He relied on the council to act as governor collectively in the first few years during his absence. However, the council neglected Penn’s constitutional authority and promulgated laws without obtaining approval from Penn or the King. Penn subsequently appointed five commissioners to replace the council as his deputy executive. Having granted any three of the commissioners a power to enact, annul or vary laws "as if I myself were there", he instructed the commissioners to annul the laws passed without his approval. However, the commissioners never carried out such instructions. In 1687, Penn appointed John Blackwell to replace the five commissioners as a single executive. As an aggressive Puritan governor, Blackwell clashed with the Quakers’ assembly immediately after he was appointed. The disorder in Pennsylvania and William III’s increasing distrust in Penn led to the suspension of Penn’s charter as the colonial proprietor in 1692.

==The Frame of 1696 (Markham’s Frame)==

Penn’s charter was restored in 1694. Presumably, he intended his colonists to return to the Frame of 1683, as one of the conditions on which his charter was restored was that the colony should be under proprietary governance. William Markham, the lieutenant governor commissioned by Penn in 1694, ruled the colony imperialistically and acted aggressively towards the assembly. However, certain practical needs in the colony significantly changed the political structure and dramatically resulted in liberal governance in this period, which was reflected in the [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/17th_century/pa06.asp Frame of 1696] (also known as Markham’s Frame).

The assembly continued to make effort to further its power in the 1690s. In March 1695, David Lloyd, the chief spokesman of the Quakers, warned that there was no special virtue in returning to the Frame of 1683, and proposed a charter granting the Assembly a controlling role, including the sole power to initiate legislation. The council turned to support the shift of power from itself to the assembly in anticipation of a possible reestablishment of a royal government. The Quakers dominating the council understood that with Penn’s charter under heavy attack by neighboring governors and English government officials, the reestablishment of royal government was "highly possible – even probable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nash|first=Gary|title=Quakers and politics : Pennsylvania, 1681-1726|year=1968|publisher=Princeton University Press|pages=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;    In that situation, the Quakers found it necessary to invest the assembly with "the widest possible powers in advance of such a change".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nash|first=Gary|title=Quakers and politics : Pennsylvania, 1681-1726|year=1968|publisher=Princeton University Press|pages=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The council might be appointed by a royal governor and thus susceptible to a royal control. However, the assembly would always be elected. Outnumbering other factions, including the Anglicans, the Quakers believed that they would be able to dominate in the assembly. Thus, even if the Quakers lost their control over the council, they could still operate from the assembly to defend against a royal control.

In response to the Quakers’ request, William Markham, the lieutenant governor and a member of the [[Church of England]], took it as an opportunity to urge the Quaker-dominated assembly to cooperate in appropriating fund for military preparations, and promised that a discussion of constitutional revision would become possible if the military appropriation bill was passed by the assembly. Although having been committed to nonviolence and consciously objecting to participating in wars, Quakers compromised in this regard in exchange for a more powerful assembly. Coupled with a bill raising a fund of £300 for military use, the assembly passed a new frame of government, which is known as the Frame of 1696, or Markham’s Frame. The new frame significantly changed the allocation of political power within the legislature by conferring upon the assembly the power to initiate legislation, sit on its own adjournment and judge the qualifications of its members. It also reduced the size of the legislature to a more manageable level – each county elected only two representatives to the council and four to the assembly. In addition, it provided for more stringent voting requirements to exclude non-Quakers from voting. A person needed to reside in the colony for two years before he could vote, suggesting an attempt to diminish the strength of the ever-growing number of non-Quaker immigrants newly arrived in the colony. In rural areas, where Quakers had a dominant representation in the population, the voting requirement was relaxed to include all freeholders with 50 acres rather than 100 acres as before. In urban areas where the number of non-Quakers was growing, the voting requirement was tightened to exclude anyone without a £50 estate free of debts.

The validity of the Frame of 1696 was questionable, as Markham did not have a conceivable right to approve it. It was never approved by Penn either – actually, Penn criticized it harshly. However, it functioned as the colonial constitution in practice for several years until Penn returned to Pennsylvania in 1699.

==The Frame of 1701 (The Charter of Privileges)==

After his 15 years’ absence, Penn returned to Pennsylvania in 1699 and found the assembly resisting his proprietary authority.  His attempts to reinforce proprietary governance turned out to be unpopular. Hostility towards proprietary politics and desire for the legislature’s autonomy prevailed among the Quaker elite. In 1701, on the eve that Penn left Pennsylvania to defend his colonial charter before the King in London, the assembly presented him with a new draft of the frame of government, which is subsequently known as the [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/pa07.asp Frame of 1701], or the Charter of Privileges.

The Frame of 1701 further strengthened the controlling role of the assembly. An elective council was not even mentioned in the legislative process, and thus the assembly became the sole legislative authority.  Meanwhile, the assembly obtained several Anglo-Saxon standard parliamentary privileges constitutionally for the first time: the right to prepare legislative bills, elect its own officers, appoint committees, sit on its own adjournment, judge the qualifications of its own members, and impeach officers of government. The assembly was to be elected annually by freemen and composed of four representatives from each county. The governor may appoint a council to assist with executive affairs, the council does not have a role in the legislative process.

In addition, the Frame of 1701 required all claims relating to properties to be directed to ordinary courts of justice, and thus neutralized the power of the Board of Propriety, the center of proprietary land administration.

Another significant concession in the Frame of 1701 was that the Lower Counties, or Territories, are permitted to establish their home rules. In 1705, the Territories took advantage of this provision and set up their own assembly.

Although Penn steadfastly refused to approve the Frame of 1696, he yielded to the Frame of 1701, which was different from the Frame of 1699 only in details. Some writers regarded his concession as a sign of his losing control over the colony. He admitted that he approved the Frame of 1701 only because he saw a majority had been convinced by [[David Lloyd (judge)|David Lloyd]] that it was a form of government "nearer to English methods, which they called for so often." Also, in anticipation of the possibility that his rights of government in the colony might be stripped of by the English Parliament, a more democratic governmental structure might provide the Quakers in the colony with a shelter from an arbitrary royal governor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nash|first=Gary|title=Quakers and politics : Pennsylvania, 1681-1726|year=1968|publisher=Princeton University Press|pages=232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Frame of 1701 remained the governing constitutional document in Pennsylvania in the following seventy-five years until the Revolution of 1776.

==Characteristics==

The establishment of Pennsylvania may be the most successful effort of Quakers in colonizing in America. Penn’s close relationship with the Crown significantly contributed to the success. His ruling over Pennsylvania was largely based on the royal charter, which curbed his political experiment and led to a hierarchical governmental structure. The compromise diluted the liberalism in the constitution of government, which Penn and his contemporary political thinkers had been promoting. However, the human rights provisions in the Frame of Government successfully reflected certain important values inherent in human thinking prevailing in the colony and Quakerism and contributed to the development of constitutionalism in America.

==Legacy and reception==
The Frame of Government has been seen as a significant move towards democracy in America.  The political philosophy expounded in the preface to the Frame of 1682 has often been cited and quoted.
[[Voltaire]] applauded Penn's efforts, saying he might "with reason, boast of having brought down upon earth the Golden Age, which in all probability, never had any real existence but in his dominions." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=William Penn, America's First Great Champion for Liberty and Peace|url=http://www.quaker.org/wmpenn.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

Greve has a degree of Physics in [[biophysics]], with [[physical oceanography]] and [[astronomy]] as minor fields of study from the computer science department of the [[University of Hamburg]]. His interdisciplinary diploma thesis was written in the field of [[nanotechnology]] on [[scanning probe microscopy]].

Greve's first software development was when he was 12 years old. His first publication of a program was in a professional journal in 1992. He partly financed his studies when he managed the software development to evaluate [[SQUID]]-sensor data in the biomagnetometic laboratory at the [[University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf]] in [[Hamburg]], Germany.

In 1993 he came across [[free software]], the [[GNU Project]] and [[Linux]]. In 1998, he was the European speaker for the [[GNU Project]] and began writing the "Brave GNU World",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/brave-gnu-world/intro.en.html |title=Georg's Brave GNU World - GNU Project - Free Software Foundation (FSF) |publisher=Gnu.org |date=8 February 2000 |accessdate=2009-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; a monthly column on free [[computer]] [[software]] featuring interesting [[GNU]] projects each month. It was published on the Internet in as many as ten languages, and in international printed magazines including the German [[Linux-Magazin]]. The name ''Brave GNU World'' is a reference to [[Aldous Huxley]]'s [[novel]] ''[[Brave New World]]''.

In early 2001, he initiated the [[Free Software Foundation Europe]] (FSFE or FSF Europe), the first [[Free Software Foundation]] outside the United States of America and, {{As of|2007|lc=on}}, the only transnational Free Software Foundation. Greve was invited as an expert to the “Commission on Intellectual Property Rights” of the [[Her Majesty's Government|UK government]], and represented the coordination circle of German [[Civil society|Civil Society]] during the first phase of the [[United Nations]] (UN) [[World Summit on the Information Society]] (WSIS) as part of the [[Politics of Germany|German governmental]] delegation. He has also networked with the Civil Society [[working group]]s on European level as well as for the thematic working group on [[patent]]s, [[copyright]]s, [[trademark]]s (PCT) and free software.

Between 2010 and 2017 he served as [[CEO]] as well as [[President (corporate title)|president]] and later member of the [[Board of directors|board]] for Kolab Systems AG in [[Küsnacht]], [[Switzerland]], the developers behind the [[Kolab]] server.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fsfe.org/about/greve/Greve-CV.pdf |title=FSFE - About - Georg C.

'''George Abbitt''' (also '''George Abbott''') (1634–1689)  was a founding settler of [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]], [[Connecticut]].

He was the son of Maurice and Gertrude Abbott of England.

He originally settled in [[Windsor, Connecticut|Windsor]], as an [[indentured servant]]. He apparently was sanctioned for selling ammunition to the natives, which was a serious offence at the time. He later settled in [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], and then prior to 1655, he settled in Norwalk.&lt;ref name="norw"/&gt;

He is listed on the Founders Stone bearing the names of the [[History of Norwalk, Connecticut|founders of Norwalk]] in the [[East Norwalk Historical Cemetery]].

'''''Ghen v. Rich''''',  [[Case citation|8 F. 159 (1881)]], is an [[United States|American]] [[property law]] case from the [[United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts]] involving ownership of a dead [[whale]].   The case is frequently used to illustrate the difficulties of establishing "[[Possession (law)|possession]]" and [[ownership]] under the [[common law]].   
==Parties==
*Ghen was a whaler who operated out of Massachusetts. He killed the whale in question.
*Ellis was the person who found the killed whale on the beach and auctioned it.
*Rich was the buyer of the whale from Ellis; Rich processed the whale into oil and other by-products.

==Facts and holding==
This 1881 case decided ownership of a dead [[finback]] [[whale]] (''[[Balaenoptera physalus]]''). The whale was killed by the libellant (plaintiff) Ghen’s [[harpoon|bomb lance]].    The whale washed up on the [[shore]] 17 miles from [[Cape Cod]] and was found by Ellis, who then [[auction|auctioned]] off the whale to Rich, the defendant.    Finback whales generally sink after being killed, and it takes time for the whale to resurface.   According to the [[Custom (law)|custom]] of the time, dead whales were retrieved from the [[shore]] after 2-3 days, and the finder identified the [[whaling]] company that had made the kill from the unique mark of the bomb lance.    The finder would then notify the whaling company by communicating with [[Provincetown]] and in return receive a finder's fee.   In this case, it was unclear whether the whaler or the person who discovered the washed up whale owned the [[animal]].   

The [[U.S. District Court of Massachusetts]] decided that it was unreasonable to expect the whaler to wait for the whale to return to the surface and therefore the whaler who killed the whale retained his claim to the property according to the custom under the prior common law and case law. The trial judge found, "If the fisherman does all that is possible to do to make the animal his own, that would seem to be sufficient [to give that fisherman full ownership]."  Request for [[trover]] of the whale granted to Ghen.&lt;ref&gt;'''''Ghen v. Rich''''', 8 Fed. 159 (1881)&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the '''informed consumer''' is a fundamental one in the [[law of the European Union]].  Since the general Resolution of 1975, one of the primary objectives of the [[European Community]], and then the [[European Union]], has been the provision of information to [[consumer]]s.  The rationale is that market actors who are informed have a greater capacity to understand the importance of their market actions and choices, and are enabled in making better choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Capital Markets in the Age of the Euro|editor1=Guido Ferrarini |editor2=Klaus J. Hopt |editor3=E. Wymeersch |pages=133|author=Guido Alpa|chapter=Trading On-line and Consumer Protection|publisher=Kluwer Law International|year=2002|isbn=9789041117373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
According to the European Union, "Information is a deciding factor for consumers when making their [[consumer choice|choices]] and affects both consumer interests and their confidence in the products and services circulating within the market."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Consumer Information|url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/consumers/consumer_information/index_en.htm|website=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/consumers/consumer_information/index_en.htm|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consumer expectation ==

The consumers expect to get fair treatment in the [[market place]] and avoid unscrupulous or sharp business dealings.
They envisage a fair market environment that facilitates and supports several consumer rights:

* The consumer must get a fair chance of choosing from the range of goods and services available in the market place.
* The consumer must be provided with complete, unambiguous and explicit knowledge about the products. The information must contain details regarding the contents of the product, [[safety warning]]s and product care instructions.
* The information should be written in plain and understandable language, which is self-explanatory. Also, the text should be readable in terms of the size and type of font.
* The consumers expect just and equitable [[pricing]] of the commodities. Fair price is equal to a reasonable [[profit margin]] added to the real cost of manufacturing of product or service (with no exorbitant mark-up cost). Information about the related costs of the product must be brought to the knowledge of the consumer.
* The consumers also have the right to indiscriminate prices, that is paying the same price as other customers, without any discrimination.
* Consumers also expect to get a communication channel for enquiry and complaints about the product or service. They want effective redressal and remedies to loss, such as implementation of legal regulations and prosecution to law violations .

With the advent of [[electronic media]] in marketing, and the mass information storage capacity of computers, [[consumer privacy]] has become a great concern. Hence, consumers want to ensure privacy of information. The consumers want to be able to cast off the invasive marketing methods, and threat of entry into the private system of consumers.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hurme|first1=Sally Balch|title=Consumer Protection|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Consumer_Product_Safety_Act.aspx|website=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Consumer_Product_Safety_Act.aspx|accessdate=27 October 2014|ref=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Consumer_Product_Safety_Act.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance==
Consumer information is the most important element for [[consumer protection]] and policy decisions. It is the solution to issues ranging from online transactional threats, [[behavioural targeting]], loss of privacy and other problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Helberger|first1=Natali|title=Form matters: informing consumers effectively|url=http://www.ivir.nl/publications/helberger/Form_matters.pdf|website=http://www.ivir.nl/publications/helberger/Form_matters.pdf|accessdate=27 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140708062650/http://www.ivir.nl/publications/helberger/Form_matters.pdf|archivedate=8 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A consumer must treat every purchase as an important Investment. Making an uninformed investment in the stock market can result in huge financial losses to consumer, the similar rule applies to daily purchases. Being an informed consumer is advantageous to the economy, market and consumers .
An informed consumer is capable of making sensible decisions, gains an insight about a product prior to its purchase. This insight equips the consumer with the data to arrive at an evidence based conclusion.

===Higher-quality investments===

* With almost every purchase, comes a variety of other options to choose from. This is where the information plays an important role. Information enables the customers to differentiate the quality products from non- quality ones and purchase durable goods that sustains for a longer period.

===Safe investments===

* Information about products facilitates safe purchases.  With the production taking place in bulk quantities, there maybe instances that the product bores certain manufacturing defects. Recognizing these defects can prevent the customer from financial injury or loss. The product and brand reviews and consumer forums online can be instrumental in educating the customers about them. This should essentially be considered while making big purchases like electronic products and vehicles.

=== Money-saving investments ===

* Consumer often suffers from the danger of being misled by the sales professionals, especially the ones paid commission. These sales personnel are paid commission proportionate to their sales. These sales person are capable of enticing the consumer to buy the most expensive options. Information about your potential purchases can help in saving money and ensure a smarter purchase.

=== Ethical investments ===

* A consumer must never deal with the company indulging in unethical practices. One must check for things like animal testing and experimentation, labour abuse, or donations to a superficial NGO before taking the decision of engaging with the company.

===Responsible investment===

It is the responsibility of the consumer to get all the information about the potential purchase and associated background before making a decision to buy it. "Getting armed with information about the consequences of your purchase doesn't just make an informed consumer, it makes a Responsible consumer."
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nelson|first1=Lauren|title=Why Is it Important to Be an Informed Consumer?|url=http://www.consumer.ftc.gov|website=http://www.consumer.ftc.gov|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses of information==

Transparent information about the terms and conditions associated with the product or service can facilitate a plenty of '''regulatory requirements''' to redress the consumer related grievances. Primarily, complete information will level the information asymmetries, improve '''consumer's decision- making''' capability vis-à-vis the seller's complex knowledge about the product they are selling.
Consumer information also harmonises and solve consumer problems, '''create awareness''' and '''guide their behaviour'''. Another important objective that is achieved by informing the consumer is impact on Competitive policy. This will enable the traders and service providers to give greater information to consumers about their product, educate them about the product quality and other specifications.
In addition to the compliance to the legal obligations, the business firms also have their '''planned, tactical and important business- related reasons''' behind informing the consumer. The business organisation ensure consumer's '''expectation management''' by equipping them with certain knowledge about the commodity.
Many times, business face '''disincentive by providing information''' to the consumers, as it might harm the marketability and attractiveness of their product. This indicate the power gained on being an Informed consumer.
The economic analysis indicates that information asymmetry to consumer is a major ground for market failure, causing the consumer to make irrational decisions. Thus, unbiased information can solve the market problems by equipping the customers with appropriate information and thereby ensuring healthy market practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Helberger|first1=Natali|title=Form matters: informing consumers effectively|url=http://www.ivir.nl/publications/helberger/Form_matters.pdf|website=http://www.ivir.nl/publications/helberger/Form_matters.pdf|accessdate=27 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140708062650/http://www.ivir.nl/publications/helberger/Form_matters.pdf|archivedate=8 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sources of information ==

Consumers derive their information from multiple sources. The following are the sources from where a consumer gathers the desired knowledge about the product:
* Governments issue public information for the consumers
* Regulatory authorities, review and testing services and comparison  sites
* Social networks (friends, family, children, acquaintance etc.)
* Suppliers of the products or services.
* the media
Consumer derives information from a variety sources, each source illustrating its own interest, skills and resources . However, it is essential  for the consumers to recognise their personal interests and make a judicious decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Helberger|first1=Natali|title=Form matters: informing consumers effectively|url=http://www.ivir.nl/publications/helberger/Form_matters.pdf|website=http://www.ivir.nl/publications/helberger/Form_matters.pdf|accessdate=27 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140708062650/http://www.ivir.nl/publications/helberger/Form_matters.pdf|archivedate=8 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Customer know-hows==
# ''Know who you are dealing with'':  Don't do business with any company that won't provide its name, street address, and telephone number. 
#''Protect your personal information'': Share credit card or other personal information only when you're buying from a company you know and trust. 
#''Take your time'': Resist any urge to "act now" despite the offer and the terms. Once you turn over your money, you may never get it back. 
#''Read the small print'': Get all promises in writing and review all the documents carefully before you pay any money or sign a contract. 
#''Never pay for a "free" gift'': Throw away any offer that asks you to pay for a gift. If it's free or a gift, you shouldn't have to pay for it. Free is free. 
#''Know the risks before you spend your money'': When it comes to investments, every potentially high-profit investment is high-risk. That means you could lose your investment – all of it.

== Market shift ==
The influx of electronic media and abundance of available information has triggered a complete transformation of the market orientation. There has been a transition in the "traditional [[customer engagement]]", whereby the model of teaching the customer about the product or service has changed to knowledge- ridden customers who know exactly where they want to spend their money. The digital invasion has initiated an exploration drive in the consumers, turning the consumers into 'Informed Consumers'. This trend can be substantiated by the research led by the firm Forrester that suggests "buyers are often between 70 and 90 percent of the way through the sales process before they ever engage a vendor". This evolution in the market- orientation is a challenge for the existing and the emerging businesses. Following are the steps to take advantage of changes in, market:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Newman|first1=Daniel|title=How to Sell to the Informed Consumer|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/daniel-newman/how-to-sell-to-the-inform_b_5309839.html|website=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/daniel-newman/how-to-sell-to-the-inform_b_5309839.html|accessdate=29 October 2014|ref=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/daniel-newman/how-to-sell-to-the-inform_b_5309839.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Know your customer
#Get discovered/Stay in public view
#Utilize grassroots tactics

== Challenge for marketers ==
Consumers are becoming web-savvy, mobile enabled data sifters, who attain complete knowledge about the product prior to even stepping in the store.

To deal with highly informed consumers, the marketer must do the following:
* Be prepared that the consumer has knowledge about the product and manoeuvre it into something useful.
* Be the source of comprehensive knowledge to the consumers.

With the increase in the variety of sources for consumer education, it is important for the marketer to enter the sales process at an early stage. The marketer must move ahead of the curve and make sure  to bring some value to the customer’s  purchase beyond just fulfilling his/her need.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Court|first1=David|title=The consumer decision journey|url=http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/marketing_sales/the_consumer_decision_journey|website=http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/marketing_sales/the_consumer_decision_journey|publisher=McKinsey &amp; company|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== EU legislation ==
EU consumer policy is designed to
* protect you against serious risks and threats that you cannot tackle on your own
* enable you to make choices based on clear, accurate and consistent information
* safeguard your consumer rights, enabling you to resolve disputes with traders quickly and efficiently
* ensure your rights keep pace with economic and social change – especially in the food, energy, financial, transport and digital markets.
In an efficient, integrated EU economy underpinned by EU-wide rules, you must be able to trust that your rights as a consumer will be upheld in the event of any problems when purchasing goods and services in other EU countries.
At an annual cost of just 5 cents per person, the EU's consumer protection programme for 2014–2020, is designed to enforce consumer laws throughout the single market, giving you a high level of legal protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/pol/cons/index_en.htm||title=EU Legislation on consumer protection |website=http://europa.eu/pol/cons/index_en.htm|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Statistics ==
* According to the "2013 Edelman Trust Barometer", an online survey of 26,000 general population respondents across 26 countries, 35% of those identified as "the informed public" need to hear company information three times to believe it, while another 29% need to hear it 4–5 times more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Deck: 2013 Edelman Trust Barometer|url=http://www.slideshare.net/EdelmanInsights/global-deck-2013-edelman-trust-barometer-16086761|website=http://www.slideshare.net|publisher=edelman trust barometer|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The study also looks at how consumers place their trust in corporations of different sizes. In the US, 86% of informed consumers trust small businesses, while just 55% trust big businesses. A similar gap is apparent in the UK (78% vs. 48%), but the opposite is true in China, where 89% trust big businesses compared to 65% for small businesses.
In fact, whereas informed publics in developed countries are more trusting of small than big businesses (76% vs. 53%), emerging market respondents placed more trust in big businesses (79% vs. 70%). Overall, small businesses are slightly more trusted than big businesses (70% vs. 62%).
Looking at company types, the study finds that trust in media companies rose from 52% of informed publics globally in 2012 to 57% this year. Within the US, trust in media companies crossed into the majority, increasing from 45% to 51%.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4261">[[Panama]] has passed several laws protecting [[intellectual property]] in the country.

==Copyright law==
{{main|Copyright law of Panama}}
The National Assembly in 1994 passed a comprehensive [[copyright]] bill (Law 15), based on a World Intellectual Property Organization model. The law modernizes copyright protection in Panama, provides for payment of [[royalties]], facilitates the prosecution of copyright violators, protects computer software, and makes copyright infringement a [[felony]]. Although the lead prosecutor for IPR cases in the Attorney General's Office has taken a vigorous enforcement stance, the Copyright Office remains small and ineffective. The Copyright Office has been slow to draft and move forward further improvements to the Copyright Law to implement the new WIPO treaties (the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonographs Treaty). Nevertheless, their proposal also would establish new offences, such as for internet-based copyright violations, raise the penalties for infractions, and enhance border measures. This proposed draft legislation is moving forward with technical assistance from SIECA (the Central American Economic Integration System).&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;

==Patent law==
A new Industrial Property Law (Law 35) went into force in 1996 and provides 20 years of [[patent]] protection from the date of filing. Pharmaceutical patents are granted for only 15 years, but can be renewed for an additional ten years, if the patent owner licenses a national company (minimum of 30 percent Panamanian ownership) to exploit the patent. The Industrial Property Law provides specific protection for trade secrets.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;

==Trademarks==
Law 35 also provides [[trademark]] protection, simplifying the process of registering trademarks and making them renewable for ten-year periods. The law's most important feature is the granting of ''ex officio'' authority to government agencies to conduct investigations and to seize materials suspected of being [[counterfeit]]ed. Decrees 123 of November 1996 and 79 of August 1997 specify the procedures to be followed by Customs and CFZ officials in conducting investigations and confiscating merchandise. In 1997, the Customs Directorate created a special office for IPR enforcement, followed by a similar office created by the CFZ in 1998. The Trademark Registration Office has undertaken significant modernization with a searchable computerized database of registered trademarks that is open to the public.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;

==Treaties==
Panama is a member of the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO), the [[Geneva Phonograms Convention]], the Brussels Satellite Convention, the [[Universal Copyright Convention]], the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works]], the [[Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property]], and the International Convention for the Protection of Plant Varieties. In addition, Panama was one of the first countries to ratify the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty.&lt;ref name=cp&gt;[https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/8210.pdf 2001 Country Reports on Economic Policy and Trade Practices]. [[Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs]], [[U.S. Department of State]] (February 2002). {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enforcement==
Protection of intellectual property rights (IPR) in Panama has increased significantly over the past several years. The government passed an Anti-Monopoly Law in 1996 mandating the creation of commercial courts to hear [[Competition law|anti-trust]], patent, trademark, and copyright cases exclusively. Two district courts and one superior tribunal began to operate in 1997 and have been adjudicating intellectual property disputes. IPR policy and practice in Panama is the responsibility of an Inter-institutional Committee. This committee consists of representatives of six government agencies and operates under the leadership of the Vice-Minister of Foreign Trade. It coordinates enforcement actions and develops strategies to improve compliance with the law.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;

'''John Hart Ely''' (December 3, 1938 – October 25, 2003) is one of the most widely cited legal scholars in United States history, ranking just after [[Richard Posner]], [[Ronald Dworkin]], and [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]], according to a 2000 study in the [[University of Chicago]]'s ''Journal of Legal Studies''.&lt;ref&gt;Fred R. Shapiro. [http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/468080 ''The Most-Cited Legal Scholars.''] [[The Journal of Legal Studies]], vol. 29 (January 2000), No. S1, pp. 409&amp;ndash;426
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Born in [[New York City]], John Hart Ely graduated from [[Princeton University]] in 1960 with an [[A.B.]] ''[[summa cum laude]]'' and [[Phi Beta Kappa]] and from [[Yale Law School]] with a [[LL.B.]] ''[[magna cum laude]]'' in 1963, where he was elected to the [[Order of the Coif]] and was the Notes and Comments Editor of the ''[[Yale Law Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opa.yale.edu/news/article.aspx?id%3D5006 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100713133901/http://opa.yale.edu/news/article.aspx?id=5006 |archivedate=2010-07-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a summer clerk at [[Arnold &amp; Porter|Arnold, Fortas, &amp; Porter]], a [[Washington, D.C.]] law firm, he assisted [[Abe Fortas]] in the landmark case of ''[[Gideon v. Wainwright]]'', writing a first draft of a brief on behalf of [[Clarence Earl Gideon]], a Florida drifter who had been tried and convicted without a lawyer. 

In the fall of 1963, Ely trained with Company A of the [[United States Army]]'s Military Police School at [[Fort Gordon, Georgia|Fort Gordon]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Ely served as the youngest staff member of the [[Warren Commission]], which investigated the assassination of President [[John F. Kennedy]]. He went on to clerk for U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice [[Earl Warren]], whom he considered a hero, and to whom he dedicated his landmark book, ''Democracy and Distrust'' (1980). As a clerk for Warren during the 1964 Term, Ely authored the landmark decision ''[[Hanna v. Plumer]]''.

Joining the faculty of [[Yale Law School]] in 1968, and moving to [[Harvard Law School]] in 1973, Ely wrote several influential law review articles, including a highly critical analysis of the Supreme Court's decision in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' in an article entitled "The Wages of Crying Wolf," published in the ''[[Yale Law Journal]]'', wherein he argued that the Court's decision protecting abortion rights was wrong "because it is not constitutional law and gives almost no sense of an obligation to try to be."  

Ely's most notable work was his 1980 book ''Democracy and Distrust,'' which ranks as one of the most influential works about constitutional law ever written. In it, he argues against "[[Interpretivism (legal)|interpretivism]]" of which [[Hugo Black]] was an exponent, "[[originalism]]" advanced by [[Robert Bork]], and "[[textualism]]" advanced by [[Antonin Scalia]], by contending that "strict construction" fails to do justice to the open texture of many of the Constitution's provisions; at the same time, though, he maintains that the notion that judges may infer broad moral rights and values from the Constitution is radically undemocratic, whether the "moralism" of [[Ronald Dworkin]] or the libertarian [[Richard Allen Epstein|Richard Epstein]]. Instead, Ely argued that the Supreme Court should interpret the Constitution so as to reinforce democratic processes and popular self-government, by ensuring equal representation in the political process (as in the Court's decision in ''[[Baker v. Carr]]'' [1961]).  He argues ''[[ejusdem generis]]'' that the Constitution's unenumerated rights (such as the [[Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution|9th Amendment]] or the Privileges or Immunities clause of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]]) are procedural in nature rather than substantive, thus protecting rights to democratic processes but not rights of a substantive nature.  Justice Stone's [[Footnote Four]] from ''[[US v. Carolene Products Co.|United States v. Carolene Products Co.]]'' (1938) is a chief inspiration for Ely's theory of judicial review.

In her recent book on [[Hans Kelsen]], Sandrine Baume identified Ely as a significant defender of the "compatibility of judicial review with the very principles of democracy."&lt;ref&gt;Baume, Sandrine (2011). ''Hans Kelsen and the Case for Democracy'', ECPR Press, pp53-54.&lt;/ref&gt; Ely was listed alongside Dworkin as one of the foremost defenders of this principle in recent years.

Ely went on to serve as dean of [[Stanford Law School]] from 1982 to 1987, and remained on the faculty until 1996. Prompted by his love of [[scuba diving]], he visited the [[University of Miami]] School of Law in 1996.  Discovering he liked the city and the faculty, he chose to stay and became the first holder of the law school's first endowed chair, named after Richard A. Hausler.  Ely was there when he died of [[cancer]], aged 64.
==Personal life==
He was married to Gisela Cardonne Ely, who is a state judge in [[Miami, Florida]].

Ely was formerly married to [[Nancy Halliday Ely-Raphel]], a [[United States Ambassador to Slovenia]].&lt;ref name="The New York Times; August 9, 1998"&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Weddings; Mary Jean Bonadonna, Robert Ely |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/08/09/style/weddings-mary-jean-bonadonna-robert-ely.html |newspaper=The New York Times |location=New York |date=August 9, 1998 |accessdate=December 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, '''judicial review''' is the ability of a [[judicial branch|court]] to examine and decide if a [[statute]], [[treaty]] or administrative [[regulation]] contradicts or violates the provisions of existing law, a [[State constitution (United States)|State Constitution]], or ultimately the [[United States Constitution]]. While the U.S. Constitution does not explicitly define a power of judicial review, the [[Authority#Government|authority]] for [[judicial review]] in the United States has been inferred from the structure, provisions, and history of the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://constitution.findlaw.com/article3/annotation13.html "The Establishment of Judicial Review"].
 ''[[Findlaw]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two landmark decisions by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] served to confirm the inferred constitutional authority for judicial review in the United States: In 1796, ''[[Hylton v. United States]]'' was the first case decided by the Supreme Court involving a direct challenge to the constitutionality of an act of [[United States Congress|Congress]], the Carriage Act of 1794 which imposed a "carriage tax".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/United_States_Statutes_at_Large/Volume_1/3rd_Congress/1st_Session/Chapter_45|title=United States Statutes at Large, Volume 1|first=United States|last=Congress|publisher=|via=Wikisource}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Court engaged in the process of judicial review by examining the plaintiff's claim that the carriage tax was unconstitutional. After review, the Supreme Court decided the Carriage Act was constitutional. In 1803, ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Marbury v. Madison,'' [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=5&amp;page=137 5 US (1 Cranch) 137 (1803)].&lt;/ref&gt; was the first Supreme Court case where the Court asserted its authority for judicial review to strike down a law as unconstitutional. At the end of his opinion in this decision,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vlib.us/amdocs/texts/marbury.htm|title=Marbury v. Madison - John Marshall - 1803 - AMDOCS: Documents for the Study of American History|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chief Justice John Marshall maintained that the Supreme Court's responsibility to overturn unconstitutional legislation was a necessary consequence of their sworn oath of office to uphold the Constitution as instructed in [[Article Six of the United States Constitution|Article Six]] of the Constitution.

{{As of|2014}}, the United States Supreme Court has held 176 Acts of the U.S. Congress unconstitutional.&lt;ref name=CRS-Const&gt;See Congressional Research Services' ''The Constitution Of The United States, Analysis And Interpretation'', 2013 Supplement, pp.&amp;nbsp;49-50.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judicial review before the Constitution==
{{quote box|quote=But it is not with a view to infractions of the Constitution only, that the independence of the judges may be an essential safeguard against the effects of occasional ill humors in the society. These sometimes extend no farther than to the injury of the private rights of particular classes of citizens, by unjust and partial laws. Here also the firmness of the judicial magistracy is of vast importance in mitigating the severity and confining the operation of such laws. It not only serves to moderate the immediate mischiefs of those which may have been passed, but it operates as a check upon the legislative body in passing them; who, perceiving that obstacles to the success of iniquitous intention are to be expected from the scruples of the courts, are in a manner compelled, by the very motives of the injustice they meditate, to qualify their attempts. This is a circumstance calculated to have more influence upon the character of our governments, than but few may be aware of.|source= — [[Alexander Hamilton]] in [[Federalist No. 78]]|width=30%|align=right}}

Before the [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]] in 1787, the power of judicial review had been exercised in a number of states. In the years from 1776 to 1787, state courts in at least seven of the thirteen states had engaged in judicial review and had invalidated state statutes because they violated the state constitution or other higher law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; These state courts treated state constitutions as statements of governing law to be interpreted and applied by judges. These courts reasoned that because their state constitution was the fundamental law of the state, they must apply the state constitution rather than an act of the legislature that was inconsistent with the state constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Prakash and Yoo, "The Origins of Judicial Review", 70 ''U. of Chicago Law Review'', pp. 933–934.&lt;/ref&gt;

These state court cases involving judicial review were reported in the press and produced public discussion and comment.&lt;ref&gt;Prakash and Yoo, "The Origins of Judicial Review", 70 ''U. of Chicago Law Review'', p. 936.&lt;/ref&gt; At least seven of the delegates to the [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]], including Alexander Hamilton and Edmund Randolph, had personal experience with judicial review because they had been lawyers or judges in these state court cases involving judicial review.&lt;ref&gt;Prakash and Yoo, "The Origins of Judicial Review", 70 ''U. of Chicago Law Review'' p. 939.&lt;/ref&gt; Other delegates referred to some of these state court cases during the debates at the Constitutional Convention.&lt;ref&gt;For example, James Madison referred to "the judges who refused to execute an unconstitutional law" in a Rhode Island case. {{cite book |title=The Records of the Federal Convention of 1787

==The provisions of the Constitution==

The text of the Constitution does not contain a specific reference to the power of judicial review. Rather, the power to declare laws unconstitutional has been deemed an implied power, derived from [[Article Three of the United States Constitution|Article III]] and [[Article Six of the United States Constitution|Article VI]].&lt;ref&gt;While the Constitution does not explicitly authorize judicial review, it also does not explicitly prohibit it, as did the [[Constitution of Virginia|Virginia Constitution]] of 1776. That Virginia Constitution said: "All power of suspending laws, or the execution of laws, by any authority, without consent of the representatives of the people, is injurious to their rights, and ought not to be exercised." [http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/states/va05.htm Virginia Constitution of 1776] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604122742/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/states/va05.htm |date=2008-06-04 }} via Avalon Project at Yale Law School.&lt;/ref&gt;

The provisions relating to the federal judicial power in Article III state:

{{quote|The judicial power of the United States, shall be vested in one Supreme Court, and in such inferior courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. ... The judicial power shall extend to all cases, in law and equity, arising under this Constitution, the laws of the United States, and treaties made, or which shall be made, under their authority. ... In all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, and those in which a state shall be party, the Supreme Court shall have [[original jurisdiction]]. In all the other cases before mentioned, the Supreme Court shall have [[appellate jurisdiction]], both as to law and fact, with such exceptions, and under such regulations as the Congress shall make.}}

The [[Supremacy Clause]] of Article VI states:

{{quote|This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding. ... [A]ll executive and judicial Officers, both of the United States and of the several States, shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution.}}

The power of judicial review has been implied from these provisions based on the following reasoning. It is the inherent duty of the courts to determine the applicable law in any given case. The Supremacy Clause says "[t]his Constitution" is the "supreme law of the land." The Constitution therefore is the fundamental law of the United States. Federal statutes are the law of the land only when they are "made in pursuance" of the Constitution. State constitutions and statutes are valid only if they are consistent with the Constitution. Any law contrary to the Constitution is void. The federal judicial power extends to all cases "arising under this Constitution." As part of their inherent duty to determine the law, the federal courts have the duty to interpret and apply the Constitution and to decide whether a federal or state statute conflicts with the Constitution. All judges are bound to follow the Constitution. If there is a conflict, the federal courts have a duty to follow the Constitution and to treat the conflicting statute as unenforceable. The Supreme Court has final appellate jurisdiction in all cases arising under the Constitution, so the Supreme Court has the ultimate authority to decide whether statutes are consistent with the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'', 5 U.S. at 175–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statements by the framers of the Constitution regarding judicial review==

===The Constitutional Convention===

During the debates at the [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]], the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] made a number of references to the concept of judicial review. The greatest number of these references occurred during the discussion of the proposal known as the [[Virginia Plan]]. The Virginia Plan included a "council of revision" that would have examined proposed new federal laws and would have accepted or rejected them, similar to today's presidential veto. The "council of revision" would have included the President along with some federal judges. Several delegates objected to the inclusion of federal judges on the council of revision. They argued the federal judiciary, through its power to declare laws unconstitutional, already had the opportunity to protect against legislative encroachment, and the judiciary did not need a second way to negate laws by participating in the council of revision. For example, Elbridge Gerry said federal judges "would have a sufficient check against encroachments on their own department by their exposition of the laws, which involved a power of deciding on their constitutionality. In some states the judges had actually set aside laws, as being against the constitution. This was done too with general approbation."&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite book |title=The Records of the Federal Convention of 1787

|year=1911 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |page=97 |volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luther Martin said: "[A]s to the constitutionality of laws, that point will come before the judges in their official character. In this character they have a negative on the laws. Join them with the executive in the revision, and they will have a double negative."&lt;ref&gt;Farrand, ''The Records of the Federal Convention of 1787'', [http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llfr&amp;fileName=002/llfr002.db&amp;recNum=79&amp;itemLink=r?ammem/hlaw:@field%28DOCID+@lit%28fr00223%29%29%230020075&amp;linkText=1 vol. 2, p. 76]. Nathaniel Gorham also made comments along these lines. See {{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; These and other similar comments by the delegates indicated that the federal courts would have the power of judicial review.

Other delegates argued that if federal judges were involved in the law-making process through participation on the council of revision, their objectivity as judges in later deciding on the constitutionality of those laws could be impaired.&lt;ref&gt;Delegates making these comments included Rufus King, Caleb Strong, Nathaniel Gorham, and John Rutledge. See Rakove, "The Origins of Judicial Review: A Plea for New Contexts", 49 ''Stanford Law Review'' at 1058.&lt;/ref&gt; These comments indicated a belief that the federal courts would have the power to declare laws unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;The council of revision proposed in the [[Virginia Plan]] ultimately morphed into the [[Presidential veto]]. In its final form, the executive alone would exercise the veto, without participation by the federal judiciary.&lt;/ref&gt;

At several other points in the debates at the [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]], delegates made comments indicating their belief that under the Constitution, federal judges would have the power of judicial review. For example, [[James Madison]] said: "A law violating a constitution established by the people themselves, would be considered by the Judges as null &amp; void."&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', [http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llfr&amp;fileName=002/llfr002.db&amp;recNum=96&amp;itemLink=r%3Fammem%2Fhlaw%3A%40field%28DOCID%2B%40lit%28fr00224%29%29%3A%230020082&amp;linkText=1 p. 93]. Delegates approving of judicial review also included James Wilson and Gouverneur Morris, among others. See Prakash and Yoo, "The Origins of Judicial Review", 70 ''U. of Chicago Law Review'' at 941–43.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[George Mason]] said that federal judges "could declare an unconstitutional law void."&lt;ref name="Farrand 1911 78"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Records of the Federal Convention of 1787
 |url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llfr&amp;fileName=002/llfr002.db&amp;recNum=81&amp;itemLink=r?ammem/hlaw:@field%28DOCID+@lit%28fr00224%29%29:%230020082&amp;linkText=1 |last=Farrand |first=Max|authorlink= Max Farrand
|year=1911 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |page=78 |volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Mason added that the power of judicial review is not a general power to strike down all laws, but only ones that are unconstitutional:&lt;ref name="Farrand 1911 78" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;But with regard to every law however unjust, oppressive or pernicious, which did not come plainly under this description, they would be under the necessity as Judges to give it a free course.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In all, fifteen delegates from nine states made comments regarding the power of the federal courts to review the constitutionality of laws. All but two of them supported the idea that the federal courts would have the power of judicial review.&lt;ref&gt;Prakash and Yoo, "The Origins of Judicial Review", 70 ''U. of Chicago Law Review'', p. 952. The two delegates who disapproved judicial review, John Dickinson and John Mercer, did not propose a provision prohibiting judicial review. During the state ratification conventions, they acknowledged that under the final Constitution, the courts would have the power of judicial review. Prakash and Yoo, "The Origins of Judicial Review", 70 ''U. of Chicago Law Review'', p. 943.&lt;/ref&gt; Some delegates to the Constitutional Convention did not speak about judicial review during the Convention, but did speak about it before or after the Convention. Including these additional comments by Convention delegates, scholars have found that twenty-five or twenty-six of the Convention delegates made comments indicating support for judicial review, while three to six delegates opposed judicial review.&lt;ref&gt;Raoul Berger found that twenty-six Convention delegates supported Constitution review, with six opposed. {{cite book|last=Berger|first=Raoul|title=Congress v. The Supreme Court|year=1969|publisher=Harvard University Press|page=104}} Charles Beard counted twenty-five delegates in favor of judicial review and three against. {{cite book|last=Beard|first=Charles|title=The Supreme Court and the Constitution|year=1962|origyear=1912|publisher=Prentice Hall|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; One review of the debates and voting records of the convention counted as many as forty delegates who supported judicial review, with four or five opposed.&lt;ref&gt;Melvin, Frank, "The Judicial Bulwark of the Constitution", 8 ''American Political Science Review 167'', 185–195 (1914).&lt;/ref&gt;

In their comments relating to judicial review, the framers indicated that the power of judges to declare laws unconstitutional was part of the system of separation of powers. The framers stated that the courts' power to declare laws unconstitutional would provide a check on the legislature, protecting against excessive exercise of legislative power.&lt;ref&gt;See Prakash and Yoo, "The Origins of Judicial Review", 70 ''U. of Chicago Law Review'' at pp. 931–32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[James Madison]] at one point said that the courts' power of judicial review should be limited to cases of a judiciary nature: "He doubted whether it was not going too far to extend the jurisdiction of the Court generally to cases arising under the Constitution and whether it ought not to be limited to cases of a judiciary nature. The right of expounding the Constitution in cases not of this nature ought not to be given to that department." {{cite book |title=The Records of the Federal Convention of 1787
 |url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llfr&amp;fileName=002/llfr002.db&amp;recNum=435&amp;itemLink=r?ammem/hlaw:@field%28DOCID+@lit%28fr002118%29%29%230020436&amp;linkText=1 |last=Farrand |first=Max|authorlink= Max Farrand
|year=1911 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |page=430 |volume=2}} Madison wanted to clarify that the courts would not have a free-floating power to declare unconstitutional any law that was passed; rather, the courts would be able to rule on constitutionality of laws only when those laws were properly presented to them in the context of a court case that came before them. See Burr, Charles, "Unconstitutional Laws and the Federal Judicial Power", 60 ''U. Pennsylvania Law Review'' 624, 630 (1912). No change in the language was made in response to Madison's comment.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The state ratification debates===

Judicial review was discussed in at least seven of the thirteen state ratifying conventions, and was mentioned by almost two dozen delegates. In each of these conventions, delegates asserted that the proposed Constitution would allow the courts to exercise judicial review. There is no record of any delegate to a state ratifying convention who indicated that the federal courts would not have the power of judicial review.&lt;ref&gt;See Prakash and Yoo, "The Origins of Judicial Review", 70 ''U. of Chicago Law Review'' at p. 965.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, James Wilson asserted in the Pennsylvania ratifying convention that federal judges would exercise judicial review: "If a law should be made inconsistent with those powers vested by this instrument in Congress, the judges, as a consequence of their independence, and the particular powers of government being defined, will declare such law to be null and void. For the power of the Constitution predominates. Anything, therefore, that shall be enacted by Congress contrary thereto will not have the force of law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Debates in the Several State Conventions on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution

|year=1863 |publisher=Lippincott |location=Philadelphia |page=489 |volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Connecticut ratifying convention, Oliver Ellsworth likewise described judicial review as a feature of the Constitution: "This Constitution defines the extent of the powers of the general government. If the general legislature should at any time overleap their limits, the judicial department is a constitutional check. If the United States go beyond their powers, if they make a law which the Constitution does not authorize, it is void; and the judicial power, the national judges, who, to secure their impartiality, are to be made independent, will declare it to be void."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Debates in the Several State Conventions on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution

|origyear=1836
|year=1863 |publisher=Lippincott |location=Philadelphia |page=196 |volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the ratification process, supporters and opponents of ratification published pamphlets, essays, and speeches debating various aspects of the Constitution. Publications by over a dozen authors in at least twelve of the thirteen states asserted that under the Constitution, the federal courts would have the power of judicial review. There is no record of any opponent to the Constitution who claimed that the Constitution did not involve a power of judicial review.&lt;ref&gt;See Prakash and Yoo, "The Origins of Judicial Review", 70 ''U. of Chicago Law Review'' at pp. 973–75.&lt;/ref&gt;

After reviewing the statements made by the founders, one scholar concluded: "The evidence from the Constitutional Convention and from the state ratification conventions is overwhelming that the original public meaning of the term 'judicial power' [in Article III] included the power to nullify unconstitutional laws."&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, Randy, "The Original Meaning of Judicial Power", 12 ''Supreme Court Economic Review'' 115, 138 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Federalist Papers''===

''[[The Federalist Papers]]'', which were published in 1787–1788 to promote ratification of the Constitution, made several references to the power of judicial review. The most extensive discussion of judicial review was in [[Federalist No. 78]], written by [[Alexander Hamilton]], which clearly explained that the federal courts would have the power of judicial review. Hamilton stated that under the Constitution, the federal judiciary would have the power to declare laws unconstitutional. Hamilton asserted that this was appropriate because it would protect the people against abuse of power by Congress:

{{quote|[T]he courts were designed to be an intermediate body between the people and the legislature, in order, among other things, to keep the latter within the limits assigned to their authority. The interpretation of the laws is the proper and peculiar province of the courts. A constitution is, in fact, and must be regarded by the judges, as a fundamental law. It therefore belongs to them to ascertain its meaning, as well as the meaning of any particular act proceeding from the legislative body. If there should happen to be an irreconcilable variance between the two, that which has the superior obligation and validity ought, of course, to be preferred; or, in other words, the Constitution ought to be preferred to the statute, the intention of the people to the intention of their agents.

Nor does this conclusion by any means suppose a superiority of the judicial to the legislative power. It only supposes that the power of the people is superior to both; and that where the will of the legislature, declared in its statutes, stands in opposition to that of the people, declared in the Constitution, the judges ought to be governed by the latter rather than the former. They ought to regulate their decisions by the fundamental laws, rather than by those which are not fundamental. ...

[A]ccordingly, whenever a particular statute contravenes the Constitution, it will be the duty of the Judicial tribunals to adhere to the latter and disregard the former. ...

[T]he courts of justice are to be considered as the bulwarks of a limited Constitution against legislative encroachments.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Alexander. [[s:The Federalist (Dawson)/78|Federalist No. 78 (June 14, 1788)]]. See also Federalist No. 81, which says: "[T]he Constitution ought to be the standard of construction for the laws, and ... wherever there is an evident opposition, the laws ought to give place to the Constitution." [[s:The Federalist (Dawson)/81|Federalist No. 81 (June 28, 1788)]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In [[Federalist No. 80]], Hamilton rejected the idea that the power to decide the constitutionality of an act of Congress should lie with each of the states: "The mere necessity of uniformity in the interpretation of the national laws, decides the question. Thirteen independent courts of final jurisdiction over the same causes, arising upon the same laws, is a hydra in government, from which nothing but contradiction and confusion can proceed."&lt;ref&gt;[[s:The Federalist (Dawson)/80|Federalist No. 80 (June 21, 1788)]]&lt;/ref&gt; Consistent with the need for uniformity in interpretation of the Constitution, Hamilton explained in [[Federalist No. 82]] that the Supreme Court has authority to hear appeals from the state courts in cases relating to the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:The Federalist (Dawson)/82|Federalist No. 82 (July 2, 1788)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The arguments against ratification by the [[Anti-Federalist Papers|Anti-Federalists]] agreed that the federal courts would have the power of judicial review, though the Anti-Federalists viewed this negatively. [[Robert Yates (politician)|Robert Yates]], writing under the pseudonym "Brutus", stated:

{{quote|[T]he judges under this constitution will control the legislature, for the supreme court are authorised in the last resort, to determine what is the extent of the powers of the Congress. They are to give the constitution an explanation, and there is no power above them to set aside their judgment. ... The supreme court then have a right, independent of the legislature, to give a construction to the constitution and every part of it, and there is no power provided in this system to correct their construction or do it away. If, therefore, the legislature pass any laws, inconsistent with the sense the judges put upon the constitution, they will declare it void.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/index.asp?document=70|title=The Problem of Judicial Review - Teaching American History|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Judicial review between the adoption of the Constitution and ''Marbury''==

===The Judiciary Act of 1789===
The first Congress passed the [[s:United States Statutes at Large/Volume 1/1st Congress/1st Session/Chapter 20|Judiciary Act of 1789]], establishing the lower federal courts and specifying the details of federal court jurisdiction. Section 25 of the Judiciary Act provided for the Supreme Court to hear appeals from state courts when the state court decided that a federal statute was invalid, or when the state court upheld a state statute against a claim that the state statute was repugnant to the Constitution. This provision gave the Supreme Court the power to review state court decisions involving the constitutionality of both federal statutes and state statutes. The Judiciary Act thereby incorporated the concept of judicial review.

===Court decisions from 1788 to 1803===
Between the ratification of the Constitution in 1788 and the decision in ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'' in 1803, judicial review was employed in both the federal and state courts. A detailed analysis has identified thirty-one state or federal cases during this time in which statutes were struck down as unconstitutional, and seven additional cases in which statutes were upheld but at least one judge concluded the statute was unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author of this analysis, Professor William Treanor, concluded: "The sheer number of these decisions not only belies the notion that the institution of judicial review was created by Chief Justice Marshall in ''Marbury'', it also reflects widespread acceptance and application of the doctrine."&lt;ref&gt;Treanor, "Judicial Review Before ''Marbury''", 58 ''Stanford Law Review'', p. 458.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other cases involving judicial review issues reached the Supreme Court before the issue was definitively decided in ''Marbury'' in 1803.

In ''[[Hayburn's Case]]'', 2 U.S. (2 Dall.) 408 (1792), federal circuit courts held an act of Congress unconstitutional for the first time. Three federal circuit courts found that Congress had violated the Constitution by passing an act requiring circuit court judges to decide pension applications, subject to the review of the Secretary of War. These circuit courts found that this was not a proper judicial function under Article III. These three decisions were appealed to the Supreme Court, but the appeals became moot when Congress repealed the statute while the appeals were pending.&lt;ref&gt;Five of the six Supreme Court justices at that time had sat as circuit judges in the three circuit court cases that were appealed. All five of them had found the statute unconstitutional in their capacity as circuit judges.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an unreported Supreme Court decision in 1794, ''United States v. Yale Todd'',&lt;ref&gt;There was no official report of the case. The case is described in a note at the end of the Supreme Court's decision in ''United States v. Ferreira'', 54 U.S. (13 How.) 40 (1851).&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court reversed a pension that was awarded under the same pension act that had been at issue in ''Hayburn's Case''. The Court apparently decided that the act designating judges to decide pensions was not constitutional because this was not a proper judicial function. This apparently was the first Supreme Court case to find an act of Congress unconstitutional. However, there was not an official report of the case and it was not used as a precedent.

''[[Hylton v. United States]]'', 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 171 (1796), was the first case decided by the Supreme Court that involved a challenge to the constitutionality of an act of Congress. It was argued that a federal tax on carriages violated the constitutional provision regarding "direct" taxes. The Supreme Court upheld the tax, finding it was constitutional. Although the Supreme Court did not strike down the act in question, the Court engaged in the process of judicial review by considering the constitutionality of the tax. The case was widely publicized at the time, and observers understood that the Court was testing the constitutionality of an act of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Professor Jack Rakove wrote: "''Hylton v. United States'' was manifestly a case of judicial review of the constitutionality of legislation, in an area of governance and public policy far more sensitive than that exposed by ''Marbury'', and it was a case whose implications observers seemed to grasp." See Rakove, "The Origins of Judicial Review: A Plea for New Contexts", 49 ''Stanford Law Review'' at 1039–41.&lt;/ref&gt; Because it found the statute valid, the Court did not have to assert that it had the power to declare a statute unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;Justice Chase's opinion stated: "[I]t is unnecessary, at this time, for me to determine, whether this court, constitutionally possesses the power to declare an act of congress void, on the ground of its being made contrary to, and in violation of, the constitution."&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Ware v. Hylton]]'', 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 199 (1796), the Supreme Court for the first time struck down a state statute. The Court reviewed a Virginia statute regarding pre-Revolutionary war debts and found that it was inconsistent with the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|peace treaty]] between the United States and Great Britain. Relying on the Supremacy Clause, the Court found the Virginia statute invalid.

In ''[[Hollingsworth v. Virginia]]'', 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 378 (1798), the Supreme Court found that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the case because of the jurisdiction limitations of the [[Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eleventh Amendment]]. This holding could be viewed as an implicit finding that the [[Judiciary Act of 1789]], which would have allowed the Court jurisdiction, was unconstitutional in part. However, the Court did not provide any reasoning for its conclusion and did not say that it was finding the statute unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;See Treanor, "Judicial Review Before ''Marbury''", 58 ''Stanford Law Review'', p. 547.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Cooper v. Telfair'', 4 U.S. (4 Dall.) 14 (1800), Justice Chase stated: "It is indeed a general opinion—it is expressly admitted by all this bar and some of the judges have, individually in the circuits decided, that the Supreme Court can declare an act of Congress to be unconstitutional, and therefore invalid, but there is no adjudication of the Supreme Court itself upon the point."&lt;ref&gt;Chase's statement about decisions by judges in the circuits referred to ''[[Hayburn's Case]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Responses to the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions===

In 1798, the Kentucky and Virginia legislatures passed a series of [[Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions|resolutions]] asserting that the states have the power to determine whether acts of Congress are constitutional. In response, ten states passed their own resolutions disapproving the [[Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions|Kentucky and Virginia resolutions]].&lt;ref&gt;Seven states formally rejected the Kentucky and Virginia resolutions and transmitted their rejections to Kentucky and Virginia (Delaware, Massachusetts, New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, and Vermont). See {{cite book |title=[[s:Debates in the Several State Conventions on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution|Debates in the Several State Conventions on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution]]

The other four states took no action.&lt;/ref&gt; Six of these states took the position that the power to declare acts of Congress unconstitutional lies in the federal courts, not in the state legislatures. For example, Vermont's resolution stated: "It belongs not to state legislatures to decide on the constitutionality of laws made by the general government; this power being exclusively vested in the judiciary courts of the Union."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[s:Debates in the Several State Conventions on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution|Debates in the Several State Conventions on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution]]

The other states taking the position that the constitutionality of federal laws is a question for the federal courts, not the states, were New York, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, and Pennsylvania. The Governor of Delaware and a Committee of the Maryland legislature also took this position. The remaining states did not address this issue. {{cite book | last = Anderson | first = Frank Maloy | chapter = [[s:Contemporary Opinion of the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions|Contemporary Opinion of the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions]] | publisher = American Historical Review | year = 1899 | location = | pages = 45&amp;ndash;63, 225&amp;ndash;244 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, five years before ''Marbury v. Madison'', a number of state legislatures stated their understanding that under the Constitution, the federal courts possess the power of judicial review.

==''Marbury v. Madison''==
{{Main|Marbury v. Madison}}
The Supreme Court's landmark decision regarding judicial review is ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'', 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137 (1803). ''Marbury'' was the first Supreme Court decision to strike down an act of Congress as unconstitutional. Chief Justice [[John Marshall]] wrote the opinion for a unanimous Court.

The case arose when William Marbury filed a lawsuit seeking an order (a "[[mandamus|writ of mandamus]]") requiring the Secretary of State, James Madison, to deliver to Marbury a commission appointing him as a justice of the peace. Marbury filed his case directly in the Supreme Court, invoking the Court's "[[original jurisdiction]]", rather than filing in a lower court.&lt;ref&gt;For a more detailed description of the case, see ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The constitutional issue involved the question of whether the Supreme Court had jurisdiction to hear the case.&lt;ref&gt;There were several non-constitutional issues, including whether Marbury was entitled to the commission and whether a writ of mandamus was the appropriate remedy. The Court's opinion dealt with those issues first, finding that Marbury was entitled to the commission and that mandamus was a proper remedy. See ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Judiciary Act of 1789]] gave the Supreme Court [[original jurisdiction]] in cases involving writs of mandamus. So, under the Judiciary Act, the Supreme Court would have had jurisdiction to hear Marbury's case. However, the Constitution describes the cases in which the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction, and does not include mandamus cases.&lt;ref&gt;[[Article III]] of the Constitution says: "In all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, and those in which a state shall be party, the Supreme Court shall have original jurisdiction. In all the other cases ... the Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction."&lt;/ref&gt; The Judiciary Act therefore attempted to give the Supreme Court jurisdiction that was not "warranted by the Constitution."&lt;ref&gt;''Marbury'', 5 U.S. at 175–176.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marshall's opinion stated that in the Constitution, the people established a government of limited powers: "The powers of the Legislature are defined and limited; and that those limits may not be mistaken or forgotten, the Constitution is written." The limits established in the Constitution would be meaningless "if these limits may at any time be passed by those intended to be restrained." Marshall observed that the Constitution is "the fundamental and paramount law of the nation", and that it cannot be altered by an ordinary act of the legislature. Therefore, "an act of the Legislature repugnant to the Constitution is void."&lt;ref&gt;''Marbury'', 5 U.S., pp. 176–177.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marshall then discussed the role of the courts, which is at the heart of the doctrine of judicial review. It would be an "absurdity", said Marshall, to require the courts to apply a law that is void. Rather, it is the inherent duty of the courts to interpret and apply the Constitution, and to determine whether there is a conflict between a statute and the Constitution:

{{quote|It is emphatically the province and duty of the Judicial Department to say what the law is. Those who apply the rule to particular cases must, of necessity, expound and interpret that rule. If two laws conflict with each other, the Courts must decide on the operation of each.

So, if a law be in opposition to the Constitution, if both the law and the Constitution apply to a particular case, so that the Court must either decide that case conformably to the law, disregarding the Constitution, or conformably to the Constitution, disregarding the law, the Court must determine which of these conflicting rules governs the case. This is of the very essence of judicial duty.

If, then, the Courts are to regard the Constitution, and the Constitution is superior to any ordinary act of the Legislature, the Constitution, and not such ordinary act, must govern the case to which they both apply. ...&lt;ref&gt;''Marbury'', 5 U.S., pp. 177–178.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Marshall stated that the courts are authorized by the provisions of the Constitution itself to "look into" the Constitution, that is, to interpret and apply it, and that they have the duty to refuse to enforce any laws that are contrary to the Constitution. Specifically, [[Article III]] provides that the federal judicial power "is extended to all cases arising under the Constitution." [[Article Six of the United States Constitution|Article VI]] requires judges to take an oath "to support this Constitution." Article VI also states that only laws "made in pursuance of the Constitution" are the law of the land. Marshall concluded: "Thus, the particular phraseology of the Constitution of the United States confirms and strengthens the principle, supposed to be essential to all written Constitutions, that a law repugnant to the Constitution is void, and that courts, as well as other departments, are bound by that instrument."&lt;ref&gt;''Marbury'', 5 U.S., pp. 178–180.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Marbury'' long has been regarded as the seminal case with respect to the doctrine of judicial review. Some scholars have suggested that Marshall's opinion in ''Marbury'' essentially created judicial review. In his book ''The Least Dangerous Branch'', Professor Alexander Bickel wrote:

{{quote|[T]he institution of the judiciary needed to be summoned up out of the constitutional vapors, shaped, and maintained. And the Great Chief Justice, John Marshall—not single-handed, but first and foremost—was there to do it and did. If any social process can be said to have been 'done' at a given time, and by a given act, it is Marshall's achievement. The time was 1803; the act was the decision in the case of ''Marbury v. Madison''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bickel|first=Alexander|title=The Least Dangerous Branch: The Supreme Court at the Bar of Politics|year=1962|publisher=Bobbs-Merrill|location=Indianapolis|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}Other scholars view this as an overstatement, and argue that ''Marbury'' was decided in a context in which judicial review already was a familiar concept. These scholars point to the facts showing that judicial review was acknowledged by the Constitution's framers, was explained in the Federalist Papers and in the ratification debates, and was used by both state and federal courts for more than twenty years before ''Marbury'', including the Supreme Court in ''Hylton v. United States''. One scholar concluded: "[B]efore ''Marbury'', judicial review had gained wide support."&lt;ref&gt;Treanor, "Judicial Review Before ''Marbury''", 58 ''Stanford Law Review'' at 555. See also Rakove, "The Origins of Judicial Review: A Plea for New Contexts", 49 ''Stanford Law Review'' at 1035–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judicial review after ''Marbury''==

''Marbury'' was the point at which the Supreme Court adopted a monitoring role over government actions.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Langer, ''Judicial Review in State Supreme Courts: A Comparative Study'' (Albany: State University of New York Press, 2002), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; After the Court exercised its power of judicial review in ''Marbury'', it avoided striking down a federal statute during the next fifty years. The court would not do so again until ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'', 60 U.S. (19 How.) 393 (1857).&lt;ref name="Dred"&gt;See Menez, Joseph et al., ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=PBamtI5ih3IC&amp;pg=PA125&amp;dq=%22first+time+the+court%22+and+%22judicial+review%22&amp;num=100&amp;sig=8GqyaBpwOXxnwW30Io23g32xKK4 Summaries of Leading Cases on the Constitution]'', page 125 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Supreme Court did exercise judicial review in other contexts. In particular, the Court struck down a number of state statutes that were contrary to the Constitution. The first case in which the Supreme Court struck down a state statute as unconstitutional was ''[[Fletcher v. Peck]]'', 10 U.S. (6 Cranch) 87 (1810).&lt;ref&gt;The Supreme Court subsequently decided a number of other cases finding state statutes unconstitutional. See, for example, ''[[Sturges v. Crowninshield]]'', 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 122 (1819), ''[[McCulloch v. Maryland]]'', 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316 (1819), and ''[[Gibbons v. Ogden]]'', 22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 1 (1824).&lt;/ref&gt;

In a few cases, state courts took the position that their judgments were final and were not subject to review by the Supreme Court. They argued that the Constitution did not give the Supreme Court the authority to review state court decisions. They asserted that the [[Judiciary Act of 1789]], which provided that the Supreme Court could hear certain appeals from state courts, was unconstitutional. In effect, these state courts were asserting that the principle of judicial review did not extend to allow federal review of state court decisions. This would have left the states free to adopt their own interpretations of the Constitution.

The Supreme Court rejected this argument. In ''[[Martin v. Hunter's Lessee]]'', 14 U.S. (1 Wheat.) 304 (1816), the Court held that under [[Article III]], the federal courts have jurisdiction to hear all cases arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States, and that the Supreme Court has appellate jurisdiction in all such cases, whether those cases are filed in state or federal courts. The Court issued another decision to the same effect in the context of a criminal case, ''[[Cohens v. Virginia]]'', 19 U.S. (6 Wheat.) 264 (1821). It is now well established that the Supreme Court may review decisions of state courts that involve federal law.

The Supreme Court also has reviewed actions of the federal executive branch to determine whether those actions were authorized by acts of Congress or were beyond the authority granted by Congress.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Little v. Barreme]]'', 6 U.S. (2 Cranch) 170 (1804) (the "''Flying Fish'' case").&lt;/ref&gt;

Judicial review is now well established as a cornerstone of constitutional law. As of September 2017, the United States Supreme Court had held unconstitutional portions or the entirety of some 182 Acts of the U.S. Congress, the most recent in the Supreme Court's June 2017 [[Matal v. Tam]] decision striking down a portion of July 1946's [[Lanham Act]].

==Criticism of judicial review==

Although judicial review has now become an established part of constitutional law in the United States, there are some who disagree with the doctrine.

At the Constitutional Convention, neither proponents nor opponents of judicial review disputed that any government based on a written constitution requires some mechanism to prevent laws that violate that constitution from being made and enforced. Otherwise, the document would be meaningless, and the legislature, with the power to enact any laws whatsoever, would be the supreme arm of government (the British doctrine of [[parliamentary sovereignty]]). The delegates at the Convention differed with respect to the question of whether Congress or the judiciary should make determinations regarding constitutionality of statutes. [[Alexander Hamilton|Hamilton]] addressed this in [[Federalist No. 78]], in which he explained the reasons that the federal judiciary has the role of reviewing the constitutionality of statutes:

{{quote|If it be said that the legislative body are themselves the constitutional judges of their own powers, and that the construction they put upon them is conclusive upon the other departments, it may be answered, that this cannot be the natural presumption, where it is not to be collected from any particular provisions in the Constitution. It is not otherwise to be supposed, that the Constitution could intend to enable the representatives of the people to substitute their will to that of their constituents. It is far more rational to suppose, that the courts were designed to be an intermediate body between the people and the legislature, in order, among other things, to keep the latter within the limits assigned to their authority.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Alexander. [http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa78.htm Federalist #78] (June 14, 1788).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Since the adoption of the Constitution, some have argued that the power of judicial review gives the courts the ability to impose their own views of the law, without an adequate check from any other branch of government. [[Robert Yates (politician)|Robert Yates]], a delegate to the [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]] from [[New York (state)|New York]], argued during the ratification process in the Anti-Federalist Papers that the courts would use the power of judicial review loosely to impose their views about the "spirit" of the Constitution:

{{quote|[I]n their decisions they will not confine themselves to any fixed or established rules, but will determine, according to what appears to them, the reason and spirit of the constitution. The opinions of the supreme court, whatever they may be, will have the force of law; because there is no power provided in the constitution, that can correct their errors, or controul their adjudications. From this court there is no appeal.&lt;ref&gt;Yates, Robert (writing as "Brutus"). [http://www.constitution.org/afp/brutus11.htm Anti-Federalist Papers] (31 January 1788).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1820, [[Thomas Jefferson]] expressed his opposition to the doctrine of judicial review:

{{quote|You seem ... to consider the judges as the ultimate arbiters of all constitutional questions; a very dangerous doctrine indeed, and one which would place us under the despotism of an oligarchy. Our judges are as honest as other men, and not more so. They have, with others, the same passions for party, for power, and the privilege of their corps. ... Their power [is] the more dangerous as they are in office for life, and not responsible, as the other functionaries are, to the elective control. The Constitution has erected no such single tribunal, knowing that to whatever hands confided, with the corruptions of time and party, its members would become despots. It has more wisely made all the departments co-equal and co-sovereign within themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Jefferson, Thomas. [https://books.google.com/books?id=vvVVhCadyK4C&amp;pg=PA178&amp;dq=%22which+would+place+us+under+the+despotism+of+an+oligarchy%22 The Writings of Thomas Jefferson], Letter to William Jarvis (September 28, 1820).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1861, Abraham Lincoln touched upon the same subject, during his first inaugural address:

{{quote|[T]he candid citizen must confess that if the policy of the Government upon vital questions affecting the whole people is to be irrevocably fixed by decisions of the Supreme Court, the instant they are made in ordinary litigation between parties in personal actions the people will have ceased to be their own rulers, having to that extent practically resigned their Government into the hands of that eminent tribunal. Nor is there in this view any assault upon the court or the judges. It is a duty from which they may not shrink to decide cases properly brought before them, and it is no fault of theirs if others seek to turn their decisions to political purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln, Abraham. [http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/presiden/inaug/lincoln1.htm First Inaugural Address] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817013208/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/presiden/inaug/lincoln1.htm |date=2007-08-17 }}
(March 4, 1861).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Lincoln was alluding here to the case of ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'', in which the Court had struck down a federal statute for the first time since ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]''.&lt;ref name="Dred" /&gt;

It has been argued that the judiciary is not the only branch of government that may interpret the meaning of the Constitution.{{who|date=June 2012}} [[Article Six of the United States Constitution|Article VI]] requires federal and state officeholders to be bound "by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution." It has been argued that such officials may follow their own interpretations of the Constitution, at least until those interpretations have been tested in court.

Some have argued that judicial review is unconstitutional&lt;ref name="Crosskey"&gt;See W.W. Crosskey, ''Politics and the Constitution in the History of the United States (Chicago: 1953), chs. 27-29, with which compare Hart, Book Review, 67 Harv. L. Rev. 1456 (1954). A brief review of the debate on the subject is Westin, "Introduction: Charles Beard and American Debate over Judicial Review, 1790-1961", in: ''C. Beard, The Supreme Court and the Constitution'' (Englewood Cliffs: 1962 reissue of 1938 ed.), 1-34, and bibliography at 133-149. See more at: http://constitution.findlaw.com/article3/annotation13.html#f576&lt;/ref&gt; based on two arguments. First, the power of judicial review is not expressly delegated to the courts in the Constitution. The [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]] reserves to the states (or to the people) those powers not delegated to the federal government. The second argument is that the states alone have the power to ratify changes to the "supreme law" (the [[U.S. Constitution]]), and that the states should play some role in interpreting its meaning. Under this theory, allowing only federal courts to definitively conduct judicial review of federal law allows the national government to interpret its own restrictions as it sees fit, with no meaningful input from the ratifying power.

==Standard of review==
In the United States, unconstitutionality is the ''only'' ground for a federal court to strike down a federal statute. [[Bushrod Washington|Justice Washington]], speaking for the Marshall Court, put it this way in an 1829 case:

{{quote|We intend to decide no more than that the statute objected to in this case is not repugnant to the Constitution of the United States, and that unless it be so, this Court has no authority, under the 25th section of the judiciary act, to re-examine and to reverse the judgement of the supreme court of Pennsylvania in the present case.&lt;ref&gt;''Satterlee v. Matthewson'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=case&amp;court=us&amp;vol=27&amp;invol=380 27 U.S. 380 (1829)].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

If a state statute conflicts with a valid federal statute, then courts may strike down the state statute as an unstatutable&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/unstatutable|title=Unstatutable - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary|work=[[Merriam-Webster]]|accessdate=8 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; violation of the [[Supremacy Clause]]. But a federal court may not strike down a statute absent a violation of federal law or of the federal Constitution.

Moreover, a suspicion or possibility of unconstitutionality is not enough for American courts to strike down a statute. [[Alexander Hamilton]] explained in [[Federalist 78]] that the standard of review should be "irreconcilable variance" with the Constitution. Anti-federalists agreed that courts would be unable to strike down federal statutes absent a conflict with the Constitution. For example, [[Robert Yates (politician)|Robert Yates]], writing under the pseudonym "Brutus", asserted that "the courts of the general government [will] be under obligation to observe the laws made by the general legislature not repugnant to the constitution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a3_2_2s2.html|title=Article 3, Section 2, Clause 2: Brutus, no. 14|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These principles—that federal statutes can only be struck down for unconstitutionality and that the unconstitutionality must be clear—were very common views at the time of the framing of the Constitution. For example, [[George Mason]] explained during the constitutional convention that judges "could declare an unconstitutional law void. But with regard to every law, however unjust, oppressive or pernicious, which did not come plainly under this description, they would be under the necessity as Judges to give it a free course."&lt;ref name="Farrand 1911 78"/&gt;

For a number of years, the courts were relatively deferential to Congress. Justice Washington put it this way, in an 1827 case: "It is but a decent respect to the wisdom, integrity, and patriotism of the legislative body, by which any law is passed, to presume in favor of its validity, until its violation of the Constitution is proved beyond a reasonable doubt."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ogden v. Saunders]]'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=25&amp;invol=213 25 U.S. 213] (1827).&lt;/ref&gt;

Although judges usually adhered to this principle that a statute could only be deemed unconstitutional in case of a clear contradiction until the twentieth century, this [[presumption of constitutionality]] weakened somewhat during the twentieth century, as exemplified by the Supreme Court's famous [[footnote four]] in ''[[United States v. Carolene Products Co.]]'', 304 U.S. 144 (1938), which suggested that statutes may be subjected to closer scrutiny in certain types of cases. Nevertheless, the federal courts have not departed from the principle that courts may only strike down statutes for unconstitutionality.

Of course, the practical implication of this principle is that a court cannot strike down a statute, even if it recognizes that the statute is obviously poorly drafted, irrational, or arises from legislators' corrupt motives, unless the flaw in the statute rises to the level of a clear constitutional violation. In 2008, Justice [[John Paul Stevens]] reaffirmed this point in a [[concurring opinion]]: "[A]s I recall my esteemed former colleague, [[Thurgood Marshall]], remarking on numerous occasions: 'The Constitution does not prohibit legislatures from enacting stupid laws.'"&lt;ref&gt;''New York State Bd. of Elections v. Lopez Torres'', 552 U.S. ___, ___ (2008) (Stevens, J., concurring).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the federal system, courts may only decide actual cases or controversies; it is not possible to request the federal courts to review a law without at least one party having [[legal standing]] to engage in a lawsuit. This principle means that courts sometimes do not exercise their power of review, even when a law is seemingly unconstitutional, for want of jurisdiction. In some state courts, such as the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]], legislation may be referred in certain circumstances by the legislature or by the executive for an [[advisory ruling]] on its constitutionality prior to its enactment (or enforcement).

The U.S. Supreme Court seeks to avoid reviewing the Constitutionality of an act where the case before it could be decided on other grounds, an attitude and practice exemplifying '''judicial restraint.''' Justice [[Louis Brandeis|Brandeis]] framed it thus (citations omitted):&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority]]'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?navby=case&amp;court=us&amp;vol=297&amp;invol=288 297 U.S. 288], 346–9 (1936) (Brandeis, concurring) (citing cases)&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The Court developed, for its own governance in the cases within its jurisdiction, a series of rules under which it has avoided passing upon a large part of all the constitutional questions pressed upon it for decision. They are:
# The Court will not pass upon the constitutionality of legislation in a friendly, non-adversary, proceeding, declining because to decide such questions is legitimate only in the last resort, and as a necessity in the determination of real, earnest, and vital controversy between individuals. It never was the thought that, by means of a friendly suit, a party beaten in the legislature could transfer to the courts an inquiry as to the constitutionality of the legislative act.
# The Court will not anticipate a question of constitutional law in advance of the necessity of deciding it. It is not the habit of the court to decide questions of a constitutional nature unless absolutely necessary to a decision of the case.
# The Court will not formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than required by the precise facts it applies to.
# The Court will not pass upon a constitutional question although properly presented by the record, if there is also present some other ground upon which the case may be disposed of ... If a case can be decided on either of two grounds, one involving a constitutional question, the other a question of statutory construction or general law, the Court will decide only the latter.
# The Court will not pass upon the validity of a statute upon complaint of one who fails to show that he is injured by its operation.
# The Court will not pass upon the constitutionality of a statute at the instance of one who has availed himself of its benefits.
# When the validity of an act of the Congress is drawn in question, and even if a serious doubt of constitutionality is raised, it is a cardinal principle that this Court will first ascertain whether a construction of the statute is fairly possible by which the question may be avoided.}}

==Laws limiting judicial review==

Although the Supreme Court continues to review the constitutionality of statutes, Congress and the states retain some power to influence what cases come before the Court. For example, the Constitution at Article III, Section 2, gives Congress power to make exceptions to the Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction. The Supreme Court has historically acknowledged that its appellate jurisdiction is defined by Congress, and thus Congress may have power to make some legislative or executive actions unreviewable. This is known as [[jurisdiction stripping]].

Another way for Congress to limit judicial review was tried in January 1868, when a bill was proposed requiring a two-thirds majority of the Court in order to deem any Act of Congress unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, Bernard.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=dE51nSQp-vMC&amp;pg=PA141&amp;dq=1868+two+thirds+vote+supreme+court+congress&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=8LjITbqiDcLTgAfdw8GBBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=1868%20two%20thirds%20vote%20supreme%20court%20congress&amp;f=false A History of the Supreme Court]'', page 141 (Oxford University Press US 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was approved by the House, 116 to 39.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, Edward.

==Administrative review==
The procedure for judicial review of federal administrative regulation in the United States is set forth by the [[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|Administrative Procedure Act]] although the courts have ruled such as in ''[[Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents]]''&lt;ref&gt;403 U.S. 388 (1971).&lt;/ref&gt; that a person may bring a case on the grounds of an [[implied cause of action]] when no statutory procedure exists.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7274">The '''law of obligations''' is one branch of [[private law]] under the [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] [[legal system]] and so-called "mixed" legal systems. It is the body of rules that organizes and regulates the rights and duties arising between individuals. The specific rights and duties are referred to as ''obligations'', and this area of law deals with their creation, effects and extinction.

An obligation is a legal bond (''vinculum iuris'') by which one or more parties (obligants) are bound to act or refrain from acting. An obligation thus imposes on the ''obligor'' a duty to perform, and simultaneously creates a corresponding right to demand performance by the ''obligee'' to whom performance is to be tendered.

==Definition==
[[Justinian_I|Justinian]] first defines an obligation (''obligatio'')&lt;ref&gt;Albanese, Bernardo. "Papimano e la definizione di obligatio in J, 3, 13, pr." (1984) 50 SDHI 166 sqq.&lt;/ref&gt; in his ''[[Institutes of Justinian|Institutiones]]'', Book 3, section 13 as "a legal bond, with which we are bound by necessity of performing some act according to the laws of our State."&lt;ref&gt;Justinian. "Institute." Trans. John B. Moyle. (Oxford: Oxford University Press. 1889) at 132&lt;/ref&gt; He further separates the law of obligations into [[contract]]s, [[delict]]s, [[quasi-contract]]s, and [[quasi-delict]]s.

Nowadays, obligation, as applied under civilian law, means a legal tie (''vinculum iuris'') by which one or more parties (obligants) are bound to perform or refrain from performing specified conduct (prestation).&lt;ref&gt;BAUDOUIN, J.-L., P.-G. JOBIN, &amp; N. VÉZINA, ''Les Obligations'', 6th edn. (Cowansville: Éditions Yvon Blais, 2005), 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus an obligation encompasses both sides of the equation, both the obligor's duty to render prestation and the obligee's right to receive prestation. It differs from the common-law concept of obligation which only encompasses the duty aspect.

Every obligation has four essential requisites otherwise known as the elements of obligation. They are:
# the '''[[wikt:obligor|obligor]]''': obligant duty-bound to fulfill the obligation; he who has a duty.
# the '''[[wikt:obligee|obligee]]''': obligant entitled to demand the fulfillment of the obligation; he who has a right.
# the subject matter, the '''prestation''': the performance to be tendered.
# a legal bond, the '''[[wikt:vinculum|vinculum]] juris''': the cause that binds or connects the obligants to the prestation.

==Classification==

===Sources===

Obligations arising out of the will of the parties are called ''voluntary'', and those imposed by operation of law are called ''involuntary''. Sometimes these are called conventional and obediential. The events giving rise to obligations may be further distinguished into specified categories.
* voluntary:
** unilateral promise (''pollicitatio'') - undertaking by promisor only to perform, not requiring the agreement of the beneficiary
** contract
** quasi-contract
*** ''[[negotiorum gestio]]'' - duty to repay someone (gestor) who has managed the affairs or property of another who was unable
*** ''solutio indebiti'' - undue payment or delivery of a thing to another, who is then obligated to return the thing
* involuntary:
** delicts and quasi-delicts (equivalent to the [[common law|common-law]] [[tort]]).
** [[unjust enrichment]] (''[[condictio indebiti]]'')

====Contracts====
{{see also|Contract}}
A contract can be broadly defined as an agreement that is enforceable at law. [[Gaius (jurist)|Gaius]] classified contracts into four categories which are: contracts ''[[Obligatio consensu|consensu]]'', verbal contracts, contracts ''[[Real contracts in Roman law|re]]'', and contracts ''[[Literal contracts in Roman law|litteris]]''. But this classification cannot cover all the contracts, such as pacts and innominate contracts; thus, it is no longer used.

====Quasi-contracts====
Quasi-contract is one of the four categories of obligation in Justinian's classification. The main cases are ''negotiorum gestio'' (conducting of another person's affairs without their authorisation), unjust enrichment, and ''solutio indebiti''.

====Quasi-delicts====
The designation comprised a group of actions of no obvious similarity, classified by Justinian as analogous to delictual obligations. It includes ''res suspensae'', things po
ured or thrown, shippers/innkeepers/stablekeepers, and erring judges.

===Subject matter===

Obligations are classified according to the nature of the performance (prestation):
* real obligations - undertakings to give or deliver property, possession, or enjoyment &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legal-glossary.org/real-obligation/ |title=Legal definition of Real obligation |publisher=legal-glossary.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** specific real obligation - delivery of a determinate thing when it is particularly designated or physically separated from all others of the same class
** generic real obligation - delivery of a generic thing
* personal obligations - undertakings either to do or not do all kinds of work or service
** positive personal obligation - performance
** negative personal obligation - forbearance

==History==
The word originally derives from the Latin "obligare" which comes from the root "lig" which suggests being bound, as one is to God for instance in "re-ligio".&lt;ref&gt;Zimmermann, Reinhard. “The Law of Obligations: Roman Foundations of the Civilian Tradition” (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996) at 1&lt;/ref&gt; This term first appears in Plautus' play [[Truculentus]] at line 214.

Obligations did not originally form part of [[Roman Law]], which mostly concerned issues of succession, property, and family relationships. It developed as a solution to a gap in the system, when one party committed a [[wrong]] against another party. These situations were originally governed by a basic customary law of revenge.&lt;ref&gt;see for example: Exodus 21.23-25&lt;/ref&gt; This undesirable situation eventually developed into a system of liability where people were at first encouraged and then essentially forced to accept monetary compensation from the wrongdoer or their family instead of seeking vengeance. This signaled an important shift in the law away from vengeance and towards compensation. The state supported this effort by standardizing amounts for certain wrongs. Thus the earliest form of Obligation law derives out of what we would today call Delict.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmermann, at 2-3&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is important to note that liability in this form did not yet include the idea that the debtor "owed" monetary compensation to the creditor, it was merely a means of avoiding punishment. If the debtor or his family didn't have the means to pay then the old rules still applied as outlined in the [[twelve tables]] specifically table 3.&lt;ref&gt;XII tables, specifically Table III "Debt"&lt;/ref&gt; This section, despite how harsh it may appear to us, was originally developed as a means to protect debtors from the excessive abuses of creditors.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmermann, at 3&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6587">A '''legal doublet''' is a standardized [[phrase]] used frequently in English [[legal language]] consisting of two or more words that are near [[synonym]]s. The origin of the doubling—and sometimes even tripling—often lies in the transition from use of one language for legal purposes to use of another for the same purposes, as from a [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] ([Anglo-]Saxon or Old English) term to a [[Romance languages|Romance]] (Latin or Law French) term or, within the Romance subfamily, from a [[Latin language|Latin]] term to a [[Law French]] term.  To ensure understanding, words of Germanic origin were often paired with words having equivalent or near-equivalent meanings in Latin (reflecting the interactions between Germanic and Roman law following the decline of the [[Roman Empire]]) or, later, Law French (reflecting the influence of the [[Norman Conquest]]), and words of Latin origin were often paired with their Law French cognates or outright descendants. Such phrases can often be [[pleonasm]]s&lt;ref name="Espenschied"&gt;{{cite book |last=Espenschied |first=Lenné Eidson |title=Contract Drafting: Powerful Prose in Transactional Practice |series=ABA Fundamentals |date=2010 |publisher=American Bar Association |location=Chicago |isbn=978-1-60442-795-0 |pages=164–165 |chapter=10.1 Eliminate clutter and redundant language § Eliminate common doublets and triplets |lccn=2010003298 |oclc=505017586 |ol=15443452W |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NRNUshLwjMgC&amp;pg=PA164}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Siamese twins (linguistics)|Siamese twins]]. In other cases, the two components did not arise through such synonym annotation but rather referred to two differentiable ideas whose differentiation is subtle, appreciable only to lawyers, long since obsolete, or a combination of those. For example, ''[[ways and means committee|ways and means]]'', referring to methods and resources respectively,&lt;ref name="AHD"&gt;{{Citation |author=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |url=https://ahdictionary.com/ |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; are differentiable, in the same way that ''tools and materials'', or ''equipment and funds'', are differentiable—but the difference between them is often practically irrelevant to the contexts in which the Siamese twin ''ways and means'' is used today in non-legal contexts as a mere [[cliché]] where one word would do (for example, "methods"), and because each of the words can practically mean "methods", the second can seem redundant in the clichéd, non-legal instances.

'''Margaret Gilbert''' (born 1942) is a British philosopher best known for her work in the philosophy of social science, and, more specifically, for her founding contributions to the analytic philosophy of social phenomena. She has also made substantial contributions to other philosophical fields including political philosophy, the philosophy of law, and in ethics. 

==Life==
Gilbert was born in the United Kingdom and obtained a "double first" B.A. degree in Classics and Philosophy from [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] and a B.Phil. and D.Phil. degree in Philosophy from [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanities.uci.edu/SOH/about/press_release_det.php?id=983|title=Focusing on Rights: An Interview with Margaret Gilbert|accessdate=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1983 until 2006, she taught at the [[University of Connecticut, Storrs]], where she was Professor of Philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philosophy.uconn.edu/department/gilbert/gilbert.html|title=Margaret Gilbert Professor of Philosophy|accessdate=28 January 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809192632/http://www.philosophy.uconn.edu/department/gilbert/gilbert.html|archivedate=9 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of Fall 2006, she holds the Abraham I. Melden Chair in Moral Philosophy at the [[University of California, Irvine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.faculty.uci.edu/profile.cfm?faculty_id=5365|title=Faculty profile at the University of California, Irvine|accessdate=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has been a visiting teacher and researcher at many academic institutions including [[Princeton University]], the [[Institute for Advanced Study]], the [[University of Pennsylvania]], [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana University]], [[Wolfson College, Oxford]], [[Technische Universität Dresden]], [[King's College London]], and the [[Swedish Collegium for Advanced Study in the Social Sciences]], and regularly gives invited lectures in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere. Gilbert was married to noted philosopher [[Saul Kripke]] and is the sister of famed British historian Sir [[Martin Gilbert]].  In 2016, Margaret Gilbert was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amacad.org/content/members/newFellows.aspx?s=c&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
In her book ''On Social Facts'' (1989) Gilbert presented novel accounts of a number of central social phenomena in the context of critical reflections on proposals by the founders of sociology [[Émile Durkheim]], [[Georg Simmel]], and [[Max Weber]] and others, including the philosopher [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]]. The phenomena discussed include social conventions, social groups in a central sense of the term, group languages, [[collective belief]], and acting together. Gilbert argued that these were all 'plural subject phenomena'.&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/convention/#GilPluSub&lt;/ref&gt; In a summary passage she writes, with allusion to [[Rousseau]], that "One is willing to be the member of a plural subject if one is willing, at least in relation to certain conditions, to put one's own will into a 'pool of wills' dedicated, as one, to a single goal (or whatever it is that the pool is dedicated to)" (18). If two or more people have openly expressed such willingness in relation to a particular goal, in conditions of common knowledge, then the pertinent pool of wills is set up. In other words, the people concerned constitute the plural subject of the goal. As an alternative to talking of a pool of wills Gilbert refers also to joint commitment as when she writes: " the wills of the parties are jointly committed" (198). In later work she has preferred the language of joint commitment. Gilbert compares the plural subject to the singular subject and argues, with allusion to [[Durkheim]], that "In order for individual human beings to form collectivities, they must take on a special character, a 'new' character, insofar as they need not, ''qua'' human beings, have that character. Moreover, humans must form a whole or unit of a special kind...a plural subject" (431).

In subsequent writings Gilbert has continued the development and application of her plural subject theory. Each of the essay collections ''Living Together'' (1996), ''Sociality and Responsibility'' (2000) and ''Marcher Ensemble'' (in French) (2003) is composed of relevant papers authored by Gilbert.

In her book ''A Theory of Political Obligation'' (2006; 2008) Gilbert offers a new perspective on a classical problem in political philosophy, generally known as 'the' problem of political obligation. As Gilbert makes clear in her book, there are many versions of this problem. She addresses the question whether there is something about one's being the member of a particular society that means one is obligated to uphold the political institutions of that society. Unlike most contemporary writers on the subject, she does not insist that the obligation in question is a matter of moral requirement. Gilbert argues that there are obligations of a different sort, and that these that are a function of membership in a political society construed as membership in a particular kind of plural subject constituted, as are all plural subjects, by a joint commitment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/political-obligation/|title=See sections 2.3, 4.1, and 5 of 'Political Obligation'|accessdate=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other topics Gilbert has addressed in one or more of her publications include agreements and promises, authority, collective emotions, collective responsibility, personal decisions and intentions, marital love, mutual recognition, patriotism, rights (in particular claim-rights), shared attention, shared values, social rules, and social unity.

Gilbert's essay collection ''Joint Commitment'' (2014) contains eighteen recent papers that together address most of the topics in the above list along with several others that Gilbert argues can be illuminated by an appeal to joint commitment.

The declaration has been widely welcomed. Some commentators called for consistent legal and practical follow through of the sentiments expressed including in the country where the declaration was forged, which does not recognise its own indigenous Christians and persecutes and imprisons them,&lt;ref name=Ibrahim&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religionnews.com/2016/02/01/history-suggests-marrakesh-declaration-no-guarantee-religious-freedom-commentary/ |title=History suggests Marrakesh Declaration no guarantee of religious freedom |last=Ibrahim |first=Ayman |date=1 February 2016 |publisher=[[Religion News Service]] |language=English |accessdate=2 February 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6f0Ie8tSk?url=http://www.religionnews.com/2016/02/01/history-suggests-marrakesh-declaration-no-guarantee-religious-freedom-commentary/ |archive-date=2 February 2016 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=index&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.persecution.org/awareness/persecuted-countries/morocco |title=Country profile Morocco from International Christian Concern |publisher=International Christian Concern |language=English |accessdate=2 February 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6f0YWJuEk?url=http://www.persecution.org/awareness/persecuted-countries/morocco |archive-date=3 February 2016 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or in the [[Freedom of religion in Saudi Arabia| birthplace of Islam]], where there are reportedly many Saudi Christians.&lt;ref name= Ibrahim/&gt;

The UN Framework of Analysis for Atrocity Crimes recognizes that the 1949 Geneva Conference protects four groups of people in armed conflict:
#The wounded and sick in armed forces in the field;
# The wounded, sick and shipwrecked members of armed forces at sea;
# Prisoners of war;
# Civilian persons.&lt;ref name=prevention /&gt;
Individuals protected underneath the 1977 Additional Protocol I and II are also protected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/Article.xsp?action=openDocument&amp;documentId=6C86520D7EFAD527C12563CD0051D63C|title=ICRC databases on international humanitarian law|date=2010-03-23|website=www.icrc.org|language=en-us|access-date=2016-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Crime of Aggression ==

''See also:''  ''[[Crime of Aggression]]''

Adopted by the Assembly of States Parties during the Review Conference of the Rome Statute, held
in ''[[Kampala, Uganda]]'' between May 31 and June 11, 2010, the “crime of aggression” is the planned,
preparation, initiation, or execution of the use of armed force by a State against the sovereignty,
territorial integrity or political independence of another State.

The act of aggression includes, invasion, military occupation, and annexation by the use of force, blockade of the ports or coasts, if it is considered being, by its character, gravity and scale, a manifest violation of the Charter of the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| title=Understanding the International Criminal Court
| page=14 
| url=https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/PIDS/publications/UICCEng.pdf
| publisher=International Criminal Court
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Moment, the [[International Criminal Court]] has no jurisdiction over the Crime of Aggression.  On January 1, 2017 the International Criminal Court will vote on Jurisdiction.

== Legal Jurisdiction ==

=== International Criminal Court ===
''See also:'' ''[[International Criminal Court]]''

The International Criminal Court (ICC) only has jurisdiction over those who have violated any of the Mass Atrocity Crimes (the Crime of Aggression will officially become a criminal offense that can be tried at the ICC starting January 1, 2017).  Though the Court itself is not officially affiliated with the United Nations, the Security Council can submit a request for an investigation to be opened by the ICC.  In order for the International Criminal Court to take a case, the state must be a signed member of the Rome Statute, as this puts a country within the jurisdiction of the Court.  However, if the perpetrator is tried at a National level court, the ICC does not handle the case.

=== Nuremberg Trials ===
''See also:''  ''[[Nuremberg trials]]''

Prior to the publication of the Rome Statute and the formation of the International Criminal Court, violators of the different Atrocity Crimes would be brought to justice through international tribunal, Nuremberg was the first such example of these tribunals.  Held as an International Military Tribunal (IMT) for the Nazis, Nuremberg became the first ever trial in which Crimes Against Humanity had been held as a charge (they could not be charged with the crime of genocide, as it did not exist at the time).  Of the 24 Nazi officials charged, 16 of them were found guilty of Crimes Against Humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== ICTR &amp; ICTY ===
''See also:'' ''[[ICTR]]'' &amp; ''[[ICTY]]''

The '''International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY)''' is the United Nations court established in 1993 to prosecute atrocity crimes committed in the Balkans in the 1990s. It addresses crimes committed from 1991 to 2001 against members of various ethnic groups in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Kosovo and Macedonia. This was the first war crimes court established by the UN as well as the first international war crimes tribunal since the Nurenberg and Tokyo tribunals. It was established in accordance with Chapter VII of the UN Charter. The tribunal is located in The Hague, Netherlands. Since its inception, the ICTY has made precedent-setting decisions on atrocity crimes in that an individual's position does not protect them from prosecution. It has also set the precedent for individualized guilt in order to protect entire communities from being labelled "collectively responsible." It has proven that the mass murder at Srebrenica was genocide as defined by international law. The ICTY has indicted over 160 individuals. It is still operating in full capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/en/about|title=About the ICTY | publisher= International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia| access-date=2016-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The I'''nternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/StatuteInternationalCriminalTribunalForRwanda.aspx International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Genocide and Other Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of Rwanda and Rwandan Citizens Responsible for Genocide and Other Such Violations Committed in the Territory of Neighbouring States, between 1 January 1994 and 31 December 1994], [[French language|French]]: ''"''Tribunal pénal international pour le Rwanda ''(''TPIR'')"''. [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]].&lt;/ref&gt; '''(ICTR)''' is an international court established by the [[United Nations Security Council]] to prosecute individuals of genocide and other mass atrocity crimes committed in Rwanda and neighboring states between the dates of 1 January 1994 and 31 December 1994. The tribunal is located in Arusha, Tanzania. The ICTR is the first international tribunal to deliver verdicts of genocide and the first to interpret the definition of genocide.It is also the first tribunal to define rape as a means of committing genocide as well as to hold members of media responsible for broadcasts as a tool of genocide. The ICTR's last trial judgement was on 20 December 2012 and is currently only working on appeals. Since it opened in 1995, 93 individuals have been indicted by the ICTR, 61 have been found guilty of international humanitarian crimes and sentenced, 10 have been referred to national jurisdictions, 3 individuals died prior to verdicts, 3 fugitives have been referred to the MICT and 2 indictments were withdrawn before their trials started.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unictr.unmict.org/en/tribunal|title=The ICTR in Brief {{!}} United Nations International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda|website=unictr.unmict.org|access-date=2016-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Responsibility to Protect (R2P) ===
At the 2005 World Summit, the United Nations member states made a commitment to protect against genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity (This document extended the definition of atrocity crimes to include ethnic cleansing).&lt;ref&gt;[http://responsibilitytoprotect.org/world%20summit%20outcome%20doc%202005%281%29.pdf United Nations General Assembly, 60th session | 2005 World Summit Outcome (A/60/L.1)], 31-2. 15 September 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; This document is not law, but rather holds all states responsible to protect their own populations from atrocity crimes and additionally holds the international community responsible for holding states' accountable for their populations. In accordance with Chapters VI, VII, and VIII of the Charter, the United Nations acknowledges its responsibility to help protect all populations through peaceful means, as well as through collective action when necessary.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7899">A '''Notice of Intent to Revoke''' ('''NOIR''') is a communication sent by the [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]] to a petitioner about a previously approved petition, telling him or her that the USCIS intends to revoke the petition, along with the reasons for revocation, and giving the petitioner a fixed amount of time to respond.&lt;ref name=uscis&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.uscis.gov/unassigned/immigrant-visa-petitions-returned-state-department-consular-offices|title = Immigrant Visa Petitions Returned by the State Department Consular Offices|publisher = [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]]|accessdate = January 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; NOIRs may be issued for immigrant visa petitions (such as [[Form I-130]] and [[Form I-140]])&lt;ref name=uscis/&gt; and for non-immigrant visa petitions (such as [[Form I-129]] and [[Form I-129F]]).&lt;ref name=lawandborder-consular/&gt;

== Response protocol ==

The NOIR is sent to, and the response must be sent by, the petitioner (or an attorney representing the petitioner, if the petitioner is using an attorney) rather than the beneficiary. A copy may be sent to the beneficiary for information.

If the petitioner responds within the specified time, then the petitioner's response is considered when making a final decision on whether to revoke the petition. Otherwise, the petition is revoked once the specified time is over. An extension may be granted at the discretion of USCIS if the petitioner needs additional time to obtain documentation from abroad or for other meritorious reasons; however, the petitioner ''must'' respond in a timely manner to the NOIR by the stated deadline, and provide a reason for requesting the extra time.&lt;ref name=uscis/&gt;

== Steps ==

=== The petition is returned for revocation/revalidation (usually by a consular officer) ===

The NOIR is generally issued when new evidence is presented to the USCIS suggesting that the petition was approved in error (i.e., it should not have been approved) ''or'' there has been a change in circumstances making the petition no longer approvable. The most common impetus for issuing a NOIR is that a consular officer (an employee of the [[United States Department of State]]) evaluating the beneficiary's visa application based on an approved petition comes across evidence suggesting that the petition should not have been approved, or is no longer approvable.&lt;ref name=uscis/&gt; The consular officer issues a Section 221(g) quasi-refusal to the visa applicant, and returns the petition to USCIS for revocation/revalidation, along with the reasons the consular officer believes the petition should not have been approved or is no longer approvable.&lt;ref name=uscis/&gt; Petitions relating to non-immigrant visas (such as [[Form I-129]] and [[Form I-129F]]) are returned to the Kentucky Service Center whereas petitions related to immigrant visas (such as [[Form I-130]] and [[Form I-140]]) are returned to the [[National Visa Center]].&lt;ref name=lawandborder-consular/&gt;

=== The USCIS forwards the petition to the original Service Center and updates the case status ===

The returned petition is sent to the Service Center where the original petition was processed and a USCIS officer is assigned with the task of re-adjudicating the petition in light of the reasons for returning it. Information about the petition is updated in the USCIS system so that it is reflected in the Case Status Online as well as available to the [[National Customer Service Center]]. The petitioner is also notified of the petition being returned.&lt;ref name=lawandborder-consular/&gt;&lt;ref name=dhs-recommendations/&gt;

=== After an initial re-adjudication, the USCIS revalidates the petition, issues a NOIR, or issues a Notice of Automatic Revocation ===

After re-adjudicating the petition, the USCIS may either refuse to take any revocation action, issue a NOIR, or issue a Notice of Automatic Revocation.&lt;ref name=uscis/&gt;&lt;ref name=lawandborder-consular&gt;{{cite web|url = http://lawandborder.com/update-consular-recommendations-to-revoke-visa-petitions/|title = Update: Consular Recommendations to Revoke Visa Petitions|publisher = U.S. &amp; China Visa Law Blog|last = Chodorow|first = Gary|date = July 17, 2008|accessdate = January 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dhs-recommendations&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/cisomb_Recommendation33_aug_24_07.pdf|title = Recommendations on the Processing of Petitions that are Returned by the U.S. Department of State for Revocation/Revalidation|date = August 24, 2007|accessdate = January 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the USCIS revalidates the petition (either directly, or after receiving additional information from the petitioner in response to the NOID), then the same visa application can be resumed with the new information.

=== After receiving the petitioner's response to the NOIR, the USCIS officer makes an adjudication decision ===

After receiving the response from the petitioner, the USCIS officer decides whether to revalidate the petition or revoke it. If the USCIS revokes the petition, the corresponding visa application is definitively denied. If the USCIS revalidates the petition, the information is sent back to the consular officer who should then continue processing the original visa application.

== Processing timeline and uncertainty ==

In 2007, Prakash Khatri, the USCIS ombudsman, sought comments from petitioners and beneficiaries on how to improve the system surrounding consular returns of petitions. The chief complaint by petitioners and beneficiaries was the lack of transparency about what was going on between the time the consular officer returned the petition to the USCIS and the USCIS issuing a NOIR, and this uncertainty often led to the filing of multiple duplicate petitions, thereby increasing costs for petitioners and creating an unnecessary caseload for the USCIS. The following recommendations were made:&lt;ref name=dhs-recommendations/&gt;&lt;ref name=lawandborder-consular/&gt;

* Issue receipt notices to customers when the petition file is returned and received by USCIS Service Centers: The USCIS agreed to this recommendation, and also promised to update the Case Status Online and the [[National Customer Service Center]] to reflect the information.
* Establish a nationwide standard for the re-adjudication of petitions returned by consular offices for revocation or revalidation and amends the Operating Instructions/Adjudicator's Field Manual accordingly; include a "REVOCATION" entry in the processing time reports: The USCIS declined to do this, stating that processing times for returned petitions varied widely because of the possibility of a lengthy fraud investigation.
* Provide additional information about revocation or revalidation processes on the USCIS website: USCIS agreed to do so but did not immediately make changes to the website.

== Relationship with RFE and NOID ==

There are two other kinds of communication that the USCIS uses for petitions: the [[Request For Evidence]] (RFE) and the [[Notice of Intent to Deny]] (NOID). The RFE and NOID differ from the NOIR in one important respect: the RFE and NOID are used for petitions still being adjudicated (i.e., ones that have not yet been approved) whereas the NOIR is used for petitions that have been approved.

In particular, even after the NOIR is issued, the corresponding petition is still considered approved right until the point when it is revoked.

Another difference between NOIRs and the other two is that there are no standard processing timelines for how much time it should take between receiving a returned petition and issuing a NOIR, but there are guidelines on standard processing times for the "initial review" that should end in approval, denial, RFE, or NOID.&lt;ref name=lawandborder-consular/&gt;&lt;ref name=dhs-recommendations/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2501">'''Partnership taxation''' in [[Hong Kong]] is the taxation of the profits or losses generated by [[Partnership (Hong Kong)|partnership business entities]].  First, these profits or losses of the partnership are assessed according to the [http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/112/s22.html Hong Kong Inland Revenue Ordinance, Chapter 112, section 22.]  After assessment, then said profits or losses [[flow-through entity|flow through]] the partnership to the partners who are then taxed on their share of said profits or losses generated by the partnership without any taxes levied against the partnership.

==Assessment of Partnership==
The profits or losses of the partnership are assessed in one lump sum by the [[managing partner]] or [[Agent (law)|agent]]. &lt;ref name="hklii.org"&gt;[http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/112/s22.html Inland Revenue Ordinance, Chapter 112, section 22]&lt;/ref&gt;  The tax may be recoverable from the assets of the partnership or the partners directly even if the partnership has [[winding up|dissolved]].&lt;ref name="hklii.org"/&gt;

==Partner's share==
A partner is taxed according his or her share of the profits or losses generated by the partnership excluding partnership losses brought forward under [http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/112/s19c.html section 19C].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/112/s22a.html Hong Kong Inland Revenue Ordinance, Chapter 112, section 22A]&lt;/ref&gt;

The partner's share in this partnership is governed by [http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/112/s22b.html Inland Revenue Ordinance, Chapter 112, section 22B.]  Said partner's share equals to the sum of contributions made to the partnership as capital less distributions or constructive distributions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/112/s22b.html Hong Kong Inland Revenue Ordinance, Chapter 112, section 22B(2)]&lt;/ref&gt;  Such contributions may also include the partner's share of the profits plowed back into the partnership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/112/s22b.html Hong Kong Inland Revenue Ordinance, Chapter 112, section 22B(2)]&lt;/ref&gt;  The partner's share is then added to the remaining partners to determine the proportionate share amendable also by any [[partnership agreement]].

'''Peat''' ({{IPAc-en|p|iː|t}}), also known as '''turf''' ({{IPAc-en|t|ɜːr|f}}), is an accumulation of partially [[Decomposition|decayed]] [[vegetation]] or organic matter. It is unique to natural areas called [[peatland]]s, [[bog]]s, [[mire]]s, [[Moorland|moors,]] or [[muskeg]]s.&lt;ref name=Joosten_Clarke2002&gt;{{cite report|title=Wise Use of Mires and Peatlands: Background and Principles including a Framework for Decision-Making|first1=Hans|last1=Joosten|first2=Donal |last2=Clarke|url=http://www.gret-perg.ulaval.ca/fileadmin/fichiers/fichiersGRET/pdf/Doc_generale/WUMP_Wise_Use_of_Mires_and_Peatlands_book.pdf|format=PDF|isbn=951-97744-8-3|location=Totnes, Devon|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PERG2013"&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.gret-perg.ulaval.ca/uploads/tx_centrerecherche/Tree_Plantation_guide.pdf|title=Tree plantations within the context of ecological restoration of peatlands: practical guide|last1=Hugron|first1=Sandrine|last2=Bussières|first2=Julie|date=|publisher=Peatland Ecology Research Group (PERG)|issue=|doi=|location=Laval, Québec, Canada|volume=|pmid=|last3=Rochefort|first3=Line|accessdate=22 February 2014|format=PDF|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The peatland ecosystem is the most efficient [[carbon sink]] on the planet,&lt;ref name=PERG2013 /&gt; because peatland plants capture [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] naturally released from the peat, maintaining an equilibrium. In natural peatlands, the "annual rate of biomass production is greater than the rate of decomposition", but it takes "thousands of years for peatlands to develop the deposits of {{cvt|1.5|to|2.3|m|ft|disp=sqbr}}, which is the average depth of the boreal [northern] peatlands".&lt;ref name=PERG2013 /&gt; ''[[Sphagnum]]'' moss, also called peat moss, is one of the most common components in peat, although many other plants can contribute. Soils consisting primarily of peat are known as [[histosol]]s. Peat forms in [[wetland]] conditions, where flooding obstructs the flow of oxygen from the atmosphere, slowing the rate of decomposition.&lt;ref&gt;Keddy, P.A. 2010. Wetland Ecology: Principles and Conservation (2nd edition). Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK. 497 p. Chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Peatlands, particularly [[bog]]s, are the primary source of peat,&lt;ref name="Gorham, E. 1957"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gorham | first1 = E | year = 1957 | title = The development of peatlands | url = | journal = Quarterly Review of Biology | volume = 32 | issue = | pages = 145–66 | doi=10.1086/401755}}&lt;/ref&gt;
although less-common wetlands including [[fen]]s, [[pocosin]]s, and [[peat swamp forest]]s also deposit peat. Landscapes covered in peat are home to specific kinds of plants including ''Sphagnum'' moss, [[Ericaceae|ericaceous]] shrubs, and [[sedges]] (see [[bog]] for more information on this aspect of peat). Because organic matter accumulates over thousands of years, peat deposits provide records of past vegetation and climate by preserving plant remains, such as pollen. This allows humans to reconstruct past environments and study changes in human land use.&lt;ref&gt;Keddy, P.A. 2010. Wetland Ecology: Principles and Conservation (2nd edition). Cambridge University Press, Cambridge. 497 pp. 323–25&lt;/ref&gt;

Peat is harvested as an important source of [[fuel]] in certain parts of the world. By volume, there are about {{convert|4|e12m3|e12cuyd|abbr=off}} of peat in the world, covering a total of around 2% of the global land area (about {{convert|3|e6km2|e6sqmi|abbr=off|disp=or}}), containing about 8&amp;nbsp;billion [[terajoule]]s of energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldenergy.org/documents/ser2007_executive_summary.pdf |title=Survey of Energy Resources 2007 |accessdate=2008-08-11 |author=World Energy Council |year=2007 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910214607/http://www.worldenergy.org/documents/ser2007_executive_summary.pdf |archivedate=2008-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, the formation of peat is often the first step in the geological formation of other [[fossil fuel]]s such as [[coal]], particularly low-grade coal such as [[lignite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2013/02/18/3691317.htm#.UbZSEUDVDTc |title= Is coal still being formed today? |publisher= |accessdate= 25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the agency, peat is not generally regarded as a [[Renewable energy|renewable source of energy]], due to its extraction rate in industrialized countries far exceeding its slow regrowth rate of 1mm per year,&lt;ref name="Keddy, P.A 2010"/&gt; and as it is also reported that peat regrowth takes place only in 30-40% of peatlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurosaiwgea.org/Activitiesandmeetings/OtherEUROSAIWGEAmeetings/Documents/Estonia_energy.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121175926/http://www.eurosaiwgea.org/Activitiesandmeetings/OtherEUROSAIWGEAmeetings/Documents/Estonia_energy.pdf |archivedate=2013-01-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, the [[UNFCCC]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seai.ie/Archive1/Files_Misc/IEABioenergyAgreementTask38CaseStudy.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104202934/http://www.seai.ie/Archive1/Files_Misc/IEABioenergyAgreementTask38CaseStudy.pdf |archivedate=2013-11-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and another organization affiliated with the [[United Nations]] classified peat as a [[fossil fuel]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.un-documents.net/ocf-07.htm Today's primary sources of energy are mainly non-renewable: natural gas, oil, coal, peat, and conventional nuclear power. There are also renewable sources, including wood, plants, dung, falling water, geothermal sources, solar, tidal, wind, and wave energy, as well as human and animal muscle-power. Nuclear reactors that produce their own fuel ("breeders") and eventually fusion reactors are also in this category.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) has begun to classify peat as a "slow-renewable" fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldenergy.org/publications/survey_of_energy_resources_2007/peat/704.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104212157/http://www.worldenergy.org/publications/survey_of_energy_resources_2007/peat/704.asp |archivedate=2013-11-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also the classification used by many in the peat industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seai.ie/Archive1/Files_Misc/IEABioenergyAgreementTask38CaseStudy.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104202934/http://www.seai.ie/Archive1/Files_Misc/IEABioenergyAgreementTask38CaseStudy.pdf |archivedate=2013-11-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  At 106&amp;nbsp;g&amp;nbsp;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/[[Joule|MJ]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imcg.net/imcgnl/nl0702/kap05.htm The CO2 emission factor of peat fuel] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707134451/http://www.imcg.net/imcgnl/nl0702/kap05.htm |date=2010-07-07 }}.

Retrieved on 2011-05-09.&lt;/ref&gt; the carbon dioxide [[emission intensity]] of peat is higher than that of coal (at 94.6&amp;nbsp;g&amp;nbsp;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/MJ) and [[natural gas]] (at 56.1) (IPCC).

==Formation==
Peat forms when plant material does not fully decay in acidic and anaerobic conditions. It is composed mainly of wetland vegetation: principally bog plants including mosses, sedges, and shrubs. As it accumulates, the peat holds water. This slowly creates wetter conditions that allow the area of wetland to expand. Peatland features can include ponds, ridges, and raised bogs.&lt;!-- more information on this process, refer to [[wetland]] in general and [[bog]] in particular --&gt;&lt;ref name="Gorham, E. 1957" /&gt;

Most modern peat bogs formed 12,000 years ago in high latitudes after the glaciers retreated at the end of the [[Last glacial period|last ice age]].&lt;ref&gt;Vitt, D.H., L.A. Halsey and B.J. Nicholson. 2005. The Mackenzie River basin. pp. 166–202 in L.H. Fraser and P.A. Keddy (eds.). The World’s Largest Wetlands: Ecology and Conservation. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge. 488 p.&lt;/ref&gt; Peat usually accumulates slowly at the rate of about a millimetre per year.&lt;ref name="Keddy, P.A 2010"&gt;Keddy, P.A. 2010. Wetland Ecology: Principles and Conservation (2nd edition). Cambridge University Press, UK. Cambridge. 497 p. Chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of peat material==
Peat material is either fibric, hemic, or sapric. Fibric peats are the least decomposed and consist of intact fibre. Hemic peats are partially decomposed and sapric are the most decomposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/x5872e/x5872e07.htm|title=5. CLASSIFICATION|website=www.fao.org|access-date=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Phragmites]]'' peat are composed of reed grass, ''Phragmites australis'', and other grasses. It is denser than many other types of peat.

Engineers may describe a soil as peat which has a relatively high percentage of organic material. This soil is problematic because it exhibits poor [[Consolidation (soil)|consolidation]] properties – it cannot be easily compacted to serve as a stable foundation to support loads, such as roads or buildings.

== Peatlands distribution ==
In a widely cited article, Joosten and Clarke (2002) defined peatlands or mires (which they claim are the same)&lt;ref group="Notes"&gt;Supported by the "Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs (DGIS) under the [www.wetlands.org/projects/GPI/default.htm Global Peatland Initiative], managed by Wetlands International in co-operation with the IUCN – Netherlands Committee, Alterra, the International Mire Conservation Group and the International Peatland Society."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Joosten_Clarke2002 /&gt; as,

{{quote|source=|...the most widespread of all wetland types in the world, representing 50 to 70% of global wetlands. They cover over {{convert|4|e6km2|e6sqmi |abbr=off |disp=sqbr}} or 3% of the land and freshwater surface of the planet. In these ecosystems are found one third of the world’s soil carbon and 10% of global freshwater resources. These ecosystems are characterized by the unique ability to accumulate and store dead organic matter from Sphagnum and many other non-moss species, as peat, under conditions of almost permanent water saturation. Peatlands are adapted to the extreme conditions of high water and low oxygen content, of toxic elements and low availability of plant nutrients. Their water chemistry varies from alkaline to acidic. Peatlands occur on all continents, from the tropical to boreal and Arctic zones from sea level to high alpine conditions.|Joosten and Clarke 2002}}

Peatlands are areas of land with naturally formed layers of peat. They can be found in at least 175 countries and cover around 4 million square kilometres (1.5 million square miles); that is 3% of the world’s land area. In Europe, peatlands extend to about {{cvt|515,000|km2}}.&lt;ref name="IUCNFull"&gt;[http://www.iucn-uk-peatlandprogramme.org/sites/all/files/IUCN%20UK%20Commission%20of%20Inquiry%20on%20Peatlands%20Full%20Report%20spv%20web.pdf IUCN UK Commission of Inquiry on Peatlands] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307180047/http://www.iucn-uk-peatlandprogramme.org/sites/all/files/IUCN%20UK%20Commission%20of%20Inquiry%20on%20Peatlands%20Full%20Report%20spv%20web.pdf |date=2014-03-07 }} Full Report, IUCN UK Peatland Programme October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; About 60% of the world's [[wetland]]s are made of peat.

Peat deposits are found in many places around the world, including northern Europe and North America. The North American peat deposits are principally found in Canada and the Northern United States. Some of the world's largest peatlands include the [[West Siberian taiga|West Siberian Lowland]], the [[Hudson Bay Lowlands]], and the [[Mackenzie River]] Valley.&lt;ref name="Fraser, L.H 2005"&gt;Fraser, L.H.

The World’s Largest Wetlands: Ecology and Conservation. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK. 488 p.&lt;/ref&gt;
There is less peat in the Southern Hemisphere, in part because there is less land. That said, the vast [[Magellanic subpolar forests#Flora|Magellanic Moorland]] in South America (Southern [[Patagonia]]/[[Tierra del Fuego]]) is an extensive peat-dominated landscape.&lt;ref name="Fraser, L.H 2005"/&gt; Peat can be found in [[New Zealand]], [[Kerguelen Islands|Kerguelen]], the [[Falkland Islands]], and [[Indonesia]] ([[Kalimantan]] [Sungai Putri, Danau Siawan, Sungai Tolak], Rasau Jaya [West Kalimantan], and Sumatra). Indonesia has more tropical peatlands and mangrove forests than any other nation on earth, but Indonesia is losing wetlands by {{convert|100,000|hectare}} per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://waspada.co.id/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=193680:us-ri-discuss-future-of-peat-land-mangroves&amp;catid=30:english-news&amp;Itemid=101|title=Waspada Online|work=Waspada Online|accessdate=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 7% of all peatlands have been exploited for [[agriculture]] and [[forestry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.volcanowoodfuels.co.uk/sitefiles/37/5/6/375680/WER_2013_6_Peat.pdf|title=World Energy Resources: Peat – World Energy Council 2013|website=Volcano Wood Fuels|publisher=World Energy Council|accessdate=2016-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under proper conditions, peat will turn into [[lignite]] coal over geologic periods of time.

==General characteristics and uses==

[[File:Feu de tourbe.JPG|thumb|Peat fire]]

Under pressure, water is forced out of peat, which is soft and easily compressed, and once dry can be used as fuel. In many countries, including [[Ireland]] and [[Scotland]], peat has traditionally been used for cooking and domestic heating, and peat is stacked to dry in rural areas. It remains harvested on an industrial scale for this purpose in countries such as Ireland and Finland. Its insulating properties make it useful in industry.

Although humans have many uses for peat, it presents severe problems at times. Wet or dry, it can be a major fire hazard. Peat fires may burn for great lengths of time, or smoulder underground and reignite after winter if an oxygen source is present. Because they are easily compressed under minimal weight, peat deposits pose major difficulties to builders of structures, roads, and railways. When the [[West Highland Line|West Highland railway line]] was built across [[Rannoch Moor]] in western Scotland, its builders had to float the tracks on a multi-thousand-ton mattress of tree roots, brushwood, earth and ash.

In the Bronze and Iron Ages, people used peat bogs for rituals to nature gods and spirits.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Bodies of the victims of such sacrifices have been found in various places in Scotland, England, Ireland, and especially northern Germany and Denmark. They are almost perfectly preserved by the [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]] properties of the acidic water (see [[Tollund Man]] for one of the most famous examples of a [[bog body]]). Peat wetlands also used to have a degree of [[Metallurgy|metallurgical]] importance, being during the [[Middle Ages|Dark Ages]] the primary source of [[bog iron]] that was used to create swords and armour for [[Vikings]]. Many peat swamps along the coast of [[Malaysia]] serve as a natural means of flood mitigation, with any overflow being absorbed by the peat, provided forests are still present to prevent peat fires.

==Characteristics and uses by nation==
===Finland===
{{See also|Peat energy in Finland}}
[[File:Toppila power plant.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Toppila Power Station]], a peat-fired facility in [[Oulu]], [[Finland]]]]
The climate, geography, and environment of [[Finland]] favours bog and peat bog formation. Thus, peat is available in considerable quantities. This abundant resource (often mixed with wood at an average of 2.6%) is burned to produce [[heat]] and [[electricity]]. Peat provides around 6.2% of Finland's annual energy production, second only to Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070928032013/http://www.ktm.fi/index.phtml?l=en&amp;s=179 Renewable energy sources and peat], Ministry of Trade and Industry of Finland, last updated: 04.07.2005&lt;/ref&gt; The contribution of peat to [[greenhouse gas]] emissions of Finland can exceed 10&amp;nbsp;million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide per year – equal to the total emissions of all passenger-car traffic in Finland.

Finland classifies peat as a slowly renewing [[biomass fuel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.motiva.fi/fi/kirjasto/uusiutuvatenergialahteetsuomessa/muutbiomassaenergianlahteet/turve.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705232715/http://www.motiva.fi/fi/kirjasto/uusiutuvatenergialahteetsuomessa/muutbiomassaenergianlahteet/turve.html |date=July 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Peat producers in Finland often claim that peat is a special form of [[biofuel]] because of the relatively fast retake rate of released [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] if the bog is not forested for the following 100&amp;nbsp;years. Also, agricultural and forestry-drained peat bogs actively release more CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; annually than is released in peat energy production in Finland. The average regrowth rate of a single peat bog, however, is indeed slow, from 1,000 up to 5,000&amp;nbsp;years. Furthermore, it is a common practice to forest used peat bogs instead of giving them a chance to renew. This leads to lower levels of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; storage than the original peat bog.

Retrieved on 2011-05-09.&lt;/ref&gt; the carbon dioxide emissions of peat are higher than those of coal (at 94.6&amp;nbsp;g&amp;nbsp;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/MJ) and [[natural gas]] (at 56.1). According to one study, increasing the average amount of wood in the fuel mixture from the current 2.6% to 12.5% would take the emissions down to 93&amp;nbsp;g&amp;nbsp;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/MJ. That said, little effort is being made to achieve this.&lt;ref&gt;[http://virtual.vtt.fi/inf/pdf/workingpapers/2004/W12.pdf VTT 2004: Wood in peat fuel&amp;nbsp;– impact on the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions according to IPCC guidelines]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peat extraction is also seen by some conservationists{{Who|date=July 2009}} as the main threat to mire [[biodiversity]] in Finland. The International Mire Conservation Group (IMCG) in 2006 urged the local and national governments of Finland to protect and conserve the remaining pristine peatland ecosystems. This includes the cessation of drainage and peat extraction in intact mire sites and the abandoning of current and planned groundwater extraction that may affect these sites.

In Ireland, large-scale domestic and industrial peat usage is widespread. In the [[Republic of Ireland]], a state-owned company called {{lang|ga|[[Bord na Móna]]}} is responsible for managing peat extraction. It processes the extracted peat into milled peat which is used in power stations and sells processed peat fuel in the form of peat [[briquette]]s which are used for domestic heating. These are oblong bars of densely compressed, dried, and shredded peat. [[Peat moss]] is a manufactured product for use in garden cultivation. Turf (dried out peat [[sod]]s) is also commonly used in rural areas.

===Russia===

Use of peat for energy production was prominent in the [[Soviet Union]], especially in 1965. In 1929, over 40% of the Soviet Union's electric energy came from peat, which dropped to 1% by 1980.

===United Kingdom===
====England====
The [[Peat extraction on the Somerset Levels|extraction of peat]] from the [[Somerset Levels]] began during the Roman times and has been carried out since the Levels were first drained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Somerset Peat Paper&amp;nbsp;– Issues consultation for the Minerals Core Strategy |url=http://www.somerset.gov.uk/irj/go/km/docs/CouncilDocuments/SCC/Documents/Environment/Minerals%20and%20waste/Mineral%20consultation%20papers/Peat%20Extraction%20Paper.pdf |publisher=[[Somerset County Council]] |format=PDF |accessdate=30 November 2011 |page=7 |date=September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310135710/http://www.somerset.gov.uk/irj/go/km/docs/CouncilDocuments/SCC/Documents/Environment/Minerals%20and%20waste/Mineral%20consultation%20papers/Peat%20Extraction%20Paper.pdf |archivedate=10 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Dartmoor]], there were several commercial distillation plants formed and run by the British Patent Naphtha Company in 1844. These produced [[naphtha]] on a commercial scale from the high-quality local peat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/peat_moor.htm], Dartmoor history&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fenn's, Whixall and Bettisfield Mosses]] is an element of a post-[[Last glacial period|Ice Age]] peat bog that straddles the England–[[Wales]] border and contains many rare plant and animal species due to the acidic environment created by the peat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ccgc.gov.uk/landscape--wildlife/protecting-our-landscape/special-landscapes--sites/protected-landscape/national-nature-reserves/fenns-whixall-and-bettisfiel.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029202832/http://www.ccgc.gov.uk/landscape--wildlife/protecting-our-landscape/special-landscapes--sites/protected-landscape/national-nature-reserves/fenns-whixall-and-bettisfiel.aspx |archivedate=2013-10-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Only lightly hand-dug, it is now a [[national nature reserve (United Kingdom)|national nature reserve]] and is being restored to its natural condition.

====Northern Ireland====
In [[Northern Ireland]], there is small-scale domestic turf cutting in rural areas, but areas of bogs have been diminished because of changes in agriculture. In response, [[afforestation]] has seen the establishment of tentative steps towards conservation such as [[Peatlands Park]], [[County Armagh]] which is an [[Area of Special Scientific Interest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Peatlands Park ASSI | work=NI Environment Agency | url=http://www.wonderfulni.info/protected_areas_home/new_assi_landing_page/county_armagh-2/peatlands_park_assi.htm | accessdate=14 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scotland====
Some [[Scotch whisky]] distilleries, such as those on [[Islay]], use peat fires to dry malted [[barley]]. The drying process takes about 30 hours. This gives the whiskies a distinctive smoky flavour, often called "peatiness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whisky.com/information/knowledge/tasting/flavour/peat-and-its-significance-in-whisky.html|title=Peat and Its Significance in Whisky|publisher=|accessdate=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The peatiness, or degree of peat flavour, of a whisky, is calculated in [[Parts-per notation#ppm|ppm]] of [[phenol]]. Normal Highland whiskies have a peat level of up to 30 ppm, and the whiskies on Islay usually have up to 50 ppm. In rare types like the [[Bruichladdich distillery|Octomore]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whisky.com/whisky-database/bottle-search/details/fdb/Bottles/Details/octomore-031.html|title=Octomore 5 Years 03.1|publisher=|accessdate=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the whisky can have more than 100 ppm of phenol. Scotch Ales can also use peat roasted malt, imparting a similar smoked flavor.

==Generic characteristics and uses==
===Agriculture===
In Sweden, farmers use dried peat to absorb excrement from cattle that are wintered indoors. The most important property of peat is retaining moisture in container soil when it is dry while preventing the excess of water from killing roots when it is wet. Peat can store [[nutrient]]s although it is not fertile itself&amp;nbsp;– it is [[Polyelectrolyte|polyelectrolytic]] with a high ion-exchange capacity due to its oxidized lignin. Peat is discouraged as a soil amendment by the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]], England, since 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peat-free compost at Kew| publisher = RBG Kew| year = 2011 | url = http://www.kew.org/visit-kew-gardens/garden-attractions-A-Z/kids-attractions/compost-heap.htm| accessdate = 2011-06-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916065726/http://www.kew.org/visit-kew-gardens/garden-attractions-A-Z/kids-attractions/compost-heap.htm|archive-date=2011-09-16|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; While bark-based peat-free potting soil mixes are on the rise, particularly in the U.K., peat remains an important raw material for [[horticulture]] in Canada, as well as parts of the United States. However, it is recommended to treat peat thermally, e.g., through [[Soil steam sterilization|soil steaming]] in order to kill pests and reactivate nutrients.

===Freshwater aquaria===
Peat is sometimes used in freshwater [[aquarium|aquaria]]. It is seen most commonly in soft water or [[blackwater river]] systems such as those mimicking the [[Amazon River]] basin. In addition to being soft in texture and therefore suitable for demersal (bottom-dwelling) species such as ''[[Corydoras]]'' catfish, peat is reported to have a number of other beneficial functions in freshwater aquaria. It softens water by acting as an [[ion exchange]]r; it also contains substances that are beneficial for plants, and for the reproductive health of fishes. Peat can prevent algae growth and kill microorganisms. Peat often stains the water yellow or brown due to the leaching of [[tannin]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Scheurmann | first=Ines | others=(trans. for Barron's Educational Series, Hauppauge, New York: 2000) | title=Natural Aquarium Handbook, The | year=1985 | publisher=Gräfe &amp; Unzer GmbH | location=Munich, Germany }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water filtration===
Peat is used in water filtration, such as for the treatment of septic tank effluent and for urban runoff.

===Balneotherapy===
Peat is widely used in [[balneotherapy]] (the use of bathing to treat disease). Many traditional spa treatments include peat as part of [[peloid]]s. Such health treatments have an enduring tradition in European countries including Poland, the Czech Republic, Germany, and Austria. Some of these old spas date back to the 18th century and are still active today. The most common types of peat application in balneotherapy are peat [[mud bath|muds]], [[poultice]]s, and [[suspension bath]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peatsociety.org/about-us/commissions-and-working-groups/c6-balneology?id=90 International Peatland Society]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Peat Balneology, Medicine and Therapeutics&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Peat archives ===
Authors Rydin and Jeglum in ''Biology of Habitats'' described the concept of peat archives, a phrase coined by influential peatland scientist [[Harry Godwin]] in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Godwin |first=Sir Harry |year=1981 |title=The archives of the peat bogs |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |ref={{SfnRef|Godwin|1981}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rydin_2013"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Håkan |last1=Rydin |first2=John K. |last2=Jeglum |date=18 July 2013 |pages=400 |title=The Biology of Peatlands |edition=2 |series=Biology of Habitats |origyear=8 Jun 2006 |publisher=University of Oxford Press |ISBN=0198528728 |ref={{SfnRef|Rydin|Jeglum|2014}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Keddy_2010"&gt;{{citation |last=Keddy |first=P.A. |year=2010 |title=Wetland Ecology: Principles and Conservation |edition=2 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK. |pages=323–325|ref={{SfnRef|Keddy|2010}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|sign=|source=Rydin, 2013|In a peat profile there is a fossilized record of changes over time in the vegetation, pollen, spores, animals (from microscopic to the giant elk), and archaeological remains that have been deposited in place, as well as pollen, spores and particles brought in by wind and weather. These remains are collectively termed the peat archives.}}

In ''Quaternary Palaeoecology'', first published in 1980, Birks and Birks described how [[Paleoecology|paleoecological]] studies "of peat can be used to reveal what plant communities were present (locally and regionally), what time period each community occupied, how environmental conditions changed, and how the environment affected the ecosystem in that time and place."&lt;ref name="Rydin_2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Birks_1980"&gt;{{cite book |title=Quaternary Palaeoecology |first1= Harry John Betteley |last1=Birks |first2=Hilary H. |last2=Birks |publisher=Blackburn Press |origyear=1980 |year=2004 |pages=289 pages}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists continue to compare modern [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] (Hg) accumulation rates in bogs with historical natural-archives records in peat bogs and lake sediments to estimate the potential human impacts on the [[biogeochemical]] cycle of mercury, for example.&lt;ref name="Biester_Bindler_2009"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.metla.fi/julkaisut/workingpapers/2009/mwp128-13.pdf |format=PDF |series=Working Papers of the Finnish Forest Research Institute |number=128|title=Modelling Past Mercury Deposition from Peat Bogs – The Influence of Peat Structure and 210Pb Mobility |first1=Harald |last1=Biester |first2=Richard |last2=Bindler |accessdate=21 October 2014 |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, different dating models and technologies for measuring date sediments and peat profiles accumulated over the last 100–150 years, have been used, including the widely used vertical distribution of 210Pb, the [[inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry]] (ICP-SMS),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elmvalefoundation.org/publications/A64.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304081517/http://www.elmvalefoundation.org/publications/A64.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently the initial penetration (IP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Modeling the downward transport of 210Pb in mires and repercussions on the deriv| bibcode=2013EGUGA..1511054O}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Peat hags ===
Peat "hags" are a form of erosion that occurs at the sides of gullies that cut into the peat or, sometimes, in isolation.&lt;ref name=YPP&gt;[http://www.yppartnership.org.uk/restoration/peat-hags/ ''Peat Hags''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160712032305/http://www.yppartnership.org.uk/restoration/peat-hags/ |date=2016-07-12 }} at www.yppartnership.org.uk, website of the Yorkshire Peat Partnership. Retrieved 9 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Hags may result when flowing water cuts downwards into the peat and when fire or overgrazing exposes the peat surface. Once the peat is exposed in these ways, it is prone to further erosion by wind, water, and livestock. The result is overhanging vegetation and peat. Hags are too steep and unstable for vegetation to establish itself, so they continue to erode unless restorative action is taken.&lt;ref name=YPP/&gt;

==Environmental and ecological issues==
[[File:Co2.recent.ch.png|thumb|Increase, and change relative to previous year, of the atmospheric concentration of [[carbon dioxide]].]]

The distinctive ecological conditions of peat wetlands provide a habitat for distinctive fauna and flora. For example, [[whooping cranes]] nest in North American peatlands, while [[Siberian crane]]s nest in the West Siberian peatland. Such habitats also have many species of wild orchids and carnivorous plants. It takes centuries for a peat bog to recover from disturbance. (For more on biological communities, see [[wetland]], [[bog]] or [[fen]].)

The world's largest peat bog is located in Western Siberia. It is the size of France and Germany combined. Recent studies show that it is thawing for the first time in 11,000&amp;nbsp;years. As the permafrost melts, it could release billions of tonnes of [[methane]] gas into the atmosphere. The world's peatlands are thought to contain 180 to 455 billion [[tonne|metric tonnes]] of sequestered carbon, and they release into the atmosphere 20 to 45 million metric tons of methane annually. The peatlands' contribution to long-term fluctuations in these atmospheric gases has been a matter of considerable debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Glen M. |last=MacDonald |first2=David W. |last2=Beilman |first3=Konstantine V. |last3=Kremenetski |first4=Yongwei |last4=Sheng |first5=Laurence C. |last5=Smith |lastauthoramp=yes |first6=Andrei A. |last6=Velichko |year=2006 |title=Rapid early development of circumarctic peatlands and atmospheric CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; variations |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=314 |issue=5797 |pages=285–288 |doi=10.1126/science.1131722 |bibcode=2006Sci...314..285M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peat drainage===
Large areas of organic wetland (peat) soils are currently drained for agriculture, forestry, and peat extraction. This process is taking place all over the world. This not only destroys the habitat of many species but also heavily fuels climate change.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} As a result of peat drainage, the organic carbon&amp;nbsp;– which built over thousands of years and is normally underwater&amp;nbsp;– is suddenly exposed to the air. It decomposes and turns into [[carbon dioxide]] ({{CO2}}), which is released into the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wetlands.org/peatclimate Wetlands.org]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Wetlands International | Peatlands and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Emissions&lt;/ref&gt; The global {{CO2}} emissions from drained peatlands have increased from 1,058 Mton in 1990 to 1,298 Mton in 2008 (a 20% increase). This increase has particularly taken place in developing countries, of which Indonesia, China, Malaysia, and Papua New Guinea are the fastest-growing top emitters. This estimate excludes emissions from peat fires (conservative estimates amount to at least 4,000 Mton/{{CO2}}-eq./yr for south-east Asia). With 174 Mton/{{CO2}}-eq./yr the EU is after Indonesia (500 Mton) and before Russia (161 Mton) the world's second-largest emitter of drainage-related peatland {{CO2}} (excl. extracted peat and fires). Total {{CO2}} emissions from the worldwide 500,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of degraded peatland may exceed 2.0 Gtons (including emissions from peat fires) which is almost 6% of all global carbon emissions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wetlands.org/peatco2 Wetlands.org]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, The Global Peat CO2 Picture, Wetlands International and Greifswald University, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Peat has a high carbon content and can burn under low moisture conditions. Once ignited by the presence of a heat source (e.g., a wildfire penetrating the subsurface), it [[smolder|smoulders]]. These smouldering fires can burn undetected for very long periods of time (months, years, and even centuries) propagating in a creeping fashion through the underground peat layer.

Despite the damage that the burning of raw peat can cause, bogs are naturally subject to wildfires and depend on the wildfires to keep woody competition from lowering the water table and shading out many bog plants. Several families of plants including the carnivorous ''[[Sarracenia]]'' (trumpet pitcher), [[Dionaea (plant)|''Dionaea'']] (Venus flytrap), ''[[Utricularia]]'' (bladderworts) and non-carnivorous plants such as the [[Lilium pyrophilum|sandhills lily]], [[Ctenium aromaticum|toothache grass]] and many species of orchid are now threatened and in some cases endangered from the combined forces of human drainage, negligence, and absence of fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pitcherplant.org/|title=Meadowview Biological Research Station - Preserving and Restoring Pitcher Plant Bogs|author=Michael Kevin Smith|publisher=|accessdate=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unc.edu/news/archives/may03/lilly050903.html|title=New lily species found in eastern N.C.

It is estimated that in 1997, [[1997 Southeast Asian haze|peat and forest fires in Indonesia]] released between 0.81 and 2.57 Gt of carbon; equivalent to 13–40 percent of the amount released by global fossil fuel burning, and greater than the carbon uptake of the world's biosphere.

In North America, peat fires can occur during severe droughts throughout their occurrence, from boreal forests in Canada to swamps and fens in the subtropical southern Florida [[Everglades]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Florida Everglades|url=http://sofia.usgs.gov/publications/circular/1182/|publisher=U.S. Geological Survey,|accessdate=11 June 2013|date=15 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once a fire has burnt through the area, hollows in the peat are burnt out, and hummocks are desiccated but can contribute to ''Sphagnum'' recolonization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Nicole |last=Fenton |first2=Nicolas |last2=Lecomte |first3=Sonia |last3=Légaré |lastauthoramp=yes |first4=Yves |last4=Bergeron |title=Paludification in black spruce (''Picea mariana'') forests of eastern Canada: Potential factors and management implications |journal=Forest Ecology and Management |volume=213 |issue=1–3 |year=2005 |pages=151–159 |doi=10.1016/j.foreco.2005.03.017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2010, an unusually high [[2010 Northern Hemisphere summer heat wave|heat wave]] of up to {{convert|40|C|F}} ignited large deposits of peat in Central Russia, [[2010 Russian wildfires|burning thousands of houses]] and covering the capital of Moscow with a toxic [[smog|smoke blanket]]. The situation remained critical until the end of August 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-10762921 |title=Fog from peat fires blankets Moscow amid heat wave |work=BBC |date=26 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2012486819_apeurussiafires.html?syndication=rss |title=Russia begins to localize fires, others rage |work=Associated Press |date= 30 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wise use and protection==
In June 2002, the [[United Nations Development Programme]] launched the Wetlands Ecosystem and Tropical Peat Swamp Forest Rehabilitation Project. This project was targeted to last for 5&amp;nbsp;years, and brings together the efforts of various non-government organisations.

In November 2002, the International Peatland (formerly Peat) Society (IPS) and the International Mire Conservation Group (IMCG) published guidelines on the "Wise Use of Mires and Peatlands&amp;nbsp;– Backgrounds and Principles including a framework for decision-making". The aim of this publication is to develop mechanisms that can balance the conflicting demands on the global peatland heritage, to ensure its wise use to meet the needs of humankind.

In June 2008, the IPS published the book ''Peatlands and Climate Change'', summarising the currently available knowledge on the topic. In 2010, IPS presented a "Strategy for Responsible Peatland Management", which can be applied worldwide for decision-making.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4158">'''Public Notary Office''' ([[Simplified Chinese|Chinese]]: 公证处 [[Hanyu Pinyin|Pinyin]]:gōng zhèng chù ) is a subordinate agency of the Ministry of Justice of the People's Republic of China. It is responsible for certifying documents according to Chinese legal system. Examples of services offered are certification of Birth Certificates, identification cards, Household Registration documents, Driver's License, Police Records, Health Records, Property title, [[power of attorney]], guarantor documents, authorization documents, declaration documents, lottery tickets certification and business licenses.

==Purpose==
The functions of the Public Notary Office is classified into 4 functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legalinfo.gov.cn/english/LegalService/legalservice2_18.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061213141515/http://www.legalinfo.gov.cn/english/LegalService/legalservice2_18.htm |archivedate=2006-12-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# To safeguard the smooth process of the state economic restructuring and economic construction, maintain the order of [[socialist market economy]].
# To protect lawful rights and interests of citizens, legal persons and other organizations, prevent disputes and minimize litigation.
# To develop notary standards and promote the process of the international civil and economic activity. To protect lawful rights and interests of citizens, organizations, overseas Chinese and foreigners.
# To inform and educate the legal knowledge, improve legal sense of the people, maintain the legal system and guarantee the correct implement of state laws.

==History==
The Public Notary system was first established between the 1930s to the 1940s. It was enacted into legislation in 1935 by the government of the Republic of China. After the Chinese Civil War, the People's Republic of China in 1951 continued with developing the Public Notary system. The Central People's Government of the PRC or commonly refer to as the State Council took on the administration of the Public Notary system. It created many offices in provincial counties and towns to make it accessible to the common people.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legalinfo.gov.cn/english/LegalService/legalservice2_1.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070418190609/http://www.legalinfo.gov.cn/english/LegalService/legalservice2_1.htm |archivedate=2007-04-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the period between 1958 and 1959, the Public Notary system languished and due to Cultural Revolution it virtually came to a standstill for the next two decades. The Cultural Revolution expelled the bourgeoisie and capitalist, nationalizing private property, private ownership of businesses and land were prohibited and turn into collective public ownership. This reduced the demand for notarization of documents and legal services.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

It was not until 1978 with the central government embarking on market economic reforms that the Public Notary system became very important and relevant. In 1979, the Central People's Government enacting legislation for Public Notary Offices to be set up in all the Municipalities, provincial cities, prefecture level cities and towns. By some measure in 1979 there was a 15 fold increase in notarization services as compared to 1977. In 1982, all the laws and regulations for Public Notary system was in place. This increased the effectiveness of the system as well as supported China's experiment with market economic reforms.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8220">The '''SOGIE (Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity or Expression) Equality Bill''', also known as the '''Anti-Discrimination Bill (ADB)''', is a proposed legislation of the [[Congress of the Philippines]]. It is intended to prevent various economic and public accommodation-related acts of discrimination against people based on their sexual orientation, gender identity or expression.&lt;ref&gt;https://preen.inquirer.net/70414/debunking-some-misconceptions-about-the-sogie-equality-bill&lt;/ref&gt; The bill ''does not'' affects religious beliefs&lt;ref&gt;https://preen.inquirer.net/70414/debunking-some-misconceptions-about-the-sogie-equality-bill&lt;/ref&gt;, ''does not'' oppress other people’s rights as it is an anti-oppression bill&lt;ref&gt;https://preen.inquirer.net/70414/debunking-some-misconceptions-about-the-sogie-equality-bill&lt;/ref&gt;, and ''does not'' legalize same-sex marriages.&lt;ref&gt;https://preen.inquirer.net/70414/debunking-some-misconceptions-about-the-sogie-equality-bill&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislative history==
The bill was first filed in Congress in 2000 by then-senator [[Miriam Defensor-Santiago]] and then-[[Akbayan|Akbayan party-list]] Representative [[Etta Rosales]], in which the bill passed 3rd reading in the House but stalled in the Senate due to extreme-right conservative senators. Similar measures were filed by other senators in the 15th and 16th congresses which failed to see progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Elemia|first1=Camille|title=After 17 years, LGBT anti-discrimination bill up for Senate debate|url=https://www.rappler.com/nation/156139-lgbt-anti-discrimination-bill-senate-plenary|accessdate=25 September 2017|work=Rappler|date=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was re-filed by Defensor-Santiago in every congressional period in the Senate until the end of her last term in 2016. The counterpart bill in the House was also filed continuously by the representatives of [[Akbayan|Akbayan party-list]].

In 2017, the House bill (No. 4982), as filed in 2016 by Reps. [[Kaka Bag-ao]] and [[Geraldine Roman]] (and merged from multiple similar bills), passed 3rd reading for the first time since 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SOGIE Equality Bill passes House of Representatives|url=http://outragemag.com/sogie-equality-bill-passes-house-of-representatives/|website=Outrage|publisher=Fringe Publishing|accessdate=25 September 2017|date=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 198 members of the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]] voting for the bill and none opposing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Colcol|first1=Erwin|title=House OKs SOGIE Equality Bill on final reading|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/nation/626551/house-oks-sogie-equality-bill-on-final-reading/story/|accessdate=25 September 2017|work=GMA News|date=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The counterpart bill in the Senate, filed by Senator [[Risa Hontiveros]] (the first [[Akbayan]] senator), was in the period of interpolations by May 2018. It is backed by Senators [[Loren Legarda]], [[Grace Poe]], [[Nancy Binay]], [[Franklin Drilon]], [[Bam Aquino]], [[Chiz Escudero]], [[Ralph Recto]], [[Sonny Angara]], [[JV Ejercito]], [[Francis Pangilinan]], [[Juan Miguel Zubiri]], and [[Leila de Lima]], although de Lima is barred from voting on the bill as she is currently in police custody.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/nation/663671/4-senators-express-support-for-immediate-passage-of-sogie-bill/story/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1019786/urgent-passage-of-sogie-bill-at-senate-pressed&lt;/ref&gt; It was opposed by Senators [[Tito Sotto]], [[Manny Pacquiao]], and [[Joel Villanueva]]. Ironically, Villanueva has signed up as a 'co-author' of the bill he opposes.&lt;ref&gt;http://politics.com.ph/sogie-equality-bill-not-congress-says-sotto/&lt;/ref&gt; Other senators such as [[Win Gatchalian]], [[Cynthia Villar]], [[Koko Pimentel]], [[Antonio Trillanes]], [[Panfilo Lacson]], and [[Richard J. Gordon]] have not yet expressed their support or rejection of the bill, while [[Alan Peter Cayetano]] and [[Gregorio Honasan]] no longer have voting rights on Senate measures as they resigned to be part of the presidential cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;http://politics.com.ph/sogie-equality-bill-not-congress-says-sotto/&lt;/ref&gt; All in all, out of the existing 24 Senate seats: 12 seats support and can vote on the bill; 1 seat supports but cannot vote on the bill; 3 seats oppose and can vote on the bill; 6 seats can vote on the bill but have not yet given their positions on it; and 2 seats are ''de facto'' vacated.&lt;ref&gt;http://politics.com.ph/sogie-equality-bill-not-congress-says-sotto/&lt;/ref&gt; For a bill to pass the Senate, it needs a vote of 50% (12) of the body, plus one (1) vote for a total of thirteen (13) votes. The SOGIE Equality Bill currently is supported by 12 seats that are ''allowed to vote'' on the measure.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.senate.gov.ph/about/legpro.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill is also supported by the student governments of University of the Philippines-Diliman (UPD, Ateneo de Manila University (ADMU), De La Salle University(DLSU)-Manila, De La Salle - College of St. Benilde (CSB), Far Eastern University (FEU), Miriam College (MC), St. Scholastica’s College (SSC)-Manila and San Beda University (SBU). The longest running LGBT student organization UP Babaylan has also been supporting the bill ever since it was first filed. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/nation/663468/catholic-student-councils-to-senators-end-debate-pass-sogie/story/&lt;/ref&gt;, as well as known celebrities and icons such as [[Heart Evangelista]], [[Bianca Gonzalez]], [[Iza Calzado]], [[Dingdong Dantes]], [[Joey Mead King]], Divine Lee, [[Karen Davila]], [[Chot Reyes]], Tootsy Angara, BJ Pascual, Samantha Lee, [[Christine Bersola-Babao]], Rajo Laurel, Tim Yap, [[Anne Curtis]], Mari Jasmine, Laureen Uy, [[Pia Wurtzbach]], [[Lorenzo Tañada III]], [[Vice Ganda]], and [[Arnold Van Opstal]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/208035-celebrities-call-on-senators-pass-sogie-bill&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://news.abs-cbn.com/life/07/24/18/anne-curtis-other-celebs-appeal-to-senate-to-pass-lgbt-anti-discrimination-bill&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pep.ph/lifestyle/lifestyle/37873/tootsy-angara-heart-evangelista-what-their-pins-at-sona-2018-stand-for&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://entertainment.inquirer.net/285044/heart-evangelista-tootsy-angara-show-support-for-sogie-bill-wore-rainbow-pins-at-sona&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/209459-pia-wurtzbach-call-on-senate-pass-sogie-equality-bill&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.southluzon.politics.com.ph/2018/08/10/erin-tanada-urges-senate-to-pass-sogie-bill/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pep.ph/news/71303/dingdong-dantes-reiterates-importance-of-anti-discrimination-bill&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://m.inquirer.net/entertainment/299017&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2018, on the height of the bill's postponed debates, various discrimination events against the Filipino LGBT community surfaced, causing public calling for the passage of the SOGIE Equality Bill in the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2018/08/29/1846930/kaladkarens-experience-shows-urgency-pass-sogie-bill-hontiveros&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://news.abs-cbn.com/news/08/29/18/discrimination-vs-kaladkaren-a-wake-up-call-to-pass-lgbt-rights-bill-hontiveros&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous influential personalities, including political allies of the three senators who oppose the bill, sided with the calls to pass the landmark proposal.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/209459-pia-wurtzbach-call-on-senate-pass-sogie-equality-bill&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2018/08/29/1846930/kaladkarens-experience-shows-urgency-pass-sogie-bill-hontiveros&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1019786/urgent-passage-of-sogie-bill-at-senate-pressed&lt;/ref&gt; One of the three senators who opposes the bill is incumbent Senate president [[Tito Sotto]].&lt;ref&gt;https://preen.inquirer.net/70414/debunking-some-misconceptions-about-the-sogie-equality-bill&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7991">The '''Santiago Principles''' or formally the '''Sovereign Wealth Funds: Generally Accepted Principles and Practices''' ('''GAPP''')&lt;ref name=II001/&gt; are designed as a common global set of 24 voluntary guidelines that assign [[best practice]]s for the operations of [[Sovereign wealth fund|Sovereign Wealth Funds]] (SWFs).&lt;ref name="IFSWF002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iwgswf001"/&gt;&lt;ref name=IMF001/&gt;&lt;ref name=KIA001/&gt;&lt;ref name=Behrendt001/&gt; They are a consequence of the concern of investors and regulators in the inadequate transparency, independence, and governance in the industry. They are guidelines to be followed by sovereign wealth fund management to maintain a stable [[global financial system]], proper controls around risk, regulation and a sound governance structure&lt;ref name="IFSWF004"/&gt;

As of 2016 30&lt;ref name="IFSWF003"/&gt; funds have formally signed up to the Principles and joined the IFSWF representing collectively 80% of assets managed by sovereign funds globally or US$5.5 trillion.&lt;ref name="HFSB001"/&gt;

The principles are maintained and promoted by the [[International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds]] (IFSWF)&lt;ref name="IFSWF001"/&gt;&lt;ref name=II001/&gt; and whose membership have to either have implemented or aspire to implement the principles.&lt;ref name=hacienda001/&gt;

== History ==
In 2008, there was growing concern by investors and regulators about SWFs, partially about visibility, accountably and the governance structure of them. To address these concerns, a joint effort between the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and the "International Working Group of Sovereign Wealth Funds" (IWG-SWF) which represented the coming together of 14 principle funds including some of the largest,&lt;ref name="IFSWF003"/&gt; such as [[GIC Private Limited]] and [[Abu Dhabi Investment Authority]].&lt;ref name=GIC001/&gt; The IWG-SWF then drafted the 24 Santiago Principles, to set out common [[international standard]]s regarding transparency, independence, and governance which SWFs might follow. These were made public after being presented to the IMF International Monetary Financial Committee on 11 October 2008.&lt;ref name="IFSWF002"/&gt;

The working group was then replaced by a permanent body on the 6 April 2009, the "International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds" to maintain and promote the new standards going forward and encourage other sovereign wealth fund to sign up.&lt;ref name="IFSWF001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IFSWF006"/&gt;

==Overview==
According to the IFSWF, the creation of the Santiago Principles was driven by the following goals for SWFs:&lt;ref name="IFSWF004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IFSWF006"/&gt;&lt;ref name=hacienda001/&gt;

* To help maintain a stable [[global financial system]] and free flow of capital and [[investment]];
* To comply with all applicable regulatory and [[Corporation#Financial disclosure|disclosure]] requirements in the countries in which they invest;
* To ensure that SWFs invest on the basis of [[economic risk|economic]] and [[financial risk]] and return-related considerations; and
* To ensure that SWFs have in place a transparent and sound governance structure that provides adequate operational controls, [[risk management]], and [[accountability]].

==24 principles==
The Santiago Principles state that SWFs need to have the following:&lt;ref name=II001/&gt;&lt;ref name="IFSWF002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iwgswf001"/&gt;
# A sound legal framework,
# A well-defined mission,
# Domestic activities coordinated with fiscal and monetary authorities,
# Clearly defined rules for drawdowns,
# Transparency to the owner, 
# Clear division of roles,
# Governing bodies appointed in a predetermined manner,
# Governing bodies that act in the best interest of the SWF,
# Independence,
# Formal definition of accountability,
# Annual reporting,
# Independent auditors,
# Ethics and professionalism,
# Rules-based outsourcing,
# Ability to abide by rules of foreign countries,
# Operational independence from the owner,
# Public transparency,
# Clear investment policies,
# Commercial orientation, 
# Restrictions against using privileged information,
# Shareholder rights policies,
# Effective risk management,
# Proper reporting of performance,
# And regular reviews to ensure its compliance with the foregoing Santiago Principles.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Sciotoordnanceimage.jpg|thumb|Workers at the Scioto Ordnance Plant in Marion Ohio pose during the plants operation between 1942-1945]]  --&gt;The '''Scioto Ordnance Plant''' (SOP) was an ammunitions and bomb making facility built in [[Marion County, Ohio]] by the [[United States Army]] in 1942. The plant operated until 1945 when production wound down. Also built adjacent was the '''Marion Engineering Depot''' which was authorized in the summer of 1942. Land for the plant was taken in [[Grand Prairie Township, Marion County, Ohio|Grand Prairie]], [[Scott Township, Marion County, Ohio|Scott]], [[Claridon Township, Marion County, Ohio|Clairdon]] and [[Marion Township, Marion County, Ohio|Marion]] Townships in an area covering {{convert|12500|acre|km2}}.

Families who owned property within the zone identified for the facility were notified March 2, 1942 that they had to vacate their land by May 1, 1942. Not only did this mean that the displaced had to find a place to live in the midst of a housing and fuel shortage, but it also meant moving and/or selling [[livestock]] and agricultural equipment. Federal contractors began removing field fencing in April 1942. While land owners received a "fair" valuation for their property, relocation expenses were not paid. Several property owners claimed that they never received any compensation from the government.

After May 1, 1942, most of the farmsteads located inside the perimeter were leveled; underground bunkers and production buildings were built in clusters throughout the SOP site. By June 1942 SOP was employing 2,900 employees, many of whom moved north from Southern Ohio and [[Kentucky]] for the high paying wages offered.

Once in operation, the plant (under the operation of [[U.S. Rubber]]) produced fuses and boosters, 20&amp;nbsp;mm [[bullet]]s, 50 caliber bullets, 50 caliber artillery shells, 65&amp;nbsp;mm shells and 75&amp;nbsp;mm shells. [[Incendiary bomb]]s and [[napalm]] barrel bombs, similar to those used on [[Dresden]] by [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] were also produced at the site. Munitions containers served duel duty by carrying SOP products overseas, and then doubling as coffins for those killed in action.

[[Germany|German]] Prisoners of War were housed on the site (in an area referred to as “Camp Marion”) beginning in December 1944.

==Post-war problems==
Following the end of the war, land taken for SOP was resold to civilians. Local farmers who had lost their land had first option to repurchase their former lands back from the government.  Land that was not purchased back by displaced residents was then sold to other buyers. A housing development - Grandview - was built over the magazine area of the former plant.

In 1949, [[Uranium]] handling was planned for the site, with the contract going to [[Monsanto Company]]. However production at the facility never began in earnest.

In 2000 it was revealed that students attending [[River Valley High School (Caledonia, Ohio)]], built on land formerly occupied by the Marion Engineering Depot, had higher than usual instances [[leukemia]]. Tests performed on the site by the [[Ohio EPA]] and the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] proved inconclusive. A private consultant hired by a parents organization found evidence of toxic chemical waste on the River Valley site dating back to the 1940s. As a result, these findings, and because of Ohio EPA problems with investigation, River Valley pursued building a new school campus and eventually abandoned the Engineering Depot Site.

Today, most of the buildings have been demolished, or are being used by the private farmers who now own the land.  A few buildings are visible today, and can be seen from New Road (which runs north-south parallel to Pole Lane Rd).  During the 1990s, at the height of the investigation into the health issues which many residents attributed to the ordnance plant, there were rows and rows of 50 gallon drums sealed and seemingly ready for disposal located in a field a few hundred yards west of New Road.  Most assumed this was waste that the Army Corps of Engineers had collected and planned to dispose of.  The chapel for the base still exists, although it is unused.  It is located at the corner of Pole Lane Rd and Likens Rd.  At one point it was inhabited as a residence, but has been unused and abandoned for many years.  In the neighborhood of Grandview, which is north from the chapel and west off of Pole Lane Rd, there are still remnants of the plant.  In some of the undeveloped areas of the neighborhood in the woods, you can still find large flat overgrown slabs of concrete platforms, large concrete sidewalks, all of which now are on private property.  This can also be seen in the fields west of Pole Lane Rd.  There are concrete roads which were most likely used for vehicles.  The Marion International Airport is also located on Pole Lane Rd.  For years many pilots had reported that during the winter as they flew over the area they could see a large square patch of land where the snow would melt in an exact square, while the rest of the land surrounded it remained covered in snow.  It was later discovered that this area of land was where the Army had dug and buried chemicals used in ammunition production (phosphorus etc.), and as the chemicals mixed with the oxygen in the ground it would melt the snow that settled on it.  Directly across the road from the church at Pole Land and Likens is a crumbled concrete platform.  It is roughly 12' square, and all that is left is about 2' high of concrete and several pieces of steel rusted re-bar.  This structure was originally a guard tower used for observation when German prisoners were held at the camp.  During the 1940s, many of the German prisoners were used as labor in the city of Marion.  Local residents who were alive at the time can recall the prisoners being used for painting, maintenance, collecting trash, building improvements, etc.  Although they were POW's, they were treated well and fairly by the Army.

Most of the physical history of this area of Marion is gone, except for the church, a few buildings, and the Marion Depot located on Rt 309, which still houses an Army station and a train loading-unloading station (the Army reserve HQ previously located at the corner of Pole Lane Rd and Rt 309 has subsequently closed also).  The memories of the history of this area still live strong considering this has been a part of history in Marion Ohio for nearly 70 years.

The majority speech of [[Lord Hoffmann]] contains important principles about [[Omission (law)|omissions]] liability and the [[Administrative liability in English Law|liability of public authorities]].

== Facts ==
Ms Wise was turning right at an acute intersection in [[Wymondham]]. Her view was obscured by an earthen bank which the [[Norfolk County Council]]'s highway authority had earmarked for removal but since neglected. Ms Wise pulled into the road as Mr Stovin was approaching at speed on his motorbike. Unable to slow down in time, he crashed into Ms Wise's vehicle.

== Judgment ==
Mr Stovin successfully sued Ms Wise in negligence. The High Court held her 70% to blame for the accident, and the Council 30%. The question on appeal was solely whether the Council could indeed be liable. The [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales]] held that it was.

=== House of Lords ===
The House of Lords upheld the Council's appeal. [[Lord Hoffmann]] wrote the majority opinion (with Lords [[Lord Goff|Goff]] and [[Lord Jauncey of Tullichettle|Jauncey]] concurring). [[Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead|Lord Nicholls]] dissented (with [[Lord Slynn of Hadley|Lord Slynn]] concurring). 

== Legacy ==
''Stovin v Wise'' is a decision of major significance in the development of [[negligence liability]] in [[English law]]. It deals with both the [[Administrative liability in English Law|liability of state defendants]] and liability for [[Omission (law)|omissions]]; the case exemplifies, and helped to establish, English law's conservative attitude to both.

'''Sublink Network''' was a non-profit association founded in [[Italy]] in 1989 to allow cost-sharing access to the [[Internet]]. Sublink Network was registered with the '''sublink.org''' domain (this domain now belongs to a different organization not related to the original Sublink Network). Sublink Network had its own sublink.* newsgroup hierarchy and a cross link with the Italian branch of [[FidoNet]].

==History==
Its founders on September 25, 1989 were: Paolo Ventafridda (president), Paolo Pennisi, Marco Sacchi, Carlo Vellano, Davide Yachaya and Mauro Mozzarelli. The association was based in Milan, ITALY.
The association for a few years had a [[UUCP]] [[dialup]] link to [[Rutgers university]], but later obtained free support from [[Olivetti]] who provided [[Internet mail]] and [[newsgroups]] (now named "groups" by google) feed.  At its peak in 1991-1995 Sublink Network counted around one hundred nodes distributed across the Italian territory.

Sublink was the very first public (non-academic) internet email and newsgroup network in Italy, with very low access fees (around $100 a year), fast backbone modems running at 19200 [[Bit rate|bps]] (the average modem was 2400 bit/s at that time), and fully registered to the NIC. When after 1997, low cost [[Point-to-Point Protocol|PPP]] commercial access to the Internet started to become available, interest for UUCP cost-share Internet feeds started to decline and the association was naturally dissolved.

'''The Society of Legal Scholars''' ('''SLS''') is the [[learned society]] for those who teach law in a [[university]] or similar institution or who are otherwise engaged in legal scholarship. As of the beginning of 2016 the Society had over 3,000 members consisting of academic and practising lawyers in a wide variety of subject areas.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.legalscholars.ac.uk SLS website] &lt;/ref&gt; It has [[Charitable organization|charitable]] status.

The SLS publishes one of the UK's leading generalist peer-reviewed law journals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1748-121X Legal Studies] &lt;/ref&gt;

The Society was founded in 1908 by [[Edward Jenks]] as '''The Society of Public Teachers of Law''' and changed its name to the SLS in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ials.sas.ac.uk/library/archives/sptl.htm History of the Society on [[Institute of Advanced Legal Studies]] website]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>/* EU competition law: block exemptions for vertical agreements */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2496">{{Competition law}}
A '''vertical agreement''' is a term used in [[competition law]] to denote agreements between firms at different levels of the supply chain. For instance, a manufacturer of consumer electronics might have a vertical agreement with a retailer according to which the latter would promote their products in return for lower prices. [[Franchising]] is a form of vertical agreement, and under [[European Union competition law]] this falls within the scope of Article 101.&lt;ref&gt;''Consten v. Grundig&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether a vertical agreement actually restricts competition and whether in that case the benefits [[wikt:outweigh|outweigh]] the anti-[[competitive]] effects will often depend on the market structure.

==EU competition law: block exemptions for vertical agreements==
Vertical agreements that fulfil the conditions for exemption and do not contain any so-called "hardcore restrictions" of competition are exempted from the prohibition in Article 101(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union by Regulation 330/2010 &lt;ref&gt;''[[European Union regulation|Commission Regulation]] ([[European Union|EU]]) 330/2010 on the application of Article 101(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union to categories of vertical agreements and concerted practices&lt;/ref&gt;
. The main exception is agreements for motor vehicle distribution, which remain subject to Regulation 1400/2002 &lt;ref&gt;''[[European Union regulation|Commission Regulation]] ([[European Community|EC]]) NO 1400/2002 of 31 July 2002 on the application of Article 81(3) of the Treaty to categories of vertical agreements and concerted practices in the [[motor vehicle]] [[List of recognized economic sectors|sector]]&lt;/ref&gt; until 31 May 2013, pursuant to a three-year extension granted in Regulation 461/2010.&lt;ref&gt;[[European Union regulation|Commission Regulation]] ([[European Union|EU]]) 461/2010 on the application of Article 101(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union to categories of vertical agreements and concerted practices in the motor vehicle sector&lt;/ref&gt; Although this latter regulation applies Regulation 330/2010 to agreements for the repair of motor vehicles and for the distribution of spare parts as of 1 June 2013, it also supplements Regulation 330 with three additional "hardcore" clauses

In the [[United Kingdom]], the day is recognized on the first Thursday in March. World Book Day was celebrated for the first time on 23 April 1995.

==Date selection==
The original idea was of the Valencian writer Vicente Clavel Andrés as a way to honour the author [[Miguel de Cervantes]], first on 7 October, his birth date, then on 23 April, his death date. In 1995 UNESCO decided that the World Book and Copyright Day would be celebrated on 23 April, as the date is also the anniversary of the death of [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Inca Garcilaso de la Vega]], as well as that of the birth or death of several other prominent authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/events/bookday/ |title=World Book and Copyright Day, 23 April |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; (In a historical coincidence, Shakespeare and Cervantes died on the same ''date'' — 23 April 1616 — but not on the same ''day'', as at the time, Spain used the [[Gregorian calendar]] and England used the [[Julian calendar]]; Shakespeare actually died 10 days after Cervantes died, on 3 May of the Gregorian calendar.)
